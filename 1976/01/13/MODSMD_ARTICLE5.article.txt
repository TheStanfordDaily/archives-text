# ASSU committee members elected

### LORI MATSKAWA 
The ASSU Senate elected three new
members to the ASSU Nominations
Committee last night, all of whom de
sire to improve communications bet
ween the committee and the student
body by opening up the committee to
student scrutiny.
The Nominations Committee
chooses all students who eventually
serve on university committees. It
sorts applications, conducts inter
views and makes recommendations
for nominees. Nominees are then ap
proved by the Senate.
Tom "Tuna" Price, a first-year law
student; Dan Howard, a junior major
ing in biology; and Julian Schwartz, a
sophomore, were elected into the
graduate, undergraduate and at-large
positions on the committee respec
tively.
"There are two problems with the
committee. First, it's extremely
politicized which presents an obnoxi
ous picture to undergraduates," said
Price, the only graduate nominee for
the graduate position on the commit
tee.
"The second is that it's totally
closed," Price continued. He said
criteria for choosing nominees to serve
on ASSU committees were not stated
and that when presenting the list of
approved nominees to the Senate, it

was presented with an "if you don't
like it, lump it" attitude.
Howard said, "We've got to get
people who want to work hard." He
said he saw another important respon
sibility of the committee in "letting
you guys (the Senate) know what's
going on."
Schwartz said the "failure to pub
licize such things as searches for
nominees for various committees" was
a major problem. He also saw the
committee as a "proper go-between"
between the administration and thes
tudents.
COP report
Three members of the Council of
Presidents (COP), Lee Rosenbaum.
Josie Jaramillo and Charlotte Ger
maine, made their first appearance at a
Senate meeting since Dec. H last night
when they gave their COP report. COP
member Dave Calligan, chairman of
the Nominations Committee, was ab
sent.
Jaramillo reported she gave a speech
on the history of minority students at
Stanford at the last Board of Trustees
meeting on Dec. 9.
Charlotte Germaine announced a
meeting for women students on ser
vices that are available at the Univer
sity to take place Wed., Jan. 28, in Tre
sidder small lounge from 7-9 p.m. Rep
resentatives from the Affirmative Ac
tion and Dean of Student Affairs Of
fices will be present.
Sen. Bob Ottilie protested the lack of
communication between the Senate
and the COP.
"No one seems to know what they're
doing. The Senate should keep a check
on them," said Ottilie during the
COP's committee report.
Staff assistants
Ottilie said an example of the COP's
lack of control over its own domain is
exemplified by allowing Mike Kies
chnick, one of two paid ASSU commit
tee staff assistants, to "use his position
to gain access to information that he
would ordinarily not have" in prepar
ing the Howard Report on university
admissions.
"He is politicizing his office. I don't
think it's his position to be investigat
ing." Ottilie said.
The major responsibility of the
committee assistants is to plan orienta
tion programs for new members and
coordinate committee meetings.
ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum re
sponded that the committee staff assis-
tants are paid by the ASSU and are not
the responsibility of the COP, but of
the Senate.
Special events
ASSU Financial Manager Chris
Cline reported that during the upcom
ing bicentennial summer a number of
touring artists and acts should be av
ailable.
"We have to consider extending
(ASSU Special Events Director) Randy
Phillips' contract to the summer," said
Cline. "Agents have to have confi
dence in (entertainment) managers.
The agents will only deal with Randy
Phillips."
Drawing up an extended contract for
Phillips could be worked out by the
Senate Finance Committee "easily"
according to Sen. Carole Houck. "We
just wanted the Senate in agreement
with an extension," she said.
Sen. Bill Tyndall submitted a report
of background information on the tui
tion increase which recommended
"channelling student energy" into
areas such as "increased input into the
budget making process at the de
partmental level."
"There's a feeling (among the ad
ministrators) that we have no place in
making important decisions," said
Tyndall.

"There are two problems with the
committee. First, it's extremely
politicized which presents an obnoxi
ous picture to undergraduates," said
Price, the only graduate nominee for
the graduate position on the commit
tee.
"The second is that it's totally
closed," Price continued. He said
criteria for choosing nominees to serve
on ASSU committees were not stated
and that when presenting the list of
approved nominees to the Senate, it

was presented with an "if you don't
like it, lump it" attitude.
Howard said, "We've got to get
people who want to work hard." He
said he saw another important respon
sibility of the committee in "letting
you guys (the Senate) know what's
going on."
Schwartz said the "failure to pub
licize such things as searches for
nominees for various committees" was
a major problem. He also saw the
committee as a "proper go-between"
between the administration and thes
tudents.
COP report
Three members of the Council of
Presidents (COP), Lee Rosenbaum.
Josie Jaramillo and Charlotte Ger
maine, made their first appearance at a
Senate meeting since Dec. H last night
when they gave their COP report. COP
member Dave Calligan, chairman of
the Nominations Committee, was ab
sent.
Jaramillo reported she gave a speech
on the history of minority students at
Stanford at the last Board of Trustees
meeting on Dec. 9.
Charlotte Germaine announced a
meeting for women students on ser
vices that are available at the Univer
sity to take place Wed., Jan. 28, in Tre
sidder small lounge from 7-9 p.m. Rep
resentatives from the Affirmative Ac
tion and Dean of Student Affairs Of
fices will be present.
Sen. Bob Ottilie protested the lack of
communication between the Senate
and the COP.
"No one seems to know what they're
doing. The Senate should keep a check
on them," said Ottilie during the
COP's committee report.
Staff assistants
Ottilie said an example of the COP's
lack of control over its own domain is
exemplified by allowing Mike Kies
chnick, one of two paid ASSU commit
tee staff assistants, to "use his position
to gain access to information that he
would ordinarily not have" in prepar
ing the Howard Report on university
admissions.
"He is politicizing his office. I don't
think it's his position to be investigat
ing." Ottilie said.
The major responsibility of the
committee assistants is to plan orienta
tion programs for new members and
coordinate committee meetings.
ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum re
sponded that the committee staff assis-
tants are paid by the ASSU and are not
the responsibility of the COP, but of
the Senate.
Special events
ASSU Financial Manager Chris
Cline reported that during the upcom
ing bicentennial summer a number of
touring artists and acts should be av
ailable.
"We have to consider extending
(ASSU Special Events Director) Randy
Phillips' contract to the summer," said
Cline. "Agents have to have confi
dence in (entertainment) managers.
The agents will only deal with Randy
Phillips."
Drawing up an extended contract for
Phillips could be worked out by the
Senate Finance Committee "easily"
according to Sen. Carole Houck. "We
just wanted the Senate in agreement
with an extension," she said.
Sen. Bill Tyndall submitted a report
of background information on the tui
tion increase which recommended
"channelling student energy" into
areas such as "increased input into the
budget making process at the de
partmental level."
"There's a feeling (among the ad
ministrators) that we have no place in
making important decisions," said
Tyndall.
The ASSU Senate elected three new
members to the ASSU Nominations
Committee last night, all of whom de
sire to improve communications bet
ween the committee and the student
body by opening up the committee to
student scrutiny.
The Nominations Committee
chooses all students who eventually
serve on university committees. It
sorts applications, conducts inter
views and makes recommendations
for nominees. Nominees are then ap
proved by the Senate.
Tom "Tuna" Price, a first-year law
student; Dan Howard, a junior major
ing in biology; and Julian Schwartz, a
sophomore, were elected into the
graduate, undergraduate and at-large
positions on the committee respec
tively.
