# LCO lawyers fight for students' rights
## 
### RICK CHRISTIAN 
A foreign student was frustrated with a used car
he had bought. Within two months of buying it, he
had spent over $200 for repair work and the car had
been in the garage six times.
He visited the ASSU Legal Counseling Office
(LCO) for advice. They urged him to file suit for
fraud in repairand prepared a legal outline for him
to use in court. The case, filed in the Small Claims
Court, will soon be set for a hearing.
Another student was troubled when he tried to
get a $50 cleaning deposit back last August. He was
informed that the local apartment complex had
changed owners. The new owner said the old
owner was responsible for the refund. The old
owner said the new owner was responsible for the
refund. Neither would pay.
He filed a complaint withthe LCO.Attorneys and
aides went to work. Within a short time the student
had his money.
These cases are not unusual. In the two years that
the LCO has been operating, more than 1600 stu
dents have sought advice. On the average, five to
six students visit the office each afternoon.
When the idea for a legal counseling office was
first proposed, administrators were afraid that stu
dents would merely come in to rap, according to
Glen Schofield, a member of the policy board
which sets the guidelines for the office. He is one of
four attorneys from a San Jose law firm who staff the
office on week-day afternoons.
Legitimate problems
"Since the doors opened, however, students have
come in with legitimate problems. Each problem is

important to the individual. We do our best to
aid each student in every way we can," Schofield
said.
The problems vary greatly. Most cases are cen
tered around consumer complaints: car repairs, a
bad paint job, shoddy merchandise. Cases of civil
damage — generally involving an auto or bicycle
accident — also come in frequently. Other kinds of
problems involve housing, criminal acts, family
relations and employment.
"Students come in for everything," Schofield
said. "When they first walk through the door, most
want to sue somebody for some reason."
He explained, however, that the LCO could not
afford to get involved with numerous court cases.
"One trial and the preparation involved with it
would take all of our time," he said.
Peter Stone, a third-year law student and an LCO
aide, explaining why the LCO doesn't represent
students in court, said, "The office was established
to provide legal counseling and advice. Since we
are working limited hours on limited funds, we
can't follow the cases into the courtroom. If a case
needs to go to court, we do our best to find proper
counsel for the student involved,"
Fee assessment funding
The office is currently operating on the $1 fee
assessment which all students pay on registration
day. The assessed fee will be received for the fall
and summer quarters this year. With funding of
nearly $20,000 thus provided, the office is open
year-round on week-day afternoons.
The office hastened to point out that the nine law
school aides serve voluntarily for the clinical ex

perience only. They normally sit in with one of the
attorneys when a student seeks consultation.
Stone said that most of their action is restricted to
giving advice, writing "official-looking" letters
and making "official-sounding" phone calls.
"People respond very quickly when they receive
an official-looking letter from an attorney at law,"
he said.
When the LCO was first established in October
1973 Schofield said two basic principles were set:
1) Claims unable to be settled within the $500
limit of theSmall Claims Court would be referred to
outside lawyers. Schofield said the Palo Alto Bar
Association agreed to handle these cases on a
"percentage-cut" basis. Rather than charge a set fee
for the defense of a student, the lawyer would take a
percentage of the court winnings.
2) The office would not handle claims filed
against the University or other students.
Ombudsman's complaints
Complaints against the University are normally
handled by the University Ombudsman, Emeritus
Prof. John Goheen. His office is bombarded by stu
dents with complaints involving subjects as varied
as:
—Professors who are considered poor lecturers:
—parking tickets:
—unfair exams;
Goheen's office reported that students only come
to the ombudsman as a "last-resort" measure. They
still go to the LCO first.
Though more students are passing through for
advice this quarter, Schofield wishes more students
would seek advice.

HELP FOR THE STUDENT—The Legal Counseling Office, located in the Old
Firehouse, has helped over 1600 students in the two years since it has opened,
it is open the year round on weekday afternoons.
A foreign student was frustrated with a used car
he had bought. Within two months of buying it, he
had spent over $200 for repair work and the car had
been in the garage six times.
He visited the ASSU Legal Counseling Office
(LCO) for advice. They urged him to file suit for
fraud in repairand prepared a legal outline for him
to use in court. The case, filed in the Small Claims
Court, will soon be set for a hearing.
Another student was troubled when he tried to
get a $50 cleaning deposit back last August. He was
informed that the local apartment complex had
changed owners. The new owner said the old
owner was responsible for the refund. The old
owner said the new owner was responsible for the
refund. Neither would pay.
He filed a complaint withthe LCO.Attorneys and
aides went to work. Within a short time the student
had his money.
These cases are not unusual. In the two years that
the LCO has been operating, more than 1600 stu
dents have sought advice. On the average, five to
six students visit the office each afternoon.
When the idea for a legal counseling office was
first proposed, administrators were afraid that stu
dents would merely come in to rap, according to
Glen Schofield, a member of the policy board
which sets the guidelines for the office. He is one of
four attorneys from a San Jose law firm who staff the
office on week-day afternoons.
Legitimate problems
"Since the doors opened, however, students have
come in with legitimate problems. Each problem is

important to the individual. We do our best to
aid each student in every way we can," Schofield
said.
The problems vary greatly. Most cases are cen
tered around consumer complaints: car repairs, a
bad paint job, shoddy merchandise. Cases of civil
damage — generally involving an auto or bicycle
accident — also come in frequently. Other kinds of
problems involve housing, criminal acts, family
relations and employment.
"Students come in for everything," Schofield
said. "When they first walk through the door, most
want to sue somebody for some reason."
He explained, however, that the LCO could not
afford to get involved with numerous court cases.
"One trial and the preparation involved with it
would take all of our time," he said.
Peter Stone, a third-year law student and an LCO
aide, explaining why the LCO doesn't represent
students in court, said, "The office was established
to provide legal counseling and advice. Since we
are working limited hours on limited funds, we
can't follow the cases into the courtroom. If a case
needs to go to court, we do our best to find proper
counsel for the student involved,"
Fee assessment funding
The office is currently operating on the $1 fee
assessment which all students pay on registration
day. The assessed fee will be received for the fall
and summer quarters this year. With funding of
nearly $20,000 thus provided, the office is open
year-round on week-day afternoons.
The office hastened to point out that the nine law
school aides serve voluntarily for the clinical ex

perience only. They normally sit in with one of the
attorneys when a student seeks consultation.
Stone said that most of their action is restricted to
giving advice, writing "official-looking" letters
and making "official-sounding" phone calls.
"People respond very quickly when they receive
an official-looking letter from an attorney at law,"
he said.
When the LCO was first established in October
1973 Schofield said two basic principles were set:
1) Claims unable to be settled within the $500
limit of theSmall Claims Court would be referred to
outside lawyers. Schofield said the Palo Alto Bar
Association agreed to handle these cases on a
"percentage-cut" basis. Rather than charge a set fee
for the defense of a student, the lawyer would take a
percentage of the court winnings.
2) The office would not handle claims filed
against the University or other students.
Ombudsman's complaints
Complaints against the University are normally
handled by the University Ombudsman, Emeritus
Prof. John Goheen. His office is bombarded by stu
dents with complaints involving subjects as varied
as:
—Professors who are considered poor lecturers:
—parking tickets:
—unfair exams;
Goheen's office reported that students only come
to the ombudsman as a "last-resort" measure. They
still go to the LCO first.

Association agreed to handle these cases on a
"percentage-cut" basis. Rather than charge a set fee
for the defense of a student, the lawyer would take a
percentage of the court winnings.

against the University or other students.
Ombudsman's complaints
Complaints against the University are normally
handled by the University Ombudsman, Emeritus
Prof. John Goheen. His office is bombarded by stu
dents with complaints involving subjects as varied
as:
—Professors who are considered poor lecturers:
—parking tickets:
—unfair exams;
Goheen's office reported that students only come
to the ombudsman as a "last-resort" measure. They
still go to the LCO first.
Though more students are passing through for
advice this quarter, Schofield wishes more students
would seek advice.
