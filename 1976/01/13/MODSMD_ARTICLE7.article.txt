# U.S. crime wave

Among the many diverse
problems facing our nation as it
enters its 200 th year,
crime is by far the most alarming
and pressing.
Despite a vast increase in
anti-crime spending and expan
sion of police forces, serious
crimes went up 17 percent in
1974, to a record total of more
than 10 million. The official na
tional crime rate has tripled in
the last 15 years, and surveys in
dicate that fewer than half the
crimes committed are reported
to the police.
A variety of reasons have been
cited to explain these shocking
trends.
City governments have been
blamed for maintaining in
adequate or understaffed police
forces. Private citizens have
been accused of not taking pre
cautions to deter criminal ac
tions against their homes and
personal belongings.
Insufficient funds
Budget planners have been
criticized for failing to allocate
sufficient funds for crime pre
vention measures. And the pub
lic has been cited for its failure to
report many crimes or to testify
against the responsible crimi
nals.
Although each of these factors
undoubtedly contributes some
what to the gravity of the situa
tion, the heart of the crime prob
lem lies in our judicial system,
which in its present form does
not function as an adequate
crime deterrent. From the outset,
a guilty suspect is always "inno
cent until proven otherwise," a
task which inevitably is easier
said than done.
Even if sufficient evidence
against a defendent is present,
his lawyers can resort to evasive
tactics such as the insanity plea
or claims of pre-trial publicity.
At the same time, long delays are
introduced into the trial pro
ceedings; these delays only

serve to benefit the defendant
and to deplete the taxpayer's
wallet.
If, after all of this, the defen
dant is found guilty by the jury,
he can expect at worst a sentence
of life imprisonment. Although
an apparently harsh punish
ment, chances are good within a
few years he will be roaming the
streets on parole.
Such a system of justice is
hardly likely to provoke second
thoughts in an individual who
contemplates committing a
crime.
Curbing crime
Clearly, the first step in curb
ing crime is imposition of
tougher sentences by judges.
Such action has already been
taken by an Oakland-based or
ganization known as Citizens for
Law and Order (CLO), which
now has some 2500 members in'
197 cities.
CLO maintains that "soft
judges make hardened crimi
nals." It keeps watch on courts to
spot and seek action against
judges who are soft on crime.
In addition, measures must be
taken to speed the judicial pro
cess and to eliminate defense
tactics which are employed in
the interest of winning a case
rather than in the interest of jus
tice. Finally, we as a nation need
to reform our overly
humanitarian philosophy to
ward the criminal, for leniency
will only inspire followers.
Despite the harsh reality of the
crime problem, there are still
those who advocate criminal re
habilitation and who argue that
"two wrongs do not make a
right." While the latter is a point
well taken, it is nevertheless a
naive and idealistic assumption
in view of the facts at hand.
Friends and relatives of a mur
der victi m are perhaps in a better
position to make a realistic de
finition of justice.
