# Undergrad dean
## Lang, et al. 
### 
Every Stanford undergraduate
is urged to attend tonight's open
ing meeting of the search com
mittee for the vice provost and
]dean of undergraduate studies.
It is imperative students
utilize this opportunity to voice
their concern for the qualifica
tions and selection criteria
which will best insure the new
dean of undergraduate studies
will be a strong advocate for un
dergraduate education within
the highest councils of the IJni
. versity.
Never before has the dean of
undergraduate studies been reg
ularly included as a member of
the provost's central staff. This
relocation (and concomitant re
structuring) of the Office of the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
(ODUS) was proposed last year
by the Committee on Under
graduate Studies (C-US) as a
means whereby the dean could
exert a more consistent and sig
nificant impact on the allocation
of funds in the service of under
graduate education.
Several functions
In its proposal, C-US outlined
several functions of ODUS as of
"great importance":
—responsibility for the un
dergraduate advising program
and its continual upgrading;
—representation of under
graduate interests to the various
schools;
—accessibility to students in
matters of undergraduate educa
tion;
—strengthening of the em
phasis on high quality teaching;
and
—facilitation of the estab-

lishment of desirable innova
tive programs which cross de
partmental or school bound
aries.
This perception of the office is
not as significant to future struc
ture and direction of ODUS as
will be the personality and goals
of the next individual to assume
the post. The joint position of
vice provost and dean does not
insure the existence of a "focus
for innovation" in under
graduate education.
Occupant's priorities
Although potentially a posi
tion of great influence within the
University structure, the dean
ship can only reflect the
priorities of its occupant.
The Search Committee must
develop a list of candidates to
present to the provost by the end
of February. For this reason, it is
essential all who wish to see a
strong advocate of innovation in
education as dean of under
graduate studies submit sub
stantiated nominations of qual
ified faculty members as soon as
possible.
Nomination forms will be av
ailable at tonight's meeting. If
there are further questions re
garding the search for the new
vice provost and dean, please
cqll us.
Make your voice heard! Reaf
firm your support for high qual
ity teaching, advising and inno
vation in undergraduate educa
tion.

of the next individual to assume
the post. The joint position of
vice provost and dean does not
insure the existence of a "focus
for innovation" in under
graduate education.
Occupant's priorities
Although potentially a posi
tion of great influence within the
University structure, the dean
ship can only reflect the
priorities of its occupant.
The Search Committee must
develop a list of candidates to
present to the provost by the end
of February. For this reason, it is
essential all who wish to see a
strong advocate of innovation in
education as dean of under
graduate studies submit sub
stantiated nominations of qual
ified faculty members as soon as
possible.
Nomination forms will be av
ailable at tonight's meeting. If
there are further questions re
garding the search for the new
vice provost and dean, please
cqll us.
Make your voice heard! Reaf
firm your support for high qual
ity teaching, advising and inno
vation in undergraduate educa
tion.

Every Stanford undergraduate
is urged to attend tonight's open
ing meeting of the search com
mittee for the vice provost and
]dean of undergraduate studies.
It is imperative students
utilize this opportunity to voice
their concern for the qualifica
tions and selection criteria
which will best insure the new
dean of undergraduate studies
will be a strong advocate for un
dergraduate education within
the highest councils of the IJni
. versity.
Never before has the dean of
undergraduate studies been reg
ularly included as a member of
the provost's central staff. This
relocation (and concomitant re
structuring) of the Office of the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
(ODUS) was proposed last year
by the Committee on Under
graduate Studies (C-US) as a
means whereby the dean could
exert a more consistent and sig
nificant impact on the allocation
of funds in the service of under
graduate education.
Several functions
In its proposal, C-US outlined
several functions of ODUS as of
"great importance":
—responsibility for the un
dergraduate advising program
and its continual upgrading;
—representation of under
graduate interests to the various
schools;
—accessibility to students in
matters of undergraduate educa
tion;
—strengthening of the em
phasis on high quality teaching;
and
—facilitation of the estab-

lishment of desirable innova
tive programs which cross de
partmental or school bound
aries.
This perception of the office is
not as significant to future struc
ture and direction of ODUS as
will be the personality and goals
of the next individual to assume
the post. The joint position of
vice provost and dean does not
insure the existence of a "focus
for innovation" in under
graduate education.
