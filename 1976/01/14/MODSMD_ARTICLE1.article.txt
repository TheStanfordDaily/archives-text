# 'Coed feminist' among proposed house themes
## 
### STEPHEN CROLIUS 
Eight proposals for new under
graduate residence programs ranging
from an all-transfer house to a "coed
feminist dorm" have been received by
the Office of Residential Education,
according to Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Larry Horton.
Horton said a special advisory
committee to his office is now evaluat
ing the proposals. The 12-member
committee is composed of representa
tives from the Committee on Services
to Students (COSS), the faculty, the
administration and the University
Housing and Food Services Offices.
"We're moving quickly," Horton
said yesterday. "... but because the
committee has not finished with the

proposals, 1 cannot say anything ex
cept that the committee is still de
liberating."
Seven of the eight proposals center
on the establishment of various sorts of
'theme' houses, such as the French
House or the several ethnic group cul
tural centers.
Jewish house
A proposal for a Jewish cultural
theme house, modeled after the black,
chicano and Asian American theme
houses was submitted by a group of
students and faculty. The residence
would be open to upperclass men and
women having an interest in "Jewish
culture, with Jewish students given
priority.
An Italian theme house similar in

purpose and design to the French
House would offer films and seminars
on Italian language and culture, as
well as provide an opportunity to learn
to speak or practice speaking Italian.
Separate proposals for American
studies and urban studies theme
houses both speak of the benefits that
may be derived when individuals
sharing a common interest live to
gether.
The authors of a proposal for a music
theme house desires to provide an at
mosphere conducive to musical en
deavor and to alleviate the shortage of
practice and recital rooms on campus.
Foster 'world view'
Two undergraduates, Robert Mar
sho and Jan Bernie, have proposed that
a residence be established in conjunc
tion with the World Analysis Center,
an organization dedicated to fostering
a "world view" through developing an
understanding of the global processes
related to quality of human life.
Finally, a group of men and women
has proposed a coed feminist resi
dence, to be called "Androgyne." The
group wishes to bring together a group
of students interested in feminist is
sues, and defines such issues as those
of traditional male and female sex
roles as being detrimental to the indi
vidual.
The only proposal that does not
come directly under the heading of a
theme house, suggests that a residence
composed solely of transfer students
be established. The purpose of the
house would be to help transfer stu
dents adjust academical ly and socially
to Stanford.

from an all-transfer house to a "coed
feminist dorm" have been received by
the Office of Residential Education,
according to Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Larry Horton.
Horton said a special advisory
committee to his office is now evaluat
ing the proposals. The 12-member
committee is composed of representa
tives from the Committee on Services
to Students (COSS), the faculty, the
administration and the University
Housing and Food Services Offices.
"We're moving quickly," Horton
said yesterday. "... but because the
committee has not finished with the

proposals, 1 cannot say anything ex
cept that the committee is still de
liberating."
Seven of the eight proposals center
on the establishment of various sorts of
'theme' houses, such as the French
House or the several ethnic group cul
tural centers.
Jewish house
A proposal for a Jewish cultural
theme house, modeled after the black,
chicano and Asian American theme
houses was submitted by a group of
students and faculty. The residence
would be open to upperclass men and
women having an interest in "Jewish
culture, with Jewish students given
priority.
An Italian theme house similar in

purpose and design to the French
House would offer films and seminars
on Italian language and culture, as
well as provide an opportunity to learn
to speak or practice speaking Italian.
Separate proposals for American
studies and urban studies theme
houses both speak of the benefits that
may be derived when individuals
sharing a common interest live to
gether.
The authors of a proposal for a music
theme house desires to provide an at
mosphere conducive to musical en
deavor and to alleviate the shortage of
practice and recital rooms on campus.
Foster 'world view'
Two undergraduates, Robert Mar
sho and Jan Bernie, have proposed that
a residence be established in conjunc
tion with the World Analysis Center,
an organization dedicated to fostering
a "world view" through developing an
understanding of the global processes
related to quality of human life.
Finally, a group of men and women
has proposed a coed feminist resi
dence, to be called "Androgyne." The
group wishes to bring together a group
of students interested in feminist is
sues, and defines such issues as those
of traditional male and female sex
roles as being detrimental to the indi
vidual.
The only proposal that does not
come directly under the heading of a
theme house, suggests that a residence
composed solely of transfer students
be established. The purpose of the
house would be to help transfer stu
dents adjust academical ly and socially
to Stanford.
