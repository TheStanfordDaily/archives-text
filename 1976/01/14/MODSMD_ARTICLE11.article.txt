# Blacks don't 'have it made'
## 
### 
An apparently well-meaning, but obvi
ously misguided, friend told me recently
that I — meaning black people — "have it
made" in the United States today.
He said I can write my own ticket, as the
phrase goes — that the only person with a
better chance of landing a job is a chicano
woman. He asked how I could possibly
complain about the way things are now.
Funny heshould askthat now. Tomorrow
we celebrate the birthday of Martin Luther
King. King, although certainly not a saint
(the Federal Bureau of Investigation saw
that we knew that), was something rare in
history at any time. He was a leader, a pow
erful and persuasive one, a man ready, in
Bobby Seale's fine phrase, to "seize the
time."
There have, of course, been other such
men in history, most of whose birthdates are
long forgotten. Some, such as Nat Turner,
later become martyred — as did King. Some,
such as W.E.B. Dußois, never received
much-deserved recognition from a hostile
white power structure.
White support
Others, such as Booker Washington,
gained almost their entire power base from
the support of white philanthropists,
power-brokers somewhat hesitant about let
ting black people choose their own "lead
ers."
A still hostile, white-controlled federal
government today seems no less hesitant.
The highest ranking black official in
Washington, William Coleman, brings with
him all the prerequisites of office: he
worked for the firm which did Nelson Roc
kefeller's accounting. Such a position
seems the only ticket to legitimacy.
Less legitimate rulers are then forced to
work from without (by definition), and are
objects of scorn, or ridicule — or sabotage.
Martin Luther King was nearly sabotaged
by the federal government, and some con
tend, not without reason, that that heavy

hand brought about his tragic death as well.
Even in "this day and age," it seems,
black people have to be kept down — so the
FBI did what it could to keep the Nobel
Peace Prize, a sign of legitimacy, out of
King's hands. Anonymous letters suggest
ing suicide, incriminating tapes mailed to
his wife Coretta — why not? The people
involved were only black, after all.

Others, seeing past the kindly veneer of
officialdom, challenged the power of this
hostile government. But they were dismis
sed as radicals and "militants" — whatever
those are. The various members of the press,
curiously unsympathetic, helped build
these images of wanton murder, looting,
and what-have-you.
(Which is not to say such people were
non-violent; only that their violence took on
a peculiar and unique struggle in the popu
lar mind, with no one seriously analyzing
motives.)
After King's assassination in 1968, white
America was swept with a wave of guilt. Or
perhaps it was fear of rioting and looting.
The fears, however, were groundless, as
black rioters, conscious of societal mores,
generally limited destruction to their own
areas.
Nebulous ideas
Anyway, we beganito hear more and more
of nebulous,concepts such as "affirmative
action." Which is, to a materialistic society,
why we "have it made."
If everything is to be measured in terms of

jobs and money ("Well, that's the way it's
measured," my friend quickly replied),
there is something to this. The well
educated black person has some advantage
in seeking jobs, all other things being
(reasonably) equal.
Of course, there are flaws. Most blacks are
not so well-educated, and many still live in
squalid urban conditions. Moreover, there
is a certain need for some advantage granted
by society in order to close a society-created
gap
(This may, of course, be debated
philosophically. Perhaps some readers will
send in suggestions of other ways to close
the gap. But they mqst keep in mind that
merely placing Y on equal footing with Z, if
Z already has a lead, will not close the gap.
That's like giving one miler an 800-yard
lead over another of equal skill.)
Realistic criterion?
If that is not enough, one may always
question whether the ability to "get a job" is
a realistic criterion for "having it made."
One of my earlier memories vis a vis ra
cial consciousness is sitting down next to a
white man on a bus in Washington, D.C. and
being punched in the ribs for my trouble.
One of my latest is sitting in a bus last
December going to Mountain View, when,
although the only seat left vacant was next
to me, an elderly white woman with pac
kages glanced at it, but remained standing.
This does not even consider having Na
tional Guardsmen point rifles at me during
19G8 as I walked to the bus stop to go to
school, or having a bottle full of Coca-Cola
tossed at me from a passing car as I walked
along a road this summer.
But people like my friend continue with
the same nonsensical belief that in what is
still a white man's country, we've finally got
it made.

Bobby Seale's fine phrase, to "seize the
time."
There have, of course, been other such
men in history, most of whose birthdates are
long forgotten. Some, such as Nat Turner,
later become martyred — as did King. Some,
such as W.E.B. Dußois, never received
much-deserved recognition from a hostile
white power structure.
White support
Others, such as Booker Washington,
gained almost their entire power base from
the support of white philanthropists,
power-brokers somewhat hesitant about let
ting black people choose their own "lead
ers."
A still hostile, white-controlled federal
government today seems no less hesitant.
The highest ranking black official in
Washington, William Coleman, brings with
him all the prerequisites of office: he
worked for the firm which did Nelson Roc
kefeller's accounting. Such a position
seems the only ticket to legitimacy.
Less legitimate rulers are then forced to
work from without (by definition), and are
objects of scorn, or ridicule — or sabotage.
Martin Luther King was nearly sabotaged
by the federal government, and some con
tend, not without reason, that that heavy

hand brought about his tragic death as well.
Even in "this day and age," it seems,
black people have to be kept down — so the
FBI did what it could to keep the Nobel
Peace Prize, a sign of legitimacy, out of
King's hands. Anonymous letters suggest
ing suicide, incriminating tapes mailed to
his wife Coretta — why not? The people
involved were only black, after all.

Others, seeing past the kindly veneer of
officialdom, challenged the power of this
hostile government. But they were dismis
sed as radicals and "militants" — whatever
those are. The various members of the press,
curiously unsympathetic, helped build
these images of wanton murder, looting,
and what-have-you.
(Which is not to say such people were
non-violent; only that their violence took on
a peculiar and unique struggle in the popu
lar mind, with no one seriously analyzing
motives.)
After King's assassination in 1968, white
America was swept with a wave of guilt. Or
perhaps it was fear of rioting and looting.
The fears, however, were groundless, as
black rioters, conscious of societal mores,
generally limited destruction to their own
areas.
Nebulous ideas
Anyway, we beganito hear more and more
of nebulous,concepts such as "affirmative
action." Which is, to a materialistic society,
why we "have it made."
If everything is to be measured in terms of

jobs and money ("Well, that's the way it's
measured," my friend quickly replied),
there is something to this. The well
educated black person has some advantage
in seeking jobs, all other things being
(reasonably) equal.
Of course, there are flaws. Most blacks are
not so well-educated, and many still live in
squalid urban conditions. Moreover, there
is a certain need for some advantage granted
by society in order to close a society-created
gap
(This may, of course, be debated
philosophically. Perhaps some readers will
send in suggestions of other ways to close
the gap. But they mqst keep in mind that
merely placing Y on equal footing with Z, if
Z already has a lead, will not close the gap.
That's like giving one miler an 800-yard
lead over another of equal skill.)
Realistic criterion?
If that is not enough, one may always
question whether the ability to "get a job" is
a realistic criterion for "having it made."
One of my earlier memories vis a vis ra
cial consciousness is sitting down next to a
white man on a bus in Washington, D.C. and
being punched in the ribs for my trouble.
One of my latest is sitting in a bus last
December going to Mountain View, when,
although the only seat left vacant was next
to me, an elderly white woman with pac
kages glanced at it, but remained standing.
This does not even consider having Na
tional Guardsmen point rifles at me during
19G8 as I walked to the bus stop to go to
school, or having a bottle full of Coca-Cola
tossed at me from a passing car as I walked
along a road this summer.
But people like my friend continue with
the same nonsensical belief that in what is
still a white man's country, we've finally got
it made.

An apparently well-meaning, but obvi
ously misguided, friend told me recently
that I — meaning black people — "have it
made" in the United States today.
He said I can write my own ticket, as the
phrase goes — that the only person with a
better chance of landing a job is a chicano
woman. He asked how I could possibly
complain about the way things are now.
Funny heshould askthat now. Tomorrow
we celebrate the birthday of Martin Luther
King. King, although certainly not a saint
(the Federal Bureau of Investigation saw
that we knew that), was something rare in
history at any time. He was a leader, a pow

Bobby Seale's fine phrase, to "seize the

The highest ranking black official in
Washington, William Coleman, brings with
him all the prerequisites of office: he
worked for the firm which did Nelson Roc
kefeller's accounting. Such a position
seems the only ticket to legitimacy.
Less legitimate rulers are then forced to
work from without (by definition), and are
objects of scorn, or ridicule — or sabotage.
Martin Luther King was nearly sabotaged
by the federal government, and some con
tend, not without reason, that that heavy

hand brought about his tragic death as well.
Even in "this day and age," it seems,
black people have to be kept down — so the
FBI did what it could to keep the Nobel
Peace Prize, a sign of legitimacy, out of
King's hands. Anonymous letters suggest
ing suicide, incriminating tapes mailed to
his wife Coretta — why not? The people
involved were only black, after all.

Others, seeing past the kindly veneer of
officialdom, challenged the power of this
hostile government. But they were dismis
sed as radicals and "militants" — whatever
those are. The various members of the press,
curiously unsympathetic, helped build
these images of wanton murder, looting,
and what-have-you.
(Which is not to say such people were
non-violent; only that their violence took on
a peculiar and unique struggle in the popu
lar mind, with no one seriously analyzing
motives.)
After King's assassination in 1968, white
America was swept with a wave of guilt. Or
perhaps it was fear of rioting and looting.
The fears, however, were groundless, as
black rioters, conscious of societal mores,
generally limited destruction to their own
areas.
Nebulous ideas
Anyway, we beganito hear more and more
of nebulous,concepts such as "affirmative
action." Which is, to a materialistic society,
why we "have it made."
If everything is to be measured in terms of

jobs and money ("Well, that's the way it's
measured," my friend quickly replied),
there is something to this. The well
educated black person has some advantage
in seeking jobs, all other things being
(reasonably) equal.
Of course, there are flaws. Most blacks are
not so well-educated, and many still live in
squalid urban conditions. Moreover, there
is a certain need for some advantage granted
by society in order to close a society-created
gap
(This may, of course, be debated
philosophically. Perhaps some readers will
send in suggestions of other ways to close
the gap. But they mqst keep in mind that
merely placing Y on equal footing with Z, if
Z already has a lead, will not close the gap.
That's like giving one miler an 800-yard
lead over another of equal skill.)
Realistic criterion?
If that is not enough, one may always
question whether the ability to "get a job" is
a realistic criterion for "having it made."
One of my earlier memories vis a vis ra
cial consciousness is sitting down next to a
white man on a bus in Washington, D.C. and
being punched in the ribs for my trouble.
One of my latest is sitting in a bus last
December going to Mountain View, when,
although the only seat left vacant was next
to me, an elderly white woman with pac
kages glanced at it, but remained standing.
This does not even consider having Na
tional Guardsmen point rifles at me during
19G8 as I walked to the bus stop to go to
school, or having a bottle full of Coca-Cola
tossed at me from a passing car as I walked
along a road this summer.
But people like my friend continue with
the same nonsensical belief that in what is
still a white man's country, we've finally got
it made.

An apparently well-meaning, but obvi
ously misguided, friend told me recently
that I — meaning black people — "have it
made" in the United States today.
He said I can write my own ticket, as the
phrase goes — that the only person with a
better chance of landing a job is a chicano
woman. He asked how I could possibly
complain about the way things are now.
Funny heshould askthat now. Tomorrow
we celebrate the birthday of Martin Luther
King. King, although certainly not a saint
(the Federal Bureau of Investigation saw
that we knew that), was something rare in
history at any time. He was a leader, a pow
erful and persuasive one, a man ready, in
Bobby Seale's fine phrase, to "seize the
time."
There have, of course, been other such
men in history, most of whose birthdates are
long forgotten. Some, such as Nat Turner,
later become martyred — as did King. Some,
such as W.E.B. Dußois, never received
much-deserved recognition from a hostile
white power structure.
White support
Others, such as Booker Washington,
gained almost their entire power base from
the support of white philanthropists,
power-brokers somewhat hesitant about let
ting black people choose their own "lead
ers."
