# Angola is not another Vietnam
## 
### 
Over the past few weeks the
New York Times, the Christian
Science Monitor and even the
San Francisco Chronicle have
been replete with articles con
cerning Angola.
Many of the articles support a
view that the United States, like
one of Pavlov's dogs, has found
the scent of another Vietnam and
cannot resist the temptation of
intervention (previous rein
forcements having been so
pleasant).
These articles rely on the ob
vious similarities that Angola
has to Vietnam — e.g. interven
ing in a civil war in a distant
land, doing so to allow people to
choose for themselves.
There are more important
similarities that lie within the
comparison of the Ford Ad
ministration and the other ad
ministrations that handled Viet
nam.
The following tactics are those
that the Ford Administration
presently employs that are dis
tinctly reminiscient of Vietnam,
and, hence, give credence to the
comparison:
The promise of limited in
volvement. President Ford has
said through one of his spokes
men, William Greener, that
"there are no parallels between
Vietnam and Angola. We do not
have nor contemplate sending
military or non-military advisors
to Angola. We have no exploita
tive intention in Angola, nor do
we contemplate any U.S. combat
intervention there."
Couple this statement with the
President's request that aid is
needed in Angola "in view of ac
tions taken by the Soviet Union
and Cuba in providing large

quantities of military and men in
Angola."
We are basing our "limited"
aid in direct proportion to how
"limited" aid is to the Soviet
backed Popular Movement for
the Liberation of Angola
(MPLA).
As the Christian Science
Monitor records, Sceretary of
State Henry Kissinger is even
more explicit: "If we do not meet
the Russian challenge now at
modest cost we will find it
necessary to do so further down
the road when it will be more
■costly and dangerous."
A distortion of the real situa
tion. Vietnam was a
presidentially-controlled con
flict. The report that the Con
gress and the public heard was
the report that the respective
presidencies wanted them to
hear.
This offense of misrepresenta
tion is becoming increasingly
blatant in the Angolan conflict.
Not only has the CIA supplied
massive covert funds through
the Zaire and Zambian govern
ments. but many of the weapons
appropriated overtly have been
incorrectly recorded.
Sen. Lowell Weicker (R-Conn.)
dove a little deeper into Ad
ministration claims that one of
their deliveries of weapons total -
led $10 million in equipment.
Strangely enough, the shipping
bill for the $10 million in
weapons came to an astronomi
cally high sum of $5 million. -
Upon viewing the estimated
values of the equipment on the
military inventory list, Weicker
found that all weapons were
priced at far less than their real
value. A .45 caliber pistol was

listed at $5. Thus, we really don't
know how much the Administ
ration is sending even when it
gives a report.
The threat of an "Executive
branch" war. Vietnam was
plagued by American Presidents
and Cabinet members who ran a
war without listening to the
sound counsel of subordinates
who were experts in Southeast
Asian affairs.
General after general (particu
larly Maxwell Taylor and Paul
Harkins) were placed in com
mand because they not only tolli
the administration what it
wanted to hear, but also carried
out presidential plans wi-th a
blind disavowal of Vietnam's
bitter realities.
Kissinger has already set a
similar tone to the Angolan af
fair. Nathaniel Davis, the assis
tant secretary of state in charge
of the Bureau of African Affairs,
suddenly found himself throw
ing snowballs in Zurich as the
American Ambassador to Swit
zerland.
Yet, despite all the similarities
there is a basic difference bet
ween the two that alters the en
tire complexion of the Angolan
issue. That difference is that
both the Senate and the Ameri
can public are becoming in
volved in our dealings with An
gola at an early stage.
In Angola, after a few short
months of Executive control, the
Senate has entered the battle. On
Dec. 19, an amendment spon
sored by Sen. John Tunney (D-
Calif.) and prohibiting the ex
penditure of funds in Angola for
military or para-military activ
ity, passed by an overwhelming
58-22 vote.

This voice is significant, and
hopefully will prove decisive. It
shows an early awareness that
was never present in Vietnam. It
precludes the possibility of an
executive branch-sponsored
war.
However, the awareness itself
places a responsibility on the
Congress and the public. Unlike
Vietnam, we are in this one from
the beginning. If war is escalated
by the U.S. in Angola, it will be
our escalation, not just that of a
Pavlovian Presidency.

We are basing our "limited"
aid in direct proportion to how
"limited" aid is to the Soviet
backed Popular Movement for
the Liberation of Angola
(MPLA).
As the Christian Science
Monitor records, Sceretary of
State Henry Kissinger is even
more explicit: "If we do not meet
the Russian challenge now at
modest cost we will find it

A distortion of the real situa
tion. Vietnam was a
presidentially-controlled con
flict. The report that the Con
gress and the public heard was
the report that the respective
presidencies wanted them to
hear.
This offense of misrepresenta
tion is becoming increasingly
blatant in the Angolan conflict.
Not only has the CIA supplied
massive covert funds through
the Zaire and Zambian govern
ments. but many of the weapons
appropriated overtly have been
incorrectly recorded.
Sen. Lowell Weicker (R-Conn.)
dove a little deeper into Ad
ministration claims that one of
their deliveries of weapons total -
led $10 million in equipment.
Strangely enough, the shipping
bill for the $10 million in
weapons came to an astronomi
cally high sum of $5 million. -
Upon viewing the estimated
values of the equipment on the
military inventory list, Weicker
found that all weapons were
priced at far less than their real
value. A .45 caliber pistol was

listed at $5. Thus, we really don't
know how much the Administ
ration is sending even when it
gives a report.
The threat of an "Executive
branch" war. Vietnam was
plagued by American Presidents
and Cabinet members who ran a
war without listening to the
sound counsel of subordinates
who were experts in Southeast
Asian affairs.
General after general (particu
larly Maxwell Taylor and Paul
Harkins) were placed in com
mand because they not only tolli
the administration what it
wanted to hear, but also carried
out presidential plans wi-th a
blind disavowal of Vietnam's
bitter realities.
Kissinger has already set a
similar tone to the Angolan af
fair. Nathaniel Davis, the assis
tant secretary of state in charge
of the Bureau of African Affairs,
suddenly found himself throw
ing snowballs in Zurich as the
American Ambassador to Swit
zerland.
Yet, despite all the similarities
there is a basic difference bet
ween the two that alters the en
tire complexion of the Angolan
issue. That difference is that
both the Senate and the Ameri
can public are becoming in

gola at an early stage.
In Angola, after a few short
months of Executive control, the
Senate has entered the battle. On
Dec. 19, an amendment spon
sored by Sen. John Tunney (D-
Calif.) and prohibiting the ex

military or para-military activ
ity, passed by an overwhelming
58-22 vote.

This voice is significant, and
hopefully will prove decisive. It
shows an early awareness that
was never present in Vietnam. It
precludes the possibility of an
executive branch-sponsored
war.
However, the awareness itself
places a responsibility on the
Congress and the public. Unlike
Vietnam, we are in this one from
the beginning. If war is escalated
by the U.S. in Angola, it will be
our escalation, not just that of a
Pavlovian Presidency.

Over the past few weeks the
New York Times, the Christian
Science Monitor and even the
San Francisco Chronicle have
been replete with articles con
cerning Angola.
Many of the articles support a
view that the United States, like
one of Pavlov's dogs, has found
the scent of another Vietnam and
cannot resist the temptation of
intervention (previous rein
forcements having been so
pleasant).
These articles rely on the ob
vious similarities that Angola
has to Vietnam — e.g. interven
ing in a civil war in a distant
land, doing so to allow people to
choose for themselves.
There are more important
similarities that lie within the
comparison of the Ford Ad
ministration and the other ad
ministrations that handled Viet
nam.
The following tactics are those
that the Ford Administration
presently employs that are dis
tinctly reminiscient of Vietnam,
and, hence, give credence to the
comparison:
The promise of limited in
volvement. President Ford has
said through one of his spokes
men, William Greener, that
"there are no parallels between
Vietnam and Angola. We do not
have nor contemplate sending
military or non-military advisors
to Angola. We have no exploita
tive intention in Angola, nor do
we contemplate any U.S. combat
intervention there."
Couple this statement with the
President's request that aid is
needed in Angola "in view of ac
tions taken by the Soviet Union
and Cuba in providing large

quantities of military and men in
Angola."

aid in direct proportion to how

The threat of an "Executive

plagued by American Presidents
and Cabinet members who ran a
war without listening to the
sound counsel of subordinates

Asian affairs.
General after general (particu

Harkins) were placed in com
mand because they not only tolli
the administration what it
wanted to hear, but also carried
out presidential plans wi-th a

bitter realities.
Kissinger has already set a
similar tone to the Angolan af

This voice is significant, and
hopefully will prove decisive. It
shows an early awareness that
was never present in Vietnam. It
precludes the possibility of an
executive branch-sponsored
war.
However, the awareness itself
places a responsibility on the
Congress and the public. Unlike
Vietnam, we are in this one from
the beginning. If war is escalated
by the U.S. in Angola, it will be
our escalation, not just that of a
Pavlovian Presidency.

Over the past few weeks the
New York Times, the Christian
Science Monitor and even the
San Francisco Chronicle have
been replete with articles con
cerning Angola.
Many of the articles support a
view that the United States, like
one of Pavlov's dogs, has found
the scent of another Vietnam and
cannot resist the temptation of
intervention (previous rein
forcements having been so
pleasant).
These articles rely on the ob
vious similarities that Angola
has to Vietnam — e.g. interven
ing in a civil war in a distant
land, doing so to allow people to
choose for themselves.
There are more important
similarities that lie within the
comparison of the Ford Ad
ministration and the other ad
ministrations that handled Viet
nam.
The following tactics are those
that the Ford Administration
presently employs that are dis
tinctly reminiscient of Vietnam,
and, hence, give credence to the
comparison:
The promise of limited in
volvement. President Ford has
said through one of his spokes
men, William Greener, that
"there are no parallels between
Vietnam and Angola. We do not
have nor contemplate sending
military or non-military advisors
to Angola. We have no exploita
tive intention in Angola, nor do
we contemplate any U.S. combat
intervention there."
Couple this statement with the
President's request that aid is
needed in Angola "in view of ac
tions taken by the Soviet Union
and Cuba in providing large

quantities of military and men in
Angola."
We are basing our "limited"
aid in direct proportion to how
"limited" aid is to the Soviet
backed Popular Movement for
the Liberation of Angola
(MPLA).
As the Christian Science
Monitor records, Sceretary of
State Henry Kissinger is even
more explicit: "If we do not meet
the Russian challenge now at
modest cost we will find it
necessary to do so further down
the road when it will be more
■costly and dangerous."
A distortion of the real situa
tion. Vietnam was a
presidentially-controlled con
flict. The report that the Con
gress and the public heard was
the report that the respective
presidencies wanted them to
hear.
This offense of misrepresenta
tion is becoming increasingly
blatant in the Angolan conflict.
Not only has the CIA supplied
massive covert funds through
the Zaire and Zambian govern
ments. but many of the weapons
appropriated overtly have been
incorrectly recorded.
Sen. Lowell Weicker (R-Conn.)
dove a little deeper into Ad
ministration claims that one of
their deliveries of weapons total -
led $10 million in equipment.
Strangely enough, the shipping
bill for the $10 million in
weapons came to an astronomi
cally high sum of $5 million. -
Upon viewing the estimated
values of the equipment on the
military inventory list, Weicker
found that all weapons were
priced at far less than their real
value. A .45 caliber pistol was

listed at $5. Thus, we really don't
know how much the Administ
ration is sending even when it
gives a report.
