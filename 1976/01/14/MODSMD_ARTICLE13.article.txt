# Campus closing tragic

Stanford in Germany in
Beutelsbach is unique among
the overseas programs this Uni
versity supports. It is tragic that
it must close for financial
reasons.
It is the only program located
in a community small enough to
be personal. Beutelsbach be
came a home for every student.
Families literally adopted
students. They fed them, taught
them German, took them on
trips, instructed them in the
ways of the host culture.
They spent countless hours
and a lot of money giving our
students an understanding of
their way of life. This under
standing is very different than
the kind acquired through for
mal education or observation at a
distance.
It is an inside view and it is
personally meaningful.
Distinctive
Beutelsbach has a distinctive
identity. It is not a faceless con
glomerate.
It is the original seat of the
Counts of Wurttemberg. The
Evangelische Kirche had its be
ginning in 624 A.D. Der Limes,
the Roman barrier between the
civilized and barbarian worlds is
only a few minutes away.
The town is named after the
Schwaebish chieftain, Beutelo,
who was one of the first to breach
this wall and settled with his
people around the brook that
runs through the town (thus the
name, Beutelsbach).
Beutelsbach is a part of a
dynamic, urbanizing area. It is
only a quick trip away from
Stuttgart, a great economic,
political and particularly artis
tic capital.
Urbanization
But Beutelsbach itself is ur
banizing. Its population of 8000
is well over half composed of
people from other parts of Ger
many, and of Europe.
Its new housing, new streets,
new public buildings and new
problems, are all representative
of processes taking place in
human communities around the
world. And these processes were
studied, on the spot, as they
happened, by Stanford students.
They were able to visit ancient
Bauernhauser ("peasant"
houses) where humans and
livestock live under the same
roof and modern factories where
the latest techniques of manufac
turing are used.
And they were privileged to
paticipate in seminars on urban
planning and the consequences
of urbanization with the mayors
of Beutelsbach and nearby
communities. Some of this ex
perience is expressed in a book
written by over 400 Stanford
students and this professor:
Burgbach: Urbanization and
Identity in a German Village.
Stanford saves $150,000 a year
(how much is this per student?
how is it calculated?) but loses
an irreplaceable resource.
The goodwill and hospitality
of the people of the Remstal,
from the small-time winegrape
grower to the Mayor can never
by replaced. No great urban
center can substitute for
Beutelsbach bei Stuttgrat.

Bauernhauser ("peasant"
houses) where humans and
livestock live under the same
roof and modern factories where
the latest techniques of manufac
turing are used.
And they were privileged to
paticipate in seminars on urban
planning and the consequences
of urbanization with the mayors
of Beutelsbach and nearby
communities. Some of this ex
perience is expressed in a book
written by over 400 Stanford
students and this professor:
Burgbach: Urbanization and
Identity in a German Village.
Stanford saves $150,000 a year
(how much is this per student?
how is it calculated?) but loses
an irreplaceable resource.
The goodwill and hospitality
of the people of the Remstal,
from the small-time winegrape
grower to the Mayor can never
by replaced. No great urban
center can substitute for
Beutelsbach bei Stuttgrat.

Stanford in Germany in
Beutelsbach is unique among
the overseas programs this Uni
versity supports. It is tragic that
it must close for financial
reasons.
It is the only program located
in a community small enough to
be personal. Beutelsbach be
came a home for every student.
Families literally adopted
students. They fed them, taught
them German, took them on
trips, instructed them in the
ways of the host culture.
They spent countless hours
and a lot of money giving our
students an understanding of
their way of life. This under
standing is very different than
the kind acquired through for
mal education or observation at a
distance.
It is an inside view and it is
personally meaningful.
Distinctive
Beutelsbach has a distinctive
identity. It is not a faceless con
glomerate.
It is the original seat of the
Counts of Wurttemberg. The
Evangelische Kirche had its be
ginning in 624 A.D. Der Limes,
the Roman barrier between the
civilized and barbarian worlds is
only a few minutes away.
The town is named after the
Schwaebish chieftain, Beutelo,
who was one of the first to breach
this wall and settled with his
people around the brook that
runs through the town (thus the
name, Beutelsbach).
Beutelsbach is a part of a
dynamic, urbanizing area. It is
only a quick trip away from
Stuttgart, a great economic,
political and particularly artis
tic capital.
Urbanization
But Beutelsbach itself is ur
banizing. Its population of 8000
is well over half composed of
people from other parts of Ger
many, and of Europe.
Its new housing, new streets,
new public buildings and new
problems, are all representative
of processes taking place in
human communities around the
world. And these processes were
studied, on the spot, as they
happened, by Stanford students.
They were able to visit ancient
Bauernhauser ("peasant"
houses) where humans and
livestock live under the same
roof and modern factories where
the latest techniques of manufac
turing are used.
