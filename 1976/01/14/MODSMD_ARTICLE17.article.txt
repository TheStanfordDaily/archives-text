## Stanford debate: a dying art fades from view 
### LYN CARLSON 
Rep. Pete McCloskey was on
the Stanford debate team during
his undergraduate days.
Joe McCarthy began his dis
tinguished career by losing the
campaign for presidency of his
debate team.
And we must be forever in
debt to Whittier College's debate
team for teaching Richard Nixon
the art of talking his way out of
kitchen debates and Watergates.
But perhaps a future McClos
key from Stanford won't be able
to begin his speech to the sec
retly yawning audience of the
Ladies' Republican Luncheon
with "Well, it all began back on
the Stanford debate team when I
was a bright-eyed, energetic un
dergrad; yes, back in the winter
of '76. . ."
On its way out
That future politician proba
bly won't begin his speech that
way because the Stanford debate
team today is, in the words of
one team member, "being ph
ased out," and consequently not
too many future debaters are par
ticipating.
The debate team program was,
according to member Tom
Newell, "very strongly encour
aged by the administration up
until 1972." At that time the
team had an annual budget of
$20,000, provided both by the
University, and by a Speech De
partment, which existed then.
Membership totaled 200.
Budget axed
This year, however, the
budget wasn't merely chipped
away; it was totally axed. The
team managed to round up
$6000 through a student fee as

sessment, a grant from the Presi
dent's Office and donations.
The precipitous drop from
$20,000 to $0 from the Univer
sity is especially striking when
compared to other universities'
budgets. The prestigious debate
team powers, such as
Dartmouth, USC and
Georgetown have budgets rang
ing from $15,000 to $30,000.
Even Cal State-Fullerton has a
budget of $13,000.
The money for a debate team
isn't used for shoulder pads,
steaks for the training table or
the other accoutrements of an
athletic team's expenses, but
rather for such inglorious items

'It makes the
person think
for himself.'

as transportation costs to tour
naments, entry fees, hotel bills
and the coach's salary.
Squad coachless
The most major result of the
team's financial straits has been
the lack of a coach. This year's
coach, Brad Ziff, went on to
another job, and there have been
no applications to fill his post —
most likely because there are few
who would tackle a job with long
hours and no pay.
A former coach, Dan Meek,
has offered his part-time services
free of charge when he returns as
a law student this quarter. De
spite this unexpected help, the
lack of a full-time coach is seen

as a serious problem by team
member Mark Edwards.
"To be a very good team," Ed
wards says, "you need a very
good coach. He isn't going to
stick around for a rinko, second
rate program; for a debate
against Chico State or Santa
Clara."
The lack of money has also af
fected the team membership.
The team has dropped down to
about 10 who participated in the
more advanced national debates
last fall and an estimated 30 who
will participate in the local de
bates coming up.
Wracked by no-shows
One team member comments
that he has noticed several na
tional debate champions from
high school in his dorm, but
none of them are continuing
with debate here at Stanford.
Wagstaffe speculates that
many of these "come from very
good organizations in high
school."
But the disenchantment
reaches deeper than petty grie
vances over who pays for the
hamburger and fries between
debating i ounds; theadministra
tion's implied lack of interest
and hence, lack of funding
seems to be the root of the disen
chantment.
Freshman Jerry Lampton, who
participated actively at first this
fall, reflected on this dilemma:
"Because the school isn't mak
ing it worth my effort, I'm not
putting in the time."
Wagstaffe, now in charge of
fund-raising as well as serving as
acting director, reported that
when he tries to get the ad
ministration to support the team

more actively, "the word 'prior
ity' is used a lot. It becomes a
deity in itself — the Almighty."
Despite the lack of University
aid, debate team president John
Roos doesn't agree the squad is
necessarily doomed. "As long as
we maintain our present student
support," he says, "we're going
to do everything we can to keep
our team in competition."
But if debate is low among
Stanford's priorities, it remains
high among the personal
priorities of team members, and
with the typical debater's verbal
virtuosity they explain why:

"It broadens your spectrum."
"You learn to organize your
thoughts."
"It forces the individual to
think for himself" and "you
learn that there's no absolute
truth."
Unfortunately, in times of fi
nancial difficulty the University
must make sacrifices, cut prog
rams and establish priorities.
But the team questions whether
debate is one of those things that
should be sacrificed: whether it
must be one of the unlucky few
to die quietly at the bottom of a
priority list.

as transportation costs to tour
naments, entry fees, hotel bills
and the coach's salary.
Squad coachless
The most major result of the
team's financial straits has been
the lack of a coach. This year's
coach, Brad Ziff, went on to
another job, and there have been
no applications to fill his post —
most likely because there are few
who would tackle a job with long
hours and no pay.
A former coach, Dan Meek,
has offered his part-time services
free of charge when he returns as
a law student this quarter. De
spite this unexpected help, the
lack of a full-time coach is seen

as a serious problem by team
member Mark Edwards.
"To be a very good team," Ed
wards says, "you need a very
good coach. He isn't going to
stick around for a rinko, second
rate program; for a debate
against Chico State or Santa
Clara."
The lack of money has also af
fected the team membership.
The team has dropped down to
about 10 who participated in the
more advanced national debates
last fall and an estimated 30 who
will participate in the local de
bates coming up.
Wracked by no-shows
One team member comments
that he has noticed several na
tional debate champions from
high school in his dorm, but
none of them are continuing
with debate here at Stanford.
Wagstaffe speculates that
many of these "come from very
good organizations in high
school."
But the disenchantment
reaches deeper than petty grie
vances over who pays for the
hamburger and fries between
debating i ounds; theadministra
tion's implied lack of interest
and hence, lack of funding
seems to be the root of the disen
chantment.
Freshman Jerry Lampton, who
participated actively at first this
fall, reflected on this dilemma:
"Because the school isn't mak
ing it worth my effort, I'm not
putting in the time."
Wagstaffe, now in charge of
fund-raising as well as serving as
acting director, reported that
when he tries to get the ad
ministration to support the team

more actively, "the word 'prior
ity' is used a lot. It becomes a
deity in itself — the Almighty."
Despite the lack of University
aid, debate team president John
Roos doesn't agree the squad is
necessarily doomed. "As long as
we maintain our present student
support," he says, "we're going
to do everything we can to keep
our team in competition."
But if debate is low among
Stanford's priorities, it remains
high among the personal
priorities of team members, and
with the typical debater's verbal
virtuosity they explain why:

"It broadens your spectrum."
"You learn to organize your
thoughts."
"It forces the individual to
think for himself" and "you
learn that there's no absolute
truth."
Unfortunately, in times of fi
nancial difficulty the University
must make sacrifices, cut prog
rams and establish priorities.
But the team questions whether
debate is one of those things that
should be sacrificed: whether it
must be one of the unlucky few
to die quietly at the bottom of a
priority list.

RAZOR SHARP—Rep. Pete McCloskey began his illustrious
career with none other than the Stanford debate team. McCloskey
sports a verbal ability second to few.

NOT SO SHARP—If Gerald Ford had spent less time on the foot
ball team and more time on the debate team, he might not find
himself stumbling on so many two-syllable words.
Rep. Pete McCloskey was on
the Stanford debate team during
his undergraduate days.
Joe McCarthy began his dis
tinguished career by losing the
campaign for presidency of his
debate team.
And we must be forever in
debt to Whittier College's debate
team for teaching Richard Nixon
the art of talking his way out of
kitchen debates and Watergates.
But perhaps a future McClos
key from Stanford won't be able
to begin his speech to the sec
retly yawning audience of the
Ladies' Republican Luncheon
with "Well, it all began back on
the Stanford debate team when I
was a bright-eyed, energetic un
dergrad; yes, back in the winter
of '76. . ."
On its way out
That future politician proba
bly won't begin his speech that
way because the Stanford debate
team today is, in the words of
one team member, "being ph
ased out," and consequently not
too many future debaters are par
ticipating.
The debate team program was,
according to member Tom
Newell, "very strongly encour
aged by the administration up
until 1972." At that time the
team had an annual budget of
$20,000, provided both by the
University, and by a Speech De
partment, which existed then.
Membership totaled 200.
Budget axed
This year, however, the
budget wasn't merely chipped
away; it was totally axed. The
team managed to round up
$6000 through a student fee as

sessment, a grant from the Presi
dent's Office and donations.
The precipitous drop from
$20,000 to $0 from the Univer
sity is especially striking when
compared to other universities'
budgets. The prestigious debate
team powers, such as
Dartmouth, USC and
Georgetown have budgets rang
ing from $15,000 to $30,000.
Even Cal State-Fullerton has a
budget of $13,000.

Wagstaffe, now in charge of
fund-raising as well as serving as
acting director, reported that
when he tries to get the ad
ministration to support the team

more actively, "the word 'prior
ity' is used a lot. It becomes a
deity in itself — the Almighty."
Despite the lack of University
aid, debate team president John
Roos doesn't agree the squad is
necessarily doomed. "As long as
we maintain our present student
support," he says, "we're going
to do everything we can to keep
our team in competition."
But if debate is low among
Stanford's priorities, it remains
high among the personal
priorities of team members, and
with the typical debater's verbal
virtuosity they explain why:

"It broadens your spectrum."
"You learn to organize your
thoughts."
"It forces the individual to
think for himself" and "you
learn that there's no absolute
truth."
Unfortunately, in times of fi
nancial difficulty the University
must make sacrifices, cut prog
rams and establish priorities.
But the team questions whether
debate is one of those things that
should be sacrificed: whether it
must be one of the unlucky few
to die quietly at the bottom of a
priority list.

RAZOR SHARP—Rep. Pete McCloskey began his illustrious
career with none other than the Stanford debate team. McCloskey
sports a verbal ability second to few.

NOT SO SHARP—If Gerald Ford had spent less time on the foot
ball team and more time on the debate team, he might not find
himself stumbling on so many two-syllable words.
Rep. Pete McCloskey was on
the Stanford debate team during
his undergraduate days.
Joe McCarthy began his dis
tinguished career by losing the
campaign for presidency of his
debate team.
And we must be forever in
debt to Whittier College's debate
team for teaching Richard Nixon
the art of talking his way out of
kitchen debates and Watergates.
But perhaps a future McClos
key from Stanford won't be able
to begin his speech to the sec
retly yawning audience of the
Ladies' Republican Luncheon
with "Well, it all began back on
the Stanford debate team when I
was a bright-eyed, energetic un
dergrad; yes, back in the winter
of '76. . ."
On its way out
That future politician proba
bly won't begin his speech that
way because the Stanford debate
team today is, in the words of
one team member, "being ph
ased out," and consequently not
too many future debaters are par
ticipating.
The debate team program was,
according to member Tom
Newell, "very strongly encour
aged by the administration up
until 1972." At that time the
team had an annual budget of
$20,000, provided both by the
University, and by a Speech De
partment, which existed then.
Membership totaled 200.
Budget axed
This year, however, the
budget wasn't merely chipped
away; it was totally axed. The
team managed to round up
$6000 through a student fee as

sessment, a grant from the Presi
dent's Office and donations.
The precipitous drop from
$20,000 to $0 from the Univer
sity is especially striking when
compared to other universities'
budgets. The prestigious debate
team powers, such as
Dartmouth, USC and
Georgetown have budgets rang
ing from $15,000 to $30,000.
Even Cal State-Fullerton has a
budget of $13,000.
The money for a debate team
isn't used for shoulder pads,
steaks for the training table or
the other accoutrements of an
athletic team's expenses, but
rather for such inglorious items

'It makes the
person think
for himself.'

as transportation costs to tour
naments, entry fees, hotel bills
and the coach's salary.
Squad coachless
The most major result of the
team's financial straits has been
the lack of a coach. This year's
coach, Brad Ziff, went on to
another job, and there have been
no applications to fill his post —
most likely because there are few
who would tackle a job with long
hours and no pay.
A former coach, Dan Meek,
has offered his part-time services
free of charge when he returns as
a law student this quarter. De
spite this unexpected help, the
lack of a full-time coach is seen

as a serious problem by team
member Mark Edwards.
"To be a very good team," Ed
wards says, "you need a very
good coach. He isn't going to
stick around for a rinko, second
rate program; for a debate
against Chico State or Santa
Clara."
The lack of money has also af
fected the team membership.
The team has dropped down to
about 10 who participated in the
more advanced national debates
last fall and an estimated 30 who
will participate in the local de
bates coming up.
Wracked by no-shows
One team member comments
that he has noticed several na
tional debate champions from
high school in his dorm, but
none of them are continuing
with debate here at Stanford.
Wagstaffe speculates that
many of these "come from very
good organizations in high
school."
But the disenchantment
reaches deeper than petty grie
vances over who pays for the
hamburger and fries between
debating i ounds; theadministra
tion's implied lack of interest
and hence, lack of funding
seems to be the root of the disen
chantment.
Freshman Jerry Lampton, who
participated actively at first this
fall, reflected on this dilemma:
"Because the school isn't mak
ing it worth my effort, I'm not
putting in the time."
Wagstaffe, now in charge of
fund-raising as well as serving as
acting director, reported that
when he tries to get the ad
ministration to support the team
