What do medical people think about the desirability/
undesirability of ingesting semen?
It's not a matter of great concern. Swallowing the ejaculate will
most likely neither help you nor harm you. It's not 100 percent
sperm, as most of it will consist of the nutritive semen. There is no
chance of pregnancy, in case you didn't know, since everything
gets digested. Dr. John Dorman at Cowell suggests that if the semen
is good for sperm, it's probably good for the body, too, but it will
have no effects as an aphrodisiac or source of hormones. It's caloric
content isn't known, but you need not worry about getting fat, as it
comes in small servings. It is, however, theoretically possible to get
syphilis or gonorrhea into your bloodstream if the semen is in
fected with either of those venereal diseases.

I know women aren't supposed to ejaculate, but it sure seems like
something comes out ivhen I come. Why?
You're right, women don't have anything comparable to a man's
ejaculation. However, some women have reported some sort of
release during orgasm. It's possible that in some cases this could be
urine, but I expect you'd know if that were the case. It's more likely
just the natural lubrication secreted by the vaginal walls, which has
been brought to the outside genital area during intercourse. Then,
at orgasm, intense muscle spasms rapidly expel large amounts.

Is it natural to have ivet drearns even if you're sexually satisfied?
My girlfriend's beginning to wonder about those wet spots.
Wet dreams are perfectly normal, although not all men have
them. Their frequency tends to decrease when there are other
sexual outlets (intercourse, masturbation), but they won't necessar
ily disappear entirely even if you're having intercourse regularly.
They should not be taken as a slur on your partner's sexual abilities.
