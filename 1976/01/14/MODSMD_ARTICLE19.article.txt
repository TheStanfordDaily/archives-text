# Citizens intervene in Yosemite development
## 
### 
YOSEMITE, Cal., Jan. 8 (Pacific
News Service) — The Music
Corporation of America (MCA)
didn't plan it that way, but the
firm's show-biz approach to
Yosemite National Park may
have opened a new era in park
planning — one of unpre
cedented public involvement.
Within the past few weeks,
more than 32,000 private citi
zens have received what can
only be described as do-it
yourself Yosemite planning kits.
And thousands more are await
ing a hastily ordered second
printing.
The kits list specific planning
options, such as building more
roads or closing the park to all
but foot traffic; opening up new
areas for camp grounds, motels
and concession stands or leaving
them undeveloped; and drain
ing the reservoirat Hetch Hetchy
to restore the natural valley or
keeping it. Yes or no check boxes
are provided for the citizen
planners to record their prefer
ences.
The responses, amounting to a
public poll on whether to ex
pand or limit development of the
park, will be analyzed by com
puter and used as the basis of a
draft master plan for the park.
Then further public comment
will be sought. The Park Service
hopes to have a final plan ready
for adoption by the end of 1976.
The enthusiastic public re
sponse has surprised even the
National Park Service (NPS) of
ficials who devised the novel
planning approach. Initially,
about 19,000 of the elaborate kits
were mailed. Recipients in
cluded the more than 5,600 per
sons who attended one or more
of the 4H public workshops held
at 36 locations — in and out of
California — early last year.
Public Outrage
Both the workshops and the
planning-kit approach grew out
of public outrage about the tone
and direction of a proposed mas
ter plan drafted in secret by NPS
and the major park concessioner
— Music Corporation of
America, a national booking
agency turned corporate con
gfcmerate.
s news of the new planning
>»o>roach got around (both MCA
and major conservation groups
urged their adherents to get into
the act) requests for the planning
kits mushroomed. As of early
December, the initial printing of
32,000 kits was gone, and the
Yosemite Planning Team had
received requests for 17,500 kits

from a newly ordered second
printing of 30,000. Deadlines for
requesting and returning the
plans were extended.
The new approach is a sharp
shift from earlier NPS policy.
The way things used to work,
Park Service personnel would
draft a preliminary master plan
and hold hearings on it. Then a
"final" plan would be prepared,
and adopted after further hear
ings. Hut public involvment was
limited to the hearings.
It was precisely this lack of
public participation in Yosemite
planning — coupled with heavy
involvement of the major con
cessioner — that led to the
scrapping of preliminary park
plans in mid-December 1974.
The California-based MCA
conglomerate acquired control
of Yosemite Park and Curry
company, and the remaining 20
years of its 20-year concession
contract, in September 1973. At
the time, NPS was revising and
updating a draft master plan first
published and subjected to pub
lic hearings in 1971.
When MCA entered the pic
ture, it insisted on substantial
changes. MCA and NPS dic
kered in private, but disgruntled
NPS employees leaked bootleg
copies of key documents to con
servationists, legislators and the
media.
The resulting furor led to the
abandonment of a pending plan
drafted in such a way that
Nathaniel Reed, Asst. Secret
ary of the Interior, was moved to
remark acidly that it read as if it
were "written by the conces
sioner."
Subsequent testimony at joint
hearings by two congressional
subcommittees bore out Reed's
suspicions. The evidence
showed that MCA officials were
insistent on their own ideas of
what the park should provide;
that they had invoked political
muscle when they didn't get
what they wanted.
They questioned the compe
tency of the park superintendent
and the regional NPS director
when those officials recom
mended against MCA's ideas.
And they went over the heads of
those officials in appeals — suc
cessful, at first — to Washington,
where they found a sympathetic
ear in Ronald Walker, then the
NPS chief. (Walker was ap
pointed in late 1972 after serving
as an advance man for Richard
Nixon in the 1972 election cam

paign. Walker quit the job as of
early 1975.)
Push for development
MCA pressured to increase the
park's overall capacity; to "up
grade" 150 overnight accommo
dations in the valley by replac
ing them with more expensive
units; to develop more high
country areas. In short, to in
crease the use of a park which
many believe is already over
crowded.
Much of the criticism of the
MCA involved activities not re
flected in the proposed plans: its
active promotion of the park as a
convention center, and theuseof
the park by an MCA subsidiary,
Universal Studios, to film a
short-lived TV series called
"Sierra." Conservationists were
particularly outraged when film
crews painted some rocks in the
park "so they would photograph
better."
The controversy led to so-far
inconclusive hearings (De
cember 1974 and last July) by
two congressional subcommit
tees.
And it produced the new
planning approach.
Park officials say the Yosemite
approach has now become NPS
policy, In fact, community
forums have already been held
in connection with the prelimi
nary planning of several other
parks.
The public involvement in
planning other parks may not be
quite as extensive as that for
Yosemite, however, a planning
team member said.
Yosemite is one of the biggest,

oldest and most spectacular ot
the National Parks — and one of
the best-known and most
visited. It is "something special"
to people all over the country.
Besides, the new Yosemite
planning effort has been costly.
The estimated cost of the kits
alone (four poster-sized sheets
with maps and lists of some 500
planning options) is about 55
cents a set, or just over $34,000
for the 62,000 kits printed or on
order.

Push for development
MCA pressured to increase the
park's overall capacity; to "up
grade" 150 overnight accommo
dations in the valley by replac
ing them with more expensive
units; to develop more high
country areas. In short, to in
crease the use of a park which
many believe is already over
crowded.
Much of the criticism of the
MCA involved activities not re
flected in the proposed plans: its
active promotion of the park as a
convention center, and theuseof
the park by an MCA subsidiary,
Universal Studios, to film a
short-lived TV series called
"Sierra." Conservationists were
particularly outraged when film
crews painted some rocks in the
park "so they would photograph
better."
The controversy led to so-far
inconclusive hearings (De
cember 1974 and last July) by
two congressional subcommit
tees.
And it produced the new
planning approach.
Park officials say the Yosemite
approach has now become NPS
policy, In fact, community
forums have already been held
in connection with the prelimi
nary planning of several other
parks.
The public involvement in
planning other parks may not be
quite as extensive as that for
Yosemite, however, a planning
team member said.
Yosemite is one of the biggest,

oldest and most spectacular ot
the National Parks — and one of
the best-known and most
visited. It is "something special"
to people all over the country.
Besides, the new Yosemite
planning effort has been costly.
The estimated cost of the kits
alone (four poster-sized sheets
with maps and lists of some 500
planning options) is about 55
cents a set, or just over $34,000
for the 62,000 kits printed or on
order.

YOSEMITE, Cal., Jan. 8 (Pacific
News Service) — The Music
Corporation of America (MCA)
didn't plan it that way, but the
firm's show-biz approach to
Yosemite National Park may
have opened a new era in park
planning — one of unpre
cedented public involvement.
Within the past few weeks,
more than 32,000 private citi
zens have received what can
only be described as do-it
yourself Yosemite planning kits.
And thousands more are await
ing a hastily ordered second
printing.
The kits list specific planning
options, such as building more
roads or closing the park to all
but foot traffic; opening up new
areas for camp grounds, motels
and concession stands or leaving
them undeveloped; and drain
ing the reservoirat Hetch Hetchy
to restore the natural valley or
keeping it. Yes or no check boxes
are provided for the citizen
planners to record their prefer
ences.
The responses, amounting to a
public poll on whether to ex
pand or limit development of the
park, will be analyzed by com
puter and used as the basis of a
draft master plan for the park.
Then further public comment
will be sought. The Park Service
hopes to have a final plan ready
for adoption by the end of 1976.
The enthusiastic public re
sponse has surprised even the
National Park Service (NPS) of
ficials who devised the novel
planning approach. Initially,
about 19,000 of the elaborate kits
were mailed. Recipients in
cluded the more than 5,600 per
sons who attended one or more
of the 4H public workshops held
at 36 locations — in and out of
California — early last year.
Public Outrage
Both the workshops and the
planning-kit approach grew out
of public outrage about the tone
and direction of a proposed mas
ter plan drafted in secret by NPS
and the major park concessioner
— Music Corporation of
America, a national booking
agency turned corporate con
gfcmerate.
s news of the new planning
>»o>roach got around (both MCA
and major conservation groups
urged their adherents to get into
the act) requests for the planning
kits mushroomed. As of early
December, the initial printing of
32,000 kits was gone, and the
Yosemite Planning Team had
received requests for 17,500 kits

from a newly ordered second
printing of 30,000. Deadlines for
requesting and returning the
plans were extended.
The new approach is a sharp
shift from earlier NPS policy.
The way things used to work,
Park Service personnel would
draft a preliminary master plan
and hold hearings on it. Then a
"final" plan would be prepared,
and adopted after further hear
ings. Hut public involvment was
limited to the hearings.
It was precisely this lack of
public participation in Yosemite
planning — coupled with heavy
involvement of the major con
cessioner — that led to the
scrapping of preliminary park
plans in mid-December 1974.
The California-based MCA
conglomerate acquired control
of Yosemite Park and Curry
company, and the remaining 20
years of its 20-year concession
contract, in September 1973. At
the time, NPS was revising and
updating a draft master plan first
published and subjected to pub
lic hearings in 1971.
When MCA entered the pic
ture, it insisted on substantial
changes. MCA and NPS dic
kered in private, but disgruntled
NPS employees leaked bootleg
copies of key documents to con
servationists, legislators and the
media.
The resulting furor led to the
abandonment of a pending plan
drafted in such a way that
Nathaniel Reed, Asst. Secret
ary of the Interior, was moved to
remark acidly that it read as if it
were "written by the conces
sioner."
Subsequent testimony at joint
hearings by two congressional
subcommittees bore out Reed's
suspicions. The evidence
showed that MCA officials were
insistent on their own ideas of
what the park should provide;
that they had invoked political
muscle when they didn't get
what they wanted.
They questioned the compe
tency of the park superintendent
and the regional NPS director
when those officials recom
mended against MCA's ideas.
And they went over the heads of
those officials in appeals — suc
cessful, at first — to Washington,
where they found a sympathetic
ear in Ronald Walker, then the
NPS chief. (Walker was ap
pointed in late 1972 after serving
as an advance man for Richard

printing of 30,000. Deadlines for
requesting and returning the
plans were extended.
The new approach is a sharp
shift from earlier NPS policy.
The way things used to work,
Park Service personnel would
draft a preliminary master plan
and hold hearings on it. Then a
"final" plan would be prepared,
and adopted after further hear
ings. Hut public involvment was
limited to the hearings.
It was precisely this lack of
public participation in Yosemite
planning — coupled with heavy
involvement of the major con
cessioner — that led to the
scrapping of preliminary park
plans in mid-December 1974.
The California-based MCA
conglomerate acquired control
of Yosemite Park and Curry
company, and the remaining 20
years of its 20-year concession
contract, in September 1973. At
the time, NPS was revising and
updating a draft master plan first
published and subjected to pub
lic hearings in 1971.
When MCA entered the pic
ture, it insisted on substantial
changes. MCA and NPS dic
kered in private, but disgruntled
NPS employees leaked bootleg
copies of key documents to con
servationists, legislators and the
media.
The resulting furor led to the
abandonment of a pending plan
drafted in such a way that
Nathaniel Reed, Asst. Secret
ary of the Interior, was moved to
remark acidly that it read as if it
were "written by the conces
sioner."
Subsequent testimony at joint
hearings by two congressional
subcommittees bore out Reed's
suspicions. The evidence
showed that MCA officials were
insistent on their own ideas of
what the park should provide;
that they had invoked political
muscle when they didn't get
what they wanted.
They questioned the compe
tency of the park superintendent
and the regional NPS director
when those officials recom
mended against MCA's ideas.
And they went over the heads of
those officials in appeals — suc
cessful, at first — to Washington,
where they found a sympathetic
ear in Ronald Walker, then the
NPS chief. (Walker was ap
pointed in late 1972 after serving
as an advance man for Richard
Nixon in the 1972 election cam

paign. Walker quit the job as of
early 1975.)
Push for development
MCA pressured to increase the
park's overall capacity; to "up
grade" 150 overnight accommo
dations in the valley by replac
ing them with more expensive
units; to develop more high
country areas. In short, to in
crease the use of a park which
many believe is already over
crowded.
Much of the criticism of the
MCA involved activities not re
flected in the proposed plans: its
active promotion of the park as a
convention center, and theuseof
the park by an MCA subsidiary,
Universal Studios, to film a
short-lived TV series called
"Sierra." Conservationists were
particularly outraged when film
crews painted some rocks in the
park "so they would photograph
better."
The controversy led to so-far
inconclusive hearings (De
cember 1974 and last July) by
two congressional subcommit
tees.
And it produced the new
planning approach.
Park officials say the Yosemite
approach has now become NPS
policy, In fact, community
forums have already been held
in connection with the prelimi
nary planning of several other
parks.
The public involvement in
planning other parks may not be
quite as extensive as that for
Yosemite, however, a planning
team member said.
Yosemite is one of the biggest,

oldest and most spectacular ot
the National Parks — and one of
the best-known and most
visited. It is "something special"
to people all over the country.
Besides, the new Yosemite
planning effort has been costly.
The estimated cost of the kits
alone (four poster-sized sheets
with maps and lists of some 500
planning options) is about 55
cents a set, or just over $34,000
for the 62,000 kits printed or on
order.

YOSEMITE, Cal., Jan. 8 (Pacific
News Service) — The Music
Corporation of America (MCA)
didn't plan it that way, but the
firm's show-biz approach to
Yosemite National Park may
have opened a new era in park
planning — one of unpre
cedented public involvement.
Within the past few weeks,
more than 32,000 private citi
zens have received what can
only be described as do-it
yourself Yosemite planning kits.
And thousands more are await
ing a hastily ordered second
printing.
The kits list specific planning
options, such as building more
roads or closing the park to all
but foot traffic; opening up new
areas for camp grounds, motels
and concession stands or leaving
them undeveloped; and drain
ing the reservoirat Hetch Hetchy
to restore the natural valley or
keeping it. Yes or no check boxes
are provided for the citizen
planners to record their prefer
ences.
The responses, amounting to a
public poll on whether to ex
pand or limit development of the
park, will be analyzed by com
puter and used as the basis of a
draft master plan for the park.
Then further public comment
will be sought. The Park Service
hopes to have a final plan ready
for adoption by the end of 1976.
The enthusiastic public re
sponse has surprised even the
National Park Service (NPS) of
ficials who devised the novel
planning approach. Initially,
about 19,000 of the elaborate kits
were mailed. Recipients in
cluded the more than 5,600 per
sons who attended one or more
of the 4H public workshops held
at 36 locations — in and out of
California — early last year.
Public Outrage
Both the workshops and the
planning-kit approach grew out
of public outrage about the tone
and direction of a proposed mas
ter plan drafted in secret by NPS
and the major park concessioner
— Music Corporation of
America, a national booking
agency turned corporate con
gfcmerate.
