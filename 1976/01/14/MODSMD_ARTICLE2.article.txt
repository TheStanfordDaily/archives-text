# USE shelves plan for worker's appeal
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The United Stanford Employees
(USE) union has no immediate plans to
appeal the layoff of Asst. USE Presi
dent William Reynolds because
Reynolds is heing considered for
another University job, according to
USE President Jim Berk.
Speaking last night on KZSU's
Campus Conference, Berk said that
Reynolds, formerly a machinist at
Hansen Laboratories, might soon be
"bumped" into a job at the Stanford
Electronics Laboratories.
Under University regulations, an
employe such as Reynolds, who has
more than four years of seniority, can
"bump" into another job, replacing a
worker with less seniority.
Berk said, however, that if Reynolds
is not transferred to the electronics lab,
USE will probably appeal Reynolds'
layoff to an officer not affiliated with
the University for binding arbitration
under the union's contract with the
University.
Another demonstration
Berk added that if Reynolds has
neither been transferred to a new job
nor reinstated in his old one by tomor
row, the union will conduct another
demonstration in front of Encina Hall.
A first demonstration last week was
condemned by Doug Barton. Univer
sity staff counsel for employe rela
tions. Barton contended that the de
monstration violated an anti-picketing
clause in the union's 1974 contract
with the University.
But Berk said last night that the En
cina demonstration was not a picket
because it was intended only to call
attention to Reynolds' case and not to
prevent workers from entering Encina.
"We must demonstrate to show that
the union will not tolerate its assistant
president and top negotiator going
away," Berk said.
No 'central conspiracy'
Although Berk repeated his conten
tion of last week that Reynolds was
laid off because of his union activities,
he noted, "1 don't believe there is a
central conspiracy by University ad
ministrators" to harrass union offi
cials.
In other Camp us Conference re
marks, Berk said he hopes student
employes of the University will un
ionize in coming years.
"They could be a lot of help to us and

we could be a lot of help to them," Berk
said.
Berk noted that students in general
"are not as involved in support of the
union as they should be."
University recognition
Berk also said that "University rec
ognition of the union" will be the main
issue of contention between USE and
the University administration during
upcoming negotiations in advance of
the Aug. 31 expiration of the union's
contract.
According to Berk, the University
currently is willing to negotiate and
sign contracts with the union but will
not share its power over employes
with the union.
Berk charged that too much power
over employes is concentrated in the
office of Barton, whom Berk called an
agent of Robert Augsburger, vice pres
ident for business and finance.
More power should also be given to
heads of individual divisions of the
University, such as the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC), Berk said.
