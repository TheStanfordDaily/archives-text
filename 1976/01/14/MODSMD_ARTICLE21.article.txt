# Yoga, candles for Gov. Brown

SACRAMENTO (AP) — A Re
publican assemblyman said yes
terday he had it "on the highest
authority" that Gov. Edmund
Brown Jr. sits in an upside down
lotus position by candlelight
when reviewing bills.
Assemblyman John Briggs, a
Eullerton legislator running for
the state Senate this year, made
his pronouncement during a
veto override speech on the As
sembly floor.
Briggs said the Democratic
governor is joined in these ses
sions by "GG" which he said

stood for "governor's guru."
That was a clear reference to Jac
ques Barzaghi, Brown's arts ad
viser.
Briggs' veto override on a re
tirement benefit bill failed by a
crashing 21-36 tally — 33 votes
short of the 54 votes needed.
And Bill Sialt, Brown's press
secretary, pronounced Briggs's
comments "nonsense."
"Assemblyman Leroy Greene
(D-Sacramento) ended the de
bate by asking the Briggs' re
marks be printed upside down in
the Assembly journal so Brown
could read them.
