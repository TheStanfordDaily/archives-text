# Convenient credit cards increase prices for all
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (Pacific
News Service) — As post
holiday bills pile up, Christmas
shoppers who relied on bank
credit cards may find their bank
balances even shorter than ex
pected. And shoppers who paid
cash may have spent more than
they needed to — all because
credit cards have been mistaken
for Santa Claus.
Since they first came into wide
use in the mid-19605, bank cre
dit cards have become virtually
synonymous with cash. Fifty
percent of American households
now use either Master Charge or
BankAmericard, the two major
bank credit cards.
"What most people still do not
realize," says consumer advo
cate Neil Gendel, lawyer for San
Francisco Consumer Action, "is
that every time anyone uses a
bank credit card it costs all of us
money. The cost to the merchant
is simply passed on to his cus
tomers." Gendel thinks people
"should reflect on the whole
credit card way of handling fi
nances."
The most obvious cost is to the
credit card user. "These cards
and the charges made on them
represent loans," Gendel says.
"Loans that just as easily could
be gotten at a bank at a much
lower rate."
For instance, the annual in
terest rate on a bank credit card is
18 percent — and more with
compounded interest if the con
sumer pays over several months.
But bank loans range from only
two or three percent annual in
terest for borrowing against a
savings account, to 12 or 13 per
cent for a regular loan secured
against other collateral. Even an
unsecured loan can be obtained
for 15 percent — still under the
uniform credit card rate.
New Regulations
Partially as a result of efforts
by consumer advocate groups
across the country, the Federal
Reserve Board issued a new set

of regulations for credit cards
just before the Christmas rush, in
late November 1975.
Among the new rules was a
"voluntary" program in which
merchants could offer their cus
tomers discounts for using cash
rather than credit cards— dis
counts which had previously,
been specifically forbidden by
the contracts many credit card
companies offered to merchants.
Since it costs merchants time
and money when customers use
credit cards rather than cash —
those slips you sign in triplicate
are discounted from an average
of about three percent to as much
as 10 percent when a merchant
presents them to a bank — it was
assumed that such cash dis
counts would become com
monplace.
But as it turned out. they were
as rare during the 1975 holiday
season as a pre-Christmas sale.
Under the law. cash discounts
are optional — but if a merchant
offers them at all, he must offer
them to everyone. One problem
may have been that people sim
ply didn't know they could have
asked for cash discounts when
they shopped.
While the Federal Reserve
stipulated that the credit card
companies had to notify con
sumers about some of the new
rules, such as those dealing with
billing errors, the cash discount
provision required no notice.
Not surprisingly the companies
made no effort to publicize it.
A credit card industry
spokesman argues that the pub
lic is more concerned with con
venience than economy. Ken
Larkin, senior vice president for
BankAmericard at the Bank of
America, says that a cash dis
count program won't affect
BankAmericard "one way or the
other. . . We don't have any
quarrel with this type of dis
count," Larkin says.
But, as University of Rochester
economist Dr. Thomas Russell

points out, even strictly cash
customers end up paying for the
convenience of others. "There is
evidence that the use of credit
cards is inflationary — that we
all pay for their use," says Dr.
Russell, author of The
Economics of Bank Credit
Cards.
Dr. Russell believes the cash
customer has, in most cases,
been discriminated against. He
believes it is time to fight back.
"lust remember," he says,
"everyone stands to gain by cash
discounts — except, of course,
the bank card and travel card
corporations. The merchant can
offer you a break in the price of
an item without affecting his
profit margin — in fact it is pos
sible for him to lower the charge
to you and still realize a greater
profit than would be possible
without a charge card sale."
The important thing is not to
be shy: "When the manager or
store owner appears, say to
them: 'What is it worth to you to
receive .cash rather than a dis
countable draft from a credit
card sale?' If the person is in a
decent mood and reasonably in
telligent, he or she will realize
that both parties stand to gain
and you'll get your discount,"
Russell contends.
The discount would not be
huge — most likely about two or
three percent — but any amount
off those holiday bills might look
good. And there would be no
worry about paying off future fi
nance charges.
According to consumer advo
cates like Gendel and Russell, it
may be time for consumers to
play their own version of "Let's
Make a Deal."
"Cash," Marshal McLuhan
once said, "is the poor man's
credit card."
Hut if cash discounts catch on,
the poor man may get the last
laugh.

SAN FRANCISCO (Pacific
News Service) — As post
holiday bills pile up, Christmas
shoppers who relied on bank
credit cards may find their bank
balances even shorter than ex
pected. And shoppers who paid
cash may have spent more than
they needed to — all because
credit cards have been mistaken
for Santa Claus.
Since they first came into wide
use in the mid-19605, bank cre
dit cards have become virtually
synonymous with cash. Fifty
percent of American households
now use either Master Charge or
BankAmericard, the two major
bank credit cards.
"What most people still do not
realize," says consumer advo
cate Neil Gendel, lawyer for San
Francisco Consumer Action, "is
that every time anyone uses a
bank credit card it costs all of us
money. The cost to the merchant
is simply passed on to his cus
tomers." Gendel thinks people
"should reflect on the whole
credit card way of handling fi
nances."
The most obvious cost is to the
credit card user. "These cards
and the charges made on them
represent loans," Gendel says.
"Loans that just as easily could
be gotten at a bank at a much
lower rate."
For instance, the annual in
terest rate on a bank credit card is
18 percent — and more with
compounded interest if the con
sumer pays over several months.
But bank loans range from only
two or three percent annual in
terest for borrowing against a
savings account, to 12 or 13 per
cent for a regular loan secured
against other collateral. Even an
unsecured loan can be obtained
for 15 percent — still under the
uniform credit card rate.
New Regulations
Partially as a result of efforts
by consumer advocate groups
across the country, the Federal
Reserve Board issued a new set

of regulations for credit cards
just before the Christmas rush, in
late November 1975.
Among the new rules was a
"voluntary" program in which
merchants could offer their cus
tomers discounts for using cash
rather than credit cards— dis
counts which had previously,
been specifically forbidden by
the contracts many credit card
companies offered to merchants.
Since it costs merchants time
and money when customers use
credit cards rather than cash —
those slips you sign in triplicate
are discounted from an average
of about three percent to as much
as 10 percent when a merchant
presents them to a bank — it was
assumed that such cash dis
counts would become com
monplace.
But as it turned out. they were
as rare during the 1975 holiday
season as a pre-Christmas sale.
Under the law. cash discounts
are optional — but if a merchant
offers them at all, he must offer
them to everyone. One problem
may have been that people sim
ply didn't know they could have
asked for cash discounts when
they shopped.
While the Federal Reserve
stipulated that the credit card
companies had to notify con
sumers about some of the new
rules, such as those dealing with
billing errors, the cash discount
provision required no notice.
Not surprisingly the companies
made no effort to publicize it.
A credit card industry
spokesman argues that the pub
lic is more concerned with con
venience than economy. Ken
Larkin, senior vice president for
BankAmericard at the Bank of
America, says that a cash dis
count program won't affect
BankAmericard "one way or the
other. . . We don't have any
quarrel with this type of dis
count," Larkin says.
But, as University of Rochester
economist Dr. Thomas Russell

points out, even strictly cash
customers end up paying for the
convenience of others. "There is
evidence that the use of credit
cards is inflationary — that we
all pay for their use," says Dr.
Russell, author of The
Economics of Bank Credit
Cards.
Dr. Russell believes the cash
customer has, in most cases,
been discriminated against. He
believes it is time to fight back.
"lust remember," he says,
"everyone stands to gain by cash
discounts — except, of course,
the bank card and travel card
corporations. The merchant can
offer you a break in the price of
an item without affecting his
profit margin — in fact it is pos
sible for him to lower the charge
to you and still realize a greater
profit than would be possible
without a charge card sale."
The important thing is not to
be shy: "When the manager or
store owner appears, say to
them: 'What is it worth to you to
receive .cash rather than a dis
countable draft from a credit
card sale?' If the person is in a
decent mood and reasonably in

customers end up paying for the
convenience of others. "There is
evidence that the use of credit
cards is inflationary — that we
all pay for their use," says Dr.
Russell, author of The
Economics of Bank Credit
Cards.
Dr. Russell believes the cash
customer has, in most cases,
been discriminated against. He
believes it is time to fight back.
"lust remember," he says,
"everyone stands to gain by cash
discounts — except, of course,
the bank card and travel card
corporations. The merchant can
offer you a break in the price of
an item without affecting his
profit margin — in fact it is pos
sible for him to lower the charge
to you and still realize a greater
profit than would be possible
without a charge card sale."
The important thing is not to
be shy: "When the manager or
store owner appears, say to
them: 'What is it worth to you to
receive .cash rather than a dis
countable draft from a credit
card sale?' If the person is in a
decent mood and reasonably in
telligent, he or she will realize
that both parties stand to gain
and you'll get your discount,"
Russell contends.
The discount would not be
huge — most likely about two or
three percent — but any amount
off those holiday bills might look
good. And there would be no
worry about paying off future fi
nance charges.
According to consumer advo
cates like Gendel and Russell, it
may be time for consumers to
play their own version of "Let's
Make a Deal."
"Cash," Marshal McLuhan
once said, "is the poor man's
credit card."

the poor man may get the last

SAN FRANCISCO (Pacific
News Service) — As post
holiday bills pile up, Christmas
shoppers who relied on bank
credit cards may find their bank
balances even shorter than ex
pected. And shoppers who paid
cash may have spent more than
they needed to — all because
credit cards have been mistaken
for Santa Claus.
Since they first came into wide
use in the mid-19605, bank cre
dit cards have become virtually
synonymous with cash. Fifty
percent of American households
now use either Master Charge or
BankAmericard, the two major
bank credit cards.
"What most people still do not
realize," says consumer advo
cate Neil Gendel, lawyer for San
Francisco Consumer Action, "is
that every time anyone uses a
bank credit card it costs all of us
money. The cost to the merchant
is simply passed on to his cus
tomers." Gendel thinks people
"should reflect on the whole
credit card way of handling fi
nances."
The most obvious cost is to the
credit card user. "These cards
and the charges made on them
represent loans," Gendel says.
"Loans that just as easily could
be gotten at a bank at a much
lower rate."
For instance, the annual in
terest rate on a bank credit card is
18 percent — and more with
compounded interest if the con
sumer pays over several months.
But bank loans range from only
two or three percent annual in
terest for borrowing against a
savings account, to 12 or 13 per
cent for a regular loan secured
against other collateral. Even an
unsecured loan can be obtained
for 15 percent — still under the
uniform credit card rate.
New Regulations
Partially as a result of efforts
by consumer advocate groups
across the country, the Federal
Reserve Board issued a new set

of regulations for credit cards
just before the Christmas rush, in
late November 1975.
Among the new rules was a
"voluntary" program in which
merchants could offer their cus
tomers discounts for using cash
rather than credit cards— dis
counts which had previously,
been specifically forbidden by
the contracts many credit card
companies offered to merchants.
Since it costs merchants time
and money when customers use
credit cards rather than cash —
those slips you sign in triplicate
are discounted from an average
of about three percent to as much
as 10 percent when a merchant
presents them to a bank — it was
assumed that such cash dis
counts would become com
monplace.
But as it turned out. they were
as rare during the 1975 holiday
season as a pre-Christmas sale.
Under the law. cash discounts
are optional — but if a merchant
offers them at all, he must offer
them to everyone. One problem
may have been that people sim
ply didn't know they could have
asked for cash discounts when
they shopped.
While the Federal Reserve
stipulated that the credit card
companies had to notify con
sumers about some of the new
rules, such as those dealing with
billing errors, the cash discount
provision required no notice.
Not surprisingly the companies
made no effort to publicize it.
A credit card industry
spokesman argues that the pub
lic is more concerned with con
venience than economy. Ken
Larkin, senior vice president for
BankAmericard at the Bank of
America, says that a cash dis
count program won't affect
BankAmericard "one way or the
other. . . We don't have any
quarrel with this type of dis
count," Larkin says.
But, as University of Rochester
economist Dr. Thomas Russell

points out, even strictly cash
customers end up paying for the
convenience of others. "There is
