# Seismologist lectures
## Earthquake prevention must enter building safety codes 
### DAVID NACHMAN 
Dr. Carl Steinbrugge, en
gineering seismologist, opening
the winter quarter of endowed
Harold W. Hoots lectures Mon
day, demanded that the new
generation of engineers must
work not only in their technical
endeavors, but also in the ac
tualization of their ideas into
public policy.
Steinbrugge, presently chair
man of California's Seismic
Safety Commission and a faculty
member of the IJC-Berkeley De
partment of Architecture, has
been involved in legislation for
the prevention of earthquake
damage.
Steinbrugge stressed his view
that modern earthquake
prevention engineering
techniques must be integrated
into current building codes,
such as the recently passed Bill

519 which required hospitals ta
be sufficiently stable to remain
functional during disasters.
He noted, however, that such
standards require prohibitive
costs in design and building.
He said that building code
standards should be made to
protect life and allow for some
property damage. He added that
city water, electricity, and sew
age lifelines should be built con
servatively to handle disasters,
not across fault areas for exam
ple.
He noted that it is impossible
to decide to what stress hospitals
and other emergency buildings
should be built. He said, of fu

ture codes, "If changes can be
made which are right, they'll go
through; but who can say what's
right? It's a subjective problem."
