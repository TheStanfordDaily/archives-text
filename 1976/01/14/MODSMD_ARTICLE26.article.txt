## Globetrotters: 'more popular than Coca Cola' ... as "Tex" Harrison spreads the gospel 
### GEORGE ANDERS 
Somewhere in the more backward parts
of Outer Mongolia, there must be an autis
tic child who actually does not know who
the Harlem Globetrotters are.
But it's only a matter of time before he
too becomes familiar with that unique
blend of a professional basketball team
and a vaudeville touring company that has
made its mark on the rest of the world.
"We're as popular as Coca Cola and hot
dogs. We're like Santa Claus," former
player Charles "Tex" Harrison says.
And Harrison knows what he's talking
about. He put in 21 seasons as a player for
the Globetrotters, retiring two years ago to
do advance publicity work for the team.
'Carry the word'
Now, he says, "1 am to the Globetrotters
what Billy Graham is to evangelism. 1
carry the word."
His saga is one of progress since the
team's start 50 years ago. "Gone are the
days when we would sleep two in a bed in
people's homes," Harrison remarks. "We
don't do that anymore; we stay in luxury
hotels. Gone are the days of riding in the
Model-T Fords and the covered wagons.
The money's a lot better too."
But Harrison says the Globetrotters still
appeal to fans for the same reasons. "We're
going to make 'em happy, we're going to
make them laugh, we'll even make them
forget the frustrations of everyday living."

Most important, "they'll see a group of
fellows do more with a basketball than a
monkey does with a peanut."
On a good night, the Globetrotters can
rattle off their comic stunts with as much
precision as the <JSC marching band.
Harrison explains, though, that "no
thing is choreographed. We know what we
want to do, but we never know when we're
going to do it."
At one time, the Globetrotters used to do
it to whatever local teams they could find
on their tours. Some of these squads, Har
rison recalled, "just weren't good enough
to make for much of a game." Others
would stall "as a means of not letting us do
the show."
Regular losers
So teams like the Washington Generals
were formed to regularly lose to the
Globetrotters.
Except for one night — Jan. 3, 1971 —
when the hired losers won their only game
in the last 12 years. "We really got beat,"
Harrison said, astonishment still in his
voice. "We thought we had a good lead,
and we started doing tricks that caused us
to give up the ball.
"We got carried away with making the
fans fall out of their seats, and forgot to say
'Let's keep up a ten to 12 point lead.' It was
a pretty solemn event."
With his red windbreaker featuring a
"Harlem Globetrotters" emblem, there's

no mistaking Harrison's line of work. The
tall man looks spry enough to return to the
court any time.
Looking back on his playing career, Har
rison recalled the Trotters' contribution to
peace in South America. "In 1956, we had
a four day engagement scheduled for
Lima, Peru. About a week before we got
there, they broke out in a civil war.
"The promoter said to Abe (Saperstein,
then owner of the Globetrotters), 'Mr.
Saperstein, you've got tocancel yourgame
because we don't want crowds gathering.'
While we were there, it got out to the town
that we were there and weren't going to
Play-
Suspended a war
"Do you know that the local factions
suspended the war for four days? We
played basketball, and when we left, they
went right back to fighting."
As present stars get older, Harrison says
the Globetrotters are looking for fresh col
lege talent, and are open to adding a
white player to what has been an all-black
team since 1943.
Looking into the future, Harrison says in
addition to the annual U.S. tours, "we're
negotiating with the State Department for
a trip to mainland Ghina next fall."
Presumably with a quick stopover in
Outer Mongolia.

and a vaudeville touring company that has
made its mark on the rest of the world.
"We're as popular as Coca Cola and hot
dogs. We're like Santa Claus," former
player Charles "Tex" Harrison says.
And Harrison knows what he's talking
about. He put in 21 seasons as a player for
the Globetrotters, retiring two years ago to
do advance publicity work for the team.
'Carry the word'
Now, he says, "1 am to the Globetrotters
what Billy Graham is to evangelism. 1
carry the word."
His saga is one of progress since the
team's start 50 years ago. "Gone are the
days when we would sleep two in a bed in
people's homes," Harrison remarks. "We
don't do that anymore; we stay in luxury
hotels. Gone are the days of riding in the
Model-T Fords and the covered wagons.
The money's a lot better too."
But Harrison says the Globetrotters still
appeal to fans for the same reasons. "We're
going to make 'em happy, we're going to
make them laugh, we'll even make them
forget the frustrations of everyday living."

Most important, "they'll see a group of
fellows do more with a basketball than a
monkey does with a peanut."
On a good night, the Globetrotters can
rattle off their comic stunts with as much
precision as the <JSC marching band.
Harrison explains, though, that "no
thing is choreographed. We know what we
want to do, but we never know when we're
going to do it."
At one time, the Globetrotters used to do
it to whatever local teams they could find
on their tours. Some of these squads, Har
rison recalled, "just weren't good enough
to make for much of a game." Others
would stall "as a means of not letting us do
the show."
Regular losers
So teams like the Washington Generals
were formed to regularly lose to the
Globetrotters.
Except for one night — Jan. 3, 1971 —
when the hired losers won their only game
in the last 12 years. "We really got beat,"
Harrison said, astonishment still in his
voice. "We thought we had a good lead,
and we started doing tricks that caused us
to give up the ball.
"We got carried away with making the
fans fall out of their seats, and forgot to say
'Let's keep up a ten to 12 point lead.' It was
a pretty solemn event."
With his red windbreaker featuring a
"Harlem Globetrotters" emblem, there's

no mistaking Harrison's line of work. The
tall man looks spry enough to return to the
court any time.
Looking back on his playing career, Har
rison recalled the Trotters' contribution to
peace in South America. "In 1956, we had
a four day engagement scheduled for
Lima, Peru. About a week before we got
there, they broke out in a civil war.
"The promoter said to Abe (Saperstein,
then owner of the Globetrotters), 'Mr.
Saperstein, you've got tocancel yourgame
because we don't want crowds gathering.'
While we were there, it got out to the town
that we were there and weren't going to
Play-
Suspended a war
"Do you know that the local factions
suspended the war for four days? We
played basketball, and when we left, they
went right back to fighting."
As present stars get older, Harrison says
the Globetrotters are looking for fresh col
lege talent, and are open to adding a
white player to what has been an all-black
team since 1943.
Looking into the future, Harrison says in
addition to the annual U.S. tours, "we're
negotiating with the State Department for
a trip to mainland Ghina next fall."
Presumably with a quick stopover in
Outer Mongolia.

GLOBETROTTER—Former Harlen Globetrotter Charles "Tex" Harrison remembers the days when
the Trotters were forced to sleep in homes and travel by horse cart. The team, now in its 50th year,
has come a long way since then.

of Outer Mongolia, there must be an autis
