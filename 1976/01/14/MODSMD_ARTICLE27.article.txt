# Pauley: the house that John built
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
You run out of adjectives try
ing to describe UCLA's basket
ball teams over the past decade.
So we'll let the Bruins' record
at Pauley Pavilion since its
grand opening in 1965 speak for
itself.
UCLA has won 159 and lost
but two, including streaks of 51,
17 and currently 91 straight vic
tories. Only USC has been able to
blemish Pauley's record, with
slim upsets in 1969 and 1970.
Needless to say, first-year
Coach Gene Bartow's boys plan
to make Stanford and California
victims number 92 and 93 this
weekend. The Cards broke a 17-
game losing streak to the Bruins
at Maples last year, but it will

probably take another miracle if
they arc to turn the trick on the
road.
Come close
Stanford has, however, come
close at Pauley, most notably
three years ago, when it took a
patented John Wooden com
eback from a 7-point halftime de
ficit for the Bruins to prevail
51-45.
Center Tim Patterson, a
freshman on that team, will be
playing his fourth game and
final at UCLA this weekend.
"Once you get in the game, there
isn't any difference" between
Pauley and any other court he
noted.
Captain Ed Schweitzer and
Coach Dick Dißiaso concurred

that there really isn't any apprec
iable difference. But sophomore
guard Jay Carter admitted to
being "a little awed" when he
first walked onto the floor last
year. "Once you 're into the game
though, it's just like any other
court," Carter added.
Not intimidating
Schweitzer conceded that
UCLA has a home court advan
tage like most other teams, but
did not consider playing there to
be psychologically intimidating.
However, the senior forward
pointed out that the Bruins may
benefit psychologically because
"they like to play at home in
front of their fans." And from a
coaching standpoint, the home
court advantage makes even
more sense now that the NCAA
has restricted basketball travel
ing squads to 10 players.
But Patterson related a story
about his brother Steve, center
on UCLA's 1970 and 1971
championship squads, which

indicate that the Bruins may not
know how good they have it.
Watching Tim play in UCLA's
51-45 comeback win, graduate
Steve later related that he never
realized what it was like for a
visiting team to play in front of a
Bruin crowd.
Dißiaso, an assistant coach at
Notre Dame when the Irish
snapped UCLA's record 88-
game win skein, pointed to
crowd enthusiasm," as one of
the reasons for UCLA's home
court dominance."
Schweitzer agreed, adding
such descriptions as "loud, hos
tile and cocky," but was quick to
add that there was no compari
son between Pauley, crowds and
the "violent" fans at Oregon's in
famous Mac Arthur Court.
Schweitzer admitted to being
aware of the fan noise, especially
in a close game, but said that it
can get so loud at Pauley that he
could "put it out of my mind
completely."

Despite the fact that Pauley
seats 12,800 for most games, half
again as big as Maples, the Pavil
ion may even seem larger than it
is. Pauley's floor space is 126 feet
by 226 feet, dwarfing Maples'
173 foot by 105 foot surface.
The teams' past record has
also led to the Bruins playing at
home more than their share of
the time including 11 of 13 non
conference games this season.
Besides the loss to Indiana on a
"neutral" court, the Bruins
travel to South Bend later this
month to give Notre Dame a
chance to revenge Bruins' loss at
Pauley.
The Bruins' home court ad
vantage may be extremely im
portant this year if the first
weekend's conference results
are an indication of the competi
tion that the-Bruin's will have to
contend with. Any Pac-8 team
which goes undefeated at home
may be on its way to the NCAA
regional play-offs.

JOHN'S PLACE—UCLA has run up a string of 91 consecutive wins
in Pauley Pavilion since their last home loss to USC in 1970. All
but ten of the wins were earned under former Bruin boss Johnny
Wooden, who is seen here being honored on his 25th anniversary
at UCLA.

JOHN'S PLACE—UCLA has run up a string of 91 consecutive wins
in Pauley Pavilion since their last home loss to USC in 1970. All
but ten of the wins were earned under former Bruin boss Johnny
Wooden, who is seen here being honored on his 25th anniversary
at UCLA.
You run out of adjectives try
ing to describe UCLA's basket
ball teams over the past decade.
So we'll let the Bruins' record
at Pauley Pavilion since its
grand opening in 1965 speak for
itself.
UCLA has won 159 and lost
but two, including streaks of 51,
17 and currently 91 straight vic
tories. Only USC has been able to
blemish Pauley's record, with
slim upsets in 1969 and 1970.
Needless to say, first-year
Coach Gene Bartow's boys plan
to make Stanford and California
victims number 92 and 93 this
weekend. The Cards broke a 17-
game losing streak to the Bruins
at Maples last year, but it will

probably take another miracle if
they arc to turn the trick on the
road.
Come close
Stanford has, however, come
close at Pauley, most notably
three years ago, when it took a
patented John Wooden com
eback from a 7-point halftime de
ficit for the Bruins to prevail
51-45.
Center Tim Patterson, a
freshman on that team, will be
playing his fourth game and
final at UCLA this weekend.
"Once you get in the game, there
isn't any difference" between
Pauley and any other court he
noted.
Captain Ed Schweitzer and
Coach Dick Dißiaso concurred

that there really isn't any apprec
iable difference. But sophomore
guard Jay Carter admitted to
being "a little awed" when he
first walked onto the floor last
year. "Once you 're into the game
though, it's just like any other
court," Carter added.
Not intimidating
Schweitzer conceded that
UCLA has a home court advan
tage like most other teams, but
did not consider playing there to
be psychologically intimidating.
However, the senior forward
pointed out that the Bruins may
benefit psychologically because
"they like to play at home in
front of their fans." And from a
coaching standpoint, the home
court advantage makes even
more sense now that the NCAA
has restricted basketball travel
ing squads to 10 players.
But Patterson related a story
about his brother Steve, center
on UCLA's 1970 and 1971
championship squads, which

indicate that the Bruins may not
know how good they have it.
Watching Tim play in UCLA's
51-45 comeback win, graduate
Steve later related that he never
realized what it was like for a
visiting team to play in front of a
Bruin crowd.
Dißiaso, an assistant coach at
Notre Dame when the Irish
snapped UCLA's record 88-
game win skein, pointed to
crowd enthusiasm," as one of
the reasons for UCLA's home
court dominance."
Schweitzer agreed, adding
such descriptions as "loud, hos
tile and cocky," but was quick to
add that there was no compari
son between Pauley, crowds and
the "violent" fans at Oregon's in
famous Mac Arthur Court.
Schweitzer admitted to being
aware of the fan noise, especially
in a close game, but said that it
can get so loud at Pauley that he
could "put it out of my mind
completely."

Despite the fact that Pauley
seats 12,800 for most games, half
again as big as Maples, the Pavil
ion may even seem larger than it
is. Pauley's floor space is 126 feet
by 226 feet, dwarfing Maples'
173 foot by 105 foot surface.
The teams' past record has
also led to the Bruins playing at
home more than their share of

Schweitzer agreed, adding
such descriptions as "loud, hos
tile and cocky," but was quick to
add that there was no compari
son between Pauley, crowds and
the "violent" fans at Oregon's in
famous Mac Arthur Court.
Schweitzer admitted to being
aware of the fan noise, especially
in a close game, but said that it
can get so loud at Pauley that he
could "put it out of my mind
completely."

Despite the fact that Pauley
seats 12,800 for most games, half
again as big as Maples, the Pavil
ion may even seem larger than it
is. Pauley's floor space is 126 feet
by 226 feet, dwarfing Maples'
173 foot by 105 foot surface.
The teams' past record has
also led to the Bruins playing at
home more than their share of
the time including 11 of 13 non
conference games this season.
Besides the loss to Indiana on a
"neutral" court, the Bruins
travel to South Bend later this
month to give Notre Dame a
chance to revenge Bruins' loss at
Pauley.
The Bruins' home court ad
vantage may be extremely im
portant this year if the first
weekend's conference results
are an indication of the competi
tion that the-Bruin's will have to
contend with. Any Pac-8 team
which goes undefeated at home
may be on its way to the NCAA
regional play-offs.

JOHN'S PLACE—UCLA has run up a string of 91 consecutive wins
in Pauley Pavilion since their last home loss to USC in 1970. All
but ten of the wins were earned under former Bruin boss Johnny
Wooden, who is seen here being honored on his 25th anniversary
at UCLA.
