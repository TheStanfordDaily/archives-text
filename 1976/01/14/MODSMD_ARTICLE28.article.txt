# The 						net result
## An open letter 
### Mike Tollin 
The Sports Information Director at Cliveden
State University was a bit lax when it came to
basketball publicity. Thus, for us refugees in the
Mother Country it was a bit difficult to follow the
exploits of the main campus' hoopsters. We kept
hearing strange rumors. For instance, someone
told us the Stanford head coach was now jumping
off the bench, causing referees to signal "Tea"
even when it wasn't 4 p.m., and no longer dozing
off during jump balls ("That is still Howie, isn't
it?" we asked incredulously). And then we got
word that the assistant coach once played with
Julius Erving, but that the only thing "The Doc
tor" taught him was a New Yawk accent. (We got
hold of a picture and we knew it wasn't Bub,
when we saw the Brooks Brothers special.) And
finally the news filtered in that the team's start
ing center was becoming famous as part of a new
trivia question: "What 6-foot-ll college player
has a brother who went from the best college
team in history to the worst professional team of
the day, via Cleveland? ("You mean," we gasped,
"Tom Boerwinkle is Rich Kelley's brother?")
Back to Maples
Amid all this, most Stanfordites-in-Britain de
cided to stay in their niche by the Thames for
another three months of pubbing. But some of us
were getting so desperate to see a sport again
where participants could use their hands, that we
opted for the hard benches of Maples Pavilion
instead of the soft, cushioned seats of Berkshire's
The King Arm's. The following open letter is
written for the benefit of those still at Cliveden,
and is intended to be read with a bitter in hand:
We got back just in time for the start of some
thing we all know and love, Pacific Eight basket
ball. But just when we were starting to get ex
cited, people would stop us on thestreet and say,
"Didn't you hear, Stanford is only 4-6." "Hah,"
we shrugged. "Must be neophytes. Everyone
knows those exhibition . . . er sorry Pete Rozelle,
pre-season . . . games don't mean anything."
As one astute basketball critic said, "You can
throw all the record books out the window now.
These games are for all the marbles. On any given
weekend , .
It was then discovered that Mr. Astute Basket
ball Critic used to work for The Stanford Daily
and he was dispatched with instructions to
memorize the contents of Chris Schenkel's
Greatest Moments in Sports.
We arrived at Maples early Friday night to
familiarize ourselves with the Stanford lineup.
"Oh. there really are some new faces," we
exclaimed. And to our further astonishment,
most of the seats in the arena were being filled up
with bodies. By the end of Saturday night. Sports
Information Director Gary Cavalli had counted
up 12,566 ticket stubs and UCLA wasn't even
within 800 miles of thecampus. Saturday night's
7020 total was the largest Maples crowd ever to
see a non-California team play Stanford, and the
weekend aggregate far surpassed past gatherings
with the Evergreen Staters. One overrexuberant
sportscaster on the KZSU Sports Network, even
went so far as to compare the crowd to that of
Mac Arthur Pit, that noted Northwestern bastion
of insanity, and while he may have gotten a bit

carried away, Joe Ruetz did report Saturday night
that he heard three or four Stanford students
chanting "dee-fense, dee-fense." (Unfortunately,
an investigation later proved they were only try
ing to gather support for the reinstatement of
James Schlesinger.)
Nevertheless, there was an air of expectancy
around here last weekend. There is a New Re
gime after all gang, and people wanted to see its
Pac-8 debut.
So I guess now you want to know what hap
pened. All right, I'm getting to that. We were
beaten twice on our own home court, but Coach
Dick Dißiaso said last week that the Pac-8 champ
would be the team that could win on the road,
so there's no reason to fret, right? We'll bedown
to visit UCLA and USC this weekend and
well . . .remember what Mr. Critic said.
12 games ahead
Astute also told us that the last time UCLA lost
at Pauley Pavilion, Wolfe Perry cheered for USC
in diapers. And aftersome quick computation, he
decided that with 12 Pac-8 games ahead of us,
two more in Hawaii, and a game at home against
UC-Davis, a 5-22 record looms ahead for Stan
ford. "I think that's what they mean by keeping
athletics in perspective," he said. (Mr. Critic was
then told to go bother California, which also has
two home losses.)
Between you and me, gang, 1 think he's got
another thing coming. Sure we're in a hole now
and no one around here is talking about champ
ionships, but Stanford is worth watching, I tell
you. I like this fellow Dißiaso and I like the way
his team plays.
Coming back from a first half in which they
were as cold as Nanook of the North, and a 14-
point second half deficit, Stanford missed send
ing WSU into overtime by a single basket.
Despite the two losses, I think the fans some
how came away satisfied this past weekend.
Whereas in past years Stanford seemed to lose
games it should have won, I think they're playing
up to their potential this year, and I think people
around here realize that. Compared to the rest of
the Pac-8, their overall talent and experience is
limited, and they made some crucial mistakes
Friday and Saturday nights — like not getting
back quick enough to defense the fast break —
that exhibited this. But when you watch George
Schader backing his way in for one of his
patented short jumpers, or Wolfe Perry diving for
balls that some players wouldn't even consider
loose, you know they're giving all they have, and
you know they'll make their presence felt sooner
or later.
Dißiaso likes to use the word "intensity" in
describing his style. It has become the symbol of
the New Regime and has even caused one San
Francisco scribe to draw a comparison between
Dißiaso's brand of coaching and that of Dick Har
ter. That doesn't mean "dirty" basketball. It
means hustling, scrappy, exciting basketball, the
kind that fills arenas.
Take it from me, gang. Everything you heard
was true. So spread the word, okay?
Wish you were here.
