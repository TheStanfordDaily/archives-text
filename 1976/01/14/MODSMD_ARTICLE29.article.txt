49ers name coach
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
Monte Clark, ah assistant coach
with the Miami Dolphins for five
years, was named head coach of
the San Francisco 49ers yester
day to replace the recently fired
Dick Nolan.
At 38, Clark will be the
youngest coach in the National
Football League today.
Clark, a top NFL lineman for
11 years, started his pro career as
a defensive lineman with the
49ers in 1959 after being drafted
from USC. He later played for
Dallas and Cleveland, where he
was the starting offensive right
tackle in four title games.
He has been offensive line
coach at Miami since 1970 and
was in charge of the offense there
for the past two years. He super

vised a rushing game that led the
American Football Conference
three times and set an NFL rush
ing record in 1972. Lack of a con
sistent offense was one of the
main weaknesses of the 49ers,
5-9 last season.

MIXING IT UP—Stanford forwards George Schader(22)and Ed
Schweitzer(44) battle for a rebound in the Cards' 87-81 loss to
Washington last weekend. Schweitzer is second in Pacific Eight
rebounding statistics with an 11.2 average and Schader is tenth
with an 8.3 average. The pair is one reason why the Cards lead
the league in rebounding percentage with a .557 mark.
