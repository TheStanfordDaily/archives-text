Arabs demand Israel withdrawal
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. — Arab diplomats addressing
the U.N. Security Council yesterday demanded that Israel
withdraw from all bccupied Arab land and that a Palesti
nian homeland be established.
Ambassadors from Egypt, Syria, Jordan and the United
Arab Emirates took the podium in the second day of the
council's Middle East debate, which Israel is boycotting
because the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is
taking part.
Syrian Ambassador Mouaffak Allaf charged that Israel's
"Zionist-racist regime" has not carried out a 1947 General
Assembly resolution that would partition Palestine into
Arab and Jewish states.
He said Israel also has ignored a 1948 resolution provid
ing that Palestinians displaced by Israel should be permit
ted to return to their homes or receive compensation.
Egypt called for an early resumption of the suspended
Geneva peace conference with the PLO participating on
ah equal footing with the other parties.
Egyptian Ambassador A. Esmat Abdel Meguid said an
invitation for the PLO to attend any new Geneva talks
should be pressed "once the Security Council has recog
nized the national rights of the Palestinian people."
Lebanese conflict escalates
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Moslem forces escalated a "famine
war" yesterday, blockading Christian villages in an at
tempt to force Christian gunmen to lift a week-long siege
of Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut.
At the same time, firemen brought under control a huge
fire that had raged in three warehouses in Beirut's port,
and fighting swirled downtown and elsewhere in the
country, leaving 53 persons killed and 107 wounded, with
many more uncounted in battle areas.
The casualty toll in Lebanon's civil war stood at more
than 8000 dead and about 25,000 wounded since last
April. The Egyptian government in Cairo asked the Arab
League's secretary-general, Mahmoud Riad, to take urgent
steps to end the fighting.
A Moslem spokesman said his side would lift its bloc
kade in the "famine war" as soon as the Christians lifted
theirs on three Palestinian camps in Christian-controlled
territory around Beirut.
The Moslems are fighting for political and economic
reforms in Christian-dominated Lebanon, but the Christ
ians insist reforms can only come after the Palestinians are
reigned in.
Wider Angola involvement
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Wider American and
Soviet involvement in war-torn Angola was predicted by
African diplomats yesterday following failure of the Or
ganization of African Unity to agree on a peace plan for the
divided country.
The White House reacted to the OAU stalemate with an
announcement that President Ford will ask Congress
when it returns from vacation next week to lift a ban on
U.S. assistance to Angola.
Leaders of all three Angolan factions said they were
ready to prolong their civil war indefinitely, and in a
dispatch from the Angolan capital of Luanda, the Yugos
lav news agency Tanjug reported heavy fighting in prog
ress in Benguela, Lumbago and Port Mocamedes.
White House press secretary Ron Nessen said that de

spite the plan to ask Congress to lift the aid ban, "The
President still feels the best solution is a series of goals he
set.
"These are cease-fire, an end of all foreign intervention,
a withdrawal of all foreign forces and a government of
national unity in Angola."
Belfast violence continues
BELFAST — A powerful bomb exploded in a crowded
Belfast shopping arcade yesterday, killing four persons
and wounding 20, authorities said.
The blast came hours after Protestant and Catholic
militants rejected Britain's latest bid to find a political
solution to end the civil war in Northern Ireland.
The bomb exploded without warning in a hardware
store, killing two men and two women. One of the dead
was blown through a wall and landed 50 yards away in a
car park.
It was the first fatal bombing in Northern Ireland this
year. It brought the number of deaths since Jan. 1 to 23 and
the toll since the violence began in 1969 to at least 1413.
Britain refused Monday night to bow to the demands of
the Protestant majority in the province for a return to
majority rule there.
Majority rule in Northern Ireland was suspended nearly
four years ago when the British government took over
direct rule in the province because of worsening violence.
McCloskey blasts Reagan
DAYTON, Ohio — The nomination of Ronald Reagan
for president could mean "the demise of the Republican
party," according to U.S. Rep. Paul N. McCloskey (R-
Calif.).
"When Reagan became governor of California, it
marked the demise of the Republican party in California,"
McCloskey told a news conference Monday at the Univer
sity of Dayton, where he later spoke on domestic affairs.
"He (Reagan) insisted that the only Republicans who
can be accepted into the party are the conservatives,"
McCloskey said.
During Reagan's governorship, Republicans lost two
U.S. Senate seats and control of the state legislature,
McCloskey said.
Grammy nominations vary
LOS ANGELES — In a significant swing away from rock
music, the 18th annual Grammy Award nominations
spread across a wide spectrum of popular song yesterday,
from country ballads to Broadway show tunes.
The songs which garnered the most nominations were
an upbeat pop love song, "Love Will Keep Us Together"
and a country ballad, "Rhinestone Cowboy." Each was
nominated in three categories including record of the year
and song of the year.
Officials of the National Academy of Recording Arts
and Sciences said the varied choice of nominees indicated
a trend back to music "that can be hummed by every
body."
