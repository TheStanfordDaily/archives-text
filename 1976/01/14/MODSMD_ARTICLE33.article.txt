# Faculty slow to unionize
## 
### MARK NASSUTTI 
Although unionization of faculties
has spread to one out of seven colleges
and universities across the country,
administrators here have seen little ef
fort to introduce collective bargaining
to the University.
According to an article in Change
magazine, co-authored by J. Victor
Baldridge, assistant vice-president for
academic affairs at Cal State-Fresno
and former Stanford professor, collec
tive bargaining is "a natural
decision-making process" with "no
inherent capacity for either harm or
good."
"Clearly, unions may help to raise
personnel standards, especially in in
stitutions where professional prac
tices, peer judgments and faculty
rights have not gained a foothold," the
article says.
"Probably their most positive func
tion is to support reasonable and fair
personnel practices in institutions
weak in those areas," it notes.
Stanford has seen relatively little
union activity among faculty. Vice

Provost for Faculty Affairs Arthur
Bienenstock commented, "I know of
several individual faculty members
who would support unionization but 1
know of no concerted effort to un
ionize."
According to the Baldridge article,
12 percent of all professional staff and
20 percent of fulltime faculty are rep
resented by unions. Seven out of 10
faculty members surveyed indicated
that they would favor a collective bar
gaining agent on their campuses.
A number of negative consequences,
however, may offset any positive ef
fects, the article points out. In struggl
ing for their members' job security, un
ions may harm the traditional process
of peer evaluations based on subjective
criteria. Their thrust toward overly
specific, objective criteria may tend to
encourage "promotion and tenure by
default" rather than by merit, and this
in turn may reduce the quality of the
profession.
"The price for job security may be a
system hamstrung by burgeoning
bureaucracy, rigid rules and proce
dures, and constant grievance ac

tions." the article says.
"In the process, students may find
their hard-earned role in campus gov
ernance severely challenged. Unions,
formed to fight administration
bureaucratization and the centraliza
tion of power will themselves generate
substantial amounts of red tape and
concentrated control," according to
the article.
ASSU Vice President Charlotte
Germane, said, "A teachers' union
wouldn't help student input at all. It
would probably force the students to
form a student union, as Amherst has
done, which would put the students
on an equal footing with faculty, but
the system is very difficult to organize
and has its problems.
"I'd say I was against faculty un
ions."
In spite of all the drawbcks, says
Baldridge's article," "We anticipate
that faculties across the nation will be
in better shape because of unioniza
tion. There will be greater procedural
protection for faculty promotions and
tenure, less arbitrariness about ad
ministrative decisions, more job sec
urity and protection for non-teaching
professionals, and better economics
security all around.
"These benefits will apply even
to those faculties that do not unionize,
since trustees and administrators on
these campuses can be expected to
make concessions to ward off the
threat of unionization."

tive bargaining is "a natural
decision-making process" with "no
inherent capacity for either harm or
good."
"Clearly, unions may help to raise
personnel standards, especially in in
stitutions where professional prac
tices, peer judgments and faculty
rights have not gained a foothold," the
article says.
"Probably their most positive func
tion is to support reasonable and fair
personnel practices in institutions
weak in those areas," it notes.
Stanford has seen relatively little
union activity among faculty. Vice

Provost for Faculty Affairs Arthur
Bienenstock commented, "I know of
several individual faculty members
who would support unionization but 1
know of no concerted effort to un
ionize."
According to the Baldridge article,
12 percent of all professional staff and
20 percent of fulltime faculty are rep
resented by unions. Seven out of 10
faculty members surveyed indicated
that they would favor a collective bar
gaining agent on their campuses.
A number of negative consequences,
however, may offset any positive ef
fects, the article points out. In struggl
ing for their members' job security, un
ions may harm the traditional process
of peer evaluations based on subjective
criteria. Their thrust toward overly
specific, objective criteria may tend to
encourage "promotion and tenure by
default" rather than by merit, and this
in turn may reduce the quality of the
profession.
"The price for job security may be a
system hamstrung by burgeoning
bureaucracy, rigid rules and proce
dures, and constant grievance ac

tions." the article says.
"In the process, students may find
their hard-earned role in campus gov
ernance severely challenged. Unions,
formed to fight administration
bureaucratization and the centraliza
tion of power will themselves generate
substantial amounts of red tape and
concentrated control," according to
the article.
ASSU Vice President Charlotte
Germane, said, "A teachers' union
wouldn't help student input at all. It
would probably force the students to
form a student union, as Amherst has
done, which would put the students
on an equal footing with faculty, but
the system is very difficult to organize
and has its problems.
"I'd say I was against faculty un
ions."
In spite of all the drawbcks, says
Baldridge's article," "We anticipate
that faculties across the nation will be
in better shape because of unioniza
tion. There will be greater procedural
protection for faculty promotions and
tenure, less arbitrariness about ad
ministrative decisions, more job sec
urity and protection for non-teaching
professionals, and better economics
security all around.
"These benefits will apply even
to those faculties that do not unionize,
since trustees and administrators on
these campuses can be expected to
make concessions to ward off the
threat of unionization."
Although unionization of faculties
has spread to one out of seven colleges
and universities across the country,
administrators here have seen little ef
fort to introduce collective bargaining
to the University.
