CORRECTIONS
A story in the Jan. 7 Daily incorrectly
stated that the Guest Professorship
Board had "invited"former President
Richard Nixon and several other per
sonalities to serve as ASSU guest pro
fessors. In fact, the persons mentioned
were merely being sounded out as to
their availability. They were not "in
vited."
In yesterday's edition, the Daily in
correctly listed a new member of the
ASSU Nominations Committee as "Ju
lian" Schwartz. His name is Jordan
Schwartz.
