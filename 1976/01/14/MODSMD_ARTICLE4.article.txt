# Committee seeks 'Super Dean'
## Dean's role expanded 
### KEVIN CHILDRESS 
The qualifications for the new vice
provost/dean of undergraduate studies
may be so demanding that he should
be called "Super Dean," according to a
member of the search committee
which is formulating a list of candi
dates for thai post.
The new dean will replace James
Gibbs, the first and only dean of un
dergraduate studies, who will step
down this year.
No names were considered at the
meeting held last night; it was de
signed only as a means for public input
on the new administrator's qualifica
tions.
The dean's role has been expanded
to include that of vice provost starting
next year, in the hope that he will gain
more accessibility to Provost William
Miller and thereby function with more
proximity to the circles of University
power, according to the members of
the Committee on Undergraduate

Studies (C-US) which recommended
the expansion.
'More clout'
As one member of C-US put it, the
move was aimed to give the dean
"more clout." Chairman Gordon
Wright followed by quoting Gibbs as
saying that "the dean must be able to
say no to the provost once in a while."
According to the guests' and mem
bers' expressed hopes, the new dean
should:
—recognize "the unbelievably high
amount undergraduates pay and see
that they're getting their money's
worth";
—attend faculty meetings and "ask
them what they've done lately for the
students," prompting the need, ac
cording to Asst. Political Science Prof.
Nan Keohane, for "gall and guts";
—have excellent rapport with ad
ministration. faculty and students and
should "take the initiative" in achiev
ing these; and

—encourage faculty and students
alike to approach him with ideas, then
have the assertiveness and tenacity to
try to get them implemented.
Will stili teach
Wright also expressed the commit
tee's hope that the dean, who is to be
selected from tenured faculty mem
bers, will continue to teach "at least
one class."
Because of the long list of require
ments. mutterings were heard that
perhaps Henry Kissinger should be of
fered the job.
Despite the high standards, Wright
told the Daily that "we should find a
few who fit the bill."
The committee's last date for accept
ing nominations is Jan. 23; it has
until late February to submit a list to
Miller, who is to make the final choice.
Anyone interested may make a nomi
nation for consideration by writing the
committee or speaking to one of its
members.
