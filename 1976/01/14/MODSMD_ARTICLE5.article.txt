# 'Western culture' requirement urged
## 
### RICK CHRISTIAN 
All future Stanford undergraduates
will be required to take one of several
three-quarter course sequences in
Western culture if the Faculty Senate
heeds the recommendations filed by
the Committee on the Reform and Re
newal of Undergraduate Education at
Stanford (CORRES).
The committee also urged the Uni
versity to develop honors programs
which would encourage students to
get a broad background in liberal
studies.
The CORRES recommendations
were issued in a report to Halsey
Royden, dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences and released
to the Daily yesterday.
"It is just possible that the new
graduation requirements may be oper
ational for next year's freshman class,"
Royden said. He pointed out that con
tinuing students would not be affected
by the probable change.

"The new requirements would be
full of 'grandfather clauses' which
would enable a student to graduate
under the rules in effect when he en
tered" Royden said.
Before the report reaches the Faculty
Senate, it will be sent to two other fa
culty committees for further study.
Royden said, "I expect that the merits
of the report will be debated, sifted and
refined to provide a framework in
order to move ahead."
CORRES members worked on the
report for six months and unanim
ously agreed on the desirability of a
Western culture requirement. The
three courses would be required in ad
dition to the present distribution and
writing requirements.
According to the report, "The re
commendation to add to the present
requirements, with the implications
that such a recommendation has for all
students and many faculty, was made
only because the need seems so great.
'Informational background'
"The University must introduce
students to new areas, ideas and
works, while also providing them with
the general informational background
and cultural vocabulary of the tradi
tion from which almost all of them
come."
"There is a feeling that the Univer
sity has certain responsibilities to stu
dents to convey what it thinks is criti
cal in Western tradition," said Asst.
Religious Studies Prof. Lee Yearley,
CORRES chairman.
Although the requirement was de
signed to allow as much freedom as
possible to the students, Electrical En
gineering Prof. James Gibbons expres
sed his concern that it may be too re
strictive in its proposed form. He said
courses in Asian or Eastern culture
i ;ould be equally useful in fulfilling the
requirement.
Gibbons said the requirement was
not intended to be limiting. If the stu
dents feel limited by the requirement,
the courses will simply become a
noose around the neck, he said.
The process
The report notedthat the committee
used a variety of means to reach its
recommendations. In addition to ex
pressing their own views, CORRES
members examined transcripts,

gathered enrollment figures for vari
ous courses, consulted various chair
persons and talked with Dean of Ad
missions Fred Hargadon.
Hargadon reported that he had con
tacted students who chose to attend
schools such as Yale and Princeton
rather than Stanford.
"Many expressed their concern over
Stanford's commitment to under
graduate education. A number replied
that it appeared Stanford gave more
attention to graduate students than
undergraduate," Hargadon said.
That observation is "part myth and
part truth,"he said, agreeing that Stan
ford's undergraduate program could
use "all the help it can get."
