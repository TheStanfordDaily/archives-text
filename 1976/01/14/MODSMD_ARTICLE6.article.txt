# Labor secretary quits over veto
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Secretary of
Labor John Dunlop submitted his res
ignation to President Ford late yester
day, informed sources said, doing so
because he felt his effectiveness had
been undermined when Ford reneged
on a promise to sign a bill sought by
organized labor.
The sources said the President, in a
private White House meeting, tried to
talk Dunlop out of quitting. The sec
retary held firm in his decision to res
ign, but said he would remain in his
post until Jan. 31.
The formal announcement of the
resignation is expected today.
White House officials confirmed
that Ford and Dunlop met for 35 mi
nutes, but they refused to provide de
tails.
Press Secretary Ron Nessen, under
questioning by reporters, acknow
ledged in the early evening that Dun

lop had asked to meet with Ford.
"It was a private meeting. 1 can't say
anything more," Nessen said.
Speculation on a successor to Dun
lop has focused on W.J. Usery Jr., di
rector of the Federal Mediation Ser
vice, who is held in high regard by
both labor and management.
Dunlop's resignation had been ex
pected since Ford announced before
Christmas that he would veto a bill
which would have increased
construction-site picketing power for
unions.
Dunlop supported the legislation
and had earlier won Ford's endorse
ment of it.
When he vetoed the bill, Ford con
ceded it had contained everything he
asked for when he promised to sign it.
But he said he changed his mind, say
ing it would lead to chaos in the con
struction industry.
