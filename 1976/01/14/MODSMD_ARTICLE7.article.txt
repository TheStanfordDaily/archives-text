# COSS debates employer ban
## 
### LORI MATSUKAWA 
The Committee on Services to Stu
dents (COSS) is still "up in the air"
about whether job recruiters and
employers who use the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center (CPPC)
should be banned for discriminating
against homosexuals in hiring, accord
ing to committee chairman Pan
Poston.
Poston said a COSS meeting yester
day was spent "discussing some form
of positive statement we could make
about discrimination on sexual prefer
ence and whether (discriminating)
employers should be banned from
using the CPPC."
"We hope to offer an opinion toPres
ident Lyman two weeks from tomor
row," said Poston.
Assoc. History Prof. Barton Berns
tein, a COSS member, said there is
some "dispute" among committee
members as to whether the CPPC
should "require companies, within n
certain period of time, to come up with

a statement of their hiring policy."
Frank Riddle, associate controllei in
the accounting office, said, "My per
sonal feelings are more towards what
would be accomplished (by banning
discriminatory employers) and the
impact it would have on University
funding."
In a letter sent to all COSS members,
Riddle wrote about the financial im
pact of a discrimination proposal.
"As an example, take the military. If
the military were banned (from re
cruiting through the CPPC) we would
lose a considerable number of gov
ernment contracts and grants. Many of
them require active military recruit
ment on campus," said Kiddle. "A lot
of principal workers would not be able
to benefit from these grants."
Said Poston, "It's just his opinion. 1
don't think it will play an important
part in the final decision."
"We're having two opinions written
up. A vote will be taken to determine
the majority and minority views,"
Poston said.
There are two COSS meetings plan
ned before the presentation of the
statement to President Lyman.
Richard Thomas, community rela
tions director for the Cay People's
Union (CPU), said the anti
discrimination policy of the CPPC
should include "sexual orientation."
The CPPC currently prohibits
employers who discriminate on the
basis of race, creed, sex or national ori
gin from using the facility.
"1 doubt that the COSS proposal will
be like the CPU proposal," said
Thomas, referring to an October letter
addressed to COSS from the GPU. The
purpose of the GPU proposal was to
"encourage employers to examine
their employment policies and to cor
rect present injustices," not to bar cer
tain employers from using the center.
Thomas said the Law Placement Of
fice now faces the same situation
The Dec. 11 issue of The Law School
Journal reported then-Dean Thomas
Ehrlich as saying the University
should not be a "monitor of the ration
ality" of law lorms whose hiring
policies discriminate according to
sexual preference.
