Let me attempt some brief re
sponses to Joy Adler's Jan. 7
Daily column "Library maze."
The "Furies" which deter
mine the location of Adler's
psychology books are the re
quests of faculty, students and
•ranch libraries, all of whom
would, like to have their mate
rials at the most convenient loca-
Iton for them, plus the fact that
psychology" is an aspect com
mon to many disciplines — e.g.
education, medicine, history,
political science.
The card file called Serial Re
ords is being kept up to date on
a daily basis by a hard-working,
understaffed crew of seven, who
iiandle over 100,000 records a
year (30,000 current titles) in a
small, cramped space. A pub
lished version is issued every
few years.
Serial record-keeping has al
ways been one of the most com
plicated, controversial aspects of
library maintenance.
Expensive
The Main Library catalog
would be a vastly expensive and
complicated tool which would
dwarf its present size if it at
tempted to list fully all the lib
rary holdings on caifipus. The
catalog does contain one author
card for each title cataloged by
(he separately administered lib
raries (Hoover, Jackson, Law,
l .ane, Food Research and SLAC).
Because they are separately
administered, their author en
tries often do not mesh with
tnose in the Main Catalog. The
University cannot support the
costs of trying to integrate them
completely into the Main
Catalog, or to list their holdings
by subject or title.
If Stanford had not switched to
the Library of Congress (LC)
classification in 1965, but had
rontinued to use its unique, in
creasingly unwieldy modifica
lions of the Dewey classification,
Adler would be even more dis
mayed by library inefficiency.
Among other considerations,
use of LC allows us to quickly
itilize cataloging already done
i »y the Library of Congress for 80
percent of the current books
ataloged by Stanford. Much of
his material is cataloged using
magnetic tapes received from
r he Library of Congress and pro
-messed through our com
puterized system, BALLOTS.
Computer file
With BALLOTS we are build
i ;ig still another file of on-line
bibliographical citations which
an be retrieved through author,
; itie, subject, call number of LC
card number. The file can also
■ell BALLOTS users wherein the
library system a given book is at
ilie time.
If the money were available,
ihere would be terminals for
client use, and students would
have direct access to that infor
mation; as it is. the library staff
itself needs more terminals.
Money is also the reason we
vere not able to go back and re
classify all those older books in
Dewey. In the opinion of the
faculty-student committee
which approved the change, re
trospective change would be
prohibitively expensive.
Few large libraries which have
switched from Dewey to LC —
and there have been many in re
c mt years — have attempted re
trospective reclassification.
On same floor
We have, however, tried to
keep the same subjects on the
same floor ol the stack whenever
possible. For example, the 100s
nd 200s of Dewey (psychology,
philosophy and religion) and

Karin Eckelmeyer

LC's B class for the same subjects
are on the first level near each
other.
Those cards for "Stack" books,
which are not stamped "Stack,"
derive from days long past when
locations were recorded on the
verso (the back) of the card.
When that cumbersome sys
tem was changed, retrospective
stamping by that time was out of
the question — moneyagain. But
at least one knew that even
though the front of the card
didn't say so, the book was in the
stack.
There came, however, the in
evitable: a rapidly growing stack
collection. Where would we
shelve the books? The stacks are
a finite space, and book publish
ing and scholarly demand are
expanding infinitely.
Move to Meyer
After review by the Academic
Council Committee on Libraries,
part of the Main Library collec
tion was reluctantly shifted to
the auxiliary stacks in Meyer
basement. Those shelves are
spaced much closer together
than those in the Main Library —
another attempt to gain space.
To go back and change the lo
cation on cards in the catalog to
"Auxiliary stack" would have
been impossible, but the "Magi
cal Mystery Chart" Adler men
tioned makes it pretty obvious
which books are in Meyer base
ment and which still are in the
Main Library stack.
By the way, the library staff
also finds it a miserable incon
venience to have to trot over to
Meyer, but until we find a fairy
godmother with lots of money
for libraries, there it is. •
I suppose Adler's
"shamefaced storage in Styx"
could refer to the Locked Stack,
from which books are fetched at
the request of any student.
We were not protecting vul
nerable youth from the world's
vicissitudes — the idea was to
protect certain vulnerable and/or
valuable books from those who
scruple not against mutilation
and theft. A staff committee is
presently reviewing the criteria
for inclusion of materials in the
Locked Stack.
Adler's "Styx"could also refer
to the Auxiliary Stack on the
Quad, which, unlike the Meyer
basement stack, is not staffed
and not open to the user, again
for reasons of economy.
Requests for books stored
there are paged at regular inter
vals during the day, but it is an
awkward, frustrating arrange
ment for everyone.
I suppose it all boils down to
one thing: money. There were
finished plans and bid docu
ments in the late '60s for a mar
velous new and greatly enlarged
Main Library.
However, the money wasn't
there, and inflatign was, so now
we are re-drafting those plans
into a greatly-scaled-down ver
sion, which at least is better than
none at all.
But again, money is a ques
tion. The new library has the
support of the Board of Trustees,
but if the money is not raised,
will the students and books re
ceive the needed space?
Perhaps concerned friends
would be interested in joining
the Associates of the Stanford
University Libraries in their
fund-raising attempts. It's a mat
ter that will affect the entire
academic community more and
more, as the Library continues to
face its growing financial prob
lems.

"Auxiliary stack" would have
been impossible, but the "Magi
cal Mystery Chart" Adler men
tioned makes it pretty obvious
which books are in Meyer base
ment and which still are in the
Main Library stack.
By the way, the library staff
also finds it a miserable incon
venience to have to trot over to
Meyer, but until we find a fairy
godmother with lots of money
for libraries, there it is. •
I suppose Adler's
"shamefaced storage in Styx"
could refer to the Locked Stack,
from which books are fetched at
the request of any student.
We were not protecting vul
nerable youth from the world's
vicissitudes — the idea was to
protect certain vulnerable and/or
valuable books from those who
scruple not against mutilation
and theft. A staff committee is
presently reviewing the criteria
for inclusion of materials in the
Locked Stack.
Adler's "Styx"could also refer
to the Auxiliary Stack on the
Quad, which, unlike the Meyer
basement stack, is not staffed
and not open to the user, again
for reasons of economy.
Requests for books stored
there are paged at regular inter
vals during the day, but it is an
awkward, frustrating arrange
ment for everyone.
I suppose it all boils down to
one thing: money. There were
finished plans and bid docu
ments in the late '60s for a mar
velous new and greatly enlarged
Main Library.
However, the money wasn't
there, and inflatign was, so now
we are re-drafting those plans
into a greatly-scaled-down ver
sion, which at least is better than
none at all.
But again, money is a ques
tion. The new library has the
support of the Board of Trustees,
but if the money is not raised,
will the students and books re
ceive the needed space?
Perhaps concerned friends
would be interested in joining
the Associates of the Stanford
University Libraries in their
fund-raising attempts. It's a mat
ter that will affect the entire
academic community more and
more, as the Library continues to
face its growing financial prob
lems.

Let me attempt some brief re
sponses to Joy Adler's Jan. 7
Daily column "Library maze."
The "Furies" which deter
mine the location of Adler's
psychology books are the re
quests of faculty, students and
•ranch libraries, all of whom
would, like to have their mate
rials at the most convenient loca-
Iton for them, plus the fact that
psychology" is an aspect com
mon to many disciplines — e.g.
education, medicine, history,
political science.
The card file called Serial Re
ords is being kept up to date on
a daily basis by a hard-working,
understaffed crew of seven, who
iiandle over 100,000 records a
year (30,000 current titles) in a
small, cramped space. A pub
lished version is issued every
few years.
Serial record-keeping has al
ways been one of the most com
plicated, controversial aspects of
library maintenance.
Expensive
The Main Library catalog
would be a vastly expensive and
complicated tool which would
dwarf its present size if it at
tempted to list fully all the lib
rary holdings on caifipus. The
catalog does contain one author
card for each title cataloged by
(he separately administered lib
raries (Hoover, Jackson, Law,
l .ane, Food Research and SLAC).
Because they are separately
administered, their author en
tries often do not mesh with
tnose in the Main Catalog. The
University cannot support the
costs of trying to integrate them
completely into the Main
Catalog, or to list their holdings
by subject or title.
If Stanford had not switched to
the Library of Congress (LC)
classification in 1965, but had
rontinued to use its unique, in
creasingly unwieldy modifica
lions of the Dewey classification,
Adler would be even more dis
mayed by library inefficiency.
Among other considerations,
use of LC allows us to quickly
itilize cataloging already done
i »y the Library of Congress for 80
percent of the current books
ataloged by Stanford. Much of
his material is cataloged using
magnetic tapes received from
r he Library of Congress and pro
-messed through our com
puterized system, BALLOTS.
Computer file
With BALLOTS we are build
i ;ig still another file of on-line
bibliographical citations which
an be retrieved through author,
; itie, subject, call number of LC
card number. The file can also
■ell BALLOTS users wherein the
library system a given book is at
ilie time.
If the money were available,
ihere would be terminals for
client use, and students would
have direct access to that infor
mation; as it is. the library staff
itself needs more terminals.
Money is also the reason we
vere not able to go back and re
classify all those older books in
Dewey. In the opinion of the
faculty-student committee
which approved the change, re
trospective change would be
prohibitively expensive.
Few large libraries which have
switched from Dewey to LC —
and there have been many in re
c mt years — have attempted re
trospective reclassification.
On same floor
We have, however, tried to
keep the same subjects on the
same floor ol the stack whenever
possible. For example, the 100s
nd 200s of Dewey (psychology,
philosophy and religion) and

Karin Eckelmeyer

LC's B class for the same subjects
are on the first level near each
other.
Those cards for "Stack" books,
which are not stamped "Stack,"
derive from days long past when
locations were recorded on the
verso (the back) of the card.
When that cumbersome sys
tem was changed, retrospective
stamping by that time was out of
the question — moneyagain. But
at least one knew that even
though the front of the card
didn't say so, the book was in the
stack.
There came, however, the in
evitable: a rapidly growing stack
collection. Where would we
shelve the books? The stacks are
a finite space, and book publish
ing and scholarly demand are
expanding infinitely.
Move to Meyer
After review by the Academic
Council Committee on Libraries,
part of the Main Library collec
tion was reluctantly shifted to
the auxiliary stacks in Meyer
basement. Those shelves are
spaced much closer together
than those in the Main Library —
another attempt to gain space.

Computer file
With BALLOTS we are build
i ;ig still another file of on-line
bibliographical citations which
an be retrieved through author,
; itie, subject, call number of LC
card number. The file can also
■ell BALLOTS users wherein the
library system a given book is at
ilie time.
If the money were available,
ihere would be terminals for
client use, and students would
have direct access to that infor
mation; as it is. the library staff
itself needs more terminals.
Money is also the reason we
vere not able to go back and re
classify all those older books in
Dewey. In the opinion of the
faculty-student committee
which approved the change, re
trospective change would be
prohibitively expensive.
Few large libraries which have
switched from Dewey to LC —
and there have been many in re
c mt years — have attempted re
trospective reclassification.
On same floor
We have, however, tried to
keep the same subjects on the
same floor ol the stack whenever
possible. For example, the 100s
nd 200s of Dewey (psychology,
philosophy and religion) and

Karin Eckelmeyer

LC's B class for the same subjects
are on the first level near each
other.
Those cards for "Stack" books,
which are not stamped "Stack,"
derive from days long past when
locations were recorded on the
verso (the back) of the card.
When that cumbersome sys
tem was changed, retrospective
stamping by that time was out of
the question — moneyagain. But
at least one knew that even
though the front of the card
didn't say so, the book was in the
stack.
There came, however, the in
evitable: a rapidly growing stack
collection. Where would we
shelve the books? The stacks are
a finite space, and book publish
ing and scholarly demand are
expanding infinitely.
Move to Meyer
After review by the Academic
Council Committee on Libraries,
part of the Main Library collec
tion was reluctantly shifted to
the auxiliary stacks in Meyer
basement. Those shelves are
spaced much closer together
than those in the Main Library —
another attempt to gain space.
To go back and change the lo
cation on cards in the catalog to
"Auxiliary stack" would have
been impossible, but the "Magi
cal Mystery Chart" Adler men
tioned makes it pretty obvious
which books are in Meyer base
ment and which still are in the
Main Library stack.
By the way, the library staff
also finds it a miserable incon
venience to have to trot over to
Meyer, but until we find a fairy
godmother with lots of money
for libraries, there it is. •
I suppose Adler's
"shamefaced storage in Styx"
could refer to the Locked Stack,
from which books are fetched at
the request of any student.
We were not protecting vul
nerable youth from the world's
vicissitudes — the idea was to
protect certain vulnerable and/or
valuable books from those who
scruple not against mutilation
and theft. A staff committee is
presently reviewing the criteria
for inclusion of materials in the
Locked Stack.
Adler's "Styx"could also refer
to the Auxiliary Stack on the
Quad, which, unlike the Meyer
basement stack, is not staffed
and not open to the user, again
for reasons of economy.
Requests for books stored
there are paged at regular inter
vals during the day, but it is an
awkward, frustrating arrange
ment for everyone.
I suppose it all boils down to
one thing: money. There were
finished plans and bid docu
ments in the late '60s for a mar
velous new and greatly enlarged
Main Library.
However, the money wasn't
there, and inflatign was, so now
we are re-drafting those plans
into a greatly-scaled-down ver
sion, which at least is better than
none at all.
But again, money is a ques
tion. The new library has the
support of the Board of Trustees,
but if the money is not raised,
will the students and books re
ceive the needed space?
Perhaps concerned friends
would be interested in joining
the Associates of the Stanford
University Libraries in their
fund-raising attempts. It's a mat
ter that will affect the entire
academic community more and
more, as the Library continues to
face its growing financial prob
lems.

Let me attempt some brief re
sponses to Joy Adler's Jan. 7
Daily column "Library maze."
The "Furies" which deter
mine the location of Adler's
psychology books are the re
quests of faculty, students and
•ranch libraries, all of whom
would, like to have their mate
rials at the most convenient loca-
Iton for them, plus the fact that
psychology" is an aspect com
mon to many disciplines — e.g.
education, medicine, history,
political science.
The card file called Serial Re
ords is being kept up to date on
a daily basis by a hard-working,
understaffed crew of seven, who
iiandle over 100,000 records a
year (30,000 current titles) in a
small, cramped space. A pub
lished version is issued every
few years.
Serial record-keeping has al
ways been one of the most com
plicated, controversial aspects of
library maintenance.
Expensive
The Main Library catalog
would be a vastly expensive and
complicated tool which would
dwarf its present size if it at
tempted to list fully all the lib
rary holdings on caifipus. The
catalog does contain one author
card for each title cataloged by
(he separately administered lib
raries (Hoover, Jackson, Law,
l .ane, Food Research and SLAC).
Because they are separately
administered, their author en
tries often do not mesh with
tnose in the Main Catalog. The
University cannot support the
costs of trying to integrate them
completely into the Main
Catalog, or to list their holdings
by subject or title.
If Stanford had not switched to
the Library of Congress (LC)
classification in 1965, but had
rontinued to use its unique, in
creasingly unwieldy modifica
lions of the Dewey classification,
Adler would be even more dis
mayed by library inefficiency.
Among other considerations,
use of LC allows us to quickly
itilize cataloging already done
i »y the Library of Congress for 80
percent of the current books
ataloged by Stanford. Much of
his material is cataloged using
magnetic tapes received from
r he Library of Congress and pro
-messed through our com
puterized system, BALLOTS.
