## 
### 
Tony Alexander is moving out
>112 his Campus Shoe Shop tomor
row.
He leaves us a message. "I
ish to thank everyone for the
kindness and for the help they
lave given me during all the
y-.iars 1 have been here. Cod bless
'cm all. and if there's anything I
an ever do for them, just tell
me."
Tony Alexander has been at
Stanford for 29 years. He started
in the shoe business when he
uas 17. He's been working at it
â€¢ince then.
Why h'as he stayed at Stanford
for all those years? "It's the
people man, the people. Not the
location. I love 'em all."
Tony hopes to open a new
shop in a new shopping center
near his home in San Jose. But
the center won't be completed
until June.
"That's a long way."
He is involved in a lawsuit
over an accident suffered by his
wife. He had hoped to get the
settlement soon, so he could pay
the University, but the system is

slow. He wishes he could have
more time.
"They tell me that if 1 can
make $400, it'll be okay. But they
tell me when there's no one
around to make three nickels off
of.
"1 go by California's recom
mended price lists. My prices aje
lower than those."
He looks down. "Too low.
"I'll probably get a job some
where 'til June. Maybe in my
wife's shop. I don't know. It's
kinda hard workin' for your
wife. And I like to heehaw with
the guys I know.
"I had an offer for a thousand
dollar loan from aiyold friend of
mine. But she's been sick lately,
heart trouble, and she might
need the money real soon. She's
known me as long as I've been
here. I couldn't take the money."
As I left, he said,"And don't
forget to thank 'em for me.
Thanks for comin' by. And don't
worry about me. I'll make it.
God's on my side."
