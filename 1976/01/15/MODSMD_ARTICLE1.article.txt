# Ghost town on the Row?
## 
### CHARLIE HALL MARK ALBERTSON 
The Pearce Mitchell condominium complex looked
like an idea that couldn't lose. Last spring,
so many professors were interested in the project that
134 took part in a lottery to determine priority for fall
occupancy.
Today, Pearce Mitchell sits half empty. Only 43 of its 82
units are occupied. Rows of vacant carports lend a
ghost-like quality to the complex, and the University is
paying the price both for the complex's questionable
design and for what appears to be a severe misjudgment
of demand.
Pearce Mitchell, the project designed to provide on
campus emeriti and junior faculty housing, is beset by
numerous problems. But most prominent on the minds of
many emeriti who finally decided not to purchase the
condominiums is the feeling that the units simply aren't
designed to suit their needs. As one disgruntled profes
sor puts it, "It's a good place for two kinds of people:
widows and widowers."

"When they designed this, they should have given
some consideration to the needs of the emeriti," comp
lains another emeritus who had been "eager" to buy a
condominium on the Row until he saw the final product.
He points to the smallness of the apartments as the
main problem. The largest bedroom in the complex is
11x14 feet and some are as small as 9xll. An average
student double in Stern Hall, bycomparison, is 12x16.
"You put in a double bed." the emeritus scoffs, "and
there's nothing left." He complains that an emeritus mov
ing into Pearce Mitchell is forced to sell a lifetime of
memories as well as precious collections of books. For
some, the prospect is unacceptable.
Another professor reasons, "I can imagine a young
couple finding this and being overjoyed, but when you
ask someone to move from a large house, it's a bit too
much to ask."
One professor who purchased a condominium says
that he finds his unit "too cloying" and admits that he
"wouldn't want to live here 12 months out of the year."
The smallness has been a major factor in the disastr-
ous response to the project's
two-bedroom apartments. Even
though an early survey showed
more people wanted two
bedroom units more than any
other kind, all of the 31 unsold
condominiums are two-bedroom
units.
The root of the problem is that
the second bedroom is a spare
9xll, too small not only to be a
bedroom, but as one con
dominium owner put it, "too small
even to be a study."
Another problem facing Pearce
Mitchell is what some consider its
tacky construction, inside and out.
One construction engineering
professor who had observed
Pearce Mitchell's construction,
complains that the contractor,
Wheatley-Jacobson, appears to
have used a poor grade of con
crete and failed to grid the walk
ways with steel reinforcing wire.
Both factors, he feels, could lead
to "rapid deterioration."
When contacted by the Daily, a
spokesman for Wheatly-
Jacobsen said that a Palo Alto or
dinance forbids the use of reinforc
ing wire in concrete walkways and
denied that the cement would de
teriorate. The contractor also said
that the concrete used had been
tested and was not a poor grade.
One emeritus in the complex
comments that a grass crown be
hind his condominium causes
water to flood his patio during
rainstorms. When, a full week
after a scant. 10 inches of rain had
fallen, deep puddles remained
outside of his living room window,
the emeritus notified Director of
Faculty-Staff Housing Robert
Summers of the problem.
As the professor recalls, Sum
mers told him, "The problem is al
ready solved" but promised to
have it checked again after the
next rainstorm.
Residents satisfied
In general, however, most resi
dents of the complex are satisfied
that the buildings are soundly
constructed. "We looked around
for awhile, and it's as good as any
new construction we've seen,"
says one young occupant.
Most of the residents had high
praise for the convenient on
campus location and the common
facilities such as a heated pool
and sauna.
Another popular feature among
condominium owners is the com
plex's landscaping. "When they
get through with the landscaping,
it's going to look beautiful," com
ments one resident.
Summers agrees and adds, "As
the landscape improves, com
plaints should diminish."
External appearance
Less popular is the external ap
pearance of the apartments. The
units, built with siding that consists
of either light brown shingles or
dark brown boards, has drawn fire
from residents and non-residents
alike, causing some to charge that
the units are overpriced.
The complex's two and three
bedroom units range in price from
$43,000 to $69,000.
"When I saw these ticky-ticky
buildings, I thought, 'it makes no
sense to move,'" says one dis

gruntled emeritus. "Personally,"
he adds, "I think someone
botched the planning then
lavished money on the landscap
ing to make up for it."
The widespread turnabout of
professors who had contemplated
a move to Pearce Mitchell, has left
the project's proponents grappling

for an explanation.
Summers, who heads the Uni
versity's effort to sell the con
dominiums, denies that Pearce
Mitchell's units are overpriced,
even though the original survey
indicating demand for the project,
showed that only 32 out of 86 re
spondents were willing to pay

more than $40,000.
A primary problem, Summers
acknowledges, is that market
conditions throughout the Bay
Area as a whole may not apply.
Since children under 18 aren't al
lowed to live in the condominiums,
the University is forced to focus its
appeal to a "limited number of fa
culty," Summers notes.
An additional problem is that,
nationwide, condominiums are
having a hard time selling. Sum
mers explains that the University
had initially planned to rent the
apartments, but fire regulations
forced the University to reduce the
number of units in the complex
from 100 to 82, and it became
necessary to sell the apartments
as condominiums.
Size a factor
Summers does admit that the
size of the units may have "been a
factor" in the sluggish sales. But
he adds that the project's design
was "guided by the question
naires" issued during the Univer
sity's initial study.
But "there were no more formal
surveys" to determine if the ar
chitect's final plans were accepta
ble, he concedes.
As for the complex's much
criticized exterior, Summers
acknowledges that the units "look
better from the inside out."
On the other hand, Emeritus

Education Prof. Paul Hannah,
who chaired the committee which
first recommended construction of
emeriti housing, feels the timing of
Pearce Mitchell's opening has
been the cause of the empty units.
"Academics," he claims, "don't
move during an academic year."
The complex had been scheduled
to open during the late summer,
but a combination of labor and
weather problems pushed the
date back to early October.
The delay, Hannah insists, de
terred large numbers of prospec
tive buyers, and he expresses
confidence that a new surge in
purchasing will occur at the end of
the school year.
Full occupancy?
There is little unanimity as to
when, or even if, Pearce Mitchell
will become fully occupied. "I don't
want to make any prediction,"
Summers says. Should the units
not fill by next summer, he cau
tions, a hike in the condominiums'
prices may be needed to cover the
University's losses.
Hannah foresees no problem at
all, saying he is "sure" there will
be no vacancies once the
academic year ends.
Not everyone is so sure, how
ever: "I think they've reached their
climax," says one emeritus who
had discounted the notion of ever
moving in.

SOGGY?—A few Pearce Mitchell residents found their patios
inundated by early winter rains, and even slight amounts of
water formed puddles that refused to drain.
