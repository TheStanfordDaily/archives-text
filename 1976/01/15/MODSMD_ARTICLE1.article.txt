# Ghost town on the Row?
## 
### CHARLIE HALL MARK ALBERTSON 
The Pearce Mitchell condominium complex looked
like an idea that couldn't lose. Last spring,
so many professors were interested in the project that
134 took part in a lottery to determine priority for fall
occupancy.
Today, Pearce Mitchell sits half empty. Only 43 of its 82
units are occupied. Rows of vacant carports lend a
ghost-like quality to the complex, and the University is
paying the price both for the complex's questionable
design and for what appears to be a severe misjudgment
of demand.
Pearce Mitchell, the project designed to provide on
campus emeriti and junior faculty housing, is beset by
numerous problems. But most prominent on the minds of
many emeriti who finally decided not to purchase the
condominiums is the feeling that the units simply aren't
designed to suit their needs. As one disgruntled profes
sor puts it, "It's a good place for two kinds of people:
widows and widowers."

"When they designed this, they should have given
some consideration to the needs of the emeriti," comp
lains another emeritus who had been "eager" to buy a
condominium on the Row until he saw the final product.
He points to the smallness of the apartments as the
main problem. The largest bedroom in the complex is
11x14 feet and some are as small as 9xll. An average
student double in Stern Hall, bycomparison, is 12x16.
"You put in a double bed." the emeritus scoffs, "and
there's nothing left." He complains that an emeritus mov
ing into Pearce Mitchell is forced to sell a lifetime of
memories as well as precious collections of books. For
some, the prospect is unacceptable.
Another professor reasons, "I can imagine a young
couple finding this and being overjoyed, but when you
ask someone to move from a large house, it's a bit too
much to ask."
One professor who purchased a condominium says
that he finds his unit "too cloying" and admits that he
"wouldn't want to live here 12 months out of the year."
The smallness has been a major factor in the disastr-
