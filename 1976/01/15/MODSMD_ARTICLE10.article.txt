# Lower frosh SAT scores: a trend?
## BEHIND THE HEADLINES 
### BILL ROSS 
While grade inflation worries
many students, administrators
and faculty members around the
nation are equally concerned
about another academic
phenomenon — Scholastic Ap
titude Test (SAT) deflation.
For several years, average SAT
scores among the nation's high
school seniors who take the test
have steadily declined. Scores
among entering Stanford
freshmen have followed this
trend, according to Admissions
Dean Fred Hargadon.
SAT scores here and at most
other universities reached a peak
in the middle 1960s and have
steadily fallen ever since then,
Hargadon said. Verbal scores
here have declined about 30
points while mathematical scores
have remained stable, he said.
In the nation as a whole, verbal
scores have declined about 40
points during the past decade
while mathematical scores have
declined by about 20 points.
Hargadon emphasized that
since the decline in Stanford's
SAT scores parallels that of other
selective universities, the decline
has not damaged the Universi
ty's academic reputation.
Fighting the decline
Administrators and faculty
members at universities through
out the nation are so disturbed by
the decline in SAT scores that
they are starting to try to combat
the decline, Hargadon said. But
he explained that before the steps
can be taken to curb the decline,
educators must understand the
reasons behind it.

"We don't want to buck the
trend by using scores alone,"
Hargadon explained. "It would be
one thing if SAT scores alone
pointed to a decline in the verbal
and mathematical abilities of the
nation's youth. But other
achievement tests show a similar
decline and findings in other areas
also reinforce the conclusion that
the academic abilities of applic
ants are declining."
According to Hargadon, the de
terioration in the so-called "work
ethic" partly explains the decline.
"Americans generally have a
more leisurely life style than they
have had in the past," Hargadon
said. "Many people 20 or 30 years
ago were trying hard to get ahead
so they worked harder. Such striv
ing for self-betterment is less evi
dent among the students of today
because more of them are
affluent."
Lack of rigor
Another major reason for SAT
deflation is the decline in high
schools' academic rigor. Harga
don said.
He said that the lessened em

phasis on grammar in English
courses is a main problem, to
gether with the introduction of the
"new math."
Although Hargadon said that
the "new math" in itself was not
necessarily the cause of the de
cline in scores, its introduction into
schools "caused confusion"
among many instructors. Such
confusion might now be passing,
he noted.
Language background
Hargadon also lamented the
decreased high school emphasis
on what he called the "difficult"
languages of Latin, Greek and
German.
Hargadon noted that fewer and
fewer high schools are teaching
these languages, which he con
tends help students to better un
derstand the English language
"Not all the fault is with the high
schools because they get their
guidelines from the colleges."
Hargadon said "It is hard for col
lege administrators to talk to high
school administrators about
academic discipline when the col
leaes are abandoning language

and distribution requirements and
are initiating free floating
courses."
Language requirement aboli
tion at colleges "knocks the props
out from under high school
teachers who are struggling to re
tain programs in Greek and Latin,"
Hargadon said.
Anti-elitism
Hargadon complained that a
growing anti-elitism in American
life, together with the recession,
has contributed to the elimination
of many advanced courses in high
schools.
Throughout the country, voters
are defeating bond issues, he
noted. He attributed these defeats
to declining enrollments and the
nation's economic troubles.
"The advanced programs are
often the first programs to be cut
when a school district has finan
cial problems," Hargadon said.
In order to discourage high
school administrators and
teachers from further diluting their
academic programs, Hargadon
said that many college adminis
trators are beginning to try to
communicate better with their
high school counterparts.
'Changes imminent'
"Changes are imminent," Har
gadon said. "Professors are at
tempting to make high schools
aware of what is considered to be
a strong program. We want them
to know that in admissions, we
give heavy consideration to the
rigor of the courses taken by an
applicant."
Although science professors
long have attempted to make this
information known in the high
schools, social science and
humanities professors of the
American Political Science As
sociation and the American Histor
ical Association recently started
programs to try to encourage im
provement of high school prog
rams.
Hargadon said he is particularly
disturbed because it is possible
for a person to graduate from high
school even though he is virtually
illiterate.
"It's almost impossible not to
graduate from high school today,"
Hargadon said.
Peculiar reasons
In addition to the general
reasons for SAT score decline,
Stanford has faced several pecul
iar reasons for the fall in the aver
age scores of its entering classes,
he said.
Part of the reason is the 10 per
cent increase in enrollment during
the past decade, which has forced
the University to take some stu
dents with scores somewhat
lower than those of other stu

dents.
Another factor is the Universi
ty's attempt during the past 10
years to diversify its student body
by accepting more students from
poorer homes who might not have
had the same level of academic
preparation as their peers.
"This does not involve only
minorities," Hargadon noted.
Selectivity
Hargadon said that if the Uni
versity were interested only in ob
taining a freshman class with high
SAT scores, it could easily select
a class with SAT figures much
higher than the current average.
Hargadon explained that the
University currently rejects many
dozens of students with SATs
above 750 (upper one half of one
percent) while it accepts many
students with scores below 600.
"It is the most selective schools

that place the least emphasis on
SAT scores," Hargadon said. "We
are more interested in finding
energetic, intellectually exciting
students than simply those with
high test scores.
"I'm not so worried about the
decline in average scores than I
am about the symptoms of educa
tional problems that they reflect,"
Hargadon concluded.

versity were interested only in ob
taining a freshman class with high
SAT scores, it could easily select
a class with SAT figures much
higher than the current average.
Hargadon explained that the
University currently rejects many
dozens of students with SATs
above 750 (upper one half of one
percent) while it accepts many
students with scores below 600.
"It is the most selective schools

that place the least emphasis on
SAT scores," Hargadon said. "We
are more interested in finding
energetic, intellectually exciting
students than simply those with
high test scores.
"I'm not so worried about the
decline in average scores than I
am about the symptoms of educa
tional problems that they reflect,"
Hargadon concluded.
While grade inflation worries
many students, administrators
and faculty members around the
nation are equally concerned
about another academic
phenomenon — Scholastic Ap
titude Test (SAT) deflation.
For several years, average SAT
scores among the nation's high
school seniors who take the test
have steadily declined. Scores
among entering Stanford
freshmen have followed this
trend, according to Admissions
Dean Fred Hargadon.
SAT scores here and at most
other universities reached a peak
in the middle 1960s and have
steadily fallen ever since then,
Hargadon said. Verbal scores
here have declined about 30
points while mathematical scores
have remained stable, he said.
In the nation as a whole, verbal
scores have declined about 40
points during the past decade
while mathematical scores have
declined by about 20 points.
Hargadon emphasized that
since the decline in Stanford's
SAT scores parallels that of other
selective universities, the decline
has not damaged the Universi
ty's academic reputation.
Fighting the decline
Administrators and faculty
members at universities through
out the nation are so disturbed by
the decline in SAT scores that
they are starting to try to combat
the decline, Hargadon said. But
he explained that before the steps
can be taken to curb the decline,
educators must understand the
reasons behind it.

"We don't want to buck the
trend by using scores alone,"
Hargadon explained. "It would be
one thing if SAT scores alone
pointed to a decline in the verbal
and mathematical abilities of the
nation's youth. But other
achievement tests show a similar
decline and findings in other areas
also reinforce the conclusion that
the academic abilities of applic
ants are declining."
According to Hargadon, the de
terioration in the so-called "work
ethic" partly explains the decline.
"Americans generally have a
more leisurely life style than they
have had in the past," Hargadon
said. "Many people 20 or 30 years
ago were trying hard to get ahead
so they worked harder. Such striv
ing for self-betterment is less evi
dent among the students of today
because more of them are
affluent."
Lack of rigor
Another major reason for SAT
deflation is the decline in high
schools' academic rigor. Harga
don said.
He said that the lessened em

phasis on grammar in English
courses is a main problem, to
gether with the introduction of the
"new math."
Although Hargadon said that
the "new math" in itself was not
necessarily the cause of the de
cline in scores, its introduction into
schools "caused confusion"
among many instructors. Such
confusion might now be passing,
he noted.
Language background
Hargadon also lamented the
decreased high school emphasis
on what he called the "difficult"
languages of Latin, Greek and
German.
Hargadon noted that fewer and
fewer high schools are teaching
these languages, which he con
tends help students to better un
derstand the English language
"Not all the fault is with the high
schools because they get their
guidelines from the colleges."
Hargadon said "It is hard for col
lege administrators to talk to high
school administrators about
academic discipline when the col
leaes are abandoning language

and distribution requirements and
are initiating free floating
courses."
Language requirement aboli
tion at colleges "knocks the props
out from under high school
teachers who are struggling to re
tain programs in Greek and Latin,"
Hargadon said.
Anti-elitism
Hargadon complained that a
growing anti-elitism in American
life, together with the recession,
has contributed to the elimination
of many advanced courses in high
schools.
Throughout the country, voters
are defeating bond issues, he
noted. He attributed these defeats
to declining enrollments and the
nation's economic troubles.
"The advanced programs are
often the first programs to be cut
when a school district has finan
cial problems," Hargadon said.
In order to discourage high
school administrators and
teachers from further diluting their
academic programs, Hargadon
said that many college adminis
trators are beginning to try to
communicate better with their
high school counterparts.
'Changes imminent'
"Changes are imminent," Har
gadon said. "Professors are at
tempting to make high schools
aware of what is considered to be
a strong program. We want them
to know that in admissions, we
give heavy consideration to the
rigor of the courses taken by an
applicant."
Although science professors
long have attempted to make this
information known in the high
schools, social science and
humanities professors of the
American Political Science As
sociation and the American Histor
ical Association recently started
programs to try to encourage im
provement of high school prog
rams.
Hargadon said he is particularly
disturbed because it is possible
for a person to graduate from high
school even though he is virtually
illiterate.
"It's almost impossible not to
graduate from high school today,"
Hargadon said.
Peculiar reasons
In addition to the general
reasons for SAT score decline,
Stanford has faced several pecul
iar reasons for the fall in the aver
age scores of its entering classes,
he said.
Part of the reason is the 10 per
cent increase in enrollment during
the past decade, which has forced
the University to take some stu
dents with scores somewhat
lower than those of other stu

dents.
Another factor is the Universi
ty's attempt during the past 10
years to diversify its student body
by accepting more students from
poorer homes who might not have
had the same level of academic
preparation as their peers.
"This does not involve only
minorities," Hargadon noted.
Selectivity
Hargadon said that if the Uni
versity were interested only in ob
taining a freshman class with high
SAT scores, it could easily select
a class with SAT figures much

Stanford has faced several pecul
iar reasons for the fall in the aver
age scores of its entering classes,
he said.
Part of the reason is the 10 per
cent increase in enrollment during
the past decade, which has forced
the University to take some stu
dents with scores somewhat
lower than those of other stu

dents.
Another factor is the Universi
ty's attempt during the past 10
years to diversify its student body
by accepting more students from
poorer homes who might not have
had the same level of academic
preparation as their peers.
"This does not involve only
minorities," Hargadon noted.
Selectivity
Hargadon said that if the Uni
versity were interested only in ob
taining a freshman class with high
SAT scores, it could easily select
a class with SAT figures much
higher than the current average.
Hargadon explained that the
University currently rejects many
dozens of students with SATs
above 750 (upper one half of one
percent) while it accepts many
students with scores below 600.
"It is the most selective schools

that place the least emphasis on
SAT scores," Hargadon said. "We
are more interested in finding
energetic, intellectually exciting
students than simply those with
high test scores.
"I'm not so worried about the
decline in average scores than I
am about the symptoms of educa
tional problems that they reflect,"
Hargadon concluded.
While grade inflation worries
many students, administrators
and faculty members around the
nation are equally concerned
about another academic
phenomenon — Scholastic Ap
titude Test (SAT) deflation.
For several years, average SAT
scores among the nation's high
school seniors who take the test
have steadily declined. Scores
among entering Stanford
freshmen have followed this
trend, according to Admissions
Dean Fred Hargadon.
SAT scores here and at most
other universities reached a peak
in the middle 1960s and have
steadily fallen ever since then,
Hargadon said. Verbal scores
here have declined about 30
points while mathematical scores
have remained stable, he said.
In the nation as a whole, verbal
scores have declined about 40
points during the past decade
while mathematical scores have
declined by about 20 points.
Hargadon emphasized that
since the decline in Stanford's
SAT scores parallels that of other
selective universities, the decline
has not damaged the Universi
ty's academic reputation.
Fighting the decline
Administrators and faculty
members at universities through
out the nation are so disturbed by
the decline in SAT scores that
they are starting to try to combat
the decline, Hargadon said. But
he explained that before the steps
can be taken to curb the decline,
educators must understand the
reasons behind it.

"We don't want to buck the
trend by using scores alone,"
Hargadon explained. "It would be
one thing if SAT scores alone
pointed to a decline in the verbal
and mathematical abilities of the
nation's youth. But other
achievement tests show a similar
decline and findings in other areas
also reinforce the conclusion that
the academic abilities of applic
ants are declining."
According to Hargadon, the de
terioration in the so-called "work
ethic" partly explains the decline.
"Americans generally have a
more leisurely life style than they
have had in the past," Hargadon
said. "Many people 20 or 30 years
ago were trying hard to get ahead
so they worked harder. Such striv
ing for self-betterment is less evi
dent among the students of today
because more of them are
affluent."
Lack of rigor
Another major reason for SAT
deflation is the decline in high
schools' academic rigor. Harga
don said.
He said that the lessened em

phasis on grammar in English
courses is a main problem, to
gether with the introduction of the
"new math."
Although Hargadon said that
the "new math" in itself was not
necessarily the cause of the de
cline in scores, its introduction into
schools "caused confusion"
among many instructors. Such
confusion might now be passing,
he noted.
Language background
Hargadon also lamented the
decreased high school emphasis
on what he called the "difficult"
languages of Latin, Greek and
German.
Hargadon noted that fewer and
fewer high schools are teaching
these languages, which he con
tends help students to better un
derstand the English language
"Not all the fault is with the high
schools because they get their
guidelines from the colleges."
Hargadon said "It is hard for col
lege administrators to talk to high
school administrators about
academic discipline when the col
leaes are abandoning language

and distribution requirements and
are initiating free floating
courses."
Language requirement aboli
tion at colleges "knocks the props
out from under high school
teachers who are struggling to re
tain programs in Greek and Latin,"
Hargadon said.
Anti-elitism
Hargadon complained that a
growing anti-elitism in American
life, together with the recession,
has contributed to the elimination
of many advanced courses in high
schools.
Throughout the country, voters
are defeating bond issues, he
noted. He attributed these defeats
to declining enrollments and the
nation's economic troubles.
"The advanced programs are
often the first programs to be cut
when a school district has finan
cial problems," Hargadon said.
In order to discourage high
school administrators and
teachers from further diluting their
academic programs, Hargadon
said that many college adminis
trators are beginning to try to
communicate better with their
high school counterparts.
'Changes imminent'
"Changes are imminent," Har
gadon said. "Professors are at
tempting to make high schools
aware of what is considered to be
a strong program. We want them
to know that in admissions, we
give heavy consideration to the
rigor of the courses taken by an
applicant."
Although science professors
long have attempted to make this
information known in the high
schools, social science and
humanities professors of the
American Political Science As
sociation and the American Histor
ical Association recently started
programs to try to encourage im
provement of high school prog
rams.
Hargadon said he is particularly
disturbed because it is possible
for a person to graduate from high
school even though he is virtually
illiterate.
"It's almost impossible not to
graduate from high school today,"
Hargadon said.
