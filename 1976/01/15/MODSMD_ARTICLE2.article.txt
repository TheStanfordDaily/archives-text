## An experiment 
### 
Welcome to Thursday.
Yes, this is today's edition of The Stanford Daily.
No, the Daily will not look like this forevermore. Maybe not
even next Thursday.
Thursday is a one-shot experiment. An experiment to de
termine whether we can provide an editorially viable and
well-liked product to the Stanford community while trying to
save the financially troubled Stanford Daily Publishing Corpo
ration money.
What Thursday is, basically, is a combination of the Spec
trum entertainment section we've been running and the regu
lar Thursday Daily, with a few extra features added for good
measure.
It is simply too expensive to run both Spectrum and a
Thursday Daily. An entertainment guide certainly generates
extra revenue, but unfortunately siphons off too many ads
from our regular product.
Thus Thursday.
That's not to say that this new product is simply an attempt
to save money. It's also an attempt by the Daily staff, that
group much maligned for its stodginess, to provide a fresh
new product for the community.
I personally have for three years thought that the Stanford
campus could benefit from the introduction of a magazine
style publication, which could provide a well-illustrated cover
story and be more flexible in design than could a full-sized
newspaper.
There are, unfortunately, not enough dollars to support
both a magazine and a daily newspaper on this campus. The
introduction of Thursday, therefore, represents a compromise
between the ideal of a daily newspaper plus a weekly
magazine and the economic reality of a newspaper — only.
This product is only an experiment. If you don't like it at all,
tell us. If you do like it, tell us. If you think it could use some
improvements, tell us. WE WANT FEEDBACK!
If you don't like this product, we won't continue to have it. It's
that simple.
