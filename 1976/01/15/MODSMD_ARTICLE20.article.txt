## 'Cuckoo's Nest' Nicholson's own 
### HOWARD BALDWIN 
All those who have seen the

black cape, evil personified. She
runs the 'voluntary' ward with a
megalomania and cruelty un

Porcelain face
Fletcher's portrayal is a perfect
translation from the book. Kesey
wrote about Nurse Ratched, "It
was strange to hear that voice,
soft and soothing and warm as a
pillow, coming out of a face as
