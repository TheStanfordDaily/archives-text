# PICKS OF THE FLICKS
## 'Cuckoo's Nest' Nicholson's own 
### HOWARD BALDWIN 
All those who have seen the
play or read the book One Flew
Over The Cuckoo's Nest know
that there is only one actor in
America today who rightfully de
served the part of Randle Patrick
McMurphy, the total non
conformist right down to his
name's spelling. It couldn't be
anyone but Jack Nicholson.
McMurphy is the combination of
Nicholson's frenzy in The Fortune,
his extroversion in The Last Detail
and his cocky security in Carnal
Knowledge. It's like Gable and
Gone With The Wind â€” no one
else would be accepted in the role.
Nicholson has not disappointed
us. He is undeniably perfect. He
may act for 40 more years and

never find a part more suitable for
him than this. Nicholson, as well
as the rest of the cast, transcends
our first identification and moves
onto higher plateaus of identity,
leaving far behind whoever they
may have been in real life.
Allegory for survival
The story of the rambunctious
McMurphy eluding jail by faking
insanity is an allegory for survival
in a hostile and oppressive world.
Bubbling with all the inhibitions of
a chimpanzee, McMurphy runs up
against the straight-laced Simon
Legree of his ward, Nurse
Ratched (Louise Fletcher).
Author Ken Kesey based the
character of Ratched on a nurse at
the Palo Alto Veteran's Hospital.
The first view of her is from a
distance, down a long corridor.
She is completely swathed in a
black cape, evil personified. She
runs the 'voluntary' ward with a
megalomania and cruelty un
equalled.
Porcelain face
Fletcher's portrayal is a perfect
translation from the book. Kesey
wrote about Nurse Ratched, "It
was strange to hear that voice,
soft and soothing and warm as a
pillow, coming out of a face as
hard as porcelain." Fletcher is not
so obviously evil as one might ex
pect, but her true oppressive de
signs subtly appear.
There are special moments in
this film that will be remembered
as great pieces of cinema sparked
with a magic seldom found on sc
reen. A special confluence of per
sonalities and relationships oc
curs between McMurphy and his
fellow patients.
His energy suffuses the film and
his ward. His instruction of deaf
and-dumb Chief Bromden in the

game of basketball and his own
rendition of the World Series when
Nurse Ratched forbids its broad
cast are two such moments.
Valient fighting
The entire sequence in which
McMurphy steals the inmates' bus
and hijacks a fishing boat is a mas
terpiece. His valient fighting for
the patients' freedom and right to
hilarity, women and booze bring
about unprecedented changes in
the patients, something Nurse
Ratched simply will not condone.
Every silver lining has its cloud,
and McMurphy's is no different.
He finds himself going the wrong

way on a one-way street with no
place to turn around. It is impossi
ble, though, for anyone as infec
tions as McMurphy to go through
life without touching others, and
his legacy lives on at the asylum
after he is gone.
Screenwriters Lawrence
Hauben and Bo Goldman relied
on the Kesey book rather than the
Wasserman play for their mate
rial, making the film more open
and less confined, turning out a
powerful screenplay.
Unique direction
Director Milos Forman in
creased the film's intensity tenfold
with his unique direction. Relying,
on shots with only one person on
screen, he brings us as close as
possible to the patients and Nurse
Ratched.
While this shows proof under
close scrutiny of all the actors' ta
lent, it can be extremely unsettling
being so close to the evil of Nurse
Ratched and the insanity of the
patients.
Filmed on location at the Ore
gon State Hospital at Salem and
using real patients in the
background, Forman achieves ar.
authenticity few directors are cap
able of, even on location.
