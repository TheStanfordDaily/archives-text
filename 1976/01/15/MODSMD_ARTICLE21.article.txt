# Interview: Louise Fletcher
## 'Cuckoo's' heavy a star 
### HOWARD BALDWIN 
Louise Fletcher lounges on the couch in the Fair
mont Hotel, holding a Bombay gin and tonic, un
iquely combining the empathy of Ellen Burstyn with
the elegance of Lauren Bacall.
Casually dressed in blue jeans and a pumpkin
orange turtleneck sweater, she slowly and carefully
discusses her role as the evil Nurse Ratched in the
new United Artists release One Flew Over The Cuc
koo's Nest.
While it is now referred to as solely a Jack Nichol
son film, the day will come when it is commonly
accepted as a Jack Nicholson-Louise Fletcher film.
She provides the perfect conservatism to Nichol
son's manic Randle Patrick McMurphy, certain to be
nominated for an Academy Award.
About the Oscar, Fletcher says,"I don't even like
to think about it. It's weird. Some people think my
chances are good . . . some people say they never
give heavies the Award."
Good chances
Her chances for a nomination, at least, are
superb. Not only is it an extremely lean year for
women, but it is not at all out of the ordinary for
women to be nominated after only a few roles.
Ali MacGraw and Carrie Snodgress were nomi
nated for their second movies, while Valerie Perrine
was nominated for her third.
It was in Robert Altman's Thieves Like Us, her
second film, in which she also played a heavy, that
Cuckoo's Nest director Milos Forman first noticed
her. She's afraid of being typecast, understandably,

in Wicked Witch of the West roles. "I think I should
play a nun next."
Ironically, "On the same day I went out for this
part, I went out for another part on a television show
where I had one line." Her being spotted and ulti
mately chosen by Forman "was an act of fate —
luck, which I'd never believed in."
A nice lady
There is nothing of Nurse Ratched in Louise
Fletcher. Fletcher's face is soft and pleasant, while
Nurse Ratched's was, as Ken Kesey described it in
the book, "hard as porcelain."
Asked if it was difficult to play someone so inhe
rently different from herself, she replied, "I had trou
ble with it, sure. I had trouble after it was over. It was
rough coming off of that. I don't see how you can
escape taking it home with you.
"Ifelt good getting out of it every day. It's kind of
nice to be Cinderella. It's kind of nice to take off all
that armor and then brush my hair, walk out and say,
Hi, everybody.' "
The hair was an important aspect of Ratched's
appearance. One critic suggested that the '40s up
sweep of it resembled horns of the devil. Fletcher
recalled Forman's discussion of it with her. "He felt
that somehow (the audience) should have the idea
that for this woman life stopped at sometime or
other, that she gave whatever like she had to this
job."
Drama major

Fletcher grew up with deaf parents in the South
and majored in drama at the University of North


. . . AND AFTER —Fletcher dons a good deal of
make-up for her role as Nurse Ratched.


BEFORE . . . Actress Louise Fletcher as she
normally appears.
Carolina, participating in plays
there and doing summer stock.
She worked steadily from 1958
through 1962, when she settled
down to have a family. Her two
boys, 13 and 14,
are "behind me 50 percent," she
says. "They're so used to me
being their mother, they're ambi
valent."
Forman encouraged the actors'
own interpretations of their
characters. "He wanted us to sur
prise him," Fletcher said. Some of
the film's best moments come
from improvisation. This in itself
places Fletcher at the opposite
end of the spectrum from
Ratched.
"Her tragic flaw," Fletcher
analyzed, "(was that) she just
couldn't let anything spontaneous
happen. It would have freaked

her."
Since Forman's direction con
sisted primarily of one-shots,
Fletcher was uncommonly aware
of the camera. "I felt that I ... had
a camera with (me) all day long,
every day ... Nothing's harder to
me than having a close-up and
having to be honest."
Was it hard working with the pa
tients at the hospital, hard to tell
the actors from the inmates? "We
were crazier than they were," she
laughed. "It was hard to tell (the
difference)."
She has nothing but high regard
for both Forman and Nicholson.
Asked what it was like to work the
latter, she replied quickly, "A de
light. Can you imagine it being
hard to work with Jack Nichol
son?" Summing up acting in gen
eral, she smiled. "It's tough — but
I love it."
