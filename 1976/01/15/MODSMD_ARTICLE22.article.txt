# SPOTLIGHT
## Bandsman plays Tube for a night 
### JOEL KOHN 
I confess it — ever since I first
saw the Beatles engulfed by the
screams of prepubescent wor
shippers on the Ed Si'ilivan show,
I've wanted to be a rock star.
Alas, such was not to be my
destiny, and so it came to pass
that my not-inconsiderable musi
cal talents weren't recognized, my
not-consderable academic talents
were, and I came to be that no
man's hero, that Doonesbury of
the West, a Stanford student. I
jwas forded to suppress my ambi
tions and to be satisfied with mak
ing a fool <jf myself at weekend
football games as part of the
LSJUMB.
But on New Year's Eve my
dream came as close to being ful
filled as it possibly could, for in the
course of that evening's fes
tivities, I, along with about 40 other
members of the Stanford Band,
appeared on the Winterland stage
before a sellout crowd helping the
Tubes ring out the old and bring in
the new.
i arrived at the Winterland stage
door at 7:30 where my name was
ticked off a roster and my hand
stamped for identification, then I
proceeded to the Tubes extras'
dressing room. This was a large
room which the band shared with
about 30 other people who were to
appear in the Tubes' act.
During the next few hours I was
to observe a veritable menagerie
enter and prepare to go onstage.
The dressing room was an exer
cise in divine decadence in itself
as men dressed like women,
women dressed like men, a fat
lady, jugglers, Amazons, tap dan
cers, and just about everything but
the kitchen sink came in and put
on their make-up and costumes.
The Stanford bandsmen, no
slouches in the decadence de
partment themselves, stared in
awe of the show going on all
around them.
Meanwhile another show was
going on out onstage as Bill
Graham's New Year's Eve ex
travaganza at Winterland opened
with a set by Eddie Money, a
group deserving of as much
obscurity as it is possible for them
to have. The audience seemed to
react favorably to them, however.
One blonde in the very front row
seemed especially adulatory,
Tabbing at the lead singer's legs
at one point handing him a
wrapped present. I watched and
pondered the possible fringe be
nefits of the rock performer's pro

fession.
Flo and Eddie and the Turtles
came on next, and while their
show duplicated much which I had
previously seen at Stanford my
enjoyment of the set was en
hanced tremendously by my van
tage point which allowed me to
see that Howard Kaylen (Eddie)
was indeed balding on top as I had
suspected. The blonde in the front
row was non-plussed by the whole
set, perhaps turned off by Mark
(Flo) Volman's middle-aged bulk.
In the long break between sets,
I cruised out onto the floor to
mingle with the peons and was
extremely surprised when I
bumped into "Fee" Waybill, lead
singer of the Tubes, also checking
out the crowd.
We acknowledged each other,
one performer to another (I im
agined) and I walked away, bask
ing in my secret knowledge that a
real rock star was loose in the au
dience and nobody knew it but
me.
The Tubes began their set at
11:30.
At midnight the Stanford Band
marched up the aisle to the stage
playing an upbeat "Auld Lang
Syne" and ushering in the Bicen
tennial. Then came the pinnacle of
my existence up to now.
The Band crowded onstage
among scores of performers en
gaged in a mock cocktail party,
and we played "Livin' in the USA."
Oh bliss —my moment in the spot
light had come. There I was with a
performers-eye view of a vast
murky hall filled with the rowdy,
slightly menacing presence of the
crowd.
I was aware of the blinding
lights and the incredible amount of
sound we were making amplified
by a battery of microphones and
joined by the Tubes as they picked
up the chords. We had no sooner
finished the song than we were
pushed off the stage by perfor
mers dressed as Latin American
revolutionaries, and on went the
show.
The Tubes' finale "White Punks
on Dope" was a Bicentennial Ex
travaganza with at least 50 per
formers involved, including the
Stanford Band in the balcony
backing the musicians onstage.
I waited around backstage after
the show for the blonde from the
front row, who I was sure had
been gazing longingly at me as I
played. But alas, I waited in vain,
and so I left Winterland. my brief
brush with rock and roll stardom
over forever.

hanced tremendously by my van
tage point which allowed me to
see that Howard Kaylen (Eddie)
was indeed balding on top as I had
suspected. The blonde in the front
row was non-plussed by the whole
set, perhaps turned off by Mark
(Flo) Volman's middle-aged bulk.
In the long break between sets,
I cruised out onto the floor to
mingle with the peons and was
extremely surprised when I
bumped into "Fee" Waybill, lead
singer of the Tubes, also checking
out the crowd.
We acknowledged each other,
one performer to another (I im
agined) and I walked away, bask
ing in my secret knowledge that a
real rock star was loose in the au
dience and nobody knew it but
me.
The Tubes began their set at
11:30.
At midnight the Stanford Band
marched up the aisle to the stage
playing an upbeat "Auld Lang
Syne" and ushering in the Bicen
tennial. Then came the pinnacle of
my existence up to now.
The Band crowded onstage
among scores of performers en
gaged in a mock cocktail party,
and we played "Livin' in the USA."
Oh bliss —my moment in the spot
light had come. There I was with a
performers-eye view of a vast
murky hall filled with the rowdy,
slightly menacing presence of the
crowd.
I was aware of the blinding
lights and the incredible amount of
sound we were making amplified
by a battery of microphones and
joined by the Tubes as they picked
up the chords. We had no sooner
finished the song than we were
pushed off the stage by perfor
mers dressed as Latin American
revolutionaries, and on went the
show.
The Tubes' finale "White Punks
on Dope" was a Bicentennial Ex
travaganza with at least 50 per
formers involved, including the
Stanford Band in the balcony
backing the musicians onstage.
I waited around backstage after
the show for the blonde from the
front row, who I was sure had
been gazing longingly at me as I
played. But alas, I waited in vain,
and so I left Winterland. my brief
brush with rock and roll stardom
over forever.
I confess it — ever since I first
saw the Beatles engulfed by the
screams of prepubescent wor
shippers on the Ed Si'ilivan show,
I've wanted to be a rock star.
Alas, such was not to be my
destiny, and so it came to pass
that my not-inconsiderable musi
cal talents weren't recognized, my
not-consderable academic talents
were, and I came to be that no
man's hero, that Doonesbury of
the West, a Stanford student. I
jwas forded to suppress my ambi
tions and to be satisfied with mak
ing a fool <jf myself at weekend
football games as part of the
LSJUMB.
But on New Year's Eve my
dream came as close to being ful
filled as it possibly could, for in the
course of that evening's fes
tivities, I, along with about 40 other
members of the Stanford Band,
appeared on the Winterland stage
before a sellout crowd helping the
Tubes ring out the old and bring in
the new.
i arrived at the Winterland stage
door at 7:30 where my name was
ticked off a roster and my hand
stamped for identification, then I
proceeded to the Tubes extras'
dressing room. This was a large
room which the band shared with
about 30 other people who were to
appear in the Tubes' act.
During the next few hours I was
to observe a veritable menagerie
enter and prepare to go onstage.
The dressing room was an exer
cise in divine decadence in itself
as men dressed like women,
women dressed like men, a fat
lady, jugglers, Amazons, tap dan
cers, and just about everything but
the kitchen sink came in and put
on their make-up and costumes.
The Stanford bandsmen, no
slouches in the decadence de
partment themselves, stared in
awe of the show going on all
around them.
Meanwhile another show was
going on out onstage as Bill
Graham's New Year's Eve ex
travaganza at Winterland opened
with a set by Eddie Money, a
group deserving of as much
obscurity as it is possible for them
to have. The audience seemed to
react favorably to them, however.
One blonde in the very front row
seemed especially adulatory,
Tabbing at the lead singer's legs
at one point handing him a
wrapped present. I watched and
pondered the possible fringe be
nefits of the rock performer's pro

fession.
Flo and Eddie and the Turtles
came on next, and while their
show duplicated much which I had
previously seen at Stanford my
enjoyment of the set was en
hanced tremendously by my van
tage point which allowed me to
see that Howard Kaylen (Eddie)
was indeed balding on top as I had
suspected. The blonde in the front

man's hero, that Doonesbury of
the West, a Stanford student. I
jwas forded to suppress my ambi
tions and to be satisfied with mak
ing a fool <jf myself at weekend
football games as part of the
LSJUMB.
But on New Year's Eve my
dream came as close to being ful
filled as it possibly could, for in the
course of that evening's fes
tivities, I, along with about 40 other
members of the Stanford Band,
appeared on the Winterland stage
before a sellout crowd helping the
Tubes ring out the old and bring in
the new.
i arrived at the Winterland stage
door at 7:30 where my name was
ticked off a roster and my hand
stamped for identification, then I
proceeded to the Tubes extras'
dressing room. This was a large
room which the band shared with
about 30 other people who were to
appear in the Tubes' act.
During the next few hours I was
to observe a veritable menagerie
enter and prepare to go onstage.
The dressing room was an exer
cise in divine decadence in itself
as men dressed like women,
women dressed like men, a fat
lady, jugglers, Amazons, tap dan
cers, and just about everything but
the kitchen sink came in and put
on their make-up and costumes.
The Stanford bandsmen, no
slouches in the decadence de
partment themselves, stared in
awe of the show going on all
around them.
Meanwhile another show was
going on out onstage as Bill
Graham's New Year's Eve ex
travaganza at Winterland opened
with a set by Eddie Money, a
group deserving of as much
obscurity as it is possible for them
to have. The audience seemed to
react favorably to them, however.
One blonde in the very front row
seemed especially adulatory,
Tabbing at the lead singer's legs
at one point handing him a
wrapped present. I watched and
pondered the possible fringe be
nefits of the rock performer's pro

fession.
Flo and Eddie and the Turtles
came on next, and while their
show duplicated much which I had
previously seen at Stanford my
enjoyment of the set was en
hanced tremendously by my van
tage point which allowed me to
see that Howard Kaylen (Eddie)
was indeed balding on top as I had
suspected. The blonde in the front
row was non-plussed by the whole
set, perhaps turned off by Mark
(Flo) Volman's middle-aged bulk.
In the long break between sets,
I cruised out onto the floor to
mingle with the peons and was
extremely surprised when I
bumped into "Fee" Waybill, lead
singer of the Tubes, also checking
out the crowd.
We acknowledged each other,
one performer to another (I im
agined) and I walked away, bask
ing in my secret knowledge that a
real rock star was loose in the au
dience and nobody knew it but
me.
The Tubes began their set at
11:30.
At midnight the Stanford Band
marched up the aisle to the stage
playing an upbeat "Auld Lang
Syne" and ushering in the Bicen
tennial. Then came the pinnacle of
my existence up to now.
The Band crowded onstage
among scores of performers en
gaged in a mock cocktail party,
and we played "Livin' in the USA."
Oh bliss —my moment in the spot
light had come. There I was with a
performers-eye view of a vast
murky hall filled with the rowdy,
slightly menacing presence of the
crowd.
I was aware of the blinding
lights and the incredible amount of
sound we were making amplified
by a battery of microphones and
joined by the Tubes as they picked
up the chords. We had no sooner
finished the song than we were
pushed off the stage by perfor
mers dressed as Latin American
revolutionaries, and on went the
show.
The Tubes' finale "White Punks
on Dope" was a Bicentennial Ex
travaganza with at least 50 per
formers involved, including the
Stanford Band in the balcony
backing the musicians onstage.
I waited around backstage after
the show for the blonde from the
front row, who I was sure had
been gazing longingly at me as I
played. But alas, I waited in vain,
and so I left Winterland. my brief
brush with rock and roll stardom
over forever.
