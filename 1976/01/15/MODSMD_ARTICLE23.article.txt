# A 						backstage trip
## Are the Tubes weird? 
### CHRIS BAKER 
A whip, a toy machine gun, a
dildo and a pair of 18-inch boots
lay on the dirty carpet of the Mem
Aud dressing room. In one corner,
Tubes' lead singer "Fee" Waybill
was unpeeling the layers of
makeup that go into his Quay
Lewd sketch.
A groupie, her torn black stock
ings draped over her thin legs,
was shivering in one corner of the
well heated room — asking
everyone if they had any drugs. In
the other corner various
hangers-on were devouring a
table of food.
"Fuck," says Waybill, "I'm out of
cigars." Someone handed him a
cigar. "No, I need some for the
next show," Waybill replies.
The Tubes next peformance of
their tour comes this weekend in
Santa Barbara. It's hardly the kind
of city for a group that is on its way
up. But Waybill says that the
group doesn't want to play bigger
halls.
Avoiding large shows
"We've had offers to play big
places. But we're purposely avoid
ing the large shows," says
Waybill.
Bill Spooner, the group's lead
guitarist adds, "We're turning
down the larger offers. If we did
those shows all we might have
would be giant video screens."
"Fee," had by now changed into
a pair of jeans and a brown tren
chcoat, and he was wearing a pair
of reflecting sunglasses — at 2
a.m.
High on stage?
"Were you high on stage?,"
asked the reporter.
"Do I look high?" replied
Waybill, who plays the drug
crazed Quay Lewd during the
group's finale "White Punks On
Dope."
"Quay?," asks the reporter.
"Just call me 'Fee,' " says
Waybill.
"Audiences wait over two hours

for White Punks' and when it
comes they are often ready to
leave," the reporter persists.
"We had an encore for after
White Punks,'" says Waybill. "But
they weren't supposed to turn on
the lights so soon after the show
tonight.
One-song group
"That's a problem, a lot of
people think we're a one-song
group. But we have a new album,
produced by Ken Scott, coming
out soon," he adds. "I can guaran
tee a future for this group for a
week from Wednesday — that's
when we're booked until."
But there are plans for another
tour and a tour of Europe this
spring. "We're hoping to have a
Tubes' talent contest in each city,"
he says.
"We've got 25 roadies and
they're all in the show at the end.
We like having the Stanford band
because they know the material,
but the turkeys are too expen
sive," says Waybill.
"So we're going to find the weir
dest talent in each city and the

winner will get to appear on stage
with the Tubes,'' he adds.
'Dizzy Heights' joins Waybill,
pouncing on his lap. "Oh yes, this
is Dizzy Heigths, the world's only
female transvestite aerialist. We
got together about six months
ago, and we got these sleazy
female dancers a couple of weeks
ago," he jokes.
"We practice constantly," says
Spooner. "One or two hours a
day,"he laughs. "Here comes
our sympathizer player, Mike
Cotton, he makes all those funny
noises." Cotton finds a spot on
Waybill's other knee.
Cotton starts playing with
Waybill's 18-inch boots. "They're
really not that hard to walk in once
you get used to them," says
Waybill. "But tonight Bill
(Spooner) kept saying fall down I'll
catch you."
Someone asks where the group
is playing next. "We're playing all
the Santas; Santa Barbara, Santa
Ana, Santa Enselmo, San Berdo,
Santa Jose. . . no Santa Stan
ford," says Waybill.
Las Vegas?
"But our show would go over
great in Las Vegas, only they don't
have the balls to have us."
Roger Steen, the group's
rhythm guitarist walks into the
room with a glass of beer from the
party going on downstairs at
KZSU.
"Man this guy has got some re
ally good art films down there,"
says Steen. The reporter snic
kers. "No, this ain't that kind of art,
it's the real stuff," Steen retorts.
The Tubes met each other at an
art school in San Francisco, but
half the group comes from the gay
sensibilities of San Francisco's
Polk Street.
"Okay, I'll be down there," says
Waybill. KZSU lies in the base
ment of Mem Aud. Its walls are
painted like the album cover Dark
Side Of The Moon. And some of
the guests at the gathering would
feel right at home in outer space.
Promo tapes
Waybill and the group step into
a studio to do some promo tapes
for the station. After doing a few in
his normal voice, Waybill slips into
Quay Lewd's cockney voice. A
group has gathered in the tiny con
trol room and is going wild over
Lewd's promo announcements.
A groupie also wanders in. "Hey
man," she asks the reporter, shak
ing for her next fix. "I heard there
were going to be some drugs at
this party." she says.
"Why don't you ask the
Tubes?" the reporter answers.
Guessing game
In other corners of the room the
big guessing game is figuring out
who is a Tube and who isn't.
"I like going to these things,"
says Waybill coming out of the
studio. "They help our White
Punks image."
A man dressed in a full length
black robe approaches Waybill.
"Why don't you sign our copy of
your album?" he asks. "You
wouldn't believe it. This has been
like Tubes' week here."
Waybill turns to the reporter.
"How bad canVegas be after this."

"How bad canVegas be after this."


'Fee' Waybill

SPACE OUT—Tubes' keyboard man Vince Welnick looks like he
just stepped out of Uranus one but we'll never know for sure.
A whip, a toy machine gun, a
dildo and a pair of 18-inch boots
lay on the dirty carpet of the Mem
Aud dressing room. In one corner,
Tubes' lead singer "Fee" Waybill
was unpeeling the layers of
makeup that go into his Quay
Lewd sketch.
A groupie, her torn black stock
ings draped over her thin legs,
was shivering in one corner of the
well heated room — asking
everyone if they had any drugs. In
the other corner various
hangers-on were devouring a
table of food.
"Fuck," says Waybill, "I'm out of
cigars." Someone handed him a
cigar. "No, I need some for the
next show," Waybill replies.
The Tubes next peformance of
their tour comes this weekend in
Santa Barbara. It's hardly the kind
of city for a group that is on its way
up. But Waybill says that the
group doesn't want to play bigger
halls.
Avoiding large shows
"We've had offers to play big
places. But we're purposely avoid
ing the large shows," says
Waybill.
Bill Spooner, the group's lead
guitarist adds, "We're turning
down the larger offers. If we did
those shows all we might have
would be giant video screens."
"Fee," had by now changed into
a pair of jeans and a brown tren
chcoat, and he was wearing a pair
of reflecting sunglasses — at 2
a.m.
High on stage?
"Were you high on stage?,"
asked the reporter.
"Do I look high?" replied
Waybill, who plays the drug
crazed Quay Lewd during the
group's finale "White Punks On
Dope."
"Quay?," asks the reporter.
"Just call me 'Fee,' " says
Waybill.
"Audiences wait over two hours

for White Punks' and when it
comes they are often ready to
leave," the reporter persists.
"We had an encore for after
White Punks,'" says Waybill. "But
they weren't supposed to turn on
the lights so soon after the show
tonight.
One-song group
"That's a problem, a lot of
people think we're a one-song
group. But we have a new album,
produced by Ken Scott, coming
out soon," he adds. "I can guaran
tee a future for this group for a
week from Wednesday — that's
when we're booked until."
But there are plans for another
tour and a tour of Europe this
spring. "We're hoping to have a
Tubes' talent contest in each city,"
he says.
"We've got 25 roadies and
they're all in the show at the end.
We like having the Stanford band
because they know the material,
but the turkeys are too expen
sive," says Waybill.
"So we're going to find the weir
dest talent in each city and the

winner will get to appear on stage
with the Tubes,'' he adds.
'Dizzy Heights' joins Waybill,
pouncing on his lap. "Oh yes, this
is Dizzy Heigths, the world's only
female transvestite aerialist. We
got together about six months
ago, and we got these sleazy
female dancers a couple of weeks
ago," he jokes.
"We practice constantly," says
Spooner. "One or two hours a
day,"he laughs. "Here comes
our sympathizer player, Mike
Cotton, he makes all those funny
noises." Cotton finds a spot on
Waybill's other knee.
Cotton starts playing with
Waybill's 18-inch boots. "They're
really not that hard to walk in once
you get used to them," says
Waybill. "But tonight Bill
(Spooner) kept saying fall down I'll
catch you."
Someone asks where the group
is playing next. "We're playing all
the Santas; Santa Barbara, Santa
Ana, Santa Enselmo, San Berdo,
Santa Jose. . . no Santa Stan
ford," says Waybill.
Las Vegas?
"But our show would go over
great in Las Vegas, only they don't
have the balls to have us."
Roger Steen, the group's
rhythm guitarist walks into the
room with a glass of beer from the
party going on downstairs at
KZSU.
"Man this guy has got some re
ally good art films down there,"
says Steen. The reporter snic
kers. "No, this ain't that kind of art,
it's the real stuff," Steen retorts.
The Tubes met each other at an
art school in San Francisco, but
half the group comes from the gay
sensibilities of San Francisco's
Polk Street.
"Okay, I'll be down there," says
Waybill. KZSU lies in the base
ment of Mem Aud. Its walls are
painted like the album cover Dark
Side Of The Moon. And some of
the guests at the gathering would
feel right at home in outer space.
Promo tapes
Waybill and the group step into
a studio to do some promo tapes
for the station. After doing a few in
his normal voice, Waybill slips into
Quay Lewd's cockney voice. A
group has gathered in the tiny con
trol room and is going wild over
Lewd's promo announcements.
A groupie also wanders in. "Hey
man," she asks the reporter, shak
ing for her next fix. "I heard there
were going to be some drugs at
this party." she says.
"Why don't you ask the
Tubes?" the reporter answers.
Guessing game
In other corners of the room the
big guessing game is figuring out
who is a Tube and who isn't.
"I like going to these things,"
says Waybill coming out of the
studio. "They help our White
Punks image."
A man dressed in a full length
black robe approaches Waybill.
"Why don't you sign our copy of
your album?" he asks. "You
wouldn't believe it. This has been
like Tubes' week here."
Waybill turns to the reporter.
"How bad canVegas be after this."

black robe approaches Waybill.
"Why don't you sign our copy of

Waybill turns to the reporter.
"How bad canVegas be after this."


'Fee' Waybill

SPACE OUT—Tubes' keyboard man Vince Welnick looks like he
just stepped out of Uranus one but we'll never know for sure.
A whip, a toy machine gun, a
dildo and a pair of 18-inch boots
lay on the dirty carpet of the Mem
Aud dressing room. In one corner,
Tubes' lead singer "Fee" Waybill
was unpeeling the layers of
makeup that go into his Quay
Lewd sketch.
A groupie, her torn black stock
ings draped over her thin legs,
was shivering in one corner of the
well heated room — asking
everyone if they had any drugs. In
the other corner various
hangers-on were devouring a
table of food.
"Fuck," says Waybill, "I'm out of
cigars." Someone handed him a
cigar. "No, I need some for the
next show," Waybill replies.
The Tubes next peformance of
their tour comes this weekend in
Santa Barbara. It's hardly the kind
of city for a group that is on its way
up. But Waybill says that the
group doesn't want to play bigger
halls.
Avoiding large shows
"We've had offers to play big
places. But we're purposely avoid
ing the large shows," says
Waybill.
Bill Spooner, the group's lead
guitarist adds, "We're turning
down the larger offers. If we did
those shows all we might have
would be giant video screens."
"Fee," had by now changed into
a pair of jeans and a brown tren
chcoat, and he was wearing a pair
of reflecting sunglasses — at 2
a.m.
High on stage?
"Were you high on stage?,"
asked the reporter.
"Do I look high?" replied
Waybill, who plays the drug
crazed Quay Lewd during the
group's finale "White Punks On
Dope."
"Quay?," asks the reporter.
"Just call me 'Fee,' " says
Waybill.
"Audiences wait over two hours

for White Punks' and when it
comes they are often ready to
leave," the reporter persists.
"We had an encore for after
White Punks,'" says Waybill. "But
they weren't supposed to turn on
the lights so soon after the show
tonight.
One-song group
"That's a problem, a lot of
people think we're a one-song
group. But we have a new album,
produced by Ken Scott, coming
out soon," he adds. "I can guaran
tee a future for this group for a
week from Wednesday — that's
when we're booked until."
But there are plans for another
tour and a tour of Europe this
spring. "We're hoping to have a
Tubes' talent contest in each city,"
he says.
"We've got 25 roadies and
they're all in the show at the end.
We like having the Stanford band
because they know the material,
but the turkeys are too expen
sive," says Waybill.
"So we're going to find the weir
dest talent in each city and the

winner will get to appear on stage
with the Tubes,'' he adds.
'Dizzy Heights' joins Waybill,
pouncing on his lap. "Oh yes, this
is Dizzy Heigths, the world's only
female transvestite aerialist. We
got together about six months
ago, and we got these sleazy
female dancers a couple of weeks
ago," he jokes.
"We practice constantly," says
Spooner. "One or two hours a
day,"he laughs. "Here comes
our sympathizer player, Mike
Cotton, he makes all those funny
noises." Cotton finds a spot on
Waybill's other knee.
Cotton starts playing with
Waybill's 18-inch boots. "They're
really not that hard to walk in once
you get used to them," says
Waybill. "But tonight Bill
(Spooner) kept saying fall down I'll
catch you."
Someone asks where the group
is playing next. "We're playing all
the Santas; Santa Barbara, Santa
Ana, Santa Enselmo, San Berdo,
Santa Jose. . . no Santa Stan
ford," says Waybill.
Las Vegas?
"But our show would go over
great in Las Vegas, only they don't
have the balls to have us."
Roger Steen, the group's
rhythm guitarist walks into the
room with a glass of beer from the
party going on downstairs at
KZSU.
"Man this guy has got some re
ally good art films down there,"
says Steen. The reporter snic
kers. "No, this ain't that kind of art,
it's the real stuff," Steen retorts.
The Tubes met each other at an
art school in San Francisco, but
half the group comes from the gay
sensibilities of San Francisco's
Polk Street.
"Okay, I'll be down there," says
Waybill. KZSU lies in the base
ment of Mem Aud. Its walls are
painted like the album cover Dark
Side Of The Moon. And some of
the guests at the gathering would
feel right at home in outer space.
Promo tapes
Waybill and the group step into
a studio to do some promo tapes
for the station. After doing a few in
his normal voice, Waybill slips into
Quay Lewd's cockney voice. A
group has gathered in the tiny con
trol room and is going wild over
Lewd's promo announcements.
A groupie also wanders in. "Hey
man," she asks the reporter, shak
ing for her next fix. "I heard there
were going to be some drugs at
this party." she says.
"Why don't you ask the
Tubes?" the reporter answers.
Guessing game
In other corners of the room the
big guessing game is figuring out
who is a Tube and who isn't.
"I like going to these things,"
says Waybill coming out of the
studio. "They help our White
Punks image."
A man dressed in a full length
black robe approaches Waybill.
"Why don't you sign our copy of
your album?" he asks. "You
wouldn't believe it. This has been
like Tubes' week here."
Waybill turns to the reporter.
"How bad canVegas be after this."
