# Bergman film a triumph
## 'Magic Flute' joyful 
### ANN HOFFMAN 
In his brilliant adaptation of Mozart's opera The
Magic Flute, Swedish film director Ingmar Bergman
reveals a refreshing and unrestrained joy in the
creative process of art itself, a joy that rarely per
meates the somber subjects of his major films.
Audiences will have little difficulty believing
Bergman's statement that "Making the film was the
best time of my life."
Since first seeing The Magic Flute at the age of 12
and wanting to perform it in his child's marionette
theater, Bergman has maintained a life-long love for
the opera. Consequently he brings to the film not
only the mature vision of an artist but the untainted
wonder of a child.
Love story
A story of the power of love, The Magic Flute
begins as The Queen of the Night (Birgit Nordin)
bids Prince Tamino (Josef Kostlinger) to rescue her
adbucted daughter Princess Pamina (Irma Urilla)
from the hands of Sarastro (Ulrik Cold). The Queen
presents him with a magic flute to aid him in his task,
and commands a cheerful bird-catcher, Papageno
(Hakan Hagegard) to accompany him on his mis
sion.
Upon discovering the princess, the two men learn
that Sarastro is none other than her father, a
Freemason who seeks to save his daughter from the
evil designs of her mother. Tamino then elects to
become a Freemason and after the trials of initiation
he is admitted to the secret order and rev arded with
the love of the beautiful Pamino.
The talkative Papageno, who can not pass the
Freemason's first test of silence, finds what he has
been looking for all along, the compliment to his
need for true love, Papagena.
Well-adapted
In adapting the opera to film Bergman skillfully
avoids sacrificing one medium for the sake of the
other. His actors, all of whom are opera singers, are
both musically talented and cinematically pleasing.
By recording the actual soundtrack before the film
ing Bergman achieves almost perfect sychroniza
tion and prevents the characters from seeming
forced and unnatural.
Though the opera is filmed entirely in a stage
setting, the film opens with several scenes of the
countryside, which crystallize into stage settings as
the overture ends. Thus Bergman transfers the
lifelikeness of film to the artifice of the theater.

When Papageno finally discovers his Papagena,
for instance, the leaves suddenly jump onto the
trees and the whole setting is transformed im
mediately from winter to spring. Throughout the
opera the characters punctuate their songs about
love by holding up placards revealing such
platitudes as "Love is the source of true delight" and
"Love holds the key to each tomorrow."
The characters manage to persuade us that they
believe what the placards say while making us laugh
at the device.
With its intimate vision, the movie camera cap
tures the performers "playing" their roles, such as
the little boy spirits so obviously enchanted with their
own importance.
Using a somewhat cliched though effective con
vention, the film also presents the spectacle
offstage as well as on, as we are shown Papageno
napping backstage before his cue and Saras
tro peeking through the curtain between scenes.
Ideal child
Bergman unfortunately turns the camera on the
audience as well. His focus is usually on a waxen
faced little girl, who looks as if she had been told not
to blink.
She obviously represents for Bergman an ideal
child response to the opera, but unlike the appealing
child actors who play the three spirits, she evokes a
superfluous sentimentality. Bergman demeans his
own work by assuming that the thrill the opera held
for him as a child can only be transmitted to us
through the young girl.
The excellent performances of the carefully
selected cast give credence and life to the highly
romantic story. The appealing and very funny Hakan
Hagegard as Papageno at times almost over
shadows the single-purposed Prince Tamino.
Papageno serves to undercut with comedy any fear
and apprehension involved at the plot.
The conflict of the story is defined solely by the
external forces of good and evil, and it is refreshing
to see Bergman's genius freed for a change from
grappling with internal emotional conflicts. The story
of the Magic Flute also allows Bergman to deal with
the creative rather than destructive power of love.
Bergman has pared down the opera in length in
order to achieve a workable film, and opera lovers
may be disconcerted to learn that the lyrics are sung
in Swedish. However, The Magic Flute with its de
lightful music should please opera buffs and sur
prise the uninitiated.

The talkative Papageno, who can not pass the
Freemason's first test of silence, finds what he has
been looking for all along, the compliment to his
need for true love, Papagena.
Well-adapted
In adapting the opera to film Bergman skillfully
avoids sacrificing one medium for the sake of the
other. His actors, all of whom are opera singers, are
both musically talented and cinematically pleasing.
By recording the actual soundtrack before the film
ing Bergman achieves almost perfect sychroniza
tion and prevents the characters from seeming
forced and unnatural.
Though the opera is filmed entirely in a stage
setting, the film opens with several scenes of the
countryside, which crystallize into stage settings as
the overture ends. Thus Bergman transfers the
lifelikeness of film to the artifice of the theater.

When Papageno finally discovers his Papagena,
for instance, the leaves suddenly jump onto the
trees and the whole setting is transformed im
mediately from winter to spring. Throughout the
opera the characters punctuate their songs about
love by holding up placards revealing such
platitudes as "Love is the source of true delight" and
"Love holds the key to each tomorrow."
The characters manage to persuade us that they
believe what the placards say while making us laugh
at the device.
With its intimate vision, the movie camera cap
tures the performers "playing" their roles, such as
the little boy spirits so obviously enchanted with their
own importance.
Using a somewhat cliched though effective con
vention, the film also presents the spectacle
offstage as well as on, as we are shown Papageno
napping backstage before his cue and Saras
tro peeking through the curtain between scenes.
Ideal child
Bergman unfortunately turns the camera on the
audience as well. His focus is usually on a waxen
faced little girl, who looks as if she had been told not
to blink.
She obviously represents for Bergman an ideal
child response to the opera, but unlike the appealing
child actors who play the three spirits, she evokes a
superfluous sentimentality. Bergman demeans his
own work by assuming that the thrill the opera held
for him as a child can only be transmitted to us
through the young girl.
The excellent performances of the carefully
selected cast give credence and life to the highly
romantic story. The appealing and very funny Hakan
Hagegard as Papageno at times almost over
shadows the single-purposed Prince Tamino.
Papageno serves to undercut with comedy any fear
and apprehension involved at the plot.
The conflict of the story is defined solely by the
external forces of good and evil, and it is refreshing
to see Bergman's genius freed for a change from
grappling with internal emotional conflicts. The story
of the Magic Flute also allows Bergman to deal with
the creative rather than destructive power of love.
Bergman has pared down the opera in length in
order to achieve a workable film, and opera lovers
may be disconcerted to learn that the lyrics are sung
in Swedish. However, The Magic Flute with its de
lightful music should please opera buffs and sur
prise the uninitiated.
In his brilliant adaptation of Mozart's opera The
Magic Flute, Swedish film director Ingmar Bergman
reveals a refreshing and unrestrained joy in the
creative process of art itself, a joy that rarely per
meates the somber subjects of his major films.
Audiences will have little difficulty believing
Bergman's statement that "Making the film was the
best time of my life."
Since first seeing The Magic Flute at the age of 12
and wanting to perform it in his child's marionette
theater, Bergman has maintained a life-long love for
the opera. Consequently he brings to the film not
only the mature vision of an artist but the untainted
wonder of a child.
Love story
A story of the power of love, The Magic Flute
begins as The Queen of the Night (Birgit Nordin)
bids Prince Tamino (Josef Kostlinger) to rescue her
adbucted daughter Princess Pamina (Irma Urilla)
from the hands of Sarastro (Ulrik Cold). The Queen
presents him with a magic flute to aid him in his task,
and commands a cheerful bird-catcher, Papageno
(Hakan Hagegard) to accompany him on his mis
sion.
Upon discovering the princess, the two men learn
that Sarastro is none other than her father, a
Freemason who seeks to save his daughter from the
evil designs of her mother. Tamino then elects to
become a Freemason and after the trials of initiation
he is admitted to the secret order and rev arded with
the love of the beautiful Pamino.
The talkative Papageno, who can not pass the
Freemason's first test of silence, finds what he has
