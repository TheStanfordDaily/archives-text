## Berkeley Rep's 'Arsenic' zany 
### BOB HENRY 
Once again Berkeley Rep has
proved themselves to be probably
the finest theatre group in the Bay
Area. In a small, intimate estab
lishment on College Avenue, one
can pay an almost minimal
amount and see top-notch thea
ter. Currently Berkeley Rep offers
a beautiful rendition of Joseph
Kesselring's 1941 comedy Arse
nic and Old Lace.
Guest-director Michael Addison
harnesses the outstanding indi
vidual talents well and blends a
zany cavalcade of characters into
a cohesive night of hilarious pan
demonium.
The story revolves around Abby
and Martha Brewster (Holly Baron
and Karen Ingenthron), who are
perhaps the kindest mortals in
existence, but have a strange
hobby of poisoning unwanted and
unloved men in order to give one
last moment of peace.
Complications arise, naturally,
and the main instigators are the
aunts' nephews Mortimer, a
drama critic who discovers their
peculiar pastime and decides it
must stop, and Jonathan, who,
after 20 years away, returns
home a mass murderer resembl

ing the monster in Frankenstein
and desires to out-perform his au
nts.
Add a batty brother who be
lieves he is Teddy Roosevelt and
dashes up the stairs (San Juan
Hill) with sword aloft yelling
"Charge!" and giving a teethy
"Bully!" when spoken to, and
madcap adventures result.
Baron and Ingenthron have the
correct blend of innocence, intelli
gence and insanity, with Ingenth
ron adding a tinge of naive uncer
tainty that captures the viewer.
Paul Laramore adds stability as
Mortimer and enables the author
to ridicule drama critics with lines
like, "I'll save time and write my
review on the way to the theater."
The weakest spot in the show is
the character of Jonathan, who
has too many inconsistencies in
his merger of real person and far
cical monster. Enough sight gags
and a few brilliant instances, how
ever, overcome his faults.
An effective, realistic set and
appropriate costuming combine
with good direction and excellent
acting to produce another winner
for Berkeley Rep; yet it only con
tinues a lengthy victory string. For
a fun night out, see it before
Jan. 25.
