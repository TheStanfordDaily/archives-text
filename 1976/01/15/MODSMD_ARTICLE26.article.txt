# A.C.T.'s 'Merry Wives' scores a comic touche
## 
### MILTON MILLER 
A.C.T.'s production of The
Merry Wives of Windsor is about
as fine a performance as one will
ever see of the light-hearted
Shakespearean farce. Director
Jon Jory has enhanced an inhe
rently amusing script by adding
stage directions of his own which
give the humor a slapstick quality.
Ray Reinhardt, whom many will
remember for his brilliant role last
season as Cyrano de Bergerac,
gave an exemplary performance
as the fat knight Sir John Falstaff.
Ray Birk, as the haughty French
Dr. Caius, als" highlighted a pro
duction which is comparable to
A.C.T.'s comic masterpiece of last
season, The Taming of the Shrew.
Fast production
The only one of Shakespeare's
plays to be set in Elizabethan Eng
land, The Merry Wives took
Shakespeare only 10 days to pro
duce. It was written in response to
the personal request of Queen
Elizabeth, who was charmed by
the supremely comic creation of
Falstaff which appeared in the
Henry IV series. Asking Shakes
peare to write a third play about
the fat knight, the Queen included
the instruction that he be in love.
Shakespeare shrewdly
realized, however, that the
Falstaff who robbed and caroused
with Prince Hall in Henry IV could
only rally love — or feel any emo

tion for that matter — at the pros
pect of some pecuniary gain. The
identical letters which Falstaff
sends to Mistresses Ford and
Page are designed to provide him
with access not only to the merry
wives' hearts, but also to their
husbands' purses.
In failing to realize that "wives
may be merry, and yet honest
too," Falstaff becomes vulnerable
to the hilarious pranks which the
wives devise to gain their revenge
on him.
Comic additions
It is in the staging of these
pranks and of the dual between
Dr. Caius and Sir Hugh Evans, a
Welsh Parson, that Jory achieves
his most brilliant comic additions.
The pidgeon-toed attempt of Wil
liam Patterson as Sir Hugh to
master fencing from a manual,
and the disarming of Dr. Caius by
Joseph Bird as the decrepit
Robert Shallow are but two of the
delightful flourishes which origi
nated not from the text but from
the director's wit.
Reinhardt's Falstaff captures
the essence of the fat knight's dis
sipation and senility. Having been
banished from court at the end of
Henry IV Part Two, Falstaff has
become more or less the village
idiot of Windsor.
At the conclusion it is Falstaff
who must ironically and hilariously
wear the horns traditionally re

served for the cuckolded hus
band; it is Falstaff who has been
"cozened and beaten" and made
an object of ridicule.
It is difficult at times to distin
guish the laughter of Megan Cole
from the laughter of the Mistress
Page whom she portrays; the Mis
tress Ford of Fredi Olster is oc
cassionally all too reminiscent of
the character of Katharina which
she played in The Taming of the
Shrew.
A technical problem also arises
when the very winsome Cole,
who was convincing as the love
starved and youthful Abby of De
sire Under the Elms, speaks of the
passage of "the holiday time of my
beauty." But Cole and Olster are
superb comediennes; and their
performances in the basket and
the fat woman of Brainford pranks
are especially well done.
Jack Bennyish
Earl Boen eschews Elizabethan
dialect and mannerisms in his por
trayal of the ultra-jealous Mr. Ford,
giving his performance a Jack
Benny-type quality. Marrian Wal
ters comes closest to the
Elizabethan model and is a splen
did complement to Reinh|ardt's
Falstaff in her earthy, jocular de
piction of Mistress Quickly.
The Merry Wives of Windsor
may come as somewhat of a sur
prise to those who are only famil
iar with the tragedies or more di
dactic comedies of Shakespeare.
It is above all a comic creation
which avoid excessive moralizing
or weightly social commentary in
the desire to thoroughly entertain.
A.C.T..'s production of The
Merry Wives is a sheer delight of
frivolity which Shakespeare in
tended. This is surely the finest of
A.C.T.'s new offerings this sea
son.
