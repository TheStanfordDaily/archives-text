# Gene Clark: ex-Byrd's turn has come
## ROCK 
### JEFF EHRLICH 
Who is this man?
—He was the original co-lead
singer of the Byrds.
—He helped write and sing the
Byrds' third major hit, "Eight Miles
High," as well as much of the
material on the group's first two
albums.
—He became the first Byrd to
go solo, and has recorded a
number of fine folk-rock, country,
and country-rock albums since
doing so.
David Crosby, perhaps? No,
this man is Gene Clark.
Gene Clark was in town with his
new band the week before
Christmas, playing a quality set of
clean L.A.-country-rock at various
Bay Area clubs. Despite the fact
that his post-Byrds music has
gone virtually unnoticed, Clark
showed that he is still — and fi
gures to remain — very much
around.
Search for truth
Through all of his musical
phases, Clark has consistently
demonstrated insightful songwrit
ing, with lyrics that are searches
for truth, whether they are about
love or about life in general.
And his singing style has al
ways been one of the most attrac
tive and subtlely unique in the
folk/country-rock genre, present
ing a voice that sounds gentle yet
pained, highlighted by his delicate
shifts between notes.
Although Clark has these qual
ities, he has somehow received
the least acclaim of the creative
members of the original Byrds.
Roger McGuinn (the group's
lead guitarist and other lead voc

alist) kept the name "Byrds" long
after the other original members
had departed.
Chris Hillman (the Byrds' first
bass player) stayed in the
limelight to an extent with the Fly
ing Burrito Brothes, Stephen
Stills's Manassas, and the re
cently defunct Souther-Hillman-
Furay band.
And David Crosby has become
a near-superstar.
Cult following
Meanwhile, Clark has had, at
best, a cult following (he gets his
biggest audiences in clubs in
Arizona and Texas), even though
his post-Byrds recordings have
had as much strength and value
as those of the others.
Clark is carrying on just the
same, though, and people in the
Bay Area had the chance to check
out his music last month. (He
played two nights at the Keystone
Berkeley, the following night at
Sophie's in Palo Alto, and the
night after that at the Bodega in
Campbell.)
Beatles influence
After his performance at
Sophie's, Clark discussed some
of his personal and musical ori
gins. The Byrds' pop-flavored,
harmony laden melodies (the
music originaly dubbed "folk
rock") seems to have been influ
enced by none other than the Bea
tles.
"I met a guy named Jim
McGuinn (now Roger McGuinn),
and he was singing Beatles
songs," Clark recalled. "I said to
him 'hey man, I know what you're
thinking, and I know what's hap
pening,' and this was before it re
ally even happened, just as they

(The Beatles) were beginning to
break."
Early career
Clark himself was born and
grew up in Missouri. He started his
professional musical career as a
member of the early-'6os folksing
ing New Christy Minstrels. Around
the end of 1963, he heard the
album Meet The Beatles and felt
their sound would be the new
major music. Simultaneously
sensing that the Christy Minstrels
were faltering as a group, Clark
left them, headed for Los Angeles,
and encountered McGuinn.
"We started singing together, and
the only people who picked up on
us were Hoyt Axton and Joe &
Eddie," Clark continued. "They
were the only people who knew
what we knew. Everyone else was
saying 'look at these assholes,
man, doing this Beatles shit.' "
Persistence
Despite that short-sighted
feedback, Clark and McGuinn
persisted in their performance of
Beatles songs, as well as their
own compositions. Soon they
formed a trio with the addition of
David Crosby. In 1964, Crosby in
troduced them to Jim Dickson,
who subsequently became the
Byrds's first producer. Dickson
played them demo tapes just re
corded together by Bob Dylan and
Ramblin' Jack Elliot.
These demos included the song
"Mr. Tambourine Man."
First hit
"So we started working on Dy
lan's material, my material, and
McGuinn's material, and that (with
the addition of Hillman and drum
mer Michael Clarke) became the
Byrds," Clark summed it up sim
ply. "Mr. Tambourine Man" be
came the Byrds' first big hit, and a
main piece of exposure that
helped make Dylan the acclaimed
figure that he is. The rest is his
tory.
After Clark left the Byrds in
1966, his music started to shed
the Beatles/pop influence and
shift more toward country — as
the music of both the Byrds and
other ex-Byrds did soon thereaf
ter.
Clark recorded a solo album,
part folk-rock and part country,

with the help of the bluegrass
picking Gosdin Brothers, Leon
Russell (who handled most of the
arrangements and played
keyboards) and a number of
others including Glen Campbell
on guitar. (Clark later remixed the
album, re-recorded the vocals,
and Columbia Records re
released it in 1970.)
Banjo wizard
In 1968, Clark formed a
bluegrass-rock entity with banjo
wizard Douglas Dillard which re
sulted in two albums, the lively
Fantastic Expediton of Dillard &
Clark and the country-western fla
vored Through the Morning,
Through the Night. In 1971, Clark
made his second solo album,
White Light, a pleasant partial
return to folk-rock.
Clark, along with David Crosby,
was a major co-ordinator of the
Byrds' reunion album in 1973, a
work with which Clark was less
than pleased.
"I felt it was sloppy. We didn't
have enough time to do it, and we
made some mistakes by trying to
produce it ourselves," Clark
commented.
In 1974, he recorded No Other,
his latest recording to date.
Tight playing
Clark's current live act, like the
music of No Other, comes across
as a sharper, more authentic ver
sion of The Eagles. Clark gets per
fectly tight playing from his group,
the Silverado Band, based on the
unerring rhythm of bassist Duke
Bartwell and drummer Marc
Singer, and featuring the
medium-speed choppy licks of
guitarist Roger White exchanged
with the bunched honky-tonk riffs
of pianist John Deffitch. White and
Bartwell provide flawless har
mony, very much like the
rugged-but-clean singing on the
Dillard & Clark albums.
The show featured most of the
songs from No Other as well as a
number of new songs of a similar
musical nature which will presum

ably be on Clark's next album. The
band also performed a few of the
Dillard & Clark classics, including
"Train Leaves Here This Mornin',"
which was co-written with Bernie
Leadon, who later recorded it
again with The Eagles.
Reunion album
Clark and band also serve up a
number of dance rockers in their
sets, including a speeded-up
hoedown version of "Full Circle
Song" (one of Clark's contribu
tions to the Byrds' reunion album)
that featured Bartwell on banjo,
and a harder, less melodic rendi
tion of "Feel a Whole Lot Better."
The latter song, recorded on the
first Byrds album, is probably
Clark's most popular Byrds com
position (local bands played it in
1965 nearly as much as they
played "Gloria" and "Louie
Louie"), and the only one that he
currently performs.
The audience turnout varied
widely between the different
clubs; he packed the Bodega,
while getting a moderate crowd at
his Keystone Berkeley opening,
and an extremely small number at
Sophie's. The crowd sizes made
no difference tg Clark, though.
Surprise solo
In fact, the gig at Sophie's went
especially well, and that intimate
group was even treated to a sur
prise solo rendition ("I rarely play
this song — ever," said Clark by
way of introduction) of "Mr. Tam
bourine Man" for an encore.
The fact that Clark seems to
enjoy playing wherever he is, that
he got a full crowd at the Bodega,
and that he still has followings
around the country is encourag
ing. to say the least, considering
that the man is worthy of much
more recognition than he's gotten
thus far.
"Next time we'll have this place
packed," Clark casually promised
just before leaving Sophie's. If
there is any justice in today's
music, this will indeed be the case.

who subsequently became the
Byrds's first producer. Dickson
played them demo tapes just re
corded together by Bob Dylan and
Ramblin' Jack Elliot.
These demos included the song
"Mr. Tambourine Man."
First hit
"So we started working on Dy
lan's material, my material, and
McGuinn's material, and that (with
the addition of Hillman and drum
mer Michael Clarke) became the
Byrds," Clark summed it up sim
ply. "Mr. Tambourine Man" be
came the Byrds' first big hit, and a
main piece of exposure that
helped make Dylan the acclaimed
figure that he is. The rest is his
tory.
After Clark left the Byrds in
1966, his music started to shed
the Beatles/pop influence and
shift more toward country — as
the music of both the Byrds and
other ex-Byrds did soon thereaf
ter.
Clark recorded a solo album,
part folk-rock and part country,

with the help of the bluegrass
picking Gosdin Brothers, Leon
Russell (who handled most of the
arrangements and played
keyboards) and a number of
others including Glen Campbell
on guitar. (Clark later remixed the
album, re-recorded the vocals,
and Columbia Records re
released it in 1970.)
Banjo wizard
In 1968, Clark formed a
bluegrass-rock entity with banjo
wizard Douglas Dillard which re
sulted in two albums, the lively
Fantastic Expediton of Dillard &
Clark and the country-western fla
vored Through the Morning,
Through the Night. In 1971, Clark
made his second solo album,
White Light, a pleasant partial
return to folk-rock.
Clark, along with David Crosby,
was a major co-ordinator of the
Byrds' reunion album in 1973, a
work with which Clark was less
than pleased.
"I felt it was sloppy. We didn't
have enough time to do it, and we
made some mistakes by trying to
produce it ourselves," Clark
commented.
In 1974, he recorded No Other,
his latest recording to date.
Tight playing
Clark's current live act, like the
music of No Other, comes across
as a sharper, more authentic ver
sion of The Eagles. Clark gets per
fectly tight playing from his group,
the Silverado Band, based on the
unerring rhythm of bassist Duke
Bartwell and drummer Marc
Singer, and featuring the
medium-speed choppy licks of
guitarist Roger White exchanged
with the bunched honky-tonk riffs
of pianist John Deffitch. White and
Bartwell provide flawless har
mony, very much like the
rugged-but-clean singing on the
Dillard & Clark albums.
The show featured most of the
songs from No Other as well as a
number of new songs of a similar
musical nature which will presum

ably be on Clark's next album. The
band also performed a few of the
Dillard & Clark classics, including
"Train Leaves Here This Mornin',"
which was co-written with Bernie
Leadon, who later recorded it
again with The Eagles.
Reunion album
Clark and band also serve up a
number of dance rockers in their
sets, including a speeded-up
hoedown version of "Full Circle
Song" (one of Clark's contribu
tions to the Byrds' reunion album)
that featured Bartwell on banjo,
and a harder, less melodic rendi
tion of "Feel a Whole Lot Better."
The latter song, recorded on the
first Byrds album, is probably
Clark's most popular Byrds com
position (local bands played it in
1965 nearly as much as they
played "Gloria" and "Louie
Louie"), and the only one that he
currently performs.
The audience turnout varied
widely between the different
clubs; he packed the Bodega,
while getting a moderate crowd at
his Keystone Berkeley opening,
and an extremely small number at
Sophie's. The crowd sizes made
no difference tg Clark, though.
Surprise solo
In fact, the gig at Sophie's went
especially well, and that intimate
group was even treated to a sur
prise solo rendition ("I rarely play
this song — ever," said Clark by
way of introduction) of "Mr. Tam
bourine Man" for an encore.
The fact that Clark seems to
enjoy playing wherever he is, that
he got a full crowd at the Bodega,
and that he still has followings
around the country is encourag
ing. to say the least, considering
that the man is worthy of much
more recognition than he's gotten
thus far.
"Next time we'll have this place
packed," Clark casually promised
just before leaving Sophie's. If
there is any justice in today's
music, this will indeed be the case.


SUPERGROUP —The Byrds, seen here on their Turn! Turn! Turn! alhum cover have all gone their separate
ways. Gene Clark (second from left, lower) sports a new look today, and a new clean, together music.


Gene Clark today
Who is this man?
—He was the original co-lead
singer of the Byrds.
—He helped write and sing the
Byrds' third major hit, "Eight Miles
High," as well as much of the
material on the group's first two
albums.
—He became the first Byrd to
go solo, and has recorded a
number of fine folk-rock, country,
and country-rock albums since
doing so.
David Crosby, perhaps? No,
this man is Gene Clark.
Gene Clark was in town with his
new band the week before
Christmas, playing a quality set of
clean L.A.-country-rock at various
Bay Area clubs. Despite the fact
that his post-Byrds music has
gone virtually unnoticed, Clark
showed that he is still — and fi
gures to remain — very much
around.
Search for truth
Through all of his musical
phases, Clark has consistently
demonstrated insightful songwrit
ing, with lyrics that are searches
for truth, whether they are about
love or about life in general.
And his singing style has al
ways been one of the most attrac
tive and subtlely unique in the
folk/country-rock genre, present
ing a voice that sounds gentle yet
pained, highlighted by his delicate
shifts between notes.
Although Clark has these qual
ities, he has somehow received
the least acclaim of the creative
members of the original Byrds.
Roger McGuinn (the group's
lead guitarist and other lead voc

alist) kept the name "Byrds" long
after the other original members
had departed.
Chris Hillman (the Byrds' first
bass player) stayed in the
limelight to an extent with the Fly
ing Burrito Brothes, Stephen
Stills's Manassas, and the re
cently defunct Souther-Hillman-
Furay band.
And David Crosby has become
a near-superstar.
Cult following
Meanwhile, Clark has had, at
best, a cult following (he gets his
biggest audiences in clubs in
Arizona and Texas), even though
his post-Byrds recordings have
had as much strength and value
as those of the others.
Clark is carrying on just the
same, though, and people in the
Bay Area had the chance to check
out his music last month. (He
played two nights at the Keystone
Berkeley, the following night at
Sophie's in Palo Alto, and the
night after that at the Bodega in
Campbell.)
Beatles influence
After his performance at
Sophie's, Clark discussed some
of his personal and musical ori
gins. The Byrds' pop-flavored,
harmony laden melodies (the
music originaly dubbed "folk
rock") seems to have been influ
enced by none other than the Bea
tles.
"I met a guy named Jim
McGuinn (now Roger McGuinn),
and he was singing Beatles
songs," Clark recalled. "I said to
him 'hey man, I know what you're
thinking, and I know what's hap
pening,' and this was before it re
ally even happened, just as they

(The Beatles) were beginning to
break."
Early career
Clark himself was born and
grew up in Missouri. He started his
professional musical career as a
member of the early-'6os folksing
ing New Christy Minstrels. Around
the end of 1963, he heard the
album Meet The Beatles and felt
their sound would be the new
major music. Simultaneously
sensing that the Christy Minstrels
were faltering as a group, Clark
left them, headed for Los Angeles,
and encountered McGuinn.
"We started singing together, and
the only people who picked up on
us were Hoyt Axton and Joe &
Eddie," Clark continued. "They
were the only people who knew
what we knew. Everyone else was
saying 'look at these assholes,
man, doing this Beatles shit.' "
Persistence
Despite that short-sighted
feedback, Clark and McGuinn
persisted in their performance of
Beatles songs, as well as their
own compositions. Soon they
formed a trio with the addition of
David Crosby. In 1964, Crosby in
troduced them to Jim Dickson,
who subsequently became the
Byrds's first producer. Dickson
played them demo tapes just re
corded together by Bob Dylan and
Ramblin' Jack Elliot.
These demos included the song
"Mr. Tambourine Man."

group was even treated to a sur
prise solo rendition ("I rarely play
this song — ever," said Clark by
way of introduction) of "Mr. Tam
bourine Man" for an encore.
The fact that Clark seems to
enjoy playing wherever he is, that
he got a full crowd at the Bodega,
and that he still has followings
around the country is encourag
ing. to say the least, considering
that the man is worthy of much
more recognition than he's gotten
thus far.
"Next time we'll have this place
packed," Clark casually promised
just before leaving Sophie's. If
there is any justice in today's
music, this will indeed be the case.


SUPERGROUP —The Byrds, seen here on their Turn! Turn! Turn! alhum cover have all gone their separate
ways. Gene Clark (second from left, lower) sports a new look today, and a new clean, together music.


Gene Clark today
Who is this man?
—He was the original co-lead
singer of the Byrds.
—He helped write and sing the
Byrds' third major hit, "Eight Miles
High," as well as much of the
material on the group's first two
albums.
—He became the first Byrd to
go solo, and has recorded a
number of fine folk-rock, country,
and country-rock albums since
doing so.
David Crosby, perhaps? No,
this man is Gene Clark.
Gene Clark was in town with his
new band the week before
Christmas, playing a quality set of
clean L.A.-country-rock at various
Bay Area clubs. Despite the fact
that his post-Byrds music has
gone virtually unnoticed, Clark
showed that he is still — and fi
gures to remain — very much
around.
Search for truth
Through all of his musical
phases, Clark has consistently
demonstrated insightful songwrit
ing, with lyrics that are searches
for truth, whether they are about
love or about life in general.
And his singing style has al
ways been one of the most attrac
tive and subtlely unique in the
folk/country-rock genre, present
ing a voice that sounds gentle yet
pained, highlighted by his delicate
shifts between notes.
Although Clark has these qual
ities, he has somehow received
the least acclaim of the creative
members of the original Byrds.
Roger McGuinn (the group's
lead guitarist and other lead voc

alist) kept the name "Byrds" long
after the other original members
had departed.
Chris Hillman (the Byrds' first
bass player) stayed in the
limelight to an extent with the Fly
ing Burrito Brothes, Stephen
Stills's Manassas, and the re
cently defunct Souther-Hillman-
Furay band.
And David Crosby has become
a near-superstar.
Cult following
Meanwhile, Clark has had, at
best, a cult following (he gets his
biggest audiences in clubs in
Arizona and Texas), even though
his post-Byrds recordings have
had as much strength and value
as those of the others.
Clark is carrying on just the
same, though, and people in the
Bay Area had the chance to check
out his music last month. (He
played two nights at the Keystone
Berkeley, the following night at
Sophie's in Palo Alto, and the
night after that at the Bodega in
Campbell.)
Beatles influence
After his performance at
Sophie's, Clark discussed some
of his personal and musical ori
gins. The Byrds' pop-flavored,
harmony laden melodies (the
music originaly dubbed "folk
rock") seems to have been influ
enced by none other than the Bea
tles.
"I met a guy named Jim
McGuinn (now Roger McGuinn),
and he was singing Beatles
songs," Clark recalled. "I said to
him 'hey man, I know what you're
thinking, and I know what's hap
pening,' and this was before it re
ally even happened, just as they

(The Beatles) were beginning to
break."
Early career
Clark himself was born and
grew up in Missouri. He started his
professional musical career as a
member of the early-'6os folksing
ing New Christy Minstrels. Around
the end of 1963, he heard the
album Meet The Beatles and felt
their sound would be the new
major music. Simultaneously
sensing that the Christy Minstrels
were faltering as a group, Clark
left them, headed for Los Angeles,
and encountered McGuinn.
"We started singing together, and
the only people who picked up on
us were Hoyt Axton and Joe &
Eddie," Clark continued. "They
were the only people who knew
what we knew. Everyone else was
saying 'look at these assholes,
man, doing this Beatles shit.' "
Persistence
Despite that short-sighted
feedback, Clark and McGuinn
persisted in their performance of
Beatles songs, as well as their
own compositions. Soon they
formed a trio with the addition of
David Crosby. In 1964, Crosby in
troduced them to Jim Dickson,
who subsequently became the
Byrds's first producer. Dickson
played them demo tapes just re
corded together by Bob Dylan and
Ramblin' Jack Elliot.
These demos included the song
"Mr. Tambourine Man."
First hit
"So we started working on Dy
lan's material, my material, and
McGuinn's material, and that (with
the addition of Hillman and drum
mer Michael Clarke) became the
Byrds," Clark summed it up sim
ply. "Mr. Tambourine Man" be
came the Byrds' first big hit, and a
main piece of exposure that
helped make Dylan the acclaimed
figure that he is. The rest is his
tory.
After Clark left the Byrds in
1966, his music started to shed
the Beatles/pop influence and
shift more toward country — as
the music of both the Byrds and
other ex-Byrds did soon thereaf
ter.
Clark recorded a solo album,
part folk-rock and part country,

with the help of the bluegrass
picking Gosdin Brothers, Leon
Russell (who handled most of the
arrangements and played
keyboards) and a number of
others including Glen Campbell
on guitar. (Clark later remixed the
album, re-recorded the vocals,
and Columbia Records re
released it in 1970.)
Banjo wizard
In 1968, Clark formed a
bluegrass-rock entity with banjo
wizard Douglas Dillard which re
sulted in two albums, the lively
Fantastic Expediton of Dillard &
Clark and the country-western fla
vored Through the Morning,
Through the Night. In 1971, Clark
made his second solo album,
White Light, a pleasant partial
return to folk-rock.
Clark, along with David Crosby,
was a major co-ordinator of the
Byrds' reunion album in 1973, a
work with which Clark was less
than pleased.
"I felt it was sloppy. We didn't
have enough time to do it, and we
made some mistakes by trying to
produce it ourselves," Clark
commented.
In 1974, he recorded No Other,
his latest recording to date.
Tight playing
Clark's current live act, like the
music of No Other, comes across
as a sharper, more authentic ver
sion of The Eagles. Clark gets per
fectly tight playing from his group,
the Silverado Band, based on the
unerring rhythm of bassist Duke
Bartwell and drummer Marc
Singer, and featuring the
medium-speed choppy licks of
guitarist Roger White exchanged
with the bunched honky-tonk riffs
of pianist John Deffitch. White and
Bartwell provide flawless har
mony, very much like the
rugged-but-clean singing on the
Dillard & Clark albums.
The show featured most of the
songs from No Other as well as a
number of new songs of a similar
musical nature which will presum

ably be on Clark's next album. The
band also performed a few of the
Dillard & Clark classics, including
"Train Leaves Here This Mornin',"
which was co-written with Bernie
Leadon, who later recorded it
again with The Eagles.
Reunion album
Clark and band also serve up a
number of dance rockers in their
sets, including a speeded-up
hoedown version of "Full Circle
Song" (one of Clark's contribu
tions to the Byrds' reunion album)
that featured Bartwell on banjo,
and a harder, less melodic rendi
tion of "Feel a Whole Lot Better."
The latter song, recorded on the
first Byrds album, is probably
Clark's most popular Byrds com
position (local bands played it in
1965 nearly as much as they
played "Gloria" and "Louie
Louie"), and the only one that he
currently performs.
The audience turnout varied
widely between the different
clubs; he packed the Bodega,
while getting a moderate crowd at
his Keystone Berkeley opening,
and an extremely small number at
Sophie's. The crowd sizes made
no difference tg Clark, though.
Surprise solo
In fact, the gig at Sophie's went
especially well, and that intimate
group was even treated to a sur
prise solo rendition ("I rarely play
this song — ever," said Clark by
way of introduction) of "Mr. Tam
bourine Man" for an encore.
The fact that Clark seems to
enjoy playing wherever he is, that
he got a full crowd at the Bodega,
and that he still has followings
around the country is encourag
ing. to say the least, considering
that the man is worthy of much
more recognition than he's gotten

"Next time we'll have this place

just before leaving Sophie's. If
there is any justice in today's
music, this will indeed be the case.

ing New Christy Minstrels. Around
the end of 1963, he heard the
album Meet The Beatles and felt
their sound would be the new
major music. Simultaneously
sensing that the Christy Minstrels
were faltering as a group, Clark
left them, headed for Los Angeles,
and encountered McGuinn.
"We started singing together, and
the only people who picked up on
us were Hoyt Axton and Joe &
Eddie," Clark continued. "They
were the only people who knew
what we knew. Everyone else was
saying 'look at these assholes,
man, doing this Beatles shit.' "
Persistence
Despite that short-sighted
feedback, Clark and McGuinn
persisted in their performance of
Beatles songs, as well as their
own compositions. Soon they
formed a trio with the addition of
David Crosby. In 1964, Crosby in
troduced them to Jim Dickson,
who subsequently became the
Byrds's first producer. Dickson
played them demo tapes just re
corded together by Bob Dylan and
Ramblin' Jack Elliot.
These demos included the song
"Mr. Tambourine Man."
First hit
"So we started working on Dy
lan's material, my material, and
McGuinn's material, and that (with
the addition of Hillman and drum
mer Michael Clarke) became the
Byrds," Clark summed it up sim
ply. "Mr. Tambourine Man" be
came the Byrds' first big hit, and a
main piece of exposure that
helped make Dylan the acclaimed
figure that he is. The rest is his
tory.
After Clark left the Byrds in
1966, his music started to shed
the Beatles/pop influence and
shift more toward country — as
the music of both the Byrds and
other ex-Byrds did soon thereaf
ter.
Clark recorded a solo album,
part folk-rock and part country,

with the help of the bluegrass
picking Gosdin Brothers, Leon
Russell (who handled most of the
arrangements and played
keyboards) and a number of
others including Glen Campbell
on guitar. (Clark later remixed the
album, re-recorded the vocals,
and Columbia Records re
released it in 1970.)
Banjo wizard
In 1968, Clark formed a
bluegrass-rock entity with banjo
wizard Douglas Dillard which re
sulted in two albums, the lively
Fantastic Expediton of Dillard &
Clark and the country-western fla
vored Through the Morning,
Through the Night. In 1971, Clark
made his second solo album,
White Light, a pleasant partial
return to folk-rock.
Clark, along with David Crosby,
was a major co-ordinator of the
Byrds' reunion album in 1973, a
work with which Clark was less
than pleased.
"I felt it was sloppy. We didn't
have enough time to do it, and we
made some mistakes by trying to
produce it ourselves," Clark
commented.
In 1974, he recorded No Other,
his latest recording to date.
Tight playing
Clark's current live act, like the
music of No Other, comes across
as a sharper, more authentic ver
sion of The Eagles. Clark gets per
fectly tight playing from his group,
the Silverado Band, based on the
unerring rhythm of bassist Duke
Bartwell and drummer Marc
Singer, and featuring the
medium-speed choppy licks of
guitarist Roger White exchanged
with the bunched honky-tonk riffs
of pianist John Deffitch. White and
Bartwell provide flawless har
mony, very much like the
rugged-but-clean singing on the
Dillard & Clark albums.
The show featured most of the
songs from No Other as well as a
number of new songs of a similar
musical nature which will presum

ably be on Clark's next album. The
band also performed a few of the
Dillard & Clark classics, including
"Train Leaves Here This Mornin',"
which was co-written with Bernie
Leadon, who later recorded it
again with The Eagles.
Reunion album
Clark and band also serve up a
number of dance rockers in their
sets, including a speeded-up
hoedown version of "Full Circle
Song" (one of Clark's contribu
tions to the Byrds' reunion album)
that featured Bartwell on banjo,
and a harder, less melodic rendi
tion of "Feel a Whole Lot Better."
The latter song, recorded on the
first Byrds album, is probably
Clark's most popular Byrds com
position (local bands played it in
1965 nearly as much as they
played "Gloria" and "Louie
Louie"), and the only one that he
currently performs.
The audience turnout varied
widely between the different
clubs; he packed the Bodega,
while getting a moderate crowd at
his Keystone Berkeley opening,
and an extremely small number at
Sophie's. The crowd sizes made
no difference tg Clark, though.
Surprise solo
In fact, the gig at Sophie's went
especially well, and that intimate
group was even treated to a sur
prise solo rendition ("I rarely play
this song — ever," said Clark by
way of introduction) of "Mr. Tam
bourine Man" for an encore.
The fact that Clark seems to
enjoy playing wherever he is, that
he got a full crowd at the Bodega,
and that he still has followings
around the country is encourag
ing. to say the least, considering
that the man is worthy of much
more recognition than he's gotten
thus far.
"Next time we'll have this place
packed," Clark casually promised
just before leaving Sophie's. If
there is any justice in today's
music, this will indeed be the case.


SUPERGROUP —The Byrds, seen here on their Turn! Turn! Turn! alhum cover have all gone their separate
ways. Gene Clark (second from left, lower) sports a new look today, and a new clean, together music.


Gene Clark today
Who is this man?
—He was the original co-lead
singer of the Byrds.
—He helped write and sing the
Byrds' third major hit, "Eight Miles
High," as well as much of the
material on the group's first two
albums.
—He became the first Byrd to
go solo, and has recorded a
number of fine folk-rock, country,
and country-rock albums since
doing so.
David Crosby, perhaps? No,
this man is Gene Clark.
Gene Clark was in town with his
new band the week before
Christmas, playing a quality set of
clean L.A.-country-rock at various
Bay Area clubs. Despite the fact
that his post-Byrds music has
gone virtually unnoticed, Clark
showed that he is still — and fi
gures to remain — very much
around.
Search for truth
Through all of his musical
phases, Clark has consistently
demonstrated insightful songwrit
ing, with lyrics that are searches
for truth, whether they are about
love or about life in general.
And his singing style has al
ways been one of the most attrac
tive and subtlely unique in the
folk/country-rock genre, present
ing a voice that sounds gentle yet
pained, highlighted by his delicate
shifts between notes.
Although Clark has these qual
ities, he has somehow received
the least acclaim of the creative
members of the original Byrds.
Roger McGuinn (the group's
lead guitarist and other lead voc

alist) kept the name "Byrds" long
after the other original members
had departed.
Chris Hillman (the Byrds' first
bass player) stayed in the
limelight to an extent with the Fly
ing Burrito Brothes, Stephen
Stills's Manassas, and the re
cently defunct Souther-Hillman-
Furay band.
And David Crosby has become
a near-superstar.
Cult following
Meanwhile, Clark has had, at
best, a cult following (he gets his
biggest audiences in clubs in
Arizona and Texas), even though
his post-Byrds recordings have
had as much strength and value
as those of the others.
Clark is carrying on just the
same, though, and people in the
Bay Area had the chance to check
out his music last month. (He
played two nights at the Keystone
Berkeley, the following night at
Sophie's in Palo Alto, and the
night after that at the Bodega in
Campbell.)
Beatles influence
After his performance at
Sophie's, Clark discussed some
of his personal and musical ori
gins. The Byrds' pop-flavored,
harmony laden melodies (the
music originaly dubbed "folk
rock") seems to have been influ
enced by none other than the Bea
tles.
"I met a guy named Jim
McGuinn (now Roger McGuinn),
and he was singing Beatles
songs," Clark recalled. "I said to
him 'hey man, I know what you're
thinking, and I know what's hap
pening,' and this was before it re
ally even happened, just as they

(The Beatles) were beginning to
break."
Early career
Clark himself was born and
grew up in Missouri. He started his
professional musical career as a
member of the early-'6os folksing
ing New Christy Minstrels. Around
the end of 1963, he heard the
album Meet The Beatles and felt

hoedown version of "Full Circle
Song" (one of Clark's contribu
tions to the Byrds' reunion album)
that featured Bartwell on banjo,
and a harder, less melodic rendi
tion of "Feel a Whole Lot Better."
The latter song, recorded on the
first Byrds album, is probably
Clark's most popular Byrds com
position (local bands played it in
1965 nearly as much as they
played "Gloria" and "Louie
Louie"), and the only one that he
currently performs.
The audience turnout varied
widely between the different
clubs; he packed the Bodega,
while getting a moderate crowd at
his Keystone Berkeley opening,
and an extremely small number at
Sophie's. The crowd sizes made
no difference tg Clark, though.
Surprise solo
In fact, the gig at Sophie's went
especially well, and that intimate
group was even treated to a sur
prise solo rendition ("I rarely play
this song — ever," said Clark by
way of introduction) of "Mr. Tam
bourine Man" for an encore.
The fact that Clark seems to
enjoy playing wherever he is, that
he got a full crowd at the Bodega,
and that he still has followings
around the country is encourag
ing. to say the least, considering
that the man is worthy of much
more recognition than he's gotten
thus far.
"Next time we'll have this place
packed," Clark casually promised
just before leaving Sophie's. If
there is any justice in today's
music, this will indeed be the case.


SUPERGROUP —The Byrds, seen here on their Turn! Turn! Turn! alhum cover have all gone their separate
ways. Gene Clark (second from left, lower) sports a new look today, and a new clean, together music.
