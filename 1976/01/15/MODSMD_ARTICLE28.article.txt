Gulf top officers quit
PITTSBURGH —Bob Dorsey, under fire
because of an illegal company slush fund
that doled out more than $12 million to politi
cians at home and abroad, resigned yester
day as chairman and chief executive of Gulf
Oil Corp.
The resignation of Dorsey and three other
top officers climaxed a dramatic and extraor
dinary meeting of Gulf's board pf directors.
The two-day meeting ended at about 1 a.m.
yesterday after a 16-hour session that had
directors sending out for meals.
In making the changes, the board ac
cepted the so-called McCloy Report, a 300-
page study of Gulf's legal and illegal political
contributions which found that Dorsey
"perhaps chose to shut his eyes to what was
going on."
The report was prepared by a three-man
committee headed by New York attorney
John McCloy and was turned over to Gulf
directors and the Securities and Exchange
Commission last Dec. 30.
The slush fund came to light in 1973 when
Gulf admitted it had illegally given $100,000
to Richard Nixon's 1972 presidential cam
paign.
The McCloy report quoted one inter
mediary as saying he made secret cash
payments to Senate Republican leader Hugh
Scott of Pennsylvania of $10,000 a year for
about 13 years.
Other Gulf donations included $4 million to
the ruling political party in South Korea.
$627,000 to Italian political parties and a
$108,000 helicopter to the late Bolivian dic
tator Rene Barientos, who was killed when
the aircraft crashed.

Kissinger to go to Moscow
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger said yesterday he will go to
Moscow next week to seek a nuclear arms
agreement in spite of continued Soyiet inter
vention in Angola.
Kissinger told a news conference the im
portance of a strategic arms limitation treaty
is so vital to American interests and world
peace that it overcomes present U.S. Soviet
differences over the Angolan civil war.
The secretary said he is going to Moscow
with "a clear promise" from the Soviet Union
of a significant modification in its most recent
position on the prospective treaty.
Women named diplomat
WASHINGTON — Anne Armstrong was
nominated yesterday as the first woman U.S.
ambassador to Great Britain and pledged to
"work doubly hard to be a credit to this office
and to American women in particular.''
In announcing her appointment, President
Ford said he thought his administration was
"doing quite well" in naming women to gov
ernment posts and "we're going to continue
to do better."
169 killed in Lebanon
BEIRUT — Fighting raged across Leba
non yesterday, leaving 169 persons dead,
the highest daily death toll of the nine
month-old civil war that pits right-wing Christ

ians against leftist Moslems and Palestinian
guerrillas.
A security forces spokesman reported 310
other persons wounded and eight abducted
on both sides. Most of the casualties were
combatants, he said. This brought the over
all war toll to more than 8,750 dead and more
than 26,500 wounded by official count.
Geneva talks in doubt
Israel threatened yesterday to "reconsider
its commitment" to the Geneva peace talks
as Arab nations readied a proposal to ask the
U.N. Security Council to add Palestinian "na
tional rights" to the framework for a Mideast
peace.
Foreign Minister Yigal Allon, speaking to
the Israeli parliament in Jerusalem, warned
that any changes in Security Council resolu
tions on the Mideast could lead to "paralysis,
if not to the abolition" of the Geneva confer
ence
The Geneva conference was convened
after the October 1973 Mideast war, with the
United States and the Soviet Union as co
chairmen. It met once, then recessed to wait
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's per
sonal diplomacy.
Arab countries want the Palestine Libera
tion Organization invited to the next Geneva
session, but Israel refuses to negotiate with
the guerrilla organization and is boycotting
the current Security Council session be
cause the PLO was invited to participate.

position on the prospective treaty.

BEIRUT — Fighting raged across Leba
non yesterday, leaving 169 persons dead,
the highest daily death toll of the nine
month-old civil war that pits right-wing Christ

ians against leftist Moslems and Palestinian
guerrillas.
A security forces spokesman reported 310
other persons wounded and eight abducted
on both sides. Most of the casualties were
combatants, he said. This brought the over
all war toll to more than 8,750 dead and more
than 26,500 wounded by official count.
Geneva talks in doubt
Israel threatened yesterday to "reconsider
its commitment" to the Geneva peace talks
as Arab nations readied a proposal to ask the
U.N. Security Council to add Palestinian "na
tional rights" to the framework for a Mideast
peace.
Foreign Minister Yigal Allon, speaking to
the Israeli parliament in Jerusalem, warned
that any changes in Security Council resolu
tions on the Mideast could lead to "paralysis,
if not to the abolition" of the Geneva confer
ence

United States and the Soviet Union as co
chairmen. It met once, then recessed to wait
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's per
sonal diplomacy.
Arab countries want the Palestine Libera

session, but Israel refuses to negotiate with
the guerrilla organization and is boycotting

Gulf top officers quit
PITTSBURGH —Bob Dorsey, under fire
because of an illegal company slush fund
that doled out more than $12 million to politi
cians at home and abroad, resigned yester
day as chairman and chief executive of Gulf
Oil Corp.
The resignation of Dorsey and three other
top officers climaxed a dramatic and extraor
dinary meeting of Gulf's board pf directors.
The two-day meeting ended at about 1 a.m.
yesterday after a 16-hour session that had
directors sending out for meals.
In making the changes, the board ac
cepted the so-called McCloy Report, a 300-
page study of Gulf's legal and illegal political
contributions which found that Dorsey
"perhaps chose to shut his eyes to what was
going on."
The report was prepared by a three-man
committee headed by New York attorney
John McCloy and was turned over to Gulf
directors and the Securities and Exchange
Commission last Dec. 30.
The slush fund came to light in 1973 when
Gulf admitted it had illegally given $100,000
to Richard Nixon's 1972 presidential cam
paign.
The McCloy report quoted one inter
mediary as saying he made secret cash
payments to Senate Republican leader Hugh
Scott of Pennsylvania of $10,000 a year for
about 13 years.
Other Gulf donations included $4 million to
the ruling political party in South Korea.
$627,000 to Italian political parties and a
$108,000 helicopter to the late Bolivian dic
tator Rene Barientos, who was killed when
