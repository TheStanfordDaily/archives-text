# 'Thursday': the real story from behind the scenes
## 
### DAVE ANSLEY 
Good morning, Stanford! Wel
come to the brand spankin' new
Thursday Daily, our little experi
ment in innovative news packag
ing.
In case you hadn't noticed, the
eight pieces of dirty gray wood
pulp currently propped up on the
other side of your Cheerios bowl
look a little different.
Try to contain your excitement.
Don't drop your O.J. or anything.
Understandably, this radical
change may be a shock to a large
number of readers. Perhaps pro
viding an explanation of the
change will help ease the strain of
adjustment, you know, warm up
the cold turkey a bit. To that end,
may we offer:
You are there
You Are There: Behind the
scenes, in the editorial offices of
the Mid-peninsula's Largest Morn
ing Daily, the Voice and Choice of
the Sunny Santa Clara Valley.
A crisis has arisen. The Thurs
day issues are consistently losing
money. The precious reserve fund
is shrinking rapidly, and theSpec
trum is showing a marked red
shift.
Editor Lame Duck calls an
emergency meeting of the staff.
"Whatever can we do?" he cries,
"Cancel the Thursday Daily,"
comes an already-bored voice
from the back (way in the back).
"Sure, and then change the
banner to The Stanford Daily
Minus Thursday," responds a

more conservative staffer.
"But it's not a bad idea — just
publish on the days we turn a pro
fit," suggests the Econ 1 veteran.
"0.K., so it comes out Monday
and Friday, we change the name,
make a few bucks, and lose our
fee assessment," retorts the Econ
51 veteran.
"Cut costs at the other end. Lay
off one fifth of the staff."
"That works out to a savings of
$12.71 per year."
We fast-forward about three
hours, and discover that the votes
are in: an experimental issue,
combining the main features of
the Daily and Spectrum in a tab
loid size, throwing in some excit
ing new features to attract readers
and ad revenue. Meeting ad
journed.
Volunteers?
Cut (after several commercial
interludes) to: Several days later;
a gathering of those Dumb
Enough To Volunteer Their Ser
vices To The "New Product." Five
people show up.
The flunkie assigned to run the
New Product Project gives his re
port. Things are proceeding nor
mally. Two days from the dead
line, eight of the 16 pages have
been filled. The back eight.
The editor ponders, thoughtfully
chewing the lighted end of his
Tiparillo. "We need to put some
thing on pages one through
eight," he decides, finally. "Any
ideas?"
"Let's print a schedule of up

coming special broadcasts on
KZSU," pipes up Clark Bent..
"That would be fine, except that
what's special is when KZSU
knows what its upcoming
schedule is," comments the flun
kie.
Story ideas
Someone mentions a story on
Pet Rocks, and the agenda wan
ders for a while, as the token
woman in attendance runs
through her rather rude repertoire
of one-liners about rock-petting.
After the others eventually get her
calmed down, the discussion con
tinues.
"I have a scandalous expose on
Honeycomb House, how shoddily
it was designed and built, and why
no one wants to move into it," an
nounces the co-features man.
"Is it sexy enough for pee one?"
inquires the boss, who is still
chewing the wrong end of his
Tiparillo, although it is no longer lit.
"Well actually," admits the jour
nalist, "The people living there like
it just fine, and the only problem
with construction is this girl in ar
chitecture told me she could do
better. A friend of mine is inter
viewing people who didn't move
in, but I can't find him."
Sexy scoop
"We need a sexy scoop for pee
one," persists the ed, who is now
chewing on a letter opener. He
summons the news ed: "Find me
a pee one news story for Thurs
day, or it's off with your head."
The scribe returns minutes la
ter, empty handed, and a swipe of
the letter-opener removes his
noggin. News ed totters off to his
desk, hands no longer empty.
Head chortles gleefully,
"There —now we have a story!"

Try to contain your excitement.
Don't drop your O.J. or anything.
Understandably, this radical
change may be a shock to a large
number of readers. Perhaps pro
viding an explanation of the
change will help ease the strain of
adjustment, you know, warm up
the cold turkey a bit. To that end,
may we offer:
You are there
You Are There: Behind the
scenes, in the editorial offices of
the Mid-peninsula's Largest Morn
ing Daily, the Voice and Choice of
the Sunny Santa Clara Valley.
A crisis has arisen. The Thurs
day issues are consistently losing
money. The precious reserve fund
is shrinking rapidly, and theSpec
trum is showing a marked red
shift.
Editor Lame Duck calls an
emergency meeting of the staff.
"Whatever can we do?" he cries,
"Cancel the Thursday Daily,"
comes an already-bored voice
from the back (way in the back).
"Sure, and then change the
banner to The Stanford Daily
Minus Thursday," responds a

more conservative staffer.
"But it's not a bad idea — just
publish on the days we turn a pro
fit," suggests the Econ 1 veteran.
"0.K., so it comes out Monday
and Friday, we change the name,
make a few bucks, and lose our
fee assessment," retorts the Econ
51 veteran.
"Cut costs at the other end. Lay
off one fifth of the staff."
"That works out to a savings of
$12.71 per year."
We fast-forward about three
hours, and discover that the votes
are in: an experimental issue,
combining the main features of
the Daily and Spectrum in a tab
loid size, throwing in some excit
ing new features to attract readers
and ad revenue. Meeting ad
journed.
Volunteers?
Cut (after several commercial
interludes) to: Several days later;
a gathering of those Dumb
Enough To Volunteer Their Ser
vices To The "New Product." Five
people show up.
The flunkie assigned to run the
New Product Project gives his re
port. Things are proceeding nor
mally. Two days from the dead
line, eight of the 16 pages have
been filled. The back eight.
The editor ponders, thoughtfully
chewing the lighted end of his
Tiparillo. "We need to put some
thing on pages one through
eight," he decides, finally. "Any
ideas?"
"Let's print a schedule of up

coming special broadcasts on
KZSU," pipes up Clark Bent..
"That would be fine, except that
what's special is when KZSU
knows what its upcoming
schedule is," comments the flun
kie.
Story ideas
Someone mentions a story on
Pet Rocks, and the agenda wan
ders for a while, as the token
woman in attendance runs
through her rather rude repertoire
of one-liners about rock-petting.
After the others eventually get her
calmed down, the discussion con
tinues.
"I have a scandalous expose on
Honeycomb House, how shoddily
it was designed and built, and why
no one wants to move into it," an
nounces the co-features man.
"Is it sexy enough for pee one?"
inquires the boss, who is still
chewing the wrong end of his
Tiparillo, although it is no longer lit.
"Well actually," admits the jour
nalist, "The people living there like
it just fine, and the only problem
with construction is this girl in ar
chitecture told me she could do
better. A friend of mine is inter
viewing people who didn't move
in, but I can't find him."
Sexy scoop
"We need a sexy scoop for pee
one," persists the ed, who is now
chewing on a letter opener. He
summons the news ed: "Find me
a pee one news story for Thurs
day, or it's off with your head."
The scribe returns minutes la
ter, empty handed, and a swipe of
the letter-opener removes his
noggin. News ed totters off to his
desk, hands no longer empty.
Head chortles gleefully,
"There —now we have a story!"
Good morning, Stanford! Wel
come to the brand spankin' new
Thursday Daily, our little experi
ment in innovative news packag
ing.
In case you hadn't noticed, the
eight pieces of dirty gray wood
pulp currently propped up on the
other side of your Cheerios bowl
look a little different.
