## Marcuse to begin 'disorientation' week 
### JANICE BRESSLER 
"Disorientation Week: Views from the
Left," a week-long program of speakers,
films and workshops sponsored by the Al
liance for Radical Change (ARC), begins to
night and continues through Jan. 24.
Herbert Marcuse, author and "social
philosopher," will begin Disorientation Week
with a speech at 7:30 tonight at Cubberley
Auditorium. Marcuse will speak on "Manipu
lation in Industrial Society."
Among those presenting their views during
Disorientation Week are some of the coun
try's leading radical activists and theorists,
including: David Dellinger, former Chicago
Seven defendant: H. Bruce Franklin, noted
Melville scholar and tenured associate pro
fessor of English fired from the Stanford fa
culty in 1972 for allegedly inciting an anti-war
riot; Stanley Aronowitz, social historian and
author of False Promises; and David
Du√üois, editor of the Black Panther Party
newspaper.
The purpose of Disorientation Week is to
explore the implications of the radical theory
for social action, according to Terry Bright,
ARC member and one of Disorientation

Week's organizers.
"We in ARC hope that Disorientation will
result in a realization by more people that
action for social change is necessary now,''
Bright said.
Disorientation Week expenses, which
consist largely of speaker transportation
costs and honorariums, totaled about $3100.
Financial support was contributed by the
ASSU Council of Presidents, Campus Affairs
Office, Columbae House, Gay Peoples Un
ion, Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, Office of Residential Education,
Prison Information Center and SWOPSI/
SCIRE.
Each day of Disorientation Week will be
devoted to discussion of one of five themes:
Manipulation in Industrial Society, Re
sources and Development, Power in
America the University and Society and Al
ternatives for Social Change.
