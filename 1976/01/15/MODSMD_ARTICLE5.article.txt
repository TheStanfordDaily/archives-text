# 'Wall' sculpture location rejected
## 
### RANDY BLOCK 
The Committee on Land and Building De
velopment yesterday rejected Canfield mall
as a proposed site for a large wall sculpture.
The committee's vote was 6-3 with two
members absent, said Law Prof. Charles
Meyers, Committee chairman and the new
dean of the Law School.
The site, adjacent to the Law School, was
selected by the subcommittee on outdoor art
(SODA). The SODA presentation at the
meeting was made by Robert Mittelstadt, as
sociate mechanical engineering professor
and SODA chairman, and by Art History Prof.
Albert Elsen.
The Committee will recommend to Presi
dent Richard Lyman that the Canfield Mall
site not be selected.
No decision has yet been made on an al
ternate site, nor even whether the sculpture
will be constructed.

A full-size wooden mock-up of the wall was
erected on the site yesterday. This was done
in order to give committee members an idea
of the size and shape of the wall, as well as its
relation to surroundings and obstruction of
views.
The sculpture would be a wall nine feet
high and 54 feet in length. One side is to be
faced with white brick, with black metal rods
in between the bricks.
"No one on the Committee felt that the
sculpture itself was inappropriate." Meyers
remarked, but the opponents of the SODA
recommendation wished to "get a real
examination of alternative sites."
Law school students, faculty and staff had
also voted against the proposed sites.
