# Theme houses recommended

The Italian and American Studies theme
houses should receive "small group house
facilities" on the Row next year, the Under
graduate Housing Configuration Panel de
cided yesterday.
Of the remaining six proposals, the panel
will continue to pursue means of eablishing a
coeducational feminist house and a kosher
kitchen on campus, according to panel
chairman Paul Sobotka.
"We felt strongly that the Italian theme
house could be as successful as the French
theme house," Sobotka said. "The American
studies house has solid support from within
the academic department and an experi
enced resident fellow," he added.
"We are fully convinced the Housing Office
will accept our recommendations . . . The
committee spent well over 200 person-hours
on this. They were very thoughtful deci
sions," Sobotka concluded.
