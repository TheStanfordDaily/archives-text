# Brown seeking seminary post
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Religious Studies Prof. Robert McAfee Brown's decision
to resign at the end of this year was based on both positive
and negative factors, the renowned theologian, civil rights
advocate and anti-war activist said yesterday.
"I want to get back into the church," Brown said, indicat
ing that he plans to return to seminary teaching as a profes
sor in theology. Prior to his appointment here in 1962,
Brown taught at New York's Union Theological Seminary,
but has yet to decide which of several invitations to accept.
But Brown's decision to leave was to a lesser extent
influenced by the denial of tenure last year to then-Asst.
Religious Studies Prof. Jerry Irish, "because he hadn't met
the publication standards."
Brown, who strongly criticized the University over the
issue and tried to get the decision reversed, said "it's a very
bad message to people who don't have tenure about where
they'd better put their time."
He specified that the issue was a "catalyst" for his deci
sion to leave the University.
Brown has previously been offered positions elsewhere,
most notably the presidency of Union Theological Semi
nary five years ago, but only began seriously considering
leaving last year.
Prof. William Clebsch, chairman of the religious studies
department, disclosed Brown's decision Tuesday, calling
his colleague one of "the most influential teachers of un
dergraduates ever to grace the Stanford faculty."
In his letter of resignation, Brown wrote that his future
should be linked more closely to the church and that semi
nary education is the proper opportunity to fulfill that voca
tion. "It was right to come here in 1962, and it will be right to
leave here in 1976," he wrote.
Brown is currently dividing his teaching responsibilities
between Stanford and the Pacific School of Religion in

Brown's theological convictions carried him out of the
traditional religious realm and into the center of the civil
rights and anti-war movements. The Board of Trustees
approved Brown's original appointment here as a tenured
faculty member without knowing that he was then in a
Tallahassee, Fla. jail because of his civil rights activities.
Later in the 19605, Brown led campus protests against
the Vietnam War. During the last months of that conflict
Brown visited Southeast Asia, but was denied a visa to
enter Vietnam because of his anti-war convictions and
actions.
Brown emphasized that he was "greatly appreciative to
President Lyman and the University" for supporting his
right to engage in civil rights and anti-war activities despite
criticism from some alumni.
Berkeley, a decision he made last year in order to deter
mine if he would prefer returning to seminary teaching.
Brown, a Presbyterian minister, delivered the keynote
address at last month's Assembly of the World Council of
Churches in Nairobi,
Clebsch said the resignation marked the "end of an era in
religious studies at Stanford," noting Brown's reputation
among undergraduates for his teaching ability.
Clebsch announced that Religious Studies Prof. Edwin
Good would head the search committee for Brown's re
placement, although Clebsch emphasized that "the very
notion of replacing Bob Brown boggles the mind "
The search committee, consisting of Assoc Prof. Lee
Yearley and Asst. Prof. Henry Levinson of religious studies,
Asst. History Prof. Carolyn Lougee and Steve Edwards, a
religious studies graduate student, will meet tomorrow for
the first time.
Clebsch said the committee will be looking for "the best
possible candidate," probably in the area of religious and
theological thought since the enlightenment.

Religious Studies Prof. Robert McAfee Brown's decision
to resign at the end of this year was based on both positive
and negative factors, the renowned theologian, civil rights
advocate and anti-war activist said yesterday.
"I want to get back into the church," Brown said, indicat
ing that he plans to return to seminary teaching as a profes
sor in theology. Prior to his appointment here in 1962,
Brown taught at New York's Union Theological Seminary,
but has yet to decide which of several invitations to accept.
But Brown's decision to leave was to a lesser extent
influenced by the denial of tenure last year to then-Asst.
Religious Studies Prof. Jerry Irish, "because he hadn't met
the publication standards."
Brown, who strongly criticized the University over the
issue and tried to get the decision reversed, said "it's a very
bad message to people who don't have tenure about where
they'd better put their time."
He specified that the issue was a "catalyst" for his deci
sion to leave the University.
Brown has previously been offered positions elsewhere,
most notably the presidency of Union Theological Semi
nary five years ago, but only began seriously considering
leaving last year.
Prof. William Clebsch, chairman of the religious studies
department, disclosed Brown's decision Tuesday, calling
his colleague one of "the most influential teachers of un
dergraduates ever to grace the Stanford faculty."
In his letter of resignation, Brown wrote that his future
should be linked more closely to the church and that semi
nary education is the proper opportunity to fulfill that voca
tion. "It was right to come here in 1962, and it will be right to
leave here in 1976," he wrote.
