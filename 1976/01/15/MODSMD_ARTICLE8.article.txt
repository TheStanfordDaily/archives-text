TEN YEARS AGO IN THE DAILY. . .
Monday, January 18, 1965: A graduate student in philosophy leaps
to his death from 285-foot Hoover Tower, the first ever to perform such a
life-defying act. Stanley Theodore Horwitz, from Brooklyn, N.Y., had
completed three quarters of graduate work with a straight-A record. Dr.
Maurice Osborne of the Health Service reports the Horwitz had suffered
from a chronic intestinal condition, and many Stanford officials cite the
health problems as one possible reason for the suicide.
Friday, January 15, 1965: The Associated Press reports:
Washington â€” House Republicans gave their new leader a jolt yesterday
by refusing to elect the man he wanted as his second in command. Rep.
Gerald Ford of Michigan had laid his fledgling leadership prestige and
authority on the line by endorsing Rep. Peter Frelinghuysen of New
Jersey for the job of House whip. Instead, the GOP House members by
secret ballot re-elected Rep. Leslie Arends of Illinois, who has been party
whip for 21 years, by a 70-59 vote. It was Ford's first real test as leader, a
post he won by a scant six-vote margin. Ford conceded that the result
"has some implications" of undermining and weakening his authority.
Thursday, January 14, 1965: An ad on page four: Roommate
Wanted! Separate Bedroom, $35 per month plus share of utilities. Fea
tures include fireplace, dishwasher, patio, 10 minutes from campus.
Monday, January 18, 1965: A Daily investigation of "sexual deper
sonalization" reveals that the male-female ratio has worsened to
2.2568:1. Were the girls distributed evenly, every Stanford male under
graduate would be eligible for almost 9/20 of the co-ed of his choice.
