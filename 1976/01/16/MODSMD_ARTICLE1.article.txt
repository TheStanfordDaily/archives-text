### BERT BOWER 
A secretary in the Department of
Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences,
has filed a civil suit alleging that she
was attacked and beaten by her boss.
Psychiatry and Psychology Prof. Karl
Pribram, the Daily has learned.
Barbara Honegger. who was Prib
ram's personal secretary, has asked
$25,000 general damages, $25,000
punitive damages and $47.35 medical
damages in hersuitfiled Dec. 17,1975,
in Santa Clara County Superior Court.
In the suit, Honegger claims the in
cident occurred Oct. 29, 1975, when
she was working alone in her office
adjacent to Pribram's in Jordan Hall.
Her suit reads in part: "At approxi
mately 5:45 (p.m.) defendant entered
the office and after a brief exchange
with plaintiff, went into a violent fit of

anger and willfully, intentionally and
maliciously assaulted, beat and struck
plaintiff in and about the head, face
and upper body, smashing and bend
ing the frames of her eyeglasses
against her temple and the bridge of
her nose."
No comment
Pribram refused comment on any of
the charges. His lawyer, Leon Shiells,
withheld comment on the specific al
legations, saying, "The lawsuit is best
determined in the courts if the matter
proceeds that far."
Legal Adviser to the President
James Siena told the Daily, "The Uni
versity has taken official cognizance of
the matter. The University's statement
on faculty discipline provides that
matters of this sort are to be treated in
confidence. We, thus, have nothing to
say other than the matter is under ac
tive consideration."
Pribram, 56, accepted an associate
professorship here in 1959 and became
a full professor of psychiatry and
psychology in 1962. He gave up an
active practice as a neurosurgeon to do
research exploring brain functions and
became an internationally prominent
expert on neuropsychology.
Colleagues describe him as "bril
liant," "incredibly productive" and
"one of the University's top resear
chers."
'Flare-ups'
But one of her former secretaries
said, "The job was extremely high
pressured and his temper often flared.
These flare-ups were not only directed
at me, but at whomever was around."
Another former secretary said, "The
degree of Pribram's anger was totally
inappropriate to situations. He often
screamed at me and 1 never knew when
he was going to explode.
"Although nearly everyone in the

lab was subject to an occasional attack,
his secretary usually received the
brunt of his anger," she added.
Honegger, a 28-year-old graduate
student at large, had been a student of
Pribram's and became his personal
secretary in September 1974.
Honegger's suit alleges that on the
night of the incident she was alone in
the office with Pribram when the "de
fendant intentionally trapped her at
her desk, (delivered) blows to the front
of her body and began to beat her vio
lently on her back" before she was able
to get away.
Sought advice
She said she then drove to the home
of Dr. and Mrs. James Dewson to seek
advice on reporting the incident. Dew
son, the head of Hearing and Speech
Sciences in the Medical School, is a
colleague of Pribram's. He said he is
also a friend and ex-professor of Hon
egger's.
"I discouraged her from going to the
police at all as I felt it wasn't the proper
thing to do at the time," Dewson said
in a Daily interview.
Mrs. Dewson said she tried "to calm
down Barbara" while they discussed
with her the "range of possibilities of
what should be done." She continued,
"Barbara was crying and had her glas
ses bent. I gave her a cold rag."
Honegger then went to the
emergency room at the Stanford Medi
cal Center where she says she was
treated by resident intern William
Kirby and Dr. Gregory Vagshenian. At
the emergency room, former Stanford
police officer Wayne Warwick took an
official report of the incident, with
Honegger's consent.
The captain of the Stanford police
investigation bureau, Walter Konar,
confirmed that "statements from both
Pribram and Honegger were collected

and sent to the district attorney's of
fice."
'No criminal charges'
Konar said Deputy Dist. Atty. Joan
Brennan, of the Santa Clara County
District Attorney's office, declined to
file a complaint against Pribram.
Brennan refused to comment on
grounds that "there are no criminal
charges in this case."
Honegger received permission from
the personnel coordinator of the Medi
cal School, Rosemary Hornby, not to
return to her job with Pribram. Hornby
informed her that the University
would continue to pay her and would
help her find another job. Honegger is
currently working as a tempor y
retary in the Medical School's Cene
tics Department.
Hornby advised Honegger that her
current position is only temporary and
that she must accept the next job the
University offers her.
In u letter to Honegger dated Dec. 11,
Hornby stated, "If a position is offered
to you by the University at your cur
rent salary and classification and is re
fused by you the University's com
mitment will have been fulfilled."
During November, Shiellsand Siena
attempted to reach a negotiated set
tlement in private over the alleged in
cident, according to Honegger's
lawyer, James Wolprnan.
Close to agreement?
"In fact," Wolpman said, "the day
Pribram was served with the civil suit I
suspect he was about to sign an agree
ment with the University."
Wolpman said, however, that Hon
egger was not informed of the terms of
the agreement.
Shiells said, "My office has had
numerous contacts with the Stanford
administration, and every effort has
