Dick Stovell's letter to the
Daily of Jan. 12 raises significant
questions concerning the rights
of employes to picket during the
term of a collective bargaining
agreement.
As an institution of higher
learning dedicated to the ad-,
vancement of knowledge and'
understanding through the free
dissemination of information,
the University has been and re
mains concerned that its actions
respect constitutional guaran
tees even though it is not a pub
lic entity and hence is not bound
to do so.
To this end it is important to
distinguish between the kinds of
activities the contract between
the University and United Stan-j
ford Employes (USE) prohibits
and those which it does not.
Contract
The contract does not prohibit
dissemination of information by
the union or employes concern
ing the union's position in a
labor dispute, whether by leaf
letting or other means — short of
picketing. .
It does quite explicitly pro
hibit picketing: the patrolling of
an area by individuals carrying
placards on sticks.
The United States Supreme
Court has repeatedly made clear
that picketing constitutes more
than speech which is constitu
tionally protected. Picketing is
also conduct which takes on par
ticular significance in this soci
ety when it occurs in the context
of a labor dispute.
The current situation at Stan
ford exemplifies some of the po
tential problems connected with
picketing. USE placed picket
lines in front of the Old Pavilionf
(which houses the University's
personnel office and some other
administrative functions) and in
front of Encina Hall (the princi
pal administrative building for
the University).
Crossing line
USE representatives sought to
advise delivery trucks and
employes that the picket line
was informational and could be
crossed. Nevertheless, one truck
was observed turning away.
The union leadership, of
course, had participated in bar
gaining sessions where the na
ture of the limitation on the Un
ion's conduct during a dispute
had been expressly and candidly
discussed.
Why would the union persist
in placing pickets rather than
merely disseminating leflets if
its only interest was to inform
the public?
I think that's a fair question,
but I can't think of an answer.

The union leadership, of
course, had participated in bar
gaining sessions where the na

merely disseminating leflets if
its only interest was to inform
the public?
I think that's a fair question,
but I can't think of an answer.
