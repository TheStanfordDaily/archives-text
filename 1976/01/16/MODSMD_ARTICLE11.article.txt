# Horton v. frats: round two
## Fraternities revive housing polemic 
### STEPHEN CROLIUS 
Every undergraduate has now had one full
quarter to evaluate the newly-inaugurated
Guaranteed Housing Flan. Judging by the lack
of clearly-voiced complaints, most seem to
find the plan an acceptable alternative to last
year's confusion.
The fraternity system, however, undoub
tedly is the party who felt itself to be most
compromised by the adoption of the Guaran
teed Housing Plan, has submitted four propos
als which it contends will improve the general
housing situation.
While the fraternity system's controlling
body, Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) has im
plicitly acknowledged the overall workability
of the plan by not suggesting greater modifica
tions than the relatively modest four, it does
seem to believe that there actually are three
unjust features in the plan.
In a letter to Norman Robinson, assistant
dean of housing, outlining the IFC proposals,
IFC President Bob Ottilie states that he believes
"the changes proposed by the Council all fall
within the concept 'of access' for all
undergraduates and contribute significantly to
the IFC's and the University's stated goal of a
'strong, healthy and positive fraternity sys
tem.' "
System discourages balance
First, the IFC contends that the present sys
tem is not the best possible way to maintain a
balance between the number of spaces in the
fraternity system and the number in the regular
University residence system.
Under the present system, a house may be
taken away from the fraternity system and
placed in the regular University residence sys
tem if the fraternity system as a whole is not
filled to full capacity for two conscutive years
or if any particular house is not filled to capac
ity for three out of four years.
The proposal recommends dropping the

second clauses, stating that "responsibility for
determining whether or not a house is func
tioning well as a fraternity should be left up to
the IFC with aid from the housing office."
The IFC reasons that just because one par
ticular fraternity is not able to attract enough
new members to fill up its spaces each year,
this does not necessarily reflect a lack of de
mand for fraternity housing. It contends that
another national fraternity in the place of the
weak fraternity may be able to fill up the house.
Appearance and reality
Discussing this proposal, Assoc. Dean of
Siudent Affairs Larry Horton drew a distinc
tion last Tuesday between apparent demand
for a given type of housing and actual demand.
Considering a hypothetical situation in which
the fraternity system exceeded its quota, Hor
ton asked, "Is the demand for fraternities or for
small group living?
"What you would have to prove," he con
tinued, "is that the demand for fraternities is
greater than the demand for equivalent small
group living."
The second IFC proposal suggests that the
addition of a clause would make the regula
tions more efficient. It recommends "includ
ing in the regulations a penalty for the Univer
sity if it misses its quota. Whenever the Univer
sity misses its quota, it too should have to re
linquish a house. The number of houses pro
vided for the fraternity system would then be
able to expand, as well as contract, as demand
for this type of living option fluctuates."
Is quota illusory?
Regarding this proposal Horton said, "How
you can get the notion that the University has a
quota makes no sense to me at all.
"The University draw is nothing more than a
procedure for allowing students to choose the
place they want to live. The University draw
system never assigns anybody anything they
don't want.
The IFC also contends that the fraternity sys
tem should receive an appropriate percentage
of any new housing that becomes available.
"Otherwise," states Ottilie in the letter, "as
living spaces demanded and supplied con
tinue towards equilibrium, demand for the
spaces in fraternities will continue to run way
ahead of supply."
Overcrowding suggestion
The fourth IFC proposal urges that over
crowding — accomodating a greater number of
residents than a house was originally designed
for — be allowed on a permanent basis.
The proposal states that "overcrowding does
not interfere with the goal of equal access. It
may allow fraternity members a chance to live
on campus more quarters than a University
resident, although the fraternity member
would still be guaranteed only two years in the
house."
Horton admitted that some changes in the
Guaranteed Housing Flan may be necessary,
saying, "l think we should make modifications

in the direction of supporting fraternities so far
as they (the modifications) don't violate any of
the fundamental principles that the system is
made up under.
"Remember, the whole system was erected
to make sure that all the living groups on
campus fit under one broad umbrella — so that
everyone is in the same ballpark."
But whatever the result of the current dis
pute between the fraternities and Horton.one
thing seems certain — students outside the frat
system aren't as interested in the struggle as
they were last year when changes in their own
housing arrangements were under considera
tion.
