# Cowell: more than band aids
## 
### KAREN CAESAR 
You have a headache. Your sinuses are
backed up for miles, you have the Pacific
Ocean in your lungs, and you're out of
Kleenex. To top it all off, you flunked your
German dictation test because you couldn't
hear the teacher. What do you do?
If you are like many Stanford students, you'll
stumble over to the Cowell student Health
Center to get a few things cleared up, like your
head. After all the money you pay to go here,
you're entitled, right? Tuition money must be
good for something besides education.
Well, maybe.
"A lot of people come to Cowell sometimes
for minor illnesses they should be able to take
care of on their own, primarily colds," said
Cowell staff doctor John Dorman. "This adds to
waiting time and it adds to the cost. More
money is tacked on to tuition."
The idea behind Cowell is student health;
students should go there when they need
something they cannot provide for themselves,

whether it is an accurate diagnosis, prescrip
tion antibiotics, or oral contraceptives. Dor
man contended.
Contraceptive mysteries
About those oral contraceptives — how does
Cowell prescribe them?
"We don't make moral judgments," Dorman
said. Any Stanford student desiring birth con
trol is welcome to come in and discuss the
matter. Both patient and doctor together de
termine the best method.
The recent controversy regarding the "se
quential" form of the birth control pill and
Cowell's use of it has left many students ques
tioning Cowell ethics. The Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), has made preliminary
attempts to withdraw the sequential from the
market because of suspected links with cancer
of the lining of the uterus.
However, currently it is still on the market.
In any case, the only time Cowell physicians
usually prescribe this form of birth control pill
is when the patient has been started on them by
, her home doctor. "I can't remember the last
time I started someone on them," Dorman said.
Neither can many of the other Cowell physi
cians.
Drawing the line
When does Cowell finally stop prescribing a
drug with questionable side-effects?" This
doesn't happen very often," said Dorman.
However, there are exceptions to the rule.
For example, Diethyl Stilbesterol (DES), a
component in one form of the infamous
"morning-after" pill, is "technically still on
the market," Dorman noted.
But Cowell doesn't use it, Dorman said. DES
has been shown to have connections with vag
inal cancer in adolescent girls whose mothers
took DES in a form other than the morning
after pill during pregnancy.
Dye is on black list
Another exception is neutral red dye, which
is used in the treatment of Herpes infections.
After treatment, there is occasionally an "in
creasing likelihood of cancerous changes. We

pretty much decided not to use it anymore. But
if any of the individual doctors wants to use it
they can.
I have done it on occasion," Dorman said.
But Dorman said he thoroughly discusses
the medication in question and the possible
side and aftereffects with his patients. "People
shouldn't be on pills unless they understand
what the possible side effects are," saidDor
man. "As long as they understand them,
it's all fine with me."
When it comes to informing parents of any
thing serious, whether it is illness or use of the
pill, "we can't unless the student allows it,"
said Dorman.
"I generally use my own judgment."
He gave the example of students very ill with
gonorrhea or pneumonia. Whereas he would
not feel as hesitant about informing parents of
the latter, he would think twice about the
gonorrhea.
One must be "discrete" in situations of this
kind. But a student's medical chart can not be
released unless the student permits it, Doran
explained.
Increased pregnancies
Pregnancies here have been on the increase,
as has been noted in such newspapers as the
Los Angeles Times as well as the San Fran
cisco Chronicle. But is Stanford unique in this
trend?
"1 doubt it," Dorman said. "The trend is ap
parently a national one." Many women have
been scared off by the Pill because of much
adverse publicity linking it with everything
from cancer to blood clots, Dorman noted.
Cowell is for Stanford students. It exists so
that they can maintain their health while
they're here, even during finals.
Most of the Cowell doctors have time set
aside both for appointments and for seeing pa
tients who just walk in.
So there it is. Cowell shouldn't have to act as
your surrogate mother, but it's here when your
temperature climbs to 105.
And that's a comforting thought.

"1 doubt it," Dorman said. "The trend is ap
parently a national one." Many women have
been scared off by the Pill because of much
adverse publicity linking it with everything
from cancer to blood clots, Dorman noted.
Cowell is for Stanford students. It exists so
that they can maintain their health while
they're here, even during finals.
Most of the Cowell doctors have time set
aside both for appointments and for seeing pa
tients who just walk in.
So there it is. Cowell shouldn't have to act as
your surrogate mother, but it's here when your
temperature climbs to 105.
And that's a comforting thought.


Bob Ottilie
You have a headache. Your sinuses are
backed up for miles, you have the Pacific
Ocean in your lungs, and you're out of
Kleenex. To top it all off, you flunked your
German dictation test because you couldn't
hear the teacher. What do you do?
If you are like many Stanford students, you'll
stumble over to the Cowell student Health
Center to get a few things cleared up, like your
head. After all the money you pay to go here,
you're entitled, right? Tuition money must be
good for something besides education.
Well, maybe.
"A lot of people come to Cowell sometimes
for minor illnesses they should be able to take
care of on their own, primarily colds," said
Cowell staff doctor John Dorman. "This adds to
waiting time and it adds to the cost. More
money is tacked on to tuition."
The idea behind Cowell is student health;
students should go there when they need
something they cannot provide for themselves,

whether it is an accurate diagnosis, prescrip
tion antibiotics, or oral contraceptives. Dor
man contended.
Contraceptive mysteries
About those oral contraceptives — how does
Cowell prescribe them?
"We don't make moral judgments," Dorman
said. Any Stanford student desiring birth con
trol is welcome to come in and discuss the
matter. Both patient and doctor together de
termine the best method.
The recent controversy regarding the "se
quential" form of the birth control pill and
Cowell's use of it has left many students ques
tioning Cowell ethics. The Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), has made preliminary
attempts to withdraw the sequential from the
market because of suspected links with cancer
of the lining of the uterus.
However, currently it is still on the market.
In any case, the only time Cowell physicians
usually prescribe this form of birth control pill
is when the patient has been started on them by
, her home doctor. "I can't remember the last
time I started someone on them," Dorman said.
Neither can many of the other Cowell physi
cians.
Drawing the line
When does Cowell finally stop prescribing a
drug with questionable side-effects?" This
doesn't happen very often," said Dorman.
However, there are exceptions to the rule.
For example, Diethyl Stilbesterol (DES), a
component in one form of the infamous
"morning-after" pill, is "technically still on
the market," Dorman noted.
But Cowell doesn't use it, Dorman said. DES
has been shown to have connections with vag
inal cancer in adolescent girls whose mothers
took DES in a form other than the morning
after pill during pregnancy.
Dye is on black list
Another exception is neutral red dye, which
is used in the treatment of Herpes infections.
After treatment, there is occasionally an "in
creasing likelihood of cancerous changes. We

pretty much decided not to use it anymore. But
if any of the individual doctors wants to use it
they can.
I have done it on occasion," Dorman said.
But Dorman said he thoroughly discusses
the medication in question and the possible
side and aftereffects with his patients. "People
shouldn't be on pills unless they understand
what the possible side effects are," saidDor
man. "As long as they understand them,
it's all fine with me."
When it comes to informing parents of any
thing serious, whether it is illness or use of the
pill, "we can't unless the student allows it,"
said Dorman.
"I generally use my own judgment."
He gave the example of students very ill with
gonorrhea or pneumonia. Whereas he would
not feel as hesitant about informing parents of
the latter, he would think twice about the
gonorrhea.
One must be "discrete" in situations of this
kind. But a student's medical chart can not be
released unless the student permits it, Doran
explained.
Increased pregnancies
Pregnancies here have been on the increase,
as has been noted in such newspapers as the
Los Angeles Times as well as the San Fran
cisco Chronicle. But is Stanford unique in this
trend?

said Dorman.
"I generally use my own judgment."
He gave the example of students very ill with
gonorrhea or pneumonia. Whereas he would
not feel as hesitant about informing parents of
the latter, he would think twice about the
gonorrhea.
One must be "discrete" in situations of this
kind. But a student's medical chart can not be
released unless the student permits it, Doran
explained.
Increased pregnancies
Pregnancies here have been on the increase,
as has been noted in such newspapers as the
Los Angeles Times as well as the San Fran
cisco Chronicle. But is Stanford unique in this
trend?
"1 doubt it," Dorman said. "The trend is ap
parently a national one." Many women have
been scared off by the Pill because of much
adverse publicity linking it with everything
from cancer to blood clots, Dorman noted.
Cowell is for Stanford students. It exists so
that they can maintain their health while
they're here, even during finals.
Most of the Cowell doctors have time set
aside both for appointments and for seeing pa
tients who just walk in.
So there it is. Cowell shouldn't have to act as
your surrogate mother, but it's here when your
temperature climbs to 105.
And that's a comforting thought.
