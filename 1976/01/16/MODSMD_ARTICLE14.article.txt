## Elementary school takes students back to basics 
### SHERI BEBB 
An elementary school in Palo
Alto that emphasizes discipline
and the "fundamentals" has a
waiting list of 250 children
which is "growing every day,"
according to Principal Walter H.
Clark.
Hoover Elementary School is a
structured alternative to elemen
tary education in the Palo Alto
Unified School District.
"I wish they had had that kind
of school when my kids were
younger," one Palo Alto mother
said.
In the last decade, the open

ended philosophy of education
in the United States has em
phasized children's individual
approaches to learning and the
need for each child to be treated
differently.
At Hoover, however, all chil
dren are taught the same "fun
damental" skills and are ex
pected to achieve a certain de
gree of competency in them.
"We're kind of the guiding
light for the U.S." in traditional
education, Clark says. "We're
small, but we're having quite a
bit of impact across the U.S."
One principal came from Ohio to

see how the school operates.
National test scores show the
results. Cupertino School Dis
trict issued a report earlier this
year showing that the children
in a program similar to Hoovers',
the Cupertino Academic Plus
Program, had an average grade
equivalent growth of 1.2 in read
ing, 1.1 in language arts and 1.1
in math as compared to the na
tional average growth of 0.5 in
all areas.
Hoover started when some
mothers complained that the
existing school system did not
meet their children's educa

tional needs.
In response to their request,
the Palo Alto School Board late
in 1973 appointed a Superinten
dent's Advisory Committee to
formulate concrete objectives
and to determine parental in
terest in a more structured
school.
Clark feels the move towards
more structure in education is a
"reaction against the progres
sive movement."
Back to basics
In the 19605, educators tried
many "inventive forms of ex
perimentation in education,"
says Gail McCutcheon, director
of the undergraduate program in
the School of Education at Stan
ford. But there is a trend back to
more traditional approaches as
doubts about the effectiveness of
the new techniques grow.
Parents are worried that their
children aren't learning the
"three Rs," McCutcheon says,
and aren't receiving adequate
discipline in school. Another
complaint is that teachers are
being "bogged down by discip
line problems," Clark says.
At Hoover, however, things
are different.
Children are taught basic
knowledge and skills in math,
science, English, grammar, his
tory, art and music.
Strictly academic
While progressive educators
stress the importance of the

learning that takes place outside
of textbooks, Hoover School em
phasizes academics.
Children have homework four
nights a week to "establish good
study skills" and to learn re
sponsibility in completing their
work, Clark says. Crades and
tests are given to measure stu
dent progress, "The goal," he
says, "is to bring every child up
to 'grade level.' "
While progressive educators
advocate an open learning envi
ronment which encourages
children to explore and interact
with their peers, teachers at
Hoover are expected to maintain
a "quiet and orderly classroom."
Manners stressed
Politeness and manners are
also stressed. "We do not toler
ate profanity," Clark says. Chil
dren are taught to "respect the
rights of others."
"I don't think you'll find any
child who is out there who is
unhappy" at Hoover, he says.
Some2oof the 26 children now
in sixth grade have chosen to
stay at Hoover for seventh grade
next year instead of entering a
junior high school.
Not all reaction to the new
school has been so enthusiastic,
however. When parents in Cres
cent Park were asked to decide
whether they wanted the struc
tured school in their area, some
responded with a bulletin say
ing, "We feel that children are

individuals. They develop at dif
ferent paces, respond best to dif
ferent teaching styles, and learn
in different environments."
'Too inflexible'
The memo went on to say that
"children who remained at the
(traditional) school would be re
quired to participate in an inflex
ible program regardless of their
needs."
Despite the criticism, some
people are sold on the idea of
traditional education. This year

the school had 150 students in
first to sixth grade. Next year it
will be expanded to kindergar
ten through seventh grade with
two classes each of fifth and
sixth graders.
Parents showed their en
thusiasm for the new school last
September on registration day
when they lined up outside
Hoover at 4:30 in the morning to
enroll their children. Registra
tion started at 8:00. By 8:20 the
school was filled.
