## Kent State riots...over $15 hike 
### 
A Board of Trustees meeting broke clown into a
scuffling match between students and police at
Kent State last week, all over a $15 tuition hike.
Five persons, including one policeman, were
injured in the battle, when 100 students, led by
the Revolutionary Student Brigade, tried to break
through a police barrier guarding the board's
meeting room.
At a school where the notion of $3850 tuitions
doesn't exist, the $15 raise has been a heated issue
ever since it was announced by Kent State Presi
dent Glenn Olds. RSB supporters, calling the
move an attempt to "hack away at our education
and drive us out of school," began jeering the
board when it refused to place their demands to
rescind the hike at the head of the agenda.
When shouts continued, the board attempted to
move to another room, but was followed by the

group. And when police tried to prevent the stu
dents from entering the new room, the battle was
on.
One policeman, Robert Tilton, was pulled into
the crowd and struck on the face with a solid
object. Tilton was taken to a local hospital where
he was treated for cuts and bruises.
Four students were also injured in the scuffle,
as some students charged that police used night
sticks to quell the demonstration. One even
claimed that he was punched by a Kent State
trustee.
When all was said and done, it was bad news for
the pocketbooks of Kent Staters. The board, un
impressed by the RSB's protest, announced that
the tuition raises will be put into effect as
scheduled.
