How do I get information concerning Satan worship in the area?
I've tried virgin sacrifices, selling my soul and Latin chants, but no
cigar. I know the San Fruncisco Bay Area is one of the largest
centers of the world where the Devil is held in high esteem, and that
Black Masses are held. I am seriously interested in attending one.
Who or what do I contact?-P.E.
Your best bet is the Satanic Church in the City. Call 752-3583 or

What (he hell is the origin of the standard 81/2 x 11 inch sheet of
paper? It's always seemed kind of arbitrary to me, but I've obvi
ously never had any choice. Isn't this an infringement of my
rights?-B.K.P.
Paper size, like most systems of measurement, probably evolved
somehow from the length of people's arms, according to Hans Aris
at Zellerbach Paper Company. However, why the paper turned out
to be exactly that size is a mystery to him.
"God knows why!" Aris said. "It was a convenience deal. It's like
saying 'what'san inch?' There's noreal meaning to it whatsoever."
Strangely enough, paper manufacturers have not realized the
real Bicentennial possibilities in their product. Aris said that BV2 x
11 paper is a uniquely American measurement. In England paper is
BV4 x 11 5 /a inches. This is due to the size of the larger sheet from
which the four small pieces are cut.

We are savingaluminum cans to recycle into a baseball bat. Do you
know how many cans it takes to make a bat and where we can have
ihe operation performed?-P.S.
For a major league weight bat you'll need about 50 cans. However
you'll not get quite the same type of bat. Major league aluminum
bats have proven to be more economical, durable and long-lasting
than the traditional wooden models. Your bat, on the other hand,
will stand up for about one hit. After that it will be bent double.
The problem, according to Roy Webster at Kaiser Aluminum, is
that cans and bats are different aluminum alloys. Bat aluminum is a
7046 alloy, also used on the Moonrover, which is very high
strength. The 3000 series aluminum used ir. cans is much more
flimsy. Hitting a ball with a bat of that alloy would be like hitting it
with a string of Mountain Dew cans welded together.
Webster has a suggestion, however. The Kaiser aluminum can
center will pay 15 cents a pound for your aluminum cans. At 23
cents a pound, that means you will have to collect 1500 cans to raise
the $10 price of an aluminum bat.

than the traditional wooden models. Your bat, on the other hand,
will stand up for about one hit. After that it will be bent double.
The problem, according to Roy Webster at Kaiser Aluminum, is
that cans and bats are different aluminum alloys. Bat aluminum is a
7046 alloy, also used on the Moonrover, which is very high
strength. The 3000 series aluminum used ir. cans is much more
flimsy. Hitting a ball with a bat of that alloy would be like hitting it
with a string of Mountain Dew cans welded together.
Webster has a suggestion, however. The Kaiser aluminum can
center will pay 15 cents a pound for your aluminum cans. At 23
cents a pound, that means you will have to collect 1500 cans to raise
the $10 price of an aluminum bat.


How do I get information concerning Satan worship in the area?
I've tried virgin sacrifices, selling my soul and Latin chants, but no
cigar. I know the San Fruncisco Bay Area is one of the largest
centers of the world where the Devil is held in high esteem, and that
Black Masses are held. I am seriously interested in attending one.
Who or what do I contact?-P.E.
Your best bet is the Satanic Church in the City. Call 752-3583 or

What (he hell is the origin of the standard 81/2 x 11 inch sheet of
paper? It's always seemed kind of arbitrary to me, but I've obvi
ously never had any choice. Isn't this an infringement of my
rights?-B.K.P.
Paper size, like most systems of measurement, probably evolved
somehow from the length of people's arms, according to Hans Aris
at Zellerbach Paper Company. However, why the paper turned out
to be exactly that size is a mystery to him.
"God knows why!" Aris said. "It was a convenience deal. It's like
saying 'what'san inch?' There's noreal meaning to it whatsoever."
Strangely enough, paper manufacturers have not realized the
real Bicentennial possibilities in their product. Aris said that BV2 x
11 paper is a uniquely American measurement. In England paper is
BV4 x 11 5 /a inches. This is due to the size of the larger sheet from
which the four small pieces are cut.

We are savingaluminum cans to recycle into a baseball bat. Do you
know how many cans it takes to make a bat and where we can have
ihe operation performed?-P.S.
For a major league weight bat you'll need about 50 cans. However
you'll not get quite the same type of bat. Major league aluminum
bats have proven to be more economical, durable and long-lasting
than the traditional wooden models. Your bat, on the other hand,
will stand up for about one hit. After that it will be bent double.
