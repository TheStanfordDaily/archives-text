# Malpractice slowdown anguishes patients
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AF) — Pa
tients whose doctors have post
poned surgery because of the
malpractice slowdown are wait
ing, often in discomfort, fear or
confusion, for word that their
healing operation can finally be
done.
"No elective surgery." Behind
that phrase lie stories of dis
rupted lives, extra weeks of dis
abiliy, the scheduled leave from
a job now having to be canceled,
the anxiety about upcoming
surgery prolonged with no defi
nite day in sight.
A microcosm of the situation
can be found at the Otological
Medical Croup, where world
reknowned ear surgeons How
ard and William House and their
associates have canceled hun
dreds of operations scheduled
for January.
Many specialists in Southern
California, protesting an attempt
by Travelers' Insurance Cos. to
rise malpractice insurance rates
as much as 4Hfi percent for the
first quarter of 1976, are with
holding all but emergency ser
vices. Most elective surgery in
Los Angeles County has been
put off as a result.
The ear surgeons' 10-man
group paid a total of $10,000 in
liability insurance premiums
last year. Under the new rates,
tlu; figure would be $370,000 —
as Dr. Howard House points out,
$1000 a day.
Most of the group's operations
are performed at nearby St. Vin
cent's Hospital, where much of
the staff has also joined the pro
test.
After receiving letters telling
them their operations were can
celed indefinitely, a number of
patients had these comments:

"It's a miserable situation. I've
got a ringing in my ear so bad it
sounds like the water running,"
said Melvin Merritt, 58. He said
that if he doesn't get the opera
tion soon, he may have to quit
his $20,000 a year sales manager
job. He can't hear his employes.
"I haven't slept much," said
Sandy Schraber, who canceled
fer flight from Minneapolis
when she got the word. "It's the
mental anguish of knowing
you're going to have this opera
tion and then not being able to go
through with it." The uncer
tainty means she now can't plan
far enough ahead to gt an
advance-payment airline fare
discount.
The slowdown hit Wolfgang
Lotz hard when his wife's doctor
pushed his schedule ahead to
perform a hysterectomy on her
before 1975 ended, avoiding the
elective surgery slowdown that
began Jan. 1
The medical group's patients
come from all over the United
States and many foreign coun
tries. Dr. Howard House said his
office had to call some patients
in Europe as little as 24 hours
before they were scheduled.
