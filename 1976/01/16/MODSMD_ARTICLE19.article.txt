## Two new coaches meet at Pauley 
### CHRIS BAKER 
New UCLA coach Cene Bar
tow was walking around the
UCLA campus when a fan came
up to him to offer his congratula
tions on the Bruins' 88-70 win
over Notre Dame the night be
fore.
"Wouldn't it be nice to win the
NCAAs this year," said Bartow.
"Yes, and the next nine after that
too," replied the well-wisher.
That's the way it is when you try
to replace a legend.
But first-year Stanford coach
Dick Dißiaso's task is no more
enviable this weekend in Hol
ly weird. After dropping their
Pacific Light openers at home,
Dißiaso's Cards travel to Los
Angeles to take on eighth
ranked UCLA tonight and USC
Saturday night. Both contests
will be broadcast live on the
KZSIJ Sports Network (90.1 FM)
starting at 7:55 p.m.
This is the first time that Stan
ford has taken on UCLA im
mediately after a Bruin loss since
1 <1(33, when the Cards beat UCLA
back-to-back. As everyone
who has ever hated John
Wooden knows by now, Oregon
State handed the Bruins their

second loss of the year, 75-58,
last Saturday in Corvallis, Ore.
"Naturally,"said Bartow, "I'm
disappointed. Not so much that
we didn't win two games but
rather that we didn't play well.
For example, we didn't play like
we did in beating Notre Dame."
Or like UCLA did in beating
Denver 111-79.
'High-level intensity'
"In other words," continued
Bartow, "I think this team has to
play with high-level intensity
and shoot well to win."
Dißiaso said, "Despite their
loss to Oregon State, UCLA is
obviously one of the best
in the country. In Richard
Washington (21.5 scoring avg.)
and Marques Johnson (16.2avg.),
they might well have the best
forward combination in the
country." Johnson scored 18
points in Oregon last weekend as
the Bruins continuously gave
the ball to Washington.
"The Oregon games brought
out several areas of concern for
us," said Bartow. "We must de
velop our bench strength, have
our reserves play with more con
sistency and have Marques
Johnson more involved in our of

fense than he was in the Oregon
games.
"And Johnson has got to keep
out of foul trouble. Against Ore
gon State, he picked up three
early fouls and, as a result, he
played approximately eight mi
nutes in the entire first half. This
really hurt us, as he and Richard
Washington are our great
players and we need them for the
full 40 minutes against strong
teams like Oregon State.
And then, trying to say some
thing that wouldn't even make
the bulletin board of the Stan
ford dressing room, Bartow said,
"As I've been saying all along,
Stanford and Cal are fine basket
ball teams capable of beating
anyone on any given night."
There will be a very familiar
face on the USC bench in the

Sports Arena Saturday night.
Former Stanford assistant Bub
Bowling is now a Trojan assis
tant. But it won't be a nice reun
ion.
USC took an 11-1 record and a
seven-game winning streak to
Oregon last week. The Trojans
came home 0-2 in the Pac-8.
"Losing two on the road is not
a signal for us to dispair." said
USC coach Bob Boyd. "Of course
we're very disappointed, but it's
premature to give up now. We're
going back to work to try and get
in the league race again."
Evans hurting
USC may have to do it without
its third leading scorer, ft-focM-7
guard Earl Evans, who has al
ready missed three games.
Evans, who earlier suffered a
sprained ankle, strained his

Achilles tendon before the Ore
gon State game and played only
14 minutes with two points in
the HO-70 loss. Saturday night
against Oregon, Evans sat out
and IJSC played with only nine
players.
Boyd got another scare in the
Oregon game when USC leading
scorer Marv Safford, averaging
19.6 points a game at the other
guard spot, turned his left ankle
and had to come out for a minute
and a half. He returned to the
contest and is expected to be
back in the lineup for this
weekend.
Safford, assigned three differ
ent defenders by the Ducks,
scored 30 in the game. He scored
16 points against Oregon State,
despite sitting out 16 minutes in
foul trouble.
