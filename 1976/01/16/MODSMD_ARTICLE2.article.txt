# Panel suggests codes for high risk research labs
## 
### DAN FIDUCCIA 
The University Panel on Health and
Safety, investigating the laboratory
death of a physics student, has re
leased its report and has recom
mended the development of "safety
codes (for) individual laboratories"
and first aid training for personnel in
high risk research areas.
The panel's report is the second in
vestigation stemming from the elec
trocution of third-yearapplied physics
graduate student Charles Hawley on
Oct. 26. Hawley died after coming in
contact with a partially-charged
5000-volt capacitor during an experi

ment researching the application of
high voltage electric discharges to
supersonic gas flows.
The panel, which accepted and ag
reed with the content of the report of
the High Temperature Gasdynamics
Laboratory's (HTGL) Accident Com
mittee, offered three recommenda
tions to Vice Provost for Research Wil
liam Massy:
Recommendations
—that "the review of laboratory
safety codes . . . currently being car
ried out by the HTL's safety committee
should be conducted with dispatch";
—that if HTGL's specific codes

"have useful application in other areas
within the University" . . . then "the
University's Safety and Health Divi
sion (should) assist . . . laboratories
and departments in implementing
such policies and codes" since "this
local implementation of practical and
useful safety codes by individual
laboratories will be more effective than
a blanket University policy or code,
which would be both difficult to write
and extremely difficult to enforce in a
meaningful way":
—and that an ad hoc committee be
established "to determine those types
of research being conducted within
the University that are of particularly
high risk in terms of life threatening
accidents. Consideration should then
be given to providing person
nel . . . working in those areas with
first aid training ..."
Massy 'generally' agrees
Massy said yesterday,"I generally
agree with the report and the spirit of
the report. However, I think there
might be a more expeditious way of
implementing the third recommenda
tion.
"We're looking into a training prog
ram which would tap the information
of the Safety Panel and the Fire De
partment instead of creating an ad hoc
committee. If that's not feasible then
we'll try the committee."
Massy said he hopes to meet within
the next two weeks with members of
the panel to begin implementing the
recommendations.
"The first aid training program will
be started first, which is mainly a mat
ter of pinpointing and increasing pre
sent programs. The codes, however
will take awhile."
Even though the codes will take
some time to implement throughout
the University, Massy has set the end
of this quarter as his goal for making
the codes operational.

accidents. Consideration should then
be given to providing person
nel . . . working in those areas with
first aid training ..."
Massy 'generally' agrees
Massy said yesterday,"I generally
agree with the report and the spirit of
the report. However, I think there
might be a more expeditious way of
implementing the third recommenda
tion.
"We're looking into a training prog
ram which would tap the information
of the Safety Panel and the Fire De
partment instead of creating an ad hoc
committee. If that's not feasible then
we'll try the committee."
Massy said he hopes to meet within
the next two weeks with members of
the panel to begin implementing the
recommendations.
"The first aid training program will
be started first, which is mainly a mat
ter of pinpointing and increasing pre
sent programs. The codes, however
will take awhile."
Even though the codes will take
some time to implement throughout
the University, Massy has set the end
of this quarter as his goal for making
the codes operational.

The University Panel on Health and
Safety, investigating the laboratory
death of a physics student, has re
leased its report and has recom
mended the development of "safety
codes (for) individual laboratories"
and first aid training for personnel in
high risk research areas.
The panel's report is the second in
vestigation stemming from the elec
trocution of third-yearapplied physics
graduate student Charles Hawley on
Oct. 26. Hawley died after coming in
contact with a partially-charged
5000-volt capacitor during an experi

ment researching the application of
high voltage electric discharges to
supersonic gas flows.
The panel, which accepted and ag
reed with the content of the report of
the High Temperature Gasdynamics
Laboratory's (HTGL) Accident Com
mittee, offered three recommenda
tions to Vice Provost for Research Wil
liam Massy:
Recommendations
—that "the review of laboratory
safety codes . . . currently being car
ried out by the HTL's safety committee
should be conducted with dispatch";
—that if HTGL's specific codes

"have useful application in other areas
within the University" . . . then "the
University's Safety and Health Divi
sion (should) assist . . . laboratories
and departments in implementing
such policies and codes" since "this
local implementation of practical and
useful safety codes by individual
laboratories will be more effective than
a blanket University policy or code,
which would be both difficult to write
and extremely difficult to enforce in a
meaningful way":
—and that an ad hoc committee be
established "to determine those types
of research being conducted within
the University that are of particularly
high risk in terms of life threatening
accidents. Consideration should then
be given to providing person
nel . . . working in those areas with
first aid training ..."
