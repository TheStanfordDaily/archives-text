# Pan-Am Games not what tennis medalists expected
## 
### JEFF TANJI 
"I looked forward to playing
in the Pan-American Games
thinking it would be a lot of good
competition and a great time in a
foreign country; it turned out
that a large part of the time was
pure torture," revealed Butch
Walts Wednesday night at the
annual Northern California
Tennis Patrons Awards Banquet
before a capacity crowd in the
Tresidder Main Lounge.
As a culmination to the dinner
and awards presentation, tennis
players Lele Forood, Stanford's
sophomore sensation;} lank Pfis
ter, San Jose State's number one
man;and Butch Walts, star of the
lISC squad, discussed their ex
periences in the 1975 Pan-
American Games held in Mexico
City a few months ago. Despite a
hostile and sometimes violent
crowd, blatantly unfair officiat
ing and formidable opponents,
the three helped an American
team sweep the tennis competi
tion at the games.
The entire experience proved
to be something quite unex
pected as the three spoke of the

overwhelming feeling of hate
that was projected to the Ameri
can squad by the spectators.
"There were things that never
appeared in the papers that
showed the blatant hostility felt
toward the American team,"
said Walts. "During the race
walking competition an Ameri
can walker was leading and as he
walked through a street which
was part of the course, people
threw stones and things at him
so that he lost his position. It
turned out that Mexicans
finished one and two in the
end."
Another 'omission'
Another incident that appa
rently did not appear in the Mex
ican papers dealt with the as
sault of an American bicyclist.
Walts said, "Each day the bicyc
lists would ride around in the
hills for practice — 1 guess a
hundred miles or so. Well, one of
our guys went to the hills alone
one day and ran into a bunch of
people that threw things at him
and caused an accident with his
bicycle crashing down on some
rocks. When we saw him the

next day he was on crutches, not
even able to walk, much less
compete."
The atrocities were not con
fined to places off the field, how
ever. "There were strange calls
throughout the tennis matches,"
related Forood. "If 1 saw that i
received a bad call, I would turn
to the official only to find that he
only spoke Spanish and would
not understand a word I said.
And even if he did understand, it
wasn't likely that he would
change his decision."
Wide representation
South and Central American
countries as well as the United
States and Canada participated
in the competition. Due to the
nature of the large majority of
Spanish speaking peoples, the
Americans found themselves
whistled at in every event.
"The heckling was bad not
only for us but for all of the
American athletes," revealed
Walts. "A bunch of us. tennis
players and swimmers, went to
the basketball game to cheer for
our team. Feeling like someone
oughllo do something inspiring,
one guy took a towel and wrote
the initials 'USA' on it and
waved it when we were intro
ducced. Well, after that people
threw a barrage of things at us
and every where I looked I saw
angry fees staring up at us, al
most as if they wanted to kill us.
There were only twenty of us
and there were 17,000 of them.
The police decided to surround
us and escort us out."

"There were things that never
appeared in the papers that
showed the blatant hostility felt
toward the American team,"
said Walts. "During the race
walking competition an Ameri
can walker was leading and as he
walked through a street which
was part of the course, people
threw stones and things at him
so that he lost his position. It
turned out that Mexicans
finished one and two in the
end."
Another 'omission'
Another incident that appa
rently did not appear in the Mex
ican papers dealt with the as
sault of an American bicyclist.
Walts said, "Each day the bicyc
lists would ride around in the
hills for practice — 1 guess a
hundred miles or so. Well, one of
our guys went to the hills alone
one day and ran into a bunch of
people that threw things at him
and caused an accident with his
bicycle crashing down on some
rocks. When we saw him the

next day he was on crutches, not
even able to walk, much less
compete."
The atrocities were not con
fined to places off the field, how
ever. "There were strange calls
throughout the tennis matches,"
related Forood. "If 1 saw that i
received a bad call, I would turn
to the official only to find that he
only spoke Spanish and would
not understand a word I said.
And even if he did understand, it
wasn't likely that he would
change his decision."
Wide representation
South and Central American
countries as well as the United
States and Canada participated
in the competition. Due to the
nature of the large majority of
Spanish speaking peoples, the
Americans found themselves
whistled at in every event.
"The heckling was bad not
only for us but for all of the
American athletes," revealed
Walts. "A bunch of us. tennis
players and swimmers, went to
the basketball game to cheer for
our team. Feeling like someone
oughllo do something inspiring,
one guy took a towel and wrote
the initials 'USA' on it and
waved it when we were intro
ducced. Well, after that people
threw a barrage of things at us
and every where I looked I saw
angry fees staring up at us, al
most as if they wanted to kill us.
There were only twenty of us
and there were 17,000 of them.
The police decided to surround
us and escort us out."

AWARDS DINNER—LeIe Forood, Stanford's top-ranked women's
tennis player and a gold-medalist at the 1975 Pan-American
Games, spoke at the Midpeninsula Tennis Patrons Awards
Dinner at Tresidder Union Wednesday night. The Patrons' presi
dent, George McKee, is at the left.
"I looked forward to playing
in the Pan-American Games
thinking it would be a lot of good
competition and a great time in a
foreign country; it turned out
that a large part of the time was
pure torture," revealed Butch
Walts Wednesday night at the
annual Northern California
Tennis Patrons Awards Banquet
before a capacity crowd in the
Tresidder Main Lounge.
As a culmination to the dinner
and awards presentation, tennis
players Lele Forood, Stanford's
sophomore sensation;} lank Pfis
ter, San Jose State's number one
man;and Butch Walts, star of the
lISC squad, discussed their ex
periences in the 1975 Pan-
American Games held in Mexico
City a few months ago. Despite a
hostile and sometimes violent
crowd, blatantly unfair officiat
ing and formidable opponents,
the three helped an American
team sweep the tennis competi
tion at the games.
The entire experience proved
to be something quite unex
pected as the three spoke of the

overwhelming feeling of hate
that was projected to the Ameri
can squad by the spectators.
"There were things that never
appeared in the papers that
showed the blatant hostility felt
toward the American team,"
said Walts. "During the race
