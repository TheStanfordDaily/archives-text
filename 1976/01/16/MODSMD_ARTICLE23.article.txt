# Wolfe a howling success
## Freshman Perry terrorizes opponents 
### GARY SPRAGUE 
Wolfe Perry is tough to miss. He's the only
guy in the University who still has Santa
Claus Christmas paper on his door. He's
even easier to spot on the basketball court.
He's the guy who keeps putting in amazing
jump shots from seemingly impossible ang
les.
Perry's on-court flamboyance, however,
is countered by a personal equanimity
which belies his nickname of "Wolfman."
Soft spoken with an easy, inviting smile,
Perry resembles a trancedentalist con
templating the sublimities of life. His
philosophy, as he expresses it, is simple. "I
love to enjoy life. 1 love to laugh. I don't like
to take things too seriously because you lose
a lot out of life if you do."
Perry,a6-foot-2,178-pound freshman out
of Oakland Tech High School, was one of
the most sought-after guards on the coast.
All the Pacific Eight teams and most of the
other schools in the West recruited him.
Perry, with typical good-natured candor,
admitted the attention was enjoyable.
The recruiting "was fun," he said. "It was
a nice three months. They flew me all over
California and most of the West. But I soon
got tired of that and decided to make up my
mind. I got tired of seeing a lot of hotel
rooms by myself in strange towns."
Dißiaso the key
The efforts of Stanford coach Dick Di-
Biaso were the key to landing the Scholastic
Coaches' Ail-American. Dißiaso em
phasized that Stanford's program was tak
ing a new, fresh approach to basketball, and
that it would be an easy program to get into
quickly. When compared to Cal, Perry's
second choice and a program he labelled
"just your basic program," the vitality of
Stanford and its new coach was decisive.
Perry was expected to make an immediate
impact on Stanford basketball, and he has
done just that. During the preseason games,
he was the Cards' sixth man, averaging over
twenty minutes of playing time a game. He
was still an unknown to most Cardinal root
ers, however, due mainly to his dismal .333
shooting percentage. That all changed in
the Washington State game last Friday.
Coming off the bench in the second half,
Berry sparked the Cards in their run at the
Cougars with four straight baskets. The
Cards fell short of the Cougars by two
points, but Perry's five-for-six night, flashy
style and hustling play won for him the
admiration of the 5500 spectators.
Popular move
The announcement that Perry would start
the Washington game Saturday brought a
roar of approval and ■anticipation from the
fans. They were not disappointed. Perry ac
counted for eight of the team's first 13
points and contributed to the tight defense
that limited the Huskies to a mere 26 points
in the first half.
The decision to start Perry came as a sur
prise to Wolfe as well as the spectators. "(Di-
Biaso) told me about five minutes before we

were supposed to go out onto the court. I
was surprised."
Surprised or not, Perry had no doubts he
could fill a starting role. "I've always been
confident in my shot and my offensive abil
ity," he said. "These last two games have
boosted my confidence, though. It's always
good to see your shots go in. I'm playing
good ball now. I'm pleased with it. But I still
see lots of room for improvement."
One of those areas for improvement is his
ballhandling. Although he averaged over
three turnovers a game in the pre-season.
Perry committed only two in the two games
of last weekend. "Dißiaso has been helping
me with ballhandling," Perry explained.
"Dißiaso said I was too nervous. So in prac
tice I've been working against good players
like (fay) Carter and (Mike) Bratz to improve
my ballhandling."
Shooting suffered
That freshman nervousness was also
largely responsible for Perry's poor shoot
ing earlier in the season. The low percen
tage "was due to tightness," he said. "I'd
loosen up as the game went on. Now I feel
very relaxed, due mainly to th'e experience
of being out there on the court."
Perry was basically a one-on-one player
in high school. Although college basketball
is much more structured than high school,

Perry is still occasionally given the green
light. "If the opportunity is there," he says,
"coach Dißiaso will let you go one-on-one."
Despite Stanford's 4-8 record, Perry feels
that the Cardinals can play with the best
teams. "I think we have a good enough team
to beat just about anyone. We looked good
against several ranked teams, and we've
only really been beaten once."
Cards erratic
The problem seems to be one of inconsis
tency.
"We have lapses of 4-5 minutes in each
game. That's what happened at the begin
ning of the second half in the Washington
game — a complete lapse," Perry said.
The reasons for these emotional and
psychological breakdowns are unknown.
"To me it's a real mystery," Perry shrugs.
"We just have to work on it."
Both on the court and off, Perry has his
own inimitable style. Going one-on-one, he
leans one way, goes the other, loses the de
fender with a head and shoulder fake, and
puts in fall-away 15-footers that need radar
to find the hoop. In the dorm, he leaves his
stereo playing when he leaves, so he won't
miss a single note when he returns. Perry
isn't missing much on the court these days,
either.

the Washington State game last Friday.
Coming off the bench in the second half,
Berry sparked the Cards in their run at the
Cougars with four straight baskets. The
Cards fell short of the Cougars by two
points, but Perry's five-for-six night, flashy
style and hustling play won for him the
admiration of the 5500 spectators.
Popular move
The announcement that Perry would start
the Washington game Saturday brought a
roar of approval and ■anticipation from the
fans. They were not disappointed. Perry ac
counted for eight of the team's first 13
points and contributed to the tight defense
that limited the Huskies to a mere 26 points
in the first half.
The decision to start Perry came as a sur
prise to Wolfe as well as the spectators. "(Di-
Biaso) told me about five minutes before we

were supposed to go out onto the court. I
was surprised."
Surprised or not, Perry had no doubts he
could fill a starting role. "I've always been
confident in my shot and my offensive abil
ity," he said. "These last two games have
boosted my confidence, though. It's always
good to see your shots go in. I'm playing
good ball now. I'm pleased with it. But I still
see lots of room for improvement."
One of those areas for improvement is his
ballhandling. Although he averaged over
three turnovers a game in the pre-season.
Perry committed only two in the two games
of last weekend. "Dißiaso has been helping
me with ballhandling," Perry explained.
"Dißiaso said I was too nervous. So in prac
tice I've been working against good players
like (fay) Carter and (Mike) Bratz to improve
my ballhandling."
Shooting suffered
That freshman nervousness was also
largely responsible for Perry's poor shoot
ing earlier in the season. The low percen
tage "was due to tightness," he said. "I'd
loosen up as the game went on. Now I feel
very relaxed, due mainly to th'e experience
of being out there on the court."
Perry was basically a one-on-one player
in high school. Although college basketball
is much more structured than high school,

Perry is still occasionally given the green
light. "If the opportunity is there," he says,
"coach Dißiaso will let you go one-on-one."
Despite Stanford's 4-8 record, Perry feels
that the Cardinals can play with the best
teams. "I think we have a good enough team
to beat just about anyone. We looked good
against several ranked teams, and we've
only really been beaten once."
Cards erratic
The problem seems to be one of inconsis
tency.
"We have lapses of 4-5 minutes in each
game. That's what happened at the begin
ning of the second half in the Washington
game — a complete lapse," Perry said.
The reasons for these emotional and
psychological breakdowns are unknown.
"To me it's a real mystery," Perry shrugs.
"We just have to work on it."
Both on the court and off, Perry has his
own inimitable style. Going one-on-one, he
leans one way, goes the other, loses the de
fender with a head and shoulder fake, and
puts in fall-away 15-footers that need radar
to find the hoop. In the dorm, he leaves his
stereo playing when he leaves, so he won't
miss a single note when he returns. Perry
isn't missing much on the court these days,
either.

Cardinal Saturday against Washington
and will again be in the starting lineup
tonight against UCLA.
Wolfe Perry is tough to miss. He's the only
guy in the University who still has Santa
Claus Christmas paper on his door. He's
even easier to spot on the basketball court.
He's the guy who keeps putting in amazing
jump shots from seemingly impossible ang
les.
Perry's on-court flamboyance, however,
is countered by a personal equanimity
which belies his nickname of "Wolfman."
Soft spoken with an easy, inviting smile,
Perry resembles a trancedentalist con
templating the sublimities of life. His
philosophy, as he expresses it, is simple. "I
love to enjoy life. 1 love to laugh. I don't like
to take things too seriously because you lose
a lot out of life if you do."
Perry,a6-foot-2,178-pound freshman out
of Oakland Tech High School, was one of
the most sought-after guards on the coast.
All the Pacific Eight teams and most of the
other schools in the West recruited him.
Perry, with typical good-natured candor,
admitted the attention was enjoyable.
The recruiting "was fun," he said. "It was
a nice three months. They flew me all over
California and most of the West. But I soon
got tired of that and decided to make up my
mind. I got tired of seeing a lot of hotel
rooms by myself in strange towns."
Dißiaso the key
The efforts of Stanford coach Dick Di-
Biaso were the key to landing the Scholastic
Coaches' Ail-American. Dißiaso em
phasized that Stanford's program was tak
ing a new, fresh approach to basketball, and
that it would be an easy program to get into
quickly. When compared to Cal, Perry's
second choice and a program he labelled
"just your basic program," the vitality of
Stanford and its new coach was decisive.
Perry was expected to make an immediate
impact on Stanford basketball, and he has
done just that. During the preseason games,
he was the Cards' sixth man, averaging over
twenty minutes of playing time a game. He
was still an unknown to most Cardinal root
ers, however, due mainly to his dismal .333
shooting percentage. That all changed in
the Washington State game last Friday.
Coming off the bench in the second half,

Perry is still occasionally given the green
light. "If the opportunity is there," he says,
"coach Dißiaso will let you go one-on-one."
Despite Stanford's 4-8 record, Perry feels
that the Cardinals can play with the best
teams. "I think we have a good enough team
to beat just about anyone. We looked good
against several ranked teams, and we've
only really been beaten once."
Cards erratic
The problem seems to be one of inconsis
tency.
"We have lapses of 4-5 minutes in each
game. That's what happened at the begin
ning of the second half in the Washington
game — a complete lapse," Perry said.
The reasons for these emotional and
psychological breakdowns are unknown.
"To me it's a real mystery," Perry shrugs.
"We just have to work on it."
Both on the court and off, Perry has his
own inimitable style. Going one-on-one, he
leans one way, goes the other, loses the de
fender with a head and shoulder fake, and
puts in fall-away 15-footers that need radar
to find the hoop. In the dorm, he leaves his
stereo playing when he leaves, so he won't
miss a single note when he returns. Perry
isn't missing much on the court these days,
either.

Cardinal Saturday against Washington
and will again be in the starting lineup
tonight against UCLA.
Wolfe Perry is tough to miss. He's the only
guy in the University who still has Santa
Claus Christmas paper on his door. He's
even easier to spot on the basketball court.
He's the guy who keeps putting in amazing
jump shots from seemingly impossible ang
les.
Perry's on-court flamboyance, however,
is countered by a personal equanimity
which belies his nickname of "Wolfman."
Soft spoken with an easy, inviting smile,
Perry resembles a trancedentalist con
templating the sublimities of life. His
philosophy, as he expresses it, is simple. "I
love to enjoy life. 1 love to laugh. I don't like
to take things too seriously because you lose
a lot out of life if you do."
Perry,a6-foot-2,178-pound freshman out
of Oakland Tech High School, was one of
the most sought-after guards on the coast.
All the Pacific Eight teams and most of the
other schools in the West recruited him.
Perry, with typical good-natured candor,
admitted the attention was enjoyable.
The recruiting "was fun," he said. "It was
a nice three months. They flew me all over
California and most of the West. But I soon
got tired of that and decided to make up my
mind. I got tired of seeing a lot of hotel
rooms by myself in strange towns."
Dißiaso the key
The efforts of Stanford coach Dick Di-
Biaso were the key to landing the Scholastic
Coaches' Ail-American. Dißiaso em
phasized that Stanford's program was tak
ing a new, fresh approach to basketball, and
that it would be an easy program to get into
quickly. When compared to Cal, Perry's
second choice and a program he labelled
"just your basic program," the vitality of
Stanford and its new coach was decisive.
Perry was expected to make an immediate
impact on Stanford basketball, and he has
done just that. During the preseason games,
he was the Cards' sixth man, averaging over
twenty minutes of playing time a game. He
was still an unknown to most Cardinal root
ers, however, due mainly to his dismal .333
shooting percentage. That all changed in
the Washington State game last Friday.
Coming off the bench in the second half,
Berry sparked the Cards in their run at the
Cougars with four straight baskets. The
Cards fell short of the Cougars by two
points, but Perry's five-for-six night, flashy
style and hustling play won for him the
admiration of the 5500 spectators.
Popular move
The announcement that Perry would start
the Washington game Saturday brought a
roar of approval and ■anticipation from the
fans. They were not disappointed. Perry ac
counted for eight of the team's first 13
points and contributed to the tight defense
that limited the Huskies to a mere 26 points
in the first half.
The decision to start Perry came as a sur
prise to Wolfe as well as the spectators. "(Di-
Biaso) told me about five minutes before we

were supposed to go out onto the court. I
was surprised."
Surprised or not, Perry had no doubts he
could fill a starting role. "I've always been
confident in my shot and my offensive abil
ity," he said. "These last two games have
boosted my confidence, though. It's always
good to see your shots go in. I'm playing
good ball now. I'm pleased with it. But I still
see lots of room for improvement."
One of those areas for improvement is his
ballhandling. Although he averaged over
three turnovers a game in the pre-season.
Perry committed only two in the two games
of last weekend. "Dißiaso has been helping
me with ballhandling," Perry explained.
"Dißiaso said I was too nervous. So in prac
tice I've been working against good players
like (fay) Carter and (Mike) Bratz to improve
my ballhandling."
Shooting suffered
That freshman nervousness was also
largely responsible for Perry's poor shoot
ing earlier in the season. The low percen
tage "was due to tightness," he said. "I'd
loosen up as the game went on. Now I feel
very relaxed, due mainly to th'e experience
of being out there on the court."
Perry was basically a one-on-one player
in high school. Although college basketball
is much more structured than high school,

Perry is still occasionally given the green
light. "If the opportunity is there," he says,
