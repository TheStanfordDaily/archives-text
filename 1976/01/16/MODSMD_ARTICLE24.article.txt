# Pac-8 predictions
## 
### 
Last week, our prognosticator correctly
picked the winner in two of six Pac-8 games
... nothing like getting off to a good start. At
least now there's nowhere to go but up. Or is
there?
The easiest games to predict this week are
Cal-USC, Oregon-Washington and Oregon
State-Washington State. That's because they
were all played last night.
So, resigned to the harsh necessity of pre
dicting future results, let's begin. Stanford will
make a run at UCLA tonight, but the Bruins
haven't lost in Pauley Pavilion since Cro-
Magnon man roamed the earth. UCLA will
surrender its Pauley string (91 straight wins
since a loss to USC in 1970) sometime this
season, but neither the Cards nor Cat will put
an end to it all this weekend. The Cards are

going to surprise some Pac-8 teams this year
though, and USC may provide their first win
Saturday.
The best matchup of the weekend pits Ore
gon State against Washington in Seattle. The
Huskies will justify, and maybe improve, their
number six national ranking.
Washington State is an improved team
which plays Oregon at home, but the Ducks
simply have more talent. Admittedly, that's no
reason to pick a winner in the Pac-8, but it's as
good as anything else.
