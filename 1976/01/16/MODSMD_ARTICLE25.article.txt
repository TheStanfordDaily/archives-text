# Swimmers host Shaw, Long Beach
## 
### CHRIS KAMEL 
The first double dual meet of
the season pits Stanford's men's
swimming team against Long
Beach State and University of
Utah Saturday. Make that
against Tim Shaw and Jeffßolan.
You see, although both Long
Beach and Utah are rated to
finish high in the NCAAs, it is
mainly due to the performance
of their respective super swim
mers.
Shaw will be making his first
appearance in Stanford's de-
Guerre Pool Complex tomorrow
at the 1 p.m. meet. The former
Sports Illustrated cover-boy is
known for his recent world re
cords in the 400- and 1500-yard
free, and according to Swim
ming World magazine, is "pos
sibly worth enough points to get
Long Beach into the top ten at
the NCAA." Sophomore frees
tyler Bill Chao represents the
Cadinal hopes to neutralize
Shaw. Last weekend Chao
finished the 500-yard free in a
lifetime best of 4:40.6 against
Texas and then duplicated the
mark the next day against the
Canadian National team.
The Cards, who host the Stan
ford Relays today at 2 p.m., will
also have their hands full from a
Utah squad which finished 13th
nationally last year and which
boasts butterflier Rolan. Rolan
took the NCAA championship in
the 100-yard fly last year while
scoring in the 50- and 100-yard
free as well.
