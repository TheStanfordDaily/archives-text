Moore gets life in prison
SAN FRANCISCO — Sara Jane Moore was sen
tenced to life in prison yesterday by a federal judge
who said if her gun had been a better one she would
have succeeded in shooting President Ford.
U.S. District Court Judge Samuel Conti told
Moore she was "misguided, blaming society for
your own faults," and declared: "You take it upon
yourself to be judge, jury and executioner."
Conti said Moore, the 45-year-old onetime FBI
informant with a history of mental illness, had "no
remorse," and imposed the maximum sentence.
She became the second woman within a month to
be sentenced to life in prison for attempting to kill
Ford.
Before the sentencing, Moore read a statement
detailing her political beliefs and what she said led
her to fire a shot at the President on Sept. 22.
She said she was not sorry for trying to shoot the
President, except that she "accomplished little
than to throw away the rest of my life ... I tried
because it expressed my feelings at the time and
could have triggered the kind of chaos to bring the
upheaval of needed change."

MPLA gains in Angola
JOUANNESBURGH — Soviet-backed forces, led
by Cuban troops, have scored major military vic
tories against their Western-backed foes in north
ern Angola, reports reaching South Africa said yes
terday.

There were fears the successes by the Popular
Movement (MPLA) would touch off direct inter
vention in the north by neighboring Zaire.
In Washington, high State Department officials
said the National Front for the Liberation of Angola
(FNLA) was rapidly losing ground in the north and
its units were nearing collapse.
The officials said the United States informed the
North Atlantic Council in Brussels of the deteriora
tion within the FNLA forces.
The FNLA and its ally, the National Union for the
Total Liberation Union for the Total Liberation of
Angola (UNITA), both backed by the United States
and South Africa, are fighting the MPLA for control
of the former Portuguese colony, which gained its
independence last November.
About 7000 Cubans are known to be leading the
MPLA fight.
Fighting increases in Beirut
BEIRUT — Fighting in Beirut and a score of other
points across Lebanon took at least 87 lives yester
day, bringing new calls for outside mediation to
end the nine-month-old civil war between Moslem
and Christian factions.
At least 58 were reported wounded during the
day. The over-all casualty toll since April stood at
more than 8800 dead and 26,700 wounded by offi
cial count.
Police said Christian gunmen kidnaped and
murdered two Moslem soldies at the mountain re
sort of Baalbeck. Moslems reacted by kidnaping six
Christian civilians, all believed murdered, police
said.
Police also reported that leftist gunmen and
Palestinian guerrillas staged a mortar and rocket
propelled grenade attack on a Lebanese army post
at the citadel of Tripoli, in northern Lebanon, and
captured it.
An unspecified number of attackers and defen
ders were killed and wounded in the assault, they
said.
Chico students arrested
CHICO — Two Cal State-Chico students were
arrested yesterday during the on-going sit-in at the
school, bringing the total number of arrests so far to
five.

Earlier this week, three students were arresting
for disturbing the peace. Julie Savage and Richard
Cabot, both 21, were arrested yesterday for interfer
ing with an officer doing his duty.
The two were arrested after a brief scuffle bet
ween the two students and a security officer when
he tried to take down a strike bulletin board in the
adfministration building, officials said.
Ed Masterson, a school spokesman, said the sit
in, which started Dec. 3, has dwindled to about
seven or eight persons. Earlier, he said, there were
as many as 75 persons involved.
The protest started over a statewide decision that
campus security guards wear guns on campus.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with sunny days and
patchy morning fog. Mild afternoon temperatures
and cool nights. Lows in the 30s. Highs in the 60s
and low 70s. Light winds.
