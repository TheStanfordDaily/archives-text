# USE members protest alleged 'union-busting'
## 
### ALEXANDER LEFF 
Approximately 75 members of the
United Stanford Employees (USE)
union held a demonstration outside
Encina Hall yesterday in protest of al
leged "union-busting" action by the
I Iniversity.
The union-University dispute,
which has led to recent USE protests,
was originally prompted by the layoff
of machinist William Reynolds from
his position at Hansen Laboratories.
USE spokesman Roger Hardy con
tended that "the University was out to
get Reynolds because he was a union
activist." He said all employes who
took part were "risking their jobs."
Hardy claimed that 30 USE
employes had received "intimidating"
letters from their managers indicating
that demonstrations violate the no
strike clause in their contracts. Hardy
said Douglas Barton, staff legal coun
sel for the University, is behind the

letter-writing campaign.
Barton was unavailable for comment
yesterday, but has previously claimed
that the contract specifically rules out
picketing and disagree with the
USE's description of the recant actions
as "demonstrations."
Recent labor difficulties have arisen
some nine months prior to the expira
tion of contracts for USE employes.
Hardy said, "Barton is just testing
us ... he is conducting introductory
warfare — giving us a taste of what
contract negotiations may be like."
USE President Jim Berk indicated on
campus radio station KZSU Tuesday
night that the union would probably
not appeal Reynolds' lay-off to an arbi
ter outside the University because
USE expected Reynolds to be hired in
another capacity by Stanford.
Reynolds is an assistant USE presi
dent who has been active in organizing
for the union.
