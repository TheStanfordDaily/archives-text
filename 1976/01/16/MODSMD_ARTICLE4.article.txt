# New foundation grant raises hopes for library addition
## 
### PERRY SIMON 
Hopes for a proposed addition to the Main Library be
came more concrete early this week with the announce
ment of a second $1 million grant from the James Irvine
Foundation of San Francisco.
The Irvine Foundation's additional contribution brings
the fund-raising drive total to $7.3 million. The entire
project is budgeted at $20 million.
In announcing this latest grant, President Richard
Lyman said, "These actions by the Irvine Foundation will
be immensely helpful in making possible the realization
of Stanford's greatest current building need."
The library project includes renovation of the Main
Library as well as construction of a new 180,000 square
foot structure at the east end of the existing building.
More library space
Upon completion, the new complex will more than
double Stanford's present main research library space,
and will provide expanded reading and study areas tor
students and faculty.
Dave Fulton, communications director in the General
Secretary's Office, is one of many Stanford fund raisers
involved in this project.

The library project is part of the general 'Campaign for
Stanford' drive, and we have access to those general (un
designated) funds," he said.
"However, we are first seeking iunds that are desig
nated for the library," Fulton added.
He explained, "The 'Campaign for Stanford' has volun
teers who ask prospective donors for a gift, and we try to
find fund-raising projects compatible with the donor's
interests in determining where the money will be allo
cated." The library is one such project.
Increasingly difficult
As the library drive approached the half-way mark, Ful
ton conceded that finding additional funds may grow
increasingly more difficult. "We naturally tap our best
sources at the outset, but we are always hopeful of a
snowballing effect," he said.
Construction is scheduled to start in early 1977. Fulton
said he is confident that fund-raising efforts will be suffi
cient to meet that target date.
An additional reason for optimism is a $5 million
pledge from an anonymous donor to match gifts from
individuals who contribute $100,000 or more.
An $8 million donation is required for the privilege of
having the new complex named after the donor.
