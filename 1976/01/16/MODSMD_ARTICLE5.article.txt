# Campus politicos debate COP aims
## 
### ROSARIO DELATORRE 
ASSI) President Lee Rosenbaum says
the aim of his Council of Presidents (COP)
during its first nine months in office has
been to lobby on behalf of students.
"We should act as a facilitator for stu
dents who want to organize student ser
vices and help students cut the administ
ration's red tape," Rosenbaum says.
Not all student politicos agree with
Rosenbaum's interpretation of his office's
duties, and some denigrate the COP's ef
fectiveness in even accomplishing what it
has set out to do.
ASSU Sen. Hob Ottilie, the COP's
foremost critic within student govern
ment. says the group has set the wrong
goals for its efforts.
ineffective'
"Rosenbaum's slate is ineffective in
providing any student services, which
should be the priority of the COP," Ottilie
says.
COP members counter Ottilie's criti
cism by saying they have more important
concerns than new student services.
Ottilie calls programs such as SYVOPSI.
SCIRE and the Action Research Liaison
Office (ARLO) pet projects of the COP
which are fine but do not benefit the
majority of students. "They (COP mem
bers) are pushing a lot of good things, but
they're for the minority of students," Ot
tilie contends.
"Students don't come to Stanford for its

student services. They come here for its
flexibility and its programs which allow
for student initiative. Programs such as
SWOPSI and SCIRE are more important
Lecture Note Service," Vice President
Charlotte Germane says.
The COP members claim it is easier for
students to set up student services on their
own. with help from the COP if the stu
dents want it. Germane cites examples

such as the hiring of a new gynecologist at
Cowell and the establishment of the shut
tle bus service.
'Students worked together'
"In those cases, students worked to
gether, directly with the University to es
tablish those services," she says.
"We have established some services we
felt were needed, such as peer advising to
help students make decisions concerning
their classes and the Off-Campus Student
Living Guide to help students who live
off-campus," Germane adds.
Their first priority is to get students in
volved in the Universities decision
making process, the COP members agree.
"We've tried to get more students in
volved through programs like the Com
munication Committee where we can have
a direct exchange of information with stu
dents," vice president Josie Jaramillo says.
More productive
Rosenbaum adds that the COP's goal is
not only to get more students interested in
committees, but no make those already in
terested more productive.
"We organized a committee orientation
program last spring for students interested
in being on committies." he says.
Ottilie accuses the COP. particularly
Galligan, of having made political ap
pointments to committees. "The decisions
on committee members were already
made when students were being asked
questions by the nominations committee,

chaired by Galligan," he contends.
Ottilie said he feels that a set of objective
criteria should be established and nomina
tions should be based on these criteria, not
any political considerations. Sex or ethnic
background may be a qualification, but it
should not take precedence, Ottilie feels.
The COP denies that any "political" ap
pointments were made, but concedes that
it did make a mistake when it failed to

publicize that students were being
selected for a committee to choose the new
dean of undergraduate studies.
"We were told by (Provost) William Mil
ler that he wanted only students who had
previously been on committees to be on
the selection committee." Rosenbaum re
calls.
Students qualified
"We asked students who we felt were
qualified and made recommendations
from them to the (ASSU) Senate for ap
proval," he continues.
"The senate was then free to accept or
reject the nominations," Rosenbaum con
cludes.
Germane admits that the COP has been
slower in accomplishing its goals than it
had hoped'.'Thingsgo very slowly and take
a long time to get done. We never said we
would get everything done," she notes.
Rosenbaum says the COP has estab
lished the groundwork for long-range pro
jects. "Some things aren't going to get
donethis year, such as getting a student on
the Board of Trustees and having students
on committees that decide tenure, but
we've made it possible for a future COP,'
lie explains.
This is where the COP members feel
they differ from those of past COPs.
"We've been concerned with long-range
ideas rather than the short-term programs
previous COPs have confined themselves
to." savs Rosenbaum.

ASSI) President Lee Rosenbaum says
the aim of his Council of Presidents (COP)
during its first nine months in office has
been to lobby on behalf of students.
"We should act as a facilitator for stu
dents who want to organize student ser
vices and help students cut the administ
ration's red tape," Rosenbaum says.
Not all student politicos agree with
Rosenbaum's interpretation of his office's
duties, and some denigrate the COP's ef
fectiveness in even accomplishing what it
has set out to do.
ASSU Sen. Hob Ottilie, the COP's
foremost critic within student govern
ment. says the group has set the wrong
goals for its efforts.
ineffective'
"Rosenbaum's slate is ineffective in
providing any student services, which
should be the priority of the COP," Ottilie
says.
COP members counter Ottilie's criti
cism by saying they have more important
concerns than new student services.
Ottilie calls programs such as SYVOPSI.
SCIRE and the Action Research Liaison
Office (ARLO) pet projects of the COP
which are fine but do not benefit the
majority of students. "They (COP mem
bers) are pushing a lot of good things, but
they're for the minority of students," Ot
tilie contends.
"Students don't come to Stanford for its

student services. They come here for its
flexibility and its programs which allow
for student initiative. Programs such as
SWOPSI and SCIRE are more important
Lecture Note Service," Vice President
Charlotte Germane says.
The COP members claim it is easier for
students to set up student services on their
own. with help from the COP if the stu
dents want it. Germane cites examples

such as the hiring of a new gynecologist at
Cowell and the establishment of the shut
tle bus service.
'Students worked together'
"In those cases, students worked to
gether, directly with the University to es
tablish those services," she says.
"We have established some services we
felt were needed, such as peer advising to
help students make decisions concerning
their classes and the Off-Campus Student
Living Guide to help students who live
off-campus," Germane adds.
Their first priority is to get students in
volved in the Universities decision
making process, the COP members agree.
"We've tried to get more students in
volved through programs like the Com
munication Committee where we can have
a direct exchange of information with stu
dents," vice president Josie Jaramillo says.
More productive
Rosenbaum adds that the COP's goal is
not only to get more students interested in
committees, but no make those already in
terested more productive.
"We organized a committee orientation
program last spring for students interested
in being on committies." he says.
Ottilie accuses the COP. particularly
Galligan, of having made political ap
pointments to committees. "The decisions
on committee members were already
made when students were being asked
questions by the nominations committee,

chaired by Galligan," he contends.
Ottilie said he feels that a set of objective
criteria should be established and nomina
tions should be based on these criteria, not
any political considerations. Sex or ethnic
background may be a qualification, but it
should not take precedence, Ottilie feels.
The COP denies that any "political" ap
pointments were made, but concedes that
it did make a mistake when it failed to

publicize that students were being
selected for a committee to choose the new
dean of undergraduate studies.

Living Guide to help students who live
off-campus," Germane adds.
Their first priority is to get students in
volved in the Universities decision
making process, the COP members agree.
"We've tried to get more students in
volved through programs like the Com
munication Committee where we can have
a direct exchange of information with stu
dents," vice president Josie Jaramillo says.
More productive
Rosenbaum adds that the COP's goal is
not only to get more students interested in
committees, but no make those already in
terested more productive.
"We organized a committee orientation
program last spring for students interested
in being on committies." he says.
Ottilie accuses the COP. particularly
Galligan, of having made political ap
pointments to committees. "The decisions
on committee members were already
made when students were being asked
questions by the nominations committee,

chaired by Galligan," he contends.
Ottilie said he feels that a set of objective
criteria should be established and nomina
tions should be based on these criteria, not
any political considerations. Sex or ethnic
background may be a qualification, but it
should not take precedence, Ottilie feels.
The COP denies that any "political" ap
pointments were made, but concedes that
it did make a mistake when it failed to

publicize that students were being
selected for a committee to choose the new
dean of undergraduate studies.
"We were told by (Provost) William Mil
ler that he wanted only students who had
previously been on committees to be on
the selection committee." Rosenbaum re
calls.
Students qualified
"We asked students who we felt were
qualified and made recommendations
from them to the (ASSU) Senate for ap
proval," he continues.
"The senate was then free to accept or
reject the nominations," Rosenbaum con
cludes.
Germane admits that the COP has been
slower in accomplishing its goals than it
had hoped'.'Thingsgo very slowly and take
a long time to get done. We never said we
would get everything done," she notes.
Rosenbaum says the COP has estab
lished the groundwork for long-range pro
jects. "Some things aren't going to get
donethis year, such as getting a student on
the Board of Trustees and having students
on committees that decide tenure, but
we've made it possible for a future COP,'
lie explains.
This is where the COP members feel
they differ from those of past COPs.
"We've been concerned with long-range
ideas rather than the short-term programs
previous COPs have confined themselves
to." savs Rosenbaum.
