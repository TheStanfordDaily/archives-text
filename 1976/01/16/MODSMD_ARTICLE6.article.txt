## Priorities 
### 
The Committee on Services to Students (COSS) has
recommended that present residence priorities for
freshmen be terminated in the spring of 1977.
In so doing, COSS recognized that freshman resi
dence priority is unjust and should be eliminated, but
the committee failed to recognize further ramifications
of the present residence system as a whole.
"Continuity" is the catchword of those who endorse
the existing system. But it is difficult to see any link
between continuity and the programmatic excellence
which is supposed to result.
If anything, continuity discourages innovative, in
vigorating programs. In four-class dorms, "con
tinuity" often fosters a sort of tyranny over house rules
and activities by those students who had present resi
dence priority and can claim up to three years' senior
ity over newcomers.
Another drawback of the present residence priority
system will become increasingly apparent as the
"guaranteed" housing system takes effect.
At present, the Housing Office has not decided if a
student forced off campus during his non-guaranteed
year will retain priority in his old house.
If such students do receive present residence
priorities enrollment fluctuation and other factors
could easily render more priorities than spaces within
a house.
However, denying students continued priority dur
ing the non-guaranteed year has even more serious
implications. A student randomly assigned a junior
non-guaranteed year, for example, could never estab
lish priority until after his senior year. Freshmen
would have no priority under the proposed COSS plan
and priority after sophomore year would be worthless
because the junior year would be, almost certainly,
spent off campus. Gaining this priority at the end of
senior year is hardly desirable.
As Larry Horton, associate dean of student affairs for
residential education, has explained, the current draw
system is "no sacred cow." It requires constant over
view and modification, when necessary.
The system's current emphasis — equitable distribu
tion of on-campus housing — should be changed to
include a consideration of equitable distribution of
quality spaces within the on-campus system.
As a step in the right direction, we urge the abolition
of present residence priorities for all students, begin
ning in this spring's draw. The inequities of the current
system are clear; the system should not continue
another year.
After all, life in Manzanita Park is no piece of cake.
