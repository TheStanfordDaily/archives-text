# New majors unneeded
## 
### 
The figures in 808 Henry's
Jan. 12 Daily column, "New
Majors Needed," are largely cor
rect: about one third to one half
of Stanford's undergraduates are
interested in attending a profes
sional school of business, law,
medicine or the allied health
fields.
And perhaps sixty percent of
the majors in biological sci
ences are premedical students.
These figures have been rela
tively constant for some time.
It is there that Henry's column
ceases to be convincing, how
ever. for his assertions do not
stand up to close examination.
His theses seem to be:
1) that "for many students
Stanford is only preparation for
further education that will make
possible their desired career":
2) that preprofessional stu
dents — and no one else — are
uniformly guilty of elevating
grades over learning:
3) that rigid, required cur
ricula exist for all preprofes
sional students and should be
identified and institutionalized
as such;and
4) that these reprehensible
facts require Stanford's forming
separate, isolating majors for
preprofessional students.
Inherent evil?
As for the first hypothesis, it
is, of course, true, but can hardly

be limited to preprofessional
students. (And what is, after all,
so inherently evil in a student's
using his or her education here
to make possible the realization
of later aims?)
Assertion number two falls
into this same category and im
plies a division between grades
and learning which is by no
means tautological.
Assertion three is simply not
true. There exists no course, let
alone a curriculum, required at
the undergraduate level for stu
dents interested in going on to
graduate study in law or busi
ness.
While Henry claims that he is
not "attacking career-minded
students," the tone of his article
does precisely that.
Inferiority
Preprofessional students are
all consigned to intellectual in
feriority and do not learn
but ought to be shunted off
rather mercilessly into a voca
tionally oriented track of
courses.
This line of thinking rein
forces, first, a notion which is
simply not justified: that prepro
fessional students don't learn.
The definition of learning re
mains moot; presumably, learn
ing is what Henry and other

Robert Hamrdla

non-preprofessional students
do.
Separate majors
Establishing separate majors
for premedical, prelaw and pre
business students would only
exacerbate the negative aspects
of preprofessionalism.
Professional schools nowa
days are actively interested in at
tracting and accepting students
who have pursued something
other than preprofessional
courses.
Forcing students into such
constrained majors would un
fairly and prejudicially deprive
them of the opportunity to pur
sue in depth an intellectual area
not allied to their professional
aim — which, in fairness, many
of them do.
My opinions are not intended
to defend the aspects of prepro
fessional education which make
it more difficult for the students
in it to pursue learning for learn
ing's sake.
But Henry's proposal is akin to
throwing away the key to the
academic prison he creates —
leaving half of our under
graduates inside — rather than
helping to open the gate.
