# Arabs not a united group
## 
### 
(First of two parts)
Robert Smith posed several
vital questions in his Daily col
umnsofjan. Band 9onthePales
tinian issue:
Why did the Arabs attack Is
rael in 1948? What happened to
the territory which was granted
to the Palestinian state by the
United Nations? Why have the
Arabs not absorbed the Palesti
nians into their countries?
Two methods of response
suggest themselves, depending
upon one's motives. One could
wax at once erudite and

picayune and present the lesser
known truths which surround
each of the facts Smith cited.
Such a response might begin
something like this:
"The Arabs attacked Israel in
1948 after the Israelis presented
the world with a fait accompli in
contravention of the United Na
tions.
Expansion
"In the five months from Nov.
29, 1947, when the state of Israel
was set up by the U.N. General
Assembly, to May 14, 1948,
when Prime Minister David
Ben-Gurion proclaimed Israeli
independence, Zionist military
forces (not officially the Israeli
Army) overran the boundaries
between the Jewish and the
Palestinian states established by
the U.N., expanding the area of
Israel some 26 percent.
"Arab armies attacked when
Ben-Gurion said the expanded
entity constituted the sovereign
state of Israel. Zionists assassi
nated the U.N. mediator sent to
settle the situation.
"Even with ineffective coor
dination and organization, the
Arab forces did not attempt to
seize areas which had been orig
inally designated by the U.N. as
Israeli territory. Their military
objective was to retrieve the
Palestinian sectors overrun by
the Zionist militia and annexed
by Israel."
Not answer
Such a response only presents
the "other side" to thequestions,
not the answers. It's a quibbling
reply.
Stacking historical half-truths
on either side of the Palestinian
issue and hurling them at your
opponent is a tragic "snowball
effect" seemingly inherent in
discussions on the Middle East
these days — tragic because it
leaves the Palestinians caught in
the middle as everyone's pawn
without a king of their own.
The only acceptable method of
response if one is concerned
with ameliorating the Palesti
nian issue and the attendant
slaughter of all the various in
habitants of the region, is to
acknowledge Smith's facts, join
them with the complete reality

and advance toward some solid
solutions.
Interprtations
Americans have a penchant
for interpreting international
politics in monolithic terms. It
took us a long time to accept the
validity of the Sino-Soviet split
in the Communist World, an
even longer time to understand
the predominance of local
nationalisms within that split
"world."
When our attention was
turned to the poorer peoples of
the world, we immediately
labeled them the Third World.
Since then we have reluctantly
recognized a Fourth World.
On a regional level, we
categorize with the same zeal. In
the Middle East it's "the Arabs"
versus the Israelis.
One mass
The "Arabs" are viewed as a
single mass with interchange
able parts. Within the confines of
this perspective, it's extremely
reasonable to wonder why "the
Arabs" simply don't "absorb"
this little popular droplet called
the Palestinians.
A hint of the incorrectness of
this view is provided by the fact
that the people who live there
don't share it.
If Middle Eastern socio
political realities corresponded
to that widely held American
view, Israel probably would not
exist today — nor would Jordan,
or, for that matter. Egypt, Syria,
Lebanon, Saudi Arabia or any of
the other independent states in
which Arabic is predominantly
spoken.
There are more different loyal
ties among Arabic peoples than
there are states in the region.
While there is a general sense
of "being Arab" among these
peoples due in great measure to
their common familiarity with
classical Arabic, the language of
Islam, to refer to "the Arabs" as a
united group is grossly mislead
ing. Ask the Israelis.
Israeli strategists are grateful
such divisions are very real. No
less an authority on Israeli
foreign relations than Abba Eban
wrote a small book entitled. The
Tide of Nationalism, in which

Karl Georgi

he presents a somewhat exagg
erated picture of the disunity
which is a fact of Middle Eastern
politics.
Or, ask the Egyptians. They
possess a long and proud tradi
tion of independent national
consciousness. They didn't even
officially consider themselves
Arabs until 1956.
Finally, ask the Palestinians.
They will identify themselves as
being from Palestine and proba
bly as Moslems before they will
call themselves "Arabs."
They are not part of a
monolithic Arab bloc who can fit
in anyplace. Palestinians are not
Jordanians.
Also, they are not Egyptians.
Kuwaitis, Lebanese or Syrians,
the countries in which many of
them live today. They are a
minority in those countries bur
dened with the stigmas
minorities everywhere suffer:
stereotyping and discrimina
tion.

Robert Smith posed several
vital questions in his Daily col
umnsofjan. Band 9onthePales
tinian issue:
Why did the Arabs attack Is
rael in 1948? What happened to
the territory which was granted
to the Palestinian state by the
United Nations? Why have the
Arabs not absorbed the Palesti
nians into their countries?
Two methods of response
suggest themselves, depending
upon one's motives. One could
wax at once erudite and

picayune and present the lesser
known truths which surround
each of the facts Smith cited.
Such a response might begin
something like this:
"The Arabs attacked Israel in
1948 after the Israelis presented
the world with a fait accompli in
contravention of the United Na
tions.
Expansion
"In the five months from Nov.
29, 1947, when the state of Israel
was set up by the U.N. General
Assembly, to May 14, 1948,
when Prime Minister David
Ben-Gurion proclaimed Israeli
independence, Zionist military
forces (not officially the Israeli
Army) overran the boundaries
between the Jewish and the
Palestinian states established by
the U.N., expanding the area of
Israel some 26 percent.
"Arab armies attacked when
Ben-Gurion said the expanded
entity constituted the sovereign
state of Israel. Zionists assassi
nated the U.N. mediator sent to
settle the situation.
"Even with ineffective coor
dination and organization, the
Arab forces did not attempt to
seize areas which had been orig
inally designated by the U.N. as
Israeli territory. Their military
objective was to retrieve the
Palestinian sectors overrun by
the Zionist militia and annexed
by Israel."
Not answer
Such a response only presents
the "other side" to thequestions,
not the answers. It's a quibbling
reply.
Stacking historical half-truths
on either side of the Palestinian
issue and hurling them at your
opponent is a tragic "snowball
effect" seemingly inherent in
discussions on the Middle East
these days — tragic because it
leaves the Palestinians caught in
the middle as everyone's pawn
without a king of their own.
The only acceptable method of
response if one is concerned
with ameliorating the Palesti
nian issue and the attendant
slaughter of all the various in
habitants of the region, is to
acknowledge Smith's facts, join
them with the complete reality

and advance toward some solid
solutions.
Interprtations
Americans have a penchant
for interpreting international
politics in monolithic terms. It
took us a long time to accept the
validity of the Sino-Soviet split
in the Communist World, an
even longer time to understand
the predominance of local
nationalisms within that split
"world."
When our attention was
turned to the poorer peoples of
the world, we immediately
labeled them the Third World.
Since then we have reluctantly
recognized a Fourth World.
On a regional level, we
categorize with the same zeal. In
the Middle East it's "the Arabs"
versus the Israelis.
One mass
The "Arabs" are viewed as a
single mass with interchange
able parts. Within the confines of
this perspective, it's extremely
reasonable to wonder why "the
Arabs" simply don't "absorb"
this little popular droplet called
the Palestinians.
A hint of the incorrectness of
this view is provided by the fact
that the people who live there
don't share it.
If Middle Eastern socio
political realities corresponded
to that widely held American
view, Israel probably would not
exist today — nor would Jordan,
or, for that matter. Egypt, Syria,
Lebanon, Saudi Arabia or any of
the other independent states in
which Arabic is predominantly
spoken.
There are more different loyal
ties among Arabic peoples than
there are states in the region.
While there is a general sense
of "being Arab" among these
peoples due in great measure to
their common familiarity with
classical Arabic, the language of
Islam, to refer to "the Arabs" as a
united group is grossly mislead
ing. Ask the Israelis.
Israeli strategists are grateful
such divisions are very real. No
less an authority on Israeli
foreign relations than Abba Eban
wrote a small book entitled. The
Tide of Nationalism, in which

Karl Georgi

he presents a somewhat exagg
erated picture of the disunity
which is a fact of Middle Eastern
politics.
Or, ask the Egyptians. They
possess a long and proud tradi
tion of independent national
consciousness. They didn't even
officially consider themselves
Arabs until 1956.
Finally, ask the Palestinians.
They will identify themselves as
being from Palestine and proba
bly as Moslems before they will
call themselves "Arabs."
They are not part of a
monolithic Arab bloc who can fit
in anyplace. Palestinians are not
Jordanians.
Also, they are not Egyptians.
Kuwaitis, Lebanese or Syrians,
the countries in which many of
them live today. They are a
minority in those countries bur
dened with the stigmas
minorities everywhere suffer:
stereotyping and discrimina

Robert Smith posed several
vital questions in his Daily col
umnsofjan. Band 9onthePales
tinian issue:
Why did the Arabs attack Is
rael in 1948? What happened to
the territory which was granted
to the Palestinian state by the
United Nations? Why have the
Arabs not absorbed the Palesti
nians into their countries?
Two methods of response
suggest themselves, depending
upon one's motives. One could
wax at once erudite and

picayune and present the lesser
known truths which surround
each of the facts Smith cited.
Such a response might begin
something like this:
"The Arabs attacked Israel in
1948 after the Israelis presented
the world with a fait accompli in
contravention of the United Na
tions.
Expansion
"In the five months from Nov.
29, 1947, when the state of Israel
was set up by the U.N. General
Assembly, to May 14, 1948,
when Prime Minister David
Ben-Gurion proclaimed Israeli
independence, Zionist military
forces (not officially the Israeli
Army) overran the boundaries
between the Jewish and the
Palestinian states established by
the U.N., expanding the area of
Israel some 26 percent.
"Arab armies attacked when
Ben-Gurion said the expanded
entity constituted the sovereign
state of Israel. Zionists assassi
nated the U.N. mediator sent to
settle the situation.
"Even with ineffective coor
dination and organization, the
Arab forces did not attempt to
seize areas which had been orig
inally designated by the U.N. as
Israeli territory. Their military
objective was to retrieve the
Palestinian sectors overrun by
the Zionist militia and annexed
by Israel."
Not answer
Such a response only presents
the "other side" to thequestions,
not the answers. It's a quibbling
reply.
Stacking historical half-truths
on either side of the Palestinian
issue and hurling them at your
opponent is a tragic "snowball
effect" seemingly inherent in
discussions on the Middle East
these days — tragic because it
leaves the Palestinians caught in
the middle as everyone's pawn
without a king of their own.
The only acceptable method of
response if one is concerned
with ameliorating the Palesti
nian issue and the attendant
slaughter of all the various in
habitants of the region, is to
acknowledge Smith's facts, join
them with the complete reality

and advance toward some solid
solutions.
Interprtations
Americans have a penchant
for interpreting international
politics in monolithic terms. It
took us a long time to accept the
validity of the Sino-Soviet split
in the Communist World, an
even longer time to understand
the predominance of local
nationalisms within that split
"world."
When our attention was
turned to the poorer peoples of
the world, we immediately
labeled them the Third World.
Since then we have reluctantly
recognized a Fourth World.
On a regional level, we
categorize with the same zeal. In
the Middle East it's "the Arabs"
versus the Israelis.
One mass
The "Arabs" are viewed as a
single mass with interchange
able parts. Within the confines of
this perspective, it's extremely
reasonable to wonder why "the
Arabs" simply don't "absorb"
this little popular droplet called
the Palestinians.
A hint of the incorrectness of
this view is provided by the fact
that the people who live there
don't share it.
If Middle Eastern socio
political realities corresponded
to that widely held American
view, Israel probably would not
exist today — nor would Jordan,
or, for that matter. Egypt, Syria,
Lebanon, Saudi Arabia or any of
the other independent states in
which Arabic is predominantly
spoken.
There are more different loyal
ties among Arabic peoples than
there are states in the region.
While there is a general sense
of "being Arab" among these
peoples due in great measure to
their common familiarity with
classical Arabic, the language of
Islam, to refer to "the Arabs" as a
united group is grossly mislead
ing. Ask the Israelis.
Israeli strategists are grateful
such divisions are very real. No
less an authority on Israeli
foreign relations than Abba Eban
wrote a small book entitled. The
Tide of Nationalism, in which

Karl Georgi

he presents a somewhat exagg
erated picture of the disunity
which is a fact of Middle Eastern
politics.
Or, ask the Egyptians. They
possess a long and proud tradi
tion of independent national
consciousness. They didn't even
officially consider themselves
Arabs until 1956.
Finally, ask the Palestinians.
They will identify themselves as
being from Palestine and proba
bly as Moslems before they will
call themselves "Arabs."
They are not part of a
monolithic Arab bloc who can fit
in anyplace. Palestinians are not
Jordanians.
Also, they are not Egyptians.
Kuwaitis, Lebanese or Syrians,
the countries in which many of
them live today. They are a
minority in those countries bur
dened with the stigmas
minorities everywhere suffer:
stereotyping and discrimina
tion.
