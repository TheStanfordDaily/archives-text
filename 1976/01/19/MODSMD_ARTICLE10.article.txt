## Angola 
### 
The confrontation in Angola is tragic, as many citi
zens of that nation will be needlessly killed before the
conflict is resolved. The "aid" of countries such as
Cuba, the Soviet Union and the United States is quite
upsetting as this assistance only leads to death on a
larger and more horrible scale.
For the United States, Angola is even more frighten
ing since it looms as the Vietnam of the 19705. State
ments by some of our government leaders sound like
those we heard so many times during the Kennedy,
Johnson and Nixon administration.
The U.S. Senate was correct in cutting off all aid to
Angola. We hope President Gerald Ford will recon
sider and order the CIA to cease supplying arms to the
non-communist Angolan factions. All CIA operatives
in that area should also be immediately withdrawn.
Current diplomatic negotiations with the Soviet
Union to end their support to Angola are heartening.
This approach should be pursued to the utmost.
However, if the Soviet Union and the United States
cannot come to an agreement over Angola, no action
should be taken against the Soviet Union.
