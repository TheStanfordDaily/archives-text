The Jan. 7 Daily article decry
ing the cataclysmic implications
of Stanford's having a single
campus computing facility reve
als a dangerous sensationalism
in reporting a serious problem.
There does not exist today,
and I doubt there will ever exist,
a computer system impervious
to penetration. Since it is physi
cally and programatically im
possible to prevent computer
trespass, achieving a certain
level of security merely means a
certain amount of effort is spent
protecting the computer, and a
proportional (and hopefully,
greater) effort must be spent to
violate that security.
It is naive to assume any par
ticular measure (short of
eliminating the computer) will
provide a certain degree of sec
urity. David Roode's conjecture
that "two separate machines
would give security" ignores the
fact people who are not sup
posed to use a given computer
can often find ways to use and
abuse it.
Sharing computer
Nonetheless, there are many
cases of computer systems suc
cessfully shared by "an
tagonists," as students and ad
ministration are tacitly assumed
to be. I suggest those successful
systems might be worthy of
some of the attention that is
given to those which failed.
Perhaps studying them might
show how Stanford's computer
system could succeed.
At a basic level, the new com
puter system offers a far more
secure environment tharidid the
old one. Additional efforts
should make it more secure than
most people require.
This is not to say that no more
need be done. It is clear that
more effort expended by the
Stanford Center for Information
Processing (SCIP), as well as
more effort expended by the
users of the computer, will pro
vide a higher level of security.
Additional measures
It is not obvious, however, that
additional protection measures
will yield a much more secure
system. Almost invariably, the
weakest link in a protection
scheme is the end user.
Even in the most secure sys
tem, a person who does not
maintain constant security vigi
lance will sooner or later fall
prey to the computerized evil
doer. What does seem clear is
that computer users, in particu
lar administrative users, must
also take every reasonable step
toward making the system sec
ure.
Computer crime is no more the
sole responsibility of SCIP than

campus crime is the sole respon
sibility of the police depart
ment.
In this sense, computer crime
is like any other crime. Poaching
is no different from robbery;
bringing the system down is no
different from vandalism; sabot
age, invasion of privacy, embez
zlement, fraud — almost any
crime can be committed on or
with the aid of a computer sys
tem.
Seems different
Yet for some reason, perhaps
because everything is so imper
sonal, for many people it does
not seem so wrong to cheat a
computer as to cheat a person.
People who would never hold
up the University cashier's office
will steal computer time.
And whereas a person
wouldn't take advantage of a
child, he will gloat over how eas
ily he cracked a computer sys
tem which was not designed to
be attacked by its users.
What I find most amazing,
and, at the same time, most dis
maying, is the honor and respect
accorded those who manage to
violate the security system.
"Former poachers" are treated as
authorities on computer protec
tion. (By the way, how does one
distinguish a former poacher
from a current one?).
People who successfully cir
cumvent the security system are
considered daring and become
veritable folk heroes. What is
easy to overlook is it is no more
difficult to commit computer
crime than it is to commit other
crime.
Persistency will win
Any sufficiently persistent
person will win in the end. It is
ultimately a matter of morals
whether a person will try to viol
ate the security system.
For, in the final analysis, com
puter security is like the lock on
your door — it will keep out only
those who allow themselves to
be kept out.
Yet, as long as it remains fash
ionable to be a computer outlaw,
and as long as segments of the
community continue to idolize
computer criminals, people
looking for excitement and at
tention will continue to make
life difficult for the rest of the
community.
For those people who seem to
need to "prove" themselves on
computers, I would suggest they
try devising ways to protect the
computer system, and their own
data and programs. It certainly
takes more insight to prevent
security violations than to cause
them.

Persistency will win
Any sufficiently persistent
person will win in the end. It is
ultimately a matter of morals
whether a person will try to viol
ate the security system.
For, in the final analysis, com
puter security is like the lock on
your door — it will keep out only
those who allow themselves to
be kept out.
Yet, as long as it remains fash
ionable to be a computer outlaw,
and as long as segments of the
community continue to idolize
computer criminals, people
looking for excitement and at
tention will continue to make
life difficult for the rest of the
community.
For those people who seem to
need to "prove" themselves on
computers, I would suggest they
try devising ways to protect the
computer system, and their own
data and programs. It certainly
takes more insight to prevent
security violations than to cause
them.

The Jan. 7 Daily article decry
ing the cataclysmic implications
of Stanford's having a single
campus computing facility reve
als a dangerous sensationalism
in reporting a serious problem.
There does not exist today,
and I doubt there will ever exist,
a computer system impervious
to penetration. Since it is physi
cally and programatically im
possible to prevent computer
trespass, achieving a certain
level of security merely means a
certain amount of effort is spent
protecting the computer, and a
proportional (and hopefully,
greater) effort must be spent to
violate that security.
It is naive to assume any par
ticular measure (short of
eliminating the computer) will
provide a certain degree of sec
urity. David Roode's conjecture
that "two separate machines
would give security" ignores the
fact people who are not sup
posed to use a given computer
can often find ways to use and
abuse it.
Sharing computer
Nonetheless, there are many
cases of computer systems suc
cessfully shared by "an
tagonists," as students and ad
ministration are tacitly assumed
to be. I suggest those successful
systems might be worthy of
some of the attention that is
given to those which failed.
Perhaps studying them might
show how Stanford's computer
system could succeed.
At a basic level, the new com
puter system offers a far more
secure environment tharidid the
old one. Additional efforts
should make it more secure than
most people require.
This is not to say that no more
need be done. It is clear that
more effort expended by the
Stanford Center for Information
Processing (SCIP), as well as
more effort expended by the
users of the computer, will pro
vide a higher level of security.
Additional measures
It is not obvious, however, that
additional protection measures
will yield a much more secure
system. Almost invariably, the
weakest link in a protection
scheme is the end user.
Even in the most secure sys
tem, a person who does not
maintain constant security vigi
lance will sooner or later fall
prey to the computerized evil
doer. What does seem clear is
that computer users, in particu
lar administrative users, must
also take every reasonable step
toward making the system sec
ure.
Computer crime is no more the
sole responsibility of SCIP than

campus crime is the sole respon
sibility of the police depart
ment.
In this sense, computer crime
is like any other crime. Poaching
is no different from robbery;
bringing the system down is no
different from vandalism; sabot
age, invasion of privacy, embez
zlement, fraud — almost any
crime can be committed on or
with the aid of a computer sys
tem.
Seems different
Yet for some reason, perhaps
because everything is so imper
sonal, for many people it does
not seem so wrong to cheat a
computer as to cheat a person.
People who would never hold
up the University cashier's office
will steal computer time.
And whereas a person
wouldn't take advantage of a
child, he will gloat over how eas
ily he cracked a computer sys
tem which was not designed to
be attacked by its users.
What I find most amazing,
and, at the same time, most dis
maying, is the honor and respect
accorded those who manage to
violate the security system.
"Former poachers" are treated as
authorities on computer protec

distinguish a former poacher
from a current one?).
People who successfully cir

age, invasion of privacy, embez
zlement, fraud — almost any
crime can be committed on or
with the aid of a computer sys
tem.
Seems different
Yet for some reason, perhaps
because everything is so imper
sonal, for many people it does
not seem so wrong to cheat a
computer as to cheat a person.
People who would never hold
up the University cashier's office
will steal computer time.
And whereas a person
wouldn't take advantage of a
child, he will gloat over how eas
ily he cracked a computer sys
tem which was not designed to
be attacked by its users.
What I find most amazing,
and, at the same time, most dis
maying, is the honor and respect
accorded those who manage to
violate the security system.
"Former poachers" are treated as
authorities on computer protec
tion. (By the way, how does one
distinguish a former poacher
from a current one?).
People who successfully cir
cumvent the security system are
considered daring and become
veritable folk heroes. What is
easy to overlook is it is no more
difficult to commit computer
crime than it is to commit other
crime.
Persistency will win
Any sufficiently persistent
person will win in the end. It is
ultimately a matter of morals
whether a person will try to viol
ate the security system.
For, in the final analysis, com
puter security is like the lock on
your door — it will keep out only
those who allow themselves to
be kept out.
Yet, as long as it remains fash
ionable to be a computer outlaw,
and as long as segments of the
community continue to idolize
computer criminals, people
looking for excitement and at
tention will continue to make
life difficult for the rest of the
community.
For those people who seem to
need to "prove" themselves on
computers, I would suggest they
try devising ways to protect the
computer system, and their own
data and programs. It certainly
takes more insight to prevent
security violations than to cause
them.
