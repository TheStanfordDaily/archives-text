When President Richard Nixon resigned,
Americans heaved a sigh of relief thinking
the great danger to the American republic,
known as "Watergate," had ended. Unfor
tunately, that nightmare is far from over.
Nixon and Attorneys General John
Mitchell and Richard Kleindienst, decided
to leave the American people with a "law
and order" bill which has now become Se
nate Bill (SBl), officially known as the
"Criminal Justice Code Reform Act of
1975."
SBl is a 753-page attempt to codify, re
form and revise the anachronistic, conflict
ing and incomprehensible criminal laws of
the United States. If ever a good idea pro
duced catastrophic results, this is it.
SBl,which has bipartisan support in the
Senate, has recently come under attack be
cause some of its provisions have been dis
covered.
There is not enough space to list all of
SBl's "law and order" proposals, but here
are a few:
ADVOCATING OVERTHROW OF THE
GOVERNMENT: This is a restoration of the
Smith Act — a McCarthy era anti
communist act which was later declared
unconstitutional. SBl makes it a crime to
advocate "then or art some future time" any
conduct which would "facilitate the forci
ble overthrow of the government." Punish-
years and asloo,ooofine.The First
Amendment is going . . .
DEMONSTRATING: Anyone de
monstrating in any way or form within 200
feet of a U.S. courthouse gets six months
and a $10,000 fine . , . The First Amend
ment is gone.
DISCLOSING NATIONAL DEFENSE IN
FORMATION: Anyone who communicates
national defense information to an unau
thorized person (e.g.., journalist) gets 15
years and a $100,000 fine during wartime or
a national defense "emergency"; any other
time it's only seven years and a $100,000
fine. (Under another section of SBl, any
government employe who fails to report the
loss or communication of such information
will receive seven years and a $100,000 fine.)

DISCLOSING CLASSIFIED INFORMA
TION: Remember "national security," that
historic phrase of Watergate? Any federal
public servant who communicates clas
sified information (which means informa
tion sensitive to national security and in
cludes information concerning U.S. milit
ary capability, planning, communications,
installations, weaponry, and all intelli
gence operations and plans) receives three
years and a $100,000 fine.

Stamp out the Daniel Ellsbergs. And don't
ask what happens to the reporter and news
paper which receive and publish this in
formation.
WIRETAPPING: J. Edgar Hoover, where
are you? Wiretapping is authorized for 64
categories of federal jurisdiction offenses —
not including those allowed under presi
dential authority. SBl permits wiretaps for
up to 48 hours without court approval. Big
Brother, we're ready.
COVER-UPS: This provision would have
allowed all of the Watergate conspirators to
be found innocent and to resume their gov
ernment duties. Correctly labelled a
"Nuremberg defense," it allows an affirma
tive defense for any government employe
who follows a law or directive subsequently
determined to be invalid, so long as the
employe "believed that his conduct did not
constitute an offense."
If John Ehrlichman, H.R. Haldeman and
Mitchell believed what they were doing
wasn't wrong, then (under this section) they
would have been innocent. What logic!!!
MARIJUANA POSSESSION: For those
who thought Jan. 1, 1976, was a great day,

bad news. UnderSßl possessing an amount
small enough for personal use: first convic
tion is 30 days and a $10,000 fine, second
conviction is six months and a $10,000 fine.
However, if one gives away eight ounces
or less, then the first conviction is only
seven years and $100,000 fine.
OBSCENITY: Reprinting this section will
probably be obscene and illegal itself.
SBl will also: reinstate the death penalty;
impose mandatory, minimum sentences
with no possibility of probation; and repeal
laws which currently punish economic re
taliation against persons exercising a civil
right.
The list of incredible provisions con
tinues. It's difficult to believe a branch of the
U.S. government could ever author such a
bill —a bill which is remarkably vague and
broad in most parts.
Many senators thinkSßl can be amended
to delete the dangerous provisions — but
those senators are just kidding themselves
and us.
The only way SBl can be handled is to
defeat the entire bill (let's not wait for the
Supreme Court to invalidate section after
section).
Let your senator know what you think
about SBl ;make your elected representative
do some work for a change and draft a bill
which conforms to the Constitution and the
Bill of Rights.
Streamlining and updating laws is vital
for any nation, especially a democracy. Yet
sacrificing all of our civil rights and liber
ties — especially during the Bicentennial —
is too great a price to pay for a current,
comprehensible criminal code.
SBl in some form or another, will pass
unless we let senators (and congressmen—
the 1 louse is considering similar legislation
underbills HB 333 and HB 3907) know they
will just have to wait a little longer for 1984.
Speak out now — otherwise Nixon and his
friends will have the last laugh.

constitute an offense."
If John Ehrlichman, H.R. Haldeman and
Mitchell believed what they were doing
wasn't wrong, then (under this section) they
would have been innocent. What logic!!!
MARIJUANA POSSESSION: For those
who thought Jan. 1, 1976, was a great day,

bad news. UnderSßl possessing an amount
small enough for personal use: first convic
tion is 30 days and a $10,000 fine, second
conviction is six months and a $10,000 fine.
However, if one gives away eight ounces
or less, then the first conviction is only
seven years and $100,000 fine.
OBSCENITY: Reprinting this section will
probably be obscene and illegal itself.
SBl will also: reinstate the death penalty;
impose mandatory, minimum sentences
with no possibility of probation; and repeal
laws which currently punish economic re
taliation against persons exercising a civil
right.
The list of incredible provisions con
tinues. It's difficult to believe a branch of the
U.S. government could ever author such a
bill —a bill which is remarkably vague and
broad in most parts.
Many senators thinkSßl can be amended
to delete the dangerous provisions — but
those senators are just kidding themselves
and us.
The only way SBl can be handled is to
defeat the entire bill (let's not wait for the
Supreme Court to invalidate section after
section).
Let your senator know what you think
about SBl ;make your elected representative
do some work for a change and draft a bill
which conforms to the Constitution and the
Bill of Rights.
Streamlining and updating laws is vital
for any nation, especially a democracy. Yet
sacrificing all of our civil rights and liber
ties — especially during the Bicentennial —
is too great a price to pay for a current,
comprehensible criminal code.
SBl in some form or another, will pass
unless we let senators (and congressmen—
the 1 louse is considering similar legislation
underbills HB 333 and HB 3907) know they
will just have to wait a little longer for 1984.

When President Richard Nixon resigned,
Americans heaved a sigh of relief thinking
the great danger to the American republic,
known as "Watergate," had ended. Unfor
tunately, that nightmare is far from over.
Nixon and Attorneys General John
Mitchell and Richard Kleindienst, decided
to leave the American people with a "law
and order" bill which has now become Se
nate Bill (SBl), officially known as the
"Criminal Justice Code Reform Act of
1975."
SBl is a 753-page attempt to codify, re
form and revise the anachronistic, conflict
ing and incomprehensible criminal laws of
the United States. If ever a good idea pro
duced catastrophic results, this is it.
SBl,which has bipartisan support in the
Senate, has recently come under attack be
cause some of its provisions have been dis
covered.
There is not enough space to list all of
SBl's "law and order" proposals, but here
are a few:
ADVOCATING OVERTHROW OF THE
GOVERNMENT: This is a restoration of the
Smith Act — a McCarthy era anti
communist act which was later declared
unconstitutional. SBl makes it a crime to
advocate "then or art some future time" any
conduct which would "facilitate the forci
ble overthrow of the government." Punish-
years and asloo,ooofine.The First
Amendment is going . . .
DEMONSTRATING: Anyone de
monstrating in any way or form within 200
feet of a U.S. courthouse gets six months
and a $10,000 fine . , . The First Amend
ment is gone.
DISCLOSING NATIONAL DEFENSE IN
FORMATION: Anyone who communicates
national defense information to an unau
thorized person (e.g.., journalist) gets 15
years and a $100,000 fine during wartime or
a national defense "emergency"; any other
time it's only seven years and a $100,000
fine. (Under another section of SBl, any
government employe who fails to report the
loss or communication of such information
will receive seven years and a $100,000 fine.)

DISCLOSING CLASSIFIED INFORMA
TION: Remember "national security," that
historic phrase of Watergate? Any federal
public servant who communicates clas
sified information (which means informa
tion sensitive to national security and in
cludes information concerning U.S. milit
ary capability, planning, communications,
installations, weaponry, and all intelli
gence operations and plans) receives three
years and a $100,000 fine.

Stamp out the Daniel Ellsbergs. And don't
ask what happens to the reporter and news
paper which receive and publish this in
formation.
WIRETAPPING: J. Edgar Hoover, where
are you? Wiretapping is authorized for 64
categories of federal jurisdiction offenses —
not including those allowed under presi
dential authority. SBl permits wiretaps for
up to 48 hours without court approval. Big
Brother, we're ready.
COVER-UPS: This provision would have
allowed all of the Watergate conspirators to
be found innocent and to resume their gov
ernment duties. Correctly labelled a
"Nuremberg defense," it allows an affirma
tive defense for any government employe
who follows a law or directive subsequently
determined to be invalid, so long as the
employe "believed that his conduct did not
constitute an offense."
If John Ehrlichman, H.R. Haldeman and
Mitchell believed what they were doing
wasn't wrong, then (under this section) they

ADVOCATING OVERTHROW OF THE
GOVERNMENT: This is a restoration of the
Smith Act — a McCarthy era anti
communist act which was later declared
unconstitutional. SBl makes it a crime to
advocate "then or art some future time" any
conduct which would "facilitate the forci
ble overthrow of the government." Punish-
years and asloo,ooofine.The First
Amendment is going . . .
DEMONSTRATING: Anyone de
monstrating in any way or form within 200
feet of a U.S. courthouse gets six months
and a $10,000 fine . , . The First Amend
ment is gone.
DISCLOSING NATIONAL DEFENSE IN
FORMATION: Anyone who communicates
national defense information to an unau
thorized person (e.g.., journalist) gets 15
years and a $100,000 fine during wartime or
a national defense "emergency"; any other
time it's only seven years and a $100,000
fine. (Under another section of SBl, any
government employe who fails to report the
loss or communication of such information
will receive seven years and a $100,000 fine.)

DISCLOSING CLASSIFIED INFORMA
TION: Remember "national security," that
historic phrase of Watergate? Any federal
public servant who communicates clas
sified information (which means informa
tion sensitive to national security and in
cludes information concerning U.S. milit
ary capability, planning, communications,
installations, weaponry, and all intelli
gence operations and plans) receives three
years and a $100,000 fine.

Stamp out the Daniel Ellsbergs. And don't
ask what happens to the reporter and news
paper which receive and publish this in
formation.
WIRETAPPING: J. Edgar Hoover, where
are you? Wiretapping is authorized for 64
categories of federal jurisdiction offenses —
not including those allowed under presi
dential authority. SBl permits wiretaps for
up to 48 hours without court approval. Big
Brother, we're ready.
COVER-UPS: This provision would have
allowed all of the Watergate conspirators to
be found innocent and to resume their gov
ernment duties. Correctly labelled a
"Nuremberg defense," it allows an affirma
tive defense for any government employe
who follows a law or directive subsequently
determined to be invalid, so long as the
employe "believed that his conduct did not
constitute an offense."
If John Ehrlichman, H.R. Haldeman and
Mitchell believed what they were doing
wasn't wrong, then (under this section) they
would have been innocent. What logic!!!
MARIJUANA POSSESSION: For those
who thought Jan. 1, 1976, was a great day,

bad news. UnderSßl possessing an amount
small enough for personal use: first convic
tion is 30 days and a $10,000 fine, second
conviction is six months and a $10,000 fine.
However, if one gives away eight ounces
or less, then the first conviction is only
seven years and $100,000 fine.
OBSCENITY: Reprinting this section will
probably be obscene and illegal itself.
SBl will also: reinstate the death penalty;
impose mandatory, minimum sentences
with no possibility of probation; and repeal
laws which currently punish economic re
taliation against persons exercising a civil
right.
The list of incredible provisions con
tinues. It's difficult to believe a branch of the
U.S. government could ever author such a
bill —a bill which is remarkably vague and
broad in most parts.
Many senators thinkSßl can be amended
to delete the dangerous provisions — but
those senators are just kidding themselves
and us.
The only way SBl can be handled is to
defeat the entire bill (let's not wait for the
Supreme Court to invalidate section after
section).
Let your senator know what you think
about SBl ;make your elected representative
do some work for a change and draft a bill
which conforms to the Constitution and the
Bill of Rights.
Streamlining and updating laws is vital
for any nation, especially a democracy. Yet
sacrificing all of our civil rights and liber
ties — especially during the Bicentennial —
is too great a price to pay for a current,
comprehensible criminal code.
SBl in some form or another, will pass
unless we let senators (and congressmen—
the 1 louse is considering similar legislation
underbills HB 333 and HB 3907) know they
will just have to wait a little longer for 1984.
Speak out now — otherwise Nixon and his
friends will have the last laugh.

When President Richard Nixon resigned,
Americans heaved a sigh of relief thinking
the great danger to the American republic,
known as "Watergate," had ended. Unfor
tunately, that nightmare is far from over.
Nixon and Attorneys General John
Mitchell and Richard Kleindienst, decided
to leave the American people with a "law
and order" bill which has now become Se
nate Bill (SBl), officially known as the
"Criminal Justice Code Reform Act of
1975."
SBl is a 753-page attempt to codify, re
form and revise the anachronistic, conflict
ing and incomprehensible criminal laws of
the United States. If ever a good idea pro
duced catastrophic results, this is it.
SBl,which has bipartisan support in the
Senate, has recently come under attack be
cause some of its provisions have been dis
covered.
There is not enough space to list all of
SBl's "law and order" proposals, but here
