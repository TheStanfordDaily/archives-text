# Palestinians: dedicated nationalists

I Second of two parts)
A major reason why Palesti
nians are not easily accepted in
the other Arab states is they usu
ally don't want to be. Many of
them especially do not want to
be Jordanian!
The fact many Palestinians are
Jordanian citizens is because
Jordan occupied what was once
to be a sector of the Palestinian
state and bestowed citizenship
upon the conquered, like the an
cient Romans used to do.
Probably more significant is
that a majority of Palestinians
have always distrusted the
Hashemite rulers of Jordan.
When the British created the
state of Transjordan in 1923,
they selected a member of the
Hashemite family of Mecca
(nowhere near Palestine) to be
their puppet ruler.
Most of the resident Palesti
nians owed their allegiance to
the religious head of Jerusalem,
the Grand Mufti, and to this day
still contest the validity of the
rule of the Hashemites.
Palestinian antipathy
The other Arab states recog
nized this long-standing Pales
tinian antipathy toward the
Hashemites at the famous Rabat
Conference which designated
the Palestinian Liberation Or
ganization (PLO) as "the sole
representative of the Palestinian
people," over Jordan King Hus
sein's vigorous protests.
Thus. Jordan's king is often
not a great fan of his Arabbrethe

ren and often hints at making
separate deals with Israel over
the West Bank in order to wrap
up his control of the Palestinians
without outside interference —
including that of the Palesti
nians themselves.
Recent news that Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhik Rabin and Hus
sein have been conducting sec
ret negotiations for the last four
months demonstrates the king's
persistence.
Zionism is nationalism. To
distinguish Zionism with any
other equation is rhetoric. All
nationalisms pretend to or
produce feelings of racial
exclusivity.
Own image
However, Zionism, as Jewish
nationalism, has created in its
own image Palestinian
nationalism. As many travelers
know, people exhibit a tendency
to perceive their homeland as
unique when they are absent
from it. They often develop a
stronger affinity for it.
If people are separated for long
periods from their homelands,
either they lose that affinity or.
as the course of the Zionist
movement itself dramatically
demonstrates, affinity can turn
to yearning which can eventu
ally promote heroic struggles for
"self-determination." Most
Palestinians have been away
from their homeland for a long
period.
Contrary to Smith's statement
that there were no Palestinian re
fugees at the time of Israeli inde

pendence, there were three quar
ters of a million of them.
Quoting Smith's own figures,
in 1946, two years before inde
pendence, the British numbered
the displaced Palestinians at be
tween 520,000 and 600,000.
Number growing
More to the point, this number
had been growing since the early
1920'5. When Jewish immigra
tion to British Palestine reached
flood level from 1933 to 1936 be
cause of Hitler's rise inGermany,
the Palestinian refugee count
soared correspondingly.
Some Palestinians have been
away from their homeland for
over 50 years and nearly half of
them for 30 years.
Palestinians, then, are not
some ill-defined sub-set of an
amorphous Arab mass. Palesti
nians, along with Zionists, are
some of the most dedicated
nationalists in the world today.
The ideal Palestinian state is
not Jordan but simply a Palesti
nian State. There is evidence to
suggest a growing number of
Palestinians would accept a
West Bank stateand this attitude
holds the promise of a solution.
The Zionists, on their part,
must face up to the consequ
ences of the logic underlying the
existence of their own state. Of
any people in the Middle East,
the Israelis should be able to best
understand the dynamics of
Palestinian nationalism.
Palestinians are Palestinians
and there is presently no state of
Palestine. Thus, one must be

created.
Tokeep talkingabout "absorb
ing" Palestinians into other
countries flies in the face of Is
rael's own history. Had early
Jewish nationalists been content
with being "absorbed" into their
host states, there would be no
Israel.
To speculate on the course of
future events is beyond the pur
pose of replying to Smith's ques
tions.
However, as the U.N. Palesti
nian debate proceeds, with Israel
speaking through its absence as
loudly as the Palestinians
through the PLO, it should be
come increasingly clear to
Americans the solution lies
largely in Tel Aviv and not in
New York or in Henry Kissing
er's briefcase.
It will take courageous and
thick-skinned Israeli statesmen
to engineer that solution. From
this perspective, the most impor
tant task lying before organized
Jewry in this country is to muster
vociferous support for Israeli
leaders such as Abba Eban and
Foreign Minister Yigal Allon,
who are on record suggesting es
tablishment of a Palestinian state
is probably the most reasonable
plan for peace in the region.
A continually defensive at
titude breeds paranoia. The in
itiative must be seized lest
reasonable actions be painted as
capitulations.

A major reason why Palesti
nians are not easily accepted in
the other Arab states is they usu
ally don't want to be. Many of
them especially do not want to
be Jordanian!
The fact many Palestinians are
Jordanian citizens is because
Jordan occupied what was once
to be a sector of the Palestinian
state and bestowed citizenship
upon the conquered, like the an
cient Romans used to do.
Probably more significant is
that a majority of Palestinians
have always distrusted the
Hashemite rulers of Jordan.
When the British created the
state of Transjordan in 1923,
they selected a member of the
Hashemite family of Mecca
(nowhere near Palestine) to be
their puppet ruler.
Most of the resident Palesti
nians owed their allegiance to
the religious head of Jerusalem,
the Grand Mufti, and to this day
still contest the validity of the
rule of the Hashemites.
Palestinian antipathy
The other Arab states recog
nized this long-standing Pales
tinian antipathy toward the
Hashemites at the famous Rabat
Conference which designated
the Palestinian Liberation Or
ganization (PLO) as "the sole
representative of the Palestinian
people," over Jordan King Hus
sein's vigorous protests.
Thus. Jordan's king is often
not a great fan of his Arabbrethe

ren and often hints at making
separate deals with Israel over
the West Bank in order to wrap
up his control of the Palestinians
without outside interference —
including that of the Palesti
nians themselves.
Recent news that Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhik Rabin and Hus
sein have been conducting sec
ret negotiations for the last four
months demonstrates the king's
persistence.
Zionism is nationalism. To
distinguish Zionism with any
other equation is rhetoric. All
nationalisms pretend to or
produce feelings of racial
exclusivity.
Own image
However, Zionism, as Jewish
nationalism, has created in its
own image Palestinian
nationalism. As many travelers
know, people exhibit a tendency
to perceive their homeland as
unique when they are absent
from it. They often develop a
stronger affinity for it.
If people are separated for long
periods from their homelands,
either they lose that affinity or.
as the course of the Zionist
movement itself dramatically
demonstrates, affinity can turn
to yearning which can eventu
ally promote heroic struggles for
"self-determination." Most
Palestinians have been away
from their homeland for a long
period.
Contrary to Smith's statement
that there were no Palestinian re
fugees at the time of Israeli inde

pendence, there were three quar
ters of a million of them.
Quoting Smith's own figures,
in 1946, two years before inde
pendence, the British numbered
the displaced Palestinians at be
tween 520,000 and 600,000.
Number growing
More to the point, this number
had been growing since the early
1920'5. When Jewish immigra
tion to British Palestine reached
flood level from 1933 to 1936 be
cause of Hitler's rise inGermany,
the Palestinian refugee count
soared correspondingly.
Some Palestinians have been
away from their homeland for
over 50 years and nearly half of
them for 30 years.
Palestinians, then, are not
some ill-defined sub-set of an
amorphous Arab mass. Palesti
nians, along with Zionists, are
some of the most dedicated
nationalists in the world today.
The ideal Palestinian state is
not Jordan but simply a Palesti
nian State. There is evidence to
suggest a growing number of
Palestinians would accept a
West Bank stateand this attitude
holds the promise of a solution.
The Zionists, on their part,
must face up to the consequ
ences of the logic underlying the
existence of their own state. Of
any people in the Middle East,
the Israelis should be able to best
understand the dynamics of
Palestinian nationalism.
Palestinians are Palestinians
and there is presently no state of
Palestine. Thus, one must be

Tokeep talkingabout "absorb

nians, along with Zionists, are
some of the most dedicated
nationalists in the world today.
The ideal Palestinian state is
not Jordan but simply a Palesti

suggest a growing number of
Palestinians would accept a
West Bank stateand this attitude
holds the promise of a solution.
The Zionists, on their part,
must face up to the consequ
ences of the logic underlying the
existence of their own state. Of
any people in the Middle East,
the Israelis should be able to best
understand the dynamics of
Palestinian nationalism.
Palestinians are Palestinians
and there is presently no state of
Palestine. Thus, one must be

Tokeep talkingabout "absorb
ing" Palestinians into other
countries flies in the face of Is
rael's own history. Had early
Jewish nationalists been content
with being "absorbed" into their
host states, there would be no
Israel.
To speculate on the course of
future events is beyond the pur
pose of replying to Smith's ques
tions.
However, as the U.N. Palesti
nian debate proceeds, with Israel
speaking through its absence as
loudly as the Palestinians
through the PLO, it should be
come increasingly clear to
Americans the solution lies
largely in Tel Aviv and not in
New York or in Henry Kissing
er's briefcase.
It will take courageous and
thick-skinned Israeli statesmen
to engineer that solution. From
this perspective, the most impor
tant task lying before organized
Jewry in this country is to muster
vociferous support for Israeli
leaders such as Abba Eban and
Foreign Minister Yigal Allon,
who are on record suggesting es
tablishment of a Palestinian state
is probably the most reasonable
plan for peace in the region.
A continually defensive at
titude breeds paranoia. The in
itiative must be seized lest
reasonable actions be painted as
capitulations.

A major reason why Palesti
nians are not easily accepted in
the other Arab states is they usu
ally don't want to be. Many of
them especially do not want to
be Jordanian!
The fact many Palestinians are
Jordanian citizens is because
Jordan occupied what was once
to be a sector of the Palestinian
state and bestowed citizenship
upon the conquered, like the an
cient Romans used to do.
Probably more significant is
that a majority of Palestinians
have always distrusted the
Hashemite rulers of Jordan.
When the British created the
state of Transjordan in 1923,
they selected a member of the
Hashemite family of Mecca
(nowhere near Palestine) to be
their puppet ruler.
Most of the resident Palesti
nians owed their allegiance to
the religious head of Jerusalem,
the Grand Mufti, and to this day
still contest the validity of the
rule of the Hashemites.
Palestinian antipathy
The other Arab states recog
nized this long-standing Pales
tinian antipathy toward the
Hashemites at the famous Rabat
Conference which designated
the Palestinian Liberation Or
ganization (PLO) as "the sole
representative of the Palestinian
people," over Jordan King Hus
sein's vigorous protests.
Thus. Jordan's king is often
not a great fan of his Arabbrethe

ren and often hints at making
separate deals with Israel over
the West Bank in order to wrap
up his control of the Palestinians
without outside interference —
including that of the Palesti
nians themselves.
Recent news that Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhik Rabin and Hus
sein have been conducting sec
ret negotiations for the last four
months demonstrates the king's
persistence.
Zionism is nationalism. To
distinguish Zionism with any
other equation is rhetoric. All
nationalisms pretend to or
produce feelings of racial
exclusivity.
Own image
However, Zionism, as Jewish
nationalism, has created in its
own image Palestinian
nationalism. As many travelers
know, people exhibit a tendency
to perceive their homeland as
unique when they are absent
from it. They often develop a
stronger affinity for it.
If people are separated for long
periods from their homelands,
either they lose that affinity or.
as the course of the Zionist
movement itself dramatically
demonstrates, affinity can turn
to yearning which can eventu
ally promote heroic struggles for
"self-determination." Most
Palestinians have been away
from their homeland for a long
period.
Contrary to Smith's statement
that there were no Palestinian re
fugees at the time of Israeli inde

pendence, there were three quar
ters of a million of them.
Quoting Smith's own figures,
in 1946, two years before inde
pendence, the British numbered
the displaced Palestinians at be
tween 520,000 and 600,000.
Number growing
More to the point, this number
had been growing since the early
1920'5. When Jewish immigra
tion to British Palestine reached
flood level from 1933 to 1936 be
cause of Hitler's rise inGermany,
the Palestinian refugee count
soared correspondingly.
Some Palestinians have been
away from their homeland for
over 50 years and nearly half of
them for 30 years.
Palestinians, then, are not
some ill-defined sub-set of an
amorphous Arab mass. Palesti
nians, along with Zionists, are
some of the most dedicated
nationalists in the world today.
