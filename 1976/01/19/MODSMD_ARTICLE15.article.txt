Choice or command?
Editor:
I sympathize with James Mor
gan's recent loss of his son in a
motorcycling accident, as de
scribed in his )an. 12 Daily col
umn.
However, as someone who has
ridden motorcycles for over 20
years and who always wears an
improved helmet, 1 am inaltera
bly opposed to a compulsory
helmet law and in complete ag
reement with Sen. Alan I
Cranston (D-Cal.).
In fact, 1 would go further and
propose a Constitutional
amendment, as follows: "Con
gress shall make no law protect
ing competent adults from con
sequences of their own actions."
I believe it is a contradiction to
assume government must pro
tect people from themselves be
cause "they don't know what is
best for them" and yet to assume
those same people have the
dom to elect legislators and chief
executives.
For a government to control
the actions of a person who can
harm only himself is to invite
government into every aspect of
our lives. Will government
snatch cigarettes from the lips of
smokers in their homes? Or for
bid motorcycling entirely'! 1 Or
skiing? Or skydiving? Or skate
boarding?
While 1 understand a parent's |
grief for his son, if the son de
cided in balancing between
freedom and safety he did not
wish to wear a helmet, why
should the government, or his
parents for that matter, have the
right to override his decision?

Economic equality
Editor:
Stephen Carter's Jan. 14 Daily
column "Blacks don't have it
made"is a moving statement of
disappointment and frustration
that greater social equality has
not accompanied economic in
roads made by blacks since the
death of Martin Luther King. I
am compelled, nonetheless, to
cite Carter for failing to recog
nize economic equality, (e.g. af- t
firmative action) as a "second
best" policy alternative to, not a
substitute for, theoptimal goal of
social equality.
The "second best" theory in
economics roughly states that if
fewer than all the requirements
necessary to produce the opti
mal condition are available, at
tempting to fulfill as many opti
mality requirements as possible
does not necessarily yield the
best alternative solution. In
stead, a complete redefinition of
objectives may be preferable.
Some 21 years after Brown vs.
Board of Education events in
Boston reiterate the difficulty in
pursuing the optimal, "first
best" goal of reshaping per
verted racial attitudes. While
economic policies such as affir
mative action may mitigate in
equities of a racially-aligned dis
tribution of wealth and income,
what sanctions, legal or societal,
exist to ameliorate the animosity
of that white man who punched
Carter on the Washington, D.C. <
bus?
Though Carter may have to
stomach prejudice for some
time, the economic opportunity
which affirmative action and
other income redistribution
schemes offer him, particularly
as a black from Stanford, will af
ford him political efficacy long
before acquiring the social
legitimacy which he illustrates
does not exist for blacks in
America.
But assessing progress toward
racial equality strictly through
changes in individual racial
proclivities, strictly by "first
best" criteria, assures prolonged
disappointment and frustration
because the intractable racism of
many will abate only with their
own death.
