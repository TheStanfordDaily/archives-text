## TEXTBOOK ROYALTIE$ Prof publications produce pretty pennies 
### KATHRYN MA 
Take a close look at that list of
required reading in your class
syllabus. Do any of those names
look familiar? One of them
might, since there's a good
chance that one of those books
was written by your professor.
Many Stanford professors as
sign their own books, often leav
ing students to speculate on how
a professor justifies — or
rationalizes — such a practice.
Some may dismiss it as a sign of
immodesty, while others chalk it
up to pure, unadulterated greed.
But the professors who assign
their own texts insist they aren't
merely trying to squeeze royal
ties out of exploited students,
and that something must be
known both about the book as
signed and the royalties it draws
before judgement can be passed.
Probably the best known
example of classes using the pro
fessors' own book is that of
Human Biology 10, "Human
Sexuality," taught by Assoc.
Psychiatry Prof. Herant Katch
adourian and Psychiatry Prof.
Donald Lunde.
Although students supple
ment their incomes every year by
buying hundreds of copies of
their jointly authored Funda
mentals of Human Sexuality,
the two say that potential royal
ties never entered into their con
sideration.
A need
"When we started teaching
this course, there were no

textbooks to speak of," Katch
adourian explains. "We got into
writing the text because there
was a need." Although several
new books in the field have ap
peared subsequently, he has al
ways modestly felt that theirs
was the best one available,
Katchadourian notes.
Economics Prof. George Bach
speaks with equal frankness
about his Economics 1 textbook.
"I like it,"he says. "1 take teach
ing very seriously, and the in
formation 1 consider most im
portant, 1 put in my book."
Several teachers agree that the
main advantage of using their
own books is that it gives them
and their students more freedom
in class.
"Lectures are for building up
ideas on the blackboard as you
go along, which you can't get
from the printed page," says
Electrical Engineering Prof.
Ralph Smith.
By using his own book to exp
lain the general theory, Smith
argues, he leaves his class free
"for zeroing in on particularly
difficult points."
Suspicious minds
Not all professors who assign
their own books are eager to do
so. History Prof. Gordon Wright,
who recommended a book of his
for his course, "Modern France,"
this quarter, says, "1 would be
very glad to avoid using my own
book in my own class. There is
the suspicion that I am just mak
ing money, and the danger of re

peating myself."
Wright has been known to
solve one problem in a unique
way: while teaching at the
Stanford-In-Britain campus at
Cliveden, Wright treated each of
his students to beer at the local
pub until they had used up their
credit against his forthcoming
royalties.
But there is a real danger,
some professors fear, of under

exposure to different opinions.
History Prof. John Johnson
comments, "I object, not because
of the royalties, but because the
ideas I've discussed in my books
come through in my lectures."
He says he feels it is important to
present a broad view and many
arguments, so the student may
evaluate the issue himself.
But whether it is right or
wrong for a professor to assign

his own books, most academics
deny that there is any money to
be made through the practice.
And, indeed, a little quick
arithmetic shows that the royal
ties earned from a Stanford class
offer only a limited source of in
come.
A paperback book, for in
stance, brings a professor about
25 cents per book. If the profes
sor has a class of 300 students,
royalties are about $75.
About a third may go for taxes,
and what left is a whopping total
of $50 — hardly worth the black
looks and behind-dorm-doors
grumbling.
A book, then, must be chosen
for other than monetary reasons.
It must have some special appeal
for both student and teacher.
Psychology Prof. Daryl Bern says
his is "a specialty book," and
that he uses it because "it intro
duces me as a person," since his
style of writing and his sense of
humor are reflected throughout
the book, which becomes a
glimpse at his character, as well
as at his ideas. Bern describes it
as a "social psychological
phenomenon."
Professional prejudice?
The question then becomes
not one of ethics, but perhaps
one of prejudice. "If we're guilty
of anything, it's the lack of objec
tivity about our own stuff," ad
mits Bach.
One wonders if a professor
who sees his book as a "social

phenomenon" is totally un
biased. The test, therefore, is not
to see how popular it is at Stan
ford, but how it was received
elsewhere.
Bach's book, now translated
into seven different languages,
has sold over a million copies.
Katchadourian and Lunde are
read in several hundred other in
stitutions and Johnson's Politi
cal Changes in Latin America

won the coveted Bolton Prize of
the American Historical Associ
ation. Bern's book sells 20,000
copies a year.
Overall royalties may amount
to as much as $100,000 per year
for some professors, but Bern
comments that "the amount of
money off Stanford students is
trivial.
"Most of us." he adds, "think
that the book we wrote is the best
one around."

MILLION SELLER — Economics Prof. George Bach uses his book
in his class because he likes it. Apparently, so do many others. His
Econ 1 text has been translated into seven different languages and
has sold over a million copies.


PHENOMENAL —Psychology Prof. Darvl Bern claims that many
professors that assign their own books do so because they think
their particular text is the best one around. Bern even goes so far as
to claim his is a 'social psychological phenomenon.'
