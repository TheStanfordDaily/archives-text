# Bonds receive top rating

### ALEXANDER LEFF 
Stanford has received an AAA credit
rating — the highest possible — on its
outstanding tax-exempt bonds.
Credit ratings are decided on the
basis of whether institutions have the
capacity to pay hack the money they
borrow. Director of Finance Rodney
Adams said the University achieved
its high rating because "relative to
other schools, Stanford is in excellent
financial shape."
The AAA credit rating should have a
positive effect for both the holders of
Stanford tax-exempt bonds, first is
sued in Series A one year ago, and for

the University on its upcoming Series
B bond sale, currently scheduled for
Feb. 18.
Adams said, "We have been ex
tremely pleased at the number of par
ties interested in purchasing our new
bonds."
This second series will combine
short and long-term liabilities totaling
$18.1 million, offered through the
California Educational Facilities Au
thority (CEFA).
'Legalistic device'
The CEFA, created by the state legis
lature in 1974, is a "legalistic device"
explained Allen, "to allow private

universities to borrow on a tax-exempt
basis ... neither state nor federal au
thorities guarantee the bonds, they are
issued under the auspices of the CEFA
but are backed by our endowment."
When an institution borrows on a
tax-exempt basis, (in other words, able
to issue bonds whose returns to their
holders are non-taxable,) it is able to
pay lower rates on the money bor
rowed. Projects were financed previ
ously by higher interest bank loans,
the University endowment and donor
gifts.
Stanford was the first institution
to utilize the CEFA early last year, of
fering a $16.9 million tax-exempt
Series A issue at 7.1 percent. "There
was a clear element of pioneering in
this," said Allen. "We were the first to
get into the water and start swim
ming."
Refinancing
Last year's Series A issue met a good
market and the borrowed money was
used to help refinance Escondido Vil
lage student housing, the Central Food
Service building, general plant im
provements and the first phase of the
Hospital's expansion.
Series B bonds, which are to be sold
in $5000 denominations through most
banks and stockbrokers, will be used to
finance the Seeley Mudd Chemistry
Building, the Sherman Fairchild
Center for Neurosciences, under
graduate housing and a new IBM .370/
168 computer.
Savings in interest alone from the
last issue and the planned borrowing
will exceed $1 million annually, the
University estimated.

California Educational Facilities Au
thority (CEFA).
'Legalistic device'
The CEFA, created by the state legis
lature in 1974, is a "legalistic device"
explained Allen, "to allow private

universities to borrow on a tax-exempt
basis ... neither state nor federal au
thorities guarantee the bonds, they are
issued under the auspices of the CEFA
but are backed by our endowment."
When an institution borrows on a
tax-exempt basis, (in other words, able
to issue bonds whose returns to their
holders are non-taxable,) it is able to
pay lower rates on the money bor
rowed. Projects were financed previ
ously by higher interest bank loans,
the University endowment and donor
gifts.
Stanford was the first institution
to utilize the CEFA early last year, of
fering a $16.9 million tax-exempt
Series A issue at 7.1 percent. "There
was a clear element of pioneering in
this," said Allen. "We were the first to
get into the water and start swim
ming."
Refinancing
Last year's Series A issue met a good
market and the borrowed money was
used to help refinance Escondido Vil
lage student housing, the Central Food
Service building, general plant im
provements and the first phase of the
Hospital's expansion.
Series B bonds, which are to be sold
in $5000 denominations through most
banks and stockbrokers, will be used to
finance the Seeley Mudd Chemistry
Building, the Sherman Fairchild
Center for Neurosciences, under
graduate housing and a new IBM .370/
168 computer.
Savings in interest alone from the
last issue and the planned borrowing
will exceed $1 million annually, the
University estimated.
Stanford has received an AAA credit
rating — the highest possible — on its
outstanding tax-exempt bonds.
Credit ratings are decided on the
basis of whether institutions have the
capacity to pay hack the money they
borrow. Director of Finance Rodney
Adams said the University achieved
its high rating because "relative to
other schools, Stanford is in excellent
financial shape."
The AAA credit rating should have a
positive effect for both the holders of
Stanford tax-exempt bonds, first is
sued in Series A one year ago, and for

the University on its upcoming Series
B bond sale, currently scheduled for
Feb. 18.
Adams said, "We have been ex
tremely pleased at the number of par
ties interested in purchasing our new
bonds."
This second series will combine
short and long-term liabilities totaling
$18.1 million, offered through the
California Educational Facilities Au
thority (CEFA).
