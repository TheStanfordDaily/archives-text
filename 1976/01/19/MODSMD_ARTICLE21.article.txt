# Selective Service waivers as "18" registration halts
## 
### PERRY SIMON 
The United States Army's
Selective Service system is pre
sently in a state of limbo, and
may undergo major changes
leading to its eventual dismantl
ing.
The present dilemma facing
the Selective Service was in
itiated by a Presidential procla
mation issued April 1, 1975,
which immediately halted day
to-day registration of young men
turning 18 years old. No indi
viduals have been registered by
the draft board since that date.
The April 1 proclamation
stated that the traditional regist
ration system would be replaced
by a one-day "mass registration"
of all young men having turned
18 within a specified time
period. The actual date of this

nation-wide registration day has
not yet been set. though it is ex
pected to occur early this year.
"We are all waiting for a sec
ond presidential proclamation
setting the day for the new mass
registration," explained Dorothy
Tompkins, a staff worker at San
Francisco's Selective Service
board. "Since the law still re
quires all 18 year-olds to register
for the draft, we have been advis
ing prospective registrants that
the present state of affairs is only
temporary, and they should
watch their local television and
radio stations and newspapers as
to what date the mass registra
tion will occur. The date will be
well-publicized."
Volunteers only
Prior to the April 1 proclama
tion, all males were required to
register within the 60 day period
surrounding their 18th birthday.
However, according to
Tompkins, this procedure had
been somewhat purposeless,
since the Army has relied solely
on volunteers and recruits over
the last three years.
"We have not had any induc
tions since 1972," she said, "al
though we did have a lottery last

year, and the files of those indi
viduals having the first 95 lot
tery numbers were processed.
But none were called for physi
cals. and the induction process
was never carried through."
Since April 11, the Selective
Service system has been waiting
for some action by the President
or Congress to resolve the
standstill.
Ruby Seito, a staff worker at
San Jose's draft board, described
the change in her office's daily
routine. "Since registration has
been discontinued, we have
been devoting all of our efforts
toward the execution of Presi
dent Ford's amnesty program, as
well as the usual administrative
responsibilities and correspon
dences not related to draft regist
ration."
Reduced staff
Once the proposed revision of
the registration system takes ef
fect, Tompkins predicts that "a
definite reduction in the Selec
tive Service staff size can be ex
pected."
The motives behind the regist
ration changes are unclear, and
most people associated with the
Selective Service system are re

luctant to hazard guesses about
the President's intentions.
One motive suggested is that
the new system would be more
administratively efficient. How
ever, in pointing out the lack of
inductions since 1972,
Tompkins suggested that
perhaps the President and Con
gress believe the fully volunteer
army has been so successful that
the selective service system is no
longer necessarv.
