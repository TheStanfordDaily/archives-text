# Busing disputed in 'flight' issue
## 
### MARC STRASSMAN 
Court-ordered school busing
does not lead to massive "white
flight" from city to suburbs, ac
cording to Thomas F. Pettigrew,
a fellow at the Stanford Center
for Advanced Study in the Be
havioral Sciences.
In an 20,000-word essay to be
published in the February issue
of the Harvard Educational Re
view, Pettigrew contradicts the
much-publicized claims of
James R. Coleman, sociologist at
the University of Chcago.
In questioning Coleman's
central finding — that busing
black children for purposes of
achieving racial balance causes
"white flight" — he said:
—Coleman ignored existing
trends in population movement
unrelated to busing;
—he uses an inappropriate
unit of analysis, the district,
rather than school, level;
—reports from the 10 "largest
cities" by a New York Times re
porter did not support his
claims;
—Coleman used exaggerated
hypothetical figures, leading to
improbable results, and
Pettigrew said that the rela
tionship between Colemn's re
search and his political posi
tions is "tenuous at best and
non-existent at worst."
