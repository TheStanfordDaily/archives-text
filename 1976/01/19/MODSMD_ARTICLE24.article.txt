# Chico drops women cagers
## 
### JEFF WAHBA 
The women's basketball team
showing the effects of injuries,
youth, and lack of conditioning,
collapsed against Chico State
76-48 at Maples Pavilion Satur
day.
In front of a crowd of 50, Stan
ford (1-2) came within two
points early in the second half
but quickly lost its momentum
as Chico rolled to an easy win.
Reasons for the demise are var
ied:
"We just started not setting up
our offense and defense. We
mentally stopped thinking,"
guard Nancy Lo'vvold com
mented.
'Poor execution'
Card coach Cay Cobrun stated,
"it was a combination of them
getting hot from the outside and
us not executing well."
"They are a lot more ex
perienced and we weren't play
ing together as a team," Stan
ford's high scorer Sukie Jackson
added.
The surprise of the game prob
ably was not Chico's romp in the
second half though, but that
Stanford was able to keep it close
for that long. Chico. probably the
strongest team in Northern
California, came in with an un

defeated record and a squad
made up entirely of returning
players matched against a team
made up of almost totally of
freshman and sophomores.
Already fighting the odds,
"we had to treat physically 10 of
our eligible 12 players before the
game," Coburn stated. Injuries
range from a broken foot to a
possible broken nose.
'Not in shape'
"Also some of our players
aren't in as good a shape as they
could be," CoburA commented.
"They are getting tired in the
second half of our games, though
against Chico 1 was pleased by
the performance of center Mag
gie Nelson who showed more
stamina than in past games."
Statistics-wise it was a typical
Stanford game. Jackson and Nel
son led the attack with 14 and 12
points respectively. Stanford
continued to outrebound its op
position, gathering 43 rebounds
to Chico's 41.
"We did lack outside shots
though," Coburn said. "We had
planned to have our guards
shoot a lot and use our height
advantage on the boards. We just
weren't putting up the outside
shots though, so Chico was able
to block up the inside."

This week shou Id test whether
the women have the energy to
bounce back, as they play three ,
games within five days includ
ing an encounter against
California after the men's contest 1
on Saturday. i

players matched against a team
made up of almost totally of
freshman and sophomores.
Already fighting the odds,
"we had to treat physically 10 of
our eligible 12 players before the
game," Coburn stated. Injuries
range from a broken foot to a
possible broken nose.
'Not in shape'
"Also some of our players
aren't in as good a shape as they
could be," CoburA commented.
"They are getting tired in the
second half of our games, though
against Chico 1 was pleased by
the performance of center Mag
gie Nelson who showed more
stamina than in past games."
Statistics-wise it was a typical
Stanford game. Jackson and Nel
son led the attack with 14 and 12
points respectively. Stanford
continued to outrebound its op
position, gathering 43 rebounds
to Chico's 41.
"We did lack outside shots
though," Coburn said. "We had
planned to have our guards
shoot a lot and use our height
advantage on the boards. We just
weren't putting up the outside
shots though, so Chico was able
to block up the inside."

This week shou Id test whether
the women have the energy to
bounce back, as they play three ,
games within five days includ
ing an encounter against
California after the men's contest 1
on Saturday. i
The women's basketball team
showing the effects of injuries,
youth, and lack of conditioning,
collapsed against Chico State
76-48 at Maples Pavilion Satur
day.
In front of a crowd of 50, Stan
ford (1-2) came within two
points early in the second half
but quickly lost its momentum
as Chico rolled to an easy win.
Reasons for the demise are var
ied:
"We just started not setting up
our offense and defense. We
mentally stopped thinking,"
guard Nancy Lo'vvold com
mented.
'Poor execution'
Card coach Cay Cobrun stated,
"it was a combination of them
getting hot from the outside and
us not executing well."
"They are a lot more ex
perienced and we weren't play
ing together as a team," Stan
ford's high scorer Sukie Jackson
added.
The surprise of the game prob
ably was not Chico's romp in the
second half though, but that
Stanford was able to keep it close
for that long. Chico. probably the
strongest team in Northern
California, came in with an un

defeated record and a squad
made up entirely of returning
players matched against a team
made up of almost totally of
freshman and sophomores.
