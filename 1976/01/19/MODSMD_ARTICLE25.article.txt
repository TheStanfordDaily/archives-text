# Swimmers win dual meet
## 
### CHRIS KAMEL 
Even world record holder Tim
Shaw could not overturn Stan
ford's men's varsity swimmers
Saturday in the Cards' double
dual meet against Long Beach
State and Utah. Shaw did win
three events but it wasn't enough
to beat a Cardinal squad, that the
Ail-American termed, "very
powerful overall."
And powerful they were. Stan
ford downed Long Beach State
and Utah, 78-35 and 94-19, re
spectively. Shaw's 100-yard free
clocking of 9:29.4 was a new de-
Guerre Pool record, eclipsing the
old 1974 mark of 9:33.8 by Rick
Demont of Washington. The
former high school All -
American also took the 200 back
and 500-yard free in 1:58.7 and
4:37.4.
"I was pleased with my 200

back showing but I am still slow
in my times," hesaid. According
to Shaw, waterpolo has slowed
his performance, which usually
peaks around the end of Feb
ruary.
The Cards were never far be
hind Shaw, as sophomore Bill
Chao finished second in both the
500-yard free and 1000.
Chao shaved two and one-half
seconds off his previous lifetime
best in the 500.
Sprinter Dave Fairbank and
breaststroker John Hencken
paced the Cards. Fairbank's first
place time of 20.6 in the 50-yard
free tied his own deGuerre Pool
record,while his46.o clocking in
the 100-yard free gave him his
second first place finish of the
day. Hencken took the 200-yard
breast and intermediate events
in2:os.9and 1:57.1. The4oo free

relay contingent was not to be
left out of the good times, as it
chalked up a winning time of
3:05.6. The speedy last relay legs
of John Powell, 45.9, and Fair
bank, 45.5, led to the fastest relay
time in the country.
Utah's only hope to stay with
the Cardinals turned out to be a
false one. Jeff Rolan, NCAA
champion in the 100-yard fly
and scorer in both the 50 and
100-yard free, did not add much
to a Utah attack which did not
get a first place all day. Rolan
only captured a second in the 50
free and third in the 100 free in
21.2 and 47.4, respectively. Ac
cording to the junior from Tus
tin, he is ahead of last year's
times although he was not
pleased with his showings in the
meet.
Stanford's weekend started
with the Stanford Relays the
previous day. The men's squad
was once again led by Ail-
American Hencken's 200 breast
victory and Fairbank's 50 and
100 free victories but had a scare
from California. The Bears led an
opposing contingent of Surbur
ban Swim Club, Santa Clara
Swim Club and UC Davis.
The women's team, which
hosts the Stanford Invitational
Championships this coming
weekend, met the tough opposi
tion of Santa Clara Swim Club
and subsequently was defeated.
"Santa Clara has always had a
strong women's squad. We'll be
working hard these next two
weeks for our match up against
them at the end of January,"
head coach Jim Gaughran said.
