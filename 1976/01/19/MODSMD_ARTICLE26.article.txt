## Stanford, DiBiaso get first Pac-8 win Cards beat SC, fall to Bruins 
### PAUL BAUMAN 
LOS ANGELES — The Stan
ford Cardinals reputedly have
the least talent of any team in the
Pacific Eight, or close to it. If so,
you have to wonder after last
weekend where the Cards would
be with more experienced
players of any higher caliber.
Stanford came within one
basket, or a few seconds to be
more accurate, of pulling off a
"Maples Miracle," Southern
Style, as the Cards lost to UCLA
68-67, Friday night and then
upset USC, 86-75, Saturday
evening.
Looking at the situation objec
tively last Friday, Stanford
needed a trip to Los Angeles
about as much as its students
need another tuition increase.
The Cards were entering UCLA's
Pauley Pavilion, not exactly a
sanctuary for opposing teams,
with a seven-game losing streak.
USC, before dropping its first
three Pac-8 games, won 11 of its
12 non-conference games and
achieved a number-15 national
ranking. Furthermore, Stanford
was winless on the road this sea
son.
'Lack of desire'
Yet there was Stanford coach
Dick Dißiaso lauding his team's
effort after the UCLA game, and
Bruin coach Gene Bartow comp
laining about his team's "obvi
ous lack of desire." Dißiaso got
his first Pac-8 win the following
night, as the Cards played in
tensely from beginning to end in

handing the Pac-8 cellar to USC.
"This was the most successful
L.A. trip I've ever been on," said
Stanford captain Ed Schweitzer.
"This was a good time to get it —
my senior year." Stanford de
feated USC in Los Angeles in
1973, but Schweitzer was a
freshman on the junior varsity at
the time.
USC seems to have everything
it needs to win. The Trojans are
very strong on the boards, and
they have good scoring potential
and experienced reserves.
So what was USC's problem
against Stanford? Or were the
Cards just that good? Both.
First of all, the Trojans played
defense only as an afterthought.
Stanford repeatedly penetrated
USC's man-to-man defense to
score inside. Actually, the Tro
jans seemed to be using an "es
cort" system of defense in which
they simply accompanied Stan
ford players to the basket.
"Our problem from the begin
ning of this season has been to
stop other teams," said USC
coach Bob Boyd, referring to a
semi-important aspect of win
ning basketball. "We look like
we're working at defense, but we
aren't very good at it. I don't
think you beat many teams if
they score in the 80s. I don't
think we can."
Secondly, USC quickly pro
ceeded to negate its rebounding
strength as 6-foot-8 forward Greg
White and 6-10 center Steve
Malovic got into early foul trou
ble. Malovic sat out only a total
of six minutes and grabbed a
game-high 15 rebounds, but
scored only five points. The
Cards played a two-three zone
defense throughout the game
specifically to counteract what
Dißiaso termed "a strong inside
game on USC's part."
But even if USC had played
better defense, rebounded better
and had the use of 6-6 "guard"

Earl Evans, out with a strained
achilles tendon, the Trojans still
might not have won. The Cards,
particularly George Schader,
Mike Bratz and Jeff McHugh, just
played out of their minds.
Schader played his best game
of the year, scoring 25 points and
grabbing 14 rebounds against
USC forward Bob Trowbridge,
considered a fine defensive
player.
"I take a lot of pride in my de
fense," Trowbridge said. "1
played a lousy game. Schader
did one hell of a job. That embar
rasses me."
Bratz quietly scored 18 points
on six of nine shots from the
floor and six of seven from the
line. The 6-2 guard's scoring,
playmaking, shot-selection and
defense have been outstanding
all year.
McHugh played 24 minutes
coming off the bench and scored
seven points in the first half to
help give the Cards a 44-36
halftime lead.
Stanford led for all but the first
two minutes of the game. SC
closed to within one at 33-32
with 3:21 remaining in the first
half, but trailed by 10-15 points
for most of the second half.
The Cards might have routed

USC if not for the performance of
Trojan guard Mark Wulfemeyer.
The freshman from Fullerton
scored 19 points in 27 minutes of
action, hitting eight of 11 from
the field, all but one from long
distances. Wulfemeyer holds the
California career prep scoring
record and has the best outside
shot this side of Rick Berry. Wul
femeyer would be having a bad
night if some of his shots were to
hit the rim before going in.
Surrendered lead
Friday against UCLA, Stan
ford surrendered an 11-10 lead
with five and one half minutes
gone in the first half and then
played from behind until the
end. But the Cards never gave
up, which might have been
tempting when UCLA led 68-63
with 1:11 left in the game.
The Bruins almost uncharac
teristically choked the game
away in the last minute of play.
Whenever UCLA had the ball,
Stanford had to foul to quickly
regain possession. First Andre
McCarter, who scored a career
high 26 points, shot 1-1 from the
line, missing the first shot and
therefore relinquishing the ball.
Bratz then hit a short jumper to
make it 68-65. This time Stan
ford fouled UCLA's Rich
Washington, who also missed
his first free throw.
Stanford called its last timeout
with 0:15 remaining and Wolfe
Perry hit the biggest basket of the
year for the Cards from 16 feet
with 0:11 left. The score: UCLA

68, Stanford 67. With five sec
onds left in the game, Perry
fouled Gavin Smith of UCLA,
who also graciously missed his
first freethrow. The Cards got the
rebound, but Jay Carter had just
dribbled past the midcourt line
as time ran out. He couldn't even
get off a shot.
If it's any consolation to Stan
ford fans, only one other team
has come within one point of
beating UCLA at home during its
current 93-game winning streak
there. Maryland lost to UCLA at
Pauley. 65-64, in 1973.
Cardinal Notes: The Los
Angeles Times received a few
calls asking if the 54-26 Stanford
rebounding edge over UCLA
was a typo .... The Cards were
victim number 92 for the Bruins
at Pauley Pavilion since
1970 ... . The talk at halftime in
Pauley was how soon first-year
UCLA coach Gene Bartow would
get his walking papers .... The
Wizard of Westwood, former
UCLA boss John Wooden was in
the crowd, but he wouldn't talk
about this year's team . . . .
UCLA football coach, Dick Ver
meil isn't resting after the
Bruins' Rose Bowl victory, he
was seen escorting several re
cruits around the Pauley court at
halftime .... The newest
member of the USC coaching
staff is a familiar face for Stan
ford fans — Bub Bowling ... He
helped draw the technical.
