Gymnasts lose
The Stanford gymnastics
squad, although showing an im
provement over last weekend's
performance, still narrowly lost
to Cal State-Northridge 191.65 to
190.35 Saturday night in the En
cina gym.
The extra week of practice
showed up in the performances
of both Ted Marcy and Bob Farb.
March, a two-time NCAA side
horse champion, won his spe
ciality with a score of 9.6.
Perhaps unduly disparaging last
week's score of 9.5, March com
mented, "This week's perfor
mance was better than last
week's for sure. (Last week's per
formance) couldn't have been
much worse and still hit."
Bob Farb also had a good meet,
taking all-around honors. Farb

looked cleaner and scored better
than last week. "He looked
pretty good for this early in the
season," teammate Marcy said.
Stanford has now lost to Cal
State-Northridge twice this sea
son, but an improvement was
noticeable in Saturday's contest.
"We had a little more polish,"
said March, "a little more ex
perience."
Stanford's next meet will be
Jan. 30 against Washington.
