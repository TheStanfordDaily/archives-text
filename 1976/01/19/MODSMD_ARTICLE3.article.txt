# Radical change necessary
## Marcuse urges social action 
### JANICE BRESSLER 
Warning that the rise of a neo-fascist
regime is possible, celebrated
philosopher and social critic Herbert
Marcuse Thursday night called for a
unification of "those who believe in
change."
"It is not yet too late." said Marcuse,
"but it may soon be too late."
The lead speaker in a panel discus
sion on radical social change in
America, Marcuse, whose works were
widely quoted by the student left of the
19605, drew an overflow crowd of
about 700 people to Cubberley Au
ditorium. The discussion marked the
opening of Disorientation Week, a
series of films, workshops and speak
ers sponsored by the Alliance for Radi
cal Change.
"There are still a hell of a lot of
people who don't want change," said
the 78-year-old radical theorist. "I
don't speak to them. I address those
who believe this society is becoming
more and more repressive, that it dis
torts our needs and emotions."
Echoing the themes of one of his best
known works. One Dimensional Man.
Marcuse charged that contemporary
industrial society represses other pos
sible ways of life and "manipulates"
our values and choices.
The manipulators
Such manipulation is possible, he
said, because the mass of Americans
still "identify" with their man
ipulators— a ruling class composed of
the top echelons of business, govern
ment and the military.
"The root of this identification is
that capitalism still delivers the
goods," Marcuse said.
Marcuse asserted that the bulk of
Americans live as well, materially,
today as they ever have. "There is no
crisis of capitalism." he said, challeng
ing the claim of some radical
economists that capitalism is on the
decline. That one can read of such a
crisis daily in the newspaper is, smiled
Marcuse, "alone enough to make one
suspicious."
He insisted, however, that there is
evidence of change in America.
Though the "material base" of
capitalism remains relatively stable,
"the basic values of capitalism are be
ginning to collapse. The Puritan work
ethic is disintegrating, not only among
intellectuals, but among large num
bers of the middle class."
Attributing this "growing aware
ness that the whole system is intolera
ble" to the student movement of the
19605. Marcuse said that though stu
dent activism has died down, "the
promise of the 19605, the promise of
radical change" is alive.
The disintegration of the work ethic
is a real threat to the system, he said,

adding the caveat: the system recog
nizes this threat and seeks to repress it.
Marcuse urged the strategy of the
New Left be reformulated, with heed
paid to the mistakes of last decade's
revolutionaries. Those mistakes were,
he said, a lack of unity and an expecta
tion of instant success.
All the panelists agreed that work
towards "the revolution" must begin

"wherever you are." Students can
start, suggested Marcuse, with protest
of the "manipulative" practices of the
University itself. "To say that students
are powerless is nonsense and Estab
lishment propaganda," said Marcuse.
'Preaching passivism'
Responding to Marcuse's assertion
that the primary realm of student ac

tivism is the University, an irate Mar
xist in the audience accused Marcuse
of "preaching passivism." The revolu
tion, said the Marxist, must begin with
the enlightenment of the working
class.
Another angry voice in the audience
attacked the panel for proposing "the
ripping up" of society. Answered dis
cussion moderator Charles Drekmeier,
professor of political science here,
"We do not support terrorism of any
kind .... This discussion is not about
ripping up anything, it's about being
ripped off."
One question raised but never
clearly answered by the panel was
what explicit institutional and societal
changes would follow the revolution.
The closest Marcuse came to an ans
wer was his statement that "a revolu
tion of the 20th century, in contrast to
prior revolutions in history, will be a
transformation not only of economic
and political institutions, but of the
whole quality of life and of the moral
system of society."

bers of the middle class."
Attributing this "growing aware
ness that the whole system is intolera
ble" to the student movement of the
19605. Marcuse said that though stu
dent activism has died down, "the
promise of the 19605, the promise of
radical change" is alive.
The disintegration of the work ethic
is a real threat to the system, he said,

adding the caveat: the system recog
nizes this threat and seeks to repress it.
Marcuse urged the strategy of the
New Left be reformulated, with heed
paid to the mistakes of last decade's
revolutionaries. Those mistakes were,
he said, a lack of unity and an expecta
tion of instant success.
All the panelists agreed that work
towards "the revolution" must begin

"wherever you are." Students can
start, suggested Marcuse, with protest
of the "manipulative" practices of the
University itself. "To say that students
are powerless is nonsense and Estab
lishment propaganda," said Marcuse.
'Preaching passivism'
Responding to Marcuse's assertion
that the primary realm of student ac

tivism is the University, an irate Mar
xist in the audience accused Marcuse
of "preaching passivism." The revolu
tion, said the Marxist, must begin with
the enlightenment of the working
class.
Another angry voice in the audience
attacked the panel for proposing "the
ripping up" of society. Answered dis
cussion moderator Charles Drekmeier,
professor of political science here,
"We do not support terrorism of any
kind .... This discussion is not about
ripping up anything, it's about being
ripped off."
One question raised but never
clearly answered by the panel was
what explicit institutional and societal
changes would follow the revolution.
The closest Marcuse came to an ans
wer was his statement that "a revolu
tion of the 20th century, in contrast to
prior revolutions in history, will be a
transformation not only of economic
and political institutions, but of the
whole quality of life and of the moral
system of society."
Warning that the rise of a neo-fascist
regime is possible, celebrated
philosopher and social critic Herbert
Marcuse Thursday night called for a
unification of "those who believe in
change."
"It is not yet too late." said Marcuse,
"but it may soon be too late."
The lead speaker in a panel discus
sion on radical social change in
America, Marcuse, whose works were
widely quoted by the student left of the
19605, drew an overflow crowd of
about 700 people to Cubberley Au
ditorium. The discussion marked the
opening of Disorientation Week, a
series of films, workshops and speak
ers sponsored by the Alliance for Radi
cal Change.
"There are still a hell of a lot of
people who don't want change," said
the 78-year-old radical theorist. "I
don't speak to them. I address those
who believe this society is becoming
more and more repressive, that it dis
torts our needs and emotions."
Echoing the themes of one of his best
known works. One Dimensional Man.
Marcuse charged that contemporary
industrial society represses other pos
sible ways of life and "manipulates"
our values and choices.
The manipulators
Such manipulation is possible, he
said, because the mass of Americans
still "identify" with their man
ipulators— a ruling class composed of
the top echelons of business, govern
ment and the military.
"The root of this identification is
that capitalism still delivers the
goods," Marcuse said.
Marcuse asserted that the bulk of
Americans live as well, materially,
today as they ever have. "There is no
crisis of capitalism." he said, challeng
ing the claim of some radical
economists that capitalism is on the
decline. That one can read of such a
crisis daily in the newspaper is, smiled
Marcuse, "alone enough to make one
suspicious."
He insisted, however, that there is
evidence of change in America.
Though the "material base" of
capitalism remains relatively stable,
"the basic values of capitalism are be
ginning to collapse. The Puritan work
ethic is disintegrating, not only among
intellectuals, but among large num
bers of the middle class."
