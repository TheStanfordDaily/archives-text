# Trotters do magic
## 
### JEFF PARIETTI 
Walking up to Maples
Pavilion last Friday night one
would have thought Stanford
was playing UCLA in basket
ball. About 500 people waited
in line for their will-call tic
kets while about the same
number stood patiently hop
ing to buy some of the few
remaining tickets being of
fered for sale.
But Stanford was on the
road this night and the fans
had not really come to see a
basketball game, but to view a
show, though a basketball
one at that. It was an evening
with the Harlem Globetrot
ters, on the first stop of a Bay
Area tour.
Sponsored by ASSU Spe
cial Events as a club benefit,
the exhibition drew about
7000 spectators, mainly con
sisting of children who
hauled their parents along.
Instead of Stanford's Dou
ble Strength Boys, Schader
and Schweitzer, the kids
came to watch Meadowlark
Lemon, Curly Neal, Bobby Joe
Mason and company.
The Globetrotters eventu
ally defeated their opponent,
the New Jersey Reds 113-99,
but no one was concerned
with the score.
The contest began about 30
minutes late, but the fans
didn't mind. One little future
superstar around four years
old dribbled an imaginary
basketball up court and shot a
fantasized lay-up during the
wait.
Three boys passed around a
miniature softball-sized red,
white and blue basketball
which the souvenir stands
hawked. Other kids proudly
waved Harlem Globetrotter
pennants while some bor
rowed from the Stanford

Flick's favorite pasttime by
propelling paper airplanes
onto the court.
The air soon filled with the
familiar strains of "Sweet
Georgia Brown," the Globet
rotter theme song. The
team entered with each
player spinning a basketball
on one finger. Dressed in blue
warm-ups with red and white
stripes down the legs, the
Trotters formed their warmup
circle, hamming and hotdog
ging the basketball around
the circle. The crowd re
sponded by clapping in un
ison to the music.
The fans applauded every

time a Trotter sunk a practice
shot and groaned whenever
one was missed. The New
Jersey Reds also were warm
ing up, but all eyes were fro
zen on the Globetrotters.
With good reason too, as
Meadowlark, wearing an Ace
bandage on one knee, casu
ally banked in a looping hook
from mid-court. The Kojak of
basketball, curly Neal, wear
ing a red, white and blue
elbow band on each arm,
answered by tossing in a high
arcing swisher from the
center jump circle.
Once the contest got un
derway, the spectators were

treated to the standard menu
of Globetrotter tricks and
stunts. They opened with
their famous weave which re
sulted in a dunk shot.
Team comic Meadowlark
Lemon could be heard
everywhere. Once he fol
lowed a girl about five years
old who was passing by.
"Come here, little girl," said
Meadowlark. But the little
girl, somewhat embarrassed
by this sudden attention, con
tinued in the direction of the
ladies' room, prompting
Meadowlark to blurt out,
"Well, if you got to go, you
got to go."

Team comic Meadowlark

everywhere. Once he fol

"Come here, little girl," said
Meadowlark. But the little

tinued in the direction of the

Meadowlark to blurt out,

CLOWNING IT UP — Harlem Globetrotter Curley Neal has some fun with his admirers in the
stands at the Trotters' Maples game last Friday evening. The Globetrotters performed the tricks
that they've been using for years and the 7000 fans loved it.
Walking up to Maples
Pavilion last Friday night one
would have thought Stanford
was playing UCLA in basket
ball. About 500 people waited
in line for their will-call tic
kets while about the same
number stood patiently hop
ing to buy some of the few
remaining tickets being of
fered for sale.
But Stanford was on the
road this night and the fans
had not really come to see a
basketball game, but to view a
show, though a basketball
one at that. It was an evening
with the Harlem Globetrot
ters, on the first stop of a Bay
Area tour.
Sponsored by ASSU Spe
cial Events as a club benefit,
the exhibition drew about
7000 spectators, mainly con
sisting of children who
hauled their parents along.
Instead of Stanford's Dou
ble Strength Boys, Schader
and Schweitzer, the kids
came to watch Meadowlark
Lemon, Curly Neal, Bobby Joe
Mason and company.
The Globetrotters eventu
ally defeated their opponent,
the New Jersey Reds 113-99,
but no one was concerned
with the score.
The contest began about 30
minutes late, but the fans
didn't mind. One little future
superstar around four years
old dribbled an imaginary
basketball up court and shot a
fantasized lay-up during the
wait.
Three boys passed around a
miniature softball-sized red,
white and blue basketball
which the souvenir stands
hawked. Other kids proudly
waved Harlem Globetrotter
pennants while some bor
rowed from the Stanford

Flick's favorite pasttime by
propelling paper airplanes
onto the court.
The air soon filled with the
familiar strains of "Sweet
Georgia Brown," the Globet
rotter theme song. The
team entered with each
player spinning a basketball
on one finger. Dressed in blue
warm-ups with red and white
stripes down the legs, the
Trotters formed their warmup
circle, hamming and hotdog
ging the basketball around
the circle. The crowd re
sponded by clapping in un
ison to the music.
The fans applauded every

time a Trotter sunk a practice
shot and groaned whenever
one was missed. The New
Jersey Reds also were warm
ing up, but all eyes were fro
zen on the Globetrotters.
With good reason too, as
Meadowlark, wearing an Ace
bandage on one knee, casu
ally banked in a looping hook
from mid-court. The Kojak of
basketball, curly Neal, wear
ing a red, white and blue
elbow band on each arm,
answered by tossing in a high
arcing swisher from the
center jump circle.

derway, the spectators were
