Lebanon's premier resigns
BEIRUT — Premier Rashid Kararni, Lebanon's
top Moslem officeholder, resigned yesterday after
both sides ignored his latest ceaselire call and esca
lated fighting in the civil war.
"I have to announce that the government has no
more effectiveness. All the doors to peace have
been slammed," the nine-time premier told the na
tion in an emotional broadcast.
"My efforts to find a solution have gone with the
wind," he said.
The 53-year-old millionaire bachelor from
Tripoli said he was passing responsibility for the
country to President Suleiman Franjieh, a Christ
ian, "to take whatever steps he thinks proper."
There was no immediate indication what Fran
jieh would do.
The premier's resignation, as battles intensified
between private armies of right-wing Christians
and the mainly Moslem left-wing backed by Pales
tinian guerrillas, increased fears of partition and a
wider Mideast conflict.
With Palestinians playing a growing role in
Lebanon's struggle, both Syria and Israel have
threatened to come into the country, Syria to pre
vent partition and expulsion of the guerrillas, Israel
to keep Syria out.
Israel bans press reports
JERUSALEM — The Israeli cabinet approved yes
terday a law banning press reports of secret dip
lomatic exchanges between Israel and foreign
states. Israeli editors accused the cabinet of impos
ing "political censorship."
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin introduced the
law, apparently seeking to plug leaks in his cabinet
which led to publication of several recent messages
between Israel and the United States.
The law will take effect if and when it is approved
by the foreign affairs and security committee of
parliament, where it is scheduled for consideration
later this month.
At a cabinet meeting, Rabin suggested adding the
subject of diplomatic exchanges to existing censor
ship regulations.
These laws cover such matters as military affairs,
oil supplies, and Jewish immigration from Com
munist states. Local and foreign newsmen are even
barred, except in special cases, from reporting the
fact that their dispatches have undergone censor
ship.
PLO army units in Lebanon
TEL AVIV — Units of the Palestine Liberation
Army have crossed the border from Syria into
Lebanon over the last few days and are poised to
intervene in the civil war, reliable sources said yes
terday.
An official source said that a Palestinian force
trained in Syria and on "a numerically relatively
small level" had arrived inside Lebanese territory
"in the last few days."
Israel has repeatedly warned it would strongly
react to any outside intervention in the Lebanese
civil war which might endanger the security of the

Jewish state.
Ford offends African leaders
NEW DELHI — President Julius Nyerere of Tan
zania said yesterday a letter President Ford sent to
African leaders about the situation in Angola was
"arrogant and uncalled for."
Nyerere, who Saturday night received the
Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Under
standing, told a news conference Ford had written
to all the African heads of state saying the United
States would press for withdrawal of all South Afri
can troops from Angola on the condition that troops
from Cuba and the Soviet Union were also with
drawn.
The Tanzanian president said Ford's proposal
had helped deadlock the recent Organization of
African Unity meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
There was "serious disagreement" at the meeting
over whether the OAU could demand the with
drawal of South African troops from Angola with
out demanding the withdrawal of troops from Cuba
and the Soviet Union, Nyerere said.
This disagreement, heightened by Ford's letter,
led to the failure of the conference, he said.
Nigeria also had responded angrily to the Ford
letter, calling it "overbearing" and "an insult to the
intelligence of African nations."
Burns supports Ford's tax cut
WASHINGTON — Arthur Burns, Federal Re
serve board chairman, said yesterday he can sup
port "the broad philosophy" of President Ford's
expected budget proposal of a $10 billion tax cut.
He said such support was based on a simultane
ous cut in government expenditures.
"The American people are taxed heavily," he
said. "Our federal government has been growing in
leaps and bounds. Government expenditures at all
levels now account for about 40 percent of the dol
lar value of our nation's production.
"It is high time we cut federal expenditures. It is
high time also that we lighten the tax burden on the
American people."
He said he still was concerned about inflation
and noted that while the inflation rate had been
down it "rose once again in July.
"It was a warning that we must not embark on
new so-called stimulative governmental measures.
If we do that the rate of inflation is likely to acceler
ate and that may bring on another recession, a re
cession that may well be deeper than the one we
just went through. We better watch our step."
Who ordered illegal taps?
NEW YORK — Former President Richard Nixon
appears to have a different recollection than Secret
ary of State Henry Kissinger concerning an FBI
wiretapping operation in 1969, the New York
Times reported yesterday.
In a story from Los Angeles, the paper quoted
sources as saying that Nixon told Morton Halperin
and lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union
on Thursday that it was Kissinger who decided
whose telephones should be tapped in an attempt

to find out who was leaking information to the
press.
Kissingerhas stated that in a meeting on April 25,
1969, attended by him. Nixon, then-FBI director J.
Edgar Hoover and then-Attorney General John
Mitchell, it was Nixon who specifically directed
the electronic surveillance of four persons whose
names had been suggested by Hoover.
Halperin was one of the four persons named at
the meeting and he is suing the former president,
Kissinger, other government officials, the FBI and
the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co., con
tending that wiretaps are illegal.
Sinatra to testify?
WASHINGTON — The Senate intelligence
committee this week is expected to consider cal li ng
Frank Sinatra to testify about the relationship of
President John Kennedy, Judith Campbell Exner
and mobster Sam Giancana.
"1 think the committee will be asked when it
meets" to consider calling Sinatra as a witness, a
committee source said yesterday. The panel is
scheduled to meet tomorrow.
Exner has said Sinatra introduced her to Ken
nedy and to Giancana and John Rosselli, another
underworld figure.
She said in a 10-page book outline released by a
literary agent that she had an affair with Kennedy in
the early 1960s and personal relationships with
Giancana and Rosselli.
The Central Intelligence Agency enlisted Gian
cana and Rosselli in an effort to kill Cuban Premier
Fidel Castro. The Senate panel uncovered Exner's
relationship with Kennedy in trying to determine if
Kennedy knew about the Castro assassination plot.
It concluded he did not learn of it through Exner.
Pittsburgh wins Super Bowl X
MIAMI — Roy Gerela kicked two fourth-quarter
field goals, then Terry Bradshaw hit Lynn Swann
on a magnificant 64-yard touchdown pass play to
bring the Pittsburgh Steelers from behind for a
21-17 Super Bowl victory yesterday over the Dallas
Cowboys.
The triumph gave the Steelers their second
straight National Football League championship
and dashed the hopes of the valiant but outgunned
Cowboys, who led 10-7 going into the final period.
Gerela, who had missed two earlier field goal
attempts, connected from 36 and 18 yards in just
over two minutes. The Steeler rally was ignited
when Reggie Harrison blocked a Dallas punt out of
the end zone for a Pittsburgh safety.
The safety and two field goals gave Pittsburgh a
15-10 lead, then Bradshaw hit Swann inside the
10-yard line and he romped in for what turned out
to be the winning score.

Fair through tomorrow except patchy morning
fog. Little temperature change. Lows in the 30s to
