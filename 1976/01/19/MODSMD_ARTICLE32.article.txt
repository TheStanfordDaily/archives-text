The new. free Stanford shuttle buses
are being used extensively, according
to statistics released by Plant Services
Maintenance Program Manager Jewell
Goode.
In the first week of operation, the
number of passengers increased from
427 on Monday to 1588 on Friday, for a
total of 5500 riders during the initial
five days. Last week, an average of
1000 to 1200 riders used the service.
Medical Center personnel, students,
facultyand residents of Escondido Vil
lage ride the shuttle buses. All of the
riders interviewed by the Daily were
pleased with the service and felt that it
was a great convenience for them.
The buses are financed by the park
ing fee fund and by the Stanford Shop
ping Center, which uses them on
weekends for transportation within
the center.

The University has leased the two
buses for 17 weeks on an experimental
basis. The projected cost for this
period is $37,000. This is the only use
ot the $184,000 parking fee fund so far,
although an $800 allocation will be
made to assist off-campus students in
formulating car pools. Parking and
Transportation Committee member
Don YVindbigler said.
At an average of 5000 riders per
week, for 17 weeks, the cost per rider
can be projected as less than one-half
cent per ride.
If the project is deemed successful,
the possibility of establishing the shut
tles permanently, and expanding the
routes to service more of the campus
will be considered. However, such ac
tion might require another means of
funding because the parking fee fund
would be insufficient to buy buses and
support increased operation.
