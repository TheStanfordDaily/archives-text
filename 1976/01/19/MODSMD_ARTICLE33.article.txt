# Hawaii travelers will fly

All students wishing to fly ASSU charters to Hawaii this spring should
be accommodated, according to Travel Service Manager Jay Farr.
"We have an option on a 747 from World Airways. It can'hold 450
people. If we get that many to sign up, we will use it instead of the DC-8."
Farr said.
But unless the ASSU commits itself to the 747 soon, Farr said, a
military group could exercise its option and reserve the plane.
Whichever plane is used, the charter will return Monday, March 29,
thus causing its passengers to miss registration day. Farr urged persons
involved to pre-register for spring quarter.
