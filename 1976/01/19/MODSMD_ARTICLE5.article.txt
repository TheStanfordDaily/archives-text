# Stanford lays off union official
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
The University notified United
Stanford Employes (USE) Asst. Presi
dent Williams Reynolds Friday that he
would not be allowed to displace
another employe, and he was laid off
from Hansen Laboratories as
scheduled.
Marshall O'Neill, associate director
of Hansen, told Reynolds in a letter
"there is no 'bumping' opportunity
because it has been determined that
you do not possess sufficient skill and
ability to perform without additional
training."
Under a union-University contract,
signed in June, 1974. a University
employe can take the job of a less
experienced worker, if the senior
employe is about to be laid off and if
the jobs involve the same skills. This
procedure is called "bumping."
Late Friday afternoon, the union
filed its second grievance concerning
Reynolds' layoff. The grievance al

leges that Reynolds, a Hansen
machinist for over six years, should be
allowed to bump Albert Armes, a Stan
ford Electronics Laboratoires mechni
cian for the past two years.
Reynolds unqualified?
Douglas Barton, University staff
counsel for employe relations, admit
ted that both employes are "mechni
cians" â€” part-time machinists and
part-time technicians. However, Bar
ton said Armes' job involves "the
machining of very hard metals" which
are used under "vacuum-type" condi
tions. Barton said Reynolds does not
have the appropriate skill for the job.
Reynolds could not be reached for
comment, but USE President Jim Berk
said Reynolds does have the required
skill.
Calling the layoff "ridiculous," Berk
said the University laid off Reynolds
because of his union activities. "He
was a thorn in their side, and they
wanted to get rid of him."
Skipping preliminary procedures,
the grievance will be heard Wednes
day by the Unit Committee, a board of
three union and three University offi
cials. The board will also hear the ap
peal of an earlier grievance concerning
Reynolds.
Earlier grievance
In the earlier grievance, the union
claimed that non-bargaining unit
members would be doing bargaining
unit work if Reynolds were dismissed.
According to the contract, bargaining
unit workers are "technical, mainte
nance and service workes" rep
resented by the union. The union and
the University do not agree on the
meaning of this phrase.
Berk said he had little hope that the
Unit Committee would reach a deci
sion. "When the committee meets, we
usually agree to disagree," he said.
Should this happen, the grievances
will then "go to an outside arbitrator,"
he said.
The union and the University pick
the arbitrator from a list of Bay Area
lawyers including John Dearman,
Howard Durham, Louis Carcia, David
Karasick, Herman Levy and Gerald
Marcus.
According to Berk, an outside arbit
rator may not decidethecasefor "three
or four months."
Notified last month
Reynolds was first notified in De
cember that he would be laid off last
Friday. Controversy between the Uni
versity and the union surfaced two
weeks ago when about 20 union mem
bers, protesting Reynolds' layoff, de
monstrated for one day in front of En
cina Hall and the Old Pavilion.
The University questioned the legal
ity of the protest because of a no
strike provision in the contract. Barton
said the contract "says in black and
white that no picketing is allowed."
He defined picketing as a gathering of
workers with "placards on sticks."
At that time. Berk disagreed with the
definition, saying, "A picket is a lineto
keep workers from entering their place
of employment. We are simply trying
to educate the people. We're not ask
ing people to stop working or to cause
slowdowns."
