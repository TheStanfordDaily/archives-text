# American studies program celebrates Bicentennial here

A proposed theme house for 1976-77 and the approval
of a new interdepartmental major highlight the recent
progress made in American studies at Stanford.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton said the
American studies theme house proposal, although not yet
approved, has "received very favorable determination
from the advisory board," and that "all systems are go."
Plans, according to Horton, will be finalized in time for the
spring housing draw so tours and open houses can be
held.
Horton said an interdepartmental American studies
major, approved on Dec. 4, 1975, should "remedy the
mushiness into which existing study plans sometimes
fall." In the past, undergraduates with an interest in
American studies designed their own majors or enrolled
in the Humanities Honors Program with an emphasis on
American studies.
The new major stresses the importance of including
both the social sciences and the humanities. Majors just
select one area of concentration within the major â€”
"American Thought and Imagi nation." "American Social
Organization and Behavior" or "American Policy and In
stitutions."
Requirements
From a list of approximately 70 courses, a major must
select five within his area of concentration, and take three
courses in each of the other two areas.
Theconcentration on "American Thought and Imagina
tion" emphasizes courses from the English. Art. Drama,
Communication and Religious Studies Departments.
"American Social Organization and Behavior" includes
classes on economics, history, and sociology. The third
concentration includes courses on political science, edu
cation, history and law, among others.

Ten students declared the new major in the first two
weeks of its existence. The Humanities Honors Program in
American studies, established in 1969, already has
roughly the same enrollment.
One of the major differences between the two programs
is the Humanities Honors Program requires a senior hon
ors thesis. Honors thesis will be optional for the new
major, mainly because of personnel problems. American
Studies Policy Committee Chairman William Clebsch
said, however, "We would like very much to have a senior
thesis from everyone in the program."
'A schism'
Praise for the new program has been exceptionally high,
but there has been some criticism. One major felt that a
"schism has developed between Humanities Honors
program students and American studies students," and
said outside activities, such as sherry hours and lectures,
had not yet been prevalent.
The American Studies Student Association, established
in the fall of 1974, has been active in the development of
the program. This group, originally dedicated to "opening
up channels of communication" through sherry hours,
lectures and pamphlets, became more involved with pol
icy and planning of the new major last quarter.
In addition, the association has become very involved
with the theme house. Senior Mike Hammond, a represen
tative of the association, said that a committee of students
supporting the theme house "should in no way be aligned
specifically and only with the American Studies prog
ram." The proposed theme house, modelled basically
after the French House, will hopefully "preserve a general
interest in American studies instead of having a house full
of majors."
The committee has suggested a house with space for 40
to 50 residents and facilities for visitors.
