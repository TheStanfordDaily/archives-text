# Area schools face vote on merger for integration
## 
### DANA CURRY 
A controversial proposal to merge
the Palo Alto Unified School District
with several south San Mateo County
school systems could become reality if
it is approved next Thursday. Jan. 22,
by the Santa Clara County Committee
on School District Organization.
If subsequently approved by the
State Board of Education and the vot
ers of the affected districts, the merger
could go into effect "in the fall of
1977," according to Jack Robertson of
the Mid-Peninsula Task Force for In
tegrated Education, which is sponsor
ing the proposal.
The proposal calls for the formation
of a Mid-Peninsula Unified School
District consisting of Menlo Park, Las
Lomitas, Portola Valley and
Ravenswood elementary school dis
tricts; the southern part of the Sequoia
Union High School District

(Ravenswood and Menlo-Atherton
High Schools); and the Palo Alto Un
ified School District.
Racial integration is the primary
goal of the proposal.
'Deprived of opportunities'
"Mid-Peninsula white kids are
being deprived of opportunities to as
sociate with minorities, and
Ravenswood elementary kids are be
hind those of other districts," said
Robertson, explaining reasons for the
proposal at a recent public hearing.
The Ravenswood elementary dis
trict in East Palo Alto has a mostly
black enrollment, while the other dis
tricts have largely white populations.
The proposed unified district would
have about 23,000 students and a ra
cial distribution of about 70 percent
white, 24 percent black and 6 percent
other minorities.
Proponents of the merger proposal
claim that the unified district could
alleviate the financial problems and
declining enrollments of the indi
vidual districts.
Strongest opposition to the proposal
has come from Palo Alto residents.
Larry Klein, a member of a Palo Alto
parents' group called the Committee
for Community Schools, said he was
opposed mainly because "the Palo
Alto identity and sense of community,
which are helped by the Palo Alto
school system, would be lost under
this merger. The benefits are not worth
the risk of throwing it all away."
Objections
Klein also objected to "the sheer size
of the proposed district, the inefficien
cies that would be created by the in
creased size and the increased cost to
Palo Alto taxpayers."
In defense of the proposal,
Robertson maintained that "Palo Alto
kids need interracial experiences, and
it's in Palo Alto's interests to have a
healthy community in East Palo Alto."
He added that there would be no sig
nificant change in the tax rate for Palo
Alto residents, and that the increase
from Palo Alto's present 16,000 stu
dents to 23,000 would not be unman
ageable.
The Ravenswood elementary school
board has formally opposed the
merger proposal, but Robertson said
evidence showed that residents of East
Palo Alto "overwhelmingly" support
the proposal.

could go into effect "in the fall of
1977," according to Jack Robertson of
the Mid-Peninsula Task Force for In
tegrated Education, which is sponsor
ing the proposal.
The proposal calls for the formation
of a Mid-Peninsula Unified School
District consisting of Menlo Park, Las
Lomitas, Portola Valley and
Ravenswood elementary school dis
tricts; the southern part of the Sequoia
Union High School District

(Ravenswood and Menlo-Atherton
High Schools); and the Palo Alto Un
ified School District.
Racial integration is the primary
goal of the proposal.
'Deprived of opportunities'
"Mid-Peninsula white kids are
being deprived of opportunities to as
sociate with minorities, and
Ravenswood elementary kids are be
hind those of other districts," said
Robertson, explaining reasons for the
proposal at a recent public hearing.
The Ravenswood elementary dis
trict in East Palo Alto has a mostly
black enrollment, while the other dis
tricts have largely white populations.
The proposed unified district would
have about 23,000 students and a ra
cial distribution of about 70 percent
white, 24 percent black and 6 percent
other minorities.
Proponents of the merger proposal
claim that the unified district could
alleviate the financial problems and
declining enrollments of the indi
vidual districts.
Strongest opposition to the proposal
has come from Palo Alto residents.
Larry Klein, a member of a Palo Alto
parents' group called the Committee
for Community Schools, said he was
opposed mainly because "the Palo
Alto identity and sense of community,
which are helped by the Palo Alto
school system, would be lost under
this merger. The benefits are not worth
the risk of throwing it all away."
Objections
Klein also objected to "the sheer size
of the proposed district, the inefficien
cies that would be created by the in
creased size and the increased cost to
Palo Alto taxpayers."
In defense of the proposal,
Robertson maintained that "Palo Alto
kids need interracial experiences, and
it's in Palo Alto's interests to have a
healthy community in East Palo Alto."
He added that there would be no sig
nificant change in the tax rate for Palo
Alto residents, and that the increase
from Palo Alto's present 16,000 stu
dents to 23,000 would not be unman
ageable.
The Ravenswood elementary school
board has formally opposed the
merger proposal, but Robertson said
evidence showed that residents of East
Palo Alto "overwhelmingly" support
the proposal.
