### ALEXANDER LEFF 
The Hopkins Marine Station at
Pacific Grove, a branch of Stanford's
Department of Biological Sciences, is
being "revitalized," with a $1 million
program for renovation and new
equipment, according to Assoc. Pro
vost Edward Shaw.
The future of the 83-year-old institu
tion. located 90 miles from the Stan
ford campus, looked doubtful at times
during recent years. Hopkins has been
without a director for three years since
Biological Sciences Prof. John Phillips
resigned the post, and the station has
suffered from severe budget restraints.
But Shaw praised the station, saying
that 70 undergraduates and 16
graduates per year have "enjoyed a un
ique and important experience with
the high degree of student-faculty in
teraction found at the station.
"The extraordinary confluence of
environmental conditions found at the
location of the Hopkins Station"
helped convince the administration
that "it would be a shame not to take
advantage of the benefits that can
come from a revitalized station," Shaw
said.
