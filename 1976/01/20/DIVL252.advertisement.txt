iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiHi by Patty Fgls
Why can't we at Serra House get our Daily delivered? We got it here
for many years. Then last quarter it stopped. I called the Daily
10-12 times last quarter. A girl took the message and said she
ivould tell whomever was responsible. But nothing ever happens.-
JB.
Our representatives have contacted Harvey Chang, Daily circula
tion manager. Apparently, the problem isn't that Serra isn't getting
the paper (it is) but that it's not getting enough. By the time you race
downstairs, panting for your fresh Daily, all the copies have been
snatched up.
Chang has promised to increase your papers from 400 to 450.
Hope this solves the problem.

IVhnt is the official University policy on unleashed dogs on cam
pus? Are there any special rules for the Tresidder area?-P.R.
A spokesman for the police department said that no unleashed
dog is legal on campus. Stanford is a fish and game preserve, which
requires that all dogs be leashed. Unfortunately, this rule is not
enforced as strenuously as it might be, especially at Tresidder.

When and why wos Zeta Psi put on probation?-W.M.E.
TheZete house was put on probation for the 1963-64 year. Appa
rently, the major reason was damage of the Alpha Kappa Lambda
house which involved broken furniture, torn-up tiles, a broken
guitar and weights dropped from the second floor. Last, but hardly
least, was a "blow resulting in damage to . . . (the) teeth" of an AKL.

iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiHi by Patty Fgls
Why can't we at Serra House get our Daily delivered? We got it here
for many years. Then last quarter it stopped. I called the Daily
10-12 times last quarter. A girl took the message and said she
ivould tell whomever was responsible. But nothing ever happens.-
JB.
Our representatives have contacted Harvey Chang, Daily circula
tion manager. Apparently, the problem isn't that Serra isn't getting
the paper (it is) but that it's not getting enough. By the time you race
downstairs, panting for your fresh Daily, all the copies have been
snatched up.
Chang has promised to increase your papers from 400 to 450.
Hope this solves the problem.

IVhnt is the official University policy on unleashed dogs on cam
pus? Are there any special rules for the Tresidder area?-P.R.
A spokesman for the police department said that no unleashed
dog is legal on campus. Stanford is a fish and game preserve, which
requires that all dogs be leashed. Unfortunately, this rule is not
enforced as strenuously as it might be, especially at Tresidder.

When and why wos Zeta Psi put on probation?-W.M.E.
TheZete house was put on probation for the 1963-64 year. Appa
rently, the major reason was damage of the Alpha Kappa Lambda
house which involved broken furniture, torn-up tiles, a broken
guitar and weights dropped from the second floor. Last, but hardly
least, was a "blow resulting in damage to . . . (the) teeth" of an AKL.
