# Catholic chaplain to wed; told to leave priesthood
## 
### PERRY SIMON 
Rev. John Duryea, pastor of St. Ann's
Chapel in Palo Alto and Catholic chap
lain for Stanford United Ministry, an
nounced Sunday that he is going to
wed and must therefore leave the
priesthood.
Duryea said in yesterday's Palo Alto
Times his departure from the Roman
Catholic priesthood is not voluntary.
"I'm being kicked out of the church.
I'm not resigning," Duryea said.
"Now, at last, 1 have done the final
thing that the institutional church will
not tolerate. I have fallen in love."
Rev. Robert Giguere has been ap
pointed acting pastor at St. Ann's
Chapel and he will also become
Catholic chaplain at Stanford.
Eve Deßona, a 34-year-old artist, is
expected to wed Duryea, 58, sometime
this spring. Deßona, who is not
Catholic, is a divorcee with two young
daughters.
Duryea was ordained in 1943. He
has served for the past 15 years as the
pastor (senior priest) at St. Ann's
Chapel in Palo Alto and has been ex
tremely popular among his congrega
tion.
During that period, he has led Wed
nesday and Sunday masses at Stan
ford's Memorial Church and has been
the chaplain for Catholic Stanford
students.
Church statement
The reaction to Duryea's an
nouncement by the Archdiocese of
San Francisco was restrained. Ar
chbishop Joseph McGucken's state
ment read:
"We regret the step that Father
Duryea has taken. We are grateful for
the many years of faithful priestly ser
vice he gave to the church."
The Palo Alto Times reported that
prior to Duryea's announcement, he
had a conversation with McGucken in
which the Archbishop advised Duryea
to postpone his decision, make a re

treat, and, according to Duryea, "think
it over and be a good boy."
In response to Duryea's allegation
that he is being "kicked out," Gerard
Sherry, the Director of Information for
the Archdiose and editor of the
Catholic Monitor, retorted, "Nobody's
forcing him out .... He broke the
rules."
Sherry said, "The priesthood is for
celibates, and Father Duryea re
affirmed his vow when he was or
dained. Now that he has taken a
woman to marry, he must be excluded,
but this was a voluntary decision on
his part."
If Duryea should try to contest his
dismissal, Sherry claimed "he would
have no legal grounds to sue the
Church, and the canon laws are
explicit."
Whether Duryea will protest his
dismissal is unknown, as Duryea
could not be reached for comment.
Reaction varied
Public opinion concerning Duryea's
dilemma is generally sympathetic,
based on the reactions of his congreg
ants at St. Ann's and Memorial
Church.
However, one congregant at last
Sunday's mass at Memorial Church re
sponded to Duryea's renouncement of
the Church's celibacy rule by angrily
storming out of the church in the mid
dle of the service.
Edith Bridges, secretary to the Dean
of Memorial Church, described Duryea
as "always at swords with issues. I
suppose he could be considered a
progressive, though he was quite con
servative in certain ceremonial re
spects."
Celibacy issue
According to Sherry, the number of
pastors leaving the priesthood in order
to marry reached a peak in the 1960s
and early 19705, but since then the
trend has substantially abated.
"The last case of this sort involved
Father Phillip Murphy in 1972. In the

last two to three years, there has been
no pastor who has quit in order to be
come married," Sherry said.
The roots of the traditional rule re
quiring priests to take a vow of celi
bacy can be traced back to various
quotes in the scriptures, said Katie Al
lende, a junior and member of the
Stanford Christian Fellowship.
As an example, she said the Apostle
Paul, in the New Testament, wrote:
"One who is unmarried is concerned
about the things of the Lord, how he
may please the Lord; but one who is
married is concerned about the things
of the world, how he may please his
wife, and his interests are divided."
Duryea's brother, Robert Duryea
Jr., was suspended from the priesthood
almost five years ago when it was re
vealed that he had been married for
seven years while still serving as a
priest.

Sherry said, "The priesthood is for
celibates, and Father Duryea re
affirmed his vow when he was or
dained. Now that he has taken a
woman to marry, he must be excluded,
but this was a voluntary decision on
his part."
If Duryea should try to contest his
dismissal, Sherry claimed "he would
have no legal grounds to sue the
Church, and the canon laws are
explicit."
Whether Duryea will protest his
dismissal is unknown, as Duryea
could not be reached for comment.
Reaction varied
Public opinion concerning Duryea's
dilemma is generally sympathetic,
based on the reactions of his congreg
ants at St. Ann's and Memorial
Church.
However, one congregant at last
Sunday's mass at Memorial Church re
sponded to Duryea's renouncement of
the Church's celibacy rule by angrily
storming out of the church in the mid
dle of the service.
Edith Bridges, secretary to the Dean
of Memorial Church, described Duryea
as "always at swords with issues. I
suppose he could be considered a
progressive, though he was quite con
servative in certain ceremonial re
spects."
Celibacy issue
According to Sherry, the number of
pastors leaving the priesthood in order
to marry reached a peak in the 1960s
and early 19705, but since then the
trend has substantially abated.
"The last case of this sort involved
Father Phillip Murphy in 1972. In the

last two to three years, there has been
no pastor who has quit in order to be
come married," Sherry said.
The roots of the traditional rule re
quiring priests to take a vow of celi
bacy can be traced back to various
quotes in the scriptures, said Katie Al
lende, a junior and member of the
Stanford Christian Fellowship.
As an example, she said the Apostle
Paul, in the New Testament, wrote:
"One who is unmarried is concerned
about the things of the Lord, how he
may please the Lord; but one who is
married is concerned about the things
of the world, how he may please his
wife, and his interests are divided."
Duryea's brother, Robert Duryea
Jr., was suspended from the priesthood
almost five years ago when it was re
vealed that he had been married for
seven years while still serving as a
priest.


BORED BY FORD — President Ford didn't make any
startling proposals in his State of the Union address last
night, but he did propose a $10 billion bonus tax cut

given at the Law School last September. University Pres

Rev. John Duryea, pastor of St. Ann's
Chapel in Palo Alto and Catholic chap
lain for Stanford United Ministry, an
nounced Sunday that he is going to
wed and must therefore leave the
priesthood.
Duryea said in yesterday's Palo Alto
Times his departure from the Roman
Catholic priesthood is not voluntary.
"I'm being kicked out of the church.
I'm not resigning," Duryea said.
"Now, at last, 1 have done the final
thing that the institutional church will
not tolerate. I have fallen in love."
Rev. Robert Giguere has been ap
pointed acting pastor at St. Ann's
Chapel and he will also become
Catholic chaplain at Stanford.
Eve Deßona, a 34-year-old artist, is
expected to wed Duryea, 58, sometime
this spring. Deßona, who is not
Catholic, is a divorcee with two young
daughters.
Duryea was ordained in 1943. He
has served for the past 15 years as the
pastor (senior priest) at St. Ann's
Chapel in Palo Alto and has been ex
tremely popular among his congrega
tion.
During that period, he has led Wed
nesday and Sunday masses at Stan
ford's Memorial Church and has been
the chaplain for Catholic Stanford
students.
Church statement
The reaction to Duryea's an
nouncement by the Archdiocese of
San Francisco was restrained. Ar
chbishop Joseph McGucken's state
ment read:
"We regret the step that Father
Duryea has taken. We are grateful for
the many years of faithful priestly ser
vice he gave to the church."
The Palo Alto Times reported that
prior to Duryea's announcement, he
had a conversation with McGucken in
which the Archbishop advised Duryea
to postpone his decision, make a re

treat, and, according to Duryea, "think
it over and be a good boy."
In response to Duryea's allegation
that he is being "kicked out," Gerard
Sherry, the Director of Information for
the Archdiose and editor of the
Catholic Monitor, retorted, "Nobody's
forcing him out .... He broke the
rules."
Sherry said, "The priesthood is for

Rev. John Duryea, pastor of St. Ann's
Chapel in Palo Alto and Catholic chap
lain for Stanford United Ministry, an
nounced Sunday that he is going to
wed and must therefore leave the
priesthood.
Duryea said in yesterday's Palo Alto
Times his departure from the Roman
Catholic priesthood is not voluntary.
"I'm being kicked out of the church.
I'm not resigning," Duryea said.
"Now, at last, 1 have done the final
thing that the institutional church will
not tolerate. I have fallen in love."
Rev. Robert Giguere has been ap
pointed acting pastor at St. Ann's
Chapel and he will also become
Catholic chaplain at Stanford.
Eve Deßona, a 34-year-old artist, is
expected to wed Duryea, 58, sometime
this spring. Deßona, who is not
Catholic, is a divorcee with two young
daughters.
Duryea was ordained in 1943. He
has served for the past 15 years as the
pastor (senior priest) at St. Ann's
Chapel in Palo Alto and has been ex
tremely popular among his congrega
tion.
During that period, he has led Wed
nesday and Sunday masses at Stan
ford's Memorial Church and has been
the chaplain for Catholic Stanford
students.
Church statement
The reaction to Duryea's an
nouncement by the Archdiocese of
San Francisco was restrained. Ar
chbishop Joseph McGucken's state
ment read:
"We regret the step that Father
Duryea has taken. We are grateful for
the many years of faithful priestly ser
vice he gave to the church."
The Palo Alto Times reported that
prior to Duryea's announcement, he
had a conversation with McGucken in
which the Archbishop advised Duryea
to postpone his decision, make a re

treat, and, according to Duryea, "think
it over and be a good boy."
In response to Duryea's allegation
that he is being "kicked out," Gerard
Sherry, the Director of Information for
the Archdiose and editor of the
Catholic Monitor, retorted, "Nobody's
forcing him out .... He broke the
rules."
Sherry said, "The priesthood is for
celibates, and Father Duryea re
affirmed his vow when he was or
dained. Now that he has taken a
woman to marry, he must be excluded,
but this was a voluntary decision on
his part."
If Duryea should try to contest his
dismissal, Sherry claimed "he would
have no legal grounds to sue the
Church, and the canon laws are
explicit."
Whether Duryea will protest his
dismissal is unknown, as Duryea
could not be reached for comment.
Reaction varied
Public opinion concerning Duryea's
dilemma is generally sympathetic,
based on the reactions of his congreg
ants at St. Ann's and Memorial
Church.
However, one congregant at last
Sunday's mass at Memorial Church re
sponded to Duryea's renouncement of
the Church's celibacy rule by angrily
storming out of the church in the mid
dle of the service.
Edith Bridges, secretary to the Dean
of Memorial Church, described Duryea
as "always at swords with issues. I
suppose he could be considered a
progressive, though he was quite con
servative in certain ceremonial re
spects."
Celibacy issue
According to Sherry, the number of
pastors leaving the priesthood in order
to marry reached a peak in the 1960s
and early 19705, but since then the
trend has substantially abated.
"The last case of this sort involved
Father Phillip Murphy in 1972. In the

last two to three years, there has been
no pastor who has quit in order to be
come married," Sherry said.
The roots of the traditional rule re
quiring priests to take a vow of celi
bacy can be traced back to various
quotes in the scriptures, said Katie Al
lende, a junior and member of the
Stanford Christian Fellowship.
As an example, she said the Apostle
Paul, in the New Testament, wrote:
"One who is unmarried is concerned
about the things of the Lord, how he
may please the Lord; but one who is
married is concerned about the things
of the world, how he may please his
wife, and his interests are divided."
Duryea's brother, Robert Duryea
Jr., was suspended from the priesthood
almost five years ago when it was re
vealed that he had been married for
seven years while still serving as a
priest.
