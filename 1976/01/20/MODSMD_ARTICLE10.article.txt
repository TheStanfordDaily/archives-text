Yosemite campaign
Editor:
As one deeply concerned with
Yosemite National Park and the
results of the Master Flan regard
ing its future, I was extremely
glad to see others (Daily. Jan. 14)
also expressing such interest. 1
am now awaiting arrival of my
own planning "kit," and have
helped others work on it; being
familiar with this project, 1 can
say confidently the kit is well
designed in that it appeals to ev
ery citizen, whether he be the
owner of a Winnebago or a
staunch backpacker.
The kit was created with the
intention of gathering feedback
from the public about its desires
for Yosemite's future, and 1 think
it should be pointed out to Stan
ford students that they too, being
members of the general public,
can help save Yosemite by ob
taining their own kits.
A phone call or letter to a Na
tional Park Headquarters is all it
takes. The National Park Service
will send the booklet free of
charge.
Take advantage of the chance
to voice youropinion. Thefuture
of Yosemite and other parks like
it depend on our support.

As the professor emeritus who
seemed to be in imminent
danger of suffering flood and
other destructive elements
(I)aily, Jan. 15), I feel con
strained to point out the trouble
was owing to a broken water
line. The leak has been repaired
and, 10, the waters have receded
and I again stand upon dry land.
With one of the article's criti
cisms, I am in agreement: the
second bedroom is too small to
serve adequately as a study.
However, this deficiency can
easily be remedied by the Uni
versity. All that is required is for
the administration to provide of
fices, however small, for the pro
fessors emeriti who need them.
I count myself among that
company. For some of us old
dudes, as the students (affec
tionately?) call us, home is not
where we hang our hats but
where we put our books.
