# Reagan's budget unfeasible

As the New Hampshire primary approaches
Ronald Reagan is enjoying Callup Poll popularity
unprecedented in opposing an incumbent for the
incumbent party's Presidential nomination.
His most controversial proposal to date enum
erates budget cuts totalling $90 billion he would
make in the 1976 Federal budget if he were
elected President.
These cuts, the bent of which might well be
described by the old Goldwater slogan "billions
for defense but not one cent for people," include
complete elimination of a number of programs.
Among the victims: Federal aid to education, re
venue sharing and mass transit funding (a dubi
ous economy in view of concern about dwindling
energy resources).
Sharply cut would be federal income security,
federal subsidy /jpJogfvifns and health care ex
penditures, with complete abolition of
foodstamps and unemployment assistance.
The former governor's desire in such massive
axing of federal programs is not mere budget
balancing but rather "transfer of control, author
ity and responsibility for programs from the fed
eral government to those closer to the people."
The burden, in other words, would be shifted to
state and local government.
However, Reagan has little to say about the abil
ity of local governments to undertake these added

responsibility either financially or administra
tively.
Recent events inspire little confidence in
Reagan's administrative mechanism. He also fails
to mention, though many New Hampshire voters
quickly have spotted it, that state and local taxes
will have to rise enormously to finance the addi
tional responsibilities.
Such increases would undoubtedly disadvan
tage the poor because regressive levies such as
sales and real estate taxes contribute the bulk of
state and local revenues. These tax structures
have not proven amenable to rapid evolution to
ward more progressive forms of collective.
The increase in debt financing by states and
municipalities would also affect interest rates and
capital availability.
Reagan has failed to justify this transfer of au
thority in concrete terms. His only support has
been rhetorical references to isolated cases of wel
fare fraud.
The disruptive economic and income distribu
tion effects implied by the plan raise grave doubts
about the candidate's competence. His statements
on defense and cavalier attitude toward the dis
advantaged cause one to wonder about the aims
and beliefs of those backing his campaign effort.
