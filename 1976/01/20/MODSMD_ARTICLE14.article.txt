## ARLO: points ahead at half-time 
### KATHLEEN McTIGUE 
The Action Research Liaison
Office (ARLO) has been with
Stanford for over four quarters
now, nearly half of its three-year
trial period. During that time
its leaders say it haS both prog
ressed and become a valuable
addition to the curriculum.
But in evaluating ARLO's
success to date, co-director Bill
Leland claims it is important
that ARLO's worth not be mea
sured necessarily in numerical
terms, but rather in the value of
specific projects to the indi
viduals involved.
The first six months of
ARLO's existence served as a
time for the staff to make initial
contacts with groups in the
area. Problems arose when it
became clear that some groups
were proposing projects to
ARLO without being sure of

how they wished to use stu
dents for those projects.
One casualty of such vague
ness was a project evaluating
the Palo Alto Paramedic Prog
ram. Interested students met
with each other and began to
formulate survey guidelines.

But, according to Leland, the
sponsors of the program were
not able to use the students
when they were ready, and the
project was abandoned.
Solicitation unnecessary
Project solicitations are no
longer necessary. Local groups
know of ARLO's existence, Le
land says, and when they ap
proach ARLO they usually have
a fairly clear idea of what it is
they want, how they envision
the project and when they need
results.
If a group approaches ARLO
without these things in mind,
Leland says, it is told that ARLO
is willing and eager to work
with them, but that clearer
guidelines are needed.
And, as Leland put it, "we
make sure that they are not ex
pecting students to solve all of
their problems."
Positive feedback from suc
cessful projects has been just as
useful to ARLO's development,
and a great deal more encourag
ing, he adds.
The Nairobi School Project
was such a success wherein
students not only designed, but
completely built a playground
last year.
Nancy Brown and Ted Flato,
the two students who devoted

the most time and energy to the
project, share an unqualified
endorsement of the undertak
ing.
'Something real'
"It's the best learning experi
ence I've had since I've been in
college," says Flato. "It didn't
follow along the lines of a nor
mal project, where you design
something that never gets built.

We were designing something
real."
Many students involved in
current ARLO projects say they
feel similarly.
Emilie Kosin, involved with
the creation of a Mid-Peninsula
Health Service (MHS) co-op,

'Community work is more
complex than simply
going to the library and
checking out books to
read.'

says "I've been able to work
with something real rather than
theoretical. It's been exciting to
watch it taking shape, and I re
ally want it to work."
Some other colleges have
tried to accomplish this through
the adoption of a work interim
period, usually between semes
ters. During this period stu
dents may be able to gain some
practical experience in an area
of interest to them. The experi
ence usually either reinforces
their existing goals, or com
pletely changes their direction.
Outside involvement
In the absence of such an in
terim at Stanford, ARLO is able
to assist students in the same
way, Leland says, by providing
opportunities for involvement

with the world outside of the
University.
According to Leland, the
number of students interested
in ARLO projects is increasing,
as is the number of completed
projects.
The main reason for this in

crease, he says, is a change in
student awareness. When
ARLO began operating, many
students came in simply out of
curiosity. After a brief involve
ment, they lost interest.
Now, Leland says, students

have a better understanding of
the commitment needed.
"They realize that commun
ity work is more complex than
simply going into the library
and checking out books to
read."
