# Northwest leads with regional primaries

SALEM. OREGON, Jan. 19
(Pacific News Service) — The
reform-minded Pacific North
west, where the first presidential
primary originated early this
century, will give the nation its
first planned regional presiden
tial primary this May.
Voters in at least three — and
possibly four — neighboring
states will go to the polls Tues
day, May 25, to express their re
spective choices for presidential
nominees in the party of their
registration.
Oregon, Idaho and Nevada
have already designated May 25
as their simultaneous primary
date, and the Washington legis
lature is considering joining in.
The planned regional primary
will provide a practical test of an
idea pushed so far unsuccess
fully in Congress by Sen. Robert
Packwood (R-Ore.) and Sen.
WalterMondale(D-Minn.), who
want to reform a nominating sys
tem that Mondale describes as
"something close to anarchy and
in desperate need of fundamen
tal and comprehensive change."
The presidential primary sys
tem has become a patchwork
conglomeration of 28 different
primaries scattered all over the
presidential year calendar from
February to June. (While three

Southeastern states are
scheduled to have their
primaries the same day this
spring, election officials there
describe it as largely coinci
dence.) Most of the primaries
have different ground rules. Re
sults are confusing and seldom
as significant as the media
would make them out.
Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D.-
Minn.), who ought to know, has
called the present primary sys
tem "emotionally, physically
and financially exhausting."
Any reporter who has gone
through one will say amen.
Primaries have also been called
wacky sideshows signifying lit
tle or too much.
Packwood and Mondale have
proposedsomewhat different
bills for converting to regional
primaries, but the bills have run
afoul of strong state traditions
and the U.S. Constitution, which
stands aloof from federal regula
tion of the process of choosing
presidential electors.
Even though Packwood and
Mondale would say that no state
need have a presidential primary
if it doesn't want one (many
don't), a regional pattern seems
to have developed here in the
West where there is a strong
primary tradition.
