## Cedro presents... Chivalrous 'Camelot' 
### MICHAEL FOSSEL ELIZABETH KELLEY 
Who is there who is unfamiliar with the en
chantment of the chivalrous world of Camelot?
Who has not heard of the glory of the Knights of
the Round Table or of the tragedy of King Arthur,
Guenevere and Lancelot and their ill-fated love
for one another?
The legend of Arthur and the Round Table was
once again unfurled as Cedro played its imagina
tive production of Camelot to delighted audi
ences this past weekend.
Director Paul Groves and dramatic director
Richard Maxwell are to be commended for the
marvelous transformation of the sterile Cedro din
ing room. Their combination of simple scenery
and extraordinarily colorful costumes created the
fun, mystique and excitment necessary to a suc
cessful production of Camelot.
Although both the staging and the costumes
were tremendously impressive, the high point of
the show, of course, was the cast itself. Nicholas
Kouletsis is someone who Stanford will hopefully
see a great deal more of in its upcoming theater
pieces. His adroit handling of Arthur brought
forth both the naivete of the boy king on the day of
his marriage to an unknown bride and the
heartbreaking nobility of a monarch who must
sacrifice his beloved wife for the ideals that have
been the salvation of the country.
As the story progressed, one could see Arthur
aging, the boy maturing into Arthur's own image
of a king. While his voice might have been fuller,
his songs were smooth, if not dynamic, through
out the performance.
Arthur's queen, Guenevere, was played by Fr
ances Furtner. Although her voice was a bit too
shakey for the strong soprano songs of the part,
Furtner more than made up for her faulty singing
with her vivacious acting. She captured a lively,

impish-though-arrogant attitude that made a de
light to watch.
At limes Furtner appeared to be overacting,
showing a tendency to drift and bounce on the
stage. Still, it would have been unwise to have
toned down her acting unless the life and beauty
which she put into her part could have been
channeled more constructively.
Lancelot, Guenevere's lover and Arthur's right
hand, was played very well by Mark Dioguardi,
who assumed a straight-faced, ever serious and
ever true attitude in his role. This prevented him
from falling into the abyss of melodrama that can
so easily plague such a part.
Although more life and flare could have been
put into "C'est Moi" (which turned out to be a
show stopper Saturday night), Dioguardi's acting
and singing were very polished.
The primary trio undoubtedly were responsible
for the overall success of the show, but they were
fortunate to have several fine comic actors to give
the musical an extra sparkle of fun.
The male chorus did an outstanding job of "Fie
on Goodness" with special kudos to soloists Paul
Groves and Steve Sawyer (Sir Dinadan).
Don Wee(Merlyn) is also to be congratulated for
his grasp of the cosmic — although the volume
could have gone up a bit. Stan Abshier created a
great deal of laughter in his role as Pellinore, the
old king who quests after the Beast, but Horrid
(Kelly) should have been more a part of the scene.
With a cast so obviously in love with its
show, director Paul Groves created a splendid
evening — a performance that entertained and
delighted us all. Camelot was an instance of what
dorm theater can and should be all about —
people having a good time themselves while
creating a good performance for others.


ONE BRIEF SHINING MOMENT—Stan Abshier as Pellinore, Nicholas Kouletsis as Arthur and Bill
Broad as Tom of Warwick in a scene from Cameiot. Arthur knights Tom, a boy on the way to Cameiot
to become a part of the Round Table. Arthur convinces him not to get involved in war but suggests
that he remember what Cameiot stands for — peaceful negotiation rather than physical battle.
