# Bicentennial flute-piano duo delights
## 
### MARC ZASADA 
Last Friday the Stanford
Music Department presented a
delightful Bicentennialfluteand
piano recital performed by
Alexandra Hawley and Kenneth
Ziegenfuss.
If the audience expected a
standard rendition of revolutio
nary war songs, they were in for
a surprise.
The program touched only
briefly on early American music,
jumping quickly to a series of
contemporary works by such
composers as Copland and Im
brie.
Throughout the evening, the
performances of Hawley and
Ziegenfuss were characterized
by professionalism and musi
cianship, their talents comple
menting each other neatly.
The recital began with an
amazing collection of brief flute
melodies from the early 19th
century. The tempo was formal
but the melodies were light, and
Ziegenfuss's accompanying ar
rangements on piano gave the
pieces an added life.
These were followed by a pair
of Stephen Foster compositions
from the mid-1800s. The first,
"Anadolia," is a pretty piece
played sweetly by the duo. The
second, "Village Festival," is a
collage of snappy tunes which
served to introduce the not
diminutive talents of Hawley.
Hawley's crowning touch
"Sonata for Flute Solo. Op. 24"
by John LaMontaine (b. 1920)
was a spectacular display of
slippery pyrotechnics. This
piece itself is a modernistic
cacaphoney of intricate arpeg
gios and exciting quick-changes.
Hawley flashed through the
allegro con brio second and
fourth sections, while exercising
tight control and effective re
straint on the first and third
adagio movements.
The duo rejoined forces to per
form Charles Griffes's "Poem,"
another modernistic work. Pur
portedly autobiographical, it
seems to ramble in an agonized
sort of way that leaves the lis
tener unmoved.
The artists attempted to inject
it with some much-needed life,
but it remained the low point in
an otherwise entertaining even
ing.
Ziegenfuss's solo, "Sonata for
Piano," (1947) by Andrew Im
brie, is a contemporary attack on
the senses socked with lengthy
dischordant passages and laced
with brief bursts of seemingly ir
relevant sound.
The work's purposeless qual
ity is only accentuated by its un
defined tempo.
All of this does not reflect on
Ziegenfuss's rendering of the
piece, which was precise and
always dynamic. The final
movement allowed him to
exhibit some of his considerable
technical equipment. Previously
in the performance, Ziegenfuss
seemed relegated to the position
of accompanist.
Chosen for the finale was
Aaron Copland's "Duo for Flute
and Piano" (1971). Here at last
was a composition that balanced
the two instruments as they
should be.
This is a highly entertaining
work that dovetails the flute and
piano in a witty give-and-take.
The performers seemed to enjoy
themselves immensely on this
piece, and the audience fol
lowed their lead.
