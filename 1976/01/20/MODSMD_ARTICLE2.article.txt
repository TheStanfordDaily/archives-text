# Police arrest five at Chico State
## 
### DAN FIDUCCIA 
Five students were arrested last
week at Chico State University during
their protest, which began Dec. 3,
against the arming of campus security
police.
From three to seven stu
dents have been occupying an entry
way of the Chico State administration
building during the university's
semester break.
Campus police officers arrested
three students on Jan. 12 for disturbing
the peace when they began "to sing,
stamp their feet and play musical in
struments inside the rotunda of the
administration building," according
to Ed Masterson, Chico State director
of university relations.
Two other students were arrested on
Jan. 15 for "resisting officers in the
discharge of their duties," Masterson
said. Students refused to remove a bul
letin board which was part of their pro
test from the entryway, and then inter
fered with campus police officers who
tried to remove the board, according to
Masterson.
Robert Speer. managing editor of the

Chico State Wildcat, said that all five
students have been released, and some
will appear in court today for a pre
trial hearing.
Speer termed administration reac
tion to the protest as "petty and
stupid."
"First the administration told them
they couldn't have blankets in the
hallway, and then they couldn't have
food or signs, and finally they were
told they couldn't have books with
them," Speer said. "When the students
told the administration they should ar
rest them for having books, the ad
ministration bajpked off."
Grievances presented
The few protesters currently on
campus have presented the universi
ty's Speech and Advocacy Policy
Board with a list of grievances con
cerning the administration's conduct
in the protest.
Chico State students will return for
registration Thursday and Friday, and
rallies have been scheduled for next
Monday and Tuesday.
