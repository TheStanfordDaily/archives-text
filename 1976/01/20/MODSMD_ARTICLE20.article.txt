# Aman Folk Ballet pleases with a varied repertoire of dance, music
## 
### MARK WINKLER 
Aman!, the American International Folk
Ballet, was a rousing success Friday even
ing in Memorial Auditorium. It was an
exhilarating trip to many remote parts of the
world as well as to eras long gone and the
audience loved it.
The program took the form of a series of
short sequences of dances, long enough to
convey the mood and feeling of the culture
yet short enough to sustain interest.
The diversity of dances ranged from a
Croatian belly dance, consisting of a lot of
hopping, to a New England Shaker march
type church service complete with formal
separation of the sexes, from an African tri
bal boogie to an ever-popular Appalachian
square dance.
Amazing repertoire
And such variety was matched by an
amazing repertoire, agility and grace of the
dancers, to the accompaniment of songs
sung in the native tongues and native in

struments played in imitation of village or
chestras.
Native music was most evident in one of
the strangest dances from the island of Krk
in the Adriatic sea. People there have re
tained an archaic folk culture, and their
music was illustrated by old woodwind in
struments constructed on an ancient scale
know as the Istrian.
Closer to home, one of the most fascinat
ing dances was the New England Shaker.
Historically these dances were part of the
Shaker worship service, performed in pub
lic to attract converts.
Audience as bystanders
The dance was performed as if an actual
service were about to take place; the audi
ence was the bystanders in a colonial New
England gown, while a "spokesman"
preached about God and urged conversion.
The dance was an example of fanaticism
at its extreme — the fast movements and
abrupt changes in direction culminated in

exhaustion, hallucinogenic visions and loss
of sensation.
One by one, each member would either
reach a state of self-induced religious ab
sorption, or would pass out to be carried
away by fellow dancers.
Cultural split
The broadest differences in the dances
was evident in the split between the
European cultures, which was carried over
to the new world, and the African dances.
The former were stiffer and rigid in move
ment while the African tended to be more
graceful and fluid — similar to the modern
dance of today that gives the illusion of total
stream-of-consciusness and spontaneity.
The familiar music and dances from Ap
palachian America were an audience favo
rite. The first and best number was a fiddle
competition piece that was impressive in its
dexterity and precision.
And the good-old American square dance
was an effective device for leaving the audi
ence with warm feelings.

in the Adriatic sea. People there have re
tained an archaic folk culture, and their
music was illustrated by old woodwind in
struments constructed on an ancient scale
know as the Istrian.
Closer to home, one of the most fascinat
ing dances was the New England Shaker.
Historically these dances were part of the
Shaker worship service, performed in pub
lic to attract converts.
Audience as bystanders
The dance was performed as if an actual
service were about to take place; the audi
ence was the bystanders in a colonial New
England gown, while a "spokesman"
preached about God and urged conversion.
The dance was an example of fanaticism
at its extreme — the fast movements and
abrupt changes in direction culminated in

exhaustion, hallucinogenic visions and loss
of sensation.
One by one, each member would either
reach a state of self-induced religious ab
sorption, or would pass out to be carried
away by fellow dancers.
Cultural split
The broadest differences in the dances
was evident in the split between the
European cultures, which was carried over
to the new world, and the African dances.
The former were stiffer and rigid in move
ment while the African tended to be more
graceful and fluid — similar to the modern
dance of today that gives the illusion of total
stream-of-consciusness and spontaneity.
The familiar music and dances from Ap
palachian America were an audience favo
rite. The first and best number was a fiddle
competition piece that was impressive in its
dexterity and precision.
And the good-old American square dance
was an effective device for leaving the audi
ence with warm feelings.

Aman!
Aman!, the American International Folk
Ballet, was a rousing success Friday even
ing in Memorial Auditorium. It was an
exhilarating trip to many remote parts of the
world as well as to eras long gone and the
audience loved it.
The program took the form of a series of
short sequences of dances, long enough to
convey the mood and feeling of the culture
yet short enough to sustain interest.
The diversity of dances ranged from a
Croatian belly dance, consisting of a lot of
hopping, to a New England Shaker march
type church service complete with formal
separation of the sexes, from an African tri
bal boogie to an ever-popular Appalachian
square dance.
Amazing repertoire
And such variety was matched by an
amazing repertoire, agility and grace of the
dancers, to the accompaniment of songs
sung in the native tongues and native in

struments played in imitation of village or
chestras.
Native music was most evident in one of
the strangest dances from the island of Krk
in the Adriatic sea. People there have re
tained an archaic folk culture, and their
music was illustrated by old woodwind in
struments constructed on an ancient scale
know as the Istrian.
