# Music Hall's Laserium combines art and science
## 
### KATHY ROSS 
Now I know what 1 would
have asked for as a Christmas
present, if only Laserium had
come to Stanford Music Hall a
month earlier. The laser beam in
concert is a lot of fun to watch,
but it would be more fun to play
with.
The laserist is much like a
choreographer with a predeter
mined soundtrack, whose dan
cers are in his total control. Not
only do they move precisely the
way he wants them to. but they
also appear the way he wants,
and he can change their shape
and form at will.
There are basically two kinds
of tricks the laser can do. One is a
series of travelling dots and lines
that look like a spirograph draw
ing in creation, whose quick ro
tations are perfectly synched to a
given piece of music in quad
rophonic sound.
Sometimes the designs start
out as a tiny dot on the screen

and grow larger as they seem to
come nearer and like the spirog
raph they utilize the naturally
beautiful properties of geometry.
The laserist seems to be draw
ing pictures with the optical il
lusion of light paths, like a child
who proudly announces that he
can "write" his name with his
Fourth-of-July sparkler, or the
baton-twirler who creates the il
lusion of circles with a straight
stick.
The other type of laser trick is
a cosmic effect that looks like a
shimmering, intensely colored,
cloud-like amoeba slowly
slithering through space. The
laserist uses a black starry sky as
the background, while the free
form three-dimensional thing
moves like a filmy, luminescent
monster from Star Trek, or a
body of sloshy blood-red water,
or a giant bird.
Cloud shapes
The experience is something
like looking at cloud formations
on a romantic picnic: you can
make anything you want to out
of the shapes as they move and
reform.
Most of the music accompanv
ing the Music Hall show was
either classical or spacy stuff:

everything from Strauss' peren
nial "Blue Danube" to
"Hoedown" by Emerson. Lake &
Palmer, to a Cal Tjader jazz
xylophone version of "The Clas
sic" to Stone's "Gimme Shelter.
The effects of Laserium are all
generated by a single, one-watt
laser. And "laser" stands for
Light Amplification by Stimu
lated Emmission of Radiation.
The laser beam, famed for its ap
pearances on "Star Trek" during
which it made people sparkle
and die, is an incredibly ver
satile energy source (used in in
dustry, medicine, navigation
and communications) whose
properties are still being vigor
ously explored.
Art, science meet
What makes it truly fascinat
ing, though, is that Laserium
represents a meeting between
two often unreconcilable forces
in our society: art and scientific
technology.
From the extensive and endless
research being done on the re
production of sound, we know
that music needs technology to
survive and grow, but very sel
dom have we seen machines and
physical scientists concerned
with creating an art form.

choreographer with a predeter
mined soundtrack, whose dan
cers are in his total control. Not
only do they move precisely the
way he wants them to. but they
also appear the way he wants,
and he can change their shape
and form at will.
There are basically two kinds
of tricks the laser can do. One is a
series of travelling dots and lines
that look like a spirograph draw
ing in creation, whose quick ro
tations are perfectly synched to a
given piece of music in quad
rophonic sound.
Sometimes the designs start
out as a tiny dot on the screen

and grow larger as they seem to
come nearer and like the spirog
raph they utilize the naturally
beautiful properties of geometry.
The laserist seems to be draw
ing pictures with the optical il
lusion of light paths, like a child
who proudly announces that he
can "write" his name with his
Fourth-of-July sparkler, or the
baton-twirler who creates the il
lusion of circles with a straight
stick.
The other type of laser trick is
a cosmic effect that looks like a
shimmering, intensely colored,
cloud-like amoeba slowly
slithering through space. The
laserist uses a black starry sky as
the background, while the free
form three-dimensional thing
moves like a filmy, luminescent
monster from Star Trek, or a
body of sloshy blood-red water,
or a giant bird.
Cloud shapes
The experience is something
like looking at cloud formations
on a romantic picnic: you can
make anything you want to out
of the shapes as they move and
reform.
Most of the music accompanv
ing the Music Hall show was
either classical or spacy stuff:

everything from Strauss' peren
nial "Blue Danube" to
"Hoedown" by Emerson. Lake &
Palmer, to a Cal Tjader jazz
xylophone version of "The Clas
sic" to Stone's "Gimme Shelter.
The effects of Laserium are all
generated by a single, one-watt
laser. And "laser" stands for
Light Amplification by Stimu
lated Emmission of Radiation.
The laser beam, famed for its ap
pearances on "Star Trek" during
which it made people sparkle
and die, is an incredibly ver
satile energy source (used in in
dustry, medicine, navigation
and communications) whose
properties are still being vigor
ously explored.
Art, science meet
What makes it truly fascinat
ing, though, is that Laserium
represents a meeting between
two often unreconcilable forces
in our society: art and scientific
technology.
From the extensive and endless
research being done on the re
production of sound, we know
that music needs technology to
survive and grow, but very sel
dom have we seen machines and
physical scientists concerned
with creating an art form.
Now I know what 1 would
have asked for as a Christmas
present, if only Laserium had
come to Stanford Music Hall a
month earlier. The laser beam in
concert is a lot of fun to watch,
but it would be more fun to play
with.
