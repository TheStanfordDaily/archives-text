Court approves primary plan
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yesterday
cleared the way for a winner-take-all battle between
President Ford and Republican challenger Ronald
Reagan for California's 167 convention delegates in
the June 8 primary election.
In a brief order, the justices unanimously af
firmed a lower court order that the California sys
tem is constitutional and remains in effect this year.
The court issued no written opinion to elaborate
on its decision.
By refusing to disturb the winner-take-all proce
dure, the court left Ford and Reagan to fight for the.
largest bloc of convention delegates from any state.
—Refused to review the convictions of the Wil
mington Ten, nine black men and a white woman
who were charged in connection with a fire at a
small white-owned grocery store in a black
neighborhood of Wilmington, N.C., during racial
disturbances there in February, 1971. Their prison
sentences ranged from a ten-year maximum for
Ann Shepard to 31 years for two of the youths.
—Refused to reconsider its 24-year-old ruling
that public schools constitutionally may allow
children time off during the school day to attend
religious classes away from the school grounds.
—Declined to reconsider its November decision
upholding a desegregation order which could re
quire busing between the predominantly black city
schools and predominantly white suburban
schools of Wilmington, Del.
Africans hold secret talks
ZAMBIA — Moderate African states were hold
ing secret talks yesterday in a new initiative to
bring peace to war-torn Angola, reliable sources
here reported.
The sources said states taking part in the talks
sought a coalition government and the withdrawal
of all foreign troops to end the civil war which has
ravaged the oil-and-mineral-rich former Por
tuguese colony since last August.
The African initiative coincided with U.S. Sec
retary of State Henry Kissinger's preparations for
talks in Moscow on Angola as well as strategic arms

limitation.
Sources in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, said the
African states plan to create a government of na
tional unity by merging the Marxist Popular
Movement (MPLA) and the pro-Western National
Union (UNITA).
Syrian troops in Lebanon?
BEIRUT — Interior Minister Camille Chamoun
accused Syria of sending troops into Lebanon yes
terday and a police spokesman reported a massive
influx of Palestinian guerrillas into the country
from Syria.
Unofficial estimates said as many as 4000 or 5000
Palestinians may have crossed the Syrian border
into Lebanon, which has been torn for nine months
by civil war between Moslem and Christian fac
tions.
Chamoun, a Christian, said, "This intervention
threatens this spot >n the Middle East with a new
war and also endangers international peace ... In
my capacity as interior minister I instruct Leba
non's permanent delegate to the United Nations to
inform the Security Council about what is going on
in Lebanon."
Spain drafts more workers
MADRID — King Juan Carlos drafted 120,000
more Spanish workers into military service yester
day in an attempt to stem fresh labor and political
unrest and avert a nationwide rail strike.
Anti-government forces ranging from Com
munists to moderates responded by preparing a
protest march to demand national elections to de
cide the country's form of government.
Government and police officials said the de
monstration, planned for the center of Madrid to
day, was illegal and would be prohibited.
The attempt at a show of strength by the nation's
two biggest political fronts, both leftist-controlled,
was a clear bid to embarrass the king and the new
govrnment, perhaps with bloodshed.
Premier Carlos Arias Navarro blamed the unrest
on subversion and said the government was ready

to use all its power to smash it.
Hearst wins new hearing
SAN FRANCISCO — Patricia Hearst's attorneys
yesterday won a new hearing in their attempt to
halt further examination of the newspaper heiress
by a government psychiatrist she claims bullied
her.
Defense attorney Albert Johnson said he had
"newly discovered evidence" on the examination
of Hearst by Dr. Harry kozol, the Boston psychiat
rist she accused last week of driving her to the point
of tears with insulting questions.
Johnson said the 21-year-old defendant would
attend the hearing, but he did not say whether she
would testify, as she had done during a two-day
hearing last week. He would not elaborate on what
the new evidence was.
FCC grants phone rate hike
YVASHINCTON — The Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) voted yesterday to allow
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. to increase
its long-distance telephone rates enough to raise its
rate of return on its investments from 8.74 percent
to 9.5 percent.
It was not clear immediately what increases it
would mean in telephone costs for Bell System
customers.

Highs tomorrow in the 60s to mid 70s. Northeas

Syrian troops in Lebanon?
BEIRUT — Interior Minister Camille Chamoun
accused Syria of sending troops into Lebanon yes
terday and a police spokesman reported a massive
influx of Palestinian guerrillas into the country
from Syria.
Unofficial estimates said as many as 4000 or 5000
Palestinians may have crossed the Syrian border
into Lebanon, which has been torn for nine months
by civil war between Moslem and Christian fac
tions.
Chamoun, a Christian, said, "This intervention
threatens this spot >n the Middle East with a new
war and also endangers international peace ... In
my capacity as interior minister I instruct Leba
non's permanent delegate to the United Nations to
inform the Security Council about what is going on
in Lebanon."
Spain drafts more workers
MADRID — King Juan Carlos drafted 120,000
more Spanish workers into military service yester
day in an attempt to stem fresh labor and political
unrest and avert a nationwide rail strike.
Anti-government forces ranging from Com
munists to moderates responded by preparing a
protest march to demand national elections to de
cide the country's form of government.
Government and police officials said the de
monstration, planned for the center of Madrid to
day, was illegal and would be prohibited.
The attempt at a show of strength by the nation's
two biggest political fronts, both leftist-controlled,
was a clear bid to embarrass the king and the new
govrnment, perhaps with bloodshed.
Premier Carlos Arias Navarro blamed the unrest
on subversion and said the government was ready

to use all its power to smash it.
Hearst wins new hearing
SAN FRANCISCO — Patricia Hearst's attorneys

rist she accused last week of driving her to the point
of tears with insulting questions.
Johnson said the 21-year-old defendant would
attend the hearing, but he did not say whether she
would testify, as she had done during a two-day
hearing last week. He would not elaborate on what
the new evidence was.

Court approves primary plan
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yesterday
cleared the way for a winner-take-all battle between
President Ford and Republican challenger Ronald
Reagan for California's 167 convention delegates in
the June 8 primary election.
In a brief order, the justices unanimously af
firmed a lower court order that the California sys
tem is constitutional and remains in effect this year.
The court issued no written opinion to elaborate
on its decision.
By refusing to disturb the winner-take-all proce
dure, the court left Ford and Reagan to fight for the.
largest bloc of convention delegates from any state.
—Refused to review the convictions of the Wil
mington Ten, nine black men and a white woman
who were charged in connection with a fire at a
small white-owned grocery store in a black
neighborhood of Wilmington, N.C., during racial
disturbances there in February, 1971. Their prison
sentences ranged from a ten-year maximum for
Ann Shepard to 31 years for two of the youths.
—Refused to reconsider its 24-year-old ruling
that public schools constitutionally may allow
children time off during the school day to attend
religious classes away from the school grounds.
—Declined to reconsider its November decision
upholding a desegregation order which could re
quire busing between the predominantly black city
schools and predominantly white suburban
schools of Wilmington, Del.

Africans hold secret talks
ZAMBIA — Moderate African states were hold
ing secret talks yesterday in a new initiative to
bring peace to war-torn Angola, reliable sources
here reported.
The sources said states taking part in the talks
sought a coalition government and the withdrawal
of all foreign troops to end the civil war which has
ravaged the oil-and-mineral-rich former Por
tuguese colony since last August.
The African initiative coincided with U.S. Sec
retary of State Henry Kissinger's preparations for
talks in Moscow on Angola as well as strategic arms

limitation.
Sources in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, said the
African states plan to create a government of na
tional unity by merging the Marxist Popular

Syrian troops in Lebanon?
BEIRUT — Interior Minister Camille Chamoun
accused Syria of sending troops into Lebanon yes
terday and a police spokesman reported a massive
influx of Palestinian guerrillas into the country
from Syria.

Palestinians may have crossed the Syrian border
into Lebanon, which has been torn for nine months
by civil war between Moslem and Christian fac
tions.
Chamoun, a Christian, said, "This intervention
threatens this spot >n the Middle East with a new
war and also endangers international peace ... In
my capacity as interior minister I instruct Leba

inform the Security Council about what is going on
in Lebanon."
Spain drafts more workers
MADRID — King Juan Carlos drafted 120,000
more Spanish workers into military service yester
day in an attempt to stem fresh labor and political
unrest and avert a nationwide rail strike.
Anti-government forces ranging from Com
munists to moderates responded by preparing a
protest march to demand national elections to de
cide the country's form of government.
Government and police officials said the de
monstration, planned for the center of Madrid to
day, was illegal and would be prohibited.
The attempt at a show of strength by the nation's
two biggest political fronts, both leftist-controlled,
was a clear bid to embarrass the king and the new
govrnment, perhaps with bloodshed.
Premier Carlos Arias Navarro blamed the unrest
on subversion and said the government was ready

to use all its power to smash it.
