# Bellow: 'I write to purge my mind'
## 
### ROSARIO DELATORRE 
"lama writer, Americanand Jewish,
in that order," author Saul Bellow told
an audience of about 45 persons in the
Twain House lounge last night. "I
write for as many people as possible; I
want to be read by as many people as
possible, but on my own terms.
"As a writer, you must feel that what
you are saying is significant and that it
is needed and has to be said," he con
tinued. "You should tell people what
you want to tell them."
Bellow said his novels are mostly
imagination, but that he uses real life
as his model. "You lean on life and the
people that you've known," he
explained.
He used his latest novel, Humboldt's
Gift, as an example. "It's the story of
the life of an artist in the U.S., why he
became mad and his self-destruction,"
he explained. "I've known people like
that."
Not a commercial writer
Bellow said he did not consider
himself a commercial writer, which he
defined as a writer who knows what
his book is going to be about before he
writes it.
When he writes a novel, he does not
know how it will end, until he finishes
it, Bellow said. "When I'm writing, I'm
thinking about the characters and the
ideas — not about what the public will
think about the novel," he said.
Bellow said most people are terribly
dissatisfied with ordinary life and do
not want to read about it. "One of the
discoveries of modern literature is that
life is not so ordinary." he said.
Pleasure and pain
Literature contains a certain amount
of pleasure as well as pain, he added.
"Pleasure in literature is nothing to be
ashamed of; it is missing from a great
deal of modern writing and
philosophy."
But the purpose of literature and
philosophy should not be confused, he
said. "The business of philosophy is to
study life; it is not the business of liter
ature to study philosophy."
He described literary critics as
commercial writers. "Book reviewers
are not true lovers of the art; their

career is business, some are pure, but
most are not," he explained.
When Bellow was asked why he
writes, he said writing had the effect of
purging or curing the consciousness.
He explained this was the "effect" of
writing, not the "reason" he writes.
"Why should I perform the function
and have the rationale also? I don't
think I should. I write for myself."
Bellow's visit is sponsored by the
Office of Residential Education. He
will be at Grove House tonight after
dinner and will do readings Thursday
night at a location to be announced.
