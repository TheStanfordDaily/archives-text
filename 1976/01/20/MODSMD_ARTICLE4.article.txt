# $10 billion tax cut needed, Ford says
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AF) — President
Ford proposed last night a $10 billion
bonus tax cut effective July 1 in a
campaign-year State of the Union ad
dress that pledged both frugality and a
drive to put jobless Americans back to
work.
Ford told Congress and a nation
wide television and radio audience
that it is time for "a new realism" in
America, and for the continuation of
his policies.
Ford said the year just past proves
that the direction he proposed was the
right direction — one of partnership
among government, private institu
tions and individual citizens.
"The state of our union is better, in
many ways a lot better, but still not
good enough," Ford said to applause.
Hard decisions
Ford said it also was a year of hard
decisions, difficult compromises and a
new realism, one that brought "a
needed measure of common sense,
steadfastness and self-discipline.
"Common sense tells me to stick to
that steady course," he said.
Ford's tax cut and budget limit
proposals foretold a new round of de
bate with the Democrats who control
both the Senate and the House.
Reagan proposal
His message also included a clear
reference to the more drastic budget
cutting proposal made by Ronald
Reagan, his Republican presidential
challenger. Reagan advocates the
gradual transfer of more than $90 bill
ion in federal programs to the states —
if they choose to keep them going.
But Ford said, "We cannot simply
dump welfare into the laps of the 50
states, their local taxpayers or private
charities, and just walk away from it."
In effect, Ford reassembled the $28
billion tax-and-spending cut plan the
Democratic Congress refused to buy,
and put it back on the political agenda
for 1976.
Tax reduction
He did so by proposing a new tax
reduction of $10 billion, to be added to
$18 billion already approved by Con
gress. Those are annual rates.
At the same time, the President said
the budget he will send Congress to
morrow will total $394.2 billion. He
had asked Congress to impose a $395

billion spending ceiling next year, but
that was rejected in December
The Republican President told the
Democratic Congress — home of a
corps of presidential challengers —
that he has the nation on course.
"And up the separate pieces of prog
ress in 1975, subtract the setbacks, and
the sum total shows that we are not
only headed in the new direction I
proposed 12 months ago, but that it
turned out to be the right direction,"
he said.
Ford said he means to stick to that
"steady course" in the economy and in
general.
Tax laws change
Among his specific proposals:
—A change in federal tax laws to
encourage plant expansion and
equipment purchases, concentrating
"this job creation tax incentive" in
areas where unemployment now ex
ceeds seven percent. He did not spell
out the terms of the legislation, but it
clearly would involve an increase
in the investment tax credit. The na
tional unemployment rate is 8.3 per
cent.

—Housing assistance for 500,000
families, to spur construction and help
low and moderate income families.
There were no details of that plan in
the Ford address.
—A limited national health insur
ance plan, to guarantee that nobody
over 65 will have to pay more than
$750 a year for medical care.
Social Security increase
—An increase in social security
taxes of six-tenths of one percent, half
to be paid by workers and half by
employers. The total would be $1.2
billion.
—A "Broadened Stock Ownership
Plan" under which low and middle
income workers would invest for at
least seven years in mutual funds or
common stocks, with contributions to
be deductible from taxable income and
the proceeds to be taxed only when
withdrawn from the plan.
Ford said he could not recommend
major welfare program changes
"while we are still recovering from a
recession." And he said the nation
"cannot realistically afford federally
dictated national health insurance."
