# Activist proposes movement revival

### ALEXANDER LEFF JOHN ROOS 
Declaring that "because the institu
tions have not changed, the basic prob
lems have not changed," David De
llinger, anti-war activist and former
Chicago 7 defendant, called for a re
newal of the reform movements of the
19605.
"The old struggle continues. It's st-il
a question of the corporate economy —
whether people believe that the high
est goal of individuals and society is to
serve the profit motive and to rise
above their fellows rather than rise
with them."
Dellinger spoke at Cubberley Au
ditorium before an audience of about
250, as a part of Disorientation Week,
sponsored by the Alliance for Radical
Change. He dismissed allegations of
the rising conservatism of today's col
lege students.
"Everybody's just fragmented — we
are all concerned with our own move
ments whether it is the women's
movement, the black movement, or the
ecology movement. But all of these
fragments make a whole," Dellinger
said.
Movement's adolescence
"The movement is currently in
adolescence," Dellinger declared."lt is
awkward and confused — but it is a
stage of growth and not regression."
Dellinger criticized what he termed
the American attitude toward democ
racy. "If you elect leaders who become
tyrants, it is all right since we elected
them," he said.
Dellinger was cynical at times last
night about the anti-war movement of
the '60s. "The only respectability in
politics is power," he said, "and men
like Eugene McCarthy got it hitching
onto the peace movement."

"The left should do away with
power," Dellinger stated, "instead of
grabbing it. Politics is degrading."
CIA investigations
Although he termed as tragic the as
sasination of CIA agent Richard
Welch, Dellinger said hehad disclosed
the name of the CIA agent in charge of
American involvement in Angola in a
speech in Washington, D.C., earlier
yesterday.
On a recent investigation of the CIA,
Dellinger said, "If the CIA could kill
foreign leaders with whom they disag
ree, then I do not believe that they will
draw the line at domestic leaders and
say, well, its all right to kill (Congo
Premier Patrice) Lumumba but not
Martin Luther King."
"A cynical conception of human na
ture has become the main theme of
American society," Dellinger added.
"Yet we can live without the maniacal
ego which drives us to believe that our
country has to be number one, and we,
as individuals, have to be number one
— even in our sexual relationships."
Movements necessary
Dellinger declared "radicals have a
dangerous tendency to dismiss medi
tation and other human-potential
movements." In his view, these
movements are "necessary and heal
thy. They help to bring the personal
and the political together."
One light moment in the speech
came when Dellinger recalled asking a
radical Native American whether he
was a Marxist-Leninist. The Native
American retorted, "I prefer not to de
fine my politics in European terms."
The audience reaction was mixed.
Dellinger's speech was interrupted by
applause several times. But, as De
llinger himself commented, "Five
