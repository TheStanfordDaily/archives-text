## Mexico 
### 
Recognizing the importance of a Stanford campus in
a Third World language culture area, we find the idea
of a campus in Mexico intriguing.
Mexico's proximity to the Palo Alto campus
makes it an inviting location for the establishment of
such a campus. With transportation costs rising by
huge leaps, a Mexico campus might be a good way to
reduce expenses.
The influx of Mexicans to this country
accentuates the importance of maintaining close rela
tions with Mexico.
Although the advantages of a campus in Mexico are
many, maintaining our present campuses overseas is
of great importance. The Overseas Studies program is
an attraction of Stanford which its competitors haven't
been able to equal.
The opportunity to study abroad in any of five
language-culture areas is an unbeatable part of a Stan
ford education.
We, therefore, are intrigued by the prospect of a
campus in Mexico, but it should not be established at
the cost of another overseas campus. The loss of
Beutelsbach this year pointedly shows the financial
struggles of the programs.
A complete analysis of the benefits and costs of a
Mexican campus must precede any planning for such a
campus.
