# Guest profs

It was recently reported the ASSU Guest Professor
ship Board had sent inquiries to approximately 35
persons regarding their availability to teach here
spring quarter.
Former President Richard Nixon was one of the
people mentioned as a possible guest professor and
many members of the Stanford community have been
quick to express their opposition to his consideration.
Some have also faulted the board for sending in
quiries to all the candidates, rather than trying each
one at a time. But the board was not as rash as some
students have contended.
There is still nearly $10,000 available to finance a
professor, or several part-time professors, and we feel it
was intelligent for the board to sound out as many
people as possible ai the same time, saving both time
and money .The inquiries were notoutright invitations,
so no commitments have been made yet by anyone.
As to the individuals chosen as possibilities, in
quiries were sent to every person suggested as a guest
professor by students, professors and members of the
Board. Nixon was just one of the group, which in
cluded Angela Davis, I.F. Stone and Allan Ginsberg.
It is premature to start protesting even the possibility
of Nixon's getting a job here. If any of them do indica
tean interest in the post, the board will make recom
mendations to the ASSU Senate, which has final word
in the selection.
This action is probably at least a month away. And
then, if Nixon's name is still being kicked around,
people can get in touch with the ASSU Senators to
lobby for their views.
