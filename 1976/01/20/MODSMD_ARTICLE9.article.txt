# Postal Service: a free-market solution

### 
"These men will not be hin
dered from accomplishing the
distance they have to go either
by snow, or rain, or heat, or by
the darkness of night."
When Herodotus issued those
words in the fifth century 8.C.,
he hadn't reckoned with one fac
tor in U.S. mail service: ineffi
ciency. Although U.S. postmen
rarely fail to complete their
rounds, because of the service's
rampant inefficiency a tremend
ous volume of mail every year is
misdelivered or delayed.
But inefficiency is merely the
tip of the Postal Service's prob
lems. At the base of its shortcom
ings is its monopoly over first
class mail.
Present postal regulations
allow no private concern to de
liver first-class mail. The prime
reason for these regulations
faside from allowing a marked
degree of inefficiency — a
reason the Postal Sevice would
of course fervently disavow) is
because of the rate structure now
in effect.
1975 report
Seymour YVenner, chief ad
ministrative law judge for the
rate-setting Postal Rate Commis
sion, issued a report in June 1975
stating that two cents of every
10-cent first-class stamp went to
subsidize non-first-class mail.
And as the recent rate increase
raised first-class mail rates more
than the rates for other classes of
mail, it follows that subsidiza
tion of second-class, third-class
and fourth-class mail has in
creased.
Because of the subsidy cost
added to first-class mail rates,
these rates are inflated over what
a private concern would have to
charge to deliver first-class mail
(even assuming all costs were
the same). Consequently, as long
as first-class rates subsidize other
mail classes, competition for this
mail cannot be allowed, it is ar
gued.
But besides its inefficiency,
forcing first-class mail users to
subsidize users of other mail
classes is unfair.
In opposition to the preference
given non-first-class mail, 11
states filed suit Oct. 29, 1975, to
reverse the recently im
plemented price boost. These

states recognized the inequity of
postal rates — an inequity which
has existed far too long.
Why subsidize?
Why should first-class mail
users be forced to pay for other
people's shipments of
magazines, books and goods

through the mail? Why not let
everyone assume the.cost of his
mail use?
And as people who send a
large amount of first-class mail
probably are those who are also
the principle of the other
mail classes, one cannot argue
(as some might be tempted to)
the government is performing a
transfer of wealth from one class
to another. What is really hap
pening is first-class users
who don't order many
magazines, books and parcels
are subsidizing others in their
income class who do.
What justification is there for
such a government transfer? I
would contend, none. The ans
wer. then, to the Postal Service's
chronic inefficiency and in
equity is to adjust postal rates
until they reflect the true cost of
mailing an item, and open
up first-class mail to private bus
iness.
With competition in all facets
of mail delivery, the Postal Ser
vice will be forced to become a
cost-effective business. As it
now stands, the Postal Service
will incur a $1.8 billion deficit
by next June 30, the end of its
fiscal year — and this despite
$920,000 in aid Congress is still
giving the service.
Low rates
Lest such deficits only be at
tributed to rates which have
been set below the minimum
cost of sending mail, it should
be noted companies in competi
tion for second- through fourth
class mail have been able to de
liver for less than the service,

even with the Postal Service's
artificially-depressed rates for
these classes.
Wenner proposed a reform
similar to the one 1 have out
lined. Headvocated cutting rates
for first-class mail to eight
and-a-half cents, while increas
ing the rates of other classes
until they covered the Services
approximate costs for mailing
these classes.
Admittedly, increases in
second-class and fourth-class
rates would have to be steep;
many magazines and book dis
tributors protested Wenner's
proposal on grounds it would
raise their costs so much they
would be forced to quit operation
But it should be added that
magazines which pre-sort mail
by zip code should pay less than
magazines which don't.
Wenner's. critics haven't con
sidered the effects of competi
tion for mail delivery, though.
When second-class, third

class and fourth-class mail were
opened to competition in 1963,
an immediate scramble ensued
for customers mail. Between
1963 and 1973, the Postal Ser
vice lost over 40 percent of its
parcel-post volume to private
competitors.
This is evidence private com
panies entering the market could
have a profound effect on lower
ing postal prices we must pay.
And as reported in Business
Week, a number of private com
panies are now forming to offer
magazines alternative ways of
delivery. ,
If all the above factors were
taken into account, it is evident
most magazines would remain
financially solvent.
And if some don't, why should
they be kept alive through a gov
erment subsidy, such as they
presently are receiving?
