### LORI MATSUKAWA 
A pipe bomb exploded in an isolated
bathroom on the Stanford Golf Course
late Monday night but caused no in
jury or fire.
The bomb blast, which occurred at
about 10 or 10:30 p.m. "distorted" the
facility and "lifted the roof off the
walls about 2-3 inches," said Tom
Thatcher, golf course superintendent.
Damages were estimated at "$l5OO
and up," according to Thatcher.
The San Mateo County Sheriff's Of
fice is investigating the case but no
motive or suspects have been found.
Lt. Nino Loschivao of the organized
crime division offered "no specula
tions" as to who might have caused the
explosion.
'Still checking'
"We're still checking with people in
the area," Loschivao said. The nearest
residents are about a quarter of a mile
from the wooded bomb site which ad
joins the 13th fairway near Rural Lane
and Alpine Road, according to Los
chivao.
"The foundation is still there and
the walls are standing," said Thatcher
"though the building is distorted be
cause the walls have been exploded
out a couple inches."
The facility was about 10-foot square
and housed restrooms.
"The bomb was placed on one side
ofthebuilding. Itblewoutthe window
frame on that side completely. The
plumbing on both sides has been de
stroyed," said Thatcher.
Although the bomb was placed on
only one side of the building, consid
erable damage was incurred on the
otherside. Thatcher cited cracked wall
timbers and porcelain fixtures as most
heavily damaged.
Structural damage
Damage was earlier estimated at
about $750. However, Loschivao
commented, "My estimate would be
that the damages were more than
$1500. Considering the cost of hiring
plumbers, it would be more than
$750."
Thatcher agreed saying, "I would
say $1500 and up would be a more
liberal estimate."
Much of the structural damage is
within the walls of the facility "and
from 50 yards out, you can't notice any
damage. But if you go close to the
building, you notice how much one
side of the roof is lifted off the frame,"
said Thatcher.
"This is the first time a bomb went
off at Stanford this year," said Los
chivao.
The site of the bombing was just in
side San Mateo County.
