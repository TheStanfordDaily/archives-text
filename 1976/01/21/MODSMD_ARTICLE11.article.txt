# Reagan's idea has merit
## 
### 
On the surface, Ronald Reagan's prop
osed $90 billion cut in federal spending
sounds absurd. There is, however, much
merit in the idea behind Reagan's proposal
to transfer more political power to the states
and localities.
Through spending cuts, Reagan proposes
to place the responsibility for most of the
nation's social programs in the hands of
state and local officials. He believes that the
federal bureaucracy is not responsive to
changing social needs, a valid contention.
Of course, it is true that the federal gov
ernment has created many new social prog
rams in response to the nation's needs. Un
fortunately, many of these programs have
outlived their usefulness or become
porkbarrels for special interests.
A classic example of this fossilization of
bureaucracy is the Army Corps of En
gineers, which played a major part in na
tional development at a time when many
felt that such development was felt neces
sary.
National mood
But the national mood has become more
ecologically oriented while the Corps has
not. The Army Corps of Engineers still in
sists that the only good river is a dammed
(or damned) river.
In addition to programs such as the Corps,
there is a plethora of federal regulatory
agencies, many left over from the days of
Teddy Roosevelt, which still promote
philosophies that were outmoded years ago.
These regulatory agencies have become the
tools of existing corporations, stifling com
petition and discouraging innovation.
Proof of the comradeship between oligar
chies and the regulatory apparatus is the
uproar that went up in many industries
when President Ford proposed curtailment
and abolition of many of these agencies. It is
also notable that no new major airlines have
been licensed since the creation of the Civil
Aeronautics Board.

It is probably true that a cut in this federal
role, particularly in the area of social prog
rams, would hurt states with smaller re
venue bases upon which to draw for taxes.
But nothing says this cannot be compen
sated for by a system of revenue sharing
which would minimize federal interference
in state and local affairs.

It is an article of faith among the Ameri
can people that the federal bureaucracy is
too big and too inefficient. Polls show that
big government is considered by voters to
be the most important national issue behind
inflation and unemployment.
Ironically, it is this very slowness that can
make the federal bureaucracy a viable in
strument of national policy. Because the
federal bureaucracy is resistant to change, it
can be a vehicle for the protection of minor
ity rights.
Welfare program
For example, a federalized welfare prog
ram, if it were of proven effectivenss and did
not bog down in too much red tape, would
be the best assurance to blacks in Alabama
that George Wallace could not cut off their
only means of subsistance.
This same sloth and inefficiency in adopt
ing new methods can also insure the per
petuation of sound programs. If the
bureaucracy prevents the reform of bad
programs, then it also prevents the elimina

tion of good ones.
Thus, the federal government, because of
its slowness to change, can institutionalize
worthwhile programs. The states and
localities, because they are closer to the
people and smaller in scope, can innovate
and change easily when their experimenta
tion fails.
Unfortunately, history has reversed the
roles of the states and the federal govern
ment. The states have been perceived as
backward and provincial, and the federal
government has consequently taken the
lead in innovation, becoming bogged down
in what is left of the New Deal and the Great
Society.
Reverse roles
Governmental roles should be reversed.
States and localities should be the in
novators in social policy because they can
more easily change directions than the fed
eral government. The federal government
should be primarily concerned with the
protection of minority rights and the in
stitution and pepetuation of sound, proven
programs.
This is the idea behind Reagan's tax cut
proposal. He wants to eliminate the "in
novative" social programs and special in
terest porkbarrels frozen into the federal
bureaucracy, and let the states fund those
programs they consider worthwhile.
If Reagan's idea were adopted, the federal
bureaucracy would still obstruct change,
but only in programs which are already
proven effective or in areas where indi
vidual rights may be threatened. The states
would become the cutting edge of a newage
of social innovation.
Although Reagan may have bumbled in
presenting his proposal, and although the
media may have distorted it, the basic idea
is a good one.
