# Lessons of the EDP debate
## Chris Elms 
### 
At the end of last quarter, the
controversy over Ex
tradepartmental Programs (EDP)
was in large part resolved. Al
most simultaneously, the
machinery was created to find a
replacement for the controver
sy's central figure, Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies James
Gibbs.
Both matters deserve more at
tention than they have received.
The Faculty Senate, at the re
commendation of its Committee
on Undergraduate Studies (C
-US), agreed to extend EDP's
until January 1979. The only real
debate on the subject occurred in
C-US.
In that debate, C-US rejected a
proposal by the SWOPSI Policy
Board to abolish the limit on the
number of EDP units that may
count towards graduation.
Gibbs' agreement
In supporting continuation of
the programs, Gibbs indicated
his agreement with almost all
the major recommendatins made
by last spring's ad hoc panel on
EDP's, chaired by Biology Prof.
Donald Kennedy.
Specifically: Gibbs agreed that
for the forseeable future EDP's
should be separate from one
another and ought not to be ab
sorbed into departments. Gibbs
also said EDP's should be
guaranteed adequate funding
until January 1979.
Additionally, Gibbs agreed to
back a bold new experiment —
student co-directors for SWOPSI
and SCIRE.
There are several lessons to be
learned from the EDP con
troversy.
First, the approval given the

programs was to some ejctent
grudging; they are still subject to
enormous suspicion.
This was evidenced by the
C-US-imposed unit limit and by
a brief colloquy between Assoc.
Chemistry Prof. Andersen, vice
chairman of the Faculty Senate,
and Assoc. English Prof David
Riggs. Riggs argued unsuccess
fully that the programs are now
of sufficient respectability that
perhaps they need not be so
closely scrutinized as they had
been in their infancy.
Second, the controversy de
monstrated clearly that students
can have a positive impact on
policy. However, an enormous
amount of energy had to be in
vested by a large number of stu
dents simply to prevent demise
of three small programs.
EDP's did serve as rallying
points for expression of broad
undergraduate concern over
Stanford's increasing emphasis
on graduate studies and re
search. However, the EDP con
troversy also diverted student
energy away from an assault on
more fundamental and complex
problems.
Tenure issue
Chief among these is tenure.
So far as can be determined, no
group of students has yet consi
dered addressing the tenure
issue as thoroughly as the EDP
issue was addressed.
Given the budget crisis, and in
the absence of considerable
drafting of thoughtful proposals,
organization and agitation by
students and faculty members,
one can look forward this year to
another parade of tenure horrors
to rival that of last year. And the
parade has already begun: three

sociology professors, including
a Gores Award winner, were re
cently denied tenure.
Third, EDP's are not totally
safe from harm. The ad hoc panel
report made clear Gibbs' ill
conceived plan could be re
vived, or the programs could at a
later date be dissolved under the
guise of placing them into de
partments.
The fourth lesson stems from
the other three. Choosing Gibbs'
successor is the most crucial de
cision regarding undergraduate
education at Stanford to be made
by a committee since I've been
here.
The person chosen must be a
committed advocate of innova
tion in undergraduate education
at Stanford. Unfortunately, there
exists no other officer in the
University charged with being
such an advocate.
Repeat performance
If the new dean must be
strongly committed to actively
seeking out the opinions of un
dergraduates. The person
should also be strongly commit
ted to delegating purely
administrative/managerial
duties of the office to subordi
nates.
The structure of the office is
such the new dean could easily
be swallowed up in overseeing
the various programs contained
within the Office of the Director
of Undergraduate Studies
(ODUS). If the person allows this
to happen, advocacy functions
will simply go unperformed.
Realizing students may not
have the time or clout to lobby
for changes in, for example, the
area of tenure, the new dean
must be willing to spend a good

deal of time devising and push
ing for such changes.
In short: the new dean must
see his/her role as that of organiz
ing innovative programs and
explaining and defending those
and other student-oriented prog
rams to less-informed and skep
tical colleagues. He must also
fight for needed changes in the
University's policies affecting
undergraduates and encourage
subordinates to creatively ad
minister and assist the programs
for which ODUS has responsibil
ity.

Chief among these is tenure.
So far as can be determined, no
group of students has yet consi
dered addressing the tenure
issue as thoroughly as the EDP
issue was addressed.
Given the budget crisis, and in
the absence of considerable
drafting of thoughtful proposals,
organization and agitation by
students and faculty members,
one can look forward this year to
another parade of tenure horrors
to rival that of last year. And the
parade has already begun: three

sociology professors, including
a Gores Award winner, were re
cently denied tenure.
Third, EDP's are not totally
safe from harm. The ad hoc panel
report made clear Gibbs' ill
conceived plan could be re
vived, or the programs could at a
later date be dissolved under the
guise of placing them into de
partments.
The fourth lesson stems from
the other three. Choosing Gibbs'
successor is the most crucial de
cision regarding undergraduate
education at Stanford to be made
by a committee since I've been
here.
The person chosen must be a
committed advocate of innova
tion in undergraduate education
at Stanford. Unfortunately, there
exists no other officer in the
University charged with being
such an advocate.
Repeat performance
If the new dean must be
strongly committed to actively
seeking out the opinions of un
dergraduates. The person
should also be strongly commit
ted to delegating purely
administrative/managerial
duties of the office to subordi
nates.
The structure of the office is
such the new dean could easily
be swallowed up in overseeing
the various programs contained
within the Office of the Director
of Undergraduate Studies
(ODUS). If the person allows this
to happen, advocacy functions
will simply go unperformed.
Realizing students may not
have the time or clout to lobby
for changes in, for example, the
area of tenure, the new dean
must be willing to spend a good

deal of time devising and push
ing for such changes.
In short: the new dean must
see his/her role as that of organiz
ing innovative programs and
explaining and defending those
and other student-oriented prog
rams to less-informed and skep
tical colleagues. He must also
fight for needed changes in the
University's policies affecting
undergraduates and encourage
subordinates to creatively ad
minister and assist the programs
for which ODUS has responsibil
ity.

At the end of last quarter, the
controversy over Ex
tradepartmental Programs (EDP)
was in large part resolved. Al
most simultaneously, the
machinery was created to find a
replacement for the controver
sy's central figure, Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies James
Gibbs.
Both matters deserve more at
tention than they have received.
The Faculty Senate, at the re
commendation of its Committee
on Undergraduate Studies (C
-US), agreed to extend EDP's
until January 1979. The only real
debate on the subject occurred in
C-US.
In that debate, C-US rejected a
proposal by the SWOPSI Policy
Board to abolish the limit on the
number of EDP units that may
count towards graduation.
Gibbs' agreement
In supporting continuation of
the programs, Gibbs indicated
his agreement with almost all
the major recommendatins made
by last spring's ad hoc panel on
EDP's, chaired by Biology Prof.
Donald Kennedy.
Specifically: Gibbs agreed that
for the forseeable future EDP's
should be separate from one
another and ought not to be ab
sorbed into departments. Gibbs
also said EDP's should be
guaranteed adequate funding
until January 1979.
Additionally, Gibbs agreed to
back a bold new experiment —
student co-directors for SWOPSI
and SCIRE.
There are several lessons to be
learned from the EDP con
troversy.
First, the approval given the

programs was to some ejctent
grudging; they are still subject to
enormous suspicion.
This was evidenced by the
C-US-imposed unit limit and by
a brief colloquy between Assoc.
Chemistry Prof. Andersen, vice
chairman of the Faculty Senate,
and Assoc. English Prof David
Riggs. Riggs argued unsuccess
fully that the programs are now
of sufficient respectability that
perhaps they need not be so
closely scrutinized as they had
been in their infancy.
Second, the controversy de
monstrated clearly that students
can have a positive impact on
policy. However, an enormous
amount of energy had to be in
vested by a large number of stu
dents simply to prevent demise
of three small programs.
EDP's did serve as rallying
points for expression of broad
undergraduate concern over
Stanford's increasing emphasis
on graduate studies and re
search. However, the EDP con
troversy also diverted student
energy away from an assault on
more fundamental and complex
problems.

was in large part resolved. Al
most simultaneously, the
machinery was created to find a
replacement for the controver
sy's central figure, Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies James
Gibbs.
Both matters deserve more at
tention than they have received.
The Faculty Senate, at the re
commendation of its Committee
on Undergraduate Studies (C
-US), agreed to extend EDP's
until January 1979. The only real
debate on the subject occurred in
C-US.
In that debate, C-US rejected a
proposal by the SWOPSI Policy
Board to abolish the limit on the
number of EDP units that may
count towards graduation.
Gibbs' agreement
In supporting continuation of
the programs, Gibbs indicated
his agreement with almost all
the major recommendatins made
by last spring's ad hoc panel on
EDP's, chaired by Biology Prof.
Donald Kennedy.
Specifically: Gibbs agreed that
for the forseeable future EDP's
should be separate from one
another and ought not to be ab
sorbed into departments. Gibbs
also said EDP's should be
guaranteed adequate funding
until January 1979.
Additionally, Gibbs agreed to
back a bold new experiment —
student co-directors for SWOPSI
and SCIRE.
There are several lessons to be
learned from the EDP con
troversy.
First, the approval given the

programs was to some ejctent
grudging; they are still subject to
enormous suspicion.
This was evidenced by the
C-US-imposed unit limit and by
a brief colloquy between Assoc.
Chemistry Prof. Andersen, vice
chairman of the Faculty Senate,
and Assoc. English Prof David
Riggs. Riggs argued unsuccess
fully that the programs are now
of sufficient respectability that
perhaps they need not be so
closely scrutinized as they had
been in their infancy.
Second, the controversy de
monstrated clearly that students
can have a positive impact on
policy. However, an enormous
amount of energy had to be in
vested by a large number of stu
dents simply to prevent demise
of three small programs.
EDP's did serve as rallying
points for expression of broad
undergraduate concern over
Stanford's increasing emphasis
on graduate studies and re
search. However, the EDP con
troversy also diverted student
energy away from an assault on
more fundamental and complex
problems.
Tenure issue
Chief among these is tenure.
So far as can be determined, no
group of students has yet consi
dered addressing the tenure
issue as thoroughly as the EDP
issue was addressed.
Given the budget crisis, and in
the absence of considerable
drafting of thoughtful proposals,
organization and agitation by
students and faculty members,
one can look forward this year to
another parade of tenure horrors
to rival that of last year. And the
parade has already begun: three

sociology professors, including
a Gores Award winner, were re
cently denied tenure.
Third, EDP's are not totally
safe from harm. The ad hoc panel
report made clear Gibbs' ill
conceived plan could be re
vived, or the programs could at a
later date be dissolved under the
guise of placing them into de
partments.
The fourth lesson stems from
the other three. Choosing Gibbs'
successor is the most crucial de
cision regarding undergraduate
education at Stanford to be made
by a committee since I've been
here.
The person chosen must be a
committed advocate of innova
tion in undergraduate education
at Stanford. Unfortunately, there
exists no other officer in the
University charged with being
such an advocate.
Repeat performance
If the new dean must be
strongly committed to actively
seeking out the opinions of un
dergraduates. The person
should also be strongly commit
ted to delegating purely
administrative/managerial
duties of the office to subordi
nates.
The structure of the office is
such the new dean could easily
be swallowed up in overseeing
the various programs contained
within the Office of the Director
of Undergraduate Studies
(ODUS). If the person allows this
to happen, advocacy functions
will simply go unperformed.
Realizing students may not
have the time or clout to lobby
for changes in, for example, the
area of tenure, the new dean
must be willing to spend a good

deal of time devising and push
ing for such changes.
In short: the new dean must
see his/her role as that of organiz
ing innovative programs and
explaining and defending those
and other student-oriented prog
rams to less-informed and skep
tical colleagues. He must also
fight for needed changes in the
University's policies affecting
undergraduates and encourage
subordinates to creatively ad
minister and assist the programs
for which ODUS has responsibil
ity.
