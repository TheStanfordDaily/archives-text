# Theme houses
## Laura Antonelli 
### 
When 1 read about the prop
osal for a Jewish theme house in
the Jan. 14 Daily, I was really
bothered, and I spent some time
trying to figure out why.
My first reaction was to think
that we could make just about
every University dorm and
house a theme house. After all,
Italians could demand to unite to
protect themselves against all
the Italian jokes, while at the
same time being able to eat
spaghetti and lasagne almost as
good as their dad's or mom's
home cooking.
Likewise, the Irish, Polish,
Greek and Native American stu
dents of the Stanford community
may want theme houses. Or we
could carry it even further by es
tablishing Catholic, Protestant
or Mormon theme houses.
I'm sure any nationality or re
ligious group could rationalize
the need for a theme house, but is
this what we "Americans"
want?
Comments
Because 1 come from Mas
sachusetts, I was barraged last
year with comments on "Those
animals in South Boston" or
"what bigots."
What gives us the right to
criticize people who are fighting
integration when we choose to
socially segregate blacks and
other minorities in this univer
sity?
How can we expect others to
be comfortable in an integrated
community when we at Stanford
make a conscious effort to be
segregated?
The buses and the rocks may
be missing, but the feelings seem
to be the same.
I realize that most students in
theme houses would rather be in
those theme houses than be
spread out in the University for
two important reasons:
1) They enjoy being with
people of their own culture; and
2) they want to preserve their
culture.
Preservation of culture
Most members of minority
groups have put great value on
preserving their culture, and I
have, in the past, respected this
desire. But perhaps there is a
goal that we should hold even
more valuable and even be wil
ling to make sacrifices for.
At the risk of sounding too
idealistic, the goal which I have
in mind is that of harmony bet
ween people of all races and re
ligions.
Today it is perfectly accepta
ble for an Italian to hire, marry,
orassociate with an Irish person.
Why is this so natural? It is
because through the years these
nationalities have relinquished
the cultures of their ancestors,
and become "Americanized."
I guess it is too unrealistic to
expect the blacks, Chicanos or
Asian Americans to give up their
theme houses in pursuit of a goal
that seems so unattainable, but I
do feel that the creation of other
theme houses based on national
ity or relgion should be discour
aged. Why should we further the
cause of segregation?
In closing I've something to
add to all the other bicentennial
garbage that's floating around:
America's "melting pot" must
be on very low heat, because it's
been two hundred years and it
still hasn't come close to melting
its ingredients.
