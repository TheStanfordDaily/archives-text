## Golf course clubhouse gets Vietnamese facelift From hot dog stand to Viet soup 
### JEFF PARIETTI 
Sy Bui-Quang is a man in a new country trying
to make good. Sy and his wife, Patricia, run a
fast-food service at the Stanford golf course
clubhouse.
The restaurant opened in November, replacing
a number of vending machines which usually
disappointed patrons with cold food. The diner
has been operated in the past, the last time about
two years ago.
Long-time manager, Mary Hooper, did a lot of
business with students and faculty, besides the
usual golfer clientele. After Hooper's retirement,
several others unsuccessfully tried to run the re
staurant and the service was discontinued.
Then last winter, Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
asked the golf committee to look into the need of
re-opening the restaurant, a need he thought still
existed.
Facelift
After a general renovation and installation of
new equipment, the Vietnamese couple were
signed to manage the diner.
The couple serves breakfasts and lunches, with
brunches on weekends. His specialty is a Viet
namese soup, made with rice, noodles, chicken
and shrimp.
Argus McDonald, a member of the golf commit
tee, says of the couple: "They're really trying to
make a go of it and are doing a pretty good job.
They're even getting back some of the campus
business that had been lost.
"The restaurant was formerly used as a great
stop on the Stanford recruiting tour," McDonald
adds. "John Ralston and Howie Dallmar used to
take their prospects to the place."
McDonald notes that some of the recruiting
stops are returning to the diner.

The Bui-Quangs say they are hoping to make
the restaurant work, with a return to a family type
operation.
The 40-year-old Sy left his native North Viet
nam in 1952 at the age of 15, and after a 17-hour
airplane flight, arrived in France. He finished
high school there, attended the University of
Paris, graduating with a math degree, and then
taught high school math for four years in France.
Sy also taught one year in Zaire under a
UNESCO program and spent four years as a
mathematician and production manager for a
French camping equipment company.
He met his wife in Paris in 1973 and they were
married in a Japanese temple in San Jose. They
returned to France, but Patricia didn't like it.
"The people weren't as friendly there as here,"
she says.
Censored mail
Sy and Patricia now reside in Mountain View.
His parents are still in North Vietnam. He says he
sometimes receives letters from them, which are
always censored. One of his brothers came to the
U.S. this summer and now lives in San Diego.
While in France, he played semi-pro soccer and
participated in tennis and ping-pong, although he
says,"I don't have time for these things now."
Before he got the go ahead to re-open the res
taurant, Sy operated a service at the 10th tee,
where he cooked hamburgers and hotdogs on a
barbecue and sold soft drinks and candy bars to
golfers. Golfers would hail from the ninth hole or
come by in their carts to order.
"Then everything would be ready when they
got to the 10th hole," Sy says with a grin.
This spring he says he hopes to hire some help
and then return to his outdoor service. "I like it
better outside. There's more for me to look at," he
adds.
