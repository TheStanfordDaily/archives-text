Are douches good for you or bad for you? What about vaginal
deodorant sprays like F.D.S.?
Most women don't need to douche at all. Their main purpose is to
help clear up recurrent infections, and Dr. John Dorman suggests
that a mixture of two tablespoons vinegar in a quart of water used
once a week is just as good as the commercial preparations. The
mixture is acidic so as not to upset the natural pH of the vagina.
Some people think douches can be used as contraceptives; this is
not the case. Any sperm that are going to do the job are into the
cervix already.
Vaginal sprays are controversial, and Dorman says he doesn't
believe that they are necessary. They can disrupt the natural or
ganisms and create more infections rather than help anything. If
there are any unnatural odors, you should find their cause, not
cover them up.

My girlfriend claims that she has gone to bed (separately) with two
men who each came seven times within about a half hour period. I
realize that quality, not quantity, is where it's at, but 1 think she has
no reason to exaggerate. While 1 don't expect to duplicate the feat,
and can't Hope to, what do you think about the credibility of this
claim? Incidentally, both lovers were from the Xlid-East.
Her claim sounds extremely dubious, to say the least. However, I
have been able to find no information that directly refutes the
possibility. According to Fundamentals of Human Sexuality, there
is a "refractory period" after orgasm, during which a man can't
respond to sexual stimulation, no matter how intense. However, its
precise length has never been determined. After the period, he can
theoretically achieve erection and orgasm again.
I haven't found any mention of the record number of times men
can do this in a half hour, although there is a reference in Forum
Magazine to a Simons Book of Sexual Records, which claims a
(precocious) 11-month old baby boy managed 14 orgasms in 38
minutes. Who knows?
At any rate, you need not feel inferior. Unless you're the only
man who hasn't come seven times in a half hour with her. By the
way — there's nothing stopping your girlfriend from having that
many. Women can have multiple orgasms in rapid succession. As
soon as each orgasm is over, the level of excitement can climb
immediatelv to another climax.
