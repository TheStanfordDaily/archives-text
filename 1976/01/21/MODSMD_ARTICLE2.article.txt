# Committee proposes aid based on need
## 
### GEORGE ANDERS 
Financial need should become a de
termining factor in setting the size of
certain graduate fellowships, accord
ing to a report by the Committee on
Graduate Studies.
The report, to be presented at tomor
row's Faculty Senate meeting, applies
only to University fellowships, which
are given in the humanities and social
sciences, according to Education Prof.
Henry Levin, a member of the commit
tee.
"We felt that we were increasingly
becoming non-competitive with other
institutions that were offering higher
stipends," Levin said.
The report calls for maximum fel
lowships to be raised several hundred
dollars from the present $2310. These
would be awarded to students with li
mited personal and parental financial
resources.
Appended to the report is a table of
approximate aid to graduate students
based on their personal or family fi
nancial resources. More affluent stu
dents would not receive stipends, and
some would be required to pay full
tuition. Thus the proposal anticipates
no additional expense to the Univer
sity.
Present fellowships are awarded
primarily on merit.
'Meritorious students'
Levin saw advantages to the prop
osed changes. "We aren't going to lose
wealthier students, and at the same
time we'll get the meritorious students
without resources," he said.
Three department chairman, how
ever, saw areas of concern in the re
port. Physics Prof. Walter Meyerhof,
Art Prof. Lorenz Eitner and Religious
Studies Prof. William Clebsch are cir
culating a statement among other de
partment chairmen urging that indi
vidual departments determine how
need wil 1 affect the size of fellowships.

"Different departments have diffe
rent problems," Meyerhof said, con
tending that "each department's com
petitive position with other univer
sities depends on how their depart
ments are doing."
Although Meyerhof does not yet
know how many chairmen have
signed the statement, he said, "I be
lieve the sentiment among most of
them is that they would prefer the kind
of proposal we outlined."
Flexibility
Some flexibility for departments is
written into the report, Levin main
tained. "We're giving the departments
the right to go plus or minus $200 on
some set amount for the fellowships."
Meyerhof also objected to a sugges
tion in the report that all fellowship
applicants be required to fill out the
Graduate and Professional School Fi
nancial Aid Service form in order to
determine how much support could
come from parents.
"Our opinion is that requiring a un
iform system of inquiry as to the re
sources of parents is not desirable," he
said.
Levin questioned how much say
each department should have in de
termining the size of University fel
lowships, saying that the $1.5 million
for the fellowships comes out of the
University's base budget, not from de
partment funds.
Recalling attempts to find other
ways of increasing the dollar amounts
of University fellowships, Levin said
the committee had considered raising
all fellowships to $2800, either by
drawing on more University funds or
reducing the total number of graduate
students.
"However, we realize we would get
low priority in requesting additional
money," Levin stated, "and cutting
back students would wreak havoc on
many departments."

each department should have in de
termining the size of University fel
lowships, saying that the $1.5 million
for the fellowships comes out of the
University's base budget, not from de
partment funds.
Recalling attempts to find other
ways of increasing the dollar amounts
of University fellowships, Levin said
the committee had considered raising
all fellowships to $2800, either by
drawing on more University funds or
reducing the total number of graduate
students.
"However, we realize we would get
low priority in requesting additional
money," Levin stated, "and cutting
back students would wreak havoc on
many departments."
Financial need should become a de
termining factor in setting the size of
certain graduate fellowships, accord
ing to a report by the Committee on
Graduate Studies.
The report, to be presented at tomor
row's Faculty Senate meeting, applies
only to University fellowships, which
are given in the humanities and social
sciences, according to Education Prof.
Henry Levin, a member of the commit
tee.
"We felt that we were increasingly
becoming non-competitive with other
institutions that were offering higher
stipends," Levin said.
The report calls for maximum fel
lowships to be raised several hundred
dollars from the present $2310. These
would be awarded to students with li
mited personal and parental financial
resources.
Appended to the report is a table of
approximate aid to graduate students
based on their personal or family fi
nancial resources. More affluent stu
dents would not receive stipends, and
some would be required to pay full
tuition. Thus the proposal anticipates
no additional expense to the Univer
sity.
Present fellowships are awarded
primarily on merit.
'Meritorious students'
Levin saw advantages to the prop
osed changes. "We aren't going to lose
wealthier students, and at the same
time we'll get the meritorious students
without resources," he said.
Three department chairman, how
ever, saw areas of concern in the re
port. Physics Prof. Walter Meyerhof,
Art Prof. Lorenz Eitner and Religious
Studies Prof. William Clebsch are cir
culating a statement among other de
partment chairmen urging that indi
vidual departments determine how
need wil 1 affect the size of fellowships.

"Different departments have diffe
rent problems," Meyerhof said, con
tending that "each department's com
petitive position with other univer
sities depends on how their depart
ments are doing."
Although Meyerhof does not yet
know how many chairmen have
signed the statement, he said, "I be
lieve the sentiment among most of
them is that they would prefer the kind
of proposal we outlined."
Flexibility
Some flexibility for departments is
written into the report, Levin main
tained. "We're giving the departments
the right to go plus or minus $200 on
some set amount for the fellowships."
Meyerhof also objected to a sugges
tion in the report that all fellowship
applicants be required to fill out the
Graduate and Professional School Fi
nancial Aid Service form in order to
determine how much support could
come from parents.
"Our opinion is that requiring a un
iform system of inquiry as to the re
sources of parents is not desirable," he
said.
Levin questioned how much say
each department should have in de
termining the size of University fel
lowships, saying that the $1.5 million
