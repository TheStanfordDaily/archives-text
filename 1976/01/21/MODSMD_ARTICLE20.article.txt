# Text of report from Committee on Reform and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford recommending new Western Culture course requirement, Honors in Liberal Studies option
## 
### 
Following is the text of a report from the Committee on
the Reform and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford,
submitted to Humanities and Sciences Dean Halsey Royden
Jan. 5, 1976. Royden has forwarded its recommendations to
the Committee on Undergraduate Studies, the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement, and the Policy Com
mittee of the School.
INTRODUCTION
The Committee on the Reform and Renewal of l.iberal
Education at Stanford met for six months. Time constraints
prevented the discussion of all the relevant issues, and certain
especially important issues that need to be discussed in the
near future by other University bodies are noted at this
report's end.
Five firm recommendations were made, however:
First is the institution of a Western Culture requirement
to be satisfied by taking a three-quarter sequence of courses
in one of several tracks. These courses would differ depend
ing on the discipline or disciplines employed, but all would
cover many of the important cultural creations and move
ments in Western civilization and, at least, sketch the social
and political history. The final decision on this recommenda
tion rests, of course, with the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (C-US) and the faculty Senate.
Second is the establishment of an advisory committee on
undergraduate education to the Dean of Humanities and
Sciences. This committee would be an operating and not a
policy committee, charged with advising the dean on how
best to employ fully the resources in Humanities and
Sciences for general undergraduate education.
Third is the replacement of the present scheme of
graduate distinction with three types of honors at gradua
tion: Honors in the Major, defined by the department but to
include a senior project or paper; Honors in Liberal Studies;
and University Honors, a combination of the first two.
Honors in Liberal Studies, the key aspect of the recom
mendation, is based not simply on performance but rather on
a prescribed set of courses and performance. The most
important of these prescribed courses, a University declara
tion of the basis for a sound liberal education, are:
mathematics through calculus, foreign language through one
course dealing with literature in that language, one course
dealing with a non-Western civilization, and cither a new
three-quarter honors freshman English or the regular two
quarter freshman English course plus one course dealing
primarily with literature originally written in English. A final
decision on this recommendation rests, of course, with the
Committee on Academic Appraisal and Achievement
(C-AAA) and the Faculty Senate.
The fourth recommendation is to compose and distribute
a statement on the general academic goals of Stanford, the
meaning of the distribution requirements, and the goals
sought by certain courses of study.
The fifth recommendation is for the institution of the
semester system to aid undergraduate education.
A sixth issue, a possible language and/or mathematics
requirement, was also discussed. No consensus was reached,
though a slim majority affirmed the desirability of requiring
either mathematics through calculus or one year of a foreign
language or the equivalent. A more detailed analysis of these
recommendations follows.
PREFACE
The task of the Committee on the Reform and Renewal
of Liberal Education at Stanford was, of course, a massive
one. Moreover, because the committee was instructed to
self-destruct within six months, time constraints prevented
the discussion of several issues of such importance that the
committee recommends they be discussed in the near future
by other University bodies.
Those 11 issues are noted at the end of the report. Two of
those issues, the evaluation of teaching and the reorienting
and maintaining of faculty interest in undergraduate educa
tion, had been actual agenda items, but lengthy deliberation
on other issues prevented their discussion.
There is little need to dwell on some of the distinctive
characteristics of the committee. Three points do need to be
noted, however:
hirst, the committee made no attempt to work out
specific details on most of the matters it considered. The
committee has made recommendations, but for most of the
recommendations final decision as well as specific details and
implementation are necessarily the prerogative of other
University committees.
Second, because other bodies will work out the specifics,
the exact wording of the recommendations was not a major
concern of the committee. (Recommendation 11, directed to
the dean of Humanities and Sciences, is the only exception to
this rule.)
Third, with the exception of the President, the Provost,
and the dean of Humanities and Sciences, all members of the
committee voted when present. Any important split votes are
noted in this report.
The committee used a variety of means, besides individual
members' own views, to examine the current state of
undergraduate education. Among other means, they ex
amined 52 randomly selected transcripts of seniors who
graduated in 1974 and then reviewed the high school
transcripts of those seniors in certain areas.
They also talked with the dean of admissions, consulted
various chairpersons, gathered enrollment figures for various
courses and departments for the last four years, analyzed
shifts in enrollments among different departments, and
reviewed the transcripts used by those who conducted the
recent Study of the Freshman Year.
RECOMMENDA TIONS
I. A WESTERN CULTURE REQUIREMENT
The committee unanimously agreed on the desirability of
a Western Culture requirement. This requirement would be
fulfilled by taking one of several three-quarter course
sequences and would be in addition to the present distribu
tion and writing requirements.
The recommendation to add to the present requirements,
with the implications that such a recommendation has for all
students and many faculty, was made only because the need
seems so great.
The University must introduce students to new areas,
ideas, and works, while also providing them with the general
informational background and cultural vocabulary of the
tradition from which almost all of them come. Moreover, a
need exists to reveal the continuity of certain problems in
Western culture and the recurrence of some difficulties and
solutions to those problems.
finally, Stanford graduates must recognize how dift'erenl
historical situations shape what it is possible for people to do
and to be and must understand what it means to live with
traditions different from one's own, with similar traditions,
and with no single effective tradition.
Initial consideration focused on a history requirement,
but the desire to widen the scope of the requirement,'involve
a number of departments, and provide flexibility and choice
for the student led to the current recommendation.
The final decision on this recommendation rests, of
course, with C-US and the Faculty Senate. Moreover, further
work is needed on many specifics, especially establishing
those sets of courses that would fulfill the requirement's
aims. The committee hopes that some of the following
comments will aid C-US in its deliberations.
General guidelines and possible courses that might fulfill
the requirement are discussed below:
A. General Guidelines
I. The courses have scope, that is, cover many of the
important cultural creations and movements in Western %
civilization and, at least, sketch the social and political
history. I or example, Roman literature might not be covered
but the whole of classical literature could not be excluded.

2. Disciplinary distinctions are to be highlighted; that is,
the approaches represented by, for example, philosophic and
literary studies are to be stressed. A main emphasis ought to
be on how a discipline or combination of disciplines
approaches and views certain basic cultural manifestations of
Western civilization.
3. The historical approach of the course may work in
either of two ways. One will emphasize the continuity and
change of certain ideas, institutions, and/or societies. The
other will weave the historical background into the study of a
particular work or piece.
4. To provide a common background, all courses will
employ books that cover the general sweep of the Rfof's
history and outline its significant events. The possibility of
either testing the students' comprehension of these books or
allowing students to test out of this part of the requirement
was discussed but not resolved. Such a decision must be
further considered.
The notion of testing out of this requirement was
rejected. No known high school courses correspond to all the
likely courses, adequate tests would be very difficult to
compose, and a nightmare of grading might arise. The
committee favored this requirement so strongly that to allow
such flexibility in fulfillment would seriously dilute its
intent.
This requirement requires further discussion of, for
example, the following issues:
1. Overseeing the courses would be an important and
perhaps difficult task. Toward meeting that problem, some
members of the committee suggested a possible Undergradu
ate Education Committee to advise the dean of Humanities
and Sciences on matters such as changing and/or developing
courses to fulfill this requirement and ensuring a high quality
of teaching for these courses (See Recommendation Two).
2. Enrollment in these courses will necessarily be high
and for many beginning students they will constitute yet
another of many large required or desired courses. Develop
ing small group components within these courses would be
important.
One idea discussed was to encourage "satellite" seminars
on specific but related issues that could utilize the larger
course's lectures and readings for background. Some seminars
for entering students might function in this way and work
especially well for those students who enter with some
previous work in certain areas. Other ways to help these
courses provide more of a common focus for the freshman
years also need to be investigated.
While it is true that there are no real problems in
obtaining appropriate teaching assistants, care must be used
; n overseeing the quality of their teaching. Moreover, care
must be exercised to prevent the freshman year from
becoming one in which the only personal contact with
teachers is contact with graduate students.
3. Deciding the point in the student's career by which the
requirement should be fulfilled is im\X)rtant. Many commit
tee members favored an early deadline in order to introduce
students to a wide variety of options as well as to provide a
solid background for further study.
B. Possible Courses
Conversations with the various H & S chairpersons led to
formulating the following four courses as possible choices for
fulfilling the requirement. Work on developing the exact
content of the courses that might fulfill the requirement is
critical. If C-US and the Faculty Senate are to act on this
requirement, they must have a clear sense of what such
courses would be.
The following courses are described in order 10 give
concrete examples of the kinds that arc envisaged. Other
possibilities exist. For example, two currently being discussed
are a course on the influence of certain Western cultures on
each other (Greece and Rome, Europe and America) and a
course focusing on such topics as change and the self, which
centers on the modern period but works back through time
extensively. Moreover, for those students participating, a
special program like Structured Liberal Education (SLE)
might suffice.
One advantage of the' following courses is that they
involve a variety of departments. Moreover, in only one case
is the creation of a totally new course called for; in most
cases the existing courses already have distinguished histories,
and in all cases they could be changed to fit the requirement
without too many difficulties.
112 inally, faculty staffing for all these courses does exist,
though in some instances departmental offerings might
suffer. (Note: An intolerable strain in the Classics Depart
ment might develop unless some courses began out of
historical sequence.)
The four examples are:
1. Humanities 61, 62, and 63, reformulated somewhat.
This sequence covers Western literature from the classical to
the modern world, has a long, distinguished history, and
works from a coherent teaching philosophy.
2. A history course taught by faculty in the History and
Classics Departments. This could be done in cither of two
ways. One is to set up a new three-quarter course moving
from the classical world through the modern world. Another
is to build from existing courses in the Gassics and History
Departments with only moderate changes required.
These courses would be: Greek history (Classics 102),
Roman history (Classics 103), Medieval culture (History 65),
and History 1-2-3 (One might also add other courses such as
Renaissance Society and Culture). A student would then be
asked to take three of these with, say, at least one course
from pre- and at least one from post-Renaissance/Reforma
tion.
3. A course on theoretic analysis and religious symboliza
tion in the Western tradition taught mainly by faculty in
philosophy and religious studies and perhaps drawing on
faculty in the History Department and/or Literature Depart
ments.
4. A course drawing on faculty in the Art, Music, and
Drama Departments that would be entirely new and quite
experimental, perhaps even involving performing aspects.
Though requiring more time and effort to start and
maintain, Stanford is distinctly suited to teach such a course
because the relevant departments have strength in ihe needed
historical and intellectual disciplines.
N
11. ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON UNDERGRADUATE
EDUCATION TO THE DEAN OF HUMANITIES AND
SCIENCES
The committee agreed on the need for a committee
especially committed to overseeing the day-to-day operations
of undergraduate education within H & S. Such a committee
would complement, and should assist, C-US and C-AAA,
which are charged to recommcnd policy changes.
After considerable committee discussion, the decision was
made to recommend that the dean of Humanities and
Sciences establish a committee to advise him on how best to
employ fully the resources in Humanities and Sciences for
general undergraduate education. The committee would be
an operating and not a policy committee.
Problems were recognized in establishing such a commit
tee. l or example, creating yet another committee to add to
the great number already operating; jurisdictional overlaps
with C-US, C-AAA, the Undergraduate Education officer,
and others; meeting the needs of those schools outside
Humanities and Sciences that are involved in undergraduate
education.
Nevertheless, the need to focus on issues dealing with
undergraduate education in Humanities and Sciences was
thought important enough for such a committee to be
necessary. Such a committee would be advisory only and
would not conflict with other policy-making committees of
the University.

The Policy Committee (recently established in H & S) and
the dean would select the members of the committee. The
dean should also ensure that the valuable student perspective
is received. The committee's tasks would be as follows:
1. To monitor the service teaching done by Humanities
and Sciences Departments.
2. To be a source of evaluation and advice on the service
teaching of Humanities and Sciences departments.
3. To focus certain and specific questions concerning
undergraduate education in Humanities and Sciences.
4. To stimulate new general education courses inside
Humanities and Sciences.
5. To advise the dean about intercertifying and decerti
fying extradepart mental courses and programs inside Human
ities and Sciences.
111. AN HONORS PROGRAM
Early in the Committee's deliberations there emerged the
notion of developing an honors program based not simply on
performance but rather on a prescribed set of courses and
performance. The idea found favor for a number of reasons,
not the least of which is that it declares what in the
University's mind constitutes a basis for a sound liberal
education.
Many committee members found it to be a congenial
middle road between the poles of prescribing what is
educationally sound and preserving the student's free choice.
Finally, it was seen as a way of meeting some of the
problems arising from prcprofessional interests among stu
dents, especially that of becoming prematurely locked into a
narrow field of study. Preprofessional students might enter
. such a program both because of what it offered and because
professional schools would look with favor on their participa
tion.
The final decision on this recommendation rests, of
course, with C-AAA and the Faculty Senate. Moreover, even
if the general idea finds favor, considerable work on specifics
is necessary. We hope, however, that the following comments
will aid C-AAA in its deliberations.
Considerable discussion led to the following proposal.
First, the present scheme of graduate with distinction would
be replaced by three types of graduation with Honors. The
first would be graduation with Honors in the Major. The
criteria for such graduation would be defined by individual
departments, but they must include a senior project. The
second would be graduation with Honors in Liberal Studies;
that is, meeting well the requirements that are listed below.
The third would be graduation with University Honors. That
would involve a combination of the first two kinds of honors.
It is important to note that requiring a senior project or
paper for Honors in the Major is a significant change. The
committee thought that departmental honors programs ought
to be more widely utilized than they currently are. At
present few students take departmental honors; whether this
is based on students' lack of interest or the departments' lack
of encouragement is unclear. In certain large departments this
requirement may impose difficulties, but the importance of
the idea was agreed on by all.
The committee's main concern was with Honors in
Liberal Studies. This would involve five requirements.
The first would be the regular University distribution
requirements, including the Western culture requirement
should it be approved, though for honors students mathe
matics could not count toward fulfilling the natural science/
technology/mathematics distribution requirement. Any other
normally approved courses could satisfy that requirement,
however.
The second requirement would be mathematics through
calculus. (Taking a course in any department for which
calculus was a prerequisite would be recommended.)
The third requirement would be to take a foreign
language through one course dealing primarily with literature
in that language.
The fourth requirement would allow two options. One is
honors freshman English; that is, a three-quarter, faculty
taught course incorporating a variety of types of literature
originally written in English. The other is a regular two-quar
ter freshman English course plus one literature course dealing
primarily, with literature originally written in English.
The fifth requirement is one course dealing with a
non-Western culture; that is, a course where the clear aim is
to introduce students to a culture different from that of the
West.
I our matters that were much discussed are worth noting.
First, the committee desired to establish a symmetry
between language and tnathematics by having the student
acquire and then use the skill. In the case of mathematics this
is currently impossible because courses requiring calculus arc
at a level so advanced that honors would be either enerous or
almost impossible for 1) many majors in the social sciences
and 2) almost all majors in the humanities.
Second, the committee discussed extensively a distinctive
manner of fulfilling the distribution requirement but was
unable to reach agreement. Several proposals, however, were
put forward, including students' writing papers to tie
together courses within the distribution requirement and an
honors seminar in a distribution area outside that of the
major.
Most agreed that honors should involve something more
than a normal fulfillment of the distribution requirement,
but two difficulties were seen by many as insurmountable.
First, the difficulty of faculty overseeing, say, special papers
or seminars. Second, the question of accommodating people
who elected to do honors only after either having spent
several years at Stanford or having transferred into Stanford
from another institution.
As proposed, the program can be entered quite late in a
student's career, but additions to the distribution require
ment would make that difficult. Many members of the
committee did feel that other components to an honors
program might well be added, but they were unable to find
any additions that did not create significant problems.
(It is worth noting that no one could come up with even
an educated guess as to how many students would go into
such an honors program, though there arc some indications
that a number of students enter Stanford with much of the
needed language and mathematics work already done in high
school.)
A third problem discussed was the level of perfortnance to
be expected of honors students. While C-AAA must consider
the whole issue, there was general agreement on four
guidelines:
I irst, grades ought not be emphasized as a basis for
honors. The substance of the program should be more
important than grade distinction. (The problem of shifting
grade standards also makes any specific comment difficult to
make.)
Second, honors ought to be open to a significant number
of undergraduates.
Third, the CPA for honors graduation should be for all
courses, not simply for honors courses.
fourth, the CPA floor for honors ought not be lower
than the average grade at that time at Stanford.
It must be noted that the vote on this last point was 6 for,
1 against, with 4 abstentions; all the rest of these guidelines
were passed unanimously.
Finally, the importance of good advising to the honors
program was emphasized by all and may indeed be crucial to
its success. The notion of assigning only very good advisors to
honors students was discussed. The final consensus, however,
was that the program ought to proceed without special ad
vising in order to see how many people would become
involved and what advising problems arose.
It was also agreed that literature on the program, particu

larly its rationale, ought to be made available to all students.
This would highlight the honors program as a paradigm of
what the University considers to be a basis for an optimal
educational experience and serve as a guideline for advisors
and students.
IV. THE CALENDAR ISSUE
The issue of the calendar is an old one at Stanford: the
general arguments for and against the semester system are
included in a task force report to this committee. (They also
were omitted in a task force report to the Commission on
Budget Priorities, published in Campus Report Oct. 29,
1975.]
A semester system is defined as one where the first
semester begins in late August and ends before Christmas.
The inclusion of reading periods was not specifically dis
cussed, though the fact that they clearly fit more easily with
a semester system was a consideration.
The committee discussed the calendar only as it relates to
undergraduate education, realizing that other groups are
looking at the issue from different perspectives. The com
mittee voted 7 for and none against, with 2 abstentions, for a
semester system.
For some at least, the institution of a semester system is
of crucial importance to the reform and renewal of under
graduate education at Stanford, especially because of the
need in the humanities for a longer time to absorb the
material, write research papers, and build those elements
needed for class discussion. Some also felt the necessary
revisions in the curriculum and reexaminations of teaching
loads involved in such a move would be valuable in them
selves.
V. THE COMPOSITION AND DISTRIBUTION OF A
STATEMENT ON THE ACADEMIC GOALS OF STAN-
FORD
The committee strongly recommends the writing and dis
tribution of a statement on the general academic goals of
undergraduate education at Stanford, including the meaning
of the distribution requirements, and the goals sought by
certain courses of study, such as the acquisition of a lan
guage. Information on the honors program also should be
included with it.
Such material should be sent to all entering students,
either as part of Approaching Stanford or as an addition to it,
and also to be included in Courses and Degrees.
The issue of who should write and review such a state
ment was left undecided, but an example of the kind of
statement the committee desires is the prefatory material in
the Yale catalogue.
VI. A LANGUAGE/MATHEMATICS REQUIREMENT
Language and mathematics are treated here as one re
quirement, though a language requirement and a mathematics
requirement were each discussed separately by the commit
tee. The general informational background on arguments
about a language and mathematics requirement are contained
in a task force report to this committee.
The issue, especially of a language requirement, caused
significant and often heated disagreement within the com
mittee. The disagreement centered not on the value of the
mastery of language and mathematics but on whether to
impose a requirement for what is currently being done by
many on a voluntary basis.
Data received by the committee indicate that significant
numbers of Stanford students have taken or do take either or
both language and mathematics at Stanford, and the majority
of students have a considerable background in both before
arriving.
A combination of very high enrollments in mathematics,
the fact that a small minority has a distinct problem doing
higher mathematics, and the success of courses like Math 2
led most members to conclude that the mathematics problem
was so small that it was no problem.
The situation in language is somewhat similar. Most Stan
ford students do enter with some language background. Lan
guage enrollments have remained fairly steady (or increased
in some departments) since the requirement was dropped.
All agreed that language work would be required for
graduation with honors and all also agreed that, when pos
sible, faculty ought to make greater use of materials in
foreign languages in their courses. Nevertheless, disagreement
existed about the need for a language requirement, in large
part because views of the need differed.
The three proposals finally voted on by the committee
were:
1. A requirement of mathematics through calculus. The
vote here was 3 for, 7 against, and 1 abstention.
2. A requirement of one year of a foreign language or a
score of 650 on a language achievement exam. The vote here
was 5 for, 5 against, and 1 abstention.
3. A requirement of one of the above two, that is, either
mathematics through calculus, or one year of a foreign lan
guage or a score of 650 on a language achievement exam. The
vote here was 6 for and 5 against.
The tied vote on the second proposal and the slender
"affirmation of the third appears to mean that the dean of
Humanities and Sciences must decide whether or not the
possible requirement change ought to be referred to the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies.
VII. ISSUES OF SPECIAL IMPORTANCE THAT STILL
NEED TO BE DEALT WITH
As noted earlier, certain limitations prevented the discus
sion of several important issues. The following list comprises
11 issues which the committee thinks ought to be investi
gated.
The first two issues, as noted earlier, were actual agenda
items, but lengthy deliberations on other matters prevented
their discussion. These issues are as follows:
1. Consideration of suggestions concerning teaching eval
uation.
2. Consideration of 11 ideas concerning the reorientation
and maintenance of faculty interests in undergraduate educa
tion.
3. Investigation of the suggestions made concerning ex
tradepartmental courses.
4. Discussion of the issues involved in independent work.
5. Stimulation of the following courses.
a. Science courses for nonscientists, specifically a
two- or three-quarter sequence.
b. Language and culture courses.
c. "Symbol Manipulation" courses.
d. A course on "Policy Analysis for the Citizen" as a
possible integral part of the fulfillment of the social
science area requirement.
6. Consideration of the educational problems involved in
present scheduling practices.
7. Consideration of a staff person to oversee practical
problems relating to undergraduate education.
8. Consideration of the four points concerning junior
faculty.
9. Consideration of possible changes in the constitution
of the Appointments and Promotion Committee.
10. Consideration of setting effective unit limitations on
majors, at least on those majors within Humanities and Sci
ences.
11. Consideration of the role of advising in any new
program of undergraduate education.
