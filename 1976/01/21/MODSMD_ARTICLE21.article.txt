## Roster rule repealed at NCAA Convention 
### CHRIS KAMEL 
The decisions resulting from
last week's NCAA Convention in
St. Louis "will improve sports
programs around the country,"
according to Stanford Athletic
Director Joe Ruetz.
Still, the Stanford contingent
of Ruetz, Faculty Representative
John Harbaugh and President
Richard Lyman came back with
out passing the proposal they
most strongly supported.
According to Ruetz, Stanford
most wanted the adoption of a
scholarship formula based on
need. The voting in Division I,
which comprises the nation's
major teams, ended in a 119-119
tie, but the proposal later failed
in a roll-call vote. The roll-call
was the first in NCAA history.
"The support for the proposal
was greater than 1 earlier antici
pated," said Ruetz. "The opposi
tion consisted of schools where
football revenue funds other
sports and they felt the adoption
of a need formula would cut into
the other sports."
According to David Price,
Asst. Executive Director of the
Pacific Eight, the Pac-8 confer
ence was one of few major divi
sions to support the proposal. Of
the eight league members, only
Cal and (JSC opposed the prop
osal.
Title IX tabled
Another scholarship con
troversy was tabled pending
further inspection. Title IX,
which Ruetz termed the "thor
niest question of the conference
meeting," states that women
should receive a proportionate
number of scholarships to men.
Ruetz said the bill is confusing
and he advocates that women's
scholarships be allocated on the
basis of athletic ability rather
than on a quota basis.
Stanford established a few
proposals on its own but these
failed to become reality. Stan
ford initiated a bill in which a
player could not sign a letter of
intent to attend a school until he
was regularly admitted. Even
though Cal supported Stanford,
the Pacific-8 did not. Another
proposal required schools to file
information on student athletes
for future years, but this was de

feated by the NCAA.
"The Pac-8 felt that signing a
letter of intent after being admit
ted was impractical," "Schools
like Stanford and Cal would log
ically want this because of their
more rigorious admission stan
dards."
Stanford, as well as the Pac-8,
did get an extention on its re
cruiting time, however. The
period during which a high
school player can be recruited
was extended to the time from
the junior year of high school to
June 15 of the senior year.
"We're still allowed only three
off-campus visits, but with the
additional time, we will be able
to save money and the coaches
will be able to see a student at a
time when he's not as preoc
cupied as much with school,"
Ruetz said.
NCAA reconsiders
Coaches all over the country
got yet another break as the
NCAA abolished the traveling
squad limit which Ruetz origi
nally felt altered the nature of
sports. A bill setting no restric
tion on pre-season and post
season practice was also
adopted.
Conferences will now be al
lowed to establish their own
limits as to how many players a
coach may take with him on the
road. The Pac-8 has set a
54-man football roster and
12-man basketball roster (effec
tive immediately) for conference
games home and away. For
merly, football teams were al
lowed to suit up 60 players at
home and 48 on the road, while
basketball teams were limited to
12 players at home and 10 on the
road.
"I am very pleased with the
decision to remove the 10-man
traveling limit," said Head Bas
ketball Coach Dick Di√üiaso, re
flecting on an early season game
at Louisiana State University in
which four of his players fouled
out of thegame."A couple times
on the road that factor real ly hurt
us. "It should give coaches
around the country a little more
to work with."

The most publicized issue of
the convention didn't raise as
much controversy as antici
pated. A proposal was consi
dered in which the NCAA would
establish a playoff after the bowl
games to determine a national
champion. Supporters of the
idea said it would rid colleges
from "biased" polls and would
logically determine who's the
best. Those opposed to the sys
tem said it would adversely af
fect the bowl games' appeal and
that such a system would be to
tally impractical because no real
cut-off could be drawn to deter
mine which college teams
would go to the playoffs. The
NCAA ended up tabling the
proposal until next year. '
"The conference felt that
limits could not be set because of
geography," said Ruetz. "But
there was widespread disap
proval to its formation."
According to Price, the Pac-8
representatives, who were
strongly against such a system,
won a temporary victory. He said
however, because of the table,
the NCAA might be leaning to
ward the playoff plan.
