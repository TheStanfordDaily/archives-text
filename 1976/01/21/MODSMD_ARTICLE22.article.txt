# Shaw – another Mark Spitz?
## 
### JILL LIEBER 
Tim Shaw has been referred to
as "swimming's next Mark
Spitz." The holder of three
world records showed a Stan
ford crowd last Saturday that his
superstar rating is well de
served.
Shaw won the 1000-yard free,
the 200-yard backstroke, the
500-yard free and set a new pool
record in the 1000-yard free of
9:29.4 — four and one-half sec
onds off the old record. Still, he
does not feel as confident about
his swimming this season as he
has in others, and attributes it to
playing water polo for Cal
State-Long Beach this past fall.
"Right now I'm working a lot
on my stroke — getting back into
it from water polo," Shaw said.
"Polo shortens your stroke, I've
got to get back to a swimming
stroke instead of quick sprints."
Shaw now spends most of his
days in the water, training for the
Olympic trials in June. His
rigorous schedule of four to five
hours in the pool each day makes
one wonder how long he'll be
able to both swim an attend clas
ses.
'Total concentration'
"It's just total concentration
the whole time," Shaw says.

"There are no ten-minute breaks.
It's just straight working out."
Shaw considers himself a
member of "swimming's
younger generation" while ad
mitting that some of his com
petitors are even younger than
he. But Shaw doesn't think age
matters in swimming.
"You're competing against
each other — no matter what age.
You've just got to be determined
and work hard."
Like a fish
It's difficult to pull Shaw out
of the water once he's in. When
he's not competing in a race, he's
working on his stroke with
coach Dick Jochums in another
pool.
Even though Shaw looks for
ward to swimming in the sum
mer Olympics in Montreal, he
has been thinking about what
he'll do after the games. He says
without hesitation; "I'm going to
take a BIG vacation."
Until then, Shaw will have to
work hard. Everybody is out to
beat him. As Stanford's Craig
Van Zandt said, "You're up on
the blocks and you look over at
Tim and think 'I'm going to beat
you Shaw.' " And maybe, just
maybe — if they drain the pool
— someone will.
