# Pac-8 predictions
## 
### 
Our prognosticator has received an offer
from last year's wizard, who compiled a pre
diction percentage of over. 700, to reassume
the weekly task. This year's predictor has
picked five of 11 games correctly. That's a
.454 mark. But this week the Pacific Eight
takes a small break from conference play.
Looking at the quality of the opposition, our
predictor is drooling over his typewriter keys.
The toughest game to pick is the UCLA-
Notre Dame rematch this Saturday. The sixth
ranked Bruins destroyed the 15th-ranked Irish
on national television earlier this month, 86-70,
in Pauley Pavilion. It wasn't as close as the
score.
Now the Bruins travel to South Bend for the
NBC game of the week. Even though we know
about Notre Dame's success in past re
matches (just ask John Wooden and John
McKay if they thought everybody in the stands
was a priest), we think UCLA will win. Gene
Bartow has a wife and children to support.
Sorry Dick Di√üiaso.

Now we come to the game we've been
dreading: Cat-Stanford. You might as well flip
a coin or compare scores of the two school's
games with USC and UCLA last weekend. Cal
got past the Trojans by a single point, 81-80.
Stanford beat SC 86-75. The Golden Bears
lost to UCLA by nine points 80-71. The Cards
almost beat the Bruins, finally losing 68-67.
We 7/ go with the Cards over the Golden Bears.
Bird. Bird. Bird. Bird. Carl Bird is for the birds.
