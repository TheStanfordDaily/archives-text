# Cards play Davis
## Schader honored 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Why Charles O. Finley and
Bill Veeck would be proud.The
first 1500 lucky fans who come
to Maples Pavilion tonight at 8
will receive free Stanford bas
ketball posters. There'll be a pre
liminary volleyball match at
5:15 p.m. between Stanford and
UC-Davis. And as a special
added attraction, the Cards will
take a break from Pacific Eight
action to play the Aggies on the
basketball court.
But there's one very important
person missing from the glossy
red and white posters to be dis
tributed. He's burly Stanford
forward Ceorge Schader, who
was named Pac-8 Player of the
Week for his performance
against UCLA and USC last
weekend.
The 6-foot-6 junior college
transfer pulled down 31 re
bounds and scored 41 points in
both games as the Cards won
their first conference contest
against USC, 86-75, and gave
UCLA a 68-67 scare.
Stanford, with a height disad
vantage against defending na
tional champion UCLA, out
rebounded the Bruins 54-26.
Schader's 17 boards were more
than the Bruins' entire front line
collected. He was credited with
14 rebounds against USC the
next night, but the stat girls may
have been sleeping. Bruin foot
ball coach Dick Vermeil, looking
for a tight end next year, joked
that he'd like to have Schader on
his squad.
6-8 1/2 center
So would Davis coach Bob
Hamilton. The Aggies tallest
player is 6-8 1/2 junior center
Dave Bailey, who averages 8.6
points a contest. Davis uses 6-5
Kelly McWilliams and 6-4 Mark
Olson as forwards. Olson is the
Aggies' leading scorer with a

19.6 per game average.
Stanford asst. coach Tom
McLaughlin, who has scouted
the Aggies, said, "Davis works
the ball pretty well. They use a
patented offense. They're a
scrappy ball club."
But Davis isn't in the Pac-8. "1
sort of like playing a non
conference game right now,"
said Card coach Dick Dißiaso.
Conference action tails off this
weekend, as the schools on the
semester system prepare for fi
nals.
Stanford will take on Califor
nia Saturday afternoon in
Maples. The game marks the
Cards' only television appear
ance of the year.
Will the Cards suffer a letup in
non-league action? "Davis is a
good team," said McLaughlin.
"If we don't come out at the be
ginning of the game we could be
surprised."
If there's a any doubt about
that statement, look at the 63-61
score of the Cal Poly-Pomona
contest. Stanford won that game
in the final three seconds on Tim
Patterson's tip.

ONE OF BRATZ' SHOTS—Stanford guard Mike Bratz goes up for
a baseline jumper against USC's Casey Jones. Bratz scored 18
points in the Cards' 86-75 upset win over LJSC and is tied for third
