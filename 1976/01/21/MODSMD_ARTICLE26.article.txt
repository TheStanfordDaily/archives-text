# Problems abound for DeMeo

### BRUCE ANDERSON 
"By speaking of our misfortunes
we often relieve them."
â€”Pierre Corneille
If talking is what alleviates
one's misfortunes, someone
with a lot of time should go see
Joe DeMeo. The Stanford wrestl
ing coach has nothing but trou
bles.
"We didn't do as well as we
hoped, but we did as well as can
be expected," DeMeo said after
his team suffered four defeats
last weekend at the hands of
Oregonian adversaries.
And what can be expected
from a squad that has to leave
three starters home with injuries
and two home with mononuc
leosis? What can be expected
when a team has six first-year
wrestlers up against teams com
posed solely of juniors and
seniors? What can be expected
when the coach has to recruit in
tramural wrestlers to compete
against nationally ranked Ore
gon (number 14) and Oregon
State (number 16)?
That is not, however, to slight
the efforts of Stanford IM wrestl
ing champs Bob Picazo and Joe
Coelho. Their performances last
weekend were perhaps the most
praiseworthy on the team.

Picazo won an exhibition match
against Oregon Tech, and
Coelho pinned a Southern Ore
gon College wrestler who was
last year's Oregon junior college
champion.
Co-captain John Govea's per
formances remain one of the few
other pieces of good news for the
Cards. Govea recorded one of
two Stanford wins Friday night
against Oregon State, and re
turned the next day to defeat the
runner-up in last year's National
Junior College Championships,
6-1, before a packed house in
Ashland, Ore.
In addition to Govea's perfor
mances, the fact that veteran
177-pounder Roy Tolles has
started to practice has the coach
smiling. Tolles had been
sidelined with a knee injury.

If Stanford could topple San
Francisco State, the 18th-ranked
college division team, tonight, it
would make the coach's smile
just a little wider. DeMeo thinks
it's possible. "We can knock 'em
off if we wrestle up to our poten
tial."
