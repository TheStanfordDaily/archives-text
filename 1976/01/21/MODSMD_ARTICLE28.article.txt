Ford proposes big defense budget
WASHINGTON — President Ford yesterday recom
mended the nation's first $100 billion spending budget for
defense, designed to maintain a military balance with
Russia while seeking agreements to curb nuclear arms and
other forces.
Ford's proposed $100.1 billion defense budget for next
fiscal year tops this year's record level by $8.9 billion.
Most of the increase is earmarked for buying additional
advanced warplanes, tanks, ships and other new arms, as
well as for improving the readiness of equipment already
in hand.
In the strategic-arms field, Ford called for continued
development of new nuclear weapons, including long
range air-breathing cruise missiles which could be
launched from bombers, submarines and surface ships.
"Effective agreements can be reached, however, only if
United States and allied forces remain at least as strong as
those of potential aversaries," the President said.
The administration's budget presentation was without
any saber-rattling, although Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld stressed that Soviet defense spending has been
increasing steadily over the past decade while U.S. milit
ary outlays, due to inflation, have been decreasing in real
terms.
Fighting rages in Angola
ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA — Rival Angolan factions,
fighting with Communist and Western backing for control
of the strategic African country, were reported in possible
decisive battles on three fronts yesterday. Speculation
grew that peace talks would soon be held in Kenya.
Reports from battlefronts within Angola said Cuban-led
MP LA forces, making strong thrusts into the southern
regions, were meeting tough resistance from UNITA and
several thousand white troops believed to be South Afri
cans.
The Johannesburg Star of South Africa reported that
Jonas Savimbi, leader of Angola's pro-Western National
Union (UNITA) forces, met with leaders of neighboring
Zambia to discuss a peace settlement for the war-torn
country.
The newspaper quoted informed sources as saying 23
moderate black African states, seeking an end to the year
long Angolan conflict, have agreed the Communist
backed Popular Movement (MPLA) should take the lead
ing role in the MPLA-UNITA coalition government.
Revolt stifled in Spain
MADRID — Clubbing and firing tear gas, police in re
cord numbers yesterday crushed the first public bid by
Spain's left to undermine the new regime of King Juan
Carlos.
I housands ot police on foot, in jeeps and on horseback

were backed by water cannon, rubber bullets, and automa
tic weapons in blocking a scheduled demonstration out
side Premier Carlos Arias Navarro's office.
The show of strength planned by the Communist party
sparked clashes with police in side streets. Some passers
by were clubbed. Smoke grenades routed demonstrators
near the Army Ministry.
The challenge to the government came in the midst of
Spain's worst labor unrest in years and exactly two
months after the death of the country's longtime rightist
ruler, Gen.Francisco Franco. He banned political activity
and demonstrations for nearly four decades.
Kissinger flies to Moscow
MOSCOW — Secretary of State Henry Kissinger flew to
Moscow last night for critical nuclear arms talks, pledging
to the American people that "we will never concede
strategic superiority to the Soviet Union."
With a dark-brown fur hat perched on his head, Kis
singer stepped from his jet into a light snowfall at subzero
Vnukovo Airport. "I've come here for serious talks," he
told reporters. "I wouldn't have come here if I didn't mean
it."
The top-level discussions begin today with Soviet
leader Leonid Brezhnev at the Kremlin. Even if there is an
agreement in principle on a new treaty to limit offensive
nuclear weapons, there will be a long interval before it
could be implemented, a senior U.S. official said.
A break-through could lead to a visit by Brezhnev to
Washington for a treaty signing with President Ford.
Committee passes one-house bill
SACRAMENTO — A proposal to establish a one-house
legislature in California was approved by the Assembly
Elections ami Reapportionment Committee yesterday.
The author, Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Van Nuys) said
it was the first time in history that a unicameral proposal
had cleared a legislative committee.
The 6-2 vote gave the amendment the minimum number
of aye votes needed to send it to the Assembly floor. If it is
approved by two thirds votes of both the Assembly and
Senate, it will be placed on the ballot for a vote of the
people.
Bane's proposal would establish a single legislative
body of 120 members in place of the present two-house
legislature of 40 senators and 80 assemblymen.
The single house would be called the Senate.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with warm afternoon tempera
tures. Lows in the 30s to low 40s. Highs both days in the
upper 60s and 70s. Light winds.

Revolt stifled in Spain
MADRID — Clubbing and firing tear gas, police in re
cord numbers yesterday crushed the first public bid by
Spain's left to undermine the new regime of King Juan
Carlos.
I housands ot police on foot, in jeeps and on horseback

were backed by water cannon, rubber bullets, and automa
tic weapons in blocking a scheduled demonstration out
side Premier Carlos Arias Navarro's office.
The show of strength planned by the Communist party
sparked clashes with police in side streets. Some passers
by were clubbed. Smoke grenades routed demonstrators
near the Army Ministry.
The challenge to the government came in the midst of
Spain's worst labor unrest in years and exactly two
months after the death of the country's longtime rightist
ruler, Gen.Francisco Franco. He banned political activity
and demonstrations for nearly four decades.
Kissinger flies to Moscow
MOSCOW — Secretary of State Henry Kissinger flew to
Moscow last night for critical nuclear arms talks, pledging
to the American people that "we will never concede
strategic superiority to the Soviet Union."
With a dark-brown fur hat perched on his head, Kis
singer stepped from his jet into a light snowfall at subzero
Vnukovo Airport. "I've come here for serious talks," he
told reporters. "I wouldn't have come here if I didn't mean
it."
The top-level discussions begin today with Soviet
leader Leonid Brezhnev at the Kremlin. Even if there is an
agreement in principle on a new treaty to limit offensive
nuclear weapons, there will be a long interval before it
could be implemented, a senior U.S. official said.
A break-through could lead to a visit by Brezhnev to
Washington for a treaty signing with President Ford.
Committee passes one-house bill
SACRAMENTO — A proposal to establish a one-house
legislature in California was approved by the Assembly
Elections ami Reapportionment Committee yesterday.
The author, Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Van Nuys) said
it was the first time in history that a unicameral proposal
had cleared a legislative committee.
The 6-2 vote gave the amendment the minimum number
of aye votes needed to send it to the Assembly floor. If it is
approved by two thirds votes of both the Assembly and
Senate, it will be placed on the ballot for a vote of the
people.
Bane's proposal would establish a single legislative
body of 120 members in place of the present two-house
legislature of 40 senators and 80 assemblymen.
The single house would be called the Senate.

Ford proposes big defense budget
WASHINGTON — President Ford yesterday recom
mended the nation's first $100 billion spending budget for
defense, designed to maintain a military balance with
Russia while seeking agreements to curb nuclear arms and
other forces.
Ford's proposed $100.1 billion defense budget for next
fiscal year tops this year's record level by $8.9 billion.
Most of the increase is earmarked for buying additional
advanced warplanes, tanks, ships and other new arms, as
well as for improving the readiness of equipment already
in hand.
In the strategic-arms field, Ford called for continued
development of new nuclear weapons, including long
range air-breathing cruise missiles which could be
launched from bombers, submarines and surface ships.
"Effective agreements can be reached, however, only if
United States and allied forces remain at least as strong as
those of potential aversaries," the President said.
The administration's budget presentation was without
any saber-rattling, although Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld stressed that Soviet defense spending has been
increasing steadily over the past decade while U.S. milit
ary outlays, due to inflation, have been decreasing in real
terms.
Fighting rages in Angola
ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA — Rival Angolan factions,
fighting with Communist and Western backing for control
of the strategic African country, were reported in possible
decisive battles on three fronts yesterday. Speculation
grew that peace talks would soon be held in Kenya.
Reports from battlefronts within Angola said Cuban-led
MP LA forces, making strong thrusts into the southern
regions, were meeting tough resistance from UNITA and
several thousand white troops believed to be South Afri
cans.
The Johannesburg Star of South Africa reported that
Jonas Savimbi, leader of Angola's pro-Western National
Union (UNITA) forces, met with leaders of neighboring
Zambia to discuss a peace settlement for the war-torn
country.

Ford proposes big defense budget
WASHINGTON — President Ford yesterday recom
mended the nation's first $100 billion spending budget for
defense, designed to maintain a military balance with
Russia while seeking agreements to curb nuclear arms and
other forces.
Ford's proposed $100.1 billion defense budget for next
fiscal year tops this year's record level by $8.9 billion.
Most of the increase is earmarked for buying additional
advanced warplanes, tanks, ships and other new arms, as
well as for improving the readiness of equipment already
in hand.
In the strategic-arms field, Ford called for continued
development of new nuclear weapons, including long
range air-breathing cruise missiles which could be
launched from bombers, submarines and surface ships.
"Effective agreements can be reached, however, only if
United States and allied forces remain at least as strong as
those of potential aversaries," the President said.
The administration's budget presentation was without
any saber-rattling, although Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld stressed that Soviet defense spending has been
increasing steadily over the past decade while U.S. milit
ary outlays, due to inflation, have been decreasing in real
terms.
Fighting rages in Angola
ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA — Rival Angolan factions,
fighting with Communist and Western backing for control
of the strategic African country, were reported in possible
decisive battles on three fronts yesterday. Speculation
grew that peace talks would soon be held in Kenya.
Reports from battlefronts within Angola said Cuban-led
MP LA forces, making strong thrusts into the southern
regions, were meeting tough resistance from UNITA and
several thousand white troops believed to be South Afri
cans.
The Johannesburg Star of South Africa reported that
Jonas Savimbi, leader of Angola's pro-Western National
Union (UNITA) forces, met with leaders of neighboring
Zambia to discuss a peace settlement for the war-torn
country.
The newspaper quoted informed sources as saying 23
moderate black African states, seeking an end to the year
long Angolan conflict, have agreed the Communist
backed Popular Movement (MPLA) should take the lead
ing role in the MPLA-UNITA coalition government.
Revolt stifled in Spain
MADRID — Clubbing and firing tear gas, police in re
cord numbers yesterday crushed the first public bid by
Spain's left to undermine the new regime of King Juan
Carlos.
I housands ot police on foot, in jeeps and on horseback

were backed by water cannon, rubber bullets, and automa
tic weapons in blocking a scheduled demonstration out
side Premier Carlos Arias Navarro's office.
The show of strength planned by the Communist party
sparked clashes with police in side streets. Some passers
by were clubbed. Smoke grenades routed demonstrators
near the Army Ministry.
The challenge to the government came in the midst of
Spain's worst labor unrest in years and exactly two
months after the death of the country's longtime rightist
ruler, Gen.Francisco Franco. He banned political activity
and demonstrations for nearly four decades.
Kissinger flies to Moscow
MOSCOW — Secretary of State Henry Kissinger flew to
Moscow last night for critical nuclear arms talks, pledging
to the American people that "we will never concede
strategic superiority to the Soviet Union."
With a dark-brown fur hat perched on his head, Kis
singer stepped from his jet into a light snowfall at subzero
Vnukovo Airport. "I've come here for serious talks," he
told reporters. "I wouldn't have come here if I didn't mean
it."
The top-level discussions begin today with Soviet
leader Leonid Brezhnev at the Kremlin. Even if there is an
agreement in principle on a new treaty to limit offensive
nuclear weapons, there will be a long interval before it
could be implemented, a senior U.S. official said.
A break-through could lead to a visit by Brezhnev to
Washington for a treaty signing with President Ford.
