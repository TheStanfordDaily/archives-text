# Lyman favors Western Civ class; opposes 'vocational orientation' trend
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
A Western Civilization-type re
quirement would probably help to im
prove the quality of undergraduate
education here, President Richard
Lyman asserted last night on KZSU's
Campus Conference.
Lyman contended that the Commit
tee on the Reform and Renewal of Un
dergraduate Education at Stanford
(CORRES), which last week recom
mended establishment of such a West
ern culture requirement, is more in
terested in broadening students' intel
lectual experiences than in making
academics here more rigorous.
"The proposed requirement is an
appeal to people rather than a coercive
device," Lyman added. "There would
be a variety of ways to fulfill it."

Lyman said that a recent survey of
transcripts by Assoc. English Prof.
Nancy Packer showed "an unbelieva
ble concentration of academic em
phasis" in many cases and a lack of any
structure or coherence in many other
cases.
A Western culture requirement
would help to give better framework to
the studies of social science and
humanities majors and would broaden
the intellectual perspectives of stu
dents in the natural sciences, Lyman
said.
Liberal arts
Lyman also said the requirement
would help curb the recent trend to
ward vocational orientation vis a vis
liberal arts among Stanford students.
"It is not even in the vocational in
terests of students to take courses that
will be useful only until the day after
tomorrow," Lyman said. "I'm a strong
proponent of the view that basic skills
knowledge is more useful in the long
run than ephemeral skills that may
help one get a job."
Lyman emphasized, however, that
the recommendation by CORRES is a
long way from being implemented. He
explained that before the requirement
can be establihed, the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies and then the
Faculty Senate must approve it.
In other comments on Campus Con
ference, Lyman said he voted last week
in favor of establishing financial aid

guidelines for athletes, while attend
ing the,St. Louis convention of the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Association
(NCAA).
Protect needy athletes
Lyman said that the measure he
supported, which was defeated in a
120 to 112 vote, would have protected
needy athletes from unfair financial
aid competition by affluent athletes.
Lyman also commented on the gen
eral place of athletics in a university.
"I came to Stanford (in 1957) with
the traditional faculty outlook,"
Lyman said. "I wondered how a Uni
versity with a claim to academic great
ness could be in the athletic bigtime."
But Lyman said he has since tended
to look favorably at the role of athletics
since he has "seen no aspect of intel
lectual life damaged by them."
He noted that sports here more than
pay for themselves but that the Ivy
League schools are so enthusiastic
about their athletic programs that they
spend tuition money on them.
Third World campus
On another subject, Lyman said a
Third World campus, as proposed by
the Committee on Foreign Studies,
would probably force cuts in existing
European programs.
"There are limited resources and we
cannot expand in all directions,"
Lyman said.
But Lyman denied that establish
ment of a Third World campus would

force the closing of one of the existing
European programs.
Lyman said one reason the ad
ministration decided 1o cut overseas
campus programs was because they
could be expanded and contracted
more readily than departmental prog
rams which would have been cut if the
overseas program had not been pared.

Lyman also said the requirement
would help curb the recent trend to
ward vocational orientation vis a vis
liberal arts among Stanford students.
"It is not even in the vocational in
terests of students to take courses that
will be useful only until the day after
tomorrow," Lyman said. "I'm a strong
proponent of the view that basic skills
knowledge is more useful in the long
run than ephemeral skills that may
help one get a job."
Lyman emphasized, however, that
the recommendation by CORRES is a
long way from being implemented. He
explained that before the requirement
can be establihed, the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies and then the
Faculty Senate must approve it.
In other comments on Campus Con
ference, Lyman said he voted last week
in favor of establishing financial aid

guidelines for athletes, while attend
ing the,St. Louis convention of the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Association
(NCAA).
Protect needy athletes
Lyman said that the measure he
supported, which was defeated in a
120 to 112 vote, would have protected
needy athletes from unfair financial
aid competition by affluent athletes.
Lyman also commented on the gen
eral place of athletics in a university.
"I came to Stanford (in 1957) with
the traditional faculty outlook,"
Lyman said. "I wondered how a Uni
versity with a claim to academic great
ness could be in the athletic bigtime."
But Lyman said he has since tended
to look favorably at the role of athletics
since he has "seen no aspect of intel
lectual life damaged by them."
He noted that sports here more than
pay for themselves but that the Ivy
League schools are so enthusiastic
about their athletic programs that they
spend tuition money on them.
Third World campus
On another subject, Lyman said a
Third World campus, as proposed by
the Committee on Foreign Studies,
would probably force cuts in existing
European programs.
"There are limited resources and we
cannot expand in all directions,"
Lyman said.
But Lyman denied that establish
ment of a Third World campus would

force the closing of one of the existing
European programs.
Lyman said one reason the ad
ministration decided 1o cut overseas
campus programs was because they
could be expanded and contracted
more readily than departmental prog
rams which would have been cut if the
overseas program had not been pared.

A Western Civilization-type re
quirement would probably help to im
prove the quality of undergraduate
education here, President Richard
Lyman asserted last night on KZSU's
Campus Conference.
Lyman contended that the Commit
tee on the Reform and Renewal of Un
dergraduate Education at Stanford
(CORRES), which last week recom
mended establishment of such a West
ern culture requirement, is more in
terested in broadening students' intel
lectual experiences than in making
academics here more rigorous.
"The proposed requirement is an
appeal to people rather than a coercive
device," Lyman added. "There would
be a variety of ways to fulfill it."

Lyman said that a recent survey of
transcripts by Assoc. English Prof.
Nancy Packer showed "an unbelieva
ble concentration of academic em
phasis" in many cases and a lack of any
structure or coherence in many other
cases.
A Western culture requirement
would help to give better framework to
the studies of social science and
humanities majors and would broaden
the intellectual perspectives of stu
dents in the natural sciences, Lyman
said.

Lyman also said the requirement
would help curb the recent trend to
