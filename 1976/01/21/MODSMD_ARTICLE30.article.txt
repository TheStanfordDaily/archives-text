# Carpools prove profitable
## 
### 
Carpools have skyrocketed in popu
larity since parking fees were insti
tuted by the University last September,
according to a Police Services report.
Some 96 free parking stickers have
been issued for carpoolers, compared
with 22 for the previous period when
carpooling was "encouraged" but not
rewarded monetarily.
A driver must carry two or more per
sons to and from campus daily to ob
tain a carpool sticker. Otherwise, the
driver must pay from $32 to $48 a year
for preferred parking spaces.
Establishment of a carpool informa
tion center for off-campus students has
been recommended by the Universi
ty's Traffic and Parking Committee.
The center will be established in con
nection with Synergy House and lo
cated at the Women's Clubhouse.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Thomas Massey will be in charge.
