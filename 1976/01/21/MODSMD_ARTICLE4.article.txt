# Jury duty mandatory
## New bill applies to students, too 
### DAVID NACHMAN 
All students now tapped for
municipal and superior court jury
duty are required by law to serve
unless the "service would entail
undue hardship on the person or
the public served by the person."
Assembly Bill (AB) 681, effective
Jan. 1, eliminated all 17 previous
specific exemptions for jury duty,
including categorical exemptions
for students, teachers, attorneys",
engineers, doctors and legislators.
Assemblyman Alfred Seigler
(D-Santa Rosa-Vallejo), author of
the bill, commented, "If we are to
have a jury of peers in the court,
then everyone should serve. This is
a common sense approach,
eliminating the exemptions which
have lasted for the last 105 years."
Exceptions
Exceptions may be granted to
students in some cases. During

examination or vacation periods, a
student.may defer his service until a
later date, according to a represen
tative for the Santa Clara County
Superior Court.
The court spokeswoman added
that such deferments and any hard
ship exclusions must be claimed
immediately.
If the judge thinks jury service
would be a hardship on the indi
vidual, he may excuse the person
from jury duty entirely.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons commented that a Stanford
student was granted an exemption
when he told the judge that he was
inundated with graduate school in
terviews.
Supplementary rules
Also, judges may enact
supplementary rules and regula
tions for the exemption of prospec

tive jurors. Thus it is possible that
certain judges may still excuse all
students, teachers, doctors or other
professionals.
Seigler said the bill was origi
nally introduced in 1971 by former
Assemblyman (now state Sen.) John
Dunlop (D-Napa), and received
only one vote in favor at that time.
He said it was passed this time with
the "spirit of reform" which he said
the Watergate scandal produced.
In California, all jurors are eligi
ble for service for one year. Jurors
called upon are required to serve
four days or work on a jury through
a final verdict.
The state pays each juror five dol
lars per day of service. 15 cents per
mile one-way for transportation
and provides meals and hotel
rooms when necessary during ex
tended jury deliberations.
