# Lebanese conflict widens; leftist Moslems invade north

BEIRUT (AP) — Leftist Moslem
militiamen apparently won control of
large Christian areas of Lebanon yes
terday. A powerful Christian leader
called for intervention by the United
States, the United Nations or Western
Europe.
U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kis
singer, however, warned against out
side intervention, and Arab League
Secretary-Ceneral Mahmoud Riad
called for an immediate Arab summit
to settle the war.
State-run Lebanese television an
nounced that Syrian Foreign Minister
Abdul Halim Khaddam and the Syrian
army and air force chiefs were due in
Beirut today to try to work out a set
tlement. Informed sources said
Lebanese Moslem leaders had
proposed Syrian Army Chief of Staff
Gen. Hikmat Shehabi as a neutral
negotiator.
A police spokesman said communi
cations were out with much of the
country but that Moslem forces ap
peared to have added most of northern
and eastern Lebanon to the southern
area they already controlled.
'Villages besieged'
"The last messages received re
ported scores of tiny Christian villages
besieged by Moslem tribal warriors in
the north and east," he said. "Hun
dreds of Christian families there have
already fled to neighboring Syria."
Right-wing Christian forces held
onto an area along the coast and moun

tains between Beirut and Tripoli and
part of the capital itself. They were
cleaning out Moslem pockets, includ
ing the last Palestinian holdout in the
corpse-strewn Karantina slum of
Beirut.
Police said more than 200 people
were killed, most of them combatants,
in the previous 24 hours. That raises
the death toll since Jan. 1 to more than
2050, in addition to the estimated 8000
killed last year.
Interior Minister Camille Chamoun,
76-year-old leader of one of the private
Christian groups fighting Moslems
and Palestinians, called for the foreign
intervention after he was evacuated by
helicopter from his besie« ,o d seaside
mansion south of Beirut.
Chamoun's charge
Chamoun, who as president in 1958
called in U.S. Marines to end another
civil war situation, charged Monday
night that up to 15,000 Syrian army
troops had crossed into Lebanon. Thd 1
Syrian government and Palestine
guerrilla leaders denied it, and U.S.
State Department and Israeli military
officials discounted Chamoun's
charge.
Palestinian and Lebanese military
sources said Syrian-trained units of
the Palestine Liberation Army — the
official military wing of Yasir Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organization —
had moved into Lebanon. Intelligence
sources here estimated their number at
1500, and U.S. and Israeli officials

agreed with it.
Israeli military sources said the
Palestinian army could tip the balance
to the Moslems in the battle for Beirut.
Palestinian sources said that Israel
was massing troops along Lebanon's
southern border, but Lebanese au
thorities denied it.
Israeli Defense Minister Shimon
Peres toured the border and said the
presence of large numbers of Pales
tinina guerrillas in the neighboring
country had "direct implications on
Israel's security."
Kissinger issued his warning
against outside involvement in "the
tragedy now befalling Lebanon" dur
ing a stopover in Copenhagen on his
way to Moscow. He said the war "has
the potential for drawing in outside
powers" and warned against "any un
ilateral action that could lead to an ex
pansion of hostilities."
In Washington, White House Press
Secretary Ron Nessen said the State
Department had sent warnings
through diplomatic channels for all
outside parties not to interfere in
Lebanon.
Chamoun, whose home is in an en
clave of four Christian villages under
attack by Moslems and Palestinians for
several days, issued his plea for inter
vention after talking with President
Suleiman Franjieh and top military
commanders. The president, a Christ
ian, was left without a government
when Premier Rashid Karami, a Mos
lem, resigned Sunday.
Kamal Junblatt, a Moslem leader,
traveled to Syria for talks with Presi
dent Hafez Assad. Sources said his trip
and Franjieh's meeting were related to
Assad's efforts to arrange another
ceasefire.
"The situation is developing
rapidly," Chamoun told newsmen.
"This requires an immediate inter
nationalization of the crisis and an
immediate international intervention
or we will end in catastrophe."
"The whole area is threatened," he
added, "and this is why I ask the Un
ited Nations Security Council to inter
vene at once either through the United
States or the European Economic
Council."
Arab League Secretary-General Riad
asked governments to respond within
72 hours to his call from Cairo for a
summit, which he proposed should
take place before the end of the month.
"Lebanon's problems should be sol
ved by the Arabs themselves," Riad
said, "not the United Nations or any
other European state."
