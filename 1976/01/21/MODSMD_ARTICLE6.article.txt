# IRS may investigate Nixon again
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)â€”The Internal
Revenue Service has reopened its in
vestigation of former President
Richard Nixon's tax returns to deter
mine if he should be prosecuted for
civil tax fraud, it was reported last
night.
An IRS spokesman declined com
ment on the reports.
The Washington Post said the IRS
now believes it can show Nixon had
prior knowledge that the deed he used
to claim a tax deduction was illegally
backdated when he donated his per
sonal papers to the government.
VP papers
The new audit of Nixon's returns
would include the years in which he
claimed a $450,000 deduction for his
vice presidential papers, said both the
Post and Ne.v York Times.
The Post said that if fraud is proven
against Nixon, he would have to pay a
1969 tax deficiency of $148,081, along
with a 50 percent penalty of $74,040.
During the final year of his presi
dency, Nixon promised to pay the
$148,081, but the Post said sources in
dicated he has not done so. He could
not be forced to pay the deficiency be
cause the three-year statute of limita
tions had expired. However, no statute
of limitations applies in case of fraud,
making the entire debt payable.
Penalties
In 1974, Nixon paid $284,706 in
penalties and deficiencies for illegal
deductions on his 1970-72 returns.
Nixon received a presidential par
don in 1974, but the Post said it applies
only to criminal offenses, and not to
civil tax fraud.
The Post said the IRS's belief that it
has a case against Nixon is based on
testimony under oath not available
when the IRS concluded in March
1974 that there was not sufficient evi
dence to charge Nixon.
