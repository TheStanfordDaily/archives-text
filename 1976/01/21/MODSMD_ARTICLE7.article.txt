## Dean's role 
### 
Provost William Miller's decision to expand the of
fice of Dean of Undergraduate studies to include a vice
provost position lays an added burden on the new dean
which will tax his or her ability to stay in touch with
student concerns.
The Committee on Undergraduate Studies has said it
recommended the expansion to Miller to enable the
new dean to understand more fully the operation and
problems of the University. In doing so, however, they
have run the risk of endangering the essential rapport
between this administration and those he will be
employed to serve.
In taking on the increased responsibiliy, the new
dean will be forced to address academic issues such as
the recent debate over funding for SWOPSI and SCIRE
from a post emphasizing the financial well-being of the
University rather than the personal needs and wants of
the student body.
Presently, the office held by retiring Dean James
Gibbs is the only institutionalized liason between stu
dents and administrators, and contains no direct ties
with a particular interest within the University hierar
chy.
Even in this position of direct accessibility, Gibbs
has come under fire for making decisions, such as his
recommendation for the elimination of SWOPSI and
SCIRE, before making an effort to gather student opin
ion.
The new vice provost position may be a mere titular
change without real function. If so, the committee of
faculty and students charged with selecting a new
dean should carefully define his relationship with
both undergraduates and financial officers.
