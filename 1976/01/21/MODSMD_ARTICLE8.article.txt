# Guest profs
## Halliday, et. al. 
### 
In the Jan. 7 Daily, it was er
roneously reported the ASSU
Guest Professorship Board had
•invited 36 persons to teach at
Stanford spring quarter, includ
ing Richard Nixon. As a result,
.William Ross, in his Jan. 13
J)aily column, admonished the
Guest Professorship Board for
ignoring student opinion.
' We hope this column will
•clear up the confusion.
First, we have not invited any
one to teach at Stanford. What
were mistakenly termed invita
tions were merely letters of in
quiry. Those receiving letters
were informed they had been
suggested by students for a guest
professorship, and these persons
Xvere asked to supply the board
with pertinent information (e.g.
if he/she would accept such a
position if offered).
Second, contrary to Ross's
charge of "blithe disregard for
student opinion," we actively
solicited student input. From
Dec. 2-8, a "Once Around the
Quad" announcement appeared
in the Daily requesting "stu
dents with suggestions for a po
tential ASSU Guest Professor
ship" contact, by phone, a board
member.
Board's encouragement
An article on the front page of
t lie Dec. 3 Daily also reported the
board's encouragement of stu
"dent suggestions. Additionally,
ASSU Senator Tim Cullinane in
formed the Senate of the board's
request for student input.
The board received 36 guest
professor recommendations.
Aware that students feel ignored
by their representatives in the
Senate and on committees, we
sent letters of inquiry to each of
the 36.
These letters in no way reflect
the board's choice of a guest pro
fessor but only our desire to rep
resent student opinion.
We do not feel that sending a
letter of inquiry to Richard
Nixon bestows an honor upon

him since we have publicly
stated a letter of inquiry was sent
to all people suggested.
Confusion
Another example of careless
journalism in the Jan. 7 article
and the column is the confusion
of the resolution to invite then
imprisoned Vietnamese jour
nalist Nguyen Huu Thai as
ASSU guest professor with the
fee assessment to fund the ASSU
guest professorship program.
Students had the option of
supporting the guest professor
ship program while voting
against the resolution to invite
Thai.
Consequently, the board does
not feel mandated to invite a
political prisoner. However, we
do feel a mandate to select a per
son whose experience or exper
tise enables him/her to teach
courses neglected in the Stan
ford curriculum but of interest to
students.
Solicited recommendations
For this reason we solicited
student recommendations and
now encourage students to help
the board formulate criteria for
deciding which person(s) the
board should urge the Senate to
invite.
We also want to emphasize
that the final decision about
whom to invite rests with the
Senate. Our function is to re
commend to the Senate a person
for the position.
Ironically, the board's attempt
to be as open as possible with our
proceedings precipitated the
controversy surrounding Nion.
There was dissension within the
board as to whether we should
release to the Daily the names of
the people suggested.
We decided to furnish the
names so students would be
aware of who might be teaching
here spring quarter.
