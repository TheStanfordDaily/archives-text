# Willow Road
## Julia Kringel 
### 
The front page of the Jan. 12
Daily had an interesting jux
taposition of articles.
The first was a report of Presi
dent Richard Lyman's Academic
Council speech in which he de
fended Stanford's elitist nature.
He said that without the kinds of
intellectual capacities evi
denced at Stanford, the world
will not be saved.
Adjacent to this article was
one which put a severe strain on
his thesis. The decision jointly
made hy the Palo Alto City
Council and the University to
widen Willow Road between El
Camino and Sand Hill Road is
surely the result of im
* poverished traditional thinking.
» A few years ago. Menlo Park
* residents, who will be vitally af
* fected by this enlarged road, ex
' pressed their displeasure of a
I similar plan by voting it down.
' Stanford and Palo Alto have
chosen to ignore their neighbor
ing city and the traffic problems
which a widened Willow Road
will create for it.
Stanford is thinking only in

terms of its investments. I know
there is nothing to be done about
this unfortunate decision.
Once the triumvirate of the
merchants from the Stanford
Shopping Center, Stanford Uni
versity and Palo Alto has de
cided what is best for its pocket,
there is no hope of dissuading it.
Perhaps, however, it is not too
late to appeal to the University to
display some sort of leadership
in the matter of those 33 trees it
intends to cut down in order to
move the cars faster.
That fringe of trees is all there
is between that monstrosity of a
shopping center and a pleasant
residential area. No amount of
promised landscaping can re
place the quiet beauty of what is
already there.
Before Stanford works on the
problems of the world, let it
show evidence in its own back
yard that its high IQ is of some
real value. Even dummies know
it's time for new solutions.
