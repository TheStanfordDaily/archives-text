ark and Charlotte share a house in Palo Alto
with two other couples. Mark is an RA here, so
he and Charlotte often sleep on campus. Her
parents don't know about the situation, but will find out
this summer when the couple plans to move in together
for good.
"They've got to find out sooner or later," Mark
lamented, "and when they do. . . we 11... the shit'll hit the

Debbie and her boyfriend live in separate residences

The problem of dealing with parents is common among
students who are living together. But in most cases it is

Frank and Betsy have been good friends for two
and-a-half years. They live together, with two other
roommates, in a house in Palo Alto. Both like the
arrangement: the four share the rent, food costs and
housekeeping evenly. Their parents know about it,
