# Cohabitation moves in?

ark and Charlotte share a house in Palo Alto
with two other couples. Mark is an RA here, so
he and Charlotte often sleep on campus. Her
parents don't know about the situation, but will find out
this summer when the couple plans to move in together
for good.
"They've got to find out sooner or later," Mark
lamented, "and when they do. . . we 11... the shit'll hit the
fan."
Debbie and her boyfriend live in separate residences
on campus. But they sleep together four or five nights a
week. His folks accept the situation, but Debbie says,
"My parents don't know about it. What they don't know
won't hurt them."
The problem of dealing with parents is common among
students who are living together. But in most cases it is
the only major drawback, and cohabitation is a growing
phenomenon, both at Stanford and around the country.
In an extensive 1974 study at Cornell, Eleanor Macklin

defined cohabitation as "sharing a bedroom (or bed) with
someone of the opposite sex for four or more nights a
week for three or more consecutive months." Macklin
found that 31 percent of Cornell undergraduates had at
some time "cohabited."
Across the country, studies have found cohabitation
rates range from 10 to 33 percent.
Cornell's housing and residence policies are very simi
lar to Stanford's, and its student body is fairly liberal.
Macklin's study stressed the sexual kind of relation
ship. But another form of cohabitation has become popu
lar, one which is not so likely to offend an older genera
tion. Men and women students are now rooming together
— both on and off campus — in situations where sex is
not involved.
Frank and Betsy have been good friends for two
and-a-half years. They live together, with two other
roommates, in a house in Palo Alto. Both like the
arrangement: the four share the rent, food costs and
housekeeping evenly. Their parents know about it,
and didn't like it at first, but "they realize what the
Stanford housing situation was,
and that sharing a house didn't
mean we were sleeping together,"
says Frank.
One major influence on the
popularity of both kinds of cohabi
tation seems to be "habita
tion" provided by cooo dorms on
campus. 112
"After living in a co-ed dorm for
a year, it seemed like the most
natural thing," s : Teri, a
sophomore, who lives in a house
with four men and another wo
man. "We found this beautiful
house and that was it. We didn't
even think twice about it."
Stanford housing went virtually
all coed in January, 1967.
"I don't think that living in a coed
dorm makes that much difference
as far as sex is concerned," one

student commented. "The main
thing is that it tends to make you
look at each other more as people
rather than just objects."
According to Assoc. Dean of
Students Larry Horton, "Those
fears some had of coed housing
leading to Sodom and Gomorrah'
are just untrue.
"But the University does not
recognize cohabitation," Horton
concluded.
Rare on campus
Cohabitation is relatively rare in
on-campus living situations. Most
men and women who cohabit live
off campus, and in some cases
one party will maintain a room on
campus for either convenience,
necessity or escape.
"It's a real drag when you have
an early morning class, so we
don't sleep together all the time,"
says one woman.
Some Row houses that have
free choice in the selection of
roommates are experimenting
with cohabitation. Boyfriend
girlfriend types live in some
rooms, while in others, a more
platonic relationship exists bet
ween the roommates.
One male student had cohabi
tated in his freshman dorm. "My

parents sort of knew what I was
doing," he said, "but, it still sent
my mom into shock when she saw
only one bed in the room. From
the first time on, she wouldn't even
come in."
Drastic action
Couples often take drastic ac
tion to keep ahead of their pa
rents. One boyfriend and girlfriend
sharing an apartment are forced
to maintain different addresses
and to keep two phones on the
kitchen table (one for his parents
and the other for everyone else).
Most couples feel that despite
the little hassles, the experience
of cohabitation is worthwhile.
And cohabitation doesn't seem
to interfere with school work.
Macklin's study found no signific
ant difference in scholastic
achievement between those who
live together and those who don't.
Debbie's example bears this out:
"On the whole, sleeping to
gether a lot doesn't affect my
studies, although sometimes it
does momentarily. It's actually a
nice break from the books. If
you're relaxed and satisfied in a
relationship, it actually enhances
your studies. There's more to
education than just schoolwork.

Part of it is learning to get along
with someone whose company
you enjoy."
Social, economic factors
Further, the Cornell study found
no significant social or economic
differences between those who
cohabited and those who didn't.
The largest variation seemed to
be along religious lines: 44 per
cent of the group reporting no re
ligious preference had cohabited,
as compared with 36 percent of
the Jews, 12 percent of the
Catholics and 10 percent of the
Protestants surveyed.
Of those who had not lived with
a member of the opposite sex,
less than 10 percent said they
hadn't because they felt it was
"morally wrong." One quarter of
the group hadn't "found the right
person," and an equal number
cited geographical distance from
"the right person" as their excuse.
Alternative, insurance
"Shackin' up" is sometimes
seen as an alternative to marriage
or as an insurance of a sexual
partner. Although outsiders may
view living together as a form of
"trial marriage," cohabitants gen
erally do not.
"Marriage? I just couldn't think
of that. It's too frightening to think
of that." one student told the Daily.
"No, I'm not against marriage,"
said another, "but right now it's not
for us. We're still at the discover
ing part of the relationship."
Cohabitants also like the emo
tional freedom involved. Gener
ally, they feel more likely to remain
faithful than if they were just mar
ried. There is not just a legal bind,

but an emotional commitment.
Occasional nuisances
Some sexual cohabitants suffer
occasional nuisances.
"My pet peeve is: if you don't
have a double bed, it's a little un
comfortable. University housing
should take that into considera
tion," said one cohabitant.
Those who live together out of
mere friendship are not so incon
venienced.
Teri and fellow sophomores
Lynn, Kevin, John and Dave share
a house off-campus. They split
cooking, cleaning and other
household necessities evenly and
all said they enjoy the experience.
Setups popular
Similar setups are becoming
popular outside of colleges as
well. Several roommate
exchange services have been ar
ranging no-sex coed living
groups. Time quoted the owner of
one service: "For people between
21 and 35, there are very few now
who won't at 'east consider a coed
living situation."
Time also quoted a San Fran
cisco man: "In the past, men
roommates have stepped on my
toes. The male-female arrange
ment blends and overlaps. I don't
want an involvement, and the
primary advantage is the sharing
of expenses."
No matter what the situation,
cohabitation seems to develop out
of a desire to experience some
thing new, to get to know some
one as a whole person and to
share openly and as completely
as possible with that person.
