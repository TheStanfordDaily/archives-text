# Weinglass, Garry talk
## Lawyers discuss politics, police, protests 
### MARC STRASSMAN 
"If you're not willing to beat the administra
tion's drums, then you're going to be prose
cuted,'' radical defense attorney Charles
Garry said yesterday.
Garry and Leonard Weinglass, a defense
attorney in the Chicago Seven conspiracy
trial, talked to a crowd of about 100 at Bishop
Auditorium as part of Disorientation Week,
sponsored by the Alliance for Radical
Change.
Garry recounted the origins and develop
ment of the Black Panther Party of Oakland,
ar.d how it led him into a deeper understand
ing of black culture and history. Criminal
charges against Panther leader Bobby Seale
were politically motivated, Garry charged, as
part of an alleged governmental policy of
persecuting its opponents.
Even the late Supreme Court Justice
Oliver Wendell Holmes recognized that the
legal system leads to repression, not justice,
Garry contended. Just after his appointment
to the court, Holmes said the "courts exist to
rule on the rules and regulations of a society,
to minimize turmoil, not to dispense justice,"
according to Garry.
U.S. police forces contribute to oppression
through increasing "militarizaticn,"

Weinglass contended. President Ford wants
to raise aid to local police forces to $7 billion
next fiscal year through the Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration, he said.
Nine million persons a year are arrested,
including 600,000 in Los Angeles County,
home of Special Weapons and Tactical
(SWAT) units, Garry noted.
FBI priorities
Data taken from the FBl's office in Media,
Pa., show the bureau spends 40 percent of
its time on political intelligence, 40 percent for
work against pacifist groups and four percent
against organized crime, Weinglass alleged.
In fact, FBI Director Clarence Kelly now
calls terrorists "the greatest threat to
America" despite the fact that only 11 of
20,000 murders nationwide last year resulted
from terrorist acts, he said.
Weinglass and Garry both expressed con
cern about physical structuring of cour
trooms. With police sitting in the audience
and bulletproof shields being used, "cour
trooms begin more and more to resemble the
visiting rooms in prisons," Weinglass said.
Garry is currently defending the San Quen
tin Six, while Weinglass is co-counsel for
Symbionese Liberation Army members Wil
liam and Emily Harris.
