# 'The Man Who Would Be Kins'
## New Huston masterpiece PICKS OF THE FLICKS 
### KAUTILYA 
Take an exotic romance, add a
master movie-maker, bring to
gether a talented group of players
and a rich setting — and yes, John
Huston that grand old man would
still be king.
He started in films over 40 years
ago with much promise, and then
within a decade was written off by
scornful critics as "virtually a for
gotten man" since his "work has
gone flat."
Huston's prolific output had mis
led them. They judged him by
each and every one of his films,
failing to see behind all that.
Hence the cynics have been con
founded when Huston has come
back, time and again, with mas
terpieces like' The Man Who
Would Be King.

To display the stubbornness
and resourcefulness of human na
ture in a harsh, masculine envi
ronment, Huston has roamed the
world from Mexico to Africa to the
Old West. Now we find him in Vic
torian India. Like the great artist
that he is, Huston insists so little
on his artistry that one may not
realize, right away, his sensa
tional achievement. He just tells
the beautiful story so straight and
so well that one falls totally under
its spell.
Captivating plot
The plot is a captivating, realis
tic fable, charged with universal
appeal, masquerading as an
action-packed drama. It is based
on an absorbing short story by
Rudyard Kipling. Two loafers hav
ing served in Her Majesty's army

set out in search of paradise — the
wealth of Kafiristan, a lost corner
in the rugged terrain north-west of
India.
These typical Huston heroes
live the perennial theme of strug
gle despite inevitable failure.
Peachy Carnehan (Michael
Caine) returns to tell a bewildered
Kipling (Christopher Plummer) of
the adventures that he and Danny
Dravot (Sean Connery) have
gone through.
Their plan had been more than
successful, and they had been
kings of Kafiristan. But in the end
victory had turned to ashes. The
story unfolds with such intelli
gence, humourand suspense that
it is best not to recount it here.
Human characters
Nominally an adventure tale, it
simply reveals two human charac
ters, and the changes that they
undergo through the sinister al
chemy of power and wealth. At
times it is funny, at others terrify
ing.
It is as rich in symbolic over
tones as it is in character and
drama; because the kingdom is a
fair image of most human goals,
and the men who seek it are fair
representation of man. The de
velopment of character is de-
