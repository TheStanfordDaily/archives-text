## Patti Smith: poet turns songstress 
### SALLY YOUNG 
Patti Smith first came into the
public eye as a hip poet several
years ago. As a warm-up act for
rock bands, she would deliver her
post-Beat poetics with the defiant
energy suitable to the hard rock
and rolling that would follow. Her
premier album, Horses (Arista
4066), shows that a poetry of
primordial images and free as
sociation can be combined with a
good rock band to produce some
very exciting music.
As a poet, Patti Snith has a lot to
say, and it is unfortunate that her
chosen mode of delivery, the
somnolent slur, obscures many of
the lyrics in her songs.
However, the concerns of rock
music are not the intellectual ones
of poetry, and what Smith sac
rifices in the way of literary lyrics
does not detract from the

dynanism and emotional appeal
of her music.
Most of Smith's themes are
sexual, from the longing expres
sed in "Redondo Beach" and
"Kimberely" to the blatant de
mands in "Gloria" and "Break it
Up." The first two are musically
simple songs, set to a pseudo
reggae beat, that enable us to
concentrate on the images
evoked by their lyrics:
"the sky will split
the plane's will shift and exis
tence will stop
I feel like some misplaced Joan
of Arc."
In "Gloria," Smith uses her
"punk" voice to convey sexual
urgency, while in "Break it Up"
hers is a mournful cry of anguish.
In both cases, her band, Televi
sion, provides a back-up of driving
guitars and libidinal drum
rhythms.
Violence and heroism are the
subjects of "Land" a lively dancing
song with a 1950s rock and roll
sound, to which Smith adds her
sinister lyrics of Joyce Carol
Oatesian images:
"Johnny crashing his head
against the locker
knife pressing against his
throat
vocal cords shot, pituitary
glands
he felt himself disintegrating."

In the last song, "Elegie," the
guitars and piano produce plain
tive whines w.tile Smith moans:
"There must be something I
can dream tonight
the sky is full of dreams
it's much too bad that our
friends can't be with us today."
Ultimately, it is her emotive
voice, rather than her lyrics that
we react to. Even without the be
nefit of her evocative lyrics,
Smith's songs are interesting be
cause her tone varies from one
song to the next, and her band
provides a solid rock background

for her vocal theatrics.
Her artistry is affirmed in the
merger of form and content, for
her music is a product of its man
ner of expression as well as that
which is expressed.
Smith's liberated lesbian
stance, her Keith Richard's look,
and her suggestive gestures on
stage contradict her coy de
meanor between numbers; but
her poetry is genuine. Such is the
stuff of a fascinating performer,
whose vitality and versatility are
well represented on her first al
bum.
