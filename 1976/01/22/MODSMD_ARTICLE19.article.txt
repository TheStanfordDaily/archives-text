## Patti Smith: poet turns songstress 
### SALLY YOUNG 
Patti Smith first came into the
public eye as a hip poet several
years ago. As a warm-up act for
rock bands, she would deliver her
post-Beat poetics with the defiant
energy suitable to the hard rock

premier album, Horses (Arista
4066), shows that a poetry of
primordial images and free as
sociation can be combined with a
good rock band to produce some
very exciting music.
As a poet, Patti Snith has a lot to
say, and it is unfortunate that her
chosen mode of delivery, the
somnolent slur, obscures many of
the lyrics in her songs.
However, the concerns of rock
music are not the intellectual ones
of poetry, and what Smith sac

does not detract from the

dynanism and emotional appeal
of her music.
Most of Smith's themes are
sexual, from the longing expres
sed in "Redondo Beach" and
"Kimberely" to the blatant de
mands in "Gloria" and "Break it
Up." The first two are musically
simple songs, set to a pseudo
reggae beat, that enable us to
concentrate on the images
evoked by their lyrics:
"the sky will split
the plane's will shift and exis
tence will stop
I feel like some misplaced Joan
of Arc."
In "Gloria," Smith uses her
"punk" voice to convey sexual
urgency, while in "Break it Up"
hers is a mournful cry of anguish.
In both cases, her band, Televi
sion, provides a back-up of driving
