# OPINIONS
## From the editor Feedback 
### 
Last week in this space, you'll remember, I asked for feedback
on Thursday. And I'm happy to report that we really got it.
Summarizing the diverse views of about 100 students and staff
who talked to our staff about the issue is hard. But two generaliza
tions seem in order.
1) In general, people liked the new format better than that of the
regular Daily.
2) People didn't like the lack of opinions and news and concent
ration on entertainment.
Some specific comments might serve to illustrate the point.
"I think it's great!" wrote one undergraduate. "I honestly admire
your taking decisive measures to deal with your financial troubles
and to enhance the attractiveness of the Daily."
"A big step in the wrong direction," wrote a professor. "Where's
the news on Thursday? The 'Chron'?"
A University staffer wrote, "I never read the events section
before — now I look at it. I like this format better."
And a grad student said, "I hated it. It just wasn't the Daily. It
reminded me too much of the other campus newspapers which are
pretty crummy."
After getting this written feedback as well as the oral comments
of people who talked to our staff, we decided to go ahead
Thursday on a regular basis. Both candidates for editor of the next
volume (which starts Feb. 2) agree. So it looks like Thursday will
be around for a while.
But to accomodate those who want eggs and bacon along with
the French Toast of our magazine-type cover stories, we're adding
news space and and an opinions page — and eliminating much of
the entertainment.
This weekly Thursday won't please everyone. But we're trying to
give as many people what they want as possible.
