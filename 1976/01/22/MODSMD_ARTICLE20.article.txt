## S.F. symphony gets down to business 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
Now that the San Francisco
Symphony has solved its contract
problems, they can get down to
the business of making music.
Last week they really got down to
business — and what a concert it
was.
Highlighting the program was
the extremely difficult and rarely
performed "Le Sacre du Prin
temp's"(The Rite of Spring) by
Igor Stravinsky.
The piece is full of rhythmic
bugs, tempo changes, impossible
runs and seemingly non-existent
notes that can alienate an unpre
pared audience. Indeed, at its
premier by the Russian Ballet in
1913, the furious audience threw
garbage, hissed, stomped and
was generally rather impolite.
But tastes change and tempers
mellow, and last week's audience
loved the Symphony's heroic and
successful efforts.
Rhythms and melodies were
forceful yet transparent — almost
pagan and brutally savage. The
mystery of Russia's violent sea
sons was clearly Stravinsky's first
love; they can be felt, not under
stood.
Haydn's Symphony No. 102 in
B Flat Major opened the program.
Orchestra and conductor seemed
uncomfortable with the sophisti
cated Largo; Allegro vivace.
Tempos were out of synch in the
Adagio, but initial insecurities
soon became lively textures and
an exciting Finale.

Completed in 1795, No. 102
forms a part of Haydn's final sym
phonic trilogy, formally establish
ing Haydn as the forerunner of the
symphonic form.
Cesar Franck's "Le Chasseru
Maudit" (The Accursed Hunter),
once one of his better-known
works, has recently been some
what ignored on the symphonic
repertoire.
The work celebrates the height
of German romanticism with insis
tence of strength of character.
Brassy rich horns, whispering
strings and fluttering woodwinds
performed the work cleanly and
precisely. Conductor Seiji Ozawa
interpreted into the piece precise
tonal and dynamic contrasts that
added a pleasant touch.
