Muskie blasts Ford's job
WASHINGTON — Sen. Edmund Muskie
(D-Maine) speaking for the Democratic
party last night, said President Ford's plans
for the economy would mean fewer jobs,
higher prices and ever-rising budget deficits.
Avoiding any direct reference to political
considerations in the election-year budget
process, Muskie blasted what he said was
the "inept, often panicky mismanagement" of
the economy by Ford and former President
Richard Nixon.
"The President's budget is designed to
keep unemployment over seven percent and
more for another year and to keep seven
million Americans unemployed at this time a
year from now," Muskie said.
Muskie included no specific detailed prop
osals in his speech, nor did he give dollar
figures to show how much his general prop
osals would cost.
His response to President Ford's Monday
night State of the Union Address was tele
vised by all three networks, unprecedented
coverage for such a speech.
Guerrillas fight in Lebanon
BEIRUT — Palestinian guerrillas and Mos
lem private armies squeezed Christians into
a mountainous one-fourth of Lebanon along
the coast north of here yesterday and
claimed to be marching on the already devas
tated capital.

State television said Lebanon had entered
"a state of total armed anarchy," with fierce
fighting "from one end of the country to the
other."
The offensive was evidently timed to
strengthen Syria's hand in mediation efforts
for a cease-fire. Sources in Damascus said
the Lebanese Christians would have to agree
to give Moslems an equal share of political
power as a prior condition to a cease-fire in
the nine-month-old civil war that has claimed
more than 10,000 lives.
Syrian Foreign Minister Abdual Halim
Khaddam said he was "optimistic" after a
meeting with Christian President Suleiman
Franjieh and Moslem leaders, including
Rashid Karami, whose resignation as pre
mier Sunday left the country without a gov
ernment.
The Lebanese army said the Moslems and
guerrillas were aided by 3500 to 4000 regu
lars of the Palestine Liberation Army who had
crossed into Lebanon from Syria. However,
diplomatic and Palestinian sources in
Damascus said the lumber crossing during
the past several days totaled no more than
2000.
Fire nears San Clemente
SAN CLEMENTE — Roaring canyon
winds fanned a 2000-acre brush fire through
the eastern sector of this scenic coastal city
yesterday, damaging or destroying at least
21 homes and threatening 50 others, au

thorities said.
At least 12 injuries were reported and hun
dreds of residents were evacuated from their
homes as the wind — gusting to 50 miles an
hour at times — bounced the flames in sev
eral directions into the night. The fire was
fueled by tall brush, explosively dry after a
nine-month drought in the region.
At one point the flames moved to within 1 1 /2
miles of the former Western White House of
Richard Nixon, but his seaside compound
was not endangered.
Two new housing developments were
burned as the fire sent an orange glow over
the area midway between Los Angeles and
San Diego.
Ford proposes less welfare
WASHINGTON — President Ford un
veiled his proposed $394.2 billion budget for
fiscal year 1977 yesterday saying it "would
arrest a spending trend that increasingly
threatened our national economic stability."
The budget, tailored to nurture a gradual
but sustained rehabilitation of the economy,
proposes increases for defense spending,
cutbacks for some welfare programs and
higher Social Security taxes.
He said his budget "reflects on every page
the common sense, the new realism, the bet
ter balance between public and private initia
tives and between the various levels of gov
ernment."
Today's weather
Fair today. Partly cloudy tonight and to
morrow. Slightly cooler tomorrow. Lows in
the mid 30s to mid 40s. Highs in the 60s and
low 70s. Light winds.

Avoiding any direct reference to political
considerations in the election-year budget
process, Muskie blasted what he said was
the "inept, often panicky mismanagement" of
the economy by Ford and former President
Richard Nixon.
"The President's budget is designed to
keep unemployment over seven percent and
more for another year and to keep seven
million Americans unemployed at this time a
year from now," Muskie said.
Muskie included no specific detailed prop
osals in his speech, nor did he give dollar
figures to show how much his general prop
osals would cost.
His response to President Ford's Monday
night State of the Union Address was tele

coverage for such a speech.
Guerrillas fight in Lebanon
BEIRUT — Palestinian guerrillas and Mos
lem private armies squeezed Christians into
a mountainous one-fourth of Lebanon along
the coast north of here yesterday and
claimed to be marching on the already devas
tated capital.

State television said Lebanon had entered
"a state of total armed anarchy," with fierce
fighting "from one end of the country to the
other."
The offensive was evidently timed to
strengthen Syria's hand in mediation efforts
for a cease-fire. Sources in Damascus said
the Lebanese Christians would have to agree
to give Moslems an equal share of political
power as a prior condition to a cease-fire in
the nine-month-old civil war that has claimed
more than 10,000 lives.
Syrian Foreign Minister Abdual Halim
Khaddam said he was "optimistic" after a
meeting with Christian President Suleiman
Franjieh and Moslem leaders, including
Rashid Karami, whose resignation as pre
mier Sunday left the country without a gov
ernment.
The Lebanese army said the Moslems and
guerrillas were aided by 3500 to 4000 regu
lars of the Palestine Liberation Army who had
crossed into Lebanon from Syria. However,
diplomatic and Palestinian sources in
Damascus said the lumber crossing during
the past several days totaled no more than
2000.
Fire nears San Clemente
SAN CLEMENTE — Roaring canyon
winds fanned a 2000-acre brush fire through
the eastern sector of this scenic coastal city
yesterday, damaging or destroying at least
21 homes and threatening 50 others, au

thorities said.
At least 12 injuries were reported and hun
dreds of residents were evacuated from their
homes as the wind — gusting to 50 miles an
hour at times — bounced the flames in sev
eral directions into the night. The fire was
fueled by tall brush, explosively dry after a
nine-month drought in the region.
At one point the flames moved to within 1 1 /2
miles of the former Western White House of
Richard Nixon, but his seaside compound
was not endangered.
Two new housing developments were
burned as the fire sent an orange glow over
the area midway between Los Angeles and
San Diego.
Ford proposes less welfare
WASHINGTON — President Ford un
veiled his proposed $394.2 billion budget for
fiscal year 1977 yesterday saying it "would
arrest a spending trend that increasingly
threatened our national economic stability."
The budget, tailored to nurture a gradual
but sustained rehabilitation of the economy,
proposes increases for defense spending,
cutbacks for some welfare programs and
higher Social Security taxes.
He said his budget "reflects on every page
the common sense, the new realism, the bet
ter balance between public and private initia
tives and between the various levels of gov
ernment."
Today's weather
Fair today. Partly cloudy tonight and to
morrow. Slightly cooler tomorrow. Lows in
the mid 30s to mid 40s. Highs in the 60s and
low 70s. Light winds.
Muskie blasts Ford's job
WASHINGTON — Sen. Edmund Muskie
