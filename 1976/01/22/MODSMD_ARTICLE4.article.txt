# Welcome, 'Prof' Nixon
## Dave Ansley 
### 
"Committee offers Nixon, Davis
spring guest teaching positions."
What? Tricky Dick? At our
humble West Coast bastion of
pseudo-intellectual somewhat
liberal semi-innovative educa
tion? The mind encounters dif
ficulties grasping the mere con
cept.
But why not? I think it would be a
grand idea to invite the turkey.
Heck, let's offer him a permanent
position. Just think of the advan
tages:
The Guest Professorship Board
(five poor folks who have spent
two years trying to give away
$10,000) has already tried twice to
obtain guest profs.
House arrest
Unfortunately, Nguyen Huu
Thai, a South Vietnamese scholar
and journalist, was placed under
house arrest in Saigon shortly
after hearing from Stanford.
Fergio Bitar, a Chilean
economist and educator, was al
ready in jail at the time of his invite.
On the basis of that record alone,
we should have asked Nixon
years ago.
But, you ponder, assuming the
ploy falls through, what would he
do for us if we were stuck with
him? What couldn't he do?
Just fcr starters: his record
breaking gridiron performances at
Whittier College qualifies him
handily for the post of head foot
ball coach.
Victory
Not only would he step up our
aerial attack immensely, but if the
team wasn't doing well aainst
USC, it would turn and attack the
crowd and still call it a victory.
Having Dick around would
solve our perennial mascot prob
lem, too. The band could just
parade him around at half-time as
the ultimate representation of a
Robber Baron.
And the financial implications:
We could get the money. We
could get two million dollars. It
would be hard, but we could get
it."
A man with that kind of attitude
belongs in the planning office. Put

him and his friends to work, and
we'd have a new library in no time.
Imagine: "The Bebe Rebozo
Memorial Library" — with the ITT
Tape Erasing Studio in the base
ment.
Practical training
The political science depart
ment is overflowing with courses
on political theory, but we need to
provide budding young politicos
with more practical vocational
training.
The syllabus for "Running a
Government For Fun and Profit"
(PS 68) would include such topics
as "Fighting Major Wars Without
Even Telling Your Friends,"
"Creative Appointments." "The
Difference Between Blame and
Responsibility," "How To Help an
Opposing Candidate and Win
Big" — and for emergency use
only, "Saving Your Neck with
Phlebitis of the Leg."
The Law School would not be
able to resist inviting such a dis
tinguished legal scholar.
He could explain to future Perry

Masons and John Mitchells such
complex legal concepts as: the
constitutional right of the Presi
dent to wiretap his mother if she
drinks Russian tea, the freedom of
speech considered as a typog
raphical error and capital punish
ment for aggravated pornog
raphy.
Worth attending?
Some people don't think Ni
xon's classes would be worth at
tending. I beg to differ.
Face it, everybody will be there
— if only to laugh at him yammer
ing away behind the podium with
its "SEAL OF THE OFFICE OF
THE EX-PRESIDENT.''
His exams might be a little
tricky. "Question 3: Without leav
ing your seat, copy in this space
the answer to question 2 as given
by the person seated four places
to your left, and then erase 18.5
words of it."
But there's always a bright side
— he'd probably temporarily
abolish the Honor Code.
Let me at that waiting list.

Not only would he step up our
aerial attack immensely, but if the
team wasn't doing well aainst
USC, it would turn and attack the
crowd and still call it a victory.
Having Dick around would
solve our perennial mascot prob
lem, too. The band could just
parade him around at half-time as
the ultimate representation of a
Robber Baron.
And the financial implications:
We could get the money. We
could get two million dollars. It
would be hard, but we could get
it."
A man with that kind of attitude
belongs in the planning office. Put

him and his friends to work, and
we'd have a new library in no time.
Imagine: "The Bebe Rebozo
Memorial Library" — with the ITT
Tape Erasing Studio in the base
ment.
Practical training
The political science depart
ment is overflowing with courses
on political theory, but we need to
provide budding young politicos
with more practical vocational
training.
The syllabus for "Running a
Government For Fun and Profit"
(PS 68) would include such topics
as "Fighting Major Wars Without
Even Telling Your Friends,"
"Creative Appointments." "The
Difference Between Blame and
Responsibility," "How To Help an
Opposing Candidate and Win
Big" — and for emergency use
only, "Saving Your Neck with
Phlebitis of the Leg."
The Law School would not be
able to resist inviting such a dis
tinguished legal scholar.
He could explain to future Perry

Masons and John Mitchells such
complex legal concepts as: the
constitutional right of the Presi
dent to wiretap his mother if she
drinks Russian tea, the freedom of
speech considered as a typog
raphical error and capital punish
ment for aggravated pornog
raphy.
Worth attending?
Some people don't think Ni
xon's classes would be worth at
tending. I beg to differ.
Face it, everybody will be there
— if only to laugh at him yammer
ing away behind the podium with
its "SEAL OF THE OFFICE OF
THE EX-PRESIDENT.''
His exams might be a little
tricky. "Question 3: Without leav
ing your seat, copy in this space
the answer to question 2 as given
by the person seated four places
to your left, and then erase 18.5
words of it."
But there's always a bright side
— he'd probably temporarily
abolish the Honor Code.
Let me at that waiting list.
Dave Ansley is a Daily staffer.
"Committee offers Nixon, Davis
spring guest teaching positions."
What? Tricky Dick? At our
humble West Coast bastion of
pseudo-intellectual somewhat
liberal semi-innovative educa
tion? The mind encounters dif
ficulties grasping the mere con
cept.
But why not? I think it would be a
grand idea to invite the turkey.
Heck, let's offer him a permanent
position. Just think of the advan
tages:
The Guest Professorship Board
(five poor folks who have spent
two years trying to give away
$10,000) has already tried twice to
obtain guest profs.
House arrest
Unfortunately, Nguyen Huu
Thai, a South Vietnamese scholar
and journalist, was placed under
house arrest in Saigon shortly
after hearing from Stanford.
Fergio Bitar, a Chilean
economist and educator, was al
ready in jail at the time of his invite.
On the basis of that record alone,
we should have asked Nixon
years ago.
But, you ponder, assuming the
ploy falls through, what would he
do for us if we were stuck with
him? What couldn't he do?
Just fcr starters: his record
breaking gridiron performances at
Whittier College qualifies him
handily for the post of head foot
ball coach.
