Yosemite update
Editor:
Kitty Boone's letter in the Jan.
20 Daily was in error in regards to
workbooks for the Yosemite Na
tional Park's Master Plan.
As of Jan. 5, requests for work
books were no longer being ac
cepted. Workbooks were still
being distributed by mail only
through the week of Jan. 15.
For those receiving workbooks,
it is important that:
1) They take a few hours to
study it carefully and completely.
Those with questions should seek
advice from friends, conservation
groups or resource centers.
2) They fill out the lower half of
the last sheet and return it

(postage-free) by Jan. 31, 1976.

which has forced the University to
take some students with scores
somewhat lower than those of
other students."
