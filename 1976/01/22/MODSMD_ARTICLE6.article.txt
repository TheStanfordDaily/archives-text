## Fired prof Franklin returns to campus

Former Assoc. English Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin, fired from his tenured faculty post in
1972, will speak today at 7:30 p.m. in Cubber
ley Auditorium as part of Disorientation
Week, sponsored by the Alliance for Radical
Change.
An authority on novelist Herman Melville,
Franklin is the first tenured professor to be
dismissed from Stanford's faculty.
Franklin filed suit against the University to
regain his job, and also has a lawsuit pending
against the regents of the University of Col
orado, who refused to hire him in 1974.
U.S. District Court Judge Alfred Arraj said
yesterday he would issue his ruling on
Franklin's suit against the Colorado Univer
sity Board of Regents at a later date, accord
ing to the Associated Press. Testimony in the
hearing concluded Tuesday.
Franklin's attorney, Anthony Renzo, ar
gued in his closing arguments that the re
gents voted not to hire Franklin because they
disagreed with his political views.
Richard Tharp, an assistant Colorado at
torney general who represented the regents,

said Franklin was not hired because of his
behavior while serving as a professor here.
In 1972, a faculty advisory board charged
that Franklin viewed "the University as a
central agent in domestic repression and in
an imperialist foreign policy."
After hearing one million words of tes
timony, the board charged that he had incited
occupation of the computer center, urged de
fiance of a police order to disperse and called
for violent action at a night rally.
President Richard Lyman and the Stanford
Board of Trustees upheld the faculty board's
decision.
Franklin, an avowed Marxist-Maoist re
volutionary, called the decision "fascist."
Claiming that his firing was an infringement
on his academic freedom and a flagrant viola
tion of the First Amendment, Franklin said
recently, "I think the suit is just as important
now as it was before."
Franklin was originally a member of the
Revolutionary Union, a San Jose-based
group which split in 1971. Franklin left it at
that time to join Venceremos, a now defunct
Mid-Peninsula revolutionary group.
