Carla Hills, secretary of Housing and
Urban Development, will be this year's com
mencement speaker, Senior Class President
Walt Spevak announced yesterday.
Hills, 41, a member of the Class of 1955,
was the first choice of the Commencement
Speaker Selection Committee, according to
Marie Fiatarone, a senior class officer. Hills
will be the first woman to act as the gradua
tion speaker.
"She was suggested by students and also
by the Center for Research on Women,"
Fiatarone explained.
The secrecy surrounding the selection
process has been criticized by a few stu
dents, Fiatarone said.
Why secrecy?
"There were complaints from people who
wanted to know before the candidate was
chosen (who it would be). We didn't see any
other way to do it; we couldn't just make the
list of names in the order we wanted them
public," Fiatarone commented.
The senior class officers conducted both
telephone and written surveys to sound out
opinions of graduating students, she said.
Hills, daughter of a building supplies mil
lionaire from Beverly Hills, was captain of the
women's tennis team here. She also was a
history major on the dean's list, and studied
at Oxford a year before graduation.
She attended Yale Law School, where she
graduated 20th in a class of 167 in 1958. For
the next three years, she was an assistant
U.S. attorney in Los Angeles.
Private law firm
Later, she set up a private law firm with her
husband and friends, taught at UCLA and
co-authored two books, Federal Civil Prac
tice and Anti-Trust Adviser.
Hills will address graduating students and
guests at 10 a.m., Sunday, June 13, in Frost

Amphitheater.
She was selected early this quarter by the
Commencement Speaker Selection Commit
tee, which includes the four senior class of
ficers, Assistant to the President William
Stone, Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Rosenzweig and Law Prof. Kenneth
Scott.
HiJls received two invitations, one from the
senior class officers and one from the selec
tion committee, Fiatarone said. Additionally,
President Richard Lyman telephoned her to
request her appearance, according to
Fiatarone.
