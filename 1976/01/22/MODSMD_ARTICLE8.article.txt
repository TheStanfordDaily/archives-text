## Prof Pribram denies secretary's charges 
### BERT BOWER 
Psychiatry and Psychology Prof. Karl
Pribram, accused of attacking and beating
his personal secretary, filed a denial of the
charges in Santa Clara County Superior
Court last Friday.
Barbara Honegger, Pribram's former sec
retary, had filed a four-court civil suit on Dec.
19 charging assault, assault and battery,
false imprisonment and intentional infliction
of emotional distress.
The response, filed by Pribram's attorney,
Leon Shiells, categorically denied all four
charges. It made no mention, however, of
Pribram's whereabouts or actions on the
night of the alleged incident.
"A general denial has been filed, but there
have been no discovery proceedings as of
the present time,'' Shiells said yesterday.
Honegger's suit charges that Pribram
"assaulted, beat and struck" her at 5:45
p.m., Oct. 29.
Repeated assaults
During a 14-month period before the inci
dent the suit claims that Pribram repeatedly
assaulted Honegger by "willfully, intention
ally and maliciously shouting abuse and in
sults at her. threatening by gesture her per
sonal safety, and by violently pounding on
her desk."
The false imprisonment charge stems

from Honegger's allegation that Pribram
"trapped her at her U-shaped desk, blocking
any exit she might have with his own body;
thus preventing her from fleeing from the
room and from his attacks on her."
The suit also says that as a "direct and
proximate" result of the incident, Honegger
was caused "great mental suffering and
emotional distress with the result that she
was repeatedly bedridden with severe mig
raine headaches which caused her tempor
ary blindness and loss of feeling in the right
side of her body."
Damages asked
Honegger is asking for $25,000 in general
damages, $25,000 in punitive and
exemplary damages, $47.35 in medical
costs, the costs of the lawsuit and whatever
other relief is granted by the courts.
In addition to Honegger's suit, two other
actions are being taken in response to the
alleged incident. The University is trying to
reach a private agreement with Pribram, and
Honegger has filed an assault and battery
grievance in accordance with the Universi
ty's grievance procedure.
"The University is not a party to the law
suit," said James Siena, legal adviser to the
president. "Negotiations between Professor
Pribram and the University are being hand
led m confidence," he added.

CHARGES DENIED — Psychology and Psychiatry Prof. KarJ Pribram has been
accused of assault and battery by his former secretary, Barbara Honegger. Pribram
last Friday filed a denial of the charges.
Psychiatry and Psychology Prof. Karl
Pribram, accused of attacking and beating
his personal secretary, filed a denial of the
charges in Santa Clara County Superior
Court last Friday.
Barbara Honegger, Pribram's former sec
retary, had filed a four-court civil suit on Dec.
19 charging assault, assault and battery,
false imprisonment and intentional infliction
of emotional distress.
The response, filed by Pribram's attorney,
Leon Shiells, categorically denied all four
charges. It made no mention, however, of
Pribram's whereabouts or actions on the
night of the alleged incident.
"A general denial has been filed, but there
have been no discovery proceedings as of
the present time,'' Shiells said yesterday.
Honegger's suit charges that Pribram
"assaulted, beat and struck" her at 5:45
p.m., Oct. 29.
Repeated assaults
During a 14-month period before the inci
dent the suit claims that Pribram repeatedly
assaulted Honegger by "willfully, intention
ally and maliciously shouting abuse and in
sults at her. threatening by gesture her per
sonal safety, and by violently pounding on
her desk."
The false imprisonment charge stems

from Honegger's allegation that Pribram
"trapped her at her U-shaped desk, blocking
any exit she might have with his own body;
thus preventing her from fleeing from the
room and from his attacks on her."
The suit also says that as a "direct and
proximate" result of the incident, Honegger
was caused "great mental suffering and
emotional distress with the result that she
was repeatedly bedridden with severe mig
raine headaches which caused her tempor
ary blindness and loss of feeling in the right
side of her body."
Damages asked
Honegger is asking for $25,000 in general
damages, $25,000 in punitive and
exemplary damages, $47.35 in medical
costs, the costs of the lawsuit and whatever
other relief is granted by the courts.
In addition to Honegger's suit, two other
actions are being taken in response to the
alleged incident. The University is trying to
reach a private agreement with Pribram, and
Honegger has filed an assault and battery
grievance in accordance with the Universi
ty's grievance procedure.
"The University is not a party to the law
suit," said James Siena, legal adviser to the
president. "Negotiations between Professor
Pribram and the University are being hand
led m confidence," he added.
