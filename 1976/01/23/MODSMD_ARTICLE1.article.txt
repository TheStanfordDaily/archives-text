# Schools' unification debated
## 
### STEVE HEFTER 
Last Oct. 9, the Santa Clara County
Committee on School District Organi
zation approved a proposed merger be
tween the Palo Alto Unified School
District and schools in southern San
Mateo County.
Last night, that same committee re
considered its action as more than 500
community residents, most of them
opposed to the merger, attended a pub
lic hearing at Palo Alto's Cunn High
School.
"This is the '70s and not the"'6os,
and the problems of race and educa
tion are not the same today as they
were then," stated Gretchen Williams,
a Palo Alto resident. "We have worked
hard, and we do not want to under
mine community identity and pride."
Nonconforming proposal
In speaking against the merger, Wil
liams and others concurred with a con
tention of Richard Bowers, legal con
sultant to the Santa Clara County
committee, that the proposal does not
meet the State Education Code re
quirement of "substantial community
identity."
However, the code does not de
scribe the necessary elements of such a
"substantial community identity."
Bowers, in recommending that the
proposal be defeated, admitted that it
does meet all other Education Code re
quirements, including financial ones.
A parallel committee in San Mateo
County voted against the proposed
merger last Dec. 8. Under state law, if
one county supports a schools merger
while the other opposes, the matter
goes to the State Board of Education,
which can authorize a plebiscite on the
question.
Ravenswood closing
In a related development, the U.S.
Department of Health, Education and
Welfare revealed yesterday that it has
approved plans to close Ravenswood
High School.
The predominantly black commun
ity school will be closed by the six
school Sequoia Union High School
District in June. The district will reas
sign about 1500 students district-wide
in an attempt to achieve racial balance.
In a suit filed by parents of some
Ravenswood students, charging the
move is unconstitutional because it
deprives the black community of its
only public high school and would in
crease busing, a hearing has been
scheduled for Tuesday in U.S. District
Court in San Francisco.
