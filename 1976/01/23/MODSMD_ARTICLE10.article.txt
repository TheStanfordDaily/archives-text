# CIA to blame for agent's death
## 
### 
Last Dec. 23, assassins gunned
down Richard Welch, the ClA's
station chief in Athens, Greece.
President Gerald Ford and CIA
Director William Colby seized
upon this tragic act, in the words
of New York Times columnist
Anthony Lewis, "to arouse a
public backlash against legiti
mate criticism" of the CIA.
Colby began the campaign by
attacking the magazine Coun
terspy which published Welch's
name and CIA status last winter.
Colby, in an attempt to silence
the magazine, implied that
Counterspy bore the responsibil
ity for Welch's name being pub
lished by the Athens News
shortly before his assassination.
Actually, Welch's cover had
been blown back in 1968 by an
East German publication. Most
American journalists in Athens
knew Welch was CIA station
chief, and anyone consulting the
State Department's Biographic
Register could have determined
his real employer quickly
enough.
Campaign
The Ford Administration's
public campaign to focus atten
tion on the case and win sym
pathy for the CIA climaxed two
weeks after Welch's death, when
President Ford, Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger and Colby
attended funderal services for
Welch.
In a highly unusual move,
Ford permitted Welch to be
buried at Arlington National

Cemetery, normally reserved to
members of the armed forces.
While a military band played
"America the Beautiful," Colby
presented the American flag to
Welch's wife.
"They are using the casket as a
podium,"Counterspy writerand
Vietnam veteran Tim Butz

rightly observes. "We know
they're really after (Sen. Frank)
Church (D-Idaho) and (Rep. Otis)
Pike (D-N.Y.) and the other cri
tics. It was safe to go after us be
cause nobody had ever heard of
us."
Legislation
Ford and Colby now hope to
capitalize on public revulsion
over the assassination to pass
legislation restricting First
Amendment rights to publish in
formation on he CIA.
The CIA has asked the Justice
Department to determine
whether Counterspy violated
federal laws by publishing
Richard Welch's true identity. A
CIA spokesman recently re
vealed that the Ford Administra
tion plans to propose a law im
posing criminal penalties

against former agents who re
lease information that might en
danger American spies.
Rep. Robert Michel, the Re
publican whip from Illinois,
wants to make it a federal crime
for anybody to publish the iden
tity of any American intelligence
agent.
Who's to blame?
The CIA would have us be
lieve that Counterspy and those
who support its criticisms of the
CIA are really to blame for
Welch's death. Counterspy
editors reply that "if anyone is to
blame for Mr. Welch's death it is
the CIA that sent him there to
spy, perhaps even to intervene in
the affairs of the Greek Govern
ment."
In a sense, it was appropriate
that Welch was buried in a milit
ary cemetery. For he was repre
senting an agency that routinely
— and proudly — conducts
covert war against nations and
peoples around the globe.
Colby himself, for example,
oversaw the assassination of
over 20,000 civilians in Vietnam
under "Operation Phoenix."
It is unreasonable to suppose

that agents who work for such a
subversive and hated organiza
tion can be exempt from risk.
Indeed, it is surprising that so
few CIA agents have been killed,
especially in Greece, where the
people are scarred with the
memory of seven years of rule by
the CLA-supported military dic
tatorship.
The Greek people also re
member how the CIA funneled
money to the right-wing Greek
terrorist Nicos Sampson who
precipitated the Cyprus crisis by
overthrowing President
Makarios with U.S. foreknow
ledge. As many Greeks probably
knew, Welch worked for the CIA
in Cyprus from 1960 to 1964.
Welch's tragic death will have
been totally in vain if the CIA
manages to shift all the blame to
its legitimate critics/The real
criminals are those who arrogate
to themselves the right to man
ipulate, with impunity, the lives
and politics of other peoples.
