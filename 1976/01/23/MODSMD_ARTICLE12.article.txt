Ford's bungling
Editor:
I recall a cartoon by Fat
Oliphant in which President
Gerald Ford has just stumbled
down the steps leading from Air
Force One, with Kissinger com
menting: "I told him to take that
gum out of his mouth."
Ford has become, by almost
any standard, a butt of almost
any joke imaginable — what was
once a "Pollack" joke is now a
"Jerry" joke. Naturally the jokes
seem funny, and some actually
are, but the growing imperative
toward ad hominem attacks on
Ford distract from the real issue:
Ford's lacklustre, mediocre per
formance as President.
The media has teetered from
legitimate criticism of presiden
tial incompetence to the meret
ricious issue of personal clumsi
ness. Ford has become little
more than an avuncular court
jester, not a respected leader.
I do not want to suggest Ford
deserves respect by virtue of his
office, but at least he' deserves
honest, frank criticism and not
puerile, below-the-belt attacks.
Ford's incompetence does not
stem from his imperfect diction
or his occasional stumbles, but
rather from his impotence as a
leader (which could be due in
part to his public image as a
bungler).
Ford's reputation as a klutz,
though unfair, is certainly sym
bolic of his Presidency— bumbl
ing and without direction or
coherence. But this does not jus
tify personal attacks.
Some columnists have gone so
far as to suggest Ford's political
livelihood is jeopardized because
of his newfound position as a
buffoon; perhaps this is so. This
is the tragedy of his leadership.
Unfortunately Ford has not
grown into his job the way Harry
Truman did. But it is even more
unfortunate that Ford cannot
even be taken seriously any
more.

Downward sloping
Ed i tor:
One hopes the level of
economic analysis implied in
the quotation of Director of
Faculty-Staff Housing Robert
Summers in the Jan. 15 Daily,
that "should the (Pearce Mitch
ell) units not fill by next summer
... a hike in . . . prices may be
needed ..." is not representa
tive of Stanford.
Some of us are still teaching
that demand curves slope
downward. Of course, raising
the price may make the bed
rooms seem larger.

Blackboard use
Editor:
I'm tired of seeing announce
ments written on class
blackboards. 1 don't care who
"Josh" is, he doesn't belong in
the lecture hall.
It is both rude and distracting
to students; it is unfair to profes
sors who may need the use of the
entire blackboard, but are in
timidated by the "please save"
signs scrawled underneath the
announcements.
There is plenty of ad space
outside of classrooms. It is time
the University curtailed Josh and
his perpetrators.
