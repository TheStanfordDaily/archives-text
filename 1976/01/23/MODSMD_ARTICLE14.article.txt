# 'Disorientation' draws mixed reviews
## Radicals shake student apathy 
### ALEXANDER LEFF JOHN ROOS 
Suddenly, it is as though the radical 1960s
had returned.
Students flock to workshops to learn how to
relate their work here to the outside world.
Marxist speakers urge students to re
volutionize society. And fired Stanford En
glish Prof. H. Bruce Franklin denounces Stan
ford's links to capitalist interests.
Has The Movement risen from the grave?
Not quite. The sudden flurry of interest in radi
cal politics witnessed on campus this week
seems to have been the direct result of the or
ganization of Disorientation Week by the Al
liance for Radical Change (ARC).
But organizers contend that the nine-day
Disorientation Week, which will continue
through tomorrow might be a prelude to an
upsurge of political activism on campus.
Senior Larry Litvak, an ARC member, de
scribed the series of speeches and workshops
as "an attempt to raise students' political con
sciousness".
He said that he hopes the activities will in
spire students to join ARC's upcoming cam
paign against Senate Bill 1, which the ARC
contends unconstitutionally curbs freedom of
speech and the press.
Litvak added that the Disorientation Week
may also help enlist student support for
the ARC's attempt to persuade the University
to allow the United Stanford Employee's
Union (USE) to picket Encina Hall.
Terry Bright, another ARC member, agreed
with Litvak that the response to Disorientation
is encouraging.
"We have been very pleased at the turnout"
at Disorientation Week events, Bright said.
The leftist alternative
Bright explained that Disorientation Week
was an attempt to expose people to alternative
analyses of contemporary society.
"We want people to hear perspectives that
are not normally presented at Stanford," she
added.
In order to present such views to students,
ARC attracted a host of luminaries to campus.
Herbert Marcuse, Marxist social critic and
philosopher,exhorted students Tuesday to be
come involved in politics in order to stem the
growing tide of facism.
Later in the week, David Dellinger, former
"Chicago Seven" defendant, warned students
about the concentration of power in big busi
ness and the federal government.
This theme was amplified Wednesday when
radical defense lawyers Charles Garry and
Leonard Weinglass spoke on "the Legal Sys
tem and Repression."
Yesterday, H. Bruce Franklin, fired from
Stanford in 1972 for allegedly inciting stu
dents to violence, gave a fiery speech in his old
style, attacking the "repressiveness" of this
University.
Faculty involved, too
The activities also drew considerable faculty
support, with many faculty members par
ticipating in panel discussions following

speeches.
"(The program) had a nice academic qual
ity," Political Science Prof. Hubert Marshall
said. "The week was exactly what any good
campus should have going on — so that people
can have a taste of new ideas and get ac
quainted with them even if they will not finally
embrace them."
But Steve Vettel of Columbae House, a center
for radical activities, criticized the week for the
same reason that Marshall praised it.
"It is too academic," he complained. "A lot
of talking is going on but nothing is getting
done."
Bright explained that the week's academic
emphasis was determined by the need for
funding.
Limosene liberals?
"We've been criticized because of the pre
ponderance of white male academics on our
programs," she said. "The critics are right, but
we had to do it this way to get funding."
The bill for Disorientation Week came to

$3000, Bright said.
It was funded by a wide variety of campus
groups, including ARC, the ASSU Council of
Presidents and the Office of the Dean of Under
graduate Studies.
The administration helped pay every
speaker except Franklin, Litvak said.
Administrative financial support for Dis
orientation Week drew fire from several con
servative students.
Bill MacDougall, a member of the Stanford
Conservative Students Union, termed such
support "questionable."
"I don't know if so much money should be
spent for such a one-sided event," MacDougall
said. "A real University is universal and sup
ports the presentation of diverse opinions."
MacDougall, who attended several of the
events and said he was "very impressed with
the caliber of speakers ARC was able to get,','
criticized the speakers for taking radical theory
as a given rather than defending their basic
premises.
MacDougall and other conservative students
said they doubted that the week would serve to
change the political attitudes of many stu
dents.
ARC members, while acknowledging the
conservative tendencies of many students
here, expressed hope that Disorientation Week
would encourage some students to move left.
"The students here know they have got it
made in the present system," Bright said.
"Many feel threatened if you start questioning
the establishment."
"But there is a potential for politicizing Stan
ford," Bright added. "There is concern here."
Marshall agreed. "It is not that students are
more conservative now — they are quite liberal
in their views on war, consumerism and en
vironmentalism — but they are certainly less
activist than they were a few years ago. Of
course, there is no crisis, and no leader around
which to rally," he said.
Bright and other ARC members therefore
cautiously termed Disorientation Week a suc
cess — at least so far.
"What the week is showing," Bright said, "is
that the Left is alive and thinking."
