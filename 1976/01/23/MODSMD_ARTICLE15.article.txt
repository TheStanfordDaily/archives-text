# Senate tries to shed doldrums
## 
### LORI MATSUKAWA 
The ASSU Senate seems to have been largely
ignored by the University administration for
most of this year.
Many senators lament the brush-off from the
upper echelons of the University because they
contend that the senate.as the students' voice,
should be heard.
Some senators say it is lack of student sup
port and the unwillingness of the senators
themselves to research issues and make practi
cal recommendations that has hurt the senate's
power.
Another factor that may be weakening the
senate structure is the presence of a political
dichotomy within its ranks.
But most senators hope that their organiza
tion won't be ignored much longer.
The Students Taking A New Direction
(STAND) faction of the senate, composed of
one graduate and seven undergraduate stu
dents, will meet this Saturday to discuss their
positions on tenure, the mini-bus service and
the soon-to-be-released University budget.
"We're taking the responsibility for getting
the senate off its ass," said Sen. Seth Foldy,

STAND member.
"We promised to do it," Foldy said. "We
may or may not be able to do it."
Doing their homework
STAND senators consulted the Budget
Priorities Committee in order to become in
formed on the budget, said Sen. Bill Tyndall.
Tynall suggested that the administration ig
nores most senate stands because "the senate
isn't educated enough on the issues to pass
strong resolutions."
Sen. Elizabeth Larkam, another STAND
member, agreed that "small groups should
tackle issues on their own" and feels that the
senate has been unproductive this year be
cause "we don't have our teeth on any (particu
lar) issue."
STAND senators hope to present definite,
well-researched proposals for senate action
during the remainder of the year.
Much ado about nothing?
"We want to bring up issues that are impor
tant," said Tyndall. "Little issues take time and
cause internal hassles," Tyndall added.
The "little issues" seem to include the bon
fire and mascot issues which Foldy described

as "absurd" and which he contends could have
been settled outside of the legislative system.
Some senators contend that STAND'S in
terests decrease the efficiency of the Senate.
"The STAND faction is activist and more
interested in outside issues like the U.N.
(anti-Zionist) resolution. It doesn't concern the
students themselves," said Sen. Barbara Riz
zardi.
"STAND won't consult the other members
on an issue" said Sen. Brad Krevoy.
Sen. Kevin McDermott said because the
"STAND slate has cohesive goals," it may
make it hard to organize an all-encompassing
plan of action for the senate that would please
everyone.
"All they've done is split themselves off
from the rest of the senate," added McDermott.
The senate, then, is split and uncertain on a
distinct set of issues towards which its future
energies may be channeled. This explains in
part why it has not passed many bills this year.
STAND has started efforts towards develop
ing goals as well as other senators not on the
slate. It is clear that the senate must decide on
its future course quickly, and as a united body.
