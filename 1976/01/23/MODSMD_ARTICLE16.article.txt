# Theme housing: an idea that keeps growing
## 
### STEPHEN CROLIUS 
Next year at this time, as many as eight new
housing programs could be looking back at
their inception from the perspective of estab
lished entities, just as the French House and
the Stanford-in-Stanford program are doing
now.
So far, two of this year's proposals have
cleared the first hurdle on the way to becoming
actual residences; they have been approved by
the Committee on Student Services (COSS)
subcommittee for residential education.
The proposals, one for an American Studies
Theme House and one for an Italian Theme

House, face next the perhaps more formidable
challenge of being approved by COSS itself.
The success of the French House apparently
had an influence in the preliminary acceptance
of the Italian House.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton
is quick to make it understood that if the Italian
House receives final approval, it will be model
led after the French House, and will not be a
"cultural center" in the same sense as the
black, Native American, chicano, or Asian
American Theme Houses are cultural centers.
The French House has won high praise from
its first year residents, particularly regarding

its "cuisine."
Life in the house has variously been de
scribed as 'terrific," "all right," and "better
than the trailers," while the food, prepared by a
gourmet cook, has uniformly been called "out
standing."
Presumably with the rich Italian heritage of
cooking and hospitality, literature and the arts,
the Italian House should meet with similar
success.
The American Studies House, if it receives
final acceptance, will join Columbae ("social
change through non-violence,") Ham
merskjold ("international understanding,")
and Synergy ("alternative lifestyles,") among
other houses not associated with a specific cul
tural or ethnic group.

Obtaining a theme house in its first year as a
department would undoubtedly prove a great
boon to the recently created American Studies
Department.
)ewish proposal
This is the third consecutive year in which a
group of Jewish students and faculty have
submitted a proposal for a Jewish Theme
House. Robert Smith, a junior majoring in his
tory, helped draw up and submit this year's
proposal.
"According to everything 1 know,"he said,
"and especially the comments from people on
the committee, the proposal we developed this
year was the strongest and the best that has
ever been proposed for a Jewish Theme House.
I don't think the others (from the last two years)
were as solid as this one."
Rejection expected again
Unofficial reports, however, indicate that
the Jewish Theme House proposal will proba
bly be rejected again this year. Smith said on
Wednesday that his group has requested the
COSS subcommittee to outline in writing its
reasons for rejecting the proposal.
Any proposal that does receive approval
from the COSS subcommittee and COSS itself,
is assured of being put into effect. The only
question left at that point is where the new
programs will be implemented.
Last year, starting with 26 possibilities —
virtually every residence on campus — the
choice was narrowed down to six houses to
accomodate the French House and the Stan
ford-in-Stanford program.
The residents of the houses that eventually
were selected were disgruntled at being dis
placed, though they did receive priority for
relocation elsewhere.
This year it is conceivable that no one will be
displaced if the proposals that meet with final
approval are located in the two new row
houses. Whether this will be the case is at the
moment a subject of pure speculation.

Presumably with the rich Italian heritage of
cooking and hospitality, literature and the arts,
the Italian House should meet with similar
success.
The American Studies House, if it receives
final acceptance, will join Columbae ("social
change through non-violence,") Ham
merskjold ("international understanding,")
and Synergy ("alternative lifestyles,") among
other houses not associated with a specific cul
tural or ethnic group.

Obtaining a theme house in its first year as a
department would undoubtedly prove a great
boon to the recently created American Studies
Department.
)ewish proposal
This is the third consecutive year in which a
group of Jewish students and faculty have
submitted a proposal for a Jewish Theme
House. Robert Smith, a junior majoring in his
tory, helped draw up and submit this year's
proposal.
"According to everything 1 know,"he said,
"and especially the comments from people on
the committee, the proposal we developed this
year was the strongest and the best that has
ever been proposed for a Jewish Theme House.
I don't think the others (from the last two years)
were as solid as this one."
Rejection expected again
Unofficial reports, however, indicate that
the Jewish Theme House proposal will proba
bly be rejected again this year. Smith said on
Wednesday that his group has requested the
COSS subcommittee to outline in writing its
reasons for rejecting the proposal.
Any proposal that does receive approval
from the COSS subcommittee and COSS itself,
is assured of being put into effect. The only
question left at that point is where the new
programs will be implemented.
Last year, starting with 26 possibilities —
virtually every residence on campus — the
choice was narrowed down to six houses to
accomodate the French House and the Stan
ford-in-Stanford program.
The residents of the houses that eventually
were selected were disgruntled at being dis
placed, though they did receive priority for
relocation elsewhere.
This year it is conceivable that no one will be
displaced if the proposals that meet with final
approval are located in the two new row
houses. Whether this will be the case is at the
moment a subject of pure speculation.

Next year at this time, as many as eight new
housing programs could be looking back at
their inception from the perspective of estab
lished entities, just as the French House and
the Stanford-in-Stanford program are doing
now.
So far, two of this year's proposals have
cleared the first hurdle on the way to becoming
actual residences; they have been approved by
the Committee on Student Services (COSS)
subcommittee for residential education.
The proposals, one for an American Studies
Theme House and one for an Italian Theme

House, face next the perhaps more formidable
challenge of being approved by COSS itself.
The success of the French House apparently
had an influence in the preliminary acceptance
of the Italian House.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton
is quick to make it understood that if the Italian
House receives final approval, it will be model
led after the French House, and will not be a
"cultural center" in the same sense as the
black, Native American, chicano, or Asian
American Theme Houses are cultural centers.
The French House has won high praise from
its first year residents, particularly regarding

its "cuisine."
Life in the house has variously been de
scribed as 'terrific," "all right," and "better
than the trailers," while the food, prepared by a
gourmet cook, has uniformly been called "out
standing."
