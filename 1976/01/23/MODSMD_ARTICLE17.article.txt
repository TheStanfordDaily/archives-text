Adrienne Rich is probably
the most important woman
poet writing in America to
day. She is still at the height
of her powers, and in the next
few years she will certainly
continue to dazzle her public.
Recently Stanford has pre
sented two separate docu
ments of Rich's active career.
One is a recording, the other
an annotated volume of her
poetry. Each presentation has
much to offer, but their merits
differ.
Adrienne Rich Reading At
Stanford is a remarkably un
ique record.
Most recorded readings
tend self-consciously to rep
resent the full range of the au
thor's career. Such records
almost always become aural
versions of a "selected
poems" with representative
offerings from each stage of
their development.
While the archival value of
this approach is very high, its
deliberate nature dilutes the
excitement of the occasion.
The author usually reads
poems written 20 years be
fore, and the rendition, how
ever authentic, often reveals
distance between the poet
and the poem more than their
affinity.
Adrienne Rich Reading At
Stanford offers an exciting
contrast to the standard idea
of recorded poetry.
This recording, which was
made here live in January,
1973, vividly portrays one

moment in Rich's dynamic
career.
Almost all the poems that
she read came from one
pivotal volume, Diving Into
The Wreck, reading specifi
cally in the highly politicized
atmosphere of the early '70s.
Rich is as nearly an ac
complished reader as she is a
poet. The controlled anger of
her reading underscores the
thematic and stylistic unity of
the poems she chose into
what must be one of the most
exciting and engaging poetry
recordings ever made.
An aggressive reading
Adrienne Rich Reading At
Stanford is tantamount to an
alternate version of Diving
Into The Wreck.
While the recording is a
"live" version of the book, it
is also a more aggressive ver
sion. With the record the lis
tener cannot take the book in
at his own pace, stopping,
skipping and rereading at
will. The poet sets her own
relentless pace and the lis
tener must follow her.
The results are both excit
ing and exhausting. While
the shortcomings of the re
corded media for poetry are
obvious, anyone who doubts
that poetry can be over
whelmingly powerful at one
listening would be well
advised to listen to this re
cord.
Amidst the complacency of
bicentennial America.it is dif
ficult to recapture the inten
sity of self-evaluation that
erupted in our country even
fiva years ago.
Rich's reading recreates the
anxious self-consciousness of
the period without indulging
in the intellectual mediocrity
that often appears in such tes
timonies seen in retrospect.

In the context of her read
ing potentially histrionic
lines acquire an absolutely
sincere emotional and intel
lectual quality:
Madness. Suicide. Murder.
Is there no way out but
these?

Such lines could easily be
come cliches (a cursory look
at the work of many contem
porary American poets will
show you how often they
have become just that).
But Rich is usually able to
write poems that will support
the weight of such questions.
She choses big themes, takes
big chances and, when she
succeeds (which is surpris
ingly often), achieves propor
tionate results.
Although the Stanford re

cording has done Rich a great
service in allowing her to
speak in her own words other
factions of the university
have not been so modest.
Two Stanford faculty
members, Albert Gelpi and
Barbara Chatsworth Gelpi,

have compiled an annotated
volume of her poetry for clas
sroom use. The merits of this
venture are very ambiguous.
It strikes me as slightly
ridiculous that a poet still in
her 40s requires a Norton
"Critical" Edition of her
work.
The intentions on the part
of the publisher also seem
highly suspect since Norton
is also Rich's usual publisher.
But now that rich has
joined the ranks, at least

commercially, of Homer,
Saint Augustine and Alfred
Lord Tennyson, the resulting
volume might be profitably
examined to see what Nor
ton's unprecedented canoni
zation of a living author adds
to our understanding of her
work.
The Norton Critical Edition
of Adrienne Rich's Poetry
contains 85 pages of heavily
annotated poetry and over
one hundred pages of
explicatory prose.
The poetry is a judicious
selection from Rich's eight
previous volumes. The prose
is an excellent selection of in
terviews, critical essays and
reviews.
Both the selection of poems
and criticism is somewhat
biased. In this volume Rich is
represented as the voice of the
women's movement at the
expense of her other aspects.
The essays that discuss
Rich's work in this volume
are brilliantly cogent.
But, as in the case of Nancy
Milford's persuasively per
sonal piece, they often dwell
obsessively on very limiting
aspects of Rich's work.
Academic middlemen
The real problem with this
"critical" edition is its copi
ous footnotes. This volume
helps perpetuate the myth
that contemporary poetry is
incomprehensible without
annotation.
One of the beauties of
Rich's poetry is her direct,
lucid style. There is nothing
so difficult about Rich's
poetry to require the 100-odd
footnotes supplied by the
well-meaning Gelpis.
Is an American poet of
Rich's directness unable to
talk to her own contem
poraries without an academic

middleman? I seriously
doubt it.
A puzi'Ung question is for
whom Celpi intended these
notes. When Rich mentions
"the Hell's Angels" the Gel
pis add "a motorcycle gang
that originated in Oakland."
How many Americans of
sufficient intellectual capac
ity to read modern poetry for
whatever reasons will not
have head of the Hell's
Angels?
And, moreover, if they have
never heard of this singular
organization, will the Gelpis'
colorless footnote do much to
convey the associations of
this gang's name?
The same criticism is
leveled at their annotation of
Milton as "an English poet"
or that a "red Triumphe
parked at the edge of the sea"
refers to "a sports car."
Do students have to be in
formed who Jonah was or
where the Bering Straits are? I
would guess not.
The Gelpis also define
none-too-difficult words
found in any dictionary like
autistic, implosion, and an
drogyne. Many of the foot
notes are either unnecessary
or unhelpful, and all of them
are obtrusive.
Norton has recently issued
Rich's Poems: Selected and
New in both hardcover and
paperback. This volume
selected by Rich herself
would serve as a much better
introduction to her work than
the Norton Critical Edition.
Only a tremendously un
confident or eager reader
would need the Gelpis' un
even volume in addition to
Rich's own selection. In fact,
if an introduction were
necessary .there could be no
better one than the Stanford
recording.

This recording, which was
made here live in January,
1973, vividly portrays one

moment in Rich's dynamic
career.
Almost all the poems that
she read came from one
pivotal volume, Diving Into
The Wreck, reading specifi
cally in the highly politicized
atmosphere of the early '70s.
Rich is as nearly an ac
complished reader as she is a
poet. The controlled anger of
her reading underscores the
thematic and stylistic unity of
the poems she chose into
what must be one of the most
exciting and engaging poetry
recordings ever made.
An aggressive reading
Adrienne Rich Reading At
Stanford is tantamount to an
alternate version of Diving
Into The Wreck.
While the recording is a
"live" version of the book, it
is also a more aggressive ver
sion. With the record the lis
tener cannot take the book in
at his own pace, stopping,
skipping and rereading at
will. The poet sets her own
relentless pace and the lis
tener must follow her.
The results are both excit
ing and exhausting. While
the shortcomings of the re
corded media for poetry are
obvious, anyone who doubts
that poetry can be over
whelmingly powerful at one
listening would be well
advised to listen to this re
cord.
Amidst the complacency of
bicentennial America.it is dif
ficult to recapture the inten
sity of self-evaluation that
erupted in our country even
fiva years ago.
Rich's reading recreates the
anxious self-consciousness of
the period without indulging
in the intellectual mediocrity
that often appears in such tes
timonies seen in retrospect.

In the context of her read
ing potentially histrionic
lines acquire an absolutely
sincere emotional and intel
lectual quality:
Madness. Suicide. Murder.
Is there no way out but
these?

Such lines could easily be
come cliches (a cursory look
at the work of many contem
porary American poets will
show you how often they
have become just that).
But Rich is usually able to
write poems that will support
the weight of such questions.
She choses big themes, takes
big chances and, when she
succeeds (which is surpris
ingly often), achieves propor
tionate results.
Although the Stanford re

cording has done Rich a great
service in allowing her to
speak in her own words other
factions of the university
have not been so modest.
Two Stanford faculty
members, Albert Gelpi and
Barbara Chatsworth Gelpi,

have compiled an annotated
volume of her poetry for clas
sroom use. The merits of this
venture are very ambiguous.
It strikes me as slightly
ridiculous that a poet still in
her 40s requires a Norton
"Critical" Edition of her
work.
The intentions on the part
of the publisher also seem
highly suspect since Norton
is also Rich's usual publisher.
But now that rich has
joined the ranks, at least

commercially, of Homer,
Saint Augustine and Alfred
Lord Tennyson, the resulting
volume might be profitably
examined to see what Nor
ton's unprecedented canoni
zation of a living author adds
to our understanding of her
work.
The Norton Critical Edition
of Adrienne Rich's Poetry
contains 85 pages of heavily
annotated poetry and over
one hundred pages of
explicatory prose.
The poetry is a judicious
selection from Rich's eight
previous volumes. The prose
is an excellent selection of in
terviews, critical essays and
reviews.
Both the selection of poems
and criticism is somewhat
biased. In this volume Rich is
represented as the voice of the
women's movement at the
expense of her other aspects.
The essays that discuss
Rich's work in this volume
are brilliantly cogent.
But, as in the case of Nancy
Milford's persuasively per
sonal piece, they often dwell
obsessively on very limiting
aspects of Rich's work.
Academic middlemen
The real problem with this
"critical" edition is its copi
ous footnotes. This volume
helps perpetuate the myth
that contemporary poetry is
incomprehensible without
annotation.
One of the beauties of
Rich's poetry is her direct,
lucid style. There is nothing
so difficult about Rich's
poetry to require the 100-odd
footnotes supplied by the
well-meaning Gelpis.
Is an American poet of
Rich's directness unable to
talk to her own contem
poraries without an academic

middleman? I seriously
doubt it.
A puzi'Ung question is for
whom Celpi intended these
notes. When Rich mentions
"the Hell's Angels" the Gel
pis add "a motorcycle gang
that originated in Oakland."
How many Americans of
sufficient intellectual capac
ity to read modern poetry for
whatever reasons will not
have head of the Hell's
Angels?
And, moreover, if they have
never heard of this singular
organization, will the Gelpis'
colorless footnote do much to
convey the associations of
this gang's name?
The same criticism is
leveled at their annotation of
Milton as "an English poet"
or that a "red Triumphe
parked at the edge of the sea"
refers to "a sports car."
Do students have to be in
formed who Jonah was or
where the Bering Straits are? I
would guess not.
The Gelpis also define
none-too-difficult words
found in any dictionary like
autistic, implosion, and an
drogyne. Many of the foot
notes are either unnecessary
or unhelpful, and all of them
are obtrusive.
Norton has recently issued
Rich's Poems: Selected and
New in both hardcover and
paperback. This volume
selected by Rich herself
would serve as a much better
introduction to her work than
the Norton Critical Edition.
Only a tremendously un
confident or eager reader

porary American poets will

the weight of such questions.
She choses big themes, takes
big chances and, when she
succeeds (which is surpris

her 40s requires a Norton
"Critical" Edition of her
work.
The intentions on the part

highly suspect since Norton

But now that rich has
joined the ranks, at least

commercially, of Homer,
Saint Augustine and Alfred
Lord Tennyson, the resulting
volume might be profitably
examined to see what Nor
ton's unprecedented canoni
zation of a living author adds
to our understanding of her
work.
The Norton Critical Edition
of Adrienne Rich's Poetry
contains 85 pages of heavily
annotated poetry and over
one hundred pages of
explicatory prose.
The poetry is a judicious
selection from Rich's eight
previous volumes. The prose

terviews, critical essays and
reviews.
Both the selection of poems
and criticism is somewhat
biased. In this volume Rich is
represented as the voice of the
women's movement at the
expense of her other aspects.
The essays that discuss
Rich's work in this volume
are brilliantly cogent.
But, as in the case of Nancy
Milford's persuasively per
sonal piece, they often dwell
obsessively on very limiting
aspects of Rich's work.
Academic middlemen

that contemporary poetry is
incomprehensible without
annotation.
One of the beauties of
Rich's poetry is her direct,
lucid style. There is nothing
so difficult about Rich's
poetry to require the 100-odd
footnotes supplied by the
well-meaning Gelpis.
Is an American poet of
Rich's directness unable to
talk to her own contem
poraries without an academic

middleman? I seriously
doubt it.
A puzi'Ung question is for
whom Celpi intended these
notes. When Rich mentions
"the Hell's Angels" the Gel
pis add "a motorcycle gang
that originated in Oakland."
How many Americans of
sufficient intellectual capac
ity to read modern poetry for
whatever reasons will not
have head of the Hell's
Angels?
And, moreover, if they have
never heard of this singular
organization, will the Gelpis'
colorless footnote do much to
convey the associations of
this gang's name?
The same criticism is
leveled at their annotation of
Milton as "an English poet"
or that a "red Triumphe
parked at the edge of the sea"
refers to "a sports car."
Do students have to be in
formed who Jonah was or
where the Bering Straits are? I
would guess not.
The Gelpis also define
none-too-difficult words
found in any dictionary like
autistic, implosion, and an
drogyne. Many of the foot
notes are either unnecessary
or unhelpful, and all of them
are obtrusive.
Norton has recently issued
Rich's Poems: Selected and
New in both hardcover and
paperback. This volume

Adrienne Rich is probably

of her powers, and in the next

continue to dazzle her public.
Recently Stanford has pre

their development.
While the archival value of
this approach is very high, its

excitement of the occasion.
The author usually reads
poems written 20 years be

distance between the poet
and the poem more than their
affinity.

This recording, which was

moment in Rich's dynamic

pivotal volume, Diving Into

cally in the highly politicized
atmosphere of the early '70s.

is also Rich's usual publisher.
But now that rich has
joined the ranks, at least

commercially, of Homer,
Saint Augustine and Alfred
Lord Tennyson, the resulting
volume might be profitably
examined to see what Nor
ton's unprecedented canoni
zation of a living author adds
to our understanding of her
work.
The Norton Critical Edition
of Adrienne Rich's Poetry
contains 85 pages of heavily
annotated poetry and over
one hundred pages of
explicatory prose.
The poetry is a judicious
selection from Rich's eight
previous volumes. The prose
is an excellent selection of in
terviews, critical essays and
reviews.
Both the selection of poems
and criticism is somewhat
biased. In this volume Rich is
represented as the voice of the
women's movement at the

The essays that discuss
Rich's work in this volume
are brilliantly cogent.
But, as in the case of Nancy

Academic middlemen
The real problem with this
"critical" edition is its copi

Rich's poetry is her direct,

so difficult about Rich's
poetry to require the 100-odd

well-meaning Gelpis.

Rich's directness unable to
talk to her own contem

middleman? I seriously
doubt it.
A puzi'Ung question is for
whom Celpi intended these

"the Hell's Angels" the Gel

How many Americans of

whatever reasons will not
have head of the Hell's
Angels?
And, moreover, if they have
never heard of this singular
organization, will the Gelpis'
colorless footnote do much to
convey the associations of
this gang's name?
The same criticism is
leveled at their annotation of
Milton as "an English poet"
or that a "red Triumphe
parked at the edge of the sea"
refers to "a sports car."
Do students have to be in
formed who Jonah was or
where the Bering Straits are? I
would guess not.
The Gelpis also define
none-too-difficult words
found in any dictionary like
autistic, implosion, and an
drogyne. Many of the foot
notes are either unnecessary
or unhelpful, and all of them
are obtrusive.
Norton has recently issued
Rich's Poems: Selected and
New in both hardcover and
paperback. This volume
selected by Rich herself
would serve as a much better
introduction to her work than
the Norton Critical Edition.
Only a tremendously un
confident or eager reader
would need the Gelpis' un
even volume in addition to
Rich's own selection. In fact,
if an introduction were
necessary .there could be no
better one than the Stanford

Adrienne Rich is probably
the most important woman
poet writing in America to
day. She is still at the height
of her powers, and in the next
few years she will certainly
continue to dazzle her public.
Recently Stanford has pre
sented two separate docu
ments of Rich's active career.
One is a recording, the other
an annotated volume of her
poetry. Each presentation has
much to offer, but their merits
differ.
Adrienne Rich Reading At
Stanford is a remarkably un
ique record.
Most recorded readings
tend self-consciously to rep
resent the full range of the au
thor's career. Such records
almost always become aural
versions of a "selected
poems" with representative
offerings from each stage of
their development.
While the archival value of
this approach is very high, its
deliberate nature dilutes the
excitement of the occasion.
The author usually reads
poems written 20 years be
fore, and the rendition, how
ever authentic, often reveals
distance between the poet
and the poem more than their
affinity.
Adrienne Rich Reading At
Stanford offers an exciting
contrast to the standard idea
of recorded poetry.
This recording, which was
made here live in January,
1973, vividly portrays one

moment in Rich's dynamic
career.
Almost all the poems that
she read came from one
pivotal volume, Diving Into
The Wreck, reading specifi
cally in the highly politicized
atmosphere of the early '70s.
Rich is as nearly an ac
complished reader as she is a
poet. The controlled anger of
her reading underscores the
thematic and stylistic unity of
the poems she chose into
what must be one of the most
exciting and engaging poetry
recordings ever made.
An aggressive reading
Adrienne Rich Reading At
Stanford is tantamount to an
alternate version of Diving
Into The Wreck.
While the recording is a
"live" version of the book, it
is also a more aggressive ver
sion. With the record the lis
tener cannot take the book in
at his own pace, stopping,
skipping and rereading at
will. The poet sets her own
relentless pace and the lis
tener must follow her.
The results are both excit
ing and exhausting. While
the shortcomings of the re
corded media for poetry are
obvious, anyone who doubts
that poetry can be over
whelmingly powerful at one
listening would be well
advised to listen to this re
cord.
Amidst the complacency of
bicentennial America.it is dif
ficult to recapture the inten
sity of self-evaluation that
erupted in our country even
fiva years ago.
Rich's reading recreates the
anxious self-consciousness of
the period without indulging
in the intellectual mediocrity
that often appears in such tes
timonies seen in retrospect.

In the context of her read
ing potentially histrionic
lines acquire an absolutely
sincere emotional and intel
lectual quality:
Madness. Suicide. Murder.
Is there no way out but
these?

Such lines could easily be
come cliches (a cursory look
at the work of many contem
porary American poets will
show you how often they
have become just that).
But Rich is usually able to
write poems that will support
the weight of such questions.
She choses big themes, takes
big chances and, when she
succeeds (which is surpris
ingly often), achieves propor
tionate results.
Although the Stanford re

cording has done Rich a great
service in allowing her to
speak in her own words other
factions of the university
have not been so modest.
Two Stanford faculty
members, Albert Gelpi and
Barbara Chatsworth Gelpi,

have compiled an annotated
volume of her poetry for clas
sroom use. The merits of this
venture are very ambiguous.
It strikes me as slightly
ridiculous that a poet still in
her 40s requires a Norton
"Critical" Edition of her
work.
The intentions on the part
of the publisher also seem
highly suspect since Norton
is also Rich's usual publisher.
But now that rich has
joined the ranks, at least

commercially, of Homer,
Saint Augustine and Alfred
Lord Tennyson, the resulting
volume might be profitably
examined to see what Nor
ton's unprecedented canoni
