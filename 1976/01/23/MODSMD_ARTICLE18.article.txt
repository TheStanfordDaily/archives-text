If Jane Stanford were alive to
day, she'd feel right at home. Her
beliefs in equal education and
rights for women, their right to
vote and co-education made her
somewhat of an oddity in her
time, the 1800s, but are com
pletely in time today.
She was also unusual in that
she co-founded Stanford Uni
versity with husband Leland.
And after his death, when finan
cial problems threatened to kill
the infant University, she pur
posely ignored the advice of her
lawyers to close it and almost
singlehandedly kept it alive.
Jane's story is chronicled in a
fascinating historical and per
sonal pespective in Jane Stan
ford: Her Life and Letters, by
Gunther IV. Nagel, an author and
emeritus clinical professor of
surgery at Stanford.
A remarkable woman
In his introduction, Nagel
writes that "Jane Stanford's let
ters tell of the early days of the

University while the events were
unfolding — at the same time re
veal ing the character of a re
markable woman. .
Nagel spent several years in
the University's archives re
searching the letters, which he
has supplemented with personal
comments and historical
background.
Jane Lathrop was born in New
York in 1828, the daughter of
fairly well-to-do parents. After
her marriage to Leland Stanford,
they moved to California, where
Leland became involved in vari
ous businesses and )ane led a life
of travel and social activities.
Devoted wife and mother
After 18 years of childless
marriage, Leland Jr. was born in
Sacramento in 1888. From the
first, Jane had been a devoted
wife to Leland and she became
an equally devoted mother to the
baby.
She wrote to Leland from San
Francisco in 1879: "I feel as
though I had so much to tell you
about your being so good to
me. . . I am so much occupied
with baby I am afraid I don't do
my duty to you when I do have
you with me — but my heart is

full of love running over with the
feeling I have for you. . . I would
like to be perfect that you might
think me the best of wives. Ishall
be glad when we can be together
all the time. .
Tragically, Leland Jr. died, at
age 16, of typhoid fever while
the family was vacationing in
Florence. Stanford University
was founded in his memory.
Every spare moment
"Planning the University,"
writes Nagel, "in which Jane
Stanford took an active and
equal part with her husband, oc
cupied every spare moment. . .
The object of the institution was
to qualify its students for 'direct
usefulness in life' and to ad
vance the 'cultivation and en
largement of the mind.' "
While her husband was alive,
Jane enjoyed her role as
"mother" of a university. She
would frequently entertain the
women students at their Palo
Alto home, the present site of the
Children's Hospital.
After her husband's death, fi
nancial problems beset the Uni
versity. Nagel writes that "the
chatter of the young women
about her was particularly
gratifying because it was she
who had convinced her husband
to provide for the admission of
women at the University, at a
time when most private institu
tions of higher learning were re
stricted to one sex."
Broader opportunities
Nagel writes that "The young
ladies. . . had broader oppor
tunities than had their predeces
sors. . . (Jane) got to know most
of the leaders or the growing suf
fragist movement," specifically
Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth
Cady Stanton.
At a meeting of the National
Woman Suffrage Association
Meeting in San Francisco in
1901, Jane said, "I favor the edu
cation of women, believe in
coeducation and, in fact, believe
fully in the right of women to
have the franchise. Nobody ap
preciates more than I do the ad
vantages of an education to those
of my sex. Nor does anybody
realize more than I do the effect
on society of an educated and
enlightened womanhood. A
woman can be educated and
even vote, if you please, and still
be a womanly woman."
Nagel says Jane Stanford "was

the forerunner of liberation —
she held up in a man's world." |
She also had her "idiosyn
cracies." A very serious woman,
she never smiled for portraits or
photographs. She was extremely
religious, gave generously to
charities, yet belonged to no par
ticular church; to this day her
beloved Memorial Church is >
nondenomi national. i
She wrote, "1 firmly believe all
services offered to God are ac
ceptable, for all contain the
theory of religion. . . Humanity
is God's representation of life
beyond; God is all in all, and if
we cannot appreciate and wor
ship Him in all things we only
worship part of God."
"She wasn't lovable," says
Nagel, but she was devoted to
husband and son, and "was to be
admired. She was very human —
she loved students, and called
them her'boysand girls.'She got

Nagel's previous works on

and a series of sketches of Stan

He became interested in the
story of Jane because "it hadn't
been told in complete form. The

placed her in the context of her
own day. Her beliefs in integrity,
truth and honesty are as valid
today as they were in her time —

If Jane Stanford were alive to
day, she'd feel right at home. Her
beliefs in equal education and
rights for women, their right to
vote and co-education made her
somewhat of an oddity in her
time, the 1800s, but are com
pletely in time today.
She was also unusual in that
she co-founded Stanford Uni
versity with husband Leland.
And after his death, when finan
cial problems threatened to kill
the infant University, she pur
posely ignored the advice of her
lawyers to close it and almost
singlehandedly kept it alive.
Jane's story is chronicled in a
fascinating historical and per
sonal pespective in Jane Stan
ford: Her Life and Letters, by
Gunther IV. Nagel, an author and
emeritus clinical professor of
surgery at Stanford.
A remarkable woman
In his introduction, Nagel
writes that "Jane Stanford's let
ters tell of the early days of the

University while the events were
unfolding — at the same time re
veal ing the character of a re
markable woman. .
Nagel spent several years in
the University's archives re
searching the letters, which he
has supplemented with personal
comments and historical
background.
Jane Lathrop was born in New
York in 1828, the daughter of
fairly well-to-do parents. After
her marriage to Leland Stanford,
they moved to California, where
Leland became involved in vari
ous businesses and )ane led a life
of travel and social activities.
Devoted wife and mother
After 18 years of childless
marriage, Leland Jr. was born in
Sacramento in 1888. From the
first, Jane had been a devoted
wife to Leland and she became
an equally devoted mother to the
baby.
She wrote to Leland from San
Francisco in 1879: "I feel as
though I had so much to tell you
about your being so good to
me. . . I am so much occupied
with baby I am afraid I don't do
my duty to you when I do have
you with me — but my heart is

full of love running over with the
feeling I have for you. . . I would
like to be perfect that you might
think me the best of wives. Ishall
be glad when we can be together
all the time. .
Tragically, Leland Jr. died, at
age 16, of typhoid fever while
the family was vacationing in
Florence. Stanford University
was founded in his memory.
Every spare moment
"Planning the University,"
writes Nagel, "in which Jane
Stanford took an active and
equal part with her husband, oc
cupied every spare moment. . .
The object of the institution was
to qualify its students for 'direct
usefulness in life' and to ad
vance the 'cultivation and en
largement of the mind.' "
While her husband was alive,
Jane enjoyed her role as
"mother" of a university. She
would frequently entertain the
women students at their Palo
Alto home, the present site of the
Children's Hospital.
After her husband's death, fi
nancial problems beset the Uni
versity. Nagel writes that "the
chatter of the young women
about her was particularly
gratifying because it was she
who had convinced her husband
to provide for the admission of
women at the University, at a
time when most private institu
tions of higher learning were re
stricted to one sex."
Broader opportunities
Nagel writes that "The young
ladies. . . had broader oppor
tunities than had their predeces
sors. . . (Jane) got to know most
of the leaders or the growing suf
fragist movement," specifically
Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth
Cady Stanton.
At a meeting of the National
Woman Suffrage Association
Meeting in San Francisco in
1901, Jane said, "I favor the edu
cation of women, believe in
coeducation and, in fact, believe
fully in the right of women to
have the franchise. Nobody ap
preciates more than I do the ad
vantages of an education to those
of my sex. Nor does anybody
realize more than I do the effect
on society of an educated and
enlightened womanhood. A
woman can be educated and
even vote, if you please, and still
be a womanly woman."
Nagel says Jane Stanford "was

the forerunner of liberation —
she held up in a man's world." |
She also had her "idiosyn
cracies." A very serious woman,
she never smiled for portraits or
photographs. She was extremely
religious, gave generously to
charities, yet belonged to no par
ticular church; to this day her
beloved Memorial Church is >
nondenomi national. i
She wrote, "1 firmly believe all
services offered to God are ac
ceptable, for all contain the
theory of religion. . . Humanity
is God's representation of life
beyond; God is all in all, and if
we cannot appreciate and wor
ship Him in all things we only
worship part of God."
"She wasn't lovable," says
Nagel, but she was devoted to
husband and son, and "was to be

she loved students, and called
them her'boysand girls.'She got

If Jane Stanford were alive to
day, she'd feel right at home. Her
beliefs in equal education and
rights for women, their right to
vote and co-education made her
somewhat of an oddity in her
time, the 1800s, but are com
pletely in time today.
She was also unusual in that
she co-founded Stanford Uni
versity with husband Leland.
And after his death, when finan
cial problems threatened to kill
the infant University, she pur
posely ignored the advice of her
lawyers to close it and almost
singlehandedly kept it alive.
Jane's story is chronicled in a
fascinating historical and per
sonal pespective in Jane Stan
ford: Her Life and Letters, by
Gunther IV. Nagel, an author and
emeritus clinical professor of
surgery at Stanford.
A remarkable woman
In his introduction, Nagel
writes that "Jane Stanford's let
ters tell of the early days of the

University while the events were
unfolding — at the same time re
veal ing the character of a re
markable woman. .
Nagel spent several years in
the University's archives re
searching the letters, which he
has supplemented with personal
comments and historical
background.
Jane Lathrop was born in New
York in 1828, the daughter of
fairly well-to-do parents. After
her marriage to Leland Stanford,
they moved to California, where
Leland became involved in vari
ous businesses and )ane led a life
of travel and social activities.
Devoted wife and mother
After 18 years of childless
marriage, Leland Jr. was born in
Sacramento in 1888. From the
first, Jane had been a devoted
wife to Leland and she became
an equally devoted mother to the
baby.
She wrote to Leland from San
Francisco in 1879: "I feel as
though I had so much to tell you
about your being so good to
me. . . I am so much occupied
with baby I am afraid I don't do
my duty to you when I do have
you with me — but my heart is

full of love running over with the
feeling I have for you. . . I would
like to be perfect that you might
think me the best of wives. Ishall
be glad when we can be together
all the time. .
Tragically, Leland Jr. died, at
age 16, of typhoid fever while
the family was vacationing in
Florence. Stanford University
was founded in his memory.
Every spare moment
"Planning the University,"
writes Nagel, "in which Jane
Stanford took an active and
equal part with her husband, oc
cupied every spare moment. . .
The object of the institution was
to qualify its students for 'direct
usefulness in life' and to ad
vance the 'cultivation and en
largement of the mind.' "
While her husband was alive,
Jane enjoyed her role as
"mother" of a university. She
would frequently entertain the
women students at their Palo
Alto home, the present site of the
Children's Hospital.
After her husband's death, fi
nancial problems beset the Uni
versity. Nagel writes that "the
chatter of the young women
about her was particularly
gratifying because it was she
who had convinced her husband
to provide for the admission of
women at the University, at a
time when most private institu
tions of higher learning were re
stricted to one sex."
Broader opportunities
Nagel writes that "The young
ladies. . . had broader oppor
tunities than had their predeces
sors. . . (Jane) got to know most
of the leaders or the growing suf
fragist movement," specifically
Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth
Cady Stanton.
At a meeting of the National
Woman Suffrage Association
Meeting in San Francisco in
1901, Jane said, "I favor the edu
cation of women, believe in
coeducation and, in fact, believe
fully in the right of women to
have the franchise. Nobody ap
preciates more than I do the ad
vantages of an education to those
of my sex. Nor does anybody
realize more than I do the effect
on society of an educated and
enlightened womanhood. A
woman can be educated and
even vote, if you please, and still
be a womanly woman."
Nagel says Jane Stanford "was

the forerunner of liberation —
she held up in a man's world." |
She also had her "idiosyn
cracies." A very serious woman,
she never smiled for portraits or
photographs. She was extremely
religious, gave generously to
charities, yet belonged to no par
ticular church; to this day her
beloved Memorial Church is >
nondenomi national. i
She wrote, "1 firmly believe all
services offered to God are ac
ceptable, for all contain the
theory of religion. . . Humanity
is God's representation of life
beyond; God is all in all, and if
we cannot appreciate and wor
ship Him in all things we only
worship part of God."
"She wasn't lovable," says
Nagel, but she was devoted to
husband and son, and "was to be
admired. She was very human —
she loved students, and called
them her'boysand girls.'She got
pleasure from students more
than other things."
Previous works
Nagel's previous works on
Stanford history have included
stories for theAlumni Almanac
and a series of sketches of Stan
ford professors.
He became interested in the
story of Jane because "it hadn't
been told in complete form. The
present interest in women
placed her in the context of her
own day. Her beliefs in integrity,
truth and honesty are as valid
today as they were in her time —
she set an example."
Nagel "read up on the wo
men's movement in the U.S. as
research," he says, which has re
sulted in an invaluable and
completely readable history of
personality and her time
through a unique "dual" author
ship.
