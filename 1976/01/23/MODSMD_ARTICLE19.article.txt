Reviewed by George Powell
Twelve years after the climac
tic event, only 15 percent of the
people believe the official report
about what happened. The event
is, of course, the assassination of
President John Kennedy on Nov.
22, 1963 and the report is now
almost completely discredited
work of the Warren Commission.
That report, if the latest CBS
news polls are to be believed, has
a lower rating than Richard
Nixon did at the nadir of his
presidency.
With the shocks and buffets of
seamy antics by high officials in
top government organizations
providing a daily, unseemly
counterpoint to current events,
it's no wonder that the Warren
Commission report has lost al
most all of its credibility.
On wings
So, buoyed on the wings of
Watergate-related revelations
and stories of CIA domestic spy
ing and foreign assassination
plots, interest in the seminal
event of the 1960s have revived,
along with calls for the reopen
ing of the investigation of the
crime.
They've Killed the President,
by Robert Sam Anson makes fas
cinating reading, as wll as serv
ing as a valuable reference tool.
Anson and his researchers
have pored over the existing
assassination literature, as well
as many books on the Kennedys,
the Mafia and FBI, the CIA and
Cuba.
What has been produced is a
distillation of all the theories
and allegations; the unresolved
gaps in the facts according to the
Warren Commission; some
speculation as to why certain
facts were left out and what
should be done to reopen the in
vestigation.
Naive America
For those who were too young
to be affected by the death of
John Kennedy, the book is an ex
cellent overview of the entire
event.
And for those who can re
member all too well where they
were and what they were doing
on that fateful day, the book ef
fectively describes a more native
America, one that rushed just as
headlong to accept the Warren
Commission's verdict as the
Commission pushed to render it.
It seemed preposterous in
1964 that seven men of the pub
lic stature of those appointed by
Lyndon Johnson would fail to
get at the true facts of the case.
But the then Chief Justice of

the Supreme Court. Earl Warren,
had been given instructions by
President Johnson that the major
task of the Commission would be
to lay to rest the conspiracy
rumors that had, of course, crop
ped up, which also would be a
handy thing to accomplish be
fore the 1964 presidential elec
tion.
This does not mean that
Anson ascribes venal motives to
the former President, but that
almost all high officials in public
life ascribed to the theory that it
was in the "national interest" to
throw oil on troubled waters,
rather than exhaustively probing
their depths.
Now, 12 years have elapsed
and venality among public offi
cials is regarded as "something
they all do," by many Ameri
cans. So the idea that the CIA
and FBI withheld evidence from
the Warren Commission and ac
tually destroyed some docu
ments is almost as respectable as
leisure suits.
Conspiracy theorists
Even the worst possible con
clusion. that the FBI, CIA and/or
some other intelligence agency
may have taken part in the mur
der, is not the sole province of
deranged conspiracy theorists.
Anson had the Herculen task
of taking this mass of written
material — millions of words —
and constructing a reasonable
speculation of what could have
happened from it.
That he succeeded in less time
than it took the Warren Commis
sion to make their report means

that he had to have had a lot of
dedicated help, and that much
ground had already been co
vered by previous assassination
theorists and buffs.
Although CBS recently went
to great lengths to prove that the
physical evidence justified the
lone assassin theory, the book
pretty well demolishes this con
clusion.
lust two examples of what CBS
never mentioned in their special
report: 1) the rifle that Oswald
allegedly used to shoot Kennedy
had its telescopic sight so badly
mounted that it had to be
realigned before the FBI could
test fire it; 2) Oswald was never
found in possession of any am
munition of the type used in his
rifle.
Bits and pieces
In fact, only four rounds were
found with the gun, one in the
chamber and three shell casings
on the floor.
Taken alone, these bits and
pieces don't seem like much. But
since the Warren Commission
chose to ignore or not pursue so
many of these little bits that con
flicted with the lone assassin
theory, the need to answer the
parts left out of the official report
become imperative.
Only if these questions can
begin to be answered will
America begin to truly recover
from the low blow suffered in
Dallas that day. Anson's book is
a commendable start at
straightening things out.

Twelve years after the climac

almost completely discredited
work of the Warren Commission.
That report, if the latest CBS
news polls are to be believed, has
a lower rating than Richard
Nixon did at the nadir of his

With the shocks and buffets of

crime.
They've Killed the President,
by Robert Sam Anson makes fas

Anson and his researchers
have pored over the existing
assassination literature, as well
as many books on the Kennedys,
the Mafia and FBI, the CIA and
Cuba.
What has been produced is a
distillation of all the theories
and allegations; the unresolved
gaps in the facts according to the
Warren Commission; some
speculation as to why certain
facts were left out and what
should be done to reopen the in

Naive America
For those who were too young
to be affected by the death of
John Kennedy, the book is an ex
cellent overview of the entire
event.
And for those who can re
member all too well where they
were and what they were doing
on that fateful day, the book ef
fectively describes a more native
America, one that rushed just as
headlong to accept the Warren
Commission's verdict as the
Commission pushed to render it.
It seemed preposterous in
1964 that seven men of the pub
lic stature of those appointed by
Lyndon Johnson would fail to
get at the true facts of the case.
But the then Chief Justice of

the Supreme Court. Earl Warren,
had been given instructions by
President Johnson that the major
task of the Commission would be
to lay to rest the conspiracy
rumors that had, of course, crop
ped up, which also would be a
handy thing to accomplish be
fore the 1964 presidential elec
tion.
This does not mean that
Anson ascribes venal motives to
the former President, but that
almost all high officials in public
life ascribed to the theory that it
was in the "national interest" to
throw oil on troubled waters,
rather than exhaustively probing
their depths.
Now, 12 years have elapsed
and venality among public offi
cials is regarded as "something
they all do," by many Ameri
cans. So the idea that the CIA
and FBI withheld evidence from
the Warren Commission and ac
tually destroyed some docu
ments is almost as respectable as
leisure suits.
Conspiracy theorists
Even the worst possible con
clusion. that the FBI, CIA and/or
some other intelligence agency
may have taken part in the mur
der, is not the sole province of
deranged conspiracy theorists.
Anson had the Herculen task
of taking this mass of written
material — millions of words —
and constructing a reasonable
speculation of what could have
happened from it.
That he succeeded in less time
than it took the Warren Commis
sion to make their report means

that he had to have had a lot of
dedicated help, and that much
ground had already been co
vered by previous assassination
theorists and buffs.
Although CBS recently went
to great lengths to prove that the
physical evidence justified the
lone assassin theory, the book
pretty well demolishes this con
clusion.
lust two examples of what CBS
never mentioned in their special
report: 1) the rifle that Oswald
allegedly used to shoot Kennedy
had its telescopic sight so badly
mounted that it had to be
realigned before the FBI could
test fire it; 2) Oswald was never
found in possession of any am
munition of the type used in his
rifle.

Twelve years after the climac
tic event, only 15 percent of the
people believe the official report
about what happened. The event
is, of course, the assassination of
President John Kennedy on Nov.
22, 1963 and the report is now
almost completely discredited
work of the Warren Commission.
That report, if the latest CBS
news polls are to be believed, has
a lower rating than Richard
Nixon did at the nadir of his
presidency.
With the shocks and buffets of
seamy antics by high officials in
top government organizations
providing a daily, unseemly
counterpoint to current events,
it's no wonder that the Warren
Commission report has lost al
most all of its credibility.
On wings
So, buoyed on the wings of
Watergate-related revelations
and stories of CIA domestic spy
ing and foreign assassination
plots, interest in the seminal
event of the 1960s have revived,
along with calls for the reopen
ing of the investigation of the
crime.
They've Killed the President,
by Robert Sam Anson makes fas
cinating reading, as wll as serv
ing as a valuable reference tool.
Anson and his researchers
have pored over the existing
assassination literature, as well
as many books on the Kennedys,
the Mafia and FBI, the CIA and
Cuba.
What has been produced is a
distillation of all the theories
and allegations; the unresolved
gaps in the facts according to the
Warren Commission; some
speculation as to why certain
facts were left out and what
should be done to reopen the in
vestigation.
Naive America
For those who were too young
to be affected by the death of
John Kennedy, the book is an ex
cellent overview of the entire
event.
And for those who can re
member all too well where they
were and what they were doing
on that fateful day, the book ef
fectively describes a more native
America, one that rushed just as
headlong to accept the Warren
Commission's verdict as the
Commission pushed to render it.
It seemed preposterous in
1964 that seven men of the pub
lic stature of those appointed by
Lyndon Johnson would fail to
get at the true facts of the case.
But the then Chief Justice of

the Supreme Court. Earl Warren,
had been given instructions by
President Johnson that the major
task of the Commission would be
to lay to rest the conspiracy
rumors that had, of course, crop
ped up, which also would be a
handy thing to accomplish be
fore the 1964 presidential elec
tion.
This does not mean that
Anson ascribes venal motives to
the former President, but that
almost all high officials in public
life ascribed to the theory that it
was in the "national interest" to
throw oil on troubled waters,
rather than exhaustively probing
their depths.
Now, 12 years have elapsed
and venality among public offi
cials is regarded as "something
they all do," by many Ameri
cans. So the idea that the CIA
and FBI withheld evidence from
the Warren Commission and ac
tually destroyed some docu
ments is almost as respectable as
leisure suits.
Conspiracy theorists
Even the worst possible con
clusion. that the FBI, CIA and/or
some other intelligence agency
may have taken part in the mur
der, is not the sole province of
deranged conspiracy theorists.
Anson had the Herculen task
of taking this mass of written
material — millions of words —
and constructing a reasonable
speculation of what could have
happened from it.
That he succeeded in less time
than it took the Warren Commis
sion to make their report means

that he had to have had a lot of
dedicated help, and that much
ground had already been co
vered by previous assassination
theorists and buffs.
Although CBS recently went
to great lengths to prove that the
physical evidence justified the
lone assassin theory, the book
pretty well demolishes this con
clusion.
