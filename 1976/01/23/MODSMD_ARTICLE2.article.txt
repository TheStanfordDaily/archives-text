# 'Back in the soup again'?
## Miller airs budget concerns 
### GEORGE ANDERS 
If future efforts to reduce the Univer
sity's deficit are not sufficient, the
University may be "back in the soup
again," Provost William Miller told
the Faculty Senate yesterday.
Miller and Vice Provost for Research
William Massy presented a report to
the senate on the accomplishments
and goals of the Budget Equilibrium
Program. The program was set up in
1974 to decrease the University's de
ficit which was then at about $10 mill
ion.
Solving the University's budget dif
ficulties will require raising the long
run rate of revenue growth while slow
ing the rise in expenses. Miller said.
Looking ahead, Massy said tuition is

projected to rise 4.1 percent plus the
inflation rate until 1980. Universities
salaries should increase at the same
rate as consumer prices, he said.
New expenditures are expected to
rise one percent, he added, noting that
maintenance costs for new buildings
have not been taken into account.
Massy said that after 1980, salaries
and new expenditures are expected to
rise slightly more.
He said these projections could
change either way, however, if tax
laws on charitable donations change
or if rules for federal reimbursement
for research project overheads change.
Another round of double digit infla
tion coupled with a drop in the stock
market could also effect the projec

tions, he added.
Later, the senate sent back to com
mittee a report urging that University
fellowships be awarded primarily ac
cording to financial need. The current
method stresses the ability of the
applicant.
The Committee on Graduate Studies
had suggested that maximum stipends
on the fellowships, given to graduate
students in the humanities and social
sciences, be raised. To keep costs con
stant,students with sufficient parental
and personal financial resources
would receive less money,the commit
tee's proposal said.
Twenty-three department chairmen
signed a statement asking that the ac
tual allocation of fellowship funds be
left up to the departments.
A motion by Religious Studies Prof.
William Clebsch that the committee
re-examine fellowships was passed
by a voice vote. Clebsch's motion
asked that the committee "present op
tional plans (for administering fellow
ships) which would be responsive to
departments' needs."
Senators expressed various objec
tions to the committee's report.
George Mosle, program planner at
SLAC, said the proposal would "re
strict graduate admission to those of
very moderate income and the very
wealthy."
History Prof. Carl Degler questioned
whether parental income should be
included in determination of students'
need.
Physics Prof. Walter Meyerhof said
the committee's suggestions "impose'
a uniformity that's not good for all de
partments."
Graduate Division Dean W. Bliss
Girnochan said, however, "We're not
wedded to one system. Different de
partments have different needs, and
this should be taken into account."
The senate also adopted a resolution
calling for the systematic review every
five years of undergraduate degree
programs not in the University's regu
lar departments.
