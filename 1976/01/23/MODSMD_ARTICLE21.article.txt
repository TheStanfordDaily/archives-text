# 100,000 addicts offered treatment in S. Vietnam
## 
### LINDA HEIBERT 
SAICON, Jan. 8 (Pacific News
Service) — A mixed dose of poli
tics, job training and the age-old
Oriental art of acupuncture is
helping South Vietnam cope
with one of the stark legacies of
the war — 100,000 drug addicts.
Rather than punishing addicts
with jail terms, the government
has opened an experimental
drug treatment center here. With
80 patients ranging in age from
18 to 35, the center first tries to
break drug dependency, then to
train patients in skills they can
use to support their families.
The first phase combines
drugs, new diets and
acupuncture with group sing
ing, movies and cultural shows.
Both patients and staff partici
pate.
The addicts receive limited
amounts of morphine and Sec
onal to help them through their
"cold turkey" crisis. The center
also uses strict diets for indi
vidual problems of kidney and
liver disease. One of the doctors
has found that certain foods are
helpful in the overall treatment
of addiction.
Most significant and innova
tive, however, is the use of
acupuncture to relieve the ad
dict's back pain and anxiety dur
ing the withdrawal crisis. Dr.
Son, an acupuncture specialist
and officer with the former
Saigon army in Fleiku, was
asked to bring his unique skill to
the center after taking a reeduca
tion course in the highlands.
Forbidden by the previous
government to publish an article
on the use of acupuncture to
treat drug addiction, Son and
several other doctors have re
cently published a book on their
findings.
Phung, an addict for 31 years,
could not sleep before Son
began the acupuncture therapy.
Now, one month later, he can
sleep well.
For Xuan, a long-time addict,
the treatment to stop the pain
and cold of withdrawal used to
take two days. Now with
acupuncture it takes only 45
seconds.
Pham Thanh Long used his
drug addiction to win a defer
ment from the army under the
old government. He was regu
larly brought before the Drug De
ferment Council, sentenced to
one month in prison and then
released with a military defer
ment for several months.
"At first working as a nurse it
was easy to get drugs," Long
says. "But when I lost my job, my
wife was forced to support my
habit, which cost us 1000 pias
ters ($1.50) every day."
Long wanted to give up his
habit. He had already lost one
arm from an infection caused by

a dirty needle. "But each time I
felt I could do it, my draft defer
ment ran out and I had to go back
on drugs."
At first his wife objected
strongly to his use of drugs.
Eventually, as she saw many of
their friends and relatives killed
01 wounded in the army, she felt
there was no choice. Either Long
would be an addict or he would
be drafted.
Long was more fortunate than
some of his addict friends, who
were drafted and sent to the front
without guns as coolies for offic
ers of the former Saigon army.
When the government in
South Vietnam changed in Ap
ril, Long and his addict friends
were fearful. They knew their
supply of drugs would eventu
ally be cut, but they had no idea
what the new government
would do to them. It was ru
mored they would be put in
prison to cure them of their
habits. Long waited, hiding in
his house.
A few months later a neighbor
who was on the local administra
tive Council for Social Welfare
and Veterans' Affairs visited
Long to talk about his drug prob
lem. The neighbor told him
about the new center to open in
Saigon.
At first Long was reluctant,
but after a month of treatment he
is one of 80 enthusiastic pa
tients. In one and a-half months
Long will finish his initial drug
treatment and will enter the
training phase.
After leaving the center, Long
has several options. He can re
turn home to his wife and five
children, where his local Social
Welfare Council will help him
find a job. Or he can take his fam
ily to a new economic area to
farm.
The new government has in
itiated a program to help people
return to the countryside by pro
viding land, agricultural tools,
some household supplies and
rice for six months.
The center also offers patients
the option of staying to work on
500,000 acres of land which it
hopes to develop into a coopera
tive farm. But the center dies not
yet have funds for seeds, agricul

tural tools or tractors to help re
settle the rehabilitated addicts.
Regardless of their choice,
Long and other patients will be
watched and guided by the
center for some time to ensure
their habits are cured.
If this experimental center is
successful, it will be expanded
to treat the rest of the 100,000
male, female and child addicts
in South Vietnam.
The four young doctors and 15
nurses at the center seem deter
mined to tackle this tragic by
product of the Indochina war.
But they see their role as only
one part of combating this social
problem. "We must and we will
stop the drug traffic to complete
the cure of drug addiction in our
country," Son says.

to treat the rest of the 100,000
male, female and child addicts
in South Vietnam.
The four young doctors and 15
nurses at the center seem deter
mined to tackle this tragic by
product of the Indochina war.
But they see their role as only
one part of combating this social
problem. "We must and we will

SAICON, Jan. 8 (Pacific News
Service) — A mixed dose of poli
tics, job training and the age-old
Oriental art of acupuncture is
helping South Vietnam cope
with one of the stark legacies of
the war — 100,000 drug addicts.
Rather than punishing addicts
with jail terms, the government
has opened an experimental
drug treatment center here. With
80 patients ranging in age from
18 to 35, the center first tries to
break drug dependency, then to
train patients in skills they can
use to support their families.
The first phase combines
drugs, new diets and
acupuncture with group sing
ing, movies and cultural shows.
Both patients and staff partici
pate.
The addicts receive limited
amounts of morphine and Sec
onal to help them through their
"cold turkey" crisis. The center
also uses strict diets for indi
vidual problems of kidney and
liver disease. One of the doctors
has found that certain foods are
helpful in the overall treatment
of addiction.
Most significant and innova
tive, however, is the use of
acupuncture to relieve the ad
dict's back pain and anxiety dur
ing the withdrawal crisis. Dr.
Son, an acupuncture specialist
and officer with the former
Saigon army in Fleiku, was
asked to bring his unique skill to
the center after taking a reeduca
tion course in the highlands.
Forbidden by the previous
government to publish an article
on the use of acupuncture to
treat drug addiction, Son and
several other doctors have re
cently published a book on their
findings.
Phung, an addict for 31 years,
could not sleep before Son
began the acupuncture therapy.
Now, one month later, he can
sleep well.
For Xuan, a long-time addict,
the treatment to stop the pain
and cold of withdrawal used to
take two days. Now with
acupuncture it takes only 45
seconds.
Pham Thanh Long used his
drug addiction to win a defer
ment from the army under the
old government. He was regu
larly brought before the Drug De
ferment Council, sentenced to
one month in prison and then
released with a military defer
ment for several months.
"At first working as a nurse it
was easy to get drugs," Long
says. "But when I lost my job, my
wife was forced to support my
habit, which cost us 1000 pias
ters ($1.50) every day."
Long wanted to give up his
habit. He had already lost one
arm from an infection caused by

a dirty needle. "But each time I
felt I could do it, my draft defer
ment ran out and I had to go back
on drugs."
At first his wife objected
strongly to his use of drugs.
Eventually, as she saw many of
their friends and relatives killed
01 wounded in the army, she felt
there was no choice. Either Long
would be an addict or he would
be drafted.
Long was more fortunate than
some of his addict friends, who
were drafted and sent to the front
without guns as coolies for offic
ers of the former Saigon army.
When the government in
South Vietnam changed in Ap
ril, Long and his addict friends
were fearful. They knew their
supply of drugs would eventu
ally be cut, but they had no idea
what the new government
would do to them. It was ru
mored they would be put in
prison to cure them of their
habits. Long waited, hiding in
his house.
A few months later a neighbor
who was on the local administra
tive Council for Social Welfare
and Veterans' Affairs visited
Long to talk about his drug prob
lem. The neighbor told him
about the new center to open in
Saigon.
At first Long was reluctant,
but after a month of treatment he
is one of 80 enthusiastic pa
tients. In one and a-half months
Long will finish his initial drug
treatment and will enter the
training phase.
After leaving the center, Long
has several options. He can re
turn home to his wife and five
children, where his local Social
Welfare Council will help him
find a job. Or he can take his fam
ily to a new economic area to
farm.
The new government has in
itiated a program to help people
return to the countryside by pro
viding land, agricultural tools,
some household supplies and
rice for six months.
The center also offers patients
the option of staying to work on
500,000 acres of land which it
hopes to develop into a coopera
tive farm. But the center dies not
yet have funds for seeds, agricul

tural tools or tractors to help re
settle the rehabilitated addicts.
Regardless of their choice,
Long and other patients will be
watched and guided by the
center for some time to ensure
their habits are cured.

tive farm. But the center dies not
yet have funds for seeds, agricul

tural tools or tractors to help re
settle the rehabilitated addicts.
Regardless of their choice,
Long and other patients will be
watched and guided by the
center for some time to ensure
their habits are cured.
If this experimental center is
successful, it will be expanded
to treat the rest of the 100,000
male, female and child addicts
in South Vietnam.
The four young doctors and 15
nurses at the center seem deter
mined to tackle this tragic by
product of the Indochina war.
But they see their role as only
one part of combating this social
problem. "We must and we will
stop the drug traffic to complete
the cure of drug addiction in our
country," Son says.
SAICON, Jan. 8 (Pacific News
Service) — A mixed dose of poli
tics, job training and the age-old
Oriental art of acupuncture is
helping South Vietnam cope
with one of the stark legacies of
the war — 100,000 drug addicts.
Rather than punishing addicts
with jail terms, the government
has opened an experimental
drug treatment center here. With
80 patients ranging in age from
18 to 35, the center first tries to
break drug dependency, then to
train patients in skills they can
use to support their families.
The first phase combines
drugs, new diets and
acupuncture with group sing
ing, movies and cultural shows.
Both patients and staff partici
pate.
The addicts receive limited
amounts of morphine and Sec
onal to help them through their
"cold turkey" crisis. The center
also uses strict diets for indi
vidual problems of kidney and
liver disease. One of the doctors
has found that certain foods are
helpful in the overall treatment
of addiction.
Most significant and innova
tive, however, is the use of
acupuncture to relieve the ad
dict's back pain and anxiety dur
ing the withdrawal crisis. Dr.
Son, an acupuncture specialist
and officer with the former
Saigon army in Fleiku, was
asked to bring his unique skill to
the center after taking a reeduca
tion course in the highlands.
Forbidden by the previous
government to publish an article
on the use of acupuncture to
treat drug addiction, Son and
several other doctors have re
cently published a book on their
findings.
Phung, an addict for 31 years,
could not sleep before Son
began the acupuncture therapy.
Now, one month later, he can
sleep well.
For Xuan, a long-time addict,
the treatment to stop the pain
and cold of withdrawal used to
take two days. Now with
acupuncture it takes only 45
seconds.
Pham Thanh Long used his
drug addiction to win a defer
ment from the army under the
old government. He was regu
larly brought before the Drug De
ferment Council, sentenced to
one month in prison and then
released with a military defer
ment for several months.
"At first working as a nurse it
was easy to get drugs," Long
says. "But when I lost my job, my
wife was forced to support my
habit, which cost us 1000 pias
ters ($1.50) every day."
Long wanted to give up his
habit. He had already lost one
arm from an infection caused by

a dirty needle. "But each time I
felt I could do it, my draft defer
ment ran out and I had to go back
on drugs."
At first his wife objected
strongly to his use of drugs.
Eventually, as she saw many of
their friends and relatives killed
01 wounded in the army, she felt
there was no choice. Either Long
would be an addict or he would
be drafted.
Long was more fortunate than
some of his addict friends, who
were drafted and sent to the front
without guns as coolies for offic
ers of the former Saigon army.
When the government in
South Vietnam changed in Ap
ril, Long and his addict friends
were fearful. They knew their
supply of drugs would eventu
ally be cut, but they had no idea
what the new government
would do to them. It was ru
mored they would be put in
prison to cure them of their
habits. Long waited, hiding in
his house.
A few months later a neighbor
who was on the local administra
tive Council for Social Welfare
and Veterans' Affairs visited
Long to talk about his drug prob
lem. The neighbor told him
about the new center to open in
Saigon.
At first Long was reluctant,
but after a month of treatment he
is one of 80 enthusiastic pa
tients. In one and a-half months
Long will finish his initial drug
treatment and will enter the
training phase.
After leaving the center, Long
has several options. He can re
turn home to his wife and five
children, where his local Social
Welfare Council will help him
find a job. Or he can take his fam
ily to a new economic area to
farm.
The new government has in
itiated a program to help people
return to the countryside by pro
viding land, agricultural tools,
some household supplies and
rice for six months.
The center also offers patients
the option of staying to work on
500,000 acres of land which it
hopes to develop into a coopera
tive farm. But the center dies not
yet have funds for seeds, agricul

tural tools or tractors to help re
settle the rehabilitated addicts.
