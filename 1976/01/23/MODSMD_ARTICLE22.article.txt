# Test identifies women endangered by 'Pill'
##

TUCSON (AP) — A simple
blood test now appears possible
that would identify women who
may develop dangerous blood
clots while taking the contracep
tive "pill" a research scientist
said Wednesday.
For women thus identified,
the drug heparin — a so-called
blood-thinning agent — could
then be used for protection
against clots that may form dur
ing surgery or after injury.
The test might also relieve the
worry of millions of women by
showing that they are not in par
ticular danger of forming clots
when taking the oral contracep
tive containing estrogen, the
female sex hormone.
About 12 million American
women take such pills and ex
perts say relatively few risk for
mation of clots because of it.
The first steps toward such a
potential test were described to
an American Heart Association
science writers' forum by Dr.
Stanford Wessler of New York
University School of Medicine.
The blood test would identify
women in whom the estrogen
pill interfered with defense
mechanisms against formation
of blood clots.
How blood clots form is an in

tricate process, involving many
elements in the blood. One of
those elements or factors is
antithrombin-3, which inhibits
the action of factor Xa, a key in
the final formation of clots.
The test would show whether
estrogen affects the reaction time
to bring greater chance that fac
tor Xa could induce clots in the
lets, heart and brain.
Only a very small percentage
of women taking the pill ever get
into trouble with blood clots, Dr.
Wessler said. Their tendency to
form clots is increased if they
undergo surgery or suffer injury.
Small doses of heparin en
hance the ability of
antithrombin-3 to neutralize fac
tor Xa. It thus can be given before
surgery or might be given in the
event of accidental injury.
Wessler stressed that other
laboratories would have to con
firm the findings before the
blood test or treatment with
heparin would be accepted.
