# Gandhi's son rises in power

### MICHAEL CHINOY 
NEW DELHI, Jan. 15 (Pacific
News Service) — Barely a half
year after his mother declared a
state of emergency and assumed
dictatorial powers, the 29-year
old son of Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi has become the second
most powerful figure in India.
And in recent weeks, young
Sanjay Gandhi has made a major
effort to increase his influence
by adopting for the first time an
active public posture and by in
serting his loyal political allies
into key government positions.
Until this fall Sanjay had op
erated behind the scenes, taking
part in the daily meetings of Mrs.
Gandhi's emergency council
and generally acting as her chief
confidante and adviser.

But starting in late November,
his name began to appear regu
larly in India's controlled press,
and in the past month he has
been frequently extolled in the
newspapers as a wise and
dynamic leader of the future.
Sanjay's developing public
presence appears to have been
carefully orchestrated. The first
news stories about him were
simply reports of his assorted
speeches, appearances and ac
tivities. Then, in mid-December,
with considerable fanfare, he
was made a leader of the youth
wing of the ruling Congress
Party, and was lauded in print by
several national figures as a ris
ing star on the Indian scene.
And at the Congress Party's
national convention held in
early January, the papers re
ported that Sanjay received
nearly as warm a reception as
Mrs. Gandhi herself. The pre
stigious Times of India noted on
several occasions that "huge
crowds" greeted Sanjay with sh
outs of "Sanjay Gandhi zin
dabed" ("Long live Sanjay
Gandhi!") — an acclamation
previously reserved only for his
mother. One political figure was
prominently quoted as saying,
"Mr. Gandhi's entry into public
life will pave the way for the
progress of the country."
At the same time, Sanjay also
helped install two of his closest
supporters as minister of de
fense and chairman of India's
largest newspaper.
The new defense minister,
Bansi Lai, was instrumental in
helping Sanjay set up a controv
ersial automobile plant near
Delhi four hears ago to produce a
car called the Maruti, which San
jay himself designed.
As chief minister of Haryana
state, where the plant was lo
cated, the 48-year-old Bansi Lai
was responsible for the razing of
six villages and the forced re
moval of their inhabitants in
order to acquire the 297 acres of
choice farmland for the factory
site. Apart from the brutality
with which the local peasants
were evicted, accusations of
scandal were raised when-, after
four years, not a single Maruti
had rolled off the assembly line.

The new defense minister,
Bansi Lai, was instrumental in

ersial automobile plant near
Delhi four hears ago to produce a
car called the Maruti, which San

As chief minister of Haryana
state, where the plant was lo
cated, the 48-year-old Bansi Lai
was responsible for the razing of
six villages and the forced re
moval of their inhabitants in

site. Apart from the brutality
with which the local peasants
were evicted, accusations of
scandal were raised when-, after
four years, not a single Maruti
had rolled off the assembly line.
NEW DELHI, Jan. 15 (Pacific
News Service) — Barely a half
year after his mother declared a
state of emergency and assumed
dictatorial powers, the 29-year
old son of Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi has become the second
most powerful figure in India.
And in recent weeks, young
Sanjay Gandhi has made a major
effort to increase his influence
by adopting for the first time an
active public posture and by in
serting his loyal political allies
into key government positions.
Until this fall Sanjay had op
erated behind the scenes, taking
part in the daily meetings of Mrs.
Gandhi's emergency council
and generally acting as her chief
confidante and adviser.

But starting in late November,
his name began to appear regu
larly in India's controlled press,
and in the past month he has
been frequently extolled in the
newspapers as a wise and
dynamic leader of the future.
Sanjay's developing public
presence appears to have been
carefully orchestrated. The first
news stories about him were
simply reports of his assorted
speeches, appearances and ac
tivities. Then, in mid-December,
with considerable fanfare, he
was made a leader of the youth
wing of the ruling Congress
Party, and was lauded in print by
several national figures as a ris
ing star on the Indian scene.
And at the Congress Party's
national convention held in
early January, the papers re
ported that Sanjay received
nearly as warm a reception as
Mrs. Gandhi herself. The pre
stigious Times of India noted on
several occasions that "huge
crowds" greeted Sanjay with sh
outs of "Sanjay Gandhi zin
dabed" ("Long live Sanjay
Gandhi!") — an acclamation
previously reserved only for his
mother. One political figure was
prominently quoted as saying,
"Mr. Gandhi's entry into public
life will pave the way for the
progress of the country."
