# Davis coach goes wild
## Cards tune up for Cal game 
### CHRIS BAKER 
UC-Davis coach Bob Hamilton
attracted more attention than his
team did Wednesday night in
Maples Pavilion. After each
Aggie miscue, of which there
were plenty in Stanford's 91-76
win, he either hurled a towel
into the stands or stormed down
the sideline to the other end of
his bench.
Hamilton made the intense
demeanor of Stanford coach
Dick Dißiaso seem almost staid
in comparison. After the Cards
opened the game by jumping to a
10-2 lead with just 3:41 gone, the
Aggie mentor jumped from his
chair to call a time out. Hamilton
hurled his coat onto the floor and
loosened his shirt, almost chok
ing himself with his tie. He then
proceeded to tongue-lash his
squad.
It didn't do much good. Stan
ford held a 21-6 lead midway
through the half and the closest
Davis came during the remain
der of the contest was nine
points.
'Far from casual'
"This was far from a casual
win," said Dißiaso. "When we
scheduled Davis, we knew that
we would be in for a tough ball
game."The Aggies played with

out the services of junior guard
Mark Ford, their third leading
scorer, who is out with the flu.
Maybe this non-conference
game couldn't have come to a
better time for Stanford. Guard
Jay Carter, who contributed 14
points in Stanford's 86-75 win
over USC in Los Angeles last
weekend, is doubtful for tomor
row's 3 p.m. contest with
California in Maples Pavilion.
Carter, who wasn't in uniform
Wednesday night, has been
sidelined with tendonitis and
hasn't practiced all week.
Forward George Schader, who
was named Pacific Eight Player
of the Week for his 41 point and
31 rebound effort against UCLA
and USC last weekend, missed
practice Monday with a bruised
knee. Schader sat out much of
the first half against Davis with
three fouls and finished with a
total of just four points and five
rebounds.
Starters Ed Schweitzer and
Mike Bratz turned in fine per
formances (22 and 20 points re
spectively), but the Cards found
that they also have the men to
replace Carter and Schader if
needed.
Dißiaso used freshman guard
Paul Giovacchini to replace Car

ter in spelling starting guards
Mike Bratz and Wolfe Perry.
Giovacchini, last year's prep
Most Valuable Player in Utah,
hit four of six from the floor and
three of four from the line for a
season-high 11 points.
Lot of action
"Giovacchini will see a lot of
action," said Dißiaso. "I think
this game brought back a lot of
his confidence."
Jeff McHugh, who contributed
nine points against USC in 24
minutes of action, replaced
Schader at forward. McHugh
also replaced him on the boards,
pulling down a season-high 11
rebounds against Davis, a squad
which had out-rebounded Cal in
a 72-62 loss.
"This is twice that Jeff's come
off the bench and done a fine job
rebounding," said Dißiaso. "He
has a good shot — it's from play
ing 'horse.' "
The Gards, who led by as
much as 15 during the first half,
held a 45-35 lead over the Aggies
at halftime. Some members of
the press thought it should have
been larger, especially when
they saw that Stanford had a
30-12 rebounding edge over
Davis at the half.
'Superb basketball'
"Davis played superb basket
ball," said Dißiaso. "When you
take the 12 turnovers we com
mitted into account, we only
have 18 rebounds," he added.
"That brings them up."
The Aggies came as close as
nine points, at 73-65 with 5:23
left in the game, before Dißiaso
called a time out. He should re
member what he said and use it
tomorrow, when the Bears in
vade Maples. Stanford scored 10
unanswered points to take an
83-65 lead and that was the ball
game.
"It's nice to put three good
games together," said Dißiaso.
"I think we're ready for Cal and
this game added to our prepara
tion.
Over on the other side of
Maples, Hamilton had cooled
down after the loss. "Dick's ball
club played real well. They shot
a lot better from the outside than

our scouting report indicated,"
said Hamilton.
Then Hamilton compared
Stanford to Cal. "Stanford shoots
a lot better from the outside than
Cal does," said Hamilton. "Stan
ford shot the shit out of us to
night."
Cal Coach Dick Edwards has
the same mix of good "street"
ball players and speed that he's
had for the past couple of years
across the Bay. Senior guard
Rickie Hawthorne collected 22

points against the Trojans, fol
lowed by forward Carl Bird's 21.
The Bears have one new face
who is very familiar with the
Cards' Perry.
Flashy guard Gene Ransom, a
5-9 freshman from Berkeley, is
the Bears' third leading scorer
with a 11.9 average. Ransom and
Perry played together on a
couple of high school all-star
teams. Ransom hit 12 points in
the second half against UCLA to
keep Cal close in the 80-71 loss.
"Cal is a very diciplined
club," said Hamilton. "They
work the ball around a lot. They
aren't racehorses."
