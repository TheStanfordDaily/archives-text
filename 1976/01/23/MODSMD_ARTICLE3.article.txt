# Panel rejects plan to assign frat members by computer
## 
### STEPHEN CROLIUS 
The Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
rejected a proposed computerized bid
system for this spring's fraternity rush
at yesterday's meeting.
By a 9-3 vote, with one
abstention, the IFC rejected a plan that
would use a computer to facilitate the
matching of houses and rushees in this
spring's rush. The plan previously had
been approved unanimously by the
IFC's rush committee.
Under the rejected system, the
fraternity houses would submit to the
computer a list of those rushees de
sired to become fraternity members. In
addition, each rushee would submit a
list of the fraternities in his order of
preference. The computer would then
match the lists.
'Depersonalization'
The main argument against the plan
was the fear that using a computer
would depersonalize the rush, render
ing the fraternity system less attractive

to freshmen evaluating the fraternities.
Several fraternity members at the
meeting also expressed apprehension
that the computerized system would
tend to "shield" weak houses that
were not "carrying their weight" in
meeting fraternity system quotas.
The members reasoned that rushees
who were just interested in living on
campus would list all or most of the
houses. These rushees might then be
assigned to the "weaker" houses
which would not be able to fill the
house with "real fraternity material,"
the members said.
The members felt the placement of
rushees concerned only with remain
ing on campus in these "weaker"
houses would weaken both the par
ticular house and the entire system.
IFC President Bob Ottilie said he had
"put a lot of time" into planning the
computerized system and was "disap
pointed." With the computer, he said,
the fraternities would have been "able

to show for the first time . . . what the
real demand" for their facilities was.
Two proposals
The IFC submitted two proposals to
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson last December. First, they
proposed to continue permitting
over-crowding in fraternity houses.
They also proposed a revision of a sec
tion of the Guaranteed Housing Plan
concerning the forfeiture of fraternity

houses when individual houses miss
their quotas.
Robinson, who responded to the
proposals in a letter mailed to Ottilie
last week, attended yesterday's meet
ing to answer questions about his deci
sions.
Overcrowding allowed
Robinson said he was "willing to
allow 'overcrowding' by fraternity
members who matriculated before au
tumn, 1975." He said he would allow
this because "it was never our intent to
penalize students who came to the
University before the Guaranteed
Housing Plan was implemented."

Discussing the second proposal, he
said, "I cannot agree to your statement
that ... as long as the system as a
whole was meeting its quota, there
should be no penalties for individual
houses that missed their quotas.
Responsibility retained
"1 believe that the University should
not, and indeed will not, relinquish its
responsibility or authoirity in this
area . . . Changes made in the config
uration of the University's residence
system are made to meet the changing
needs and desires of its student popu
lation."

The members reasoned that rushees
who were just interested in living on
campus would list all or most of the
houses. These rushees might then be
assigned to the "weaker" houses

the members said.

IFC President Bob Ottilie said he had
"put a lot of time" into planning the
computerized system and was "disap
pointed." With the computer, he said,
the fraternities would have been "able

to show for the first time . . . what the
real demand" for their facilities was.
Two proposals
The IFC submitted two proposals to
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson last December. First, they
proposed to continue permitting
over-crowding in fraternity houses.
They also proposed a revision of a sec
tion of the Guaranteed Housing Plan
concerning the forfeiture of fraternity

houses when individual houses miss
their quotas.
Robinson, who responded to the
proposals in a letter mailed to Ottilie
last week, attended yesterday's meet
ing to answer questions about his deci
sions.
Overcrowding allowed
Robinson said he was "willing to
allow 'overcrowding' by fraternity
members who matriculated before au
tumn, 1975." He said he would allow
this because "it was never our intent to
penalize students who came to the
University before the Guaranteed
Housing Plan was implemented."

Discussing the second proposal, he
said, "I cannot agree to your statement
that ... as long as the system as a
whole was meeting its quota, there
should be no penalties for individual
houses that missed their quotas.
Responsibility retained
"1 believe that the University should
not, and indeed will not, relinquish its
responsibility or authoirity in this
area . . . Changes made in the config
uration of the University's residence
system are made to meet the changing
needs and desires of its student popu
lation."
The Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
rejected a proposed computerized bid
system for this spring's fraternity rush
at yesterday's meeting.
By a 9-3 vote, with one
abstention, the IFC rejected a plan that
would use a computer to facilitate the
matching of houses and rushees in this
spring's rush. The plan previously had
been approved unanimously by the
IFC's rush committee.
Under the rejected system, the
fraternity houses would submit to the
computer a list of those rushees de
sired to become fraternity members. In
addition, each rushee would submit a
list of the fraternities in his order of
preference. The computer would then
match the lists.
'Depersonalization'
The main argument against the plan
was the fear that using a computer
would depersonalize the rush, render
ing the fraternity system less attractive

to freshmen evaluating the fraternities.
Several fraternity members at the
meeting also expressed apprehension
that the computerized system would
tend to "shield" weak houses that
were not "carrying their weight" in
meeting fraternity system quotas.
