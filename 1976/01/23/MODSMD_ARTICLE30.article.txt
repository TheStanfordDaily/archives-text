# Swimmers host Invitational
## 
### CHRIS KAMEL 
Stanford's women's swimming squad, which
beat five teams before coming in second behind
Santa Clara last week in the Stanford Relays, hosts
the Stanford Invitational Championships this
weekend.
According to head coach Jim Gaughran, this
meet will by no means be an easy one for the Cards
as the Invitational includes the perennially pow
erful UCLA Bruins.
"UCLA has always had a very strong team,"
said Gaughran. "They should kill the rest of the
competition, but there will be an exciting bid for
second." Stanford will try to hold off. a strong
challenge from Arizona State, USC, Cal and Long
Beach State.
The Cardinals will rely on returning veterans
Vicki Hays, 1975 Association of Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women (AIAW) National finalist in
the 50-yard and 100-yard breast and 200-yard in
dividual medley, and Anneßrodell, 1975 finalist
in the 500-yard free. These two will lead the out
standing freshmen talent of Jo Harshbarger, Rose
Storm, Margot Hagstette and Leslie Crozier.
American record holder
Harshbarger, a native of Bellevue, Wash, is the
1975 National AAU Champion and American re

cord holder in the 1650 free with a 16:27.11 mark.
She has been used mainly in the 200 and 500 free
events and has responded by winning the 200 free
in this year's NCIAC Championships.
"College training has been more intense than
that of high school," Harshbarger said. "During
the season we swim three to four hours a day."
According to the freshman, Gaughran has re
sted the team a bit this week for the Invitational
Championships, but this has not stopped her and
teammate Crozier from working out a little longer
on their own.
"Sometimes college swimmers do not take
swimming that seriously," Harshbarger said.
"Our team is different, however. We have a lot of
depth and ambition and I think we'll go far."
Bright future
According to Gaughran, Jo has quite a future
ahead of her. "She has the talent and devotion to
do well in the sport," he said.
Harshbarger claims that she is not quite pleased
with her performance yet. "I've contributed to the
team, but my times are a little slower than I'd
like," she said.
Harshbarger would like to beat the National
times for her events, and she said she won't be
satisfied until she does.

in this year's NCIAC Championships.
"College training has been more intense than
that of high school," Harshbarger said. "During
the season we swim three to four hours a day."
According to the freshman, Gaughran has re
sted the team a bit this week for the Invitational
Championships, but this has not stopped her and
teammate Crozier from working out a little longer
on their own.
"Sometimes college swimmers do not take
swimming that seriously," Harshbarger said.
"Our team is different, however. We have a lot of
depth and ambition and I think we'll go far."
Bright future
According to Gaughran, Jo has quite a future
ahead of her. "She has the talent and devotion to
do well in the sport," he said.
Harshbarger claims that she is not quite pleased
with her performance yet. "I've contributed to the
team, but my times are a little slower than I'd
like," she said.
Harshbarger would like to beat the National
times for her events, and she said she won't be
satisfied until she does.

RECORD HOLDER—Stanford freshman Jo Harshbarger will be among those participating in the
Stanford Invitationals today and tomorrow. Harshbarger, an All-American, was a member of the
1972 United States Olympic Team.
Stanford's women's swimming squad, which
beat five teams before coming in second behind
Santa Clara last week in the Stanford Relays, hosts
the Stanford Invitational Championships this
weekend.
According to head coach Jim Gaughran, this
meet will by no means be an easy one for the Cards
as the Invitational includes the perennially pow
erful UCLA Bruins.
"UCLA has always had a very strong team,"
said Gaughran. "They should kill the rest of the
competition, but there will be an exciting bid for
second." Stanford will try to hold off. a strong
challenge from Arizona State, USC, Cal and Long
Beach State.
The Cardinals will rely on returning veterans
Vicki Hays, 1975 Association of Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women (AIAW) National finalist in
the 50-yard and 100-yard breast and 200-yard in
dividual medley, and Anneßrodell, 1975 finalist
in the 500-yard free. These two will lead the out
standing freshmen talent of Jo Harshbarger, Rose
Storm, Margot Hagstette and Leslie Crozier.
American record holder
Harshbarger, a native of Bellevue, Wash, is the
1975 National AAU Champion and American re

cord holder in the 1650 free with a 16:27.11 mark.
She has been used mainly in the 200 and 500 free
events and has responded by winning the 200 free
in this year's NCIAC Championships.
"College training has been more intense than
that of high school," Harshbarger said. "During
the season we swim three to four hours a day."
