# Dallmar adjusts to new job
## Remember ex-Card coach?

By GARY SPRAGUK
Howie Dallmar wasn't just
a coach, he was an institution.
For 21 years, he guided the
basketball program on the
Farm. He meant Stanford
basketball as the Morton girl
meant salt. But in the midst of
all the hoopla surrounding
first-year coach Dick Dißiaso
and his new-look team,
Dallmar has been all but for
gotten. For many, he has been
relegated to the musty pages
of Stanford sports history, to
take his place alongside Pop
Warner and Ernie Nevers.
But the book isn't closed
yet on Dallmar. Although no
longer connected with the
basketball program, he still
puts in a full day at the Athle
tic Department in his new
capacity of Special Asst. to
the Athletic Director.
The post of special asst. is
newly created, and unique in
the department. Dallmar',s as
signment is to pursue what
ever projects are given top

Twenty seven years was long enough. I was looking
forward to retiring. And the 6-8 record of last year didn't
help.

one sport. The plan has
drawn enthusiastic responses
from both athletes and fa
culty.
"We think it will be more
effective (than the diversified
program)," said Dallmar,
"because of the interests of
the coaches. This way they
can concentrate on their one
specific sport."
Dallmar predicts that
14,000 to 15,000 youngsters
will participate this year. Be
sides the obvious benefits of
filling summer on-campus
housing and supplementing
coaches' incomes, Dallmar
confided that the program
will be a good recruiting tool.
"If you get that kid here,"
Dallmar said "even if he's
only 12 or 13-years-old, and
have him see the campus and
get some coaching from our
staff, he might make it his
goal to come to Stanford."
In addition to his camp pro
ject, Dallmar helps out in the
intramural office. His particu

Joe Ruetz. As far as
Dallmar is concerned, the job
suits him just fine.
Dallmar's current project is
the coordination of the Stan
ford summer camps for high
school athletes. The assign
ment obviously interests him;
his normally staid demeanor
betrays hints of excitement as
he discusses his work.
Summer camps are not new
to the Athletic Department,
but they will have a new focus
this year. Instead of every
camp offering a diversified
program of several sports,
each camp will be devoted to

and assigning of officials for
1M basketball games.
Dallmar is enthusiastic
about and satisfied with his
job. but just a few months ago
he was quite unsure of his fu
ture.
He resigned last March
after 27 years in coaching. His
Stanford teams had compiled
a 264-264 mark, and his
lifetime record of 369-315
marked him as one of the
winningest coaches in col
lege basketball. But Dallmar
decided that it was time to
give it all up.
"Twenty-seven years was

long enough," he said. "1 was
looking forward to retiring.
And the 6-8 record of last year
didn't help."
Although Dallmar knew
that Stanford was planning to
start its specialized camp
program, the possibility of
continuing at Stanford in his
present capacity was not a
factor in his decision to retire.
As a result, Dallmar found

himself in the unenviable
position of being an un
employed 53-year-old ex
basketball coach.
Anxious to remain with
Stanford, Dallmar applied to
Ruetz for the new position.
Last August Ruetz an-

nounced that the job was
Dallmar's. Ruetz cited
Dallmar's background and
experience as reason for his
selection.

As for this year's basketball
team, Dallmar has nothing
but praise.
"Dißiaso has done a great
job along with his assistants.
Wolfe Perry and Gerge
Schader have been real plea
sures to watch. Perry's been a
surprise and Schader's a real
workhorse."
The IM Basketball office
might seem worlds removed
from the excitement of varsity
basketball, but Dallmar has
no desire to switch back. His
answer to the question of
whether he has the least de
sire to return to active coach
ing was a quick, definite
"No."
