Progress made in arms talks
MOSCOW — Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and
Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev ended talks last night with
some progress reported but no end to a 14-month deadlock
on a nuclear arms agreement.
A U.S. official involved in the negotiations said Kis
singer considered the three-day visit to Moscow worth
while and that the two sides were now closer to an agree
ment in principle than they were before his mission.
But the U.S. side acknowledged no agreement in prin
ciple on a new treaty after 7Vi hours of negotiations bet
ween Kissinger and Brezhnev.
Kissinger was to meet today with Soviet Foreign Minis
ter Andrei Gromyko on the Middle East and other matters
apart from the nuclear question.
After the talk with Gromyko he leaves for Brussels to
report to ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion.
U.S., Spain reach defense accord
MADRID — The United States and Spain have agreed
on a full-fledged defense treaty to continue American use
of military bases in Spain after nearly 20 years of military
cooperation, U.S. sources reported yesterday.
The treaty, requiring approval by two-thirds of the U.S.
Senate, would be a clear attempt by both sides to bolster
Western defenses against communism and fill a gap
caused by faltering NATO allies in the Mediteranean.
The treaty would call for an estimated $1 billion in U.S.
aid and credits to Spain, 85 percent of which would be in
military hardware, over the next five years.
U.S. sources said the aid would include some sophisti
cated military equipment but no arms capable of deliver
ing nuclear weapons.
They said the treaty calls on the U.S. Congress and the
Spanish parliament to consider any attack by a third party
on the other country but does not require a military re
sponse.
There is a moral responsibility but not a legal one,
sources said.
Agreement on a treaty would be seen as a sign of U.S.
confidence in the new regime of King Juan Carlos after
nearly 40 years of dictatorial rule and isolation from
Europe by Gen. Francisco Franco, who died in November.
Ford picks mediator for labor post
WASHINGTON — President Ford yesterday gave W.J.
Usery Jr., a one-time welder, the job of trying to repair the
administration's rupture with organized labor.
In nominating Usery as secretary of labor, the President
expressed confidence in the ability of the 52-year-old
mediator to "handle this very tough job" in a year in
which Ford noted there might be troublesome labor dis
putes in such keyindustries as autos, truckingand rubber.
Ford said Usery's tremendous record of settling some of
the most difficult labor disputes as director of the Federal

Mediation Service "qualifies him superbly" for the
Cabinet post.
The nomination was expected ever since John Dunlop
resigned Jan. 13, saying he felt he no longer had the confi
dence of labor after Ford vetoed legislation which would
have given unions the right to picket an entire construc
tion site.The President had earlier promised to sign the
Bill.
Despite Usery's union background — he once was an
official of the International Association of Machinists —
AFL-CIO officials have said it's unlikely the trade union
movement would be receptive to restoring White House
links. But as Ford indicated, Usery, a Democrat, will be
counted on primarily to use his persuasive powers to help
maintain labor peace in this election year.
High court to review death penalty
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court set the stage
yesterday for a broad review of capital punishment laws
enacted since the court's 1972 decision declaring previ
ous capital punishment laws unconstitutional.
The court announced it would hear arguments March
30 and 31 on the appeal of six men, both black and white,
sentenced to death for committing murder in Georgia,
Texas, North Carolina, Florida and Louisiana.
The justices are expected to decide during the current
term whether the new laws enacted in those states are
constitutional. This means a decision probably would be
reached by late June.
According to an account made last Feb. 2 by the NAACP
Legal Defense Fund, there are 404 men and seven women
on death row in 30 of the 35 states that have re-enacted
death penalties since the 1972 decision.
The court's ruling is expected to apply to all the states
since the laws in the five states embrace the main lines of
attack used by state legislatures to revive the maximum
penalty.
Scouts: No women Cubmasters
BALTIMORE — Saying that growing boys need a man to
lead them, the national president of the Boy Scouts of
America announced yesterday the scouting movement
has ruled out women as cubmasters.
"Advice from sociologists and child psychologists has
convinced us that leadership should be male and we be
lieve that," said Arch Monson Jr., the scout official.
