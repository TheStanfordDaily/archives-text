# Franklin advocates shift in campus policy power

### BERT BOWER 
Stanford should be taken out of the
hands of "wealthy corporation own
ers" and handed over to the people,
former Assoc. English Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin told an overflow crowd in
Cubberley Auditorium yesterday.
It was the first public appearance
here in nearly two years by Franklin,
who was fired from his tenured faculty
post in 1972 for allegedly "urging and
inciting" students to disrupt Univer
sity operations. The speech was spon
sored by the Alliance for Radical
Change as part of Disorientation Week
activities.
"Stanford is the key institution in
the ongoing battle against the democ
ratization of education in the United
States," Franklin said.
Farm workers, blacks and white
working class children are not being
allowed equal education in the coun
try's universities because they pose
"the threat of insurrection" to society,
Franklin said.
'Serve the people'
Referring to his dismissal from Stan
ford, Franklin said, "everything else

was okay until they (the administra
tion) found out I couldn't be rehabili
tated because I insisted that the Uni
versity should serve the people, in
stead of oppressing them."
Stanford shouldn't be a private en
clave closed off from the people it
exploits, Franklin said. He urged the
University to admit more poor and
Third World students and said Stan
ford should offer night classes to Uni -
versity employes.
He said a strong lobbying effort is
currently underway to convince the
California legislature to increase gov
ernment support of private educa
tional institutions and to decrease
funds for public universities.
"I think people at this University
should realize that it is a rip-off," de
clared Franklin.
Vietnam contributions
"Stanford, as an exclusive private
institution, is the nerve center for the
development of electronic warfare,"
Franklin said. "Stanford made spec
tacular contributions to the Vietnam
war, including the development of the
electronic battle line and the plan of
strategic hamlet destruction," he ad
ded.
One of Stanford's main purposes is
to teach people how to "maintain the
American empire," he said.
Franklin, who is currently serving in
a three-year, untenured appointment
at Rutgers University in Newark, N.J.,
said he believed "the average con
sciousness of students today is higher
than it was five years ago. Just because
students aren't breaking windows
doesn't mean there isn't a revolutio
nary consciousness."
'Bourgeoisie reality'
He said the purpose of institutions of
higher education is to "make us accept
bourgeoise reality," but admitted that
it was universities that developed an
acute criticism of U.S. imperialism.
"Rough times lay ahead for
America, which will become more ex

treme as the last of our empire is dis
mantled," Franklin predicted.
Listing the names of several trustees
and the corporations with which they
are associated, he said, "These noble
enterprises are fulfilling the white
man's burden throughout the world."
Fielding a question from the audi
ence concerning recent allegations
charging that Prof, of Psychiatry and
Psychology Karl Pribram assaulted
and struck his secretary, Franklin said
the administration would have acted
differently if "it had happened to a
professor on the Left."
Asked if any change can come from
within universities, Franklin
answered, "We must work for change
both from within and without univer
sities."
But he said Stanford has done "a
good job" of keeping professors out
who challenge capitalism. Professors
who speak out against capitalism, he
added, are in a minority and seldom
are able to put into practice their re
volutionary ideas.
An authority on novelist Herman
Melville, Franklin is the first tenured
professor to be dismissed from Stan
ford's faculty.
Franklin filed suit against the Uni
versity to regain his job, and also has a
lawsuit pending against the regents of
the University of Colorado, who re
fused to hire him in 1974.
U.S. District Court Judge Alfred
Arraj said Wednesday he would issue
his ruling on Franklin's suit against
the Colorado University Board of Re
gents at a later date, according to the
Associated Press. Testimony in the
hearing concluded Tuesday.
Franklin's attorney, Anthony Renzo,
argued in his closing arguments that
the regents voted noi to hire Franklin
because they disagreed with his politi
cal views.
