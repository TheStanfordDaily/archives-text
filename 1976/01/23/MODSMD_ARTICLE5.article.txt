# Syrian-negotiated agreement yields shaky Lebanese peace

### 
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — A Syrian
negotiated cease-fire appeared to take
hold last night in Lebanon's civil war
after fierce fighting right up to the
deadline between Christians and
Lebanese Moslem groups backed by
Palestinians.
Sources within the security forces
said 61 persons were killed and more
than 100 wounded in day-long fight
ing throughout the country.
Scattered shooting was reported in
some areas after the 5 p.m. to 10 a.m.
(PST) — deadline.
However, both the Palestinian guer
rilla news agency, WAFA, and head
quarters for the Christian Phalange
party said the cease-fire seemed to be
holding.
President Suleiman Franjieh an
nounced the accord on state radio
early yesterday after meeting with a
peacemaking Syrian delegation
headed by Foreign Minister Abdul
Halim Khaddam. Franjieh said it in
corporates "fundamental principles

for a political solution" and was ag
reed upon by all factions in Lebanon's
nine-month-old civil war.
The cease-fire deadline was set by a
"joint supreme military commission"
made up of representatives of the
Lebanese and Syrian armies as well as
the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) to
supervise "an end to the fighting and a
return to normal life."
The agreement calls for the return of
all Christians, Moslems and Palesti
nians to the areas they occupied before
the war; retreat of all armed men to
their bases, including troops of the
PLA who came from Syria this week;
redistribution of political power to end
Christian dominance and give the
Moslems an equal voice, and machin
ery to improve the economic lot of the
Moslems.
The Moslems want to change Leba
non's social structure, up to now
dominated by the Christian minority.
Members of the PLA came into Leba

non from Syria this week to beef up the
Moslems.
The Christians said there can be no
change in the governmental set-up
until the problem of Palestinian guer
rillas in Lebanon is solved.
In Washington, the State Depart
ment reacted cautiously to the an
nouncement from Beirut. Press officer
John Trattner said the United States
has not been informed of details of the
new plan.
Israeli government officials in Tel
Aviv said that veiled Israeli warnings,
both public and through diplomatic
channels, had deterred Syria from
sending its own troops into Lebanon.
The officials charged that units of the
PLA from Syria went into Lebanon
with the blessing and consent of the
Syrian government.
Israel considered the heavy infusion
of PLA regulars into Lebanon as a Sy
rian threat to impose terms on the
Lebanese for a political solution, the
officials said.
