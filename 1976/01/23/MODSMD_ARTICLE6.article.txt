# Construction begins soon
## Project to add PEP to SLAC 
### ALEXANDER LEFF 
Construction of the Positron-Electron Project (PEP),
a new $78 million colliding-beam storage ring, will
begin sometime this summer at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC). PEP will be a joint project
of SLAC and the University of California's Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory.
PEP, an 18 billion electron-volt facility whose
diameter will be almost one-half mile, will be buried
underground around one end of the SLAC accelerator.
The new storage ring will cover 13 acres of Stanford
land and take approximately four-and-a-half years to
complete.
A smaller version of PEP, called the Stanford
Positron-Electron Asymmetric Ring (SPEAR), is cur
rently operating at SLAC.
Last year's SPEAR discoveries of new elementary
particles — the Psi particles — in the nucleus of the
atom shook the world of physics and changed scien
tist's views about the fundamental nature of matter.
'Extent fronties'
Douglas Dupen, SLAC,director of personnel, said
PEP will "extend our capacity dramatically — it will
push our frontier way, way froward in the exploration
of the nucleus of the atom."
President Gerald Ford recently recommended a $25
million appropriation for PEP in the fiscal year 1977
budget. Congress has already appropriated $2.9 mill
ion for this fiscal year.
"The astounding success of the experiments at
SPEAR gave us the edge in getting funding for PEP,"

said Dusen.
Final approval from Congress for the $25 million
appropriation is "almost foregone," according to Du
sen.
Storage ring
PEP will take electrons that have been accelerated
by SLAC's main linear accelerator and inject these fast
moving electrons into a storage ring. Positrons, the
anti-matter opposites of electrons, will also be injected
into this ring but will travel in the opposite direction
of the electrons.
The counter-rotating electrons and positrons will be
made to collide head-on. From this collision of matter
and anti-matter will come tremendous amounts of
energy as the elementary particles, about which scien
tists seek to learn more, are created.
The colliding-beam storage ring has given physi
cists a new answer to their own energy crisis. Instead
of having to build ever-bigger linear accelerators at
astronomically escalating costs, the storage ring gives
them much higher energies with much smaller and
less costly machines.
Higher energy
Conventional accelerators shoot high-speed, high
energy particles at target particles which are standing
still. But when both particles are accelerated and col
lide head-on at high speed in a storage ring, the energy
of the collision is much higher.

project with UC-Berkeley's Tom Elioff as deputy direc
tor.

SLAC Adjunct Prof. John Rees will head the PEP
project with UC-Berkeley's Tom Elioff as deputy direc
tor.
Construction of the Positron-Electron Project (PEP),
a new $78 million colliding-beam storage ring, will
begin sometime this summer at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC). PEP will be a joint project
of SLAC and the University of California's Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory.
PEP, an 18 billion electron-volt facility whose
diameter will be almost one-half mile, will be buried
underground around one end of the SLAC accelerator.
The new storage ring will cover 13 acres of Stanford
land and take approximately four-and-a-half years to
complete.
A smaller version of PEP, called the Stanford
Positron-Electron Asymmetric Ring (SPEAR), is cur
rently operating at SLAC.
Last year's SPEAR discoveries of new elementary
particles — the Psi particles — in the nucleus of the
atom shook the world of physics and changed scien
tist's views about the fundamental nature of matter.
'Extent fronties'
Douglas Dupen, SLAC,director of personnel, said
PEP will "extend our capacity dramatically — it will
push our frontier way, way froward in the exploration
of the nucleus of the atom."
President Gerald Ford recently recommended a $25
million appropriation for PEP in the fiscal year 1977
budget. Congress has already appropriated $2.9 mill
ion for this fiscal year.
"The astounding success of the experiments at
SPEAR gave us the edge in getting funding for PEP,"

said Dusen.
Final approval from Congress for the $25 million
appropriation is "almost foregone," according to Du
sen.
Storage ring
PEP will take electrons that have been accelerated
by SLAC's main linear accelerator and inject these fast
moving electrons into a storage ring. Positrons, the
anti-matter opposites of electrons, will also be injected
into this ring but will travel in the opposite direction
of the electrons.
The counter-rotating electrons and positrons will be
made to collide head-on. From this collision of matter
and anti-matter will come tremendous amounts of
energy as the elementary particles, about which scien
tists seek to learn more, are created.
The colliding-beam storage ring has given physi
cists a new answer to their own energy crisis. Instead
of having to build ever-bigger linear accelerators at
astronomically escalating costs, the storage ring gives
them much higher energies with much smaller and
less costly machines.
Higher energy
Conventional accelerators shoot high-speed, high
energy particles at target particles which are standing
still. But when both particles are accelerated and col
lide head-on at high speed in a storage ring, the energy
of the collision is much higher.
