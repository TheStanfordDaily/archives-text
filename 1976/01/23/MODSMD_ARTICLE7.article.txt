## Gag rules 
### 
One of the greatest dangers to the First Amend
ment's guarantee of freedom of the press is the ever
increasing issuance of "gag orders" on journalists.
In the past few weeks an alarming number of judges
throughout the country have forbidden journalists to
publish stories in cases where these judges believe
prejudicial publicity might hinder a defendant's right
to receive a fair trial.
In Nebraska, a judge gagged reporters covering the
pretrial proceedings of a defendant charged with mur
dering six people. The trial court judge in that case
then refused to allow journalists or members of the
public to be present for jury selection.
Later that judge rescinded his ruling and allowed
members of the public to attend, but barred three jour
nalists who said they would not follow his restrictions
banning reports about the jury selection.
After other journalists boycotted the jury selection in
protest of the judge's ruling, he explained to the repor
ters why he would still allow the public to be present:
"I don't fear the public as I do you fellows."
In Massachusetts, a judge has forbidden journalists
from reporting anything concerning the past record of
Susan Saxe, an anti-war radical recently arrested by
the FBI and charged with murder.
Gag orders, which were seldom uspd in past years —
and then only to forbid prosecutors and defense attor
neys (officers of the court) and policemen from con
versing with the press — obviously constitute a grave
threat when applied to the press.
Therefore, we oppose the use of gag orders on mem
bers of the press. Such action is not only a severe
abridgement of the First Amendment, but also hinders
the press in its role as a check on government.
Gag orders on the press also present a danger to our
judicial system. The gag order in the Nebraska case
was followed by a jury selection which was nearly
closed. It is only a short step to closing a trial to both
the press and the public. .Gag orders may well be a
precursor to the return of the Star Chamber.
On the other hand, press coverage before and during
a trail does not abridge a person's right to a fair trial.
The Sixth Amendment, along with the Fourteenth,
guarantees a person the right to due process of the law
— it does not guarantee that a trial will be free of
publicity.
We also condemn those judges who have recently
made use of gag orders on journalists. These judges
have not served the administration ofjustice — rather
they have harmed the Constitution, sparked disrespect
for the judiciary and endangered the right of a free and
democratic people to know. These judges' ridiculous
use of gag orders has even been questioned by some of
their colleagues, who now look upon gag orders with
revulsion.
Finally, we support those journalists who have ex
pressed disapproval of gag orders — and refused, in
some cases, to obey the orders. In a recent case, the
New York Times announced it could not abide by a gag
order and would publish information concerning a
trial.
Reporters in this case will face contempt citations
with penalties of jail sentences or fines. Yet such ac
tions are necessary to bring to light the perils of gag
orders and the necessity of providing the public with
essential information.

a trail does not abridge a person's right to a fair trial.
The Sixth Amendment, along with the Fourteenth,
guarantees a person the right to due process of the law
— it does not guarantee that a trial will be free of
publicity.
We also condemn those judges who have recently
made use of gag orders on journalists. These judges
have not served the administration ofjustice — rather
they have harmed the Constitution, sparked disrespect
for the judiciary and endangered the right of a free and
democratic people to know. These judges' ridiculous
use of gag orders has even been questioned by some of
their colleagues, who now look upon gag orders with
revulsion.
Finally, we support those journalists who have ex
pressed disapproval of gag orders — and refused, in
some cases, to obey the orders. In a recent case, the
New York Times announced it could not abide by a gag
order and would publish information concerning a
trial.
Reporters in this case will face contempt citations
with penalties of jail sentences or fines. Yet such ac
tions are necessary to bring to light the perils of gag
orders and the necessity of providing the public with
essential information.
One of the greatest dangers to the First Amend
ment's guarantee of freedom of the press is the ever
increasing issuance of "gag orders" on journalists.
In the past few weeks an alarming number of judges
throughout the country have forbidden journalists to
publish stories in cases where these judges believe
prejudicial publicity might hinder a defendant's right
to receive a fair trial.
In Nebraska, a judge gagged reporters covering the
pretrial proceedings of a defendant charged with mur
dering six people. The trial court judge in that case
then refused to allow journalists or members of the
public to be present for jury selection.
Later that judge rescinded his ruling and allowed
members of the public to attend, but barred three jour
nalists who said they would not follow his restrictions
banning reports about the jury selection.
After other journalists boycotted the jury selection in
protest of the judge's ruling, he explained to the repor
ters why he would still allow the public to be present:
"I don't fear the public as I do you fellows."
In Massachusetts, a judge has forbidden journalists
from reporting anything concerning the past record of
Susan Saxe, an anti-war radical recently arrested by
the FBI and charged with murder.
Gag orders, which were seldom uspd in past years —
and then only to forbid prosecutors and defense attor
neys (officers of the court) and policemen from con
versing with the press — obviously constitute a grave
threat when applied to the press.
Therefore, we oppose the use of gag orders on mem
bers of the press. Such action is not only a severe
abridgement of the First Amendment, but also hinders
the press in its role as a check on government.
Gag orders on the press also present a danger to our
judicial system. The gag order in the Nebraska case
was followed by a jury selection which was nearly
closed. It is only a short step to closing a trial to both
the press and the public. .Gag orders may well be a
precursor to the return of the Star Chamber.
On the other hand, press coverage before and during
a trail does not abridge a person's right to a fair trial.
The Sixth Amendment, along with the Fourteenth,
guarantees a person the right to due process of the law
— it does not guarantee that a trial will be free of
publicity.
