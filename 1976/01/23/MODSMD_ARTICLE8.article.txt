# SALT misses critical problems
## David Schwartz 
### 
The problems of strategic nuc
lear disarmament are highly
complex. Jerry Lampton's
analysis, in the Jan. 13 Daily, of
the U.S. position at the Strategic
Arms Limitation Talks (SALT)
not only makes light of this
complexity, but in his effort to
oversimplify the issues with
Cold War rhetoric, Lampton neg
lects to point out the serious
problems that do exist regarding
our role at SALT.
The crux of the Lampton
thesis is that the Soviets are at
tempting to gain and legitimize
nuclear "superiority" over the
United States. "Superiority" is a
far more complex word than
Lampton lets on.
His definition seems to be in
terms of throw-weight — the
amount of gross tonnage the
Soviet Union can hurl at the U.S.
It is true, by this definition, that
the Soviets are permitted
superiority over the U.S.
Other definitions
But what other definitions of
"superiority" are possible? Are
the Soviets truly in a better posi
tion strategically than the U.S.
by virtue of an advantage in
throw-weight capability?
The answer is a complex, but
emphatic, no. At the risk of over
simplification, the doctrine of
Mutually Assured Destruction
says that a nation will not launch
a nuclear attack on an enemy un
less it can be sure in doing so it
will wipe out enough of the
enemy's nuclear arsenal to ren
der the enemy's retaliatory
power small enough to be ac
ceptable.
The operational implication of

this is that a nation's weapons
must be invulnerable, numerous
and reliable in order to deter an
opponent's attack. Whatever
other differences there may be
between the arsenals of the U.S.
and the Soviet Union, they are
both invulnerable, reliable and
numerous.
Thus, both powers know that,
should they start a nuclear war
with each other, the retaliatory
level of damage to their own na
tion will be unnacceptable.
Only a small factor
Since both sides are aware of
this fact, bluffing can play no
role, since threats become unbe
lievable. If this doctrine is to be
accepted, then throw-weight is
only one small factor in the over
all balance and certainly not one
which can give one nation
"superiority" over another.
The majority of the U.S. de
fense community accepts this
doctrine. But do the Soviets ac
cept it?
The Soviets have explicitly
stated that they do on several oc
casions. Moreover, they have
never acted to the contrary.
Lampton points to Soviet
spending on civil defense to in
dicate that the Soviets are pre
pared to accept nuclear retalia
tion by the United States. Sev
eral points should put this asser
tion into perspective.
First, the Soviets have four,
probably five, enemies who
could deliver nuclear weapons
to the Soviet homeland: the U.S.,
Britain, France, China and prob
ably Israel. The U.S. has but one
comparable enemy — the Soviet
Union.
Thus, it should not be au- '

tomatically assumed the Soviets'
civil defense program is de
signed to protect specifically
against the U.S.
Alternate explanations
Second, Lampton naively
takes at face value the text of a
Soviet civil defense manual.
There are many alternate expla
nations for the four percent
casualty figure it puts forth.
One should never assume that
a nation means exactly what it
says, especially when that na
tion is characteristically closed
and secretive. Actions, not
rhetoric or rubles, are the best
criteria for policy evaluation.
As Sidney Drell. deputy direc
tor of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) and
long-time arms control
specialist, said in his testimony
before the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee last September:
"They (the Soviets) have spent
a lot of rubles developing plans
on paper, generating civil de
fense manuals and identifying
and equipping a variety of shel
ter spaces. However, I am not
aware of any large-scale Soviet
civil defense training exercises
or rehearsals involving massive
population relocation or evacua
tion."
Loopholes
The fact remains, however,
that though neither party has yet
violated the SALT agreements,
both sides are taking generous
advantage of loopholes in the ag
reements. It is these loopholes
which concern me.
For example, both sides are
proceeding without hesitation
on new technologies designed to
make warheads more accurate.

These developments can be seen
as a threat to the invulnerability
of the fixed land-based missile
forces of both sides, and thus as a
stimulus for instability.
In addition, the U.S. is devot
ing immense time and resources
for its long-range cruise missile
program, if not soon put under
control, this program may lead
to a whole new arsenal of
strategic nuclear weapons
which would then destabilize
the precarious global nuclear ba
lance.
Distraction
Another problem with the
SALT negotiations is the two
participant nature of the talks.
This distracts officials —and the
public — from one of the most
critical arms control problems:
the spread of nuclear weapons.
If the dozen or so countries
which are capable of developing
nuclear weapons within the next
decade do so, maintenance of
world peace will become a far
more difficult task.
These critical problems are
not being dealt with by SALT.
They certainly deserve the atten
tion which officials in
Washington and Moscow are
loathe to give them. It will be
difficult enough for the U.S. and
the Soviet Union to come to an
agreement based on the Vla
divostok Summit when the talks
resume later this month.
We can expect the talks will
not touch upon the questions
raised here. Hut if Washington
waits too long, opportunity to
solve these problems, or at least
to mitigate them, will be lost.
