# Should JV b-ball have been axed?
## Women, men's varsity profit but. . . 
### JEFF WAHBA 
Remember the days when JV
stood for junior varsity basket
ball instead of January vacation
for the cagers? Just ask any one of
15 athletes who are now starring
in pick-up games at Stanford and
they will tell you about a team
that won 13 out of its last 14
games and had a 14-4 record last
year.
But that team is no longer able
to treat Stanford basketball fans
to exciting games preceding the
varsity's home contests. Due to
monetary problems which seem
to be afflicting athletic depart
ments nationwide, Stanford de
cided to drop all of its junior var
sity programs last year except in
football.
"It's a shame it had to go, but
most schools in the country are
being forced to do the same
thing," Head Basketball Coach
Dick Dißiaso said.
"The cut doesn't have any
negative effect on the varsity. In
fact, in a way it helps; it allows
the former JV coach to devote
much more time to scouting and
recruiting; it makes busy Maples
slightly more available for
scheduling; and it helps the fi
nancial picture," Dißiaso said.
In recruiting matters the cut
makes little difference. "The
men we're trying to recruit hope
to play considerably in varsity
games their freshman year. So
they care little whether we have
a JV program. Anyway, we
wouldn't be recruiting them if
thev didn't have obvious varsity

ability," Dißiaso commented.
Though Dißiaso sees littje
connection between Stanford's
old fV program and the varsity.
Ken Morgan, former asst. JV
basketball coach and now the
women's asst. basketball
coach, has a different opinion.
"We ran the same plays last
year as the varsity," Morgan
said. "So that any JV player
would be ready to move up to the
varsity when needed. The ability
level of the JVs was strong, too,
as evidenced by this year's var
sity. Dick Dohrmann, Mark Fitz
ner and Scott Russell of the var
sity squad all played on the JV
last year."
Players disappointed
What do last year's JV players
think of the cut? Almost unani
mously they are disappointed
and believe the program was
very worthwhile. "Most of the
players were varsity aspirants
and took the season pretty seri
ously," guard Warner Session
commented.
Forward Steve Robinson said,
"It was a good program, though
the guys might have almost
taken it too seriously," and
high-scoring Sven Walker recal
led, "It was great. It wasn't like a
job like it sometimes seems for
the varsity players. I got a lot out
of it."
Title IX
So what has taken the place of
JV basketball games before the
varsity contests? For the most
part, it's been women's basket
ball contests. Stanford athletic

personnel are quick to point out
though that increases in funding
for the women's program are not
the result of the JV cut but rather
of Title IX.
Title IX basically states that
men and women should be given
equal opportunity to participate
in collegiate athletics. Thus, this
year the women's schedule has
expanded from eight to 14
games, they practice in spacious
Maples Pavilion instead of Roble
Gym. they have access to the
main training facilities and they
have a far nicer locker room.
"1 hope the expansion in our
program didn't affect the JV
program, though it does seem we
have a lot of the things they used
to have," forward Sukie Jackson
said. "I think the University
realized it had a commitment to
Title IX and that's why our prog
ram expanded. It was disap
pointing to see the JV program
go."
Stanford fans have expressed
mixed emotion about the re
placement of the JV games with
women's games.
"It's fantastic that the women
are finally getting some recogni
tion," one ardent follower said.
But on the other side, senior
Dave Hand commented, "I don't
think the new Maples Moppets
make the grade in the eyes of
Stanford fans."
Whatever the opinion. JV bas
ketball at Stanford is now just a
thing of the past and women's
basketball is here to stav.
