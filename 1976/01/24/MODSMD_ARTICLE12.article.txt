# Aide 'accents' New Era
## 
### JEFF PARIETTI 
Assistant coaches are usually seen and not ap
preciated. One doesn't normally even hear about
an assistant until he gets picked for his own head
coaching job.
But Stanford's Tom McLaughlin doesn't fit the
mold. When Dick Dißiaso's young aide storms off
the bench and launches into one of his familiar
tirades, employing a New York accent that would
make even Rhoda cringe, observers can't help but
take note.
Some fans seem to think that McLaughlin's
primary task in Dißiaso's scheme of things is to
keep the referees honest. But, McLaughlin said,
"Coach Dißiaso is in charge of the refs. Al
though," he admits, "l do sometimes try to help
them make the right call."
Played with Erving
McLaughlin, 24, grew up in New York City and
went on to star in basketball at Fordham Prep. He
then took his game to the University of Mas
sachusetts, where he started at forward, averaged
in double figures and played alongside Julius Erv
ing, the infamous Dr. J.
"We used to call him Juli," says McLaughlin.
"He got his Dr. ). nickname after he went into the
pros."
While Erving was lured from school by the pro
fessionals after two years, McLaughlin stayed to
graduate and was named the outstanding scholar
athlete in his senior year.
After completing school, he was offered a trvout
with the Boston Celtics, but McLaughlin opted
instead for a chance to play basketball in Europe.
"My agent got me an offer to play in Switzer
land," he recalls, "and considering they gave me a
house and a car while I was there, it was a pretty
good deal." And as a former New Yorker,
McLaughlin probably couldn't bear the thought of
donning the Celtic green.
In Switzerland, McLaughlin found more holes
in opponents' defenses than in the local cheese.
Playing for the Neuchatel Sport team, the B-foot-5,
205-pound McLaughlin averaged 34 points a
game two years ago, and last year as a player
coach he set quite an example for his players by

firing in 28 points a game.
Despite his impressive exploits, McLaughlin
shies away from scrimmaging with the Stanford
team. "My brother, Frank, an assistant at Notre
Dame for the past five years, told me never to
scrimmage with players you're coaching,"
McLaughlin says. "They might find out how bad
you really are."
Lucky to get job
McLaughlin first met his boss-to-be, Dick Di-
Biaso, at a Notre Dame summer basketball camp,
and he considers himself very fortunate to have
been asked to join the New Regime at Stanford.
"I couldn't have started out in a better college
program," he says. "Both Dick and Bob (Fre
derick, the other assistant coach) treat me as an
equal even though they've been coach ing for more
years than I've been on the earth."
McLaughlin also approves of Dißiaso's practice
of soliciting input from his assistants during a
game. "Watch us during a timeout," he says."The
three of us step aside and get our thoughts to
gether, and then Dick leaves to go into the huddle
with the players. Most coaches," McLaughlin
continues, "don't even consult with their assis
tants."
McLaughlin thinks that whereas in the East,
"Coaches usually try to be the big, tough guy,
western coaches have a more mature, sophisti
cated attitude." And the Stanford players share
the latter approach, according to McLaughlin.
"There are no big-head cases on this team," he
says. "Some teams with our record would have
dissension and the guys would be beating each
other up in the lockerroom, but all of our players
get along pretty well."
So McLaughlin is happy at Stanford for now,
but, like most assistants, he aspires to his own
head job someday. "You should move around in
the coaching business and not become too com
placent," he says. "But I'm not really thinking too
far ahead because if the program here doesn't do
very well, I won't be going anywhere."

Playing for the Neuchatel Sport team, the B-foot-5,
205-pound McLaughlin averaged 34 points a
game two years ago, and last year as a player
coach he set quite an example for his players by

firing in 28 points a game.
Despite his impressive exploits, McLaughlin
shies away from scrimmaging with the Stanford
team. "My brother, Frank, an assistant at Notre
Dame for the past five years, told me never to
scrimmage with players you're coaching,"
McLaughlin says. "They might find out how bad
you really are."
Lucky to get job
McLaughlin first met his boss-to-be, Dick Di-
Biaso, at a Notre Dame summer basketball camp,
and he considers himself very fortunate to have
been asked to join the New Regime at Stanford.
"I couldn't have started out in a better college
program," he says. "Both Dick and Bob (Fre
derick, the other assistant coach) treat me as an
equal even though they've been coach ing for more
years than I've been on the earth."
McLaughlin also approves of Dißiaso's practice
of soliciting input from his assistants during a
game. "Watch us during a timeout," he says."The
three of us step aside and get our thoughts to
gether, and then Dick leaves to go into the huddle
with the players. Most coaches," McLaughlin
continues, "don't even consult with their assis
tants."
McLaughlin thinks that whereas in the East,
"Coaches usually try to be the big, tough guy,
western coaches have a more mature, sophisti
cated attitude." And the Stanford players share
the latter approach, according to McLaughlin.
"There are no big-head cases on this team," he
says. "Some teams with our record would have
dissension and the guys would be beating each
other up in the lockerroom, but all of our players
get along pretty well."
So McLaughlin is happy at Stanford for now,
but, like most assistants, he aspires to his own
head job someday. "You should move around in
the coaching business and not become too com
placent," he says. "But I'm not really thinking too
far ahead because if the program here doesn't do
very well, I won't be going anywhere."

Asst. coach Tom McLaughlin confers with Dick Dißiaso.
Assistant coaches are usually seen and not ap
preciated. One doesn't normally even hear about
an assistant until he gets picked for his own head
coaching job.
But Stanford's Tom McLaughlin doesn't fit the
mold. When Dick Dißiaso's young aide storms off
the bench and launches into one of his familiar
tirades, employing a New York accent that would
make even Rhoda cringe, observers can't help but
take note.
Some fans seem to think that McLaughlin's
primary task in Dißiaso's scheme of things is to
keep the referees honest. But, McLaughlin said,
"Coach Dißiaso is in charge of the refs. Al
though," he admits, "l do sometimes try to help
them make the right call."
Played with Erving
McLaughlin, 24, grew up in New York City and
went on to star in basketball at Fordham Prep. He
then took his game to the University of Mas
sachusetts, where he started at forward, averaged
in double figures and played alongside Julius Erv
ing, the infamous Dr. J.
"We used to call him Juli," says McLaughlin.
"He got his Dr. ). nickname after he went into the
pros."
While Erving was lured from school by the pro
fessionals after two years, McLaughlin stayed to
graduate and was named the outstanding scholar
athlete in his senior year.
After completing school, he was offered a trvout
with the Boston Celtics, but McLaughlin opted
instead for a chance to play basketball in Europe.
"My agent got me an offer to play in Switzer
land," he recalls, "and considering they gave me a
house and a car while I was there, it was a pretty
good deal." And as a former New Yorker,
McLaughlin probably couldn't bear the thought of
donning the Celtic green.
In Switzerland, McLaughlin found more holes
in opponents' defenses than in the local cheese.
