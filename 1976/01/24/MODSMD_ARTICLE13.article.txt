# Fan Fare: The people speak
## 
### RIV WEBER 
In the debut of FanFare the
Daily went ufter Stanford
basketball followers with the
question, "What do you think of
Coach Dick Dißiaso and the' New
Era' of Stanford basketball?"
Bonnie McColl (Dollie): I'm all
for it. I think the coach is doing a
good job. I hope everyone will
start coming.
Dr. William Dement (psychol
ogy professor): I think it is totally
satisfying in every aspect. The
team is exciting with promise for
the future. There is a gre pf r cach
ing staff and great players.
Jake Warde (varsity tennis
player): I think Dißiaso is doing a
heck of a job with what he's got.
The players are sticking in the
game, giving it 100 percent. It's
more entertaining. I wish the fans
would get a little more behind the
team though ... screaming and
yelling, and not just clapping
hands.
Viae Kershner (editor, Stanford
Daily): I don't think they play that
much of a different style of bas

ketball. But they do play with
more intensity. For example, I
never saw Tim Patterson play
hustling defense for more than
two minutes at a time until this
year.
Nancy Peterson (assistant di
rector, Sports Information Office):
I think it's exciting to see all the
interest that's developed on the
part of students and people in the
area. The style is more interesting,
more similar to the Big Ten games
I've seen back in Indiana.
Steve Dils (sophomore QB):
They're a lot of fun to watch. The
games don't get as dull this year.
Ellen Sale (statistician): Stan
ford needed a change. It's more
exciting now.
Steve Robinson (fan): He's a
tremendous coach, but I don't
think it's any more exciting bas
ketball.
Paul Bauman (sports editor,

Stanford Daily): Stanford has the
best coach in the Pac-8, and be
cause of him, I wouldn't be sur
prised if within a few years, Stan
ford has the best team in the Pac-8.
In only a few months, Dißiaso has
gotten a lot of Stanford students
excited about basketball. If he can
do that, he can do anything.
Wim Steenbakkers (sail
ing director): Dißiaso has the right
attitude and the right philosophy.
I feel that his involving the whole
student body is very good.
Rob Bayless (fan): It's more ex
citing. It's good to see the whole
team play together and not rely on
Rich Kelly so much.
SteveThurin (student, fan): The
reason we've got a new era is be
cause we don't have a center, and
we lost our best players. This was
a forced change.
Tim Ferguson (news editor,
Stanford Daily): It seems to me
we're still losing by one point, but
the Dollies are prettier.

Don Brunsten (Phi Beta Kappa,
fan): )ust as Hegel represents a
crucial stage in German
philosophy, so the introduction of
Coach Dißiaso represents a
watershed in Stanford basketball.
One can already discern in Dick
Dißiaso the glimmer of a strategic
giant. The organic Karma on the
court is so real, you know . . .
they're far out!
George Dekker (English profes
sor): Great improvement over last
year. The players are playing with
more vigor now, and I take this to
be Dißiaso's work.
Lewis Spitz (history professor):
I was a great Howie Dallmar fan,
and I liked his principles and
sportsmanship. But I like Di-
Biaso's aggressive technique and
his fighting down to the last mi
nute.
Gary Cohen (KZSU Sports
Network): They have a long way to
go, but I'll be with them all the
way.

good job. I hope everyone will
start coming.
Dr. William Dement (psychol
ogy professor): I think it is totally
satisfying in every aspect. The
team is exciting with promise for
the future. There is a gre pf r cach
ing staff and great players.
Jake Warde (varsity tennis
player): I think Dißiaso is doing a
heck of a job with what he's got.
The players are sticking in the
game, giving it 100 percent. It's
more entertaining. I wish the fans
would get a little more behind the
team though ... screaming and
yelling, and not just clapping
hands.
Viae Kershner (editor, Stanford
Daily): I don't think they play that
much of a different style of bas

ketball. But they do play with
more intensity. For example, I
never saw Tim Patterson play
hustling defense for more than
two minutes at a time until this
year.
Nancy Peterson (assistant di
rector, Sports Information Office):
I think it's exciting to see all the
interest that's developed on the
part of students and people in the
area. The style is more interesting,
more similar to the Big Ten games
I've seen back in Indiana.
Steve Dils (sophomore QB):
They're a lot of fun to watch. The
games don't get as dull this year.
Ellen Sale (statistician): Stan
ford needed a change. It's more
exciting now.
Steve Robinson (fan): He's a
tremendous coach, but I don't
think it's any more exciting bas
ketball.
Paul Bauman (sports editor,

Stanford Daily): Stanford has the
best coach in the Pac-8, and be
cause of him, I wouldn't be sur
prised if within a few years, Stan
ford has the best team in the Pac-8.
In only a few months, Dißiaso has
gotten a lot of Stanford students
excited about basketball. If he can
do that, he can do anything.
Wim Steenbakkers (sail
ing director): Dißiaso has the right
attitude and the right philosophy.
I feel that his involving the whole
student body is very good.
Rob Bayless (fan): It's more ex
citing. It's good to see the whole
team play together and not rely on
Rich Kelly so much.
SteveThurin (student, fan): The
reason we've got a new era is be
cause we don't have a center, and
we lost our best players. This was
a forced change.
Tim Ferguson (news editor,
Stanford Daily): It seems to me
we're still losing by one point, but
the Dollies are prettier.

Don Brunsten (Phi Beta Kappa,
fan): )ust as Hegel represents a
crucial stage in German
philosophy, so the introduction of
Coach Dißiaso represents a
watershed in Stanford basketball.
One can already discern in Dick
Dißiaso the glimmer of a strategic
giant. The organic Karma on the
court is so real, you know . . .
they're far out!
George Dekker (English profes
sor): Great improvement over last
year. The players are playing with
more vigor now, and I take this to
be Dißiaso's work.
Lewis Spitz (history professor):
I was a great Howie Dallmar fan,
and I liked his principles and
sportsmanship. But I like Di-
Biaso's aggressive technique and
his fighting down to the last mi
nute.
Gary Cohen (KZSU Sports
Network): They have a long way to
go, but I'll be with them all the
way.
In the debut of FanFare the
Daily went ufter Stanford
basketball followers with the
question, "What do you think of

Bonnie McColl (Dollie): I'm all
