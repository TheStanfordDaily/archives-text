This was supposed to be the year that Berkeley
became the capital of the Pacific Eight. Buoyed by
the Bears' most successful football season since
their 1959 Rose Bowl appearance. Bear backers
predicted that Coach Dick Edwards' cage crew
would have their best year since 1959, when
California won the NCAA basketball title.
But both Stanford and Cal enter today's game
with identical 1-3 Pac-8 records and it's safe to say
that free throws haven't completely replaced free
speech, love, etc. in Berkeley this year.
The two squads both beat non-league oppo
nents on Wednesday night, Cal downing Santa
Clara 75-68 and Stanford beating UC-Davis 91-76.
And they both won their first Pac-8 games last
weekend in Los Angeles against USC. The Cards
beat the Trojans 86-75, while the Bears outlasted
USC 81-80. And of course, both fell victim to
UCLA in Pauley Pavilion, although Stanford did
manage to come within one point of snapping the
Bruins' 91-game home winning streak.

Stanford's Los Angeles showing was sparked
by 6-foot-6 forward George Schader. The junior
transfer from Mt. Antonio College scored 41
points *and pulled down 31 rebounds in the two
games. His 17 boards against the Bruins were
more than the entire starting IJCLA front line
grabbed all night and helped the Cards widen
their Pac-8 rebounding leadership.
His performance earned him Pac-8 Player of the
Week honors. But Wednesday, against Davis,
Schader scored only four points and pulled down
five rebounds in 23 minutes of play. He missed
practice early this week with a bruised knee.
Schader will probably be at full strength today
against the Bears, but Coach Dick Dißiaso may
have another problem. Sophomore guard Jay Car
ter, who scored 14 points in Stanford's win over
USC, wasn't even in uniform Wednesday night.
Garter has been sidelined with tendonitis and may
not see action today.
Dißiaso may use freshman guard Paul Giovac
