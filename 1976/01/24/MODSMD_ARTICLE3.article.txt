This was supposed to be the year that Berkeley
became the capital of the Pacific Eight. Buoyed by
the Bears' most successful football season since
their 1959 Rose Bowl appearance. Bear backers
predicted that Coach Dick Edwards' cage crew
would have their best year since 1959, when
California won the NCAA basketball title.
But both Stanford and Cal enter today's game
with identical 1-3 Pac-8 records and it's safe to say
that free throws haven't completely replaced free
speech, love, etc. in Berkeley this year.
The two squads both beat non-league oppo
nents on Wednesday night, Cal downing Santa
Clara 75-68 and Stanford beating UC-Davis 91-76.
And they both won their first Pac-8 games last
weekend in Los Angeles against USC. The Cards
beat the Trojans 86-75, while the Bears outlasted
USC 81-80. And of course, both fell victim to
UCLA in Pauley Pavilion, although Stanford did
manage to come within one point of snapping the
Bruins' 91-game home winning streak.

Stanford's Los Angeles showing was sparked
by 6-foot-6 forward George Schader. The junior
transfer from Mt. Antonio College scored 41
points *and pulled down 31 rebounds in the two
games. His 17 boards against the Bruins were
more than the entire starting IJCLA front line
grabbed all night and helped the Cards widen
their Pac-8 rebounding leadership.
His performance earned him Pac-8 Player of the
Week honors. But Wednesday, against Davis,
Schader scored only four points and pulled down
five rebounds in 23 minutes of play. He missed
practice early this week with a bruised knee.
Schader will probably be at full strength today
against the Bears, but Coach Dick Dißiaso may
have another problem. Sophomore guard Jay Car
ter, who scored 14 points in Stanford's win over
USC, wasn't even in uniform Wednesday night.
Garter has been sidelined with tendonitis and may
not see action today.
Dißiaso may use freshman guard Paul Giovac
chini and transfer forward Jeff McHugh a lot to
day. Giovacchini, last year's prep MVP in Utah,
came off the bench to score 11 points against the
Aggies. McHugh grabbed 11 rebounds and added
five assists against Davis.
"Giovacchini got his confidence back against
Davis," said Dißiaso. "He'll probably see a lot of
action from now on." And the same should go for
McHugh, who scored nine points against USC a
week ago and has now looked very good in com
ing off the bench in his last two games.
The Cards have been getting good perfor
mances all year from team captain, senior forward
Ed Schweitzer and junior guard Mike Bratz.
Schweitzer and Bratz paced Stanford against
Davis with 22 and 20 points respectively.
"I was impressed with the smooth work of Bratz
and Schweitzer," Dißiaso said Wednesday night.
"We're ready to play Cal now. This game (Davis)
adds to it. We've put three good games in a row."
Davis Coach Bob Hamilton, whose Aggies lost
to Cal 72-62 earlier this year, made a few compari
sons. "Stanford shoots a lot better from the out
side, but Cal was faster. It's going to be one hell of
a battle," said Hamilton.
Some cage observers have said that the Bears
are a good "street" club, meaning that they have

little discipline. Hamilton disagreed. "Cal's a very
disciplined ball club,"he said. "They work the
ball around. The're not race horses."
The Bear lineup is almost the same which
Maples fans have seen for the past couple of years.
The almost is 5-9 freshman guard Gene Ransom,
Cal's second leading scorer, with a 12.2 average.
Ransom scored 12 points in the second half of the
UCLA game to keep the Bears from being blown
out of Pauley in their 80-71 loss last Saturday.
Cal's leading scorer is 6-8 forward Carl Bird,
who averages 14.9 points along with his 5.4 re
bounds per contest. Bird hit 20 points in the Bears'
win over Santa Clara Wednesday night.
And then there's Rickie Hawthorne, who only
seems to have been in Berkeley as long as the
Campanile. Hawthorne, a 6-3 guard leads the
Bears in assists with 39. He's also their third lead
ing scorer with a 12.1 average.
"Cal played two very good games in Los
Angeles last weekend," said Dißiaso. "They have
good size, speed and quickness. Each of their
players has excellent one-on-one ability."
But the game is played five-on-five, and on that
basis the teams stack up pretty evenly. Cal, now
8-6 and coming off two wins over Stanford last
year, has more experience, but the young Cards
(6-9) seem to be improving each game.
UC-Davis' Hamilton made what seems to be a
wise decision when asked to pick a winner. "I'll
tell you who I think will win after I watch it on
television," he said.

Bruins' 91-game home winning streak.

Stanford's Los Angeles showing was sparked
by 6-foot-6 forward George Schader. The junior
transfer from Mt. Antonio College scored 41
points *and pulled down 31 rebounds in the two
games. His 17 boards against the Bruins were
more than the entire starting IJCLA front line
grabbed all night and helped the Cards widen
their Pac-8 rebounding leadership.
His performance earned him Pac-8 Player of the
Week honors. But Wednesday, against Davis,
Schader scored only four points and pulled down
five rebounds in 23 minutes of play. He missed
practice early this week with a bruised knee.
Schader will probably be at full strength today
against the Bears, but Coach Dick Dißiaso may
have another problem. Sophomore guard Jay Car
ter, who scored 14 points in Stanford's win over
USC, wasn't even in uniform Wednesday night.
Garter has been sidelined with tendonitis and may
not see action today.
Dißiaso may use freshman guard Paul Giovac
chini and transfer forward Jeff McHugh a lot to
day. Giovacchini, last year's prep MVP in Utah,
came off the bench to score 11 points against the
Aggies. McHugh grabbed 11 rebounds and added
five assists against Davis.
"Giovacchini got his confidence back against
Davis," said Dißiaso. "He'll probably see a lot of
action from now on." And the same should go for
McHugh, who scored nine points against USC a
week ago and has now looked very good in com
ing off the bench in his last two games.
The Cards have been getting good perfor
mances all year from team captain, senior forward
Ed Schweitzer and junior guard Mike Bratz.
Schweitzer and Bratz paced Stanford against
Davis with 22 and 20 points respectively.
"I was impressed with the smooth work of Bratz
and Schweitzer," Dißiaso said Wednesday night.
"We're ready to play Cal now. This game (Davis)
adds to it. We've put three good games in a row."
Davis Coach Bob Hamilton, whose Aggies lost
to Cal 72-62 earlier this year, made a few compari
sons. "Stanford shoots a lot better from the out
side, but Cal was faster. It's going to be one hell of
a battle," said Hamilton.
Some cage observers have said that the Bears
are a good "street" club, meaning that they have

little discipline. Hamilton disagreed. "Cal's a very
disciplined ball club,"he said. "They work the
ball around. The're not race horses."
The Bear lineup is almost the same which
Maples fans have seen for the past couple of years.
The almost is 5-9 freshman guard Gene Ransom,
Cal's second leading scorer, with a 12.2 average.
Ransom scored 12 points in the second half of the
UCLA game to keep the Bears from being blown
out of Pauley in their 80-71 loss last Saturday.
Cal's leading scorer is 6-8 forward Carl Bird,
who averages 14.9 points along with his 5.4 re
bounds per contest. Bird hit 20 points in the Bears'
win over Santa Clara Wednesday night.
And then there's Rickie Hawthorne, who only
seems to have been in Berkeley as long as the
Campanile. Hawthorne, a 6-3 guard leads the
Bears in assists with 39. He's also their third lead
ing scorer with a 12.1 average.
"Cal played two very good games in Los
Angeles last weekend," said Dißiaso. "They have
good size, speed and quickness. Each of their
players has excellent one-on-one ability."
But the game is played five-on-five, and on that
basis the teams stack up pretty evenly. Cal, now
8-6 and coming off two wins over Stanford last
year, has more experience, but the young Cards
(6-9) seem to be improving each game.
UC-Davis' Hamilton made what seems to be a
wise decision when asked to pick a winner. "I'll
tell you who I think will win after I watch it on
television," he said.
This was supposed to be the year that Berkeley
became the capital of the Pacific Eight. Buoyed by
the Bears' most successful football season since
their 1959 Rose Bowl appearance. Bear backers
predicted that Coach Dick Edwards' cage crew
would have their best year since 1959, when
California won the NCAA basketball title.
But both Stanford and Cal enter today's game
with identical 1-3 Pac-8 records and it's safe to say
that free throws haven't completely replaced free
speech, love, etc. in Berkeley this year.
The two squads both beat non-league oppo
nents on Wednesday night, Cal downing Santa
Clara 75-68 and Stanford beating UC-Davis 91-76.
And they both won their first Pac-8 games last
weekend in Los Angeles against USC. The Cards
beat the Trojans 86-75, while the Bears outlasted
USC 81-80. And of course, both fell victim to
UCLA in Pauley Pavilion, although Stanford did
manage to come within one point of snapping the
Bruins' 91-game home winning streak.

chini and transfer forward Jeff McHugh a lot to
day. Giovacchini, last year's prep MVP in Utah,
came off the bench to score 11 points against the
Aggies. McHugh grabbed 11 rebounds and added
five assists against Davis.
"Giovacchini got his confidence back against
Davis," said Dißiaso. "He'll probably see a lot of
action from now on." And the same should go for
McHugh, who scored nine points against USC a
week ago and has now looked very good in com
ing off the bench in his last two games.
The Cards have been getting good perfor
mances all year from team captain, senior forward
Ed Schweitzer and junior guard Mike Bratz.
Schweitzer and Bratz paced Stanford against
Davis with 22 and 20 points respectively.
"I was impressed with the smooth work of Bratz
and Schweitzer," Dißiaso said Wednesday night.
"We're ready to play Cal now. This game (Davis)
adds to it. We've put three good games in a row."
Davis Coach Bob Hamilton, whose Aggies lost
to Cal 72-62 earlier this year, made a few compari
sons. "Stanford shoots a lot better from the out
side, but Cal was faster. It's going to be one hell of
a battle," said Hamilton.
Some cage observers have said that the Bears
are a good "street" club, meaning that they have

little discipline. Hamilton disagreed. "Cal's a very
disciplined ball club,"he said. "They work the
ball around. The're not race horses."
The Bear lineup is almost the same which
Maples fans have seen for the past couple of years.
The almost is 5-9 freshman guard Gene Ransom,
Cal's second leading scorer, with a 12.2 average.
Ransom scored 12 points in the second half of the
UCLA game to keep the Bears from being blown
out of Pauley in their 80-71 loss last Saturday.
Cal's leading scorer is 6-8 forward Carl Bird,
who averages 14.9 points along with his 5.4 re
bounds per contest. Bird hit 20 points in the Bears'
win over Santa Clara Wednesday night.
And then there's Rickie Hawthorne, who only
seems to have been in Berkeley as long as the
Campanile. Hawthorne, a 6-3 guard leads the
Bears in assists with 39. He's also their third lead
ing scorer with a 12.1 average.
"Cal played two very good games in Los
Angeles last weekend," said Dißiaso. "They have
good size, speed and quickness. Each of their
players has excellent one-on-one ability."
But the game is played five-on-five, and on that
basis the teams stack up pretty evenly. Cal, now
8-6 and coming off two wins over Stanford last
year, has more experience, but the young Cards
(6-9) seem to be improving each game.
UC-Davis' Hamilton made what seems to be a
wise decision when asked to pick a winner. "I'll
tell you who I think will win after I watch it on
television," he said.
This was supposed to be the year that Berkeley
became the capital of the Pacific Eight. Buoyed by
the Bears' most successful football season since
their 1959 Rose Bowl appearance. Bear backers
predicted that Coach Dick Edwards' cage crew
would have their best year since 1959, when
California won the NCAA basketball title.
But both Stanford and Cal enter today's game
with identical 1-3 Pac-8 records and it's safe to say
that free throws haven't completely replaced free
speech, love, etc. in Berkeley this year.
The two squads both beat non-league oppo
nents on Wednesday night, Cal downing Santa
Clara 75-68 and Stanford beating UC-Davis 91-76.
And they both won their first Pac-8 games last
weekend in Los Angeles against USC. The Cards
beat the Trojans 86-75, while the Bears outlasted
USC 81-80. And of course, both fell victim to
UCLA in Pauley Pavilion, although Stanford did
manage to come within one point of snapping the
Bruins' 91-game home winning streak.

Stanford's Los Angeles showing was sparked
by 6-foot-6 forward George Schader. The junior
transfer from Mt. Antonio College scored 41
points *and pulled down 31 rebounds in the two
games. His 17 boards against the Bruins were
more than the entire starting IJCLA front line
grabbed all night and helped the Cards widen
their Pac-8 rebounding leadership.
His performance earned him Pac-8 Player of the
Week honors. But Wednesday, against Davis,
Schader scored only four points and pulled down
five rebounds in 23 minutes of play. He missed
practice early this week with a bruised knee.
Schader will probably be at full strength today
against the Bears, but Coach Dick Dißiaso may
have another problem. Sophomore guard Jay Car
ter, who scored 14 points in Stanford's win over
USC, wasn't even in uniform Wednesday night.
Garter has been sidelined with tendonitis and may
not see action today.
Dißiaso may use freshman guard Paul Giovac
chini and transfer forward Jeff McHugh a lot to
day. Giovacchini, last year's prep MVP in Utah,
came off the bench to score 11 points against the
Aggies. McHugh grabbed 11 rebounds and added
five assists against Davis.
