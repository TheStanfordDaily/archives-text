# Stanford sub stars in south
## McHugh goes home 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
The burning desire of any self
respecting basketball player from
southern California should be to
play for the Los Angeles Lakers,
right? Not according to Stanford
sophomore Jeff McHugh, who
says,"The ultimate would be to
do the P.A. (public address) for the
Lakers."
Unconventional?
Yes. In the first place, if he's a
self-respecting souther California
basketball player, why isn't he
playing for UCLA? "Because the
big thrill is playing against them,"
responds McHugh.
If so, last weekend's Los
Angeles double-header must have
been quite a thrill. The 6-foot-8,
215 pound McHugh didn't play in
Bruin Nirvana (Pauley Pavilion)
Friday night, but when he got in
against USC the next night he
turned it on, hitting three for four
from both the field and the foul
line, for nine points.
"George (Schader) and I, being
from southern California, always
heard that UCLA was it. And there
we were, out on the court with
them," said McHugh of last
weekend's encounter with the
Bruins.
McHugh acknowledged that the
presence of about 30 friends and

all of his high school coaches at
the USC game was an added moti
vation.

McHugh's play against the Tro
jans must have evoked memories
from his old coaches of when Jeff
led Millikan High to the GIF
Southern Section Finals two years
ago and was named to the All-CIF
team.
After graduating from Millikan,
McHugh chose to attend Long
Beach City College rather than a
four-year institution. Last year at
Long Beach he averaged 19.4
points and 9.8 rebounds a game.
McHugh was selected (along with
George Schader) to play on the
California Junior College All-Star
team. The team placed second in
last year's National AAU Basket
ball Championships.
This year McHugh finds him
self in the unaccustomed role of
spending most of his time on the
bench. He anticipates with eager
ness his chances to play and tries
to make the most of them because
"it feels good when you are con
tributing to the team."
Some fans have wondered
about the seemingly arbitrary way
Coach Dick Dißiaso employs
first-line substitutes Mark Fitzner,
Mike Simons and McHugh at the

forwards.
Dißiaso explains that the sub
stitutions are based on a number
of factors: Whether Stanford is
pressing or being pressed; what
sort of defense the opposition in
running; and whether Stanford is
ahead or behind. McHugh be
lieves the coach puts him in for
rebounding, the others in for
quickness and shooting.
Championship coach
Even when he's not on the court
pulling down rebounds, Jeff keeps
in touch with sports. Last year his
sister and some of her high school
friends formed a team, joined a
women's league and asked Jeff to
coach. He consented, and then
had a great time coaching them to
a tie for first place.
With this enthusiasm for sports,
what will he do when he is
through with school? Jeff believes
he might like working as a corpo
rate lawyer for a sports firm if the
job as public address announcer
isn't open with the Lakers.
However, Jeff has a few years
left before he enters "the real
world," and in the meantime he
will have a few more chances to
take the court and "get jittery" as
he listens to his favorite band play
"All Right Now" or "The William
Tell Overture."
