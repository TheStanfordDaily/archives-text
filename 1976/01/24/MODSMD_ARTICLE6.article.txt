# Cal's Hawthorne running... ...for a fourth term
## 
### GARY COHEN 
Rickie Hawthorne was a second team All-
Conference guard for the third consecutive time
last year. Only Zsa Zsa Gabor's best friend has
been a bridesmaid as often. And should Hawth
orne repeat this year, as it looks like he may, he
will surpass the record of William Jennings
Bryan, a second place finisher for the third time in
1908.
Hawthorne was one of the main reasons for
Cal's 17-9 mark last year, its best record in 15
seasons. Yet, when tournament time came around
the Bears were left in Berkeley. Some parties sim
ply require a written invitation, and neither the
N.I.T. nor the Commissioner's Tournament saved
one for Cal.
Hawthorne is still upset at this oversight. "We
got screwed out of it,"he says. "We beat Oregon
twice and finished ahead of them, too. But I guess
with (Oregon Coach Dick) Harter being from the
East and all, they were a better draw for the N.1.T."
Wait 'til next year
It seemed only natural that this would be Cal's
year, with all the Golden Bears back, and two hot
new Cubs in tow. Hawthorne was out to prove that
you don't have to wear eyeglasses to be a Cal
superstar. However, the Bears have spent a good
deal of this season in hibernation and are now
only 8-6.
Hawthorne points to the rebounding and
blames the team as a whole. "In the Washington
game we got out rebounded by one in the first
half," he says,"and we were down by one point.
In the second half we got outrebounded by 15 and
we ended up losing the game by 20 points."
"We're just not playing at the same level all the
time. It is hard to say, but we sometimes lack
intensity."
Surprisingly. Hawthorne says he's not vet dis
appointed. "We have only played half of our
games and four of our league games," lie points
out. "Anything can still happen."

Maybe, but even so this year does not hold
much promise for the 6-foot-3 senior from Los
Angeles. At least not in terms of playing in a
post-season tournament. To get invited this year
Cal will need some divine assistance and no one is
offering any. The Bill Graham of the Bay Area only
sells tickets to concerts — not to heaven, or to
NCAA tournaments.
Pro prospects
Hawthorne's basketball future is now very
much up in the air. He has a realistic approach to
the pros. "It is up to them. If they want to draft me,
I'll see what happens. I guess everybody dreams of
playing pro," he says, "but not everybody is going
to make it. I think my game is suited to it though,
because there are more open-court situations."
Should Hawthorne make it professionally, he
would be yet another of the Bear guards who have
made good. Phil Chenier and Charlie Johnson are
two in a long list. Sometimes it seems like there
are more good guards from Berkeley than from the
Burns Security Agency, and freshman Gene Ran
som may prove to be yet another. Hawthorne en
joys playing with the "Machine," despite the fact
that he's now scoring less.
"I'm only taking 10 shots a game," Hawthorne
says. "How could I score more than I am? Gene
helps me spread the defense, so nobody can con
centrate on either of us." This includes the Stan
ford Cardinals, today's opponents.
Hawthorne knows both Jay Carter and Wolfe
Perry personally, but has never met Mike Bratz.
He saw them all on television though, when both
Cal and Stanford were in Los Angeles, and says he
was very impressed.
"They were really good, and they could have
won the UCLA game," he says. "They just
couldn't capitalize when they needed to. That
new coach, DiBiaso, must be doing a great job."
So, for that matter is Rick Hawthorne, and for the
fourth year in a row.

one for Cal.
Hawthorne is still upset at this oversight. "We
got screwed out of it,"he says. "We beat Oregon
twice and finished ahead of them, too. But I guess
with (Oregon Coach Dick) Harter being from the
East and all, they were a better draw for the N.1.T."
Wait 'til next year
It seemed only natural that this would be Cal's
year, with all the Golden Bears back, and two hot
new Cubs in tow. Hawthorne was out to prove that
you don't have to wear eyeglasses to be a Cal
superstar. However, the Bears have spent a good
deal of this season in hibernation and are now
only 8-6.
Hawthorne points to the rebounding and
blames the team as a whole. "In the Washington
game we got out rebounded by one in the first
half," he says,"and we were down by one point.
In the second half we got outrebounded by 15 and
we ended up losing the game by 20 points."
"We're just not playing at the same level all the
time. It is hard to say, but we sometimes lack
intensity."
Surprisingly. Hawthorne says he's not vet dis
appointed. "We have only played half of our
games and four of our league games," lie points
out. "Anything can still happen."

Maybe, but even so this year does not hold
much promise for the 6-foot-3 senior from Los
Angeles. At least not in terms of playing in a
post-season tournament. To get invited this year
Cal will need some divine assistance and no one is
offering any. The Bill Graham of the Bay Area only
sells tickets to concerts — not to heaven, or to
NCAA tournaments.
Pro prospects
Hawthorne's basketball future is now very
much up in the air. He has a realistic approach to
the pros. "It is up to them. If they want to draft me,
I'll see what happens. I guess everybody dreams of
playing pro," he says, "but not everybody is going
to make it. I think my game is suited to it though,
because there are more open-court situations."
Should Hawthorne make it professionally, he
would be yet another of the Bear guards who have
made good. Phil Chenier and Charlie Johnson are
two in a long list. Sometimes it seems like there
are more good guards from Berkeley than from the
Burns Security Agency, and freshman Gene Ran
som may prove to be yet another. Hawthorne en
joys playing with the "Machine," despite the fact
that he's now scoring less.
"I'm only taking 10 shots a game," Hawthorne
says. "How could I score more than I am? Gene
helps me spread the defense, so nobody can con
centrate on either of us." This includes the Stan
ford Cardinals, today's opponents.
Hawthorne knows both Jay Carter and Wolfe
Perry personally, but has never met Mike Bratz.
He saw them all on television though, when both
Cal and Stanford were in Los Angeles, and says he
was very impressed.
"They were really good, and they could have
won the UCLA game," he says. "They just
couldn't capitalize when they needed to. That
new coach, DiBiaso, must be doing a great job."
So, for that matter is Rick Hawthorne, and for the
fourth year in a row.
Rickie Hawthorne was a second team All-
Conference guard for the third consecutive time
last year. Only Zsa Zsa Gabor's best friend has
been a bridesmaid as often. And should Hawth
orne repeat this year, as it looks like he may, he
will surpass the record of William Jennings
Bryan, a second place finisher for the third time in
1908.
Hawthorne was one of the main reasons for
Cal's 17-9 mark last year, its best record in 15
seasons. Yet, when tournament time came around
the Bears were left in Berkeley. Some parties sim
ply require a written invitation, and neither the
N.I.T. nor the Commissioner's Tournament saved
one for Cal.
