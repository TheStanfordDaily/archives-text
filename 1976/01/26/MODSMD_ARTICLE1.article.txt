# Survey indicates Middle East a 'divisive issue' among profs
## 
### GEOFFREY SAMUELS 
The tension in the Middle East is
"perhaps the most potentially divisive
political issue among faculty mem
bers," according to a recent survey
conducted by professors Everett Carll
I,add Jr. of the University of
Connecticut-Storrs and Seymour Mar
tin Lipset, a senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution.
The poll, published in theChronicle
of Higher Education, randomly sam
pled over3ooo professors in a represen
tative cross-section of colleges and
universities. It reveals that 57 percent
of professors place their sympathies
with Israel, while only eight percent
support the Arab cause. The remaining
34 percent declined to choose.
Jewish professors are decidedly
more favorable to Israel. Sixty percent
believe the U.S. should leave the IJ.N.
if Israel is ejected, whereas only 30
percent of the non-Jewish professors
agree to this response.
Three-quarters of the Jewish profes
sors disagree with the U.S. pressuring
Israel to accede to more Arab demands,
while 47 percent of the non-Jews give
the same reply.

The potential lor conflict arises from
the placement of Jewish faculty mem
bers. Although only 10 percent of the
American faculty are Jewish, "Jewish
professors are more likely to be found
at major universities," according to
Ladd and Lipset.
However, non-Jewish liberals at
major universities are less sympathetic
to Israel than any other portion of the
academic spectrum, the study finds.
"Thus," said Ladd and Lipset, "while
the vast majority of Jewish professors,
whether liberal or conservative, are in
tensely concerned with Israel's survi
val, they are located at institutions
where the strongest questioning of
support for Israel is emerging."
Ladd and Lipset predict that,
"Should future political events
threaten the survival of Israel or press
the U.S. to become more directly in
volved as a participant in the Middle
East conflict, one can imagine a cam
pus so sharply divided on these issues
that the conflicts of the late 1960s will
appear as relatively peaceful in com
parison."
Israeli reaction
Support for Israel rises when the Is
raeli response to alleged Arab aggres

sion is questioned. Seventy-six per
cent deny the Arab claim, promoted in
the United Nations, that Israel is a "ra
cist and imperialist country." Sixty
five percent condone Israeli reprisals
after Arab guerrillas engage in acts of
terrorism, while only 13 percent be
lieve that guerrilla attacks are justified
because there is no other way to attract
world attention.
The current U.S. policy of supplying
Israel with weapons and military
equipment is favored by 73 percent
and 58 percent do not want military
sales to Saudi Arabia.
But the professors refused to ap
prove an active military participation
in the Middle East by the United
States.
Ladd and Lipset said, ". . . the image
of an intensely pro-Israeli academe is
countered by the unwillingness of a
majority of faculty members to have
the U.S. do any more to aid Israel than
send it arms and equipment."
U.S. intervention
Only 31 percent believe if the exis
tence of Israel were threatened the U.S.
should intervene with troops or air
support. Furthermore, almost half
deny the "U.S. has an unquestioned

moral obligation to prevent the de
struction of the state of Israel."
Ladd and Lipset cited the
. . strong isolationist and anti-war
sentiments of the post-Vietnam era" as
factors leading professors .. to op
pose any direct military intervention
to avoid the 'defeat and destruction' of
Israel."
Concerning the question of Ameri
can policy toward the Middle East as a
whole, 64 percent believe the U.S.
should follow a more neutral policy.
Specifically, half believed the U.S.
should exert pressure on Israel toward
agreement to more Arab demands.
Some six percent opined that Israel
should return most of the territory
gained in the Six-Day War.
Sixty-four percent believed that a
separate state of Palestine should be
created on the west bank of the Jordan
river.
"Almost all matters of policy are
more complicated than is suggested by
the replies to any one or two ques
tions," the surveyors said. "People are
rarely unqualifiedly racist or not, lib
eral or consevative, isolationist or in
terventionist, pro-Israeli or pro-Arab."

PROFS TAKE SIDES — Seymour Lipset (above), a Sr. fellow at Hoover Institu-
tion, and his colleague found in their survey a noticeable division between
pro-Israeli (and mostly Jewish) and moderate (non-Jewish) professors concerning
the Mid-East conflict.
