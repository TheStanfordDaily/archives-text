# SALT talks should be continued
## 
### Seth Fine 
The danger of nuclear war is
one of the most pressing of the
world's current problems. No
thing else involves the risk that
in one hour, the world we know
could be destroyed.
The Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks (SALT) are the major cur
rent effort to confront this prob
lem. Yet, the two agreements the
talks have produced have been
attacked on the grounds they
give the Russian nuclear
superiority.
Not only is this not true, but it
would not matter even if it were.
Strategic nuclear weapons can
be used against two kinds of
targets — population centers or
missile silos. They can be
counted in four ways — by
number of launchers, number of
warheads, megatonnage or let
hality.
Meaningless figure
Number of launchers is a
meaningless figure, because a
missile launcher by itself de
stroys nothing. Targets are de
stroyed by the explosive power
of the warheads.
However, since the effects of a

nuclear explosion decrease with
distance from it, a larger total
area will be destroyed if a given
megatonnageis split into several
warheads and used against sev
eral areas.
Consequently, number of
warheads is a better measure
than megatonnage of effective
ness against population centers.
For measuring effectiveness
against silos, thebest indicator is
the lethality, which takes into
account the number of
warheads, the megatonnage and
the accuracy, and indicates the
probability the silo can be de
stroyed. In this respect, the Un
ited States is at a large advantage
because its missiles are more ac
curate.
Examination of agreement
Let us now examine the SALT
agreements in light of these
measurements.
The SALT I agreement leaves
the United States with a five-to
one advantage in both number of
warheads and lethality. If both
sides expand their forces to the
limit allowed under the SALT II
agreement, the United States

would retain a three-to-one ad
vantage in number of warheads
and a two-to-one advantage in
lethality.
And this decrease in Ameri
can superiority is not even due to
the agreement. Rather, it is be
cause the Russians are now be
ginning to deploy multiple
warhead missiles, which the
United States already has.
One must still ask what good
is this advantage.
It has been estimated that on
the first day of a major nuclear
war, 50 percent of the popula
tion of both the United States
and the Soviet Union would die.
Many more would die thereafter
due to injuries, starvation and
disease.
Hardly change
Use of even several thousand
more warheads would hardly
change these figures, since once
the major population centers are
destroyed the surviving people
would be too scattered to be at
tacked effectively.
Some people have argued that
as no one could win a nuclear
war no one would start one. To
refute this, it is only necessary to

remember recent American
threats to use nuclear weapons
in the event of a Communist in
vasion of Western Europe or
South Korea.
There is no escaping every day
that passes involves some possi
bility of nuclear war. Given
enough time, these possibilities
will add up to a certainty.
In the long run, there is only
one way to prevent this: by com
plete nuclear disarmament.
Limit number
The SALT agreements are not
disarmament by any means, but
they do put a limit on the
number of weapons. This is a
vital first step.
To achieve disarmament as an
ultimate goal, the SALT talks
must be vigorously pursued.
It may happen the Russians
will attempt to gain political ad
vantage from the process of dis
armament. The United States
cannot permit this short
sightedness to sway it.
Temporary political advan
tage must yield to the blunt
necessity of survival.
