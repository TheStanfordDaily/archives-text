# Shah still oppressing masses
## 
### Marq-Rarshah 
The Associated Press (AP) re
ported on Dec. 31,1975, that "an
Iranian military tribunal has sen
tenced 10 Marxist guerrillas to
death by firing squad." AP also
reported the Shah's regime has
accused this group of annihilat
ing three American colonels and
some SAVAK (Iran's ClA
trained Gestapo-type secret
police) agents.
This is not the first time the
Shah has attempted to deceive
and misdirect world public
opinion. The Shah has tortured,
killed and mutilated thousands
of Iranians striving for a democ
ratic government, under differ
ent demagogic slanders against
the Iranian people.
This time the Shah had to
come forward under a guise of
fighting "terrorism" in order to
justify his vicious plots against
the Iranians fighting for their
freedom.
Shah's claims
The Shah is claiming that the
group to be executed is a "ter
rorist gang" and that he is the
savior of the people's lives and
property against acts of ter
rorism. The Shah can use any
demogagic slander he desires,
but nothing can brush aside
these facts:
—It was the CIA that staged a
coup in 1953 to reinstate the
Shah, thereby overthrowing the
democratic government of
Mosadegh (a fact admitted by
Nixon while President). Several
hundred patriots were shot in
the aftermath.
—It was the Shah who gave
the shoot-to-kill order in June
1963 that resulted in the mas
sacre of 15,000 Iranian people;
—It is the U.S.-backed Shah
who has imprisoned over4o,ooo
political prisoners in his
medieval dungeons;
—It is because of U.S. support
of the Shah's reign of terror that
"since 1971 more than 200 Ira
nian patriots have died at the
hands of the Shah's execution
squads," according to News
week. Hundreds have also been
tortured to death in his prisons.
These are but a few examples.
Direct consequences
The misery, destitution and
poverty the Iranian people face
today are direct consequences of
the plunder of human and
natural resources by the United
States and other imperialist
powers. And the tool for such a

plunder is the Shah's reign of
terror.
The United States is arming
the Shah's regime to its teeth and
sending over 18,000 American
military advisors and CIA agents
to Iran, under the guise of
"businessmen" or "officials," to
ensure the Shah's continued fas
cist rule in Iran.
Surely Ameican "advisors"
(i.e. the CIA network) are not va
cationing in Iran; rather, they are
making sure the Shah's reign of
terror continues smoothly and
with minimal setbacks. They are
not there to help Iranian people,
but to consolidate the Shah's
rule.
These "advisors" in Iran are
for "peace" just as similar agents
were in Vietam.
It is natural Iranian people,
faced with terror, political rep
ression and the sell-out of their
independence by the Shah's re-

gime, are compelled to resort to
armed struggle to achieve free
dom — just as the Vietnamese
people did.
Historical slanders
History remembers the slan
ders propagated by U.S. im
perialism in trying to bias the
people against the Vietnamese
independence fighters. But his
tory never dared to call the Viet
namese people fighting for their
independence and democracy,
terrorists.
No one will ever forget the
Nixons, Johnsons and their fas
cist puppets, like the juntas in
Chile and Vietnam which
caused massacre of innocent
people. Because of these actions,
the American intelligence per
sonnel who direct and teach
their SAVAK counterparts in
Iran cannot expect anything but
harassment from the Iranian
people.

Having experienced the con
sequences of American involve
ment in an unjust war of aggres
sion in Southeast Asia, the
American people have become
aware their interests do not lie
with those of Thieu, Lon Nol or
the Shah. Peace-loving Ameri
can people should oppose these
U.S.-Shah conspiracies against
the Iranian people and see them
as attempts to deceive the
American people.
We encourage all progressive
and peace loving people to lend
their support to the Iranian
people in their struggle for
democracy, freedom and inde
pendence. Condemn the Shah's
dictatorial regime and its plot to
execute the group of Iranian
patriots.
