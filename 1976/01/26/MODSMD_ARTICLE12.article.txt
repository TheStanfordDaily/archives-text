# Willow Road widening
## 
### Andrew Doty 
There are a number of points
that should be made in response
to Julia Kringel's "Willow Road"
column in the Jan. 21 Daily.
A major and long-standing
problem exists in the Willow
Road area because of the mixture
of local and through traffic, the
poor access to important centers
of activity (the Medical Center,
Professional Center, Shopping
Center, Children's Hospital and
Oak Creek Apartments) and the
possible future use of a 45-acre
parcel west of the Children's
Hospital for housing.
Willow Road was 50 percent
overloaded in 1970, and the
congestion has since worsened.
John Blayney of the San Fran
cisco firm of Livingston &
Blayney (the same planners who
advised Palo Alto to hold the
foothills in open space), has
stated: "The access (in the Wil
low Road area) is abominable. I
can't think of any other situation
in the Bay Area where you con
centrate that amount of activity
with such poor access."
Kringel noted Menlo Park will
be "vitally affected" by the pro
ject. That is true, but in a positive
way. The Environmental Impact
Report notes Menlo Park's resi
dential streets will be a major
beneficiary.
Traffic on Willow Road will
increase from 28 percent to 40
percent while traffic will de
crease from 20 percent to 31 per
cent on Oak and Middle Av
enues in Menlo Park, 14 percent
to 30 percent on Santa Cruz , and
1.3 percent to six percent on
Valpariso.
The project Menlo Park voters
rejected in 1971 was the state
sponsored Willow Expressway
proposal, which would have cut
a wide swath through that com
munity as part of a cross-
Peninsula link.
That project has since been
removed from the state's plans.
The present proposal is quite a
different matter: it is a local im
provement project to solve a Palo
Alto problem.
Good planning suggests the
road extension should be sepa
rated from the Shopping Cen
ter's cars, pedestrians and bicy
clists. For that reason the road
will be routed through the trees
north of the Center in much the
same way Campus Drive threads
through the edge of the Ar
boretum.
Each of the 207 trees has been
inventoried by a professional ar
borist. The city staff has been in
structed to take as few good trees
as possible, which would be
eight at the maximum.
As is so often the case in these
matters, the total community
good must be weighed. Which is
worse: the loss of the trees not far
from a 300-acre Arboretum and
across El Camino from a city
park, or the daily back-up of cars
expelling fumes in front of Oak
Creek Apartment windows?
There is even something to be
said for taking steps to help
maintain the economic health of
shopping and professional cen
ters that provide significant in
come for the University's educa
tional programs.

Hospital for housing.
Willow Road was 50 percent
overloaded in 1970, and the
congestion has since worsened.
John Blayney of the San Fran
cisco firm of Livingston &
Blayney (the same planners who
advised Palo Alto to hold the
foothills in open space), has
stated: "The access (in the Wil
low Road area) is abominable. I
can't think of any other situation
in the Bay Area where you con
centrate that amount of activity
with such poor access."
Kringel noted Menlo Park will
be "vitally affected" by the pro
ject. That is true, but in a positive
way. The Environmental Impact
Report notes Menlo Park's resi
dential streets will be a major
beneficiary.
Traffic on Willow Road will
increase from 28 percent to 40
percent while traffic will de
crease from 20 percent to 31 per
cent on Oak and Middle Av
enues in Menlo Park, 14 percent
to 30 percent on Santa Cruz , and
1.3 percent to six percent on
Valpariso.
The project Menlo Park voters
rejected in 1971 was the state
sponsored Willow Expressway
proposal, which would have cut
a wide swath through that com
munity as part of a cross-
Peninsula link.
That project has since been
removed from the state's plans.
The present proposal is quite a
different matter: it is a local im
provement project to solve a Palo
Alto problem.
Good planning suggests the
road extension should be sepa
rated from the Shopping Cen
ter's cars, pedestrians and bicy
clists. For that reason the road
will be routed through the trees
north of the Center in much the
same way Campus Drive threads
through the edge of the Ar
boretum.
Each of the 207 trees has been
inventoried by a professional ar
borist. The city staff has been in
structed to take as few good trees
as possible, which would be
eight at the maximum.
As is so often the case in these
matters, the total community
good must be weighed. Which is
worse: the loss of the trees not far
from a 300-acre Arboretum and
across El Camino from a city
park, or the daily back-up of cars
expelling fumes in front of Oak
Creek Apartment windows?
There is even something to be
said for taking steps to help
maintain the economic health of
shopping and professional cen
ters that provide significant in
come for the University's educa
tional programs.

community relations.)
There are a number of points
that should be made in response
to Julia Kringel's "Willow Road"
column in the Jan. 21 Daily.
A major and long-standing
problem exists in the Willow
Road area because of the mixture
of local and through traffic, the
poor access to important centers
of activity (the Medical Center,
Professional Center, Shopping
Center, Children's Hospital and
Oak Creek Apartments) and the
possible future use of a 45-acre
parcel west of the Children's
Hospital for housing.
