Debate's death

Editor:
Debate at Stanford — or at
most colleges — died years ago
and not last month. The history
of modern debating is a frighten
ing story of a once noble activity
destroyed by the talent of its par
ticipants.
Decades ago, college debate
was a form of "structured ar
gumentation"; students re
searched on a certain topic and
used persuasive speaking
techniques to sway a judge to
their side. The topic was nor
mally vague and open to in
terpretation, and students
learned sincere, persuasive
speaking was the key to success.
Thus, debate served as a train
ing ground for potential politi
cians.
But those finely honed minds
inside the debate room dreamed
up new ways to win: absurd,
obscure arguments; misinter
preted evidence (if not falsified);
and "spreading," a technique
where a debater sprewed out
words as fast as possible to leave
the other team hopelessly baf
fled.
Debate lingo became so com
plex only an experienced deba

ter could follow the rounds.
Rhetorical arguments were re
placed by dead body counts and
financial disasters.
College debate became no
thing more than a training
ground for college coaches.
I participated in high school
forensics for three years, and
many of my friends now in col
lege once debated. Virtually all
have quit debate, not just those
friends at Stanford.
In a university atmosphere,
where the academic, creative
and social opportunities are so
great, most find it stifling to
spend any more time dreaming
up new ways to outtalk, not to
outwit, their opponents. One ac
tually learns the truth isn't im
portant in the debate rooms.
College debate has been
strangling itself to death for a
long time. Unless its format is
radically changed, it would be
far better to let it end here than to
perpetuate its training young
speakers to be cunning, deceitful
and evasive.

Language requirement
Editor:
One of the more reassuring

developments on the current
academic scene is the general
tendency to reintroduce some
structure into the college cur
riculum.
Words that were taboo a few
years ago, like "requirements,"
"grades" and "background" are
now wending their way back
into the vocabulary of adminis
trative circles. One can only re
joice over this much needed
reappraisal and hope the pen
dulum soon swings back to full
restoration of the foreign lan
guage requirement.
For the time being, such a
likelihood still seems remote.
The people who sit in judgment
on curriculum are "divided al
most evenly on a possible lan
guage and/or mathematics re
quirement" (Campus Report,
Jan. 16). As long as such a situa
tion prevails, we will continue to
play havoc with one of the most
structured disciplines in the
traditional curriculum.
We will continue to set false
standards for colleges and high
schools, and witness demise of
the foreign language teacher in
the job market. Inaccurate and
shoddy translations will con
tinue to proliferate in response

to the current boom in interdis
ciplinary courses.
Students will be sent to the
great cultural centers of the
world unable to follow lectures
at the universities. Many will
still be .deprived of one of the
richest cultural experiences —to
savor a great work of foreign lit
erature in the language in which
it was written.
Such proficiency is not
"picked up" when needed, like
an instrument; it involves a
rigorous intellectual discipline
that gradually unfolds from the
basic and essential principles of
grammatic structure. To drop
the first-year requirements is to
jeopardize that structure.
One can only hope those who
guard the curriculum will look
to the need for reform in thisarea,
as they have begun to do
elsewhere.
Otherwise, we will breed
another generation of false
humanists and provincial
Americans. This is hardly
worthy of this great university
we profess to be.
