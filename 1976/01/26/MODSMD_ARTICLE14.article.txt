### 
EDITOR'S NOTE: After fleeing
the country in December 1968
whilefacing prison on charges of
parole violation, Eldridge
Cleaver returned to the U.S. in
November 1975. He now awaits
trial in jail on six counts stem
ming from an April 6, 1968
shootout between members of
the Black Panther Party and
Oakland, Cal., police and on the
parole violation charge. He can
not be released, even on bail,
until (he parole matter is settled.
His next court date is February
10.
OAKLAND, CAL., (Pacific
News Service) — "I'm in the pos
ition of a ghost coming back, and
a lot of people wish I'd just go
away," former Black Panther
Party Minister of Information
Eldridge Cleaver said here in his
first interview since returning
from exile in Paris to face trial in
the U.S.
"A lot of people have turned
their backs on me because of
political positions I've taken,"
Cleaver said. "They say I'm a
traitor; I say that's bullshit."
Cleaver was interviewed twice
by telephone from a holding cell
in the Alameda County jail in
Oakland, where he awaits trail
on three counts of assault to
commit murder and three counts
of assault with a deadly weapon.
Kathleen Cleaver, wife of the
40-year-old former presidential
candidate and author of Soul On
Ice, said in a separate interview
here that "A lot of people came
to the conclusion when they saw
Eldridge come back that he made
some kind of a deal (with police
authorities). They just automati
cally assumed that. No one
seemed to be able to understand
that maybe somebody really
wants to come back so bad that
he'll stand trail."
Eldridge Cleaver said these
suspicions, plus resentment to
ward his 1971 split with the
Black Panther Party and the con
servative elements in his present
politics, have hindered his ef
forts to raise support and funds
for his defense.
The Cleavers have been un
able to hire a topnotch attorney
because none have volunteered
their services, and the Cleavers
cannot afford their asking price.
Black Panther Party lawyer
Charles Garry, according to
Kathleen Cleaver, told her he
would provide back-up help in
the case but is too tied up in a

lengthy prison trial in nearby
Marin County to serve as
Cleaver's chief defense counsel.
"I didn't think it would be this
bad," Cleaver said. "I thought if I
came back people would listen
to me. But it's like they're hiding
from a ghost. '
"I struggle not to feel down.
But when I think that I'm here in
Oakland very near a lot of people
I used to be close to then I don't
know, man, it's not a good feel
ing. I'm in the hands of the op
position and my friends don't
give a damn. It's sad." But he
added: "I don't feel bitterness."
Lonely exile
Why did Cleaver decide to
come back to a country where he
faced a possible prison sentence
of 75 years? "I always wanted to
come back. It seemed from Paris
that the situation had changed
and that I could have my day in
court without the hysterical cli
mate that was here in 1968.
"The Nixon regime was ex
posed and discredited and
Ronald Reagan was no longer
governor. Governor Brown, who
took over, is a progressive per
son, whereas Ronald Reagan is a
repressive person. Also there are
many black people who have
won elective office in this coun
try. And the change has been for
the better."
Kathleen Cleaver stressed the
negative aspects of life in exile.
The Cleavers lived in Cuba,
Algeria and France, and visited
China, North Vietnam and North
Korea. "The things that he did
anticipate finding," she said,
"he never found — support for
the struggle in which he was in
volved in the United States.
"Exile is an endless process,"
she continued. "It's not a prog
ressive life to be in exile — to be
isolated, to be separated, to be
always unable to be really your
self . . . The people that you're
around are not people that are
part of your own culture. Every
thing is twisted around. It's a
process that will wear you out
and wear you down."
Kathleen Cleaver said it was
the repressive atmosphere in the
U.S. in 1968 that caused her
husband to flee. "He felt it was
an alternative to going into San
Quentin and getting his head
blown off," she said. "Consider
ing the case of the San Quentin
Six and what happened to
George Jackson, I don't see how
anyone could fail to understand

why he didn't want to go to San
Quentin."
Recent congressional revela
tions of FBI harassment of the
Black Panther Party will be cen
tral to Eldridge Cleaver's de
fense. "Now everybody knows
that the things they were calling
us paranoid for in 1968 are
true. . . One of the potentials of
my case is that it will allow these
abuses to be more thoroughly
investigated," he said.
New conservatism
Cleaver now describes himself
as "conservative in some re
spects . . . I've found some val
ues in American society I want to
see conserved. I think America is
a beautiful country, but I'm not
abandoning my desire for
change in America.
"We have the freest institu
tions here. That doesn't mean we
have perfect institutions, but it
does have to be taken into ac
count in your approach to
change."
Reflecting back to the decade
in which he was a major political
figure, Cleaver said, "I lookupon
the movement of the '60s- as a
success. We conquered the
minds of the American people.
But I see a failure to consolidate
those victories."
This consolidation should oc
cur, he said, through the elec
toral process and patriotic ac
tion. "I'm ready to stand up in
public and sing the Star Spang
led Banner," he said.
"Movements that have been
successful have not been alien
ated from the people of their
countries. They're patriotic:
They do it in the name of their
fatherland.
"But in the '60s we came ac
ross as an alien fifth column that
was manipulated from abroad.
We need to break away from that
image and continue embracing
our original goals while reem
bracing our patriotism."
Cleaver now favors a strong
military. "We have to recognize
it (a strong military) is necessary
and decide how we want it con
ducted. A world in which the
American military has ceased to
exist is a world in which the Un
ited States is ground under
foot . . . The problem (is) the
kind of orders they're taking."
Confident of acquittal
While waiting for his trial to
begin, Cleaver is trying to get his
parole violation charges drop
ped so that he can be released on

bail. Cleaver served almost 11
years as an inmate and parolee
on a 14-year sentence before fle
eing the country, and claims that
California state law dictates he
has served enough time to drop
the remaining three-year parole
requirement.
If released and ultimately ac
quitted, Cleaver says he will de
vote his time to writing (he has a
manuscript covering the last 10
years of his life), politics and
clothes designing.
And he believes he will be ac
quitted. "I'm confident that I'll
receive a fair trial. I'm not saying
a perfect trial, but a fair trial.
"I will have my day in court
and I will be vindicated."

Cleaver returned to the U.S. in
November 1975. He now awaits
trial in jail on six counts stem
ming from an April 6, 1968

OAKLAND, CAL., (Pacific
News Service) — "I'm in the pos
ition of a ghost coming back, and
a lot of people wish I'd just go
away," former Black Panther
Party Minister of Information
Eldridge Cleaver said here in his
first interview since returning
from exile in Paris to face trial in
the U.S.
"A lot of people have turned
their backs on me because of
political positions I've taken,"
Cleaver said. "They say I'm a
traitor; I say that's bullshit."
Cleaver was interviewed twice
by telephone from a holding cell
in the Alameda County jail in
Oakland, where he awaits trail
on three counts of assault to
commit murder and three counts
of assault with a deadly weapon.
Kathleen Cleaver, wife of the
40-year-old former presidential
candidate and author of Soul On
Ice, said in a separate interview
here that "A lot of people came
to the conclusion when they saw
Eldridge come back that he made
some kind of a deal (with police
authorities). They just automati
cally assumed that. No one
seemed to be able to understand
that maybe somebody really
wants to come back so bad that
he'll stand trail."
Eldridge Cleaver said these
suspicions, plus resentment to
ward his 1971 split with the
Black Panther Party and the con
servative elements in his present
politics, have hindered his ef
forts to raise support and funds
for his defense.
The Cleavers have been un
able to hire a topnotch attorney
because none have volunteered
their services, and the Cleavers
cannot afford their asking price.
Black Panther Party lawyer
Charles Garry, according to
Kathleen Cleaver, told her he
would provide back-up help in
the case but is too tied up in a

lengthy prison trial in nearby
Marin County to serve as
Cleaver's chief defense counsel.
"I didn't think it would be this
bad," Cleaver said. "I thought if I
came back people would listen
to me. But it's like they're hiding
from a ghost. '
"I struggle not to feel down.
But when I think that I'm here in
Oakland very near a lot of people
I used to be close to then I don't
know, man, it's not a good feel
ing. I'm in the hands of the op
position and my friends don't
give a damn. It's sad." But he
added: "I don't feel bitterness."
Lonely exile
Why did Cleaver decide to
come back to a country where he
faced a possible prison sentence
of 75 years? "I always wanted to
come back. It seemed from Paris
that the situation had changed
and that I could have my day in
court without the hysterical cli
mate that was here in 1968.
"The Nixon regime was ex
posed and discredited and
Ronald Reagan was no longer
governor. Governor Brown, who
took over, is a progressive per
son, whereas Ronald Reagan is a
repressive person. Also there are
many black people who have
won elective office in this coun
try. And the change has been for
the better."
Kathleen Cleaver stressed the
negative aspects of life in exile.
The Cleavers lived in Cuba,
Algeria and France, and visited
China, North Vietnam and North
Korea. "The things that he did
anticipate finding," she said,
"he never found — support for
the struggle in which he was in
volved in the United States.
"Exile is an endless process,"
she continued. "It's not a prog
ressive life to be in exile — to be
isolated, to be separated, to be
always unable to be really your
self . . . The people that you're
around are not people that are
part of your own culture. Every
thing is twisted around. It's a
process that will wear you out
and wear you down."
Kathleen Cleaver said it was
the repressive atmosphere in the
U.S. in 1968 that caused her
husband to flee. "He felt it was
an alternative to going into San
Quentin and getting his head
blown off," she said. "Consider
ing the case of the San Quentin
Six and what happened to
George Jackson, I don't see how
anyone could fail to understand

why he didn't want to go to San
Quentin."
Recent congressional revela
tions of FBI harassment of the
Black Panther Party will be cen
tral to Eldridge Cleaver's de
fense. "Now everybody knows
that the things they were calling
us paranoid for in 1968 are
true. . . One of the potentials of
my case is that it will allow these
abuses to be more thoroughly
investigated," he said.
New conservatism
Cleaver now describes himself
as "conservative in some re
spects . . . I've found some val
ues in American society I want to
see conserved. I think America is
a beautiful country, but I'm not
abandoning my desire for
change in America.
"We have the freest institu
tions here. That doesn't mean we
have perfect institutions, but it
does have to be taken into ac
count in your approach to
change."
Reflecting back to the decade
in which he was a major political
figure, Cleaver said, "I lookupon
the movement of the '60s- as a
success. We conquered the
minds of the American people.
But I see a failure to consolidate
those victories."
This consolidation should oc
cur, he said, through the elec
toral process and patriotic ac
tion. "I'm ready to stand up in
public and sing the Star Spang
led Banner," he said.
"Movements that have been
successful have not been alien
ated from the people of their
countries. They're patriotic:
They do it in the name of their
fatherland.
"But in the '60s we came ac
ross as an alien fifth column that
was manipulated from abroad.
We need to break away from that
image and continue embracing
our original goals while reem
bracing our patriotism."
Cleaver now favors a strong
military. "We have to recognize
it (a strong military) is necessary
and decide how we want it con
ducted. A world in which the
American military has ceased to
exist is a world in which the Un
ited States is ground under
foot . . . The problem (is) the
kind of orders they're taking."
Confident of acquittal
While waiting for his trial to
begin, Cleaver is trying to get his
parole violation charges drop
ped so that he can be released on

bail. Cleaver served almost 11
years as an inmate and parolee
on a 14-year sentence before fle
eing the country, and claims that
California state law dictates he
has served enough time to drop
the remaining three-year parole
requirement.
If released and ultimately ac
quitted, Cleaver says he will de
vote his time to writing (he has a
manuscript covering the last 10
years of his life), politics and
clothes designing.
And he believes he will be ac
quitted. "I'm confident that I'll
receive a fair trial. I'm not saying
a perfect trial, but a fair trial.
"I will have my day in court
and I will be vindicated."

November 1975. He now awaits
trial in jail on six counts stem

OAKLAND, CAL., (Pacific
News Service) — "I'm in the pos
ition of a ghost coming back, and
a lot of people wish I'd just go
away," former Black Panther
Party Minister of Information
Eldridge Cleaver said here in his
first interview since returning
from exile in Paris to face trial in
the U.S.
"A lot of people have turned
their backs on me because of
political positions I've taken,"
Cleaver said. "They say I'm a
traitor; I say that's bullshit."
Cleaver was interviewed twice
by telephone from a holding cell
in the Alameda County jail in
Oakland, where he awaits trail
on three counts of assault to
commit murder and three counts
of assault with a deadly weapon.
Kathleen Cleaver, wife of the
40-year-old former presidential
candidate and author of Soul On
Ice, said in a separate interview
here that "A lot of people came
to the conclusion when they saw
Eldridge come back that he made
some kind of a deal (with police
authorities). They just automati
cally assumed that. No one
seemed to be able to understand
that maybe somebody really
wants to come back so bad that
he'll stand trail."
Eldridge Cleaver said these
suspicions, plus resentment to
ward his 1971 split with the
Black Panther Party and the con
servative elements in his present
politics, have hindered his ef
forts to raise support and funds
for his defense.
The Cleavers have been un
able to hire a topnotch attorney
because none have volunteered
their services, and the Cleavers
cannot afford their asking price.
Black Panther Party lawyer
Charles Garry, according to
Kathleen Cleaver, told her he
would provide back-up help in
the case but is too tied up in a

lengthy prison trial in nearby
Marin County to serve as
Cleaver's chief defense counsel.
"I didn't think it would be this
bad," Cleaver said. "I thought if I
came back people would listen
to me. But it's like they're hiding
from a ghost. '
"I struggle not to feel down.
But when I think that I'm here in
Oakland very near a lot of people
I used to be close to then I don't
know, man, it's not a good feel
ing. I'm in the hands of the op
position and my friends don't
give a damn. It's sad." But he
added: "I don't feel bitterness."
Lonely exile
Why did Cleaver decide to
come back to a country where he
faced a possible prison sentence
of 75 years? "I always wanted to
come back. It seemed from Paris
that the situation had changed
and that I could have my day in
court without the hysterical cli
mate that was here in 1968.
"The Nixon regime was ex
posed and discredited and
Ronald Reagan was no longer
governor. Governor Brown, who
took over, is a progressive per
son, whereas Ronald Reagan is a
repressive person. Also there are
many black people who have
won elective office in this coun
try. And the change has been for
the better."
Kathleen Cleaver stressed the
negative aspects of life in exile.
The Cleavers lived in Cuba,
Algeria and France, and visited
China, North Vietnam and North
Korea. "The things that he did
anticipate finding," she said,
"he never found — support for
the struggle in which he was in
volved in the United States.
"Exile is an endless process,"
she continued. "It's not a prog
ressive life to be in exile — to be
isolated, to be separated, to be
always unable to be really your
self . . . The people that you're
around are not people that are
part of your own culture. Every
thing is twisted around. It's a
process that will wear you out
and wear you down."
Kathleen Cleaver said it was
the repressive atmosphere in the
U.S. in 1968 that caused her
husband to flee. "He felt it was
an alternative to going into San
Quentin and getting his head
blown off," she said. "Consider
ing the case of the San Quentin
Six and what happened to
George Jackson, I don't see how
anyone could fail to understand

why he didn't want to go to San
Quentin."
Recent congressional revela
tions of FBI harassment of the
Black Panther Party will be cen
tral to Eldridge Cleaver's de
fense. "Now everybody knows
that the things they were calling
us paranoid for in 1968 are
true. . . One of the potentials of
my case is that it will allow these
abuses to be more thoroughly
investigated," he said.
New conservatism
Cleaver now describes himself
as "conservative in some re
spects . . . I've found some val
ues in American society I want to
see conserved. I think America is
a beautiful country, but I'm not
abandoning my desire for
change in America.
"We have the freest institu
tions here. That doesn't mean we
have perfect institutions, but it
does have to be taken into ac
count in your approach to
change."
Reflecting back to the decade
in which he was a major political
figure, Cleaver said, "I lookupon
the movement of the '60s- as a
success. We conquered the
minds of the American people.
But I see a failure to consolidate
those victories."
This consolidation should oc
cur, he said, through the elec
toral process and patriotic ac
tion. "I'm ready to stand up in
public and sing the Star Spang
led Banner," he said.
"Movements that have been
successful have not been alien
ated from the people of their
countries. They're patriotic:
They do it in the name of their
fatherland.
"But in the '60s we came ac
ross as an alien fifth column that
was manipulated from abroad.
We need to break away from that
image and continue embracing
our original goals while reem
bracing our patriotism."
Cleaver now favors a strong
military. "We have to recognize
it (a strong military) is necessary
and decide how we want it con
ducted. A world in which the
American military has ceased to
exist is a world in which the Un
ited States is ground under
foot . . . The problem (is) the
kind of orders they're taking."
Confident of acquittal
While waiting for his trial to
begin, Cleaver is trying to get his
parole violation charges drop
ped so that he can be released on

bail. Cleaver served almost 11
years as an inmate and parolee
on a 14-year sentence before fle
eing the country, and claims that
California state law dictates he
has served enough time to drop
the remaining three-year parole
requirement.
If released and ultimately ac
quitted, Cleaver says he will de
vote his time to writing (he has a
manuscript covering the last 10
years of his life), politics and
clothes designing.
And he believes he will be ac
quitted. "I'm confident that I'll
receive a fair trial. I'm not saying
a perfect trial, but a fair trial.
"I will have my day in court
and I will be vindicated."

November 1975. He now awaits
trial in jail on six counts stem
ming from an April 6, 1968
shootout between members of
the Black Panther Party and
Oakland, Cal., police and on the
parole violation charge. He can
not be released, even on bail,
until (he parole matter is settled.
His next court date is February

OAKLAND, CAL., (Pacific
News Service) — "I'm in the pos
ition of a ghost coming back, and
a lot of people wish I'd just go
away," former Black Panther
Party Minister of Information
Eldridge Cleaver said here in his
first interview since returning
from exile in Paris to face trial in
the U.S.
"A lot of people have turned
their backs on me because of
political positions I've taken,"
Cleaver said. "They say I'm a
traitor; I say that's bullshit."
Cleaver was interviewed twice
by telephone from a holding cell
in the Alameda County jail in
Oakland, where he awaits trail
on three counts of assault to
commit murder and three counts
of assault with a deadly weapon.
Kathleen Cleaver, wife of the
40-year-old former presidential
candidate and author of Soul On
Ice, said in a separate interview
here that "A lot of people came
to the conclusion when they saw
Eldridge come back that he made
some kind of a deal (with police
authorities). They just automati
cally assumed that. No one
seemed to be able to understand
that maybe somebody really
wants to come back so bad that
he'll stand trail."
Eldridge Cleaver said these
suspicions, plus resentment to
ward his 1971 split with the
Black Panther Party and the con
servative elements in his present
politics, have hindered his ef
forts to raise support and funds
for his defense.
The Cleavers have been un
able to hire a topnotch attorney
because none have volunteered
their services, and the Cleavers
cannot afford their asking price.
Black Panther Party lawyer
Charles Garry, according to
Kathleen Cleaver, told her he
would provide back-up help in
the case but is too tied up in a

lengthy prison trial in nearby
Marin County to serve as
Cleaver's chief defense counsel.
"I didn't think it would be this
bad," Cleaver said. "I thought if I
came back people would listen
to me. But it's like they're hiding
from a ghost. '
"I struggle not to feel down.
But when I think that I'm here in
Oakland very near a lot of people
I used to be close to then I don't
know, man, it's not a good feel
ing. I'm in the hands of the op
position and my friends don't
give a damn. It's sad." But he
added: "I don't feel bitterness."
Lonely exile
Why did Cleaver decide to
come back to a country where he
faced a possible prison sentence
of 75 years? "I always wanted to
come back. It seemed from Paris
that the situation had changed
and that I could have my day in
court without the hysterical cli
mate that was here in 1968.
"The Nixon regime was ex
posed and discredited and
Ronald Reagan was no longer
governor. Governor Brown, who
took over, is a progressive per
son, whereas Ronald Reagan is a
repressive person. Also there are
many black people who have
won elective office in this coun
try. And the change has been for
the better."
Kathleen Cleaver stressed the
negative aspects of life in exile.
The Cleavers lived in Cuba,
Algeria and France, and visited
China, North Vietnam and North
Korea. "The things that he did
anticipate finding," she said,
"he never found — support for
the struggle in which he was in
volved in the United States.
"Exile is an endless process,"
she continued. "It's not a prog
ressive life to be in exile — to be
isolated, to be separated, to be
always unable to be really your
self . . . The people that you're
around are not people that are
part of your own culture. Every
thing is twisted around. It's a
process that will wear you out
and wear you down."
Kathleen Cleaver said it was
the repressive atmosphere in the
U.S. in 1968 that caused her
husband to flee. "He felt it was
an alternative to going into San
Quentin and getting his head
blown off," she said. "Consider
ing the case of the San Quentin
Six and what happened to
George Jackson, I don't see how
anyone could fail to understand

why he didn't want to go to San
Quentin."
Recent congressional revela
tions of FBI harassment of the
Black Panther Party will be cen
tral to Eldridge Cleaver's de
fense. "Now everybody knows
that the things they were calling
us paranoid for in 1968 are
true. . . One of the potentials of
my case is that it will allow these
abuses to be more thoroughly
investigated," he said.
New conservatism
Cleaver now describes himself
as "conservative in some re
spects . . . I've found some val
ues in American society I want to
see conserved. I think America is
a beautiful country, but I'm not
abandoning my desire for
change in America.
"We have the freest institu
tions here. That doesn't mean we
have perfect institutions, but it
does have to be taken into ac
count in your approach to
change."
Reflecting back to the decade
in which he was a major political
figure, Cleaver said, "I lookupon
the movement of the '60s- as a
success. We conquered the
minds of the American people.
But I see a failure to consolidate
those victories."
This consolidation should oc
cur, he said, through the elec
toral process and patriotic ac
tion. "I'm ready to stand up in
public and sing the Star Spang
led Banner," he said.
"Movements that have been
successful have not been alien
ated from the people of their
countries. They're patriotic:
They do it in the name of their
fatherland.
"But in the '60s we came ac
ross as an alien fifth column that
was manipulated from abroad.
We need to break away from that
image and continue embracing
our original goals while reem
bracing our patriotism."
Cleaver now favors a strong
military. "We have to recognize
it (a strong military) is necessary
and decide how we want it con
ducted. A world in which the
American military has ceased to
exist is a world in which the Un
ited States is ground under
foot . . . The problem (is) the
kind of orders they're taking."
Confident of acquittal
While waiting for his trial to
begin, Cleaver is trying to get his
parole violation charges drop
ped so that he can be released on

bail. Cleaver served almost 11
years as an inmate and parolee
on a 14-year sentence before fle
eing the country, and claims that
California state law dictates he
has served enough time to drop
the remaining three-year parole
requirement.
If released and ultimately ac
quitted, Cleaver says he will de
vote his time to writing (he has a
manuscript covering the last 10
years of his life), politics and
clothes designing.
And he believes he will be ac
quitted. "I'm confident that I'll
receive a fair trial. I'm not saying
a perfect trial, but a fair trial.
"I will have my day in court
and I will be vindicated."
