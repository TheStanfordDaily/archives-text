JERUSALEM (AP) — Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin flies to
the United States today for a visit
born of Henry Kissinger's Mid
dle East triumphs, but clouded
by the uncertainty that has fol
lowed.
The Egyptian-Israeli interim
agreement that the secretary of
state secured five months ago
gave promise of a new era in the
Middle East, but today the con
flict seems deadlocked again.
On the surface, Rabin's visit
will be a sumptuous event, with
lavish receptions, Bicentennial
ceremonies and a Rabin speech

to Congress.
But beneath the pomp, the
53-year-old premier faces one of
the toughest missions in his
career.
Three basic tasks await him: to
coordinate U.S. and Israeli pol
icy in the Middle East, to seek
ways to attain peace or at least
prevent a war, and to expand
U.S. political and financial sup
port for Israel.
The Ford administration is
asking Congress to cut military
aid to Israel from $1.9 billion to
$1 billion in fiscal 1977, and
Rabin is expected to take this up

as a matter of top priority in
Washington.
Rabin made no mention of this
yesterday, however, saying in a
cabinet communique only that
he would express "the aspira
tions of the government ... to
reach understanding with the
U.S. government regarding ways
of promoting the process of
political negotiations for attain
ing peace."
Nobody will say what direc
tion Middle East diplomacy will
take after Rabin's visit.
Jerusalem's best informed ob
servers and commentators can
do little more than guess.
