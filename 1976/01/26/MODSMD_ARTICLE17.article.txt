## Cal blows 14-point lead Cards come up short again 
### CHRIS BAKER 
If the producers of the Pacific
Eight television Game of the
Week wrote the script of Satur
day afternoon's Stanford-
California contest themselves,
they couldn't have done a better
job. It was a game which had all
but one of the elements of fine
daytime TV drama.
Suddenly, or at NBC's return
from a commercial, there were
the good guys, all but given up
for dead, staging a miraculous
14-point comeback. And there
were the 6044 Maples fans, who
for over 35 minutes had acted as
if they were watching a tennis
match, chanting — no, shouting
— "defense."
The program even went into
two overtimes. Except the good
guys didn't win. Close maybe,
but no dice, as Cal remained in
the Pac-8 race by beating Stan
ford, 89-85.
The first overtime period
ended just like the second half
did, with the Cards missing the
shot that would have won the
game. WhenCal's flashy 5-foot-9
freshman guard Gene Ransom
went to the free throw line with
eight seconds remaining in the
last five-minute overtime period
he had to be thinking of how his
Bear teammates had blown five
free throws that would have won
the game for Cal in regulation
time.
Ransom calmly sank two free
throws to give Cal a 87-85 lead,
assuring the Bears of nothing
worse than a third overtime.
Stanford center Tim Patterson
took a 20-footer which fell short

at the other end and Cal guard
Rickie Hawthorne, who had
missed four free throws in regu
lation time, hit two free throws
to put the game out of reach at
89-85, with one second remain
ing.

Cal coach Dick Edwards was
nervously smoking a cigarette as
he talked to reporters after the
game. "We should have won it
easily, I think," Edwards over
stated. 'The game was extremely
important to us. I think I would

have said that even if we lost. We
needed it very badly."
But Stanford wanted it very
badly too. With the Bears well on
their way to their fourth straight
win over the Cards, leading
73-59 with just 4:36 remaining,
Stanford started its comeback.
And it couldn't have been more
difficult.
For over 35 minutes the Bears
had played and shot out of their
minds (.694 from the floor in the
first half). It was almost as if NBC
had set up a giant television set
to replay last year's 60-48 Cal
win in Berkeley.
Cal used the same collapsing
3-2 zone defense, which preyed
upon Stanford's inability to hit
from the outside. The Bears
choked off the middle of the
lane, refusing to allow the Cards
to get the ball inside to the 6-11
Patterson. Cuard Mike Bratz
couldn't crack the Cal defense
from the outside, shooting a
miserable one of seven from the
floor in the first half.
'Flat-footed'
Nothing Stanford coach Dick
Dißiaso did seemed to work.
"We came out flat-footed in the
first half," said Dißiaso. "We-did
not play good defense." The
only difference from last year
was that Edwards didn't employ
a four-corner stall offense. This
time it was a four-corner shoot
ing offense.
Senior forward Carl Bird, who
last year burned the Cards for a
Bear-high 20 points in Harmon
Gym, was hotter than ever, hit
ting seven of eight from the floor
in the first half for 14 points. Cal

hit 25 of 36 shots from the floor
in the first half, while Stanford
was hitting only 14 of 36 for a
dismal .389 percentage from the
field.
So as Cal left the floor with a
51-39 halftime lead, more than a
few of the 6044 Maples fans left
to enjoy the last moments of a
beautiful winter day.
They should have stayed to
enjoy the last 4:36 of basketball's
version of the Big Game. With
Cal ahead 73-59, Edwards called
a timeout. Dißiaso explained his
strategy during that break: "In
the last five minutes, we had
them on the run, and executed
everything that had to be done to
win. At 73-59, we said during
the timeout that it would take 15
or 16 points on our part to win
the game, and that we couldn't
let them get more than 75."
Fouled wrong people
And the Cards didn't. Dißiaso
ordered a full court press that
was more effective than the
UCLA press under former boss
John Wooden. It forced three
costly Cal turnovers. And at the
other end, Stanford couldn't
miss. But the Cards fouled the
wrong people: Hawthorne, a
.732 shooter from the line, and
forward Connie White, a .703
free throw shooter.
The pair surprisingly missed
five free throws in the bonus
situation.
So before TV commentator
Tom Hawkins could say "Oh
my," Stanford trailed by a single
basket at 73-71 with 1:29 remain
ing in the second half. All of a
sudden Bratz stole an inbounds

pass and hit freshman guard
Paul Giovacchini, who scored
the biggest basket of his career to
knot the game at 73-73 with 1:15
left.
Maples Madness. . . bed
lam. . . The Bears threw the ball
away. . . Stanford imitated Notre
Dame by stalling down to 14
seconds. . . Time out. . . "All
Right Now."
Dißiaso used the time out to
set up the last shot in the second
half. "We set up the last shot for
Tim to shoot the jumper behind
the double screen." It went just
as planned, with Bratz passing
off to Patterson, but the shot
didn't go in.
The Cards had to play catch
up in the first overtime after Cal
won the tip and Ransom hit the
opening basket. Stanford went
into another stall with 2:13 left
in the period.
With 13 seconds left on the
clock Dißiaso set up the last play
of the period. This time he let
Bratz miss the shot. Some Stan
ford fans say they will dream
about Patterson's and Bratz'
shots for a long time.
But probably no longer than
Cal's Gene "The Dream" Ran
som, who won the game for Cal
in the next overtime with his two
clutch free throws from the line.
Dißiaso likes to talk of long
range goals and he may have
seen one of his plans become re
ality in Maples. "We saw some
thing new today — the Stanford
student body chanting 'de
fense.' This may be more sig
nificant than the fact that we lost
the game."

LEANING TOWER—Stanford freshman Wolfe Perry puts up a
combination layin-hook shot-jumper in Cal's 89-85 double overtime
win Saturday. Perry attempted some shots of questionable
value in the game, but contributed two key baskets in the Cards'
14-point streak that led to a 73-73 tie at the end of regulation play.
