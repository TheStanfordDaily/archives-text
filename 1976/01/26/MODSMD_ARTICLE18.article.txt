### STUART CORLISS 
The Stanford women's swim team, led by
outstanding performances by Rose Storm,
splashed to victory in the final event to nose
out UCLA for second place in the Stanford
Invitational Championships Friday and Satur
day at the deGuerre Pool Complex. Perennial
power Arizona State University, on the basis of
a very strong showing by its divers, won the
meet with 670 points, while Stanford and
UCLA scored 648 and 645 points, respectively.
Stanford's ace sprinter, Rosemary Storm,
won the 50-yard freestyle and anchored the
winning 200 freestyle relay, the only two
events a frustrated Stanford team managed to
win.
For the second time this season, Storm
blazed under the existing National Collegiate
Women's record with a clocking of 24.685 in
the 50-yard freestyle. Stanford's 200 freestyle
relay team of Vicki Hays, Barbara Bacon, Bar
bara Beck (24.8 split), and Storm (24.2 split)
ripped to a 1:39.6 first-place clocking (a pool
and Stanford team record), thereby thwarting a
Bruin bid for second place in the meet.
Participating in the meet were some of the
best teams in the western United States in
cluded UCLA, USC, Arizona State and Col
orado State. At least six former Olympians plus
a few national champions accelerated the pace
of the meet.
Moe not slow
Olympic gold-medalist Karen Moe of UCLA
swam to pool records in the 100-yard butterfly

(58.9) and 200-yard butterfly (2:05.9), while
another 1972 Olympian, Melissa Belote of
Arizona State, broke pool marks inthe200-yard
backstroke (2:08.4) and individual medley
(2:12.7).
USC's Olympian, Heather Greenwood, cap
tured the 500 free in 4:58, ahead of Stanford's
freshman sensation, JoHarshbarger. Ironically
enough, it was a second place finish to the
same Greenwood in the national meet this
summer that qualified her for a foreign trip.
Harshbarger leaves today to represent the Un
ited States in the Speedo World Meet in
Amersfoort, Holland.
Card standouts
A number of outstanding performances were
recorded as Stanford's swimmers zeroed in on
National qualification standards. Mary Ann
Floyd qualified in the 200 and 500 freestyles
and set a team record in the 100 free of 55.0.
Margot Hagstette achieved the standards in the
200 butterfly and 200 free with team record
clockings of 2:11.9 and 1:56.0. Senior captain
Vicki Hays placed second in the 50-yard breas
troke and scored in three other individual
events while freshman Beck scored in
four individual events also.
According to head coach Jim Gaughran, one
of the most impressive swims of the meet was
Holly Edwards' 200 freestyle race in which her
1:58.3 qualified her for the AIAW's. "She's re
ally come a long way this year," commented
Gaughran.
