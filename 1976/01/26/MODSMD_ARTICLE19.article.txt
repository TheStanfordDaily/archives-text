## 
### JEFF PARIETTI 
Stanford opened its 1976 track
season in the San Francisco
Examiner Games at the Cow
Palace last Friday night.
The Card contingent got a
taste of some top flight competi
tion in the star-studded meet and
came away with several good
performances.
The top effort was by James
Lofton, who finished second to
defending Olympic long jump
champ Randy Williams. Wil
liams had a winning mark of 24
feet-5 inches, while Lofton
leaped 23-lIV2.
Sprinter Marvin Holmes
placed fourth in the open 60-
yard dash with a time of 6.4 sec
onds, beating out former USC
star Willie Deckard. Valeriy Bor
zov of the USSR, double gold
medalist at Munich, ran fluidly
and cruised to victory with a
time of 6.1.
Stanford Coach Payton Jordan
got into the act and looked im
pressive in winning the masters'
(50-years-old and up] 60-yard
dash. Jordan turned in a 7.1,
beating the field by a good 10-15
yards and taking his fourth
straight Examiner Games title.
Sandy Sandoval turned in a
good early season time of 8:52.4
as he placed sixth in an excellent
two-mile field including Olym
pic marathon winner Frank
Shorter, 1975 NCAA cross coun
try champion Craig Virgin of Il
linois and South African Ewald
Bonzet, the eventual winner in
8:40.4. Sandoval's mark was the
fastest indoor two-mile in Stan
ford history.
The Cards' mile relay team of
Matt Hog sett, John Foster, Paul
McCarthy and Lofton led early,
but ended up third en route to a
3:27.1 clocking. San Jose State
won in 3:23.
Other athletes competing for
Stanford were Jerry Novotny,
fourth in the 160-yard dash,
Mark Hadley, sixth in a tough
half-mile field, Foster, sixth in
the high hurdles, and pole vaul
ter Bob Flint, who came close but
failed to clear the opening height
of 16 feet.

WHATTA MOVE—Sonia Javis, a junior on the Stanford women's
basketball team, slips through the San Jose State defense in a game
earlier this year, and makes a move Wolfe Perry would be proud
of. The Cards won two games over the weekend and now have a
record of 4-2.
Stanford opened its 1976 track
season in the San Francisco
Examiner Games at the Cow
Palace last Friday night.
The Card contingent got a
taste of some top flight competi
tion in the star-studded meet and
came away with several good
performances.
The top effort was by James
Lofton, who finished second to
defending Olympic long jump
champ Randy Williams. Wil
liams had a winning mark of 24
feet-5 inches, while Lofton
leaped 23-lIV2.
Sprinter Marvin Holmes
placed fourth in the open 60-
yard dash with a time of 6.4 sec
onds, beating out former USC
star Willie Deckard. Valeriy Bor
zov of the USSR, double gold
medalist at Munich, ran fluidly
and cruised to victory with a
time of 6.1.
Stanford Coach Payton Jordan
got into the act and looked im
pressive in winning the masters'
(50-years-old and up] 60-yard
dash. Jordan turned in a 7.1,
beating the field by a good 10-15
yards and taking his fourth
straight Examiner Games title.
Sandy Sandoval turned in a
good early season time of 8:52.4
as he placed sixth in an excellent
two-mile field including Olym
pic marathon winner Frank
Shorter, 1975 NCAA cross coun
try champion Craig Virgin of Il
linois and South African Ewald
Bonzet, the eventual winner in
8:40.4. Sandoval's mark was the
fastest indoor two-mile in Stan
ford history.
The Cards' mile relay team of
Matt Hog sett, John Foster, Paul
McCarthy and Lofton led early,
but ended up third en route to a
3:27.1 clocking. San Jose State
won in 3:23.
Other athletes competing for
Stanford were Jerry Novotny,
fourth in the 160-yard dash,
Mark Hadley, sixth in a tough
half-mile field, Foster, sixth in
the high hurdles, and pole vaul
