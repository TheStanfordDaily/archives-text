# Lesbian author calls on women to exercise 'psychic strategy'
## 
### SETH FOLDY 
Neither economic revolution nor re
form are sufficient to achieve true lib
eration, lesbian author Sally Gearhardt
told an audience of 250 Friday in Din
kelspiel Auditorium.
Gearhardt, 44, an assistant professor
of speech communication at San Fran
cisco State University, spoke in place
of author Rita Mae Brown who did not
appear due to illness.
Brown was originally scheduled to
speak as part of Disorientation Week,
which was sponsored by the Alliance
for Radical Change (ARC).
Only by relying on the "ex
tranatural, kookie, supernatural" ele
ments in woman's soul can women
heal their "ten-thousand-year rape,"
Gearhardt said.
'Taking feminism'
"Since I've been taking feminism,
I've changed immensely," said
Gearhardt, mimicking a Geritol com
mercial. "I discovered that I was in the
midst of an exploitative economic sys
tem. . . I found myself wanting to
abolish even property."
"Much of what I believed fit right in
with what those socialists were say
ing," Gearhardt noted.
But, she added, "Feminism is an
ideology and practice that includes
socialism, and feminism in the wider
vision. A feminist fights not only
capitalism, but patriarchy as well."
Feminists must avoid "copying the
very patterns that exploited us in the
first place."
Gearhardt asserted that past socialist
revolutions "have regularly failed to
solve the basic contradiction of sexual
oppression."
Different strategies
Economic revolution, reform, and
the building of alternative institutions
are all different strategies that womon
can adopt in the struggle for liberation.
Gearhardt, attacking those three
strategies, felt a "fourth strategy" is
necessary.
"Toparticipate in violent overthrow

is to paticipate in the imperialist mas
culine principle," she said of her
"socialist sisters." "Reforms within
the system have gained inches, but the
price paid by women has been miles";
alternative institutions are "either de
stroyed or bought off."
Gearhardt labeled the fourth
strategy that of "hunches and midwif
ery." That strategy is the "psychic
strategy" of spiritual and psychologi
cal discovery from astrology and tarot
to dreams and the "laying-on of
hands."
The other strategies that women are
pursuing "all deal with economics,
deal with the competitive world, deal
with patriarchy." Gearhardt said
women now require "separation and
self-government."
She noted the "psychic strategy"
rings of "good old-fashioned relig
ion," of "bourgeois individualism,"
and might be considered too slow.
'Radical anarchism'
Yet "not to allow spirituality is
'good old-fashoned fascism.' It is in
deed a very individualistic move
ment," said Gearhardt, who urged the
audience on to a "radical anarchism."
Much of the largely female crowd re
sponded with enthusiasm.
Gearhardt said "You can't push a
woman to a trot. She will move at her
own pace, but at her own pace, she will
move!"
One man in the audience challenged
the notion of separatism. Headvocated
that men and women work "in com
mon cause to throw off sex roles."
"My greatest faith lies with men that
have the courage to understand why
women are leaving them," Gearhardt
replied. She urged men to "find the
woman inside themselves,so they don't
have to conquer the women out there."
Rita Mae Brown, radical lesbian au
thor of the novel Rubvfruit Jungle, in
formed Disorientation Week organiz
ers of her illness Friday morning.
"We were obviously disappointed,"
said ARC member Blythe Mickelson.

However, Mickelson added, "Sally's
speech was very thought-provoking."
Gearhardt co-authored Loving Wo
men, Loving Men: Gay Liberation and
the Ghurch with the Rev. Bill Johnson.
She is also affiliated with the San
Franciso Women's Centers.
