KANSAS CITY (AP) Michi
gan State University's football
program was placed on three
years probation yesterday by the
National Collegiate Athletic As
sociation.
The ban prohibits the Big Ten
school from participating in any
postseason competition follow
ing the 1976,1977 and 1978 sea
sons and from appearing in any
television games during that
period.
In addition, the university will
be permitted to award only 20
new football scholarships durng
the 1976-77 academic year,
rather than the allowable 30, and
will be allowed five less than the
normal limit in each of the fol
lowing two years.

MSU officials at East Lansing
were not immediately available
for comment.
The investigation began last
April when an unidentified
school filed a complaint about
MSU with the NCAA. The com
plaint concerned a reported 70
violations the university made
in recruiting high school
athletes from the Midwest, par
ticularly Ohio.
At the time head coach Denny
Stolz said: "We have done no
thing that would constitute
Michigan State being put on
probation."
He called the allegations "typ
ical of what happens when a
young program becomes suc
cessful."
