# Crenshaw wins Crosby Pro-Am

### TIM W. FERGUSON RON BECK 
PEBBLE BEACHâ€”AII weekend long the crowds had followed
around their leader, the king of golf, swarming from each put
ting green to the following tee as soon as Jack Nicklaus holed
out.
Yesterday they found the emperor had no clothes. Just as
suddenly as he had stormed into the Bing Crosby Pro-Am Golf
Tournament lead on Saturday, Nicklaus fell apart Sunday be- i
neath the clearest of skies at majestic Pebble Beach Golf Links, j
Nicklaus' collapse to one of the worst rounds of his pro career !
(a 10-over-par 82) opened the way for the boy wonder of yes- j
teryear, Ben Crenshaw, to grab the tourney title with a seven- j
under-par 281.
Crenshaw, an early sensation on the pro tour after leaving the j
University of Texas three years ago, made up three strokes on the |
leaders as his 18-year-old bride wildly cheered his birdie putts, j
As wistful winds blew in from the neighboring Pacific Ocean, !
Crenshaw parlayed power and putts into a three-under-par |
round of 69, while Nicklaus hacked his way to a triple-bogey \
seven on the 400-yard 13th hole.
Nicklaus, still in the lead with only six holes to play, placed jj
his second shot on the 13th 50 yards to the left of the green. He \
needed four shots to get on the green, and then used up three f
more to hole the ball.
Stanford grad and British Open Champ Tom Watson tied for \
fifth place in the tourney at 286 with Australian David Graham. I
Ahead of Watson was mysterious Mike Morley in second with |
283, while Dave Hill and rookie George Burns tied for third at jj
284. |
