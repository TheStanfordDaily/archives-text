# Wrestlers win once, lose twice

### BRUCE ANDERSON 
The Stanford wrestling team
returned yesterday from a south
ern California road trip, which
coach Joe DeMeo described as
"not a bad weekend." The Cards
beat Cal Poly-Pomona, 36-11,
and lost to UC-Santa Barbara,
28-21, and Cal State-Bakersfield
38-9. Stanford's season record is
now 3-13.
The Cards were a little short
on manpower against Santa Bar
bara on Friday night. Stanford
won five of the eight matches in
which it had wrestlers, but the
12 unaccounted points awarded
for two Stanford forfeits assured
a Santa Barbara victory.
Saturday the Cardinals re
gained winning form long
enough to whip Cal-Poly
Pomona, but came out on the
short end of the score against
Bakersfield State, the No. 2
college-division team in the na
tion.
Senior Craig Reynolds and
co-captain John Govea had per
fect weekends, winning all three
of their matches. Govea's string
of consecutive wins has now run
to seven.
Eric Grunseth, Lester Yoshida
and Michael King all won two of
their three matches on the trip
this weekend.
The Cards take to the mat
again this afternoon at 4 against
Cal State-Northridge. Stanford
will need some strong perfor
mances today if it hopes to win.
