Jackson's advice 'helped' CIA
WASHINGTON — Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.), gave
the CIA "extremely helpful" advice on how to deflect a
threatened congressional investigation of CIA and ITT
activities in Chile, according to a CIA memo described last
night by CBS News.
Jackson, a presidential contender, said that it was "ab
surd" to say he was part of a coverup.
The memo, reportedly written in February, 1973, by the
chief of the ClA's western hemisphere division, is in the
record of the House intelligence committee and was ob
tained by CBS News, said correspondent Daniel Schorr.
He quoted the memo as saying: "Senator Jackson is
convinced that it is essential that the procedure not be
established whereby the CIA can be called upon to testify
before a wide range of congressional committees."
In another development, newly-released documents
from the ClA's Operation Chaos revealed that the agency
collected information about political dissidents at Utah
State University, Brown University and Boston University
in 1970 and 1971.
The 141 pages of CIA files, the first Operation Chaos
documents to be made public, also showed that the agency
followed the movements of American political dissenters
traveling abroad and kept track of foreign visitors to U.S.
dissident groups.
A separate batch of 47 documents showed that the CIA,
as late as November, 1974, was circulating information
about the political activities of Socialist Workers party
leader Peter Camejo to one of its overseas stations.
The CIA released parts of Cainejo's dossier to him after
he requested it under the Freedom of Information Act.
Ford: economy on the upswing
WASHINGTON — Although unemployment remains
high, almost everything else in the economy is starting to
look good and Americans may be entitled to another major
tax cut in 1979, President Ford said today.
"The underlying fact about our economy is that it is
steadily growing healthier. My policies for 1976 are in
tended to keep us on that upward path," Ford said in his
annual economic report to Congress. He also said, "Re
grettably, a full recovery of the economy will tke time."
Ford did not indicate how much taxes could be de
creased in 1979, but he said the decrease would be on top
of the $28 billion in permanent tax decreases he already
has proposed for this year and next.
He also tied the prospect of future tax reductions to
support for his spending recommendations, including the
$394.2-billion budget he is proposing for fiscal 1977.
Ford's economic report, which Congress receives annu
ally from the President and his Council of Economic Ad
visors, stressed that the worst is over for the economy. It
said Americans can take satisfaction that the nation's
economic system has come through intact.
Unemployment remains a serious problem, Ford said,
but "it is slowly moving in the right direction." Any
attempt to bring the jobless rate down quickly could ignite
new inflation and make matters worse in the long run, he
said.
Ford's economic report gave the following outlook for

this year:
—Unemployment will decline to about 7.3 percent by
the end of the year, down from 8.3 percent in December
1975. That means nearly 6.6 million jobseekers still will
be unable to find work.
—Inflation will decline to about six percent during the
year, compared with seven percent last year.
—The economy will grow between six and 6.6 percent,
as measured by the nation's Gross National Product. The
GNP declined two percent in 1976 and 1.8 percent in
1974.
Wallace optimistic after caucuses
JACKSON, Miss — Alabama Gov. George Wallace be
lieves h« scored a "very significant victory" in Mississip
pi's Democratic caucuses and that it will help his presi
dential campaign in other states.
But he refused to speculate yesterday on whether the
results of Saturday's precinct meetings would affect the
campaign of former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter, who
trailed Wallace in their first confrontation on Southern
soil.
Carter has said Wallace's showing in the slowly re
ported returns indicated the governor would be stronger
in the 19/6 race than some had thought.
Sen. Hubert Humphrey expressed the hope yesterday
that his fellow Democrats would be unable to combine
forces and eliminate Wallace from contention as a candi
date for the Democratic presidential nomination.
"I hope and pray they don't," said Humphrey, who said
the sentiment also applied to Carter. "That's one thing the
Democrats don't need is some more ganging up."
By yesterday afternoon, about 41 percent of the esti
mated 3000 county convention delegates chosen at the
caucuses had been tabulated unofficially. Wallace led
with more than 42 percent of the delegates elected.
Cubans more active in Angola
LUISAKA, Zambia — Cuban troops with the Soviet
backed Popular Front (MPLA) in Angola's civil war are
playing an ever greater part in the command and fighting,
a report from the embattled west African country said
yesterday.
Another report quoted National Union (UNITA) leader
Jonas Savimbi as saying his pro-Western faction is prepar
ing fallback positions as part of a west-east defense line
across the middle of Angola.
This would be to block the MPLA's southward drive
toward the trans-Angola railway.
A western businessman who saw Savimbi in Angola on
Saturday said the line, if held, would keep nearly all of the
railroad under UNITA control.
North of the line, UNITA plans guerrilla operations
aided by experts trained inChina, the businessman added.
China has said it cut off aid early last year to all factions in
Angola.
Will Ellsworth-Jones of the London Sunday Times, re
porting from the MPLA capital of Luanda, wrote:
"All the circumstantial evidence shows that the reason
for not allowing outsiders anywhere near the front is to

conceal the fact that the Cubans have now so much com
mand over the action."
He added, however, that the MPLA continues to insist
that its Cuban allies are still no more than technicians and
advisers.
Hearst frustrated, says analyst
TORRANCE — Newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst is
frustrated, highly intuitive, hard to influence and prone to
rationalizations, a handwriting analyst says.
Hearst has undergone an emotional transfiguration be
tween her Feburary, 1974, disappearance and capture last
Sept. 18, the analyst, Dorothy Jackson said in an interview
with The Daily Breeze, located in this Los Angeles suburb.
Hearst's trial on federal and robbery charges in San
Francisco is scheduled to begin tomorrow.
Since becoming involved with the Sybionese Liberation
Army, Hearst's handwriting has reflected significant
changes, Jackson said.
The dot on her "i" used to be round and firm, she said,
but now it's a jab that indicates "her impatience and irrita
bility."
Jackson, a syndicated columnist for the Copley News
Service, added in the interview that evidence of Hearst's
"intuitive gifts" also appeared to vanish from her pen
manship after her disappearance.
"Her purpose and will power have weakened as well,"
she said.
Calm returns to Beirut
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Thousands of Lebanese poured
into Beirut's warm, sunny streets in a relaxed mood yes
terday after months of civil war, and the blare of car horns
replaced the sound of gunfire as traffic piled up along
seaside boulevards.
Premier Rashid Karami announced that under the
Syrian-sponsored cease-fire the warring sides had agreed
to reopen all roads by yesterday evening and to withdraw
all their barricades and gunmen from the capital's streets
by tomorrow.
Truckloads of steel-helmeted soldiers of the Palestine
Liberation Army (PLA) cruised slowly through the
crowded streets of Moslem west Beirut on antilooting and
cease-fire patrols.
A police spokesman said the Palestinians had shot and
killed seven gunmen and arrested scores of other gunmen
and looters Saturday in their campaign against anarchy.
Officials said Syria had assured leaders of Christian
private armies that it would allow no infringement on
Lebanese sovereignty under the cease-fire worked out
Thursday.
This was to dispel Christian fears that Syria's participa
tion in the peacekeeping apparatus could turn Lebanon
into a Syrian domain, a spokesman said.
Waldheim: Americans unrealistic
DENVER — United Nations Secretary-General Kurt
Waldheim warned Americans yesterday against "dispro

portionate and excessive disillusionment" with the U.N.
It was the first time the world body's top officer openly
commented on the growing American dissatisfaction with
the U.N., where the United States has come under increas
ingly frequent assault from Third World and Communist
nations.
"This disillusionment persists and on occasion rises
almost to fever pitch," Waldheim declared in a speech to
the University of Denver's Social Science Foundation.
Waldheim, an Austrian, traced the disillusionment
with the United Nations to the "excessive hopes" placed
in the world parliment by its founders, who met in the
wake of World War II convinced they had found a "magi
cal new formula" to end all global conflicts.
The hopes led to "equally excessive disillusionment,"
he said. But it is obviously unrealistic to believe that the
basic fault lies in the international machinery which has
been set up," he added.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow with patchy night and
morning fog. A little warmer tomorrow. Lows in he 30s to
low 40s. Highs in the 60s.
