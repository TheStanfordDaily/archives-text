# Protest withdrawn
## Pub should start next fall 
### RIV WEBER 
The long-promised campus pub
has apparently overcome a major
obstacle and should be in full oper
ation by fall quarter, according to
Bob Casselli, Tresidder managerfor
the TDS catering franchise which
will manage the pub.
Noonechalleged the pub's liquor
license application Friday at a state
Department of Alcoholic Beverge
Conrol (ABC) hearing in San Jose.
The hearing was prompted by a
Stanford student complaint.
Casselli said an ABC attorney
told him the student withdrew his
complaint a few weeks ago, but
understate law the hearing still had
to be held. After no one appeared,
an administrative law judge consi
dered the complaint "abandoned"
and denied it.
The judge's formal ruling, which
is expected to be in favor of the pub,
will be followed by anticipated
ABC approval within two weeks.
TDS, which operates the Transi
tion, the Coffee House and Encina
Commons, is currently conducting
a financial viability study and joint
University survey of faculty,staff
and students.
If the results of the study and sur
vey are favorable, Casselli said the
pub could be in operation "by fall
quarter or possibly earlier."
