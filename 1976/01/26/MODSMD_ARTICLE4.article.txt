# Lyman: 'No possibility' of returning to semesters
## 
### KAREN CAESAR 
Despite an endorsement from the
Committee on Reform and Renewal of
liberal Education at Stanford (COR
RLES), reinstitution of the semester
system here appears extremely un
likely.
CORRLES voted 7-0, with two
abstentions, to recommend the change
"because of the need in the humanities
for a longer time to absorb material,
write research papers and build those
elements needed for class discussion."
But for the immediate future, there is
"no possibility" of a change from the
quarter system, making the question a
"dead issue," according to President
Richard Lyman.
No reason
Communication Prof. Henry Breit
rose, who chaired a Budget Priorities
Committee task force which dealt with
the question, said, "Basically, we
couldn't find any particular reason at
all to go on the semester system. In a
nutshell, there are no obvious reasons
why one system is better than the
other, looking from the standpoint of
the University as a whole."
The task force concluded "none of
the studies on quarter versus semester
schedules which polled student and
departmental opinion has ever found
that a majority of the students or fa
culty expressed preference for the
semester system.
"None of the studies has de

monstrated the clear financial benefit
of either system, although from time to
time proponents of one or the other
system haveclaimed financial benefits
from their favored arrangement."
'Even split'
"I think semesters are preferable and
always have thought so," said Lyman.
He emphasized that most teachers in
the humanities feel his way. "It's just
about an even split" between faculty as
to reinstating the semester system.
"It's fairly typical of people in the

humanities to want semesters. People
in hard sciences and engineering favor
quarters. It depends on the nature of
the work you are doing," said Lyman
Stanford was originally organized to
operate on the semester system, and
did so from the opening in 1891 up
through academic year 1916-1917.
As for going back to semesters some
time in the foreseeable future, "we'll
put the question on dry ice for the time
being." concluded Lyman.
