Maintenance of full employment
levels in the U.S. in the year 2000 will
increase energy consumption six-fold,
government energy specialist Dr.
Chauncey Starr said last week.
Speaking on "A Strategy of National
Energy Production," Starr said this
prediction was based on a projected 36
percent increase in the work force over
the next 25 years, which will require
an equivalent increase in industrial
productivity and therefore increased
energy supplies.

Starr used graphical and statistical
techniques to illustrate the correlation
between energy consumption and the
Gross National Product (GNP). For
example, a graph of electrical power
use over the past 25 years fluctuates in
a manner identical to changes in
employment; the peaks and low points
of electricity consumption and
employment coincide exactly.
Fundamental changes
If the nation is unwilling or unable
to develop new energy sources, it may
need to accept fundamental changes in
the social structure, life styles and
employment standards, according to
Starr.
Elimination of electric clothes
dryers might be such a change, Starr
suggested. By reverting to clothes
lines, a three percent reduction in na
tional energy consumption could be
obtained, he claimed.
Curtailment of private automobile
use is another possibility, Starr said.
Residences might have to be more
concentrated around areas of indust
rial employment, such as thoy are in
Sweden, an industrial country whose
energy needs per capita are much less
than those of the U.S.
Swedish people also travel much
less to seek recreational activities,
Starr claimed.
New sources
The development of new energy
sources, such as geothermal and solar,
could aid in meeting U.S. energy
needs. Yet Starr did not anticipate suf
ficient development in these areas to
make significant contributions in the
next 25 years.
To illustrate the practical limita
tions of incorporating new energy
sources into the economic structure,
he referred to France's current nuclear
power program, which is being im
plemented as quickly as possible. By
the year 2000. nuclear power will only
constitute 10 percent of France's
energy supply.
Starr emphasized that in making
economic analyses of energy expan
sion. the nation must also consider the
costs of environmental and social im
pacts. Such costs "fire real costs," even
though they are less tangible and hard
to quantify," he said.

than those of the U.S.
Swedish people also travel much
less to seek recreational activities,
Starr claimed.
New sources
The development of new energy
sources, such as geothermal and solar,
could aid in meeting U.S. energy
needs. Yet Starr did not anticipate suf
ficient development in these areas to
make significant contributions in the
next 25 years.
To illustrate the practical limita
tions of incorporating new energy
sources into the economic structure,
he referred to France's current nuclear
power program, which is being im
plemented as quickly as possible. By
the year 2000. nuclear power will only
constitute 10 percent of France's
energy supply.
Starr emphasized that in making
economic analyses of energy expan
sion. the nation must also consider the
costs of environmental and social im
pacts. Such costs "fire real costs," even
though they are less tangible and hard
to quantify," he said.
