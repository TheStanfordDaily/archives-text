## Requirements 
### 
Every Stanford graduate should be well-grounded in
knowledge of Western civilization, but a recent prop
osal to require every student to take three Western
culture courses is misguided.
The proposal by the Committee on the Reform and
Renewal of Undergraduate Education at Stanford
to require such courses is likely to defeat its
purpose of encouraging students to seek a broad liberal
education.
Most undergraduates here have a tendency to chafe
at the imposition of required courses. If students were
forced to enroll in Western civilization courses,some
would likely perform only the minimum work re
quired to pass.
Such lack of enthusiasm would inevitably force pro
fessors to dilute the quality of their courses, depriving
serious students of the chance to be intellectually chal
lenged.
Furthermore, exising distribution requirements
seem to us to adequately prevent students from taking
courses only in their areas of concentration.
Proponents of required courses argue some sort of
basic, introductory structure is needed in the
humanities.
But we contend such framework is already provided
in the History 1-2-3 sequence. These courses, taught by
distinguished professors to overflowing classes, are
academically rigorous and are taken by students with a
wide variety of academic interests.
The administration should certainly do everything it
can to encourage students to take these and other basic
humanities courses. But requiring such study can
serve no useful purpose.
