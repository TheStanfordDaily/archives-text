# Theme houses
## 
### Greg Vandenburg 
In September 1976, the Robert
Moore Houses will open to un
dergraduate residents. Comple
tion of the halls will climax a
project in which the Stanford
community has devoted consid
erable energy and money.
The quality of construction,
architectural design and fur
nishings will make these houses
the highlight of undergraduate
housing. Such quality may also
result in consideration of the
three Row houses as theme
houses.
1 strongly oppose such con
sideration.
To have a cohesive theme
house, it is understandably
necessary to choose students
selectively. Their interests or
studies determine their eligibil
ity.
Many excluded
Many undergraduates are thus
excluded from such residences if
their interests do not correspond
to the theme, while eligible stu
dents are "given the break" of
priority to that house.
Is it equitable to allow the new
Row houses to have theme prog
rams without an appraisal of
student preference? Certainly
not.
These houses should be acces
sible to all. Ideally, student
motivation to enter a theme
house should be based upon
his/her interest in the program,
not upon the attractive qualities
of the residence.
It is one thing to state opposi
tion; it is quite another to prop
ose an alternative. Where else
could the theme houses be lo
cated?
Lower desirability
Dormitories or other estab
lished Row houses with lower
desirability are the only better
choices. True student interest in
the focus of the program would
be more apparent.

The choice of Guthrie House
to be the French House serves as
an example. Students preferred
Guthrie less than any other
house on the Row in the past,
principally because only female
students were allowed resi
dence.
Such low desirability made
Guthrie the appropriate selec
tion as the location of the French
House.
If no other Row houses are
chosen, a Wilbur dorm could be
an acceptable choice. Any theme
house without inherent need for
separate kitchen facilities
chould feasibly be located there.
Cottage adjoins
A cottage already adjoins each
dorm which would accomodate
guests or professors-in
residence proposals.
Faculty residences can be in
stalled in each of the three new
Row houses. Installation of each
faculty-in-residence unit would
eliminate only two student
roons.
It was a wise decision to de
sign such conversion potential
into the original construction of
the houses.
However, the wisdom is jus
tified only in view of the future.
For the present, theme programs
for any of the Robert Moore
Houses are not acceptable.
