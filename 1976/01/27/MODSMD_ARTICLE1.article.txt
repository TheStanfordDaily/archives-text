# El Camino interchange modification planned
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
The University is contributing
$42,000 in federal funds to improve
the "high-hazard" interchange at El
("amino Real and University Avenue
in Palo Alto, Facilities Director James
Nelson of the University Planning Of
fice confirmed yesterday.
Last week, City Traffic Engineer Ted
Noguchi disclosed that the improve
ments, consisting of traffic signals and
new lane arrangements, had been
given top priority by the city because
of the money from the University.
If the Palo Alto City Council ap
proves the project at its meeting next
Monday, work could start in April or
May, Noguchi said. He emphasized
that the interchange "has been iden
tified for some time" as a serious traffic
hazard.
Nelson said the University had re
ceived the federal funds during the
past two years from Community De
velopment Block Crant funds.
Federal restrictions
Nelson and John Breedlove, man
ager of land resources, said the Uni
versity has few options for spending
the gran? money because of restric
tions imposed by the government.
"The results of the project would
have to be open to the public, (but the
University) has always reserved the
right to make use of its rights as a pri
vate landowner," Breedlove said.
The University, being a private
landowner, allows the public vehicu
lar access through the campus. Since
the University may withdraw this ac
cess at any time, the results of any pro
ject must be made permanently avail
able to the public.
The construction of campus recrea
tional facilities and bike paths have
been considered as possible uses for
the grant money, according to Breed
love. These ideas were rejected be
cause of the federal constraints on the
way in which the money is to be spent.
Improving the interchange is very
desirable to the University because the
interchange borders its main entrance
on Palm Drive, he added.
No state aid
The University's decision to use its
funds to improve the interchange
"gave us the opportunity to give
another hard look to the project,"
which had been stalled by financial
difficulties when state aid fell through,
Noguchi said.
The total cost of the project is ex
pected to be more than $160,000, in
cluding:
—$42,000 from the University;
—$57,000 which the city had al
ready earmarked for the work;
—$30,000 which had been slated for
the improvement of the Embarcadero
Road underpass at Alma Street;
—$32,500 from the city's street im
provement fund.
Access roads
The main problem with the inter
change involves the numerous access
roads which meet University Avenue
on either side of the overpass, requir
ing many motorists to cross a lane of
traffic before turning, Noguchi said.
The difficulty was compounded by
the access needs of the Santa Clara
County Transit District vehicles to the
Southern Pacific station, he added.

—$32,500 from the city's street im
provement fund.
Access roads
The main problem with the inter
change involves the numerous access
roads which meet University Avenue
on either side of the overpass, requir
ing many motorists to cross a lane of
traffic before turning, Noguchi said.
The difficulty was compounded by
the access needs of the Santa Clara
County Transit District vehicles to the
Southern Pacific station, he added.
The University is contributing
$42,000 in federal funds to improve
the "high-hazard" interchange at El
("amino Real and University Avenue
in Palo Alto, Facilities Director James
Nelson of the University Planning Of
fice confirmed yesterday.
Last week, City Traffic Engineer Ted
Noguchi disclosed that the improve
ments, consisting of traffic signals and
new lane arrangements, had been
given top priority by the city because
of the money from the University.
If the Palo Alto City Council ap
proves the project at its meeting next
Monday, work could start in April or
May, Noguchi said. He emphasized
that the interchange "has been iden
tified for some time" as a serious traffic
hazard.
Nelson said the University had re
ceived the federal funds during the
past two years from Community De
velopment Block Crant funds.
Federal restrictions
Nelson and John Breedlove, man
ager of land resources, said the Uni
versity has few options for spending
the gran? money because of restric
tions imposed by the government.
"The results of the project would
have to be open to the public, (but the
University) has always reserved the
right to make use of its rights as a pri
vate landowner," Breedlove said.
The University, being a private
landowner, allows the public vehicu
lar access through the campus. Since
the University may withdraw this ac
cess at any time, the results of any pro
ject must be made permanently avail
able to the public.
The construction of campus recrea
tional facilities and bike paths have
been considered as possible uses for
the grant money, according to Breed
love. These ideas were rejected be
cause of the federal constraints on the
way in which the money is to be spent.
Improving the interchange is very
desirable to the University because the
interchange borders its main entrance
on Palm Drive, he added.
No state aid
The University's decision to use its
funds to improve the interchange
"gave us the opportunity to give
another hard look to the project,"
which had been stalled by financial
difficulties when state aid fell through,
Noguchi said.
The total cost of the project is ex
pected to be more than $160,000, in
cluding:
—$42,000 from the University;
—$57,000 which the city had al
ready earmarked for the work;
—$30,000 which had been slated for
the improvement of the Embarcadero
Road underpass at Alma Street;
—$32,500 from the city's street im
provement fund.
