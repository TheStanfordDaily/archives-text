# Ford's budget: ill-advised proposals
## 
### 
Ironically, Republicans are perhaps the
beneficiaries of the Watergate scandal.
The'GOP seems to be exploiting the wide
spread distrust of government caused by the
scandal in its efforts to cripple many prog
rams instituted by Democrats in the federal
government during the past 40 years.
President Ford's budget message of last
week is the latest of many administration
attempts to cut social welfare programs
under the guise of appealing to calls for
"less government."
Hence, while congressional Democrats
are likely to thwart many of the spending
cuts proposed in Ford's budget message,
Democrats have by no means expressed the
outrage the budget deserves.
111-advised proposals
The budget is filled with ill-advised
proposals.
For example, it suggests elimi nation of an
enlarged program of public service jobs and
permits expiration of numerous un
employment compensation benefits.
The Administration has tried to justify
these cutbacks by contending the nation has
passed the peak of the recession. But Ad
ministration officials who use this argu
ment ignore the continued high rate of un
employment, which Ford himself predicts
will remain indefinitely at more than seven
percent of the work force.
Since the considerable economic recov
ery reflected in the stock market and the
nation's gross national product has «it yet
affected the jobless rate, it seems reckless for
the Administration to cut programs that
would help relieve the distress of the na
tion's 10 million unemployment workers.
Interests of poor
Ford's proposal to consolidate 59 prog
rams into four block grants to states total
ling $18.2 billion, like the elimination of the

unemployment programs, is consistent
with Republican philosophy but clashes
with the interests of the nation's poor.
The federal government originally insti-

tuted the programs because it felt obligated
to do what localities refused to do. Hostility
toward such programs in many areas is still
great and the newly won control of such
programs by local authorities will enable
them to work more effectively for their abol
ition.
Furthermore, local authorities usually
give less heed to the suggestions of the very
persons who benefit from the progams than
does the federal government.
Ample considerat.on
Ronald Hpown. director of the
Washington, U.C., office of the National
Urban League, for example, expressed con
cern last week because "the principle of
block grants does not give ample considera
tion to those uith no political power on the
local level, and, in and of itself, discrimi
nates against the poor and minorities who
are supposed to be served by the money."
Even worse, the Ford budget proposes to
reduce federal funds in some of the prog
rams involved in the block grants. The Ad
ministration has attempted to justify this by
asserting the unproven claim the programs
can be administered more cheaply on the

local or state level than has been the case on
the federal level.
On other subjects, the budget's recom
mendations are not much better. For exam
ple, expenditures for housing would be
maintained at existing levels even though
the inadequate housing of millions of
Americans indicates spending in this area
should be increased-.
Despite rising crime and inflation rates,
Ford has also proposed a decrease in law
enforcement funding. Spending in this area
would be cut by $50 million to $3.1 billion.
Cuts would be heaviest where increased
spending is needed most: in anti-crime ex
perimental programs and police training.
FBI cutbacks
Although recent Senate investigations
have revealed the need for eliminating some
of the FBl's functions, the Ford budget
would damage to the most legitimate ele
ments of the FBI program.
But perhaps the most egregious aspect of
the budget is its proposal to increase de
fense spending by 10 percent.
Although virtually no one would want to
impair the nation's defense capabilities,
congressional studies have adequately
shown the Pentagon's budget is already
needlessly large.
The Ford budget.therefore, ought to be
come a major target of criticism by all citi
zens who do not want to see gradual de
struction of federal programs instituted in
recent decades.
But there is a great danger the nation's
prevailing anti-government mood, together
with widespread satisfaction over the tax
cut, will muteatall levels of national life the
hostile reaction the budget should receive.

programs by local authorities will enable
them to work more effectively for their abol
ition.
Furthermore, local authorities usually
give less heed to the suggestions of the very
persons who benefit from the progams than
does the federal government.
Ample considerat.on
Ronald Hpown. director of the
Washington, U.C., office of the National
Urban League, for example, expressed con
cern last week because "the principle of
block grants does not give ample considera
tion to those uith no political power on the
local level, and, in and of itself, discrimi
nates against the poor and minorities who
are supposed to be served by the money."
Even worse, the Ford budget proposes to
reduce federal funds in some of the prog
rams involved in the block grants. The Ad
ministration has attempted to justify this by
asserting the unproven claim the programs
can be administered more cheaply on the

local or state level than has been the case on
the federal level.
On other subjects, the budget's recom
mendations are not much better. For exam
ple, expenditures for housing would be
maintained at existing levels even though
the inadequate housing of millions of
Americans indicates spending in this area
should be increased-.
Despite rising crime and inflation rates,
Ford has also proposed a decrease in law
enforcement funding. Spending in this area
would be cut by $50 million to $3.1 billion.
Cuts would be heaviest where increased
spending is needed most: in anti-crime ex
perimental programs and police training.
FBI cutbacks
Although recent Senate investigations
have revealed the need for eliminating some
of the FBl's functions, the Ford budget
would damage to the most legitimate ele
ments of the FBI program.
But perhaps the most egregious aspect of
the budget is its proposal to increase de
fense spending by 10 percent.
Although virtually no one would want to
impair the nation's defense capabilities,
congressional studies have adequately
shown the Pentagon's budget is already
needlessly large.
The Ford budget.therefore, ought to be
come a major target of criticism by all citi
zens who do not want to see gradual de
struction of federal programs instituted in
recent decades.
But there is a great danger the nation's
prevailing anti-government mood, together
with widespread satisfaction over the tax
cut, will muteatall levels of national life the
hostile reaction the budget should receive.

Ironically, Republicans are perhaps the
beneficiaries of the Watergate scandal.
The'GOP seems to be exploiting the wide
spread distrust of government caused by the
scandal in its efforts to cripple many prog
rams instituted by Democrats in the federal
government during the past 40 years.
President Ford's budget message of last
week is the latest of many administration
attempts to cut social welfare programs
under the guise of appealing to calls for
"less government."
Hence, while congressional Democrats
are likely to thwart many of the spending
cuts proposed in Ford's budget message,
Democrats have by no means expressed the
outrage the budget deserves.
111-advised proposals
The budget is filled with ill-advised
proposals.
For example, it suggests elimi nation of an
enlarged program of public service jobs and
permits expiration of numerous un
employment compensation benefits.
The Administration has tried to justify
these cutbacks by contending the nation has
passed the peak of the recession. But Ad
ministration officials who use this argu
ment ignore the continued high rate of un
employment, which Ford himself predicts
will remain indefinitely at more than seven
percent of the work force.
Since the considerable economic recov
ery reflected in the stock market and the
nation's gross national product has «it yet
affected the jobless rate, it seems reckless for
the Administration to cut programs that
would help relieve the distress of the na
tion's 10 million unemployment workers.
Interests of poor
Ford's proposal to consolidate 59 prog
rams into four block grants to states total
ling $18.2 billion, like the elimination of the

unemployment programs, is consistent
with Republican philosophy but clashes
with the interests of the nation's poor.
The federal government originally insti-

tuted the programs because it felt obligated
to do what localities refused to do. Hostility
toward such programs in many areas is still
great and the newly won control of such
programs by local authorities will enable
them to work more effectively for their abol
ition.
Furthermore, local authorities usually
give less heed to the suggestions of the very
persons who benefit from the progams than
