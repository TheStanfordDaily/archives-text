# Don't impose course requirements

It is misleading that the report of the Committee on the Reform
and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford (CORRLES) should
be billed by its authors as the most comprehensive review of un
dergraduate education since the 1968 Study of Education at Stan
ford (SES). The kudo is appropriate because it is the only major
review of the undergraduate program of the School of Humanities
and Sciences.
To compare it to SES, however, both undeservedly lauds COR
RLES and degrades SES, which is singly responsible for theflexible
form of present undergraduate regulations. These regulations
"place upon students a greater share of the responsibility for profit
ing from the University's educational resources."
The theme of the CORRLES report is a significantly decisive
reversal of that philosophy. It proposes to remove from students the
right to choose for themselves a course of study.
The justification given is many students' studies are too limited
while others are not coherent. Yet that flexibility used to be praised
as the advantage of Stanford: A student was free to follow his/her
own desires.
Courses' values
This is not to deny courses in Western culture are valuable and
most persons could benefit from them.
To require students to take them, however, carries a strongly
illiberal connotation: many persons have taken adequate course
work in secondary school, yet they would be required to take
culture courses when they could be spending their time in more
specialized academics.
Many students here come from non-Western cultures, vet they
too would be required to trace "our" cultural history. If nothing
else, this is cultural elitism.
Conversely, if it is intended non-Westerners should be exposed
to a culture other than their own, the same should be required of
Westerners. The proposal's main problem, as with all require
ments, is that it imposes a uniform standard of nonuniform people.
Lyman's description
President Richard Lyman describes the proposal in the Jan. 21
Daily as "an appeal to people rather than a coercive device."
If an appeal is desired, why not makean appeal? No one is forced
to take History 1, 2 and 3 or Humanities 61, 62 and 63, the obvious
prototypes for the new requirements. Nonetheless, thoseareamong
the largest and most popular classes.
Students who like these courses may contend those who do not
take them may be missing something (and they probably are). But
who can justify imposing his preferences on anyone else?
Those who advocate creation of more course sequences, have
their hearts in the right place; expansion of interdisciplinary
studies is long overdue at Stanford.
But to improve the curriculum as a by-product of increasing
requirements is unnatural.
Fulfill requirements
Courses counting for requirement fulfillment may be weak in
content or instruction, but students whose main concern is to pass

Rosenbaum, et al.
with as little effort as possible will likely take these courses, much
as the stereotypical "fir/zy studies" student seeks science "micks."
The point is this: Students who wish to take Western culture
courses will do so; those who do not wish to will begrudgingly
oblige as they anticipate their liberation from a requirement im
posed upon them from above. The moral is that one can lead a
student to a classroom, but one can't make him think.
Furthermore, to place a time limit upon completion of the West
ern culture and distribution requirements would likely force enter
ing students into nothing but large classes. And CORRLES warns
"care must be exercised to prevent the freshman year from becom
ing one in which the only personal contact with teachers is contact
with graduate students."
It does not, however, explain how this caution can be exercised.
It seems impossible, under present budget constraints, the Univer
sity could provide these courses as quality small-group learning
experiences with professors instead of graduate students.

President Richard Lyman describes the proposal in the Jan. 21
Daily as "an appeal to people rather than a coercive device."
If an appeal is desired, why not makean appeal? No one is forced
to take History 1, 2 and 3 or Humanities 61, 62 and 63, the obvious
prototypes for the new requirements. Nonetheless, thoseareamong
the largest and most popular classes.
Students who like these courses may contend those who do not
take them may be missing something (and they probably are). But
who can justify imposing his preferences on anyone else?
Those who advocate creation of more course sequences, have
their hearts in the right place; expansion of interdisciplinary
studies is long overdue at Stanford.
But to improve the curriculum as a by-product of increasing
requirements is unnatural.
Fulfill requirements
Courses counting for requirement fulfillment may be weak in
content or instruction, but students whose main concern is to pass

Rosenbaum, et al.
with as little effort as possible will likely take these courses, much
as the stereotypical "fir/zy studies" student seeks science "micks."
The point is this: Students who wish to take Western culture
courses will do so; those who do not wish to will begrudgingly
oblige as they anticipate their liberation from a requirement im
posed upon them from above. The moral is that one can lead a
student to a classroom, but one can't make him think.
Furthermore, to place a time limit upon completion of the West
ern culture and distribution requirements would likely force enter
ing students into nothing but large classes. And CORRLES warns
"care must be exercised to prevent the freshman year from becom
ing one in which the only personal contact with teachers is contact
with graduate students."
It does not, however, explain how this caution can be exercised.
It seems impossible, under present budget constraints, the Univer
sity could provide these courses as quality small-group learning
experiences with professors instead of graduate students.

(First of two parts)
It is misleading that the report of the Committee on the Reform
and Renewal of Liberal Education at Stanford (CORRLES) should
be billed by its authors as the most comprehensive review of un
dergraduate education since the 1968 Study of Education at Stan
ford (SES). The kudo is appropriate because it is the only major
review of the undergraduate program of the School of Humanities
and Sciences.
To compare it to SES, however, both undeservedly lauds COR
RLES and degrades SES, which is singly responsible for theflexible
form of present undergraduate regulations. These regulations
"place upon students a greater share of the responsibility for profit
ing from the University's educational resources."
The theme of the CORRLES report is a significantly decisive
reversal of that philosophy. It proposes to remove from students the
right to choose for themselves a course of study.
The justification given is many students' studies are too limited
while others are not coherent. Yet that flexibility used to be praised
as the advantage of Stanford: A student was free to follow his/her
own desires.
Courses' values
This is not to deny courses in Western culture are valuable and
most persons could benefit from them.
To require students to take them, however, carries a strongly
illiberal connotation: many persons have taken adequate course
work in secondary school, yet they would be required to take
culture courses when they could be spending their time in more
specialized academics.
Many students here come from non-Western cultures, vet they
too would be required to trace "our" cultural history. If nothing
else, this is cultural elitism.
Conversely, if it is intended non-Westerners should be exposed
to a culture other than their own, the same should be required of
Westerners. The proposal's main problem, as with all require
ments, is that it imposes a uniform standard of nonuniform people.
