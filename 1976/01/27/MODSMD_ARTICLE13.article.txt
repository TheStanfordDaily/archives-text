Editor:
Congratulations to Charlie
Hall and Mark Albertson for
their thoughtful Jan. 15 Daily ar
ticle on the Pearce Mitchell con
dominiums.
As owner of a townhouse in
another community, 1 am more
disdainful of the Mitchell pro
ject than many of the people in
terviewed because of the missed
opportunity to serve some ur
gent housing needs of the Stan
ford community.
I submit the following as an
addition to the items explored in
the article:
—Site utilization is very poor.
The only useful common area is
in the center of the project.
Fewer than 25 percent of the
units overlook it or have direct
access.
—Patio areas do not have di
rect access to common areas.
—Most patios will not seat, in
comfort, more than four people
and there is minimal space for
growing flowers or shrubs.
—Traffic and parking are in
ternal to the project.
—There is significant price
inconsistency between one and
two bedroom units.
—Was land value included in
the price of each unit? If so, how
can the land rental fee be so
high? If not, how can the price of
each unit be so high?
According to the article, Di
rector of Faculty-Staff Housing
Robert Summers believes prices
may have to be raised if the units
are not sold by next summer.
Even with limited eligibility for
these units, I would hope market
forces are strong enough to pre
vent eligible consumers from
having to pay for the Universi
ty's mistakes.
I would go so far as to hope
prices could be lowered on this
unfortunate project. Perhaps
people who are eligible and have
not purchased a unit should
form a buyer's committee to
negotiate prices with Summers.

Contrary to general belief, the
boycott by the United Farmwor
kers (UFW) is still going strong
and has international support. In
the past year, through the hard
work of many dedicated peole,
the UFW has succeeded in win
ning election rights to give the
workers a secret ballot vote for
the first time in union history —
a vote most of us have taken for
granted.
The Teamsters Union has con
tinued its efforts to violently de
prive the UFW of the UFW's
freedom to vote and strike. The
reason for this action is to allow
Teamster workers to move from
job to job, grabbing as much
money as they can get and deny
ing any employment to many
UFW workers.
The Teamsters have made
contracts with big growers, in
cluding Gallo, to hire UFW
workers during the on-season of
the crops, and then to force them
to migrate elsewhere. When the
workers leave, they cannot find
employment.
The Teamsters have taken all
the jobs.
The boycott is extremely im
portant for continuation of the
UFW's political battle for the
survival of its members. I urge
everyone to boycott all Modesto
wines —Gallo controls them all
— as well as Iceberg lettuce and
non-union grapes.
Look on wine bottle labels for
the stamp of one money
grubbing, insensate, capitalist
grape grower.

work of many dedicated peole,
the UFW has succeeded in win
ning election rights to give the
workers a secret ballot vote for
the first time in union history —
a vote most of us have taken for
granted.
The Teamsters Union has con
tinued its efforts to violently de
prive the UFW of the UFW's
freedom to vote and strike. The
reason for this action is to allow
Teamster workers to move from
job to job, grabbing as much
money as they can get and deny
ing any employment to many
UFW workers.
The Teamsters have made
contracts with big growers, in
cluding Gallo, to hire UFW
workers during the on-season of
the crops, and then to force them
to migrate elsewhere. When the
workers leave, they cannot find
employment.
The Teamsters have taken all
the jobs.
The boycott is extremely im
portant for continuation of the
UFW's political battle for the
survival of its members. I urge
everyone to boycott all Modesto
wines —Gallo controls them all
— as well as Iceberg lettuce and
non-union grapes.
Look on wine bottle labels for
the stamp of one money
grubbing, insensate, capitalist
grape grower.

Congratulations to Charlie
Hall and Mark Albertson for
their thoughtful Jan. 15 Daily ar
ticle on the Pearce Mitchell con
dominiums.
As owner of a townhouse in
another community, 1 am more
disdainful of the Mitchell pro
ject than many of the people in
terviewed because of the missed
opportunity to serve some ur
gent housing needs of the Stan
ford community.
I submit the following as an
addition to the items explored in
the article:
—Site utilization is very poor.
The only useful common area is
in the center of the project.
Fewer than 25 percent of the
units overlook it or have direct
access.
—Patio areas do not have di
rect access to common areas.
—Most patios will not seat, in
comfort, more than four people
and there is minimal space for
growing flowers or shrubs.
—Traffic and parking are in
ternal to the project.
—There is significant price
inconsistency between one and
two bedroom units.
—Was land value included in
the price of each unit? If so, how
can the land rental fee be so
high? If not, how can the price of
each unit be so high?
According to the article, Di
rector of Faculty-Staff Housing
Robert Summers believes prices
may have to be raised if the units
are not sold by next summer.
Even with limited eligibility for
these units, I would hope market
forces are strong enough to pre
vent eligible consumers from
having to pay for the Universi
ty's mistakes.
I would go so far as to hope
prices could be lowered on this
unfortunate project. Perhaps
people who are eligible and have
not purchased a unit should
form a buyer's committee to
negotiate prices with Summers.
