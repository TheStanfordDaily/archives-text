# Revise advisor system
## 
### 
Faced with the apparently sudden reality of
graduate and professional school applications,
many students come to the harsh realization that
three years at Stanford have failed to sufficiently
acquaint them with their professors to have pro
fessors write them letters of recommendation. Un
fortunately, the consequences are inevitably a
frantic scramble for what prove to be meaningless
recommendations and diminished chances of ac
ceptance into graduate programs.
This deplorable situation partially results from
the failure of many students to take sufficient in
itiative in getting to know faculty members. Office
hours are often written down and quickly forgot
ten. A large number of undergaduates fail to take
advantage of the many opportunities for indi
vidual research and independent study at Stan
ford. which afford close interaction with faculty.
Nevertheless, the student is not the only party
responsible. The preponderance of large lecture
classes at Stanford, particularly in the sciences,
most certainly inhibits student-faculty interac
tion. In addition, the active outside research in
terests of many professors often limits their time
commitments on the undergraduate population.
However, by far the greatest contributor to the

David Sartoris

problems is the inadequacy oftheadvising system
at Stanford. As freshman, for example, students
may rarely see their advisors.
Thus, many freshmen lack the vital guidance
necessary to effectively break into their new envi
ronment. Relying predominantly upon his
classmates for academic information (and misin
formation), he may eventually drift into a particu
lar department and declare a major.
Many departments assign advisors to new
majors, a procedure which is likely to result in
incompatibility; others allow students to choose
their advisors, but many feel intimidated about
initiating such a relationship. Pre-professional
advising through the Academic Information
Center is excellent, but it again requires student
incentive and is not run by faculty members.
Clearly, a more stringent selection process for
freshman advisors capable of forming strong rela
tionships with students is needed. The impor
tance of getting to know faculty members should
be emphasized early, and the advisor should en
deavor to instill within the student the confidence
necessary for this task.
