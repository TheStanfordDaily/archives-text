## Spring battle: dispelling the pre-med myth 
### MARC ZASADA 
It's winter, and a new batch of
Stanford pre-meds is polishing
up its armor in preparation for
the annual Battle of Medical
School Applications to be fought
this spring. At the same time,
last year's combatants are just
beginning to receive the results
ol their struggles in the preced
ing encounter.
The ever-prevalent pre-med
stereotype is a myth that has
changed considerably over the
years. In bygone days, the pre
medical student was thought of
as a gentlemanly young scholar
in a white frock coat, posing
nobly before a statue of Albert
Schweitzer. Today, however, we
look upon pre-meds as neither
gentlemen nor scholars; but as
dull, bookish drudges or vicious
carnivores (red-hots, to use the
colloquial). Stereotypes may
change, but rarely for the better.
In actuality, the Stanford pre
med is a diverse as any other
pre-professional group. Many

have chosen humanities or so
cial science majors. As Stanford
Pre-Medical Society President
Hill Caswell puts it, "Pre
medicine is just a part of your
curriculum, and not a lifestyle —
a strong individual will make a
good physician."
One senior in microbiology,
now accepted to medical school,
disagrees: "... the stereotype is
true," he said, "my pre-med
friends are, for the most part,
grinds. I hate to tell my other
friends my major, because they
immediately think 'pre-med'
and I am categorized with the
rest of those guys."
Another already accepted
senior agrees with Caswell, say
ing, "That stereotype is a lot of
bull . . . of course we hit the
books a lot, but so does every
other student at Stanford,"
The question has no comforta
ble solution.
Mythical road
But dispelling popular myths
about the difficulties of getting

into medical school should be
encouraged for those of you
thinking of embarking on that
treacherous road.
According to Assoc. Anatomy
Prof. Donald Stilwell, one sim
ply doesn't need a 3.7 or 4.0 to
get into medical school. The av
erage at the better schools is only
3.5 or so, and Stilwell claims he
regularly fields successful can
didates with 3.0 and 3.2 aver
ages. In addition, brillant per
formance on the MCAT (Medical
College Admissions Test) is not
at all mandatory, Stilwell notes.

"The MCAT is only a minimum
threshold," he says.
St il well disagrees strongly
with the notion that pre-meds
must be biology or chemistry
majors. "A non-science major is
often preferred by medical
schools, he claims, "because the
student has a broad
background."
He adds that "hospital work
. . . is pointless, unless you are
sincere about it."
Paranoia scares pre-meds into
applying to 25 or more schools.
Most Stanford candidates are
advised to apply to between 12
and 14 carefully chosen medical
schools.
Horror tales
Also termed ridiculous by
both Stilwell and pre-medical
students are the horror stories
told about interviews and visits
to medical schools.
A popular story tells of an in

terviewer at a large northeastern
college who tried to disconcert
candidates by asking them to
open a window he has previ
ously nailed shut. Although
most pre-meds will tell you that
interviews simply aren't like
that, each seems to have an
"amusing"storv of his own.
One senior describes an inter
view he had at a Texas college.
Immediately after sitting down,
the interviewer began asking
him seriously, " . . . if I thought I
was psychologically disturbed,
if I took drugs. He even asked if I

liked boys better than girls. 1 just
broke out laughing. If it hadn't
been my first interview, I might
have walked right out of the
place."
A senior in biology told of an
interview he had at Harvard
Medical School: "The guy
started asking for my opinions
on highly controversial issues;
like mass health care delivery
and euthanasia — and then ar
gued with me about my
answers."

Often, say. candidates, the in
terviews are conducted by
psychiatrists or psychologists.
Teachers' pet?
But the red-hot image dies
hard. Whenever a pre-med is
seen speaking to an instructor
after class, one automatically
jumps to the conclusion that he
is trying to butter-up the teacher
in hopes of securing a favorable
recommendation to medical
school. Pre-meds unanimously
argue against this notion. Al

though many admit the thought
crosses their minds, on occasion,
such a practice would be more
debasing than even a pre-med
could stand.
"We're not animals," one
junior says angrily.
Another encouraging word is
that pre-meds may in fact go to
an overseas campus at anytime
— th(!re is no required sequence
that cannot be worked around —
but the matter should be
thoroughly discussed with a
pre-med advisor. In addition,
taking the MCAT overseas is no
disadvantage.
The competition issue is a
touchy one. Most pre-meds
admit there is a certain amount
of competition at Stanford, but
all are quick to declare their in
nocence of any such condition.
The prevailing attitude is that
one must compete with oneself
for excellence.
And finally, that all
encompassing myth which
states that the difficulty of get
ting into medical school nowa
days is prohibitive, and not
worth the effort: a national study
shows that the number of
applicants to medical school ac
tually declined last year, after a
decade-long rise. And further
more, although the nation-wide
rate of acceptance is about 20
percent, Stanford students have
a yearly success rate of between
F>() and 60 percent.
So perhaps your tuition is not
being wasted.

RED HOT? —No. this isn't some unfortunate pre-med who burned himself out studying for his
MCAT. However his medical school interview was a harrowing experience.

MEDICAL MYTH—Most pre-meds complain that they're stereotyped as either spending all their
time in the library or the lah. Not so, they claim. In fact, you don't even have to be a biology or
chemistry major to get into medical school.
