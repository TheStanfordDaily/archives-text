I would like to knoiv \\ hether I can become a Stanford Woman. My
boy friend is coterminal. so does he technically qualify as a senior?
I don't want (o moke the journey to the middle of the Quad at
midnight until I'm sure my transformation will be legally valid
-E.S.I I.
In a not-so-liberated opinion. President Richard Lyman
suggested that depriving the coterminal students of their rights to
create Stanford Women would be violating the Fifth and 14th
Amendments â€” which guarantee that no person may be deprived
of life, liberty or property without due process of law,
I hnvever, our law school sources disagree. The two amendments
do forbid seizure of private property,but only by the federal and
state governments. And our sources doubt that there are sufficient
"government links" to cover the Stanford ad mi nistration under the
amendments (although H. Bruce Franklin would undoubtedly dis
agree).
On the other hand, our legal authorities maintain that although
not .1 constitutional problem, the whole thing may be a criminal
offense.
In retrospect. I would advise you to settle for a coterminal lackey.
After all, he's better than nothing and you don't want to remain a
"Stanford Girl" all your life.
For the uninitiated, becoming a Stanford Woman is actually
quite simple. You must be kissed by a Stanford senior at 12 mid
night. under a full moon, in the middle of the Quad. And to make
the whole process just too cute for words, the next full moon is on
Valentine's Day!
As one who has stood the test, I can testify that it's a truly
heartwarming experience. You'll never be quite the same again.
