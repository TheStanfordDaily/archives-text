# Professors advocate change
## Present educational system cultivates conservatism 
### PAT NOONAN 
(-ailing for changes in the
focus of education and the pro
cesses in which it is carried out,
three professors spoke on "The
University of Future." last week
as part of Disorientation Week.
Assoc. Education Prof. Martin
Carnoy said the University
maintains a "veneer of question
ing and criticism of society," but
uses this facade to legitimize its
operation and to deemphasize
its function of providing a con
sumer good. He claimed that the
nation's present educational sys
tem produces people trained to
preserve the social order.
Carnoy predicted that in a few
years the conception of higher
education will be analogous to
the present secondary school
system. On an undergraduate
level, public colleges will fill tin;
role that high schools presently
have, turning out graduates who
are not guaranteed of a job, and

who tailor their curriculum to fit
the needs of the job market. Pri
vate universities like Stanford
will be like prep schools, for the
elite who can afford it, Carnoy
said.
He said further that today's
students should deemphasize
outside issues like Angola and
focus on "the ripping off they're
receiving here." Students
should evaluatetheir roleand re
lation to the University, why
they're here, what they plan to
get out of school and what they
plan to do afterwards.
Theodore Roszak, a professor
of history at Cal State Hayward,
said that our educational system
should be developing the entire
personality; spiritual, aesthetic,
physical and artistic facets as
well as intellectual ones. He said
that universities today develop
the "eyes, ears and forebrain
only." and these primarily in a
manner to perform the functions

society desires for its mainte
nance. He said he felt that
changes must be implemented
from elementary school and con
tinuing through college, rather
than attempting to shape a
whole person, beginning at age
18.
He also said that universities
today are allocator's of "human
mannequins" which are trained
to perpetuate the society's in
dustrial structure. Asst. History
Prof. Clay Carson said that the
educational system must change
from its process of conditioning
people to be motivated bv exter
nal rewards such as grades, or
the job they will receive upon
graduation. This prepares stu
dents to view their life work in
the same way â€” primarily as a
means of obtaining material
sustenance, rather than as an ac
tivity they enjoy and would pur
sue for its own sake, he said.
