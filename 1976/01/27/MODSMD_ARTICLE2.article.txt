# Public took energy for granted until crisis, says EPRI official
## 
### RON BECK 
Until the 1973 energy crisis, the
Ameican public took energy, "the na
tion's most fundamental need," tor
granted, Chauncey Starr, president of
the Electrical Power Research Institute
(EPRI), told an audience of about 75
people yesterday.
Starr, speaking in a lecture series
sponsored by the School of Earth Sci
ences, said that consumer commodity
prices are directly related to energy
costs.
"There is a relationship of world
wide prices of goods and services fun
damental to our society with the price
of fuel," he said.
Positive correlation
Starr displayed charts showing a
positive correlation between 1973
hikes in the price of petroleum and the
price changes in food, industrial mate
rials and manufactured goods.
"In terms of importance of viability
to society, fuel is the most important
thing after food," he said. "It used to be
thought of as a free good, though â€”
like water."
According to Starr, societal de

velopment is a direct function of
energy development. An example of
this link, he said, is the introduction of
petroleum-generated electricity to the
United States.
Literacy level
"The first thing bringing in oil did
was to raise the literacy level. The
whole education of the United States
was altered by the ability of people to
read at night."
Even though new energy sources
ordinarily precede technological in
novations. there are some instances
where technology waits for more fuel
sources Starr said. The internal com
bustion engine "s;it around for about
100 years" before gasoline was com
mercially available to make the en
gine's operation feasible, he said.
Continuous problem
The worry of impending energy
shortages has plagued societies for
centuries, but science has always come
up with a solution, Starr said.
"I don't like to accept the voice of
doom as inevitable," he said in answer
to a question about limited energy

supplies, "and the history of man
shows that doom is not inevitable.
There has always benn a way out."
When questioned as to the prudence
of depending on future technological
innovations, Starr replied that the only
other choice of avoiding future energy
shortages is through changing the pre
sent social structure.
'Last resort'
Changing society, however, "should
he a last resort," he said.
"I don't think there's an absolute
position where you have to say "We
don't know the future so we have to
reorganize." because we may not need
to reorganize."
Starr, 63, received his PhD in elec
trical engineering from Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute in New York in
1935 and has been president of the
Palo Alto-based EPRI since I Prior
to his appointment as president of the
research institute, he was the dean of
the IJCI.A School of Engineering and
Applied Sciences.
EPRI is funded through voluntary
assessments of all utilities, pubic and
private.
