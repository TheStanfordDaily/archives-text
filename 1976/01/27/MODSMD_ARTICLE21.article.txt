## Stanford musicians: Baroque to Modern and Bach Joyce Johnson explores neglected musical byways 
### RICHARD CROSS 
Noted Bay Area trumpetress Joyce Johnson and
friends explored some neglected byways of 18th
century music last Tuesday night at Dinkelspiel
Auditoriu m.
During the evening Johnson played three diffe
rent kinds of trumpets, including a valveless
Baroque trumpet.
She was assisted by an accomplished contin
gent of local musicians, including William Ben
jamin, oboe, Susan Willoughby, bassoon, Kari
Windingstad, soprano, Susan Freier and Patrice
Anderson, violins, Kenneth Harrison, viola,
Timothy Bach,cello,and Bruce Lamott, continuo.
Shakey beginning
Johnson opened tin; program with Johann Mel
choir Molter's "Concerto No. 1 in D major tor
Trumpet, Strings and Continuo." After a shakey
beginning, trumpet and strings settled down to a
warmer and more confident rendition of the sec
ond and third movements.
One was continually impressed by the techni
cal difficulties of the trumpet part — especially
the perversely difficult lip trills — both in Mol
ter's workand again in the Bach "Cantata No. 51."
Stringsand continuo were then joined by oboist
William Benjamin in the most musically satisfy
ing effort of theevening— George Phillip Tele
mann's "Concerto in C minor for Oboe, Strings
and Continuo."
Tonal control
Benjamin's tonal control, the deftness and
beauty of his phrasing and t he overall intelligence
of his interpretation were uncanny.
The suavity of his style seemed to rub off on the
strings, who joined their soloist with more assur
ance than at any other time during the concert.
Johann Sebastian Bach's "Cantata No. 51,

'Jauchzet Gott' " was less brilliantly rendered.
Considering that soloist kari Windingstad
came in cold to sing her very demanding soprano
part, however, the piece was played remarkably
well.
Windingstad displayed a round, lilting voice
that was mildly uneasy in her lower register. The
strings began the first recitative too slowly and
Windingstad struggled gracefully to speed things
up until the cello and continuo entered and estab
lished the right tempo.
But by theuJJeieuia things had mended nicely,
and the result was a crowd-pleasing, if unsubtle,
finale.
Arduous
Giuseppe Torelli's brief "Sonata No. 5 in D
major for Trumpet, Strings and Continuo" al
lowed Johnson to demonstrate the arduousness of
the original Baroque trumpeters' task.
Performing the work with a valveless Baroque
trumpet, Johnson gave what was as much an ath
letic as a musical display.
The last work of the evening was Francesco
Biscogli's "Concerto in D major for Trumpet,
Oboe and Bassoon." Trivia experts will want to
remember this obscure Italian, who is known to us
solely through this work.
Obscurity
As Johnson remarked, he went to France for a
vacation, wrote his concerto, and died.
Listeners were invited to make of the work what
they would. It is written in a way that is both
clever and odd, but not exactly arresting.
The ensemble — violins, viola, cello, continuo,
oboe, bassoon and trumpet — gave the work a
lively, pleasing rendition and demonstrated that
Biscogli's obscurity is really rather well-deserved.
