# Francesco Trio plays with spirit
## 
### MARC ZASADA 
Last Sunday The Francesco
Trio, resident musicians at Stan
ford, performed their "Beet
hoven Plus" series to an ap
preciative crowd at Dinkelspiel
Auditoriu m.
The group, composed of vio
linist David Abel, cellist Bonnie
Hampton and pianist Nathan
Schwartz, gave a highly musical
performance, marked by discip
line and sustained technical ex
cellence.
First on the program was
"Trio, Op. 1, No. 2 inG major" by
Beethoven. The piece got oil to
an uneven start but smoothed
out as the artists warmed up.
Abel set the standard for the
group, as lu' did all afternoon,
with an exceptionally expres
sive interpretation that served to
counter a somewhat mechanical
execution by the piano.
Hampton displayed her ta
lents with an enjoyable light
touch on the cello,
The final movement, Presto, is
a masterful mixture of humerous
violin and cello exchanges and a
driving piano background.
Performed superbly by
Hampton and Abel, the pianist
was somewhat of a disappoint
ment.
This was followed by a Pro
kofieff Sonata, "Op. 94 for Violin
and Piano," rendered magnifi

cently by Abel uiul Schwartz.
This piece gave Abel a chance
to display some graceful gym
nastics on the violin. His in
terpretation was appropriately
emotional, but tightly control
led, and he won the enthusiastic
support of the audience.
A bit of humor followed as
Hampton and guest bassoonist
Susan YVilloughby performed
the "Diaphonic Suite No. 2
(1930") for cello and bassoon by
Ruth (Irawford-Seeger (1901-
1953).
"Diaphonic" is aptly descrip
tive of this brief work, which
pairs the two instruments in
seemingly unrelated melodies. ,
Bowing to the sensibilities of the
audience, the musicians per- .
formed as an encore an equally
short piece bv Bizet, composed
in 1H74.
The trio joined forces for the
finale, Beethoven's "Trio, Op.
70, No. 2 in E flat major." An
adequate rendition of the first
movement, Poca Sostenuto-
Allegro /no non froppo, was fol
lowed by a truly stunning Aleg
retto. The group really shone on
this one, in a powerful and mov
ing interpretation.
The final movement, Allegro,
served both to accentuate Abel's
talents, and top off an entertain
ing afternoon.

the "Diaphonic Suite No. 2
(1930") for cello and bassoon by
Ruth (Irawford-Seeger (1901-
1953).
"Diaphonic" is aptly descrip
tive of this brief work, which
pairs the two instruments in
seemingly unrelated melodies. ,
Bowing to the sensibilities of the
audience, the musicians per- .
formed as an encore an equally
short piece bv Bizet, composed
in 1H74.
The trio joined forces for the
finale, Beethoven's "Trio, Op.
70, No. 2 in E flat major." An
adequate rendition of the first
movement, Poca Sostenuto-
Allegro /no non froppo, was fol
lowed by a truly stunning Aleg
retto. The group really shone on
this one, in a powerful and mov
ing interpretation.
The final movement, Allegro,
served both to accentuate Abel's
talents, and top off an entertain
ing afternoon.
Last Sunday The Francesco
Trio, resident musicians at Stan
ford, performed their "Beet
hoven Plus" series to an ap
preciative crowd at Dinkelspiel
Auditoriu m.
The group, composed of vio
linist David Abel, cellist Bonnie
Hampton and pianist Nathan
Schwartz, gave a highly musical
performance, marked by discip
line and sustained technical ex
cellence.
First on the program was
"Trio, Op. 1, No. 2 inG major" by
Beethoven. The piece got oil to
an uneven start but smoothed
out as the artists warmed up.
Abel set the standard for the
group, as lu' did all afternoon,
with an exceptionally expres
sive interpretation that served to
counter a somewhat mechanical
execution by the piano.
Hampton displayed her ta
lents with an enjoyable light
touch on the cello,
The final movement, Presto, is
a masterful mixture of humerous
violin and cello exchanges and a
driving piano background.
Performed superbly by
Hampton and Abel, the pianist
was somewhat of a disappoint
ment.
This was followed by a Pro
kofieff Sonata, "Op. 94 for Violin
and Piano," rendered magnifi

cently by Abel uiul Schwartz.
This piece gave Abel a chance
to display some graceful gym
nastics on the violin. His in
terpretation was appropriately
emotional, but tightly control
led, and he won the enthusiastic
support of the audience.
A bit of humor followed as
Hampton and guest bassoonist
Susan YVilloughby performed
