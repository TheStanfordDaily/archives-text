# 'The Sty of the Blind Pig'
## An uncomfortable dramatic failure 
### MARC ZASADA 
The Sty of the Blind Pig. a pro
duction of the Black Performing
Arts Committee, opened last
Wednesday to a meager audi
ence.
Phillip Hays Dean's play por
trays a black family in Chicago
just before the civil rights
movement of the 19505. The
story centers around the unful
filled life of a downtrodden
young black woman, the hostil
ity between her and her mother
and t he intrusion of a blind street
singer named Jordan.
Despite a valiant effort by cast
and crew, the production failed
to make a dramatic impression
on the audience, which found
the story and its characters lack
ing in the credibility so essential
to good theater.
Most dramatic
Margo Richmond as a daugh
ter. Alberta, gave the most
dramatic and professional per
formance of the evening, ham
pered only by the uninspired di
rection of John Cochran, who
made her character into some
thing static and inhuman.
Throughout the play. Alberta
never deviated from the same
annoyingly anxious mood,
never smiling, never comforta
ble, always fidgeting and frown
ing — even on her humorous
lines.
By far the most convincing
character was "Blind" Jordan,
played superbly by Carlyle Kin
nison, who managed a dynamic
characterization while main
taining a truly believable
"blindness."
Uncomfortable dialogue
Marie Rolle was also ex
tremely enjoyable as the old

mother. Weedy. If she was un
comfortable with some of the
dialogue, she may be excused;
the fault most likely lies with the
dialogue. The audience was de
lighted by both her comedy and
drama and her enthusiasm often
saved on otherwise tedious
scene.
Marvin Anderson did a more
than adequate job with the role
of Doc, the cynical brother of
Weedy, but he too was rendered
dramatically impotent by the
static direction of Cochran, who
destroyed the character's hu
manity. Anderson was never al
lowed to drop his wry smile and
the effect was less than convinc
ing.
Lack of purpose
Unfortunately, even an
adequate director could not have
saved this play. The plot suffers
from an extraordinary lack of
purpose and destination, as if
the author changed his mind
many times in its writing. This
introduces a fraudulant quality
that no amount of good acting or
direction could overcome.
In an attempt to infuse the play
with a significance it did not
contain. Dean also has added
some patent theatrical gimmicks
which only serve to further be
labor the audience's gullibility.
As a symbol of the Devil, Jor
dan is able to magically predict
winning "numbers" combina
tions for Doc. In addition. Jor
dan's life's purpose is to search
for a person significantly named
Crace Waters. He and Alberta in
fact go wandering about Chicago
knocking on doors in a symbolic
search for this "person." One
wonders why they don't simply
look her up in the phone book.

Other tired gimmicks crowd
the work. Doc makes a fortune in
the numbers only to lose it in a
street mugging; Alberta is con
sumed by an unrequited love for
a dead pilot; and puritanical
Weedy is discovered in an illicit
affair with the local preacher.
The climax of the play is to
tally unsatisfying. There is an
emotional revelation by Jordan,
who tells of a bordello he sang in
down South, called "The Stv of

the Blind Pig." This had some
crushing significance tor Al
berta that the audience never
quite understood.
The play ends with a rehash of
that ancient theatrical twist —
Alberta is turned into a carbon
copy of her mother, her rebellion
crushed.
The Sty of the Blind Pig con
tinues at the Little Theater to
night through Saturday.

"blindness."
Uncomfortable dialogue
Marie Rolle was also ex
tremely enjoyable as the old

mother. Weedy. If she was un
comfortable with some of the
dialogue, she may be excused;
the fault most likely lies with the
dialogue. The audience was de
lighted by both her comedy and
drama and her enthusiasm often
saved on otherwise tedious
scene.
Marvin Anderson did a more
than adequate job with the role
of Doc, the cynical brother of
Weedy, but he too was rendered
dramatically impotent by the
static direction of Cochran, who
destroyed the character's hu
manity. Anderson was never al
lowed to drop his wry smile and
the effect was less than convinc
ing.
Lack of purpose
Unfortunately, even an
adequate director could not have
saved this play. The plot suffers
from an extraordinary lack of
purpose and destination, as if
the author changed his mind
many times in its writing. This
introduces a fraudulant quality
that no amount of good acting or
direction could overcome.
In an attempt to infuse the play
with a significance it did not
contain. Dean also has added
some patent theatrical gimmicks
which only serve to further be
labor the audience's gullibility.
As a symbol of the Devil, Jor

dan's life's purpose is to search
for a person significantly named
Crace Waters. He and Alberta in
fact go wandering about Chicago
knocking on doors in a symbolic
search for this "person." One

look her up in the phone book.

Other tired gimmicks crowd
the work. Doc makes a fortune in
the numbers only to lose it in a
street mugging; Alberta is con
sumed by an unrequited love for
a dead pilot; and puritanical
Weedy is discovered in an illicit
affair with the local preacher.
The climax of the play is to
tally unsatisfying. There is an
emotional revelation by Jordan,
who tells of a bordello he sang in
down South, called "The Stv of

the Blind Pig." This had some
crushing significance tor Al
berta that the audience never
quite understood.
The play ends with a rehash of
that ancient theatrical twist —
Alberta is turned into a carbon
copy of her mother, her rebellion
crushed.

Phillip Hays Dean's play por
trays a black family in Chicago
just before the civil rights
movement of the 19505. The
story centers around the unful
filled life of a downtrodden
young black woman, the hostil
ity between her and her mother
and t he intrusion of a blind street
singer named Jordan.
Despite a valiant effort by cast
and crew, the production failed
to make a dramatic impression
on the audience, which found
the story and its characters lack
ing in the credibility so essential
to good theater.
Most dramatic
Margo Richmond as a daugh
ter. Alberta, gave the most
dramatic and professional per
formance of the evening, ham
pered only by the uninspired di
rection of John Cochran, who
made her character into some
thing static and inhuman.
Throughout the play. Alberta
never deviated from the same
annoyingly anxious mood,
never smiling, never comforta
ble, always fidgeting and frown
ing — even on her humorous
lines.
By far the most convincing
character was "Blind" Jordan,
played superbly by Carlyle Kin
nison, who managed a dynamic
characterization while main
taining a truly believable
"blindness."
