# 'The Three Sisters'
## Like real life 
### BOB HENRY 
According to Anton Chekov, "A play should be written in which
people arrive, go away, have dinner, talk, about the weather and
play cards. Life must be exactly as it is."
His The Three Sisters, now being performed in Old Town, bos
Gatos, by the California Actors Theatre (CAT), follows his
guidelines perhaps too well.
Chekov has blended elements of comedy, tragedy and melod
rama in his tale of deterioration of a family and their estate and
director James Dunn has emphasized all aspects well; the play is
funny and sad. humorous and moving, almost simultaneously.
Chekov tempers two affairs, one attempted suicide, a death by
duel and a huge fire with a time span of three years, so instead of
becoming "All My Children," the action retains its credibility.
CAT's production stresses everyday life amid these calamities.
"We must go on." the characters repeat.
Somehow Chekov has sharply defined almost a dozen characters
in the play. The audience feels it knows the distinct individuals
and thus the daily routines of coming, going, eating, discussing the
weather and playing cards become important.
The script contains no "star" and admirable ensemble acting
overcomes sometimes turgid pacing.The sisters Olga. Masha.and
Irina are well played by Peggy Schoditsch, Carolyn Reed and Joan
Pirkle.
Victor Pappas (as Andrey Sergeivich) does a fine deterioration â€”
changing from a man who dreams of being a university professor to
cuckolded husband who loses in gambling and whose only source
of esteem is his membership on the town council.
The Three Sisters runs through Feb. 1.
