U.S. vetoes Mideast resolve
UNITED NATIONS — The United States vetoed a
U.N. Security Council resolution yesterday that fa
vored creation of a Palestinian state and called for
an Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territ
ory.
The veto, which was expected, was the 13th cast
by the U.S. and the fourth dealing with the Middle
East. U.S. Ambassador Daniel Moynihan argued
that the resolution would undermine Mideast
peace efforts.
The vote in the 15-member council was 9 to 1
with three abstentions, China and Libya not par
ticipating.
Britain, Italy and Sweden abstained after the
council rejected a British-offered amendment. The
amendment would have softened the resolution by
saying nothing in the measure was meant to super
sede two council resolutions adopted in 1967 and
1973 that provided the structure for peace negotia
tions.
Moynihan said the veto was not cast lightly but
"our responsibility to seek further progress toward
iin over-all peace settlement in the Middle East
required us, even il we stood alone, to preserve the
framework for negotiations" established by the
1967 and 1973 resolutions.
The balloting climaxed a two-week debate that
was boycotted by Israel after the council invited the
Palestine Liberation Organization to participate.
Lebanon cease-fire enforced
BEIRUIT — Cease-fire "enforcer teams" toured
Beirut yesterday using bullhorns to urge rival
gunmen to clear the streets. Despite the aura of
impending peace, Christian concern mounted over
the growing Palestinian role in Lebanon.

Looters also made off with $1 million worth of
cigarettes from a government depot and other
gunmen sacked the Agriculture and Justice Minis
tries without meeting any resistance.
The sackings were exceptions to a general tight
ening of order across Lebanon, whereabout 10,000
persons have died in civil bloodshed since April.
The general feeling in Beirut was that the worst of
the civil war is over. However, the country re
mained virtually partitioned between heavily
armed Moslem and Christian camps with a political
settlement on paper only.
The "enforcer teams" — made up of Palestine
Liberation Army troops in Moslem areas and
right-wing Christian militias in Christian areas —
worked toward a deadline of this evening for resto
ration of law and order.
The 0 p.m. — 8 a.m. PST — deadline for with
drawal of the gunmen was set Sunday by a commit
tee of Syrian, Palestinian and Lebanese army offic
ers set up to enforce the four-davold cease-fire
worked out by Syrian Foreign Minister Abdul
Halim Khaddam.
Under the truce plan. Lebanon's 00 percent Mos
lem majority is to get a bigger share of political and
economic power in the country, now concentrated
in the hands of the Christian minority. So far this
has not been implemented.
House panel releases report
WASHINGTON — Congress' ability to get and
keep unlimited secrets came under attack from both
the Ford administration and some congressmen
yesterday as details of the House Intelligence
Committee's final report became public.
The report says U.S. intelligence costs about $10
billion a year and says some covert operations
sometimes have been ordered by presidents and
their staffs over CIA and State Department opposi
tion.
It says then-president Richard Nixon, for exam
ple. directed the CIA to support Kurdish rebels in
Iraq over objections from the CIA, Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger and the State Department.
The House committee set to work yesterday on
proposed recommendations including one to
abolish a major Pentagon intelligence agency and
another to create a permanent House intelligence
committee.

CIA Director William Colby called a late after
noon news conference, reportedly to criticize pub
lic disclosure of secret operations in connection
with release of the House report.
Without expressing criticism of Congress, FBI
Director Clarence kelley told a Senate committee
that increased congressional supervision could
jeopardize his agency's investigative ability.
"The establishment of unlimited access of con
gressmen to FBI secrets could seriously jeopardize
the flow of volunteer information which is the life
blood of our investigative organization," Kelly
said.
Nigeria evacuates laborers
LACOS, Nigeria — Nigeria is evacuating 45,000
contract laborers from Equatorial Cuinea because of
what it calls a long history of "brutal ill treatment"
of its citizens there.
Since the middle of last year about 20,000 Nige
rians, nearly all working on the island of Malabo, 60
miles south of the Nigerian coast, have been repat
riated at government expense.
Officials say another 25,000 are waiting to come
home and are being harassed, beaten and even kil
led as Equatorial Cuineans retaliate against the
withdrawal and apparently try to restrict it.
Nigeria charged that 11 Nigerians died as a result
of an "unprovoked attack" on them by Guinean
troops who invaded the Nigerian Embassy grounds
in the island capital of Santa Isabel earlier this
month.
The evacuation of Nigerians from the former
Spanish colony is bound to deal a severe blow to the
already impoverished Guinean economy.
Their return to Nigeria also presents the Nigerian
government with the major task of absorbing them
into the oil-rich nation's economy.
It has decided to employ all of those returning on
existing state farms and create 12 new ones around
the nation to absorb them. The total cost of the plan
is $480 million.
Ford: 1979 tax cuts possible
WASHINGTON — Declaring that "the future
should be encouraging for all Americans," Presi
dent Ford told Congress yesterday that another
major tax cut will be possible by 1979 if federal
spending is held in check.
The reduction would be in addition to the $28
billion in permanent tax reductions Ford has al
ready proposed for this year and next. He did not
indicate how large a new tax cut could be.
In his annual economic report to Congress, Ford
said he is "very encouraged about our economy.
The trends are all right and are all moving in the
right direction."
Ford's optimistic assessment of the economy did
not extend to unemployment, which "will almost
surely remain distressingly high this year," his
economic advisers wrote in the report.
"Even under the best of circumstances the return
to full employment cannot realistically be ac
complished this year or next," they said.
They forecast an unemployment rate of about 7.5
percent by the end of 1976, down from 8.3 percent
in December of 1975.
Judge's ruling benefits labor
WASHINGTON — A federal judge rided yester
day that the legal-aid arm of the National Right to
Work Committee operates as a front for employers
who are trying to weaken unions. The ruling is
considered by labor leaders to be a major victory for
organized labor.
U.S. District Judge Charles Richey said that
among the organization's financial contributors are
"employers who have concrete interest" in law
suits against unions which the National Right to
Work Legal Defense and Education Fund encour
ages and supports.
The judge scheduled a hearing Feb. 20 to allow
the foundation an opportunity to show cause why
he should not issue an injunction barring the group
from accepting contributions from interested

employers.
Rickey acted after the foundation rejected his
repeated orders to disclose to unions the names of a
sampling of the financial contributors.
The Right to Work Committee is a lobbying group
that has been a strong opponent of organized labor,
principally in the fight against the union shop, in
which workers are required to join unions. With its
companion legal-aid arm, the committee spends
millions of dollars lobbying and aiding in lawsuits
against unions.
Busing begins in Detroit
DETROIT — Detroit began the first stage of a
court-ordered school integration program without
incident yesterday, but the struggle over busing
continued in Boston with new disturbances at two
high schools.
In Pittsburgh, meanwhile, teachers voted on a
contract agreement to end their 57-day strike and a
school board spokesman said the city's 62,000
pupils would be called back to class immediately
after ratification. The teachers' union head said he
would recommend acceptance of the pact. Details
were not disclosed.
Thousands of black and white elementary school
pupils boarded buses in Detroit under the new
program, although there were scattered indications
of support for a "yellow flu" boycott urged by an
tibusing groups.
Only pupils from kindergarten through fifth
grade had classes yesterday. The older pupils will
resume classes and start the busing program today.
A little less than 10 percent of the city's 247,000
pupils will be bused under the new program.
Another 6200 pupils have been transferred to new
schools, but will not be bused.
Detroit is the largest city in the United States to
implement a court-ordered integration plan. About
75 percent of the pupils are black.
Pot has 'no lasting effects'
NEW YORK — Chronic marijuana use was found
not to be associated with any permanent or irrever
sible impairment in higher brain function or intel
ligence,a study of native Costa Ricans reported yes
terday.
The study results were said to be compatible with
earlier controlled studies, but went further by
employing additional controls. Researchers
cautioned, however, that a final answer is not yet
in.
The report, from researchers at the University of
Florida and the University of Victoria, said that the
findings lend no support to speculation concerning
an "amotivational syndrome" among chronic users
marked by such things as apathy, confusion, and
memory defects.
Details of the extensive study were reported to an
opening session of an international conference on
Chronic Cannabis Use, sponsored by the New York
Academy of Sciences and the National Institute on
Drug Abuse. Cannabis sativa is the Latin name for
the common marijuana plant.
After the initial selection of subjects and evalua
tion of tests in Costa Rica, an experimental group of
41 users and 41 matched controls was studied.
Users in the final sample consumed about nine
"joints" each day for an average of 17 years.
The findings of the study were based on the re
sults of statistical analysis of a wide variety of tests
that showed "essentially no significant differences
between users and non users on any of the neuro
psychological. intelligence or personality tests.
Furthermore, no relationship was found between
level of daily use and test performance.
Today's weather
Variable high cloudiness and patchy late night
and morning fog through tomorrow. Not so cold at
