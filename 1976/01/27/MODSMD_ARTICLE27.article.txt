# Married women add to work force
## 
### KATHLEEN McTIGUE 
Married women represent the
largest single addition to the work
force d 1" industrialized societies in the
past decade, according to Prof. Alice
Cook of the Cornell University School
of Industrial and Labor Relations.
Cook is currently scholar-in
residence at the Center for Research on
Women (CROW).
Although married women are in the
labor market to stay, they still
must care for a home and children in
addition to employment, Cook said.
Sex roles
"Provision of child-care facilities
and opportunities for part-time work
would greatly ease these burdens until
society redefines sex roles and paren
tal responsibilities." she added.
Because increasing numbers of
women will enter the labor force in
industrialized nations, the problem of
meeting their needs cannot be disre
garded. Cook emphasized.
"It cannot be swept under the rug or
stored in the closet. It is too large, too
rapidly growing, too insistent, too so
cially significant."
Federal subsidies
She suggested childcare facilities be
federally subsidized in the U.S. be
cause their costs are beyond the means
of most working-class families.
Cook said industrialized nations
have developed only one work pattern
â€” that of men working without inter
ruption from the end ol schooling until
retirement.
Women cannot conform to this
model, she said.
"If children are to be cared for by
parents for a given period, one parent
must be able to remain away from work
during that time. Most societies see no
alternative to the mother doing this."
Cook said although financial need
may cause a mother to enter the labor
force, mothers also work "because
they come to need a life outside the
home as well as inside it, if they are to
maintain emotional health."
Higher education tends to produce
more women interested in pursuing

careers, but it does little to prepare
women for the interrupted careers they
experience when raising children,
Cook said.
"When women interrupt work even
tor a few years, they become to some
degree estranged from work.they lose
some skill, and they inevitably fail to
keep abreast of changing technology
and progress."
Cook's analysis showed the husband
tends to spend very little time assisting
the working wife and mother with her
household and childcare chores.
Life styles
"However much the lifestyles of the
educated young married in Western
Europe, the U.S.. Australia, and even
Japan, may stress sharing and equal
opportunity, they have not yet begun
to throw statistical weight." Cook con
cluded.
Cook, who was a working mother
herself and single head of her family
for many years, is also the author of
The Working Mother, a nine-nation
study made possible by a Ford Found
ation grant.
CROWcoordinator Cynthia Davis,
commenting on The Working Mother.
said it "contains important statistics
and data never before compiled." con
cerning the impact women are having,
or will have, on the labor forces of de
veloped countries."
Davis said Cook will be? available to
speak with students and answer ques
tions at CROW's office until Friday.
CROW hopes to bring more women
to Stanford in the capacity of scholar
in-residence. Cook is the first in this
program.
