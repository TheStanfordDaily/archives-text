# Senate may curb authority of ASSU financial manager
## 
### LORI MATSUKAWA 
ASSU Senator Kevin McDermott,
chairman of the Senate Finance Com
mittee, presented a resolution limiting
the investment powers of the ASSU
Financial Manager at last night's
ASSU Senate meeting.
The senate approved a resolution
supporting a student protest at Chico
State University and also received re
ports from the Council of Presidents
(COP).
McDermott submitted his resolution
as part of an informal report on the
Finance Committee. He recommended
that senate funds be "turned over to a
professional management firm" for
investment under the direction of a
new committee.
New committee
The committee would be composed
of the ASSU Financial Manager, the
Finance Committee's chairman, a Bus
iness School professor familiar with
investment and two students.
The senate tabled the resolution
until the next meeting on Tuesday,
Feb. 10.
However, Sen. Bruce Resnick said,
"There's more here than meets the eye.
It seems that this (professional firm) is
just one more layer between the stu
dent body and student funds."
ASSU Financial Manager Chris
Cline replied the firm would "buy into
the market" for the ASSU but only ac
cording to guidelines and goals set up
by the ASSU committee.
"$250.000 is just too much for one
inexperienced manager to invest on
his own," said Cline.
Contract extension
The senate approved both a set of
guidelines to be used in determining
the disbursement of program fee as
sessment funds and a recommenda
tion that Cline work out a
commission-based summer contract
for ASSU Sepcial Events Director
Randy Phillips.
Phillips' contract is being extended

so he can deal with agents for the
Bicentennial events which may occur
here this summer.
Phillips, who now receives a com
mission and a $100 a month salary,
would thus receive "about $150 a
month" during the summer, Cline
said.
Chico resolution
Sen. Laura Best introuced a resolu
tion expressing ASSU support for the
Associated Students of Chico State
University.
Chico State students have been pro
testing since Dec. 3 the decision of the
chancellor of the California State Uni
versities and Colleges system to arm
campus police on all campuses in that
system.
Best's resolution was approved 12-3
with Senators Carole Houck, Bob Ot
tilie and McDermott dissenting.
"This resolution has absolutely no
thing to do with the students of Stan
ford University," said Ottilie. "The se
nate should do what it does best: rep
resent our own student concerns."
However. Sen. Liz Rvll argued that
"as an intellectual body, we must
make a comment on student issues."
"The motion gives moral support (to
the strikers) and informs the California
Board of Regents that California stu
dents are watching the issue." added
Sen. Seth Foldy.
Removal attempt
McDermott attempted to have Sen.
Brad Krevoy and Deric Jennings,
members of the Finance Committe,
dropped from the committee for hav
ing missed three consecutive meet
ings.
"I had informed the Chairman
(McDermott) that 1 would not be able to
attend the most recent meeting be
cause 1 was attending another sub
committee meeting," said Krevoy in
his defense.
The senate voted not to drop Krevoy
from the committee by a vote of 9-2
with Krevoy. McDermott and Sen. Bill

Tyndall abstaining.
Each member of the COP gave a re
port. Vice President Charlotte Cer
mane announced a meeting tomorrow
at Tresidder from 7-9 p.m. where
women will be able to discuss specific
student services with administrators.
The Nominations Committee will be
meeting next week to discuss six vac
ancies on various ASSU committees,
announced Vice President Dave Galli
gan, making his first appearance at a
senate meeting this quarter.
Student trustees
Calligan also reported he is gather
ing information concerning the
number of universities across the U.S.
who have students on their boards of
trustees.
The COP hopes to make a "substan
tial presentation" to our Board of Trus
tees, on the advantages of student
board members, said Calligan.
