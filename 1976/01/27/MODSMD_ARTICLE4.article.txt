# University shows profit
## Stock portfolio yields gain 
### DAN FIDUCCIA 
The University's stock portfolio
showed a profit during fiscal yearl 975,
according to the University's Annual
Financial Report for 1975.
The category of unrestricted funds
for 1975 also showed a profit despite a
$216,000 operations loss. During the
previous year, the operations loss had
totaled $713,000, prompting an ex
tended University budget-cutting ef
fort.
University Director of Finance Rod
Adams said the stock portfolio profit
occurred because "we sold those
stocks which were down from their
original investment value and so cut
our losses." Original investment value
is the value at which the University
either buys or receives the stock.
Recorded loss
During 1974 the University had a
recorded loss on the original invest
ment value of securities of $4.6 mill
ion. During 1975 a loss of $3.6 million
was recorded.
The University has shown a loss in
this category because only losing sec
urities, below their original value, are
sold.
"If you're in a mode of selling your
losers and holding onto your winners,
you're not going to show a gain. That
is, your winners can double, but that
doesn't show up anywhere (in the
books)," said Adams.
The market, or current, value of
University-owned stocks also rose
during 1975.
'Positive increase'
"There was a positive increase in the
market values. Overall, our perfor
mance was better last year," Adams
said.
Unrestricted funds showed a
$753,000 deficit in 1974 but a $52,000
profit in 1975. The unrestricted fund
category is based on the operations
loss and specifically invested funds
balances.
Operations losses were $713,000 for
1974, but the 1975 deficit was only
$216,000. Operations loss is the
amount by which expenses are ex
pected to exceed income for the year.
Reduction program
The $500,000 difference between
the two years was due to the three-year
budget deficit reduction program, ac

cording to Kent Peterson, director of
management and financial planning.
That program, currently in its second
year, calls for expenditure reductions
throughout the University to balance
the budget.
Peterson also attributed last year's
smaller deficit to "a program we had
last year through which we contacted
all deans, chairman, and managers in
an effort to save money, which they all
did."
Unrestricted funds also showed a
$40,000 decrease for a "specifically
invested" category in 1974. However,
in 1975 that category showed an in
crease of $268,000.
