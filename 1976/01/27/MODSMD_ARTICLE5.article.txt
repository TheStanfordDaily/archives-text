Rebates for Sunday Flicks season
ticket holders will be available at this
Sunday's film, following the cancella
tion of last Sunday's show, according
to Lynda Helmstadter, ASSU Sunday
Flicks manager.
Refunds will be made next Sunday
only, Helmstadter said.
"There will be refunds for all season
ticket holders next week at the season
pass entrance. There will be none be
fore this date and none after," she said.
No immediate showing
The canceled film. "Monty Python
and the Holy Grail," will not be shown
at all this quarter, Helmstadter said,
because the Drama Department has re
served Memorial Auditorium for re
hearsals every evening this week.
Two of the live reels comprising the
film were without functional sprocket
holes thus forcing the cancellation,
Helmstadter said.
Helmstadter said she
called Theater Transit, a transport tirni
which brought the original print. "We
thought maybe we could get them to
bring us an extra print," she said. The
effort failed.
The print had been obtained
througli National Film Service, which
in turn had received it from a national
distributor with exclusive rights to the
film. Since the responsibility of Thea
ter Transit extends only to the trans
portation of the film, National Film
Service should take the blame for the
print's inadequacy, Helmstadter
charged.
'Good condition'
"But," sheadded, "they denied this,
saying something to the effect that 'We
expect them (the prints) to be in good
condition when we get them.' "
Although the print arrived Thurs
day or Friday at Plant Servics, which
arranges projection work, it was not
checked until the projectionist came
on duty Sunday at 6 p.m.
Future efforts will be made to "spot
rheck" films upon arrival, according
to Bill Cleveland, Plant Services
supervisor of public services.
Helmstadter said "a lot of people
came to the cancelled show and they
were mad." Free popcorn was offered
to those who showed up at the au
ditorium.
The Monty Python film may be re
scheduled in the spring quarter be
cause of its popularity, Helmstadter
said. She estimated that 2800 to 3000
viewers would have attended.
