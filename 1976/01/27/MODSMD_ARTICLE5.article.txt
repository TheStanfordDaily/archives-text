# 'Python' rebates scheduled

Rebates for Sunday Flicks season
ticket holders will be available at this
Sunday's film, following the cancella
tion of last Sunday's show, according
to Lynda Helmstadter, ASSU Sunday
Flicks manager.
Refunds will be made next Sunday
only, Helmstadter said.
"There will be refunds for all season
ticket holders next week at the season
pass entrance. There will be none be
fore this date and none after," she said.
No immediate showing
The canceled film. "Monty Python
and the Holy Grail," will not be shown
at all this quarter, Helmstadter said,
because the Drama Department has re
served Memorial Auditorium for re
hearsals every evening this week.
Two of the live reels comprising the
film were without functional sprocket
holes thus forcing the cancellation,
Helmstadter said.
Helmstadter said she
called Theater Transit, a transport tirni
which brought the original print. "We
thought maybe we could get them to
bring us an extra print," she said. The
effort failed.
