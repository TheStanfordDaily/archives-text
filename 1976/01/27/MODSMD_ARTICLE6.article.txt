# Hearst bank robbery trial opens; jail bugging questions remain
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The judge
for Patricia Hearst's bank robbery trial
cleared the way yesterday for the trial
to begin today, but left hanging com
plaints regarding allegations that her
jail conversations were bugged.
U.S. District Court Judge Oliver Car
ter adjourned a final stormy pretrial
hearing by declaring: "We'll select a
jury tomorrow."
The session ended with U.S. Atty.
James Browning shouting angrily,
demanding that the judge gag defense
attorneys from making statements to
the press.
The judge, cutting Browning off in
mid-sentence, declared, "I'm not
going to make a gag rule. . . Let's put
an end to this. The motion is denied,
period."
Talks taped
Earlier, defense attorney Albert
Johnson accused authorities at the San
Mateo County jail of tape recording
Hearst's private talks — not only with
visitors but also with other jail in
mates. The FBI, he said, picked up the
tapes every day.
He called the practice "totally rep
rehensible."
The judge postponed ruling on
whether Hearst's rights were violated,
and asked that San Mateo County
Sheriff John McDonald, who oversees
the jail in which Hearst is being held,
give a sworn affidavit about the bug-
King.
The goverment openly admitted the
bugging occured, but defended it as
"totally proper" and no different than
the routine eavesdropping on all in
mates.
jury questioning
Carter accepted voluminous lists of
questions which both sides propose!
he ask of prospective jurors. Fol
lowing normal federal procedure, the
judge, rather than attorneys, will ques
tion prospective panelists.
Among questions cited as "impera
tive" by the defense is whether the
jurors believe that I learst was a kidnap
victim.
The heiress, daughter of newspaper

executive Randolph Hearst, was kid
naped by ttie Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA) on Feb. 4, 1974.
Government prosecutors once said
they would question whether she
helped arrange her own kidnaping
but recently dropped this supposi
tion, saying they were convinced the
kidnaping was authentic.
Exculpatory evidence
Opposing attorneys disagreed yes
terday about whether the kidnaping
could be used as "exculpatory evi
dence" in Hearst's behalf at her trial.
Exculpatory evidence frequently pre
sents mitigating circumstances which
would help prove the defendant inno

cent.
"The government has never consi
dered evidence of abduction in this
case as exculpatory," Browning de
clared. "We understand that the de
fense does."
Browning's comments signaled the
start of a legal battle li kely to become a
major part of the trial. Johnson and
partner F. Lee Bailey have said
Hearst's kidnaping will play a key role
in their defense case.
They contend she was brainwashed,
tormented and put in fear of death bv
SLA kidnapers who forced her to take
part with them in the April 15, 1974,
holdup of a branch of Hibernia Bank.

EX CULPRIT?—Dons Patricia Hearst's alined kidnaping by the SLA provide
exculpatory evidence which may lead to her acquittal on charges of armed
rohbery? This will probably be a pivotal question in the trial scheduled to
begin today with the selection of jurors. Hearst is shown here at the Stanford
Center where she underwent psychiatric examination last November.

jury questioning
Carter accepted voluminous lists of
questions which both sides propose!
he ask of prospective jurors. Fol
lowing normal federal procedure, the
judge, rather than attorneys, will ques
tion prospective panelists.
Among questions cited as "impera
tive" by the defense is whether the
jurors believe that I learst was a kidnap
victim.
The heiress, daughter of newspaper

executive Randolph Hearst, was kid
naped by ttie Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA) on Feb. 4, 1974.
Government prosecutors once said
they would question whether she
helped arrange her own kidnaping
but recently dropped this supposi
tion, saying they were convinced the
kidnaping was authentic.
Exculpatory evidence
Opposing attorneys disagreed yes
terday about whether the kidnaping
could be used as "exculpatory evi
dence" in Hearst's behalf at her trial.
Exculpatory evidence frequently pre
sents mitigating circumstances which
would help prove the defendant inno

cent.
"The government has never consi
dered evidence of abduction in this
case as exculpatory," Browning de
clared. "We understand that the de
fense does."
Browning's comments signaled the
start of a legal battle li kely to become a
major part of the trial. Johnson and
partner F. Lee Bailey have said
Hearst's kidnaping will play a key role
in their defense case.
They contend she was brainwashed,
tormented and put in fear of death bv
SLA kidnapers who forced her to take
part with them in the April 15, 1974,
holdup of a branch of Hibernia Bank.

EX CULPRIT?—Dons Patricia Hearst's alined kidnaping by the SLA provide
exculpatory evidence which may lead to her acquittal on charges of armed
rohbery? This will probably be a pivotal question in the trial scheduled to
begin today with the selection of jurors. Hearst is shown here at the Stanford
Center where she underwent psychiatric examination last November.
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The judge
for Patricia Hearst's bank robbery trial
cleared the way yesterday for the trial
to begin today, but left hanging com
plaints regarding allegations that her
jail conversations were bugged.
U.S. District Court Judge Oliver Car
ter adjourned a final stormy pretrial
hearing by declaring: "We'll select a
jury tomorrow."
The session ended with U.S. Atty.
James Browning shouting angrily,
demanding that the judge gag defense
attorneys from making statements to
the press.
The judge, cutting Browning off in
mid-sentence, declared, "I'm not
going to make a gag rule. . . Let's put
an end to this. The motion is denied,
period."
Talks taped
Earlier, defense attorney Albert
Johnson accused authorities at the San
Mateo County jail of tape recording
Hearst's private talks — not only with
visitors but also with other jail in
mates. The FBI, he said, picked up the
tapes every day.
He called the practice "totally rep
rehensible."
The judge postponed ruling on
whether Hearst's rights were violated,
and asked that San Mateo County
Sheriff John McDonald, who oversees
the jail in which Hearst is being held,
give a sworn affidavit about the bug-
King.
The goverment openly admitted the
bugging occured, but defended it as
