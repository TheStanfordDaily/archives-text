## Disorientation Week 
### 
The Alliance for Radical Change (ARC) deserves
commendation for its recent presentation of "Disorien
tation Week."
The 10-day program of speakers, films, panels and
performers provided an excellent stimulus to the
community. The Stanford community certainly be
nefitted from the presence of such persons as David
Dellinger, Charles Carry, Herbert Marcuse, Malvina
Reynolds and Leonard Weinglass.
While "Disorientation Week" may not have pro
foundly altered Stanford's ideological consciousness,
it did provide foci for future political action on campus
— against Senate Bill 1, for example. We hope ARC
continues to provide such excellent programs, and that
other campus groups, such as the Stanford Conserva
tive Forum, emulate its example.
