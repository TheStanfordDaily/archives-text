# USE agreement
## 
### 
Douglas Barton, staff council
for employe relations, de
scended briefly in his Jai>- 16
Daily column from the miasma
of arbitrations, law suits and
union-busting activities which
are the products of his brand of
employee relations, to enlighten
the Stanford community about
his view of the recent United
Stanford Employes (USE) activ
ity on campus.
After paying the requisite lib
eral lip service to Stanford's de
dication to free speech and right
to disseminate information
(witness H. Bruce Franklin, John
Keilch and others) Barton points
out the current USE agreement
prohibits picketing, which he
likes to define as "the carrying of
placards on sticks."
What the agreement actually
says is this: "Neither the Union
nor any of the workers will en
gage in or participate directly or
indirectly in any strike, picket
ing, slow down, sick-in, stop
page or any other interference
with or interruption of work or
operations during the term of
this Agreement" (emphasis is
mine).
Key to agreement
The key to the agreement's de
finition of picketing clearly is
the word "other" in the phrase
"or other interference with or in
terruption of work or opera
tions. . The mere carrying of
placards on sticks clearly cannot
be viewed in a class with such
actions as sick-ins, work stop
pages and slow-downs, espe
cially when those carrying signs
are urging people to go to work.
What Barton hates and fears
about workers on Stanford prop
erty carrying placards is the im
age. This is the answer to the
final question asked in his opin
ion column.
"Why." he wonders, "would
the union persist in placing pic
kets rather than merely dis
seminating leaflets it its only in
terest was to inform the public?"
Barton's position as architect
of Stanford's personnel policy is
jeopardized whenever the un
dercurrent of worker dissatisfac
tion breaks the surface of the
community. It was Barton who
decided to back the layotf for
racial reasons of Rocky McGill
at the Medical School. Mean
while. the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission has
soundly and publicly rapped
Stanford.
Prove USE
It was Barton who drove USE
into a three-week strike in order
to win a contract. It is Barton
who has stonewalled the arbitra
tions of 100 University

Roger Hardy

employes.
And now it is Barton who first,
backs the layoff of the assistant
president of USE, and then re
fuses to grant him his seniority
rights under the agreement.
Barton has driven us out to
protest, and we in USE have cho
sen to project the traditional
image of the dissatisfied worker,
by carrying placards on sticks.
Cars passing by, visitors on
campus and those seeing our
pictures in the press will know
Stanford is, in the opinion of the
workers, being unjust.
No other demonstration short
of violation of our agreement can
make this impression as effec
tively and that is why our de
monstration has taken this form.
Private entity?
One other point is important.
Barton reminds us "the Univer
sity has been and remains con
cerned that its actions respect
the constitutional guarantees
even though it is not a public
entity and hence is not bound to
do so."
Barton reminds us our con
stitutional rights are rights
under law and he is explicit re
garding his legal opinion that
Stanford is a private, not a pub
lic, entity. This point is open to
debate (it is the heart of the cur
rent pay parking litigation).
If it is true Stanford is a private
entity, then Barton should be
asked why Santa Clara County
Sheriffs were called in to photo
graph the peaceful demonstra
tion around his office last
Thursday. Continual use of a
public police force to intimidate
workers' rights is, 1 suspect, a
serious attack on constitutional
rights and calls into question the
assertion that Stanford is a pri
vate entity.
