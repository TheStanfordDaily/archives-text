# Horton stresses improved housing
## 
### STEPHEN CROLIUS 
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry
I lorton emphasized last night the Uni
versity's commitment to continually
upgrade the housing situation.
Horton, speaking on KZSU's Cam
pus Conference, said, "The Cuaranteed
Housing Flan is not : i substitute for
new housing."
Hespokeabout several aspects ofthe
past, present and future housing prob
lem, dealing particularly with the
trend toward more theme houses.
Pointing to the 1()(J new spaces that
opened this year in Florence Moore,
and the 150 new spaces which are ex
pected to be available by next Sep
tember in the three new Row houses,
Norton said the University is moving
as quickly as possible toward eliminat
ing the need for the Cuaranteed Hous
ing Plan (which guarantees a student
housing for only two of his three upper
class years).
"I think we'll always lag a little bit
behind because we can't afford to
overbuild," he said, adding "I think
experimenting with off-campus living
will become increasingly popular."
Few vacancies
Horton admitted that there are vac
ancies in some residences but said
they lire "very, very few" in number,
estimating the vacancy rate to be less
than one percent. "Most (university)
housing systems in the country oper
ate with a much higher vacancy rate
than Stanford," he said.
Turning to theme houses, Horton
explained that the Committee on Ser
vices to Students (COSS) subcommit
tee on residences unanimously re
commended the establishment of an
Italian language theme house and an
American studies theme house, but
has not endorsed any of the other six
new housing proposals.
A proposal for a Jewish culture
theme house was not endorsed, ac
cording to Horton. because "separa
tion of religion and culture in a Jewish
theme house would be difficult." He
said the University has always shied

away from religious theme houses,
both Christian and Jewish.
The proposal tor a "coed feminist"
theme house will be offered to resident
fellows in various residences across
the campus, Horton explained, as a
program to be implemented voluntar
ily if enough interest is expressed in it
by any existing residence group.
A good idea
"We would like to set up such
houses (as the coed feminist one) if all
the details could be worked out," Hor
ton said. He cited the shelved
Stanford-in-Stanford program as a
case where "a good idea" just was not
feasible. Of 1584 women in the
housingdraw last year, only five chose
the Stanford-in-Stanford house, ac
cording to Horton.
