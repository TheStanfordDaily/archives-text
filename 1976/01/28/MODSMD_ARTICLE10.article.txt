# American blacks' interest in Angola
## 
### 
The current conflict over the "true
people's government" of Angola seems well
on its way (in the United States, at least) to
replacing the perennial Arab-Israeli non
dialogue as a focus of public interest. specu
lation and armchair diplomacy.
The topics for debate are manifold.
Executive Director Roy Innis of the Con
gress of Racial Equality has raised a new
issue. In the Jan. 12, 1976, issue of Harper's
Weekly Innis contends:
"An Afro-American should be concerned
about what's happening in Angola for the
same imperatives that made young Anglo-
Saxon Americans concerned in 1940 to go
to England and join the British army to fight
against the Nazis. The same concern that
young white Americans had, to go to Spain
and join the Abraham Lincoln Brigade to
fight against Franco in the Spanish Civil
War. Exactly the same concern that hit
young Jewish boys in the United States to go
to Israel to fight for what they considered
their ancestral homeland. That's a natural
response."
He then throws out a challenge: "I think
there's enough red blood in black men."
The question of just where black Ameri
cans should stand on the Angolan question
is indeed vital, and potentially extremely
divisive.
Crant, then, that the "family" has a plight,
which merits a response. What form should
it take?
Won't be better
Actually, there is little reason to assume
that Angola, whoever "wins," will turn out
much better than any other African nation
which has freed itself from colonial exploi
tation. Rulers of such countries have almost

inevitably been either extremely corrupt
(even by American standards), tossed out of
office within a few months by the military
(usually with U.S. aid) or both. The black
masses, there as elsewhere, have ever been
oppressed, often violently and ruthlessly.
On the other hand, there could be a least
possible evil in the conflict.

Innis advocates letting black people de
cide black Africa's fate. Better would be to
allow black Africans to decide Africa's fate.
Certainly, the African continent is not
monolithic; the recent near-disintegration
of the Organization for African Unity (OAIJ)
demonstrates that. But arguing the OAU's
indecision indicates Africans cannot solve
their problems borders on arguing that be
cause the United Nations is often indeci
sive, the world cannot solve its problems.
Indecision
Although the OAIJ itself could not decide
which faction to back, African governments
have — and they are increasingly joining
the Soviet Union and Cuba (admittedly
white governments) in backing the Popular
Movement (MPLA).
Half the countries in Africa have an
nounced support for that faction, although
for many different reasons. Most probably

have not reached their decisions simply as a
matter of following a Soviet lead. Many
want to oppose South Africa, much as the
United States wants to oppose the Soviet
Union, but with much better reason.
What President Ford and Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger overlook in their
rather flawed analyses is simply that the
Soviet Union's support for someone does
not make that side wrong.
A recent letter to the New York Times
suggested if the United States really wants
to counter Soviet influence, but wants to be
on the right side, it should support the
MPLA. (This would also end the war pretty
quickly.)
Innis' proposal for black mercenaries falls
short of this, largely because his groups
would simply "keep the peace" — presum
ably without there being any government.
Black Americans should support Ango
la's, and all Africa's, ight to self
determination. Probably, absent any out
side support, the MPLA would "win" any
way — if setting up a government con
stantly beset bv guerrilla raids and possibly
bringing war to Southern Africa, via Zaire,
is "winning."
American blacks have an interest, but not
a responsibility. We should argue for with
drawal of all foreign support in Angola, but,
failing that, we should at least insist the
United States aid that faction which appears
to have the most African support — the
MPLA.

indecision indicates Africans cannot solve
their problems borders on arguing that be
cause the United Nations is often indeci

Indecision
Although the OAIJ itself could not decide
which faction to back, African governments
have — and they are increasingly joining
the Soviet Union and Cuba (admittedly
white governments) in backing the Popular
Movement (MPLA).
Half the countries in Africa have an
nounced support for that faction, although
for many different reasons. Most probably

have not reached their decisions simply as a
matter of following a Soviet lead. Many
want to oppose South Africa, much as the
United States wants to oppose the Soviet
Union, but with much better reason.
What President Ford and Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger overlook in their
rather flawed analyses is simply that the
Soviet Union's support for someone does
not make that side wrong.
A recent letter to the New York Times
suggested if the United States really wants
to counter Soviet influence, but wants to be
on the right side, it should support the
MPLA. (This would also end the war pretty
quickly.)
Innis' proposal for black mercenaries falls
short of this, largely because his groups
would simply "keep the peace" — presum
ably without there being any government.
Black Americans should support Ango
la's, and all Africa's, ight to self
determination. Probably, absent any out
side support, the MPLA would "win" any
way — if setting up a government con
stantly beset bv guerrilla raids and possibly
bringing war to Southern Africa, via Zaire,
is "winning."
American blacks have an interest, but not
a responsibility. We should argue for with
drawal of all foreign support in Angola, but,
failing that, we should at least insist the
United States aid that faction which appears
to have the most African support — the
MPLA.

The current conflict over the "true
people's government" of Angola seems well
on its way (in the United States, at least) to
replacing the perennial Arab-Israeli non
dialogue as a focus of public interest. specu
lation and armchair diplomacy.
The topics for debate are manifold.
Executive Director Roy Innis of the Con
gress of Racial Equality has raised a new
issue. In the Jan. 12, 1976, issue of Harper's
Weekly Innis contends:
"An Afro-American should be concerned
about what's happening in Angola for the
same imperatives that made young Anglo-
Saxon Americans concerned in 1940 to go
to England and join the British army to fight
against the Nazis. The same concern that
young white Americans had, to go to Spain
and join the Abraham Lincoln Brigade to
fight against Franco in the Spanish Civil
War. Exactly the same concern that hit
young Jewish boys in the United States to go
to Israel to fight for what they considered
their ancestral homeland. That's a natural
response."
He then throws out a challenge: "I think
there's enough red blood in black men."
The question of just where black Ameri
cans should stand on the Angolan question
is indeed vital, and potentially extremely
divisive.
Crant, then, that the "family" has a plight,
which merits a response. What form should
it take?
Won't be better
Actually, there is little reason to assume
that Angola, whoever "wins," will turn out
much better than any other African nation
which has freed itself from colonial exploi
tation. Rulers of such countries have almost

inevitably been either extremely corrupt
(even by American standards), tossed out of
office within a few months by the military
(usually with U.S. aid) or both. The black
masses, there as elsewhere, have ever been
oppressed, often violently and ruthlessly.
On the other hand, there could be a least
possible evil in the conflict.

Innis advocates letting black people de
cide black Africa's fate. Better would be to
allow black Africans to decide Africa's fate.
Certainly, the African continent is not
monolithic; the recent near-disintegration
of the Organization for African Unity (OAIJ)
demonstrates that. But arguing the OAU's
indecision indicates Africans cannot solve
their problems borders on arguing that be
