# CORRLES report neglects problems

Rosenbaum, et. al

(Second of two parts)
What is most irritating about
the Committee on the Reform
and Renewal of Liberal Educa
tion at Stanford (CORRLES) re
port is what the committee did
no! accomplish in its six-month
existence. Among topics for
consideration which tiie comit
tee did not find time to discuss
were evaluation of teaching, ad
vising, tenure procedure, in
creasing independent study,and
reorientation and maintenance
of faculty interests in under
graduate education.
These are precisely the issues
which are responsible for de
terioration of the quality of un
dergraduate education at Stan
ford. Yet CORRLES preferred to
spend its time proposing more
structure for wayward students.
Another CORRLES recom
mendation is "Honors in
Liberal Studies." To reward a
student for following a pre
scribed set of courses (even if he
maintains a I) average in them
all) is to debase the meaning of
the "honors."
According to CORRLES. "The
substance of the program should
be more important than grade
distinction."
Stanford students are sup
posedly being trained to be the
leaders of the future; to propose
Honors in Liberal Studies is to
reward the followers of today.
General studies
Examining the proposed re
quirements for Honors in Liberal
Studies, one discovers it is iden
tical to the old General Studies
requirements eliminated by the
IStudy of Education at Stan
ford (SES) as being too "rigid."
"superficial." "selective" and
"unreal." Both would have re
quirements in distribution. Wes
tern civilization, math or foreign
language, and a year of freshman
English.
What CORRLES has done with

liberal studies is an expert adver
tising ploy. By substituting "lib
eral" for "general," and adding
"honors" to it. CORRLES has re
packaged an unwanted program
of the past and is selling it as the
product of the future.
CORRLES'is advocacy of an
expanded honors programs
within departments, without
providing any insight as to how
the advising system might be
expanded to handle them, is also
hard to comprehend. Although
CORRLES labels advising "cru
cial" to the success of the honors
programs, it decided "the prog
ram ought to proceed without
special advising in order to see
how many people would be
come involved and what advis
ing problems arose."
This would be like depositing
50 people on a deserted island
without food, clothing or shel
ter. and waiting to'see "what
problems arose." As noted pre
viously. CORRLES doesn't even
tackle the subject of providing
adequate advising in the present
system.
Make sense
Certain recommendations do
make sense, though.
Humanities and Sciences
ought to have an advisory com
mittee on undergraduate educa
tion; it should have had one
since SES recommended similar
action eight years ago. But estab
lishing requirements for the
committee to administer, as
CORRLES recommends, is un
necessary.
Furthermore, the recommen
dation makes no mention
whether students would sit on
this committee. If so (and they
certainly ought to), they should
not be selected by a student
selection process (e.g. the ASSI'
Nominations Committee).
Another intelligent and long
overdue proposal is that a state
ment on the academic goals of

Stanford should be composed
and distributed. A return to
semesters, however, is a debate
that will doubtless never end.
It was urged bv SES and has
been a rallying point for the
humanities faculty for years.
Still, scientists seem to prefer
quarters.
CORRLES contends one ad
vantage of a calendar change is
all courses would need to be
evaluated and redeveloped. Cur
ricula innovation would be
necessary.
Perhaps we could just review
all curricula after certain inter
vals without worrying about the
calendar at all.
For the calendar debate de
pends on a trade-off: one can
either be exposed to a greater
variety of disciplines or one can

pursue fewer subjects in greater
depth. A quarter system does not
foreclose the latter option to
those who prefer it; semesters
preclude the possibility of
broader exposure.
It should be noted two stu
dents sat on CORRLES. While
not meaning to slight these stu
dents for their presence on the
committee, they were not picked
by students but by the Dean of
Humanities and Sciences.
This must discount any con
tention that CORRLES had rep
resentative student input. If it
had, it is doubtful the students
would have supported the major
recommendations of the report.

Furthermore, the recommen
dation makes no mention
whether students would sit on
this committee. If so (and they
certainly ought to), they should
not be selected by a student
selection process (e.g. the ASSI'
Nominations Committee).
Another intelligent and long
overdue proposal is that a state
ment on the academic goals of

Stanford should be composed
and distributed. A return to
semesters, however, is a debate
that will doubtless never end.
It was urged bv SES and has
been a rallying point for the
humanities faculty for years.
Still, scientists seem to prefer
quarters.
CORRLES contends one ad
vantage of a calendar change is
all courses would need to be
evaluated and redeveloped. Cur
ricula innovation would be
necessary.
Perhaps we could just review
all curricula after certain inter
vals without worrying about the
calendar at all.
For the calendar debate de
pends on a trade-off: one can
either be exposed to a greater
variety of disciplines or one can

pursue fewer subjects in greater
depth. A quarter system does not
foreclose the latter option to
those who prefer it; semesters
preclude the possibility of
broader exposure.
It should be noted two stu
dents sat on CORRLES. While
not meaning to slight these stu
dents for their presence on the
committee, they were not picked
by students but by the Dean of
Humanities and Sciences.
This must discount any con
tention that CORRLES had rep
resentative student input. If it
had, it is doubtful the students
would have supported the major
recommendations of the report.

What is most irritating about
the Committee on the Reform
and Renewal of Liberal Educa
tion at Stanford (CORRLES) re
port is what the committee did
no! accomplish in its six-month
existence. Among topics for
consideration which tiie comit
tee did not find time to discuss
were evaluation of teaching, ad
vising, tenure procedure, in
creasing independent study,and
reorientation and maintenance
of faculty interests in under
graduate education.
These are precisely the issues
which are responsible for de
terioration of the quality of un
dergraduate education at Stan
ford. Yet CORRLES preferred to
spend its time proposing more
structure for wayward students.
Another CORRLES recom
mendation is "Honors in
Liberal Studies." To reward a
student for following a pre
scribed set of courses (even if he
maintains a I) average in them
all) is to debase the meaning of
the "honors."
According to CORRLES. "The
substance of the program should
be more important than grade
distinction."
Stanford students are sup
posedly being trained to be the
leaders of the future; to propose
Honors in Liberal Studies is to
reward the followers of today.
General studies
Examining the proposed re
quirements for Honors in Liberal
Studies, one discovers it is iden
tical to the old General Studies
requirements eliminated by the
IStudy of Education at Stan
ford (SES) as being too "rigid."
"superficial." "selective" and
"unreal." Both would have re
quirements in distribution. Wes
tern civilization, math or foreign
language, and a year of freshman
English.
What CORRLES has done with

liberal studies is an expert adver
tising ploy. By substituting "lib
eral" for "general," and adding
"honors" to it. CORRLES has re
packaged an unwanted program
of the past and is selling it as the
product of the future.
CORRLES'is advocacy of an
expanded honors programs
within departments, without
providing any insight as to how
the advising system might be
expanded to handle them, is also
hard to comprehend. Although
CORRLES labels advising "cru
cial" to the success of the honors
programs, it decided "the prog
ram ought to proceed without
special advising in order to see
how many people would be
come involved and what advis
ing problems arose."
This would be like depositing
50 people on a deserted island
without food, clothing or shel
ter. and waiting to'see "what
problems arose." As noted pre
viously. CORRLES doesn't even
tackle the subject of providing
adequate advising in the present
system.
Make sense
Certain recommendations do
make sense, though.
Humanities and Sciences
ought to have an advisory com
mittee on undergraduate educa
tion; it should have had one
since SES recommended similar
action eight years ago. But estab
lishing requirements for the
committee to administer, as
CORRLES recommends, is un

quirements for Honors in Liberal
Studies, one discovers it is iden
tical to the old General Studies
requirements eliminated by the
IStudy of Education at Stan
ford (SES) as being too "rigid."
"superficial." "selective" and
"unreal." Both would have re
quirements in distribution. Wes
tern civilization, math or foreign
language, and a year of freshman
English.
What CORRLES has done with

liberal studies is an expert adver
tising ploy. By substituting "lib
eral" for "general," and adding
"honors" to it. CORRLES has re
packaged an unwanted program
of the past and is selling it as the
product of the future.
CORRLES'is advocacy of an
expanded honors programs
within departments, without
providing any insight as to how
the advising system might be
expanded to handle them, is also
hard to comprehend. Although
CORRLES labels advising "cru
cial" to the success of the honors
programs, it decided "the prog
ram ought to proceed without
special advising in order to see
how many people would be
come involved and what advis
ing problems arose."
This would be like depositing
50 people on a deserted island
without food, clothing or shel
ter. and waiting to'see "what
problems arose." As noted pre
viously. CORRLES doesn't even
tackle the subject of providing
adequate advising in the present
system.
Make sense
Certain recommendations do
make sense, though.
Humanities and Sciences
ought to have an advisory com
mittee on undergraduate educa
tion; it should have had one
since SES recommended similar
action eight years ago. But estab
lishing requirements for the
committee to administer, as
CORRLES recommends, is un
necessary.
Furthermore, the recommen
dation makes no mention
whether students would sit on
this committee. If so (and they
certainly ought to), they should
not be selected by a student
selection process (e.g. the ASSI'
Nominations Committee).
Another intelligent and long
overdue proposal is that a state
ment on the academic goals of

Stanford should be composed
and distributed. A return to
semesters, however, is a debate
that will doubtless never end.
It was urged bv SES and has
been a rallying point for the
humanities faculty for years.
Still, scientists seem to prefer
quarters.
CORRLES contends one ad
vantage of a calendar change is
all courses would need to be
evaluated and redeveloped. Cur
ricula innovation would be
necessary.
Perhaps we could just review
all curricula after certain inter
vals without worrying about the
calendar at all.
For the calendar debate de
pends on a trade-off: one can
either be exposed to a greater
variety of disciplines or one can

pursue fewer subjects in greater
depth. A quarter system does not
foreclose the latter option to
those who prefer it; semesters
preclude the possibility of
broader exposure.
It should be noted two stu
dents sat on CORRLES. While
not meaning to slight these stu
dents for their presence on the
committee, they were not picked
by students but by the Dean of
Humanities and Sciences.
This must discount any con
tention that CORRLES had rep
resentative student input. If it
had, it is doubtful the students
would have supported the major
recommendations of the report.
