T he Sub-Committee on Hous
ing'sannouncement that Univer
sity housing space will be as
signed to two new residential
study programs should be re
ceived with enthusiasm by those
students and faculty members
who favor greater continuity be
tween housing policy and in
class learning.
The American Studies House
and t ht? Italian I louse represent a
small but positive step toward
raising the quality of the Stan
ford academic experience, in the
same way proposals for the
French House and Stanford-In-
Stanford did last vear.
The recent announcement
should be well-received for at
least four reasons.
First, and most important, ad
vancement of the cause of resi
dential study will encourage in
teraction between faculty and
students, and between students
themselves. Second, the propos
als will increase the diversity of
offerings within the housing sys
tem and will enable students to
make more informed decisions
in choosing where they wish to
live.
Interested students
Third, the programs are en
couraging because they origi
nate with interested students
and faculty, rather than only
with administrators. Finally,
approval of the programs will re
state a commitment by the Uni
versity to undergraduate educa
tion — a commitment which has
recently been in bad need of re
statement.
To the majority of high-school
seniors and college transfers
who consider academic prog
rams before submitting applica
tions, a low student-to-faculty
ratio is a major consideration.
Despite growing impersonality
(if the education system, Stan
ford remains far more attractive
in this regard than most institu
tions in California and in the Un
ited States as a whole.
Residential study programs
which hring faculty and stu
dents into greater contact en
hance the attractiveness of learn
ing opportunities at this univer
sity.
Placed in every living unit, an
academic program similar to
those proposed would be even
more stifling than no programs
at all. However, diversity in
housing and greater opportunity
to satisfy each student's interest
are goals to he encouraged.
One hears all-too-often cries of
people who would have things
different; however, one hears
all-too-infrequently those who
will work to make that differ
ence.
Much time
The authors of both the
American Studies and the Italian
residential proposals spent
much time of their own to draw
up successful plans, which will
bring change and help others
besides themselves. Such efforts
should act as inspiration to the
endless assortment of commit
tees, elected officials and "ordi
nary'' individuals who talk far
better games than they play.
Finally, approval of these
proposals should signal a pause
in the apparently ever-growing
tendency on the part of the ad
ministration as a whole to
short-change undergraduate
education.
The two new programs — and
also the six proposals which
were not fully accepted — are
promising efforts to justify Stan
ford's reputation for academic
excellence. It should be hoped
the student body and the Uni
versity community as a whole
will support such efforts and en
courage more like them in the
future.
