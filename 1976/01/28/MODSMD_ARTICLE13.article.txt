Merger proposal
Editor:
The Jan. 14 Daily article on the
proposed merger of Ravensvvood
City and Palo Alto Unified
School Districts included sev
eral inaccuracies. The most glar
ing of these related to the posi
tion of the Ravensvvood Hoard
regarding the merger proposal.
The statement that the board
opposed the merger was coupled
with the claim of a merger prop
onent that East Palo Alto resi
dents actually support the prop
osal. Whether intended or not,
the implication is the
Ravenswood Board is not repre
senting its constituency on this
issue.
In it is the Palo Alto Board
that has formally (by resolution)
opposed the merger proposal.
The Ravenswood Board has
taken no formal stand.
It seems the more appropriate

question to be raised is whether
the Palo Alto Board represents
the view of its constituents.
Whether the Ravenswood
Board's constituents are being
represented by the Board
is irrelevant and is only
raised by merger proponents
who wish to convince I'alo Alto
residents (who clearly will con
trol any election) they will not be
overpowering the black minor
ity if they vote for the merger.
Proper understanding of the
merger issue requires a com
prehensive analysis of many
forces and existing conditions in
the areas educational systems.

In the Jan. 23 Daily analysis of

Disorientation Week, I was
quoted as criticizing the week
for being "too academic ... A
lot of talking is going on but no
thing is getting done." I think
this inaccurately states my posi
tion, as the line attributed to me
was more a hypothetical com
ment than a statement of my feel
ings
We need to analyze our society
seriously before we can act to
change it. Those who partici
pated in Disorientation Week
have studied social problems
academically and realize we
need to change our basic socio
economic institutions to end
those problems. Most have acted
on that realization, and the
others need to follow their lead.
