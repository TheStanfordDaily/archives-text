## Holy Hubert tells students where to go Pint-sized zealot spreads words of doom 
### KATHLEEN McTIGUE 
"You're all sinners! I know
you, devils! You're all spiritual
psychotics, and you're going to
Those were the words greeting
any student crossing White
Plaza just before noon last Fri
day. "Holy Hubert" had come
back.
Holy Hubert is a sidewalk
evangelist. He once swooped
clown from the heavens to visit
Stanford several years ago. but
now spends most of his time at
the sinful haven of Berkeley.
Gesturing for effect and sh

outing his message of hellfire
and damnation, Holy Hubert
could hardly fail to attract a
crowd.
Surrounded by milling
crowds of students, he accuses
them of one sin after another,
calling them "whoremongers,"
devils " and "blasphemers."
"The only difference between
you and Adolf Hitler is that
Adolf Hitler is in hell, and you're
on your way there!"
For the most part, his audi
ence, seeking entertainment
more than spiritual guidance

simply looks on, laughs, and
then moves on.
'He's nuts'
"I saw this guy here three
years ago," one says. "He's
nuts."
"He hangs out a lot at Ber
keley," another adds. "I guess
they got so used to him that they
stopped paying any attention, so
he decided to find a new audi
ence."
Pint sized zealot
For a fiery zealot, able to draw
and hold the attention of such
large crowds, Hubert carries an
astonishing appearance. He
stands a mere 5'4", and he wears
a bright red checkered shirt be
neath a garish brown paisley
jacket.
Within his small frame, how
ever, he packs enough energy to
attack subjects ranging from gay
liberation to cohabitation.
"1 say that any man, who lives
with a young girl without the
sanctity of holy matrimony de
serves to go to hell," Hubert
screams.
In addition to such earthv mate
rial. Hubert devotes a substantial
part of his talk to a vicious attack

against, of all people. Bertrand
Russell. "Show me one thing,"
he bellows defiantly, "that Ber
trand Russell did for Christ."
Sarcastic response
As I luberts offers his words of
wisdom, a few students in the
crowd lash back with sarcastic
attacks. Hubert does his best to
ignore the barbs, carrying on as
before. "Well, where did evil be
gin," he demands. "Answer me,
sinners! Where did evil begin?"
"At Berkeley," someone sh
outs back.
"Yeah. I know where you're
from, devil!"
Amazingly, when Hubert is
able to depart from his rambunc
tious sermons, lie speaks quite
softly. He says he hasn't let. the
laughter or sarcasm discourage
him.
"I've been at Berkeley for 10
years now. 1 started preaching
there because the Lord sent me. I
was quite a preacher then, I had a
lot of polish."
He grinned. "Berkeley sort of
knocked some of the polish off,
though."
Nine assaults
It was knocked off hard
enough to put him in the hospi

hil nine times, claimed Hubert,
due to physical assault. Once his
jaw was broken, causing him to
lose several teeth.
According to Hubert, he hasn't
always been reduced to shouting
words of righteousness to disin
terested masses. Once, he
claims, he was preacher of a
church in San Francisco. Holy
Hubert claims his church was vi
sited more than once by Hilly
Graham, whom he reverently
calls "Dr. Graham."
Since then, for reasons he
doesn't care to explain. Hubert
has taken to the streets. But even
though Stanford students see
him at his most flamboyant, he
says he doesn't always convey
his message at an earsplitting
volu me.
"1 don't always preach this
way," Hubert claims. "If you're
talking to Christians, you talk
about what they are. But if you're
talking to sinners, you talk about
what they do."
Hubert said that he plans to
return to Stanford soon.
"I always like to come here.
And I know when I do, it'll be
right. I'm working for the Lord."
