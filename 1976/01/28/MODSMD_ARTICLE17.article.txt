IVluif are the ages of greatest sexuality in men and women, and
u It at are they caused by?
According to Dr. Norman Fisk. a gynecologist at Cowell, there is
no physical basis for the myth of a "best" sexual activity age. On the
average, it is true that men are most active up to their late 20s, and
women seem to peak from their late 20s to their mid-30s, but these
levels .ire influenced mostly by psychological stresses and societal
factors — not biology.
I'isk (ites such stress factors as the "tired businessman syn
drome" for men. and "traditionally, education, job-hunting and
child-bearing" for women.
I le emphasizes that "99 percent of the sex drive is psychological,
and that normal, healthy people can lead active sex lives into their
70s, 80s and even 905."
Is nude sunbathing harmful to males or their potential progeny
becuu.se of the exposure of the testes to radiation?
I 'nless you do your sunbathing in the Nevada desert, you have
nothing to be concerned about. Any radiation that enters yourbody
while you're soaking up the rays wouldn't be stopped by clothing
anyway — unless you wear lead-lined jockey shorts.
According to Dr. Robert Kallman. of the Med Center's Radiobiol
ogv Research division, even radiation levels greatly exceeding
those of natural background radiation would cause no damage.
There is one related possibility, however, which I'm still inves
tigating: the qustion of damage caused by the excessive heat of the
sun. Edward Messing, a resident in the Urology Department reports
anecdotal accounts of the temporary sterility caused by prolonged
exposure of the testes to intense heat, supposedly from working as
steamfitters or steelfitters. Even if such damage is possible, it oc
curs rarely. So there is no need to worrv vourself about "hot" balls.
