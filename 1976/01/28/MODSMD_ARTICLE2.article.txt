# 'Trial of the century'
## Hearst jury selection begins 
### STEVE HEFTER 
SAN FRANCISCO — "The trial of
the century," as one of Patricia
Hearst's defense attorney has termed
it, began in U.S. District Court here
yesterday as 114 prospective jurors
were questioned on their ability to
serve.
Presiding Judge Oliver Carter con
ducted the tedious process, dismissing
36 persons at their own request, and
four persons because of their self
professed bias toward the case.
One of the prospective jurors, when
asked by the judge if anything prohi
bited her from serving on the jury, re
plied that she feared bombing reprisals
on her mother, who lives within six
blocks of the Hearsts.
Another woman expressed fears of
suffering a nervous breakdown if
sequestered for the expected two
month duration of the trial. "I'd crack

up," she said.
The judge dismissed the first
woman but the second was asked to
stay.
Selection this week
From the remaining 74 prospective
jurors, a panel of 36 will be selected
and interrogated today. A final selec
tion of 12 jurors and four alternatives
will be made sometime this week. The
judge scheduled a meeting to begin in
his chambers at 9:45 a.m. today to
discuss pre-emptory challenges of
i prospective jurors with government
and defense attorneys.
A pre-emptory challenge allows at
torneys to dismiss a prospective juror
without stating a reason.
Just prior to the opening gavel of the
: trial, Hearst's chief counsel, F. Lee
Bailey, told the Daily that he is ap
prehensive on the matter of jury selec
tion.
Bailey, who has defended such
clients as Dr. Sam Shepard and the
Boston Strangler, said he had "not
faith, but hope" that considerable pub
licity about the case would not pre
judice any of the jurors selected.
The selected jurors will be asked to
consider two charges against Hearst:
armed bank robbery and the use of a
> firearm to commit a felony. These
■ charges stem from the April 15, 1974,
I bank robbery of the Sunset branch of
the Hibernia Bank in San Francisco by
3 members of the Symbionese Libera
-3 tion Army.
3 Bank films of that robbery, shown on
3 national television and scheduled to
be presented by the prosecution dur-
I ing the trial, reveal Hearst — then cal
- ling herself "Tania" — armed with an
i automatic weapon.
'Involuntary captive?'
The defense, according to Bailey
, and one of his Boston assistants, Albert
; Johnson, will claim Hearst was an "in
voluntary captive," fearing for her life
t at the time of the robbery. The prosecu-
I tion. led by U.S. Attorney James
t Browning, will attempt to prove that
Hearst acted of her own free will.

The issue of jury selection is of con
siderable importance for both sides,
liaily has expressed interest in select
ing a well-educated jury, capable of
understanding his arguments that
Hearst was under psychological
duress. Browning has indicated that
he wants a jury that can concentrate on
the facts.
At yesterday's session. Hearst sat
alongside her attorneys, staring ex
pressionlessly at prospective jurors.
Her father. San Francisco Examiner
owner Randolph Hearst, mother
Catherine, and sisters Anne and Vicky
sat within three feet of her in the front
row of the courtroom. She exchanged
weak smiles with her family, but they
did not converse.
Today's session is scheduled to
begin at 10 a.m. and Judge Carter said
he is hopeful that he can seat a jury by
day's end.
