DETROIT (AP) — The Ameri
can driving public, which grew
up behind the wheel ot a roomy
full-size family auto, is now pur
chasing tour-passenger cars over
the big models by nearly a 2-1
margin.
Last year. 2.M million persons
bought subcompact cars or
minicars — vehicles no bigger
than a Ford Pinto or Chevrolet
Vega. That represents about a
third of all the new cars sold in
this country, including imports,
during 1975.
By contrast, just under 1.5
mi I lion persons bought standard
six-passenger cars: Chevrolets.
Ford, iMvmouths. Huicks and
other models of similar size
which once were the backbone
of the I !.S. auto industry.
The meteoric growth of little
cars is all the more remarkable
considering Detroit didn't even
build an auto to seat four or
fewer persons until 1909. when

the first of the subcompacts went
on sale.
Now the American companies
are rushing smaller-than
subcompact cars. called
minicars. onto the market to
meet a burgeoning demand for
low prices and high gasoline
mileage.
Minicar sales belonged e\i lu
sively to imports until C.eneral
Motors introduced its Chevrolet
Chevette last fall. The minicar
sales jumped 40 percent fiTim
1 ( )74. to 7 1 1.000 last year, while
over-all sales declined three per
cent.
The little-car boom took off in
n)7:i, when consumer worries
about inflation and the sub
sequent Mideast oil embargo
created an overnight demand for
a size vehicle that Detroit used to
call a fringe market.
"II you asked me two years ago
it there was a market for minicars
in this country. I'd have said

'turret it.' " oiii' industry analyst
said. "Now the industry is sel
ling close to one minicar for
every two full-size cars. That's
unbelievable."
The minicar market now in
cludes the Datsun B-2 10. Toyota
Corolla. Honda Civic. Fiat 12H.
Chevette and Volkswagen Rab
bit. among others. The field will
continue to grow as Ford.
Chrysler and several importers
join the minicar action.
A sales analyst for one Big
Three company added: "The
small-car growth here began
with the arrival of small cars
from abroad about three years
ago.
"Now the very smallest of the
smalls has become <ir< eptable to
the American public, particu
larly among city-suburban dwel
lers. It's just a reflection of the
entire downsizing process in the
industry."
