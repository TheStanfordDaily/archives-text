## New Card cage era passes first season half-way mark 
### 
Coach Dick Dißiaso's first year on
the Farm is a little over half finished,
and if he can recruit as well as he
coaches, Stanford fans are in for some
very good basketball over the next few
seasons.
Yes, the Cards are 6-10 on the sea
son as they leave for Hawaii this after
noon, but it's been an exciting 16
games, or as Dißiaso likes to say, "in
tense."

Stanford, a team with perhaps the
least talent of any club in the Pacific
Eight, has at times played out of its
mind, and driven its fans out of
their's with its mistakes.
Dißiaso has seen one of his goals
this year. Sedate Maples Pavilion has
at times resembled Oregon's infamous
Mac Arthur Court.
The heart of Stanford's home
schedule is still to come. Another
Maples Miracle? Maybe.
But whatever, the 'New Era' of Stan
ford basketball has provided enough
excitement, if not cardiacs, to last a
long time.

Junior forward CieorgeSchader (22) isn't exactly graceful, but he's been a big surprise for Stanford fans and other Pac-8 teams.

The Cards are 1-4 in the Pacific Eight, but if they had scored 14 more points, they
would he undefeated. Stanford overcame a 14 point margin last Saturday against Cal
to send the contest into overtime at 7:i-73, hut still lost 89-85.


Stanford fans have come of age too. This fan, disguised iis a blind official, walked onto
the court shortly before Stanford started its 14 point comeback against California.
