# Plowing the Farm
## DiBiaso was right 
### Paul Bauman 
About ten weeks ago. long before Stanford's
first game of the 1(J75-7f> basketball season, I
sat with Coach Dick Dißiaso in a small room
hidden somewhere underneath the stands in
Maples Pavilion. Practice had concluded, and
the ex-Notre Dame assistant was discussing the
Cards. Among other things, he said:"We think
the players are working very hard and deserve
<it least a one-shot visit by the students. It's up
to us to give them .1 reason to return. Students
will respond to that type of thinking."
"Sure Dick," I said to myself. "This is Stan
ford, not Notre Dame. . . Most student here
would no sooner go to a basketball game than
to a California fundraising dinner. . . Anyone
who would suggest going to a game is consi
dered either bored or eccentric. . . Pick a stu
dent at random on campus, ask him what a
pick-and-roll is, and he'll probably tell you it's
the latest dance."
Dißiaso went 011 to say: "1 know, and the
players know, that we don't have any super
athletes. Hut they're super hard workers."
'Here we go again'
"Here we go again. ..." I continued to my
self, ". . . the old no-talent-but-hard-workers
routine. . . I've heard it a thousand times before
— mostly excuses. . . 1 mean, look ;it this team
. . . just six returning lettermen . . . only one
returning starter . . . no guards who have
shown the ability to score consistently . . .
questionable rebounding . . . maybe we can
beat Washington State . . . the Cougars are al
ways good for a win or two when the chips are
down. . ."
I guess 1 shouldn't have been so cynical.
Looking back 011 Stanford's games so far. 1
don't think I've enjoyed basketball so much
since watching the Golden State Warriors pull
upset after upset on their way to the National
Basketball Association championship last
spring. But on the Farm, we're talking about a
team that's 6-10 overall and 1-4 in the Pacific
Eight.
Personally, it doesn't seem to matter. For the
first time in I don't know how long, the Cards
are fun to watch. They don't give up. which
was especially obvious in the Cal game, but
also true in Los Angeles two weekends ago;
I hey run when thev can and don't when they

can't; they rebound vigorously; and, most im
portantly. they coordinate their talents.
Great afternoon
All this is consistent with Dißiaso's
philosophy of "intensity" and "maximum ef
fort." Knowing Stanford does nut have some of
the personnel of other Pac-8 teams, he has
given top priority to getting the most out of
what he does have. So what's more important:
the fact that the (lards did everything they
could against Cal Saturday and made a great
game out of a shooting exhibition by the Bears,
or the fact that they came up a little short in the
end? I would like to thank Dißiaso and the
(lards for a great afternoon.
Another appealing element of Dißiaso's
team is that the players' talents and per
sonalities surface well under his system. Last
year, with the Stanford offense built around
Rich Kelley. excitement was limited to watch
ing the big center bank a short shot off the
glass, or, for variety, watching Ed Schweitzer
pop a medium-range jumper. None of the other
three starters — Scott Trobbe, Mel Arterberry,
or MarkGilberg — could do anything particu
larly well. I'm surprised 1 still remember their
names.
This year's team may be a bit more unrefined
due to inexperience, but it's more balanced,
adding to your viewing pleasure. First, there's
George "The Swan" Schader, whose soft out
side touch and bulldozer tactics inside proba
bly give him a higher shooting pecentage from
long distances than from under the basket.
Then there's Tim Patterson, whose shooting
ability is almost as extraordinary as his lack of
speed. Schweitzer is still "Easy Eddy."
Between Mike Bratz, Jay Carter, Wolfe Perry
and Paul Giovacchini, Stanford's traditional
weakness — outside shooting — is now one of
its strengths. And if Perry ever learns that pas
sing is allowed in basketball as well as shoot
ing, he'll really be something. Give him time.
Give Dißiaso a little time too. I le barely had a
chance to recruit Perry. Schader, Giovacchini
and Jeff McHugh after being named head coach
at Stanford. With more time to develop these
players and to round out the team completely
with his own recruits, he'll turn the Cards into
winners and, I wouldn't doubt, champions. In
the meantime, Dißiaso is showing us that a
transition period can be enjoyed, and not just
end u red.
