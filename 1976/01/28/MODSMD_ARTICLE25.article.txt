# Pac-8 predictions
## 
### 
Last week our prognos
ticator took advantage of sev
eral non-conference mis
matches (Washington i/s. the
Honolulu Service Team and
UCLA vs. UC-Santa Barbara)
to push his prediction percen
tage over .500, proving that
ihe wizard does not pick win
ners randomly. It just seems
that way. In any case, he's on
his way back, having now
picked 15 of 24 games cor
rectly for a .625 percentage.
Stanford flies to Honolulu
today for games against
Hawaii Friday and Saturday
nights. The Rainbows are in
the midst of a seven-game los
ing streak, if you believe the
Stanford Sports Information
Office, or a nine-game losing
binge, if you side with the Palo
Alto Times. Still, the Bows
should win at least one of the
Stanford games.
USC, winless in the Pacific

Eight, takes its problems to
UCLA's Pauley Pavilion.
That's kind of like treating a
frostbite victim with a cold
compress. Look for the Bruins
to win their 95th straight
game at Pauley.
Cat should beat San Jose
State at Berkeley tomorrow at
8 p.m. and probably won't
even need two overtime
periods to do it.
Washington shouldn't have
too much trouble with
Washington State in Seattle.
Oregon and Oregon State
meet tomorrow night in Port
land in a game that has no ef
fect on the Pacific Eight race.
(1) Hawaii over Stanford by 8
(2)Stanford over Hawaii by 2
Cai over San Jose St. by 14
UCLA over USC by 7
Washington over WSU by 10
OSU over Oregon by 6
