# Icemen unbeaten in first three games
## 
### DAVID GEORGETTE 
It's a game played with knives
and clubs, offered an ice hockey
observer. It's the national pas
time of Canada, the domain of
the Philadelphia Flyers and the
sport of eastern colleges not
known for their basketball pro
wess. And college hockey at
Stanford? Why basketball Coach
Dick Dißiaso wouldn't dream of
an ice rink being laid in Maples.
Ah. but you are mistaken.
Stanford does have an ice hoc
key team, and four games into
the 1070 season, the club is un
beaten.
"We have one of the best teams
in the West." says junior left
winger Dannv Schley, president
of the Stanford Ice Hockey Club.
He adds, "I wouldn't be sur
prised if we went undefeated
this year."
Two weeks ago. Stanford's
newly-found hockey strength
was displayed in Sacramento,
when the club took part in a
tournament with five other
Northern California teams. A 5-2
win over the Twin City Flyers
and a 7-3 triumph over San
Diego State were topped off
with a 4-2 win over the Northern
California All-Stars. Not too bad
start, when one considers that
the squad practices once a week
— 10:30 on Sunday night at
Belmont Iceland.
Shortened schedule
This season the team's
schedule has been shortened
due to the scarcity of funding.
Last year, the schedule ran from
October to April, but this time
the season has been squeezed
into winter quarter. Schley takes
an optimistic viewpoint,
though, that the team will be
nefit from, "a good, competitive
spirit." by condensing the sea
son.
The squad closed last year
with a trip to Colorado. This year
all the matches will be pJrned in
California. Unfortunately, due to
limited time at the squad's home
rinks in Belmont. all
the games will be playev. ~ lh<_•
road. Last year Stanford made an
appearance at the Oakland Col
iseum Arena, in a preliminary
game, before an Oakland Seals
contest.

Some of tin? team's travel costs
are covered by the Athletic De
partment out of club sports
funds. The team received
522H5 from tin* club sports fund,
with the total remaining expen
ditures of over $3000 covered by
the ice hockey club members.
Hockey hotbeds
The majority of the team
is from the hockey hotbeds of
Minnesota, Michigan and the
New England area. This is the
eighth year of Stanford hockey
and. "for the first time, we are
blessed with the problem of hav
ing too many good players." said
Schley.
One of these players is junior
left winger Jay Johnston, who
two seasons ago turned on the
red light 50 times with his
wicked left wrist shot. Johnston,
who also plays golf here, was of
fered an ice hockey scholarship
at Brown, but instead chose the
Farm. "It's fun. It's not so
hardcore as elsewhere," said
Johnston. "People realize there's
not that much pressure."
The defense has its stars too.
Steve Janicek. a student in the
Graduate School of Business, is
from Harvard, where he started
for three years and achieved
All-East honors.
Freshman also contribute
heavily to the squad. Schley
calls center ken Breitenbach, "a
damn good hockey player."
Forward Henry Dudley is
another scoring threat in his first
year of competition.
With 45 players, it is some
times difficult to name your
starting lineup. But ice hockey
Coach Pat Baldwin doesn't have
the problems of football Coach
Jack Christiansen. Baldwin, a
computer salesman, has been
involved with Stanford hockey
since its inception. I le played for
Michigan State and was a
member of the Dutch Olympic
ice hockey team.
Why does the 35-year-old
Baldwin still participate in ice
hockey? "It gets me through the
winters. Hockey gave me some
thing and I feel that I should give
it hack something," says
Baldwin. "This is the year to
build the reputation of the
team."

limb, spend their own money and practice on Sunday evening?
