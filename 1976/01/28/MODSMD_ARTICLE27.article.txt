Postal boss seeks funds
WASHINGTON — More tax money will have to
support the Postal Service or Americans must face
continuing increases in mail rates. Postmaster
General Benjamin Bailar said yesterday.
"Unless increased public funding enables us in
the near term to slacken the pace of rate increases,
we may be caught in a vicious cycle of rate in
creases to compensate for volume decreases
brought on by rate increases." Bailar said.
"The types of problems we have faced are not
going to disappear. Inflation, rising costs and de
creasing volume are likely to be with us for the
foreseeable future." he told the Senate Post Office
Committee.
The Postal Service will have lost a total of about
$:i billion by its fifth birthday on July 1. the post
master general said. "In practical terms, we may be
forced to borrow before the end of the fiscal year to
meet our payroll," he said.
Continuing to finance postal deficits by borrow
ing is "only digging your hole a little deeper." he
said.
He supported a proposal by committee chairman
Gale McGee (D-Wyo.) to double the agency's $1.5
billion annual subsidy over the next three years.
He called for a study of whether the traditional
postal services are "essential or even relevant to
future national needs."

Postal boss seeks funds
WASHINGTON — More tax money will have to
support the Postal Service or Americans must face
continuing increases in mail rates. Postmaster
General Benjamin Bailar said yesterday.
"Unless increased public funding enables us in
the near term to slacken the pace of rate increases,
we may be caught in a vicious cycle of rate in
creases to compensate for volume decreases
brought on by rate increases." Bailar said.
"The types of problems we have faced are not
going to disappear. Inflation, rising costs and de
creasing volume are likely to be with us for the
foreseeable future." he told the Senate Post Office
Committee.
The Postal Service will have lost a total of about
$:i billion by its fifth birthday on July 1. the post
master general said. "In practical terms, we may be

meet our payroll," he said.
Continuing to finance postal deficits by borrow

He supported a proposal by committee chairman
Gale McGee (D-Wyo.) to double the agency's $1.5
billion annual subsidy over the next three years.

future national needs."

Postal boss seeks funds
WASHINGTON — More tax money will have to
support the Postal Service or Americans must face
continuing increases in mail rates. Postmaster
General Benjamin Bailar said yesterday.

creases to compensate for volume decreases
brought on by rate increases." Bailar said.

going to disappear. Inflation, rising costs and de
creasing volume are likely to be with us for the
foreseeable future." he told the Senate Post Office

billion annual subsidy over the next three years.

future national needs."

Postal boss seeks funds
WASHINGTON — More tax money will have to
support the Postal Service or Americans must face
continuing increases in mail rates. Postmaster
General Benjamin Bailar said yesterday.
"Unless increased public funding enables us in
the near term to slacken the pace of rate increases,
we may be caught in a vicious cycle of rate in
creases to compensate for volume decreases
brought on by rate increases." Bailar said.
"The types of problems we have faced are not
going to disappear. Inflation, rising costs and de
creasing volume are likely to be with us for the
foreseeable future." he told the Senate Post Office
Committee.
The Postal Service will have lost a total of about
$:i billion by its fifth birthday on July 1. the post
master general said. "In practical terms, we may be
forced to borrow before the end of the fiscal year to
meet our payroll," he said.
Continuing to finance postal deficits by borrow
ing is "only digging your hole a little deeper." he
said.
He supported a proposal by committee chairman
Gale McGee (D-Wyo.) to double the agency's $1.5
billion annual subsidy over the next three years.
He called for a study of whether the traditional
postal services are "essential or even relevant to
future national needs."
