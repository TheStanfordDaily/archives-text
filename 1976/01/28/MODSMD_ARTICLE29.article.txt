# Carla Hills invited first?
## 
### 
Carla Hills, secretary of 1 lousing and
Urban Development and this year's
commencement speaker, "may or may
not have been the first choice" of the
Commencement Speaker Selection
Committee, said Walt Spevak, senior
class president.
Spevak ref used to say whether other
persons had been sent invitations be
fore Hills was invited because of "re
spect to Carla . .. and respect for the
feelings of th<; person or persons who
may have been invited."
Spevak said secrecy concerning any
prior invitations was still necessary
"and the most considerate thing to
do."
Spevak said that, after Hills, the
committee had ranked Jill Conway,
president of Smith College, as second
choice and Robert Coles, a Pulitzer
Prize-winning psychiatrist, as third
choice.
Spevak said Hills definitely had not
been the first choice under considera
tion since September.
