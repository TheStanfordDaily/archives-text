# House prohibits aid for Angola
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The House
ignored a last-minute plea from Presi
dent Ford and voted overwhelmingly
yesterday to halt further American aid
to two Western-backed tactions fight
ing in Angola.
The 323-99 vote left the next move
up to the President. The Senate earlier
approved the prohibition that came in
the form of an amendment to a $90
billion defense npropriation bill.
House Repub.ican Leader John
Rhodes of Arizona said he has received
no indication whether Ford will veto
the bill in an effort to force Congress to
reconsider its decision.
Before the House voted. Ford said
that without U.S. aid, the U.S.-backed
Angolan troops "will be destroyed by
Soviet armaments and a Cuban ex
peditionary force."
Letter from Ford
In a letter to House Speaker Carl Al
bert. delivered moments before the
House vote on a bill to end future aid,
the President added that "failure ot the
United States to take a stand will in
evitably lead our friends and suppor
ters to conclusion about our resolve"
over international conflicts.
Albert, however, said the United
States was not prepared to match the
huge Soviet and Cuban support for its
Angolan faction and Congress should
therefore cut-off U.S. involvement.
"This is a typical Ford operation:
Wave your hand, make a gesture and
that's the end of it," Albert told news
men.
"One thing about foreign aid, milit
ary aid or war itself: you either do
enough or you're better off not doing
anything." Albert said.
Ford veto?
The Angola aid cut-off was attached
to a $112.3 billion 15-month defense
appropriation bill. The White House
has given no indication whether Ford
might veto the bill to try to force Con

grass to reconsider. The Senate earlier
voted 54 to 22 to prohibit further aid.
The cut-off applies only to some $28
million earmarked in the bill for An
gola but congressional staff experts
said the effect would be to cut-off all
U.S. aid.
The staff officer said the House Ap
propriations Committee was told by
Ford administration officials in secret
session last week that only several
hundred thousand dollars in U.S. aid
is left without the new money.
The President's aides told a House
committee Monday that the $28 mill
ion would finance another five oi six
months of U.S. aid during which time
negotiations might be won for a peace
ful end to the Angola lighting.
Last-minute appeal
Ford said in his last-minute appeal to
the House that the Angola dispute
must be resolved by the Angolans
themselves "and not through the ap
plication of brute military force by the
Soviet I Jnion and Cuba.
"I believe that resistance to Soviet
expansion by military means must be a
fundamental element of U.S. foreign
policy." Ford said. He added: "There
must be no question in Angola or
elsewhere in the world of American
resolve in this regard."
Meanwhile, Gen. George Brown,
chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff,
said a victory of pro-Soviet forces in
Angola would be a Soviet "mas
terstroke."
Brown told the House Armed Ser
vices Committee on Monday the result
of such a victory by the Popular Mov
ment for the Liberation of Angola —
MPLA — would be to give the Rus
sians an additional base from which to
threaten vital oil tanker lines to the
United States and Western Europe.
Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld said a victory by the MPLA
would encourage Russia to increase its
efforts elsewhere in Africa.

terstroke."
Brown told the House Armed Ser
vices Committee on Monday the result
of such a victory by the Popular Mov
ment for the Liberation of Angola —
MPLA — would be to give the Rus
sians an additional base from which to
threaten vital oil tanker lines to the
United States and Western Europe.
Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld said a victory by the MPLA
would encourage Russia to increase its
efforts elsewhere in Africa.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The House
ignored a last-minute plea from Presi
dent Ford and voted overwhelmingly
yesterday to halt further American aid
to two Western-backed tactions fight
ing in Angola.
The 323-99 vote left the next move
up to the President. The Senate earlier
approved the prohibition that came in
the form of an amendment to a $90
billion defense npropriation bill.
House Repub.ican Leader John
Rhodes of Arizona said he has received
no indication whether Ford will veto
the bill in an effort to force Congress to
reconsider its decision.
Before the House voted. Ford said
that without U.S. aid, the U.S.-backed
Angolan troops "will be destroyed by
Soviet armaments and a Cuban ex
peditionary force."
Letter from Ford
In a letter to House Speaker Carl Al
bert. delivered moments before the
House vote on a bill to end future aid,
the President added that "failure ot the
United States to take a stand will in
evitably lead our friends and suppor
ters to conclusion about our resolve"
over international conflicts.
Albert, however, said the United
States was not prepared to match the
huge Soviet and Cuban support for its
Angolan faction and Congress should
therefore cut-off U.S. involvement.
"This is a typical Ford operation:
Wave your hand, make a gesture and
that's the end of it," Albert told news
men.
"One thing about foreign aid, milit
ary aid or war itself: you either do
enough or you're better off not doing
anything." Albert said.
Ford veto?
The Angola aid cut-off was attached
to a $112.3 billion 15-month defense
appropriation bill. The White House
has given no indication whether Ford
might veto the bill to try to force Con

grass to reconsider. The Senate earlier
voted 54 to 22 to prohibit further aid.
The cut-off applies only to some $28
million earmarked in the bill for An
gola but congressional staff experts
said the effect would be to cut-off all
U.S. aid.
The staff officer said the House Ap
propriations Committee was told by
Ford administration officials in secret
session last week that only several
hundred thousand dollars in U.S. aid
is left without the new money.
The President's aides told a House
committee Monday that the $28 mill
ion would finance another five oi six
months of U.S. aid during which time
negotiations might be won for a peace
ful end to the Angola lighting.
Last-minute appeal
Ford said in his last-minute appeal to
the House that the Angola dispute
must be resolved by the Angolans
themselves "and not through the ap
plication of brute military force by the
Soviet I Jnion and Cuba.
"I believe that resistance to Soviet
expansion by military means must be a
fundamental element of U.S. foreign
policy." Ford said. He added: "There
must be no question in Angola or
elsewhere in the world of American
resolve in this regard."
Meanwhile, Gen. George Brown,
chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff,
said a victory of pro-Soviet forces in
Angola would be a Soviet "mas
terstroke."
