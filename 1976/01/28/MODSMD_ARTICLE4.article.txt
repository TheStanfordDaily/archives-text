# State senate blocks farm labor funds

### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) â€” A $3.9 mill
ion appropriation needed to enforce
California's landmark farm labor law
for the next five months was blocked
yesterday by a coalition of Republi
cans and farm-belt Democrats.
The state senate's 20-15 vote was
seven short of the 27 aye votes needed
to approve the funds. It increased the
possibility that the state's farm labor
agency could go out of business at least
temporarily Feb. 0.
Supporters won the right to have a
second vote later in the week, but cri
tics of the law predicted Gov. Edmund
Brown Jr. would have to accept some
changes to get the money.
"1 think the votes are pretty firm,"
said Sen. Clare Berryhill (R-Shingle
Springs). a leader of opponents of the
board. "1 don't think there will beany
appropriation until some amendments

are adopted."
Sen. David Roberti, the Los Angeles
Democrat who is carrying the approp
riation bill, predicted Brown would
step up his lobbying for the funds.
The governor had no immediate
comment after the vote. He has said he
is willing to consider changes in the
farm labor law, but not as part of the
appropriation bill.
Meanwhile, about 1,000 United
Farm Worker supporters, many carry
ing banners and chanting, massed on
the Capitol steps to support the ap
propriation.
Jerry Cohen, the union's attorney,
said if the funds are not approved the
UFVV would launch an initiative cam
paign to try to get some of the things it
did not get when the Agricultural
Labor Relations Act was approved last
year.
