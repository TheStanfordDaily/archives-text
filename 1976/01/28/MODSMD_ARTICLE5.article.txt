# Rejected as Ford's running mate
## Bush confirmed to CIA post 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President
Ford's choice of former GOP chairman
George Bush to succeed William Colbv
as director of the Central Intelligence
Agency was confirmed yesterday by
the Senate.
Former CIA director Richard Helms
said, meanwhile, that members of
Congress sometimes did not want to be
told about "dirty tricks."
"On occasion they really didn't
want to know all that much about it
because it could be embarrassing to
them politically" if exposed, Helms
told the Senate Government Opera
tions Committee.
Senate approval of Bush came
nearly three months after he was
nominated. Several Democratic
senators had said that Bush's political
past should disqualify him from hold
ing the highly sensitive post.
Before the vote, Senate Majority

Leader Mike Mansfield told reporters
the Bush nomination would be ap
proved easily, although "there will be
a decided number of votes against
him."
One administration official had es
timated there would be 20 to 25 votes
against the former chairman of the Re
publican party.
In an effort to quiet concerns that
Bush's political ambitions would
further injure public confidence in the
CIA. President Ford has ruled Bush out
as a possible vice presidential running
mate in 1970.
Mansfield said he was "not con
cerned about a politician being named
to that office" and said he believes
Bush will rise above politics once he
takes on the job.
Sen. Thomas Mclntyre (I)-N.l 1.), one
of four members of the Senate Armed

Sevices Committee who opposed the
nomination even after Rush was re
moved from vice presidential consid
eration, argued that "appointment of
so clearly perceived a political figure"
was "certain to insure skepticism."
Mclntyre pointed out that Bush
would be the fourth man to head the
CIA in the last three years. Although
Ford's promise that Hush would not be
his running mate seemed to assure that
Bush would head theCIA for the rest of
the current administration "where is
the guarantee of tenure if anyone other
than President Ford is sworn in" on
Jan. 20, 1977, Mclntyre asked.
In addition to heading the Republi
can party during the second administ
ration of Richard Nixon, Bush, a
former two-term congressman, also
has served as U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations and chief American
representative in Peking.
