## History research expands focus on minorities

"Moving from research on one
minority to another tells me a lot about
the way Americans think." says His
tory Prof. Carl Degler, who is pursuing
research on the history of blacks, na
tive Americans and women.
Degler is one of several history pro
fessors now concentrating their re
search and teaching on the history of
women and various minority groups.
Within the past two years, chicano and
black historians have joined faculty al
ready studying the history of women,
blacks, native Americans and Jews.
Minorities played a more important
role in the past than is commonly
maintained, according to Degler, a re
cipient of the 1971 Pulitzer and Han
croft Prizes for his study on slavery
and race relations in Brazil and the
United States. His course, "Minorities:
Women. Blacks, and American In
dians." stresses the differences and
similarities of the problems and aspi
rations among various minorities and
women.
"Many historians haven't com
prehended what's involved with wo
men's history." says Asst. 1 listory Prof.
Carolynl.ougee.Shesaid the emphasis
should shift from public figures to the
study of everyday life. "Tossing in a
mistress or .1 uueen is not what the

modern historian is trying to do.
"What we're looking at is not
chronology, not political history, not
perhaps even the public experience,
but the private experience in history,"
she adds.
Asst. History Prof. Albert Camarillo,
the University's first chicano history
professor, says he has two aims in
teaching chicano history: to inform

chicanos about their background and
to give non-chicano students an
awareness of the Mexican-American
nations.
He describes chicano history as a
"young, developing field which
changes 10 times as fast as any tradi
tional field." He says chicano history
is now accepted as a legitimate
academic field. Camarillo first taught
chicano history at Stanford last spring.
The History Department also offered
its first Afro-American history classes
last year. Asst. History Prof. Clay Car
son, who was active in the movement
to establish a black studies program at
UCLA, says black history can provide
basic knowledge upon which a black
can build a positive or negative view of
himself.
"If the identity is not there already."
Clay says,"the course won't do it "
Carson says two-thirds of the stu
dents in his class last year were black.
All the professors noted that an
above average number of students in
their classes belong to the group being
studied. Degler says he has to "save
space for men" in his course. Lougee.
who classifies herself as a "rather rabid
and militant feminist," says she has
never had more than three men in her
course on women.
Assoc. Historv Prof. Cavin

Langmuir says a greater than average
number of Jewish students takes his
class on anti-Semitism. Langmuir, a
medievalist, claims to be one of only
two history professors in the country
researching the phenomenon of anti-
Semitism.
He has developed his own model of
prejudice in an attempt to explain how
it becomes rooted in a culture.
Langmuir says "historians typically
tend to talk about success stories" and
he views the question of "why humans
have failed is a negative, equally im
portant pheno me non."
In addition to teaching courses on
women and minorities, the professors
are active in the University minority
and women's communities. Degler is
on the board of the Center for Research
on Women (CROW).
Lougee participated in the study of
Titleof the United State's legal code,
which helped to put women's athletics
on a more equal basis with men's
athletics. She says progress in wo
men's athletics effects a positive
change in attitude toward women.
Camarillo says he is strongly com
mitted to the chicanos on campus. He
says the University is somewhat be
hind other universities in the hiring of
black and chicano professors.

"Moving from research on one
minority to another tells me a lot about
the way Americans think." says His
tory Prof. Carl Degler, who is pursuing
research on the history of blacks, na

Degler is one of several history pro
fessors now concentrating their re
search and teaching on the history of
women and various minority groups.
Within the past two years, chicano and
black historians have joined faculty al
ready studying the history of women,
blacks, native Americans and Jews.
Minorities played a more important
role in the past than is commonly
maintained, according to Degler, a re
cipient of the 1971 Pulitzer and Han
croft Prizes for his study on slavery
and race relations in Brazil and the
United States. His course, "Minorities:
Women. Blacks, and American In
dians." stresses the differences and
similarities of the problems and aspi
rations among various minorities and
women.
"Many historians haven't com
prehended what's involved with wo
men's history." says Asst. 1 listory Prof.
Carolynl.ougee.Shesaid the emphasis
should shift from public figures to the
study of everyday life. "Tossing in a
mistress or .1 uueen is not what the

modern historian is trying to do.

chronology, not political history, not
perhaps even the public experience,
but the private experience in history,"
she adds.
Asst. History Prof. Albert Camarillo,
the University's first chicano history
professor, says he has two aims in
teaching chicano history: to inform

chicanos about their background and
to give non-chicano students an
awareness of the Mexican-American
nations.
He describes chicano history as a
"young, developing field which
changes 10 times as fast as any tradi
tional field." He says chicano history
is now accepted as a legitimate
academic field. Camarillo first taught
chicano history at Stanford last spring.
The History Department also offered
its first Afro-American history classes
last year. Asst. History Prof. Clay Car

to establish a black studies program at
UCLA, says black history can provide
basic knowledge upon which a black
can build a positive or negative view of
himself.
