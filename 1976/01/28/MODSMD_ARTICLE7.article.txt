## Athletic aid 
### 
We commend President Richard Lyman and Athle
tic Director Joe Ruetz for favoring a resolution which
would have established financial aid guidelines for
athletes based on need, at the recent National Col
legiate Athletic Association (NCAA) convention.
We hope Stanford will continue to pursue possible
implementation of regulations which would protest
"needy athletes from unfair financial aid competition
by affluent athletes," in Lyman's words.
While most major conferences opposed the regula
tions which were defeated 120-112 in the NCAA's first
roll-call vote, all Pacific Eight conference teams but
California and USC favored the controversial mea
sure.
It is especially encouraging Stanford took the fore
front in the debate about the issue.
1 lowever, we realize it would be ill-advised for only
Stanford to adopt the regulations because of the com
petitive edge that could harm the athletic program.
