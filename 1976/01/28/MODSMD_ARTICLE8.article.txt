# Brown's leaving
## 
### 
The public ciilm with which
the news of Religious Studies
Prof. Robert McAfee Brown's
resignation has been received
here obscures the meaning and
impact of his decision. It is a ter
rific loss to the University and
leaves a void which is unlikely
to be filled for many years to
come.
I lis leaving means much more
than the loss of one of Stanford's
finest and most devoted
teachers. It means more than the
loss of an outstanding religious
studies professor, though this
loss is particularly painful since
it is now the second in two years
this small department has had to
absorb.
It is .1 loss that neither the de
partment nor the I Jniversity can
absorb, for Robert McAfee
Brown has served a unique role
in his years at Stanford. He has
been a moral leader of such
force, eloquence and consis
tency and inspiration as comes
along, perhaps, only i 11 a genera
tion.
No professor in recent years
has inspired so many students to
.in ethical evaluation and com
mitment in the way Brown has
done.
Force and dynamism
few will argue we are likely to
find a professor anytime in the
near future who will teach Chris
tian ethics with the same force
•ind dynamism. But many fail to
recognize it is the special cour
iiue .ind conviction with which
Brown has lived those
ethics outside the classroom that
has lent so much to his teaching.
For those of us who have wit
nessed with dismay the increas
ing bureaucratization of the
University and professionaliza
tion of its student body over tl\e
last few years. Brown's decision
comes as little surprise.
Some University bureaucrat
may meekly respond Brown is
leaving of his own free will. But
it is difficult to view Brown's de
cision as something other than
one the academic bureaucracy
made inevitable by its growing
insensitivitv to the human as
pects of the education process,
most notably quality teaching.
The managers of the Univer
sity may claim it is academic
quality that is being pursued by
administrative decisions.
No room
If so. it is a quality that finds no
room on the tenured faculty for
some of the most effective and
inspiring young teachers a uni
versity could be privileged to
have: it is a quality out of touch
with the human beings it profes
ses to serve and train; it is a col
dly bureaucratic and profes
sional quality that is being
sought, and it is indicative of a
more widespread syndrome in
the University.
The academic bureaucrats
who have been making the key
decisions here in the last few
years are determined to make
Stanford a great university. I

Larry Diamond II
have always felt, however,
Robert McAfee Brown is very
much the essence of what a great
university is supposed to he ab
out, and his departure at a time
of accelerated pursuit of this
rigidly research-minded stan
dard of "greatness" strikes me as
no coincidence.
One must hope his decision, if
nothing else, might serve to
focus the issue more clearly, and
encourage those who have
quietly watched these unhappy
trends in the University to speak
out with greater vigor.
The greatness of a university
must hti redefined as something
much more than the national
rankings of its faculty in the var
ious departments. It lies in much
more than theamount or distinc
tion or even social significance
of the research it produces.
Educational experience
It is. at least as much, a matter
of the quality of the educational
experience it offers its students.
This involves a direct and
dynamic process of human in
teraction — teaching.
The near-complete emphasis
on research in criteria for faculty
promotions is only one manifes
tation of this general retreat from
emphasis on the more human
aspects of education, but it is
probably the most devastating.
When a commitment to teach
ing so powerful as to earn a
Gores Award for excellence be
comes a noose around the pro
fessional neck of an untenured
professor (as it has for
the second time in less than a
year), the University's values are
clearly in need of a critical
reevaluation. The quality of
teaching we provide our stu
dents, and particularly our un
dergraduates, must be granted
an equal role with research in the
definition of that elusive great
ness we pursue.
Bureaucratization is slowly
but inexorably eroding the
human element in a growing
variety of our institutions.
Depersonalized education
In many universities, educa
tion as well is becoming a deper
sonalized affair, drowned in
large numbers and rigid rules
and standards, trapped between
unavoidable budget constraints
and entirely avoidable budget
priorities which take; increas
ingly little note of the stu
dents there to get an education.
This does not need to happen
here.One would hope Brown's
departure might inspire some
movement against our slow drift
toward research bureaucracy,
though it seems many of those
most concerned about the pro
cess feel powerless to stop it.
The task is now more urgent
and more difficult. We will soon
be without our most eloquent
spokesman for human values in
the University, and he will be
sorely missed.

The public ciilm with which
the news of Religious Studies
Prof. Robert McAfee Brown's
resignation has been received
here obscures the meaning and
impact of his decision. It is a ter
rific loss to the University and
leaves a void which is unlikely
to be filled for many years to
come.
I lis leaving means much more
than the loss of one of Stanford's
finest and most devoted
teachers. It means more than the
loss of an outstanding religious
studies professor, though this
loss is particularly painful since
it is now the second in two years
this small department has had to
absorb.
It is .1 loss that neither the de
partment nor the I Jniversity can
absorb, for Robert McAfee
Brown has served a unique role
in his years at Stanford. He has
been a moral leader of such
force, eloquence and consis
tency and inspiration as comes
along, perhaps, only i 11 a genera
tion.
No professor in recent years
has inspired so many students to
.in ethical evaluation and com
mitment in the way Brown has
done.
Force and dynamism
few will argue we are likely to
find a professor anytime in the
near future who will teach Chris
tian ethics with the same force
•ind dynamism. But many fail to
recognize it is the special cour
iiue .ind conviction with which
Brown has lived those
ethics outside the classroom that
has lent so much to his teaching.
For those of us who have wit
nessed with dismay the increas
ing bureaucratization of the
University and professionaliza
tion of its student body over tl\e
last few years. Brown's decision
comes as little surprise.
Some University bureaucrat
may meekly respond Brown is
leaving of his own free will. But
it is difficult to view Brown's de
cision as something other than
one the academic bureaucracy
made inevitable by its growing
insensitivitv to the human as
pects of the education process,
most notably quality teaching.
The managers of the Univer
sity may claim it is academic
quality that is being pursued by
administrative decisions.
No room
If so. it is a quality that finds no
room on the tenured faculty for
some of the most effective and
inspiring young teachers a uni
versity could be privileged to
have: it is a quality out of touch
with the human beings it profes
ses to serve and train; it is a col
dly bureaucratic and profes
sional quality that is being
sought, and it is indicative of a
more widespread syndrome in
the University.
The academic bureaucrats
who have been making the key
decisions here in the last few
years are determined to make
Stanford a great university. I

Larry Diamond II
have always felt, however,
Robert McAfee Brown is very
much the essence of what a great
university is supposed to he ab
out, and his departure at a time
of accelerated pursuit of this
rigidly research-minded stan
dard of "greatness" strikes me as
no coincidence.
One must hope his decision, if
nothing else, might serve to
focus the issue more clearly, and
encourage those who have
quietly watched these unhappy
trends in the University to speak
out with greater vigor.
The greatness of a university
must hti redefined as something
much more than the national
rankings of its faculty in the var
ious departments. It lies in much
more than theamount or distinc
tion or even social significance
of the research it produces.
Educational experience
It is. at least as much, a matter
of the quality of the educational
experience it offers its students.
This involves a direct and
dynamic process of human in
teraction — teaching.
The near-complete emphasis
on research in criteria for faculty
promotions is only one manifes
tation of this general retreat from
emphasis on the more human
aspects of education, but it is
probably the most devastating.
When a commitment to teach
ing so powerful as to earn a
Gores Award for excellence be
comes a noose around the pro
fessional neck of an untenured
professor (as it has for
the second time in less than a
year), the University's values are
clearly in need of a critical
reevaluation. The quality of
teaching we provide our stu
dents, and particularly our un
dergraduates, must be granted
an equal role with research in the
definition of that elusive great
ness we pursue.
Bureaucratization is slowly
but inexorably eroding the
human element in a growing
variety of our institutions.
Depersonalized education
In many universities, educa
tion as well is becoming a deper
sonalized affair, drowned in
large numbers and rigid rules
and standards, trapped between
unavoidable budget constraints
and entirely avoidable budget
priorities which take; increas
ingly little note of the stu
dents there to get an education.
This does not need to happen
here.One would hope Brown's
departure might inspire some
movement against our slow drift
toward research bureaucracy,
though it seems many of those
most concerned about the pro
cess feel powerless to stop it.
The task is now more urgent
and more difficult. We will soon
be without our most eloquent
spokesman for human values in
the University, and he will be
sorely missed.

The public ciilm with which
the news of Religious Studies
Prof. Robert McAfee Brown's
resignation has been received
here obscures the meaning and
impact of his decision. It is a ter
rific loss to the University and
leaves a void which is unlikely
to be filled for many years to
come.
I lis leaving means much more
than the loss of one of Stanford's
finest and most devoted
teachers. It means more than the
loss of an outstanding religious
studies professor, though this
loss is particularly painful since
it is now the second in two years
this small department has had to
absorb.
It is .1 loss that neither the de
partment nor the I Jniversity can
absorb, for Robert McAfee
Brown has served a unique role
in his years at Stanford. He has
been a moral leader of such
force, eloquence and consis
tency and inspiration as comes
along, perhaps, only i 11 a genera
tion.
No professor in recent years
has inspired so many students to
.in ethical evaluation and com
mitment in the way Brown has
done.
Force and dynamism
few will argue we are likely to
find a professor anytime in the
near future who will teach Chris
tian ethics with the same force
•ind dynamism. But many fail to
recognize it is the special cour
iiue .ind conviction with which
Brown has lived those
ethics outside the classroom that
has lent so much to his teaching.
For those of us who have wit
nessed with dismay the increas
ing bureaucratization of the
University and professionaliza
tion of its student body over tl\e
last few years. Brown's decision
comes as little surprise.
Some University bureaucrat
may meekly respond Brown is
leaving of his own free will. But
it is difficult to view Brown's de
cision as something other than
one the academic bureaucracy
made inevitable by its growing
insensitivitv to the human as
pects of the education process,
most notably quality teaching.
The managers of the Univer
sity may claim it is academic
quality that is being pursued by
administrative decisions.
No room
If so. it is a quality that finds no
room on the tenured faculty for
some of the most effective and
inspiring young teachers a uni
versity could be privileged to
have: it is a quality out of touch
with the human beings it profes
ses to serve and train; it is a col
dly bureaucratic and profes
sional quality that is being
sought, and it is indicative of a
more widespread syndrome in
the University.
The academic bureaucrats
who have been making the key
decisions here in the last few
years are determined to make
Stanford a great university. I

Larry Diamond II
have always felt, however,
Robert McAfee Brown is very
much the essence of what a great
university is supposed to he ab
out, and his departure at a time
of accelerated pursuit of this
rigidly research-minded stan
dard of "greatness" strikes me as
no coincidence.
One must hope his decision, if
nothing else, might serve to
focus the issue more clearly, and
encourage those who have
quietly watched these unhappy
trends in the University to speak
out with greater vigor.
The greatness of a university
must hti redefined as something
much more than the national
rankings of its faculty in the var
ious departments. It lies in much
more than theamount or distinc
tion or even social significance
of the research it produces.
Educational experience
It is. at least as much, a matter
of the quality of the educational
experience it offers its students.
This involves a direct and
dynamic process of human in
teraction — teaching.
The near-complete emphasis
on research in criteria for faculty
promotions is only one manifes
tation of this general retreat from
emphasis on the more human
aspects of education, but it is
probably the most devastating.
When a commitment to teach
ing so powerful as to earn a
Gores Award for excellence be
comes a noose around the pro
fessional neck of an untenured
professor (as it has for
the second time in less than a
year), the University's values are
clearly in need of a critical
reevaluation. The quality of
teaching we provide our stu
dents, and particularly our un
dergraduates, must be granted
an equal role with research in the
definition of that elusive great
ness we pursue.
Bureaucratization is slowly
but inexorably eroding the
human element in a growing
variety of our institutions.
Depersonalized education
In many universities, educa
tion as well is becoming a deper
sonalized affair, drowned in
large numbers and rigid rules
and standards, trapped between
unavoidable budget constraints
and entirely avoidable budget
priorities which take; increas
ingly little note of the stu
dents there to get an education.
This does not need to happen
here.One would hope Brown's
departure might inspire some
movement against our slow drift
toward research bureaucracy,
though it seems many of those
most concerned about the pro
cess feel powerless to stop it.
The task is now more urgent
and more difficult. We will soon
be without our most eloquent
spokesman for human values in
the University, and he will be
sorely missed.
