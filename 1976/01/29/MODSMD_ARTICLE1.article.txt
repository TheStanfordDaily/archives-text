# Bellow a nervous hermit
## 
### CHARLIE HALL DANA GIOIA 
he problem with Saul Bellow, a former attorney
of his once said, is that he's "a great artist, but a
lousy friend.
Bellow, who appeared at Stanford last week in an
unpublicized visit, consistently confirmed this view,
giving the impression of a man able to write warm,
compassionate prose, and yet unable to relax among
a public that has admired his works for more than 20
years
In person, Bellow, 60, who was strongly considered

last year for the Nobel Prize for literature, is formal
and withdrawn. He answers questions curtly and im
personally, never nodding or making any of the ges
tures normally used to help a questioner relax.
A man who cherishes privacy. Bellow seemingly
found his three-day stay on campus a trying experi
ence.
Speaking at Twain his first night here, he bristled
visibly when he had to answer such uninformed ques
tions from students as, "Who are you?" and"I ve
heard your name; why should I know it?"
