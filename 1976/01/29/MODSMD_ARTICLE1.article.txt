# Bellow a nervous hermit
## 
### CHARLIE HALL DANA GIOIA 
he problem with Saul Bellow, a former attorney
of his once said, is that he's "a great artist, but a
lousy friend.
Bellow, who appeared at Stanford last week in an
unpublicized visit, consistently confirmed this view,
giving the impression of a man able to write warm,
compassionate prose, and yet unable to relax among
a public that has admired his works for more than 20
years
In person, Bellow, 60, who was strongly considered

last year for the Nobel Prize for literature, is formal
and withdrawn. He answers questions curtly and im
personally, never nodding or making any of the ges
tures normally used to help a questioner relax.
A man who cherishes privacy. Bellow seemingly
found his three-day stay on campus a trying experi
ence.
Speaking at Twain his first night here, he bristled
visibly when he had to answer such uninformed ques
tions from students as, "Who are you?" and"I ve
heard your name; why should I know it?"

The next day brought little im
provement. When the Daily re
ported that he would appear at
Grove despite Bellow's request
that his visit not be publicized, Bel
low angrily canceled his talk.
His last appearance, a public
reading of his work at Florence
Moore, went more smoothly. Still,
Bellow left immediately after the
reading, declining to answer ques
tions from the large audience.
In addition to his lack of comfort
among large groups, Bellow fre
quently exhibited a surprising lack
of self-confidence during his stay
here as a guest-in-residence.
Dining with such noteable au
thors as short story writer John
Cheever and Wallace Stegner be
fore his reading at Florence
Moore, Bellow grew nervous as
his scheduled appearance grew
near.
Shy whisper
Leaning over to Cheever, Bel
low whispered shyly, "John, you
will pardon me if I make a fool out
of myself, won't you?"
What makes Bellow's lack of
confidence so surprising is his im
posing presence. Although he
stands only five-foot-four, his
poise fills the atmosphere around
him.
Even his most casual stances
seem like conscious poses, and
although his voice is soft, he
speak articulately and with an au
thoritative air.
Bellow's distaste for public
gatherings is nothing new. Ever
since his Adventures of Augie
March, won him widespread
acclaim and the first of three Na

tional Book Awards in 1953, Bel
low's artistic gift almost inevitably
has separated him from others.
"The qualities that make Bellow
a great writer are the things at
which people take offense. He
picks up everything," Cheever
said last week.
Bellow's problem, Cheever
claims, is that "people demand
that he has this power of observa
tion in his novels, but they ask him
to throw it away in a social set
ting."
But more important is Bellow's
oft-expressed view that America
presents a hostile environment to
writers and intellectuals.
A major theme
Indeed, his distaste for the de
structive atmosphere in which
American artists must labor is a
major theme of Humboldt's Gift,
Bellow's most recent novel.
The most autobiographical
novel Bellow has written yet,
Humboldt's Gift traces the life of
Von Humboldt Fleisher, a poet
patterned after Delmore
Schwartz, the man who first intro
duced Bellow to New York's liter
ary giants.

As Bellow's alter-ego Charlie
Citrine rises in fame, Fleisher's
renown evaporates. In Bellow's
words, "Humboldt did what poets
in crass America are supposed to
do. He chased ruin and death
even harder than he chased
women."
Cynical view
Later in the book, Bellow pre
sents an even more cynical view
of the American public.
Poets exist, Citrine concludes,
to "justify the cynicism of those
who say, 'If I were not such a cor
rupt unfeeling bastard, creep,
thief, and vulture, I couldn't get
through this. . . Look at the good
and tender and soft men, the best
of us. They succumbed, poor
loonies.'"
Bellow's harsh assessment of
the American public has done little
to dampen its enthusiasm for his
novels. Already the winner of
three National Book Awards, Bel
low finds his newest effort riding
high atop the best seller lists.
Bellow is currently hard at work
at his latest project, an account of
the 1973 Middle East war, which
he covered for Newsday.

AUTHOR ON AUTHOR—Author John Cheever explained that
novelist Saul Bellow (shown here) has a gift of perception which
separates him from others. "People demand that he has this
power of observation in his novels, but they ask him to throw it
away in a social setting."

didn't enjoy giving to questions from uninformed students his first
night here. But tnat was only the first of several incidents that
bothered the renowned novelist during his three-day stay this
week.
