# Cohabiting still violates law here
## BEHIND THE HEADLINES 
### ROY S. JOHNSON 
Many students cohabitating in
groups of more than four unre
lated people (as those described
in the last Thursday cover story)
are living illegally under the Palo
Alto Municipal Code, according to
city officials.
According to the law (Municipal
Code No. 18.04.210), many
groups are eligible presently for
prosecution â€” up to six months in
jail, a $500 fine or both.
But city officials say that most
violators will likely never be pro
secuted as long as their neighbors
don't complain.
A city attorney's office spokes
man said once a violation is re
ported, the law is strictly enforced.
"There are usually complaints
from the neighbors," one
spokesman said. "Usually, there
are too many cars, a lot of noise at
odd hours of the day and things
like that."

"We don't go out looking for
these groups," said a spokesman
for the P.A. Building Inspector.
"But if there are sufficient com
plaints we give the occupants 30
days to legalize the situation. If
nothing is done we sent it to the
city attorney for legal action."
One rental agency in the area
told the Daily that her understand
ing of the law was that if one of the
group owns the house the law
would not apply.
But, the spokesman for the city

attorney stated that ownership
made no difference. "If the four
are unrelated, then it's illegal."
Ordinance
According to the code, under
the zoning ordinance, in a single
family dwelling unit the habitation
of more than four people, of whom
none are related under the legal
definition of a family, is illegal and
is punishable as a misdemeanor.
The code applies only to those
areas of the city designated as
"R1" (or residential areas), and it
does not apply to hotels or board

ing houses.
Most agencies have not had
many instances of groups of stu
dents trying to rent houses
through them. "Most kids hear
about a house for rent by word of
mouth," one agency said, "so we
usually don't have to worry about
it. But, if some did come to
us . . . well, I don't know what we
would do."
No worries?
One Stanford student who
shares a house in Palo Alto with
five other students admitted he
"doesn't sit around and worry"
about the law or possible prosecu
tion.
"If we're going to have a few
people over or even a big party,
we just let the neighbors know and
ask them to bring any complaints
to us, not to the police."
"So far," he continued, "we've
had no problems. As a matter of
fact, some of our neighbors have
come over and partied along."
