# Which local market has the lowest prices?
## The 						Stanford Shopping Bag 
### KEVIN OHLSON 
I don't have to tell you that it
costs money to stay alive. Essen
tial food items such as Triscuits
and potato chips along with per
sonal hygiene products eat up a
lot of student money.
In this space each week I will
have a market survey of selected
items priced at seven loeal stores
— Purity, Safeway, Town & Coun
try Market, Brentwood (inside
Payless Drugstore), All-American
Market, Co-op and Lucky.
All-American Market, 3990 El
Camino; daily 9-10, Sunday 9-9
Brentwood/Payless, 625 El
Camino, Menlo Park; daily
9:3o,Saturday 9-8, Sunday 10-7
Co-op, 164 S. California, Palo
Alto; daily 9-9, Sunday 10-7
Lucky, 3445 Alma, Palo Alto;
daily 9-9, Saturday 9-8, Sunday

10-7
Purity, Stanford Shopping
Center;
Safeway, 525 El Camino,
Menlo Park; daily 9-11, Sunday

Town & Country Market, T&C
Village; daily 9-9, Sunday 10-7
This column will strive to be a
service to the readers, to show
you where the best overall deals
are. Some may interpret this as a
"plug" for local retailers, which I
suppose it is, indirectly. But prices
are checked in person, unan
nounced.
In order to save space, I use an
index system of sorts. Prices of
separate commodities are
grouped and averaged, with the
thought that most people don't
buy just apples, but apples and
also oranges.

The "dairy" category includes
prices on Monterey Jack and
Cheddar cheeses, yogurt and
eggs. "Fruits" includes apples,
bananas and oranges. "Coffee"
contains prices on instant,
freeze-dried and decafeinated
brands. The vegetables priced for
both "canned" and "fresh" are
peas,beans and corn.
"Laundry" is a cross-section of
both liquid and powdered deter
gents. "Hygiene" is a wide variety
of deoderants, toothpaste, tissue,
soap and tampons.
Hamburger, pork chops and
whole frying chickens make up the
"meat" index.
Store brands are used
whenever possible, as well as the
better known name brands. And of
course, quality is something that is
very subjective and cannot be
graded.
Store "specials" such as dis
counted magazines (Safeway) or
Mug root beer for 50 cents a six
pack (Co-op) will also be pointed
out, and only if they are truly spe
cial.
Incidently, beer and liquor
prices will not be compared, be
cause with one exception
(Michelob at Purity is cheaper per
six-pack) there is no difference
per store.

Ideas for future weeks include
comparing such items as ski
supplies (tire chains, skis, boots,
poles, gloves), photographic
supplies, bicycle maintenance
items, stationery supplies, and
perhaps even some tips on how to
shop for such major items as au
tomobile tires, stereos, or what
ever. And it is the whatever that
counts.

This column will strive to be a
service to the readers, to show
you where the best overall deals
are. Some may interpret this as a
"plug" for local retailers, which I
suppose it is, indirectly. But prices
are checked in person, unan
nounced.
In order to save space, I use an
index system of sorts. Prices of
separate commodities are
grouped and averaged, with the
thought that most people don't
buy just apples, but apples and
also oranges.

The "dairy" category includes
prices on Monterey Jack and
Cheddar cheeses, yogurt and
eggs. "Fruits" includes apples,
bananas and oranges. "Coffee"
contains prices on instant,
freeze-dried and decafeinated
brands. The vegetables priced for
both "canned" and "fresh" are
peas,beans and corn.
"Laundry" is a cross-section of
both liquid and powdered deter
gents. "Hygiene" is a wide variety
of deoderants, toothpaste, tissue,
soap and tampons.
Hamburger, pork chops and
whole frying chickens make up the
"meat" index.
Store brands are used
whenever possible, as well as the
better known name brands. And of
course, quality is something that is
very subjective and cannot be
graded.
Store "specials" such as dis
counted magazines (Safeway) or

After all, it's my time and your

I don't have to tell you that it
costs money to stay alive. Essen
tial food items such as Triscuits
and potato chips along with per
sonal hygiene products eat up a
lot of student money.
In this space each week I will
have a market survey of selected
items priced at seven loeal stores
— Purity, Safeway, Town & Coun
try Market, Brentwood (inside
Payless Drugstore), All-American
Market, Co-op and Lucky.
All-American Market, 3990 El
Camino; daily 9-10, Sunday 9-9

This column will strive to be a
service to the readers, to show
you where the best overall deals
are. Some may interpret this as a
"plug" for local retailers, which I
suppose it is, indirectly. But prices
are checked in person, unan
nounced.
In order to save space, I use an
index system of sorts. Prices of
separate commodities are
grouped and averaged, with the
thought that most people don't
buy just apples, but apples and
also oranges.

The "dairy" category includes
prices on Monterey Jack and
Cheddar cheeses, yogurt and
eggs. "Fruits" includes apples,
bananas and oranges. "Coffee"
contains prices on instant,
freeze-dried and decafeinated
brands. The vegetables priced for
both "canned" and "fresh" are
peas,beans and corn.
"Laundry" is a cross-section of
both liquid and powdered deter
gents. "Hygiene" is a wide variety
of deoderants, toothpaste, tissue,
soap and tampons.
Hamburger, pork chops and
whole frying chickens make up the
"meat" index.
Store brands are used
whenever possible, as well as the
better known name brands. And of
course, quality is something that is
very subjective and cannot be
graded.
Store "specials" such as dis
counted magazines (Safeway) or
Mug root beer for 50 cents a six
pack (Co-op) will also be pointed
out, and only if they are truly spe
cial.
Incidently, beer and liquor
prices will not be compared, be
cause with one exception
(Michelob at Purity is cheaper per
six-pack) there is no difference
per store.

Ideas for future weeks include
comparing such items as ski
supplies (tire chains, skis, boots,
poles, gloves), photographic
supplies, bicycle maintenance
items, stationery supplies, and
perhaps even some tips on how to
shop for such major items as au
tomobile tires, stereos, or what
ever. And it is the whatever that
counts.
