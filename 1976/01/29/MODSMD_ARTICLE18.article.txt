# 'Sunshine Boys' delivers clouded humor
## PICKS OF THE FLICKS 
### HOWARD BALDWIN 
One would think that a comedy
from such talented masters as
Neil Simon, George Burns, Walter
Matthau and Herbert Ross would
have an entire audience rolling in
the aisles. Unfortunately, Simon,
playwright and screenwriter, oc
casionally falls flat on his face (as
with Broadway's God's Favorite
recently).
His new film from his own play is
The Sunshine Boys. It pits
Matthau with Burns as two feuding
ex-vaudevillians brought together
after 11 years by Matthau's
nephew (Richard Benjamin) for a
comedy retrospective on ABC. It
is blatantly void of belly laughs
and even disappointing in its de
livery of mild chuckles.
Whoever thought senility was
funny enough to thread together
the whole first act was wrong.
Anyone who has ever lived with it
can only wince instead of laugh at
Matthau's fumbling around with
names and addresses.
Garage audition
He searches for an audition in a
garage, accusing a mechanic of
hiding a studio in the back. When

he finally arrives at the right place
two hours late, he can't remember
the lines. The Gray Panthers
should have fun tearing this film
apart.
Somewhere in the past Simon
must have had the importance of
conflict whipped into him by a
sadistic professor (who also in
structed Norman Lear, no doubt).
Conflict is the offspring of disag
reements, so to facilitate its entr
ance, Simon created Willy Clark
(Matthau) as one of the most dis
agreeable people since Archie
Bunker.
Clark constantly and without

reason berates his nephew until
the latter gets ulcers; he refuses to
speak to ex-partner Al Lewis
(Burns) because of the most trivial
details.
Video cousins
There are times when Willy
Clark's video cousins, Archie and
Maude, are funny in their irritation
Matthau, though, just rants and
raves, depending more on the
rather feeble lines he's given than
on his own comedic talent. He
could sue for non-support.
The idea of crotchedy vau
deville comedians seems like a
good basis for a story, but Simon

has monkeywrenched the possi
ble result with his characters.
Clark's being bitchy can be funny
if Lewis is just as bitchy right back
at him. Their conflict is jointly
shared.
However, Lewis as portrayed
by Burns is sweet, lovable and
unassuming. It looks like 55-
year-old Walter Matthau bullying a
benign and helpless 79-year-old
George Burns.
Perhaps the most important as
pect of all, which Simon seems to
have purposely overlooked in his
so-called comedy, is that there
must be a hidden basis of love
between the two characters. The
exacerbation, to be funny, must
be superficial.
No affection?
There is no evidence even
faintly visible of any affection be
tween the two partners, so that
Matthau's verbal assaults on
Burns and the world make him a
frustrated, irritating, senile old
man, which is a funny as a
rainstorm in a dehydrated food
factory.
Simon also uses tragedy to in
troduce more comedy. Jack

Lemmon's nervous breakdown in
The Prisoner of Second Avenue is
the companion to Matthau's heart
attack in The Sunshine Boys.
Instead of furthering the play,
the tragedy here seems to be
used as a crutch because the play
has nowhere else to go. The at
tack doesn't change Clark — if
anything, it makes him worse. And
it certainly doesn't make him fun
nier.
Director Herbert Ross' undeni
able talent is evidenced by his
popular successes like Play It
Again, Sam, The Last of Sheila
and Funny Lady. Here, though, he
has restrained himself by the
choice of the screenplay, allowing
it to remain foremost. The result is
sad instead of funny, a story that
needed reinforcement, rather
than being made inviolate.

playwright and screenwriter, oc
casionally falls flat on his face (as
with Broadway's God's Favorite
recently).
His new film from his own play is
The Sunshine Boys. It pits
Matthau with Burns as two feuding
ex-vaudevillians brought together
after 11 years by Matthau's
nephew (Richard Benjamin) for a
comedy retrospective on ABC. It
is blatantly void of belly laughs
and even disappointing in its de
livery of mild chuckles.
Whoever thought senility was
funny enough to thread together
the whole first act was wrong.
Anyone who has ever lived with it
can only wince instead of laugh at
Matthau's fumbling around with
names and addresses.
Garage audition
He searches for an audition in a
garage, accusing a mechanic of
hiding a studio in the back. When

he finally arrives at the right place
two hours late, he can't remember
the lines. The Gray Panthers
should have fun tearing this film
apart.
Somewhere in the past Simon
must have had the importance of
conflict whipped into him by a
sadistic professor (who also in
structed Norman Lear, no doubt).
Conflict is the offspring of disag
reements, so to facilitate its entr
ance, Simon created Willy Clark
(Matthau) as one of the most dis
agreeable people since Archie
Bunker.
Clark constantly and without

reason berates his nephew until
the latter gets ulcers; he refuses to
speak to ex-partner Al Lewis
(Burns) because of the most trivial
details.
Video cousins
There are times when Willy
Clark's video cousins, Archie and
Maude, are funny in their irritation
Matthau, though, just rants and
raves, depending more on the
rather feeble lines he's given than
on his own comedic talent. He
could sue for non-support.
The idea of crotchedy vau
deville comedians seems like a
good basis for a story, but Simon

has monkeywrenched the possi
ble result with his characters.
Clark's being bitchy can be funny
if Lewis is just as bitchy right back
at him. Their conflict is jointly
shared.
However, Lewis as portrayed
by Burns is sweet, lovable and
unassuming. It looks like 55-
year-old Walter Matthau bullying a
benign and helpless 79-year-old
George Burns.
Perhaps the most important as
pect of all, which Simon seems to
have purposely overlooked in his
so-called comedy, is that there
must be a hidden basis of love
between the two characters. The
exacerbation, to be funny, must
be superficial.
No affection?
There is no evidence even
faintly visible of any affection be
tween the two partners, so that
Matthau's verbal assaults on
Burns and the world make him a
frustrated, irritating, senile old
man, which is a funny as a
rainstorm in a dehydrated food
factory.
Simon also uses tragedy to in
troduce more comedy. Jack

Lemmon's nervous breakdown in
The Prisoner of Second Avenue is
the companion to Matthau's heart
attack in The Sunshine Boys.
Instead of furthering the play,
the tragedy here seems to be
used as a crutch because the play
has nowhere else to go. The at
tack doesn't change Clark — if
anything, it makes him worse. And
it certainly doesn't make him fun
nier.
Director Herbert Ross' undeni
able talent is evidenced by his
popular successes like Play It
Again, Sam, The Last of Sheila
and Funny Lady. Here, though, he
has restrained himself by the
choice of the screenplay, allowing
it to remain foremost. The result is
sad instead of funny, a story that
needed reinforcement, rather
than being made inviolate.
One would think that a comedy
from such talented masters as
Neil Simon, George Burns, Walter
Matthau and Herbert Ross would
have an entire audience rolling in
the aisles. Unfortunately, Simon,
