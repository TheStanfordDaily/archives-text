# Idiocy runs rampant in new Wilder flick
## 
### HOWARD BALDWIN 
How do you like your idiocy? Rare, medium, or
well done? Gene Wilder provides all three kinds in
The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter
Brother.
Wilder has graduated summa cum laude from the
Mel Brooks school of idiocy and Holmes' Brother is
his PhD dissertation, which he wrote, directed and
starred in.
Many ambitious people who attempt this triple
function fall flat on their faces. Only Woody Allen and
Orson Wells (in his heyday) seem capable of pulling
it off until now. Wilder has proved himself far beyond
capable with his stream of sight gags, slapstick,
puns and sexual double entendres.
Wilder plays Sigerson, the extremely jealous
younger brother of, as Sigerson himself puts it,
"Sheer-luck" Holmes.
Sigi (for short) is also a detective, often getting
cases rejected by his brother on occasion. In this
instance Sheerluck uses Sigi as a decoy to lead him
to an important document of the Queen's.
Sigi becomes entrenched in a plot of blackmail
and extortion, lured by the pathological liar Jenny
Hill (Madeline Kahn) and assisted by Sgt. Orville
Sacker (Marty Feldman), the only man in the world
with a photographic sense of hearing.
The cast and sets provide a rich and harmonious
atmosphere. Douglas Wilmer as Sherlock Holmes,
Leo McKern as the nemesis Moriarty and Dom De-
Luise as Gambetti the sloppy and evil opera star

blend beautifully with the foggy London streets to
form a comedy with style.
Regrettable, Wilder takes much of the spotlight for
himself, leaving little for sidekick Feldman (Igor in
Young Frankenstein). The latter has so much talent
that he seems a little wasted.
Feldman's hilarious comic device stemming from
his sense of hearing is not developed to its fullest
extent, which is unfortunate because it is so charm
ingly original.
Madeline Kahn again plays a dance-hall singer,
as she did in Blazing Saddles and At Long Last
Love. Her occupation does have a connection with
part of the action, but it does get tiring seeing her in
the same part all the time. She is a wonderful and
talented comedienne (far surpassing Diane
Keaton), and she adds immensely to the film's suc
cess.
Not to say The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes
Smarter Brother doesn't have its flaws. The final
two-thirds are far funnier and imaginative than the
first third, when the story is being set up. Sometimes
it is just plain idiotic (but then again, there are Brooks
fans who love this) but other times it is close to
brilliant.
The film is an auspicious directorial debut. Wilder
may well give Brooks a run for his money in the
future. He is a touch more restrained and sedate,
while Brooks constantly unearths crudeness in al
most every situation.


TWO FOR TEA —Gene Wilder (I.) portrays Sigi Holmes opposite
Madeline Kahn's Jenny Hill in "The Adventure of Snerlock
Holmes Smarter Brother." The film, Wilder's directorial debut,
brings Mel Brooks — like lunacy to Victorian London.
