# E. German films rare, poignant
## 
### KAUTILYA 
In the 30 years since World War
11, only a few films from East Ger
many have been shown in the Un
ited States — and that was in the
late '40s.
Through February however, the
Pacific Film Archives is sponsor
ing a series of 21 films from the
German Democratic Republic,
and these films are well worth
seeing.
The series presents a rare op
portunity for Americans to view
the product of a nationalized film
industry, a film industry that built
its works around a frame of anti
fascist awareness.
The program opens with the
first feature made under the ban
ner of the new Republic, The Mur
derers Are Among Us (the original
title for Lang's M).
It is generally true that the los
ers make the best movies about a
war. The experiences of the vic
tors are no less terrible, but the
outcome probably dulls their
memories.
Retrospection
Not so with the vanquished.
They have to redeem themselves
by unflinchingly running the scal
pel of artistic retrospection
through the cancer of human evil
that is in their midst. Such an hon
est creation is Murderers.
The story is simple. A surgeon
is disillusioned with war. A hope
less drunk, he rambles through
the ruins of post-war Berlin unable
to overcome his melancholia. A
young artist, Susanna (Hil
degarde Knef), returns from a
concentration camp and shares
her apartment with the wretched

man. Soon her pity turns to love.
The doctor discovers a Nazi
criminal (he had ordered the mas
sacre of a crowd of men, women
and children on Christmas eve)
residing as a respectable citizen
and tries to execute him in the
name of justice. The girl inter
venes in time to save them both.
Socially committed
Though the technique is some
what stilted, it is nonetheless a so
cially committed film with a force
ful style. Wolfgang Staudte did a
remarkable job in conceiving of
such a theme in those times
(1946). His script is restrained,
while his imaginative direction
utilizing the backdrop of the war
torn city, and a sparce musical

STARK REALISM—This confrontation between two characters in "Jacob The Liar" shows the
barren yet incisive staging present in some of the filmed works from East Germany. The series of
21 German fims is sponsored by the Pacific Film Archives.
