# E. German films rare, poignant
## 
### KAUTILYA 
In the 30 years since World War
11, only a few films from East Ger
many have been shown in the Un
ited States — and that was in the
late '40s.
Through February however, the
Pacific Film Archives is sponsor
ing a series of 21 films from the
German Democratic Republic,
and these films are well worth
seeing.
The series presents a rare op
portunity for Americans to view
the product of a nationalized film
industry, a film industry that built
its works around a frame of anti
fascist awareness.
The program opens with the
first feature made under the ban
ner of the new Republic, The Mur
derers Are Among Us (the original
title for Lang's M).
It is generally true that the los
ers make the best movies about a
war. The experiences of the vic
tors are no less terrible, but the
outcome probably dulls their
memories.
Retrospection
Not so with the vanquished.
They have to redeem themselves
by unflinchingly running the scal
pel of artistic retrospection
through the cancer of human evil
that is in their midst. Such an hon
est creation is Murderers.
The story is simple. A surgeon
is disillusioned with war. A hope
less drunk, he rambles through
the ruins of post-war Berlin unable
to overcome his melancholia. A
young artist, Susanna (Hil
degarde Knef), returns from a
concentration camp and shares
her apartment with the wretched

man. Soon her pity turns to love.
The doctor discovers a Nazi
criminal (he had ordered the mas
sacre of a crowd of men, women
and children on Christmas eve)
residing as a respectable citizen
and tries to execute him in the
name of justice. The girl inter
venes in time to save them both.
Socially committed
Though the technique is some
what stilted, it is nonetheless a so
cially committed film with a force
ful style. Wolfgang Staudte did a
remarkable job in conceiving of
such a theme in those times
(1946). His script is restrained,
while his imaginative direction
utilizing the backdrop of the war
torn city, and a sparce musical

barren yet incisive staging present in some of the filmed works from East Germany. The series of

.core is starkly sensitive.
7he delicate performance of the
~O L /ng Knef seems to rise from
oep-felt experiences, and is an
g t ;set to the film. The sad doctor
cannot stand blood and guts any
„ M*e, and he feels mankind is not
th curing. He throws away a
ievs game since there the king is
saved while the pawns are sac
rificed
Only in fairy tales is there a
choice between good and bad, he
asserts; ''or mortals there is just
the lesser of two evils. This lost
soul is saved through the love of
Susanna — an affair whose di
rectness and simplicity are de
picted beautifully.
The film ends on a bitter note as
the cries of the terrified Nazi "I am
innocent" rends the air and the
screen fills up with crosses in a
graveyard. This is indeed an im
portant film with its ominous warn
ing for society. Murders will be
remembered as a classic study of
a great and proud people in defeat

— a national stock-taking in hell.
Jacob the Liar is a modern
film (1974) dealing with Jews in a
Warsaw ghetto. An ordinary,
middle-aged man finds himself in
a strange situation. Due to a mis
understanding, Jacob is forced to
concoct "news" about the ap
proach of Russian liberators
which he learns from a non
existent radio (possession of a
real radio is punishable by death).
These lies give hope to the op
pressed people and keep them
going.
Jacob has a little ward, Una.
She is told fairy tales — her means
of escape from reality as devised
by Jacob. But here too the stifling
present blends in. When, at last,
the transportation of Jews starts,
the truth is revealed, and Jacob's
friend Kowalski commits suicide.
The trains move on.
The tone of despair is lightened
by the deft direction of Frank
Beyer. The tempo is maintained
by polished movie-making —

natural lighting, authentic sets,
and well-chosen details create the
perfect ghetto milieu. The dull im
ages are intercut with recalled fan
tasy.
But above all, the people are
real. The Czech actor Vlastimil
Brodsky won the Best Actor award
at Berlin for his Jacob. And Man
uela Simon is a lovely find for Una.
As the transports roll towards
the unknown, it is only Una who
can look up to the blue sky. Set
free from the hellish reality by her
hopeful innocence, she tries to
comprehend fantasy: "Are clouds
made of cotton wool?" It is a sup
remely poignant moment.
We push back a lump in our
throats and recall the opening
words of the movie. Jurek Becker,
the author, and his father were the
only members in their family to
survive the ghetto and concentra
tion camps. To lie is essential,
Jurek believes. It is a moral right, a
duty perhaps, to lie. Only then can
one aspire to live.

We push back a lump in our
throats and recall the opening
words of the movie. Jurek Becker,
the author, and his father were the

Jurek believes. It is a moral right, a
duty perhaps, to lie. Only then can
one aspire to live.
In the 30 years since World War
11, only a few films from East Ger
many have been shown in the Un
ited States — and that was in the
late '40s.
Through February however, the
Pacific Film Archives is sponsor
ing a series of 21 films from the
German Democratic Republic,
and these films are well worth
seeing.
The series presents a rare op
portunity for Americans to view
the product of a nationalized film
industry, a film industry that built
its works around a frame of anti
fascist awareness.
The program opens with the
first feature made under the ban
ner of the new Republic, The Mur
derers Are Among Us (the original
title for Lang's M).
It is generally true that the los
ers make the best movies about a
war. The experiences of the vic
tors are no less terrible, but the
outcome probably dulls their
memories.
Retrospection
Not so with the vanquished.
They have to redeem themselves
by unflinchingly running the scal
pel of artistic retrospection
through the cancer of human evil
that is in their midst. Such an hon
est creation is Murderers.
The story is simple. A surgeon
is disillusioned with war. A hope
less drunk, he rambles through
the ruins of post-war Berlin unable
to overcome his melancholia. A
young artist, Susanna (Hil
degarde Knef), returns from a
concentration camp and shares
her apartment with the wretched

man. Soon her pity turns to love.
The doctor discovers a Nazi
criminal (he had ordered the mas
sacre of a crowd of men, women
and children on Christmas eve)
residing as a respectable citizen
and tries to execute him in the
name of justice. The girl inter
venes in time to save them both.
Socially committed
Though the technique is some
what stilted, it is nonetheless a so
cially committed film with a force
ful style. Wolfgang Staudte did a
remarkable job in conceiving of
such a theme in those times
(1946). His script is restrained,

7he delicate performance of the
~O L /ng Knef seems to rise from
oep-felt experiences, and is an
g t ;set to the film. The sad doctor
cannot stand blood and guts any
„ M*e, and he feels mankind is not
th curing. He throws away a
ievs game since there the king is
saved while the pawns are sac
rificed
Only in fairy tales is there a
choice between good and bad, he
asserts; ''or mortals there is just
the lesser of two evils. This lost
soul is saved through the love of
Susanna — an affair whose di
rectness and simplicity are de
picted beautifully.
The film ends on a bitter note as
the cries of the terrified Nazi "I am
innocent" rends the air and the

— a national stock-taking in hell.
Jacob the Liar is a modern
film (1974) dealing with Jews in a
Warsaw ghetto. An ordinary,
middle-aged man finds himself in
a strange situation. Due to a mis
understanding, Jacob is forced to
concoct "news" about the ap
proach of Russian liberators
which he learns from a non
existent radio (possession of a
real radio is punishable by death).
These lies give hope to the op
pressed people and keep them
going.
Jacob has a little ward, Una.
She is told fairy tales — her means
of escape from reality as devised
by Jacob. But here too the stifling
present blends in. When, at last,
the transportation of Jews starts,
the truth is revealed, and Jacob's
friend Kowalski commits suicide.
The trains move on.
The tone of despair is lightened
by the deft direction of Frank
Beyer. The tempo is maintained
by polished movie-making —

natural lighting, authentic sets,
and well-chosen details create the
perfect ghetto milieu. The dull im
ages are intercut with recalled fan
tasy.
But above all, the people are
real. The Czech actor Vlastimil
Brodsky won the Best Actor award
at Berlin for his Jacob. And Man
uela Simon is a lovely find for Una.
As the transports roll towards
the unknown, it is only Una who
can look up to the blue sky. Set
free from the hellish reality by her
hopeful innocence, she tries to
comprehend fantasy: "Are clouds
made of cotton wool?" It is a sup

ages are intercut with recalled fan
tasy.
But above all, the people are
real. The Czech actor Vlastimil
Brodsky won the Best Actor award
at Berlin for his Jacob. And Man
uela Simon is a lovely find for Una.
As the transports roll towards
the unknown, it is only Una who
can look up to the blue sky. Set
free from the hellish reality by her
hopeful innocence, she tries to
comprehend fantasy: "Are clouds
made of cotton wool?" It is a sup
remely poignant moment.
We push back a lump in our
throats and recall the opening
words of the movie. Jurek Becker,
the author, and his father were the
only members in their family to
survive the ghetto and concentra
tion camps. To lie is essential,
Jurek believes. It is a moral right, a
duty perhaps, to lie. Only then can
one aspire to live.
In the 30 years since World War
11, only a few films from East Ger
many have been shown in the Un
ited States — and that was in the
late '40s.
Through February however, the
Pacific Film Archives is sponsor
ing a series of 21 films from the
German Democratic Republic,
and these films are well worth
seeing.
The series presents a rare op
portunity for Americans to view
the product of a nationalized film
industry, a film industry that built
its works around a frame of anti
fascist awareness.
The program opens with the
first feature made under the ban
ner of the new Republic, The Mur
derers Are Among Us (the original
title for Lang's M).
It is generally true that the los
ers make the best movies about a
war. The experiences of the vic
tors are no less terrible, but the
outcome probably dulls their
memories.
Retrospection
Not so with the vanquished.
They have to redeem themselves
by unflinchingly running the scal
pel of artistic retrospection
through the cancer of human evil
that is in their midst. Such an hon
est creation is Murderers.
The story is simple. A surgeon
is disillusioned with war. A hope
less drunk, he rambles through
the ruins of post-war Berlin unable
to overcome his melancholia. A
young artist, Susanna (Hil
degarde Knef), returns from a
concentration camp and shares
her apartment with the wretched

man. Soon her pity turns to love.
The doctor discovers a Nazi
criminal (he had ordered the mas
sacre of a crowd of men, women
and children on Christmas eve)
residing as a respectable citizen
and tries to execute him in the
name of justice. The girl inter
venes in time to save them both.
Socially committed
Though the technique is some
what stilted, it is nonetheless a so
cially committed film with a force
ful style. Wolfgang Staudte did a
remarkable job in conceiving of
such a theme in those times
(1946). His script is restrained,
while his imaginative direction
utilizing the backdrop of the war
torn city, and a sparce musical

7he delicate performance of the
~O L /ng Knef seems to rise from

The film ends on a bitter note as

Jacob the Liar is a modern
film (1974) dealing with Jews in a
Warsaw ghetto. An ordinary,
middle-aged man finds himself in
a strange situation. Due to a mis
understanding, Jacob is forced to
concoct "news" about the ap
proach of Russian liberators
which he learns from a non
existent radio (possession of a
real radio is punishable by death).
These lies give hope to the op
pressed people and keep them
going.
Jacob has a little ward, Una.
She is told fairy tales — her means
of escape from reality as devised
by Jacob. But here too the stifling
present blends in. When, at last,
the transportation of Jews starts,
the truth is revealed, and Jacob's
friend Kowalski commits suicide.
The trains move on.
The tone of despair is lightened
by the deft direction of Frank
Beyer. The tempo is maintained
by polished movie-making —

natural lighting, authentic sets,
and well-chosen details create the
perfect ghetto milieu. The dull im
ages are intercut with recalled fan
