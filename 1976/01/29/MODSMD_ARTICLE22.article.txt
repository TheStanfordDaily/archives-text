# 'Snoopy!!!' a delight
## THEATER 
### BOB HENRY 
Anyone who cannot get enough
of the comic strip "Peanuts" —
whether the dosage be from
sweatshirts, greeting cards, imita
tion Hostess Twinkles, or fake
stained glass windows — should
see the musical Snoopy!!! at The
Little Fox Theater.
While many of the one-liners go
over poorly, the delightful blend of
song, dance and humor entertains
admirable — thanks greatly to
superb ensemble acting.
Each actor approaches the per
fect personification of the funny
papers' heroes as Peppermint
Patty, Sally, Lucy, Linus, Charlie
Brown, Woodstock and Snoopy
come wonderfully alive and fulfill
almost all of our expectations.
The characters' declarations
stem from past "Peanuts" adven
tures; they expouse on such to
pics as cloud formations (which
range from the Army-Navy game
to the sack of Carthage), great
pumpkin watching, security, love
and the purpose of education.
Two pianos accompany the

cast, and songs like "Don't Be
Anything Less Than Everything
You Can Be" and "Just One Per
son" inject a little sobriety into
music that includes a spoof on
childrens' education ("I Know
Now") and has a Snoopy
Serenade when the beagle be
comes head of the Daisy Hill
Puppy Farm ("The Big Bow-
Wow").
Add a colorful, crisp set and
brisk direction and one obtains a
light, quick night of Schulzian
humor. Some moments sparkle,
such as Snoopy's captive entr
ance wearing an all-white outfit
decorated by dark glasses and a
huge, beguiling grin and some
moments bore, but most moments
entertain. It all flies by swiftly
enough to ensure success.

In short, it looks like another hit
for The Little Fox. Like The Fan
tastiks, You're a Good Man Char
lie Brown and One Flew Over
The Cuckoo's Nest before it,
Snoopy!!! will probably be around
for some time.
