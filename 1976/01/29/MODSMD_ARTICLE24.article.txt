# Acoustics hurt Stoppard plays
## Two comedies dull 
### BOB HENRY 
The Eureka Theatre's production of two one-acts
by British playwright Tom Stoppard reminds me of a
film at Cubberly — the content is quite good and the
effort looks all right, but that creaky old sound sys
tem distorts matters enough to remove some of the
zip and dull some of the barbs.
The group's theatre is a semi-remodeled room in
an old church at 16th and Market in San Francisco,
and this old barn transforms mediocre diction into
incomprehensible mumblings.
Stoppard's witty lines need articulate enunciation,
and on the whole, the cast does not provide it.
Second-rate speaking can suffice in some buildings,
but not in a room having the acoustics of Candlestick
p ark.
'he first play, After Magritte, is a surrealist com-
Vf°ddy dealing with an inventive detective and a dis
cussion of a one-legged footballer/pajama-clad
street musician — or something like that. The un
even sketch contains some funny moments, but
overall proves a little tedious.

The main course in the comedic repast is The
Real Inspector Hound, a brilliant script which
satirizes British drawing-room murder mysteries
and drama critics.
Moon (Sean O'Kane), the second-stringer who
dreams of someday becoming numero uno, and
Birdboot (Richard Venson), who uses his praise to
seduce attractive actresses, are the two critics who
set out to review a show and end up becoming the
show — or something like that.
Director Diano (Jennie) Ayers has made a crucial
mistake and not placed the two in the real audience.
She has then among an audience of wooden
dummies, at one end of the playing area, and their
location only further obscures the already murky
deliveries.
Placing Moon and Birdboot amid the paying audi
ence not only adds to the theatricality, it brings the
show much closer to the viewer.
The play receives commendable acting and cre
ditable staging; it manages to move along almost
quickly enough.
If the cast could concentrate more on their deliv
ery, the show would improve considerably.
