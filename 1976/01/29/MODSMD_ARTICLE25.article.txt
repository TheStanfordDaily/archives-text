Congress overrides veto
WASHINGTON — President Ford lost his
first battle of the 1976 session with the
Democratic Congress on a spending issue
yesterday.
The Senate, by a comfortable 70-24 mar
gin, joined the House in overriding Ford's
veto of a $45-billion money bill and thus
enacted it into law. The House rejected the
veto Tuesday 310 to 113.
The appropriations measure carries funds
for politically popular health, welfare and job
programs, but it is almost $1 billion over the
President's budget request.
It would increase the federal payroll by
8000 people, Ford said, commenting: "I find it
difficult to believe the majority of the Ameri
can people favor increasing the number of
employes on the federal payroll."
Sen. Edward Brooke (R-Mass), manager
of the bill, answered the President's argu
ments by declaring it was only 2.6 percent
over his budget "which was woefully in
adequate to begin with.''
Sahara fighting continues
ALGIERS, Algeria — Algeria reported
"violent combat" yesterday between Moroc
can and Algerian troops in a cold, bleak area
of the Spanish Sahara as other Arab coun
tries scrambled to avert a desert war bet
ween the two North African neighbors.
There were no independent reports of the
second day of fighting on the rock-covered
plains, and the official Moroccan press
agency said it had no confirmation of the
Algerian communique.
Algeria, which opposes the planned divi
sion of the phosphate-rich territory between
Morocco and Mauritania when Spain ends

colonial rule Feb. 28, said the fight ran from
morning through afternoon.
The Algerian government news agency did
not specify the place but said the clash was in
relation to one Tuesday, reported around
Amghala oasis about 175 miles southwest of
the Algerian border along the Saharan fron
tier with Mauritania. Moroccans have also
clashed in recent weeks with Saharan guerril
las of the proindependent Polisario liberation
front in the area.
There was no mention of casualties or the
number of troops involved yesterday. A
Moroccan official had said there apparently
we many deaths in Tuesday's action.
British in Africa?
LONDON — Dozens of tough looking
British mercenaries, hired to fight in Angola,
flew out of London for Africa yesterday.
They were bound via Brussels for Kinsh
asa, Zaire, which backs the Western
supported liberation group known as the Na
tional Front (FNLA) in neighboring Angola.
The FNLA and its ally, the Nationaf Union,
has been losing to Soviet-backed forces of
the Popular Movement in the civil war for
control of the former Portuguese colony.
The men were generally close-mouthed
and dodged photographers as they went
through security checks and sat drinking tea
awaiting their flights.

But some were quoted as saying they had
been recruited by a firm called Security Ad
visory Services in Surrey, a county south
west of London, and were to be paid $300 a
week, tax free, by the Zaire government.
Between 40 and 50 men departed on a first
flight and about 100 others followed later
yesterday.
"This is a spearhead. There could be a lot
more following," one of the many Scots in the
group said before boarding the plane. He
spoke with a reporter from Brenards, a news
agency specializing in airport coverage.
Rabin talks in D.C.
WASHINGTON — Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin told Congress yesterday his
government is prepared to deal with Palesti
nian representatives who are part of the Jor
danian negotiating team.
But Rabin ruled out negotiating with the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) it
self. The PLO's charter calls for Israel's de
struction, he said, and "no honest being can
blame us for refusing to cooperate in our
national suicide."
Only when the Arab states accept Israel
"will the Palestinian issue be constructively
and finally tackled," he said.
In his speech Rabin said the core of the
Arab-Israeli conflict is the refusal of the Arab
countries "to reconcile themselves to the

right of existence of one, small, viable,
sovereign Jewish state in the land of our
people's birth."
In order to achieve peace, he said, "Israel
is ready to give up much and compromise
much on territory." Along these lines, Rabin
said, he is ready to meet with any Arab head
of government at any time, at any place.
Davis students protest
DAVIS — An estimated 150 Chicano stu
dents and their supporters demand scholar
ships, jobs and buildings from University of
California officials yesterday.
The students presented the demands to
Vice Chancellor Elmer Learn after a four
hour, one-and-a-half-mile march from the
Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity to the centery o>
the UC-Davis campus. Learn promised to
study their four pages of demands and meet
with march leaders tomorrow.
A drinking song used by the fraterni'
"Lupe," triggered the march. One dem
was that the fraternity house be turnr a
to Chicano students and another that thl
fraternity pay for scholarships for two
Chicano students each \ear for 10 years.
They also demanded use of other campus
buildings and more jobs for Chicanos.
March leaders said a fraternity promise tr
stop using the song — which the Chicanos
said contained ethnic slurs — was not
enough. Campus police said there were no
arrests and that the march was without inr
dent.
