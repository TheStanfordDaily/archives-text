OXFORD, Miss. — There I was,
just standing around the lobby of
the Holiday Inn — what else do
you do in Oxford, Miss.? — brows
ing through the Master Charge
applications, when it happened.
A pretty girl in a white track suit
tugged at my elbow and blushed.
As handsome and virile as I am,
you might think girls do this all the
time, but actually they don't. In
fact, it was the first time a pretty
girl in a white track suit ever tug
ged at my elbow in the Holiday Inn
lobby in Oxford, Miss. Much less
blushed.
"Uh, sir," she stammered.
"Let me guess. You want my
autograph?" I said.
"Uh, sort of," she answered.
The conversation was coming
along nicely.
Sign on the line
"Uh, just sign it right here on the
line," she said, handing me a
sheet of notebook paper with sev
eral signatures already scrawled
across the bottom. I glanced at the
other names. What company was
I going to be in here? Robert Red
ford? Henry Kissinger? Judith
Campbell Exner?
If you guessed any of those
names, you were wrong. If you
guessed Theodore Hinckley, you
were right.
You wonder who Theodore
Hickley is? So did I. "Who is
Theodore Hickley?" I asked.
"Oh, he's that guy sitting over
there with the mushroom omelet,"
the girl in the track suit said. (Ox
ford girls say "oh" a lot.)
"Excuse me, but I seem to have
lost track," I said. "Why are you
asking me to sign a sheet of
notebook paper along side a
mushroom omelet?"
"Uh, the mushroom omelet
didn't sign it,"the girl pointed out
perceptively. "The man eating the
mushroom omelet signed it."
More writing
"Oh I answered, pretending to
understand much better than I re
ally did. Trying to look wise, I
glanced back at the paper. Now I
noticed there was writing at the
top. too.
The undersigned solemnly

swear that Becky Robinson sang
"I wish I was an Oscar Meyer
wiener" at the Holiday Inn on
Thursday, Jan. 15, it said.
"Wait a second,'' I said. "I think I
understand. You're Becky Robin
son."
She nodded, staring at the floor
unhappily.
"But I didn't hear you singing

anything about wieners," I said.
"When was that? I've been here
all night."
"Don't make me do it," she said
suddenly, her voice cracking a lit
tle bit."Don't make me say I want
to be a wiener in front of all these
people. "I'll just die. It's a sorority
initiation. Please just sign it and let
me go. If you make me sing I'll
cry." She began to sniff omin
ously.
'Homecoming gueen'
"Here, here," I said, hastily
scrawling my name on the paper.
"You don't even look the least bit
like a wiener. You look like you
could even be homecoming
queen."
"Ole Miss," she sneered at me
as she snatched back the paper,
"did away with homecoming
queens just ages ago." And she
fled.
By now my evening was ruined.
The Master Charge applications
weren't the least bit interesting
any more. In a foredoomed at
tempt to regain my composure I
dragged into the motel bar.
Six bourbon-and-cokes later I
was just beginning to feel brave
enough to start the 200-foot trek to
my room when I heard it, an eerie
whine from the front of the bar.
Oh I wish I was an Oscar Meyer
wiener...
Glares
I spit Jack Daniels all over the
counter, much to the distress of

the couple next to me, who were
just getting down to playing some
serious footsie. They glared at
me.
That is what I really want to
be.. .
"Can't you hear it?" I shrieked.
"They're taking over."
But if I was an Oscar Meyer
wiener. . .
"Who? What are you talking
about?" the man asked, looking
fearfully about for the bouncer. I
ran for the front.
There would soon be nothing
left of me.
The bartender was signing a
sheet of notebook paper by the
time I got there. A girl wearing a
pink mini-skirt that just barely co
vered the bottom of her chin,
flounced out without even bother
ing with any sarcastic remarks.
"You shouldn't have done it," I
mumbled to the bartender as I put
on my coat. "Now they'll be back."
So now I'm sitting in my room. I
can hear them out there, vaguely,
still off in the distance. Cackling
choruses of wiener wish
fulfillment drift through the dark
and it all reminds me of Night of
the Living Dead, only worse.
I wonder if I could drive them
away with a crucifix? A ketchup
bottle? Somebody help. And if I
get out of this I'll never, never
hang around the Holiday Inn in
Oxford. Miss., anymore.Promise.

So now I'm sitting in my room. I
can hear them out there, vaguely,
still off in the distance. Cackling
choruses of wiener wish
fulfillment drift through the dark
and it all reminds me of Night of
the Living Dead, only worse.
I wonder if I could drive them
away with a crucifix? A ketchup
bottle? Somebody help. And if I
get out of this I'll never, never
hang around the Holiday Inn in
Oxford. Miss., anymore.Promise.

OXFORD, Miss. — There I was,
just standing around the lobby of
the Holiday Inn — what else do
you do in Oxford, Miss.? — brows
ing through the Master Charge
applications, when it happened.
A pretty girl in a white track suit
tugged at my elbow and blushed.
As handsome and virile as I am,
you might think girls do this all the
time, but actually they don't. In
fact, it was the first time a pretty
girl in a white track suit ever tug
ged at my elbow in the Holiday Inn
lobby in Oxford, Miss. Much less
blushed.
"Uh, sir," she stammered.
"Let me guess. You want my
autograph?" I said.
"Uh, sort of," she answered.
The conversation was coming
along nicely.
Sign on the line
"Uh, just sign it right here on the
line," she said, handing me a
sheet of notebook paper with sev
eral signatures already scrawled
across the bottom. I glanced at the
other names. What company was
I going to be in here? Robert Red
ford? Henry Kissinger? Judith
Campbell Exner?
If you guessed any of those
names, you were wrong. If you
guessed Theodore Hinckley, you
were right.
You wonder who Theodore
Hickley is? So did I. "Who is
Theodore Hickley?" I asked.
"Oh, he's that guy sitting over
there with the mushroom omelet,"
the girl in the track suit said. (Ox
ford girls say "oh" a lot.)
"Excuse me, but I seem to have
lost track," I said. "Why are you
asking me to sign a sheet of
notebook paper along side a
mushroom omelet?"
"Uh, the mushroom omelet
didn't sign it,"the girl pointed out
perceptively. "The man eating the
mushroom omelet signed it."
More writing
"Oh I answered, pretending to
understand much better than I re
ally did. Trying to look wise, I
glanced back at the paper. Now I
noticed there was writing at the
top. too.
The undersigned solemnly

swear that Becky Robinson sang
"I wish I was an Oscar Meyer
wiener" at the Holiday Inn on
Thursday, Jan. 15, it said.
"Wait a second,'' I said. "I think I
understand. You're Becky Robin
son."
She nodded, staring at the floor
unhappily.
"But I didn't hear you singing

anything about wieners," I said.
"When was that? I've been here
all night."
"Don't make me do it," she said
suddenly, her voice cracking a lit
tle bit."Don't make me say I want
to be a wiener in front of all these
people. "I'll just die. It's a sorority
initiation. Please just sign it and let
me go. If you make me sing I'll
cry." She began to sniff omin
ously.
'Homecoming gueen'
"Here, here," I said, hastily
scrawling my name on the paper.
"You don't even look the least bit
like a wiener. You look like you
could even be homecoming
queen."
"Ole Miss," she sneered at me
as she snatched back the paper,
"did away with homecoming
queens just ages ago." And she
fled.
By now my evening was ruined.
The Master Charge applications
weren't the least bit interesting
any more. In a foredoomed at
tempt to regain my composure I
dragged into the motel bar.
Six bourbon-and-cokes later I
was just beginning to feel brave
enough to start the 200-foot trek to
my room when I heard it, an eerie
whine from the front of the bar.
Oh I wish I was an Oscar Meyer
wiener...
Glares
I spit Jack Daniels all over the
counter, much to the distress of

the couple next to me, who were
just getting down to playing some
serious footsie. They glared at
me.
That is what I really want to
be.. .
"Can't you hear it?" I shrieked.
"They're taking over."
But if I was an Oscar Meyer
wiener. . .
"Who? What are you talking
about?" the man asked, looking
fearfully about for the bouncer. I
ran for the front.
There would soon be nothing
left of me.
The bartender was signing a
sheet of notebook paper by the
time I got there. A girl wearing a
pink mini-skirt that just barely co
vered the bottom of her chin,
flounced out without even bother
ing with any sarcastic remarks.
"You shouldn't have done it," I
mumbled to the bartender as I put
on my coat. "Now they'll be back."
So now I'm sitting in my room. I
can hear them out there, vaguely,
still off in the distance. Cackling
choruses of wiener wish
fulfillment drift through the dark
and it all reminds me of Night of
the Living Dead, only worse.

"They're taking over."
But if I was an Oscar Meyer
wiener. . .
"Who? What are you talking
about?" the man asked, looking
fearfully about for the bouncer. I
ran for the front.
There would soon be nothing
left of me.
The bartender was signing a
sheet of notebook paper by the
time I got there. A girl wearing a
pink mini-skirt that just barely co
vered the bottom of her chin,
flounced out without even bother
ing with any sarcastic remarks.
"You shouldn't have done it," I
mumbled to the bartender as I put
on my coat. "Now they'll be back."
So now I'm sitting in my room. I
can hear them out there, vaguely,
still off in the distance. Cackling
choruses of wiener wish
fulfillment drift through the dark
and it all reminds me of Night of
the Living Dead, only worse.
I wonder if I could drive them
away with a crucifix? A ketchup
bottle? Somebody help. And if I
get out of this I'll never, never
hang around the Holiday Inn in
Oxford. Miss., anymore.Promise.

OXFORD, Miss. — There I was,
just standing around the lobby of
the Holiday Inn — what else do
you do in Oxford, Miss.? — brows
ing through the Master Charge
applications, when it happened.
A pretty girl in a white track suit
tugged at my elbow and blushed.
As handsome and virile as I am,
you might think girls do this all the
time, but actually they don't. In
fact, it was the first time a pretty
girl in a white track suit ever tug
ged at my elbow in the Holiday Inn
lobby in Oxford, Miss. Much less
blushed.
"Uh, sir," she stammered.
"Let me guess. You want my
autograph?" I said.
"Uh, sort of," she answered.
The conversation was coming
along nicely.
Sign on the line
"Uh, just sign it right here on the
line," she said, handing me a
sheet of notebook paper with sev
eral signatures already scrawled
across the bottom. I glanced at the
other names. What company was
I going to be in here? Robert Red
ford? Henry Kissinger? Judith
Campbell Exner?
If you guessed any of those
names, you were wrong. If you
guessed Theodore Hinckley, you
were right.
You wonder who Theodore
Hickley is? So did I. "Who is
Theodore Hickley?" I asked.
"Oh, he's that guy sitting over
there with the mushroom omelet,"
the girl in the track suit said. (Ox
ford girls say "oh" a lot.)
"Excuse me, but I seem to have
lost track," I said. "Why are you
asking me to sign a sheet of
notebook paper along side a
mushroom omelet?"
"Uh, the mushroom omelet
didn't sign it,"the girl pointed out
perceptively. "The man eating the
mushroom omelet signed it."
More writing
"Oh I answered, pretending to
understand much better than I re
ally did. Trying to look wise, I
glanced back at the paper. Now I
noticed there was writing at the
top. too.
The undersigned solemnly

swear that Becky Robinson sang
"I wish I was an Oscar Meyer
wiener" at the Holiday Inn on
Thursday, Jan. 15, it said.
"Wait a second,'' I said. "I think I
understand. You're Becky Robin
son."
She nodded, staring at the floor
unhappily.
"But I didn't hear you singing

anything about wieners," I said.
"When was that? I've been here
all night."
"Don't make me do it," she said
suddenly, her voice cracking a lit
tle bit."Don't make me say I want
to be a wiener in front of all these
people. "I'll just die. It's a sorority
initiation. Please just sign it and let
me go. If you make me sing I'll
cry." She began to sniff omin
ously.
'Homecoming gueen'
"Here, here," I said, hastily
scrawling my name on the paper.
"You don't even look the least bit
like a wiener. You look like you
could even be homecoming
queen."
"Ole Miss," she sneered at me
as she snatched back the paper,
"did away with homecoming
queens just ages ago." And she
fled.
By now my evening was ruined.
The Master Charge applications
weren't the least bit interesting
any more. In a foredoomed at
tempt to regain my composure I
dragged into the motel bar.
Six bourbon-and-cokes later I
was just beginning to feel brave
enough to start the 200-foot trek to
my room when I heard it, an eerie
whine from the front of the bar.
Oh I wish I was an Oscar Meyer
wiener...
Glares
I spit Jack Daniels all over the
counter, much to the distress of

the couple next to me, who were
just getting down to playing some
serious footsie. They glared at
me.
That is what I really want to
be.. .
"Can't you hear it?" I shrieked.
"They're taking over."
But if I was an Oscar Meyer
wiener. . .
"Who? What are you talking
about?" the man asked, looking
