## Sawhill stresses energy for 1976 
### PHILIP FEDER 
The nation's former top energy policy
maker last night said 'few issues touch the
pocketbooks of every American as directly as
does energy'' as he called on presidential
candidates to make public their energy
policies.
John Sawhill, past director of the Federal
Energy Administration, told a crowd of nearly
250 in Cubberley Auditorium, "It's time the
presidential candidates leveled with the
people. We're all looking for the candidates
to tell it like it is."
Sawhill, appointed president of New York
University last May, described the fundamen
tal issues of national energy policy as U.S.
energy independence, energy conservation
and research and development of new
sources of energy.
'Restore confidence'
He also called on the government to "re
store the confidence" of the American
people.
"It is the crisis of confidence that pervades
our national psyche today" which hampers
efforts to introduce a comprehensive energy
program, he said.
The main difficulty, Sawhill said, is the ab
sence of leadership in a government where
we "don't have an active President right
now."
Sawhill called on President Ford to end
governmental control of oil prices which
would allow the market forces to yield an
appropriate price. The government has been

unable "to recognize, articulate and face the
tough choices ahead."
Conservation program
The former energy czar called for a three
day energy conservation program:
—home conservation efforts to take the
form of tax credits to people who install insu
lation and storm windows.
—investment tax credits to business to en
courage more efficient use of energy.
