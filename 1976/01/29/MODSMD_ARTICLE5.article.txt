## Sawhill stresses energy for 1976 
### PHILIP FEDER 
The nation's former top energy policy
maker last night said 'few issues touch the
pocketbooks of every American as directly as
does energy'' as he called on presidential
candidates to make public their energy
policies.
John Sawhill, past director of the Federal
Energy Administration, told a crowd of nearly
250 in Cubberley Auditorium, "It's time the
presidential candidates leveled with the
people. We're all looking for the candidates
to tell it like it is."
Sawhill, appointed president of New York
University last May, described the fundamen
tal issues of national energy policy as U.S.
energy independence, energy conservation
and research and development of new
sources of energy.
'Restore confidence'
He also called on the government to "re
store the confidence" of the American
people.
"It is the crisis of confidence that pervades
our national psyche today" which hampers
efforts to introduce a comprehensive energy
program, he said.
The main difficulty, Sawhill said, is the ab
sence of leadership in a government where
we "don't have an active President right
now."
Sawhill called on President Ford to end
governmental control of oil prices which
would allow the market forces to yield an
appropriate price. The government has been

unable "to recognize, articulate and face the
tough choices ahead."
Conservation program
The former energy czar called for a three
day energy conservation program:
—home conservation efforts to take the
form of tax credits to people who install insu
lation and storm windows.
—investment tax credits to business to en
courage more efficient use of energy.


John Sawhill
—more efficient use of energy in the trans
portation sector and especially concerning
automobiles.
In addition, he proposed a tax on gasoline
that "would signal a future of generally higher
prices." Sawhill said the funds collected
might finance more energy development or
aid in reducing the federal budget deficit.
Americans must begin to accept higher
gasoline prices and "a change in our lifes
tyles" with the energy crisis. But that conser
vation policy does not signal economic stag
nation, Sawhill said.
"The average West German consumes 47
percent of the energy of the average Ameri
can. But West Germans have a very high
standard of living. So energy conservation
does not have to mean lack of ecnomic

growth."
Sawhill contended the U.S. government
needs to be more responsive to public opin
ion. "Decision-making must take into ac
count the national issues," he said. "We had
public forums when I was at the FEA (Federal
Energy Administration) where we gauged the
feelings of the people."
As director of the FEA. Sawhill
spearheaded "Project Independence," the
program which was to give the U.S. some
degree of energy self-sufficiency by 1980.
But late in 1974, President Ford fired
Sawhill for advocating stronger energy con
servation measures than the Administration
was willing to adopt
Interior Secretary Rogers Morton said at
that time Sawhill was being removed for lack
of "executive compatibility."

would allow the market forces to yield an
appropriate price. The government has been

unable "to recognize, articulate and face the
tough choices ahead."
Conservation program
The former energy czar called for a three
day energy conservation program:
—home conservation efforts to take the
form of tax credits to people who install insu
lation and storm windows.
—investment tax credits to business to en
courage more efficient use of energy.


John Sawhill
—more efficient use of energy in the trans
portation sector and especially concerning
automobiles.
In addition, he proposed a tax on gasoline
that "would signal a future of generally higher
prices." Sawhill said the funds collected
might finance more energy development or
aid in reducing the federal budget deficit.
Americans must begin to accept higher
gasoline prices and "a change in our lifes
tyles" with the energy crisis. But that conser
vation policy does not signal economic stag
nation, Sawhill said.
"The average West German consumes 47
percent of the energy of the average Ameri
can. But West Germans have a very high
standard of living. So energy conservation
does not have to mean lack of ecnomic

growth."
Sawhill contended the U.S. government
needs to be more responsive to public opin
ion. "Decision-making must take into ac
count the national issues," he said. "We had
public forums when I was at the FEA (Federal
Energy Administration) where we gauged the
feelings of the people."
As director of the FEA. Sawhill
spearheaded "Project Independence," the
program which was to give the U.S. some
degree of energy self-sufficiency by 1980.
But late in 1974, President Ford fired
Sawhill for advocating stronger energy con
servation measures than the Administration
was willing to adopt
Interior Secretary Rogers Morton said at
that time Sawhill was being removed for lack
of "executive compatibility."

The nation's former top energy policy
maker last night said 'few issues touch the
pocketbooks of every American as directly as
does energy'' as he called on presidential
candidates to make public their energy
policies.
John Sawhill, past director of the Federal
Energy Administration, told a crowd of nearly
250 in Cubberley Auditorium, "It's time the
presidential candidates leveled with the
people. We're all looking for the candidates
to tell it like it is."
Sawhill, appointed president of New York
University last May, described the fundamen
tal issues of national energy policy as U.S.
energy independence, energy conservation
and research and development of new
sources of energy.
'Restore confidence'
He also called on the government to "re
store the confidence" of the American
people.
"It is the crisis of confidence that pervades
our national psyche today" which hampers
efforts to introduce a comprehensive energy
program, he said.
The main difficulty, Sawhill said, is the ab
sence of leadership in a government where
we "don't have an active President right
now."
Sawhill called on President Ford to end
governmental control of oil prices which
would allow the market forces to yield an
appropriate price. The government has been

unable "to recognize, articulate and face the
tough choices ahead."
