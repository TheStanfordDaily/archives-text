### STEVE HEFTER 
SAN FRANCISCO — In a surprise move yesterday, U.S. Dis
trict Court Judge Oliver Carter barred all members of the press
from his interrogation of 36 prospective jurors in the Patricia
Hearst trial.
Only moments earlier, the judge had announced in the main
courtroom that members of the press would be allowed to enter
an adjacent courtroom where the jury selection would take place.
The judge's unexpected announcement left members of the
press stunned and angered. "People will be wondering if the
power of the Hearsts had anything to do with this," stated a
member of the Spanish International Radio network.
At Tuesday's session, three members of San Francisco radio
and television stations had claimed that their rights had been
denied when Randolph and Catherine Hearst requested, and
were granted by Carter, the seats of the reporters.
The Hearsts, according to a representative of KGO television,

were originally supposd to sit behind the press in the second row
of the courtroom, but were later granted seats inside the front
railing.
The Hearsts were also allowed special parking privileges for
their Mercedes Benz, a privilege not normally granted to anyone.
Before the judge questioned each of the 36 prospective jurors
behind closed doors, he said that he would explore the question
of how much each of them knew about Patricia Hearst from the
media.
He asked if any of them had been so isolated as not to have
heard or read about the case. No one replied and a few chuckled.
According to the Associated Press, chief defense attorney F.
Lee Bailey told a news conference after yesterday's jury selection
he expected a jury to be empaneled by the end of this week.
Bailey, answering a question, said he thought it "highly un
likely" that any more portions of the trial would be conducted in
secrecy.
