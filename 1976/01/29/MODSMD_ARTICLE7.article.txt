### ANN AMIOKA KYRA SUBBOTIN 
The possibility of the University allow
ing cohabitation in campus housing is "not
forseeable for quite a while," according to
Assoc. Dean, of Student Affairs Larry Hor
ton.
Horton and seven other administrators
commented on issues ranging from the
popularity of all-women residences to the
possibility of arranging escort services for
women in a discussion last night spon
sored by the ASSU Council of Presidents.
Some 25 persons attended the discus
sion, which was to be centered on how to
improve services to women students.
Horton said he did not consider cohabi
tation "an important issue to the Univer
sity" and that it is "unrealistic" to expect
the University to take a lead "in changing
policies that are highly controversial."
Recognize reality?
When asked by a student why the Uni
versity cannot "go out in front and recog
nize what people are doing," Horton
pointed out that Stanford is a private in

stitution wilh private funding.
Horton asked the audience if "there is a
reason we should keep all-women's
houses."
Pointing out that if all women on cam
pus received their first choice in housing,
the all-female residences would still be
unfilled, Horton commented, "We're
reaching the point where everyone wants
the option kept open, but nobody wants
the option."
ASSU Vice President Josie Jaramillo
suggested that if a women's house had a
theme or seminars associated with it, it
might be "more attractive."
Another student suggested that chang
ing the "dolly image" of all-female houses
might help.

Ralph Keller, director of the Career Plan

McClenahan, director, student health ser
vices; Barbaranne Shepard, fam 1 !/ ser

patrol officer for the Stanford Police, also
answered questions at the discussion


WHO HEARS A HORTON?â€”Almost no one, as only 25 people showed up last night to
hear Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton discuss services to women stu
dents. Financial Aids Director Robert Huff and Family Services Consultant Bar
baranne Shepard were also among the "courageous" administrators who spoke to
the sparse audience.
