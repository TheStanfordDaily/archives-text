# Sherry hours for few majors
## Undergrads not associated 
### LORI MATSUKAWA 
A Council of Presidents' survey sent out
last quarter showed that more than half of the
30 departments which responded have no
undergraduate association.
An undergraduate asociation is a group of
undergraduates with the same major that
produce a formal channel of student input
and provide closer interaction between the
undergraduates and faculty of the depart
ment.
Ten of the departments do have such as
sociations. Of the 18 departments which
have no associations, only five indicated they
would like to see an undergraduate associa
tion formed. They are the mathematics, lin
guistics, classics, chemistry and art depart
ments. The German Studies Department
tried to establish an association, but the prog
ram failed.
Student voice
"The purpose of the survey was to see how
involved students are now in seperate de
partments," said ASSU Vice President Dave
Galligan, who handled the survey. "We'd like
to see how much say students have on such
topics as tenure, promotions, and budget
matters."
"I think we've accomplished a lot," said Bill
MacDougall, a senior and president of the
Economics Undergraduate Association.
"We've organized a number of sherry
hours so undergrads can get to know faculty
members, published a newsletter and or
ganized a lecture series that starts next Mon
day," MacDougall said.
However, concerning department budget
and tenure matters, MacDougall admitted
the association had "not heard a word" and
agreed it would be "a very good thing to have

students sit in on such meetings."
MacDougall mentioned his association
had sent out a survey three years ago which
indicated in part a student desire for "more
radical professors within the department."
"Prof. Don Harris was hired after that,
although I don't know how much impact the
association itself had on that decision," said
MacDougall.
'No opinion'
"I don't really have a strong opinion on the
topic," said Prof. Allan Campbell, acting
chairman of the Biological Sciences Depart
ment, commenting on forming an under
graduate associaton. The department had
indicated on the survey that it was not in
terested in establishing an undergraduate
association.
"If such a committee were to be formed,
the initiative should come from the students.
The department would be willing to cooper
ate as much as possible," said Campbell.
Galligan said Campbell probably didn't
want "arbitrary duplication of duties" if an
undergraduate association were to be
formed.
The Biology Department has voting stu
dent members (both graduate and under
graduate) on their policy board, search and
advising committees who are elected by de
partment majors.
"We have to have a situation like we do
now. Students on committees recommend
activities and these proposals must go
through the proper channels," said
Campbell.
"All input is entirely indirect," said
Campbell.
Galligan belives there should be a change

in the type of input reaching departments.
"We're operating on the assumption that
students do want more say on departmental
matters like tenure and budget," said Galli
gan.
"The Budget Priorities Commission has
said that at their levels it is very difficult for
students to have an impact. They're looking
for input at the specific department level,"
Galligan said.
David Schwartz, a junior and chairman of
the one-year-old Political Science Under
graduate Association, also reported having
sent out a suivey to students seeking opin
ions on "how well the department was doing
its job."
"The most important thing for the associa
tions to do is to bring people within the de
partment together. Right now, there is no
cohesiveness," said Schwartz.
"There is a Political Science Under
graduate Studies Committee that handles
mostly departmental business," said
Schwartz, who is a member of that commit
tee.
However, Schwartz added, students have
no voice in some departmental matters.
Galligan said, "Students are qualified to be
part of departmental decision-making pro
cesses. I assume it goes on, but not as much
as we'd like. Associations should do more
than pass out course guide surveys."
A meeting will be held on Wednesday,
Feb. 4, at 7:30 p.m. in room 133 at Tresidder
where students who are currently active in
undergraduate associations or those in
terested in forming such groups can discuss
"how feasible" a department-wide under
graduate association program would be.
