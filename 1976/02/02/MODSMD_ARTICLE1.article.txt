# Honegger's hearing begins
## 
### BERT BOWER 
A grievance hearing to resolve a per
sonnel complaint filed by Barbara
Honegger, a secretary in the Depart
ment of Psychiatry and Behavioral
Sciences, opened Friday with con
troversy surfacing on hearing proce
dures.
Disagreement centered on the cor
rect procedure for selecting witnesses.
Peter Carpenter, assistant to the vice
president for medical affairs and hear
ing officer for the grievance, said, "I
will talk to whoever I feel I need to talk
with to reach a fair decision."
According to Honegger's grievance
representative Lise Giraud, Carpent
er's plan violates grievance proce
dures which state that any person with
knowledge of the facts should be al
lowed to testify.
Final decision
"Carpenter has reserved the right to
make the final decision of who the
witnesses in the case shall be," said
Giraud, a Main Library cataloguer.
"This is in direct violation of grie
vance policy."
Honegger's personnel grievance al
leges that she was not paid enough
while she worked for Psychiatry and
Psychology Prof. Karl Pribram. Her
grievance, filed Nov. 24, asks that
—Honegger be reclassified from a
secretary II to a higher-paying secret
ary 111 position;
—the reclassification be retroactive
so as to include the time Honegger
worked for Pribram beginning in Sep
tember 1974;
—she be compensated for overtime
pay she claims was withheld; and
—she receive a letter of apology
from the University for the "unreason
able conditions" she claims she
worked under during her 14 months
with Pribram.
Earlier suit
The grievance does not deal directly
/vith Honegger's earlier four-count
civil suit filed Dec. 19. The suit
charges that Pribram "assaulted, beat
and struck" her on Oct. 29.
The suit also claims that Pribram re
peatedly harassed Honegger by "will
fully, intentionally and maliciously
shouting abuse and insults at her,
threatening by gesture her personal
safety, and by violently pounding on
her desk," before the alleged assault.
Pribram filed a denial of the chaiges
in Santa Clara County Superior Court
two weeks ago.
Laboratory sacrifice?

ram overdrafted the grant she was to be
paid from. Because of this, she con

working for him.
She said Pribram's former secretary,
Linda Heider, was in the room when
he promised he would return her to the
higher-paid secretarial classification
upon receiving new grant funds.
Heider agreed with Honegger that
working conditions under Pribram
were "unreasonable." She said the job
pressure, volume of work and respon
sibilities were "impossible" for one
person to handle.
Friday's hearing was primarily to
"set the ground rules" for a series of
meetings expected to follow, Giraud
said.
She accused the administration of
being the "author, judge and jury" of
the grievance hearing and said "the
administration flaunts its own rules to
suit itself."
Procedure problems
According to Giraud, Carpenter has
two administrators permanently sit
ting at the hearings and reserves the
right to remain after the meetings to
confer with them in private while the
"grievant is restricted to herself and
her representative."
Giraud also said that Carpenter has
refused to permit any recording of the
hearings.
Carpenter refused to comment on
these allegations or the specific con
tents of the hearing.
"To discuss the substance of the case
outside the hearing would not be fair,"
he said. "I would not serve the grievant
well by discussing the hearing with
the press."
If the hearing doesn't resolve the
conflict, Honegger can seek outside
arbitration. If it advances to that stage,
a panel of five persons chosen outside
the University by President Richard
Lyman will hear the case.
