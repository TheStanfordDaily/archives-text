# Campaign laws set bad precedent
## 
### 
When Congress wrote the federal election
law in 1974, it attempted to prevent another
Watergate.
After last Friday's Supreme Court ruling,
that law will probably guarantee another
Watergate.
The Court upheld campaign contribution
limits and the periodic disclosure of cam
paign contributions and expenditures, and
public financing for presidential candidates
and national committees.
The court, however, declared limits on
campaign expenditures unconstitutional.
Balancing interests
The Supreme Court agreed that expendi
ture limits did conflict with First Amend
ment rights and thus had to be abolished.
However, then the court balanced the gov
ernmental interests — precluding the pos
sibility of more Watergates — with the First
Amendment's guarantee of freedom of
speech.
The result was what usually happens
when the high court balances: The First
Amendment lost. The court believed that
the societal interests which motivated the
law (the desire for "clean politics") were
greater than upholding this constitutional
guarantee.
However, the Congress also deserves part
of the blame, since it created the legislation
and did its own balancing act. Congressmen
believed the First Amendment would have
to be subordinated to this legislation be
cause huge contributions always looked
suspiciously corrupt.

The insidiousness of these contribution
limits becomes apparent when one consid
ers the contributions congressmen re
ceive /rom the federal government.
For example, congressmen receive about
$1 million per term in payment for such
privileges as airline tickets, franked mail

and stationery. The year in which the fed
eral election law was written and passed,
1974, saw congressmen spending $38 mill
ion on franked mail.
However, the spending of all of their op
ponents added up to just over $20 million.
Now the reason for contribution limits be
comes clear.
In his dissent, Chief Justice Warren
Burger said, "For me, contributions and ex
penditures are two sides of the same First
Amendment coin."Burger believed neither
should have limits imposed.
Unknowns damaged
The contribution limits will inflict the
greatest damage to relatively unknown
candidates.

These challengers have an enormous
burden in trying to collect funds through a
system with imposed contribution limits. A
few big contributions are what usually gets
the unknowncandidate's campaign off to a
good start.
Meanwhile, the incumbent who voted in
favor of this act is appearing on the TV
news, receiving newspaper coverage and
sending frequent mailings (which the gov
ernment pays for) to his constituents.
The most frightening aspect of this deci
sion is that it will act as a precedent. First,
speech costs money, and by limiting con
tributions congressmen have now found a
way to diminish speech about themselves
by anyone who would dare to run against
them.
Congress inactive
Also, the federal election law was about
the only legislation to come out of Water
gate. Even though illegal and large cam
paign contributions played a large role in
that affair, why hasn't Congress passed
other laws directed at other root causes of
Watergate?
The federal election law is just another
example of one set of laws for congressmen
and another for the rest of the citizenry.
Even worse, the Supreme Court's recent
interpretation of the First Amendment is
more shocking, since the court must soon
consider whether gag orders abridge the
freedom of the press.

ers the contributions congressmen re
ceive /rom the federal government.
For example, congressmen receive about
$1 million per term in payment for such
privileges as airline tickets, franked mail

and stationery. The year in which the fed
eral election law was written and passed,
1974, saw congressmen spending $38 mill
ion on franked mail.
However, the spending of all of their op
ponents added up to just over $20 million.
Now the reason for contribution limits be
comes clear.
In his dissent, Chief Justice Warren
Burger said, "For me, contributions and ex
penditures are two sides of the same First
Amendment coin."Burger believed neither
should have limits imposed.
Unknowns damaged
The contribution limits will inflict the
greatest damage to relatively unknown
candidates.

These challengers have an enormous
burden in trying to collect funds through a
system with imposed contribution limits. A
few big contributions are what usually gets
the unknowncandidate's campaign off to a
good start.
Meanwhile, the incumbent who voted in
favor of this act is appearing on the TV
news, receiving newspaper coverage and
sending frequent mailings (which the gov
ernment pays for) to his constituents.
The most frightening aspect of this deci
sion is that it will act as a precedent. First,
speech costs money, and by limiting con
tributions congressmen have now found a
way to diminish speech about themselves
by anyone who would dare to run against
them.
Congress inactive
Also, the federal election law was about
the only legislation to come out of Water
gate. Even though illegal and large cam
paign contributions played a large role in
that affair, why hasn't Congress passed
other laws directed at other root causes of
Watergate?
The federal election law is just another
example of one set of laws for congressmen
and another for the rest of the citizenry.
Even worse, the Supreme Court's recent
interpretation of the First Amendment is
more shocking, since the court must soon
consider whether gag orders abridge the
freedom of the press.

When Congress wrote the federal election
law in 1974, it attempted to prevent another
Watergate.
After last Friday's Supreme Court ruling,
that law will probably guarantee another
Watergate.
The Court upheld campaign contribution
limits and the periodic disclosure of cam
paign contributions and expenditures, and
public financing for presidential candidates
and national committees.
The court, however, declared limits on
campaign expenditures unconstitutional.
Balancing interests
The Supreme Court agreed that expendi
ture limits did conflict with First Amend
ment rights and thus had to be abolished.
However, then the court balanced the gov
ernmental interests — precluding the pos
sibility of more Watergates — with the First
Amendment's guarantee of freedom of
speech.
The result was what usually happens
when the high court balances: The First
Amendment lost. The court believed that
the societal interests which motivated the
law (the desire for "clean politics") were
greater than upholding this constitutional
guarantee.
However, the Congress also deserves part
of the blame, since it created the legislation
and did its own balancing act. Congressmen
believed the First Amendment would have
to be subordinated to this legislation be
cause huge contributions always looked
suspiciously corrupt.

The insidiousness of these contribution
limits becomes apparent when one consid
ers the contributions congressmen re
ceive /rom the federal government.

$1 million per term in payment for such
