# Revise Olympic Games

Traditionally, the Olympic
Games have symbolized the in
dividual spirit of competitive
achievement and its unifying in
fluence on individuals of all na
tions.
However, in recent years the
Games have increasingly re
flected a disturbing trend which
might be termed the "de
humanization" of athletics. Un
fortunately, this tendency has
also become widespread'
throughout all sports competi
tion in the United States.
The Munich fiasco of 1972
clearly exemplified a simultane
ous de-emphasis on individual
accomplishment and intrusion
of political prejudices. Large
discrepancies were frequent be
tween judges' scores of a per
formance, dependent largely
upon the judge's national origin
with respect to that of the com
petitor.
The United States-Soviet
Union basketball final was cer
tainly won through political in-"
fluence rather than athletic skill.
Many young athletes saw years
of intense training unfairly
wasted because of national bias;
several Israeli competitors lost
much more.
In a similar fashion, college,
athletics in the United States has
lost sight of the fact that the
value of physical competition
lies with the individual. Athletic
budgets lean heavily toward
team sports such as football and
basketball; only the leftovers are
allocated to the more persona)
competition found in tennis,
track, gynmastics, swimming
and wrestling.
Media coverage is guilty of a
similar bias; public attention
and attendance is shifted to team
sports, where individual
achievement is least well
expressed.
It is clear a major change in
attitudes toward sports competi
tion is warranted both in this
country and on an international
scale. Elimination of the tradi
tional score compilation by
country in the Olympics is one
valid recommendation.
Another might be to make pei
sonal involvement rather tha
winning the primary purpose i
college athletics, so that mort
individuals may experience the
thrill of victory and the agony of
defeat. Athletic performance is a
form of individual expression,
and like music or art, should be
the right of all to engage in and
display.
