Bellow mistreated
Editor:
Contrary to the Jan. 29 Thurs
day lead article, Saul Bellow did
not angrily cancel an appearance
at Grove House because of the
Daily's announcement of the
visit. As the person responsible
for Bellow's schedule, I cancel
ed tht: Grove meeting when we
discovered we had scheduled
Bellow too heavily. That deter
mination was made before Bel
low ever saw the Daily.
As it was, Bellow participated
in five significant meetings with
students and faculty in three
days, a minimum of twelve in
tensive hours. He was also en
gaged in his own work and was
meeting with old colleagues and
friends. The truth is that Bellow
was generous with his time here.
The Daily article's caricature
of Bellow's personality is not
recognizable to me as the man
who visited here last week. I do
not believe he found his campus
visit a trying experience, but I do
believe he could rightly find the
Thursday article downright in
sulting.

I wish to commend the Daily
for its stern handling of Saul Bel
low.
Let us hope the "nervous her
mit," now back in his native
Chicago and writing his
poems or whatever, will have
learned one does not dine with
Stanford students, or talk with
them, or read to them, with im
punity.
Well might he have found his
stay on the campus a "trying ex
perience," and well might he
have been "unable to relax."
Was that not the wish of those
who, combining an ignorance of
his works with a yahoo arro
gance, bedevilled him with such
questions as "Who are you?"
(That no such questions were ac
tually posed should be no reflec

tion on the Daily reporters or on
their delight in seeing Bellow in
awkward circumstances; they
merely misheard questions
much more elaborately insol
ent.)
Nervous though he might
have been made, Bellow, our in
vited guest, might nonetheless
have gained at Stanford some
further confirmation for his
peculiar notion that America
presents a "hostile environ
ment" to artists.
The graceless baiting to which
Bellow was subjected, in public
and in print, was, we may hope,
not lost on him. May he reflect
on it some day in Sweden.

Editor:
The new rise in student in
terest and activism makes me
truly proud to be associated with
this fine, upstanding, elitist uni
versity.
Yes, the apathy that plagued
most of our universities in the
past half decade is gone. Van
ished into the past like nehru
shirts and Leave It To Beaver re
runs.
Students are now concerned
about matters of vital import to
the future of our university, the
local community, the nation,
and even motherhood and apple
pie. 1 will recapitulate at the ex
pense of being redundant and
repetitive and reiterative and —
well, you get the message.
Pssst . . . Josh is coming. The
University is once again ex
periencing the frantic flutter and
fervid fluster of furious fanati
cism. Such fervor has been ab
sent from our extracurricular ac
tivities since those heated days
of passionate debate concerning
such earth shattering topics like
school mascots and commence
ment speakers. Can you re
member?
So, in light of all this renewed

student interest and curiousity
("josh who?"), I will submit my
opinion on the proliferation of
propaganda posters that litter
our campus.
As an atheist conservative
sexist freshman. I don't like to
see the walls, bulletin boards
and doors plastered with signs
and notices. I still refuse to at
tend any of those rabble-rousing
Alliance for Radical Change lec
tures, or that film series spon
sored by the Jewish Skiing Law
Society, or those feminist lec
tures that try to take away your
manhood and masculinity —
and I can't even go to the Senior
Class Boat Dance.
For the sake of being equita
ble, I will say I hate all of the
signs. I would like to be able to
sit in the bathroom and read my
Header's Digest without visual
distraction.
Either Josh (and everyone else)
has to obey common practice
and leave the blackboards for
mathematical matrices, Marxist
marketing models and
methylethylamine molecules, or
I will feel compelled to take this
matter to the University om
budsman.
And if that fails, 1 will go to the
ASSU Senate — so watch it
buddy. (P.S. 1 hope 1 didn't of
fend anybody with this letter, 1
am only Joshing.)

Pearce Mitchell
Editor:
Now that Director of
University-government Rela
tions Robert Freelen has shed
crocodile's tears over the misery
of the Pearce Mitchell con
dominium owners in his Jan. 27
Daily letter, it may be approp
riate to state that most of us who
live here are very happy with our
occupancy and are neither sol
icitous nor grateful for expres
sion of sympathy.

None of us were forced to buy
condominiums, and most of us
inspected, studied and checked
the project, units and conditions
carefully for several months be
fore we put our money down.
I have not heard from anyone
here who regrets his choice or
wants out. Of course everyone
has a pet peeve — which is par
for the course.
Previously, for nearly six
years, I lived at the Oak Creek
Apartments and liked them so
much I had intended to stay
there indefinitely. But when
Pearce Mitchell came along I
changed my mind and am glad I
did.
Not everything here is perfect.
I have probably given the
Faculty-Staff Housing Office
more trouble than several other
residents combined.
My TV reception was unsatis
factory, my entrance door was

warped, and the walls were tex
tured instead of smooth. But all
of these deficiences have since
been taken care of because 1
squawked loud enough.
Freelen stated some of the
patios are not large enough,
since they seat only four people
comfortably. He also said people
would like a bigger second bed
room or a bigger living or dining
room.
But few residents here would
like to pay the higher price
which bigger facilities would
require.
On the whole, the concept of
the Pearce Mitchell houses is
sound, and despite the inevita
ble shortcomings, this is a com
fortable and pleasant place to
live.

riate to state that most of us who
live here are very happy with our
occupancy and are neither sol
icitous nor grateful for expres
sion of sympathy.

None of us were forced to buy
condominiums, and most of us
inspected, studied and checked
the project, units and conditions
carefully for several months be
fore we put our money down.
I have not heard from anyone
here who regrets his choice or
wants out. Of course everyone
has a pet peeve — which is par
for the course.
Previously, for nearly six
years, I lived at the Oak Creek
Apartments and liked them so
much I had intended to stay
there indefinitely. But when
Pearce Mitchell came along I
changed my mind and am glad I
did.
Not everything here is perfect.
I have probably given the
Faculty-Staff Housing Office
more trouble than several other
residents combined.
My TV reception was unsatis
factory, my entrance door was

warped, and the walls were tex
tured instead of smooth. But all
of these deficiences have since
been taken care of because 1
squawked loud enough.
Freelen stated some of the
patios are not large enough,
since they seat only four people
comfortably. He also said people
would like a bigger second bed
room or a bigger living or dining
room.
But few residents here would
like to pay the higher price
which bigger facilities would
require.
On the whole, the concept of
the Pearce Mitchell houses is
sound, and despite the inevita
ble shortcomings, this is a com
fortable and pleasant place to
live.

Bellow mistreated
Editor:
Contrary to the Jan. 29 Thurs
day lead article, Saul Bellow did
not angrily cancel an appearance
at Grove House because of the
Daily's announcement of the
visit. As the person responsible
for Bellow's schedule, I cancel
ed tht: Grove meeting when we
discovered we had scheduled
Bellow too heavily. That deter
mination was made before Bel
low ever saw the Daily.
As it was, Bellow participated
in five significant meetings with
students and faculty in three
days, a minimum of twelve in
tensive hours. He was also en
gaged in his own work and was
meeting with old colleagues and
friends. The truth is that Bellow
was generous with his time here.
The Daily article's caricature
of Bellow's personality is not
recognizable to me as the man
who visited here last week. I do
not believe he found his campus
visit a trying experience, but I do
believe he could rightly find the
Thursday article downright in
sulting.

I wish to commend the Daily
for its stern handling of Saul Bel
low.
Let us hope the "nervous her
mit," now back in his native
Chicago and writing his
poems or whatever, will have
learned one does not dine with
Stanford students, or talk with
them, or read to them, with im
punity.
Well might he have found his
stay on the campus a "trying ex
perience," and well might he
have been "unable to relax."
Was that not the wish of those
who, combining an ignorance of
his works with a yahoo arro
gance, bedevilled him with such
questions as "Who are you?"
(That no such questions were ac
tually posed should be no reflec

tion on the Daily reporters or on
their delight in seeing Bellow in
awkward circumstances; they
merely misheard questions
much more elaborately insol
ent.)
Nervous though he might
have been made, Bellow, our in
vited guest, might nonetheless
have gained at Stanford some
further confirmation for his
peculiar notion that America
presents a "hostile environ
ment" to artists.
The graceless baiting to which
Bellow was subjected, in public
and in print, was, we may hope,
not lost on him. May he reflect
on it some day in Sweden.

The new rise in student in

truly proud to be associated with
this fine, upstanding, elitist uni
versity.
Yes, the apathy that plagued
most of our universities in the
past half decade is gone. Van
ished into the past like nehru
shirts and Leave It To Beaver re
runs.
Students are now concerned
about matters of vital import to
the future of our university, the
local community, the nation,
and even motherhood and apple
pie. 1 will recapitulate at the ex
pense of being redundant and
repetitive and reiterative and —
well, you get the message.
Pssst . . . Josh is coming. The
University is once again ex
periencing the frantic flutter and
fervid fluster of furious fanati
cism. Such fervor has been ab
sent from our extracurricular ac
tivities since those heated days
of passionate debate concerning
such earth shattering topics like
school mascots and commence
ment speakers. Can you re
member?
So, in light of all this renewed

student interest and curiousity
("josh who?"), I will submit my
opinion on the proliferation of
propaganda posters that litter
our campus.
As an atheist conservative
sexist freshman. I don't like to
see the walls, bulletin boards
and doors plastered with signs
and notices. I still refuse to at
tend any of those rabble-rousing
Alliance for Radical Change lec
tures, or that film series spon
sored by the Jewish Skiing Law
Society, or those feminist lec
tures that try to take away your
manhood and masculinity —
and I can't even go to the Senior
Class Boat Dance.
For the sake of being equita
ble, I will say I hate all of the
signs. I would like to be able to
sit in the bathroom and read my
Header's Digest without visual
distraction.
Either Josh (and everyone else)
has to obey common practice
and leave the blackboards for
mathematical matrices, Marxist
marketing models and
methylethylamine molecules, or
I will feel compelled to take this

And if that fails, 1 will go to the

ment speakers. Can you re
member?
So, in light of all this renewed

student interest and curiousity
("josh who?"), I will submit my
opinion on the proliferation of
propaganda posters that litter
our campus.
As an atheist conservative
sexist freshman. I don't like to
see the walls, bulletin boards
and doors plastered with signs
and notices. I still refuse to at
tend any of those rabble-rousing
Alliance for Radical Change lec
tures, or that film series spon
sored by the Jewish Skiing Law
Society, or those feminist lec
tures that try to take away your
manhood and masculinity —
and I can't even go to the Senior
Class Boat Dance.
For the sake of being equita
ble, I will say I hate all of the
signs. I would like to be able to
sit in the bathroom and read my
Header's Digest without visual
distraction.
Either Josh (and everyone else)
has to obey common practice
and leave the blackboards for
mathematical matrices, Marxist
marketing models and
methylethylamine molecules, or
I will feel compelled to take this
matter to the University om
budsman.
And if that fails, 1 will go to the
ASSU Senate — so watch it
buddy. (P.S. 1 hope 1 didn't of
fend anybody with this letter, 1
am only Joshing.)

Pearce Mitchell
Editor:
Now that Director of
University-government Rela
tions Robert Freelen has shed
crocodile's tears over the misery
of the Pearce Mitchell con
dominium owners in his Jan. 27
Daily letter, it may be approp
riate to state that most of us who
live here are very happy with our
occupancy and are neither sol
icitous nor grateful for expres
sion of sympathy.

None of us were forced to buy
condominiums, and most of us
inspected, studied and checked
the project, units and conditions
carefully for several months be
fore we put our money down.
I have not heard from anyone
here who regrets his choice or
wants out. Of course everyone
has a pet peeve — which is par
for the course.
Previously, for nearly six
years, I lived at the Oak Creek
Apartments and liked them so
much I had intended to stay
there indefinitely. But when
Pearce Mitchell came along I
changed my mind and am glad I
did.
Not everything here is perfect.
I have probably given the
Faculty-Staff Housing Office
more trouble than several other
residents combined.
My TV reception was unsatis
factory, my entrance door was

warped, and the walls were tex
tured instead of smooth. But all
of these deficiences have since
been taken care of because 1
squawked loud enough.
Freelen stated some of the
patios are not large enough,
since they seat only four people
comfortably. He also said people
would like a bigger second bed
room or a bigger living or dining
room.
But few residents here would
like to pay the higher price
which bigger facilities would
require.
On the whole, the concept of
the Pearce Mitchell houses is
sound, and despite the inevita
ble shortcomings, this is a com
fortable and pleasant place to
live.

Bellow mistreated
Editor:
Contrary to the Jan. 29 Thurs
day lead article, Saul Bellow did
not angrily cancel an appearance
at Grove House because of the
Daily's announcement of the
visit. As the person responsible
for Bellow's schedule, I cancel
ed tht: Grove meeting when we
discovered we had scheduled
Bellow too heavily. That deter
mination was made before Bel
low ever saw the Daily.
As it was, Bellow participated
in five significant meetings with
students and faculty in three
days, a minimum of twelve in
tensive hours. He was also en
gaged in his own work and was
meeting with old colleagues and
friends. The truth is that Bellow
was generous with his time here.
The Daily article's caricature
of Bellow's personality is not
recognizable to me as the man
who visited here last week. I do
not believe he found his campus
visit a trying experience, but I do
believe he could rightly find the
Thursday article downright in
sulting.

I wish to commend the Daily
for its stern handling of Saul Bel
low.
Let us hope the "nervous her
mit," now back in his native
Chicago and writing his
poems or whatever, will have
learned one does not dine with
Stanford students, or talk with
them, or read to them, with im
punity.
Well might he have found his
stay on the campus a "trying ex
perience," and well might he
have been "unable to relax."
Was that not the wish of those
who, combining an ignorance of
his works with a yahoo arro
gance, bedevilled him with such
questions as "Who are you?"
(That no such questions were ac
tually posed should be no reflec

tion on the Daily reporters or on
their delight in seeing Bellow in
awkward circumstances; they
merely misheard questions
much more elaborately insol
ent.)
Nervous though he might
have been made, Bellow, our in
vited guest, might nonetheless
have gained at Stanford some
further confirmation for his
peculiar notion that America
presents a "hostile environ
ment" to artists.
The graceless baiting to which
Bellow was subjected, in public
and in print, was, we may hope,
not lost on him. May he reflect
on it some day in Sweden.
