# Stanford finally wins a close game
## Cards split with Hawaii 
### PAUL BAUMAN 
Stanford finally won a game in
the last minute of play rather
than losing it in that fashion.
Naturally, it occurred on the
road, where the only Cards
themselves appreciated it.
Wolfe Perry hit an 18-foot
jumper at the buzzer Saturday
night in Honolulu, to give Stan
ford a 66-65 victory over the
Hawaii Rainbows and a split in
their two-game series. Hawaii
defeated Stanford, 70-53, Friday
evening. Stanford is now 7-11 on
the season while Hawaii is 8-12.
The Robber Barons, who were
behind 31-28 at halftime, were
still down by three, at 65-62,
with just 18 seconds left in the
game. Perry scored on a 12-foot
jump shot with nine seconds
remaining to bring Stanford
within one, at 65-64.
Went out winners
As soon as Hawaii got the ball,
the Cards fouled Rainbow
freshman George Lett, who mis
sed the first free throw in a one
and-one bonus situation. Stan
ford got the rebound and im

mediately called a timeout.
Freshman guard Paul Giovac
chini threw a lead lob pass to
Perry, who pulled up about 18
feet from the basket in the right
corner, jumped his customary
two or three feet and put up a
shot over seven-foot forward
Tommy Barker just before the
buzzer. The shot went in, and
Stanford went out a winner.
"We're very happy to win one
when it looked like the game was
in the books for them," said
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso.
Perry scored a personal and
team-high 19 points on eight of
12 from the field and three of
three from the line. Hawaii
guard Henry Hollingsworth led
both teams in scoring with 21
points.
Stanford blew lead
Stanford led 52-43 with 10
minutes left in the game, but
Hawaii pressed the Barons into
committing several turnovers,
which allowed the Rainbows to
get back into the game.
Hawaii broke a nine-game los
ing streak by beating Stanford

Friday night. The Cards slowed
down the pace of the game in the
first half, as they did against USF
earlier this season, but it didn't
work as well this time. Stanford
was behind 33-17 at the half after
shooting just 25 percent. Ed
Schweitzer scored the Cards'
first field goal with almost 10
and one half minutes gone in the
first half.
Stanford shot only 33 percent
for the entire game,and Ceorge
Schader, with 13 points, was the
only Card to score in double fi
gures. Barker led both teams
with 18 points and 13 rebounds.
'Very physical'
Dißiaso described both teams
as "very physical — almost
brutal."
Hawaiian officials have been
heavily criticized by visiting
coaches for allegedly being
biased toward the Rainbows.
Dißiaso admitted that he was
surprised by a scarcity of whis
tles. Hawaii's Barker was called
for only one foul in both Stan
ford games combined, which is
almost unheard of, except in

Hawaii, for a front-line player
Schweitzer would probibly
agree with Dißiaso's assessment
of the officiating. The senior
forward suffered a cut on the
bridge of his nose.

CALLING LONG DISTANCE—Stanford guard Wolfe Perry, shown here against UC-Davis, hit an
18-foot jump shot at the buzzer to give the Cards a 66-65 win over Hawaii Saturday night.
Stanford finally won a game in
the last minute of play rather
than losing it in that fashion.
Naturally, it occurred on the
road, where the only Cards
themselves appreciated it.
Wolfe Perry hit an 18-foot
jumper at the buzzer Saturday
night in Honolulu, to give Stan
ford a 66-65 victory over the
Hawaii Rainbows and a split in
their two-game series. Hawaii
defeated Stanford, 70-53, Friday
evening. Stanford is now 7-11 on
the season while Hawaii is 8-12.
The Robber Barons, who were
behind 31-28 at halftime, were
still down by three, at 65-62,
with just 18 seconds left in the
game. Perry scored on a 12-foot
jump shot with nine seconds
remaining to bring Stanford
within one, at 65-64.
Went out winners
As soon as Hawaii got the ball,
the Cards fouled Rainbow
freshman George Lett, who mis
sed the first free throw in a one
and-one bonus situation. Stan
ford got the rebound and im

mediately called a timeout.
Freshman guard Paul Giovac
chini threw a lead lob pass to
Perry, who pulled up about 18
feet from the basket in the right
corner, jumped his customary
two or three feet and put up a
shot over seven-foot forward
Tommy Barker just before the
buzzer. The shot went in, and
Stanford went out a winner.
"We're very happy to win one
when it looked like the game was
in the books for them," said
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso.
Perry scored a personal and
team-high 19 points on eight of
12 from the field and three of
three from the line. Hawaii
guard Henry Hollingsworth led
both teams in scoring with 21
points.
Stanford blew lead
Stanford led 52-43 with 10
minutes left in the game, but
Hawaii pressed the Barons into
committing several turnovers,
which allowed the Rainbows to
get back into the game.
Hawaii broke a nine-game los
ing streak by beating Stanford

Friday night. The Cards slowed
down the pace of the game in the
first half, as they did against USF
earlier this season, but it didn't
work as well this time. Stanford
was behind 33-17 at the half after
shooting just 25 percent. Ed
Schweitzer scored the Cards'
first field goal with almost 10
and one half minutes gone in the
first half.
