# Court rules on campaign funding
## Profs discuss impact 
### STEPHEN CROLIUS 
Last Friday's Supreme Court ruling
on the 1974 campaign spending re
form law may have serious implica
tions for the First Amendment, accord
ing to Law Prof. Gerald Gunther.
The court's decision upheld the
$1000 limit on private political con
tributions, but struck down campaign
spending limits for candidates who re
fuse federal matching funds.
The ruling said candidates who ac
cept tederai money must continue to
abide by a $10.9 million limit on
spending in presidential primaries,
$21.8 million limit in presidential
general elections, a $76,000 limit in
races for the House of Representatives,
and population-based limits on spend
ing in senatorial contests.
Ttyi opinion ruled that the law's ex
penditure limits impose "direct and
substantial restraints on the quantity
of political speech," according to the
Associated Press.
Commission reorganized
The court also said the Federal Elec
tions Commission, set up to adminis
ter the law, must be reorganized with
30 days or be prevented from enforcing
the law.
Presently, most of the commission's

members are congressional appoin
tees, and the court said only presiden
tial commissions may engage in law
enforcement.
Cunther said Saturday he is "curi
ous" about the broadness of the court's
decision, due to be released today.
Cunther said one of his major con
cerns is how much "they (the Supreme
Court justices) tried to limit the deci
sion . . . to the peculiar election reform
context.
Worried'
"The broader they wrote the opinion
in terms of the general First Amend
ment framework, the more worried I
will be," he said.
"I do not like to see doctrine that
may justify curtailment of First
Amendment rights (such as freedom of
speech and press)."
The other concern, Cunther said, is
that "no one, including Congress,
knows very much what the impact will
be of these kinds of major changes in
the election process."
Seymour Martin Lipset, senior fel
low at Hoover Institution and political
science professor, said he thinks
"much of the effort to reform finances
in politics, like a lot of efforts to reform
politics, has had a boomerang effect.

"What the (campaign fund reform)
law ironically did was hurt minority
parties more than others since they
(the minority parties) often get support
by getting a few big givers to give a lot
of money since they don't have a lot of
small givers."
Lipset said he believes that the main
plaintiffs in the suit, Sen. James
Buckley (R-N.Y.) and former senator
Eugene McCarthy are justified in many
of tlitih i l !ssci tion .
"My overall impression is that the
McCarthy-Buckley general argument
is right, because the effect of this limi
tation on campaign expenditures is to
inhibit minority candidates more than
mainstream candidates.
"While the people who pressed the
law in the first place were doing it pre
sumably because they wanted to cur
tail the influence of big money in poli
tics, McCarthy and Buckley were argu
ing that big money in politics helps
little candidates," he said.
First Amendment concerns
Cunther, however, professed to be
more concerned about the First
Amendment implications of the deci
sion than about its impact on the elec
tion processes.
"The more I read about the argu
ments and the briefs in the case the
more persuaded I was that there was in
fact a serious First Amendment prob
lem," he said.
"When Common Cause (a public
lobbying organization) first drafted the
law, I had the sense that they were so
overcome with the feeling of the re
form effort that they seemed to assume
that as long as you're dealing with
money, you don't have to worry about
free expression.
"I think it has become clearer
. . . that there are real First Amend
ment problems involved."

spending in presidential primaries,
$21.8 million limit in presidential
general elections, a $76,000 limit in
races for the House of Representatives,
and population-based limits on spend
ing in senatorial contests.
Ttyi opinion ruled that the law's ex
penditure limits impose "direct and
substantial restraints on the quantity
of political speech," according to the
Associated Press.
Commission reorganized
The court also said the Federal Elec
tions Commission, set up to adminis
ter the law, must be reorganized with
30 days or be prevented from enforcing
the law.
Presently, most of the commission's

members are congressional appoin
tees, and the court said only presiden
tial commissions may engage in law
enforcement.
Cunther said Saturday he is "curi
ous" about the broadness of the court's
decision, due to be released today.
Cunther said one of his major con
cerns is how much "they (the Supreme
Court justices) tried to limit the deci
sion . . . to the peculiar election reform
context.
Worried'
"The broader they wrote the opinion
in terms of the general First Amend
ment framework, the more worried I
will be," he said.
"I do not like to see doctrine that
may justify curtailment of First
Amendment rights (such as freedom of
speech and press)."
The other concern, Cunther said, is
that "no one, including Congress,
knows very much what the impact will
be of these kinds of major changes in
the election process."
Seymour Martin Lipset, senior fel
low at Hoover Institution and political
science professor, said he thinks
"much of the effort to reform finances
in politics, like a lot of efforts to reform
politics, has had a boomerang effect.

"What the (campaign fund reform)
law ironically did was hurt minority
parties more than others since they
(the minority parties) often get support
by getting a few big givers to give a lot
of money since they don't have a lot of
small givers."
Lipset said he believes that the main
plaintiffs in the suit, Sen. James
Buckley (R-N.Y.) and former senator
Eugene McCarthy are justified in many
of tlitih i l !ssci tion .
"My overall impression is that the
McCarthy-Buckley general argument
is right, because the effect of this limi
tation on campaign expenditures is to
inhibit minority candidates more than
mainstream candidates.
"While the people who pressed the
law in the first place were doing it pre
sumably because they wanted to cur
tail the influence of big money in poli
tics, McCarthy and Buckley were argu
ing that big money in politics helps
little candidates," he said.
First Amendment concerns
Cunther, however, professed to be
more concerned about the First
Amendment implications of the deci
sion than about its impact on the elec
tion processes.
"The more I read about the argu
ments and the briefs in the case the
more persuaded I was that there was in
fact a serious First Amendment prob
lem," he said.
"When Common Cause (a public
lobbying organization) first drafted the
law, I had the sense that they were so
overcome with the feeling of the re
form effort that they seemed to assume
that as long as you're dealing with
money, you don't have to worry about
free expression.
"I think it has become clearer
. . . that there are real First Amend
ment problems involved."
Last Friday's Supreme Court ruling
on the 1974 campaign spending re
form law may have serious implica
tions for the First Amendment, accord
ing to Law Prof. Gerald Gunther.
The court's decision upheld the
$1000 limit on private political con
tributions, but struck down campaign
spending limits for candidates who re
fuse federal matching funds.
The ruling said candidates who ac
cept tederai money must continue to
abide by a $10.9 million limit on
spending in presidential primaries,
$21.8 million limit in presidential
general elections, a $76,000 limit in
races for the House of Representatives,
and population-based limits on spend
