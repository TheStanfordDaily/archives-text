# Men swimmers dunk Santa Clara Swim Club
## 
### JILL LIEBER 
Both the Stanford men's and
women's swimming teams saw
action this past weekend as they
hosted the Santa Clara Swim
Club last Saturday. The Card
men easily defeated Santa Clara
91-20. The Stanford women
were not as lucky: Santa Clara
downed them 78-26.
Coach Jim Gaughran noted
that Santa Clara, which is always
tough in AAU competition,
swims without its top college ta
lent during the school year and
cited Stanford's John Hencken as
an example.
Its women's team, a more
formidable contingent than its
men wherever it swims, showed
why it's highly rated as it
placed first in all but one event.
Stanford's Rose Storm, who last
week set a national collegiate re
cord in the 50-yard freestyle,
outswam her competition yes
terday in the same event with a
winning time of 24.8 seconds.
One first place
Although they only came up
with one first place, the Card
women were not out of any
races. Anne Brodell swam to a
third-placefinish in the 200-yard
free in 1:57. Junior Vicki Hays'
time of 25.7 in the 50-yard free
earned a third place for the Rob
ber Barons.
In the 100-yard free, which
was the closest event of the day,
Stanford earned second and
third places from Barbara Bacon

with 55.5 seconds and Storm
with 55.6. Santa Clara's Ferierra
was first with 55.3.
It was a low-key meet for the
Card men as they competed in
events other than their usual
"favorites." The swimmers, now
in the middle of the hardest part
of the season, were given a rest
by swimming in different, non
specialized events.
Breast-stroker John Mencken
sprinted to a first place in an
event he rarely swims — the
150-yard free — in 21.4 seconds.
Middle distance swimmer Craig
VanZandt swam to first place
finishes in the 500- and 1000-
yard free in 4:43 and 9:50.5 re
spectively. VanZandt, a senior
200-yard freestyler, has barely
competed in the longer dis
tances since his sophomore year.
The men came out strong and
never let up. Santa Clara was
overpowered in all events. The
400 medley relay team of Nack
Connelly, Hencken, Brian Roux,
and Sandy McDonald blasted
the Santa Clara team with a
3:31.7.
Swept three events
The men swept three events:
the 50 and 200-yard free and the
200 fly. Bill Chao took a first in
the 200-free with 1:43.9, with
Jon Powell at 1:46.1 and Kevin
Reel in 1:46.3 for second and
third. In the 50 free Bruce Cood
win and Sam Franklin were be
hind Hencken with times of 21.8
and 21.9 seconds. And in the 200

fly, Jim Belardi captured first
place with 1:58.4, Brian Roux in
1:58.5 and Franklin in 1:58.7.
In diving competition, Stan
ford swept the one-meter event
with Wayne Wager scoring
228.50 points while teammates
Steve Powell and Tom Pedreira
finished second and third. In
three-meter diving Powell came
out on top of Pedreira with a
score of 224.30.
Next Saturday the Cards'
men's and women's teams travel
to the University of the Pacific
for their first away meet of the
season.

BIG SPLASH—Stanford swimmer Craig VanZandt had a fine day against Santa Clara Swim Club.
VanZandt won the 500 and 1000-yard free. The Cards downed Santa Clara 91-20.
Both the Stanford men's and
women's swimming teams saw
action this past weekend as they
hosted the Santa Clara Swim
Club last Saturday. The Card
men easily defeated Santa Clara
91-20. The Stanford women
were not as lucky: Santa Clara
downed them 78-26.
Coach Jim Gaughran noted
that Santa Clara, which is always
tough in AAU competition,
swims without its top college ta
lent during the school year and
cited Stanford's John Hencken as
an example.
Its women's team, a more
formidable contingent than its
men wherever it swims, showed
why it's highly rated as it
placed first in all but one event.
Stanford's Rose Storm, who last
week set a national collegiate re
cord in the 50-yard freestyle,
outswam her competition yes
terday in the same event with a
winning time of 24.8 seconds.
One first place
Although they only came up
with one first place, the Card
women were not out of any
races. Anne Brodell swam to a
third-placefinish in the 200-yard
free in 1:57. Junior Vicki Hays'
time of 25.7 in the 50-yard free
earned a third place for the Rob
ber Barons.
In the 100-yard free, which
was the closest event of the day,
Stanford earned second and
third places from Barbara Bacon

with 55.5 seconds and Storm
with 55.6. Santa Clara's Ferierra
was first with 55.3.
It was a low-key meet for the
Card men as they competed in
events other than their usual
"favorites." The swimmers, now
in the middle of the hardest part
of the season, were given a rest
by swimming in different, non
specialized events.
Breast-stroker John Mencken
sprinted to a first place in an
event he rarely swims — the
150-yard free — in 21.4 seconds.
Middle distance swimmer Craig
VanZandt swam to first place
finishes in the 500- and 1000-
yard free in 4:43 and 9:50.5 re
spectively. VanZandt, a senior
200-yard freestyler, has barely
competed in the longer dis
tances since his sophomore year.
The men came out strong and
never let up. Santa Clara was
overpowered in all events. The
400 medley relay team of Nack
Connelly, Hencken, Brian Roux,
and Sandy McDonald blasted
the Santa Clara team with a
3:31.7.
Swept three events
The men swept three events:
the 50 and 200-yard free and the
200 fly. Bill Chao took a first in
the 200-free with 1:43.9, with
Jon Powell at 1:46.1 and Kevin
Reel in 1:46.3 for second and
third. In the 50 free Bruce Cood
