# Pac-8 roundup
## Dogs, Bruins win 
### JEFF PARIETTI 
The Pacific Eight basketball
season reaches the halfway point
this week. Washington and
UCLA, with wins over rivals
Washington State and USC re
spectively, moved into a first
place tie with Oregon State this
weekend. The Huskies and
Bruins meet in a showdown
game in Seattle Thursday night.
The sixth-ranked Huskie
squad overcame the Cougars,
75-65, in a regionally televised
game Saturday afternoon.
Washington center James Ed
wards led the Huskies with 19
points. Playing on an injured
leg, Cougar center Steve
Puidokas led all scorers with 20
points.
Ron Davis, Washington State's
leading scorer, was held to just
three points.
Halftime lead
The Huskies led 49-42 at
halftime, blitzed to a 17-point
lead early in the second half, and
then substituted freely the rest of
the way.

UCLA stretched its string of
Pauley Pavilion wins to 95, as it
held off USC, 68-62, Saturday
night. The Bruins led by just
two, at 62-60 with 1:20 left in the
contest, but salted away the win
as the Trojans' Greg White
missed a shot and the Bruins'
Marques Johnson grabbed the
rebound.

Oregon upset Oregon State for
the second time in one week,
edging the 16th-ranked Beavers,
76-74 in overtime last Thursday
night. But the win doesn't really
mean much in the league stand
ings. The two Oregon schools
always play three games to de
termine the winner of their 'Civil
War.' The Ducks may have won
the war, but they aren't going to
win the Pac-8 title.

The Beavers jumped off to an
early 11-1 lead, before the Ducks'
Ron Lee warmed up and took his
team to a 41-35 halftime lead.
Oregon maintained its six-point
margin until Oregon State ral
lied on two free throws and two
layups after a pair of steals, to
send the game into overtime.
The Ducks' Stu Jackson con
nected on two free throws with
59 seconds left in the extra
period to clinch the Oregon up
set.
Lee paced the Ducks with 28
points, while Lonnie Shelton
pumped in 20 for the Beavers.
