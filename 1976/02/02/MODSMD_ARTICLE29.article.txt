Doctors blast Brown
LOS ANGELES — Gov. Edmund Brown's plan for mal
practice insurance reform was discussed and criticized by
physicians meeting throughout the state yesterday, a doc
tors' spokesman here said.
Dr. Walter Dishell of the United Physicians of California
said the group would compile the results of the meetings
and might issue a formal statement today.
But he said a straw vote taken at a meeting of 600 San
Fernando Valley physicians in nearby Studio City proba
bly was representative of doctor sentiment statewide.
"About 99 percent said they definitely would not go
back to work under these circumstances," Dishell said.
The spokesman said doctors objected to Brown's plan
on the grounds that the average $4000 annual premium for
the first year would be increased each year for nine years
by 15 percent plus the increase in the consumer price
index for medical services — a total of up to 30 percent a
year.
Hearst case continues
SAN FRANCISCO — Jury selection in Patricia Hearst's
bank robbery trial resumes in federal court today, and her
lawyer predicts that a panel will be sworn in by mid-week.
Less than half the pool of 36 prospective jurors has been
chosen as the trial enters its second week, but attorney F.
Lee Bailey told reporters that "the process of jury selection
is more encouraging than discouraging,"to Hearst.
Jury selection, which attorneys originally predicted
would take two days, began last Tuesday.
On Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Oliver Carter
granted a defense request by moving the process behind
doors closed to the news media and the public.
CIA funds in Angola?
LONDON — A British diplomatic correspondent re
ported yesterday that more than $20 million, mainly from
the CIA. is to be spent on mercenaries in Angola.
The Kremlin, meanwhile, launched a rare personal at
tack on Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, accusing him
of falsifying Moscow's position in the embattled south
west African nation.
Norman Kirkham, diplomatic correspondent of the
Sunday Telegraph, quoted diplomatic sources in Zaire as
saying that $200,000 of American money given to the
Western-backed National Front (FNLA) in Angola has al
ready been sent to London to recruit mercenaries.
Kirkham also said at least 300 Britons were joining
Western-backed forces in Angola.
He added that the CIA had allocated about $49.2 million
in arms, other supplies and cash so far to the FNLA and
other forces,and that more authorized money was still in
the pipeline.
Ford to swear in officials
WASHINGTON — President Ford launches a busy week

today, including pressuring Congress to end natural gas
regulation, completing intelligence reform proposals and
campaigning in New Hampshire.
He also will swear in two new members of his official
family — Elliot L. Richardson as commerce secretary to
day, and later in the week, Rogers Morton as presidential
counselor and political adviser.
Press Secretary Ron Nessen said there also was a possi
bility Ford would hold a news conference later in the
week.
But the President was focusing major attention for the
moment on tomorrow's vote in the House over the 25-
year-old fight to end regulation of natural gas prices.
Ford says that federal price regulations on natural gas,
in effect since 1938, are outmoded and are creating shor
tages by inhibiting production.
Dissenters arrested in India
MADRAS, India — The Indian government yesterday
arrested hundreds of members of a regional political party
opposed to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi following fed
eral takeover of the Tamil Nadu state.
The arrests were part of tough and apparently effective
security measures clamped on the state following the
central government's decision Saturday to dissolve the
Tamil Nadu legislature and bring the state administration
under what is known as "president's federal rule."
The outgoing government, controlled by the Dravida
Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) party, turned over the state
machinery without incident to representatives of the cent
ral government and urged its followers to remain nonvio
lent.
There were no reports of fighting.
Reliable sources said some 100 DMK members were
arrested in this state capital and another 600 members of
DMK and other opposition parties were seized in the rest
of Tamil Nadu.
Miranda's suspect slayer held
PHOENIX, Ariz. —Police used a "Miranda card" to read
a Mexican immigrant his rights before arresting him in
connection with the barroom slaying of Ernesto Miranda
— the man whose name was given to a landmark Supreme
Court decision on defendants' rights.
Police said an officer read the rights to Fernando Rod
riguez Zamora, 23, in both English and Spanish and then
took him in custody on an open murder charge for the
stabbing death of Miranda Saturday.
They said yesterday they were looking for a second man
in the stabbing, the man who actually wielded the knife.
Miranda was slain during anargument overa card game
in a skid row bar. Police said an illegal Mexican alien,
about 25 years old, was believed to have been the assailant
and that Zamora was believed to have handed him the
knife.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with variable high cloudiness.
Continued mild temperatures. Lows in upper 30s to mid
40s. Highs today and tomorrow in upper 60s and 70s.
Light winds.

ported yesterday that more than $20 million, mainly from
the CIA. is to be spent on mercenaries in Angola.
The Kremlin, meanwhile, launched a rare personal at
tack on Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, accusing him
of falsifying Moscow's position in the embattled south
west African nation.
Norman Kirkham, diplomatic correspondent of the
Sunday Telegraph, quoted diplomatic sources in Zaire as
saying that $200,000 of American money given to the
Western-backed National Front (FNLA) in Angola has al
ready been sent to London to recruit mercenaries.
Kirkham also said at least 300 Britons were joining
Western-backed forces in Angola.
He added that the CIA had allocated about $49.2 million
in arms, other supplies and cash so far to the FNLA and
other forces,and that more authorized money was still in
the pipeline.
Ford to swear in officials
WASHINGTON — President Ford launches a busy week

today, including pressuring Congress to end natural gas
regulation, completing intelligence reform proposals and
campaigning in New Hampshire.
He also will swear in two new members of his official
family — Elliot L. Richardson as commerce secretary to
day, and later in the week, Rogers Morton as presidential
counselor and political adviser.
Press Secretary Ron Nessen said there also was a possi
bility Ford would hold a news conference later in the
week.
But the President was focusing major attention for the
moment on tomorrow's vote in the House over the 25-
year-old fight to end regulation of natural gas prices.
Ford says that federal price regulations on natural gas,
in effect since 1938, are outmoded and are creating shor
tages by inhibiting production.
Dissenters arrested in India
MADRAS, India — The Indian government yesterday
arrested hundreds of members of a regional political party
opposed to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi following fed
eral takeover of the Tamil Nadu state.
The arrests were part of tough and apparently effective
security measures clamped on the state following the
central government's decision Saturday to dissolve the
Tamil Nadu legislature and bring the state administration
under what is known as "president's federal rule."
The outgoing government, controlled by the Dravida
Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) party, turned over the state
machinery without incident to representatives of the cent
ral government and urged its followers to remain nonvio
lent.
There were no reports of fighting.
Reliable sources said some 100 DMK members were
arrested in this state capital and another 600 members of
DMK and other opposition parties were seized in the rest
of Tamil Nadu.
Miranda's suspect slayer held
PHOENIX, Ariz. —Police used a "Miranda card" to read
a Mexican immigrant his rights before arresting him in
connection with the barroom slaying of Ernesto Miranda
— the man whose name was given to a landmark Supreme
Court decision on defendants' rights.
Police said an officer read the rights to Fernando Rod
riguez Zamora, 23, in both English and Spanish and then
took him in custody on an open murder charge for the
stabbing death of Miranda Saturday.
They said yesterday they were looking for a second man
in the stabbing, the man who actually wielded the knife.
Miranda was slain during anargument overa card game
in a skid row bar. Police said an illegal Mexican alien,
about 25 years old, was believed to have been the assailant
and that Zamora was believed to have handed him the
knife.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with variable high cloudiness.
Continued mild temperatures. Lows in upper 30s to mid
40s. Highs today and tomorrow in upper 60s and 70s.
Light winds.
Doctors blast Brown
LOS ANGELES — Gov. Edmund Brown's plan for mal
practice insurance reform was discussed and criticized by
physicians meeting throughout the state yesterday, a doc
tors' spokesman here said.
Dr. Walter Dishell of the United Physicians of California
said the group would compile the results of the meetings
and might issue a formal statement today.
But he said a straw vote taken at a meeting of 600 San
Fernando Valley physicians in nearby Studio City proba
bly was representative of doctor sentiment statewide.
"About 99 percent said they definitely would not go
back to work under these circumstances," Dishell said.
The spokesman said doctors objected to Brown's plan
on the grounds that the average $4000 annual premium for
the first year would be increased each year for nine years
by 15 percent plus the increase in the consumer price
index for medical services — a total of up to 30 percent a
year.
Hearst case continues
SAN FRANCISCO — Jury selection in Patricia Hearst's
bank robbery trial resumes in federal court today, and her
lawyer predicts that a panel will be sworn in by mid-week.
Less than half the pool of 36 prospective jurors has been
chosen as the trial enters its second week, but attorney F.
Lee Bailey told reporters that "the process of jury selection
is more encouraging than discouraging,"to Hearst.
Jury selection, which attorneys originally predicted
would take two days, began last Tuesday.
On Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Oliver Carter
granted a defense request by moving the process behind
doors closed to the news media and the public.

Dissenters arrested in India
MADRAS, India — The Indian government yesterday
arrested hundreds of members of a regional political party
opposed to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi following fed
eral takeover of the Tamil Nadu state.
The arrests were part of tough and apparently effective
security measures clamped on the state following the
central government's decision Saturday to dissolve the
Tamil Nadu legislature and bring the state administration
under what is known as "president's federal rule."
The outgoing government, controlled by the Dravida
Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) party, turned over the state
machinery without incident to representatives of the cent
ral government and urged its followers to remain nonvio
lent.
There were no reports of fighting.
Reliable sources said some 100 DMK members were
arrested in this state capital and another 600 members of
DMK and other opposition parties were seized in the rest
of Tamil Nadu.
Miranda's suspect slayer held
PHOENIX, Ariz. —Police used a "Miranda card" to read
a Mexican immigrant his rights before arresting him in
connection with the barroom slaying of Ernesto Miranda
— the man whose name was given to a landmark Supreme
Court decision on defendants' rights.
Police said an officer read the rights to Fernando Rod
riguez Zamora, 23, in both English and Spanish and then
took him in custody on an open murder charge for the
stabbing death of Miranda Saturday.
They said yesterday they were looking for a second man
in the stabbing, the man who actually wielded the knife.
Miranda was slain during anargument overa card game
in a skid row bar. Police said an illegal Mexican alien,
about 25 years old, was believed to have been the assailant
and that Zamora was believed to have handed him the
knife.

Doctors blast Brown
LOS ANGELES — Gov. Edmund Brown's plan for mal
practice insurance reform was discussed and criticized by
physicians meeting throughout the state yesterday, a doc
tors' spokesman here said.
Dr. Walter Dishell of the United Physicians of California
said the group would compile the results of the meetings
and might issue a formal statement today.
But he said a straw vote taken at a meeting of 600 San
Fernando Valley physicians in nearby Studio City proba
bly was representative of doctor sentiment statewide.
"About 99 percent said they definitely would not go
back to work under these circumstances," Dishell said.
The spokesman said doctors objected to Brown's plan
on the grounds that the average $4000 annual premium for
the first year would be increased each year for nine years
by 15 percent plus the increase in the consumer price
index for medical services — a total of up to 30 percent a
year.
Hearst case continues
SAN FRANCISCO — Jury selection in Patricia Hearst's
bank robbery trial resumes in federal court today, and her
lawyer predicts that a panel will be sworn in by mid-week.
Less than half the pool of 36 prospective jurors has been
chosen as the trial enters its second week, but attorney F.
Lee Bailey told reporters that "the process of jury selection
is more encouraging than discouraging,"to Hearst.
Jury selection, which attorneys originally predicted
would take two days, began last Tuesday.
On Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Oliver Carter
granted a defense request by moving the process behind
doors closed to the news media and the public.
CIA funds in Angola?
LONDON — A British diplomatic correspondent re
ported yesterday that more than $20 million, mainly from
the CIA. is to be spent on mercenaries in Angola.
The Kremlin, meanwhile, launched a rare personal at
tack on Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, accusing him
of falsifying Moscow's position in the embattled south
west African nation.
Norman Kirkham, diplomatic correspondent of the
Sunday Telegraph, quoted diplomatic sources in Zaire as
saying that $200,000 of American money given to the
Western-backed National Front (FNLA) in Angola has al
ready been sent to London to recruit mercenaries.
Kirkham also said at least 300 Britons were joining
Western-backed forces in Angola.
He added that the CIA had allocated about $49.2 million
in arms, other supplies and cash so far to the FNLA and
other forces,and that more authorized money was still in
the pipeline.

regulation, completing intelligence reform proposals and
campaigning in New Hampshire.

moment on tomorrow's vote in the House over the 25-

in effect since 1938, are outmoded and are creating shor
