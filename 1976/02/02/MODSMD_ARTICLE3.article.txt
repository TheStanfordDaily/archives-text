# Protesters oppose submarines, missiles
## Continental Walk arrives 
### WAYNE SACHS 
About 100 persons will ar
rive at the First United Methodist
Church in Palo Alto at 5 a.m. today as
part of the Continental Walk for Dis
armament and Social Justice.
Thi walkers, including about 150
Stanford community members, will
march south from the church at 7:30
a.m. tomorrow for a demonstration at
the Lockheed Missiles and Space Re
search Laboratory in Stanford Indust
rial Park.
The Continental Walk is a nonvio
lent appeal for reduced military
spending and conversion of defense
industries into producers of "urgent
human necessities," according to walk
leaflets.
Though many of the walkers were
among the 1000 who began their trek
in San Francisco Jan. 31 and will go the
entire 3600-mile route to the Pentagon
by October, the bulk of the participants
will be part of relay of walks from one
community, such as Palo Alto, to the
next.
Local greeting
As the walkers enter each commun
ity they will be greeted by local resi
dents and organizations who will pro
vide them with food and lodging for
the night. Walkers will eat dinner in
several University and Palo Alto resi
dences tonight.
Organizers suggested that the Con
tinental Walk is particularly relevant to
Santa Clara County and Stanford.
"Santa Clara County has the highest
per capita level of defense spending in
the entire country,"one organizer said
Stanford's presence is the primary
reason defense industries are so highly
concentrated here, explained senior
history major Alan Bernstein, spokes
man for the Mid-Peninsula Conversion

Project (MPCP), a feeder group for the
walk.
"The University has played a major
role in encouraging corporations
long-dependent on defense spending
to settle here. Stanford processes the
scientists and technicians, and the
corporations in the (Stanford) Indust
rial Park hire them," he said.
Se r ious needs
The Palo Alto-based MPCP believes
that people in this area have many
serious needs which are unfulfilled,
Beinstein said. Among those needs are
improved mass transportation, more
low-cost housing and community
health clinics, he said.
Bernstein explained the Conversion
Project is leafletting at Lockheed Re
search Labs to emphasize the need for
a shift in research priorities away from
military systems toward social ser
vices.
Pacific Life Community (PLC) will
cosponsor the Lockheed demonstra
tion. PLC is a nonviolent group of
Pacific Coast Canadians and Ameri
cans opposed to the production of the
Trident submarine weapons system.
According to PLC member Bob Al
dridge, the Lockheed plant will pro
duce the Trident missile, which is
armed with multiple, independently
targetable nuclear warheads. The first
80 missiles, if approved, would cost
over $1 billion.
Parade
PLC will parade their "Trident
Monster." a 600-foot-long bamboo and
rope model of the Trident submarine,
in front of Lockheed in Sunnyvale as
part of the walk. The model will in
clude 408 separate black flags to sym
bolize the number of cities one sub
marine could destroy.

The model will also accompany the
walk through San Jose on Wednesday.
Between now and October the walk
and its feeder routes will go through
some 42 states. Regional and local
groups have arranged to cosponsor
programs and demonstrations with
walk organizers all along the route.
