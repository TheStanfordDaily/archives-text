# Sociology professor refused tenure here
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Asst. Sociology Prof. Anne McMa
hon, winner of the 1974 Gores Award
for Excellence in Teaching, was de
nied tenure last month by her depart
ment after it concluded that she had
not published enough research mate
rial.
McMahon became the second Gores
Award winner in a year to be denied
tenure. Last winter, former Asst. Re
ligious Studies Prof. Jerry Irish, win
ner of the 1972 award, was denied te
nure.
Although many sociology profes
sors and students contend that McMa
hon deserved to receive tenure,
McMahon told the Daily last week that
she definitely does not plan to appeal
her case as Irish unsuccessfully did.
"I never expected to receive tenure,"
McMahon said. "My research strategy
does not result in quick publications. It
would not make me immediately visi
ble in the profession, and visibility is
very important in academia."
Few articles
McMahon, researching voluntary
participation in organizations, has

published only two scholarly articles
during her S J /2 years here.
McMahon said that under the rules
for tenure set by the University, she
clearly did not merit tenure.
"I don't think that the rules were
misapplied," McMahon said. "They
are not the rules that I would choose,
but whether or not it is a mistake for
the University to have such rules de
pends upon what the University is try
ing to do."
'Teaching not rewarded'
McMahon contended that "invest
ment in the teaching role at this Uni
versity is not rewarded, but it does not
follow that undergraduate education
is hurt as a result."
Good researchers are often good
teachers, she acknowledged.
McMahon also asserted that the
University's policies on teaching vis a
vis research do not differ at all from
those of other major universities.
She said she is "not unhappy about
(her) state of affairs.
"Stanford was the one high-caliber
place where I could teach a reasonable
load and do my particular research
with the department's support,"
McMahon said. "I considered it a great
six-year job,but I always knew that job
security was not one of the things that
came with it."
Winning the Gores Award did not
lead to any "false" confidence about
receiving tenure, she said.
No readjustment
McMahon added that she never
seriously considered readjusting her
research schedule so that she could re
ceive tenure by publishing more.

"Tenure was never an important
motivation for me," she explained.
But Larry Diamond, a graduate stu
dent in sociology, was not so sanguine
about McMahon's firing.
"There is a pattern in this University
of denying tenure to the best teachers,
and the students are getting shafted."
Diamond said.
"If Anne were merely a good
teacher, her dismissal would not be an
issue. But she is a very rare teacher —
one of the best — and some allowance
should have made for that," he said.
Diamond commended McMahon for
not readjusting her research schedule
in order to get tenure.
'On the make 1
"A lot of assistant professors are on
the make and will reel off article after
article of dubious quality in order to
inflate the number of articles they can
claim to have published," Diamond
said. "If McMahon had wanted to do
quick and dirty stuff, she could have
done it. A professor has to have a spe
cial courage to study material that
won't immediately yield a large
amount of publication."
Dudley Kirk, Sociology Department
chairman, said he was "personally re
gretful" about the decision to deny
McMahon tenure.
"It was a difficult decision," Kirk
said. "Everyone in the department had
mixed feelings."
But he said her lack of publication
overbalanced her teaching record.
Senate regulations
"We feel constrained to abide by the
(Faculty Senate) regulations that say
we should compare a tenure candidate
with the two or three best such junior
persons in the nation in the candi
date's field," Kirk said. "Teaching is
terribly important,but we have strict
rules about the need for research."
Kirk refused to comment on whether
or not he believed that teaching is

sometimes overemphasized in tenure
decisions.
Divided vote
But Kirk revealed that the depart
ment's vote to deny tenure to McMa
hon was not unanimous.
Irish, in contrast, was unanimously
recommended for tenure by his de
partment and later was denied tenure
by the Appointments and Promotions
Committee.
Diamond said he is certain that if
McMahon had been approved for te
nure by her department, the committee
would have denied her tenure because
of its emphasis on published research
as a criterion for promotion.
Joane Nagel, a graduate student who
has worked closely with McMahon,
agreed with Diamond that McMahon

deserved tenure.
"She has a special way of dealing
with problems and issues," Nagel said.
"No one could ever replace her."
Kirk and Diamond said they were
disturbed because the Sociology De
partment does not have any fulltime,
tenured female professors.
Although McMahon contended that
"women are seriously underrepre
sented in tenured positions," she said
she did not want to receive tenure
simply because she is female.
"I want to be a sociologist, not a
token female," McMahon said.
McMahon blamed women's failure
to obtain many tenured positions on
"the sexist social structure," and said
that women have a harder time work
ing as professors than do men.
