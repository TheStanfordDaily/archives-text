# 'Death' hoax fools student residents
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Residents of Storey House would
have done anything to help Jeff Harker,
who had just been notified of his step
mother's death.
Or so they thought.
Harker was one of many aliases used
during the past two weeks hy a young
man who has obtained transportation,
meals and sympathy from students by
convincing them that someone in his
family has died, police said.
He attempted to stage the ruse at
least seven times Thursday night,
leading police on a campus-wide
chase and avoiding capture by slip
ping through a fraternity's bathroom
window to tell the story at still another
residence.
The first hoax began at about 4:30
p.m. Jan. 19 when someone called the
Storey House phone and said, "My
roommate's stepmother has been criti
cally hurt in a car accident." Nancy
VValtman, who answered the phone,
said the caller described Harker and
requested that some women from the
house look for him in Tresidder Union.
Waltman and a friend found Harker
and gave him the message. He asked
for a ride to the Stanford hospital,
Waltman said.
When Harker heard Dr. William Bol
lengier being paged, he said, "That's
my family doctor." Then he pretended

to visit someone in the emergency
room.
"He acted as if he had seen his
mother, and she hadn't recognized
him," Waltman said. "He appeared to
be in total shock. It was a very realistic
performance and we believed it."
They drove Harker to Storey House.
He stayed for eight hours, playing the
guitar and "telling all kinds of amaz
ing stories," Waltman said. "He had
our defenses down. We didn't ques
tion a word of it."
Later after pretending to call the
hospital, he announced, "Yes, she's
dead." He asked for a ride to San Jose.
"He seemed attracted to my room
mate, Vicki Hahn," Waltman said. "So
I encouraged her to drive him." Two
other women agreed to ride along. "Af
ter they left, I realized that they might
be driving with a weirdo." YValtman
said. She called the police.
She also called the hospital and was
told that no one named Harker had
been admitted and that no one had
died in the emergency room that day.
When Hahn and the others returned,
they said that they had not been
harmed or threatened in any way.
Storey residents called police again
when Harker returned to the house for
lunch the following day. He was held
for questioning and released.

But Stanford hadn't seen the last of
him.
Randy Stokes said Kappa Sigma re
ceived a phone call last Thursday af
ternoon from someone who said he
was from the fraternity's San Diego
chapter. The caller said that his
mother had died and asked the house
president's help in locating his
hounger brother, Stokes said.
House President Glenn Rodriguez
followed the caller's instructions and
found "Stan Haldeman" at the South
ern Pacific station. "He seemed to be
very bitter toward Storey House, and
he was interested in finding out where J
the other all-women's houses were,"
Stokes said. "Haldeman" ate dinner at
the house and then disappeared.
Because of the young man's peculiar
interest in women's houses and his
apparent bitterness toward Storey,
Kappa Sigma members called police
and began warning other residences.
"We were afraid he'd attack some girl
coming back from the library," Stokes
said.
"He was aware that he was being
chased," said Sgt. Tom Berubee of the
Stanford Department of Public Safety.
"He started leapfrogging all over cam
pus." The suspect moved from one re
sidence to another, each time making a
phone call to set up his story and in
venting a new alias.
Danny Schley, who answered the

call to the DU house, agreed to meet
"Stephen Bates" at Durand House.
Sgt. Berubee said that the suspect
probably is not dangerous. "If we catch
him on campus we'll book him for
trespass, disturbing the peace or
something," he said. "He's just a fruit
cake preying on the sympathy of the
academic community."
Students said the man was 18 or 19,
about 5-foot-8, 155 pounds, with red
dish brown hair, pale skin, a pock
marked complexion and a crooked
nose.
