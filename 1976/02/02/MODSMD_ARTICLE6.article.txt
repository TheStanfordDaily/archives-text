# Old rocks learn new tricks
## Pet Rock craze gathers no moss 
### DAVE ANSLEY 
Once upon a time there were hula
hoops. And yo-yos. Silly putty used
to be big. Beany copters have come
and gone (but left their mark in ceil
ings everywhere). Every Christmas
season has seen its fads (remember
Vac-U-Form, Creepy Crawlers and
Incredible Edibles?). The 1975 sea
son was no different.
For the paltry sum of $3.98, you
can be the prou d owner of you r very
own loyal and friendly Pet Rock.
They are quiet, well-behaved and
easy to feed. Apparently, the
American public likes the idea of
having them around the house: it
bought a million of them in three
months. It also made Cary Dahl,
who invented the Pet Rock, a very
rich man.
Dahl, a 38-vear-old advertising
copy writer from Los Gatos, was
once sitting in a cocktail lounge
discussing pets. He commented. "I
don't have any problems with ani
mals. I have a pet rock." and the
conversation mushroomed into a
series of one-liners about pet rocks.

When Dahl got home, he sat
down and wrote all the jokes into a
spoof on dog-training manuals.
And that's how it hegan.
It's appropriate that the training
manual came first, because it's the
biggest selling point of the gift. The
rock, a small wad of excelsion and a
box with airholes comprise the rest
of the kit.
Obedience commands
The manual covers such basic
obedience commands as sit. stay,
heel and come. The manual says,
"Bending over from the waist, face
your rock, clap your hands and let
your face light up as vou say, COME
BRUTUS. C'MON FELLA, HERE
BOY and stuff like that.
"Now, start walking slowly to
ward your rock. Incredibly, as you
walk toward your rock, you will
notice that it actually is coming
closer. This means your Pet Rock is
learning the command, COME.
Praise your rock and give it a pat of
approval."

ON THE ROCKS—Cary I)ahl. the inventor of the Pet Rock, is raking in the
dough, he said recently. He suggested he makes more than a buck per rock.
The question is: Do those buyers have rocks in their head, or are Pet Rocks
really worth it?
Once the rock has mastered
the basic skills, its owner can
teach it such special skills as rol
ling over.
"... The best place to teach
your Pet Rock to ROLL OVER is
on the side of a hill."
Another section of the book
counsels owners in treatment of
such common maladies as "A
chip off the old rock."
Kosarita Beach
Ironically, the rocks comprise
the least expensive part of the
package. They are from Rosarita
Beach in Mexico, according to
Dahl. He said that he checked
rock samples at a rock dis
tributor in San Jose, and found

that the Rosarita Rocks offered
high uniformity.
Fifteen prototype rocks were
entered in gift shows in early
August and were well received.
Two weeks later, Dahl quit his
job to get into rocks fulltime. The
first were shipped Oct. 3, and he
said he "expected that maybe
100,000 would be sold. No one
was more surprised than I was,"
he said.
The only way to describe the
Pet Rock phenomenon is with
superlatives. For three months
they were being purchased at the
rate of one every 7.5 seconds,
one-fourth of them being sold in
California alone.

at one time had nine employes
working full time just typing or
ders. They didn't even have time
to set up their own office — they
worked out of Dahl's old ad
agency.
A permanent staff of 12 now
handles the business, which has
sold 60,000 more rocks since
Christmas.
Dahl made an extraordinary
profit from each rock: half of the
wholesale price. How rich is he
now? "You can say 1 made a lot
of money — a dollar off each
one," he said.
One reason for his good for
tune: "We got millions of dollars
worth of advertising for free.
There are 1800 daily newspapers
in the country, and 1400 covered
Pet Rocks. We spent not one nic
kel in advertising, and we don't
intend to."
Rock interview
This reporter spoke last week
with a Pet Rock living at Stan
ford. Its owner, Patrick Cannon,
served as interpreter for the in
terview.
Cannon, a senior majoring in
psychology, is uncertain what
Roady Rock's sex is.
"Since my rock hasn't got any
sex organs, I really haven't fi
gured out what it is. 1 feel sorry
for it. But it wouldn't even tell
me," he said. "Roadv doesn't tell

me very much really. I'm afraid
my rock's sort of a crashing bore.
It never initiates conversations.
Doesn't answer questions,
either."
Cannon says he has taught
Roady every trick in the book,
"except how to stand."
It also likes to watch the
Flintstones on TV, he noted.
Pedigreed?
Cannon claimed his pet is
pedigreed. "It's descended from
the fourth tablet on the left at
Stonehenge. One of his grand
fathers is part of the Creat Wall,
and a second cousin is in Lin
coln's nose at Mount Rushmore.
It's quite a prestigious family
line."
Does Roady Rock miss its fam
ily? "No, it's become a little bol
der since it left home."
Critics of the Pet Rock craze
argue that it is just another
example of "There's a sucker
born every minute," but Dahl
disagreed.
"It's just a packaged sense of
humor," he said. "A laugh and a
giggle for $4 is very inexpensive.
People were ready for it — they
were tired of potholders shaped
like turtles."
Rock Bottom Productions is
planning for the future. Dahl has
just finalized deals in Australia
and England, and his company
is developing T-shirts,
jigsaw puzzles and Pet
Rock jewelry. The T-shirts will
feature a Pet Rock Hall of Fame,
with characters like "RockCous
teau" and "Goldy Rocks."
But the company is in no rush
to diversify. It doesn't want to
have two competing products on
the market at once, so it plans to
let Pet Rocks run their course
first.
Some skeptics may wonder
why they can't make a pet out of
any one of the free rocks lying
around campus. The training
manual answers this quite suc
cinctly. "There's an old saying
in rock circles,' Once a wild rock,
always a wild rock.'A genuine,
pedigreed Pet Rock will make a
much more suitable compan
ion."
