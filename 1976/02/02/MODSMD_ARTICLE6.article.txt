# Old rocks learn new tricks
## Pet Rock craze gathers no moss 
### DAVE ANSLEY 
Once upon a time there were hula
hoops. And yo-yos. Silly putty used
to be big. Beany copters have come
and gone (but left their mark in ceil
ings everywhere). Every Christmas
season has seen its fads (remember
Vac-U-Form, Creepy Crawlers and
Incredible Edibles?). The 1975 sea
son was no different.
For the paltry sum of $3.98, you
can be the prou d owner of you r very
own loyal and friendly Pet Rock.
They are quiet, well-behaved and
easy to feed. Apparently, the
American public likes the idea of
having them around the house: it
bought a million of them in three
months. It also made Cary Dahl,
who invented the Pet Rock, a very
rich man.
Dahl, a 38-vear-old advertising
copy writer from Los Gatos, was
once sitting in a cocktail lounge
discussing pets. He commented. "I
don't have any problems with ani
mals. I have a pet rock." and the
conversation mushroomed into a
series of one-liners about pet rocks.

When Dahl got home, he sat
down and wrote all the jokes into a
spoof on dog-training manuals.
And that's how it hegan.
It's appropriate that the training
manual came first, because it's the
biggest selling point of the gift. The
rock, a small wad of excelsion and a
box with airholes comprise the rest
of the kit.
Obedience commands
The manual covers such basic
obedience commands as sit. stay,
heel and come. The manual says,
"Bending over from the waist, face
your rock, clap your hands and let
your face light up as vou say, COME
BRUTUS. C'MON FELLA, HERE
BOY and stuff like that.
"Now, start walking slowly to
ward your rock. Incredibly, as you
walk toward your rock, you will
notice that it actually is coming
closer. This means your Pet Rock is
learning the command, COME.
Praise your rock and give it a pat of
approval."

ON THE ROCKS—Cary I)ahl. the inventor of the Pet Rock, is raking in the
dough, he said recently. He suggested he makes more than a buck per rock.
The question is: Do those buyers have rocks in their head, or are Pet Rocks
really worth it?
