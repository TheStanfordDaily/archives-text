# From the editor
## Direction 
### 
I suspect that much of the commotion surrounding the
change of the volume here at the Daily goes unnoticed
among the majority of people who pick up the paper every
morning.
To a large extent, the volume switch is an internal reor
ganization preceded by a semi-coronation and a massive
game of editorial musical chairs.
Since Friday, for example, the Daily not only has a new
editor, but also a new managing editor, a new Thursday
editor, two new news editors, a new features editor, a new
opinions editor, a new entertainment editor and two new
copy editors.
It's a transfusion for us at the Daily. New blood at the top
often brings a fresh outlook and new ideas to the paper. More
than ever now, I feel the Daily should have a new direction.
We must realize that change comes slowly to any organi
zation, especially to one as complex as the Daily. The prop
osal that led to Thursday was discussed among Daily editors
for years before the Jan. 15, 1976 inaugural issue.
But Thursday illustrates the point that the Daily is capable
of change and willing to experiment. Thursday also de
monstrates that we need reader comment and criticism to
help us put out a product that will serve the needs of the
community.
As editor, I plan to take an active role in soliciting opin
ions from our readers. Associate Editor Bruce Kadden and I
have already begun to coordinate a readership survey for
spring quarter â€” a chance for the Daily to examine the
community's satisfaction with our product.
This paper exists to serve its readers, and I take reader
criticism seriously. As editor I will not shuffle critical com
ments or suggestions aside, even if I happen to disagree with
the criticism.
Along with the policy of opening the Daily to suggestion, I
plan to push for broad-based news coverage. Too often in the
past, the Daily has focused on minute administrative
changes in the University while ignoring the larger implica
tions.
We overcover some stories and drastically underplay
others. Our coverage of minority, graduate student and staff
affairs has been spotty and generally unsatisfactory.
In the past, we've waited for news to filter in to us. This
volume I plan to see that we go looking for the story that's off
the beaten track.
Finally, I hope to be able to move the paper in the direction
of increased financial stability. I plan to work closely with
our business manager, Jim Baer, and our advertising man
ager, Jim Myerson, to push the Daily back on the road toward
financial independence.
The changes I hope to make in the Daily during the next
four months will not turn the Daily into a major metropoli
tan newspaper (like the University of Texas student news
paper). We have neither the staff nor the advertising revenue
to publish 40-page papers five days a week.
We may not fully realize the editorial and financial goals
that I have stated in this column.
But we'll try. And for that effort I hope to see many im
provements in the paper and in its ability to satisfy its audi
ence.
I look forward to this volume, and I look forward to hear
ing from you, the Daily's readers, on our progress.
