The recent Regional White
House Conference on Consumer
Representation was an eye
opening example of governmen
tal decision-making. While de
scribing the Conference's task as
"seeking input," the goverment
panel members who came to
Stanford on Jan. 29 clearly had
another purpose in mind.
Virginia Knauer, special assis
tant to the president for con
sumer affairs, arrived with a
neatly (well, perhaps not so
neatly) packaged Administration
plan that would place consumer
representatives in 39 govern
ment agencies or departments. If
anyone thinks this sounds like a
good idea, then the Administra
tion would like to hear from
himâ€”because no one else seems
to think so.
Consumer organizations
unanimously oppose the plan,
favoring instead creation of a
separate Consumer Protection
Agency (CPA) with indepen
dence, accountability and visi
bility. Yet President Ford prom
ises to veto such a measure.
Although Knauer originally
supported the CPA, she now
claims the administration's
plans (which she largely au
thored) will meet the above three
criteria and also be a fiscal bar
gain since the office of each
agency's consumer "advocate"
will be funded internally.
Two questions
Of course this immediately
raises two important questions:
How can our representatives be
independent when departments
control their allowance,and ac
countability rests ultimately
with the department head?
Second, how much is actu
ally saved under her option?
After repeated questions during
the conference, the panel admit
ted it had no idea how much the
advocates would cost, but as
sured the audience the estimates
would require no additional
funds.
The groups present suspected
the 30 representatives would re-

sult in expensive duplication
and a weak skeleton useful only
in propping up Ford's record on
consumer affairs. And Rep. Paul
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) es
timates $20t0.>4(J million could
be saved annually just by con
solidating existing consumer
services.
Consumer groups want one
agency with one readily
identifiable head and accounta
ble only to the public. The pros
pects that such an agency could
operate successfully in our pre
sent economic and political
structure are admittedly slim;
however, it is possible a CPA
could develop the clout the
legal aid division of the Office
of Economic Opportunity had in
the '60s.
Visibility crucial
Finally, the above problems
make visibility crucial. A con
sumer representative buried
within a depa-tment is sheltered
from any obligation to act. In
deed, the representative can be
come (if he or she isn't origi
nally) so identified with de
partment goals and values as to
be worthless.
One woman at the conference
who had served in such a capac
ity with the Federal Energy Ad
ministration said this is exactly
what happened, calling the
whole process a charade.
When I asked Knauer if the
administration would go ahead
with efforts to "aid" consumers
despite anything consumer
groups or Congress did, she of
fered a tired "silent majority"
argument! "Consumer groups
don't represent everybody," she
said. "All they (opponents) have
to do is find enough votes."
The nine regional conferences
held to sell the plan have cost
taxpayers over a quarter-of-a
million dollars. If Ford's
philosophy of self-regulation is
legitimized by this plan's
enactment, we'll pay via in
creased corporate and govern
ment insensitivity as well.
