# Investment push asked for ASSU
## 
### LORI MATSUKAWA 
Big ASSII investing, with the possi
ble help of a professional investing
firm, may be necessary according to
ASSU Financial Manager Chris Cline.
"We need the profits for our pro
jected deficits next year," explained
Cline in an interview last Friday.
"The Dean of Student Affairs (James
Lyons) will be cutting our budget by
about $42,000 next year. We've got to
make it up somewhere," Cline said.
Investment profits bring in the bulk
of ASSU operating funds. The funds
are used to pay for the overhead of the
ASSU office, accounting services, paid
expertise and banking operations used
by ASSU projects and programs. Cur
rently, ASSU projects use these
facilities and services for free.
Cline expected that the ASSU would
review it's budget to reduce it where
possible, but said that the budget
could probably be reached by only
$4000 to $6000. This year's ASSU
budget is $96,459.
Charge projects
Without the University's funds, said
Cline, "this arm can't stand alone. The
next logical thing we'd have to do is
charge the projects a certain amount
for these services."
Cline said that the refrigerator ren
tal, lecture notes, travel service and
special events departments could not
be expected to make up the difference
in the deficit.
The ASSU has $370,000 currently
invested in A, AA and AAA bonds.
This includes the $240,000 Cline was
first given to invest in June 1975 and
approximately $130,000 worth of
bonds previously invested by former
manager Frank Oliveri that have not
reached maturity.
Investment earnings
ASSU investments "annually earn
about $32,000," said Cline. Since June
1975, Cline said ASSU investments
had made "about $21,000." Profits are
determined by the change in the value
of a portfolio plus interest.
At last week's ASSU Senate meet
ing, Finance Committee Chairman
Kevin McDermott, in an informal re
port to the senate, proposed that ASSU
"funds be turned over to a professional
management firm subject to the
guidelines set forth by an ASSU In
vestment Committee."
The investing committee would be
composed of the financial manager, a
business school professor, the chair
man of the finance committee* a stu
dent member of the Trustee Committee
on Investments and a student-at-large
chosen by the nominations committee,
according to McDermott's proposal.
The proposal was intended to limit
the power of the financial manager in
investment decisions. Cline had
warned at an earlier meeting that in
experienced managers may not always
know which investments are best
while a professional investing firm
would. The senate postponed discus
sion on the proposal until their next
meeting on Feb. 10.
Cline said he is "presently getting
together information" on possible
firms to be presented for the considera
tion ol business school professors and
Rodney Adams, the University's pre
sent portfolio manager.
"1 haven't really selected any firm,
yet," said Cline.
The investment committee would be
responsible for "setting up paramet
ers" which would direct the private
firm's use of the funds.
Portfolio risk
"Each portfolio carries a risk ('beta'),
and that committee would be respon
sible for telling the firm, 'This is the
beta we want,' " added Cline.
Cline said most investing firms
charge a percentage of the value of the
portfolio for their services.
If the investing committee is estab
lished, Cline said he would recom
mend "that they (the committee) con
tinue (investing) conservatively.
"1 would also like to suggest that
they consider investing in common
stocks as well," he said. "At least a
small percentage of our funds should
be invested in them."
Current investment
The ASSU currently has funds in
vested in such large, financially "safe"
companies as International Telephone
and Telegraph, American Express,
Weyerhauserand Citibank Corp.
These were among the many invest
ments termed "safe" by national rating
services.

Safe investment companies are
those which are unlikely to default on
investment payments. The level of in
terest rates, Cline said, is determined
by the national economy.
ASSU Sen. Bruce Reznick, after
hearing the finance committee's prop
osal, warned that an investment firm
would be "one more layer between the
student body and student funds."
"It's making the ASSU sound pro
fessional instead of being run by
amateurs," Reznick said.

services.

Safe investment companies are
those which are unlikely to default on
investment payments. The level of in
terest rates, Cline said, is determined
by the national economy.
ASSU Sen. Bruce Reznick, after
hearing the finance committee's prop
osal, warned that an investment firm
would be "one more layer between the
student body and student funds."
"It's making the ASSU sound pro
fessional instead of being run by
amateurs," Reznick said.
Big ASSII investing, with the possi
ble help of a professional investing
firm, may be necessary according to
ASSU Financial Manager Chris Cline.
"We need the profits for our pro
jected deficits next year," explained
Cline in an interview last Friday.
"The Dean of Student Affairs (James
Lyons) will be cutting our budget by
about $42,000 next year. We've got to
make it up somewhere," Cline said.
Investment profits bring in the bulk
of ASSU operating funds. The funds
are used to pay for the overhead of the
ASSU office, accounting services, paid
expertise and banking operations used
by ASSU projects and programs. Cur
rently, ASSU projects use these
facilities and services for free.
Cline expected that the ASSU would
review it's budget to reduce it where
possible, but said that the budget
could probably be reached by only
$4000 to $6000. This year's ASSU
budget is $96,459.
Charge projects
Without the University's funds, said
Cline, "this arm can't stand alone. The
next logical thing we'd have to do is
charge the projects a certain amount
for these services."
Cline said that the refrigerator ren
tal, lecture notes, travel service and
special events departments could not
be expected to make up the difference
in the deficit.
The ASSU has $370,000 currently
invested in A, AA and AAA bonds.
This includes the $240,000 Cline was
first given to invest in June 1975 and
approximately $130,000 worth of
bonds previously invested by former
manager Frank Oliveri that have not
reached maturity.
Investment earnings
ASSU investments "annually earn
about $32,000," said Cline. Since June
1975, Cline said ASSU investments
had made "about $21,000." Profits are
determined by the change in the value
of a portfolio plus interest.
At last week's ASSU Senate meet
ing, Finance Committee Chairman
Kevin McDermott, in an informal re
port to the senate, proposed that ASSU
"funds be turned over to a professional
management firm subject to the
guidelines set forth by an ASSU In
vestment Committee."
The investing committee would be
composed of the financial manager, a
business school professor, the chair
man of the finance committee* a stu
dent member of the Trustee Committee
on Investments and a student-at-large
chosen by the nominations committee,
according to McDermott's proposal.
The proposal was intended to limit
the power of the financial manager in
investment decisions. Cline had
warned at an earlier meeting that in
experienced managers may not always
know which investments are best
while a professional investing firm
would. The senate postponed discus
sion on the proposal until their next
meeting on Feb. 10.
Cline said he is "presently getting
together information" on possible
firms to be presented for the considera
tion ol business school professors and
Rodney Adams, the University's pre
sent portfolio manager.
"1 haven't really selected any firm,
yet," said Cline.
The investment committee would be
responsible for "setting up paramet
ers" which would direct the private
firm's use of the funds.
Portfolio risk
"Each portfolio carries a risk ('beta'),
and that committee would be respon
sible for telling the firm, 'This is the
beta we want,' " added Cline.
Cline said most investing firms
charge a percentage of the value of the
portfolio for their services.
If the investing committee is estab
lished, Cline said he would recom
mend "that they (the committee) con
tinue (investing) conservatively.
"1 would also like to suggest that
they consider investing in common
stocks as well," he said. "At least a
small percentage of our funds should
be invested in them."
Current investment
The ASSU currently has funds in
vested in such large, financially "safe"
companies as International Telephone
and Telegraph, American Express,
Weyerhauserand Citibank Corp.
These were among the many invest
ments termed "safe" by national rating
services.

tinue (investing) conservatively.
"1 would also like to suggest that
they consider investing in common
stocks as well," he said. "At least a
small percentage of our funds should
be invested in them."
Current investment
The ASSU currently has funds in
vested in such large, financially "safe"
companies as International Telephone
and Telegraph, American Express,
Weyerhauserand Citibank Corp.
These were among the many invest
ments termed "safe" by national rating
services.

Safe investment companies are
those which are unlikely to default on
investment payments. The level of in
terest rates, Cline said, is determined
by the national economy.
ASSU Sen. Bruce Reznick, after
hearing the finance committee's prop
osal, warned that an investment firm
would be "one more layer between the
student body and student funds."
"It's making the ASSU sound pro
fessional instead of being run by
amateurs," Reznick said.
