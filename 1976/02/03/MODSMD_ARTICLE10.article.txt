# Brown's malpractice insurance solution
## 
### 
"Sick??? — call a lawyer!"
This is the slogan with which many
California doctors are emblazoning their
cars in protest of rate hikes for malpractice
insurance of as much as 327 percent. Travel
lers Insurance Companies, southern
California's principal insurer, terminated
coverage Jan. 1 for doctors refusing to pay
its premium increases.
Some doctors' rates have increased from
$6000 to nearly $36,000 per year. And
Travellers has included a provision in its
new contract obligating physicians to pay a
possible 487 percent increase, effective re
troactive to last Jan. 1.
With premiums as high as these, it is no
wonder doctors are refusing to pay. For as
suming costs of maintaining an office are
close to $20,000, a doctor earning $60,000 to
$70,000 now could earn a net income as low
as $10,000 to $15,000 — hardly much of an
incentive for a highly educated, already
fairly affluent individual.
Brown's proposal
Governor Jerry Brown's proposal to solve
the malpractice maze is a good short-run
measure. Brown's plan is to try to persuade
each doctor to contribute $4000 to a state
run fund, which would then pay all mal
practice settlements for these doctors.
It seems clear that, in the short run, the
only solution to soaring malpractice rates is
to have the state intervene. However, there
are three problems with Brown's proposal.
First, in order for the fund to be fiscally
sound and free of state funding, 18,000 of
the approximately 22,000 doctors not co
vered by group plans will have to join the
fund. Whether such a large number will
agree to participate appears doubtful.
Persuading enough physicians to join the
fund is especially uncertain in view of a
clause of the proposal which many physi
cians find anathema. This provision re
quires doctors to volunteer their services,
at below cost or for free, to the poor, elderly
and children of each community.
Provision unfair
Doctors around the state have com
plained such a provision is unfair to them —
and they are right. Why should the state
force doctors to transfer their wealth — as
provided through their skills — to poor
people?
Brown's plan is a perverse system of re

distributing wealth, and lays unfair burden
on doctors. It calls for taking money from
only one select group in the population, and
distributing these dollars to the less advan
taged.
If medical service is to be provided to
indigent patients,to be fair the state should
place the burden on all members of a certain
economic class.
But besides these two problems, Brown's
proposal could only be effective for a short
period. In future years,the plan calls for the

expense of malpractice insurance to rise at
the cost of living plus an extra 15 percent
each year.
Brown's advisers admit that by 1986,
yearly insurance could cost each physician
in this fund $28,000.
Exorbitant charges
How, then, can these exorbitant charges
be eschewed? The answer seems to be
through judicial reform, not through a
change in insurance company policy.
Insurance companies are not to blame for
the malpractice insurance rates. These
companies are merely trying to earn a profit
and charge their customers approximately
what it costs the companies in settlements
each year.
The companies' lack of complicity is
especially evident when one considers
studies which show insurance firms have
undercharged doctors over the last few
years.
Simple economic theory will show the
malpractice insurance business is not very
enticing. Rather than trying to enter the in
dustry, as firms would attempt to do if there
were a profit to be made, insurance com
panies have been desperately trying to
dump their malpractice policies.
New York
Last year in New York, for example, the
primary insurer almost abandoned all its

malpractice policies, until the legislature
could intervene to prevent such action.
Recent reports have shown it is exceed
ingly difficult to turn a profit in malpractice
suits, especially with the size of settlements
skyrocketing in some areas of the country.
Thus, it is the judicial system which must
make amends. And it seems two main re
forms are necessary.
First, doctors' performances defined as
"malpractice" must be carefully reconsi
dered and violations need to be more strin
gently defined.
Patient's indemnity
As representatives of the American Medi
cal Association said last May in the New
York Times, laws covering malpractice
suits have been transformed from emphasis
on a doctoral liability to emphasis on a pa
tient's indemnity.
One has to be careful in drawing the line
between a mistake and the outcome of a
risky operation. In any medical procedure
there is a large element of risk which is
distinct from true incompetence.
One must have compassion for those who
have been butchered by an unfit doctor, but
this empathy should not blind one to the
fact very few unfortunate occurrences
which happen while under medical care are
a physician's fault.
Secondly, the costs a plaintiff must bear
in a malpractice suit should be increased.
As it currently stands, the plaintiff only has
to hire a lawyer to bring a malpractice suit.
Consequently, many patients are very wil
ling to go to court on the off-chance of win
ning a judgment.
Surfeit of lawyers
And considering the surfeit of lawyers in
southern California, many of whom are not
very successful financially, it is not so dif
ficult to find a willing advocate for one's
malpractice claims.
However, if plaintiffs' costs were in
creased,only cases where a plaintiff felt he
had a good chance of winning would be
brought for adjudication.
If a long-range solution is to be found, it
must be explored through the courts. To
implement any other plan is only to forestall
the problem.
