The recent denial of tenure t )
Asst. Sociology Prof. Anne
McMahon fits a pattern which is
bound to have a chilling eflect
on untenured faculty members.
In addition to winning the
Gores Award for outstanding
teaching, McMahon had been
active in a number of other ac
tivities enhancing under
graduate education. She had
served on the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies, the Com
mittee on Individually Designed
Majors and participated in the
Undergraduate Research Oppor
tunity Program.
Last year in a similar case.
Asst. Religious Studies Prof.
Jerry Irish, a truly exceptional
person and a gifted teacher, was
denied tenure after a career
committed to the needs of un
dergraduates.
These cases provide junior fa
culty members with a clear sig
nal about how to expand their
time and energy.
Lip service
While the administration
gives lip service to the value of
teaching and service to the
community, the evidence por
trays a very different reality. At
Stanford, junior faculty who
spend time with undergraduates
place their academic careers in
jeopardy.
The impact is more than the
loss of a few outstanding people.
Many assistant professors can
not afford the time to really be
come involved with students.
Also, many are discouraged by
older colleagues from participat
ing in service activities such as
resident fellow positions,
freshman advising and commit
tee work; they cannot become
fully participating members in
the life of the University as if af
fects undergraduates.
Stanford is a university and
not a liberal arts college. But
students at a university have a
right to expect a quality educa
tion that includes numerous
opportunities for engagement
with faculty members.
Mediocre education
The current faculty reward
system discourages engagement
of this sort and is a major con
tributor to the mediocre educa
tion many students receive.
There is an obvious need for
more balance between research,
graduate training and under
graduate education at Stanford.
The quest for institutional fame
and fortune has greatly skewed
the existing value structure and
undergraduates are the losers.
Students, at least those who
can afford it, may continue to en
roll at Stanford because it is a
status institution. But it is be
coming increasingly apparent
there is little correlation bet
ween an institution's status and
the quality of its undergraduate
program. â–º
