Debate worthwhile
Editor:
Regarding Derek Penslar's Jan.
26 letter, debate is not and never
will be dead at Stanford or at
many other major universities.
Penslar's letter takes a dim and
narrow-minded view of college
debate.
I commend him for his percep
tion of debate as it was "decades
ago." However, I abhor his de
scription of modern day debate.
Rather than let debate die, it
would be better to work for
changes in the system. Penslar
seeks to destroy a system which
he has not even attempted to al
ter.
Penslar disagrees with the
technique of "spreading," one
which he used quite effectively
while in high school. Only the
best college teams use this
technique.
They do so because they have
more evidence and better
analysis. They wish to present as
many good arguments as they
possibly can.
If a judge can't write down an
argument because a team spoke
too quickly, then the judge must
consider those arguments which
he failed to write down as unis
sued in the round.
Penslar also dislikes the trend
away from debating rhetorical
arguments. 1 feel it is more valu
able to debate current national
problems than to debate rhetori
cal questions.
Finally. Penslar charges that
debaters do not seek the truth.
But what is the truth? And who
holds the answer? If anything
was ever 100 percent true then
there would be no need to debate
about it.
Debate may be far from per
fect, but 1 know of no other activ
ity which seeks to accomplish as

much as does debating current
national problems.

The article Charlie Hall and I
wrote about Saul Bellow for the
Jan. 29 Thursday has received
much commentary. I would like
to correct the negative impres
sion we unintentionally created.
The fact is we failed to em
phasize was the serendipity of
Bellows presence on campus.
When one of America's greatest
writers visits Stanford to speak
in undergraduate residences,
there is cause for great celebra
tion.
Whatever the results of Bel
lows visit, the program was a
remarkable experiment in resi
dential education.
Nor were the results marginal.
Bellow gave one reading, two in
formal talks and many personal
interviews. How often does the
Stanford community have a
chance to hear a writer of Bel
low's stature, especially under
such optimal conditions?
Personal criticisms of Bel
low's response to under
graduates are somewhat irrelev
ant. He may have answered
questions briefly, but he was al
ways polite and patient.

If the questions posed were
uninformed and uninspired, this
is scarcely Bellows'fault.
The real problem with Bel
low's visit was his schedule was
too crowded. He is a reserved
man in his 60s, and several
days of constant socializing after
a long trip were understandably
tiring on him.
If our article gave the impres
sion Bellow's visit to Stanford
was an unsuccessful or unples
ant affair the fault was ours and
not Bellow's.

During the past two weeks, the
Daily has carried two feature ar
ticles on campus figures — on
Saul Bellow and on Hubert the
White Plaza evangelist. Both
were described, in very condes
cending terms, as being able to
overcome their natural disability
of short stature.
Bellow, although only 5 foot 4,
has a "poise which fills the at
mosphere around him." Holy
Hubert is headlined as a "pint
sized zealot," who stands a
"mere 5 foot 4" but "within his
small frame packs enough
energy ..."
Surely, if either of these indi
viduals were black or female and

were described in similar lan
guage, good taste and a respect
for the decent opinion of man
kind would encourage the Daily
to edit these articles more care
fully. What would be the re
sponse to: "Although only a
woman, Betty P'ord does not
hesitate to speak out on public
affairs" or to "Despite his black
skin, Julian Bond is a very effec
tive speaker?"
While these two cases are ob
viously objectionable, somehow
the fact that a small person can
make an impression on others in
this world of oversized giants
needs to be called to public at-

tention.
Because short people are polit
ical ly unorganized and have
traditionally accepted their op
pression with stoic silence, "tal
lists" (people who discriminate
on the basis of height) think no
thing of wantonly displaying
their prejudice whenever the
opportunity arises.
The time for that is rapidly
coming to an end, however, and
retribution will be certain and
severe. Take care.

much commentary. I would like
to correct the negative impres
sion we unintentionally created.
The fact is we failed to em
phasize was the serendipity of
Bellows presence on campus.
When one of America's greatest
writers visits Stanford to speak
in undergraduate residences,
there is cause for great celebra
tion.
Whatever the results of Bel
lows visit, the program was a
remarkable experiment in resi
dential education.
Nor were the results marginal.
Bellow gave one reading, two in
formal talks and many personal
interviews. How often does the
Stanford community have a
chance to hear a writer of Bel
low's stature, especially under
such optimal conditions?
Personal criticisms of Bel
low's response to under
graduates are somewhat irrelev
ant. He may have answered
questions briefly, but he was al
ways polite and patient.

If the questions posed were
uninformed and uninspired, this
is scarcely Bellows'fault.
The real problem with Bel
low's visit was his schedule was
too crowded. He is a reserved
man in his 60s, and several
days of constant socializing after
a long trip were understandably
tiring on him.
If our article gave the impres
sion Bellow's visit to Stanford
was an unsuccessful or unples
ant affair the fault was ours and
not Bellow's.

During the past two weeks, the
Daily has carried two feature ar
ticles on campus figures — on
Saul Bellow and on Hubert the
White Plaza evangelist. Both
were described, in very condes
cending terms, as being able to
overcome their natural disability
of short stature.
Bellow, although only 5 foot 4,
has a "poise which fills the at
mosphere around him." Holy
Hubert is headlined as a "pint
sized zealot," who stands a
"mere 5 foot 4" but "within his
small frame packs enough
energy ..."
Surely, if either of these indi
viduals were black or female and

were described in similar lan
guage, good taste and a respect
for the decent opinion of man
kind would encourage the Daily
to edit these articles more care
fully. What would be the re
sponse to: "Although only a
woman, Betty P'ord does not
hesitate to speak out on public
affairs" or to "Despite his black
skin, Julian Bond is a very effec
tive speaker?"
While these two cases are ob
viously objectionable, somehow
the fact that a small person can
make an impression on others in
this world of oversized giants
needs to be called to public at-

tention.
Because short people are polit
ical ly unorganized and have
traditionally accepted their op
pression with stoic silence, "tal
lists" (people who discriminate
on the basis of height) think no
thing of wantonly displaying
their prejudice whenever the
opportunity arises.
The time for that is rapidly
coming to an end, however, and
retribution will be certain and
severe. Take care.

Regarding Derek Penslar's Jan.
26 letter, debate is not and never
will be dead at Stanford or at
many other major universities.
Penslar's letter takes a dim and
narrow-minded view of college
debate.
I commend him for his percep
tion of debate as it was "decades
ago." However, I abhor his de
scription of modern day debate.
Rather than let debate die, it
would be better to work for
changes in the system. Penslar
seeks to destroy a system which
he has not even attempted to al
ter.
Penslar disagrees with the
technique of "spreading," one
which he used quite effectively
while in high school. Only the
best college teams use this
technique.
They do so because they have
more evidence and better
analysis. They wish to present as
many good arguments as they
possibly can.
If a judge can't write down an
argument because a team spoke
too quickly, then the judge must
consider those arguments which
he failed to write down as unis
sued in the round.
Penslar also dislikes the trend
away from debating rhetorical
arguments. 1 feel it is more valu
able to debate current national
problems than to debate rhetori
cal questions.
Finally. Penslar charges that
debaters do not seek the truth.
But what is the truth? And who
holds the answer? If anything
was ever 100 percent true then
there would be no need to debate
about it.
Debate may be far from per
fect, but 1 know of no other activ
ity which seeks to accomplish as

much as does debating current
national problems.

sized zealot," who stands a
"mere 5 foot 4" but "within his

energy ..."
Surely, if either of these indi
viduals were black or female and

were described in similar lan
guage, good taste and a respect
for the decent opinion of man
kind would encourage the Daily
to edit these articles more care
fully. What would be the re
sponse to: "Although only a
woman, Betty P'ord does not
hesitate to speak out on public
affairs" or to "Despite his black
skin, Julian Bond is a very effec
tive speaker?"
While these two cases are ob
viously objectionable, somehow
the fact that a small person can
make an impression on others in
this world of oversized giants
needs to be called to public at-

tention.
Because short people are polit
ical ly unorganized and have
traditionally accepted their op
pression with stoic silence, "tal
lists" (people who discriminate
on the basis of height) think no
thing of wantonly displaying
their prejudice whenever the
opportunity arises.
The time for that is rapidly
coming to an end, however, and
retribution will be certain and
severe. Take care.

Debate worthwhile
Editor:
Regarding Derek Penslar's Jan.
26 letter, debate is not and never
will be dead at Stanford or at
many other major universities.
Penslar's letter takes a dim and
narrow-minded view of college
debate.
I commend him for his percep
tion of debate as it was "decades
ago." However, I abhor his de
scription of modern day debate.
Rather than let debate die, it
would be better to work for
changes in the system. Penslar
seeks to destroy a system which
he has not even attempted to al
ter.
Penslar disagrees with the
technique of "spreading," one
which he used quite effectively
while in high school. Only the
best college teams use this
technique.
They do so because they have
more evidence and better
analysis. They wish to present as
many good arguments as they
possibly can.
If a judge can't write down an
argument because a team spoke
too quickly, then the judge must
consider those arguments which
he failed to write down as unis
sued in the round.
Penslar also dislikes the trend
away from debating rhetorical
arguments. 1 feel it is more valu
able to debate current national
problems than to debate rhetori
cal questions.
Finally. Penslar charges that
debaters do not seek the truth.
But what is the truth? And who
holds the answer? If anything
was ever 100 percent true then
there would be no need to debate
about it.
Debate may be far from per
fect, but 1 know of no other activ
ity which seeks to accomplish as

much as does debating current
national problems.

Bellow reconsidered
Editor:
The article Charlie Hall and I
wrote about Saul Bellow for the
Jan. 29 Thursday has received
much commentary. I would like
to correct the negative impres
sion we unintentionally created.
The fact is we failed to em
phasize was the serendipity of
Bellows presence on campus.
When one of America's greatest
writers visits Stanford to speak
in undergraduate residences,
there is cause for great celebra
tion.
Whatever the results of Bel
lows visit, the program was a
remarkable experiment in resi
dential education.
Nor were the results marginal.
Bellow gave one reading, two in
formal talks and many personal
interviews. How often does the
Stanford community have a
chance to hear a writer of Bel
low's stature, especially under
such optimal conditions?
Personal criticisms of Bel
low's response to under
graduates are somewhat irrelev
ant. He may have answered
questions briefly, but he was al
ways polite and patient.

If the questions posed were
uninformed and uninspired, this
is scarcely Bellows'fault.
The real problem with Bel
low's visit was his schedule was
too crowded. He is a reserved
man in his 60s, and several
days of constant socializing after
a long trip were understandably
tiring on him.
If our article gave the impres
sion Bellow's visit to Stanford
was an unsuccessful or unples
ant affair the fault was ours and
not Bellow's.

Short people
Editor:
During the past two weeks, the
Daily has carried two feature ar
ticles on campus figures — on
Saul Bellow and on Hubert the
White Plaza evangelist. Both
were described, in very condes
cending terms, as being able to
overcome their natural disability
of short stature.
Bellow, although only 5 foot 4,
has a "poise which fills the at
mosphere around him." Holy
Hubert is headlined as a "pint
sized zealot," who stands a
"mere 5 foot 4" but "within his
small frame packs enough
energy ..."
Surely, if either of these indi
viduals were black or female and

were described in similar lan
guage, good taste and a respect
for the decent opinion of man
kind would encourage the Daily
to edit these articles more care
fully. What would be the re
sponse to: "Although only a
