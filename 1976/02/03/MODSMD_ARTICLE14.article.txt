Which costs more, a minute of advertising during the Hose Parade
or a minute during the Hose Bowl game? -A.S.
The exact costs depend on the broadcasting area or "market,"
according to an NIK] source. However, an advertising spot during
the Rose Bowl game is always much more expensive.
For the Los Angeles market, a 30-second advertisement during
the parade costs $1400. The same spot during the game is $5500.
The difference obviously depends on the number of viewers,
[luring the Rose Howl game, 79 percent of the people watching
television in the L. A. area are watching the game (and 00 percent of
those who own a TV are using it at that time). During the parade
only 27 percent of those watching television are watching NBC,
probably because it is also carried on three different L.A. channels.
Oddly enough, 34 percent of TV viewers watch the Rose Parade
Review, which comes after the parade. Obviously, people enjoy
seeing Tony Orlando making inane comments to nymphets. No
accounting for tastes (especially in Los Angeles).
Everybody's been complaining about how high the price of
gasoline has gotten in the past couple of years. But at 75 cents per
gallon, I can much more easily afford a gallon of gas than a gallon
of milk, which costs about twice as much. For this reason I have
considered putting gasoline on my Frosty-O's in the morning. My
queries: How much gasoline consumption can my body tolerate
without ill effects'. 1 ' How much will do me in? -S.C.
A nurse at Cowell Health Center explained that the real danger
with gasoline is inhalation of the fumes, resulting in pneumonia.
And a teaspoon is enough for that. While gas itself is toxic, the
fumes will undoubtedly get you before the poison does. She was
extremely disturbed by your suggestion, commenting, "That's the
wildest, dumbest thing 1 ever heard."
Incidentally, if you ever want this sort of information from the
Poison Control Center (in San Jose), don't bother calling unless
you're choking on the stuff. A kind and stuffy bureaucrat gently
explained to me (for a bout five minutes) that this was an emergency
line which could not give out that sort of information to just
anyone.
