What are some of the ways in
which universities can become
more receptive to the needs and
goals of women students? What
specific goals should campus
women's groups set as priorities
in order to he most effective?
About Ifi wo >en had the u
nique opportunity to discuss
these an»l other questions on
Saturday with Jill Ker Conway,
the new president of Smith Col
lege. at the Center for Research
on Women.
Smith is the nation's largest
private college for women, and
in its 100 year history, Conway is
its first female president.
A central question facing
female collegiates is what a uni
versity ought to accomplish for
the women attending it.
"In a male-dominated institu
tion there is no need for a reas
sessment of what that institution
ought to be for the men, but for
the women it is a different mat
ter," she said. "The first goal of
university women's groups
ought to be such a reassess
ment."
Once the specific goal is out
lined, women must work to keep
the central issues before the ad
ministration, Conway said.
"They must continually pre
sent the results of their research,
and increase the administra
tion's awareness of the areas in
which women know a lack of
concern or response exists."
Convinced that women face
many of the same problems re
gardless of the type of university
they attend, Conway discussed
the changes necessary in the
administration structures of
both Stanford and Smith.
"In order to increase the effec
tiveness of the university in
satisfying women's needs,
changes in certain programs and
policies must be combined with
an increase in women person
nel," she said.

If more women are to be hired,
the ways in which they will im
prove service to women students
must be demonstrated.
"Women will not be hired
simply because they are women.
They must present the ways in
which they will be more effec
tive in the position than men
could be," she said.
But the issue is not simply the
number of women hired, she
emphasized.
"A certain number of female
professors or administrators will

not necessarily ensure that the
school is meeting women's
needs," she commented.
Conway holds a PhD in his
tory from Harvard, and until her
inauguration in July as Smith's
president, she was the vice pres
ident for internal affairs at the
University of Toronto.
Despite her affiliation with
these coeducational institutions,
she feels that women's schools
such as Smith may be more effec
tive in furthering the educa
tional goals of women.

which universities can become
more receptive to the needs and
goals of women students? What
specific goals should campus
women's groups set as priorities
in order to he most effective?
About Ifi wo >en had the u
nique opportunity to discuss
these an»l other questions on
Saturday with Jill Ker Conway,
the new president of Smith Col
lege. at the Center for Research
on Women.
Smith is the nation's largest
private college for women, and
in its 100 year history, Conway is
its first female president.
A central question facing
female collegiates is what a uni
versity ought to accomplish for
the women attending it.
"In a male-dominated institu
tion there is no need for a reas
sessment of what that institution
ought to be for the men, but for
the women it is a different mat
ter," she said. "The first goal of
university women's groups
ought to be such a reassess
ment."
Once the specific goal is out
lined, women must work to keep
the central issues before the ad
ministration, Conway said.
"They must continually pre
sent the results of their research,
and increase the administra
tion's awareness of the areas in
which women know a lack of
concern or response exists."
Convinced that women face
many of the same problems re
gardless of the type of university
they attend, Conway discussed
the changes necessary in the
administration structures of
both Stanford and Smith.
"In order to increase the effec
tiveness of the university in
satisfying women's needs,
changes in certain programs and
policies must be combined with
an increase in women person
nel," she said.

If more women are to be hired,
the ways in which they will im
prove service to women students
must be demonstrated.
"Women will not be hired
simply because they are women.
They must present the ways in
which they will be more effec
tive in the position than men
could be," she said.
But the issue is not simply the
number of women hired, she
emphasized.
"A certain number of female
professors or administrators will

not necessarily ensure that the
school is meeting women's
needs," she commented.
Conway holds a PhD in his
tory from Harvard, and until her
inauguration in July as Smith's
president, she was the vice pres
ident for internal affairs at the
University of Toronto.
Despite her affiliation with
these coeducational institutions,
she feels that women's schools
such as Smith may be more effec
tive in furthering the educa
tional goals of women.
