# Has development doomed Tahoe?

SOUTH LAKE TAHOE (AP) â€”
Mark Twain once called this
huge mountain lake "the fairest
picture the whole world af
fords."
Now conservationists point to
Tahoe's traffic jams, air pollu
tion and gambling casinos and
wonder if Twain would still be
as enthusiastic.
Still one of the world's purest
lakes, Tahoe is at the middle of
an environmental tug of war that
involves the volatile issues of
land-use planning and state
imposed regional government.
Taking part in this struggle are
environmentalists, local land
owners, casino operators and the
officials who run California and
Nevada.
So far, some environmen
talists say, they and lake are
not doing too well.
They point to the lake's grow
ing pollution problems and the
continued urbanization of the
lake basin and contend that reg
ional governments set up to con
trol Tahoe's growth have not
done their job.
But many local land owners
and developers, on the other
hand, say that regional govern
ment has worked all too well, in
many cases smashing their
hopes to one day turn their ac

reage into condominiums, a
motel or another type of de
velopment.
And there are those both in
and out of state government who
contend that the pollution prob
lem is not as serious as conser
vationists and the Brown ad
ministration say it is.
A deep natural lake 22 miles
long. Tahoe lies in a huge oval
basin in the Sierra Nevada
mountains 6000 feet above see
level.
The lake spans the
California-Nevada border and in
recent years has become a mecca
for gamblers, skies, boating en
thusiasts and other vacationers.
On winter weekend and dur
ing the summer months
thousands of visitors pour into
the basin. During the busiest
times the lake's population tops
150,000 and as many as 55,000
cars a day clog Highway 50,
causing frustrating traffic jams

along the main street of the ba
sin's only incorporated city.
South Lake Tahoe.
There are four major hotel
casinos at the lake now. three of
them at its southern end, and
more on the way. At the northern
and southern ends of the lake, on
the California side, the highway
is lined with motels, fast-food
restaurants and real estate agen
cies.
At times a smog belt is clearly
visible over the lake and experts
say its still-clear waters are be
coming increasingly paluted.
Jean-Michael Cousteau, son of
the famed oceanographer, says
that the lake's environment
could be destroyed "within a
very few years."
"I still don't understand what
goes on in our minds, looking at
what has been built around Lake
Tahoe," he says. "Why mix
gambling with beauty? So why
not put it somewhere else?"
