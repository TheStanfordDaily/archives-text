# Orbiting asteroid threatens the earth
## 
### 
CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) —
Like a dolphin playfully leading
a ship to sea, an asteroid more
than a mile wide skips back and
forth across the earth's path. Like
a shark, someday it probably will
take a 20-mile bite out of the
earth's side.
There is a 75 percent chance
the asteroid, tentatively called
"Fast-moving Object Helin" for
its discoverer, astronomer
Eleanor Helin, will smash into
the earth within 24 million
years, creating a crater some 20
miles wide, Helin said inan
interview Saturday.
"It is the closest thing to the
earth other than the moon in the
solar system," said the 40-year
old Camarillo astronomer who
discovered the asteroid with an
18-inch telescope at Mt.
Palomar, near San Diego, on Jan.
7.
In our orbit
Helin. who is affiliated
with the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena, said
the asteroid is in an orbit around
the sun which is almost identical
to the earth's.
"It spirals back and forth ac
ross our orbit," she said. "It
loops around us once a year,
each time crossing our path."
She said its year is 348 days,
compared with the 365 days it
takes the earth to orbit the sun.
Caltech astrophysicist Eugene
Shoemaker is proposing that the
National Aeronautics and Space

Administration land a spacecraft
on the asteroid, which is esti
mated to be between one and two
miles in diameter.
Spacemission
"Because it is the closest thing
to us besides the moon, it makes
an ideal spacemission," said
Helin. "We feel that if we
can land on it we will be looking
at the most primitive material we
can find in the solar system, the
building blocks of thesystem."
The asteroid, which she called
a "protoplanet." is believed to be
"the kernel of a comet" n its"un
altered, pristine" state. Often as
teroids take on cosmic material
through the years in what she
described as a "sticking pro
cess."
The last time such an asteroid
hit the earth was 25,000 years
ago at mile-wide Meteor Crater
near Flagstaff. Ariz., she said.
The asteroid was only about 100
feet in diameter when it hit, she
said.
Possible tidal wave
A spokesman for Caltech,
Craham Berry, added that there
is more than a 50 percent proba
bility the Helin asteroid will
land in the ocean, in which case
an astronomical tidal wave
would result.
Helin said no official
name has been chosen yet for the
asteroid, but many people are
working on it.
"We will have the privilege of
naming it," she said.

Eleanor Helin, will smash into
the earth within 24 million
years, creating a crater some 20
miles wide, Helin said inan
interview Saturday.
"It is the closest thing to the
earth other than the moon in the
solar system," said the 40-year
old Camarillo astronomer who
discovered the asteroid with an
18-inch telescope at Mt.
Palomar, near San Diego, on Jan.
7.
In our orbit
Helin. who is affiliated
with the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena, said
the asteroid is in an orbit around
the sun which is almost identical
to the earth's.
"It spirals back and forth ac
ross our orbit," she said. "It
loops around us once a year,
each time crossing our path."
She said its year is 348 days,
compared with the 365 days it
takes the earth to orbit the sun.
Caltech astrophysicist Eugene
Shoemaker is proposing that the
National Aeronautics and Space

Administration land a spacecraft
on the asteroid, which is esti
mated to be between one and two
miles in diameter.
Spacemission
"Because it is the closest thing
to us besides the moon, it makes
an ideal spacemission," said
Helin. "We feel that if we
can land on it we will be looking
at the most primitive material we
can find in the solar system, the
building blocks of thesystem."
The asteroid, which she called
a "protoplanet." is believed to be
"the kernel of a comet" n its"un
altered, pristine" state. Often as
teroids take on cosmic material
through the years in what she
described as a "sticking pro
cess."
The last time such an asteroid
hit the earth was 25,000 years
ago at mile-wide Meteor Crater
near Flagstaff. Ariz., she said.
The asteroid was only about 100
feet in diameter when it hit, she
said.
Possible tidal wave
A spokesman for Caltech,
Craham Berry, added that there
is more than a 50 percent proba
bility the Helin asteroid will
land in the ocean, in which case
an astronomical tidal wave
would result.
Helin said no official
name has been chosen yet for the
asteroid, but many people are
working on it.
"We will have the privilege of
naming it," she said.
CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) —
Like a dolphin playfully leading
a ship to sea, an asteroid more
than a mile wide skips back and
forth across the earth's path. Like
a shark, someday it probably will
take a 20-mile bite out of the
earth's side.
There is a 75 percent chance
the asteroid, tentatively called
"Fast-moving Object Helin" for
its discoverer, astronomer
Eleanor Helin, will smash into
the earth within 24 million
years, creating a crater some 20
miles wide, Helin said inan
interview Saturday.
