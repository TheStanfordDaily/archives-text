cuted in Massachusetts in 1927
after a controversial trial.
Socialists and other politi

ter they have formed a defense
committee and appealed to Pres
ident Ford for a retrial.
Sacco and Vanzetti were con

victed in the slayings of a
paymaster and his guard in
South Braintree, Mass., in 1920.
Before the executions there
were worldwide demonstrations
