Ohio State's student newspaper. The Lantern, called for 'he
resignation of football coach Woody Hayes in an editorial list
Friday, the Associated Press reported this weekend.
The editorial criticized Hayes for refusing to talk to reporters
following the23-10 Rose Bowl loss to I)CL,A, for his attitude toward
his players and for dismissing a defensive player from the team.
Hayes has refrained from commenting about the New Year's Day
loss for more than a month.
The Lantern said that Haves' resignation would ease embarrass
ment for the university, "help the players to get a coach who treats
them as human beings," and "help Haves' legend as well."
1 laves, in his 25th year of coaching at Ohio State, has been to the
Rose Bowl four straight years, losing three times.

Most problems that have plagued Stanford at one time or another
are not unique to the University. Last week at UC-Berkeley, a
faculty committee reported that the percentage of women and
members of minority groups appointed as professors decreased last
year, despite an affirmative action plan.
The percentage of women chosen at Berkeley dropped from 25 in
1974 to 16 last year, while minority appointments dipped from 18
to 14 percent, the Daily Californian reported.
The report also indicated that there was every reason tc believe
that the availability of qualified female and minority applicants for
professorships has increased.
A proposal to investigate hiring practices that would have dos
siers of the best-qualified but unsuccessful women and minority
candidates along with that of any white male hired submitted to a
review committee was never implemented.
Vice Chancellor I. Michael Heyman contended that there was
"no evidence" that departments did not look for or discriminate
against minority or women applicants.

At Penn State University, hearings are underway to determine
the makeup of a possible faculty collective bargaining unit, accord
ing to the Collegian, the school's student newspaper.
The Pennsylvania State University Professional Association, in
its petition to the labor board, asked that 4200 faculty members and
non-teach professionals be included in the proposed unit.
However, the American Association of University Professors has
asked that only full-time teaching faculty members be included,
and the Graduate Student Association wants all graduate research
assistants, teaching assistants and teaching fellows in the unit.
Further disagreements between the University and the two fa
culty associations include whether medical center professors and
department chairpersons are to be included in the unit.
While the various groups may disagree about the makeup of the
faculty union, spokespersons on all sides believe that the hearings
will stretch at least through this spring and possibly until next fall,
according to the Collegian.

While Stanford's TMU (Tresidder Memorial Union) food service
has been beset by financial woes during the past few years, Univer
sity of Oregon's EMU has also suffered from increasing deficits, the
Daily Emerald reported.
This past fiscal year, a 15 percent loss of $78,250 was experi
enced because of inflationary food prices and increased labor
salaries, according to EMU's director, Adelle McMillan.
She also pointed out that almost every student union has had a
deficit over the past five years.

The University of California police officers at UCLA apparently
took a page out of former San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto's book
in a recent search for a rapist.
The Daily Bruin reported that a man questioned 30 minutes by
officers said the police told him that all six foot two inch blacks in
the area were being questioned about the rape. Following interro
gation, the man was photographed.
A later issue of the Daily Bruin said that a suspect had been
arrested in the case in another part of Los Angeles.

Commencement exercises may have been controversial here last
year, but Oregon State is having its problems because its ceremony
is scheduled for the Sunday before finals week.
The current date was strongly reaffirmed by the student senate
for many reasons including that graduates already are disadvan
taged in the job market against those at other schools graduating in
May.
The faculty, however, had various objections because grades had
to be reported before dead week in order to assure that students had
passed enough units to graduate.
A compromise has been reached in the dispute, according to the
Barometer, keeping the ceremony before finals, and making the
grades reported before dead week "tentative" or "minimim" on the
condition of certain agreements between professors and students
about how those grades can be changed.
The student could get a higher grade by completing course work
including taking the final; failure to complete requirements for a
"tentative" grade could lead to that grade being lowered on the
student's permanent record, but could not keep him from graduat
ing. (Any motions for that system here?)
