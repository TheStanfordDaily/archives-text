### BERT BOWER 
The Palo Alto City Council last night
unanimously approved a proposal to
improve the "high hazard" inter
change at El Camino Real and Univer
sity Avenue using $42,000 in federal
funds contributed by the University.
Councilman Byron Sher supported
the proposal saying that the Universi
ty's contribution would be "especially
helpful in going forward to cure a bad
problem."
Sher, a former mayor of Palo Alto, is
a professor at the Law School.
City Traffic Engineer Ted Noguchi
said construction of improvements,
consisting of traffic signals and new
lane arrangements, will begin in April
or May.
The University's federal funds were
received over the past two years from
the Community Development Block
Grant. '
In addition,to the University's
$42,000 contribution to the $160,000
project, the city will contribute:
— $57,000 in funds already ear
marked for the project;
—S>3o,ooowhich had been slated for
the improvements of the Embarcadero
Road underpass at Alma Street;
—$32,500fr0m the city's street im
provement fund.
Councilman John Berwald said the
improvement of the Embarcadero
Road underpass maybe delayed for as
long as 10 years due to the transfer of
funds.

Before the proposal's adoption, Sher
asked if $18.6 million in funds origi
nally set aside for the construction of
bus transfer centers could be used for
the interchange improvement. Palo
Alto buses cross the interchange about
every five minutes.
Asst. City Manager Charles
Walker noted that the
funds are only for the improvement of
bus facilities and couldn't be used for
the interchange project.
Noguchi characterized the inter
change as a "serious traffic hazard."
He said numerous access roads meet
University Avenue on either side of
the overpass requiring many motorists
to cross a lane of traffic before turning.
