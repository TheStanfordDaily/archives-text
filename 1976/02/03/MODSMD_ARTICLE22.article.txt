# Marines named "a costly anachronism"

### 
WASHINGTON (AF) — The
Marine Corps is out-of-step with
the times and must abandon its
preoccupation with amphibious
warfare or risk becoming "a
costly anachronism," a Brook
ings Institution study said Sun
day.
"The golden age of amphibi
ous warfare is now the domain of
historians, and the Marine Corps
no longer needs a unique mis
sion to justify its existence," said
Brookings analysts Martin Bin
kin and Jeffrey Record.
They contended the Corps
"must shift its principal focus

from seaborne assault to a more
appropriate mission, such as
garrisoning America's remain
ing outposts in Asia or defend
ing central Europe."
Binkin and Record also raised
questions about the Marine air
arm, which they said consumes
more than half the Corps' budget
and flies more sophisticated
planes than it needs.
"The result is a widening im
balance between Marine air
power, which is geared for the
most sophisticated kind of com
bat, and Marine infantry, whose
fighting prowess still depends

on the physical stamina of the
foot-slogging rifleman," they
said.
In a 93-page study released by
the independent, non-partisan
research institution, the Brook
ings analysts offered four alter
native proposals for fundamen
tal change.
All plans would result in a
smaller Corps than the present
196,000-man force. This, Binkin
and Record said, wopld enable
the Marines to fill their ranks
with higher-quality volunteers
and cure desertion and other
disciplinary problems.

I he Marine Corps limited its
comment to this statement by a
senior spokesman:
"This is one of several opin
ions expressed about the
Marine Corps. The Corps' mis
sion and structure are, of course,
matters of aggressive and con
tinuing study at Marine Corps
headquarters."
Supporters of the Marine
Corps have been worried for
some time that the Corps might
lie downgraded because the Un
ited States has been gradually
scaling down its military pre
sence in the Asian-Pacific area.
