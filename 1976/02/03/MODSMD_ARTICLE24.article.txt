## Blue Leaves': emotional drama 
### KYRA SUBBOTIN 
John Guare's The House of
Blue Leaves, presented by the
Palo Alto Community Players, is
an emotional drama of undeni
able quality.
The play's main character is a
.rustrated New York songwriter.
The drama explores 24 hours in
the life of this man, specifically
the day on which the Pope hap
pens to visit the character's
neighborhood in the Bronx.
Ed Corbett plays Artie
Shaughnessy, the zookeeper
and would-be Irving Berlin.
Shaughnessy is a man whose de
sires and aspirations seem sim
ple. His humor is that of an Ar
chie Bunker, but the character

goes beyond. He sweats with the
distinctiveness of a loser, and he
sings with the humor of the
naive.
Artie is caught between two
women: the wife, Bananas (Mary
Stewart) and the "other," Bunny
Flingus (Carolyn Burr). Each
a&ks for a separate part of his life.
Bananas, who is quite mad. calls
for his love, and Bunny clamors
for the fame which he seems un
able to provide.
The three characters play a
game with unhappiness, and
each tries to slip it to the other.
The taint of insanity is re
flected in the eyes of Artie's
A.W.O.L. son Ronnie, Jon
Selover, who patiently explains
his reasons for assassinating the
Pope as he fondly caresses two
grenades.
The tension of each scene is
magnified by the small conver
sations that each character
shares confidentially with the
audience. Bananas explains her
madness, "I tried to slash my
wrists with spoons." Artie ag
rees, "She can't even go to the
incinerator alone."
Bunny expounds upon her
philosophy, "I'm a rotten lay.
My cooking is the only thing I
have to lure him on with." It's
funny, but distressing.
The emotional study of these
three characters is enough to
support the play, but unfortu
nately, it is complicated by the
characters of a deaf movie star,
three nuns, a psychiatric intern
and the voice of the Pope him
self.
It turns into a game of numbers
as they fill the stage; the audi
ence is shut off from the inti
macy of pity and helplessness. It
is with some surprise that one
learns that murder is Artie's
answer to hopelessness and his
end to loneliness.
The House of Blue Leaves, di
rected by David Motroni, will be
playing Feb. 5, 6 and 7, at the
Palo Alto Community Theatre.
