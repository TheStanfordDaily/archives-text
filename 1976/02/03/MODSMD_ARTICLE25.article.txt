# B.B. King plays fine concert
## 
### BEN DICKINSON 
8.8. King appeared at the
Great Ameican Music Hall last
week and presented three nights
of the best blues being played
today.
King captivated a large
frveek-night audience for an hour
and a half, and left the stage wel 1
after midnight. The audience
dispersed only after a rowdy but
unsuccessful attempt to win an
encore from the exhausted band.
The evening began with a few
numbers by 8.8.'s eight-piece
back-up band. This introduction
lagged a little, but as soon as
"The King of the Blues" ap
peared and treated the house to
several inspired licks from
Lucille, his guitar, the Music
Hall came to life.
The set began with several
;unes off of 8.8.'s latest album,
Lucille Talks Back, which were
followed by many older tunes of
widely varying mood, from the
melancholy "The Thrill Is
Gone" to his lighter-toned lyri
cal classic "I've Got Some Help 1
Don't Need."
As King reached back for the
older tunes, the band seemed to
shake off it's business-like ap
proach to the music, and several
members cut loose with tense
and energy-filled solos. Ron
Levy on piano and Bobby Forte
on tenor sax did especially im
pressive spots.
Almost everyone in the hall
joined in on the somewhat sac
charine "I LikeTo LiveTheLove
1 Sing About" and the less virtu
ous "Everybody Likes A Little."
The crowd's general mood
seemed to illustrate how much
better 8.8. King performs in the
smaller music hall atmosphere
than in the more impersonal
large concert environment.
Soon it became clear that 8.8.
King and his band were putting
together an above average per
formance. After they got
finished with the newer mate
rial, which they have undoub
tedly overplayed, and started
taking requests from the audi
ence, they repeatedly spun out
renditions unsullied by over
practice and loaded with crea
tive energy.
By the end of the evening, 8.8.
King had once again proven that
even after thirty years of almost
non-stop touring, he was still
able to stir excitement and awe
in an audience.
