# Poetry with soul
## Nikki Giovanni shares 
### KEITH CALHOUN 
Nikki Giovanni is a poet, a black poet
although one would never guess by her name.
Nikki Giovanni came to Memorial Church Sun
day, bringing with her the warmth and humor, the
arrogance and energy,theconsummateblackness
that has become her trademark and that her read
ers have come to love.
She spoke to the near capacity crowd about her
life and her loves, her radical days and survival for
tomorrow.
Her appearance on campus represented the first
of a series of activities sponsored by the Black
Student Union in celebration of Black Liberation
Month, a month of activities that include a film
series, seminars, workshops, African-recipe study
breaks, a fashion show and an appearance by the
mayor of Oakland.
Giovanni was an excellent choice to start it off.
Kidnap
She grabbed us from the time she walked on,
leading us through her life, controlling us as mas
terfully as she does the words in her poems, kid
naping us. . .
ever been kidnaped
by a poet
if i were a poet
i'd kidnap you
put you in my phrases and meter

you to jones beach
or mnybe coney island
or may be just to my house
lyric you in lilacs
lash you in the rain
blend into the beach
to complement my see
play the lyre for you
ode you with my love song
anything to win you
wrap you in the red black green
show you off to mama
yeah if i were a poet i'd kid
nap you
And 1 guess the thing that really made me fall in
love with her was the way she let all of us there get
close to her, share the real, human Nikki.
She so exactly said what I've always wanted to
say about my blackness. It was refreshing, cool
andexciting.and she said it with the beauty that I
could never master. She told us bits of her life and
punctuated them with her poems. Stories ranging
from her love for an unresponding revolutionary
("Love can really enrich your life if you don't take
it too seriously") to her grandmother ("You can
never win an argument with an old person").
Soon it was all over and she was off to Seattle or
somewhere,and I thought to myself. "What a hip
want to start off Black Liberation Month."
