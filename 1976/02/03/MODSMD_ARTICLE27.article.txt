If you didn't catch the San
Francisco Symphony's recent
performance of Mahler's Tenth
Symphony and Mozart's Ninth
Piano Concerto you didn't miss
much. Unfortunately, it could
only be described as fair to
middling.
Opening with the piano con
certo, the orchestra had a hard
time getting off the ground. This
could have been partially due to
the guest conductor's (Niklaus
Wyss') initial inability to im
merse himself fully into the
music, a problem which the sol
oist, Misha Dichter,also shared.
From his performance that
night, it was difficult to under
stand how Dichter in the past
had received such high acclaim.
