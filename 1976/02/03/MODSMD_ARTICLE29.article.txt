# Stanford pair a funky wash
## 
### BRUCE STRONG 
Another Friday night on the
Farm. A quick look around the
dorm is enough to reassure you
that there would be more action
at the county morgue.
But all is not lost — rumor has
it that there is going to be a dance
at Cedro, in Wilbur Hall. After
having made one of the least dif
ficult decisions of your life,
whether to study P- chem or go
out, you find yourself in the dar
kened lounge of Cedro.
At the party everyone seems to
be enjoying themselves and the
band sounds great. Even though
their slow tunes are too loud (a
problem common to young
bands who can't afford sound
engineers), their playing is tight,
and on their fast numbers they
cook.
And yet, even though it is ob
vious that this is no run-of-the
mill dance-band, there is
another point of interest: the two
horn players are full time Stan
ford students. Why do they do it,
and how can they afford the
time?
Both Mike Honig (trombone)
and Bob Andreani (trumpet)
agree that they play because it's
fun, and because it's a chance to
pickup ona littletuition money.
But they also have their pe
sonal reasons. Honig, who is an
EDE major, explains as he points
to the floppy hat on his head that
he likes having the chance to
wear funky clothes. Andreani. a
music major, says that playing in
a band can be an expanding ex
perience.
"It makes you more hip to the
outside world," explains And

reani. "You meet all types of
people in nightclubs. We've
been approached by hookers,
pushers, dealers in hot mer
chandise and older women try
ing to pick us up."
When asked how they can af
ford the time, they just groan and
admit the fact that between play
ing and the books there isn't time
for much else.
But they hasten to add that it's
well worth it. They have already
cut a single which is now
number 29 on KSOL's top 40,
and they recently played at
Keystone Korner in Berkeley.
So next time you are at a dance
and hear the name of Joe
Washington and the Wash,
check out the two horn players.
And if you see them doing prob
lem sets between sets, take pity
on them and give them a hand.
They will put on a good show for
you.

avoid academic pitfalls while still keeping the funk flowing. Both
students are members of Joe Washington and the Wash, and up
and-coming local band.
