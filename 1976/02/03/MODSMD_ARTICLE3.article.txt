# Housing manager quits
## 
### 
Alan Cummings, manager of student housing, submitted his resignation last
Friday. Cummings will leave his position on Feb. 20 to become logistics
manager in University procurement services.
Cummings said last night he was taking the new position because it "will
provide the opportunity to be involved in another important part of University
service operations."
Cummings had been dealing with fraternities who had been protesting their
rent increases and leases since September. Cummings said his involvement
with the fraternities was not the reason for his resignation.
"It's unfortunate that I'm leaving because I was enjoying my contact with the
fraternities," he said. "I'm sorry to be leaving."
Cummings' assistant. Chet Choy, resigned two months ago to work at UC-
Berkeley.
Cummings and his superior, Director of University Housing Ed Scoles, will
be examining Cummings' office "to organize its functions ... so it will provide
equal or better service," Cummings said.
