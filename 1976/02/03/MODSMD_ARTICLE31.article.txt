Officials: Nixon memo sent
WASHINGTON — State Department officials
acknowledged yesterday that former President
Richard Nixon sent a memorandum to North Viet
namese leaders promising his administration
would consider massive postwar rehabilitation as
sistance.
But these officials said the memorandum was
sent after the signing of the Jan. 27,1973, agreement
in Paris to end the war in Vietnam and that the aid
was not held out as an inducement to end the fight
ing.
This account supports Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger's publicrstatements at the time that there
was only a general discussion of possible economic
help with the North Vietnamese prior to the Paris
agreement.
The latest account was given to reporters after
consultation with Kissinger, who was on a West
Coast speaking trip.
The officials, who declined use of their names,
said the possibility of aid was taken up by a joint
U.S. and North Vietnamese economic commission
from March 1973 until July of that year. The idea
was dropped because of repeated violations by
Hanoi of the Paris accord, the officials said.
At the White House, Press Secretary Ron Nessen
said, "The whole issue became moot" because
Hanoi violated the peace agreement "by starting
the war up again and failing to give full accounting
of Americans killed and missing in action in North
Vietnam."
Hearst trial still secret
SAN FRANCISCO — Patricia Hearst, appearing
animated, confident and encouraged by the prog
ress ot jury selection, was visible to the press for
five minutes yesterday as her closed trial was
briefly opened.
However, secrecy continued to shroud the pro
ceedings, and Hearst's judge issued an official
defense of his decision to bar press and public from
this first phase of her celebrated trial.
U.S. District Court Judge Oliver Carter, declaring
he still dislikes gag rules, insisted that the "fever
pitch" of interest and publicity in thecase required
the closed doors.
In a written memorandum, Carter said he be
lieved Hearst's Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial
takes precedence over the First Amendment con
stitutional guarantee of freedom of speech and
press.
Carter declared the only purpose of his action
was to try "to insure the impartiality of those who
will be called to pass judgment upon her."
In the short public session, Carter revealed that a
jury for Hearst's bank robbery trial could be
seated sometime today.
Blizzard hits East Coast
ALBANY, N.Y. — Bone-chilling cold and swirl

ing snow driven by blizzard- force winds whipped
up the East Coast and into parts of the Midwest
yesterday, causing school closings, power failures
and snarled traffic.
The surprise storm started in North Carolina and
swept up the coast to Maine, dumping up to six
inches ot snow along the way and paralyzing
rush-hour traffic. However, the snow subsided by
midafternoon but temperatures remained in the
teens.
"We didn't predict the severity," said Ken
LaPenta, a forecaster at the National Weather Ser
vice here. "We did predict the change to snow and
very high winds. It got a little colder than we
thought, a little faster."
Icy roads in Missouri were blamed for two traffic
fatalities while numerous fender-benders, causing
a few minor injuries, were reported throughout
the states affected by the storm.
The storm brought winds gusting up to 70 miles
per hour in many parts of the Northeast. And the
wild, fast-changing weather pattern made it dif
ficult for forecasters to pi n down the exact situation
everywhere, but they said blizzard or near-blizzard
conditions existed in many parts of the area.
Candidates' funds in danger
WASHINGTON — While Congressional leaders
spoke pessimistically yesterday about how fast a
new campaign finance law can be enacted, presi
dential primary candidates faced the prospect that
their federal funds spigot will be turned off March
1.
The Federal Election Commission (FEC) agreed
yesterday to distribute matching campaign funds to
candidates as quickly as applications can be
checked this month.
But if Congress has not complied with a Supreme
Court invitation to rewrite the law by Feb. 29, there
will apparently be no agency qualified to pass out
the money.
The court ruled Friday that the commission,
overseer of federal election laws, was appointed
unconstitutionally. It permitted the FEC to con
tinue functioning for 30 days to allow Congress to
act, but ruled that if nothing is done by then, the
commission's powers would be greatly curtailed.
More guns to go to Lebanon
BEIRUT, Lebanon — The leader of Lebanon's
main Christian militia said yesterday he is import
ing new arms because another round of civil war is
inevitable unless radical Palestinians and Lebanese
are "beaten down."
"Now and tomorrow and the day after tomorrow,
as long as we are obliged to defend ourselves, we
will buy arms for ourselves. Phalange party chief
tain Pierre Gemayel said in an interview with The
Associated Press.
"We would be imbeciles if we did the opposite."

Gamayel's party fields the largest Christian
militia fighting leftist forces backed by Palestinian
guerrillas. The most influential Lebanese Moslem
leftist leader. Kamal Junblatt. said in an interview
with the AP on Sunday that he, too. is importing
fresh arms, and he predicted new fighting by
spring.
Richardson sworn in
WASHINGTON — Welcoming Elliot Richardson
to his Cabinet, President Ford said yesterday heand
his new Commerce secretary will pursue realistic,
common sense economic policies that "don't raise
false promises or false hopes."
Before witnessing Richardson's swearing-in for
an unprecedented fourth Cabinet post, Ford said of
the former secretary of Defense, attorney general
and secretary of Health, Education and Welfare:
"He will be a great deal of help to me."
Richardson, sometimes mentioned as a possible
Republican vice presidential candidate this year,
responded that "the strengthening of free enter
prise is the only sure means of continuing the re
covery that your steadfast policies have already set
in motion."
GE engineers resign

who have been involved in the development of
nearly 100 nuclear power plants for General Elec
tric (GE) resigned yesterday, saying they are con
vinced nuclear power threatens future generations.

claims," the spokesman said.

their federal funds spigot will be turned off March
1.
The Federal Election Commission (FEC) agreed
yesterday to distribute matching campaign funds to
candidates as quickly as applications can be
checked this month.
But if Congress has not complied with a Supreme
Court invitation to rewrite the law by Feb. 29, there
will apparently be no agency qualified to pass out
the money.
The court ruled Friday that the commission,
overseer of federal election laws, was appointed
unconstitutionally. It permitted the FEC to con
tinue functioning for 30 days to allow Congress to
act, but ruled that if nothing is done by then, the
commission's powers would be greatly curtailed.

Officials: Nixon memo sent
WASHINGTON — State Department officials
acknowledged yesterday that former President
Richard Nixon sent a memorandum to North Viet
namese leaders promising his administration
would consider massive postwar rehabilitation as
sistance.
But these officials said the memorandum was
sent after the signing of the Jan. 27,1973, agreement
in Paris to end the war in Vietnam and that the aid
was not held out as an inducement to end the fight
ing.
This account supports Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger's publicrstatements at the time that there
was only a general discussion of possible economic
help with the North Vietnamese prior to the Paris
agreement.
The latest account was given to reporters after
consultation with Kissinger, who was on a West
Coast speaking trip.
The officials, who declined use of their names,
said the possibility of aid was taken up by a joint
U.S. and North Vietnamese economic commission
from March 1973 until July of that year. The idea
was dropped because of repeated violations by
Hanoi of the Paris accord, the officials said.
At the White House, Press Secretary Ron Nessen
said, "The whole issue became moot" because
Hanoi violated the peace agreement "by starting
the war up again and failing to give full accounting
of Americans killed and missing in action in North
Vietnam."
Hearst trial still secret
SAN FRANCISCO — Patricia Hearst, appearing
animated, confident and encouraged by the prog
ress ot jury selection, was visible to the press for
five minutes yesterday as her closed trial was
briefly opened.
However, secrecy continued to shroud the pro
ceedings, and Hearst's judge issued an official
defense of his decision to bar press and public from
this first phase of her celebrated trial.
U.S. District Court Judge Oliver Carter, declaring
he still dislikes gag rules, insisted that the "fever
pitch" of interest and publicity in thecase required
the closed doors.
In a written memorandum, Carter said he be
lieved Hearst's Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial
takes precedence over the First Amendment con
stitutional guarantee of freedom of speech and
press.
Carter declared the only purpose of his action
was to try "to insure the impartiality of those who
will be called to pass judgment upon her."
In the short public session, Carter revealed that a
jury for Hearst's bank robbery trial could be
seated sometime today.
Blizzard hits East Coast
ALBANY, N.Y. — Bone-chilling cold and swirl

ing snow driven by blizzard- force winds whipped
up the East Coast and into parts of the Midwest
yesterday, causing school closings, power failures
and snarled traffic.
The surprise storm started in North Carolina and
swept up the coast to Maine, dumping up to six
inches ot snow along the way and paralyzing
rush-hour traffic. However, the snow subsided by
midafternoon but temperatures remained in the
teens.
"We didn't predict the severity," said Ken
LaPenta, a forecaster at the National Weather Ser
vice here. "We did predict the change to snow and
very high winds. It got a little colder than we
thought, a little faster."
Icy roads in Missouri were blamed for two traffic
fatalities while numerous fender-benders, causing
a few minor injuries, were reported throughout
the states affected by the storm.
The storm brought winds gusting up to 70 miles
per hour in many parts of the Northeast. And the
wild, fast-changing weather pattern made it dif
ficult for forecasters to pi n down the exact situation
everywhere, but they said blizzard or near-blizzard
conditions existed in many parts of the area.

But these officials said the memorandum was
sent after the signing of the Jan. 27,1973, agreement
in Paris to end the war in Vietnam and that the aid
was not held out as an inducement to end the fight
ing.
This account supports Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger's publicrstatements at the time that there
was only a general discussion of possible economic
help with the North Vietnamese prior to the Paris
agreement.
The latest account was given to reporters after
consultation with Kissinger, who was on a West
Coast speaking trip.
The officials, who declined use of their names,
said the possibility of aid was taken up by a joint
U.S. and North Vietnamese economic commission
from March 1973 until July of that year. The idea
was dropped because of repeated violations by
Hanoi of the Paris accord, the officials said.
At the White House, Press Secretary Ron Nessen
said, "The whole issue became moot" because
Hanoi violated the peace agreement "by starting
the war up again and failing to give full accounting
of Americans killed and missing in action in North
Vietnam."
Hearst trial still secret
SAN FRANCISCO — Patricia Hearst, appearing
animated, confident and encouraged by the prog
ress ot jury selection, was visible to the press for
five minutes yesterday as her closed trial was
briefly opened.
However, secrecy continued to shroud the pro
ceedings, and Hearst's judge issued an official
defense of his decision to bar press and public from
this first phase of her celebrated trial.
U.S. District Court Judge Oliver Carter, declaring
he still dislikes gag rules, insisted that the "fever
pitch" of interest and publicity in thecase required
the closed doors.
In a written memorandum, Carter said he be
lieved Hearst's Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial
takes precedence over the First Amendment con
stitutional guarantee of freedom of speech and
press.
Carter declared the only purpose of his action
was to try "to insure the impartiality of those who
will be called to pass judgment upon her."
In the short public session, Carter revealed that a
jury for Hearst's bank robbery trial could be
seated sometime today.
Blizzard hits East Coast
ALBANY, N.Y. — Bone-chilling cold and swirl

ing snow driven by blizzard- force winds whipped
up the East Coast and into parts of the Midwest
yesterday, causing school closings, power failures
and snarled traffic.
The surprise storm started in North Carolina and
swept up the coast to Maine, dumping up to six
inches ot snow along the way and paralyzing
rush-hour traffic. However, the snow subsided by
midafternoon but temperatures remained in the
teens.
"We didn't predict the severity," said Ken
LaPenta, a forecaster at the National Weather Ser
vice here. "We did predict the change to snow and
very high winds. It got a little colder than we
thought, a little faster."
Icy roads in Missouri were blamed for two traffic
fatalities while numerous fender-benders, causing
a few minor injuries, were reported throughout
the states affected by the storm.
The storm brought winds gusting up to 70 miles
per hour in many parts of the Northeast. And the
wild, fast-changing weather pattern made it dif
ficult for forecasters to pi n down the exact situation
everywhere, but they said blizzard or near-blizzard
conditions existed in many parts of the area.
Candidates' funds in danger
WASHINGTON — While Congressional leaders
spoke pessimistically yesterday about how fast a
new campaign finance law can be enacted, presi
dential primary candidates faced the prospect that
their federal funds spigot will be turned off March
1.
The Federal Election Commission (FEC) agreed
yesterday to distribute matching campaign funds to
candidates as quickly as applications can be
checked this month.
But if Congress has not complied with a Supreme
Court invitation to rewrite the law by Feb. 29, there
will apparently be no agency qualified to pass out
the money.
The court ruled Friday that the commission,
overseer of federal election laws, was appointed
unconstitutionally. It permitted the FEC to con
tinue functioning for 30 days to allow Congress to
act, but ruled that if nothing is done by then, the
commission's powers would be greatly curtailed.

commission's powers would be greatly curtailed.
