# Moynihan resigns, plans to teach again
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Daniel
Moynihan, who has been embroiled in
controversy since becoming U.S. am
bassador to the United Nations last
year, resigned yesterday, telling Presi
dent Ford: "It is time to return to teach
ing."
In a letter of reply, Ford accepted the
resignation "with the deepest regret
and reluctance," declaring that
Moynihan had "asserted our position
forcefully, cogently and honestly" at
the United Nations.
Moynihan told reporters at the Un
ited Nations, "I assume I'll be back in
government one way or other some
day. I'm going back to teaching now."
He seemed to rule out an early race for
the U.S. Senate.
When a reporter remarked that a lot
of Democrats were talking about his
running next November against Sen.
James Buckley (R-N.Y.), Moynihan re
plied, "I'm not."
As the White House announced his
resignation, Moynihan was in consul
tations of the U.N. Security Council in
his capacity of council president for
February.
Harvard
Although his resignation was effec
tive immediately, Moynihan said Har
vard University had agreed that he
might stay on here to serve out his
council presidency.
Moynihan dated his letter of resig
nation last Saturday and said it was the
last day of his leave from teaching
duties at Harvard.
"It is time to return to teaching," he
wrote, "and such are the conditions of
my tenure that I return now,or not at
all."
Ford's letter formally accepting the
resignation was dated yesterday.
Served as ambassador
Moynihan had served the Ford ad
ministration earlier as ambassador to
India.
The latest of several flaps involving
Moynihan came last week after he sent
a controversial cablegram to Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger and U.S. em
bassies complaining about lack of
support for his effort to break up an

anti-American voting bloc at the world
organization.
Words of praise from Ford and Kis
singer last Wednesday appeared at the
time to have smoothed things over.
'Successful'
Last week Moynihan had main
tained that he had been successful in
efforts aimed "at breaking up the mas
sive bloc of nations, which for so long
have been arrayed against us in inter
national forums and in diplomatic en
counters generally."
He said in the same cablegram that
he feared a large faction in the State
Department "which has an interest in
our performance being judged to have
failed." He said this faction had leaked
its assessment to news media and
Congress.
White House Press Secretary Ron
Nessen told reporters that Ford had no
advance notice that Moynihan was

sending the letter of resignation. Nes
sen indicated a successor would be
named soon.
Just last Wednesday, after a
Moynihan-authored criticism of un
named State Department officials was
leaked to reporters, Nessen had said:
Moynihan"is supported by the Pres
ident, the secretary of state and the top
officials of the State Department."
Kissinger said at the time there had
been some criticism of Moynihan's
outspoken approach to U.S. diplo
macy within the department, but he
dismissed them.
There were reports in late November
that the outspoken Moynihan
would quit the U.N. post. He
scheduled and later abruptly cancel
led a news conference Nov. 21, telling
reporters: "1 am not leaving right
away."

Harvard
Although his resignation was effec
tive immediately, Moynihan said Har
vard University had agreed that he
might stay on here to serve out his
council presidency.
Moynihan dated his letter of resig
nation last Saturday and said it was the
last day of his leave from teaching
duties at Harvard.
"It is time to return to teaching," he
wrote, "and such are the conditions of
my tenure that I return now,or not at
all."
Ford's letter formally accepting the
resignation was dated yesterday.
Served as ambassador
Moynihan had served the Ford ad
ministration earlier as ambassador to
India.
The latest of several flaps involving
Moynihan came last week after he sent
a controversial cablegram to Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger and U.S. em
bassies complaining about lack of
support for his effort to break up an

anti-American voting bloc at the world
organization.
Words of praise from Ford and Kis
singer last Wednesday appeared at the
time to have smoothed things over.
'Successful'
Last week Moynihan had main
tained that he had been successful in
efforts aimed "at breaking up the mas
sive bloc of nations, which for so long
have been arrayed against us in inter
national forums and in diplomatic en
counters generally."
He said in the same cablegram that
he feared a large faction in the State
Department "which has an interest in
our performance being judged to have
failed." He said this faction had leaked
its assessment to news media and
Congress.
White House Press Secretary Ron
Nessen told reporters that Ford had no
advance notice that Moynihan was

sending the letter of resignation. Nes
sen indicated a successor would be
named soon.
Just last Wednesday, after a
Moynihan-authored criticism of un
named State Department officials was
leaked to reporters, Nessen had said:
Moynihan"is supported by the Pres
ident, the secretary of state and the top
officials of the State Department."
Kissinger said at the time there had
been some criticism of Moynihan's
outspoken approach to U.S. diplo
macy within the department, but he
dismissed them.
There were reports in late November
that the outspoken Moynihan
would quit the U.N. post. He
scheduled and later abruptly cancel
led a news conference Nov. 21, telling
reporters: "1 am not leaving right
away."
WASHINGTON (AP) — Daniel
Moynihan, who has been embroiled in
controversy since becoming U.S. am
bassador to the United Nations last
year, resigned yesterday, telling Presi
dent Ford: "It is time to return to teach
ing."
In a letter of reply, Ford accepted the
resignation "with the deepest regret
and reluctance," declaring that
Moynihan had "asserted our position
forcefully, cogently and honestly" at
the United Nations.
Moynihan told reporters at the Un
ited Nations, "I assume I'll be back in
government one way or other some
day. I'm going back to teaching now."
He seemed to rule out an early race for
the U.S. Senate.
