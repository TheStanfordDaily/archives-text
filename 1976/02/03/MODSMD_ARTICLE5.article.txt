# Profs: Moynihan, Kissinger clashed
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN MARC STRASSMAN 
Daniel Moynihan's resignation as
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations
sparked speculation about his rela
tionships with Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger and -analysis of his
tactics by University professors.
Thomas Pettigrew, visiting fellow at
the Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences and sociology
professor at Harvard, said "I'm not
surprised," and added that he knew
Moynihan "and the secretary of state
had been at odds for some time."
Pettigrew commented that the
statesmen differed in their policies
toward the third world, Moynihan
having been sensitized by his tenure as
U.S. ambassador to India and coming
back with a more negative attitude to
ward the third world.
St. Clair Drake, anthropology pro
fessor, was not surprised at the resig
nation either. "Moynihan carried over
into his relation with Third World
peoples (at the U.N.) the same ki nd of
attitudes that he'd developed in deal
ing with third world people" in the
United States.
"Those attitudes included a certain
amount of contempt for the opinions of
others and a cavalier attitude toward
those who disagree with him," said
Drake. He added, "I hope that those
who opposed the protest against his
speaking here last June will now un
derstand better the reasons for our op
position."
Attitude of contempt
Drake implied that it was Moyni
han's long-standing attitudes of con
tempt for the Third World, attitudes
motivating opposition to his speaking

here, which eventually led to his res
ignation.
Drake added, "For a professor, he's
shown a surprising inability to und
erstand the legitimate national aspira
tions of developing nations."
The anthropologist does not expect
any great changes in American policy
toward the Third World as a result of
Moynihan's departure from the U.N.
Commitment to Israel
Both Drake and Petti grew com
mented on the intensity and sincerity
of Moynihan's commitment to Israel, a
point of contention between Moyni
han and Kissinger, who seems to favor
a more flexible policy in the Middle
East.
Both Drake and Pettigrew attribute
this position to Moynihan's closeness
to the New York Jewish intellectual
community, which is represented by.
among other things, Commentary
magazine, where Moynihanpublished
the article "The United States in Op
position." In the article, he outlined a
get-tough-with-t he-Third-World policy
that many observers cite as a principal
reason for his originally getting the
U.N. job.
Assoc. History Prof. Barton Berns
tein, characterizing Moynihan's style
as "indelicate" and "impolitic," em
phasized that the "politics of confron
tation" was "not the best way to im
prove relations" between the U.S. and
Third World countries.
However, Bernstein noted. some
feel it is "necessary to remind other
countries that they're dependent on
the United States."
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Robert
Keohane, commenting about Moyni
ban's "flair in his job." said that it's
"very easy to overrate the impact of
what the U.S. ambassador says at the
U.N.," noting that the ambassador
does not make the country's policy.
"What is said by Moynihan is not
nearly as important as newspapers and
television make it seem," Keohane
said.
He admitted mixed reactions to the
former ambassador's demeanor. It is
"very desirable for the U.S. ambas
sador to be outspoken" about some is
sues, but "Moynihan has a tendency to
attack issues with a broad brush,"
Keohane said.
Political future
Speculation was mildly rampant
that Moynihan would now run for the
U.S. Senate from New York. Opinion

was divided on his chances.
Drake said he thought that his resig
nation. coming as it did on the heels if
expression of support from Presidei t
Ford and Kissinger, was a grandstand
play that would yield him a ceriain
amount of political capital.
His record on racial issues
massive support from the black com
munity. important in New York
Democratic politics, unlikely. Drake
said.
Jewish support
His outspoken support of Israel at
the U.N., however, has greatly en
deared him to the Jewish community,
which is also a powerful element in
Empire State politics. Drake added. 1
And being Irish Catholic, he can ex
pect a certain amount of their support.

Daniel Moynihan's resignation as
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations
sparked speculation about his rela
tionships with Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger and -analysis of his
tactics by University professors.
Thomas Pettigrew, visiting fellow at
the Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences and sociology
professor at Harvard, said "I'm not
surprised," and added that he knew
Moynihan "and the secretary of state
had been at odds for some time."
Pettigrew commented that the
statesmen differed in their policies
toward the third world, Moynihan
having been sensitized by his tenure as
U.S. ambassador to India and coming
back with a more negative attitude to
ward the third world.
St. Clair Drake, anthropology pro
fessor, was not surprised at the resig
nation either. "Moynihan carried over
into his relation with Third World
peoples (at the U.N.) the same ki nd of
attitudes that he'd developed in deal
ing with third world people" in the
United States.
"Those attitudes included a certain
amount of contempt for the opinions of
others and a cavalier attitude toward
those who disagree with him," said
Drake. He added, "I hope that those
who opposed the protest against his
speaking here last June will now un
derstand better the reasons for our op
position."
Attitude of contempt
Drake implied that it was Moyni
han's long-standing attitudes of con
tempt for the Third World, attitudes
motivating opposition to his speaking

here, which eventually led to his res
ignation.
Drake added, "For a professor, he's
shown a surprising inability to und
erstand the legitimate national aspira
tions of developing nations."
The anthropologist does not expect
any great changes in American policy
toward the Third World as a result of
Moynihan's departure from the U.N.
Commitment to Israel
Both Drake and Petti grew com
mented on the intensity and sincerity
of Moynihan's commitment to Israel, a
point of contention between Moyni
han and Kissinger, who seems to favor
a more flexible policy in the Middle
East.
Both Drake and Pettigrew attribute
this position to Moynihan's closeness
to the New York Jewish intellectual
community, which is represented by.
among other things, Commentary
magazine, where Moynihanpublished
the article "The United States in Op
position." In the article, he outlined a
get-tough-with-t he-Third-World policy
that many observers cite as a principal
reason for his originally getting the
U.N. job.
Assoc. History Prof. Barton Berns
tein, characterizing Moynihan's style
as "indelicate" and "impolitic," em
phasized that the "politics of confron
tation" was "not the best way to im
prove relations" between the U.S. and
Third World countries.
However, Bernstein noted. some
feel it is "necessary to remind other
countries that they're dependent on
the United States."
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Robert
Keohane, commenting about Moyni
ban's "flair in his job." said that it's
"very easy to overrate the impact of
what the U.S. ambassador says at the
U.N.," noting that the ambassador
does not make the country's policy.
"What is said by Moynihan is not
nearly as important as newspapers and
television make it seem," Keohane
said.
He admitted mixed reactions to the
former ambassador's demeanor. It is
"very desirable for the U.S. ambas
sador to be outspoken" about some is
sues, but "Moynihan has a tendency to
attack issues with a broad brush,"
Keohane said.
Political future
Speculation was mildly rampant
that Moynihan would now run for the
U.S. Senate from New York. Opinion

was divided on his chances.
Drake said he thought that his resig
nation. coming as it did on the heels if
expression of support from Presidei t
Ford and Kissinger, was a grandstand
play that would yield him a ceriain
amount of political capital.
His record on racial issues
massive support from the black com
munity. important in New York
Democratic politics, unlikely. Drake
said.
Jewish support
His outspoken support of Israel at
the U.N., however, has greatly en
deared him to the Jewish community,
which is also a powerful element in
Empire State politics. Drake added. 1
And being Irish Catholic, he can ex
pect a certain amount of their support.
Drake said.
