# Transit official says
## Santa Clara County bus service may end 
### MARC STRASSMAN 
All bus and transit services in Santa Clara County, in
cluding routes to and from the University, may be discon
tinued after July 1 of next year if the Santa Clara County
Transit District Referendum imposing a one-half cent
sales tax increase is defeated March 2.
Larry Nicholas, supervising transportation services rep
resentative of the county's transportation district, added
that if the referendum passes, it could generate over $116
million in additional funds to be used for improvements
on the system.
Andrew Doty, director of community relations for the
University, said that if the proposed sales tax is not pas
sed, the University will not useanyofits funds toaugment
mass transit in the area.
"The University is willing to cooperate as fully as itcan
but it is reluctant to make contributions of educational
funds to help out," he said.
PAMTRANS
If the sales tax is approved, funds collected would be
used to implement parts of the Palo Alto-Menlo Park-
Stanford Transportation Project (PAMTRANS).
Under PAMTRANS, three more bus lines would be ad
ded. the campus lines augmenting existing routes that
now run on Palm Drive and through the medical center.
The new lines would be known as the Major Activities
Route (Fmbarcadero), the Middle Avenue Route out of
Menlo Park and the Junipero Serra Route, which would
link up to Campus Drive.
Nicholas stressed the importance of the measure for the
entire future of the Santa Clara Valley: "There are really
only two ways we can meet ourgrowing transportation
needs: (to) build more roads, with all the attendent con
gestion, pollution and environmental degradation (to)
construct a comprehensive, multi-modal system of mass
transit, including light-rail components.
"If we do nothing we can expect absolute chaos further

down the road. Anything we don't do now will cost much
more later," he explained.
According to Nicholas, the tax itself would produce
$14.1 million. This amount, along with $11.9 million col
lected from fares, could be used over a five-year period to
secure matching grants from the federal govenment.
Federal money would consist of $4.3 million in capital
grants and $29.8 million in operating grants under the
Urban Mass Transit Administration (UMTA) programs. A
grant by the state would provide an additional $56.3 mill
ion.
The total $116 million would be used, according to
Nicholas, to increase the current bus fleet from 236 to 516.
Additional funds
Additional funds would also be used to expand mainte
nance facilities, including the construction of a North
County Coach Yard in Mountain View. All of these pro
jects will benefit the community through new construc
tion and additional jobs. Nicholas said.
Doty explained that commuters would be major benfac
tors if PAMTRANS is implimented. He suggested that the
plan would reduce traffic congestion in Palo Alto around
the University.
Doty estimated that the daytime population of the Uni
versity at around 40.000 persons and the nighttime popu
lation at roughly 10,000 persons. The difference of 30,000
is the number of persons who commute to and from the
University each day.he said.
A University study indicated that over half the daily
vehicle trips in Palo Alto are to and from places of work.
PAMTRANS would provide expanded public transporta
tion which would reduce traffic, he noted.
A simple majority in the election March 2 will be suffi
cient for the measure to pass. It will appear as Measure A
on the ballot.
Also on the ballot will be Measure B. which will ask
voters to decide if they will want the tax to be resubmitted
for approval after five years.

All bus and transit services in Santa Clara County, in
cluding routes to and from the University, may be discon
tinued after July 1 of next year if the Santa Clara County
Transit District Referendum imposing a one-half cent
sales tax increase is defeated March 2.
Larry Nicholas, supervising transportation services rep
resentative of the county's transportation district, added
that if the referendum passes, it could generate over $116
million in additional funds to be used for improvements
on the system.
Andrew Doty, director of community relations for the
University, said that if the proposed sales tax is not pas
sed, the University will not useanyofits funds toaugment
mass transit in the area.
"The University is willing to cooperate as fully as itcan
but it is reluctant to make contributions of educational
funds to help out," he said.
PAMTRANS
If the sales tax is approved, funds collected would be
used to implement parts of the Palo Alto-Menlo Park-
Stanford Transportation Project (PAMTRANS).
Under PAMTRANS, three more bus lines would be ad
ded. the campus lines augmenting existing routes that
now run on Palm Drive and through the medical center.
The new lines would be known as the Major Activities
Route (Fmbarcadero), the Middle Avenue Route out of
Menlo Park and the Junipero Serra Route, which would
link up to Campus Drive.
Nicholas stressed the importance of the measure for the
entire future of the Santa Clara Valley: "There are really
only two ways we can meet ourgrowing transportation
needs: (to) build more roads, with all the attendent con
gestion, pollution and environmental degradation (to)
construct a comprehensive, multi-modal system of mass
transit, including light-rail components.
"If we do nothing we can expect absolute chaos further

down the road. Anything we don't do now will cost much
more later," he explained.
According to Nicholas, the tax itself would produce
$14.1 million. This amount, along with $11.9 million col
lected from fares, could be used over a five-year period to
secure matching grants from the federal govenment.
Federal money would consist of $4.3 million in capital
grants and $29.8 million in operating grants under the
Urban Mass Transit Administration (UMTA) programs. A
grant by the state would provide an additional $56.3 mill
ion.
The total $116 million would be used, according to
Nicholas, to increase the current bus fleet from 236 to 516.
Additional funds
Additional funds would also be used to expand mainte
nance facilities, including the construction of a North
County Coach Yard in Mountain View. All of these pro
jects will benefit the community through new construc
tion and additional jobs. Nicholas said.
Doty explained that commuters would be major benfac
tors if PAMTRANS is implimented. He suggested that the
plan would reduce traffic congestion in Palo Alto around
the University.
Doty estimated that the daytime population of the Uni
versity at around 40.000 persons and the nighttime popu
lation at roughly 10,000 persons. The difference of 30,000
is the number of persons who commute to and from the
University each day.he said.
A University study indicated that over half the daily
vehicle trips in Palo Alto are to and from places of work.
PAMTRANS would provide expanded public transporta
tion which would reduce traffic, he noted.
A simple majority in the election March 2 will be suffi
cient for the measure to pass. It will appear as Measure A
on the ballot.
Also on the ballot will be Measure B. which will ask
voters to decide if they will want the tax to be resubmitted
for approval after five years.
