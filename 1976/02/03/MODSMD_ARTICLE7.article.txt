## editorial Student justice 
### 
Last April, students narrowly voted to accept the
compromise plan of the Committee of 15 (C-15) for a
new Student Judicial Council (SJC) to replace the
Campus Judicial Panel.
By a vote of 769 to 635, with more than 1000 abstain
ing, students approved the C-15's proposal, and this
fall, the SJC became the official University trial board
for students.
The vote last April seemingly ended years of debate
on the student judicial system. But the C-15's com
promise proposal fell far short of what students here
had demanded and fought bitterly for — a permanent
student majority on the jury that judges student defen
dants.
We opposed last year's proposal on two grounds:
—first, the lack of a student majority on the SJCin all
cases, including Honor Code violations;
—second, the inequity in the panel selection proce
dures which forces students to be chosen at random
while allowing faculty members to be hand-picked.
We remain opposed to the SJC for these reasons.
Since our initial editorial and the April ballot, sev
eral new problems with the SJC have become apparent.
Even the student chairman of the panel commented
this year that there are a number of "loopholes in the
official charter" of the judicial body.
We note President Richard Lyman and the ASSU
Council of Presidents have called on the Student Con
duct Legislative Council to review the Honor Code.
However, we believe a corresponding review of the
SJC is at least as important.
We therefore call on Lyman to reconvene the C-15 to
assist the current members of the SJC in overhauling
the SJC — and in adding some justice to the student
judicial system.
