# Budget problems

Stanford is in the middle of a
four year budget adjustment
program designed to achieve
budget equilibrium by 1979-80.
Budget equilibrium is a state
where increases in University
expenditures are matched by an
equal increased in income.
According to the latest calcu
lation, a $10 million gap will
have to be eliminated if Stan
ford's expenditures and income
are to be equal and yearly de
ficits avoided.
Forty percent of this gap was
closed last year and those budget
reductions were put into effect
this academic year.
According to the planners of
this policy, there are three vari
ables involved in budget
equilibrium:
—the rate of the tuition in
crease;
—the rate of salary increase for
faculty and staff; and
—the rate of net new expendi
tures for innovation and im
provement, including mainte
nance ai
Tuition increase
Tuition will increase at a rate
of 12.2 percent until 1980, with
projected tuition for that year
being $6036.
Until 1980, staff and faculty
salaries will be increased at a
rate even with inflation.
It has been decided a certain
number of new program initia
tives and other new expendi
tures will be needed each year.
Included in this category are op
erations and maintenance of
new buildings.
Previously amounts allocated
for these improvements had
been three percent of the previ
ous year's budget base.
For the present until 1980, the
University plans on an annual
increase of one percent of the
budget base for net new expendi
ture on improvements plus any
increase necessary for overhead
and maintenance of new build
ings.
Tradeoffs
The tuition increase above in
flation (planned to be 4.1 per
cent) is directly attributable to
the University's plan to maintain
faculty-staff purchasing power
and provide a funded improve
ment increment in the budget.
Previously the University
planned to maintain tuition in
creases at a rate no greater than
the percentage increase in na
tional family income. This is no
longer the case.
One alternative to a regular
double-digit tuition increase
would be lowering faculty-staff
salary increases. Small changes
in overall salary policy would
have very large effects on the
budget gap and equilibrium he-

cause salaries and benefits pre
sently account for some 67 per
cent of Stanford's operating
budget.
It must be conceded that
faculty-staff quality is
threatened if a wage disparity
between other employers and
Stanford grows too large.
The question arises whether
tuition is the only feasible source
of funding for the annual im
provement increase.
Perhaps an alternative would
be to have faculty and staff help
pay for funded improvements.
Other critics have suggested
that improvements be made sol
ely through gifts and grants.
The future
Many other alternatives and
suggestion have been put for
ward as ways around this prob
lem.
Unfortunately for students,
the decision to seek and main
tain long term budget equilib
rium through tuition increases,
rather than faculty-staff purchas
ing power decreases or a reduc
tion in funded improvements,
has already been made.
If budget equilibrium is main
tained in the manner reported
here, tuition will be around
$8000 by 1990 and the total cost
of a Stanford education will ap
proach $60,000 (in 1975 dollars).
Student course of action
As students, there is little we
can do to avoid the present tui
tion increases. The hike is the
unavoidable product of the
equilibrium plan the University
has chosen.
Future large increases will fol
low unless the University mod
ifies its plan.
Student lobbying for such a
change is ineffectual as long as
student opinions are unwelcome
at the central budget decision
making level. More productive
would be channeling student
energy into other areas.
One course would be in
creased student input into the
budget making process at the
departmental level.
More importantly, student in
terest dictates a careful scrutiny
of Stanford as an educational in
stitution. As tuition spirals, the
quality of undergraduate educa
tion must be outstanding if Stan
ford is to remain competitive.
Whether Stanford is an out
standing institution for under
graduate education and what
improvements can and should
be made in the undergraduate
experience are questions stu
dents should focus their atten
tion on.

Stanford is in the middle of a
four year budget adjustment
program designed to achieve
budget equilibrium by 1979-80.
Budget equilibrium is a state
where increases in University
expenditures are matched by an
equal increased in income.
According to the latest calcu
lation, a $10 million gap will
have to be eliminated if Stan
ford's expenditures and income
are to be equal and yearly de
ficits avoided.
Forty percent of this gap was
closed last year and those budget
reductions were put into effect
this academic year.
According to the planners of
this policy, there are three vari
ables involved in budget
equilibrium:
—the rate of the tuition in
crease;
—the rate of salary increase for
faculty and staff; and
—the rate of net new expendi
tures for innovation and im
provement, including mainte
nance ai
Tuition increase
Tuition will increase at a rate
of 12.2 percent until 1980, with
projected tuition for that year
being $6036.
Until 1980, staff and faculty
salaries will be increased at a
rate even with inflation.
It has been decided a certain
number of new program initia
tives and other new expendi
tures will be needed each year.
Included in this category are op
erations and maintenance of
new buildings.
Previously amounts allocated
for these improvements had
been three percent of the previ
ous year's budget base.
For the present until 1980, the
University plans on an annual
increase of one percent of the
budget base for net new expendi
ture on improvements plus any
increase necessary for overhead
and maintenance of new build
ings.
Tradeoffs
The tuition increase above in
flation (planned to be 4.1 per
cent) is directly attributable to
the University's plan to maintain
faculty-staff purchasing power
and provide a funded improve
ment increment in the budget.
Previously the University
planned to maintain tuition in
creases at a rate no greater than
the percentage increase in na
tional family income. This is no
longer the case.
One alternative to a regular
double-digit tuition increase
would be lowering faculty-staff
salary increases. Small changes
in overall salary policy would
have very large effects on the
budget gap and equilibrium he-

cause salaries and benefits pre
sently account for some 67 per
cent of Stanford's operating
budget.
It must be conceded that
faculty-staff quality is
threatened if a wage disparity
between other employers and
Stanford grows too large.
The question arises whether
tuition is the only feasible source
of funding for the annual im
provement increase.
Perhaps an alternative would
be to have faculty and staff help
pay for funded improvements.
Other critics have suggested
that improvements be made sol
ely through gifts and grants.
The future
Many other alternatives and
suggestion have been put for
ward as ways around this prob
lem.
Unfortunately for students,
the decision to seek and main
tain long term budget equilib
rium through tuition increases,
rather than faculty-staff purchas
ing power decreases or a reduc
tion in funded improvements,
has already been made.
If budget equilibrium is main
tained in the manner reported
here, tuition will be around
$8000 by 1990 and the total cost
of a Stanford education will ap
proach $60,000 (in 1975 dollars).
Student course of action
As students, there is little we
can do to avoid the present tui
tion increases. The hike is the
unavoidable product of the
equilibrium plan the University
has chosen.
Future large increases will fol
low unless the University mod
ifies its plan.
Student lobbying for such a
change is ineffectual as long as
student opinions are unwelcome
at the central budget decision
making level. More productive
would be channeling student
energy into other areas.
One course would be in
creased student input into the
budget making process at the
departmental level.
More importantly, student in
terest dictates a careful scrutiny
of Stanford as an educational in
stitution. As tuition spirals, the
quality of undergraduate educa
tion must be outstanding if Stan
ford is to remain competitive.
Whether Stanford is an out

low unless the University mod
ifies its plan.
Student lobbying for such a
change is ineffectual as long as
student opinions are unwelcome
at the central budget decision
making level. More productive
would be channeling student
energy into other areas.
One course would be in
creased student input into the
budget making process at the
departmental level.
More importantly, student in
terest dictates a careful scrutiny
of Stanford as an educational in
stitution. As tuition spirals, the
quality of undergraduate educa
tion must be outstanding if Stan
ford is to remain competitive.
Whether Stanford is an out
standing institution for under
graduate education and what
improvements can and should
be made in the undergraduate
experience are questions stu
dents should focus their atten
tion on.
