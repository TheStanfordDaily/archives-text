# Effective CIA needs secrecy
## 
### 
Recent revelations of CIA activity in An
gola present a very real problem for Ameri
can foreign policy makers. Exposure of the
CIA has deprived the President of an impor
tant and flexible tool for promoting Ameri
can interests abroad.
Of course, it is true that the public has a
right to know Ameica's foreign policy ac
tions. By exposing American involvement
in Angola, Congress is informing the pub
lic.
But Congress is also informing the Rus
sians and third world. If CIA involvement
were to continue (an unlikely prospect, in
light of the Tunney Amendment), the
Soviets could argue that the white racists of
South Africa have been replaced by the
white imperialists of America.
This gives the Russians a very valuable
propaganda tool, while it also neutralizes
the CIA. Any CIA involvement would be
painted by the Soviets as just another exam
ple of American imperialism at work.
American interests
It is also true that are American in
terests at stake in Angola. If the Popular
Movement (MPLA) wins, it will owe a great
deal to theUSSÃŸ,because the MPLA would
not be able to win without Russian aid.
Before the massive increases in Soviet aid
to the MPLA, the two pro-Western factions
in the country were winning. But the
Soviets gave the MPLA the battlefield ad
vantage by airlifting in millions of dollars in
arms and persuading Fidel Castro to com
mit Cuban troops as repayment on the $5.4
billion in aid that the Soviets have given
Cuba since 1960.
Because of this massive Soviet effort, the
pro-Western forces are crumbling before the
onslaught of the MPLA. The pro-Western
groups now say they favor a coalition gov

erment, but it is unlikely the MPLA will
compromise, with victory so close.
In return for the aid it has received
from Russia, upon assuming power, the
MPLA would likely allow the Soviet Union
to build a naval base at Tiger Bay, an ideal
deep-water port.
Oil tankers
From this base, Soviet ships could, in
times of crisis, intercept oil tankers as they
come around the Cape of Good Hope from
the Persian Gulf, thereby cutting off the

West's primary source of oil.
Unfortunately, there is nothing America
can do about this threat. The option of
covert aid to Angola has been foreclosed,
and open American aid would be counter
productive.
If American aid were stepped up, the
Soviets could use that fact to rally the Afri
can nations against the "yankee imperialist
threat." Enough Africans might be per
suaded of this to enable the MPLA to be
come the only representative of Angola in
the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
In addition, some African nations might
be convinced that the MPLA deserves addi
tional aid from their coffers. Already, 22 of
the 46 nations in the OAU recognize the
MPLA, many because of South African aid

to the other two factions.
If American aid were overtly increased,
African objections to Soviet intervention in
the war would be overridden and the USSR
would depict itself as the defender of the
oppressed against American exploitation,
thereby persuading more nations to recog
nize and aid the MPLA.
America would soon find itself indi
rectly involved in a protracted war on a hos
tile continent. The prophecy of Angola be
coming another Vietnam would be fulfil led.
All of this will have occurred because of
congressional exposure of the CIA in An
gola. This scenario demonstrates that, in
some cases, public knowledge of American
involvement abroad can be used to thwart
American interests.
The CIA, then, is a valuable tool that can
be used to promote American interests in
delicate international situations. A perma
nent end to covert operations would have
detrimental effects on American foreign
policy in areas far more important than An
gola.
Press leaks
Strong congressional interference in CIA
activities seems inevitable, along with ac
companying leaks to the press. If Congress
must regulate the CIA, let it be done in
closed sessions, so there is at least a chance
the organization will remain a valuable tool
in foreign policy implementation.
Paradoxically, secrecy is sometimes the
best way to protect freedom. Concessions to
democratic principles should not be al
lowed to undermine America's role in
promoting those principles.
