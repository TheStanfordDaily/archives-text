Helmet laws
Editor:
I agree with Engineering-
Economics Systems Prof. Ronald
Howard's comments in his Jan.
19 Daily letter on the undesira
bility of a compulsory helmet
law. I too feel it is wrong for the
government to impose legisla-

tion that robs an individual of
his freedom of choice.
Those in favor of such a hel
met law are concerned with the
fact that despite conclusive evi
dence showing the effectiveness
of a helmet in reducing serious
head injury, some riders still
choose not to wear a helmet.
Frequently, however, a rider's

choice is influenced by
economic considerations; he
doesn't want to pay for a good
helmet.
Instead of working for a law
which violates personal free
dom, those concerned with
motorcycle safety should work
towards legislation which
would require a federally ap
proved safety helmet (able to
pass a stringent safety standards
test) as a part of a motorcycle's
standard equipment.
By insuring that motorcycle
buyers are supplied with a qual
ity helmet, compulsory helmet
law advocates could rest assured
that when an individual makes a
decision on whether or not to
wear a helmet, he would be
doing so without having
economic considerations affect
his decision.
If one examines the 1972 seat
belt laws which require all new
cars to be equipped with safety
approved seat belts, one sees
such legislation isn't exactly
new.

Performance of COP
Editor:
I read with great interest
"Campus politicos debate COP
aims" (Daily, fan. 16). Unfortu
nately, I find myself as confused

now as I was when I first encoun
tered the "COP-as-facilitator"
model in last spring's campaign
rhetoric.
I contend an effective Council
of Presidents (COP) can't wait for
requests for . . help from the
COP if students want it." Unless
things have changed drastically
from my days at Stanford, the
COP costs students too much to
sit up in the rarified heights of
Tresidder and facilitate.
If programs such as SWOPSI
and SCIRE are more important
than the Lecture Note Service, as
COP member Charlotte Cermane
claims, what programs are re
ceiving the attention and action
which she says "speaks louder
than words"?
The only priority left appears
to be helping students . . cut
the administration's red tape,"
according to ASSU President
Lee Rosenbaum. I hope that red
tape doesn't obscure the
"...long range ideas" which
Rosenbaum says "aren't going to
get done this year but have been
made possible for a future COP."
I agree with Rosenbaum's
claim that the current COP dif
fers from past administrations in
its concern for long-range ideas.
But let's not have this concern at
the expense of programs that re
spond to current needs.
I'm confident the current
council will find that the better
it gets at solving small problems,
the smaller the large ones will

become.

University attitude
Editor:
Regarding the advertisement
in the Jan. 28 Daily: "ATTEN
TION WOMEN STUDENTS:
Seven Courageous Adminis
trators Will Answer Your Ques
tions And Take Suggestions On
How to Improve Services To
Women Students," I strongly re
sent the use of the word
"courageous."
Does it really take that much
"courage" for this university to
attempt to meet the needs of its
female students? Or must de
mands or suggestions made by
woman students always be seen
as unreasonable, aggressive, ex
traordinarv and maybe just plain
laughable?
