# African expert must answer for Angola

The announcement by the Af
rican Studies Committee that
Asst. Secretary of State for Afri
can Affairs William Schaufele
will take part in a Feb. 14 sym
posium on Angola, refers to
Schaufele as having recently re
turned from a "tour" of five Afri
can countries. This was not a
fact-finding mission.
According to the New York
Times, Schaufele visited Africa
in December in order to obtain
support for the U.S. position in

Angola. His trip was "designed
to block recognition of the Popu
lar Movement government
(MPLA) by the Organization of
African Unity (OAU)."
The OAU, which met in mid-
January, deadlocked on the issue
of support for the MPLA, possi
bly as a result of Sec. of State
Henry Kissinger's timely an
nouncement that African coun
tries which voted against the Un
ited States in international
forums would be denied U.S. aid
in the future.
Schaufele undoubtedly con
veyed this message on his recent
trip.
In any case he was in no need
of an orientation tour.
Schaufele has served the State
Department in several African
countries, most notably as
officer-in-charge in the Congo,
where massive CIA intervention
brought Mobutu Sese Seko to
power in the 19605. (Seko, to
whom Kissinger now proposes
to give $82 million in aid, is the
chief conduit of military aid to
pro-West factions in Angola.)
Schaufele was promoted to his
present job in December after his
predecessor resigned "in dis

gust" over U.S. intervention in
Angola on the same side as
South Africa.
Since Schaufele will be on
campus to defend the Ford-
Kissinger policy of preventing
the MPLA from governing An
gola, he should be asked some
hard questions. These might in
clude:
—The MPLA has been fight
ing for independence from Por
tugal since 1956. During that
time the United States refused its
requests for help and instead
supplied massive military aid to
the Portuguese dictatorships of
Salazar and Caetano.
—Now that Angolans have fi
nally won their independence,
what right do we have to inter
vene in their affairs?
—Kissinger has asserted the
United States only became con
cerned with Angola because of
Soviet and Cuban intervention.
Why did he approve arms ship
ments to the pro-West factions
well before the Russians and Cu
bans became heavily involved
militarily?
—Congress has explicitly and
overwhelmingly voted its op
position to using U.S. funds for

military aid to Angola. By what
right, then, could a high U.S. of
ficial announce to the press
"We're going to keep . . . up" the
sending of arms to anti-MPLA
forces and refuse to tell where
the necessary money will come
from? <1
—Why does the United States
persist in ignoring repeated
statements by MPLA leaders
they will not become a puppet of
the Soviets and would welcome
closer ties with Western na
tions? Does the United States
oppose the MPLA simply be
cause it is socialist and will not
let the vast riches of Angola be
exploited by the West?
Finally, the central question
to ask Schaufele is: How long
can the U.S. continue to threaten
smaller nations, humiliate their
leaders, intervene covertly in
their affairs and pour arms into
local wars, without becoming
the most hated country in the
world? Does Kissinger's deter
mination to commit American
power and prestige in such
dubious ways really serve
national interest?

Angola on the same side as
South Africa.
Since Schaufele will be on
campus to defend the Ford-
Kissinger policy of preventing
the MPLA from governing An
gola, he should be asked some
hard questions. These might in
clude:
—The MPLA has been fight
ing for independence from Por
tugal since 1956. During that
time the United States refused its
requests for help and instead
supplied massive military aid to
the Portuguese dictatorships of
Salazar and Caetano.
—Now that Angolans have fi
nally won their independence,
what right do we have to inter
vene in their affairs?
—Kissinger has asserted the
United States only became con
cerned with Angola because of
Soviet and Cuban intervention.
Why did he approve arms ship
ments to the pro-West factions
well before the Russians and Cu
bans became heavily involved
militarily?
—Congress has explicitly and
overwhelmingly voted its op
position to using U.S. funds for

military aid to Angola. By what
right, then, could a high U.S. of
ficial announce to the press
"We're going to keep . . . up" the
sending of arms to anti-MPLA
forces and refuse to tell where
the necessary money will come
from? <1
—Why does the United States
persist in ignoring repeated
statements by MPLA leaders
they will not become a puppet of
the Soviets and would welcome
closer ties with Western na
tions? Does the United States
oppose the MPLA simply be
cause it is socialist and will not
let the vast riches of Angola be
exploited by the West?
Finally, the central question
to ask Schaufele is: How long
can the U.S. continue to threaten
smaller nations, humiliate their
leaders, intervene covertly in
their affairs and pour arms into
local wars, without becoming
the most hated country in the
world? Does Kissinger's deter
mination to commit American
power and prestige in such
dubious ways really serve
national interest?

The announcement by the Af
rican Studies Committee that
Asst. Secretary of State for Afri
can Affairs William Schaufele
will take part in a Feb. 14 sym
posium on Angola, refers to
Schaufele as having recently re
turned from a "tour" of five Afri
can countries. This was not a
fact-finding mission.
According to the New York
Times, Schaufele visited Africa
in December in order to obtain
support for the U.S. position in

Angola. His trip was "designed
to block recognition of the Popu
lar Movement government
(MPLA) by the Organization of
African Unity (OAU)."
The OAU, which met in mid-
January, deadlocked on the issue
of support for the MPLA, possi
bly as a result of Sec. of State
Henry Kissinger's timely an
nouncement that African coun
tries which voted against the Un
ited States in international
forums would be denied U.S. aid
in the future.
Schaufele undoubtedly con
veyed this message on his recent
trip.
In any case he was in no need
of an orientation tour.
Schaufele has served the State
Department in several African
countries, most notably as
officer-in-charge in the Congo,
where massive CIA intervention
brought Mobutu Sese Seko to
power in the 19605. (Seko, to
whom Kissinger now proposes
to give $82 million in aid, is the
chief conduit of military aid to
pro-West factions in Angola.)
Schaufele was promoted to his
present job in December after his
predecessor resigned "in dis

gust" over U.S. intervention in
Angola on the same side as
South Africa.
