# Required courses needed to raise learning, creativity

Consider a Beethoven or De
bussy: If there is great music to
console us in this world, it is be
cause sensitive spirits like those
two had piano lessons imposed
on them at a very tender age, had
the guts to accept that hard re
gime and, via a sublime "double
take," made the piano their own.
Our admiration for such souls is
as vast as our gratitude.
These are extreme cases, true,
but everything praiseworthy and
civilized has come about by a
large measure of acceptance of

such unpleasant realities. Why
then are so many of our youth
fearful of a few lousy Western
culture requirements? The lan.
26 Daily editorial says they make
students "chafe." Cood grief!
Is it possible that the last few
years have taught nothing to
those young'uns about childish
perfectionism, and one-sided
Utopian views of society and
education? Has the "new
realism" which most commen
tators see as characterizing the
great majority of Americans not
penetrated into academia?
A core curriculum, in such a
sober perspective, might make
the difference between Stanford
grads being on welfare or not.
But that is only part of the price
of our delinquency.
SAT decline
Surely some here have read
about the drastic fall in freshman
SAT scores since the core cur
riculum was abolished, and the
elimination of courses like Ger
man, Latin and Greek in the high
schools.
Do those high-minded youths
feel any moral responsibility for
their kid brothers and sisters
coming up through the secon
dary system? Or all those who
can't write or read? And what of
the future of our country?
Do they not see any connec
tion — our Dean of Admissions,
Fred Hargadon, does — between
those sad results and our defec
tion here?
In this context, it is discourag
ing to note theself-indulgence of
being "free to follow his/her own
desires" as mentioned in Rosen
baum el nl.'s Jan. 27 Daily col
umn.
Glorious waves
The most glorious waves of
creativity emerged from coun
tries like France which had ex
tremely prescribed educational

regimes until recently when,
mirabi/e dictu, the waves have
practically stopped.
Also the general level ofintel
ligence in countries like France
was plain to see and hear. Even
in my time in America we had to
swallow stiff amounts of re
quired stuff, up through grad
school, and 1 consider that to
have been among the valuable
aspects of my training.
But hell's bells, we are talking
about a measly Western civ,
course or two! Even that is too
much for some delicate contem
porary stomachs. So we have to
use sugar-coating formulas like
"appeal to people" and that in
credible "Honors" ploy (here
Rosenbaum, et al. are convinc
ing)-
Fill to the gills
A full core curriculum takes
up less than 25 percent of a stu
dent's program, and he has the
rest of the time to fill himself to
the gills with everything his
heart desires from sex education
to archery.
It is utterly fallacious to argue
that the quality of learning goes
down with requirements, when
recent history shows us that the
absolute contrary is true. Sure,
some people are bored in re
quired classes (aside from the
usual contingent of generally
bored students and teachers) but
the point is the payoff comes la
ter.
Required courses raise the
general level partly by solid
grounding in fundamentals,
partly by dialectically whetting
the appetite for what one more
spontaneously prefers. But this
is the Now generation, fretful
and diffident about anything
other than instant delight.
The idea that semesters pre
clude "broader exposure" is
similarly shallow and arbitrary.
What about a little depth and
concentration for a change?
We're so "broadly exposed" al
ready in this feckless and chaotic
society that one end can hardly
lift the other. . . .

Consider a Beethoven or De

cause sensitive spirits like those

on them at a very tender age, had

Our admiration for such souls is

Is it possible that the last few

perfectionism, and one-sided

A core curriculum, in such a

SAT decline
Surely some here have read
about the drastic fall in freshman
SAT scores since the core cur
riculum was abolished, and the
elimination of courses like Ger
man, Latin and Greek in the high
schools.
Do those high-minded youths
feel any moral responsibility for
their kid brothers and sisters
coming up through the secon
dary system? Or all those who
can't write or read? And what of
the future of our country?
Do they not see any connec

Fred Hargadon, does — between
those sad results and our defec

In this context, it is discourag

The most glorious waves of

in my time in America we had to

But hell's bells, we are talking
about a measly Western civ,
