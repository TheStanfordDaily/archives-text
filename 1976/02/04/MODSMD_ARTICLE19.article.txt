I've never had an orgasm during intercourse. Is there something
wrong with me, or have my boyfriends been doing the wrong
things?
There are a lot of possible reasons for this situation. Two Cowell
Peer Counselors had these comments: First, it's not necessary to
have an orgasm to enjoy sex. So you shouldn't always be trying to
have one — just worrying about it too much could be keeping you
from climaxing. Relax, slow down, and don't try so hard. Let it
come naturally.
The problem could also be your partner's techniques or the
position you're in. If you'd prefer more forepiay or clitoral stimula
tion, tell him so. If you can masturbate to climax, perhaps showing
him how to do it will help things out.
You might also try intercourse sitting on top of your partner. You
can regulate speed and penetration to your satisfaction, and some
sources say it is easier for women to achieve orgasm in this posi
tion.
Sometimes I get stomach pains which come in the middle of my
menstrual cycle. What are they?
They are abdominal pains, and they're known as Mittelschmerz
(literally, "middle pain"), a cramping which some women (espe
cially younger women) get during ovulation. It can occur on either
or both sides of the abdomen, and is sometimes accompanied by
slight bleeding. Forum magazine says the cramps can vary from an
occasional twinge to several days of acute pain, and that the only
way to prevent them is to block ovulation. It would be a good idea to
check with your doctor if it is occuring. But be careful — according
4o Human Sexuality, doctors have been known to diagnose Mit
telschmerz as appendicitis.
