# Black cultural group to rename Olivo-Magnolia theme house
## 
### Stephen Carter 
Residents of the Black Cultural
Center, located in Olivo-Magnolia
house in Lagunita Court, plan to an
nounce a new name for the house
shortly after the middle of February,
according to sophomore David M.
Smith, an organizer of the move.
Smith said yesterday that he and
other black students in the center think
the name should be "more in keeping
with black culture. If not, why have it
(the center)?"
He is soliciting input from black and
white residents of the dorm, and from
"the rest of the black community" on a
new name.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton said he has not been presented
any detailed proposal. "I've only been
informed that there was some interest
in changing the name," he said.
"It's been about two weeks since the
idea was mentioned. We (the Office of
Residential Education) said fine, that
we would welcome input on it. That
was the last I heard of it,"said Horton
Horton said there is a "formal pro
cedure" for changing the name of the
dormitory, but added, "I don't know
exactly what it is."
Reflective name
He said that any new name "would
have to accurately reflect the program
that's there" in order to be acceptable
to the University. He noted that the last
three houses to change their names
were Casa Zapata and Mark Twain
house in Stern Hall, and Ham
marskjold House, all within the last
seven years.
Smith said that even if the administ
ration would not accept the new name,
"We would refer to it by the name cho
sen."
Smith and the residence staff are
asking residents and members of the
black community to select their top
three choices from the following list:

—Frederick Douglass, a formerslave
turned diplomat and presidential con
fidante in the late 19th century;
—St. Clair Drake, professor of an
thropology here and organizer of the
program in Afro-American studies;
—Marcus Garvey, who headed a
Caribbean-based "back to Africa"
movement in the 19205;
—Martin Luther King Jr., non
violent civil rights leader assassinated
in 1968;
—Patrice Lumumba, the former
premier of the Congo at the time it won
independence from Belgium;
—Kwame Nkrumah, the late presi
dent of Ghana;
—Paul Robeson, an award-winning
poet; and
—El Haji Malik Shabazz (Malcolm

X), the activist leader who was assas
sinated after turning against the Black
Muslims in the mid-19605.
Swahili
Also on the list are three Swahili
words: Harambee ("all pull together"),
Ujamaa ("familyhood") and Umoja
("unity").
Horton declined comment on
whetherthe University would find any
of these names unacceptable.
He said, however, that the Univer
sity would not accept a name without
evidence that the residents of the
house preferred it.
"I think all those names that are
down there should be acceptable,"
Smith said. He admitted, however,
that some whites might find some
names less acceptable than others.
