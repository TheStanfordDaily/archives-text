# CIA recruiters hit campuses

DENVER (PNS) — "Unique
employment opportunities, in
ternational travel, mystery, good
pay, many benefits — all yours
when working for this well es
tablished international corpora
tion."
Sound like a dream job?
It's the latest recruitment pitch
by the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) to college seniors
and graduate students across the
country.
And, usually, the only re
sponse from students — even on
campuses that were hostile to
the CIA during the Vietnam war
years — has been to beat down
the doors to get in for interviews
with recruiters.
According to CIA officials in
Washington, D.C., and in Bos
ton, student interest in working
for the agency is increasing.
A CIA-sponsored minority
hiring conference, held recently
in Washington, D.C., drew more
than 60 career counselors from
23 U.S. universities. All ex
penses were paid by the CIA.
Representatives from the Uni
versity of Michigan, UCLA, Uni
versity of Wisconsin, Michigan
State, and UC-Berkeley all came
to talk with the CIA about
employment opportunities.
A Michigan employment re
cruiter at the conference said the
campus would not recruit for the
CIA, but "encouraged the CIA to

come back to campus."
Most of the career placement
officials said it was their duty to
provide all possible employ
ment opportunities for students.
The ClA's pitch is simple. The
agency is playing down its role
in political murders, toppled
governments, underworld col
laborations and domestic spy
ing. The CIA is being billed as
just another government agency.
Students protests have beer,
scattered and ineffectual.
Demonstrations at Berkeley,
UCLA, Michigan and Michigan
State have produced no change
in campus recruitment policies.
But at UC-San Diego, Presi
dent David Saxon was forced to
leave the campus by police car
after anti-CIA recruitment.
Shortly after the disturbance,
the senate defeated a proposal
requiring full disclosure of
CIA-university connections,
which would have banned CIA
campus recruitment and stop
ped research by faculty members
for the agency.
The CIA, in advertisements,
makes a special pitch for Ph.D.
candidates doing research. The
agency offers one of the few op
portunities for employment in
research, sa'd Robert Cinri, as
sociate director of career place
ment at Harvard, with the oppor
tunity to publish "substantive
scholarly research" throughout

the intellectual and intelligence
community.
Cinn speculated that recent
publicity on the ClA's activities
actually helped recruitment ac
tivities because "it makes the
kids think about the agency."
Whatever illegal and corrupt
CIA actions may be disclosed,
there are practical considera
tions— jobs and research money
— that now hold a high priority
for graduating university stu
dents.
"Why should they protest?"
asked Angus Thurmer, assistant
to the director of the CIA. "Jobs

are very scarce these days."
The CIA internship program
for foreign studies has received
more than 1000 inquiries for 50
openings. Internship program
participants, about half of whom
become fulltime CIA employes,
come from a wide range of col
leges. including Harvard, Yale
and the University of Chicago.
They receive monthly salaries of
between $HOO and $1000.
Students accepted into the
program come from a wide range
of disciplines and usually at the
top of their classes, with masters
degrees or higher.
