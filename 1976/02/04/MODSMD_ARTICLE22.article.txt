## Seek and Destroy defending IM basketball champs, but... 
### Larry Berz John Driscoll 
Contrary to popular belief,
quality basketball can be ob
served in Maples Pavilion on
nights other than alternate Fri
days and Saturdays, when the
varsity usually plays.
The game is intramural bas
ketball, and one of its top rep
resentatives is Seek and Destroy.
Just ask the Theta Delt A-II ca
gers (not to be confused with the
Theta Delt A-I team), who were
sought and destroyed in a one
sided contest a few weeks ago.
Seek and Destroy is the defend
ing "A" league IM champion,
and, according to several in
tramural watchers, it will be the
team to beat this winter.
The Athletic Department's de
cision to axe the junior varsity

basketball program has compen
sated for the loss of several
players from last year's champ
ionship Seek and Destroy squad.
Many athletes who normally
would have played JV or varsity
basketball this season have
moved into the IM ranks.
Seek and Destroy has been for
tunate enough to enlist the ta
lents of former JV superstar and
cult hero Sven Walker, agile
ex-JV guard Tony Hill (he also
plays football] and last year's
nimble JV playmaker Terry
McCartin.
Sweeney seeks No. 3
Returning from last year's
championship team is 6-foot-4
forward Mark Sweeney, who
also played with the 1974 "A"
league champions, the Plum
bers. He will be shooting for his

third consecutive championship
this year. The team is rounded
out by center Brad Powers,
freshman John Streeter and Erik
Walker, Sven's younger brother.
Seek and Destroy's style of
play is quick, high-powered and,
as the name implies, deadly. In
deed, a few highlights of its
77-42 win over the Theta Delts
are worth noting. Seek and De
stroy controlled the opening tip
and scored within the first three
seconds of the game. Walker,
who played before a fragmented
contingent of the once notorious
"Sven's Men," hit nine of his
patented soft-touch jumpers in
11 attempts during the second
half.
The ever-flamboyant Hill,
after making a steal late in the
second half, drove to the bucket

and slam dunked, resulting in a
technical foul. (Remember Lon
nie Shelton in the closing mi
nutes of the UCLA-Oregon State
game?) Erik Walker connected
on three consecutive 20-
footers ("I bomb from the out
side — that's what Sven taught
rne," he commented later). Fi
nally, McCartin threw up a
30-foot prayer that swished at
the buzzer. Final score: 77-42.
Seek and Destroy. Who said the
quality of mercy is not strained?
Matchup missed
Seek and Destroy was to meet
the Theta Delt A-I team, led by
former varsity players Rich
Wohlstadter and Marty Moroski
and ex-JV guard Bill Christ
opher, but it never came off. The
two teams may meet in the in
tramural basketball final to de
cide the IM champion.
All in all, this year's "A"
league competition, with the
addition of numerous former
and potential JV cagers to com
plement the usual residue of
die-hard jocks, should prove an
exciting pastime for those
sports-hungry fans who can't get
enough of Maples Pavilion. In
the words of one inspired fan
(who is not Muhammad Ali), "It
gonna be bad this year. More
bumps and less chumps, more
drivin' and less jivin'."

BACK IN ACTlON—Former junior varsity eager Terry McCartin of Seek and Destroy puts up a shot
in intramural action. Seek and Destroy is the defending "A" league IM champion.
Contrary to popular belief,
quality basketball can be ob
served in Maples Pavilion on
nights other than alternate Fri
days and Saturdays, when the
varsity usually plays.
The game is intramural bas
ketball, and one of its top rep
resentatives is Seek and Destroy.
Just ask the Theta Delt A-II ca
gers (not to be confused with the
Theta Delt A-I team), who were
sought and destroyed in a one
sided contest a few weeks ago.
Seek and Destroy is the defend
ing "A" league IM champion,
and, according to several in
tramural watchers, it will be the
team to beat this winter.
The Athletic Department's de
cision to axe the junior varsity

basketball program has compen
sated for the loss of several
players from last year's champ
ionship Seek and Destroy squad.
Many athletes who normally
would have played JV or varsity
basketball this season have
moved into the IM ranks.
Seek and Destroy has been for
tunate enough to enlist the ta
lents of former JV superstar and
cult hero Sven Walker, agile
ex-JV guard Tony Hill (he also
plays football] and last year's
nimble JV playmaker Terry
McCartin.
Sweeney seeks No. 3
Returning from last year's
championship team is 6-foot-4
forward Mark Sweeney, who
also played with the 1974 "A"
league champions, the Plum
bers. He will be shooting for his

third consecutive championship
this year. The team is rounded
out by center Brad Powers,
freshman John Streeter and Erik
Walker, Sven's younger brother.
Seek and Destroy's style of
play is quick, high-powered and,
as the name implies, deadly. In
deed, a few highlights of its
77-42 win over the Theta Delts
are worth noting. Seek and De
stroy controlled the opening tip
and scored within the first three
seconds of the game. Walker,
who played before a fragmented
contingent of the once notorious
"Sven's Men," hit nine of his
patented soft-touch jumpers in
11 attempts during the second
half.
The ever-flamboyant Hill,
after making a steal late in the
second half, drove to the bucket

and slam dunked, resulting in a
technical foul. (Remember Lon
nie Shelton in the closing mi
nutes of the UCLA-Oregon State
game?) Erik Walker connected
on three consecutive 20-
footers ("I bomb from the out
side — that's what Sven taught
rne," he commented later). Fi
nally, McCartin threw up a
30-foot prayer that swished at
the buzzer. Final score: 77-42.
Seek and Destroy. Who said the
quality of mercy is not strained?
Matchup missed
Seek and Destroy was to meet
the Theta Delt A-I team, led by
former varsity players Rich
Wohlstadter and Marty Moroski
and ex-JV guard Bill Christ
opher, but it never came off. The
two teams may meet in the in
tramural basketball final to de
