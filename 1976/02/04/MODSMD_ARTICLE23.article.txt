# ... Theta Delts stand in way of repeat performance in '76

A juggernaut is presently ripping and
tearing its way through the"A" leagues of
Stanford's intramural basketball program.
The creature has wreaked havoc in its divi
sion, outscoring its opponents by a com
bined total of 263 to 127. This entity,
though, has not suddenly come out of
nowhere, for many of its components have
been seen in Stanford hoop circles for the
past few years.
The destruction brought about by this ir
resistible force has been credited to the
Theta Delt A-I team, and deservedly so. A
look at the Theta Delt roster will dispel any
doubts one may have as to the strength of
this intramural squad
The seven team members have compiled
a total of nearly 10 years of experience in
Stanford's intercollegiate basketball or
ganization. All of the team members at
tained all-league status in high school.
Junior guard Bruce Richards, a performer
for the junior varsity last year, best illus
trates this point. "All of us have a lot of
experience. We make fewer mistakes than
the other teams."
Versatile Marty Moroski, last year a
member of the championship Seek and De
stroy club, voices similar sentiments. "We

have overall speed and a lot of good invidu
als. Everyone has the ability to score."
Varsity veterans
Moroski, a deadly shot, and Rich
Wohlstadter, the "big man" of the team at
6-foot-5 and an amazing jumper, have both
seen limited action with the varsity.
What comparisons do they offer? Moroski
says there is, of course, less pressure. "You
can do more stuff than you would in a var
sity game. But the big thing is just being able
to play." Wohlstadter states his feeling in a
slightly different manner. "I scored more
points in three intramural games than I did
in three years for Stanford. Besides, the
Theta Delts offered me more money."
"Being able to play" is a point expressed
frequently by all the players, but some have
accused the Theta Delts of being overzeal
ous in recruiting a good team. Team
member Bob Brain says, "We didn't try to
make a super team. We're together because
we're friendly."
'Good team ball'
With so many good players, one might
expect difficulty in meshing the talents into
one unit. After all, you can only use one
basketball at a time. George Fisher, a senior
who plays the post, calls the Theta Delts'
style of play "good team ball." "We move
the ball around as much as we can," savs

Richards.
Team supervisor Mike Simons, a guard
on the varsity, shares this feeling. That
could be why all he does at the games is sit
back and let the team coach itself. Occa
sionally he makes substitutions in order to
let the players have nearly equal playing
time. "We're pretty well balanced," says
Simons. Bill Christoper agrees, "We really
have seven starters. If a guy's friends show
up. he'll probably start."
The Theta Delts have impressed their op
ponents. "They probably have the best
chance of anybody to win it all," said big
Mark Hoaglin about the Delts. "They run a
good offense. That's what beat us when we
played them."
Delts' chances good
What are the odds that the Theta Delts
will be crowned "A" league champions?
Pretty good, to say the least. Although
Moroski says the team has not played up to
its capabilities, "If we get our stuff together,
we have the potential to go all he way."
Christopher is "pretty sure we'll take it all."
Wohlstadter speaks in stronger terms.
"There's not much of a battle ahead."
Everyone started laughing at this decree,
but somehow one gets the feeling they
really mean it.
