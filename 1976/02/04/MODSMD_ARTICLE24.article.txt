## Back from paradise 
### Mike Tollin 
Going to Hawaii to play basketball is like
going to New York in December to get a suntan.
Or travelling to Ohio to go mountain climbing.
But Dick Dißiaso's neoCardinals (a.k.a. Robber
Barons) said "aloha" to all those cardiac arrest
losses last week and hopped on a plane to the
land of puka shells, belly dancers and
coconuts.
No, The New Regime had not decided to
pack it up and go for a holiday, but rather was
just fulfilling a schedule "commitment." Too
bad, huh? And before they played their first
game with the University of Hawaii Friday
night, they had to endure two grueling days on
Waikiki Beach. Amazing what sacrifices the
youth of today will make for a good cause.
After some sight-seeing Wednesday night
and a two-hour practice Thursday morning,
the Stanford contingent braved the Pacific
Ocean Thursday afternoon. Bodysurfing and
snorkeling were on the agenda, but for Jay Car
ter, the name of the game was survival.
The Dayton, Ohio, resident reported to his
teammates that he had only been in the ocean
once before, and he then proceeded to enter
tain them with his imitation of someone who
didn't know how to swim. Carter, who last year
was christened "Wow" in honor of his favorite
expression, could only utter "gurgle" and
"glub" this time, as the more amphibious Car
dinals howled.
Cards routed
Nevertheless, Carter and the rest of the Car
dinals made it to the Honolulu gymnasium
intact Friday night, but in the lingo of the is
land, the game was a washout. The Hawaii
Rainbows, sporting four New Yorkers in their
starting lineup, gave Stanford a lesson in the
finer points of the City Game. "They were
sky high,"said Dißiaso. "Their fast break was
awesome. They were controlling the boards
and blowing by us all night. We weren't ready
to play . . . tired from all the walking,sightsee
ing of the previous two days. You might say
we were 'overaggressived'!"
The next night the Cards acted as if they had
been suddenly energized by a special concoc
tion of pineapple-coconut juice. "The team
was really determined," Dißiaso said. "Hawaii
broke into their pro-style warmup drill and
seemed a little overconfident, but we just went
out and did it."
The Cards, going almost exclusively with

their starting five, stood up well this time to the
mammoth Rainbow front line, and when Wolfe
Perry banged in an 18-footer, "another gutsy
Cardinal effort" had turned into a WIN. Im
agine, Stanford wins by one!
'Routine for Perry'
The Hawaii media (yes, they do have news
papers there; they use them to shade their eyes)
called Perry's buzzer-beater a "prayer" shot,
but Dißiaso laughed and said, "Anyone who's
seen him play knows that's routine for him."
Indeed, the shot made observers recall the Cal
game when two Stanford chances to win the
game with a last shot went awry, as Perry sat
harmlessly on the bench with five fouls.
The freshman continues to improve, and
local scribe Larry Lavelle recently suggested
that before he's through here, Perry should re
place Claude Terry as the one whom future
Stanford guards will be measured against. And
with Perry, Carter and Mike Bratz all returning
next year, the Stanford backcourt should be a
bona fide strength for the first time since
somewhere around the Civil War.
Recruiting
With this in mind, The New Regime can
concentrate on trying to bring in some
frontcourt muscle to share the lumps next year
with Ceorge Schader. Dißo and company
won't have a Hawaii trip to entice potential
recruits this year, but it shouldn't hurt too
much. Schader said it wasn't much of a factor
when they recruited him, and Dißiaso con
tended that, "The combination of academics
and Pacific Eight basketball is the main thing. I
honestly think that if you asked our players,
they'd prefer to go south and play UCLA and
USC rather than go to Hawaii."
This week, as the Pac-8 season reaches the
halfway point, the destination is Oregon.
Eugene, tomorrow night's stop, can't match
Honolulu, or even L.A. in the fun-and-sun de
partment, but in the last few years, the town,
particularly the University of Oregon located
there,has gone basketball-crazy.
There's nothing Dick Dißiaso-would like
more than to see the Stanford community
going similarly bonkers over its basketball
team. It's maybe a ways off, but crowds have
been larger this year, and as the young Cards
mature, so, it seems, do the fans. "If we start
winning, and play exciting basketball, the fans
will come," Dißiaso said. "It just happens."
Okay, how does "Maples Pit" sound?

The Hawaii media (yes, they do have news
papers there; they use them to shade their eyes)
called Perry's buzzer-beater a "prayer" shot,
but Dißiaso laughed and said, "Anyone who's
seen him play knows that's routine for him."
Indeed, the shot made observers recall the Cal
game when two Stanford chances to win the
game with a last shot went awry, as Perry sat
harmlessly on the bench with five fouls.
The freshman continues to improve, and
local scribe Larry Lavelle recently suggested
that before he's through here, Perry should re
place Claude Terry as the one whom future
Stanford guards will be measured against. And
with Perry, Carter and Mike Bratz all returning
next year, the Stanford backcourt should be a
bona fide strength for the first time since
somewhere around the Civil War.
Recruiting
With this in mind, The New Regime can
concentrate on trying to bring in some
frontcourt muscle to share the lumps next year
with Ceorge Schader. Dißo and company
won't have a Hawaii trip to entice potential
recruits this year, but it shouldn't hurt too
much. Schader said it wasn't much of a factor
when they recruited him, and Dißiaso con
tended that, "The combination of academics
and Pacific Eight basketball is the main thing. I
honestly think that if you asked our players,
they'd prefer to go south and play UCLA and
USC rather than go to Hawaii."
This week, as the Pac-8 season reaches the
halfway point, the destination is Oregon.
Eugene, tomorrow night's stop, can't match
Honolulu, or even L.A. in the fun-and-sun de
partment, but in the last few years, the town,
particularly the University of Oregon located
there,has gone basketball-crazy.
There's nothing Dick Dißiaso-would like
more than to see the Stanford community
going similarly bonkers over its basketball
team. It's maybe a ways off, but crowds have
been larger this year, and as the young Cards
mature, so, it seems, do the fans. "If we start
winning, and play exciting basketball, the fans
will come," Dißiaso said. "It just happens."
Okay, how does "Maples Pit" sound?

Going to Hawaii to play basketball is like
going to New York in December to get a suntan.
Or travelling to Ohio to go mountain climbing.
But Dick Dißiaso's neoCardinals (a.k.a. Robber
Barons) said "aloha" to all those cardiac arrest
losses last week and hopped on a plane to the
land of puka shells, belly dancers and
coconuts.
No, The New Regime had not decided to
pack it up and go for a holiday, but rather was
just fulfilling a schedule "commitment." Too
bad, huh? And before they played their first
game with the University of Hawaii Friday
night, they had to endure two grueling days on
Waikiki Beach. Amazing what sacrifices the
youth of today will make for a good cause.
After some sight-seeing Wednesday night
and a two-hour practice Thursday morning,
the Stanford contingent braved the Pacific
Ocean Thursday afternoon. Bodysurfing and
snorkeling were on the agenda, but for Jay Car
ter, the name of the game was survival.
The Dayton, Ohio, resident reported to his
teammates that he had only been in the ocean
once before, and he then proceeded to enter
tain them with his imitation of someone who
didn't know how to swim. Carter, who last year
was christened "Wow" in honor of his favorite
expression, could only utter "gurgle" and
"glub" this time, as the more amphibious Car
dinals howled.
Cards routed
Nevertheless, Carter and the rest of the Car
dinals made it to the Honolulu gymnasium
intact Friday night, but in the lingo of the is
land, the game was a washout. The Hawaii
Rainbows, sporting four New Yorkers in their
starting lineup, gave Stanford a lesson in the
finer points of the City Game. "They were
sky high,"said Dißiaso. "Their fast break was
awesome. They were controlling the boards
and blowing by us all night. We weren't ready
to play . . . tired from all the walking,sightsee
ing of the previous two days. You might say
we were 'overaggressived'!"
The next night the Cards acted as if they had
been suddenly energized by a special concoc
tion of pineapple-coconut juice. "The team
was really determined," Dißiaso said. "Hawaii
broke into their pro-style warmup drill and
seemed a little overconfident, but we just went
out and did it."
The Cards, going almost exclusively with

their starting five, stood up well this time to the
mammoth Rainbow front line, and when Wolfe
Perry banged in an 18-footer, "another gutsy
Cardinal effort" had turned into a WIN. Im
agine, Stanford wins by one!

pack it up and go for a holiday, but rather was
just fulfilling a schedule "commitment." Too
bad, huh? And before they played their first
game with the University of Hawaii Friday
night, they had to endure two grueling days on
Waikiki Beach. Amazing what sacrifices the
youth of today will make for a good cause.
After some sight-seeing Wednesday night
and a two-hour practice Thursday morning,
the Stanford contingent braved the Pacific
Ocean Thursday afternoon. Bodysurfing and
snorkeling were on the agenda, but for Jay Car
ter, the name of the game was survival.
The Dayton, Ohio, resident reported to his
teammates that he had only been in the ocean
once before, and he then proceeded to enter
tain them with his imitation of someone who
didn't know how to swim. Carter, who last year
was christened "Wow" in honor of his favorite
expression, could only utter "gurgle" and
"glub" this time, as the more amphibious Car
dinals howled.
Cards routed
Nevertheless, Carter and the rest of the Car
dinals made it to the Honolulu gymnasium
intact Friday night, but in the lingo of the is
land, the game was a washout. The Hawaii
Rainbows, sporting four New Yorkers in their
starting lineup, gave Stanford a lesson in the
finer points of the City Game. "They were
sky high,"said Dißiaso. "Their fast break was
awesome. They were controlling the boards
and blowing by us all night. We weren't ready
to play . . . tired from all the walking,sightsee
ing of the previous two days. You might say
we were 'overaggressived'!"
The next night the Cards acted as if they had
been suddenly energized by a special concoc
tion of pineapple-coconut juice. "The team
was really determined," Dißiaso said. "Hawaii
broke into their pro-style warmup drill and
seemed a little overconfident, but we just went
out and did it."
The Cards, going almost exclusively with

their starting five, stood up well this time to the
mammoth Rainbow front line, and when Wolfe
Perry banged in an 18-footer, "another gutsy
Cardinal effort" had turned into a WIN. Im
agine, Stanford wins by one!
'Routine for Perry'
The Hawaii media (yes, they do have news
papers there; they use them to shade their eyes)
called Perry's buzzer-beater a "prayer" shot,
but Dißiaso laughed and said, "Anyone who's
seen him play knows that's routine for him."
Indeed, the shot made observers recall the Cal
game when two Stanford chances to win the
game with a last shot went awry, as Perry sat
harmlessly on the bench with five fouls.
The freshman continues to improve, and
local scribe Larry Lavelle recently suggested
that before he's through here, Perry should re
place Claude Terry as the one whom future
Stanford guards will be measured against. And
with Perry, Carter and Mike Bratz all returning
next year, the Stanford backcourt should be a
bona fide strength for the first time since
somewhere around the Civil War.
Recruiting
With this in mind, The New Regime can
concentrate on trying to bring in some
frontcourt muscle to share the lumps next year
with Ceorge Schader. Dißo and company
won't have a Hawaii trip to entice potential
recruits this year, but it shouldn't hurt too
much. Schader said it wasn't much of a factor
when they recruited him, and Dißiaso con
tended that, "The combination of academics
and Pacific Eight basketball is the main thing. I
honestly think that if you asked our players,
they'd prefer to go south and play UCLA and
USC rather than go to Hawaii."
This week, as the Pac-8 season reaches the
halfway point, the destination is Oregon.
Eugene, tomorrow night's stop, can't match
Honolulu, or even L.A. in the fun-and-sun de
partment, but in the last few years, the town,
particularly the University of Oregon located
there,has gone basketball-crazy.
There's nothing Dick Dißiaso-would like
more than to see the Stanford community
going similarly bonkers over its basketball
team. It's maybe a ways off, but crowds have
been larger this year, and as the young Cards
mature, so, it seems, do the fans. "If we start
winning, and play exciting basketball, the fans
will come," Dißiaso said. "It just happens."
Okay, how does "Maples Pit" sound?
