# Cards resume league play
## 
### Chris Baker 
Stanford's basketball team
hardly had a chance to unpack
its puka shells from its trip to
Hawaii last week. The Cards take
off for Oregon this afternoon for
Pacific Eight games against Ore
gon tomorrow in McArthur
Court at 8 p.m.. and Oregon State
Saturday night in Corvallis at 8.
Both contests will be broadcast
live over KZSU (90.1 FM).
The Cards, who beat the Rain
bows 66-65 on Wolfe Perry's 18-
footer at the buzzer Saturday
night to gain a split in their
two-game series with Hawaii,
weren't treated very well by their
Hawaiian hosts last weekend.
Coach Dick Dißiaso was
forced to call practice on the
lower level of the Honolulu
Holiday Inn. where the team was
headquartered. The Honolulu
International Center was being
used for a high school basketball
game Saturday afternoon.
'Adaptability'
"It just proves the adaptability
of the Stanford student-athlete,"
said Dißiaso. But the Cards don't
figure to be treated any better in
basketball-crazy McArthur
Court, where over 10,500 fana
tics will throw ice, coke, donut
frisbees and anything else they
can think of at the Robber Ba

rons.
While the fans are intimidat
ing Stanford, Oregon mentor
Dick Harter's ballclub will be
playing Kamikaze basketball —
translation: The Ducks will try
to kick the shit out of Stanford.
Oregon knocked off Oregon
State 83-68 in a conference game
in Eugene, then repeated with a
76-74 overtime non-conference
win in Portland last Thursday
night.
"They are now executing well
offensively and playing very
good team defense." said Di-
Biaso. "That's a combination all
coaches are striving to reach at
this point in the season."
Super guard
By outstanding personnel,
Dißiaso means Oregon super
guard Ron Lee. Besides having a
body that would make Jim
Brown green with envy — that's
emerald green — Lee has a scor
ing average that makes almost
everyone in the Pac-8 envious.
The 6-foot-4 guard is pumping
in 19.4 points per game. He's
also on a hot streak, with 28
points per game over his last five
contests. Lee adds 5.7 assists and
three floor burns per contest.
The Ducks' second leading
scorer is 6-7 forward Creg Bal
lard, with a 16.0 per game scor
ing average.
Harter, now in his fifth season
in Eugene, flanks Ballard with
freshman forward Danny Mack
and 6-10 center Geoff Nelson. In
the backcourt Harter has
switched to veteran Mark Bar
wig.
Key baskets
Junior forward Stu Jackson,
who came off the bench for some
key baskets in the Ducks' second
win over Oregon State, is Ore
gon's third leading scorer with a
14.1 average.
Oregon State, Stanford's
Saturday night opponent, may
be sitting in the drivers' seat in
the conference race, despite los
ing two straight games to Ore
gon.
Junior center Lonnie Shelton,
who made the difficult transi
tion from pro to college basket
ball, leads the Beavers with an
18.5 scoring average. OSU has
three other starters in double fi
gures — guards Rocky Smith
(16.6) and George "Ice-T"
Tucker (12.1) and forward Don
Smith (12.2). Tucker also leads
the conference in assists with an
8.5 average.

State tipping a shot against Stanford last year. Shelton, a junior

Stanford's basketball team
hardly had a chance to unpack
its puka shells from its trip to
Hawaii last week. The Cards take
off for Oregon this afternoon for
Pacific Eight games against Ore
gon tomorrow in McArthur
Court at 8 p.m.. and Oregon State
Saturday night in Corvallis at 8.
Both contests will be broadcast
live over KZSU (90.1 FM).
The Cards, who beat the Rain
bows 66-65 on Wolfe Perry's 18-
footer at the buzzer Saturday
night to gain a split in their
two-game series with Hawaii,
weren't treated very well by their
Hawaiian hosts last weekend.
Coach Dick Dißiaso was
forced to call practice on the
lower level of the Honolulu
Holiday Inn. where the team was
headquartered. The Honolulu
International Center was being
used for a high school basketball
game Saturday afternoon.
'Adaptability'
"It just proves the adaptability
of the Stanford student-athlete,"
said Dißiaso. But the Cards don't
figure to be treated any better in
basketball-crazy McArthur
Court, where over 10,500 fana
tics will throw ice, coke, donut
frisbees and anything else they
can think of at the Robber Ba

rons.
While the fans are intimidat
ing Stanford, Oregon mentor
Dick Harter's ballclub will be
playing Kamikaze basketball —
translation: The Ducks will try
to kick the shit out of Stanford.
Oregon knocked off Oregon
State 83-68 in a conference game
in Eugene, then repeated with a
76-74 overtime non-conference
win in Portland last Thursday
night.
"They are now executing well
offensively and playing very
good team defense." said Di-
Biaso. "That's a combination all
coaches are striving to reach at
this point in the season."
Super guard
By outstanding personnel,
Dißiaso means Oregon super
guard Ron Lee. Besides having a
body that would make Jim
Brown green with envy — that's
emerald green — Lee has a scor
ing average that makes almost
everyone in the Pac-8 envious.
The 6-foot-4 guard is pumping
in 19.4 points per game. He's
also on a hot streak, with 28
points per game over his last five
contests. Lee adds 5.7 assists and
three floor burns per contest.
The Ducks' second leading
scorer is 6-7 forward Creg Bal
lard, with a 16.0 per game scor
ing average.
Harter, now in his fifth season
in Eugene, flanks Ballard with
freshman forward Danny Mack
and 6-10 center Geoff Nelson. In
the backcourt Harter has
switched to veteran Mark Bar
wig.
Key baskets
Junior forward Stu Jackson,
who came off the bench for some
key baskets in the Ducks' second
win over Oregon State, is Ore
gon's third leading scorer with a
14.1 average.
Oregon State, Stanford's
Saturday night opponent, may
be sitting in the drivers' seat in
the conference race, despite los
ing two straight games to Ore
gon.
Junior center Lonnie Shelton,
who made the difficult transi
tion from pro to college basket
ball, leads the Beavers with an
18.5 scoring average. OSU has
three other starters in double fi
gures — guards Rocky Smith
(16.6) and George "Ice-T"
Tucker (12.1) and forward Don
Smith (12.2). Tucker also leads
the conference in assists with an
8.5 average.
