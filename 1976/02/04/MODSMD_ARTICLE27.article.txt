# Pac-8 predictions

### 
Saved by an act of the associate editor's
cutting knife, our predictor picked four of six
games correctly last week to bring his season
record to 19-11, a .633 mark.
But the wizard has to pay his dues this
week. Two weeks ago he took advantage of
several non-conference mismatches to run his
record up. This week the three teams tied for
the Pacific Eight lead play each other.
Stanford will be hitting the road for the
second week in a row, as the Cards journey to
Oregons Coach Dick Dißiaso will get his first
dose of Kamikaze basketball in McArthur
Court tomorrow night. It probably won't be
very nice either.
Saturday night Stanford visits Oregon

State. While the Beavers may not be able to
win the "Oregon Civil War," they'll probably
beat the Cards . . . Robber Barons . . . Trees.
Washington hosts UCLA tomorrow night in a
battle for a share of the Pac-8 lead. Bruin boss
Gene Bartow saved his job for at least another
week with a 6'B-62 win over last-place USC
last Saturday in Pauley Pavilion.
