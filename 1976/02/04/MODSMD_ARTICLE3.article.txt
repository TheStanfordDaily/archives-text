A recently established student car
pool service, sponsored by the Off-
Campus Student Center (OCSC), is ex
periencing difficulty in attracting par
ticipants.
Liane Collins. OCSC student co
ordinator, said the exceptionally mild
weather and the late implementation
of the program has made it difficult to
get students interested.
"Students biking to campus feel no
need to use the system because the
weather has been so good," Collins
said. "However, we encourage stu
dents to consider that it may very well
rain,and in such a case it would be
convenient to be a member of a car
pool."
The service was initiated winter
quarter and consists of a file in which
students register their names and ad
dresses.

OCSC office in the Old Union
