# Carpool service flounders

A recently established student car
pool service, sponsored by the Off-
Campus Student Center (OCSC), is ex
periencing difficulty in attracting par
ticipants.
Liane Collins. OCSC student co
ordinator, said the exceptionally mild
weather and the late implementation
of the program has made it difficult to
get students interested.
"Students biking to campus feel no
need to use the system because the
weather has been so good," Collins
said. "However, we encourage stu
dents to consider that it may very well
rain,and in such a case it would be
convenient to be a member of a car
pool."
The service was initiated winter
quarter and consists of a file in which
students register their names and ad
dresses.
Hy referring to the file located in the
OCSC office in the Old Union
Clubhouse, students are able to find
potential participants who live in the
same area.
The carpool is also available to fa
culty and staff.
Collins said letters explaining the
service have been sent to off-campus
students.
"A problem we didn't foresee,"she
said, "is that by winter quarter people
are already established in their biking
and driving habits." As a result, the
file has not been instituted yet, she ad
ded.
Collins mentioned a lack of motiva
tion on the part of the students as
another factor in the current failure of
the carpool to become a viable service.

"From my viewpoint," she said, "it
seems to be a great thing, but I don't
know whether there exists any student
motivation for the system."
An incentive has been offered to
help encourage the formation of car
pools. "If three or more students sign
up as a carpool group with the police
services office," she said, "students
will receive, free of charge, a sticker
allowing them to park in the reserved
off-campus student parking lots that
are more convenient to campus, but
usually expensive."
The sole requirements are that at
least one person have a "G" parking
sticker and that a minimum of three
persons be involved.
