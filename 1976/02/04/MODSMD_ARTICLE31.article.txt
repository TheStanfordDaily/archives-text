Coleman to rule on Concorde
WASHINGTON —Transportation Secretary Wil
liam Coleman Jr. will announce today whether the
controversial Concorde supersonic passenger
plane can be used on scheduled flights between
Europe and two U.S. airports.
The closely guarded decision will be announced
at 10:15 a.m. PST. Special couriers will deliver
copies of the decision to the governments of Britain
and France at that time, a department spokesman
said. Those two countries are the joint builders of
the futuristic plane, which can travel faster than a
speeding bullet.
The issue before Coleman is whether he should
allow Air France and British Airways to use the
Concorde on four daily flights from Europe to New
York's John F. Kennedy Airport and on two daily
trans-Atlantic flights to Washington's Dulles Inter
national Airport.
Although the Concorde dispute has been viewed
as a confrontation between technological progress
and environmental issues, Coleman's decision is
also likely to be influenced by treaty obligations of
the United States.
Natural gas controls to end?
WASHINGTON — The House yesterday opened
the way for a vote on removing federal price con
trols on natural gas, which could bring higher util
ity bills for consumers.
By a vote of 230 to 184, the House approved a rule
permitting amendments to an emergency natural
gas bill. The one major amendment anticipated to
the legislation would all but completely deregulate
the price of the fuel.
The amendment would permit the lifting of price
controls on new natural gas from off-shore wells
over a five-year period. It would lift all price con
trols immediately on new natural gas from onshore
wells.
Both sides of the issue give various estimates as
to the cost of deregulation to the average consumer,

ranging from average gas bills of about $250 a year
by 1980, to a high of $331 a year. This would be
higher than the government figure of $170 a year in
1974)
Ford: reluctant on abortion
WASHINGTON — President Ford said yesterday
he would oppose a constitutional amendment pro
hibiting abortion, but prefers one that would give
states the right to decide such issues.
"I do not believe in abortion on demand," Ford
said in a television interview. But, he added, that
there must be some flexibility in the law to permit
abortion in cases involving the mother's illness or
rape.
Describing his views as "a moderate position,"
Ford addressed the abortion issue in an interview
with CBS correspondent Walter Cronkite.
He said that while he did not agree with the
Supreme Court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion,
he had taken an oath of office to uphold the law as
interpreted by the court and would do so.
Ronald Reagan, Ford's rival for the GOP presi
dential nomination, has endorsed a constitutional
amendment approach that would, in effect, prevent
most abortions but allow them in extreme cases
such as when a mother's life is in danger.
Among Democratic candidates, only George
Wallace has voiced support for an anti-abortion
amendment, although several others say they op
pose abortion in principle.
Kissinger blasts Congress
SAN FRANCISCO — Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger accused Congress yesterday of helping
set a "dangerous precedent" by cutting off U.S.
support for anti-Soviet forces in Angola.
"It's the first time that the United States has failed
to respond to Soviet military moves outside the
immediate Soviet orbit," he said. "And it is the
first time that Congress has halted national action
in the middle of a crisis."
As Kissinger addressed the Commonwealth Club
of San Francisco and the World Affairs Council of
Northern California, police kept a crowd of 500 to
700 demonstrators behind barricades across the
street from the Fairmont Hotel.
As one protester held aloft a Kissinger effigy wrth
a noose around its neck, the crowd chanted and
waved placards opposing U.S. intervention in An
gola and bearing anti-Kissinger slogans.
In response to written questions after his speech,
Kissinger was asked about the resignation Monday
of United Nations Ambassador Daniel Moyni
han.
"We knew exactly what he would do, and he was
sent to New York to carry out the policies he did
indeed carry out," Kissinger said. "He carried out
with very great distinction the instructions of the
President and the secretary of state and gave them
his own inspired cast."
"I think he made a major contribution to Ameri
can foreign policy," Kissinger added.
Spy agency limits okayed
WASHINGTON — The House intelligence com
mittee approved to abolish the Pentagon's huge
Defense Intelligence Agency and also to make it
harder for presidents to order covert operations
over the objections of the CIA and other agencies.
The committee also rejected, 7 to 4, a proposal
that they try to work out a compromise with Presi
dent Ford on knocking secret information out of its
final report.
A committee counsel, Jack Boos, said the staff
found the DIA, has failed to coordinate military

intelligence as it was created to do, its "intelligence
product has been unsatisfactory," and it has at
tempted to of the same subjects as the
CIA, wasting money and doing an inferior job.
The six members of a proposed National Security
Council subcommittee on foreign operations
would be required to give the president individual
assessments of the benefits and prospects for suc
cess for a proposed covert operation and the risks if
it failed or was publicly exposed.
The six members would include the secretary of
state, secretary of defense and director of the CIA.
GE men feared nuclear slips
LOS ANGELES — Resignations of three General
Electric engineers over nuclear energy safety were
not based on specific fears but a concern about the
chances of accidents, they explained yesterday.
Assertions by the nuclear power industry that
"problems don't exist" pushed them toward their
simultaneous action, said Richard Hubbard, one of
the three who*quit.
Hubbard, Dale G. Bridenbaugh and Gregory C.
Mi nor resigned Monday, saying they felt there was
no way to make nuclear power safe enough to jus
tify its development.
At a press conference amplifying their resigna
tions, Hubbard said engineers have found errors in
design, vibrations, cracks and other irregularities
during their years of experience in helping to build
nuclear power plants.
"Safety problems are not fully reported when
they are first suspected," Hubbard said. "If they
were, questions would be asked that can't be
answered. So the problems are not reported until
they are understood."
Irish convention reconvened
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Northern Ire
land's constitutional convention was reconvened
by the British government yesterday and given 30
days to work out a solution permitting Roman
Catholics a share in governing the Protestant
dominated province.
Neither British officials nor Ulster's feuding
politicians held out much hope that the convention
would agree on a power-sharing formula to end the
6V2 years of sectarian bloodshed in which nearly
1500 persons have been killed.
The nonlegislative body failed to reach agree
ment on power-sharing in six months of tortuous
deliberation last year.
Morton becomes Ford's aide
WASHINGTON — Rogers C. B. Morton was in
stalled yesterday as President Ford's political
right-hand man, saying the job is essential and that
only hypocrites claim government and politics can
be separated.
Even as Morton was sworn in as a $$44,600-a
-year counselor to the President, Democratic party
leaders and lawyers conferred about their stalled
effort to require that his salary be billed to the Ford
campaign.
Morton said most of his time will be spent work
ing with White House officials, councils and
Cabinet members to make sure the President's
policies are understood, implemented and made
clear to Congress and to the people.
