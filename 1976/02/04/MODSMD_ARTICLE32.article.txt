## 
### 
CHICO (AP) —The first mass arrests have
taken place in a two-month-old sit-in protesting
the arming of Chico State University police,
with 35 young persons accused of trespassing.
School officials said those arrested, most of
them students, had violated a new order closing
the administration building from 11 p.m. to 7
a.m.
The protesters said the order was the first in
the school's history, and claimed it was promp
ted by telephone calls some of the demonstrators
had made to college officials at home the night
before.
When Campus Police Chief Ray Baruk arrived
with other officers at 11 p.m. Monday to close
the doors, he found a crowd of about 150 young
people. He called for reinforcements from Chico
police and the Butte County sheriff's office.
The officers discovered the students had un
screwed the hinges from the two large oak doors.
Alter the arrests, the doors, were put back on.
Student spokeswomen Julie Savage said the
sit-in would continue in the daytime and she
didn't know what would happen if the building
was closed again at night.
The sit-in is to protest Chancellor Glenn
Dumke's order that police on all 19 state college
campuses carry guns. The demonstrators want
each campus to make its own decision.
