# On-campus parking plagues car owners

### Rosario Delatorre 
A shortage of spaces near the inner
campus, rather than a lack of parking
overall,is the University's major park
ing problem, according to Donald
Winhigler, chairman of the University
Committee on Parking and Transpor
tation.
Winhigler claimed University con
struction in the central campus was
responsible for reducing the number of
centrally located parking spaces. "The
parking spaces have been replaced,
but they are farther out," he said.
"The history of University construc
tion in the inner campus has decreased
nearby parking and pushed (available)
parking spaces to the periphery," said
Winbigler.
The committee will announce pub
lic meetings in about three weeks to
collect opinions and suggestions con
cerning the new parking system, Win
bigler said.
"The purpose of the committee is to
collect opinions and suggestions from
the community for improvements (in
the parking system). We are working
under the assumption that hearings
will be announced within the next two
or three weeks," he explained.
Winbigler added that the committee
is still discussing details for the public
hearings.
Augshurger responsible
Winbigler stressed that the commit
tee was not responsible for the ad
ministration of the parking program.
"The committee can only make re
commendations to the vice president
for business and finance (Robert
Augsburger), who is responsible for
the program's administration," he
noted.
The committee will also be evaluat
ing the Stanford shuttle bus system,
which will be discontinued.
"The (shuttle bus) experiment will
terminate April 30, and on the basis of
the results, we will decide if it will be
continued next year," said Winbigler.
He explained that records were
being kept on the number of users,
operating costs and riders' evaluations
of the experiment.
"There is (also) the likelihood that
we will hold public hearings as part of
the evaluation." Winbigler added.

The committee will judge how well
the program fulfilled a real transporta
tion need. It will also discuss whether
the program will continue next year
and how it will be funded.
The current4V2-monthexperiment is
jointly financed by the University and
Stanford Shopping Center. The Uni
versity's share, $37,000, comes from
the Special Transportation Fund.
Money for the fund comes from park
ing fees.
