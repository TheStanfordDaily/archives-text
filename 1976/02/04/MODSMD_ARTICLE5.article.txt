# Hearst judge lists prospective jurors
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —A final
pool of 36 prospects was selected yes
terday for the jury in Patricia Hearst's
trial on bank robbery charges.
# The selection of the 18 men and 18
women completed five days of
closed-door interrogation by the trial
judge. The next step will be challenges
by both sides — 12 for the defense and
eight for the prosecution — that will
leave the panel of 12 regular jurors and
four alternates.
If the peremptory challenges are
exercised as quickly as expected,
opening arguments in the much
publicized trial could begin this morn
ing — two years to the day after the
young defendant was kidnapped by
terrorists.
"It's a certainty that opening argu
ments will start tomorrow," chief de
fense attorney F. Lee Bailey declared.
Evening selection
The selection of the pool, closed to
the press last Wednesday, continued
into the early evening yesterday, the
longest court session since the trial got
under way a week ago.
During the afternoon, Hearst's
lawyers received court permission to
have her head x-rayed for possible in
juries sustained during her kidnaping
two years ago.
Attorney Albert Johnson told repor
ters that U.S. District Judge Oliver Car
ter had signed an order for Hearst to be
taken to the office of a Burl i nga me doc
tor for x-rays to be used for undis
closed "evidentiary purposes."
Possible fracture
Johnson would not comment
further, but Bailey said later that he

believed the x-rays "could show the
remnants of a fracture."
Asked if the examination might
show the young heiress suffered a
head injury when she was abducted by
terrorists in February 1974, as was re
ported at the time, Bailey said, "It
seems a fair possibility."
Bailey said earlier that he felt some
of "the best jurors" for her trial on bank
robbery and weapons charges may be
those who "can recite chapter and
verse" of her bizarre adventures in the
terrorist underground.
It was Feb. 4, 1974, a chilly, rainy
night, when Hearst, then 19, was drag
ged screaming from her Berkeley
apartment. The story of that night and
subsequent chapters in her violent
travels through the underground were
well known to most potential jurors
questioned, Bailey said.

Bailey, who had requested the secret
interrogation because of publicity,
said "very, very few" prospects were
dismissed because of exposure to re
ports on the case.
The prime concern of defense attor
neys, he said, is that the jurors eventu
ally sworn "have no fixed views on
intent."
The key to the defense case will be
the contention that Hearst was a vic
tim, not a volunteer, when she carried
a machine gun into the Hibernia Bank
on April 15,1974.
Bailey said that some potential
iurors interrogated in secret during
the five days were "more sympathetic
than you would imagine" toward
Hearst.
Members of the Hearst family were
again admitted to the secret sessions
yesterday.
