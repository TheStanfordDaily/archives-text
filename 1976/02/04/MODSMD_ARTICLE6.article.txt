# 'Quality' of research led to tenure denial

Standards for granting tenure to pro
fessors will not be toughened in the
next few years, President Richard
Lyman predicted last night on KZSU's
Campus Conference.
"There isn't a requisite number of
articles" that a professor must publish
to be assured tenure, Lyman said.
Both the 1972 and 1974 recipients of
the Gores Award for Excellence in
Teaching, former Asst. Religious
Studies Prof. Jerry Irish and Asst.
Sociology Prof. Anne McMahon, were
denied tenure allegedly because they
did not publish enough research mate
rial.
Lyman stressed that the quality of
research, and not the quantity, was
most important in tenure decisions.
Publishing one excellent article that
becomes a reference work and not
writing again for 20 years is preferable
to writing 20 articles that are not as
good or as comprehensive, he said.
Lyman emphasized that the system
for granting tenure was not as

mechanistic as students suppose. The
delicate question of weighing teaching
ability against research productivity
would "never be satisfactorily resol
ved," he added.
Lyman admitted that he knew of
professors who were granted tenure
because their research was excellent
even though their teaching was rated
"adequate or barely so."
Referring to McMahon and Irish, he
concluded that it would be a "tragic
irony" if winning the Gores Award
made professors more vulnerable to
being denied tenure.
Lyman said MacMahon's comments
regarding her negative tenure decision
were "admirable."
"I didn't see any sign of innuendo,"
he added.
Lyman said in the future there
would be "no arbitrary quota system"
for the number of junior faculty the
University would.
He acknowledged, however, that
budget cuts have already forced the
University to exercise extreme caution
in tenure decisions.
