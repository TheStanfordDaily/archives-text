# Med center immune to malpractice suits

Medical facilities here are appa
rently safe from any serious problems
stemming from the current malprac
tice controversy, according to Paul
Hofmann, director of the University
hospital and clinics.
"It is rather unlikely that slowdowns
will occur. Physicians at the Medical
Center are not insensitive to the situa
tion, but I doubt that any slowdown

will occur," Hofmann said.
Insurance costs for Medical School
faculty and staff have risen considera
bly in the past year. In January 1975,
insurance premiums at the Medical
Center increased by 100 percent, from
$200,000 to $400,000. This followed
by a $1 million increase in September
ot last year, and another $1 million
increase in November.
The University also pays the insur
ance for University-employed physi
cians at Cowell Student Health Center.
Most of the staff at Cowell is also
employed and insured by the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic.
Physicians protesting the rising cost
of insurance premiums have slowed
down medical services in the Los
Angeles area. Doctors there have
blamed lawyer's contingency fees for
the rising insurance costs.
Some Medical Center physicians
said they initially feared a slowdown
in Santa Clara County. However, they
now feel the chance of a slowdown is
slim.
No policy
Currently Cowell has no standing
policy concerning alternative health
services should a slowdown occur.
According to Director of Student
Health Services James McClenahan,
"The chances of a slowdown are so
remote, we have't even considered
what we would do if one occurred."
Cowell has had no problems with
malpractice suits, according to
McClenahan. "There are no current
malpractice suits against Cowell, and
to my knowledge, there have been
none in recent years," he said.
Physicians refused
Last year, about 50 Palo Alto physi
cians were refused the right to admit
patients to the Medical Center. They
refused to disclose to University offi
cials the amount of malpractice insur
ance they carried, which is required by
Medical Center bylaws.
The Medical Center requires insur
ance of $1 million on individual cases
and a $1 million aggregate coverage
per year for doctors who admit pa
tients.
Twelve of the suspended physicians
filed a suit in Santa Clara Superior
Court last fall to gain an injunction
against the suspension of their patient
admitting privileges. The motion for
an injunction was denied.
