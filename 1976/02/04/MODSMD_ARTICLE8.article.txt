## Military research protested 
### Bert Bower 
Approximately 50 demonstrators
marched outside Lockheed's re
search laboratory located in the
Stanford Industrial Park yesterday
to protest the corporation's $1.5
billion expenditures for research
and development of military hard
ware.
Members of the Mid-Peninsula
Conversion Project (MPCP), a coali
tion of community action groups
urging the conversion of the Santa
Clara County defense industry to
peaceful production, carried signs
reading "Preparing for war causes
war" and "Cut military spending —
not social services."
"We believe that the people who
work at Lockheed don't have re
sponsibility over what they're do
ing. We are encouraging workers to
challenge the big corporations,"
said MPCP spokesperson Natalie
Shiras.
The demonstrators urged Lock
heed employes to take a more ac
tive role in the determination of the
corporation's production policies
and suggested the laboratory de
velopment mass transit vehicles,
devices for the handicapped and
environmental technology instead
of military hardware.
