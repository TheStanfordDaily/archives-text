# Down on defense
## Military research protested 
### Bert Bower 
Approximately 50 demonstrators
marched outside Lockheed's re
search laboratory located in the
Stanford Industrial Park yesterday
to protest the corporation's $1.5
billion expenditures for research
and development of military hard
ware.
Members of the Mid-Peninsula
Conversion Project (MPCP), a coali
tion of community action groups
urging the conversion of the Santa
Clara County defense industry to
peaceful production, carried signs
reading "Preparing for war causes
war" and "Cut military spending —
not social services."
"We believe that the people who
work at Lockheed don't have re
sponsibility over what they're do
ing. We are encouraging workers to
challenge the big corporations,"
said MPCP spokesperson Natalie
Shiras.
The demonstrators urged Lock
heed employes to take a more ac
tive role in the determination of the
corporation's production policies
and suggested the laboratory de
velopment mass transit vehicles,
devices for the handicapped and
environmental technology instead
of military hardware.
Anti-war activist Daniel Ellsberg.

fired from his position at the Rand
Corporation for leaking the Pentagon
Papers in June 1071, accompanied the
demonstrators and spoke with Lock
heed employes as they arrived at
work.
"Lockheed doesn't have to use the
creative minds of its employes to build
vehicles, submarines and other trans
portation devices for nuclear
warheads," Ellsberg said.
He added that Lockheed employes
have the creative ability to develop
technology to serve humanity rather
than to wage war.
"This picket line is challenging the
employes to think of ways to use their
resources for the good of humanity. It's
absurd to think that taxpayers will
spend money for defense purposes
rather than for creative ways of solving
people's problems," he said.
Stanford students
A group of Stanford students also
participated in the demonstration.
Dave Stern, a senior in American
Studies, said, "A lot of Stanford stu
dents are technically trained for indus
tries that work for the military."
He added he would like to see this
training used for "human purposes
rather than military purposes."
Computer programmer Richard
Bennett was one of the Lockheed
employes that conversed with the de
monstrators.
Objectives good
"I think the group's objectives are
good because they make us think about
disarmament," said Bennett. He ad
ded, however, that the demonstration

probably would have little affect on
Lockheed's war production.
MPCP members told Lockheed
employes that the corporation's de
velopment of ballistic missiles, nuc
lear warheads and electronic systems
for war is destructive for three reasons:
—military spending keeps inflation
high and creates fewer jobs than civi
lian spending;
—the spiraling arms race is bringing
the world closer to a nuclear war;
—the defense industry uses dwindl
ing natural resources that could be
used to construct a better mass transit
system, low cost housing, non
polluting energy, etc.
After the demonstration the mar
chers proceeded to El Camino Heal and
Page Mill Road.
