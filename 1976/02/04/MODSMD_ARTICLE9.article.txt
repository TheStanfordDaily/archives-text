## Opinions Viewpoint 'Daily' ad policy 
### 
In today's Daily on page 4 appears an
ad placed by Gallo Wine Company. The
decision to accept this ad and six more
which will be published throughout
February and March was a difficult one
for which I assume full responsibility.
My private judgment would be to pro
tect the interests of those members of our
community who have the deepest per
sonal and political involvement with the
issues evoked by Gallo sales and, there
fore, refuse to run Gallo ads. However,
my position as Business Manager of the
Daily creates in me a duty to abide by the
Daily's ad policy.
This ad policy, operative since Au
tumn 1974 and unanimously re-affirmed
by the Board of Directors of the Stanford
Daily Publishing Corp. in its January
meeting states: "The Daily will accept all
advertising that is not libelous, obscene,
tending to incite to violence, or contain
ing an unfair racial stereotype."
I find no evidence of any of the above
enumerated qualities — which are re
quisite for refusal — in any of the ads to
be placed by Gallo.
What is needed and what has been
sought is an advertising policy commit

tee consisting of members of the Stan
ford community who have concern for
the character of advertising material
which should be excluded.
On Sept. 22, I sent letters request
ing representatives from a number of
campus organizations (including Al
liance for Radical Change, Students for
Equity and the Women's Center) to Tom
Massey of the Dean of Students' Office,
who assured me that he would distribute
these letters to leaders of these groups.
No one has responded, yet.
The issue, however, remains a live
one, as this series of Gallo advertise
ments indicates. For the present, the
Daily hopes to accommodate persons
and groups who find these Gallo Ads
offensive in two ways: (1) by providing
space on opinions pages; (2) by accept
ing responsive ads (please call me di
rectly).
For the future, a thoughtful advertis
ing policy is necessary. This can only be
accomplished through the efforts and
guidance of those who wish to see the
present ad policy changed.
