# Being gay: healthy or not?

They were killed under Jewish law. They were perse
cuted throughout the Middle Ages. They were
ridiculed, stereotyped, and outcast by modern soci
ety. They were declared mentally healthy only two years
ago. And only last month were gay people in California
declared legal.
Legal or not, the question remains among professionals
and non-professionals alike whether homosexuality is a
sickness.
In 1974, the American Psychiatric Association (APA)
officially scratched homosexuality from a list of "mental
disorders," after a bitter fight that resulted in a 60-40 per
cent vote. Many of the 40 percent still regard and treat
homosexuality as a disease.
One of the most outspoken minority members of the
psychiatric community is Dr. Irving Bieber, who claims to
have discovered a cure for homosexuality.
During the APA fight, Bieber used studies showing that

Dialogue:

' A special issue

homosexuals exhibit a vast difference in childhood de
velopment from heterosexuals in an attempt to prove gays
were abnormal. Other psychiatrists called the study a
"pack of lies" and said other studies were inconclusive on
the point.
Some psychiatrists even disagree on whether a vote
should have been taken.
Dr. Vincent D'Andrea, psychiatrist at Huston House,
opposed the whole principle of taking a vote on the issue.
He said it just "brings out polarities" rather than solving
anything.
Dr. James Paulsen, Psychiatrist at Cowell Student
Health Center, considers the vote necessary as a first step
to reverse the trend of oppressing gays. Paulsen says he is
"committed to moving away from sexual labeling."
Both D'Andrea and Paulsen agree that for some people
homosexuality is appropriate, but otherwise had very diffe
rent orientations.

Paulsen claims that homosex
uality is only a variation on the
theme of human sexuality and that
society ought to allow its members
the "freedom to choose" the orien
tation most appropriate for them
— be it homo-, hetero-, or bisexu
ality. "Psychiatry has not yet rec
ognized" the fact that all these var
iations are on a horizontal, equal,
level, he suggests.
Paulsen also contends that if all
persons functioned within their
"appropriate" orientation, each
sexual group would comprise ap
proximately one-third of the popu
lation.
If a person comes to Paulsen
expressing doubts about his own
sexuality, Paulsen attempts to
help that person find out for him
self what is "appropriate" for that
person. He comments that the
majority of people coming to him
with fears about being gay —
homophobia — are usually non
gay.
D'Andrea, on the other hand,
thinks that homosexuality is at
least "sometimes" a sickness that
can come from hereditary or
child-development causes. In
general, however, he looks upon it
as a behavior pattern, rather than
a sickness. For him, a person is
not a homosexual unless he prac
tices homosexuality — latent

homosexuality does not exist, he
says.
Defining the problem
When a person approaches
D'Andrea about sexual problems,
D'Andrea tries to find how that
person's sexuality is a problem for
him, and then focuses on that
problem to help the person.
Since homosexuality to
D Andrea is only a behavior pat
tern, he thinks, like many other
psychiatrists, it can be cured if the
person wants a cure. These cures
consist in his view of
psychoanalytic therapy or be
havior modification procedure,
which he feels can alter both the
thought and behavior of
homosexuals. But D'Andrea em
phasizes that if sexuality is not a
problem for a gay, then there is no
reason to view that person as ab
normal.
Psychiatrists aren't the only
ones divided on whether
homosexuality represents a sick
ness. Reference works also re
flect society's confusion over the
issue.
Smaller onus
Most recent dictionaries are
beginning to lift the onus of ab
normality from homosexuality,
commonly defining it as "manifes
tation of sexual desire towards
one's own sex" (Webster's New
Collegiate), while heterosexuality

is the exact opposite: "desire to
wards the opposite sex.'' This con
trasts with the older (Webster's
Unabridged) which characterizes
homosexuality as an "atypical
sexuality."
Other scholarly publications are
less charitable towards gays,
however. Encyclopaedia Brittani
ca's Macropaedia classifies
homosexuality as a sexual "devia
tion" and continues to list tour
hypotheses about causes, includ
ing "genetic aberrations," and ab
normal childhood development.
Outside the professional and
scholarly communities, there is
less dispute over how to classify
gays — Paulsen estimates 80
percent of Americans believe
homosexuality to be abnormal. To
the vast majority of Americans,
the gay remains a person to be
viewed with mistrust at best, vio
lence and hatred at worst.

ognized" the fact that all these var
iations are on a horizontal, equal,

Paulsen also contends that if all
persons functioned within their
"appropriate" orientation, each
sexual group would comprise ap
proximately one-third of the popu
lation.
If a person comes to Paulsen
expressing doubts about his own
sexuality, Paulsen attempts to
help that person find out for him
self what is "appropriate" for that
person. He comments that the
majority of people coming to him
with fears about being gay —
homophobia — are usually non
gay.
D'Andrea, on the other hand,
thinks that homosexuality is at
least "sometimes" a sickness that
can come from hereditary or
child-development causes. In
general, however, he looks upon it
as a behavior pattern, rather than
a sickness. For him, a person is
not a homosexual unless he prac
tices homosexuality — latent

homosexuality does not exist, he
says.
Defining the problem
When a person approaches
D'Andrea about sexual problems,
D'Andrea tries to find how that
person's sexuality is a problem for
him, and then focuses on that
problem to help the person.
Since homosexuality to
D Andrea is only a behavior pat
tern, he thinks, like many other
psychiatrists, it can be cured if the
person wants a cure. These cures
consist in his view of
psychoanalytic therapy or be
havior modification procedure,
which he feels can alter both the
thought and behavior of
homosexuals. But D'Andrea em
phasizes that if sexuality is not a
problem for a gay, then there is no
reason to view that person as ab
normal.
Psychiatrists aren't the only
ones divided on whether
homosexuality represents a sick
ness. Reference works also re
flect society's confusion over the
issue.
Smaller onus
Most recent dictionaries are
beginning to lift the onus of ab
normality from homosexuality,
commonly defining it as "manifes
tation of sexual desire towards
one's own sex" (Webster's New
Collegiate), while heterosexuality

is the exact opposite: "desire to
wards the opposite sex.'' This con
trasts with the older (Webster's
Unabridged) which characterizes
homosexuality as an "atypical
sexuality."
Other scholarly publications are
less charitable towards gays,
however. Encyclopaedia Brittani
ca's Macropaedia classifies
homosexuality as a sexual "devia
tion" and continues to list tour
hypotheses about causes, includ
ing "genetic aberrations," and ab
normal childhood development.
Outside the professional and
scholarly communities, there is
less dispute over how to classify
gays — Paulsen estimates 80
percent of Americans believe
homosexuality to be abnormal. To
the vast majority of Americans,
the gay remains a person to be
viewed with mistrust at best, vio
lence and hatred at worst.
They were killed under Jewish law. They were perse
cuted throughout the Middle Ages. They were
ridiculed, stereotyped, and outcast by modern soci
ety. They were declared mentally healthy only two years
ago. And only last month were gay people in California
declared legal.
Legal or not, the question remains among professionals
and non-professionals alike whether homosexuality is a
sickness.
In 1974, the American Psychiatric Association (APA)
officially scratched homosexuality from a list of "mental
disorders," after a bitter fight that resulted in a 60-40 per
cent vote. Many of the 40 percent still regard and treat
homosexuality as a disease.
One of the most outspoken minority members of the
psychiatric community is Dr. Irving Bieber, who claims to
have discovered a cure for homosexuality.
During the APA fight, Bieber used studies showing that

' A special issue

homosexuals exhibit a vast difference in childhood de
velopment from heterosexuals in an attempt to prove gays
were abnormal. Other psychiatrists called the study a
"pack of lies" and said other studies were inconclusive on
the point.
Some psychiatrists even disagree on whether a vote
should have been taken.
Dr. Vincent D'Andrea, psychiatrist at Huston House,
opposed the whole principle of taking a vote on the issue.
He said it just "brings out polarities" rather than solving
anything.
Dr. James Paulsen, Psychiatrist at Cowell Student
Health Center, considers the vote necessary as a first step
to reverse the trend of oppressing gays. Paulsen says he is
"committed to moving away from sexual labeling."
Both D'Andrea and Paulsen agree that for some people
homosexuality is appropriate, but otherwise had very diffe
rent orientations.

Paulsen claims that homosex
uality is only a variation on the
theme of human sexuality and that
society ought to allow its members
the "freedom to choose" the orien
tation most appropriate for them
— be it homo-, hetero-, or bisexu
ality. "Psychiatry has not yet rec

Outside the professional and

They were killed under Jewish law. They were perse
cuted throughout the Middle Ages. They were
ridiculed, stereotyped, and outcast by modern soci
ety. They were declared mentally healthy only two years
ago. And only last month were gay people in California
declared legal.
Legal or not, the question remains among professionals
and non-professionals alike whether homosexuality is a
sickness.
In 1974, the American Psychiatric Association (APA)
officially scratched homosexuality from a list of "mental
disorders," after a bitter fight that resulted in a 60-40 per
cent vote. Many of the 40 percent still regard and treat
homosexuality as a disease.
One of the most outspoken minority members of the
psychiatric community is Dr. Irving Bieber, who claims to
have discovered a cure for homosexuality.
During the APA fight, Bieber used studies showing that

' A special issue

homosexuals exhibit a vast difference in childhood de
velopment from heterosexuals in an attempt to prove gays
were abnormal. Other psychiatrists called the study a
"pack of lies" and said other studies were inconclusive on
the point.
Some psychiatrists even disagree on whether a vote
should have been taken.
Dr. Vincent D'Andrea, psychiatrist at Huston House,
opposed the whole principle of taking a vote on the issue.
He said it just "brings out polarities" rather than solving
anything.
Dr. James Paulsen, Psychiatrist at Cowell Student
Health Center, considers the vote necessary as a first step
to reverse the trend of oppressing gays. Paulsen says he is
"committed to moving away from sexual labeling."
Both D'Andrea and Paulsen agree that for some people
homosexuality is appropriate, but otherwise had very diffe
rent orientations.

Paulsen claims that homosex
uality is only a variation on the
theme of human sexuality and that
society ought to allow its members
the "freedom to choose" the orien
tation most appropriate for them
— be it homo-, hetero-, or bisexu
ality. "Psychiatry has not yet rec
ognized" the fact that all these var
iations are on a horizontal, equal,
level, he suggests.
Paulsen also contends that if all
persons functioned within their
"appropriate" orientation, each
sexual group would comprise ap
proximately one-third of the popu
lation.
If a person comes to Paulsen
expressing doubts about his own
sexuality, Paulsen attempts to
help that person find out for him
self what is "appropriate" for that
person. He comments that the
majority of people coming to him
with fears about being gay —
homophobia — are usually non
gay.
D'Andrea, on the other hand,
thinks that homosexuality is at
least "sometimes" a sickness that
can come from hereditary or
child-development causes. In
general, however, he looks upon it
as a behavior pattern, rather than
a sickness. For him, a person is
not a homosexual unless he prac
tices homosexuality — latent

homosexuality does not exist, he
says.
Defining the problem
When a person approaches
D'Andrea about sexual problems,
D'Andrea tries to find how that
person's sexuality is a problem for
him, and then focuses on that
problem to help the person.
Since homosexuality to
D Andrea is only a behavior pat
tern, he thinks, like many other
psychiatrists, it can be cured if the
person wants a cure. These cures
consist in his view of
psychoanalytic therapy or be
havior modification procedure,
which he feels can alter both the
thought and behavior of
homosexuals. But D'Andrea em
phasizes that if sexuality is not a
problem for a gay, then there is no
reason to view that person as ab
normal.
Psychiatrists aren't the only
ones divided on whether
homosexuality represents a sick
ness. Reference works also re
flect society's confusion over the
issue.
Smaller onus
Most recent dictionaries are
beginning to lift the onus of ab
normality from homosexuality,
commonly defining it as "manifes
tation of sexual desire towards
one's own sex" (Webster's New
Collegiate), while heterosexuality

is the exact opposite: "desire to
wards the opposite sex.'' This con
trasts with the older (Webster's
Unabridged) which characterizes
homosexuality as an "atypical
sexuality."
Other scholarly publications are
less charitable towards gays,
however. Encyclopaedia Brittani
