# Being gay: healthy or not?

They were killed under Jewish law. They were perse
cuted throughout the Middle Ages. They were
ridiculed, stereotyped, and outcast by modern soci

ago. And only last month were gay people in California
declared legal.
Legal or not, the question remains among professionals
and non-professionals alike whether homosexuality is a
sickness.
In 1974, the American Psychiatric Association (APA)
officially scratched homosexuality from a list of "mental
disorders," after a bitter fight that resulted in a 60-40 per
cent vote. Many of the 40 percent still regard and treat
homosexuality as a disease.
One of the most outspoken minority members of the
psychiatric community is Dr. Irving Bieber, who claims to
have discovered a cure for homosexuality.
During the APA fight, Bieber used studies showing that

homosexuals exhibit a vast difference in childhood de
velopment from heterosexuals in an attempt to prove gays
were abnormal. Other psychiatrists called the study a
"pack of lies" and said other studies were inconclusive on
the point.
Some psychiatrists even disagree on whether a vote
should have been taken.
Dr. Vincent D'Andrea, psychiatrist at Huston House,
opposed the whole principle of taking a vote on the issue.
He said it just "brings out polarities" rather than solving
anything.
Dr. James Paulsen, Psychiatrist at Cowell Student
Health Center, considers the vote necessary as a first step
to reverse the trend of oppressing gays. Paulsen says he is
"committed to moving away from sexual labeling."
Both D'Andrea and Paulsen agree that for some people
homosexuality is appropriate, but otherwise had very diffe
rent orientations.
