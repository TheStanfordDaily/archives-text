# Hayden urges popular coalition
## 
### Marc Strassman 
"The question before us is whether we'll
have a government controlled by the multi
national corporations or by American citi
zens," Tom Hayden told a crowd of 150
people Tuesday in the Tresidder Large
Lounge.
Hayden, a candidate for the California
senatorial nomination in June's Democratic
primary, said a viable popular coalition can
be organized against large corporations.
That coalition, he said, would be com
posed of labor opposed to multinational
corporations for exporting jobs, consumers
upset because firms may have escaped
regulation, anti-war groups upset by al
leged corporate misdeeds abroad and en
vironmentalists who believe the companies
have locked the United States into patterns
of high energy consumption and environ
mental destruction.
Fading influence
According to Hayden, the era in which
'the world was the backyard of the United
States" is ending. He said that "the cost of
maintaining American influence overseas
would be the elimination of democracy
within the United States, while maintaining
democracy domestically will mean restruc
turing the economy in profound ways."
Hayden said that employment, educa
tion, childcare, the environment and hous
ing are the country's most important needs
which must take precedence over the in
terests of corporations and the wealthy.
Federal spending priorities have to be
changed, Hayden said. He said that of 5350
million in federal funds that come to Palo
Alto, $187 million come for Department of
Ul ;nse work, while only $48,000 is allo
cated for solar research and $34,000 for

cancer research.
Defense spending in Los Angeles
County amounts to $4.4 billion annually, a
figure greater than the entire yearly budget
of the Environmental Protection Agency, he
said. Defense spending, he claimed, is in
herently inflationary, since it requires both
physical and human resources but pro
duces no consumer goods.
Abolishing the CIA
Hayden said that the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) could not be "reformed", and
that it should be abolished. He predicted,
however, that the CIA would not be
abolished and would engage in objectiona
ble activities within two years, after what he
called the period of "cosmetic reform" was
over.
"They play for keeps," he said.
Hayden termed Senate Bill 1, the prop
osed reform of the U.S. Criminal Code pre
sently before Congress, Richard Nixon s
"legal legacy."
He said the bill's recent appearance can
be linked to corporate support for a mea
sure which, he said, would help capitalists
in a struggle for economic and political con
trol of the United States.
Praise for engineers
He praised Richard Hubbard, Gregory
Minor and Dale Bridenbaugh, three former
General Electric nuclear engineers who re
cently resigned in protest over what they
said was the tremendous threat posed by
continued nuclear plant construction.
Comparing them to Daniel Ellsberg. who
released the Pentagon Papers in 1971, he
commented that there is a need for more
such actions by experts from within the nuc
lear establishmen which, he said, has been
deceiving the public.

Hayden proposed, as an alternative to
nuclear power, making California the center
for U.S. solar power particularly for heating
and cooling.
He said he has a "very gloomy view of
what will happen" in the Mideast this year,
and added that he favors giving Israel
enough assistance to defend itself, but not
enough to expand.
He said a bilateral Israeli-Palestinian
dialog offers the only route towards peace >

"The question before us is whether we'll
have a government controlled by the multi
national corporations or by American citi
zens," Tom Hayden told a crowd of 150
people Tuesday in the Tresidder Large
Lounge.
Hayden, a candidate for the California
senatorial nomination in June's Democratic
primary, said a viable popular coalition can
be organized against large corporations.
That coalition, he said, would be com
posed of labor opposed to multinational
corporations for exporting jobs, consumers
upset because firms may have escaped
regulation, anti-war groups upset by al
leged corporate misdeeds abroad and en
vironmentalists who believe the companies
have locked the United States into patterns
of high energy consumption and environ
mental destruction.
Fading influence
According to Hayden, the era in which
'the world was the backyard of the United
States" is ending. He said that "the cost of
maintaining American influence overseas
would be the elimination of democracy
within the United States, while maintaining
democracy domestically will mean restruc
turing the economy in profound ways."
Hayden said that employment, educa
tion, childcare, the environment and hous
ing are the country's most important needs
which must take precedence over the in
terests of corporations and the wealthy.
Federal spending priorities have to be
changed, Hayden said. He said that of 5350
million in federal funds that come to Palo
Alto, $187 million come for Department of
Ul ;nse work, while only $48,000 is allo
cated for solar research and $34,000 for

cancer research.
Defense spending in Los Angeles
County amounts to $4.4 billion annually, a
figure greater than the entire yearly budget
of the Environmental Protection Agency, he
said. Defense spending, he claimed, is in
herently inflationary, since it requires both
physical and human resources but pro
duces no consumer goods.
Abolishing the CIA
Hayden said that the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) could not be "reformed", and
that it should be abolished. He predicted,
however, that the CIA would not be
abolished and would engage in objectiona
ble activities within two years, after what he
called the period of "cosmetic reform" was
over.
"They play for keeps," he said.
Hayden termed Senate Bill 1, the prop
osed reform of the U.S. Criminal Code pre
sently before Congress, Richard Nixon s
"legal legacy."
He said the bill's recent appearance can
be linked to corporate support for a mea
sure which, he said, would help capitalists
in a struggle for economic and political con
trol of the United States.
Praise for engineers
He praised Richard Hubbard, Gregory
Minor and Dale Bridenbaugh, three former
General Electric nuclear engineers who re
cently resigned in protest over what they
said was the tremendous threat posed by
continued nuclear plant construction.
Comparing them to Daniel Ellsberg. who
released the Pentagon Papers in 1971, he
commented that there is a need for more
such actions by experts from within the nuc
lear establishmen which, he said, has been
deceiving the public.

Hayden proposed, as an alternative to
nuclear power, making California the center
for U.S. solar power particularly for heating
and cooling.
He said he has a "very gloomy view of
what will happen" in the Mideast this year,
and added that he favors giving Israel
enough assistance to defend itself, but not
enough to expand.
