Demonstrators at Chico State University
moved back into the entryway of the campus'
administration building yesterday following
arrests Monday night and a barring of protes
ters from the building Tuesday.
On Sunday the demonstrators who had
been holding a sit-in in an entryway for the

last few weeks, began to harass university
employes in offices adjoining the entryway.
Intimidating phone calls were made to uni
versity officials' homes on Sunday and Mon
day, according to Chico State Director of
University Relations Ed Masterson.
Masterson said the administration building
was then ordered closed from 11 p.m. to
7 a.m. beginning Monday. When campus
police arrived at the building Monday night to
enforce the closing they found about 150
students around the entryway. The two front
doors to the building were partially un
screwed, said Kim Weir,Chico State
Wildcat news editor.
Campus police then asked for assistance
from Chico city police and Butte County
sheriff's deputies. Weir said a scuffle then
followed between the police and the crowd in
which blows were exchanged.
The police then arrested 35 protesters on
misdemeanor citations for trespassing who
were released later that night. On Tuesday,
about 200 to 300 students held a rally and
then marched to the administration building
where they found the doors chained and
guarded.
Weir said the doors were unchained this
morning and about 10-15 students began to
occupy the entry in shifts. Students in the
entry were told not to be disruptive, and a ban
on sleeping bags or preparing food in that
area, was continued.
Masterson said students will be allowed to
remain in the entryway only between 7:30
a.m. and 11 p.m.
A meeting was scheduled between the
protesters and Chico State President Stan
ford Cazier at 5:30 p.m. yesterday.
The protest at Chico State began Dec. 3
over a decision to arm campus police
throughout the California State Universities
and Colleges system.
