# Tenure, student reactions keep gay profs in hiding
## 
### Mark Albertson 
In the early 19605, professors
who made their homosexuality
public were taking a huge risk.
Today, despite the estimates of
some that at least 10 percent of
the Stanford faculty is gay, Stan
ford s professors are still afraid to
come out,' and one reason is the
fear that it might cost them a shot
at tenure
"I'm afraid that when I come up
for tenure, there will be a little note
in my file that will say that I'm gay,
and I II be finished," worries one
assistant professor.
Another faculty member re
members the time when he first
informed a colleague that he was
gay "I wouldn't tell anyone else

that," his colleague warned him.
"It might cost you your job."
However, Arthur Bienenstock.
vice provost for faculty affairs,
scoffs at the worries of gay
professors. "It's not a significant
issue," Bienenstock says. "We're
looking for the best."
Many gays with academic ambi
tions agree that their homosexual
ity won't play a major role in pro
motion decisions.
Larry Goldyn. a graduate
student-teacher in political sci
ence, is not at all worried about
what his coming out might do to
his career Goldyn sees his open
ness as a form of protection and
feels that if the administration
wanted to fire him,"they would re

ally have to make a good case."
The fear of not getting tenure is
by no means the only reason gay
professors are hesitant to come
out openly.
One professor, who has tenure,
says that he is afraid of losing his
students and fears that a "wall"
would spring up between him and
his class if he were to announce
that he is gay.
"I don't want to ruin my ability to
reach students," he notes, and he
hopes that someone will get
around to taking a poll of Stanford
students to find out if they would
object to being taught by an
openly gay profssor. "Then I might
consider coming out," he says.
Other professors simply con
sider their sexual orientation un
important.
"I'm not going to walk into class
and announce that I have a 13-
inch cock.' quips one professor.
Another faculty member feels that
his being gay "is not relevant to
what I am teaching my students."
Most gay professors are quick
to label as a myth any notion that
gay academics are out to seduce
their students. Many view this
seduction as "unethical'' and "un
professional." "As a matter of
fact," muses one graduate stu
dent, "it's frequently the other way
around. The student ends up
seducing the teacher."
Nonetheless, homosexual rela
tionships between student and
teacher are not unheard of at
Stanford. "I don't think it's a myth
at all," one professor states flatly.
"I've had love affairs with three of
my students."
Some gay instructors feel they
are victims of a double standard
on this question. Goldyn, who is
himself "very cautious" about
gtting involved with any of his stu
dents, is quick to point out that
"straight" professors who have
sexual relations with their male
and female students, are merely
winked at by those in academe.
"If I were fired for having a rela
tionship with one of my students, I
would raise hell," Goldyn says.
"That's discrimination.

Because of their fears, gay pro
fessors at Stanford are seldom in
volved with gay activities on cam
pus. As one fa
culty member admits, "Most pro
fessors either live a celibate life, or
make the bar scene, period."
Gay faculty generally claim
Stanford offers them a fairly be
nign atmosphere. "I think the ad
ministration has moved to a much
more liberal position," one profes
sor comments, and others term
the University's attitude "admir
able."
Aside from an occasional "fag
joke" by members of their de
partment, gay professors have
encountered no hostility or overt
hasseling by "straight" colleagues
who know that they are gay.
As one professor says, "Stan
ford is a pretty safe place." "And I
intend," he adds quietly, "to stay
here for a while."

Other professors simply con

"I'm not going to walk into class

Another faculty member feels that

Most gay professors are quick
to label as a myth any notion that
gay academics are out to seduce
their students. Many view this
seduction as "unethical'' and "un
professional." "As a matter of
fact," muses one graduate stu
dent, "it's frequently the other way
around. The student ends up
seducing the teacher."
Nonetheless, homosexual rela
tionships between student and
teacher are not unheard of at
Stanford. "I don't think it's a myth
at all," one professor states flatly.
"I've had love affairs with three of
my students."
Some gay instructors feel they
are victims of a double standard
on this question. Goldyn, who is
himself "very cautious" about
gtting involved with any of his stu
dents, is quick to point out that
"straight" professors who have
sexual relations with their male
and female students, are merely
winked at by those in academe.
"If I were fired for having a rela
tionship with one of my students, I
would raise hell," Goldyn says.
"That's discrimination.

Because of their fears, gay pro
fessors at Stanford are seldom in
volved with gay activities on cam

culty member admits, "Most pro
fessors either live a celibate life, or
make the bar scene, period."
Gay faculty generally claim
Stanford offers them a fairly be
nign atmosphere. "I think the ad
ministration has moved to a much
more liberal position," one profes
sor comments, and others term
the University's attitude "admir
able."
Aside from an occasional "fag
joke" by members of their de
partment, gay professors have
encountered no hostility or overt
hasseling by "straight" colleagues
who know that they are gay.
As one professor says, "Stan
ford is a pretty safe place." "And I
intend," he adds quietly, "to stay
here for a while."
In the early 19605, professors
who made their homosexuality
public were taking a huge risk.
Today, despite the estimates of
some that at least 10 percent of
the Stanford faculty is gay, Stan
ford s professors are still afraid to
come out,' and one reason is the
fear that it might cost them a shot
at tenure
"I'm afraid that when I come up
for tenure, there will be a little note
in my file that will say that I'm gay,
and I II be finished," worries one
assistant professor.
Another faculty member re
members the time when he first
informed a colleague that he was
gay "I wouldn't tell anyone else

that," his colleague warned him.
"It might cost you your job."
However, Arthur Bienenstock.
vice provost for faculty affairs,
scoffs at the worries of gay
professors. "It's not a significant
issue," Bienenstock says. "We're
looking for the best."
Many gays with academic ambi
tions agree that their homosexual
ity won't play a major role in pro
motion decisions.
Larry Goldyn. a graduate
student-teacher in political sci
ence, is not at all worried about
what his coming out might do to
his career Goldyn sees his open
ness as a form of protection and
feels that if the administration
wanted to fire him,"they would re

The fear of not getting tenure is
by no means the only reason gay
professors are hesitant to come
out openly.
One professor, who has tenure,
says that he is afraid of losing his
students and fears that a "wall"
would spring up between him and
his class if he were to announce
that he is gay.
"I don't want to ruin my ability to
reach students," he notes, and he
hopes that someone will get
around to taking a poll of Stanford
students to find out if they would
object to being taught by an
openly gay profssor. "Then I might
