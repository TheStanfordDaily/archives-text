## Viewpoint Gay issue 
### 
Fear.
To one degree or another, almost all of us feel it when we
think of gay people.
The fear is so pervasive that two perfectly straight people
often hesitate to touch one another; so encompassing that
heterosexuals often can't discuss the subject without making
gays the victims of cruel barbs and insults.
The perplexing thing about our anxiety is that most of us
know few, if any, gay people at all, and very few at all have ever
been unwillingly accosted by a homosexual.
If most of us were asked, therefore, to explain our hostility
and discomfort towards gay people, we wouldn't be able to
answer. We simply prefer to sweep the question under the rug.
Despite our reluctance to deal with homosexuality, how
ever, we are fast losing that luxury. For in recent years, the gay
liberation movement has forced the question to be examined
by unwilling eyes.
Just two years ago, gays- through concerted action,
spurred the American Psychiatry Association to end its clas
sification of homosexuality as a sickness. Locally, they have
persuaded the Palo Alto School Board to abolish discrimina
tion against gays in the hiring of new teachers.
As the gay movement brings homosexuality more and more
into the open, we must not only ask ourselves how we stand
towards gays.
Our questions must be even more basic: who and what are
gay people? Are these people we have forced into hiding for so
long really different from the rest of us, and if so, how? Is
homosexuality really sick, or merely different?
If fear of gay people pervades our lives, it is because our
ignorance is so total. Only when we learn more about gays will
our fear subside. It is in the hope of spreading knowledge that
this special theme issue is dedicated.
