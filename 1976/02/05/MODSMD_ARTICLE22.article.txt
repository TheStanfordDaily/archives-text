# Gays, straights share similar social lives
## 
### Dave Ansley 
What do gay men and women
do on a Saturday night? Few
would feel comfortable dancing
together at a frat party or making
out in a movie theater. What kind
of social life is open to them?
Interestingly, the answer is that
once they attain enough privacy to
act naturally, gays do just about all
the things straight people do.
There are occasionally gay pri
vate parties held in houses
off-campus. The announcement
of it is passed around by word of
mouth, so only gays attend. The
idea is to give them a place they
can socialize with the same sex

without worrying about who sees
them.
Weekly meetings
The Gay People s Union holds
regular functions for homosexuals
as well. Both the Men's and Wo
men's Collectives have weekly
social meetings and rap groups
which include dancing and con
versation. They hold separate
monthly parties too.
Once the parties commence,
they are strikingly similar to their
heterosexual counterparts, with
much of the same dancing, hob
nobbing and fear of being re
jected.
The only real differences, in

most cases, is that the men and
women focus their attentions on
members of their own sex.
Playing it straight
A far less common option for
gay men and women is to play
straight and go to dances or par
ties with a gay member of the op
posite sex.
"If you look at us once, you think
we're together. But if you look
again, you realize we aren't," one
woman said.
"We spend an inordinate
amount of time checking out
people of the same sex. It's some
times a hassle," she claims,"if you
go alone just to enjoy the dancing,
because the guys there are trying
to meet girls."
More than parties
But gay social activities go far
beyond just parties.
For day-time activities, gays
usually find it easy to go hiking, to
the beach, bowling, biking, etc.
without drawing any unusual at
tention. People can't tell them
apart from straight men or women.
There are even gay athletic
teams. One of the slowpitch
softball teams in the Palo Alto
women's league "was organized
by gay women.'' said one of the
team members. "Our players
were predominantly lesbians, but
I'm sure there were gay women on
some of the other teams as well,"
she claimed.

Many of the gay bars in San
Francisco have teams which play
against each other. They compete
in basketball, softball and vol
leyball.
The bars, of course, are proba
bly the best known gay social in
stitution, and for many gays they
constitute a major nightlife hang
out. The City boasts dozens of
them, some with a single-sex
clientele, others open to both
sexes.
Relaxed atmosphere
The atmosphere in the wo
men's bars is fairly relaxed, ac
cording to one frequenter of such
establishments, "We're not there
with the specific intention of pick
ing up other women," she
explained.
"We go to look a lot and be with
our friends. That's partly because
of the way women are socialized.
If I wasn't so shy," she added,"l
would ask women for dates a
lot."
The men's bars are somewhat
different. "The atmosphere de
pends on the time of day,"
explained one homosexual, "dur
ing the afternoon, they look just
like any other place. At other
times, there's lots of cruising
going on."
Theme bars
There are three men's bars in
the Palo Alto area, but "they re
more like neighborhood bars. The

ones in San Francisco are more
theme oriented: college, freak,
butcn, leather, that sort of thing."
For those who want to go out for
a meal in a more comfortable at
mosphere, there are some gay
restaurants. "Straight people
sometimes go to them without
even realizing it's a gay place." he
continued. "But restaurants aren't
so much a place for cruising as
they are a place to take your
friends."
On the opposite end of the scale
are homosexual churches.
The Metropolitan Community
Church in San Jose, which is cur
rently fighting for admission to the
County Council of Churches, is
one of the few religious outlets for
gays who want to maintain religi
ous ties but have been rejected by
the more traditional churches.
