# Speaking out: Homosexuals talk
## 
### Charlie Hall 
While seme political issues
surrounding homosexuals
have recently received public
ity, gays themselves are often
forced to live a secretive exis
tence. hidden from the view of
heterosexuals.
The Stanford Daily, there
fore, interviewed three gays,
exploring their personal hopes
and anxieties.
DAILY: What is the hardest
thing about being gay these

days?
Luis: One of the biggest things is
the problem of parents.
DAILY: Have all of you told your
parents?
Ben: Eventually I will, but I don't
know when the best time will be.
Luis: No, I won't. It wouldn't do any
good. They're to the point where if
I tried to sit down and reason with
them, they d immediately write me
off.
Josh: My parents already know I
guess they figure there's nothing
they can do. I actually asked my

dad to send me to a shrink, be
cause I thought I was becoming a
homosexual and of course I was.
DAILY: How did you feel when
you discovered you were gay?
Ben: There were times when I d
feel that this part of me is okay, but
there were other times when I'd
feel some attraction to girls and I'd
think, "Well, I like this person, so
that means that I'm really not."
And I'd trick myself into believing
that. But there came a time when I
said that it's not going to change,
and this is what you are. I thought
it would ruin my life, that it would
ruin the kind of things my parents
had me programmed into.
Josh: When I was in junior high
school, I was doing a lot of young
type sexual things with this other
guy, but I thought, "Oh, well, it
doesn't matter." After a while in

Bth grade there was an open con
flict. I would try to suppress it. I
mean literally every day I'd keep
telling myself that I was straight.
This happened for about six
months until I went to a shrink, and
he told me there was nothing
wrong with being gay.
Ben: You know, there's also a time
when everybody says its a phase
you'll get over, but in my case it
never went away.
DAILY. Does al' the criticism and
joking of gays ever get to you?
Ben: When I hear five or six
negative things in one day that
might have a little negative effect
on my self-image. People make
jokes and you can't respond to
them.
Luis: I think that was true much
more of when I was coming out.
Now that I've established my sex

uality, it's almost intolerable to sit
there and listen to people and I
find myself more and more snap
ping back at them, saying things
like, "shut up, god damn it, you
don't know your ass from a hole in
the ground."
DAILY: Does the fear among
heterosexuals that you're
going to make a pass at them
ever gall you?
Ben: Yes, it does. I told my room
mate in the dorm, and he was
scared of me. He told me this after
a couple of weeks, when he was
used to me. He said he was afraid
of finding me in his bed one night,
and I said "This is ridiculous. What
makes you think I would want to
do that with you?"
Josh: People have these ideas,
and I think a lot of it is because
that's the way they are Upwards
women. That kind of conscious
ness is on their mind. They think,
"This is the way I'm supposed to
be with women, and that's the way
he's going to be with me."
DAILY: Do most of your friends
know you're gay?
Luis: My friends know; my ac
quaintances don't. That's how I
delineate.
Ben: I tried to avoid letting my ac
quaintances know, because if it
turns out that they could be poten
tial friends if I weren't gay, I'd
rather they not know.
That way, I can form a friend
ship, and if they don't like the fact
that I'm gay, they don't have to be
my friend. I don't like to cut them

off before they have a chance to
know me because lots of people
are prejudiced.
DAILY: How do you feel about
such stereotypes as the ef
feminate gay male? Do they
have any basis?
Ben: I'm sure some people do fit it,
but so what?
Luis: Those conceptions are one
of the reasons it was so difficult for
me to come out, because I
thought, "Gee, I don't want to be
like that."
After all, what did I know about
homosexualty? Only what I'd
been told by straight people or
teachers, and it was very negative
and very stereotypic.
Josh: And usually wrong.
DAILY: What differences do

you see between the gay and
straight social scene?
Ben: The gay scene seems more
straightforward to me. For exam
ple my roommate wanted to go out
with this girl, and, you know, he
wasn't sure how much she liked
him, and he didn't know what to
do.
Whereas, here, if you're gay, it's
a lot easier to just say, "Well, do
you want to go out?" There's not
so much stigma attached to being
rejected, because it happens so
frequently.
Luis: A lot of people think that
we're a very promiscuous lot, and
a lot of that has to do with the fact
that in a place like Texas, where I
come from, the only place where
you can meet other gays is in a
bar.
And so you're automatically put
in a position where you have to lay
it all on the line sort of like, "Gee,
do you want to go home with me
for some sex?" Straight people
don't seem to realize that they can
meet straight women and men at
every hour of the day, and for us
it's not all that easy.
Ben: It's probably the same kind of
situation for straight people at a
singles bar as it is for gay people
at a gay bar. It's exactly the same
kind of thing.
DAILY: How do you feel about
the notion that homosexualiy is
a lot more oriented to sex?
Ben: I think it depends a lot on the
person.
Luis: I do think one of the things
that gay men suffer from is the
same thing that straight men suf
fer from, in the sense that the
socialization processes tells you
not to express yourself. I do think
that gay men sometimes do have
trouble expressing themselves
emotionally.
DAILY: Are any of you in
terested in a long term gay rela

tionship?
Ben: Yeah.
Luis: I've got a lover, and we've
been together for almost a year,
and I hope it lasts. As far as I can
tell, it will.
Josh: I had sort of an attachment
to one guy for a while. It was pretty
thin, though. There wasn't much
basis for it. I wouldn't mind having
a very close friendship with sex.
DAILY: What do you feel when
you think about women sexu
ally?
Luis: A real void. I've had oppor
tunities for a sexual encounter
with women, but it's just never
been there, and it's been obvious
to them as well as to me.
Josh: That's true of me. I haven't
ever fantasized about it con
sciously, but i have dreamt about

women very occasionally. It's a bit
strange. I bet it'd be the same if a
straight man dreamed about other
men.
DAILY: Is there anything you'd
like people to know about
gays?
Ben: Since most of the under
graduates live in the dorms, I
thought it would be interesting for
people reading to know there are
some people in the dorms who are
gay, and that it's not that big a
deal. You know, it's almost nor
mal.
DAILY: Do you have any realis
tic hope of ever living in a situa
tion where gay people are ac
cepted?
Luis: (laughing) Yeh, living in San
Francisco. There, you're almost
abnormal if you're not gay.

Ben: I think it depends a lot on the
person.

socialization processes tells you
not to express yourself. I do think

Ben: Yeah.
Luis: I've got a lover, and we've
been together for almost a year,
and I hope it lasts. As far as I can
tell, it will.
Josh: I had sort of an attachment
to one guy for a while. It was pretty
thin, though. There wasn't much
basis for it. I wouldn't mind having
a very close friendship with sex.
DAILY: What do you feel when
you think about women sexu
ally?
Luis: A real void. I've had oppor

with women, but it's just never
been there, and it's been obvious
to them as well as to me.
Josh: That's true of me. I haven't
ever fantasized about it con

women very occasionally. It's a bit
strange. I bet it'd be the same if a
straight man dreamed about other
men.
DAILY: Is there anything you'd
like people to know about
gays?
Ben: Since most of the under
graduates live in the dorms, I
thought it would be interesting for
people reading to know there are
some people in the dorms who are
gay, and that it's not that big a
deal. You know, it's almost nor

DAILY: What is the hardest

Luis: One of the biggest things is
the problem of parents.
DAILY: Have all of you told your
parents?
Ben: Eventually I will, but I don't
know when the best time will be.
Luis: No, I won't. It wouldn't do any
good. They're to the point where if
I tried to sit down and reason with
them, they d immediately write me
off.
Josh: My parents already know I
guess they figure there's nothing
they can do. I actually asked my

dad to send me to a shrink, be
cause I thought I was becoming a
homosexual and of course I was.
DAILY: How did you feel when
you discovered you were gay?
Ben: There were times when I d
feel that this part of me is okay, but
there were other times when I'd
feel some attraction to girls and I'd
think, "Well, I like this person, so
that means that I'm really not."
And I'd trick myself into believing
that. But there came a time when I
said that it's not going to change,
and this is what you are. I thought
it would ruin my life, that it would
ruin the kind of things my parents
had me programmed into.
Josh: When I was in junior high
school, I was doing a lot of young
type sexual things with this other
guy, but I thought, "Oh, well, it
doesn't matter." After a while in

Bth grade there was an open con
flict. I would try to suppress it. I
mean literally every day I'd keep
telling myself that I was straight.
This happened for about six
months until I went to a shrink, and
he told me there was nothing
wrong with being gay.
Ben: You know, there's also a time
when everybody says its a phase
you'll get over, but in my case it
never went away.
DAILY. Does al' the criticism and
joking of gays ever get to you?
Ben: When I hear five or six
negative things in one day that
might have a little negative effect
on my self-image. People make
jokes and you can't respond to
them.
Luis: I think that was true much
more of when I was coming out.
Now that I've established my sex

uality, it's almost intolerable to sit
there and listen to people and I
find myself more and more snap
ping back at them, saying things
like, "shut up, god damn it, you
don't know your ass from a hole in
the ground."
DAILY: Does the fear among
heterosexuals that you're
going to make a pass at them
ever gall you?
Ben: Yes, it does. I told my room
mate in the dorm, and he was
scared of me. He told me this after
a couple of weeks, when he was
used to me. He said he was afraid
of finding me in his bed one night,
and I said "This is ridiculous. What
makes you think I would want to
do that with you?"
Josh: People have these ideas,
and I think a lot of it is because
that's the way they are Upwards
women. That kind of conscious
ness is on their mind. They think,
"This is the way I'm supposed to
be with women, and that's the way
he's going to be with me."
DAILY: Do most of your friends
know you're gay?
Luis: My friends know; my ac
quaintances don't. That's how I
delineate.
Ben: I tried to avoid letting my ac
quaintances know, because if it
turns out that they could be poten
tial friends if I weren't gay, I'd
rather they not know.
That way, I can form a friend
ship, and if they don't like the fact
that I'm gay, they don't have to be
my friend. I don't like to cut them

off before they have a chance to
know me because lots of people
are prejudiced.
DAILY: How do you feel about
such stereotypes as the ef
feminate gay male? Do they
have any basis?
Ben: I'm sure some people do fit it,
but so what?
Luis: Those conceptions are one
of the reasons it was so difficult for
me to come out, because I
thought, "Gee, I don't want to be
like that."
After all, what did I know about
homosexualty? Only what I'd
been told by straight people or
teachers, and it was very negative
and very stereotypic.
Josh: And usually wrong.
DAILY: What differences do

you see between the gay and
straight social scene?
Ben: The gay scene seems more
straightforward to me. For exam
ple my roommate wanted to go out
with this girl, and, you know, he
wasn't sure how much she liked
him, and he didn't know what to
do.
Whereas, here, if you're gay, it's
a lot easier to just say, "Well, do
you want to go out?" There's not
so much stigma attached to being
rejected, because it happens so
frequently.
Luis: A lot of people think that
we're a very promiscuous lot, and
a lot of that has to do with the fact
that in a place like Texas, where I
come from, the only place where
you can meet other gays is in a
bar.
And so you're automatically put
in a position where you have to lay
it all on the line sort of like, "Gee,
do you want to go home with me
for some sex?" Straight people
don't seem to realize that they can
meet straight women and men at
every hour of the day, and for us
it's not all that easy.
Ben: It's probably the same kind of
situation for straight people at a
singles bar as it is for gay people
at a gay bar. It's exactly the same
kind of thing.
DAILY: How do you feel about

feminate gay male? Do they
have any basis?
Ben: I'm sure some people do fit it,
but so what?
Luis: Those conceptions are one
of the reasons it was so difficult for
me to come out, because I
thought, "Gee, I don't want to be
like that."
After all, what did I know about
homosexualty? Only what I'd
been told by straight people or
teachers, and it was very negative
and very stereotypic.
Josh: And usually wrong.
DAILY: What differences do

you see between the gay and
straight social scene?
Ben: The gay scene seems more
straightforward to me. For exam
ple my roommate wanted to go out
with this girl, and, you know, he
wasn't sure how much she liked
him, and he didn't know what to
do.
Whereas, here, if you're gay, it's
a lot easier to just say, "Well, do
you want to go out?" There's not
so much stigma attached to being
rejected, because it happens so
frequently.
Luis: A lot of people think that
we're a very promiscuous lot, and
a lot of that has to do with the fact
that in a place like Texas, where I
come from, the only place where
you can meet other gays is in a
bar.
And so you're automatically put
in a position where you have to lay
it all on the line sort of like, "Gee,
do you want to go home with me
for some sex?" Straight people
don't seem to realize that they can
meet straight women and men at
every hour of the day, and for us
it's not all that easy.
Ben: It's probably the same kind of
situation for straight people at a
singles bar as it is for gay people
at a gay bar. It's exactly the same
kind of thing.
DAILY: How do you feel about
the notion that homosexualiy is
a lot more oriented to sex?
Ben: I think it depends a lot on the

Luis: I do think one of the things

emotionally.
DAILY: Are any of you in
terested in a long term gay rela

tionship?
Ben: Yeah.
Luis: I've got a lover, and we've
been together for almost a year,
and I hope it lasts. As far as I can
tell, it will.
Josh: I had sort of an attachment
to one guy for a while. It was pretty
thin, though. There wasn't much
basis for it. I wouldn't mind having
a very close friendship with sex.
DAILY: What do you feel when
you think about women sexu

Luis: A real void. I've had oppor

with women, but it's just never

Josh: That's true of me. I haven't
ever fantasized about it con

women very occasionally. It's a bit
strange. I bet it'd be the same if a
straight man dreamed about other
men.
DAILY: Is there anything you'd
like people to know about
gays?
Ben: Since most of the under
graduates live in the dorms, I
thought it would be interesting for
people reading to know there are
some people in the dorms who are
gay, and that it's not that big a
deal. You know, it's almost nor

the problem of parents.
DAILY: Have all of you told your
parents?
Ben: Eventually I will, but I don't
know when the best time will be.
Luis: No, I won't. It wouldn't do any
good. They're to the point where if
I tried to sit down and reason with
them, they d immediately write me
off.
Josh: My parents already know I
guess they figure there's nothing
they can do. I actually asked my

dad to send me to a shrink, be
cause I thought I was becoming a
homosexual and of course I was.
DAILY: How did you feel when
you discovered you were gay?
Ben: There were times when I d
feel that this part of me is okay, but
there were other times when I'd
feel some attraction to girls and I'd
think, "Well, I like this person, so
that means that I'm really not."
And I'd trick myself into believing
that. But there came a time when I
said that it's not going to change,
and this is what you are. I thought
it would ruin my life, that it would
ruin the kind of things my parents
had me programmed into.
Josh: When I was in junior high
school, I was doing a lot of young
type sexual things with this other
guy, but I thought, "Oh, well, it
doesn't matter." After a while in

Bth grade there was an open con
flict. I would try to suppress it. I
mean literally every day I'd keep
telling myself that I was straight.
This happened for about six
months until I went to a shrink, and
he told me there was nothing
wrong with being gay.
Ben: You know, there's also a time
when everybody says its a phase
you'll get over, but in my case it
never went away.
DAILY. Does al' the criticism and
joking of gays ever get to you?
Ben: When I hear five or six
negative things in one day that
might have a little negative effect
on my self-image. People make
jokes and you can't respond to
them.
Luis: I think that was true much
more of when I was coming out.
Now that I've established my sex

uality, it's almost intolerable to sit
there and listen to people and I
find myself more and more snap
ping back at them, saying things
like, "shut up, god damn it, you
don't know your ass from a hole in
the ground."
DAILY: Does the fear among
heterosexuals that you're
going to make a pass at them
ever gall you?
Ben: Yes, it does. I told my room
mate in the dorm, and he was
scared of me. He told me this after
a couple of weeks, when he was
used to me. He said he was afraid
of finding me in his bed one night,
and I said "This is ridiculous. What
makes you think I would want to
do that with you?"
Josh: People have these ideas,
and I think a lot of it is because
that's the way they are Upwards
women. That kind of conscious
ness is on their mind. They think,
"This is the way I'm supposed to
be with women, and that's the way
he's going to be with me."
DAILY: Do most of your friends
know you're gay?
Luis: My friends know; my ac
quaintances don't. That's how I
delineate.
Ben: I tried to avoid letting my ac
quaintances know, because if it
turns out that they could be poten
tial friends if I weren't gay, I'd
rather they not know.
That way, I can form a friend
ship, and if they don't like the fact
that I'm gay, they don't have to be
my friend. I don't like to cut them

off before they have a chance to
know me because lots of people
are prejudiced.
DAILY: How do you feel about

on my self-image. People make
jokes and you can't respond to
them.
Luis: I think that was true much
more of when I was coming out.
Now that I've established my sex

uality, it's almost intolerable to sit
there and listen to people and I
find myself more and more snap
ping back at them, saying things
like, "shut up, god damn it, you
don't know your ass from a hole in
the ground."
DAILY: Does the fear among
heterosexuals that you're
going to make a pass at them
ever gall you?
Ben: Yes, it does. I told my room
mate in the dorm, and he was
scared of me. He told me this after
a couple of weeks, when he was
used to me. He said he was afraid
of finding me in his bed one night,
and I said "This is ridiculous. What
makes you think I would want to
do that with you?"
Josh: People have these ideas,
and I think a lot of it is because
that's the way they are Upwards
women. That kind of conscious
ness is on their mind. They think,
"This is the way I'm supposed to
be with women, and that's the way
he's going to be with me."
DAILY: Do most of your friends
know you're gay?
Luis: My friends know; my ac
quaintances don't. That's how I
delineate.
Ben: I tried to avoid letting my ac
quaintances know, because if it
turns out that they could be poten
tial friends if I weren't gay, I'd
rather they not know.
That way, I can form a friend
ship, and if they don't like the fact
that I'm gay, they don't have to be
my friend. I don't like to cut them

off before they have a chance to
know me because lots of people
are prejudiced.
DAILY: How do you feel about
such stereotypes as the ef
feminate gay male? Do they
have any basis?
Ben: I'm sure some people do fit it,
but so what?
Luis: Those conceptions are one
of the reasons it was so difficult for
me to come out, because I
thought, "Gee, I don't want to be
like that."
After all, what did I know about
homosexualty? Only what I'd
been told by straight people or
teachers, and it was very negative
and very stereotypic.
Josh: And usually wrong.
DAILY: What differences do

you see between the gay and
straight social scene?
Ben: The gay scene seems more
straightforward to me. For exam
ple my roommate wanted to go out
with this girl, and, you know, he
wasn't sure how much she liked
him, and he didn't know what to
do.
Whereas, here, if you're gay, it's
a lot easier to just say, "Well, do
you want to go out?" There's not
so much stigma attached to being
rejected, because it happens so
frequently.
Luis: A lot of people think that
we're a very promiscuous lot, and
a lot of that has to do with the fact
that in a place like Texas, where I
come from, the only place where
you can meet other gays is in a
bar.
And so you're automatically put
in a position where you have to lay
it all on the line sort of like, "Gee,
do you want to go home with me
for some sex?" Straight people
don't seem to realize that they can
meet straight women and men at
every hour of the day, and for us
it's not all that easy.
Ben: It's probably the same kind of
situation for straight people at a
singles bar as it is for gay people
at a gay bar. It's exactly the same
kind of thing.
DAILY: How do you feel about
the notion that homosexualiy is
a lot more oriented to sex?
Ben: I think it depends a lot on the
person.
Luis: I do think one of the things
that gay men suffer from is the
same thing that straight men suf
fer from, in the sense that the
socialization processes tells you
not to express yourself. I do think
that gay men sometimes do have
trouble expressing themselves
emotionally.
DAILY: Are any of you in
terested in a long term gay rela

tionship?
Ben: Yeah.
Luis: I've got a lover, and we've
been together for almost a year,
and I hope it lasts. As far as I can
tell, it will.
Josh: I had sort of an attachment
to one guy for a while. It was pretty
thin, though. There wasn't much
basis for it. I wouldn't mind having
a very close friendship with sex.
DAILY: What do you feel when
you think about women sexu
ally?
Luis: A real void. I've had oppor
tunities for a sexual encounter
with women, but it's just never
been there, and it's been obvious
to them as well as to me.
Josh: That's true of me. I haven't
ever fantasized about it con
sciously, but i have dreamt about

women very occasionally. It's a bit
strange. I bet it'd be the same if a
straight man dreamed about other
men.
DAILY: Is there anything you'd
like people to know about
gays?
Ben: Since most of the under
graduates live in the dorms, I
thought it would be interesting for
people reading to know there are
some people in the dorms who are
gay, and that it's not that big a
deal. You know, it's almost nor
mal.
DAILY: Do you have any realis
tic hope of ever living in a situa
tion where gay people are ac
cepted?
Luis: (laughing) Yeh, living in San
Francisco. There, you're almost
abnormal if you're not gay.
While seme political issues
surrounding homosexuals
have recently received public
ity, gays themselves are often
forced to live a secretive exis
tence. hidden from the view of
heterosexuals.
The Stanford Daily, there
fore, interviewed three gays,
exploring their personal hopes
and anxieties.
DAILY: What is the hardest
thing about being gay these

days?
Luis: One of the biggest things is
the problem of parents.
DAILY: Have all of you told your
parents?
Ben: Eventually I will, but I don't
know when the best time will be.
Luis: No, I won't. It wouldn't do any
good. They're to the point where if
I tried to sit down and reason with
them, they d immediately write me
off.
Josh: My parents already know I
guess they figure there's nothing
they can do. I actually asked my

dad to send me to a shrink, be
cause I thought I was becoming a
homosexual and of course I was.
DAILY: How did you feel when
you discovered you were gay?
Ben: There were times when I d
feel that this part of me is okay, but
there were other times when I'd
feel some attraction to girls and I'd
think, "Well, I like this person, so
that means that I'm really not."
And I'd trick myself into believing
that. But there came a time when I
said that it's not going to change,
and this is what you are. I thought
it would ruin my life, that it would
ruin the kind of things my parents
had me programmed into.
Josh: When I was in junior high
school, I was doing a lot of young
type sexual things with this other
guy, but I thought, "Oh, well, it
doesn't matter." After a while in

Bth grade there was an open con
flict. I would try to suppress it. I
mean literally every day I'd keep
telling myself that I was straight.
This happened for about six
months until I went to a shrink, and
he told me there was nothing
wrong with being gay.
Ben: You know, there's also a time
when everybody says its a phase
you'll get over, but in my case it
never went away.
DAILY. Does al' the criticism and
joking of gays ever get to you?
Ben: When I hear five or six
negative things in one day that
might have a little negative effect
on my self-image. People make
jokes and you can't respond to
them.
Luis: I think that was true much
