# Speaking out: Homosexuals talk
## 
### Charlie Hall 
While seme political issues
surrounding homosexuals
have recently received public
ity, gays themselves are often
forced to live a secretive exis
tence. hidden from the view of
heterosexuals.
The Stanford Daily, there
fore, interviewed three gays,
exploring their personal hopes
and anxieties.
DAILY: What is the hardest
thing about being gay these

days?
Luis: One of the biggest things is
the problem of parents.
DAILY: Have all of you told your
parents?
Ben: Eventually I will, but I don't
know when the best time will be.
Luis: No, I won't. It wouldn't do any
good. They're to the point where if
I tried to sit down and reason with
them, they d immediately write me
off.
Josh: My parents already know I
guess they figure there's nothing
they can do. I actually asked my

dad to send me to a shrink, be
cause I thought I was becoming a
homosexual and of course I was.
DAILY: How did you feel when
you discovered you were gay?
Ben: There were times when I d
feel that this part of me is okay, but
there were other times when I'd
feel some attraction to girls and I'd
think, "Well, I like this person, so
that means that I'm really not."
And I'd trick myself into believing
that. But there came a time when I
said that it's not going to change,
and this is what you are. I thought
it would ruin my life, that it would
ruin the kind of things my parents
had me programmed into.
Josh: When I was in junior high
school, I was doing a lot of young
type sexual things with this other
guy, but I thought, "Oh, well, it
doesn't matter." After a while in

Bth grade there was an open con
flict. I would try to suppress it. I
mean literally every day I'd keep
telling myself that I was straight.
This happened for about six
months until I went to a shrink, and
he told me there was nothing
wrong with being gay.
Ben: You know, there's also a time
when everybody says its a phase
you'll get over, but in my case it
never went away.
DAILY. Does al' the criticism and
joking of gays ever get to you?
Ben: When I hear five or six
negative things in one day that
might have a little negative effect
on my self-image. People make
jokes and you can't respond to
them.
Luis: I think that was true much
more of when I was coming out.
Now that I've established my sex

uality, it's almost intolerable to sit
there and listen to people and I
find myself more and more snap
ping back at them, saying things
like, "shut up, god damn it, you
don't know your ass from a hole in
the ground."
DAILY: Does the fear among
heterosexuals that you're
going to make a pass at them
ever gall you?
Ben: Yes, it does. I told my room
mate in the dorm, and he was
scared of me. He told me this after
a couple of weeks, when he was
used to me. He said he was afraid
of finding me in his bed one night,
and I said "This is ridiculous. What
makes you think I would want to
do that with you?"
Josh: People have these ideas,
and I think a lot of it is because
