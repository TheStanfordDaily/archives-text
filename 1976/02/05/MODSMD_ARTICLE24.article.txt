# Gays feared by straights
## Homophobia: a 'social ill' 
### Kathryn Ma 
In Greenwich Village, New
York, a gang may stop a man on
the street. If he tells them he is
gay, he won't move on until they
have senselessly beaten him.
On the playground at a local
elementary school, six third
graders tease their crying
classmate, shouting "coward!"
and "faggot!" The other children
gather round to join in the jeering.
These are both examples of
how homophobia, or the fear of
homosexuals and homosexuality,
is manifest in our society. Vio
lence and ridicule directed to
wards homosexuals may be the
symptoms of what Lynne Sarafian
of the Gay People's Union calls "a
social disease."
"It is a horror of not being 'nor
mal'," says Sarafian. She has
seen people feel "revulsion" when
they are forced to deal with
homosexuality because "it goes
against all that we learned as chil-.
dren."
Two types
Dr. James Paulsen, a psychiat
rist at Cowell Student Health
Center, describes two types of
"homophobes."
"There is the pre-conscious'
homophobe, who has a hostile at
titude towards homosexuals,"

Paulsen explains. These are the
people who react violently by beat
ing up gays or calling them
names.
The conscious' nomophobe is
afraid that he (or she) is
homosexual and may go to ex
cessive means to diminish this
fear. He will avoid close physical
contact with people of the same
sex, trying to convince others and
himself that he is not gay.
Fear widespread
Paulsen contends that
homophobia exists on our cam
pus and at every level of society.
"Many students are
homophobic," he says. "Their
own fears are projected onto a
minority group," in this case, the
gay community.
Paulsen says "their apparent
fear arises out of not meeting the
stereotypes of society," which
create well-defined pictures of
masculinity and feminity. The
roots of these stereotypes lie in
several sources.
"From the parents," says
Paulsen, "can come the fear that a
boy is not aggressive enough, or a
girl is not tender or gentle enough"
to conform to traditional roles.
"From the peer groups, there is a
relentless amount of teasing and
torment. The state has laws which

range from almost liberal to per
secutory."
"The (Roman Catholic) Church
considers homosexuality a sin,"
Paulsen notes. "If a student is re
ligious, he would feel the con
demnation of the Church. This can
provoke guilt as well as fear."
Myths maintained
Many other social institutions
perpetuate the negative, often
hostile attitude towards gays, as
well as certain myths. "Many
people think that all homosexuals
want to go to bed with them," says
Frank Fitch of the Gay People's
Union (GPU).
Fitch maintains that gays have
personal preferences just like
heterosexuals.
"Being approached sexually
can be a terrifying experience,"
says Paulsen. He will counsel a
homophobe to "share his fear with
other people and perhaps attend a
social meeting at the GPU."
Paulsen feels it is important that
people can feel free to come and
share their fears. Often the pro
fessional counselor is the first
person a homophobe will speak
to, and in most of Paulsen's ex
periences, the homophobia has
existed for over four years.
