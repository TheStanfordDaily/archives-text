## 'Barry Lyndon': a boring movie 
### Howard Baldwin 
There are times when reading
the rave reviews of Stanley Kub
rick's Barry Lyndon that I can't
help wondering if I saw the same
version of the movie as the others.
The film I saw, rather than being a
masterpiece, was perhaps the dul
lest three hours I've spent since
The King of Marvin Gardens.
It's the kind of movie that makes
you think when it's over, "I can't
believe I paid money to see that."
Kubrick consciously con
structed Barry Lyndon to be slow.
However, there is a very delicate
line between slow and moving as
quickly as the hands of a clock.
Kubrick has overstepped this deli
cate line as if leaping over a cliff.
Both Papillon and Nicholas
and Alexandra were slow
moving and yet overall well-done
movies. Barry Lyndon is simply
the rambling inch-by-inch chroni
cle of the rise and fall of a 17th
century scoundrel. If it moved any
slower, it would go backwards.
Museum trip
The film resembles a trip
through a museum. Each scene is
beautifully lush and colorful,
filmed on locations of spectacular
magnificance, so awesome as to
often dwarf the actors.
Kubrick spends interminable
periods slowly zooming in on or
back from these pretty pictures he
is obsessed with. The problem
with these beautiful portraits that
cost $11 million is that they don't
move.
The entire three-hours-plus is a
vision of figures and landscapes.
The dialogue (screenplay also
by Kubrick, from the William
Makepeace Thackeray novel) is
rife with pauses, the movements
lethargic. If every unnecessary
pause had been deleted, Barry
Lyndon could have been a 76-
minute ABC Movie of the Week.
Casting
Casting Ryan O'Neal as Barry
Lyndon was as brilliant as casting
handsome James Caan as
homely Billy Rose in Funny Lady.
O'Neal is uncomfortably and
obviously far away from his territ
ory as a comic actor (Paper Moon,
The Thief Who Came To Dinner).
He is as much an art object as the
sets â€” emotionless and expres
sionless.
It is the same for Marisa Beren
son, as his wife Lady Lyndon. She
has approximately a dozen lines
in the entire movie, and spends
her time looking as expression
less and unappealing as O'Neal.

It is as if they and the castles
and the lakes and the trees are
nothing more than chess pieces
being filmed and occasionally
placed in different surroundings
by Kubrick.
And if you think it's fun watching
two statues (plaster rather than
marble, at that) for three hours,
think again. It's not even slightly
interesting.
The few scenes which do con
tain physical movement are so
few and far between that by their
sheer presence they draw atten
tion to themselves and draw the
viewer even further out of the
story.
When a film's main character is
as unfeeling and despicable as
Barry Lyndon, spending three
hours with such a person can be
not only unappreciated, but boring
as well. One doesn't care about
Barry Lyndon, the scoundrel, and
very quickly loses interest in Barry
Lyndon, the film.
It's not very likely that I saw a
different version than the other cri
tics. All I know is that when I saw it,
a third of the audience invited to
see it (which presumes their con
nection with the industry) walked
out at intermission and didn't
bother coming back.
