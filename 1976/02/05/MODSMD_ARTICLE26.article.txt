# Sepia-toned period piece
## 'Hester Street' appealing 
### Ann Hoffman 
Hester Street, a cinematic ac
count of a Russian family's immig
ration to New York City in the
1890s, attempts above all to give
the viewer a sense of watching a
sepia-toned photograph in mo
tion. This effort at re-creating the
past accounts for both the
strengths and weaknesses of this
fondly made "period" piece.
Like an old, faded photograph,
Hester Street is somewhat limited
in the scope and depth of its vis
ion, yet it derives most of its ap
peal from an ability to explore the
historical past through an im
aginative photographic memory.
Written and directed by inde
pendent filmmaker Joan Silver,
Hester Street deals with the de
velopment of a young Jewish im
migrant, Gitl (played by Carol
Kane), who comes to New York to
join her already fully
Americanized husband, Jake
(played by Steven Keats).
Old world ways
Jake, however, has so
thoroughly embraced his new role
as an American, as well as the
seductive dance hall girl, Mamie
(Dorrie Kavanaugh), that he can
no longer tolerate his wife with her
Old World ways. The film then
deals with Gitl's effort to resolve
her dilemma.
Hester Street is not about the
"American dream'' or about wo
man's role in American life or even
about the Jewish-American wo
man's role, as the film's promo
tional trappings might indicate.
Rather, Silver's work represents
an unassuming and humorous
depiction of several unextraordi
nary, though endearing charac
ters, in their struggle to adjust in a
new environment.
Some of the scenes are finely
conceived and sensitively

enacted, particularly those bet
ween Gitl and the family's boar
der, Bernstein, played with subtle
skill by Mel Howard.
Silver unfortunately seems a bit
hesitant about getting too dose to
her characters. For instance, the
film gives some indication that
Jake is not entirely villainous, but
this is never explored, and con
sequently the characters are
stratified along a line demarking
good and bad.

Though confined by Silvers'
unwillingness to probe too deeply.
Kane (the sad-eyed teller in
Dog Day Afternoon) is perfectly
cast here as Gitl in her first leading
role and gives an admirable per
formance.
Whether she is suffering silently
while her husband abuses her, or
attempting to cook dinner while
balancing a ridiculous feathered
hat on her head, Kane emanates a
delicately combined sense of
fragility and determination.
Gitl and Berstein as the pro
toganists rarely speak but man
age to communicate more feeling
than any of the more vocal charac
ters. And Bernstein (who is not an
actor but the director of graduate
film studies at New York Univer
sity) creates with one gesture the
film's most powerful moment.
And like all of Silver's actors,
Kane and Howard look remarka
bly right for their parts
Though self-sustaining, the plot
is often sluggish and without
focus. Silver's strength as a direc
tor, however, lies in her ability to
document and to create a "mood."
Silver's use of sepia-toned
black and white is technically skil
led but somewhat ambiguous in
purpose.
Adapted from the novella, Yekl.
written by Abraham Cahan who
lived on the all-Jewish Hester
Street in the 1890s, the film is
Silver's first full-length feature
Though hardly a milestone
among first films by independent
directors, Silver's creation is far
superior to most films currently
turned out by Hollywood.
Moreover, the film shows mo
ments of promise for Silver whose
instinct for mood and subtle
characterization reveals a poten
tially penetrating vision.

fondly made "period" piece.
Like an old, faded photograph,
Hester Street is somewhat limited
in the scope and depth of its vis
ion, yet it derives most of its ap
peal from an ability to explore the
historical past through an im
aginative photographic memory.
Written and directed by inde
pendent filmmaker Joan Silver,
Hester Street deals with the de
velopment of a young Jewish im
migrant, Gitl (played by Carol
Kane), who comes to New York to
join her already fully
Americanized husband, Jake
(played by Steven Keats).
Old world ways
Jake, however, has so
thoroughly embraced his new role
as an American, as well as the
seductive dance hall girl, Mamie
(Dorrie Kavanaugh), that he can
no longer tolerate his wife with her
Old World ways. The film then
deals with Gitl's effort to resolve
her dilemma.
Hester Street is not about the
"American dream'' or about wo
man's role in American life or even
about the Jewish-American wo
man's role, as the film's promo
tional trappings might indicate.
Rather, Silver's work represents
an unassuming and humorous
depiction of several unextraordi
nary, though endearing charac
ters, in their struggle to adjust in a
new environment.
Some of the scenes are finely
conceived and sensitively

enacted, particularly those bet
ween Gitl and the family's boar
der, Bernstein, played with subtle
skill by Mel Howard.
Silver unfortunately seems a bit
hesitant about getting too dose to
her characters. For instance, the
film gives some indication that
Jake is not entirely villainous, but
this is never explored, and con
sequently the characters are
stratified along a line demarking
good and bad.

Though confined by Silvers'
unwillingness to probe too deeply.
Kane (the sad-eyed teller in
Dog Day Afternoon) is perfectly
cast here as Gitl in her first leading
role and gives an admirable per
formance.
Whether she is suffering silently
while her husband abuses her, or
attempting to cook dinner while
balancing a ridiculous feathered
hat on her head, Kane emanates a
delicately combined sense of
fragility and determination.
Gitl and Berstein as the pro
toganists rarely speak but man
age to communicate more feeling
than any of the more vocal charac
ters. And Bernstein (who is not an
actor but the director of graduate
film studies at New York Univer
sity) creates with one gesture the
film's most powerful moment.
And like all of Silver's actors,
Kane and Howard look remarka
bly right for their parts
Though self-sustaining, the plot
is often sluggish and without
focus. Silver's strength as a direc
tor, however, lies in her ability to
document and to create a "mood."
Silver's use of sepia-toned
black and white is technically skil
led but somewhat ambiguous in
purpose.
Adapted from the novella, Yekl.
written by Abraham Cahan who
lived on the all-Jewish Hester
Street in the 1890s, the film is
Silver's first full-length feature
Though hardly a milestone
among first films by independent
directors, Silver's creation is far
superior to most films currently
turned out by Hollywood.
Moreover, the film shows mo
ments of promise for Silver whose
instinct for mood and subtle
characterization reveals a poten
tially penetrating vision.
