# Hester Street's Joan Silver
## Portrait of a director 
### Howard Baldwin 
Quick, how many female film directors are there?
You can count them on one hand. Elaine May (The
Heartbreak Kid, A New Leaf) and Ida Lupino (mostly in
television) are the only two that any die-hard film stu
dent can dredge up.
Add one more name. Joan Micklin Silver. She has
succeeded in doing what thousands of film students
would sell their last piece of celluloid for — written and
directed her own film, Hester Street. From a novella
about Jewish immigrants to New York, it is as meticul
ous in its recreation of an era as part two of The
Godfather (see review this page).
Prior to Hester Street, Silver had directed some
short films and written a movie called Limbo, about
wives of Vietnam's prisoners of war. It was butchered,
she said, by the director and the studio, until she didn't
even consider it hers.
Silver was in San Francisco recently with her hus
band, Ray, who produced her film. She reflected on
what for her is a fantasy come true.
"It was a big thrill for me to make it. And now to
discover that people want to pay to see it!" The odds
on her success were not encouraging, but the Silvers'
perseverance paid off — Hester Street is a complete
success in all the cities in which it has opened.
Ray Silver's connections as a real estate developer
enabled them to raise $370,000. To give you an idea of

how far that goes in a typical Hollywood production,
their entire budget alone is only one-tenth of Steve
McQueen's salary.
Their tiny budget constantly dictated the time they
could spend on the production, though the shoddiness
that usually accompanies low-budget films is com
pletely non-existent in Hester Street.
Parts of the film were filmed on location in New York
City. The real Hester Street now contains too many
representatives of the 1970s to have been convinc
ingly altered, so the Silvers filmed on Morton Street, as
well as on various sets.
Mrs. Silver said that New York City has a special
department devoted to accommodating filmmakers.
She complimented their helpfulness in converting
block-long Morton Street to the atmosphere of the
1890s.
Finding a distributor was a major headache, the
Silvers said, because Hester Street was pegged as an
"ethnic" film. They never succeed, the Silvers were
told as justification.
Eventually the Silvers set up their own distribution
firm in New York.
At present, Mrs. Silver is working on a script about
seven people working for an "alternative newspaper
in Boston. She has recently completed a dramatization
for public television of an F. Scott Fitzgerald story, due
to be televised in 1977.
