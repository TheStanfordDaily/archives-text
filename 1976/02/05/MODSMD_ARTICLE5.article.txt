# Gays gaining power
## 
### 
D.K. Hughes - OJdenburg

In the past seven years we gay
people have been fighting for our
rights to sexual expression and
self-identity. However, only in the
last two or three years have we
begun to fight for our political,
economic and social rights.
We have always been fighting
for our civil rights, but we have
shifted our focus, and have further
diversified our modes of action. As
we see it, the gay activist move
ment is in a transitional phase
from primarily identity-oriented ac
tion to primarily civil-oriented and
community-oriented action.
Our presence as a cohesive so
cial entity and, more important, as
a social force to be reckoned with,
has been firmly established. We
have become strong in ourselves
and surer in our numbers.
Two things have played a large
part in this evolutionary process.
Feminist movement
First, lesbian feminists have
identified and continue to develop
the ideological ties that bind gay
liberation to the feminist move
ment — ties that have always
been there, but of which gay male
activists have tended to be obsti
nately ignorant.
Historically, the gay movement
has been dominated by men
struggling to obtain for them
selves the political and social
privileges of a male-supremacist
society.
However, the white, male
supremacist structure of Ameican
society lies behind oppression of
gays, a reality gay men have
begun to understand only within
the past few years. Never before
have gay men been so aware of
how feminist thought applies to
their relationships to straight soci
ety and of the necessity of incor
porating feminist thought into rela
tionships with their lesbian sisters.
In the past, gay political action
was debilitated by an early schism
along sexist lines: gay men oper
ated within traditional sexist
frameworks, lesbian femin-sts op
erated to destroy that very

framework. Through the struggle
by many male gay activists to at
tain feminist consciousness and
the willingness of some lesbian
feminists to help them in their
struggle, this schism is slowly be
ginning to close.
As a result, we believe its pos
sible to look to a future in which
lesbians and gay men increas
ingly combine their political ener
gies for the greater benefit of all
gay people.
Oppression of others
Secondly, for many of us —
white, middle class — recognizing
and dealing with our own sexual
oppression has forced us to a
clearer and more conscious rec
ognition of the oppression of
others: third world, working class
and children, both gay and
straight.
We have come to realize the
struggles of these people are our
struggles as well; that truly, "none
of us is free until all of us are free."
In addition, we have begun to
clean house within our own or-

ganizations, coming to terms with
our oppression of Latino, black
and other third world gays. It has
been and still is a painful struggle
to reeducate and mobilize ourse
lves to the needs and priorities of
our brothers and sisters whom are
also members of a racial minority,
but this struggle is going on.
Within the gay activist commun
ity there are people and groups of
many different political orienta
tions, all working for the same end
— an end to political oppression of
ail kinds, sexist, sexual or racial.
Increasingly, we are acquiring
power through traditional political
channels and using it successfully
while at the same time we work to
restructure those channels.
We are building community and
utilizing the processes and re
souces of the existing social es
tablishment to gain power, without
— we believe — being coopted by
that establishment.

lesbians and gay men increas

gay people.
Oppression of others
Secondly, for many of us —
white, middle class — recognizing
and dealing with our own sexual
oppression has forced us to a
clearer and more conscious rec
ognition of the oppression of
others: third world, working class
and children, both gay and
straight.
We have come to realize the
struggles of these people are our
struggles as well; that truly, "none
of us is free until all of us are free."
In addition, we have begun to
clean house within our own or-

ganizations, coming to terms with
our oppression of Latino, black
and other third world gays. It has
been and still is a painful struggle
to reeducate and mobilize ourse
lves to the needs and priorities of
our brothers and sisters whom are
also members of a racial minority,
but this struggle is going on.
Within the gay activist commun
ity there are people and groups of
many different political orienta
tions, all working for the same end
— an end to political oppression of
ail kinds, sexist, sexual or racial.
Increasingly, we are acquiring
power through traditional political
channels and using it successfully
while at the same time we work to
restructure those channels.
We are building community and
utilizing the processes and re
souces of the existing social es
tablishment to gain power, without
— we believe — being coopted by
that establishment.

In the past seven years we gay
people have been fighting for our
rights to sexual expression and
self-identity. However, only in the
last two or three years have we
begun to fight for our political,
economic and social rights.
We have always been fighting
for our civil rights, but we have
shifted our focus, and have further
diversified our modes of action. As
we see it, the gay activist move
ment is in a transitional phase
from primarily identity-oriented ac
tion to primarily civil-oriented and
community-oriented action.
Our presence as a cohesive so
cial entity and, more important, as
a social force to be reckoned with,
has been firmly established. We
have become strong in ourselves
and surer in our numbers.
Two things have played a large
part in this evolutionary process.
Feminist movement
First, lesbian feminists have
identified and continue to develop
the ideological ties that bind gay
liberation to the feminist move
ment — ties that have always
been there, but of which gay male
activists have tended to be obsti
nately ignorant.
Historically, the gay movement
has been dominated by men
struggling to obtain for them
selves the political and social
privileges of a male-supremacist
society.
However, the white, male
supremacist structure of Ameican
society lies behind oppression of
gays, a reality gay men have
begun to understand only within
the past few years. Never before
have gay men been so aware of
how feminist thought applies to
their relationships to straight soci
ety and of the necessity of incor
porating feminist thought into rela
tionships with their lesbian sisters.
In the past, gay political action
was debilitated by an early schism
along sexist lines: gay men oper
ated within traditional sexist
frameworks, lesbian femin-sts op
erated to destroy that very

framework. Through the struggle
by many male gay activists to at
tain feminist consciousness and
the willingness of some lesbian
feminists to help them in their
struggle, this schism is slowly be
ginning to close.
As a result, we believe its pos
sible to look to a future in which
lesbians and gay men increas
ingly combine their political ener
gies for the greater benefit of all
gay people.
