Josh's pilgrimage
Editor:
It seems the evangelist Josh is
coming to campus again, with fea
tured appearances at Memorial
Church and Kresge Auditorium. In
the past few weeks we've been
subjected to a saturation mes
sage blitz bordering on vandalism.
The most recent abomination in
this vein took the form cf notices
placed on all the tables in The
Transition, showing Josh standing
in the exhaust port of a gigantic jet
engine (perhaps a symbolic
technological asshole, with Josh
about to be defecated into our
midst).
One purpose of the University
should be to study the lunatic
fringe in order to gain an under
standing of the social illls that pro
duced it, and not to glorify the

fringe by offering a platform to one
of its major spokesmen.

Jon Reider's Feb. 3 Daily letter
about short people points out a
real and harmful form of discrimi
nation.
Although I am not short by our
standards, the problem of "tall
ism" seems evident to me. The
damage wrought by this needless
discrimination is serious and far
reaching, a point most tall people
don't recognize.
It is not funny.
