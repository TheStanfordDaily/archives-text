## NEWS Hospital reinstates suspended doctors 
### Jacob Young 
At least 37 community physicians, sus
pended from practicing at Stanford Hospital
last Oct. 1 because they refused to disclose
the amount of malpractice insurance they
carried, were reinstated Tuesday.
The hospital's insurance carrier had
notified it last fall that a 20 percent surcharge
totaling about $400,000 would be added to
the hospital's $2.4 million per year insurance
rate if physicians without adequate medical
insurance coverage practiced at the hospital.
Hospital Medical Director Dr. Robert Alway
said last night "the physicians were sus
pended because they refused to disclose the
amount of insurance they carried
... not because they carried no insurance."
However, the carrier told the hospital on
Jan. 22 that the surcharge had been with
drawn. The hospital's board of directors sus
pended the insurance requirement until
further notice and approved the reinstate
ment of the physicians at an emergency
Tuesday night meeting.
'Terrible bind'
Alway said the reason for the delay bet
ween the Jan. 22 notification and Tuesday's
reinstatement was "simply because the
whole bloody thing is a mess ... All the doc

tors are in a terrible bind as to what they'll do.
"We need time to back off and let the dust
settle, 'Alway said.
Alway said he believed suspended physi
cians would return to practicing at the hospi
tal.
"However, some are doctors who seldom if
ever had reasons to admit" patients, said
Alway.
Refused disclosure
Dr. William Utzinger carried malpractice
insurance but was suspended because he
refused to disclose whether he had insurance
coverage.
Utzinger, commenting on whether the
reinstatement would affect the suspended
physicians, said last night, "Absolutely. It
means that doctors can go back to practicing
where they can get patients."
Utzinger will return to practicing at the hos

pital. During his suspension he has had to
practice at a Menlo Park hospital.
Alway said he had not yet received any
reactions from the reinstated physicians be
cause the decision had just been announced.
'Barely finding out'
"The doctors are barely finding out. We
announced to the press only this afternoon."
said Alway.
Hospital bylaws stated that physicians
would have to carry minimum individual
coverage of $1 million per malpractice case,
and $1 million aggregate per year for all
cases, in order to comply with the insurance
carrier's requirements.
According to Utzinger, "after the surcharge
was lifted Stanford was the only hospital in
the state with these insurance requirements.
The suspended doctors had contacted the
California Medical Association (CMA), which
considered taking the case to court."
'Uncertain situation'
Alway believed the hospital suspended the
insurance requirement due to the "current

uncertain medical malpractice situation in
California."
However, Utzinger said the suspension
requirement was removed because "there
was probably a combination of facts, includ
ing the Los Angeles situation and the pres
sure from the CMA."
"There is only one reason for the suspen
sion of a physician's right to use a hospital,
and that is professional or ethical incompe
tence,"Utzinger said, and"I hate to see this
use of financial means to test us."
Commenting on California's proposed
malpractice bills, Alway said that "at the risk
of sounding horrible, I refer this to the raised
eyebrows department until more is known.
Utzinger said the hospitals' insurance
rates began to rise after several lawsuits in
which doctors were inadequately covered
and hospitals were held liable for the remain
der of the judgment.
The insurance companies then "leveled
the gun at the hospitals," according to Ut
zinger.
