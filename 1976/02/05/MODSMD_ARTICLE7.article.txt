## NEWS Hospital reinstates suspended doctors 
### Jacob Young 
At least 37 community physicians, sus
pended from practicing at Stanford Hospital
last Oct. 1 because they refused to disclose
the amount of malpractice insurance they
carried, were reinstated Tuesday.
The hospital's insurance carrier had
notified it last fall that a 20 percent surcharge
totaling about $400,000 would be added to
the hospital's $2.4 million per year insurance
rate if physicians without adequate medical
insurance coverage practiced at the hospital.
Hospital Medical Director Dr. Robert Alway
said last night "the physicians were sus
pended because they refused to disclose the
amount of insurance they carried
... not because they carried no insurance."
However, the carrier told the hospital on
Jan. 22 that the surcharge had been with

Tuesday night meeting.
'Terrible bind'
Alway said the reason for the delay bet

reinstatement was "simply because the
whole bloody thing is a mess ... All the doc

tors are in a terrible bind as to what they'll do.
"We need time to back off and let the dust
settle, 'Alway said.
Alway said he believed suspended physi
cians would return to practicing at the hospi
tal.
"However, some are doctors who seldom if
ever had reasons to admit" patients, said
Alway.
Refused disclosure
Dr. William Utzinger carried malpractice
insurance but was suspended because he
refused to disclose whether he had insurance
coverage.
Utzinger, commenting on whether the
reinstatement would affect the suspended
physicians, said last night, "Absolutely. It
means that doctors can go back to practicing
where they can get patients."
