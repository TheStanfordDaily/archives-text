SAN FRANCISCO â€” Opening statements
were read and jury selection completed yes
terday in the federal bank robbery trial of
Patricia Hearst.
Hearst listened as a prosecutor called her
a foul-mouthed bank robber, then gazed at
jurors as her attorney described her as a
victim of sexual and mental torture, "a pris
oner of war."
Chief defense attorney F. Lee Bailey, re
minding jurors that he spoke on the second
anniversary of Hearst's kidnaping, con
tended that her chief abductor used his
studies of mind control techniques to brain
wash the newspaper heiress.
Government prosecutor James Brown
ing's gave a detailed, unemotional opening
statement accounting the events taking
place during the April 15, 1974, Hibernia
bank robbery here.
Bailey said he agreed with 90 percent of
what Browning said.
Browning said one witness will testify that
Hearst pointed a sawed-off carbine at him
and said, "Keep still or I'll blow your m.f. head
off."
