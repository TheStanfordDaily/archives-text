SAN FRANCISCO — Opening statements
were read and jury selection completed yes
terday in the federal bank robbery trial of
Patricia Hearst.
Hearst listened as a prosecutor called her
a foul-mouthed bank robber, then gazed at
jurors as her attorney described her as a
victim of sexual and mental torture, "a pris
oner of war."
Chief defense attorney F. Lee Bailey, re
minding jurors that he spoke on the second
anniversary of Hearst's kidnaping, con
tended that her chief abductor used his
studies of mind control techniques to brain
wash the newspaper heiress.
Government prosecutor James Brown
ing's gave a detailed, unemotional opening
statement accounting the events taking
place during the April 15, 1974, Hibernia
bank robbery here.
Bailey said he agreed with 90 percent of
what Browning said.
Browning said one witness will testify that
Hearst pointed a sawed-off carbine at him
and said, "Keep still or I'll blow your m.f. head
off."
Browning said another witness, Thomas
Mathews, will testify that he was kidnaped by
Hearst and William Emily Harris in Los
Angeles.
Mathews, according to Browning, will re
veal in court that Hearst told him she was a
willing participant in the Hibernia bank rob
bery. After the jury had left the courtroom,
Bailey objected to this offering of evidence,
and filed a motion for a mistrial.
Bailey maintained in his motion that Brown
ing's Los Angeles-related evidence was
more irrelevant to the case than beneficial to
the prosecution and would irrevocably taint
the perceptions of the jury.
Bailey then presented a highly emotional
opening statement, portraying Hearst as a
helpless victim, fearful of both the Sym
bionese Liberation and the FBI.
Earlier, Bailey told the Daily that he ex
pected the trial to last less than three weeks.
He also noted that Hearst felt that the jury
selected was "pretty good."
The jury of seven women and five men was
seated early yesterday. Eleven jurors are
caucasian, the 12th is an Asian American,
and the average age of the jurors is 39.
Tomorrow's session will begin with the
government calling its first witness, the man
ager of the Hibernia bank.
