# MDs return after 35-day slowdown
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Protesting doctors
yesterday declared an end to their 35-day
malpractice insurance slowdown but warned
"next time everyone will go out" if something
is not done to ease the crisis.
The United Physicians of California, claim
ing 80 percent of the state's 41,000 licensed
physicians, said doctors would be back in
their offices today.
A spokesman for the organization which
led the protest slowdown said the return to
work was prompted by assu ranees from polit
ical leaders in Sacramento that a solution
could be reached to the insurance crisis that
has sent malpractice rates up more than 300
percent.
'Implied threat'
But the spokesman added. "If it looks like
nothing is happening, there is the implied
threat next time everyone will go out" and not
only the Southern California-area specialists
who were the majority of the latest stoppage.
Except for a two-day show of support, most
general care doctors did not take part in the
slowdown which the UPC said involved
about 23.000 doctors at its height. The UPC
is an umbrella organization with representa
tives of a number of other physician groups.
The end of the walkout came as 300
statewide representatives of the UPC met
here and voted unanimously approving a
statement that said, "Phase one, to bnng
about a resolution of the medical malpractice
insurance problem — the job action — has
come to a successful conclusion.
'Real crisis'
"It (the protest) has demonstrated to the
public that the malpractice problem is a real

crisis demanding solution."
Dr. Richard Corlir), speaking for the physi
cians' group, said the protest "has brought
the enormity of the problem to the attention of
the opinion makers of the state, including the
news media.
"Most important,'' he said, "it has captured
the attention of the state administration and
the legislature and forced them to address
the problem seriously so that there can be an
early resolution of this distressing problem."
The work halt ended most elective surgery
and saw surgeons and many specialists
stop seeing all but post-operative patients.
Pressure continues
Although that part is over for now, Carlin
said, "We will continue pressure in other
ways." He said the doctors will now work "to
broaden the support for reform."
Leon Hauck, spokesman for the Hospial
Council of Southern California, said 115 of
the council's 234 members were hit in some
way by the slowdown.
"We are delighted, of course," he said of
the doctors' announcement.
"We will certainly continue to work with
them (the doctors) in reaching a long-range
solution." he said.
Officials said throughout the slowdown
that all patients were able to obtain needed
medical care.
But the shifting of cases to county-run
facilities cost taxpayers an estimated $1 mill
ion.
Private hospitals, despite putting more
than 20,000 workers on shortened work
weeks and laying off many others, said they
probably lost $7 million during the five weeks.

the problem seriously so that there can be an
early resolution of this distressing problem."
The work halt ended most elective surgery
and saw surgeons and many specialists
stop seeing all but post-operative patients.
Pressure continues
Although that part is over for now, Carlin
said, "We will continue pressure in other
ways." He said the doctors will now work "to
broaden the support for reform."
Leon Hauck, spokesman for the Hospial
Council of Southern California, said 115 of
the council's 234 members were hit in some
way by the slowdown.
"We are delighted, of course," he said of
the doctors' announcement.
"We will certainly continue to work with
them (the doctors) in reaching a long-range
solution." he said.
Officials said throughout the slowdown
that all patients were able to obtain needed
medical care.
But the shifting of cases to county-run
facilities cost taxpayers an estimated $1 mill
ion.
Private hospitals, despite putting more
than 20,000 workers on shortened work
weeks and laying off many others, said they
probably lost $7 million during the five weeks.
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Protesting doctors
yesterday declared an end to their 35-day
malpractice insurance slowdown but warned
"next time everyone will go out" if something
is not done to ease the crisis.
The United Physicians of California, claim
ing 80 percent of the state's 41,000 licensed
physicians, said doctors would be back in
their offices today.
A spokesman for the organization which
led the protest slowdown said the return to
work was prompted by assu ranees from polit
ical leaders in Sacramento that a solution
could be reached to the insurance crisis that
has sent malpractice rates up more than 300
percent.
'Implied threat'
But the spokesman added. "If it looks like
nothing is happening, there is the implied
threat next time everyone will go out" and not
only the Southern California-area specialists
who were the majority of the latest stoppage.
Except for a two-day show of support, most
general care doctors did not take part in the
slowdown which the UPC said involved
about 23.000 doctors at its height. The UPC
is an umbrella organization with representa
tives of a number of other physician groups.
The end of the walkout came as 300
statewide representatives of the UPC met
here and voted unanimously approving a
statement that said, "Phase one, to bnng
about a resolution of the medical malpractice
insurance problem — the job action — has
come to a successful conclusion.
'Real crisis'
"It (the protest) has demonstrated to the
public that the malpractice problem is a real

crisis demanding solution."
Dr. Richard Corlir), speaking for the physi
cians' group, said the protest "has brought
the enormity of the problem to the attention of
the opinion makers of the state, including the
news media.
"Most important,'' he said, "it has captured
the attention of the state administration and
the legislature and forced them to address
the problem seriously so that there can be an
early resolution of this distressing problem."
The work halt ended most elective surgery
