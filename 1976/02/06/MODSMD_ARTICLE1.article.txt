-Murk Twain commenting on Stan
ford's weather

For the first time since Jan. 21. 1962
and only the second time since IHB7,
midpeninsula residents awoke this
morning to find a half inch ot snow
blanketing the ground yesterday.
Following on the heels of summer
type weather only two days ago, the
snow transformed sundecks here into
lookout points from which to view the
whitened campus.
By 12:30 p.m., almost all ofthe snow
that had fallen overnight had melted,
hut a two-hour mid-afternoon fall
briefly re-covered the area.
Typical of the reaction in student
residences was the early-morning
scene at Lambda Nu. What had looked
like a beach house replete with sun
bathers earlier this week, suddenly
seemed to become a ski-lodge, with
snow-revelers sledding down nearby
hills and unleashing snowballs at
passers-by.
Unusual occurrences
Other unusual occurrences yester
day included an all-out snowball war
at the Kappa Alpha fraternity, cross
country skiers schussing around the
! snow-filled Lagunita lake bed and a
number of snowmen built in such

strange environs as White Plaza and <
Ruble Field.
The Stanford baseball team was an |
accidental victim of the snowfall as
practice had to be called off despite the
season opener tomorrow. Coach Ray
Young explained the team's solution:
"I've ordered 28 pairs of snowshoes for
the team so we'll be able to play the
game."
Three times
Since the 1962 snowfall, there have
been three times when snow has come
to the foothills. In 1966 and 1972 cold
winter weather led to snow along
Skyline Boulevard.
A year ago. Skyline again received
snow as did Page Mill Road, but none
of it stuck to the ground.
Beforethe 1.5-inch snowfall in 1962,
snow had not stuck to the ground since
1887. The 1962 snowfall differed from
yesterday's, however, because none of
it fell during daytime hours.
Snowfall in the foothills was exten
sive, with over two inches reported.
Skylonda led the midpeninsula with
up to three inches, while schools in
nearby Portola Valley were closed due
to the weather.
According to the Associated Press
forecast, rain showers will replace
snowfall, at least through tomorrow.

nearby Portola Valley were closed due
to the weather.
According to the Associated Press
forecast, rain showers will replace
snowfall, at least through tomorrow.

For the first time since Jan. 21. 1962
and only the second time since IHB7,
midpeninsula residents awoke this
morning to find a half inch ot snow
blanketing the ground yesterday.
Following on the heels of summer
type weather only two days ago, the
snow transformed sundecks here into
lookout points from which to view the
whitened campus.
By 12:30 p.m., almost all ofthe snow
that had fallen overnight had melted,
hut a two-hour mid-afternoon fall
briefly re-covered the area.
Typical of the reaction in student
residences was the early-morning
scene at Lambda Nu. What had looked
like a beach house replete with sun
bathers earlier this week, suddenly
seemed to become a ski-lodge, with
snow-revelers sledding down nearby
hills and unleashing snowballs at
passers-by.
Unusual occurrences
Other unusual occurrences yester
day included an all-out snowball war
at the Kappa Alpha fraternity, cross
country skiers schussing around the
! snow-filled Lagunita lake bed and a
number of snowmen built in such

strange environs as White Plaza and <
Ruble Field.
The Stanford baseball team was an |
accidental victim of the snowfall as
practice had to be called off despite the
season opener tomorrow. Coach Ray
Young explained the team's solution:
"I've ordered 28 pairs of snowshoes for
the team so we'll be able to play the
game."
Three times
Since the 1962 snowfall, there have
been three times when snow has come
to the foothills. In 1966 and 1972 cold
winter weather led to snow along
Skyline Boulevard.
A year ago. Skyline again received
snow as did Page Mill Road, but none
of it stuck to the ground.
Beforethe 1.5-inch snowfall in 1962,
snow had not stuck to the ground since
1887. The 1962 snowfall differed from
yesterday's, however, because none of
it fell during daytime hours.
Snowfall in the foothills was exten
sive, with over two inches reported.
Skylonda led the midpeninsula with
up to three inches, while schools in
nearby Portola Valley were closed due
to the weather.
According to the Associated Press
forecast, rain showers will replace
snowfall, at least through tomorrow.
