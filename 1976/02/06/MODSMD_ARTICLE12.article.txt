# U.S. press defames Chile's left

### 
Are the American media unwittingly abet
ting an international asassination program
of the Chilean junta?
That question was raised by last De
cember's publication, in newspapers
around the country, of an Associated Press
(AP) dispatch declaring Chile's under
ground Revolutionary Left Movement
(MIR) had passed death sentences on its two
top leaders, who had sought refuge in
foreign embassies from the military junta.
According to AP, MIR ordered "its milit
ants and . . . revolutionaries of the entire
world to execute the sentences however,
whenever and where they can."
Clearly, since AP never issued a retrac
tion, the world will blame MIR if those lead
ers are assassinated.
Justify murder
Yet the public "declaration" cited by AP
is nothing more than a fabrication of the
Chilean secret police, DINA, to justify its
murder of the leftist militants. The story
first originated in the right-wing Chilean
daily El Mercurio (which received $1.6
million from the CIA during the Allende
years), and was only picked up by AP the
next day.
The official MIR Exterior Committee de
nounced the story as "a new escalation in
the junta's attempt to eliminate these two
revolutionaries." This denial can be be
lieved because the original communique
was supposed to have been public, though
the AP never bothered to verify its source.
The MIR Exterior Committee went on to
warn that "DINA, the Chilean Gestapo, in
tends to proceed ... by assassinating them
(the two MIR leaders) before they leave
Chile, instead of operating abroad as it
(DINA) did in the assassination of General
Prats and his wife in Buenos Aires last year,

and in the attempted assassination of Chris
tian Democratic leader Bernardo Leighton
and his wife in Rome this past October."
Both oftheseactsby DINA. when exposed
in the press, caused an international uproar.
Mass execution
But they are minor compared to the mass
execution by DINA of 119 Chilean leftists,
which DINA proceeded to blame on MIR.
Lists of the dead Chileans, claimed to have
been killed by the MIR cadre after a power

struggle, appeared in two Argentinian and
Brazilian publications described by Time
magazine as "obscure" because they pub
lished only on this one occasion.
Yet El Mercurio predictably gave the
story a big play, saying, "Despite all law,
they (the terrorists) have ended up killing
each other and putting into practice the
most brutal of all laws, that of vengeance."
Yet DINA's responsibility for the murders
became so apparent that even within Chile,
the Catholic Church and moderate groups
publicly called for an investigation.
According to Time, DINA has now allied
itself with the Argentine Anti-Communist
Alliance (AAA), a government-tolerated
terrorist group which has assassinated
hundreds of left-wing politicians, jour
nalists and students in Argentina. The AAA

now handles many of the executions or
dered by DIN A of Chilean refugees in
Argentina.
Where does the United States stand re
garding these violations of international
law and morality? Last fiscal year, the Ford
administration exploited loopholes to cir
cumvent a congressional ceiling on aid to
Chile and supplied more than $250 million
to the military dictatorship.
Far cry
That is a far cry from 1970, when the
American ambassador could write, "Not a
nut or a bolt will be allowed to reach Chile
under Allende. . . We shall doall within our
power to condemn Chile and the Chileans to
utmost deprivation and poverty."
Jack Anderson reported last October the
Ford Administration gave the "red carpet"
treatment to Col. Manuel Contreras. head of
the Chilean secret police, during his secret
visit to Washington last year. Among the
officials on hand to welcome Conteras was
CIA Deputy Director Vernon Walters.
Finally, despite the arrest, torture and
murder of tens of thousands of Chileans by
the junta (attested to by numerous interna
tional organizations), the United States has
seen fit to admit less than a dozen Chilean
political refugees to this country. More
civilized countries have accepted over
13,000.
The U.S. government, through its efforts
to destroy the Allende regime and support
the present Chilean dictatorship, is com
plicit in the junta's crimes. It is tragic the
Associated Press is now also playing the
junta's game by promoting DINA's false and
defamatory references to the MIR.
