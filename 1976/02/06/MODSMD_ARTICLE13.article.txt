# Facts and the news
## 
### 
Gary Hamblet

I realize we live in a country
dominated, in the intellectual
community at least, by persons
of the liberal persuasion, and 1
too have "oriented" approp
riately.
But the myths can only be
taken so seriously before they
become abhorrent to all sense of
practical value. One need not be#
a staunch idealist, conservative
or leftist to be repelled by the
recent editorial by Viae Kershner
on "Objectivity."
One need only recognize the
inherent interrelationship (in
the practical sense, at the very,,
least) between fact and value,
data and context, "is" and
"ought.""
These were Kershner's claims:
—The Daily is "approaching
that goal" of providing "accu
rate summaries of all sides of key
questions."
—"printing all the news, ex
cept that of a purely personal na
ture, is essential to the well
being of the community regard
less of the consequences" (italics
in both quotations are mine).
<
The most obvious questions
are these. First, how many sides
is all sides and which questions
are key questions?
Second, can Kershner not im
agine any circumstances in
which news, even objectively
reported news (if we accept the
possibility for a moment) would
be antithetical to the essential
well-being of the community?
Had Kershner approached the
philosophical questions which
his claims obviously beg, I might
have been convinced an argu
ment was being made rather
than rhetoric tossed in my lap.
Had Kershner qualified his
claims and set limits to the ex
tension of his logic. I might have
been convinced my time spent
reading his editorial had not
been wasted.
I was once given an exam
question by Political Science
Prof. Charles Drekmeier which
would be an excellent one for
Kershner and indeed for every
liberal to address: Whut is a fact?
I reject Kershner's presupposi
tion that the answer to this ques
tion is an obvious one which he
need not even address in an arti
cle on objectivity, presented to a
diverse and intelligent Stanford
community. He dismisses his
critics with a Comtian wave of
the hand: "just the facts,
Ma'am."

ment was being made rather
than rhetoric tossed in my lap.
Had Kershner qualified his
claims and set limits to the ex
tension of his logic. I might have
been convinced my time spent
reading his editorial had not
been wasted.
I was once given an exam
question by Political Science
Prof. Charles Drekmeier which
would be an excellent one for
Kershner and indeed for every
liberal to address: Whut is a fact?
I reject Kershner's presupposi
tion that the answer to this ques
tion is an obvious one which he
need not even address in an arti
cle on objectivity, presented to a
diverse and intelligent Stanford
community. He dismisses his
critics with a Comtian wave of
the hand: "just the facts,
Ma'am."
