# Publishing record overvalued in tenure rulings
## 
### 
Glenn, Herman

Twice in the past year, the de
nial of tenure to a junior faculty
member has caused a stir in the
University community. Both
Asst. Sociology Prof. Anne
McMahon and Asst. Religious
Studies Prof. Jerry Irish were re
cipients of the Gores Award for
Excellence in Teaching; both
were denied tenure after it was
concluded their publication re
cords were inadequate.
It has been said, quite cor
rectly, that each individual te
nure case is unique — that the
particular criteria in each deci
sion are not entirely suscepti
ble to general and public
analysis. These two cases are dif
ferent, and particular issues are
raised in each.
The denial of tenure to McMa
hon follows the denial of tenure
two years ago to Asst. Sociology
Prof. Prancesca Cancian, who
had authored a number of well
received publications and had
been invited to apply for tenure
consideration a year in advance
of the usual date — normally an
indication of departmental
favor.
There are no full-time tenured
women faculty members in the
Sociology Department. Asst.
Sociology Prof. Barbara
Kosenblum, the only other full
time woman faculty member in
department, has been given a
two-year appointment rather
than the customary three-year
contract.
Pattern suggests
The pattern this suggests,
though by no means necessarily
conspiratorial, is distressing in
its affirmative action implica
tions and consequences.
Religious Studies Prof. Robert
McAfee Brown resigned this
year subsequent to denial of te
nure to Irish. Brown's teaching

and writing, li ke that of Irish, has
been notably concerned with
Christian ethics; his statement
that he feels Stanford is no
longer the appropriate place for
him to work is distressing also.
The loss of these two faculty
members implies a diminished
emphasis on an area important
to religious studies and, we
would think, to the University as
an educational whole.
But there is a general and pub
licly identifiable issue raised in
common by both these cases,
with serious implication for the
future of Stanford. The public
statements made in both these
cases, as well as statements
made by those responsible for
tenure and promotion decisions,
suggest an emphasis on quan
titative criteria in such decisions
that endangers the very idea of
the university itself.
Budgetary crisis
In a time of budgetary crisis,
when increasingly severe and
difficult decisions must be made
about granting tenure and
promotion to junior faculty here
—decisions which are the more
agonizing because they affect
the personal and professional fu
tures of some of the best and
brightest young people in the
country — it is tempting to look
for ways to make such decisions
more scientific and based on ob
jective and unexceptional
criteria.
An emphasis on quantitative
criteria is an inevitably attractive
response to the pressures of the
situation. The number of publi
cations is easily measurable; the
results of some scholarly en
deavors are more susceptible to
quantitative and comparative
evaluation than others.
But should McMahon's work
(for which she received an ex

tremely large grant from the Na
tional Science Foundation) be
declared unsatisfactory because
it does not yield a large and im
mediate flow of publications?
Should ethics — that most qual
itative of the ancients' studies —
now be expelled from the Uni
versity because it does not yield
publications easily measured by
quantitative criteria?
A great university must con
serve and transmit the qualita
tive as well as the quantitative
heritage of human experience.

Quantitative evaluation is im
portant, but it should be a part,
not the whole — there must be
room for qualitative criteria as
well in the tenure and promotion
process.
Technical institute
Unless this is true, Stanford is
in danger of becoming in sub
stance and reputation little more
than the technical institute its
detractors claim it to be.
We intend to bring this con
cern to the Committee on
Academic Affairs of the Board of

Trustees this weekend when the
board meets in Los Angeles.
The trustees are explicitly the
guardians and conservators of
Stanford as a great university,
but the enduring value of a Stan
ford education ought to be the
concern of all of us. Hence, we
urge everyone to express his
concern to his department and to
the University administration.

women faculty members in the
Sociology Department. Asst.
Sociology Prof. Barbara
Kosenblum, the only other full
time woman faculty member in
department, has been given a
two-year appointment rather
than the customary three-year
contract.
Pattern suggests
The pattern this suggests,
though by no means necessarily
conspiratorial, is distressing in
its affirmative action implica
tions and consequences.
Religious Studies Prof. Robert
McAfee Brown resigned this
year subsequent to denial of te
nure to Irish. Brown's teaching

and writing, li ke that of Irish, has
been notably concerned with
Christian ethics; his statement
that he feels Stanford is no
longer the appropriate place for
him to work is distressing also.
The loss of these two faculty
members implies a diminished
emphasis on an area important
to religious studies and, we
would think, to the University as
an educational whole.
But there is a general and pub
licly identifiable issue raised in
common by both these cases,
with serious implication for the
future of Stanford. The public
statements made in both these
cases, as well as statements
made by those responsible for
tenure and promotion decisions,
suggest an emphasis on quan
titative criteria in such decisions
that endangers the very idea of
the university itself.
Budgetary crisis
In a time of budgetary crisis,
when increasingly severe and
difficult decisions must be made
about granting tenure and
promotion to junior faculty here
—decisions which are the more
agonizing because they affect
the personal and professional fu
tures of some of the best and
brightest young people in the
country — it is tempting to look
for ways to make such decisions
more scientific and based on ob
jective and unexceptional
criteria.
An emphasis on quantitative
criteria is an inevitably attractive
response to the pressures of the
situation. The number of publi
cations is easily measurable; the
results of some scholarly en
deavors are more susceptible to
quantitative and comparative
evaluation than others.
But should McMahon's work
(for which she received an ex

tremely large grant from the Na
tional Science Foundation) be
declared unsatisfactory because
it does not yield a large and im
mediate flow of publications?
Should ethics — that most qual
itative of the ancients' studies —
now be expelled from the Uni
versity because it does not yield
publications easily measured by
quantitative criteria?
A great university must con
serve and transmit the qualita
tive as well as the quantitative
heritage of human experience.

Quantitative evaluation is im
portant, but it should be a part,
not the whole — there must be
room for qualitative criteria as
well in the tenure and promotion
process.
Technical institute
Unless this is true, Stanford is
in danger of becoming in sub
stance and reputation little more
than the technical institute its
detractors claim it to be.
We intend to bring this con
cern to the Committee on
Academic Affairs of the Board of

Trustees this weekend when the
board meets in Los Angeles.
The trustees are explicitly the
guardians and conservators of
Stanford as a great university,
but the enduring value of a Stan
ford education ought to be the
concern of all of us. Hence, we
urge everyone to express his
concern to his department and to
the University administration.

Twice in the past year, the de
nial of tenure to a junior faculty
member has caused a stir in the
University community. Both
Asst. Sociology Prof. Anne
McMahon and Asst. Religious
Studies Prof. Jerry Irish were re
cipients of the Gores Award for
Excellence in Teaching; both
were denied tenure after it was
concluded their publication re
cords were inadequate.
It has been said, quite cor
rectly, that each individual te
nure case is unique — that the
particular criteria in each deci
sion are not entirely suscepti
ble to general and public
analysis. These two cases are dif
ferent, and particular issues are
raised in each.
The denial of tenure to McMa
hon follows the denial of tenure
two years ago to Asst. Sociology
Prof. Prancesca Cancian, who
had authored a number of well
received publications and had
been invited to apply for tenure
consideration a year in advance
of the usual date — normally an
indication of departmental
favor.
There are no full-time tenured
women faculty members in the
Sociology Department. Asst.
Sociology Prof. Barbara
Kosenblum, the only other full
time woman faculty member in
department, has been given a
two-year appointment rather
