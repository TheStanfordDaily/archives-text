Carpools' status
Editor:
Despite the implications of the
Feb. 4 Daily article, "Carpool
system flounders," we at the
Off-Campus Student Center are
not at all ready to abandon the
project. The article's comments
on the problems of the system
are correct: however, it overem
phasized those problems.
At this point, the carpool sys
tem is still very much in its in
troductory stages, and we are
still encouraged that students
will respond and gain value
from shared-ride arrangements.

Film series
Editor:
The SWOPSI-SCIRE film
i series on Repression, Resistance
i and Rebellion was to have pre
sented The Conformist Jan. 2.
I Perhaps the movie finally was
â€¢ shown, though someone, a

"speaker" engaged by
SWOPSI-SCIRE, seemed deter
mined to prevent the screening.
This "speaker," who claimed
to have seen the film in 1970,
described to us with the aid of
note-cards the movie's possible
historical basis and then related
the plot in detail and at length,
adding a few comments on the
"meaning" of certain scenes.
When he began to talk about the
conclusion, saying how he
thought it ruined the film's im
pact. 1 left the auditorium in dis
gust.
Pehaps the organizers of the
series can in future either elimi
nate "speakers" altogether or
else choose people who will re
spect the films and the audience
enough to keep quiet until after
the screening, when sensible
people can leave and reflect for
themselves.

Stanford's priorities
I am appalled at the priorities
demonstrated in Stanford's de

cision to deny tenure to Asst.
Sociology Prof. Ann McMahon.
When I transferred here I was
disappointed to discover I
would not be able to enjoy the
intellectual and social closeness
with professors which had
seemed so appropriate and
natural at the two "lesser" uni
versities I previously attended.
I had just about given up hope
when I met McMahon and found
her to be not only another very
sharp Stanford faculty member
but also a really talented and de
dicated teacher.
I can't tell you how much she
raised my opinion of Stanford.
Apparently, however, Stan
ford is not going to allow such
attention. I can't imagine how
Stanford could more effectively
discourage this kind of faculty
dedication to students than by
denying tenure to faculty mem
bers who best exemplify the os
tensible superiority of Stanford
as a learning as well as a research
institution.
