# Does candor still elude selection process?
## Graduation speaker snags persist The 						Stanford Daily This Week

As spring approaches, so does commence
ment.
Last year, Stanford was able to combat the
usual boredom of commencement by provid
ing Daniel Moynihan, a speaker whose con
troversiality was not surpassed until after
commencement,when hefulfilied another invi
tation and became U.S. ambassador to the Un
ited Nations.
This June's commencement will feature
Carla Hills, Stanford alumna and secretary of
housing and urban development.asspeaker.
Though Hills herself has not yet created a
furor, and her address will probably not be
greeted with a student walkout as Moynihan's
was, the process by which Hills was selected
might cause some protest.
Besides the demands for withdrawing
Moynihan's invitation last spring, many also
called for changing the selection process.
Last year's selection committee was com
posed of that year's senior class officers, Vice
President for Public Affairs Robert
Rosenzweig, Asst. to the President William
Stone, and was assisted by two University staff
members.
This year's Commencement Speaker Selec
tion Committee consisted of this year's senior
class officers, Rosenzweig, Stone and Law
Prof. Kenneth Scott.
Voting was too costly
Last year, the senior class officers conducted
informal polls of seniors for speaker candi
dates at senior class events. A referendum at
which seniors could give their preferences for
a speaker was not held,because two years ago
such an election cost about $250 and very few
seniors voted.
The selection committee met a few times and
finally announced Moynihan's acceptance.
Three other people had previously declined
the committee's invitations.
Last September, seniors were asked to
suggest names for commencement speaker at
registration. Each department had one
grad student survey other graduate students
for suggestions. The senior class officers con
ducted a telephone poll of about 120 seniors to
sound them out on the suggested choices.
Last quarter three lists of 16, nine and nine
names were released. The lists represented
those suggestions under consideration by the
committee. Some names were the same on each
list, but other names were deleted and added to
each list. No election was held this year. Hills'
acceptance was announced early last month.
Moynihan was number four
Last year, it became known that Moynihan
was the committee's fourth choice after his ac
ceptance was announced. Even though the
second and third choices after Hills were just
announced. Senior Class President Walt
Spevak said last week Hills "may or may not

have been the first choice" of the selection
committee.
The publication of the names of candidates
being considered, the addition of one faculty
member to the committee and an attempt to get
some graduate input were seen as improve
ments over last year.
Few grads participated
However, Spevak has said the graduate stu
dents only suggested a few names which had
already been recommended. Last year, stu

dents and faculty proposed the addition of a
few faculty members — from different discip
lines — and graduate students to the commit
tee.
Some believed other seniors, besides the
class officers, should be placed on the commit
tee. Others advocated an election and a more
open selection process.
This year, an election was again decided
against, but the senior class officers contended
that this year's process was the best possible
method. Spevakand other committee members
said they thought secrecy was important be
cause a person might not wish to speak if he or
she were not the first choice. Spevak said sec
recy was also necessary because of "respect to
Carla . . . and respect for the feelings of the
person or persons who may have been in
vited."
Some persons last year pointed out, how
ever, that Moynihan's knowledge of his fourth
place on the invitation list did not seem to
bother him.
Candor still absent
Though this year's process manifested a few
improvements, the candor of committee
members which followed last year's speaker
announcement has not occurred.
Although Hills will probably not face the
protest which Moynihan did — and com
mencement speaker issue does seem to have
disappeared amid the Big Game Bonfire and
mascot controversies — repetition of this
year's selection process could possibly pro
duce another Moynihan one day.

CONTROVERSIAL CHARACTER—The United Nations is not the only place where Daniel
Patrick Moynihan has stirred controversy during the past year. When Moynihan spoke at
Stanford's commencement last year, 100 students walked away to protest his opinions on

CONTROVERSIAL CHARACTER—The United Nations is not the only place where Daniel
Patrick Moynihan has stirred controversy during the past year. When Moynihan spoke at
Stanford's commencement last year, 100 students walked away to protest his opinions on
race. This year's speaker, Carla Hills, will probably not create any similar controversy, but
some students feel that her selection reflected student wishes no more than the choice of
Moynihan.
As spring approaches, so does commence
ment.
Last year, Stanford was able to combat the
usual boredom of commencement by provid
ing Daniel Moynihan, a speaker whose con
troversiality was not surpassed until after
commencement,when hefulfilied another invi
tation and became U.S. ambassador to the Un
ited Nations.
This June's commencement will feature
Carla Hills, Stanford alumna and secretary of
housing and urban development.asspeaker.
Though Hills herself has not yet created a
furor, and her address will probably not be
greeted with a student walkout as Moynihan's
was, the process by which Hills was selected
might cause some protest.
Besides the demands for withdrawing
Moynihan's invitation last spring, many also
called for changing the selection process.
Last year's selection committee was com
posed of that year's senior class officers, Vice
President for Public Affairs Robert
Rosenzweig, Asst. to the President William
Stone, and was assisted by two University staff
members.
This year's Commencement Speaker Selec
tion Committee consisted of this year's senior
class officers, Rosenzweig, Stone and Law
Prof. Kenneth Scott.
Voting was too costly
Last year, the senior class officers conducted
informal polls of seniors for speaker candi
dates at senior class events. A referendum at
which seniors could give their preferences for
a speaker was not held,because two years ago
such an election cost about $250 and very few
seniors voted.
The selection committee met a few times and
finally announced Moynihan's acceptance.
Three other people had previously declined
the committee's invitations.
Last September, seniors were asked to
suggest names for commencement speaker at
registration. Each department had one
grad student survey other graduate students
for suggestions. The senior class officers con
ducted a telephone poll of about 120 seniors to
sound them out on the suggested choices.
Last quarter three lists of 16, nine and nine
names were released. The lists represented
those suggestions under consideration by the
committee. Some names were the same on each
list, but other names were deleted and added to
each list. No election was held this year. Hills'
acceptance was announced early last month.
Moynihan was number four
Last year, it became known that Moynihan
was the committee's fourth choice after his ac
ceptance was announced. Even though the
second and third choices after Hills were just
announced. Senior Class President Walt
Spevak said last week Hills "may or may not

have been the first choice" of the selection
committee.
The publication of the names of candidates
being considered, the addition of one faculty
member to the committee and an attempt to get
some graduate input were seen as improve
ments over last year.
Few grads participated
However, Spevak has said the graduate stu
dents only suggested a few names which had
already been recommended. Last year, stu

dents and faculty proposed the addition of a
few faculty members — from different discip
lines — and graduate students to the commit
tee.
Some believed other seniors, besides the
class officers, should be placed on the commit
tee. Others advocated an election and a more
open selection process.
This year, an election was again decided
against, but the senior class officers contended
that this year's process was the best possible
method. Spevakand other committee members
said they thought secrecy was important be
cause a person might not wish to speak if he or
she were not the first choice. Spevak said sec
recy was also necessary because of "respect to
Carla . . . and respect for the feelings of the
person or persons who may have been in
vited."
Some persons last year pointed out, how
ever, that Moynihan's knowledge of his fourth
place on the invitation list did not seem to
bother him.
Candor still absent
Though this year's process manifested a few
improvements, the candor of committee
members which followed last year's speaker
announcement has not occurred.
Although Hills will probably not face the
protest which Moynihan did — and com
mencement speaker issue does seem to have
disappeared amid the Big Game Bonfire and
mascot controversies — repetition of this

she were not the first choice. Spevak said sec
recy was also necessary because of "respect to
Carla . . . and respect for the feelings of the
person or persons who may have been in
vited."
Some persons last year pointed out, how
ever, that Moynihan's knowledge of his fourth
place on the invitation list did not seem to
bother him.
Candor still absent
Though this year's process manifested a few
improvements, the candor of committee
members which followed last year's speaker
announcement has not occurred.
Although Hills will probably not face the
protest which Moynihan did — and com
mencement speaker issue does seem to have
disappeared amid the Big Game Bonfire and
mascot controversies — repetition of this
year's selection process could possibly pro
duce another Moynihan one day.

CONTROVERSIAL CHARACTER—The United Nations is not the only place where Daniel
Patrick Moynihan has stirred controversy during the past year. When Moynihan spoke at
Stanford's commencement last year, 100 students walked away to protest his opinions on
race. This year's speaker, Carla Hills, will probably not create any similar controversy, but
some students feel that her selection reflected student wishes no more than the choice of
Moynihan.
