# Tenure denials: does teaching count?
## 
### Bruce Kadden 
For the second time in as many years, a win
ner of the Gores Award for Excellence in
Teaching has been denied tenure, putting
new life into the controversy about the em
phasis placed on research and publishing in
tenure decisions.
The Sociology Depatment denied Asst. Prof.
Anne McMahon tenure last month, an act
which McMahon herself admitted was jus
tified under the University's regulations.
Last year, Asst. Religious Studies Prof. Jerry
Irish was denied tenure by the Appointments
and Promotions Committee even though he
was unanimously recommended for tenure by
his department. A subsequent appeal to Pro
vost William Miller was also denied.
McMahon and Irish were not only acclaimed
as outstanding teachers, but were also known
as professors who devoted an inordinate
amount of time to the needs of undergraduate

students.
These decisions also appear to be a mandate
to untenured faculty members about where to
put their priorities if they expected to serve
here more than six years.
Job security was lacking
McMahon was satisfied, she said, to do her
research, publish two scholarly articles and
devote much of her time to students. "I consi
dered it a great six-year job, but I always knew
that job security was not one of the things that
came with it," she said.
She also said that she had never considered
readjusting her research schedule so that she
would be able to publish more articles in order
to meet University requirements.
These regulations state that a professor
should teach well and have done extremely
outstanding research as indicated by pub
lished material.
Balancing these guidelines such that one or

the other does not receive a disproportionate
weight is a difficult issue to resolve, President
Richard Lyman commented earlier this week.
Students have claimed that recent decisions
have clearly shown that teaching excellence
plays little part in such decisions. Even Lyman
admitted that he knew of professors who were
granted tenure because their research was out
standing even though their teaching was rated
"adequate or barely so."
The Irish case involved an accepted out
standing teaching record with a questionable
publishing effort.
Division of opinion
But those who supported his request that
Miller overturn the A & P committee's decision
were divided into two camps.
Some contended that while his publishing
didn't meet University standards, his teaching
superiority rrtade up for it.
Others contended that while the quantity of

his published materials was not as great as
many others who had received tenure, its qual
ity, as indicated by the recommendation of the
Religious Studies department, was such that it
met the publication guidelines.
Lyman stressed earlier this week that the
quality, rather than quantity of research was
most important to tenure decisions.
The best judge of such quality would seem to
be the faculty of the department to which the
person applying for tenure belongs, but be
cause most departments recommend most of
their assistant professors for tenure, this re
sponsibility has necessarily been passed along
to the A & P Committee.
Where it is difficult to verify the quality of
the published material of a candidate, quantity
seems to become an important factor.
Departmental initiative needed
If departments begin scrutinizing their can
didates more closely to determine if their qual
ifications meet University standards, it is
probable that the A & P Committee will be able
to trust department evaluations to a greater
extent than at present.
But students will still object to the regula
tions, or to their interpretation, because of the
apparent disregard for teaching excellence.
The University regards research and pub
lishing to be at least, if not more important than
teaching quality when evaluating professor's
accomplishments.
There is no way to completely resolve this
conflict, but students would undoubtably be
more satisfied if there were some visible evi
dence that teaching ability was considered an
important criterion in tenure decisions.

their assistant professors for tenure, this re
sponsibility has necessarily been passed along
to the A & P Committee.
Where it is difficult to verify the quality of
the published material of a candidate, quantity
seems to become an important factor.
Departmental initiative needed
If departments begin scrutinizing their can
didates more closely to determine if their qual
ifications meet University standards, it is
probable that the A & P Committee will be able
to trust department evaluations to a greater
extent than at present.
But students will still object to the regula
tions, or to their interpretation, because of the
apparent disregard for teaching excellence.
The University regards research and pub
lishing to be at least, if not more important than
teaching quality when evaluating professor's
accomplishments.
There is no way to completely resolve this
conflict, but students would undoubtably be
more satisfied if there were some visible evi
dence that teaching ability was considered an
important criterion in tenure decisions.


Anne McMahon
For the second time in as many years, a win
ner of the Gores Award for Excellence in
Teaching has been denied tenure, putting
new life into the controversy about the em
phasis placed on research and publishing in
tenure decisions.
The Sociology Depatment denied Asst. Prof.
Anne McMahon tenure last month, an act
which McMahon herself admitted was jus
tified under the University's regulations.
Last year, Asst. Religious Studies Prof. Jerry
Irish was denied tenure by the Appointments
and Promotions Committee even though he
was unanimously recommended for tenure by
his department. A subsequent appeal to Pro
vost William Miller was also denied.
McMahon and Irish were not only acclaimed
as outstanding teachers, but were also known
as professors who devoted an inordinate
amount of time to the needs of undergraduate

students.
These decisions also appear to be a mandate
to untenured faculty members about where to
put their priorities if they expected to serve
here more than six years.
Job security was lacking
McMahon was satisfied, she said, to do her
research, publish two scholarly articles and
devote much of her time to students. "I consi
dered it a great six-year job, but I always knew
that job security was not one of the things that
came with it," she said.
She also said that she had never considered
readjusting her research schedule so that she
would be able to publish more articles in order
to meet University requirements.
These regulations state that a professor
should teach well and have done extremely
outstanding research as indicated by pub
lished material.
Balancing these guidelines such that one or

the other does not receive a disproportionate
weight is a difficult issue to resolve, President
Richard Lyman commented earlier this week.
Students have claimed that recent decisions
have clearly shown that teaching excellence
plays little part in such decisions. Even Lyman
admitted that he knew of professors who were
granted tenure because their research was out
standing even though their teaching was rated
"adequate or barely so."
The Irish case involved an accepted out
standing teaching record with a questionable
publishing effort.
Division of opinion
But those who supported his request that
Miller overturn the A & P committee's decision
were divided into two camps.
Some contended that while his publishing
didn't meet University standards, his teaching
superiority rrtade up for it.
Others contended that while the quantity of

his published materials was not as great as
many others who had received tenure, its qual
ity, as indicated by the recommendation of the
Religious Studies department, was such that it
met the publication guidelines.
Lyman stressed earlier this week that the
quality, rather than quantity of research was
most important to tenure decisions.
The best judge of such quality would seem to
be the faculty of the department to which the
person applying for tenure belongs, but be
cause most departments recommend most of
their assistant professors for tenure, this re
sponsibility has necessarily been passed along
to the A & P Committee.
