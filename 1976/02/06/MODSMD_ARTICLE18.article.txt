# Investment firm might assist ASSU Senate
## 
### Lori Matsukawa 
A recent ASSU Fi nance Committee proposal
to hire a private firm to invest ASSU
funds instead of leaving investing respon
sibilities solely to the financial manager is re
miniscent of last year's dispute about whether
to hire a full-time manager.
Last year at this time, ASSU President Mike
Herman, Senators Tim Conway and Kevin
McDermott and former Financial Manager
Frank Olivieri strongly supported hiring a
tull-time financial manager rather than a part
time student manager to take over ASSU finan
cial responsibilities.
These responsibilities include overseeing
the various ASSU departments, including the
travel service, special events and lecture
notes and investing ASSU funds in profit
making bonds.
They argued that a full-time manager would
have the time and expertise to maximize ASSU
profits and would be better able to negotiate
funding with the University. Olivieri also
added that a full-time manager could offer
"sophisticated analyses" of financial situa
tions which an inexperienced student could
not.
This year, McDermott, Finance Committee
chairman, has brought an informal proposal to
the senate suggesting the hiring of a private
investing firm to buy bonds. This firm,
McDermott said, would be under the direction
of a stil 1-to-be-formed. senate Investment
Committee.
Initiative limited
This proposal, which is supported by cur
rent Financial Manager Chris Cline, limits, if

not eliminates, the investment initiative of the
financial manager.
"A financial manager never had to handle
the amount of money I had to this year," said
Cline, explaining that $250,000 all at once was
too much for one person to invest, particularly
if he were inexperienced.
Cline has $370,000 currently invested and
has so far realized a profit of "about $21,000."
This proposal aims to safeguard ASSU
funds from a future inexperienced manager.
McDermott and Cline have implied that the
advantages of hiring an investment firm would
include:
—having a knowledgeable investment firm
working full-time on investments;
—safeguarding against an inexperienced fi
nancial manager;
— being able to realize a greater profit.
Firm would be guided
Cline indicated that the senate Investments
Committee would set "parameters" to guide
the investment firm.
"The senate Investment Committee would
set up its own criteria as to how we will invest
the money," McDermott said at last week's se
nate meeting. "It is for what we want to ac
complish."
Arguments against such a proposal include
some of those used against last year's full-time
financial manager issue. They include:
—cost of hiring a firm;
—no privacy. The firm would be free to in
spect all ASSU financial records;
—despite the investment committee's
parameters and constitutional safeguards,
there is little way the students or the committee

can directly prevent misuse of funds by the
firm;
—loss of financial manager's independence.
Also, a firm would deprive a financial manager
of valuable investing experience and responsi
bility;
—sounds too professional.
One cannot de-emphasize the importance of
investment profits, however, or ignore
the fact that the Dean of Student Affairs Office
will be cutting the ASSU budget by $42,000
next year. Cline said this deficit must be made
up almost entirely by investment profits.
Attempts to reduce the $42,000 budget
would lead to only a minor change — Cline
projected a $4000 or $5000 reduction — after

which student services that are presently free
would have to start charging.
The question then is how to obtain the
$42,000 needed to cover next year's projected
deficit.
Would private firm help?
McDermott and Cline have suggested the
hiring of a private firm to maximize investment
profits.
Another alternative would be to depend on
the financial manager just as we do today.
The financial manager, who is selected each
February and assumes his duties in full during
June, is hired because he is qualified and
knowledgable of financial affairs and proce
dures.
He is carefully selected by a committee com
posed of the outgoing financial manager, the
incoming ASSU president and one graduate
and one undergraduate member of the senate.
Experts are called in
Each manager uses his judgment to make the
proper investments. Frank Olivieri realized an
interest profit of $22,890.50 as of last Jan. 1.
Cline, unlike Olivieri, has made it a habit to
consult business school professors with in
vestment experience as well as Rodney Adams,
University investments manager, before mak
ing his investments and has realized nearly the
same amount of profit.
Whatever the outcome of the current con
troversy, the implications of having a private
investing firm take charge of ASSU funds need
to be analyzed and debated to insure future
freedom for both the financial manager and
students.
