### Rick Christian 
Ranked first in academic quality in
recent national surveys, Stanford's
Business School is expecting a record
crop of applications again this year ac
cording to Richard Lazarus, admis
sions director at the Business School.
Approximately 3700 persons are
expected to apply for 310 openings —
a 10 percent increase over last year,
Lazarus said.
"This is the third year Stanford has
had a significant rise in Business
School applications," explains Cary
Williams, director of the Master of
Business Administration (MBA) prog
ram. There was a 25 percent jump in
the applicants during 1973-74, and
another 30 percent increase in 1974-
75. he noted.
Williams said he believes the
economy is at the root of many of the
decisions. "With the economy not
running along in the most effective
fashion, people are beginning to un
derstand that an MBA is a very
employable individual," he said.
"A lot of good quality people who
were looking toward Ph.Ds in law and
medicine now think an MBA is re
spectable. They're thinking about
career choices sooner, and reordering
priorities as they go through college,"
said David Evans, admissions director
at Dartmouth's business school.
Interest in business schools seems to
be increasing all over the country. Wil
liams added. Other major schools are
also receiving large numbers of appli
cations.
UCLA's business school is anticipat
ing a 20 percent increase in applicants
this year.
Applications at Dartmouth's busi
ness school are also running ahead of
previous vears.

The proportion of applicants com
ing from undergraduate backgrounds
in engineering has declined, accord
ing to UCLA's Broesamie. He added
there has been an increase in the
number of students with backgrounds
relating to medicine who are applying
to business schools.
"We're also finding quite a broaden
ing in the type of organizations seek
ing MBAs — hospitals, for example,
local governments, school systems,
and other non-traditional (areas are)
markets for us," he commented.
Evans gave a word of caution.
"All these trends tend to be trans
ient. Business schools are ill-advised
to think this swing will continue inde
finitely. The pendulum shifts back and
forth between business and law
school," he noted.
