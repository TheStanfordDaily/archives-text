# The

Any fool can see that bicycles
rule the campus. Go out to YVhite
Plaza about noon on any week
day. and you can witness that all
these fools are riding these very
bicycles. (Much to the dismay of
the motor vehicle community,
these bicycles also are allowed
on public roads.) Occasionally
these bicycles cease to operate,
and whether you experienced an
unexpected meeting with a fel
low cyclist or the sleek Peugot
just doesn't seem to stop as well
as it once did, there will bea time
when a little service is required
for your machine.
Michelin tubes, Michelin
tires, and the Wonder Light were
the only name brand items
specified. All other items — tube
repair kits, drive chain, lock and
cable sets — were what the store
carried in stock. Incidentally,
the lock and cable combination
was what each store recom

mended as the most popular and
practical for a 10-speed bicycle.
Cable housing is priced per foot.
A reflector kit is required on
all bicycles, and has been since
January 1, 1975. In addition, an
armband type of light will make
a student rider legal on campus
after dark. The arm band light
price includes a battery.
Also included in this week's
survey is labor prices to fix the
consequences of a common oc
currence on campus — the
front-end collision. All figures
for the first two items
("Straighten Fork," "True
Rim") are only approximate fi
gures, the actual price depend
ing on the damage done.
The following stores, all in
close proximity to Stanford
campus, were used in this com
parison:
Campus Bike Shop, be
hind Law School on cam
pus, 325-2945
Menlo Sport, 1137 El
Camino, MP, 323-4406
Palo Alto Bike Shop, 171
University, PA, 328-7411
Stanford Bike Co-op, 508
University, PA. 328-5390
Sugden & Lynch, 811
Santa Cruz, MP, 322-0373

He sure to call before going to
any of the places, as hours do
vary.
Each store varies greatly from
their competitors. Campus Bike
Shop has the advantage of loca
tion and promises one-day ser
vice. Menlo Sport has a low-key
atmosphere, helpful service
men. along with a variety of
other sporting goods. Palo Alto
Bike Shop specializes in touring
and racing equipment and has a
free catalog of such equipment.
Stanford Bike Co-op is perhaps
the largest used bike center in
California, with one-speeds
starting at $10.00. Sugden &
Lynch offer the experience of
over 14 years in the business for
the Lynch brothers.
All of the shops take used
bikes in trade for a new model,
and most offer used bike sales.
For the economy-minded, be
sure to check the local variety
discount stores, such as Payless,
Gemco (a membership store),
Co-op or Maximart. While they
do not offer the full services of a
bicycle shop, they do have some
parts and accessories at a less
expensive price.
