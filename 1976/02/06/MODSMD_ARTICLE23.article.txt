## Timothy Dekin: a mature poet

Reviewed by Dana Gioia
Occasional Uncles is a sequ
ence of 10 short poems written
by Timothy Dekin who teaches
creative writing here. The poems
are simple, brief and compel
ling, and the collection deserves
the attention of anyone in
terested in poetry. By itself this
modest sequence establishes
Dekin as a mature and conscien
tious poet of serious potential.
When the sequence opens, the
narrator and his wife are quietly
trying to repair an unhappy mar
riage. They have just moved into
a cabin in the country and the
attentive care they bestow on the
dirty cabin reflects their feelings
towards their own problematic
relationship:
We worked together, Face to
face, we washed
The cabin windows, rub
bing contrariwise.
Cutting through weather,
grease, we made almost
Invisible the glass between
our lives.

Dekin writes in what will
probably be called the
"Stanford style"

But the narrator knows that
the marriage is doomed to fai
lure. His obsessive self
consciousness brings him
deeper into himself and farther
from her. He is an emotional
hypochondriac and no love from
anyone will convince him he is
cured of his spiritual malaise.

Gradually the marriage de
teriorates and his wife begins her
own life with their son. Eventu
ally he visits them but feels like a
stranger in his own family. Sep
aration has only intensified his
sense of emotional isolation.
The book's ironic title
comes from the last poem in the
sequence. The narrator finally
gains permission to take his son
home with him for a visit. Their
boy is afraid in the unfamiliar
house and so he sleeps with his
father.
The poet doesn't sleep but
spends hours watching his
sleeping son. He realizes simul
taneously both how much he
loves his son and how incapable
he is of demonstrating it to the
boy in a natural way. His love
lacks the objectivity of a father
who lives everyday with his son:
When his tense fingers
tangle in my beard
To keep me where he's
dreaming. I annoy
His sleep with a kiss. I un
derstand
Those sad, occasional un
cles, how they spoil.
The Stanford style
Dekin writes in what one day
will probably be called the
"Stanford style." This approach
to poetry derives from the late
Ivor Winters, who taught at Stan
ford for over 30 years, and his
most gifted pupils, notably J.V.
Cunningham and Edgjr Bowers.
The "Stanford style" stresses
the rational content of verse.
Poetry must convey moral wis
dom, Winters taught, through
the disciplined and rational use
of language. In his own mature
poetry Winters also set the
example of using metrical forms
with strict regularity.

At its best this poetry can cap
ture the larger dimensions of a
particular situation in a convinc
ing and memorable way. Win
ters' approach regained some of
the ground poetry had lost in the
modern period. Once again
poets discoursed about impor
tant issues in comprehensible
ways shirking neither the intel

lectual nor moral respon
sibilities of their task.
At its worst such poetry be
came both stylistically and intel
lectually stilted. Winters' em
phasis on 17th century forms
and ideas often had a disastrous
effect on his less-gifted pupils.
Too often they distorted and re

duced their poems into grotes
que parodies of Ben Jonson or
Fulke Greville.
Purifying diction
Perhaps the greatest achieve
ment of modern American
poetry was its success in purify
ing its diction. Pound, Eliot, Ste
vens and especially Williams
managed to free American
poetry from the out-dated and
imprecise vocabulary it had un
critically borrowed from the Vic
torians. This renewal of lan
guage gave modern American
poetry much of its energy.
Even conservative poets like
Frost and MacLeish used a lan
guage consistently free of liter
ary cliches and anachronisms.
At its best their language was
clean, contemporary and
natural.
The strict metrical regularity
and the philosophical emphasis
of Winters' poetry had a bad ef
fect on some of his followers.
Anyone who has read through
collections by students of Win
ters will see how often they sac
rificed the quality of language in
their poems to fill in a meter pat
tern.
They often resorted to anac
hronisms, unnecessary adjec
tives, or stilted words to achieve
a superficial smoothness. They
were good craftsmen so their
poems were very rarely bad. Hut
language never came alive in
their poems and consequently
they produced almost no truly
impressive poems.
Form without formality
Dekin's poetry shows Winters'
influence at is best. His poems
make moral judgments without
moralizing. His poems show
form without being sepulch
rally formal. His poems may lack
a little of the necessary joy in

language for its own sake, but
this quality is less important in
narrative than in lyrical poems.
Dekin's poems manage to
create strong emotional re
sponses without being senti
mental. Although these poems
portray highly emotional situa
tions, their precise, objective
style keeps them on a factual
level which never declines into
vague emotionalism. Their sub
jectivity is conveyed in convinc
ing objective terms.
One of Dekin's strongest
points is his ability to create a
powerful emotional scene in a
few lines and describe it in a
striking simile. In one poem he
writes his wife:

One of Dekin's strongest
points is his ability to
create a powerful emo
tional scene in a few
lines. . .

This morning, with my cof
fee, with this page
On the bright kitchen tuhle,
with secrets near,
Retreat and loneliness I
love, I felt
Absence fall like a shadow
on the room -
Like one who drowsing in
the afternoon
Wakens to darkness, and
the sense of loss.
The sequence is consistently
impressive. Only one poem in
the entire sequence seems less
than excellent. The 10 poems
also combine into a convincing
and powerful sequence.
While they are individually
excellent, in the context of the

sequence they acquire addi
tional power. Dekin handles his
material admirably. Not one
poem is too long, and all of them
profit by being read in a specific
context.
A failure of language
The only weakness in this
sequence of poems is relatively
minor. Occasionally Dekin's ear
fails him and a line falls flat. For
example at one point he writes:
I suffer from my memory.
We never leurn. Expecting
to
We spoil what we do any
ways.
Forgiving ourselves as ive
have to.
We stay the same . . .
This passage begins admira
bly, but it falls flat in the middle.
"Anyways" is an unfortunate
word for both the; sound and the
sense. This one word mars an
otherwise perfect poem.
Dekin writes "confessional"
verse the way it should be writ
ten. He has a strong sense of ob
jectivity without losing his sym
pathy and understanding of the
personal emotions. He never
falls into self-pity. The three
characters of the sequence — the
mother, father and child —
emerge with a novelistic clarity.
Occasional Uncles also has
the considerable advantage of
brevity. Because Dekin has or
ganized anil condensed his
material so well a full story
emerges in only 10 short poems.
No good poet is ever afraid of
lucidity. It allows him to com
municate things as quickly and
effectively as possible.
Occasional Uncles has been
beautifully printed by the Knife
River Press. The hand-printing
on quality paper is much nicer
than most small press produc
tions. At the price of $1 it is cer
tainly well worth acquiring.

Occasional Uncles, a sequence,
by Timothy Dekin. Knife River
Press, $1.00
Reviewed by Dana Gioia
Occasional Uncles is a sequ
ence of 10 short poems written
by Timothy Dekin who teaches
creative writing here. The poems
are simple, brief and compel
ling, and the collection deserves
the attention of anyone in
terested in poetry. By itself this
modest sequence establishes
Dekin as a mature and conscien
tious poet of serious potential.
When the sequence opens, the
narrator and his wife are quietly
trying to repair an unhappy mar
riage. They have just moved into
a cabin in the country and the
attentive care they bestow on the
dirty cabin reflects their feelings
towards their own problematic
relationship:
We worked together, Face to
face, we washed
The cabin windows, rub
bing contrariwise.
Cutting through weather,
grease, we made almost
Invisible the glass between
our lives.

Dekin writes in what will
probably be called the
"Stanford style"

But the narrator knows that
the marriage is doomed to fai
lure. His obsessive self
consciousness brings him
deeper into himself and farther
from her. He is an emotional
hypochondriac and no love from
anyone will convince him he is
cured of his spiritual malaise.

Gradually the marriage de
teriorates and his wife begins her
own life with their son. Eventu
ally he visits them but feels like a
stranger in his own family. Sep
aration has only intensified his
sense of emotional isolation.
The book's ironic title
comes from the last poem in the
sequence. The narrator finally
gains permission to take his son
home with him for a visit. Their
boy is afraid in the unfamiliar
house and so he sleeps with his
father.
The poet doesn't sleep but
spends hours watching his
sleeping son. He realizes simul
taneously both how much he
loves his son and how incapable
he is of demonstrating it to the
boy in a natural way. His love
lacks the objectivity of a father
who lives everyday with his son:
When his tense fingers
tangle in my beard
To keep me where he's
dreaming. I annoy
His sleep with a kiss. I un
derstand
Those sad, occasional un
cles, how they spoil.
The Stanford style
Dekin writes in what one day
will probably be called the
"Stanford style." This approach
to poetry derives from the late
Ivor Winters, who taught at Stan
ford for over 30 years, and his
most gifted pupils, notably J.V.
Cunningham and Edgjr Bowers.
The "Stanford style" stresses
the rational content of verse.
Poetry must convey moral wis
dom, Winters taught, through
the disciplined and rational use
of language. In his own mature
poetry Winters also set the
example of using metrical forms
with strict regularity.

At its best this poetry can cap
ture the larger dimensions of a
particular situation in a convinc
ing and memorable way. Win
ters' approach regained some of
the ground poetry had lost in the
modern period. Once again
poets discoursed about impor
tant issues in comprehensible
ways shirking neither the intel

lectual nor moral respon
sibilities of their task.
At its worst such poetry be
came both stylistically and intel
lectually stilted. Winters' em
phasis on 17th century forms
and ideas often had a disastrous
effect on his less-gifted pupils.
Too often they distorted and re

duced their poems into grotes
que parodies of Ben Jonson or
Fulke Greville.
Purifying diction
Perhaps the greatest achieve
ment of modern American
poetry was its success in purify
ing its diction. Pound, Eliot, Ste
vens and especially Williams
managed to free American
poetry from the out-dated and
imprecise vocabulary it had un
critically borrowed from the Vic
torians. This renewal of lan
guage gave modern American
poetry much of its energy.
Even conservative poets like
Frost and MacLeish used a lan
guage consistently free of liter
ary cliches and anachronisms.
At its best their language was
clean, contemporary and
natural.
The strict metrical regularity
and the philosophical emphasis
of Winters' poetry had a bad ef
fect on some of his followers.
Anyone who has read through
collections by students of Win
ters will see how often they sac
rificed the quality of language in
their poems to fill in a meter pat
tern.
They often resorted to anac
hronisms, unnecessary adjec
tives, or stilted words to achieve
a superficial smoothness. They
were good craftsmen so their
poems were very rarely bad. Hut
language never came alive in
their poems and consequently
they produced almost no truly
impressive poems.
Form without formality
Dekin's poetry shows Winters'
influence at is best. His poems
make moral judgments without
moralizing. His poems show
form without being sepulch
rally formal. His poems may lack
a little of the necessary joy in

language for its own sake, but
this quality is less important in
narrative than in lyrical poems.
Dekin's poems manage to
create strong emotional re
sponses without being senti
mental. Although these poems
portray highly emotional situa
tions, their precise, objective
style keeps them on a factual
level which never declines into
vague emotionalism. Their sub
jectivity is conveyed in convinc
ing objective terms.
One of Dekin's strongest
points is his ability to create a
powerful emotional scene in a
few lines and describe it in a
striking simile. In one poem he
writes his wife:

One of Dekin's strongest
points is his ability to
create a powerful emo
tional scene in a few
lines. . .

This morning, with my cof
fee, with this page
On the bright kitchen tuhle,
with secrets near,
Retreat and loneliness I
love, I felt
Absence fall like a shadow
on the room -
Like one who drowsing in
the afternoon
Wakens to darkness, and
the sense of loss.
The sequence is consistently
impressive. Only one poem in
the entire sequence seems less
than excellent. The 10 poems
also combine into a convincing
and powerful sequence.
While they are individually
excellent, in the context of the

sequence they acquire addi
tional power. Dekin handles his
material admirably. Not one
poem is too long, and all of them
profit by being read in a specific
context.
A failure of language
The only weakness in this
sequence of poems is relatively
minor. Occasionally Dekin's ear
fails him and a line falls flat. For
example at one point he writes:
I suffer from my memory.
We never leurn. Expecting
to
We spoil what we do any
ways.
Forgiving ourselves as ive
have to.
We stay the same . . .
This passage begins admira
bly, but it falls flat in the middle.
"Anyways" is an unfortunate
word for both the; sound and the
sense. This one word mars an
otherwise perfect poem.
Dekin writes "confessional"
verse the way it should be writ
ten. He has a strong sense of ob
jectivity without losing his sym
pathy and understanding of the
personal emotions. He never
falls into self-pity. The three
characters of the sequence — the
mother, father and child —
emerge with a novelistic clarity.
Occasional Uncles also has
the considerable advantage of
brevity. Because Dekin has or
ganized anil condensed his
material so well a full story
emerges in only 10 short poems.
No good poet is ever afraid of
lucidity. It allows him to com
municate things as quickly and
effectively as possible.
Occasional Uncles has been

Occasional Uncles is a sequ
ence of 10 short poems written
by Timothy Dekin who teaches
creative writing here. The poems
are simple, brief and compel
ling, and the collection deserves
the attention of anyone in
terested in poetry. By itself this
modest sequence establishes
Dekin as a mature and conscien
tious poet of serious potential.
When the sequence opens, the
narrator and his wife are quietly
trying to repair an unhappy mar
riage. They have just moved into
a cabin in the country and the
attentive care they bestow on the
dirty cabin reflects their feelings
towards their own problematic
relationship:
We worked together, Face to
face, we washed
The cabin windows, rub
bing contrariwise.
Cutting through weather,
grease, we made almost
Invisible the glass between
our lives.

Dekin writes in what will
probably be called the
"Stanford style"

But the narrator knows that
the marriage is doomed to fai
lure. His obsessive self
consciousness brings him
deeper into himself and farther
from her. He is an emotional
hypochondriac and no love from
anyone will convince him he is
cured of his spiritual malaise.

Gradually the marriage de
teriorates and his wife begins her
own life with their son. Eventu
ally he visits them but feels like a
stranger in his own family. Sep
aration has only intensified his
sense of emotional isolation.
The book's ironic title
comes from the last poem in the
sequence. The narrator finally
gains permission to take his son
home with him for a visit. Their
boy is afraid in the unfamiliar
house and so he sleeps with his
father.
The poet doesn't sleep but
spends hours watching his
sleeping son. He realizes simul
taneously both how much he
loves his son and how incapable
he is of demonstrating it to the
boy in a natural way. His love
lacks the objectivity of a father
who lives everyday with his son:
When his tense fingers
tangle in my beard
To keep me where he's
dreaming. I annoy
His sleep with a kiss. I un
derstand
Those sad, occasional un
cles, how they spoil.
The Stanford style
Dekin writes in what one day
will probably be called the
"Stanford style." This approach
to poetry derives from the late
Ivor Winters, who taught at Stan
ford for over 30 years, and his
most gifted pupils, notably J.V.
Cunningham and Edgjr Bowers.
The "Stanford style" stresses
the rational content of verse.
Poetry must convey moral wis
dom, Winters taught, through
the disciplined and rational use
of language. In his own mature
poetry Winters also set the
example of using metrical forms
with strict regularity.

At its best this poetry can cap
ture the larger dimensions of a
particular situation in a convinc
ing and memorable way. Win
ters' approach regained some of
the ground poetry had lost in the
modern period. Once again
poets discoursed about impor
tant issues in comprehensible
ways shirking neither the intel

lectual nor moral respon
sibilities of their task.
At its worst such poetry be
came both stylistically and intel
lectually stilted. Winters' em
phasis on 17th century forms
and ideas often had a disastrous
effect on his less-gifted pupils.
Too often they distorted and re

duced their poems into grotes
que parodies of Ben Jonson or
Fulke Greville.
Purifying diction
Perhaps the greatest achieve
ment of modern American
poetry was its success in purify
ing its diction. Pound, Eliot, Ste
vens and especially Williams
managed to free American
poetry from the out-dated and
imprecise vocabulary it had un
critically borrowed from the Vic
torians. This renewal of lan
guage gave modern American
poetry much of its energy.
Even conservative poets like
Frost and MacLeish used a lan
guage consistently free of liter
ary cliches and anachronisms.
At its best their language was
clean, contemporary and
natural.
The strict metrical regularity
and the philosophical emphasis
of Winters' poetry had a bad ef
fect on some of his followers.
Anyone who has read through
collections by students of Win
ters will see how often they sac
rificed the quality of language in
their poems to fill in a meter pat
tern.
They often resorted to anac
hronisms, unnecessary adjec
tives, or stilted words to achieve
a superficial smoothness. They
were good craftsmen so their
poems were very rarely bad. Hut
language never came alive in
their poems and consequently
they produced almost no truly
impressive poems.
Form without formality
Dekin's poetry shows Winters'
influence at is best. His poems
make moral judgments without
moralizing. His poems show
form without being sepulch
rally formal. His poems may lack
a little of the necessary joy in

language for its own sake, but
this quality is less important in
narrative than in lyrical poems.
Dekin's poems manage to
create strong emotional re
sponses without being senti
mental. Although these poems
portray highly emotional situa
tions, their precise, objective
style keeps them on a factual
level which never declines into
vague emotionalism. Their sub
jectivity is conveyed in convinc
ing objective terms.
One of Dekin's strongest
points is his ability to create a
powerful emotional scene in a
few lines and describe it in a
striking simile. In one poem he
writes his wife:

One of Dekin's strongest
points is his ability to
create a powerful emo
tional scene in a few
lines. . .

This morning, with my cof
fee, with this page
On the bright kitchen tuhle,
with secrets near,
Retreat and loneliness I
love, I felt
Absence fall like a shadow
on the room -
Like one who drowsing in
the afternoon
Wakens to darkness, and
the sense of loss.
The sequence is consistently
impressive. Only one poem in
the entire sequence seems less
than excellent. The 10 poems
also combine into a convincing
and powerful sequence.
While they are individually
excellent, in the context of the

sequence they acquire addi
tional power. Dekin handles his
material admirably. Not one
poem is too long, and all of them
profit by being read in a specific
context.
A failure of language
The only weakness in this
sequence of poems is relatively
minor. Occasionally Dekin's ear
fails him and a line falls flat. For
example at one point he writes:
I suffer from my memory.
We never leurn. Expecting
to
We spoil what we do any
ways.
Forgiving ourselves as ive
have to.
We stay the same . . .
This passage begins admira
bly, but it falls flat in the middle.
"Anyways" is an unfortunate
word for both the; sound and the
sense. This one word mars an
otherwise perfect poem.
Dekin writes "confessional"
verse the way it should be writ
ten. He has a strong sense of ob
jectivity without losing his sym
pathy and understanding of the
personal emotions. He never
falls into self-pity. The three
characters of the sequence — the
mother, father and child —
emerge with a novelistic clarity.
Occasional Uncles also has
the considerable advantage of
brevity. Because Dekin has or
ganized anil condensed his
material so well a full story
emerges in only 10 short poems.
No good poet is ever afraid of

Occasional Uncles, a sequence,
by Timothy Dekin. Knife River
Press, $1.00
Reviewed by Dana Gioia
Occasional Uncles is a sequ
ence of 10 short poems written
by Timothy Dekin who teaches
creative writing here. The poems
are simple, brief and compel
ling, and the collection deserves
the attention of anyone in
terested in poetry. By itself this
modest sequence establishes
Dekin as a mature and conscien
tious poet of serious potential.
When the sequence opens, the
narrator and his wife are quietly
trying to repair an unhappy mar
riage. They have just moved into
a cabin in the country and the
attentive care they bestow on the
dirty cabin reflects their feelings
towards their own problematic
relationship:
We worked together, Face to
face, we washed
The cabin windows, rub
bing contrariwise.
Cutting through weather,
grease, we made almost
Invisible the glass between
our lives.

Dekin writes in what will
probably be called the
"Stanford style"

But the narrator knows that
the marriage is doomed to fai
lure. His obsessive self
consciousness brings him
deeper into himself and farther
from her. He is an emotional
hypochondriac and no love from
anyone will convince him he is
cured of his spiritual malaise.

Gradually the marriage de
teriorates and his wife begins her
own life with their son. Eventu
ally he visits them but feels like a
stranger in his own family. Sep
aration has only intensified his
sense of emotional isolation.
The book's ironic title
comes from the last poem in the
sequence. The narrator finally
gains permission to take his son
home with him for a visit. Their
boy is afraid in the unfamiliar
house and so he sleeps with his
father.
The poet doesn't sleep but
spends hours watching his
sleeping son. He realizes simul
taneously both how much he
loves his son and how incapable
he is of demonstrating it to the
boy in a natural way. His love
lacks the objectivity of a father
who lives everyday with his son:
When his tense fingers
tangle in my beard
To keep me where he's
dreaming. I annoy
His sleep with a kiss. I un
derstand
Those sad, occasional un
cles, how they spoil.
The Stanford style
Dekin writes in what one day
will probably be called the
"Stanford style." This approach
to poetry derives from the late
Ivor Winters, who taught at Stan
ford for over 30 years, and his
most gifted pupils, notably J.V.
Cunningham and Edgjr Bowers.
The "Stanford style" stresses
the rational content of verse.
Poetry must convey moral wis
dom, Winters taught, through
the disciplined and rational use
of language. In his own mature
poetry Winters also set the
example of using metrical forms
with strict regularity.

At its best this poetry can cap
ture the larger dimensions of a
particular situation in a convinc
ing and memorable way. Win
ters' approach regained some of
the ground poetry had lost in the
modern period. Once again
poets discoursed about impor
tant issues in comprehensible
ways shirking neither the intel

lectual nor moral respon
sibilities of their task.
At its worst such poetry be
came both stylistically and intel
lectually stilted. Winters' em
phasis on 17th century forms
and ideas often had a disastrous
effect on his less-gifted pupils.
Too often they distorted and re

duced their poems into grotes
que parodies of Ben Jonson or
Fulke Greville.
Purifying diction
Perhaps the greatest achieve
ment of modern American
poetry was its success in purify
ing its diction. Pound, Eliot, Ste
vens and especially Williams
managed to free American
poetry from the out-dated and
imprecise vocabulary it had un
critically borrowed from the Vic
torians. This renewal of lan
guage gave modern American
poetry much of its energy.
Even conservative poets like
Frost and MacLeish used a lan
guage consistently free of liter
ary cliches and anachronisms.
At its best their language was
clean, contemporary and
natural.
The strict metrical regularity
and the philosophical emphasis
of Winters' poetry had a bad ef
fect on some of his followers.
Anyone who has read through
collections by students of Win
ters will see how often they sac
rificed the quality of language in
their poems to fill in a meter pat
tern.
They often resorted to anac
hronisms, unnecessary adjec
tives, or stilted words to achieve
a superficial smoothness. They
were good craftsmen so their
poems were very rarely bad. Hut
language never came alive in
their poems and consequently
they produced almost no truly
impressive poems.
Form without formality
Dekin's poetry shows Winters'
influence at is best. His poems
make moral judgments without
moralizing. His poems show
form without being sepulch
rally formal. His poems may lack
a little of the necessary joy in

language for its own sake, but
this quality is less important in
narrative than in lyrical poems.
Dekin's poems manage to
create strong emotional re
sponses without being senti
mental. Although these poems
portray highly emotional situa
tions, their precise, objective
style keeps them on a factual
level which never declines into
vague emotionalism. Their sub
jectivity is conveyed in convinc
ing objective terms.
One of Dekin's strongest
points is his ability to create a
powerful emotional scene in a
few lines and describe it in a
striking simile. In one poem he
writes his wife:

One of Dekin's strongest
points is his ability to
create a powerful emo
tional scene in a few
lines. . .

This morning, with my cof
fee, with this page
On the bright kitchen tuhle,
with secrets near,
Retreat and loneliness I
love, I felt
Absence fall like a shadow
on the room -
Like one who drowsing in
the afternoon
Wakens to darkness, and
the sense of loss.
The sequence is consistently
impressive. Only one poem in
the entire sequence seems less
than excellent. The 10 poems
also combine into a convincing
and powerful sequence.
While they are individually
excellent, in the context of the

sequence they acquire addi
tional power. Dekin handles his
material admirably. Not one
poem is too long, and all of them
profit by being read in a specific
context.
A failure of language
The only weakness in this
sequence of poems is relatively
minor. Occasionally Dekin's ear
fails him and a line falls flat. For
example at one point he writes:
I suffer from my memory.
We never leurn. Expecting
to
We spoil what we do any
ways.
Forgiving ourselves as ive
have to.
We stay the same . . .
This passage begins admira
bly, but it falls flat in the middle.
"Anyways" is an unfortunate
word for both the; sound and the
sense. This one word mars an
otherwise perfect poem.
Dekin writes "confessional"
verse the way it should be writ
ten. He has a strong sense of ob
jectivity without losing his sym
pathy and understanding of the
personal emotions. He never
falls into self-pity. The three
characters of the sequence — the
mother, father and child —
emerge with a novelistic clarity.
Occasional Uncles also has
the considerable advantage of
brevity. Because Dekin has or
ganized anil condensed his

No good poet is ever afraid of
