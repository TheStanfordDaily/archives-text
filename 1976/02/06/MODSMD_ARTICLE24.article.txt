A P/U History of Menlo Park, by Martho Hopkins.
Martha Hopkins, $4.
Reviewed by George Williamson
Should Stanford students road an
exorbitantly-priced paperback book ($4 for 129
pages) quaintly titled A P/U History of Menlo
Park? I believe they should.
The book (the P/U stands for Partial and Unoffi
cial) is a chronicle of author Martha Hopkins'
personal fights to influence the growth of Menlo
Park City Council in 1968 and in 1970 (losing both
campaigns), and she has been active in the League
of Women Voters, the Committee for Green Foot
hills and other assorted civic projects.
Furthermore, she has single-handedly financed
the printing costs and arranged for the marketing
of her book.
Hopkins concentrates on her involvement with
specific, controversial issues presented to the
Menlo Park city government. Several involve
Stanford University: . . because of the size of its
land holdings and because of its sophistication
and ability to influence."
Some examples involving Stanford-Menlo Park
conflicts concerning Stanford land usage include

bike paths through the Alpine-Santa Cruz inter
section, the Willow Road extension (recently ap
proved) and the Research Institute (now
divorced from Stanford University).
The views Hopkins expresses are not impartial.
She works toward a Menlo Park designed for her
priorities. A large portion of the book consists of
letters she has written to the newspapers servic
ing the mid-Peninsula.
Her primary lesson is the extent and influence
exerted on community affairs by numerous gov
erment agencies and private interests. For exam
ple, agencies Hopkins contacted concerning flood
control of San Francisquito Creek (part of which
lies behind the Stanford Shopping Center) in
clude the Army Corps of Engineers, the State of
California, Santa Clara County Flood Control, San
Mateo County, East Palo Alto Municipal Advisory
Council and the city goverments of Menlo Park,
Atherton, Woodside and Portola Valley.
In addition, Hopkins covers tax usage, political
districting and financing of school and fire dis
tricts. She outlines the exact role and respon
sibilities of the Menlo Park city goverment.
Her report is of interest not only to current resi
dents of Menlo Park, but to all who hope to play an
active, constructive role in their community.
