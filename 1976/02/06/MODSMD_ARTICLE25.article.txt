## Card spikers set in 'trial' season 
### Jill Lieber 
The Stanford men's intercol
legiate volleyball team is start
ing from thebottomand working
its way up. Since volleyball is a
varsity club sport at Stanford
the team must fight for gym
space, has few spectators and re
ceives minimal publicity. First
year Card coach Art Lambert,
who also coaches water polo,
said the conditions under which
the team playsare "not ideal, but
betterthan what we had before."
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
asked Lambert to coach the vol
leyball team last year. Ruetz saw
the growing interest among stu
dents and decided a team was
needed.
"This season is a trial run,"
Lambert said. "Ruetz told me to
get the program going and he'd
evaluate it at the end of the year.
Many people in the administra
tive end of the Athletic Depart
ment believe that volleyball
could be a revenue-producing
sport and they look upon it
favorably."
Lambert feels that volleyball
"can become a full-fledged var
sity sport." The players are dedi
cated and willing to put in a lot
of time practicing. Lambert is
ready to learn along with them.
Newcomers
"Most of the players became
interested in volleyball after
they came to college. Ithinkonly
three boys played on high school
teams. They had to make ad
justments from their years of
playing club sports. Now vol
leyball is more demanding. They
have to make practices and
games so they have to budget
their time more. And the com
petition is more intense."
Stanford has played two teams
so far. The Barons beat IJC-
Davis, a team that Lambert said
was "supposed to be one of the
better teams in Northern
California." in three straight
games. Last weekend Stanford
knocked off Humboldt State in

three straight also.
The team is looking forward to
playing top-ranked UCLA this
weekend at Pauley Pavilion. The
unbeaten Bruins are powerful
again this year and have been
picked to win a sixth NCAA title
in the seven-year history of the
event. UCLA has two All -
Americans, but the Cards may be
in luck as one is out with a
shoulder injury. Lambert said he
doesn't know much about
UCLA, except that "they're
damn good."
Two-timer
Lambert admits he has never
coached volleyball before but is
familiar with the game as he has
taught classes in the sport. Much
of his time at Stanford has been
devoted to coaching and recruit
ing for water polo. Lambert said
that if volleyball were elevated
to a varsity sport, he wouldn't
mind coaching two varsity
sports each year.
"There are similarities be
tween coaching water polo and
volleyball. 1 see myself as a
teacher and a motivator."
Uphill climb
The intercollegiate volleyball
program is on the rise at Stan
ford, but Lambert said that he
can't estimate the number of
years it will take to build a solid
program — one that is supported
financially by the Athletic De
partment as well as one that gen
erates student interest.
"We just don't have the gym
facilities we need because we are
competing with varsity basket
ball," Lambert said. Varsity
sports take priority over club
sports. We are looking into the
possibility of making volleyball
a spring sport." This would have
to be a nation-wide change, ac
cording to Lambert.
Stanford's next home match
will be Friday. Feb. 20 at Maples
against Santa Clara at 9 p.m., fol
lowing the women's basketball
game.
