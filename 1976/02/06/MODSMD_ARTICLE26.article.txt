## Base grants on need 
### Ron Beck 
If you accept the premise that collegiate athle
tics should remain amateur, then the fact that
athletes from well-off households receive scho
larships at most colleges should be disturbing.
At Stanford, there are a number of athletes who
are essentially paid on the basis of athletic talent
to work at a sport. Financial need is not a pre
requisite for granting athletic scholarships at
Stanford.
If an athlete's family would not otherwise be
granted a scholarship, there is no difference bet
ween a $5000 athletic scholarship and a $5000
salary.
Considered in simple economic terms, the
household with a Stanford student on athletic
scholarship has at least $5000 more in income
than does a financially comparable family with a
Stanford student on no scholarship. Clearly, the
difference in the households' finances is that the
athlete's earns $5000 plus per year more than the
other.
If you believe that athletes do deserve to get
paid for collegiate competition, then granting ath
letic scholarships is the perfect answer.
Fortunately, though, the attitude of the Stan
ford administration for at least the past two years

has been to attempt a switch in athletic scholar
ship considerations.
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz told the Faculty Se
nate two years back that until finances are consi
dered, students who come from the most disad
vantaged backgrounds financially may not be able
to afford higher-cost institutions.
At last month's NCAA convention. Stanford's
representatives were among the most vocal prop
onents of a resolution that called for an end to
scholarships based solely on athletic ability. The
resolution lost by a 120-112 roll call vote, how
ever.
President Richard Lyman said last month that.
"We came close to winning on this issue. There is
pretty strong hope that with some organization
and follow through, we'll win on this point next
year."
At the 1974 convention, the same measure was
overwhelmingly defeated.
With a little more progressive thinking among
the NCAA member schools, part of the sham of
amateurism in collegiate athletics ran be elimi
nated.
Either colleges have to base athletic scholar
ships on need, or schools will have to stop r ex
tending that their athletes are amateurs.
