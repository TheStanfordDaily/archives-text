# Van Zandt churns towards high goals
## 
### Jill Lieber 
At first glance, Craig Van-
Zandt appears to be just another
tennis fanatic: tanned, glowing
skin, wearing a pastel colored
shirt, and carrying a tennis rac
quet. Actually Craig's ecstacy
paradoxically surfaces when he
is submerged in the depths of a
swimming pool. VanZandt, a
senior and co-captain of Stan
ford's men's swim team, has
been swimming for 14 years and
currently has his eye on the
Olympic trials.
"June's really got my
psyched," the lanky middle
distance swimmer said. "I've
been thinking of it for a long
time."
As a result VanZandt has been
training harder this year than he
ever has in his life. His strenuous

workouts started last summer
when he spent five to six hours
each day in the water and had
little time for anything else other
than eating and sleeping.
Then this fall he took time off
from the Stanford water polo
team to devote all his time to
swimming.
"Right now I think I've got the
most endurance in me I've ever
had," he said. "I don't have too
much speed right now. I hope
that will come from a little more
speed work in practice, but I
know I'm definitely stronger due
to weights and the pulley prog
ram."
After prompting from his sis
ters, he started swimming at the
age of seven. Some time later, his
sisters stopped swimming com
petitively because their shoul
ders were broadening and they

felt they were becoming too
muscular.
But VanZandt kept right on
churning through the water, and
his life started to revolve around
morning and afternoon work
outs, school, and eating and
sleeping. Swimming has put re
straints on him socially, but he
said, "It's been fun and I don't
regret it. You've got to make sac
rifices to get where you want to
go"
VanZandt, who transferred
from Foothill Community Col
lege following his freshman
year, said he has never been a

member of any "big" U.S. team
but hopes to be this year. Van-
Zandt's favorite race, the 200
yard free, will be a tough contest
for him, as some of swimming's
most heralded competitors are
also in the same event — big
names like Tim Shaw, Bruce
Furniss and Jim Montgomery.
"I'm the one who's going to go
up, everyone else is going to go
down. Furniss and Shaw are al
ready up there— they've got no
place to go but down. I've got no
place to go but up."
VanZandt's confidence and
strong inner drive plus his ob

session to become a member of
the 1976 United States Olympic
Swim Team are what it will take
to make his dream come true.
"You've got to tell yourself
you're feeling good."
That's true even in collegiate
meets. "Before I come to the pool
I listen to music. 1 turn on butt
kicking rock'n roll music. It
really gets me up."
VanZandt is one of the louder
members of the swim team. He
cheers his teammates on and
never seems to sit still. "I've
tried sitting around behind the
blocks about twenty minutes be
fore the race. You think about it
too much. Now 1 relax so that
when I get in I'll do it instinc
tively."
The conversation easily shifts
to tennis, and VanZandt's pas
sion for it becomes quite evident.
He is helping a friend teach a
beginning class this quarter and
finds it satisfying to watch
others develop in a game he
loves.
Because of his love for sports,
VanZandt, a psychology major,
hopes to enter Stanford's Secon
dary Teacher Education Prog
ram and get a master's degree
and his teaching credential in
physical education.
He is looking forward to
graduating this June and the end
of his swimming career because
that means he can devote "the
rest of (his) life to tennis." Until
then he must focus on the cur
rent goals he has set for himself.
VanZandt said that this is a big
quarter for him — in the pool. He
is excited about the Stanford
swim team and said he will give
it 110 percent effort. He hopes to
be in the top three at NCAA's in
March. "I figure if I do that it's
going to psych me up for June
and Montreal."

rent goals he has set for himself.
VanZandt said that this is a big
quarter for him — in the pool. He
is excited about the Stanford
swim team and said he will give
it 110 percent effort. He hopes to
be in the top three at NCAA's in
March. "I figure if I do that it's
going to psych me up for June
and Montreal."
At first glance, Craig Van-
Zandt appears to be just another
tennis fanatic: tanned, glowing
skin, wearing a pastel colored
shirt, and carrying a tennis rac
quet. Actually Craig's ecstacy
paradoxically surfaces when he
is submerged in the depths of a
swimming pool. VanZandt, a
senior and co-captain of Stan
ford's men's swim team, has
been swimming for 14 years and
currently has his eye on the
Olympic trials.
"June's really got my
psyched," the lanky middle
distance swimmer said. "I've
been thinking of it for a long
time."
As a result VanZandt has been
training harder this year than he
ever has in his life. His strenuous

workouts started last summer
when he spent five to six hours
each day in the water and had
little time for anything else other
than eating and sleeping.
Then this fall he took time off
from the Stanford water polo
team to devote all his time to
swimming.
"Right now I think I've got the
most endurance in me I've ever
had," he said. "I don't have too
much speed right now. I hope
that will come from a little more
speed work in practice, but I
know I'm definitely stronger due
to weights and the pulley prog
ram."
After prompting from his sis
ters, he started swimming at the
age of seven. Some time later, his
sisters stopped swimming com
petitively because their shoul
ders were broadening and they

felt they were becoming too
muscular.
But VanZandt kept right on
churning through the water, and
his life started to revolve around
morning and afternoon work
outs, school, and eating and
sleeping. Swimming has put re
straints on him socially, but he
said, "It's been fun and I don't
regret it. You've got to make sac
rifices to get where you want to
go"
VanZandt, who transferred
from Foothill Community Col
lege following his freshman
year, said he has never been a

member of any "big" U.S. team
but hopes to be this year. Van-
Zandt's favorite race, the 200
yard free, will be a tough contest
for him, as some of swimming's
most heralded competitors are
also in the same event — big
names like Tim Shaw, Bruce
Furniss and Jim Montgomery.
"I'm the one who's going to go
up, everyone else is going to go
down. Furniss and Shaw are al
ready up there— they've got no
place to go but down. I've got no
place to go but up."
VanZandt's confidence and
strong inner drive plus his ob

session to become a member of
the 1976 United States Olympic
Swim Team are what it will take
to make his dream come true.
"You've got to tell yourself
you're feeling good."
That's true even in collegiate
meets. "Before I come to the pool
I listen to music. 1 turn on butt
kicking rock'n roll music. It
really gets me up."
VanZandt is one of the louder
members of the swim team. He
cheers his teammates on and
never seems to sit still. "I've
tried sitting around behind the
blocks about twenty minutes be
fore the race. You think about it
too much. Now 1 relax so that
when I get in I'll do it instinc
tively."
The conversation easily shifts
to tennis, and VanZandt's pas
sion for it becomes quite evident.
He is helping a friend teach a
beginning class this quarter and
finds it satisfying to watch
others develop in a game he
loves.
Because of his love for sports,
VanZandt, a psychology major,
hopes to enter Stanford's Secon
dary Teacher Education Prog
ram and get a master's degree
and his teaching credential in
physical education.
He is looking forward to
graduating this June and the end
of his swimming career because
that means he can devote "the
rest of (his) life to tennis." Until
then he must focus on the cur
rent goals he has set for himself.
