# Starts this spring
## SCIRE sets interns plan 
### Janice Bressler 
SCIRE will launch an internship
program this spring aimed at linking
practical experience with classroom
learning. "Through this program,"
said SCIRE Director Alice Supton,
"students will earn credit for off
campus internships which comple
ment and enrich ongoing course
work."
Supton called the program a
"package deal, different from anything
now offered here." The package con
tains three areas of study:
—a parttime field placement, of 15
to 25 hours per week;
—a course in social science field re
search methods, directly related to
placement responsibilities; and

—a regular academic course provid
ing theoretical understanding of the
setting and the issues encountered in
field placement.
Gredit will be awarded on the basis
of the "intellectual work" involved in
the internships, shown through a pro
ject. The project can be anything from
a paper to a slide presentation, accord
ing to Supton, as long as it integrates
both the theoretical and practical
realms of an intern's experience.
Open to about 10 non-freshman un
dergraduates, an individual intern
ship program will run over one quarter
and will represent the total of a stu
dent's program.
Interested students will design their
internship program, finding field
work and choosing appropriate
courses, largely on their own. Help
will be available, however, at the
SCIRE office.
An internship coordinator working
half-time will administer the program,
screen placements, advise students
and offer a social science research
methods course to interns. The coor
dinator's salary will be the only major
program expense.
After having been on the SGIRE

drawing board tor over a year, the
program was recently approved as a
pilot project by the Office of Under
graduate Studies.
"There have been several plans" for
a program combining academic and
field activities, said Dean of Under
graduate Studies James Gibbs. "This
program draws upon the best of all the
previous ideas," he said.
Gibbs said he believes the internship
program is "a really excellent combi
nation of academic involvement and
research in the field."
