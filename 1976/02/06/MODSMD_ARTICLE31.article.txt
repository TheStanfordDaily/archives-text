# Youthful glovers excite Young

### Chris Baker 
First came the 'Young Giants,' but
the 'Young Cardinals'? What, is Stan
ford Sports Information Director Gary
Cavalli telling us that we're in for a
long baseball season, starting tomor
row at noon, when USF visits Sunken
Diamond for a season-opening twin
bill?
Well, you might bring a frosh book,
instead of a score card, with you to
morrow. The 1976 edition of Stan
ford's baseball team will be the
youngest ever, with 12 freshmen and
1 only five seniors on the roster.
The 1976 club will also leave its
mark on the Stanford record books.
Card coach Ray Young needs only 10
victories this year to pass Dutch Fehr
ing's school record of 290 coaching
wins. And Young figures to put his
name in the record books sometime
during the Cards' 55-game schedule.
'Very young team'
"We'll be a very young baseball team
this year, with very little experience at
the varsity level," said Young, "but we
definitely have the markings of an ex
cellent team."
Young lost the backbone of a pretty
good team. Gone from last year's 37-22
squad are pitcher A 1 Arthur, the
Cards' Most Valuable Player last year;
outfielder Bob Hampton, Stanford's
all-time career home run leader;
catcher Bruce Robinson, the No. 1 draft
choice of the Oakland A's last year;
# and All-League outfielder-catcher
Dave Baker, a sixth round pick of the
Philadelphia Phillies.
The infield will be strongest part of
this year's team. All-District-8
shortstop Steve Davis and All-League
third baseman Gary Pitchford head the
strong group of Card infielders. which
turned in two double plays in Stan
ford's 7-2 scrimmage win over a
Philadelphia Phillies' rookie squad
Tuesday. Davis batted .316 last year,
his third straight season over .300,
while Pitchford hit .318 in league play
last year.
Rounding out the infield are
sophomore Tom Guardino at first and
Dave Perez, Kevin Triggs or junior
Gary Bei at second.
'Unknown' outfield
The outfield is the most "unknown"
part of the team, said Young.

Freshman Larry Reynolds, a starting
cornerback on the football team, will
probably start in centerfield tomorrow.
Sophomore Pepe Hinojosa, who
played in early 50 games last year, will
get the starting nod in left field.
Freshman Mike Cordiroli, who may
also see action on the mound, will
probably start in rightfield tomorrow.
"None of our catchers has ever
played a minute of varsity ball," said
Young, junior Rusty Duquette, who
played two years of junior varsity
baseball, will be behind the plate to
morrow against USF. But he's being
pushed by freshmen Bruce Walters
and John Pyle and sophomore Rich
Bruzzone.
During last year's 9-9 league cam
paign, the Cards were hampered by a
rash of sore-armed pitchers. This year
Stanford has a host of hurlers. Young
will rely heavily on seven freshmen, a
group he calls, "one of the best, if not
the best, in Stanford history."
Seven new pitchers
The newcomers include left
handers Rob Irwin and Joe LoPresti,
and right-handers Mark Abbondola,
Bruce Fiala, Rich Hallsted, Brian Har
rison and Gary Komlofske.
Three juniors will form the
backbone of the pitching staff. John
Yandle (5-6), Jim Scharffenberger and
Jerry Argust will all see action this
weekend, said Young.
Yandle, described by Young as
"ready for a great year," had a 3.59
ERA last year. He struck out 89 batters.
Scharffenberger posted a 4-2 mark and
a 2.27 ERA. "Argust is coming on
strong after missing most of the season
with arm trouble," said Young.
Offensive plans
Offensively, Young plans to em
phasize the same thing he did last year
— speed. Last year the Cards set a
school record, stealing 141 bases.
Stanford will be competing in a new
league this year — the California Inter
collegiate Baseball Association. The
CIBA was reorganized this year when
the Pacific Eight was suspended. The
league will consist of five teams in
1976 — Stanford, California, USC,
UCLA and UC-Santa Barbara. Each
team will play a round-robin schedule
of 24 games, six against each oppo
nent.
