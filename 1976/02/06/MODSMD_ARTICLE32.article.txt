SEATTLE (AP) â€” A baffling zone
defense and Marques Johnson's 26
points yesterday night led the
ninth-ranked UCLA Bruins to a
92-H7 Pacific-8 basketball upset of
sixth-ranked Washington.
UCLA switched from man-to
man to the zone defense with about
12 minutes to play in the first half
when it trailed 24-20.

The Bruins then scored 10
straight points and never trailed
again though Washington cut its
deficit to 47-46 early in the second
period.
Oregon 72, Stanford 60
California 73, Oregon State 72
