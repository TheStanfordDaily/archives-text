Women cagers
Stanford's women cagers bowed to
San Francisco State 49-37 Wednesday
night on the Gales' home court. The
loss dropped the Cards' record to 5-3
and snapped their four game winning
streak.
Two weeks ago the Cards nipped
San Francisco 54-51 at Stanford and it
appeared through most of this contest
the result would be the same.
After a 19-19 tie at the half the Cards
took the lead on the board work of
Sukie Jackson, Onnie Killefer and
Maggie Nelson. With three minutes to
go, Stanford still held a five point lead
in front of a vociferous pro-San Fran
cisco crowd.
"But we suddenly got rattled and
just couldn't get the ball down court
against their press," Killefer said.
"Their full court press worked and
they were getting the open, close shots
in those last three minutes," she ad

ded.
Jackson led the Stanford scoring at
tack with 16 points but guards Peggy
Bruggman and Stephanie Galef were
used sparingly due to injuries.

Lacrosse
Stanford's lacrosse team opens its
season tomorrow here by hosting the
Northern California Lacrosse Tourna
ment. Participating in the tourney are
nine lacrosse teams and clubs other
than Stanford and California.
The tourney takes place on the field
next to Maples. Stanford's games are at
10 a.m. against the San Francisco La
crosse Club, at noon against the Mon
terey Lacrosse Club, and at 2 p.m.
against the North Bay Lacrosse Club.

played at 4 p.m.
Gymnastics
Stanford plays host to one of the
most exciting gymnastics meets of the
season, tomorrow night, when
California, Oregon and USC come to
Maples Pavilion for a four-way op
tional meet at 7:30 p.m. The Cards face
the same four teams Friday night at Cal
for a compulsory meet.
In the optionals, the gymnasts per
form routines of their own choosing. In
the compulsories, all performers must
go through the same moves.
According to Stanford coach Sadao
Hamada, there will be several Olympic
calibre specialists in the meet. He fore
casts outstanding performances and
some very difficult, entertaining
routines.
Some of those performances,
Hamada says, should come from the
Stanford team.

"Bobby Farb (all-around) has been
working on some new routines in the
last few meets and is now gaining con
sistency," the Stanford coach says. "1
am looking for him to take perhaps
four of the six events."
Hamada also predicts an excellent
effort from Ted Marcy, two-time
NCAA champion, on the side horse. It
will be an experimental meet of sorts
for Marcy. who will be trying a new,
more conservative dismount to see
how the judges receive it.
Defending NCAA champ California
is favored to take meet honors in the
quadrangular, led by '75 all-around tit
list Tom Weeden and teammate Tom
Beach.
According to Hamada, Oregon will
bring some outstanding specialists,
while USC finds strength in both the
all-around and individual events. Tro
jans standouts include all-around men
Glenn Jones and James Taylor.

ment. Participating in the tourney are
nine lacrosse teams and clubs other
than Stanford and California.
The tourney takes place on the field
next to Maples. Stanford's games are at
10 a.m. against the San Francisco La
crosse Club, at noon against the Mon
terey Lacrosse Club, and at 2 p.m.
against the North Bay Lacrosse Club.

Gymnastics
Stanford plays host to one of the
most exciting gymnastics meets of the
season, tomorrow night, when
California, Oregon and USC come to
Maples Pavilion for a four-way op
tional meet at 7:30 p.m. The Cards face
the same four teams Friday night at Cal
for a compulsory meet.
In the optionals, the gymnasts per
form routines of their own choosing. In
the compulsories, all performers must
go through the same moves.
According to Stanford coach Sadao
Hamada, there will be several Olympic
calibre specialists in the meet. He fore
casts outstanding performances and
some very difficult, entertaining
routines.
Some of those performances,
Hamada says, should come from the
Stanford team.

"Bobby Farb (all-around) has been
working on some new routines in the
last few meets and is now gaining con
sistency," the Stanford coach says. "1
am looking for him to take perhaps
four of the six events."
Hamada also predicts an excellent
effort from Ted Marcy, two-time
NCAA champion, on the side horse. It
will be an experimental meet of sorts
for Marcy. who will be trying a new,
more conservative dismount to see
how the judges receive it.
Defending NCAA champ California
is favored to take meet honors in the
quadrangular, led by '75 all-around tit
list Tom Weeden and teammate Tom
Beach.
According to Hamada, Oregon will
bring some outstanding specialists,
while USC finds strength in both the
all-around and individual events. Tro
jans standouts include all-around men
Glenn Jones and James Taylor.

Women cagers
Stanford's women cagers bowed to
San Francisco State 49-37 Wednesday
night on the Gales' home court. The
loss dropped the Cards' record to 5-3
and snapped their four game winning
streak.
Two weeks ago the Cards nipped
San Francisco 54-51 at Stanford and it
appeared through most of this contest
the result would be the same.
After a 19-19 tie at the half the Cards
took the lead on the board work of
Sukie Jackson, Onnie Killefer and
Maggie Nelson. With three minutes to
go, Stanford still held a five point lead
in front of a vociferous pro-San Fran
cisco crowd.
"But we suddenly got rattled and
just couldn't get the ball down court
against their press," Killefer said.
"Their full court press worked and
they were getting the open, close shots
in those last three minutes," she ad

ded.
Jackson led the Stanford scoring at
tack with 16 points but guards Peggy
Bruggman and Stephanie Galef were
used sparingly due to injuries.
