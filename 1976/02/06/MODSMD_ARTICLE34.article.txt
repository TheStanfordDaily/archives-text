# Card gymnast looks to summer in Montreal
## 
### Gary Sprague 
On weekday afternoons, Encina gym has the look
of a YMCA all purpose room.
Music blares from a radio as the gymnastics team
holds a low key workout. Wrestlers grapple near
the far wall, and a lonely light-heavyweight pokes
reluctantly at the heavy bag. A few women gym
nasts take turns teetering on the balance beam and
turning flips on the trampoline. It seems like an
unlikely place to find world class talent.
But Bobby Farb is definitely world class. Farb,
the number one all around man on the Stanford
gymnastics team, has his eye set on the summer
Olympic games.
Farb, a sophomore from Oceanside, N.Y., has
great natural talent, but it is his fierce competitive
drive that is pushing him towards the top. His in
tensity is his defining characteristic, and is a trait
which he applies to all aspects of his life.
'Aggressive competitor'
Farb, says gymnastics coach SadaoHamada, "is a
very aggressive type of competitor." Farb himself
prefers to talk in terms of "concentration."
"Concentration," he says, "is very important in
gymnastics. Anything in life is really tough, and
being an athlete makes it that much more demand
ing." Intense concentration, he adds, is vital to per
forming to his abilities.
Those abilities are considerable. The average
gymnast combines talent and hard work in about a
50-50 ratio, said Farb. "But to be a top gymnast," he
said, "you have to have a lot more talent. Likeabout
85 percent talent .... I guess I'm in the 85 percent."
Farb started competing in ninth grade, then won
New York State championships in all around, floor
exercise and parallel bars three straight years. With
these victories under his belt, Farb began to eye the
Olympics.
"When I first saw the Olympics," he said, "I
guess it was '68,1 was just starting gymnastics, and
I thought I'd like to be in them. If I worked hard, I
thought I could do it." Upon further prodding, he
admits that participating in the games has been a
"definite goal" since then.
Dedication taking toll
But even as Farb looks to make his mark on gym
nastics. his dedication to the sport is taking its toll
on him. Farb is naturally shy, and his gymnastic,
demands have kept him isolated from much of the
campus life.
"I don't really know too many people on campus
very well," he muses, with a touch of regret in his
voice. "A big reason is that I spend so much time in

the gym. I have to spend the rest of my time study
ing and catching up.
"Yea, sometimes I feel that gymnastics is detri
mental to me, to being a person. But then there are
the good parts, like being at the meets. I love work
ing out. There are good things and bad things about
whatever you do. You just have to take it."
Looking back on his year-round training
schedule, Farb concedes that the demands of his
sport have indeed changed his lifestyle. "At
home," he says, "people relate to me as a person.
Here, more people than usual treat me on an athle
tic basis."
Last year. Farb managed to avoid the freshman
on-campus residence requirement and moved off
campus. Teammate Ted Marcy called the move "a
mistake." and commented that it added to Farb's
isolation.
Farb is decidedly reserved with strangers. His
answers are short, with hesitant elaboration. His
embarrassment is visible when he talks of his na
tional ranking. Farb is especially reluctant to dis
cuss personal matters; he is at his most garrulous
when talking of the technical aspects of his sport.
'Quiet little guy'
But there is another side to Bobby Farb. a side that
only his close friends see. "He's pretty shy with
people he doesn't know."says Marcy. "When I first
met him I thought he was a real quiet little guy. But
he's easy to talk to if you know him."
In fact, there's more than a little of the mischievi
ous imp in Farb. Marcy labels him an "innocent
troublemaker." "The things he gets away with."
exclaims Marcy. rolling his eyes totheceiling. "But
he looks just like a little kid, how can you blame
him?"
Marcy's characterization is apt. At 5-foot-2 and
112 pounds, Farb is anything but physically impos
ing. His dark hair and features complement decep
tively sly smile, a smile that sneaks up on you as a
mischievous grin.
Waitress intimidation is one of Farb's
specialities. "He's a funny guy." says Marcy, "he's
got a lot of nerve at times. He's done a lot of really
weird things."
Fooled attractive singer
One night in a Los Angeles cocktail bar, Marcy
relates, Farb liked tin? looks of an attractive singer.
Sidling up to his victim, Farb told her that he was
tin? son (if tin' entertainment director of a big San
Francisco hotel. Thinking that opportunity was
knocking, tin? singer showered Farb with publicity
photos, and made sure Bob had her name and

phone number. Farb made off with his haul; she's
still waiting for his call.
Farb's underlying enthusiasm penetrated his re
served veneer only once during the interview. Mak
ing a great effort to control his voice, so as not to
betray his excitement, he asked, "It's going to be a
feature? Wow!" His eyes lit up with anticipation.
"Will they have a picture? Do they have any pic
tures of me doing gymnastics stuff?"
Right now, the chance to do that gymnastics stuff
in the Olympic games is Farb's ultimate goal. "I'm
doing a lot more (routines)," he said, "with more
difficulty. And my scores are going up." He cited a
recent 9.5 on the high bar and a 9.1 on the parallel
bars, which included a fall on the dismount.
Hamada agrees that Farb's routines are shaping
up pretty well. "In the last two competitions,"
Hamada said, "he tried two new routines. He made
about half. Hut with a little more experience, he
ought to be able to hit on all."
His training routine for the Olympic qualifica
tions is not much different from his regular regi
men. He works out three hours a day, six days a
week. But other than that, Farb said, he leads "a
pretty normal life."
He does have to watch out for his safety though,
headds. a smilecurling theedges of his mouth. "So
I try not to ski too much."
Farb's trip to Japan last summer has helped him
put athletics into perspective. "In Japan," he says,
"gymnastics is the number one priority. In the U.S.
it's different. You can't just say I'm an athlete." He
ranks being an athlete equal in importance with his
roles as student and person.
Farb prides himself on the overall abilities
needed to be an all around man. He draws a parallel
with his studies, saying that in that sphere too, he
tries to be an all around performer. Yet he finds that
it is difficult to be both an accomplished athlete and
a student as well.
"Everyone here is a student," he said. "I spend
four hours in the gym, so I'm really tired. When it
comes to studying, it's a real disadvantage. It's hard
to be a student and an athlete at the same time."
Farb is truly a dedicated athlete. "It's part of my
life rather than just a sport," he says. He's motivated
to compete by the excitement of competitive pres
sure. the thrill of victory, and the feel of his body
performing the difficult routines. He sums up the
excitement of competition: "It's like a natural
high."
Bobby Farb is looking to ride that high all the way
to Montreal.

very aggressive type of competitor." Farb himself
prefers to talk in terms of "concentration."
"Concentration," he says, "is very important in
gymnastics. Anything in life is really tough, and
being an athlete makes it that much more demand
ing." Intense concentration, he adds, is vital to per
forming to his abilities.
Those abilities are considerable. The average
gymnast combines talent and hard work in about a
50-50 ratio, said Farb. "But to be a top gymnast," he
said, "you have to have a lot more talent. Likeabout
85 percent talent .... I guess I'm in the 85 percent."
Farb started competing in ninth grade, then won
New York State championships in all around, floor
exercise and parallel bars three straight years. With
these victories under his belt, Farb began to eye the
Olympics.
"When I first saw the Olympics," he said, "I
guess it was '68,1 was just starting gymnastics, and
I thought I'd like to be in them. If I worked hard, I
thought I could do it." Upon further prodding, he
admits that participating in the games has been a
"definite goal" since then.
Dedication taking toll
But even as Farb looks to make his mark on gym
nastics. his dedication to the sport is taking its toll
on him. Farb is naturally shy, and his gymnastic,
demands have kept him isolated from much of the
campus life.
"I don't really know too many people on campus
very well," he muses, with a touch of regret in his
voice. "A big reason is that I spend so much time in

the gym. I have to spend the rest of my time study
ing and catching up.
"Yea, sometimes I feel that gymnastics is detri
mental to me, to being a person. But then there are
the good parts, like being at the meets. I love work
ing out. There are good things and bad things about
whatever you do. You just have to take it."
Looking back on his year-round training
schedule, Farb concedes that the demands of his
sport have indeed changed his lifestyle. "At
home," he says, "people relate to me as a person.
Here, more people than usual treat me on an athle
tic basis."
Last year. Farb managed to avoid the freshman
on-campus residence requirement and moved off
campus. Teammate Ted Marcy called the move "a
mistake." and commented that it added to Farb's
isolation.
Farb is decidedly reserved with strangers. His
answers are short, with hesitant elaboration. His
embarrassment is visible when he talks of his na
tional ranking. Farb is especially reluctant to dis
cuss personal matters; he is at his most garrulous
when talking of the technical aspects of his sport.
'Quiet little guy'
But there is another side to Bobby Farb. a side that
only his close friends see. "He's pretty shy with
people he doesn't know."says Marcy. "When I first
met him I thought he was a real quiet little guy. But
he's easy to talk to if you know him."
In fact, there's more than a little of the mischievi
ous imp in Farb. Marcy labels him an "innocent
troublemaker." "The things he gets away with."
exclaims Marcy. rolling his eyes totheceiling. "But
he looks just like a little kid, how can you blame
him?"
Marcy's characterization is apt. At 5-foot-2 and
112 pounds, Farb is anything but physically impos
ing. His dark hair and features complement decep
tively sly smile, a smile that sneaks up on you as a
mischievous grin.
Waitress intimidation is one of Farb's
specialities. "He's a funny guy." says Marcy, "he's
got a lot of nerve at times. He's done a lot of really
weird things."
Fooled attractive singer
One night in a Los Angeles cocktail bar, Marcy
relates, Farb liked tin? looks of an attractive singer.
Sidling up to his victim, Farb told her that he was
tin? son (if tin' entertainment director of a big San
Francisco hotel. Thinking that opportunity was
knocking, tin? singer showered Farb with publicity
photos, and made sure Bob had her name and

phone number. Farb made off with his haul; she's
still waiting for his call.
Farb's underlying enthusiasm penetrated his re
served veneer only once during the interview. Mak
ing a great effort to control his voice, so as not to
betray his excitement, he asked, "It's going to be a
feature? Wow!" His eyes lit up with anticipation.
"Will they have a picture? Do they have any pic
tures of me doing gymnastics stuff?"
Right now, the chance to do that gymnastics stuff
in the Olympic games is Farb's ultimate goal. "I'm
doing a lot more (routines)," he said, "with more
difficulty. And my scores are going up." He cited a
recent 9.5 on the high bar and a 9.1 on the parallel
bars, which included a fall on the dismount.
Hamada agrees that Farb's routines are shaping
up pretty well. "In the last two competitions,"
Hamada said, "he tried two new routines. He made
about half. Hut with a little more experience, he
ought to be able to hit on all."
His training routine for the Olympic qualifica
tions is not much different from his regular regi
men. He works out three hours a day, six days a
week. But other than that, Farb said, he leads "a
pretty normal life."
He does have to watch out for his safety though,
headds. a smilecurling theedges of his mouth. "So
I try not to ski too much."
Farb's trip to Japan last summer has helped him
put athletics into perspective. "In Japan," he says,
"gymnastics is the number one priority. In the U.S.
it's different. You can't just say I'm an athlete." He
ranks being an athlete equal in importance with his
roles as student and person.
Farb prides himself on the overall abilities
needed to be an all around man. He draws a parallel
with his studies, saying that in that sphere too, he
tries to be an all around performer. Yet he finds that
it is difficult to be both an accomplished athlete and
a student as well.
"Everyone here is a student," he said. "I spend
four hours in the gym, so I'm really tired. When it
comes to studying, it's a real disadvantage. It's hard
to be a student and an athlete at the same time."
Farb is truly a dedicated athlete. "It's part of my
life rather than just a sport," he says. He's motivated
to compete by the excitement of competitive pres
sure. the thrill of victory, and the feel of his body
performing the difficult routines. He sums up the
excitement of competition: "It's like a natural
high."
Bobby Farb is looking to ride that high all the way
to Montreal.

On weekday afternoons, Encina gym has the look
of a YMCA all purpose room.
Music blares from a radio as the gymnastics team
holds a low key workout. Wrestlers grapple near
the far wall, and a lonely light-heavyweight pokes
reluctantly at the heavy bag. A few women gym
nasts take turns teetering on the balance beam and
turning flips on the trampoline. It seems like an
unlikely place to find world class talent.
But Bobby Farb is definitely world class. Farb,
the number one all around man on the Stanford
gymnastics team, has his eye set on the summer
Olympic games.
Farb, a sophomore from Oceanside, N.Y., has
great natural talent, but it is his fierce competitive
drive that is pushing him towards the top. His in
tensity is his defining characteristic, and is a trait
which he applies to all aspects of his life.

I thought I'd like to be in them. If I worked hard, I
thought I could do it." Upon further prodding, he
admits that participating in the games has been a
"definite goal" since then.
Dedication taking toll
But even as Farb looks to make his mark on gym
nastics. his dedication to the sport is taking its toll
on him. Farb is naturally shy, and his gymnastic,
demands have kept him isolated from much of the
campus life.
"I don't really know too many people on campus
very well," he muses, with a touch of regret in his
voice. "A big reason is that I spend so much time in

the gym. I have to spend the rest of my time study
ing and catching up.
"Yea, sometimes I feel that gymnastics is detri
mental to me, to being a person. But then there are
the good parts, like being at the meets. I love work
ing out. There are good things and bad things about
whatever you do. You just have to take it."
Looking back on his year-round training
schedule, Farb concedes that the demands of his
sport have indeed changed his lifestyle. "At
home," he says, "people relate to me as a person.
Here, more people than usual treat me on an athle
tic basis."
Last year. Farb managed to avoid the freshman
on-campus residence requirement and moved off
campus. Teammate Ted Marcy called the move "a
mistake." and commented that it added to Farb's
isolation.
Farb is decidedly reserved with strangers. His
answers are short, with hesitant elaboration. His
embarrassment is visible when he talks of his na
tional ranking. Farb is especially reluctant to dis
cuss personal matters; he is at his most garrulous
when talking of the technical aspects of his sport.
'Quiet little guy'
But there is another side to Bobby Farb. a side that
only his close friends see. "He's pretty shy with
people he doesn't know."says Marcy. "When I first
met him I thought he was a real quiet little guy. But
he's easy to talk to if you know him."
In fact, there's more than a little of the mischievi
ous imp in Farb. Marcy labels him an "innocent
troublemaker." "The things he gets away with."
exclaims Marcy. rolling his eyes totheceiling. "But
he looks just like a little kid, how can you blame
him?"
Marcy's characterization is apt. At 5-foot-2 and
112 pounds, Farb is anything but physically impos
ing. His dark hair and features complement decep
tively sly smile, a smile that sneaks up on you as a
mischievous grin.
Waitress intimidation is one of Farb's
specialities. "He's a funny guy." says Marcy, "he's
got a lot of nerve at times. He's done a lot of really
weird things."
Fooled attractive singer
One night in a Los Angeles cocktail bar, Marcy
relates, Farb liked tin? looks of an attractive singer.
Sidling up to his victim, Farb told her that he was
tin? son (if tin' entertainment director of a big San
Francisco hotel. Thinking that opportunity was
knocking, tin? singer showered Farb with publicity
photos, and made sure Bob had her name and

phone number. Farb made off with his haul; she's
still waiting for his call.
Farb's underlying enthusiasm penetrated his re
served veneer only once during the interview. Mak
ing a great effort to control his voice, so as not to
betray his excitement, he asked, "It's going to be a
feature? Wow!" His eyes lit up with anticipation.
"Will they have a picture? Do they have any pic
tures of me doing gymnastics stuff?"
Right now, the chance to do that gymnastics stuff
in the Olympic games is Farb's ultimate goal. "I'm
doing a lot more (routines)," he said, "with more
difficulty. And my scores are going up." He cited a
recent 9.5 on the high bar and a 9.1 on the parallel
bars, which included a fall on the dismount.
Hamada agrees that Farb's routines are shaping
up pretty well. "In the last two competitions,"
Hamada said, "he tried two new routines. He made
about half. Hut with a little more experience, he
ought to be able to hit on all."
His training routine for the Olympic qualifica
tions is not much different from his regular regi
men. He works out three hours a day, six days a
week. But other than that, Farb said, he leads "a
pretty normal life."
He does have to watch out for his safety though,
headds. a smilecurling theedges of his mouth. "So
I try not to ski too much."
Farb's trip to Japan last summer has helped him
put athletics into perspective. "In Japan," he says,
"gymnastics is the number one priority. In the U.S.
it's different. You can't just say I'm an athlete." He
ranks being an athlete equal in importance with his
roles as student and person.
Farb prides himself on the overall abilities
needed to be an all around man. He draws a parallel
with his studies, saying that in that sphere too, he
tries to be an all around performer. Yet he finds that
it is difficult to be both an accomplished athlete and
a student as well.
"Everyone here is a student," he said. "I spend
four hours in the gym, so I'm really tired. When it
comes to studying, it's a real disadvantage. It's hard
to be a student and an athlete at the same time."
Farb is truly a dedicated athlete. "It's part of my
life rather than just a sport," he says. He's motivated
to compete by the excitement of competitive pres
sure. the thrill of victory, and the feel of his body
performing the difficult routines. He sums up the
excitement of competition: "It's like a natural
high."
Bobby Farb is looking to ride that high all the way
to Montreal.


Gymnast Bob Farb c " Ch *"* Pa l "
On weekday afternoons, Encina gym has the look
of a YMCA all purpose room.
Music blares from a radio as the gymnastics team
holds a low key workout. Wrestlers grapple near
the far wall, and a lonely light-heavyweight pokes
reluctantly at the heavy bag. A few women gym
nasts take turns teetering on the balance beam and
turning flips on the trampoline. It seems like an
unlikely place to find world class talent.
But Bobby Farb is definitely world class. Farb,
the number one all around man on the Stanford
gymnastics team, has his eye set on the summer
Olympic games.
Farb, a sophomore from Oceanside, N.Y., has
great natural talent, but it is his fierce competitive
drive that is pushing him towards the top. His in
tensity is his defining characteristic, and is a trait
which he applies to all aspects of his life.
'Aggressive competitor'
Farb, says gymnastics coach SadaoHamada, "is a
very aggressive type of competitor." Farb himself
prefers to talk in terms of "concentration."
"Concentration," he says, "is very important in
gymnastics. Anything in life is really tough, and
being an athlete makes it that much more demand
ing." Intense concentration, he adds, is vital to per
forming to his abilities.
Those abilities are considerable. The average
gymnast combines talent and hard work in about a
50-50 ratio, said Farb. "But to be a top gymnast," he
said, "you have to have a lot more talent. Likeabout
85 percent talent .... I guess I'm in the 85 percent."
Farb started competing in ninth grade, then won
New York State championships in all around, floor
exercise and parallel bars three straight years. With
these victories under his belt, Farb began to eye the
Olympics.
"When I first saw the Olympics," he said, "I
guess it was '68,1 was just starting gymnastics, and
I thought I'd like to be in them. If I worked hard, I
thought I could do it." Upon further prodding, he

ing out. There are good things and bad things about
whatever you do. You just have to take it."
Looking back on his year-round training
schedule, Farb concedes that the demands of his
sport have indeed changed his lifestyle. "At
home," he says, "people relate to me as a person.
Here, more people than usual treat me on an athle
tic basis."
Last year. Farb managed to avoid the freshman
on-campus residence requirement and moved off
campus. Teammate Ted Marcy called the move "a
mistake." and commented that it added to Farb's
isolation.
Farb is decidedly reserved with strangers. His
answers are short, with hesitant elaboration. His
embarrassment is visible when he talks of his na
tional ranking. Farb is especially reluctant to dis
cuss personal matters; he is at his most garrulous
when talking of the technical aspects of his sport.
'Quiet little guy'
But there is another side to Bobby Farb. a side that
only his close friends see. "He's pretty shy with
people he doesn't know."says Marcy. "When I first
met him I thought he was a real quiet little guy. But
he's easy to talk to if you know him."
In fact, there's more than a little of the mischievi
ous imp in Farb. Marcy labels him an "innocent
troublemaker." "The things he gets away with."
exclaims Marcy. rolling his eyes totheceiling. "But
he looks just like a little kid, how can you blame
him?"
Marcy's characterization is apt. At 5-foot-2 and
112 pounds, Farb is anything but physically impos
ing. His dark hair and features complement decep
tively sly smile, a smile that sneaks up on you as a
mischievous grin.
Waitress intimidation is one of Farb's
specialities. "He's a funny guy." says Marcy, "he's
got a lot of nerve at times. He's done a lot of really
weird things."
Fooled attractive singer
One night in a Los Angeles cocktail bar, Marcy
relates, Farb liked tin? looks of an attractive singer.
Sidling up to his victim, Farb told her that he was
tin? son (if tin' entertainment director of a big San
Francisco hotel. Thinking that opportunity was
knocking, tin? singer showered Farb with publicity
photos, and made sure Bob had her name and

phone number. Farb made off with his haul; she's
still waiting for his call.
Farb's underlying enthusiasm penetrated his re
served veneer only once during the interview. Mak
ing a great effort to control his voice, so as not to
betray his excitement, he asked, "It's going to be a
feature? Wow!" His eyes lit up with anticipation.
"Will they have a picture? Do they have any pic
tures of me doing gymnastics stuff?"
Right now, the chance to do that gymnastics stuff
in the Olympic games is Farb's ultimate goal. "I'm
doing a lot more (routines)," he said, "with more
difficulty. And my scores are going up." He cited a
recent 9.5 on the high bar and a 9.1 on the parallel
bars, which included a fall on the dismount.
Hamada agrees that Farb's routines are shaping
up pretty well. "In the last two competitions,"
Hamada said, "he tried two new routines. He made
about half. Hut with a little more experience, he
ought to be able to hit on all."
His training routine for the Olympic qualifica
tions is not much different from his regular regi
men. He works out three hours a day, six days a
week. But other than that, Farb said, he leads "a
pretty normal life."
He does have to watch out for his safety though,
headds. a smilecurling theedges of his mouth. "So
I try not to ski too much."
Farb's trip to Japan last summer has helped him
put athletics into perspective. "In Japan," he says,
"gymnastics is the number one priority. In the U.S.
it's different. You can't just say I'm an athlete." He
ranks being an athlete equal in importance with his
roles as student and person.
Farb prides himself on the overall abilities
needed to be an all around man. He draws a parallel
with his studies, saying that in that sphere too, he
tries to be an all around performer. Yet he finds that
it is difficult to be both an accomplished athlete and
a student as well.
"Everyone here is a student," he said. "I spend
four hours in the gym, so I'm really tired. When it
comes to studying, it's a real disadvantage. It's hard
to be a student and an athlete at the same time."
Farb is truly a dedicated athlete. "It's part of my
life rather than just a sport," he says. He's motivated
to compete by the excitement of competitive pres
sure. the thrill of victory, and the feel of his body
performing the difficult routines. He sums up the
excitement of competition: "It's like a natural
high."
Bobby Farb is looking to ride that high all the way
to Montreal.


Gymnast Bob Farb c " Ch *"* Pa l "
On weekday afternoons, Encina gym has the look
of a YMCA all purpose room.
Music blares from a radio as the gymnastics team
holds a low key workout. Wrestlers grapple near
the far wall, and a lonely light-heavyweight pokes
reluctantly at the heavy bag. A few women gym
nasts take turns teetering on the balance beam and
turning flips on the trampoline. It seems like an
unlikely place to find world class talent.
But Bobby Farb is definitely world class. Farb,
the number one all around man on the Stanford
gymnastics team, has his eye set on the summer
Olympic games.
Farb, a sophomore from Oceanside, N.Y., has
great natural talent, but it is his fierce competitive
drive that is pushing him towards the top. His in
tensity is his defining characteristic, and is a trait
which he applies to all aspects of his life.
'Aggressive competitor'
Farb, says gymnastics coach SadaoHamada, "is a
very aggressive type of competitor." Farb himself
prefers to talk in terms of "concentration."
"Concentration," he says, "is very important in
gymnastics. Anything in life is really tough, and
being an athlete makes it that much more demand
ing." Intense concentration, he adds, is vital to per
forming to his abilities.
Those abilities are considerable. The average
gymnast combines talent and hard work in about a
50-50 ratio, said Farb. "But to be a top gymnast," he
said, "you have to have a lot more talent. Likeabout
85 percent talent .... I guess I'm in the 85 percent."
Farb started competing in ninth grade, then won
New York State championships in all around, floor
exercise and parallel bars three straight years. With
these victories under his belt, Farb began to eye the
Olympics.
"When I first saw the Olympics," he said, "I
guess it was '68,1 was just starting gymnastics, and
I thought I'd like to be in them. If I worked hard, I
thought I could do it." Upon further prodding, he
admits that participating in the games has been a
"definite goal" since then.
Dedication taking toll
But even as Farb looks to make his mark on gym
nastics. his dedication to the sport is taking its toll
on him. Farb is naturally shy, and his gymnastic,
demands have kept him isolated from much of the
campus life.
"I don't really know too many people on campus
very well," he muses, with a touch of regret in his
voice. "A big reason is that I spend so much time in

the gym. I have to spend the rest of my time study
ing and catching up.
"Yea, sometimes I feel that gymnastics is detri
mental to me, to being a person. But then there are
the good parts, like being at the meets. I love work
ing out. There are good things and bad things about
whatever you do. You just have to take it."
Looking back on his year-round training
