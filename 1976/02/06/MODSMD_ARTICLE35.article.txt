Earthquake kills 3000
GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala — The estimate
of casualties in Guatemala's devastating ear
thquake was increased by officials yesterday to
3000 dead and about 15,000 injured.
Col. Guillermo Echeverria Vielams, duty coor
dinator at a special emergency committee set up by
the Defense Ministry, reported the new figures last
night and said more than 10,000 persons were left
homeless.
Echeverria said the figures might increase further
as communications were improved and more re
ports came in from the countryside.
Italy forms new government
ROME — Premier-designate Aldo Moro had a
clear road yesterday to form a new government after
the Socialist, Social Democratic and Republican
parties all voted to support a minority Christian
Democratic administration at least by abstaining on
parliamentary confidence votes.
Moro's breakthrough came on the 29th day of
Italy's 23nd postwar crisis and after all attempts to
form a majority government had failed.
The Socialists, who caused the collapse of the
last government on Jan. 7 in disagreement over
economic policy, voted for parliamentary absten
tion rather than premature general elections after
approving an economic austerity program unveiled
by Moro on Wednesday night.
Promises of Republican abstension and Social
Democratic support followed only hours later.
France flies aid to Djibouti
DJIBOUTI, Territory of the Afars and Issas —
France airlifted 800 reinforcements yesterday to its
garrison of 4000 men in this strategic Red Sea col
ony following a shootout on the border of the
neighboring, Soviet-backed Peoples Republic of
Somalia.
Heavy forces were reported deployed on both
sides of the border after French soldiers killed
seven gunmer Wednesday in a clash near the
Somalian border. French tanks were in camou
flaged positions on the road leading from Djibouti
to the frontier some 12 miles away.
In the 15-minute firelight Wednesday French
sharp-shooters shot down Somali-backed gunmen

holding 31 French children and two adults hostage
in a hijacked French air force school bus. The gun
men demanded immediate independence for Djib
outi.
In the shooting one child was killed, five injured
and one was missing and believed taken into
Somalia.
The French said the Somalis opened fire, while
Somalia claimed the French made an unprovoked
attack on the Somali frontier post, killed six
policemen and destroyed the post and an adjacent
village. After the clash, sporadic shooting repor
tedly continued for some hours.
Sirica suffers heart attack
WASHINGTON — U.S. District Court Judge John
J. Sirica, who gained national recognition for his
dogged pursuit of the truth in Watergate, suffered a
heart attack yesterday. His condition is critical.
Sirica, a month away from his 72nd birthday,
collapsed while delivering a luncheon speech
about a lawyer's obligation to professional ethics.
His audience was 270 alumni of George
Washington University Law School, including
many fellow judges.
"His face was flushed and he just keeled over
straight into the rostrum," said Judge Bruce
Mencher of the District of Columbia Superior
Cou rt.
A military doctor was summoned from another
part of the building, the Army-Navy Club, and he
administered mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. At
one point, the judge said, the doctor could find no
pulse.
Sirica had been speaking for 10 minutes.
IRS investigation continues
WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary William
Simon disclosed yesterday that top Internal Re
venue Service officials, including Commissioner
Donald Alexander, will appear next week before a
federal grand jury investigating the IRS.
Simon's written statement said only that the
probe would focus on "allegations made against
the commissioner and the service." But sources
close to the investigation said the grand jury appa
rently is investigating the suspension of an IRS
probe into the use of Bahamian banks as tax dodges.
The grand jury investigation, described by

Simon as routine, represented an intensification of
Justice Department interest in the suspension.
Simon said in September that the Justice Depart
ment had reviewed Alexander's role in the incident
and decided no action was merited.
Ford loosens rail controls
WASHINGTON — President Ford signed a $6.4
billion measure yesterday that will give railroads
more power to raise and lower freight rates and will
pay for the creation of a new Northeastern rail sys
tem.
Ford said the bill, passed by Congress last week,
"will help restore the health and vitality of our
nation's private railroad system . . .
"This legislation encourages revitalization of our
deteriorating rail freight system both in the north
east and nationwide," the President said. "It will
provide substantial improvements in rail passenger
service in the densely populated northeastern Un
ited States."
Nuclear danger 'nonexistent'?
CORNISH FLAT, N.H. — Ronald Reagan stood
on a feed sack outside a countrystore yesterday and
said that environmental opposition to nuclear
power plants is based on "fairy tales" about dan
gers that are virtually nonexistent.
Reagan said he knew his stance on nuclear plants
might be controversial, but he told about 60 people
that the nation must have that energy source to
meet its needs in the years ahead.
He complained about federal regulations that he
said are delaying nuclear power development.
"Government regulations on nuclear power re
quire 11 years to build a nuclear power plant," he
said. "It only takes four years in Japan or Europe."
Today's weather
Mostly cloudy today through Saturday with
chance of showers. Slow warming trend beginning
today. Highs today in the mid 40s to low 50s and
