Vehicle registration
Vehicle owners who have not yet
paid for renewal stickers should do so
today in order to avoid penalty as
sessments for late registration, accord-
ing to the Department of Motor Vehi
cles.
The future expiration dates on the
renewal notices apply only after the

card has been validated by the pur
chase of a nenewal sticker.
CORRECTION
Wednedesday's Daily should have
reported that the late Paul Robeson
was a musician, not a poet.
