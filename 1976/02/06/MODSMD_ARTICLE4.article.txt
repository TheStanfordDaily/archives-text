## 
### Jeff Tanji 
Zeta Psi fraternity member Jim
Erickson received one of the biggest
surprises of his life on the morning of
January 25.
The previous evening the Zetes
celebrated theirannual initiation party
which broke up in the early morning
hours.
At about 5 a.m. with the rest of the
house asleep, an exhausted Erickson
said he stumbled into the bathroom
across the hall from his room where he
encountered an intruder.
"There was a stranger standing in
front of me as I opened up the bath
room door," he said, "with his pants
pulled down all of the way and no shirt
or anything. He just stood there expos
ing himself in front of the mirror. As I
walked in he pulled up his pants and I
asked him what he was doing. He said
that he was looking for a beer. 1 asked
him what he was really doing hereand

he pushed me aside and ran into the
kitchen," he explained.
"We fought for five or 10 minutes
and as I yelled, two other Zetes, Tom
Purcell and Neil Erickson came down
and helped bring the guy down."
"The strange thing about him," said
Purcell, "was that the guy fought har
der and harder as we got more guys to
hold him down. It was like he got off
on violence or something."
After taking the intruder into the liv
ing room, the Zetes called the police,
but decided not to press charges since
no damage was done.
The next morning, after looking
through Palo Alto police files, the
Zetes discovered that the intruder,
whose name was not disclosed, had
been charged and convicted previ
ously on over 20 charges of indecent
exposure and child molesting.
