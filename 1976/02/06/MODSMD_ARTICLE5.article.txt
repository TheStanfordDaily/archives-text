## 
### 
University heating was switched
from natural gas to fuel oil at 10 a.m.
yesterday, according to Robert
Mcknight, manager of utilities at
plant services.
The switch, a routine one when
Pacific Gas and Electric Company
(PC&F) cuts the natural gas supply
to the campus, doubles operating
costs for heating to around $10,000
a day.
PG&E does not tell the University
how long such cut-offs will last.
However. McKnight predicted that

the University will bo on fuel oil at
least through today.
McKnight also noted that fan sys
tems in the Law School, Business
School and Durand Building were
shut off for about lViz hours yester
day in order to reduce the electrical
demand during a period of "peak
needs."
He commented that during
periods when there is a greater than
usual demand for electricity "we
have to level it out quickly" to keep
electrical costs down.
