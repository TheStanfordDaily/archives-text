# Hearst trial
## Bank manager describes theft 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The first
witness in the Patricia I learst trial took
the stand yesterday to describe the
fast-paced bank robbery in which the
young heiress is accused of taking
part.
James Smith, manager of the Hiber
nia Bank's Sunset branch since it
opened more than 20 years ago, was
the prosecution's first witness. He
began his testimony by describing the
bank and recounting the first signsthat
a robbery was in progress.
The bank manager told how he
watched from a one-way window in a
room above the main floor as a band of
robbers invaded the bank, brandishing
what he said looked like machine
guns.
"1 heard a female voice shouting . . .
my first thought was that some woman
must have been really beating up her
child," he said. "When I looked out the
window, I realized the bank was being
held up."
Smith frequently walked to a large
diagram mounted on an easel, using a
pointer to instruct the jury about the
layout of the office and locations of the
bandits. He said he activated the bank
cameras that filmed Hearst with a gun
in her hands.
Skull x-ray
The jailed newspaper heiress ar
rived at the courtroom after receiving a
skull x-ray sought by the defense to
determine whether she suffered a skull
fracture when kidnaped two years and
one day ago. For the first time since her
capture Sept. 18, she appeared in court
wearing a dress — a knee-length floral

pattern with a turtleneck blouse.
In related developments in Los
Angeles, William and Emily Harris
asked to be tried with Patricia Hearst
and issued a statement yesterday de
nying the newspaper heiress was
brainwashed or coerced into joining
the Symbionese Liberation Army.
Superior Court Judge Mark Brandler
telephoned U.S. District Court Judge
Oliver Carter in San Francisco to ask
how long Hearst would be tied up
there with her trial on federal bank
robbery charges.
Available for trial
Brandler said Carter told him Hearst
might be available for trial with the
Harrises by mid-March on charges of
kidnap, robbery and assault in events
surrounding the holdup of an In
glewood sporting goods store in May
1974.
The Harrises now are scheduled for
trial Feb. 17.
"If Patricia Hearst will be available
by the middle of March," Brandler
said. "1 might continue the case to
mid-March."
The Harrises said in a statement "we
don't want our trial here to begin be
fore the end of Patricia Hearst's trial in
San Francisco. We want to wait until
she can be tried with us here."
The Harrises said Hearst was deny
ing her willing involvement with the
SLA and cooperating with defense at
torneys because, "She has been con
vinced to save her own skin by negat
ing these past choices and thereby
skirting the consequences."
