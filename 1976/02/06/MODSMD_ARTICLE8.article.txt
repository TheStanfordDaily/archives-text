## ASSU funds 
### 
ASSU Sen. Kevin McDermott, chairman of the Se
nate Finance Committee, is sponsoring a proposal
which would have a professional investment firm in
vest ASSU funds under the direction ot a new ASSU
Investment Committee.
This Investment Committee would be composed of
the ASSU financial manager, the chairman of the fi
nance committee, a business school professor, the stu
dent member of the Trustee Committee on Investments
and a student-at-large chosen by the ASSU Nomina
tions Committee.
The Dean of Student Affairs is cutting next year's
ASSU budget by approximately $42,000. Since in
vestment profits produce the majority ot ASSU operat
ing funds, ASSU Financial Manager Chris Cline is
supporting McDermott's proposal because next year's
investment profits are expected to cover the projected
deficit.
Cline is also concerned future financial managers
may be inexperienced in making investments.
Between Sept. 1, 1974, and March 31, 1975, the
ASSU earned $18,795 in interest income from its in
vestments. According to Cline, ASSU investments
have made about $21,000 since June, 1975. About
$370,000 of ASSU funds are currently invested in
bonds.
We note that McDermott's proposal is curiously
similar to the full-time financial manager proposal
presented to students at the polls last April. That prop
osal was overwhelmingly defeated. We opposed that
measure, as did many students, because we do not
want any form of professional student government.
We reaffirm that opposition, and we reject having
a professional investment firm handle ASSU invest
ments.
Even though the professional firm would be under a
committee's guidance, the firm is only one step re
moved from being completely responsible tor invest
ments. Such a proposal would also set a bad precedent
for outside professionals to begin assisting in other
ASSU projects, such as special events.
We also oppose having faculty or anyone else
supervise the financial manager. Every administrator,
including the financial manager, is given a position
because he is believed capable of operating without
supervision.
If the ASSU Senate believes a future financial man
ager candidate wold be incapable or inexperienced in
making investment decisions, then it should not con
firm that candidate as financial manager. And the di
rector of University finance has been giving any neces
sary guidance to ASSU financial managers in making
investments.
Finally, we recognize the profit motive is part of the
American way of life, but profit making should not be
the primary aim of the ASSU. We encourage the ASSU
to consider as many cutbacks as are necessary — just as
the rest of the University has been doing — to balance
its budget.
Even though such cutbacks are painful, a review of
the budget should consider ASSU personnel and sal
ary reductions, making full-time positions part-time
and charging for some services. And perhaps some
investments should be sold to pay for the expected
deficit and to benefit students in other ways — such as
bringing back 50-cent Sunday Flicks.
