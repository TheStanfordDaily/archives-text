The question of whether Stanford should retain the
quarter system or establish a semester system is an old
but still controversial issue.
This issue was most recently revived last month
when the Committee on the Reform and Renewal of
Liberal Education at Stanford (CORRLES) voted 7-0,
with two abstentions, to recommend the establishment
of a semester system.
Soon afterwards, University officials announced
that neither the Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement (C-AAA) nor any other University
committee would discuss the recommendation.
Whatever the merits or defects of the semester sys
tem, we believe the C-AAA or any other appropriate
committee should at least study CORRLES' recom
mendation.
CORRLES was established to make recommenda
tions for improving undergraduate education here,
and its report can have an impact — but only if ad
ministrators seriously study its proposals. Otherwise,
CORRLES is a farce."
There is obviously support here for the establish
ment of a semester system. Proponents of such a
change should be allowed to present their views to the
appropriate University committee for serious consid
eration.
