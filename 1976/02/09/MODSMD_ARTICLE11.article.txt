# Evangelism's 'call' lures converts
## 
### 
Josh is here. Some people, intelligent
people, are going to listen and believe. The
rest of us, if we think of him at all, will
probably only scoff and become irritated
that an event such as Josh McDowell's lec
ture series is so heavily promoted.
Perhaps both groups ought to think more
about the causes and implications of the
renewed rise in an essentially Evangelical
Christian movement in the United States.
The surface cause of the renewed revival
movement in Christianity, as well as in
creased interest in Zen, transcendental
meditation, Rev. Moon and assorted
Karma-made-easy movements, is that
people are grasping for straws in a cynical,
purposeless society.
In his book Modern Revivalism William
McLoughlin notes that the essence of
Evangelism is that "Since all sin was per
sonal, all reform must
be personal. Regeneration, not legislation,
changed the human heart, and until that
changed all else was useless."
At a time like this, when legislative solu
tions are disparaged, it is obvious that such
a call to aimless people would be quite well
received.
But the revivalism revival in the U.S. is
more than just a response to the cynical '70s.
It has always been an important facet of
American life, and perhaps always will be.
It is possible to postulate that the reason
for this is that Evangelism fulfills a
psychological need in individuals which is
not normally satisfied by the nation's
materialistic, utilitarian ideology.
Lewis Mumford, in The Condition of
Man, wrote "What, then, was man's true
life? The utilitarian had a ready answer: it

consisted in having more wants than could
be satisfied by the machine, and inventing
more ways in which these wants could be
varied and expanded . . .
"The mechanical expansion of human
appetites, the appetite for goods, the appe
tite for power, the appetite for sensation has
no relation whatever to the ordering of the

means of existence for the satisfaction of
human needs."
This seems to me to be the root of the
problem: our American ideologies, whether
capitalistic or socialistic, cannot fulfill
people's needs because they speak only to
questions like "Who should own the
wealth?" and not "How shall we conduct
our lives to make them meaningful?"
Into the vacuum steps Evangelism. If you
give your life to Jesus, it beckons, all will be
well forever, whether you have money or
not. whether you can make it or not. . . .
A Marxist view of this would say that
religion only covers up the essential misery
imposed by capitalism. But it may not be

that simple.
When Herbert Marcuse was here recently,
he said that defection of many potential re
volutionaries into escapist solutions such as
transcendental meditation was one of the
major causes for the decline of the '60s
movement.
Reasons for 'escape'
It would be most interesting to analyze
why so many people "escaped." A study
might show that the political solutions
proposd by the radicals no more met
people's needs for a purpose to life than did
mainstream U.S. ideology.
The Christian ideology, as well as others
that teach there is more to life than dope,
booze, sex, rock, power and money, is an
appealing one, even to people like me who
don't believe in God or the Devil. It teaches
that there is a good other than goods.
That is not to say there are no dangers in
other-wordly solutions. There are many.
The intolerance of Christian religious
groups, which continues to this day in
statements by Billy Graham about
"demon-caused communism," may even
tually lead to a Christian demagogue taking
over the U.S. in the name of righteousness.
Those who will follow Josh should care
fully watch to see that his message is not
turned into an excuse for hatred of those
who do not believe.
Those who will not follow Josh should
start thinking more about whether we too
are adopting blind faiths which will lead to
nothing.
