# Rev. Moon deceives followers

Over the past weeks, a group
calling itself the "Creative
Community Project" from Men
docino or Berkeley has been cir
culating around White Plaza.
Easily identified by their yellow
and white "elephant bus" and
their facile, deceiving friendli
ness, these people are really
"Moonies," slaves to the designs
of Rev, Sun Yung Moon, the
Korean anti-communist
evangelist. t
Recently, Moon has received a
great deal of well-deserved bad
publicity in the press, much of it
spurred by parents whose chil
dren have fallen victim to his de
ception. And the I R S has an
nounced an investigation of
Moon's Unification Church, '
questioning its tax-exempt
status.
Moon's followers, of the type
you will meet on campus, will
never mention Moon and his
"mission" initially.
With their "blissed-out"
smiles they will invite you to
dinner at their "community."
Once there, promises of happi
ness and fulfillment are in
terspersed with group pressure
to spend a weekend with them.
Many unsuspecting students
have been lured by the promise
of a free weekend in Mendocino.
The weekend is actually a struc
tured indoctrination utilizing
sleep deprivation and
psychological "pressure and
conformity" techniques to make
one vulnerable to group influ
ence. <
Finally, one is asked to give up
everything and follow Moon.
Moon has come to America to
exploit young people, creating
bands of brainwashed idealists
who will beg money or sell pro
ducts for him. He is a multi
millionaire already.
1 have personally encountered
the "Moonies" and similar
groups. They are not to be taken
lightly. Their group persuasion
techniques are powerful.
I would advise against attend
ing one of their meetings as a
lark. At best, one may escape
with a splitting headache and a
sick stomach from their friendly
gathering.
Moon should lose his tax
exempt status and be deported. I
would urge all Stanford students
to greet the Moonies who come
to our community by kindly tel
ling them to leave it.
