Gay issue
Editor:
In regard to the Feb. 5 Thurs
day article entitled "Being gay:
healthy or not?" I would like to
make two comments. The first is
in regard to Dr. Irving Bieber,
"who claims to have discovered
a cure for homosexuality."
This suggests he must know
the "cause," which to date has
successfully eluded the entire
scientific community.
The second comment relates
to me being quoted as contend
ing that "if all persons
functioned within their 'approp
riate' orientation, each sexual
group (homosexual, heterosex
ual, or bisexual) would comprise
approximately one-third of the
population." Accordingly, one
third of the population would be
homosexual, which isn't true.
A consensus exists that about
10 percent of the population is
predominantly or exclusively
homosexual. Within the con
fines of a homophobic society, it
is probably impossible to obtain
an accurate percentage: it could
be more, it could be less.
During the interview, when
percentages were considered. I
wished to make the point that
regardless of what a person's
eventual sexual orientation may
become, a single homosexual
experience (or even several)
does not make a homosexual any
more than this would be true for
those who become heterosexu
als.
The Daily staff did a good
piece of work on this aspect of

human sexuality.

Editor:
As if waking up to snow
wasn't bad enough, the Feb. 5
Thursday was, to say the least,
an outrage. We are not referring
to the subject matter of this issue,
but rather to the notable absence
of news.
We feel the Daily should be
responsible to the community
which it serves. It would not
have mattered if this issue were
devoted to any other subject. The
fact remains, there was little
news reported.
We find it hard to believe there
was nothing else significant
enough to report. The next time
the Daily staff decides so much
space must be devoted to one to
pic, additional pages should be
added to provide for news
coverage.

CIA recruiting
Editor:
So, you're a young, idealistic
grad student and you've just
learned the CIA wants to recruit
people like you here. What are
you doing to do?
"Demonstrate" you decide.
"Drive the venal murderers from
our campus." This is all well and
good, but examine the effects of
such actions.
By denying agencies such as

the CIA the chance to hire intel
ligent, idealistic personnel, you
force them to hire opportunists,
incompetents and adventurers.
Demonstrating then is fine, if
you wish only to deplore past
actions of the agency. But, if you
want to change the CIA for the
better, it would be more logical
to encourage idealists to work
for the agency, because the more
moral the personnel of the
agency are, the less likely will be
the chanc? of an immoral opera
tion being allowed.

Heritage offended
Editor:
In the light of the recent Pen
sacola, Fla., race riots over the
momentous issue of whether to
change a high school mascot
name from "Rebels" to "Raid
ers" (blacks opposed "Rebels" as
discriminatory) and considering
the recent controversy over Stan
ford's native Americans' being
used and abused, we wish to ex
press our deep concern over the
Daily's increased use of the
name Robber Barons on its
sports pages.
We are appalled.
As offspring of decent, well
meaning, profit-motivated,
money-grubbing families, we
feel compelled to take issue with
the use of a term slanderous to
our cultural heritage. C .r toes
have been Mistered and our feel
ings trampled _j>on by an army
of insensitive, vengeii. . sadistic
scum.

The Robber Baron caricature is
not only a blatant offense to our
culture, but it ridicules our re
ligious beliefs. Our faith, Buk
kism, dictate.-, that we kneel
twice daily facing east (approx
imately in the direction of Fort
Knox) and offer prayer to the
Almighty Bukk.
Unquestionably the represen
tation of an aging miser drooling
over a handful of currency is an
extreme insult to this sacred
tradition.
Finally, we demand im
mediate retraction of Robber Ba
rons in all descriptions of Stan
ford athletics since we feel its
use constitutes selective dis
crimination against the
capitalist elite. Furthermore,
since we are ultimately de
scended from a common source
and so related to all creatures in
the animal kingdom, we could
accept no other team name, as
anything and everything offends
us.

SJC criticism
Editor:
Most of the Feb. 3 Daily edito
rial "Student justice." criticising
the Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC). is misleading, if not dow
nright false.
First, there certainly is a stu
dent majority on the SJC in every
Honor Code violation. Phrasing

this fact as the Daily did ("the
lack of a student majority on the
SJC in all cases, including Honor
Code violations") is slipshod, ir
responsible writing.
Second, contrary to the Daily's
suggestion, student members of
the SJC are not chosen totally at
random. The ASSU Senate
selects them from a group of ap
proximately 30 students picked
at random.
This method avoids unbecom
ing campaigning for judicial of
fice, while guaranteeing careful
selection of student members by
their elected representatives.
Third, the student chairman
did indeed say there were
"loopholes in the official char
ter," but only in reply to a Daily
interviewer's question, "If you
had to criticize one thing about
the SJC, what might it be?"
Moreover, the statement came
at the end of an interview ex
pressing faith and optimism in
the current system, and it refer
red only to the "loopholes" in
herent in every judicial system:
namely the need for judges to
issue minor procedural rules
whenever the legislature (here,
the C-15) fails to anticipate
every possible real life situation
that may occur.
To date, no such "loopholes"
have identified themselves in
any of the numerous cases hand
led by the current judicial sys
tem. The SJC has been function
ing fairly and efficiently, but for
less time than it took the C-15 to
create it.

SJC criticism
Editor:
Most of the Feb. 3 Daily edito
rial "Student justice." criticising
the Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC). is misleading, if not dow
nright false.
First, there certainly is a stu
dent majority on the SJC in every
Honor Code violation. Phrasing

this fact as the Daily did ("the
lack of a student majority on the
SJC in all cases, including Honor
Code violations") is slipshod, ir
responsible writing.
Second, contrary to the Daily's
suggestion, student members of
the SJC are not chosen totally at
random. The ASSU Senate
selects them from a group of ap
proximately 30 students picked
at random.
This method avoids unbecom
ing campaigning for judicial of
fice, while guaranteeing careful
selection of student members by
their elected representatives.
Third, the student chairman
did indeed say there were
"loopholes in the official char
ter," but only in reply to a Daily
interviewer's question, "If you
had to criticize one thing about
the SJC, what might it be?"
Moreover, the statement came
at the end of an interview ex
pressing faith and optimism in
the current system, and it refer
red only to the "loopholes" in
herent in every judicial system:
namely the need for judges to
issue minor procedural rules
whenever the legislature (here,
the C-15) fails to anticipate
every possible real life situation
that may occur.
To date, no such "loopholes"
have identified themselves in
any of the numerous cases hand
led by the current judicial sys
tem. The SJC has been function
ing fairly and efficiently, but for
less time than it took the C-15 to
create it.

Gay issue
Editor:
In regard to the Feb. 5 Thurs
day article entitled "Being gay:
healthy or not?" I would like to
make two comments. The first is
in regard to Dr. Irving Bieber,
"who claims to have discovered
a cure for homosexuality."
This suggests he must know
the "cause," which to date has
successfully eluded the entire
scientific community.
The second comment relates
to me being quoted as contend
ing that "if all persons
functioned within their 'approp
riate' orientation, each sexual
group (homosexual, heterosex
ual, or bisexual) would comprise
approximately one-third of the
population." Accordingly, one
third of the population would be
homosexual, which isn't true.
A consensus exists that about
10 percent of the population is
predominantly or exclusively
homosexual. Within the con
fines of a homophobic society, it
is probably impossible to obtain
an accurate percentage: it could
be more, it could be less.
During the interview, when
percentages were considered. I
wished to make the point that
regardless of what a person's
eventual sexual orientation may
become, a single homosexual
experience (or even several)
does not make a homosexual any
more than this would be true for
those who become heterosexu
als.
The Daily staff did a good
piece of work on this aspect of

human sexuality.

We feel the Daily should be

CIA recruiting
Editor:
So, you're a young, idealistic
grad student and you've just
learned the CIA wants to recruit
people like you here. What are
you doing to do?
"Demonstrate" you decide.
"Drive the venal murderers from
our campus." This is all well and
good, but examine the effects of
such actions.
By denying agencies such as

the CIA the chance to hire intel
ligent, idealistic personnel, you
force them to hire opportunists,
incompetents and adventurers.
Demonstrating then is fine, if
you wish only to deplore past
actions of the agency. But, if you
want to change the CIA for the
better, it would be more logical
to encourage idealists to work
for the agency, because the more
moral the personnel of the
agency are, the less likely will be
the chanc? of an immoral opera

momentous issue of whether to
change a high school mascot
name from "Rebels" to "Raid

the recent controversy over Stan
ford's native Americans' being
used and abused, we wish to ex
press our deep concern over the
Daily's increased use of the
name Robber Barons on its
sports pages.
We are appalled.
As offspring of decent, well

money-grubbing families, we
feel compelled to take issue with
the use of a term slanderous to
our cultural heritage. C .r toes
have been Mistered and our feel
ings trampled _j>on by an army
of insensitive, vengeii. . sadistic
scum.

The Robber Baron caricature is
not only a blatant offense to our
culture, but it ridicules our re
ligious beliefs. Our faith, Buk
kism, dictate.-, that we kneel
twice daily facing east (approx
imately in the direction of Fort
Knox) and offer prayer to the
Almighty Bukk.
Unquestionably the represen
tation of an aging miser drooling
over a handful of currency is an
extreme insult to this sacred
tradition.
Finally, we demand im
mediate retraction of Robber Ba

In the light of the recent Pen
sacola, Fla., race riots over the
momentous issue of whether to
change a high school mascot
name from "Rebels" to "Raid
ers" (blacks opposed "Rebels" as
discriminatory) and considering
the recent controversy over Stan
ford's native Americans' being
used and abused, we wish to ex
press our deep concern over the
Daily's increased use of the
name Robber Barons on its
sports pages.
We are appalled.
As offspring of decent, well
meaning, profit-motivated,
money-grubbing families, we
feel compelled to take issue with
the use of a term slanderous to
our cultural heritage. C .r toes
have been Mistered and our feel
ings trampled _j>on by an army
of insensitive, vengeii. . sadistic
scum.

The Robber Baron caricature is
not only a blatant offense to our
culture, but it ridicules our re
ligious beliefs. Our faith, Buk
kism, dictate.-, that we kneel
twice daily facing east (approx
imately in the direction of Fort
Knox) and offer prayer to the
Almighty Bukk.
Unquestionably the represen
tation of an aging miser drooling
over a handful of currency is an
extreme insult to this sacred
tradition.
Finally, we demand im
mediate retraction of Robber Ba
rons in all descriptions of Stan
ford athletics since we feel its
use constitutes selective dis
crimination against the
capitalist elite. Furthermore,
since we are ultimately de
scended from a common source
and so related to all creatures in
the animal kingdom, we could
accept no other team name, as
anything and everything offends

SJC criticism
Editor:
Most of the Feb. 3 Daily edito
rial "Student justice." criticising
the Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC). is misleading, if not dow
nright false.
First, there certainly is a stu
dent majority on the SJC in every
Honor Code violation. Phrasing

this fact as the Daily did ("the
lack of a student majority on the
SJC in all cases, including Honor
Code violations") is slipshod, ir
responsible writing.
Second, contrary to the Daily's
suggestion, student members of
the SJC are not chosen totally at
random. The ASSU Senate
selects them from a group of ap
proximately 30 students picked
at random.
This method avoids unbecom
ing campaigning for judicial of
fice, while guaranteeing careful
selection of student members by
their elected representatives.
Third, the student chairman
did indeed say there were
"loopholes in the official char
ter," but only in reply to a Daily
interviewer's question, "If you
had to criticize one thing about
the SJC, what might it be?"
Moreover, the statement came
at the end of an interview ex
pressing faith and optimism in
the current system, and it refer
red only to the "loopholes" in
herent in every judicial system:
namely the need for judges to
issue minor procedural rules
whenever the legislature (here,
the C-15) fails to anticipate
every possible real life situation
that may occur.
To date, no such "loopholes"
have identified themselves in
any of the numerous cases hand
led by the current judicial sys
tem. The SJC has been function
ing fairly and efficiently, but for
less time than it took the C-15 to
create it.

Gay issue
Editor:
In regard to the Feb. 5 Thurs
day article entitled "Being gay:
healthy or not?" I would like to
make two comments. The first is
in regard to Dr. Irving Bieber,
"who claims to have discovered
a cure for homosexuality."
This suggests he must know
the "cause," which to date has
successfully eluded the entire
scientific community.
The second comment relates
to me being quoted as contend
ing that "if all persons
functioned within their 'approp
riate' orientation, each sexual
group (homosexual, heterosex
ual, or bisexual) would comprise
approximately one-third of the
population." Accordingly, one
third of the population would be
homosexual, which isn't true.
A consensus exists that about
10 percent of the population is
predominantly or exclusively
homosexual. Within the con
fines of a homophobic society, it
is probably impossible to obtain
an accurate percentage: it could
be more, it could be less.
During the interview, when
percentages were considered. I
wished to make the point that
regardless of what a person's
eventual sexual orientation may
become, a single homosexual
experience (or even several)
does not make a homosexual any
more than this would be true for
those who become heterosexu
als.
The Daily staff did a good
piece of work on this aspect of

human sexuality.
