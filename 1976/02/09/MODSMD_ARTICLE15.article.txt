# This pre-med makes magic

\ Medicine is his future and
2 magic is the present, but junior
2 Mark Kosekind doesn't plan on
l letting either of these occupa
-3 tions completely dominate his
5 life.
I "I'm not going to let only one
: thing he my life. I want to be a
? doctor, but I'm not going to be
1 confined. I want to be well
3| rounded.
] "Magic is the big thing right
I now," he adds, but he doesn't
let it interfere with his studies,
j Rosekind is a professional
] magician, a member of the San
j Francisco chapter of the Inter
i national Brotherhood of Magi
-3 cians.and normally does three
3 )r four shows a month during
5 school.
j He is also a pre-med major
-3 ing in psychology here. And he
] sees a definite relationship be
• tween his scientific interests
• and his interest in magic.
Audience reaction
: He ties magic into psychol
; ogy by explaining, "When I do
j a show, I like to watch the au
-5 dience for their reactions. Little
kids for instance, might be si
lent. Other people have reacted
differently. It's interesting to
compare them."
One might think that, as a
doctor, Rosekind would have
to give up magic. However, he
thinks it will bea useful tool in
his work. "For instance," he
says, "a doctor who knows
some magic can put a little kid,
who has not been to the doctor
before, at ease by showing him
.i few tricks."
Rosekind's original interest
in magic also stemmed from
his interest in science. "I have
an analytical mind. When I was
younger, 1 would see a magi
cian doing tricks and think
'Hey, that's not possible.' "
Rosekind's aunt gave him his
first magic set when he was in
the fifth grade. "When I first
looked at it I couldn't under
stand any of it, so I threw it

away.
However, his mother sal
vaged the set out of the trash
and explained a few of the
tricks to him. After that
Rosekind was sold on magic.
"That's when I gave my first
public show, to my fifth grade
class."
Making money
Rosekind started getting
paid for shows in about the
eighth grade, but didn't start
making good money until sev
eral years later.
The amount of money he
makes varies, depending on
how miiny shows he does. He
makes quite a bit more in sum

mer when he has fewer com
mitments. Though he doesn't
consider himself to be working
his way through college, he
says that he does earn a sub
stantial part of his tuition.
Rosekind has performed at
everything from PTA meetings
to convalescent hospital shows
to dinner banquets.
He also enjoys the opportun
ity that his magic business pro
vides him to travel around and
meet people. Up to now
Rosekind has performed
mostly on the Peninsula; he has
lived here all his life. However,
he has done shows in other
places including a show in an
Eastern hospital.

One place he hasn't yet 112
worked in is a night club — 112
until recently, he was undei |
age.
Important show
In spring, Rosekind has ar
important show at the San i
Francisco Press Club. "1 hope
that lean get some good public- i
ity from this show so that 1 can
work other places." In particu
lar, he would like to work in
"lounge shows" in Tahoe.
When asked about what it
takes to be a magician,
Rosekind responds that the
ability of a magician depends
heavily on the amount of time
the magician spends practic
ing.
The magician's popularity
depends on his ability to de
velop an appropriate style for
himself, he continues. Some
magicians depend on sleight ol
hand for their acts, while
others use a great deal of elabo
rate illusions, he says.
"My style is interaction,"
says Rosekind. "1 like to work
with the audience."
Entertaining
"That's what I like about
magic. 1 enjoy entertaining
people, 1 love to be entertain
ing, just to sit at a party with a
deck of cards in my hands and
entertain."
The practice of magic and
the study of medicine are not
the only things that Rosekind is
involved in. On the side, he
also does wedding and portrait
photography. He's a T.A. for
"Sleep and Dreams," and he
also coaches junior high school
basketball.
With all these activities, one
might expect some conflicts.
Actually, Rosekind says
magic is the only thing that
ever presents any sort of inter
ference, because his shows are
planned for weeks in advance.
"1 may be trying to concentrate
on school work, but an idea for
the show keeps running
through mv head "

• and his interest in magic.
Audience reaction
: He ties magic into psychol
; ogy by explaining, "When I do
j a show, I like to watch the au
-5 dience for their reactions. Little
kids for instance, might be si
lent. Other people have reacted
differently. It's interesting to
compare them."
One might think that, as a
doctor, Rosekind would have
to give up magic. However, he
thinks it will bea useful tool in
his work. "For instance," he
says, "a doctor who knows
some magic can put a little kid,
who has not been to the doctor
before, at ease by showing him
.i few tricks."
Rosekind's original interest
in magic also stemmed from
his interest in science. "I have
an analytical mind. When I was
younger, 1 would see a magi
cian doing tricks and think
'Hey, that's not possible.' "
Rosekind's aunt gave him his
first magic set when he was in
the fifth grade. "When I first
looked at it I couldn't under
stand any of it, so I threw it

away.
However, his mother sal
vaged the set out of the trash
and explained a few of the
tricks to him. After that
Rosekind was sold on magic.
"That's when I gave my first
public show, to my fifth grade
class."
Making money
Rosekind started getting
paid for shows in about the
eighth grade, but didn't start
making good money until sev
eral years later.
The amount of money he
makes varies, depending on
how miiny shows he does. He
makes quite a bit more in sum

mer when he has fewer com
mitments. Though he doesn't
consider himself to be working
his way through college, he
says that he does earn a sub
stantial part of his tuition.
Rosekind has performed at
everything from PTA meetings
to convalescent hospital shows
to dinner banquets.
He also enjoys the opportun
ity that his magic business pro
vides him to travel around and
meet people. Up to now
Rosekind has performed
mostly on the Peninsula; he has
lived here all his life. However,
he has done shows in other
places including a show in an
Eastern hospital.

One place he hasn't yet 112
worked in is a night club — 112
until recently, he was undei |
age.
Important show
In spring, Rosekind has ar
important show at the San i
Francisco Press Club. "1 hope
that lean get some good public- i
ity from this show so that 1 can
work other places." In particu
lar, he would like to work in
"lounge shows" in Tahoe.
When asked about what it
takes to be a magician,
Rosekind responds that the
ability of a magician depends
heavily on the amount of time
the magician spends practic
ing.
The magician's popularity
depends on his ability to de
velop an appropriate style for
himself, he continues. Some
magicians depend on sleight ol
hand for their acts, while
others use a great deal of elabo
rate illusions, he says.
"My style is interaction,"
says Rosekind. "1 like to work
with the audience."
Entertaining
"That's what I like about
magic. 1 enjoy entertaining
people, 1 love to be entertain
ing, just to sit at a party with a
deck of cards in my hands and
entertain."
The practice of magic and
the study of medicine are not
the only things that Rosekind is
involved in. On the side, he
also does wedding and portrait
photography. He's a T.A. for
"Sleep and Dreams," and he
also coaches junior high school
basketball.
With all these activities, one
might expect some conflicts.
Actually, Rosekind says
magic is the only thing that
ever presents any sort of inter
ference, because his shows are
planned for weeks in advance.
"1 may be trying to concentrate
on school work, but an idea for
the show keeps running

Rosekind's aunt gave him his
first magic set when he was in
the fifth grade. "When I first
looked at it I couldn't under
stand any of it, so I threw it

away.
However, his mother sal
vaged the set out of the trash
and explained a few of the
tricks to him. After that
Rosekind was sold on magic.
"That's when I gave my first
public show, to my fifth grade
class."
Making money
Rosekind started getting
paid for shows in about the
eighth grade, but didn't start
making good money until sev
eral years later.
The amount of money he
makes varies, depending on
how miiny shows he does. He
makes quite a bit more in sum

mer when he has fewer com
mitments. Though he doesn't
consider himself to be working
his way through college, he
says that he does earn a sub
stantial part of his tuition.
Rosekind has performed at
everything from PTA meetings
to convalescent hospital shows
to dinner banquets.
He also enjoys the opportun
ity that his magic business pro
vides him to travel around and
meet people. Up to now
Rosekind has performed
mostly on the Peninsula; he has
lived here all his life. However,
he has done shows in other
places including a show in an
Eastern hospital.

One place he hasn't yet 112
worked in is a night club — 112
until recently, he was undei |
age.
Important show
In spring, Rosekind has ar
important show at the San i
Francisco Press Club. "1 hope
that lean get some good public- i
ity from this show so that 1 can
work other places." In particu
lar, he would like to work in
"lounge shows" in Tahoe.
When asked about what it
takes to be a magician,
Rosekind responds that the
ability of a magician depends
heavily on the amount of time
the magician spends practic
ing.
The magician's popularity
depends on his ability to de
velop an appropriate style for
himself, he continues. Some
magicians depend on sleight ol
hand for their acts, while
others use a great deal of elabo
rate illusions, he says.
"My style is interaction,"
says Rosekind. "1 like to work
with the audience."
Entertaining
"That's what I like about
magic. 1 enjoy entertaining
people, 1 love to be entertain
ing, just to sit at a party with a
deck of cards in my hands and
entertain."
The practice of magic and
the study of medicine are not
the only things that Rosekind is
involved in. On the side, he
also does wedding and portrait
photography. He's a T.A. for
"Sleep and Dreams," and he
also coaches junior high school
basketball.
With all these activities, one
might expect some conflicts.
Actually, Rosekind says
magic is the only thing that
ever presents any sort of inter
ference, because his shows are
planned for weeks in advance.
"1 may be trying to concentrate
on school work, but an idea for
the show keeps running
through mv head "

] "Magic is the big thing right
I now," he adds, but he doesn't
let it interfere with his studies,
j Rosekind is a professional

i national Brotherhood of Magi
-3 cians.and normally does three
3 )r four shows a month during
5 school.
j He is also a pre-med major

• and his interest in magic.
Audience reaction
: He ties magic into psychol
; ogy by explaining, "When I do
j a show, I like to watch the au
-5 dience for their reactions. Little
kids for instance, might be si
lent. Other people have reacted
differently. It's interesting to
compare them."
One might think that, as a
doctor, Rosekind would have
to give up magic. However, he
thinks it will bea useful tool in
his work. "For instance," he
says, "a doctor who knows
some magic can put a little kid,
who has not been to the doctor
before, at ease by showing him
.i few tricks."
Rosekind's original interest
in magic also stemmed from
his interest in science. "I have
an analytical mind. When I was
younger, 1 would see a magi
cian doing tricks and think
'Hey, that's not possible.' "
