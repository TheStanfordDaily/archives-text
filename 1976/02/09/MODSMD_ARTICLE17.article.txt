# Doctors 'going bare' by dropping insurance
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP)—Some
doctors in various parts of the
country have dropped their
malpractice insurance because
of its cost and are continuing to
practice. This method of beating
the high cost of liability cover
age is a gamble which could cost
uninsured doctors all their
wealth and even future earnings.
"It's like walking a high wire
without a net, like skydiving
without a second parachute,"
says Dr. David Smith, a suburban
Los Angeles surgeon who says
he might drop his malpractice
insurance because the premium
is now $21,000 annually.
"Going bare" — practicing
without insurance — is occur
ring in California, Nevada,
Michigan, Tennessee. Texas,
North Carolina and Alaska, ac
cording to spokesmen for the
medical associations in those
states. But they say it's hard to
calculate the exact numbers of
doctors involved.
Peter Sweetland, a spokesman
for Travelers Insurance Co., a
major underwriter of medical
malpractice insurance, said that
some doctors are dropping in
surance, but not many.
David Willett, legal counsel to
the California Medical Associa
tion, says his office has been get
ting more inquiries about the
pros and cons of dropping
coverage. The office also pro
vides doctors with a booklet cal
led "Insolvency Planning." It
tells them how to put theirassets
beyond the reach of creditors by
creating trusts and other ar
rangements.
Dr. David Rubsamen, pub
lisher of the Professional Liabil
ity Newsletter for doctors, esti
mates that 1000 doctors in
California are going bare. In
Southern California, where doc
tors have just ended a 35-day
work slowdown to protest shar
ply rising malpractice pre

miums, 2000 physicians did not
renew their policies by a Jan. 2H
deadline, the insurance com
panies said. Many are expected
ultimately to give in and pay the
new premiums, but some will
take the risks of practicing with
out coverage, says Sweetland of
Travelers.
The theory of going bare is th.it
a patient who sues an uninsured
doctor can't get as large a settle
ment as an insured doctor would
be able to pay — and a doctor
whoseattorney is skillful at shel
tering assets may be able to es
cape any payment.
"We frankly advise them it's a
very hazardous way to go," saicl
Willett. "Aside from the obvious
risks, we feel that a doctor may
be forced to settle a case because
of his limited resources. If he had
an insurance company behind
him, he might be able to fight the
suit and win."
And there's no legal way, he
said, to shelter assets from a
judgment without losing the as
sets for one's own use.
Many trial attorneys agree that
while asset-sheltering may make
collecting on a judgment more
difficult, it doesn't make it im
possible.
Meanwhile, a California Med
ical Association committee here
is considering proposal of a state
constitutional amendment that
would change the way medical
malpractice lawsuits are de
cided.
The proposal, one of 70 on
malpractice being considered at
an annual CMA meeting here
this week, would start a
statewide initiative drive to
place a measure on the Nov. 2
ballot ending court trial deci
sions of malpractice lawsuits
and setting limits on non
economic: damage awards.
The CMA Council, the group's
executive body, sent the prop
osal to a CMA House of Dele

gates committee Saturday, and
the measure will be decided by
all 300 delegates Tuesday or
Wednesday. <i (IMA spokesman
said.
In abolishing malpractice
lawsuit settlements by trial, the
measure would call on the State
Legislature to create a system of
arbitration for such suits before
"a qualified expert or panel of
qualified experts." the CMA
spokesman said.
Any arbitration ruling would
be subject to review by state ap
pellate courts on "questions of
law" only.
The measure would also place
limits on contingency fees col
lected by plaintiffs' attorneys in
malpractice lawsuits. Attorneys
would collect 40 percent of a
$10,000 award, 25 percent of the
next $10,000, 15 percent of the
next $30,000 and only 10 per
cent of awards over $50,000, the
spokesman said.
There are presently no such
restrictions on lawyers.
Also, the measure would set a
$100,000 limit on damages
awarded for personal discom
fort, disfigurement and other
"non-economic" considera
tions, the spokesman said.
Some 499,500 petition signa
tures would be needed by mid-
June to place the vet
unapproved proposal on the
state ballot.
The CMA represents nearly
26,000 of California's 40,000
licensed physicians and is the
second-largest state doctor's
group in the nation.
The 70 proposals dealing with
the medical malpractice insur
ance crisis are among some 200
proposals being considered at
the CMA meeting, which ends
Wednesday.
