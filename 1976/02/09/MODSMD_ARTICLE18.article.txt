College students' moods have changed drasti
cally since the late 1960s as most poignantly evi
denced at UC-Berkeley.
Slightly more than half the students indicated
they did not object to the building of an in
tramural facility on the grassy area of People's
Park, which in 1969 was the scene of bloody riots.
In the survey taken last month, 61 percent fa
vored building part of the facility on the parking
lot area of the Park, according to the Daily
Californian.
However, the Registration Fee Committee
which sponsored the survey recommended that
the facility not be built on any part of People's
Park because of the significant opposition.
One person was killed and many injurd in 1969
when students rioted in response to the Univer
sity fencing off the land to start construction of a
married student housing complex.
UC Chancellor Albert Bowker will probably re
commend to the Hoard of Regents in March that
the facilities be built on the People's Park lot or a
University parking lot across the street from the
Park.

Tenure and seniority proponents suffered a
blow last month when the California State Uni
versity and College's Board of Trustees voted in
favor of a resolution which gives priority to com
petency and merit in establishing layoff policies
and procedures.
According to the San Jose State's Spartan Daily,
the resolution, introduced by Trustee Jeannette
Ritchie of Menlo Park, pertained to both academic
and non-academic personnel; its implementation
will be delayed until May to allow time for more
faculty and student input.
United Professors of California members pic
keted the trustee meeting, protesting both the
abolition of seniority rights and the failure of
Chancellor Glenn Dumke to meet with faculty
members about the implementation of grievance
procedures.
The Academic Senate at San Jose had previ
ously voted to support the statewide Academic
Senate's opposition to the resolution.

A student-run non-profit grocery story is ex
pected to open on the Morningside Heights cam
pus of Columbia University next month in an ef
fort to help students cut their steadily rising food

bills, the New York Times reported last week.
The store will receive rent-free space in the
basement of a Columbia dormitory and will be
staffed by students from the college and Barnard.
David Brown, the projects director, said he ex
pects to undersell local merchants by 15 percent,
with its stock including all types of prepackaged
food available, geared primarily to dormitory stu
dents. No fresh meat, fruit or vegetables will be
sold.
Most local mechants withheld judgment of the
effect of the store, though one grocery owner
criticized the project, noting that "if Columbia
would lower my rent. 1 could lower my prices."
While most students complain about campus
social life, the Undergraduate Student Govern
ment at Penn State is sponsoring Datematch '76,
which will computer-match students, faculty and
staff at the University.
The only restrictions, besides having to be af
filiated with the university, are being at least 18,
single, and agreeing not to annoy any matches if
they decline to get acquainted.
The sponsors of Datematch '76 placed a two
page advertisement in The Daily Collegian at the
university, which included an application form
asking numerous questions about the applicant
and his or her preferred mate.
The application asked about drinking habits,
about smoking cigarettes and marijuana, religious
or racial restrictions, weight, family income and
type of hometown.
Also included are 48 hobbies and activities
ranging from pinball to opera, photography to
backgammon and student activism to yoga, which
students are to rate in terms of interest.
Applicants are also requested to state their ag
reement or disagreement with 54 sentences de
signed to determine a person's beliefs about sex,
women's liberation, religion and personal as
sessment.
Three to 15 matches are promised to each
applicant (or a refund is granted), as well as free
admission to the Datematch Dance and coupons
for discounts at local restaurants worth more than
$5, all in exchange for a $3.50 fee.
It may not be enough to get any Stanford stu
dent to transfer, but perhaps Council of Presi
dents' slates will have one more service to stu
dents in their platforms this year.
