# Will MDs, lawyers begin advertising?
## 
### Associated Press 
To advertise or not to adver
tise? That is the question facing
lawyers, doctors and other pro
fessionals who are under grow
ing pressure from government
and some consumer groups to
end traditional bans on advertis
ing.
The issue will be a key one at
the American Bar Association
meeting in Philadelphia later
this week when the lawyers con
sider an ethics code change that
would ease the group's flat pro
hibition on advertising.
The ABA's committee on
ethics and professional respon
sibility had been studying a
proposal to allow advertising in
all media, including newspap
ers, radio and television. The
proposal would have retained
the ban on advertising that "im
plies unusual legal ability."
Lawyers also would have been
prohibited from recommending
their own employment or that of
an associate.
Earlier this month, however,
the committee decided not to
push for the broad proposal at
the Philadelphia meeting. It de

cided instead, to recommend
only that lawyers be permitted to
provide a limited amount of ad
ditional information in directory
listings and some other publica
tions.
Lewis H. Van Dusen Jr. of
Philadelphia, the committee
chairman, and the group will
submit a broader report for con
sideration at the ABA meeting in
Atlanta in August.
Supporters of advertising by
professionals say the open com
petition could help lower fees
and give consumers a better idea
of services available. Opponents
say'the cost of the advertising
would just be passed on to the
public, negating any savings.
And they express concern ....out
the quality and type of ads.
"Widespread advertising is
only going to be done by the
inept and incompetent," said
Leroy Jeffers, a Houston, Tex.,
lawyer.
Edwin J. Holman, an attorney
and former secretary of the Judi
cial Council of the AMA, said.
"J'atients simply have no basis to
sort out truth from fiction if the
various claims and coun

terclaims of medical advertising
are to be allowed." He also said
that price is "an inapplicable
standard" for choosing a doctor.
Holman said others argue that
there are law and medical direc
tories that give consumers the
information they need about at
torneys and physicians.
Consumers Union has filed
suit against the ABA and the
Virginia state bar, however, con
tending that restrictions on in
formation about fees and
specialties in law directories
violate First Amendment
guarantees. A three-judge fed
eral court in Richmond is ex
pected to hear the case starting
March 25.
The Supreme Court ruled last
June that Virginia lawyers could
not enforce price-fixing
schedules. The court also said
that "learned professions" are
not necessarily immunefrom an
titrust laws.
The antitrust issue is a key one
that has been cited by the Fed
eral Trade Commission in its ef
forts to permit advertising by
doctors, pharmacists and op
tometrists.

schedules. The court also said
that "learned professions" are
not necessarily immunefrom an
titrust laws.
The antitrust issue is a key one
that has been cited by the Fed
eral Trade Commission in its ef
forts to permit advertising by
doctors, pharmacists and op
tometrists.
To advertise or not to adver
tise? That is the question facing
lawyers, doctors and other pro
fessionals who are under grow
ing pressure from government
and some consumer groups to
end traditional bans on advertis
ing.
The issue will be a key one at
the American Bar Association
meeting in Philadelphia later
this week when the lawyers con
sider an ethics code change that
would ease the group's flat pro
hibition on advertising.
The ABA's committee on
ethics and professional respon
sibility had been studying a
proposal to allow advertising in
all media, including newspap
ers, radio and television. The
proposal would have retained
the ban on advertising that "im
plies unusual legal ability."
Lawyers also would have been
prohibited from recommending
their own employment or that of
an associate.
Earlier this month, however,
the committee decided not to
push for the broad proposal at
the Philadelphia meeting. It de

cided instead, to recommend
only that lawyers be permitted to
provide a limited amount of ad
ditional information in directory
listings and some other publica
tions.
Lewis H. Van Dusen Jr. of
Philadelphia, the committee
chairman, and the group will
submit a broader report for con
sideration at the ABA meeting in
Atlanta in August.
Supporters of advertising by
professionals say the open com
petition could help lower fees
and give consumers a better idea
of services available. Opponents
say'the cost of the advertising
would just be passed on to the
public, negating any savings.
And they express concern ....out
the quality and type of ads.
"Widespread advertising is
only going to be done by the
inept and incompetent," said
Leroy Jeffers, a Houston, Tex.,
lawyer.
Edwin J. Holman, an attorney
and former secretary of the Judi
cial Council of the AMA, said.
"J'atients simply have no basis to
sort out truth from fiction if the
various claims and coun

terclaims of medical advertising
are to be allowed." He also said
that price is "an inapplicable
standard" for choosing a doctor.
Holman said others argue that
there are law and medical direc
tories that give consumers the
information they need about at
torneys and physicians.
Consumers Union has filed
suit against the ABA and the
Virginia state bar, however, con
tending that restrictions on in
formation about fees and
specialties in law directories
violate First Amendment
guarantees. A three-judge fed
eral court in Richmond is ex
pected to hear the case starting
March 25.
The Supreme Court ruled last
June that Virginia lawyers could
not enforce price-fixing
schedules. The court also said
that "learned professions" are
not necessarily immunefrom an
titrust laws.
