## 
### Bruce Kadden 
The ASSU Guest Professorship
Board will apparently recommend to
the student senate tomorrow night that
Marxist philosopher Angela Davis,
Belgian Trotskyist economist Ernest
Mandel and radical clinical
psychologist Claude Steiner be invited
to teach courses here next quarter.
Members of the Board, seniors Gor
don Wheat, Andrea Halliday and
Blythe Mickelson, and junior Bill
Tyndall, refused to confirm a report
that they wou Id ask the senate to invite
David and Mandel.
However, Tyndall said last week
that the philosophy and economics
departments were being considered
for guest professors.
Asst. Philosophy Prof. Michael
Bratman confirmed that Davis was
being considered by his department,
although he indicated that the ar
rangements had not been finalized be
cause the necessary ASSU Senate ap
proval has not yet been given.
Economics Prof. Donald Harris dis
closed that Mandel's name was under
consideration by the economics de
partment.
Third person
Wheat said the third person was an
"alternative clinical psychologist,"
but three professors in the psychology
department, including chairwoman
Eleanor Maccoby, said they had not
been approached by the Board.
Wheat added that he hopes two or
three departments or programs would
sponsor the professors so that their
courses could be accredited by the
University. While the administration
was being informed of the Board's
progress, Wheat said it does not have
to approve the choices.
The Board sent out 36 letters of in
quiry to people suggested by students,
professors and Board members, and
has received responses from about
half, according to Wheat. From those
who indicated they would like to teach

here, the Board "chose people best
qualified" according to established
criteria, he said.
$10,000 available
Nearly $10,000 is available from a
fee assessment passed in spring 1974
which was intended to sponsor South
Vietnamese journalist Nguyen Huu
Thai. He was not allowed to leave Vie
tnam, and subsequent attempts to
bring Chilean political prisoner Her
mann Schwember to the campus also
failed.
Besides department and assessment
money, Wheat said the Board had ap
proached the Committee for Research
on Women (CROW) for funds and
might also get some money from ASSU
Senate and Council of President's dis
cretionary funds.
Davis was hired by the UCLA
philosophy department in summer
1969, as an assistant professor, but

when her Communist party affiliation
was discovered the UC Board of Re
gents, led by then-Governor Ronald
Reagan, voted to fire Davis, before fall
quarter 1969 began.
Taught one year
However, Davis taught at the uni
versity for one year because the
philosophy department chairman
managed to find a course not covered
by the Regents' ruling and eventually
the policy against hiring Com
munists was declared unconstitu
tional. i
Davis was accused and acquitted of
kidnaping, murderand conspiracy in
the August 1970. shootout outside a
Marin County courthouse which left a
judge, and three persons involved in
the attempted breakout, dead.
Mandel, the editor of a Marxist
newspaper in Belgium, was invited
to speak at the University seven

years ago for a conference on
"Technology and the Third World,"
but was denied a visa by the State de
partment on the attorney general's re
commendation because of his com
munist ideology.
Wheat indicated that one of the per
sons would be coming from overseas
and might have a problem attaining a
visa, but would not confirm whether
that person was Mandel.
Steiner is author of Games Al
coholics Play and other articles. In his
"Radical Psychiatry Manifesto,"
Steiner said "Psychiatrists should be
come advocates of the people, should
refuse to participate in the pacification
of the oppressed and should encour
age people's struggles for liberation."
According to Mickelson, the ASSU
Senate has authority over the distribu
tion of the funds as well as final ap
proval of the people who are invited.

to teach courses here next quarter.
Members of the Board, seniors Gor
don Wheat, Andrea Halliday and
Blythe Mickelson, and junior Bill
Tyndall, refused to confirm a report
that they wou Id ask the senate to invite
David and Mandel.
However, Tyndall said last week
that the philosophy and economics
departments were being considered
for guest professors.
Asst. Philosophy Prof. Michael
Bratman confirmed that Davis was
being considered by his department,
although he indicated that the ar
rangements had not been finalized be
cause the necessary ASSU Senate ap
proval has not yet been given.
Economics Prof. Donald Harris dis
closed that Mandel's name was under
consideration by the economics de
partment.
Third person
Wheat said the third person was an
"alternative clinical psychologist,"
but three professors in the psychology
department, including chairwoman
Eleanor Maccoby, said they had not
been approached by the Board.
Wheat added that he hopes two or
three departments or programs would
sponsor the professors so that their
courses could be accredited by the
University. While the administration
was being informed of the Board's
progress, Wheat said it does not have
to approve the choices.
The Board sent out 36 letters of in
quiry to people suggested by students,
professors and Board members, and
has received responses from about
half, according to Wheat. From those
who indicated they would like to teach

here, the Board "chose people best
qualified" according to established
criteria, he said.
$10,000 available
Nearly $10,000 is available from a
fee assessment passed in spring 1974
which was intended to sponsor South
Vietnamese journalist Nguyen Huu
Thai. He was not allowed to leave Vie
tnam, and subsequent attempts to
bring Chilean political prisoner Her
mann Schwember to the campus also
failed.
Besides department and assessment
money, Wheat said the Board had ap
proached the Committee for Research
on Women (CROW) for funds and
might also get some money from ASSU
Senate and Council of President's dis
cretionary funds.
Davis was hired by the UCLA
philosophy department in summer
1969, as an assistant professor, but

when her Communist party affiliation
was discovered the UC Board of Re
gents, led by then-Governor Ronald
Reagan, voted to fire Davis, before fall
quarter 1969 began.
Taught one year
However, Davis taught at the uni
versity for one year because the
philosophy department chairman
managed to find a course not covered
by the Regents' ruling and eventually
the policy against hiring Com
munists was declared unconstitu
tional. i
Davis was accused and acquitted of
kidnaping, murderand conspiracy in
the August 1970. shootout outside a
Marin County courthouse which left a
judge, and three persons involved in
the attempted breakout, dead.
Mandel, the editor of a Marxist
newspaper in Belgium, was invited
to speak at the University seven

years ago for a conference on
"Technology and the Third World,"
but was denied a visa by the State de
partment on the attorney general's re
commendation because of his com
munist ideology.
Wheat indicated that one of the per
sons would be coming from overseas
and might have a problem attaining a
visa, but would not confirm whether
that person was Mandel.
Steiner is author of Games Al
coholics Play and other articles. In his
"Radical Psychiatry Manifesto,"
Steiner said "Psychiatrists should be
come advocates of the people, should
refuse to participate in the pacification
of the oppressed and should encour
age people's struggles for liberation."
According to Mickelson, the ASSU
Senate has authority over the distribu
tion of the funds as well as final ap
proval of the people who are invited.
The ASSU Guest Professorship
Board will apparently recommend to
the student senate tomorrow night that
Marxist philosopher Angela Davis,
Belgian Trotskyist economist Ernest
