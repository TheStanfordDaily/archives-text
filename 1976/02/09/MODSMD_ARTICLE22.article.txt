WASHINGTON (AP) — Commerce Secretary Elliot Richardson
predicted yesterday that President Ford will defeat Ronald Reagan
for the Republican presidential nomination but declined to specu
late on his own future.
Richardson said on CBS' Face the Nation that he expects the
President to win the nomination and he will work to help him do
so.
Asked if he might be a candidate for vice president, Richardson
said he didn't want to speculate about possibilities which have not
come up.
And later he said he did not accept the Commerce position and
return from his post as as ambassador to England in order "to angle
for some other job."
He said he does not plan to run for U.S. Senate from Mas
sachusetts against Sen. Edward Kennedy.
And when asked if he might be named secretary of state should
Henry Kissinger leave office, Richardson commented he would be
happy to remain secretary of commerce through the end of Ford's
term, which he said he expected to be in 1981.
He termed new unemployment figures showing a large Recline
in the number of persons out of work very encouraging, although
he cautioned that major gains should not be expected every month.
The former attorney general was asked if he agreed with state
ments by former Vice President Spiro Agnew that Agnew was
never convicted of anything and should be considered innocent.
"I certainly don't think so , . . the evidence we filed, summary of
it, was all under oath and would certainly have supported charges
broader than the ones that were actually made the subject of the
indictment," Richardson responded.
He was also asked if he had any indications previously that Ford
planned his pardon of former President Richard Nixon. Richardson
said that any information he had "was only as an outside observer
10 or 11 months later."
