## Giovacchini lost for the season Cards drop two in Oregon 
### Paul Bauman 
CORVALUS. Ore. — Head
coaches are notorious tor mak
ing bland statements to the
press, especially about officials.
And with good reason —
coaches have been known to re
ceive fines for public criticism of
referees, and they don't usually
want to be accused of making
excuses. So instead of venting
their true feelings, coaches often
say things like, "Well, the refs
made a few questionable calls,
but they're only human."
Apparently, Stanford's Dick
Dißiaso is more open. Not only
did he speak his mind after the
Cards lost to Oregon, 72-59,
Thursday night in Eugene, and
Oregon State Saturday evening,
82-76, but he couldn't wait to
blast the refs.
'Butch Cassidy'
Standing outside Stanford's
locker room in Oregon State's
Gill Coliseum, Dißiaso
answered a couple of questions
unrelated to the refs, and then
said: "Since you asked about the
officiating.. .ButchCassidy and
the Sundance Kid rode through
the Y\ iiluinette Valley, stopped
at Gill Coliseum, and didn't tar
nish their reputation at all.
"(Oregon State coach) Ralph
Miller and I wanted to try to do
away with them (the officials),
go back to the city game and let
the players call the fouls them
selves."
One of Dißiaso's complaints
involved an incident with just
1:45 gone in the game which re
sulted in a technical on the
Cards' coach. Beaver center
Lonnie Shelton gave Stanford
forward George Schader "a shot
George Foreman would have
been proud of," according to Di-
Biaso, and Schader was called
for a foul when he retaliated. Di-
Biaso jumped off the bench yel
ling irately at the ref, who then
nailed him with a "T."
"One ref in particular was out

to get me," said Shelton, who
played only 12 minutes because
of foul trouble and was not a
major factor in the game. "1 knew
it, he knew it, and the fans could
see iti"
After the Oregon game, a re
porter asked Dißiaso how he saw
the game. "Probably better than
a couple of other people," Stan
ford's rookie coach said.
Through it all, the best teams
won. The Beavers, 5-2 in the
Pacific Eight, played superbly
on offense and well enough on
defense Saturday. Oregon State
ran, passed the ball around faster
than the Cards could react, and
found the open man. Ricky Lee
had 12 assists for the Beavers.
Good outside shooting
Oregon State's outside shoot
ing hardly made it necessary to
work the ball inside. The Beav
ers, led by junior college transfer
Rocky Smith and forward Don
Smith (no relation), shot 60 per
cent from the floor for the game,
and hit 10 of 17 shots from out
side the key in the second half.
TheSmiths combined to hit 11 of
14 field goal attempts in the sec
ond half. As long as the Beavers
were shooting like that, there
was no way Stanford, down
43-38 at halftime, was going to
catch up.
Rocky Smith finished with 11
of 16 from the floor and 23
points, while Don Smith hit
eight of 14 shots for 16 points.
The Cards' strategy of using a
zone defense against Oregon
State was questionable becausea
zone can be undermi ned by good
outside shooting. "That's the
first time anyone has tried to
zone us in a couple of years,"
said Miller.
Chance to win
Except for a poor defensive
performance in the first half,
Stanford, 1-6 in the Pac-8,
played well and had a chance to
win all the way until the last mi
nute and a half. Oregon State
led by five to nine points for

most of the first half, when the
Card defenders consistently av
oided the Beavers as if they had
communicable diseases. After
Shelton scored the first basket of
the second half, Stanford scored
eight straight points to lead
47-15. But then the Smiths put
Oregon State back on top and the
Cards never caught up.
Not much need he said of the
Oregon game — it was dull,
Stanford played poorly and the
McArthur Court fans, who lead
the Pac-8 in intimidation, were
uncharacteristically subdued.
There was one significant oc
currence: Stanford freshman
guard Paul Giovacchini injured
his knee, when Oregon's Stu
Jackson fell on it, and is out for
the season. Giovacchini will un
dergo surgery this morning at
Stanford Medical Center to re
pair ligament damage to his
right knee.
The Cards blew the game in
the first half when they were
outscored 24-5 in a nine-and
one-half minute stretch. Stan
ford hit only five of 23 field goal
attempts in the first half and
scored just 25 points. The Cards'
offensive highlight of the half
was Ed Schweitzer's six of seven
free throws.
Individually, Schweitzer, who
played against Oregon State
with flu symptoms, had his typi
cal outstanding Oregon trip. In
the two games combined, he
scored 44 points, collected 25
rebounds and hit 15 of 22 from
the floor.
Schader, suffering from a
"stress fracture" of the fibula just
below his knee, connected on
seven of 10 from the field and
scored 15 points against Oregon
State after going scoreless with
one rebound against Oregon. A
"stress fracture" is a fine break
which, according to Dißiaso,
"will not get worse (as Schader
plays), but will not get better."
Schader plays for as long as he
can stand the pain.

Miller and I wanted to try to do
away with them (the officials),
go back to the city game and let
the players call the fouls them
selves."
One of Dißiaso's complaints
involved an incident with just
1:45 gone in the game which re
sulted in a technical on the
Cards' coach. Beaver center
Lonnie Shelton gave Stanford
forward George Schader "a shot
George Foreman would have
been proud of," according to Di-
Biaso, and Schader was called
for a foul when he retaliated. Di-
Biaso jumped off the bench yel
ling irately at the ref, who then
nailed him with a "T."
"One ref in particular was out

to get me," said Shelton, who
played only 12 minutes because
of foul trouble and was not a
major factor in the game. "1 knew
it, he knew it, and the fans could
see iti"
After the Oregon game, a re
porter asked Dißiaso how he saw
the game. "Probably better than
a couple of other people," Stan
ford's rookie coach said.
Through it all, the best teams
won. The Beavers, 5-2 in the
Pacific Eight, played superbly
on offense and well enough on
defense Saturday. Oregon State
ran, passed the ball around faster
than the Cards could react, and
found the open man. Ricky Lee
had 12 assists for the Beavers.
Good outside shooting
Oregon State's outside shoot
ing hardly made it necessary to
work the ball inside. The Beav
ers, led by junior college transfer
Rocky Smith and forward Don
Smith (no relation), shot 60 per
cent from the floor for the game,
and hit 10 of 17 shots from out
side the key in the second half.
TheSmiths combined to hit 11 of
14 field goal attempts in the sec
ond half. As long as the Beavers
were shooting like that, there
was no way Stanford, down
43-38 at halftime, was going to
catch up.
Rocky Smith finished with 11
of 16 from the floor and 23
points, while Don Smith hit
eight of 14 shots for 16 points.
The Cards' strategy of using a
zone defense against Oregon
State was questionable becausea
zone can be undermi ned by good
outside shooting. "That's the
first time anyone has tried to
zone us in a couple of years,"
said Miller.
Chance to win
Except for a poor defensive
performance in the first half,
Stanford, 1-6 in the Pac-8,
played well and had a chance to
win all the way until the last mi
nute and a half. Oregon State
led by five to nine points for

most of the first half, when the
Card defenders consistently av
oided the Beavers as if they had
communicable diseases. After
Shelton scored the first basket of
the second half, Stanford scored
eight straight points to lead
47-15. But then the Smiths put
Oregon State back on top and the
Cards never caught up.
Not much need he said of the
Oregon game — it was dull,
Stanford played poorly and the
McArthur Court fans, who lead
the Pac-8 in intimidation, were
uncharacteristically subdued.
There was one significant oc
currence: Stanford freshman
guard Paul Giovacchini injured
his knee, when Oregon's Stu
Jackson fell on it, and is out for
the season. Giovacchini will un
dergo surgery this morning at
Stanford Medical Center to re
pair ligament damage to his
right knee.
The Cards blew the game in
the first half when they were
outscored 24-5 in a nine-and
one-half minute stretch. Stan
ford hit only five of 23 field goal
attempts in the first half and
scored just 25 points. The Cards'
offensive highlight of the half
was Ed Schweitzer's six of seven
free throws.
Individually, Schweitzer, who
played against Oregon State
with flu symptoms, had his typi
cal outstanding Oregon trip. In
the two games combined, he
scored 44 points, collected 25
rebounds and hit 15 of 22 from
the floor.
Schader, suffering from a
"stress fracture" of the fibula just
below his knee, connected on
seven of 10 from the field and
scored 15 points against Oregon
State after going scoreless with
one rebound against Oregon. A
"stress fracture" is a fine break
which, according to Dißiaso,
"will not get worse (as Schader
plays), but will not get better."
Schader plays for as long as he
can stand the pain.

CORVALUS. Ore. — Head
coaches are notorious tor mak
ing bland statements to the
press, especially about officials.
And with good reason —
coaches have been known to re
ceive fines for public criticism of
referees, and they don't usually
want to be accused of making
excuses. So instead of venting
their true feelings, coaches often
say things like, "Well, the refs
made a few questionable calls,
but they're only human."
Apparently, Stanford's Dick
Dißiaso is more open. Not only
did he speak his mind after the
Cards lost to Oregon, 72-59,
Thursday night in Eugene, and
Oregon State Saturday evening,
82-76, but he couldn't wait to
blast the refs.
'Butch Cassidy'
Standing outside Stanford's
locker room in Oregon State's
Gill Coliseum, Dißiaso
answered a couple of questions
unrelated to the refs, and then
said: "Since you asked about the
officiating.. .ButchCassidy and
the Sundance Kid rode through
the Y\ iiluinette Valley, stopped
at Gill Coliseum, and didn't tar
nish their reputation at all.

defense Saturday. Oregon State
ran, passed the ball around faster
than the Cards could react, and
found the open man. Ricky Lee
had 12 assists for the Beavers.
Good outside shooting
Oregon State's outside shoot
ing hardly made it necessary to
work the ball inside. The Beav
ers, led by junior college transfer
Rocky Smith and forward Don
Smith (no relation), shot 60 per
cent from the floor for the game,
and hit 10 of 17 shots from out
side the key in the second half.
TheSmiths combined to hit 11 of
14 field goal attempts in the sec
ond half. As long as the Beavers
were shooting like that, there
was no way Stanford, down
43-38 at halftime, was going to
catch up.
Rocky Smith finished with 11
of 16 from the floor and 23
points, while Don Smith hit
eight of 14 shots for 16 points.
The Cards' strategy of using a
zone defense against Oregon
State was questionable becausea
zone can be undermi ned by good
outside shooting. "That's the
first time anyone has tried to
zone us in a couple of years,"
said Miller.
Chance to win
Except for a poor defensive
performance in the first half,
Stanford, 1-6 in the Pac-8,
played well and had a chance to
win all the way until the last mi
nute and a half. Oregon State
led by five to nine points for

most of the first half, when the
Card defenders consistently av
oided the Beavers as if they had
communicable diseases. After
Shelton scored the first basket of
the second half, Stanford scored
eight straight points to lead
47-15. But then the Smiths put
Oregon State back on top and the
Cards never caught up.
Not much need he said of the
Oregon game — it was dull,
Stanford played poorly and the
McArthur Court fans, who lead
the Pac-8 in intimidation, were
uncharacteristically subdued.
There was one significant oc
currence: Stanford freshman
guard Paul Giovacchini injured
his knee, when Oregon's Stu
Jackson fell on it, and is out for
the season. Giovacchini will un
dergo surgery this morning at
Stanford Medical Center to re
pair ligament damage to his
right knee.
The Cards blew the game in
the first half when they were
outscored 24-5 in a nine-and
one-half minute stretch. Stan
ford hit only five of 23 field goal
attempts in the first half and
scored just 25 points. The Cards'
offensive highlight of the half
was Ed Schweitzer's six of seven
free throws.
Individually, Schweitzer, who
played against Oregon State
with flu symptoms, had his typi
cal outstanding Oregon trip. In
the two games combined, he
scored 44 points, collected 25
rebounds and hit 15 of 22 from
the floor.
Schader, suffering from a
"stress fracture" of the fibula just
below his knee, connected on
seven of 10 from the field and
scored 15 points against Oregon
State after going scoreless with
one rebound against Oregon. A
"stress fracture" is a fine break
which, according to Dißiaso,
"will not get worse (as Schader
plays), but will not get better."
Schader plays for as long as he
can stand the pain.

CORVALUS. Ore. — Head
coaches are notorious tor mak
ing bland statements to the
press, especially about officials.
And with good reason —
coaches have been known to re
ceive fines for public criticism of
referees, and they don't usually
want to be accused of making
excuses. So instead of venting
their true feelings, coaches often
say things like, "Well, the refs
made a few questionable calls,
but they're only human."
Apparently, Stanford's Dick
Dißiaso is more open. Not only
did he speak his mind after the
Cards lost to Oregon, 72-59,
Thursday night in Eugene, and
Oregon State Saturday evening,
82-76, but he couldn't wait to
blast the refs.
'Butch Cassidy'
Standing outside Stanford's
locker room in Oregon State's
Gill Coliseum, Dißiaso
answered a couple of questions
unrelated to the refs, and then
said: "Since you asked about the
officiating.. .ButchCassidy and
the Sundance Kid rode through
the Y\ iiluinette Valley, stopped
at Gill Coliseum, and didn't tar
nish their reputation at all.
"(Oregon State coach) Ralph
Miller and I wanted to try to do
away with them (the officials),
go back to the city game and let
the players call the fouls them
selves."
One of Dißiaso's complaints
involved an incident with just
1:45 gone in the game which re
sulted in a technical on the
Cards' coach. Beaver center
Lonnie Shelton gave Stanford
forward George Schader "a shot
George Foreman would have
been proud of," according to Di-
Biaso, and Schader was called
for a foul when he retaliated. Di-
Biaso jumped off the bench yel
ling irately at the ref, who then
nailed him with a "T."
"One ref in particular was out

to get me," said Shelton, who
played only 12 minutes because
of foul trouble and was not a
major factor in the game. "1 knew
it, he knew it, and the fans could
see iti"
After the Oregon game, a re
porter asked Dißiaso how he saw
the game. "Probably better than
a couple of other people," Stan
ford's rookie coach said.
Through it all, the best teams
won. The Beavers, 5-2 in the
Pacific Eight, played superbly
on offense and well enough on

performance in the first half,
Stanford, 1-6 in the Pac-8,
played well and had a chance to
win all the way until the last mi
nute and a half. Oregon State
led by five to nine points for

most of the first half, when the
Card defenders consistently av
oided the Beavers as if they had
communicable diseases. After
Shelton scored the first basket of
the second half, Stanford scored
eight straight points to lead
47-15. But then the Smiths put
Oregon State back on top and the
Cards never caught up.
Not much need he said of the
Oregon game — it was dull,
Stanford played poorly and the
McArthur Court fans, who lead
the Pac-8 in intimidation, were
uncharacteristically subdued.
There was one significant oc
currence: Stanford freshman
guard Paul Giovacchini injured
his knee, when Oregon's Stu
Jackson fell on it, and is out for
the season. Giovacchini will un
dergo surgery this morning at
Stanford Medical Center to re
pair ligament damage to his
right knee.
The Cards blew the game in
the first half when they were
outscored 24-5 in a nine-and
one-half minute stretch. Stan
ford hit only five of 23 field goal
attempts in the first half and
scored just 25 points. The Cards'
offensive highlight of the half
was Ed Schweitzer's six of seven
free throws.
Individually, Schweitzer, who
played against Oregon State
with flu symptoms, had his typi
cal outstanding Oregon trip. In
the two games combined, he
scored 44 points, collected 25
rebounds and hit 15 of 22 from
the floor.
Schader, suffering from a
"stress fracture" of the fibula just
below his knee, connected on
seven of 10 from the field and
scored 15 points against Oregon
State after going scoreless with
one rebound against Oregon. A
"stress fracture" is a fine break
which, according to Dißiaso,
"will not get worse (as Schader
plays), but will not get better."
Schader plays for as long as he
can stand the pain.

CORVALUS. Ore. — Head
coaches are notorious tor mak
ing bland statements to the
press, especially about officials.
And with good reason —
coaches have been known to re
ceive fines for public criticism of
referees, and they don't usually
want to be accused of making
excuses. So instead of venting
their true feelings, coaches often
say things like, "Well, the refs
made a few questionable calls,
but they're only human."
Apparently, Stanford's Dick
Dißiaso is more open. Not only
did he speak his mind after the
Cards lost to Oregon, 72-59,
Thursday night in Eugene, and
Oregon State Saturday evening,
82-76, but he couldn't wait to
blast the refs.
'Butch Cassidy'
Standing outside Stanford's
locker room in Oregon State's
Gill Coliseum, Dißiaso
answered a couple of questions
unrelated to the refs, and then
said: "Since you asked about the
officiating.. .ButchCassidy and
the Sundance Kid rode through
the Y\ iiluinette Valley, stopped
at Gill Coliseum, and didn't tar
nish their reputation at all.
"(Oregon State coach) Ralph
Miller and I wanted to try to do
away with them (the officials),
go back to the city game and let
the players call the fouls them
selves."
One of Dißiaso's complaints
involved an incident with just
1:45 gone in the game which re
sulted in a technical on the
Cards' coach. Beaver center
Lonnie Shelton gave Stanford
forward George Schader "a shot
George Foreman would have
been proud of," according to Di-
Biaso, and Schader was called
for a foul when he retaliated. Di-
Biaso jumped off the bench yel
ling irately at the ref, who then
nailed him with a "T."
"One ref in particular was out

to get me," said Shelton, who
played only 12 minutes because
of foul trouble and was not a
major factor in the game. "1 knew
it, he knew it, and the fans could
see iti"
After the Oregon game, a re
porter asked Dißiaso how he saw
the game. "Probably better than
a couple of other people," Stan
ford's rookie coach said.
Through it all, the best teams
won. The Beavers, 5-2 in the
Pacific Eight, played superbly
on offense and well enough on
defense Saturday. Oregon State
ran, passed the ball around faster
than the Cards could react, and
found the open man. Ricky Lee
had 12 assists for the Beavers.
Good outside shooting
Oregon State's outside shoot
ing hardly made it necessary to
work the ball inside. The Beav
ers, led by junior college transfer
Rocky Smith and forward Don
Smith (no relation), shot 60 per
cent from the floor for the game,
and hit 10 of 17 shots from out
side the key in the second half.
TheSmiths combined to hit 11 of
14 field goal attempts in the sec
ond half. As long as the Beavers
were shooting like that, there
was no way Stanford, down
43-38 at halftime, was going to
catch up.
Rocky Smith finished with 11
of 16 from the floor and 23
points, while Don Smith hit
eight of 14 shots for 16 points.
The Cards' strategy of using a
zone defense against Oregon
State was questionable becausea
zone can be undermi ned by good
outside shooting. "That's the
first time anyone has tried to
zone us in a couple of years,"
said Miller.

performance in the first half,
Stanford, 1-6 in the Pac-8,

attempts in the first half and
scored just 25 points. The Cards'
offensive highlight of the half
was Ed Schweitzer's six of seven
free throws.
Individually, Schweitzer, who
played against Oregon State
with flu symptoms, had his typi
cal outstanding Oregon trip. In
the two games combined, he
scored 44 points, collected 25
rebounds and hit 15 of 22 from
the floor.
Schader, suffering from a
"stress fracture" of the fibula just
below his knee, connected on
seven of 10 from the field and
scored 15 points against Oregon
State after going scoreless with
one rebound against Oregon. A
"stress fracture" is a fine break
which, according to Dißiaso,
"will not get worse (as Schader
plays), but will not get better."
Schader plays for as long as he
can stand the pain.

CORVALUS. Ore. — Head
coaches are notorious tor mak
ing bland statements to the
press, especially about officials.
And with good reason —
coaches have been known to re
ceive fines for public criticism of
referees, and they don't usually
want to be accused of making
excuses. So instead of venting
their true feelings, coaches often
say things like, "Well, the refs
made a few questionable calls,
but they're only human."
Apparently, Stanford's Dick
Dißiaso is more open. Not only
did he speak his mind after the
Cards lost to Oregon, 72-59,
Thursday night in Eugene, and
Oregon State Saturday evening,
82-76, but he couldn't wait to
blast the refs.
'Butch Cassidy'
Standing outside Stanford's
locker room in Oregon State's
Gill Coliseum, Dißiaso
answered a couple of questions
unrelated to the refs, and then
said: "Since you asked about the
officiating.. .ButchCassidy and
the Sundance Kid rode through
the Y\ iiluinette Valley, stopped
at Gill Coliseum, and didn't tar
nish their reputation at all.
"(Oregon State coach) Ralph
Miller and I wanted to try to do
away with them (the officials),
go back to the city game and let
the players call the fouls them
selves."
One of Dißiaso's complaints
involved an incident with just
1:45 gone in the game which re
sulted in a technical on the
Cards' coach. Beaver center
Lonnie Shelton gave Stanford
forward George Schader "a shot
George Foreman would have
been proud of," according to Di-
Biaso, and Schader was called
for a foul when he retaliated. Di-
Biaso jumped off the bench yel
ling irately at the ref, who then
nailed him with a "T."
"One ref in particular was out

to get me," said Shelton, who
played only 12 minutes because
of foul trouble and was not a
major factor in the game. "1 knew
it, he knew it, and the fans could
see iti"
After the Oregon game, a re
porter asked Dißiaso how he saw
the game. "Probably better than
a couple of other people," Stan
ford's rookie coach said.
Through it all, the best teams
won. The Beavers, 5-2 in the
Pacific Eight, played superbly
on offense and well enough on
defense Saturday. Oregon State
ran, passed the ball around faster
than the Cards could react, and
found the open man. Ricky Lee
had 12 assists for the Beavers.
Good outside shooting
Oregon State's outside shoot
ing hardly made it necessary to
work the ball inside. The Beav
ers, led by junior college transfer
Rocky Smith and forward Don
Smith (no relation), shot 60 per
cent from the floor for the game,
and hit 10 of 17 shots from out
side the key in the second half.
TheSmiths combined to hit 11 of
14 field goal attempts in the sec
ond half. As long as the Beavers
were shooting like that, there
was no way Stanford, down
43-38 at halftime, was going to
catch up.
Rocky Smith finished with 11
of 16 from the floor and 23
points, while Don Smith hit
eight of 14 shots for 16 points.
The Cards' strategy of using a
zone defense against Oregon
State was questionable becausea
zone can be undermi ned by good
outside shooting. "That's the
first time anyone has tried to
zone us in a couple of years,"
said Miller.
Chance to win
Except for a poor defensive
performance in the first half,
Stanford, 1-6 in the Pac-8,
played well and had a chance to
win all the way until the last mi
nute and a half. Oregon State
led by five to nine points for

most of the first half, when the
Card defenders consistently av
oided the Beavers as if they had
communicable diseases. After
Shelton scored the first basket of
the second half, Stanford scored
eight straight points to lead
47-15. But then the Smiths put
Oregon State back on top and the
Cards never caught up.
Not much need he said of the
Oregon game — it was dull,
Stanford played poorly and the
McArthur Court fans, who lead
the Pac-8 in intimidation, were
uncharacteristically subdued.
There was one significant oc
currence: Stanford freshman
guard Paul Giovacchini injured
his knee, when Oregon's Stu
Jackson fell on it, and is out for
the season. Giovacchini will un
dergo surgery this morning at
Stanford Medical Center to re
pair ligament damage to his
right knee.
The Cards blew the game in
the first half when they were
outscored 24-5 in a nine-and
one-half minute stretch. Stan
ford hit only five of 23 field goal
attempts in the first half and
scored just 25 points. The Cards'
offensive highlight of the half
was Ed Schweitzer's six of seven
free throws.
Individually, Schweitzer, who
played against Oregon State
with flu symptoms, had his typi
cal outstanding Oregon trip. In
the two games combined, he
scored 44 points, collected 25
rebounds and hit 15 of 22 from
the floor.
Schader, suffering from a
"stress fracture" of the fibula just
below his knee, connected on
seven of 10 from the field and
scored 15 points against Oregon
State after going scoreless with
one rebound against Oregon. A
"stress fracture" is a fine break
which, according to Dißiaso,
"will not get worse (as Schader
plays), but will not get better."
Schader plays for as long as he
can stand the pain.
