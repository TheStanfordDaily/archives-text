# Pac-8 roundup
## Bruins alone in first place 
### Marko Fong 
It looks like tradition may not prevail this year
in the Pacific Eight. Unfortunately, for UCLA's
rivals, the tradition is not the Bruins' string of
nine Pac-8 basketball titles.
It seems the last time, before this year, that
UCLA won the Rose Bowl wi th a quarterback who
couldn't pass was in 1966. That was also the last
year that a team other than UCLA won the confer
ence basketball title â€” Oregon State.
Thursday the Bruins reasserted their hegemony
despite John Scirra, by housetraining the
Washington Huskies. 92-87, in Seattle. UCLA
trounced Washington State, 91-71, Saturday
night in Pullman.
Marques Johnson hot
UCLA's Marques Johnson came out of a scoring
lull, with 58 points for the two contests, 32 against
the Cougars. Washington, which went into the
UCLA game ranked fifth in the nation, could not
cope with the Bruins' 60 percent performance
from the floor (33-55).
A little further south. California made things
unbearable for Oregon State, another Pac-8 title
pretender, 73-72. Beaver center Lonnie Shelton,
trying to prove that he is not a professional bas
ketball player, missed two free throws at 72-71,
with 13 seconds left in the game.
Then Bear guard Gene Ransom, whose middle

name seems tobes-foot-9, hit a 25-footer, to finish
both the Beavers and his scoring at, oddly enough,
25 points. Cal reserve center Mark Dickey held
Shelton, who finished with 21 points, to just over
two points during a 21-minute span.
Saturday, in an attempt to prove that the win
over OSU was a fluke, the Bears lost to Oregon,
79-60, in Mac Court. The Bears "quacked" (sorry)
under the pressure of the Duck defense, shooting
only 29 percent from the f<ioor.
Lee scores
Oregon super guard Ronnie Lee, who has been
scoring more than a nymphomaniac in a Marine
barracks, had 23 points for Oregon.
The USC Trojans, whom some call UCLA's bas
ketball shadow, acted more like the Bruins' mir
ror, as they consoled the Washington teams by
losing two games.
Washington State, behind the 18-point perfor
mance of center Steve Puidokas, Ron Davis and
Norton Barnhill, beat USC, 80-72, Thursday
night.
Over in Seattle, the Dogs, behind guard Chester
Dorsey's 20 first-half-points, came from behind
for a 91-79 win over the Trojans.
Someone should tell USC coach Bob Boyd that
there is no basketball equivalent of the Liberty
Bowl. His team is now 0-7 in the conference and
11-2 in non-conference play.
