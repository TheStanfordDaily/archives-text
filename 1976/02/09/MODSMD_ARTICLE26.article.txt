# Kelley adjusts to NBA

NEW ORLEANS — "New Orleans loves
the Jazz" — and it's beginning to like Rich
Kelley quite a bit, too.
When the NBA's newest franchise
drafted Stanford's All-America center in
the first round last May, Jazz fans expected
great shakes from this California giant. At
first, they were vastly disappointed.
"I collected quite a few boos during my
first two months here," Kelley recalls. "1
guess they expected me to turn the team
around, but of course 1 wasn't quite able to
do all that."
Fans appreciative
Now, however, the record crowds
which flock to the Crescent City's magni
ficent new Superdome are more apprecia
tive when Kelley comes off the bench to
spell starting center Otto "Say No" Moore,
a seven-year veteran of the NBA.
At the beginning of the season, Jazz
coach Butch van Breda Kolff said of Kel
ley, "1 hope to bring him along slowly and
hope that he comes along faster than I ex
pect." As a result, Kelley is only getting
between 15 and 20 minutes of playing
time in most games and is averaging about
six points per game.
This, of course, represents a major
change from Kelley's days at Stanford —
he started in 75 out of 76 games during his
three years on the Cardinal varsity and he
was rarely out of a game for more than a
few minutes. The results: a three-year av
erage of 18.fi points and 12.4 rebounds per
game.
New role
But Kelley remains happy in his new
back-up role. He feels that his own game

has improved since the first of the year,
and realizes that his chance to break in as a
starter may not be far away. Moore will be
30 this year and is no youngster by NBA
standards.
Kelley also has the security of a long
term contract. According to a recent local
newspaper account, the 7-footer has a
five-year, no-cut pact with the Jazz for
roughly $200,000 a year. Naturally
enough, Kelley regards his financial situa
tion as a strictly personal matter, and is
reluctant to discuss it.
He is, however, quite outspoken about
his relationship with his teammates and
about the prospects for the Jazz during the
remainder of this season.
Close team
"All of us on the Jazz have become
pretty close in the last few months," Kel
ley says. "During the season, the only way
we stay loose is by giving each other an
incredible amount of ribbing."
Kelley's nickname among his fellow
Jazzmen is a product of this good-natured
atmosphere. The rookie is known as AWB
("Average White Boy"). All of this is fine
when the team is winning, Kelley says,
"but when we start losing, the same jokes
don't seem nearly as funny. There's a bit of
an edge to the humor."
One factor which seems to contribute to
this relaxed environment is the relative
youth of Kelley's teammates. Rich himself
is only the second youngest man on the
team, after reserve guard Jim McElroy,
who was selected by the Jazz in the third
round of last year's draft.
Young team
In addition, the Jazz has one one-year
"veteran" of the NBA, three two-year men
and three three-year vets. The superstar of
the team, "Pistol" Fete Maravich, has only

been out of Louisiana State University for
five years. Coincidentally, three other
Jazzmen are, like Kelley, products of
Pacific Eight basketball.
This young team surprised just about
everybody by winning six games in a row
after an opening night loss to the Atlanta
Hawks. Two weeks into the season, the
Jazz had the best record in the NBA. "As a
team," Kelley said, they were playing
"very well, very confidentally and very
together."
An NBA-record crowd of 26,511 jam
med the Superdome on Nov. 5 to see the
Jazz win its sixth straight game, defeating
Los Angeles 113-110. Then, disaster
struck. The team lost its next five outings
before Maravich was sidelined tor almost
six weeks with a shoulder separation.
During the Pistol's absence, the Jazz
went 4-13, at one point losing eight
straight, and fell to the cellar of the NBA's
Central Division. By late December, all of
that good-natured ribbing on the team
must have gotten more than a little vici
ous.
Since Maravich's return on Christmas
Day, however, the Jazz has won 12 and lost
eight. And Kelley seems to have come
alive.
'Playing well'
"I'm playing really well now, and both
my shooting and rebounding are coming
along well," Kelley said prior to a Jan. 21
home game loss to the Chicago Bulls. His
words now seem prophetic, for in that
game, Kelley scored nine points and
snared a career-high 19 rebounds.
On the next night, against the
Washington Bullets, Kelley had another
15 rebounds and scored his season's best
of 20 points. The Jazz, however, lost 109-
86.
