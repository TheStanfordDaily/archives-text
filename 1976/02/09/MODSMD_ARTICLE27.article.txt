# Vermeil resigns, takes NFL post
## 
### Chris Baker 
UCLA football coach Dick
Vermeil, who in only his second
year as a head coach guided the
Bruins to a 23-10 1976 Rose
Bowl upset win over Ohio State,
will leave West wood to coach
the Philadelphia Eagles, it was
announced yesterday.
The announcement by owner
Len Tose of the National Foot
ball League team that the 39-
,year-old Vermeil had been given
a five-year contract ended the
Eagles'search for a successor to
fired headman Mike McCormack
and started UCLA's search for a
successor to Vermeil.
UCLA has lost three coaches to
professional football and other
colleges since Tommy Prothro
left Westwood to join the Los
Angeles Rams in 1970.
Middle of recruiting season
The announcement couldn't
have come at a worse time for the
UCLA Athletic Department —
right in the middle of recruiting
season. The deadline for prep re
cruits to sign the National Letter
of Intent is Feb. 18.
Stanford faced a similar situa
tion when John Ralston an
nounced that he was leaving to
take the Denver Bronco head
coaching job in mid-January of
1972. Stanford suffered through
a poor crop of recruits as a resu It.
"I'm sure they (UCLA Athletic
Department) probably have
some type of plan in mind," said
Stanford football coach Jack
Christiansen. "The recruiting
deadline's only 10 days away
and I think they'll act quickly."
Vermeil is the fourth head
football boss to resign from a
Pac-8 job this year. Former USC
coach and Athletic Director John
McKay left Troy to coach the
NFL's new Tampa franchise.
WashingtonState's Jim Sweeney
and Oregon State's Dee Andros
resigned after poor seasons.
'New looks'
"It (having four new coaches)
will create a lot of new looks,"
said Christiansen. "It could open
the race up a lot." Chris and
California coach Mike White are
now the senior coaches among
Pac-8 football mentors, with four
seasons of experience.
Chris said that a lot of recruits
have already made decisions
and that the departure of Ver
meil probably wouldn't hurt
''CLA's recruiting that much.
The Bruins are losing quarter
back John Sciarra to graduation

and will have to replace much of
their defensive interior line.
UCLA Athletic Director J.D.
Morgan, who has taken a lot of
criticism over his appointment
of Gene Bartow to replace John
Wooden as Bruin basketball
boss, promised that a head foot
ball coach would be named
soon. Speculation has centered
around UCLA Asst. Head Coach
Jim Criner as a possible replace
ment, but Morgan has gone out
side the school to pick head
coaches .before.
Several other college coaches,
including Joe Paterno of Penn
State and Joe Restic of Harvard
had been approached by the
Eagles about becoming the
Eagles fourth head coach in
eight years, but they all turned
the job down.
"We got the man we wanted,"
said Tose. "We are extremely
pleased to have added a coach of
Dick Vermeil's ability to our or
ganization," Tose said.
"We wanted a man with
superior intelligence, experi
ence as a head coach and with a
winning record. A man with pro
football experience and an of
fensive innovator and a
motivator."
Vermiel's pro experience was
as an assistant under Tommy
Prothro and Chuck Knox, all of
the Los Angeles Rams. He also
assisted John Ralston at Stan
ford, before Ralston left to be
come head coach of the Denver
Broncos.

UCLA Athletic Director J.D.
Morgan, who has taken a lot of
criticism over his appointment
of Gene Bartow to replace John
Wooden as Bruin basketball
boss, promised that a head foot
ball coach would be named
soon. Speculation has centered
around UCLA Asst. Head Coach
Jim Criner as a possible replace
ment, but Morgan has gone out
side the school to pick head
coaches .before.
Several other college coaches,
including Joe Paterno of Penn
State and Joe Restic of Harvard
had been approached by the
Eagles about becoming the
Eagles fourth head coach in
eight years, but they all turned
the job down.
"We got the man we wanted,"
said Tose. "We are extremely
pleased to have added a coach of
Dick Vermeil's ability to our or
ganization," Tose said.
"We wanted a man with
superior intelligence, experi
ence as a head coach and with a
winning record. A man with pro
football experience and an of
fensive innovator and a
motivator."
Vermiel's pro experience was
as an assistant under Tommy
Prothro and Chuck Knox, all of
the Los Angeles Rams. He also
assisted John Ralston at Stan
ford, before Ralston left to be
come head coach of the Denver
Broncos.


Dick Vermeil -
UCLA football coach Dick
Vermeil, who in only his second
year as a head coach guided the
Bruins to a 23-10 1976 Rose
Bowl upset win over Ohio State,
will leave West wood to coach
the Philadelphia Eagles, it was
announced yesterday.
The announcement by owner
Len Tose of the National Foot
ball League team that the 39-
,year-old Vermeil had been given
a five-year contract ended the
Eagles'search for a successor to
fired headman Mike McCormack
and started UCLA's search for a
successor to Vermeil.
UCLA has lost three coaches to
professional football and other
colleges since Tommy Prothro
left Westwood to join the Los
Angeles Rams in 1970.
Middle of recruiting season
The announcement couldn't
have come at a worse time for the
UCLA Athletic Department —
right in the middle of recruiting
season. The deadline for prep re
cruits to sign the National Letter
of Intent is Feb. 18.
Stanford faced a similar situa
tion when John Ralston an
nounced that he was leaving to
take the Denver Bronco head
coaching job in mid-January of
1972. Stanford suffered through
a poor crop of recruits as a resu It.
"I'm sure they (UCLA Athletic
Department) probably have
some type of plan in mind," said
Stanford football coach Jack
Christiansen. "The recruiting
deadline's only 10 days away
and I think they'll act quickly."
Vermeil is the fourth head
football boss to resign from a
Pac-8 job this year. Former USC
coach and Athletic Director John
McKay left Troy to coach the
NFL's new Tampa franchise.
WashingtonState's Jim Sweeney
and Oregon State's Dee Andros
resigned after poor seasons.
'New looks'
"It (having four new coaches)
will create a lot of new looks,"
said Christiansen. "It could open
the race up a lot." Chris and
California coach Mike White are
now the senior coaches among
Pac-8 football mentors, with four
seasons of experience.
Chris said that a lot of recruits
have already made decisions
and that the departure of Ver
meil probably wouldn't hurt
''CLA's recruiting that much.
The Bruins are losing quarter
back John Sciarra to graduation

and will have to replace much of
their defensive interior line.
