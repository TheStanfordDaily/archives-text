### Bob Zuckerman 
Forty rare coins stolen from the
Stanford Museum of Art last May were
recovered Friday afternoon, but
museum officials and the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Office are being secre
tive about details of the recovery.
Detective James Wilkes confirmed
yesterday earlier reports that an attor
ney returned the coins — valued at
$28,000 — to the sheriff's office about
noon. Wilkes would neither identify
the attorney nor say how he came into
possession of the coins.
Wilkes said he would not release
any other information because the case
is "still under investigation," but
added the police have no suspects in
the case.
Museum director Lorenz Eitner
..complained that the police allegedly

"leaked" news of the coin recovery to
the press.
Eitner, professor of art, said,
"There's something extremely in
teresting about the (police) investiga
tion, but I won't tell you about it. Un
like the police, I'm discreet. I'm not
interested in releasing a story which
will only help the criminals."
He blasted newspaper and other
media coverage of the coins' recovery.
"The Daily and other members of the
irresponsible press have no interest in
what goes on at the museum except
when it's something like this," he said.
The coins were among 44 ancient
coins stolen from the museum last
May. Police reported that the thief or
thieves apparently hid in the museum
until after closing hours. An alarm was
triggered when they left.

Other items stolen with the coins in
clude Navajo turquoise jewelry and a
silver platter, police said.
Museum official Isabelle
Raubitschek said that the stolen gold,
silver and bronze coins included sev
eral Greek Tetradracmas and Roman
Sesterces circa 512 B.C.
Some of the coins were donated to
the museum in 1916, said
Raubitschek, assoc. professor of art
history. Before the theft, the coins had
been displayed together for about a
year, she said.
The theft is the first reported in al
most two years. In 1974, $2400 worth
of Japanese ivory statuary was taken
from the museum. Three days later, a
$15,000 Ch'ing dynasty Chinese vase
was also stolen. The ivory and vase
have not been recovered.
