Admission of tapes sought
SAN FRANCISCO — Patricia Hearst pro
secutors say they will ask her judge to accept as
evidence a tape in which the newspaper heiress
boasts of participating willingly in a bank rob
bery with her Symbionese Liberation Army kid
napers.
U.S. District Court Judge Oliver Carter
scheduled a special hearing today — outside the
presence of the jury — to decide whether it will
hear the tape. The tape was sent from the under
ground nine days after the April 15, 1974. San
Francisco holdup for which Hearst is on trial.
Carter said he would allow both the prosecu
tion and the defense to present whatever tes
timony they want at the hearing, including wit
nesses. So it was possible that Hearst would
testify about the making of the tape.
U.S. Atty. James Browning said the jury
should get to hear the tape, which he branded
"an admission of guilt."
Chief defense counsel F. Lee Bailey has con
tended the script for the tape was written by SLA
member Angela Atwood and Hearst was forced
to record it.
The judge also must rule on whether any of
Hearst's activity with the SLA after the robbery
is admissible as evidence, including a May 16,
1974, incident in which she allegedly sprayed a
Los Angeles area sporting goods store with
machine gun fire.
The defense wants mention of any such activ
ity suppressed as irrelevant to the bank robbery
case.
Carter, Harris deadlocked
OKLAHOMA CITY — Former Georgia Gov.
Jimmy Carter and former Oklahoma Sen.Fred
Harris were deadlocked in early returns from
state Democratic caucuses, but the largest block
of delegates chosen by party members was un
committed to any presidential aspirant.
With nearly 70 percent of the precincts report
ing yesterday, 35.64 percent of the delegates
chosen in this first step toward selecting Democ
ratic National Convention representatives were
uncommitted.
Carter had collected 19.89 percent of the
committed delegates and Harris 19.87 percent.
Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's delegates polled
11.97 percent of the vote and Alabama Gov.
George Wallace's 11.88 percent.

"I think when all the delegate are counted, it
will be very close, but what we have outstanding
now indicates Carter will have a slight edge,"
said Bill Crane, administrative assistant at party
headquarters. "1 think when all the votes are in,
Carter will slightly defeat Harris."
Party officials said the final count from Satur
day's voting may not be known until tomorrow,
the deadline for precinct chairman to report re
sults to state headquarters.
Harris lost his home precinct in Lawton to
Carter — securing one delegate to Carter's three
— but he claimed victory in the caucuses in a
statement issued in Washington late Saturday
night.
A Carter spokesman responded that "the areas
which have not yet reported are those where we
are doing better and Mr. Harris is not doing quite
as well."
Nader a 'communist target'
WASHINGTON — Consumer advocate Ralph
Nader has been one of the prime targets of
Communist bloc intelligence operations in the
United States, according to testimony released
yesterday by the Senate internal security sub
committee. A high level defector from the
Chechoslovakian intelligence service told the
subcommittee that "a quite exceptional amount
of interest" has been devoted to Nader because
"he is such a powerful figure in public life of the
United States."
The defector, identified as Joseph Frolik, told
the subcommittee that in 1968 he had been or
dered to arrange for the surveillance of Nader's
relatives in Lebanon.
"The Czech Service collected afile on him, his
contacts with the government, and other people
and the power of his organization, and decided
that it would be useful to recruit him, if such a
chance would exist in the future." Frolik said.
Asked by Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), if he
knew whether Nader had ever been approached
or recruited, Frolik replied, "to the contrary,
there was nothing in the file which shows that
Mr. Nader was contacted by the service."
Frolik testified in closed session last
November.
Nader said the report "is news to me," adding
that "it's sort of crazy."

13,000 dead in Guatemala
GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala — At least

12,804 persons perished in Guatemala's devas
tating earthquake and aftershocks, the govern
ment's emergency relief committee announced
yesterday.
It based its figures on burial reports and esti
mated another 40,000 persons were injured and
200,000 were homeless.
Foreign correspondence travelling into rural
areas saw hundreds of still unburied bodies 1
bloating in the sun and private relief agencies
predicted the final death toll would exceed
14,000.
As the tragic count continued, Guatemalans
gathered in the dusty streets beside the ruins of
their churches to hear Mass.
"We have been praying a lot since the many
tragedies started hitting us on Wednes
day . . . but it is not the same as going to church
and hearing the comforting words of the padre,"
said a mother of three whose husband died in the
massive quake.
Catalans demand home rule
BARCELONA, Spain — Thousands of Cata
lans demanding home rule and political liberty
defied police yesterday in the largest anti
government demonstration in Barcelona since
the Spanish Civil War.
Police fired rubber bullets and smoke gre
nades, bloodied demonstrators and pounded on
honking automobiles but were unable to stop the
scores of protests that paralyzed the Catalan cap
ital for more than five hours.
The city's streets were littered with broken
glass and park benches as demonstrators fired
back with stones. Some sectors of the city were
in a virtual state of siege. Several injuries and
arrests were reported.
Police did not give an estimate on the number
of demonstrators, but an organizer of the protest
said at least 50,000 persons took part, and that
the number of participants conceivably could
have been twice that many.
The Catalan region in southeast Spain won
autonomy in 1932 from the republican govern
ment. Franco abolished it after winning the civil
war seven years later.
But the region, the wealthiest in Spain, and its
seven million people have retained strong feel
ings for more independence from the central
government. The Catalan language still is ban
ned from official use although it is widely spo
ken.

At the height of yesterday's protest, police
jumped in and out of buses and jeeps chasing
demonstrators. But it soon became evident they
could not keep up with the street protests. One
politician estimated as many as 20 street de
monstrations were under way at one time.
Syria arid Israel
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Syrian Defense Minister
Mustafa Tlass said in an interview published
yesterday that Syria will strike at Israel if Israeli
forces attack Lebanon to sabotage the civil war
settlement.
He also said an estimated 2000 troops of the
Palestine Liberation Army (PLA), who entered
Lebanon from Syria in the last days of the 10-
month war, will pull out within a "month or two
at the most."
"Gone is the time when Israel used to threaten
and attack," Tlass told the Beirut newspaper A 1
Tayat. "If Israel attacks to abort the settlement
we shall strike out at her."
Israeli leaders have expressed concern that
Syrian sponsorship of the cease-fire could lead
to Syrian dominance of Lebanon and turn this
country into a belligerent state in the Mideast
conflict.
Tlass said 67 Syrian army officers superin
tending the cease-fire in Lebanon also will pull
out with PLA units. The PLA force reinforced
leftist Moslem Lebanese before the cease-fire
went into effect Jan. 22.
In a joint communique issued after the
Damascus meeting, Syria also pledged to
guarantee regulation oTthe presence in Lebanon
of Palestinian guerrillas and their anti-Israeli ac
tivity here.
The political agreement, announced Satur
day, reapportions power evenly between Leba
non's Moslem and Christian communities. A
constitutional document containing the
Moslem-demanded reforms will be announced
this week, followed by formation of a national
reconciliation government under Moslem Pre
mier Rashid Karami, the Damascus com
munique said.
Today's weather
Showers likely today. Partly cloudy tonight
and tomorrow. Cooler tonight with lows in mid
30s to mid 40s. Highs today and tomorrow in the
50s to low 60s. Westerly winds 10 to 20 mph
