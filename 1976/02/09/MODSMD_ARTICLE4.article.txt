# Group supports prisoners of conscience

"The CIA will be closed tomorrow."
Pause. "It's Lucky Luciano's birth
day." The 250 people gathered last
Thursday evening in a rented hall on
the San Francisco waterfront roared
with laughter and applause.
A few moments later they were sob
erly listening to a mournful tale of tor
ture and imprisonment. Between the
emotional poles of the satirical wit of
Art Buchwald and grisly, real-life
anecdotes, this Amnesty International
benefit was paying homage to jailed
writers, artists and journalists around
the world.
Amnesty International is a
London-based group that attempts to
mobilize pressure to free political
prisoners around the world. Amnesty
International is often mistaken for one

of the groups working on amnesty for
those who ran afoul of the military dur
ing the Vietnam War. But Amnesty In
ternational was founded in 1961 with
"the different and broader aim of per
sistently pestering governments on
behalf of persons imprisoned solely for
their beliefs.
For example, when Leonid
Flyushch, a mathematician and politi
cal dissident released in January from
a Soviet mental hospital, spoke to
news reporters in Paris this month, he
thanked Amnesty International as one
of the organizations that helped obtain
his release.
The San Francisco benefit focused
on artists and literary figures who were
behind bars. San Francisco's Art
Hoppe, who writes a syndicated col
umn of political satire, introduced his

Washington-based competitor
Buchwald. Hoppe spoke at length sar
donically praising the folksy, primi
tive, corny flavor that writing from
Washington gives to Buchwald's col
umns. Unsophisticated Washington
was contrasted with cosmopolitan San
Francisco.
Hoppe also had some imaginative
variations on the pronunciation of
Buchwald's name in the course of the
introduction. Hoppe asked how many
in the audience read Buchwald's col
umn in the Milpitas newspaper (since
it doesn't run in the San Francisco

Chronicle or Examiner). Hoppe
wound up by gleefully calling
Buchwald, "the Albert Morch of
Washington, D.C.," thereby managing
to twit both Buchwald and the
Examiner's society columnist.
Buchwald, the evening's master of
ceremonies, then told his audience
that the life of a political satirist was
becoming increasingly difficult. "It
used to be that we wrote the funny
stuff," he said, "and the government
played it straight." Buchwald then
followed with a series of jokes about
such absurdities as Marlon Brando's
gift of heavily mortgaged land to the
Indians and the ClA's plot to depilate
Castro's beard.
Buchwald went on to note that meet
ings on political topics are not legal in
many countries. Political satire is
treated as a crime against the integrity
of the state, a libel upon government
officials, and a subversive act under
mining the public order.
Norman Lear, creator of "All in the
Family," "Maude," and "Good
Times," said that Americans don't of
ten see censorship and imprisonment
of domestic writers. But Lear warned
that Senate Bill One would bring cen
sorship to America as a living reality.
Actress Florence Eldridge, wife of
Frederick March, gave a dramatic
reading of excerpts from"The Re
quiem," a cycle of poems by Anna
Akhmatova commemorating Stalin's
victims. Rose Styron, journalist and
poet, discussed the situation of writers
and artists in Chile.
Amnesty International regularly in
vestigates the situation of reported
political prisoners. If the organization
finds that the person was jailed be
cause of his or her beliefs, then local
Amnesty International groups
"adopt" the prisoner. Such "adop
tion" means letters and gifts to the
prisoner and his family as well as con
stant bombardment of the authorities
with appeals both for improved jail
conditions for and release of the pris
oner. Over the years, the organization
has helped free more than 13,000 pris
oners and has improved the conditions
of many thousands more.

day." The 250 people gathered last
Thursday evening in a rented hall on
the San Francisco waterfront roared
with laughter and applause.
A few moments later they were sob
erly listening to a mournful tale of tor
ture and imprisonment. Between the
emotional poles of the satirical wit of
Art Buchwald and grisly, real-life
anecdotes, this Amnesty International
benefit was paying homage to jailed
writers, artists and journalists around
the world.
Amnesty International is a
London-based group that attempts to
mobilize pressure to free political
prisoners around the world. Amnesty
International is often mistaken for one

of the groups working on amnesty for
those who ran afoul of the military dur
ing the Vietnam War. But Amnesty In
ternational was founded in 1961 with
"the different and broader aim of per
sistently pestering governments on
behalf of persons imprisoned solely for
their beliefs.
For example, when Leonid
Flyushch, a mathematician and politi
cal dissident released in January from
a Soviet mental hospital, spoke to
news reporters in Paris this month, he
thanked Amnesty International as one
of the organizations that helped obtain
his release.
The San Francisco benefit focused
on artists and literary figures who were
behind bars. San Francisco's Art
Hoppe, who writes a syndicated col
umn of political satire, introduced his

Washington-based competitor
Buchwald. Hoppe spoke at length sar
donically praising the folksy, primi
tive, corny flavor that writing from
Washington gives to Buchwald's col
umns. Unsophisticated Washington
was contrasted with cosmopolitan San
Francisco.
Hoppe also had some imaginative
variations on the pronunciation of
Buchwald's name in the course of the
introduction. Hoppe asked how many
in the audience read Buchwald's col
umn in the Milpitas newspaper (since
it doesn't run in the San Francisco

Chronicle or Examiner). Hoppe
wound up by gleefully calling
Buchwald, "the Albert Morch of
Washington, D.C.," thereby managing
to twit both Buchwald and the
Examiner's society columnist.
Buchwald, the evening's master of
ceremonies, then told his audience
that the life of a political satirist was
becoming increasingly difficult. "It
used to be that we wrote the funny
stuff," he said, "and the government
played it straight." Buchwald then
followed with a series of jokes about
such absurdities as Marlon Brando's
gift of heavily mortgaged land to the
Indians and the ClA's plot to depilate
Castro's beard.
Buchwald went on to note that meet
ings on political topics are not legal in
many countries. Political satire is
treated as a crime against the integrity
of the state, a libel upon government
officials, and a subversive act under
mining the public order.
Norman Lear, creator of "All in the
Family," "Maude," and "Good
Times," said that Americans don't of
ten see censorship and imprisonment
of domestic writers. But Lear warned
that Senate Bill One would bring cen
sorship to America as a living reality.
Actress Florence Eldridge, wife of
Frederick March, gave a dramatic
reading of excerpts from"The Re
quiem," a cycle of poems by Anna
Akhmatova commemorating Stalin's
victims. Rose Styron, journalist and
poet, discussed the situation of writers
and artists in Chile.
Amnesty International regularly in
vestigates the situation of reported
political prisoners. If the organization
finds that the person was jailed be
cause of his or her beliefs, then local
Amnesty International groups
"adopt" the prisoner. Such "adop
tion" means letters and gifts to the
prisoner and his family as well as con
stant bombardment of the authorities
with appeals both for improved jail
conditions for and release of the pris
oner. Over the years, the organization
has helped free more than 13,000 pris
oners and has improved the conditions
of many thousands more.
