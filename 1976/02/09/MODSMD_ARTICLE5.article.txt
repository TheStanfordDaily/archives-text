# TAs aid grad students with teaching program
## 
### Jim Raup 
A group of Stanford teaching assis
tants is trying to help graduate stu
dents who aren't satisfied with the
University's research-oriented
graduate education learn how to
teach.
The group, headed by Jon Reider, a
terminal graduate student in social
theory, consists mainly of fourth and
fifth year grad students from a wide
variety of departments. The members
have a common interest in teaching, an
area they feel Stanford neglects, ac
cording to Reider.
Graduate programs here have a
good record of graduating superior re
searchers, however, Reider said. "The
University has been historically very
backward in teaching teaching."
Unlike many other universities,
Stanford has no separate University
policy to deal with teaching, leaving
that responsibility to the individual
departments. Reider said that while
some departments have been very at
tentive to their TAs. noting especially
the computer science and English de
partments, most ignore their graduate
assistants.
Reider's group is arranging semi
nars and workshops for TAs. The
group's activities are funded by the
Danforth Foundation, an affiliate of
Ralston Purina which is interested
in college teaching.
Improve teaching
The funds are channeled through
the Center for Teaching and Learning,
a Stanford-based program headed by
Comparative Literature Prof. David
Halliburton. The Center was de
veloped to "help improve teaching in
Bay Area colleges," he said.
One of the Center's major aims is to
help new teachers. Reider and other

grad students approached Halliburton
last spring with some ideas for work
shops to help TAs. The group has been
responsible for the Center's new
teacher program since. "The TAs
know better than anyone else what
they need," said Halliburton.
What the TAs need is instruction,
according to Reider. Most of the good
teachers that graduate from Stanford
are naturally talented, he added. "The
average person probably tries very
hard but doesn't know where to start.
Nobody has ever told him or her not to
stand in front of the blackboard or to
write legibly."
Three workshops
Already this quarter. Reider's group
has organized three workshops. One
was concerned with escaping graduate
school pressures and another dealt
with techniques for leading discus
sions. The third workshop, held last
Friday and Saturday at the Stanford
Center for Research and Development
in Teaching (SCRDT), was a video tape
workshop known as microteaching.
Graduate students spoke for 10
minutes on a subject of their own
choice in front of several students, a
videotape camera, and an outside con
sultant who critiqued their presenta
tion. Student response to the program
has been good. Reider noted.
Next workshop
The next workshop will be held in
the Florence Moore main lounge, Feb.
27. It will be entitled "How to Give
Lectures," and will be conducted by
Assoc. Political Science I'rof. Robert
Keohane and Physics Prof. Dirk
Walecka.
The Danforth foundation will in
crease its funding to the Center next
vear.

Improve teaching
The funds are channeled through
the Center for Teaching and Learning,
a Stanford-based program headed by
Comparative Literature Prof. David
Halliburton. The Center was de
veloped to "help improve teaching in
Bay Area colleges," he said.
One of the Center's major aims is to
help new teachers. Reider and other

grad students approached Halliburton
last spring with some ideas for work
shops to help TAs. The group has been
responsible for the Center's new
teacher program since. "The TAs
know better than anyone else what
they need," said Halliburton.
What the TAs need is instruction,
according to Reider. Most of the good
teachers that graduate from Stanford
are naturally talented, he added. "The
average person probably tries very
hard but doesn't know where to start.
Nobody has ever told him or her not to
stand in front of the blackboard or to
write legibly."
Three workshops
Already this quarter. Reider's group
has organized three workshops. One
was concerned with escaping graduate
school pressures and another dealt
with techniques for leading discus
sions. The third workshop, held last
Friday and Saturday at the Stanford
Center for Research and Development
in Teaching (SCRDT), was a video tape
workshop known as microteaching.
Graduate students spoke for 10
minutes on a subject of their own
choice in front of several students, a
videotape camera, and an outside con
sultant who critiqued their presenta
tion. Student response to the program
has been good. Reider noted.
Next workshop
The next workshop will be held in
the Florence Moore main lounge, Feb.
27. It will be entitled "How to Give
Lectures," and will be conducted by
Assoc. Political Science I'rof. Robert
Keohane and Physics Prof. Dirk
Walecka.
The Danforth foundation will in
crease its funding to the Center next
vear.
A group of Stanford teaching assis
tants is trying to help graduate stu
dents who aren't satisfied with the
University's research-oriented
graduate education learn how to
teach.
The group, headed by Jon Reider, a
terminal graduate student in social
theory, consists mainly of fourth and
fifth year grad students from a wide
variety of departments. The members
have a common interest in teaching, an
area they feel Stanford neglects, ac
cording to Reider.
Graduate programs here have a
good record of graduating superior re
searchers, however, Reider said. "The
University has been historically very
backward in teaching teaching."
Unlike many other universities,
Stanford has no separate University
policy to deal with teaching, leaving
that responsibility to the individual
departments. Reider said that while
some departments have been very at
tentive to their TAs. noting especially
the computer science and English de
partments, most ignore their graduate
assistants.
Reider's group is arranging semi
nars and workshops for TAs. The
group's activities are funded by the
Danforth Foundation, an affiliate of
Ralston Purina which is interested
in college teaching.
