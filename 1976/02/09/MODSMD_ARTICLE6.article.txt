# Galaxy game cult throngs to contest

"I must have put $25 in that damn
machine!" complained one stu
dent. "I spend at least $2.50 a week
on it." another said. That "damn
machine" is Galaxy, a computer
space game built by Bill Pitts, a
Stanford alumnus.
At the behest of regular Galaxy
players, Pitts sponsored a Galaxy
contest yesterday in the Stanford
Coffee House to reward his cult of
followers, most of whom are male
and of high school age.
The top seven winners received
free games for the rest of the after
noon. "I recognize a lot of these
(players) as being here frequently
. . . they're all hooked," commented
Pitts. "They don't need any other
incentive."
The winner of the 3Vj hour after
noon contest was Dave Wilcox. 16.
Wilcox said he plays the game
twice a week. "I used to play more,
but school got in the way."
Second place winner John
Rosenberg complained, "Wilcox
gets all the glory. I usually beat him.
he was just lucky this time."
Greg White of Palo Alto said he
plays five or six times a week. He
justified his obsession with the
game saying. "I've got a job. what
else would I spend my money on?"
It's like jousting, you just get in
there and kill."

Pitts, who graduated in 1968, has
always been interested in computer
science. "I majored in statistics, but
it was just a front. At the time, Stan
ford didn't have a computer science
major. I spent most of my time at the
Artificial Intelligence Center." It
was there that Pitts first got the idea
for Galaxy.
The game is based on a 1960
computer program, but it was not
until 1970 that there was a compu
ter small enough and powerful
enough to make construction of the
machines economically feasible.
According to Pitts, the machines
cost $20,000 each, which doesn't
include the cost of the labor that
went into each machine. Pitts esti
mates that the two machines in the
Coffee House gross approximately
$ 1300 per month.
"The Coffee House gets 20 per
cent of this," Pitts added. "It's im
portant to pick your place carefully.
This (Coffee House) seems to offer
the ideal atmosphere."
Pitts has one other machine in a
San Jose comic art shop. "It seems
to be doing pretty well. The two at
the Coffee House have already paid
for themselves."
Pitts claims that the overhead is
relatively low. "When they break, I
can usually fix them. If I can't, well,
it can run as hieh as $500 or $600."

GALACTIC JOUST —Two computerized frames simulating battles in outer
space between two rocket ships gross about $1300 a month in the Stanford
Coffee House. The machines are the idea of Stanford alumnus Bill Pitts and
cost $20,000 in parts alone.
