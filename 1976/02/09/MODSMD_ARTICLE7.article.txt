# Construction hirings biased

A tour of the Stanford campus
will reveal considerable con
struction underway. A further
review of the labor forces on
these projects will show very
few, if any, minorities.
Plans are being made for addi
tional construction and the same
injustices in employment will
continue unless Stanford insists
contractors implement effective
affirmative action programs.
In replying to this concern, the
position of theadministration is:
—Stanford has no authority
over contractors;
—a "little friendly persua
sion" has to be used;
—seniority in unions is a prob
lem adversely affecting affirma
tive action;
—equal employment is dif
ficult unless there are "good
times";
—Stanford is satisfactorily
monitoring and enforcing affir
mative action on construction
projects.
No control
The administration's argu
ment that Stanford has no con
trol over its own funds and the
firms with which it contracts is
erroneous. For example, if the
University can refuse to contract
or declare a breach of contract
with a firm because of poor qual
ity performance, then it can cer
tainly do so where affirmative
action is concerned.
It is neglectful for the Univer
sity to believe it can jse
"friendly persuasion" while
there are admittedly trade un
ions with positions ranging from
apathy (at best) to open (but hon
est) hostility. (It could be that

contractors and unions are tak
ing their cues from the Universi
ty's own internal hiring prac
tices.)
The University is not man
ifesting true support of affirma
tive action if it allows seniority
in trade unions to go unchal
lenged when such a system re
sults in the exclusion of any
class of people.
And if equal employment can
only be achieved in "good
times," there is no need for an
affirmative action program.
Majority workers should have
the same opportunity to be un
employed as minorities.
Sufficient manning
Lastly, if there is an event or
operation of import to an organi
zation, chances are there will be
manning assigned sufficient
enough to ensure the task is done
and done efficiently. Affirmative
action on construction contracts
has no such manning, in spite of
the fact a full time coordinator
was approved by a prior ad
ministration.
For the University to know
ingly continue construction in
light of the above can be viewed
as willful financing of racism in
employment. Moreover, to con
tinue to vocalize a program or
commitment it does not carry
out is grossly unfair to the
minority community.
That community has an obli
gation to bring this to the Uni
versity's attention. As the saying
goes, ths University should "put
its money where its mouth is."
