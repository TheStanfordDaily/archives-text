# Josh's message merits publicity

Ken Carlson

I am writing in response to
Ben Brown's Feb. 5 Daily letter
and to similar comments others
have made about Josh.
First of all, I would like to
apologize on behalf of the com
mittee to anyone who feels seri
ously offended by the advertis
ing used. We are not out to be
obnoxious or to offend people,
but only to be sure as many stu
dents as possible know about a
lecture series on topics we feel
are very relevant to student life.
Bast experience shows that
many campus events pass by re
latively unnoticed because most
students never hear about them
ahead of time; we want to try to
prevent that in this instance.
Second, I have noticed many
students tend to judge Christian
groups by a different standard
than they use for other campus
groups. Many other groups con
duct equally vigorous publicity
campaigns without ever being
accused of "vandalism" or of an
"abomination."
I haven't heard too many
people label the Alliance for
Radical Change or the United
Farm Workers as "the lunatic
fringe." I am not speaking in
criticism of these groups, but
rather to point out that we. along
with most of the Stanford com
munity. allow them the right to
speak out for vital changes they

are convinced are necessary.
We simply ask the right to do
the same.
We believe biblical Christian
ity offers a viable alternative to
other lifestyles offered by our
society. We ask that people lis
ten to what Josh has to say before
they put him down as some sort
of nut.
Intelligent criticism is the
product of an open-minded wil
lingness to examine the facts,
not of ungrounded emotional
reactionism. You might be sur
prised to learn Josh McDowell
spends literally hundreds of
hours doing academic (not bibli
cal) research before he puts to
gether a talk on any subject.
Admittedly, there are some
who speak in the name of Christ
ianity but are highly emotional
and irrational. But it is com
pletely unreasonable to con
clude that all who call them
selves Christians are like that.
We are simply requesting the
chance to be heard by those who
care to listen to what we have to
say. We think you will find that
most Christians are reasonable
people who have some fairly
good reasons for believing what
they do.
