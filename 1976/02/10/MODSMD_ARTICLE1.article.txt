# University reprimands Pribram; secretary angry about 'non-action'
##

Psychiatry and Psychology Prof.
Karl Pribram has been placed on two
year probation by the University and
has agreed to a $3000 cut in his salary
this year as a result of his alleged Oct.
29 beating of his former personal sec
retary.
lames Siena, legal adviser to the
President, in a letter to the secretary,
Barbara Honegger, said, "Professor
Pribram has agreed that he shall be on
probation for two years from the date
of the incident."
If during this probation period,
"there is a finding that Professor Prib
ram has struck a member of the Uni
versity, or anyone on campus, it might
be cause for his dismissal," Siena con
tinued.
Siena later said, "No further action
will be taken (by the University)
against Dr. Pribram as a result of the
Oct. 29 incident . . . Pribram's status
and tenure in the University are not

affected in any way."
Honegger said she will continue
with legal action against Pribram be
cause University action is "grossly in
appropriate" in light of the charges she
has brought against him.
'Non-action'
"I consider a $3000 fine and two
years probation non-action," she said.
"The fine is nothing more than a slap
on the hand and does nothing to pro
tect the community against future at
tacks by Pribram."
Honegger's attorney, Jim Wolpman,
blasted the University's action, calling
it "a lot of baloney" and saying it
"means nothing."
Wolpman said a more stringent
probationary period should be im
plemented which would place Prib
ram under direct daily supervision
and would require that all people
working under him be informed of his
"temper tantrums."

Siena said YVolpman "is entitled to
his opinion in that matter."
As for requiring people working
under Pribram to be informed, Siena
said "that's a management question
which will be worked out. It's under
consideration now."
Wolpman accused the University of
applying a double standard in Honeg
ger's case.
"If a worker had struck his foreman,
he would be fired without delay," he
said. "But because Pribram's a big
name, the University is willing to treat
him better. It appears as if the Univer
sity has sold out one of its employes for
the protection of a big name and a lot of
grant money."
'Leaping to conclusions'
Siena said "Each case is judged on
its facts. Wolpman is leaping to con
clusions."
As a result of the University's handl
ing of Honegger's case, Wolpman said
he plans to "move ahead earnestly"
with legal action against Pribram.
In addition toHonegger's four-count
civil suit filed against Pribram on Dec.
19, two grievances have been filed in
compliance with University grievance
procedures.
One grievance deals directly with
the alleged assault and battery. The
other asks for compensation for back
pay Honegger claims Pribram owes
her.
Outcome 'unimportant'
Siena said the University would take
no further disciplinary action against
Pribram regardless of the outcome of
the civil suit or the grievance hearing
for compensation of back pay.
Commenting on the grievance for
the alleged assault and battery,
Siena said, "There is a faculty and

Board of Trustees approved procedure
for disciplining faculty which
preempts any arbitrator's decision."
Siena said since Pribram has agreed
to follow the University's procedure,
no arbitrator's ruling can affect him.
"Nothing can be done against him
personally without following the ap
proved statement on faculty discip
line, and that agreement has been
reached," Siena said.
The grievance hearing to decide
whether Honegger is due compensa
tion began two weeks ago. Linda
Heider, another of Pribram's former
secretaries, is expected to testify at the
hearing Thursday.

Wolpman said a more stringent
probationary period should be im
plemented which would place Prib
ram under direct daily supervision
and would require that all people
working under him be informed of his
"temper tantrums."

Siena said YVolpman "is entitled to
his opinion in that matter."
As for requiring people working
under Pribram to be informed, Siena
said "that's a management question
which will be worked out. It's under
consideration now."
Wolpman accused the University of
applying a double standard in Honeg
ger's case.
"If a worker had struck his foreman,
he would be fired without delay," he
said. "But because Pribram's a big
name, the University is willing to treat
him better. It appears as if the Univer
sity has sold out one of its employes for
the protection of a big name and a lot of
grant money."
'Leaping to conclusions'
Siena said "Each case is judged on
its facts. Wolpman is leaping to con
clusions."
As a result of the University's handl
ing of Honegger's case, Wolpman said
he plans to "move ahead earnestly"
with legal action against Pribram.
In addition toHonegger's four-count
civil suit filed against Pribram on Dec.
19, two grievances have been filed in
compliance with University grievance
procedures.
One grievance deals directly with
the alleged assault and battery. The
other asks for compensation for back
pay Honegger claims Pribram owes
her.
Outcome 'unimportant'
Siena said the University would take
no further disciplinary action against
Pribram regardless of the outcome of
the civil suit or the grievance hearing
for compensation of back pay.
Commenting on the grievance for
the alleged assault and battery,
Siena said, "There is a faculty and

Board of Trustees approved procedure
for disciplining faculty which
preempts any arbitrator's decision."
Siena said since Pribram has agreed
to follow the University's procedure,
no arbitrator's ruling can affect him.
"Nothing can be done against him
personally without following the ap
proved statement on faculty discip
line, and that agreement has been
reached," Siena said.
The grievance hearing to decide
whether Honegger is due compensa
tion began two weeks ago. Linda
Heider, another of Pribram's former
secretaries, is expected to testify at the
hearing Thursday.

REPRIMANDED—PsychoIogy and Psychiatry Prof. Karl Pribram is being
reprimanded by the University as a result of his alleged Oct. 29 beating of his
former secretary. He has accepted two years on University probation and a
$3000 cut in his salary this year. The secretary is not satisfied with the
University's action.
Psychiatry and Psychology Prof.
Karl Pribram has been placed on two
year probation by the University and
has agreed to a $3000 cut in his salary
this year as a result of his alleged Oct.
29 beating of his former personal sec
retary.
lames Siena, legal adviser to the
President, in a letter to the secretary,
Barbara Honegger, said, "Professor
Pribram has agreed that he shall be on
probation for two years from the date
of the incident."
If during this probation period,
"there is a finding that Professor Prib

be cause for his dismissal," Siena con
tinued.

has brought against him.
'Non-action'
"I consider a $3000 fine and two
years probation non-action," she said.
"The fine is nothing more than a slap
on the hand and does nothing to pro

Honegger's attorney, Jim Wolpman,
blasted the University's action, calling
it "a lot of baloney" and saying it
"means nothing."
