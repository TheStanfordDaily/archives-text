# Tenure critics raise bogus issues
## 
### 
Tenure denials, once largely an un
noticed part of academic life here, have dur
ing the past two years provided the occasion
for dire warnings by many students that the
administration is losing its concern for un
dergraduate education.
Unfortunately, critics of the tenure pro
cess have generally attacked the wrong as
pects of the procedure, ignoring those ele
ments of it that most need reform.
Foes of the current procedure argue that
too much attention is given to research vis a
vis teaching in tenure decisions. They cite
the recent denials of tenure to Jerry Irish of
religious studies and Anne McMahon of
sociology, both winners of the Gores Award
for Excellence in Teaching, as cases in
point.
Former students of classicist Ronald Mel
lor and chemist Leonard Stephenson also
have contended that too little attention was
given to their superior teaching qualities
when they were denied tenure last year.
Such critics of the tenure process, how
ever, generally only perpetuate misconcep
tions about the tenure process.
Are careers jeopardized?
For example, Michael Closson in his Feb.
3 Daily column, argued that junior profes
sors who spend too much time on teaching
are placing their academic careers in
jeopardy.
According to Closson, the administra
tion's emphasis on research encourages
"mediocre education" here because it
makes junior faculty afraid to spend much
time with undergraduates.
Closson's arguments, however, are in
valid,becauselike all defenders of fired pro
fessors, he fails to consider that it might be
possible for an instructor to spend a large
amount of time on both research and teach
ing.
No critic of the current tenure procedure
has ever pointed out that many assistant
professors who have received tenure are ex
cellent teachers and have devoted much
time to their students.
They also don't mention that some of the
most distinguished senior faculty members
here manage to publish much material
while carrying heavy teaching loads and

participating freely in various phases of un
dergraduate education.
Closson seems to imply that the most
productive faculty members are hermitic
ogres who barricade themselves in research
cells and don't condescend to speak to un
dergraduates. This view is unfair to the
the vast majority ot professors.
Closson might argue that he is only refer
ring to the danger that assistant professors
who are struggling to receive tenure will
ignore students. But since a tenured profes-

sor should — and usually does — publish as
much after he gets tenure as before, this
argument would be irrelevant.
The primary failing of Closson and other
critics of tenure is that they ignore the ex
traordinary amount of time in which a pro
fessor is allowed to work before he is consi
dered for tenure.
Tenure decisions usually are not made for
between six to eight years after an assistant
professor is hired. Irish, for example, taught
at Stanford for eight years before he was
considered for tenure. During that time, he
published only a few articles and no scho
larly books.
Certainly even the best teacher could find
time during eight years to conduct research
and write scholarly material.
Assistant professors rarely teach more
than four courses a year and are often given
time off on sabbatical. This clearly allows
ample time for research if a professor really
wants to do any.
Signs of lassitude
If a professor has not produced anything
in eight years, he probably never will. And
if he does not contribute any new informa
tion to the field of scholarship, his value as a
teacher is likely to decline since he will

have no special knowledge to imparl to hif
students.
In their column of Feb. 6, Mike Herman
and Barbara Glenn perpetuated yet another
misconception about the tenure process
here when they stated that the University
currently is looking primarily at the quan
tity of material published and is ignoring
the quality.
This is not true. Many professors have
been given tenure after they have written
relatively little because the quality of their
publication was so high. In contrast, Keith
Lumsden, formerly an assistant professor in
the Graduate School of Business, was de
nied tenure last year even though he h<6
published nearly a dozen books because the
scholarly content of the books was deemed
low.
In every tenure deliberation, scholars in
the tenure candidate's field from outside the
University are asked to assess the quality of
a candidate's work.
By focusing their attention on false is<
sues, critics of the tenure process have de
tracted attention from those phases of the
process that genuine need reform.
Tenure process flaws
For example, persons denied tenure are
usually not given detailed enough explana
tions of what was wrong with their records.
Furthermore, tenure criteria are entirely tot
vague.
In the cause of McMahon, it is legitimate
to ask whether or not her department gave
enough consideration to the fact that much
of her research was long-term in its scope
and did not yield immediate publication.
Departments and the Appointments and
Promotions Gommittee should explain their
attitudes toward long-term research.
But whatever the failings of the tenure
process, because of budgetary restrictions,
only about 30 percent of the assistant pro
fessors here can receive tenure. This means
that only the best teachers and researchers
can be promoted. Gritics of the tenure pro.
cess should not expect professors who neg
lect research to be rewarded with tenure.
