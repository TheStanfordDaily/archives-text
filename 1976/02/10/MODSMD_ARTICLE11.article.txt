# Letters: semesters, computer theme house

With great regret and rising
anger I read of President Ly
man's recent decision to disre
gard t he recommendations of t he
Committee on the Reform and
Renewal of L.iberal Education at
Stanford report concerning a re
turn to the semester system here.
Such cavalier disdain for the de
sires of a large segment of the
academic community is not fit
ting for its administering per
sonnel.
The quarter system as it exists
here is only rarely found outside
of California. This special form
of insanity looses a barrage of
testing on the student body
every five weeks. No serious
educator actually believes this
system can be conducive to any
thing other than input/output,
lecturing/testing. But then of
course, no serious educator de
signed it.
There is no pause for contem
plation or in-depth examination
of any topic, much less a creative
synthesis of several topics. It's as
if the Lymans of the world de
cided to see if an educational
analogy could be drawn to pop
culture.
That is, the quarter system
forces students to partake vicari
ously of assorted cheap thrills
with no real commitment. All of
this is done in the name of know
ledge under the guise of degree
accreditation.
Some departments and some
courses are indeed amenable to a
ten week format. But often pro
fessors simply cram their 16
week lecture notes into the op
pressive quarter courses we
neither desire nor accept.
This frenetic time structure
must cease or the ousuit of

knowledge itself will suffer. Fa
culty members and students
who struggle under the present
system must recognize the need
to band together to demand
necessary changes in this all
i mportant aspect of the quality of
life here.
Our education and our lives
will not fit exaggerated modular
constraints such as the quarter
system.

Computer theme house
Editor:
The Jan. 29 Daily letter's
proposition for a computer
theme house has merit and
should be taken seriously. How
ever, "HAL" also raises a sour
note.
Many computer people are to
tally involved in computing.
Their hours, meals, friends and
activities are heavily influenced
by their computing interest.
A computer theme house
could give a student a feeling for
this total involvement. A nuc
leus for a theme would appear to
exist in Roble — in fact, a Com
puter Club is well along in the
formative stages.
A computer theme house resi
dent would not just discuss
FORTRAN, APL, ALGOL and
LISP or debate only TENEX vs.
VS. With support and direction
it could make contributions in
areas such as the uses/abuses of
computers in the education pro
cess; legal and social implica
tions of computerization; pri
vacy and computer records; pro
fessional standards for comput
ing personnel.
A most distressing situation
now exists. Most Stanford stu

dents would not consider break
ing intoCowell or the Registrar's
Office, or forging checks or hold
ing up Stanford Shell, in order to
obtain information or funds.

Because homosexuality is an

issue seldom discussed on any
higher level than cheap graffiti
or gossip, the Daily is to be
highly commended on the brave
intellectual and humanitarian
step forward taken with the Feb.
5 Thursday. It takes a lot to over
come such fears, and the know
ledge gained is not only indi
vidually freeing, but can enable
us to develop a richer, more ful-

filling society in which the
human race may attain its full
capacity of creative ability. •
Thanks should go to the Daily
staff for helping the Stanford
community talk openly about a
genuine human phenomenon
with empathy, integrity and in
tellect.

Stanford report concerning a re
turn to the semester system here.
Such cavalier disdain for the de
sires of a large segment of the
academic community is not fit
ting for its administering per
sonnel.
The quarter system as it exists
here is only rarely found outside
of California. This special form
of insanity looses a barrage of
testing on the student body
every five weeks. No serious
educator actually believes this
system can be conducive to any
thing other than input/output,
lecturing/testing. But then of
course, no serious educator de
signed it.
There is no pause for contem
plation or in-depth examination
of any topic, much less a creative
synthesis of several topics. It's as
if the Lymans of the world de
cided to see if an educational
analogy could be drawn to pop
culture.
That is, the quarter system
forces students to partake vicari
ously of assorted cheap thrills
with no real commitment. All of
this is done in the name of know
ledge under the guise of degree
accreditation.
Some departments and some
courses are indeed amenable to a
ten week format. But often pro
fessors simply cram their 16
week lecture notes into the op
pressive quarter courses we
neither desire nor accept.
This frenetic time structure
must cease or the ousuit of

knowledge itself will suffer. Fa
culty members and students
who struggle under the present
system must recognize the need
to band together to demand
necessary changes in this all
i mportant aspect of the quality of
life here.
Our education and our lives
will not fit exaggerated modular
constraints such as the quarter
system.

Computer theme house
Editor:
The Jan. 29 Daily letter's
proposition for a computer
theme house has merit and
should be taken seriously. How
ever, "HAL" also raises a sour
note.
Many computer people are to
tally involved in computing.
Their hours, meals, friends and
activities are heavily influenced
by their computing interest.
A computer theme house
could give a student a feeling for
this total involvement. A nuc
leus for a theme would appear to
exist in Roble — in fact, a Com
puter Club is well along in the
formative stages.
A computer theme house resi
dent would not just discuss
FORTRAN, APL, ALGOL and
LISP or debate only TENEX vs.
VS. With support and direction
it could make contributions in
areas such as the uses/abuses of
computers in the education pro
cess; legal and social implica
tions of computerization; pri
vacy and computer records; pro
fessional standards for comput
ing personnel.
A most distressing situation
now exists. Most Stanford stu

dents would not consider break
ing intoCowell or the Registrar's
Office, or forging checks or hold
ing up Stanford Shell, in order to
obtain information or funds.

Because homosexuality is an

issue seldom discussed on any
higher level than cheap graffiti
or gossip, the Daily is to be
highly commended on the brave
intellectual and humanitarian
step forward taken with the Feb.
5 Thursday. It takes a lot to over
come such fears, and the know
ledge gained is not only indi
vidually freeing, but can enable
us to develop a richer, more ful-

filling society in which the
human race may attain its full
capacity of creative ability. •
Thanks should go to the Daily
staff for helping the Stanford
community talk openly about a
genuine human phenomenon
with empathy, integrity and in
