# Moynihan's bumblings

### 
Michael Skinner

The antics of former U.N. delegate Daniel
Moynihan within and without the halls of that
organization present at best a tangle of errors.
Moynihan had seen fit to give rise to caustic
mouthings against the black African nations and
other third-world nations. He called ldi Amin a
"racist murderer" and said it was "no accident"
Amin was head of the Organization of Africa Un
ity.
Moynihan also strongly denounced the anti-
Zionist resolution in terms some official U.N. and
U.S. sources have said, "made things worse."
Moynihan's complete miscomprehension of
the problems of relations with African states is
clearly demonstrated. He himself has said, "In the
United Nations today, thereare in the range of two
dozen democracies left; totalitarian communist
regimes and assorted ancient and modern de
spotisms make up all the rest. Nothing so unites
these nations as the conviction that their success
ultimately depends on our failure."
Moynihan then turned around and attacked
these governments, like a beast at bay.
Understand their position
He does not try to work with the African na
tions. to co-operate with them, or to understand
their position. And his mistake with the Africans
was considered by some State Department offi
cials to be a "mortal" one.
It had been no secret the nations in the OAIJ
resented having Amin as their leader; under his

reign, 25,000-250,000 Ugandans have been
slaughtered. But Moynihan's vicious attack on
Amin and the Africans states forced them to unite
and to support Amin.
Moynihan's humbling was eventually backed'
by Kissinger and Ford, but some souces on Kis
singer's staff say Kissinger bad very strong ap
prehensions. One wonders, in viewing the little
game within the Administration, whether some
undercover Rockefeller-type dumping manuvers
might not have transpired.
No support
When British ambassador Ivor Richard, with
the tacit approval of then Prime Minister Harold
Wilson, metaphorically denounced Moynihan in
the U.N. General Assembly, no one rose on behalf
of Moynihan. And the White House did not pro
vide Moynihan much encouragement.
Finally, Ford stopped Moynihan from resign
ing just 10 minutes before Moynihan was to have
held a press conference telling of his resignation.
Now. however. Moynihan has resigned. He
complained the State Department undercut his
position through selective leaks and nonsupport
of his position in the United Nations.
It would seem at least part of the Administra
tion — perhaps only the Kissinger part — found
Moynihan to be too hot to handle and con
sequently dropped him.

ing just 10 minutes before Moynihan was to have
held a press conference telling of his resignation.
Now. however. Moynihan has resigned. He
complained the State Department undercut his
position through selective leaks and nonsupport
of his position in the United Nations.
It would seem at least part of the Administra
tion — perhaps only the Kissinger part — found
Moynihan to be too hot to handle and con
sequently dropped him.

The antics of former U.N. delegate Daniel
Moynihan within and without the halls of that
organization present at best a tangle of errors.
Moynihan had seen fit to give rise to caustic
mouthings against the black African nations and
other third-world nations. He called ldi Amin a
"racist murderer" and said it was "no accident"
Amin was head of the Organization of Africa Un
ity.
Moynihan also strongly denounced the anti-
Zionist resolution in terms some official U.N. and
U.S. sources have said, "made things worse."
Moynihan's complete miscomprehension of
the problems of relations with African states is
clearly demonstrated. He himself has said, "In the
United Nations today, thereare in the range of two
dozen democracies left; totalitarian communist
regimes and assorted ancient and modern de
spotisms make up all the rest. Nothing so unites
these nations as the conviction that their success
ultimately depends on our failure."
Moynihan then turned around and attacked
these governments, like a beast at bay.
Understand their position
He does not try to work with the African na
tions. to co-operate with them, or to understand
their position. And his mistake with the Africans
was considered by some State Department offi
cials to be a "mortal" one.
It had been no secret the nations in the OAIJ
resented having Amin as their leader; under his

reign, 25,000-250,000 Ugandans have been
slaughtered. But Moynihan's vicious attack on
Amin and the Africans states forced them to unite
and to support Amin.
Moynihan's humbling was eventually backed'
by Kissinger and Ford, but some souces on Kis
singer's staff say Kissinger bad very strong ap
prehensions. One wonders, in viewing the little
game within the Administration, whether some
undercover Rockefeller-type dumping manuvers
might not have transpired.
No support
When British ambassador Ivor Richard, with
the tacit approval of then Prime Minister Harold
Wilson, metaphorically denounced Moynihan in
the U.N. General Assembly, no one rose on behalf
of Moynihan. And the White House did not pro
vide Moynihan much encouragement.
Finally, Ford stopped Moynihan from resign
ing just 10 minutes before Moynihan was to have
held a press conference telling of his resignation.
Now. however. Moynihan has resigned. He
complained the State Department undercut his
position through selective leaks and nonsupport
of his position in the United Nations.
