# Nuclear power: how safe is it?
## 
### 
By the Associated Press
New objections are being
raised about the safety of nuclear
power, and some of them are
coming from within the industry
that has been promoted as the
energy source of the future.
In recent days, Vermont's only
nuclear plant was closed; three
General Electric Co. nuclear en
gineers resigned, and the project
manager of a plant under con
struction in New York state res
igned — all because of safety
questions.
The shutdown of the $216
million Vermont Yankee Nuc
lear Power Corp. plant was or
dered Jan. 26 after computer
stress tests by CE, designer of the
540-megawatt plant, indicated
the reactor's safety system might
not stand the strain of an acci
dent.
Plant officials said that if the
system broke down, radioactive
stream would be released into
the plant building, but little
would escape outside.
However, Prof. Henry Ken
dall, a nuclear physicist at the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, said the result
would be "an accident on a scale
unknown to a peacetime na
tion," causing almost immediate
death for most of the 55,000
people who live withina 20-mile
radius of the Vermont plant.
Plant officials have acknow
ledged that no solution is in
sight to the structural design
problem.
Meanwhile, New England
utilities which bought from

Vermont Yankee, are spending
$250,000 per day for replace
ment electicity from more ex
pensive sources during the
winter season in which local
power consumption reaches its
peak.
The engineer who directed the
tests that resuted in the closure,
Richard Birdenbaugh, was one
ofthethreeGE nuclear engineers
who resigned last Monday from
the division of the company that
builds power plants.
Bridenbaugh said the Ver
mont tests helped convince him
that nuclear power is unsafe.
"The work I had done on the
containment study influenced
my decision. We have gone too
far, too fast."
Bridenbaugh, joined by the
other twoGE scientists in defect
ing from the nuclear industry,
called on Friday for an im
mediate review of the country's
50 nuclear power plants to see if
they are safe.
After their news conference
Friday, the men met with offi
cials of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, which is responsi
ble for regulating the nuclear in
dustry.
The NRC issued a statement
after the meeting saying the en
gineers' main objections seemed
to be philosophical in nature.
A three-year government
study of reactor safety released
late last year, found that the risks
of operating large nuclear reac
tors are "very low" compared to
other natural and manmade
risks.

Vermont Yankee, are spending
$250,000 per day for replace
ment electicity from more ex
pensive sources during the
winter season in which local
power consumption reaches its
peak.
The engineer who directed the
tests that resuted in the closure,
Richard Birdenbaugh, was one
ofthethreeGE nuclear engineers
who resigned last Monday from
the division of the company that
builds power plants.
Bridenbaugh said the Ver
mont tests helped convince him
that nuclear power is unsafe.
"The work I had done on the
containment study influenced
my decision. We have gone too
far, too fast."
Bridenbaugh, joined by the
other twoGE scientists in defect
ing from the nuclear industry,
called on Friday for an im
mediate review of the country's
50 nuclear power plants to see if
they are safe.
After their news conference
Friday, the men met with offi
cials of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, which is responsi
ble for regulating the nuclear in
dustry.
The NRC issued a statement
after the meeting saying the en
gineers' main objections seemed
to be philosophical in nature.
A three-year government
study of reactor safety released
late last year, found that the risks
of operating large nuclear reac
tors are "very low" compared to
other natural and manmade
risks.

New objections are being
raised about the safety of nuclear
power, and some of them are
coming from within the industry
that has been promoted as the
energy source of the future.
In recent days, Vermont's only
nuclear plant was closed; three
General Electric Co. nuclear en
gineers resigned, and the project
manager of a plant under con
struction in New York state res
igned — all because of safety
questions.
The shutdown of the $216
million Vermont Yankee Nuc
lear Power Corp. plant was or
dered Jan. 26 after computer
stress tests by CE, designer of the
540-megawatt plant, indicated
the reactor's safety system might
not stand the strain of an acci
dent.
Plant officials said that if the
system broke down, radioactive
stream would be released into
the plant building, but little
would escape outside.
However, Prof. Henry Ken
dall, a nuclear physicist at the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, said the result
would be "an accident on a scale
unknown to a peacetime na
tion," causing almost immediate
death for most of the 55,000
people who live withina 20-mile
radius of the Vermont plant.
Plant officials have acknow
ledged that no solution is in
sight to the structural design
problem.
Meanwhile, New England
utilities which bought from

Vermont Yankee, are spending
$250,000 per day for replace
ment electicity from more ex
pensive sources during the
winter season in which local
power consumption reaches its
peak.
