# East Asian religion examined
## Buddhism workshop 
### Bruce Kadden 
The Buddhism workshop is in
its second year of sharing East
Asian religious thought with
members of the community,
Asst. Religious Prof. Diana Paul,
faculty supervisor of the prog
ram said in an interview yester
day.
Sponsored jointly by the
Center for East Asian Studies
and the Religious Studies De
partment, seminars are held bi
weekly, attempting to get some
idea about the extent to which a
modern philosophical under
standing of Buddhism is possi
ble, according to Workshop Di
rector Peter Meic, a co-terminal
religious studies major.
Paul said that the workshop
has also sponsored weekend re
treats and is planning a celebra
tion for Buddha's birthday. The
Stanford group holds some joint
programs with UC-Berkeley,
which has a large group of per
sons interested in Buddhism,
Paul added.
She noted that the workshops
are designed to "appeal to a large
group of people with some in
terest in East Asian religion."
Asst. Religious Studies Prof.
Henry Levinson will present his
paper on "Nagarjuna's Notion of
Emptiness," today at 4:15 p.m.
in the Center of East Asian
Studies' Conference Room
(600-T).
Nagarjuna, a second century
Buddhist scholar, is the founder
of the Madhyamika school and
system of Buddhism which has
been described as the "central
philosophy of Buddhism." Paul

will respond to his paper.
Future workshops will be led
by Stephan Beyer a visiting Prof
at UC Berkeley (March 4 at 10
a.m.), a Zen Monk from the
community (April 8) and a Tibe
tan monk from the Ewam-
Chodan Institute in Berkeley.
Paul is currently teaching two

courses, Buddhist Sutras, a
graduate seminar, and the Role
of Woman in Buddhism. Next
quarter she will teach the
Buddhism survey course and
"Ch'an and Zen Buddhism,"
which may he televised to UC
Berkeley if arrangements can be
made.
