## 'Sequoia' provides mature poetry 
### Frank Hustace 
The winter issue of Sequoia, Stanford's
literary magazine, offers a beautifully il
lustrated collection of interesting poetry,
a thought-provoking interview with
novelist Alexander Theroux and a won
derfully conceived short story.
A subdued movement permeates much
of the material, principally the poetry,
giving this issuea more uniform flavoring
of authorial toneand overall mood than in
earlier issues of Sequoia.
However, this achievement paradoxi
cally becomes the issue's chief disap
pointment: with the mature poetry, this
pervading movement becomes richly ef
fective: when dealt with by the more
poorly crafted poems, the t n ne tends to
become overtaxed and often monotonous.
Basically, the problem narrows down
to one of style. Nearly all of the poems in
the issue are beautifully evocative and
show a conscious movement toward an
effective resolution. Yet, as a general rule,
they lack individually innovative styles,
the authors preferring to express their
ideas in carefully crafted, rather tradi
tional modes.
Juxta position
Several poems are excellent and func
tion wonderfully when approached sepa
rately, but unfortunately, these poems are
juxtaposed with other less polished
poems which deal with similar moods
and have closely related styles. By favor
ing a homogeneous stylistic evenness, the
poetic environment of the issue obscures
individual excellence and, eventually, it
becomes sluggish and heavy-handed.
This atmosphere is necessarily a reflec
tion of the poetic tastes of the editors
rather than the unavailability of stylisti
cally diverse materials. Caution and
selectivity, therefore is important to
maintain when reading Sequoia; it cer
tainly is the case here that the individual
elements are more effective and impor
tant than the larger whole they form.
In Homecoming by Tim Dekin, the nar
rator attempts to reunite himself with his
father and "to braid a severed bloodline
from lost threads." However, a strong
pridefulness mixes curiously with the
firm resolve to come to a final mutual

understanding as "we sit drinking to feel
the friendship we rehearse, refusing, till
we drop, to go to bed."
This mixture forms a pessimistic un
dercurrent as to the ultimate success of
the reunion and this arching tension bet
ween conflicting forces makes the poem
hauntingly beautiful.
Narrative voice
The narrative voice in David Barton's
Journal Entry is almost painful in its per
sonal intensity. To a certain extejit, the
poem fits its own final self-evaluation of
being "pathologically evasive, incurious
and cold." Yet, the introspective, self
pitying tone does not "maunder in the
dirt" as it might easily have done.
Instead, Barton's narrator belies his
own incurious self-condemnation by
being intensely preoccupied with mic
roscopic detail: the tiny dead ants in salt,
the flapping, wind-stripped shingles,the
rain hardening on the lawn. The tunnel
ing vision, first of winter, then of the self,
creates an intricate psychological self
portrait that is effective and compelling.
This Side of Mirrors by Dana Gioia is
intensely psychological as well, but it has
a completely different stylistic texture. In
this poem we do not get the feeling, as we
do with Barton, that we are surreptiti
ously intruding into a very private
psychological world. Rather, a dramatic
element at the beginning of the poem in
vites the reader inward.
Appeal
This experienced, almost didactic ap
peal maintains a distance from complete
self-consciousness and is handled well.
The poem counsels that withdrawal and
escape are infinitely more bearable than
having to face the halting measure of the
voice of reality and the capriciousness of
human love: "Both the wise and innocent
find in their elusive dreams gardens
greener than daylight grows."
Buzzard or California Redwood (both
titles are used), a short story by Susan
Benner is superb. Its clear, straightfor
ward style tells of the selfishness and
false assumptions shared by three people
involved in a love relationship, and
shows how the inner feelings petrify,
causing the outward relationship to

slowly rot away.
Benner blends an enjoyable simple and
unadorned prose style with a weaving
chronological progression to create be
lievable characters in a moving and pro
vocative story.
Small Hours and Old Photography, two
poems by Robert B. Shaw were radically
out of context, both in meaning and for
mative assumptions, from nearly every
other poem in the issue.
They are clever, excellently well
written, and operate on nothing less than
the firm conviction that language is a de
lightful tool which can and should be
manipulated 10 its lull humoristic effect.

While the subjects may seem rather banal,
the poems become a delightful respite
from the overly plodding, deeply
psychological mish-mash that surrounds
them.
An Interview with Alexander Theroux,
which was conducted in Cambridge by
Dana Gioia, is appealing in its honesty
and unpretentiousness. Theroux re
sponds widely to the well-selected ques
tions and his impressions and profes
sional convictions are interesting and en
gaging. Interviews with significant indi
viduals can be a sucessful addition to a
literary magazine and it is hoped that
Sequoiu will continue this practice.
