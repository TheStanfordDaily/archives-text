# Pilobolus: amazing, innovative dancers
## 
### Christine Sherry 
Philobolus. The word refers to a kind of
photophopic fungus.
It also, however, refers to an amazing
group of six young dancers who first
banded together as students at Dartmouth
to try to create a new, innovative ap
proach to dance-theater.
Their Friday evening performance at
Memorial Auditorium proved to an en
thusiastic packed house that six young
dancers not only could respond to the
challenge of opening up a whole new set
of possibilities in dance movement, but
that they could do so with arms tied be
hind backs and legs intertwined in ways
which seemed almost inhuman.
Intriguing style
Pilobolus' intriguing style seems based
on a kind of athletics; the dancers com
bine a tensile strength with an uncanny
fluidity of movement, and each one of
them has an extraordinary reserve of
strength and agility, much like that of a
highly trained gymnast.
Moreover, a large part of the choreog
raphy is reminiscent of gymnastics;
springy leaps, somersaults, and balances
occur over and over in the various pieces.
Yet the Piloboli are dancers, first and

foremost, and the dancing never lapses
into being merely a showcase for athletic
stunts. Pseudopodia for example, which
was choreographed and danced by
Jonathan Wolken, was perhaps the most
"gymnastic" of the works presented, yet
also one of the most "danced."
Constant stream
Volken combined a constant stream of
rolls, balances, and falls with a sense of
balance, grace and fluidity that is the
mark of a highly sensitive artist.
Most of the pieces performed were plot
less movement studies, involving an ex
tensive use of knots or huddles of dan
cers' bodies and a constant metamor
phosis of movement that always seemed
absolutely effortless.
The first untitled number was a bril
liant parody on sexual awakening and in
teraction. The duet, Alraune, was a quiet
mockery of the self-serious modern piece
attempting to evoke agony and pathos.
Wolklyndon explored every known
way of walking, from a jog to a strut to a
limp, in which the dancers incorporated
a number of offbeat endings to standard
visual gags.
Pilobolus bills itself as an "energy cir
cus" and indeed it is.
