## 
### Lori Matsukawa 
The Committee on Services to Stu
dents (COSS) will vote today on
whether the University should ban
employers who discriminate against
gays from using the Career Planning
and Placement Center (CPPC).
In a four-hour meeting last night,
seven of the nine committee members
worked on the final wording of the
four-part proposal that will be submit
ted to President Richard Lyman.
Three votes
COSS members will be casting three
votes each on three of the four sections
of the proposal, according to commit
tee member Leigh-Ann Mivasato. a
senior:
—first, whether to urge the Univer
sity not to discriminate against gays;
—second, whether to encourage
employers not to discriminate against
gays;
—third, whether to prohibit the use
of the CPPC by those employers who
say they do discriminate against gays.
A fourth section is an overview of
the function of the CPPC and does not
require a vote.
"Opinions (within the committee)
range along a scale of 'who's conserva
tive' and 'who isn't,' " said Miyasato.
Last night's meeting was "rather
technical," said student COSS
member Kric Hemel. "And no one was
trying to persuade anyone," he said.
However, Hemel agreed that "there
are differences of opinion within the
committee."
"Tired of talking"
"We're tired of talking about it."
said COSS Chairman Dan Poston. "We
hope to hash things out, though it's
difficult to tell how the vote will go."
The CPPC currently allows
employers to use its facility under the
provisions of Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 19R4 under which it is an
"unlawful employment practice for an
employer ... to fail or refuse to
hire . . . any individual . . . because of
such individual's race, color, religion,
sex or national origin."
No mention is made of sexual pre
ference.
"It will be a verv interesting vote."

said senior Paul Sobotka. "On some
points there are as many opinions as
there are members in the committee.
On others, there is complete unanim
ity, for example, on the title."
Sobotka said once the committee
votes on the proposal, it will be sent to
Lyman, a presidential committee or a
presidential sub-committee.
"No one will be hearing much more
of it (the proposal) before it goes before
President Lyman," said Sobotka.
