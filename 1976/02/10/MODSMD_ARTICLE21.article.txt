# Rock superstars highlight Bay Area weekend
## Bowie: no glitter 
### Ellan Cates 
David Bowie is the new Frank
Sinatra?! That's Bowie's goal (in
a Hailing Stone interview), but
Ole' Blue Eyes would never have
given the lacklustre perfor
mance Bowie gave Friday night.
Bowie proved conclusively
that his image has changed —
but not necessarily for the better.
Gone is the glitter king mounted
on a rocket-phallus. Enter the
new Bowie, the "thin white
duke," the title of his upcoming
biography.
Bowie's first hit "Changes"
seems to be his credo. From the
glitter of Diamond Dogs to the
more subdued Young Ameri
cans and just released Station
to-Stution album, we .can see
Bowie's metamorphasis.
Showmanship lost
But with this transformation
from the bizarre to the relatively
straight (for Bowie) he loses the
showmanship and gimmickry
that was so much of his appeal.
It's said that Howie doesn't
like San Francisco audiences,
and his concert at the Cow
Palace last weekend lent truth to
the rumor.
The concert started slowly,
with the surreal film Le Chien
Andalue as the opener, to the ir
ritation of the audience.
Finally Bowie appeared. Fit
ting into his new mood, the stage
had no props. Simply dressed,
he wore a black vest and pants
with a white flowing shirt. With
slicked back hair he definitely
had the look of a young Sinatra.
Glitter
Bowie opened with the title
song from his new album with
some heavy instrumentation.
Then playing lipservice to his
sequined and mascaraed male
and female glitter fans, he went
into a mediocre rendition of
"Suffragette City."
His decadent rock songs
seemed so incongruous with his
new suave image that Bowie
seemed bored, dampening much
of the crowd's enthusiasm.
Several times during the in
strumental, Bowie left the
stage. The old Bowie would have
been prancing and playing up to
the audience. Bowie is such an
incredibly supple and acrobatic
dancer, yet he didn't go into any
of his moves until half way
through the concert, during
"Fame," and then he danced
only briefly.

As Bowie gradually got into
his performance, so did the au
dience. The glitter king went
through his old songs; "1984,"
"Panic in Detroit," and "Five
Years" interspersing them with
songs from his new album, and
"Waiting for the Man" from a
yet-to-be-released album.
When Bowie did what has be
come his theme song
"Changes," he was almost nos
talgic, while at the same time
mocking himself, saying "how
the others must see me, the
faker" pointing to himself.
Bowie played for almost an
hour and a half, then left, until
the audience demanded three
encores. These last songs, "Re
bel, Rebel" and "Diamond
Dogs" were the highlight of the
concert.
Surprisingly, Bowie did not
do his AM top 40 single "Golden
Years" which may have been a
slap in the face to his newly ac
quired AM listeners or an at
tempt to be typically unpredict
able.
Bowie wants the mass appeal
of Frank Sinatra, but he'll first
have to overcome his obvious
boredom and contempt for his
fans. If this is the new Bowie, I
like the old one better.

with a white flowing shirt. With
slicked back hair he definitely
had the look of a young Sinatra.
Glitter
Bowie opened with the title
song from his new album with
some heavy instrumentation.
Then playing lipservice to his
sequined and mascaraed male
and female glitter fans, he went
into a mediocre rendition of
"Suffragette City."
His decadent rock songs
seemed so incongruous with his
new suave image that Bowie
seemed bored, dampening much
of the crowd's enthusiasm.
Several times during the in
strumental, Bowie left the
stage. The old Bowie would have
been prancing and playing up to
the audience. Bowie is such an
incredibly supple and acrobatic
dancer, yet he didn't go into any
of his moves until half way
through the concert, during
"Fame," and then he danced
only briefly.

As Bowie gradually got into
his performance, so did the au
dience. The glitter king went
through his old songs; "1984,"
"Panic in Detroit," and "Five
Years" interspersing them with
songs from his new album, and
"Waiting for the Man" from a
yet-to-be-released album.
When Bowie did what has be
come his theme song
"Changes," he was almost nos
talgic, while at the same time
mocking himself, saying "how
the others must see me, the
faker" pointing to himself.
Bowie played for almost an
hour and a half, then left, until
the audience demanded three
encores. These last songs, "Re
bel, Rebel" and "Diamond
Dogs" were the highlight of the
concert.
Surprisingly, Bowie did not
do his AM top 40 single "Golden
Years" which may have been a
slap in the face to his newly ac
quired AM listeners or an at
tempt to be typically unpredict
able.
Bowie wants the mass appeal
of Frank Sinatra, but he'll first
have to overcome his obvious
boredom and contempt for his
fans. If this is the new Bowie, I
like the old one better.
David Bowie is the new Frank
Sinatra?! That's Bowie's goal (in
a Hailing Stone interview), but
Ole' Blue Eyes would never have
given the lacklustre perfor
mance Bowie gave Friday night.
Bowie proved conclusively
that his image has changed —
but not necessarily for the better.
Gone is the glitter king mounted
on a rocket-phallus. Enter the
new Bowie, the "thin white
duke," the title of his upcoming
biography.
Bowie's first hit "Changes"
seems to be his credo. From the
glitter of Diamond Dogs to the
more subdued Young Ameri
cans and just released Station
to-Stution album, we .can see
Bowie's metamorphasis.
Showmanship lost
But with this transformation
from the bizarre to the relatively
straight (for Bowie) he loses the
showmanship and gimmickry
that was so much of his appeal.
It's said that Howie doesn't
like San Francisco audiences,
and his concert at the Cow
Palace last weekend lent truth to
the rumor.
The concert started slowly,
with the surreal film Le Chien
Andalue as the opener, to the ir
ritation of the audience.
Finally Bowie appeared. Fit
ting into his new mood, the stage
had no props. Simply dressed,
he wore a black vest and pants
with a white flowing shirt. With
slicked back hair he definitely
had the look of a young Sinatra.
