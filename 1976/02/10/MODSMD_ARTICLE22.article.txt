# An evening of variety
## Duo offers mixed blessings 
### Michael Fossel 
An olio of poetry, short com
edy pieces and serious drama is
of Mixed Blessings. So say
Gerald Hi ken and Paul Richards,
the personae of the two man New
Theater which opened last
weekend at the Manhattan
Playhouse on West Bayshore,
Palo Alto.
Mixed Blessings proved an
appropriate title for the show
which gave rise to almost con
tinuous chuckling, but also
stretched one's nerves through
its tediousness.
Some of the finer pieces of the
evening included poetry recited
by Hiken, Zapped, a comic vig
nette of two neglected husbands
who find release in mutual mock
murder, and Tell Tucson / Love
You the only serious note of the
show.
Hiken and Richards worked as

an extremejy well-cordinated
dramatic team, delving through
material by Feiffer and Pinter, as
well as Richards' own original
work. The flow of their acting,
however, was interrupted by
Richards' insistent eye contact
with the audience.
This continually broke the il
lusion, spilling the audience
from the humorous portrayal of
modern life into the mere obser
vance of two entertaining actors.
Powerful piece
Richards redeemed himself in
assuming the role of a thirty year
old illiterate prison inmate in his
Tell Tucson I Love You. This
proved to be not only the most
powerful piece of the evening,
but the best acted as well.
Richards in particular de
monstrated a knack for wrench
ing the hearts of his audience
through his tough-as-nails

innocent-kid role. He balanced
himself well against Hiken's foil,
a dominant but lonely and bitter
old man whose world has be
come no larger than his cell.
Both Hiken and Richards re
vealed themselves as extremely
refined actors in this final piece,
displaying an ability to express a
dramatic range from the wry and
ribald to the quietly moving in
terplay of the two inmates.
Less professional
With the exception ofZcipped,
the comedy sketches were less
professional. The pacing was too
often slow and jerky, both actors
appearing surprisingly nervous
as they entered into their reper
toire. The nervousness was dis
pelled by the time they warmed
up to their second piece and Ha
kin's ability as a'comic caught
the audience's receptive mood
and obvious enjoyment.
The evening lacked sustained
energy, a difficult demand for
only two actors to meet for hours
on stage, however the show of
fers an evening of variety and
fun, many chuckles and,
perhaps, a quiet tear.
Mixed Blessings plays Fridays,
Saturdays and Sundays through
Feb. 29.
