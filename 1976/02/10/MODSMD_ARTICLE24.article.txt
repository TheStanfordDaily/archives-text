To The Stanford Community:
A warm invitation is extended to the Stanford student
body and University staff to attend an Open House of
the new Applied Physics Building and of the Microwave
Laboratory to be renamed the Edward L. Ginzton Lab
oratory on February 12th from 1-4 p.m. The occasion
offers a good opportunity to acquaint you with the
various areas of research that are being conducted by
the faculty and students affiliated with the Department
and the Laboratory. We particularly urge those of you
with a non-scientific background but with curiosity and
interest to visit.
