# Cat Stevens brings 'magic'
## 
### Kathy Welton 
Cat Steven's two-hour perfor
mance last Thursday at the Oak
land Coliseum was full of magic.
There was that magic present
which leaves the listener
spellbound after each song and
makes you wonder how Cat Ste
vens performs his trick so that
you feel so pensive and peaceful.
For example, a professional
magician performed his own
tricks at the beginning of the
showand at intermission. And at
the start of his show. Cat Stevens
magically appeared from a box.

This marked the entrance of the
magic. His song "Majik of
Majiks," implies the presence of
the supernatural also:
What kind of power, of poiver
What kind of man-
Can make me turn and see
The way I really am.
Oh tell me, who, oh who?
He played some tunes on the
guitar and some on a piano, and
there wasn't a song that didn't
hit with some part of the audi
ence. Their approval of his
choice of songs was made evi

dent with applause both before
and alter each song.
Loudest request
The loudest request was for
his composition Father and Son.
Perhaps this was because the
theme of this song is so clear and
so real for his audience, which
was almost entirely college and
high school students.
Unlike many contemporary
singers. Cat Stevens did not at
tract, or distract, the audience
with glitter. 18 inch platform
shoes or an extraordinary pair of
glasses.
Kather, he reflected the
simplicity, sincerity and peace
fulness of his music with a mod
est attire of green cords, a loose
white V-neck shirt, and a silver
cross strung loosely around his
neck.
Quietness
He showed this same quiet
ness to the audience, for he
didn't say much besides "hello"
and "good-night." 1 would have
enjoyed more stage patter.
He told the audience that he
got the inspiration for his song.
"Whistlestar" while he was in
Brazil, but left it at that. His
songs, however, made up for his
lack of verbal communication.
They relayed his thoughts in
stead.
He played old favorites such
as "Wild World," "Sad Lisa,"
"Oh, Very Young," "Peace
Train" and "Moonshadow,"
along with songs from his new
album Numbers. He selected
"Whistlestar," "Banapple Gas,"
and "Jzero" to advertise some of
his new sounds.
Nervousness
Cat Stevens strummed the first
few songs a little hurriedly,
showing signs of nervousness.
But the audience was enthusias
tic and it didn't take him long to
relax and even enjoy himself.
Not only was the audience
tapping out the beats of his
songs, but his band also began to
really swing.
Cat Stevens had me strung so
much in his magical music,
strung between my own
thoughts and his, that when he
was finishing, I realized that 1
didn't want the music to end.
Of course after a standing ova
tion, there was an encore, but I
still wasn't satisfied when he left
the stage. I still wanted some
more magic.
