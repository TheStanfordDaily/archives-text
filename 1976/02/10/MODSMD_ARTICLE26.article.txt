# John Stewart's sound unmellow
## 
### Noel Aguilar 
The Brewery in San Jose
would seem the perfect place for
the John Stewart performance
last Friday night, yet somehow
the favorable setting and a gen
erally appreciative audience
were unable to inspire him to
give a really memorable show.
The mellow environment of
darkly stained wood and soft
lighting at the Brewery seemed
low-key enough for a truly per
sonal interaction with the audi
ence. In fact, there was no real
"offstage" — Stewart just
walked through the audience
and jumped up on the stage.
His audience seemd to know
him. His more familiar folk
songs were greeted with howls
of approval, and the crowd
seemed to be in very good
spirits. But Stewart never estab
lished that level of communica
tion so necessary for his kind of
music.
The problem was largely the
result of the new sound of his
backup group. Until recently,
Stewart has always had a backup
which was designed to compli
ment him. The past use of a bac
kup pedal steel player
epitomized the desire to quietly
yet effectively provide a strong
foundation.
New sound
Stewart now is giving his
group more of a rock flavor, and
he loses some of his own feel by
doing so. Ironically, his acoustic
guitar was only occasionally
heard over the electric guitarist
and electric bassist.
His voice was well balanced
with the rest of the music and
was quite strong, but it seemed
to lose too much on the high
notes.
If John Stewart is moving to
wards a more Eagles-like coun
try rock presentation of his mate
rial, it might be helpful to rees
tablish contact with his old fans

first, and then later in the show
bring out his new approach.
After a fairly unsuccessful last
album released over a year ago,
the last thing he wants to do is
alienate his die-hard fans.
The opening act at the Brew
ery was comedian Father Guido
Sarducci, an out-spoken propo
nent of change within the
Catholic church. For example,

he had confidential information
that Mother Seton's recent can
nonization was a political move
designed to appease irate
Americans. Sarducci claimed
that Seton had only performed
three miracles, two of which
were card tricks. And so on.
Within the limited boundaries
of his gimmick, Sarducci man
ages quite well. But it is hard to
imagine that he can sustain the
Catholic church jokes for very
long without becoming repetiti
ous.
