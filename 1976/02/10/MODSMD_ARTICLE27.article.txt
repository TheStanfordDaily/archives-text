MPLA takes Angola capitol
LONDON — The Western-backed National
Union (UNITA) said yesterday that Huambo, its
capital in south-central Angola, has fallen to the
Soviet-backed Popular Movement (MPLA).
A drive on UNITA's military headquarters,
Silva Porto, 30 miles away, is expected shortly,
Western observers said.
The MPLA announced the capture of Huambo
earlier in the day and said its victory in northern
Angola was nearly complete.
An estimated 6000 Cuban troops closed in on
Huambo from four directions yesterday after
being airlifted by helicopter to the UNITA capi
tal, and Soviet-built tanks later rolled into the
city, according to UNITA intelligence sources.
A downcast Jorge Sangumba, UNITA's
foreign minister, confirmed the fall of Huambo
and told a news conference in Lusaka, Zambia
"there was indiscriminate killing of men,
women and children by the advancing MPLA."
British correspondents in Angola reported re
fugees were streaming toward Silva Porto from
Huambo.
State Department officials in Washington, try
ing to explain the loss of Huambo, said the
UNITA forces "just don't have the weapons to
match Soviet rockets and tanks.
Quake toll clears 17,000
GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala — The offi
cial death count in Guatemala's devastating ear
thquake surpassed 17,000 last night.
Doctors pleaded for serum to fight an outbreak
of typhoid and other diseases spread by con
taminated food and water.
President Kjell Eugenio Laugerud told dip
lomats that 17,032 persons had been killed,
54,826 injured and 221,994 left homeless by
Wednesday's giant earthquake and hundreds of
aftershocks.
Unofficial sources said they expected other
victims to be found beneath debris or landslides
and predicted the final death toll could exceed
20,000.
U.S. Embassy officials here said the quake was
the greatest disaster in recorded history in Cent
ral America. More than 6000 persons perished in
a Nicaraguan earthquake in 1972.
The Agency for International Development in
Washington reported U.S. aid to Guatemala to
tals more than $1.5 million, and it said food
stocks are now sufficient for short-term needs.
Israel and eight Latin American countries also
are pouring aid into this ravaged nation with a
population of six million.
The Guatemalan government refused two
plane loads of British aid, saying it was done
"for reasons of national dignity."
Guatemala and Britain are feuding over Be
lize, an 8000-square mile British colony adjoin
ing Guatemala, which claims it. Two months
agoboth nations concentrated troops at the bor

Ford: give aid to elderly
WASHINGTON — President Ford sent Con
gress yesterday his proposals for catastrophic
medical insurance for older Americans, coupled
with increased Social Security taxes and Medi
care contributions.
Ford said the $4.4 billion increase he is asking
in Social Security payroll tax increases would
not cost any worker more than $1 a week and
would "insure the financial integrity" of the sys
tem.
To help pay the estimated $1.1 billion to $1.4
billion cost of insuring the elderly against catas
trophic illness, Ford asked that Medicare pa
tients make larger contributions and that in
creases in Medicare payment rates to doctors
and hospitals be limited.
Ford urged Congress to act promptly on his
proposals, which he outlined in his Jan. 19State
of the Union message.
Older Americans "have earned the right to
live securely, comfortably and independently,"
the President said.
Malpractice bill postponed
SACRAMENTO — Action on a medical mal
practice bill sponsored by the United Physicians
of California was postponed for two weeks yes
terday by the Senate Finance Committee.
The measure by Sen. Alfred Song (D-
Monterey Park) is competing with one sup
ported by Gov. Edmund Brown, Jr. and intro
duced by Assemblyman Howard Berman (D-
Beverly Hills).
Both bills would set up a state fund for medi
cal malpractice insurance for doctors who elect
to contribute. However, Berman claims his fund
would require no public subsidy, while Song's
could eventually cost taxpayers billions of dol
lars.
Song amended his bill last week to reduce
the potential subsidy, but conceded in the Fi
nance Committee that his fund could run dry
unless the legislature reforms the rules for hand
ling malpractice suits.
High court to hear case?
FRESNO — The United States Supreme Court
should refuse to consider an appeal of contempt
citations against four Fresno Bee newsmen, a
legal brief states.
The four were accorded their constitutional
rights as witnesses during lower court hearings
in which they refused to disclose a confidential
source, says the brief filed with the high court
yesterday.
Thus, the case involves no federal constitu
tional questions, making it "unnecessary
and . . . inappropriate" for the Supreme Court to
hear the matters, says the brief prepared by Asst.
Fresno County Counsel Max Robinson.
The four newsmen have appealed indefinite
jail sentences on the grounds that California's

shield law and the First Amendment guarantee
them the right to protect confidential sources.
They were found in contempt last year and
ordered to jail until they reveal their source of
material published from a grand jury transcript
that had been ordered sealed until trials were
completed. The jail sentences were stayed pend
ing appeal.
Superior Court Judge Denver Peckinpah,
since retired, contended newsmen lose their
right to protect sources when it involves a de
termination whether a court official leaked
material that could prevent a fair trial.
State appellate courts agreed, although the
"Bee Four" testified their material did not come
from a court official.
Robinson represented Peckinpah in the orig
inal hearing and in subsequent appeals, includ
ing the Bee's current request that the U.S. Sup
reme Court hear the case.
Voter lists bring profit
MEREDITH, N.H. — Two New Hampshire
men expect to come out ahead regardless of
which Democrat and Republican win in the na
tion's first primary election.
The two compiled the only complete, com
puterized list of voters in the state, sold the Re
publican part of the list to President Ford and
Ronald Reagan and then began marketing the
Democratic side of the list.
Campaign aides of former Georgia Gov. Jimmy
Carter, Arizona Rep. Morris Udall and former
Oklahoma Sen. Fred Harris — all Democratic
presidential contenders — say they have agreed
to pay $1000 to $3000 for portions of Direct Mail
Systems' list of 90,000 Democratic households.
The complete list — Democrats, Republicans
and independents — took a year to compile at a
cost of $50,000 to $60,000, said Stewart Lam
prey, one of two partners who masterminded the
idea.
Lamprey said yesterday he has no expectation
of making money this year from selling the list,
but added that the company should make money
three years from now by selling updated lists to
political organizations and possibly to busines
ses.
Four months ago Lamprey, a former president
of the state Senate and one-time speaker of the
New Hampshire House of Representatives, sold
the names, telephone numbers and addresses of
103,000 Republican households to Ronald
Reagan for $50,000.
Along with the names, Lamprey agreed to
provide the Reagan campaign with other ser
vices, including a telephone bank of 12 workers
who have been calling prospective voters on
Reagan's behalf.
By late December, President Ford, locked in a
tight race against Reagan in New Hampshire's
Feb. 24 primary, also bought the Republican
names — without the telephone bank — for a fee
Ford aides said was in the neighborhood of
$15,000.

Bentsen plans campaign
Sen. Lloyd M. Bentsen (D-Tex.) is reportedly
leaning toward a favorite-son campaign in his
home state in the wake of delegate caucuses in
Oklahoma.
Two other Democrats appear delighted with
the Oklahoma results.
"It would be safe to say he's leaning toward a
favorite-son campaign in Texas," spokesman
Jack Devore said yesterday, after Bentsen spent
the morning with Texas supporters assessing
the future of his campaign.
The largest number of delegates selected in
Oklahoma, about 35 percent, were uncommit
ted, but both former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter
and former Oklahoma Sen. Fred Harris contend
their showing boosted their presidential can
didacies.
Just who the major beneficiary was apparently
won't be known until late this week, though.
Attention began to turn back to New Hamp
shire, meanwhile, where President Ford cam
paigned over the weekend.
His opponent for the GOP nomination, former
California Gov. Ronald Reagan, was in the Gra
nite State yesterday, also seeking to woo voters
for the Feb. 24 primary.
Italy leads giant slalom
INNSRUCK — Italian ski ace Gustavo Thoeni
fought his way down a washboard slope and
took the lead in the giant slalom at the Winter
Olympics yesterday. Russia's Calina Kulakova
was stripped of a bronze medal because she took
nose drops for cold and an American couple
won a bronze medal in ice dancing.
Meanwhile, Philip Mahre, one of the Alpine
skiing twins from White Pass, Wash., joined ice
dancers Colleen O'Connor and James Millons in
keeping alive America's continuing strong per
formances.
Mahre furnished the biggest surprise of the
day, finishing fourth in the first run of the giant
slalom. His performance put him in strong con
tention for a medal when the skiers take their
second run at the giant slalom today on another
slope across the beautiful Inn Valley, site of the
Winter Olympic Games.
Another American hopeful, Peter Mueller of
Mequon, Wis., goes for a gold medal today in the
men's 500-meter speed skating. He follows a
tough act in Sheila Young of Detroit, who won
gold, silver and bronze medals in women's
speed skating last week.
The Soviets, with eight golds, lead the stand
ings with 16 medals. The East Germans, with
five golds, are second with 12 and the surprising
U.S. team with one gold is third with seven.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow but with patchy morn
ing fog. Slightly warmer days. Lows tonight in
the mid 30s to low 40s. Highs today and tomor
row in upper 50s to mid 60s. Northwest winds to
15 mph.
