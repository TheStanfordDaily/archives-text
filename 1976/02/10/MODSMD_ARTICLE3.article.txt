# Study suggests reform for campaign spending
## 
### Jacob Young 
State legislative elections could be
made more competitive by campaign
spending reforms giving challen
gers added financial support.
That is one of the conclusions of a
recent study by Stanton Glantz, a
Stanford alumnus now at 11.C.-San
Francisco: Michael Burkart, another
alumnus now with California Com
mon Cause; and Alan Abramovitz, a
political science instructor.
Insufficient spending by challen
gers is a major source of the failure of
most challengers' campaigns, the
study said.
Because incumbents run on estab
lished records, a challenger must
create an image during the race, and
spending is a crucial part of that crea
tion. the study said.
"A challenger must depend on the
campaign to make his position known,
and this takes money," the study
explained.
Big money needed
To have had an even chance of win
ning, the study states that a challenger
would have had to spend $69,000 in
1972 and $60,000 in 1974 to win a
California Assembly seat, and
$108,000 in 1972 and $272,000 in 1974
to win a seat in the California congres
sional delegation. '
By contrast, the studv said average

spending for Assembly races by chal
lengers was $18,000 in 1972 and
$15,000 in 1974.
For California congressional chal
lengers, the figures were $33,000 in
1972 and $32,000 in 1974, the study
said, noting that congressional chal
lengers nationwide averaged $33,000
in election spending.
Incumbents spend more
Most incumbents spent about twice
these amounts, the study said, ad
ding that of 511 incumbents, only 16
were not reelected.
"It appears that when a strong chal
lenger mounts an effective campaign,
he raises substantial sums of money,
and the incumbent responds by raising
more money than he would have
raised without a strong challenger,"
the study said. "The more the chal
lenger spends, the smaller the incum
bent's victory margin.
"The main factor determining the
closeness of an election is not the fact
that the incumbent spends more than
the challenger, but rather that the chal
lenger is unable to raise sufficient
sums of monev," the study stated.
Thus the old laws which placed
limits on campaign spending probably
made most elections more one-sided,
since both challenger and incumbent
were limited in spending,according to
the study.

the study.
State legislative elections could be
made more competitive by campaign
spending reforms giving challen
gers added financial support.
That is one of the conclusions of a
recent study by Stanton Glantz, a
Stanford alumnus now at 11.C.-San
Francisco: Michael Burkart, another
alumnus now with California Com
mon Cause; and Alan Abramovitz, a
political science instructor.
Insufficient spending by challen
gers is a major source of the failure of
most challengers' campaigns, the
study said.
Because incumbents run on estab
lished records, a challenger must
create an image during the race, and
spending is a crucial part of that crea
tion. the study said.
"A challenger must depend on the
campaign to make his position known,
and this takes money," the study
explained.
Big money needed
To have had an even chance of win
ning, the study states that a challenger
would have had to spend $69,000 in
1972 and $60,000 in 1974 to win a
California Assembly seat, and
$108,000 in 1972 and $272,000 in 1974
to win a seat in the California congres
sional delegation. '
By contrast, the studv said average

spending for Assembly races by chal
lengers was $18,000 in 1972 and
$15,000 in 1974.
For California congressional chal
lengers, the figures were $33,000 in
1972 and $32,000 in 1974, the study
said, noting that congressional chal
lengers nationwide averaged $33,000
in election spending.
Incumbents spend more
Most incumbents spent about twice
these amounts, the study said, ad
ding that of 511 incumbents, only 16
were not reelected.
"It appears that when a strong chal
lenger mounts an effective campaign,
he raises substantial sums of money,
and the incumbent responds by raising
more money than he would have
raised without a strong challenger,"
the study said. "The more the chal
lenger spends, the smaller the incum
bent's victory margin.
"The main factor determining the
closeness of an election is not the fact
that the incumbent spends more than
the challenger, but rather that the chal
lenger is unable to raise sufficient
sums of monev," the study stated.
Thus the old laws which placed
limits on campaign spending probably
made most elections more one-sided,
since both challenger and incumbent
were limited in spending,according to
the study.
