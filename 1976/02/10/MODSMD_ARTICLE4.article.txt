# Hearst takes witness stand, claims 'fear' made her act
## 
### Steve Hefter 
SAN FRANCISCO â€” Patricia Hearst
testified publicly for the first time yes
terday, saying that she believed mem
bers of the Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA) were going to kill her if
she did not take part in the April 15,
1974 Hibernia Bank robbery.
Hearst said that she had been locked
in a closet for six weeks by her captors.
She said she had been dragged in a
garbage can and locked in the trlink of
a car while being taken from a Daly
City apartment to an apartment in San
Francisco prior to the robbery.
Hearst, who spoke softly and
seemed composed during her four
hours on the witness stand, said SLA
member William Wolfe "assaulted me
sexually," while she was being held
prisoner. She denied that she was ever
in love with Wolfe, who was killed in a
Los Angeles shootout with police in
May, 1974.
Hearst's testimony came during a

hearing closed to the jury but open to
reporters. Chief defense counsel, F.
Lee Bailey, sought to block the pro
secution from admitting certain evi
dence into the case.
The evidence included an SLA
issued tape recording, a handwritten
note by Hearst relating to another bank
robbery in Sacramento and testimony
from witnesses connected with the
shootout in front of Mel's Sporting
store in Los Angeles.
Confrontation
At one point a major confrontation
broke out over government prosecutor
James Browning's attempt to question
Hearst about a note she had written
prior to a bank robbery in Sacramento.
Bailey objected as Browning sought
to ask Hearst when she had written the
note attributed to her and found in the
apartment of William and Emily Har
ris, two SLA members captured the
same day as Hearst.
"Your honor, this is a fishing exped

ition," Bailey charged, and he in
structed Hearst not to answer the ques
tions.
U.S. District judge Oliver Carter in
terjected, "It is my duty to find out her
intent and frame of mind." The judge
instructed Hearst to answer.
Incrimination?
Browning was barely able to ask his
next question before Bailey objected
again, claiming that the court has "no
right to force her to incriminate her
self."
The judge then told Bailey that "the
whole course of Hearst's conduct is in
question," to which Bailey replied that
"your forcing her to answer could ex
pose her to further charges."
Carter asked Bailey to describe the
nature of such charges. Bailey refused,
insisting that an answer would violate
the attorney-client privilege.
Carter again asked Bailey to describe
the possible charges, but Bailey would
only say that Hearst's answers could
expose her to state and federal charges
for "felonious crimes which I will not
reveal."
Fifth Amendment
Bailey then claimed the Fifth
Amendment for the defendant, and the
judge acknowledged that Hearst did
not have to answer questions related to
the Sacramento note.
Hearst later claimed that she was
forced to make a tape recording in
which she had said that she was a wil
ling participant in the Hibernia Hank
robbery.
"Were you told what would happen
if you didn't cooperate?" Bailey asked.
Near tears for the first time, she re
plied," I was told that I would be kil
led."
"Did you have any choice about
going into the Hibernia bank?" Bailey
asked.
"No."
Cross-examination
Under cross-examination from
Browning, Hearst admitted that at one
point, SLA leader Donald DeFreeze of
fered her the choice of either staying

with the revolutionaries or returning
home. She said that she did not believe
he was sincere, and chose to stay.
Browning also questioned Hearst
about the incident in Los Angeles
where she fired an automatic weapon
in front of a sporting goods store in
order to free William Harris, accused
of shoplifting.
Later, she and the Harrises stole a
van belonging to a 17-year-old, Torn
Matthews, whom they brought along.
"Did you fire an automatic
weapon?" Browning asked.
"I guess, yeah," she replied.
"Doesn't it seem strange you didn't
take this opportunity to get away?"
Browning inquired.
'Kidnapped'
"1 guess 1 could have gotten out of
the van." she said, but added that
"from the time 1 was kidnapped, 1 was
blindfolded and underwent classes
every day on what to do if something
like this happened.
"1 felt if I had not done what I did,
and they had been able to get away,
they would have killed me."
She told Bailey during re
examination. that she saw films of the
Los Angeles shootout at which six
members of the SLA were killed while
in an Anaheim motel.
Bailey, trying to establish that
Hearst feared the FBI, asked his client
whom newsmen said police thought
was in the building.
"Me," she replied.
"And what were the police doing?"
Bailey asked.
"They were firing bullets," she said.
'Common criminal'
Bailey also asked Hearst if she had
heard what then-AttorneyCeneralVVil
liam Saxbe had called her in 1974.
"He called me a common criminal,"
she said.
During further questioning. Brown
ing asked Hearst what she had told
young Matthews in Los Angeles.
"That 1 participated voluntarily, that
I had done it because my parents didn't
care about me, and that I had joined the
SLA." she said. But Hearst explained
that she had been given prior instruc
tions by Harris to tell that to people.
"What did you believe would hap
pen if you didn't tell people that?"
"That I'd be killed."
Cross-country trip
Browning also questioned Hearst
about why she never attempted to es
cape, particularly when she was dri
ven from Berkeley to Pennsylvania by
former athletic director Jack Scott and
his parents.
Hearst admitted that Scott did not
prevent her from leaving, but she ad
ded, "Where would 1 have gone? 1
didn't feel I would have been able to go
any place."
After Hearst's testimony, Bailey cal
led another witness, court-appointed
psychologist Margaret Singer, to the
stand.
Singer supported the defense con
tention that the tape recording of April
18, 1974, in which Hearst talked of the
Hibernia bank robbery, was written by
SLA member Angela Atwood not by
Hearst.
School papers
"The style of the sentences is not
that of Miss Hearst," Singer testified.
"1 can tell from hearing her speak and
reading some of her school papers."
