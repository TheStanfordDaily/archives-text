# No new massage establishments
## Council votes against parlors 
### Geoffrey Samuels 
The Palo Alto City Council voted 6-1
last night to implement a six-month
moratorium on the establishment of
massage parlors and similar adult
oriented enterprises within city boun
daries.
The council further instructed the
city staff to explore options for regulat
ing and controlling the existing mas
sage establishments.
Controversy centered on the effect of
the massage establishments on the
family structureand the decency of the
community.
The majority of 30 Palo Alto resi
dents protested the existence of the
parlors and claimed that the parlors
detracted from the attractiveness of
Palo Alto as a residential community.
Criticism
In criticizing the existence of the
massage parlors, Palo Alto resident
Conway B. Sonne said, "The type of
permissiveness that is before us today
will have nothing but a detrimental
effect in the future."
The family structure, said Shirley
Campbell, another Palo Alto resident,
is essential to the moral fibre and de
cency of the community.
"An insidious evil has woven its
way into Palo Alto," she said. "If we
don't legislate morality, then we are
legislating, in effect, immorality."
The ready accessibility of the parlors
was seen by many parents as a corrupt
ing influence on their children. Palo
Alto resident Steven Harrison warned
of the "abnormal, degenerate sexual
influences" of the parlors.
He added that he felt the sexual edu
cation of his children was his personal
responsibility and that the parlors pre
sented "a crude street education."
Opponents of the parlors demanded
immediate action to remove the par
lors from Palo Alto. The presence of
the parlors offended the sense of de
cency and identity of several of the
women.
Representative of this view was the
comment of Denny Petrosian. a resi
dent of Palo Alto. "The luring, over
sensitive and often sinister aspects of
the massage parlor" acted as a viola
tion of her female identity, she said.
Frank Manfredi, a senior citizen of
Palo Alto, said, "I'm a sexy senior citi
zen. I love sex. but I don't want to pay
for it."
He added. Palo Alto is a residential
community and massage establish
ments should be kept in San Francisco.

Defendants of the massage parlors
cited the principles of free choice, in
dividualism and tolerance as factors
protecting the existence of the estab
lishments.
JuneGenis, chairman of the Stanford
Libertarians, said that "the issue at
stake is nothing but the right of the
individual to choose his own life style
— for the cause of liberty."
Tolerance
Tolerance in a pluralistic society is
necessary, said Bill Evers, co
chairman of the Stanford Libertarians.
"Part of the problem of living in a
pluralistic society," said Evers, a
graduate student in political science,
"is learning tolerance in order to
achieve a more variegated society."
In response to the desire of oppo
nents of massage establishments to
legislate morality. Evers said that "vir
tue must be freely chosen; it cannot be

imposed."
The often emotional speeches given
by opponents of the parlors led Stanley
D. Duke of Palo Alto to warn against
the development of a lynch-mob men
tality.
Don Louden, a massage parlor
owner, said that the question of the
existence of the parlors was for tin!
courts to decide. "Only the laws of the
state," he said, "can control sex."
Numerous disparaging remarks
were made of the establishments and
their employes by opponents of the
parlors. Linda koetka, a licensed mas
seuse, said she resented the comments.
She said that the opponents were
guilty of insulting remarks not based
on fact. She offered "an open invita
tion to the council members to come to
any massage parlor and see what is
occurring. I am a licensed masseuse. I
am not a prostitute."
