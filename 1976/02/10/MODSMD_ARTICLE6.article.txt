### 
The Sociology Department's recent
decision to deny tenure to Asst. Sociol
ogy Prof. Anne McMahon has once more
directed attention to the way tenure de
cisions are made here.
The present system features several
separate appraisals of a candidate. It be
gins with a review of the candidate's
teaching and research by his or her own
department, based partly on opinions
from scholars at other Universities.
If this review recommends tenure, the
candidate is then evaluated through a
similar process by the Appointments
and Promotions (A&P) Committee. The
A&P Committee then makes its own re
commendation to the Dean of
Humanities and Sciences, who issues a
decision.
If the departmental review advises
against tenure, it becomes a decision,
appealable to the Dean of Humanities
and Sciences.
In all cases, further appeals to the pro
vost and the president are possible.
Several problems can arise in this
multi-step process. On a few previous
occasions, departments have not been
critical enough in reviewing the records
of their tenure candidates.
Although departments have never
given automatic approval to all candi
dates, they have forced the A&P Commit
tee to take up cases that could have been
handled on the departmental level.
The Sociology Department gave care
ful scrutiny to McMahon's record. Other
departments should also fully review
candidates' research and teaching re
cord before sending the case along.
Changes in the tenure review system
must be made to eliminate certain prob

lems with the A&P Committee's recom
mendations.
These recommendations are a major
step in the tenure evaluation process. In
several cases, the committere has re
versed department recommen
dations that tenure be given, and was
upheld in subsequent decisions.
Often, the committee has provided lit
tle explanation for such vital recom
mendations. In some instances, explana
tion has been limited to a one-page letter
from the A&P Committee to the candi
date expressing only generalities about
quality of research and teaching.
The committee should prepare de
tailed statements explaining all its re
commendations. These statements
should include specific factors that
guided the recommendation.
Such statements would provide can
didates with an adequate explanation of
how the A&P Committee reached its pos
ition. They would also serve to show fu
ture candidates what types of ac
complishments the committee values.
In certain cases, though, a tenure can
didate might not wish to have others see
the committee's recommendation on his
or her case. Such a situation could be
allowed for by having the A&P Commit
tee issue its report to the candidate, who
would have the option of making it pub
lic.
Finally, we advocate placing a student
representative on the A&P Committee.
This would help provide an effective,
orderly channel for sttident input on te
nure decisions.
Such steps would serve to open up the
tenure decision process, thereby
eliminating many of the tenure
generated animosities that now exist.
