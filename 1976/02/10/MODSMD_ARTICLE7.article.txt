I am writing in regard to com
ments made about the Trans
cendental Meditation Program
in Viae Kershner's Feb. 9 Daily
column. "Evangelisrn's 'call'
lures converts." Kershner's re
marks uncritically lump Trans
cendental Meditation (TM) to
gether with Josh McDowell,
Christian Revivalism and Rev.
Sun Yung Moon, as one of an
assortment of "other-worldly,"
"escapist" solutions to modern
malaise.
TM is not a religion, a
philosophy or even an "escape."
It could be said to he simply a
relaxation technique, although
actually it is much more than
this.
Users enjoy TM twice daily for
15 or 20 minutes, sitting com
fortably in a chair. Regular prac
tice leads to the dissolution of
tensions in the nervous system,
enabling a person to use more of
the creative potential and intel
ligence which may be blocked
by stress and anxiety.
Mental potential
It is commonly accepted by
psychiatrists that the average
person uses no more than five
percent to 15 percent of his or
her full mental potential. Hut
this means we're unacquainted
with 85 percent to 95 percent of
what we are. Can a technique
which enables one to begin to
use more of oneself and enjoy
activity more be a method of es

cape?
It seems to me TM is just the
opposite. Self-development is
the true aim of education, indeed
of all praiseworthy human pur
suits. TM simply offers a natural,
enjoyable way to effortlessly en
hance one's own creative evolu
tion.
Unlike the other movements
mentioned by Kershner, the be
nefits of TM are firmly grounded
in objective scientific inquiry.
There are now over 300 scien
tific experiments which have
dealt with the effects of TM on
mind and body as well as inter
personal relationships.
Taken as a whole, the evi
dence indisputably indicates
TM does indeed promote a
simultaneous development of all
aspects of a person's life.
Nothing artificial
And this is no artificial, cont
rived phenomenon. Rather, TM
simply produces an entirely
natural, physiological response
of great benefit to the nervous
system.
Finally, who practices TM?
There are hundreds of members
of the Stanford community who
have taken TM courses, offered
by the non-profit Students' In
ternational Meditation Society.
One well-known and very
popular Stanford professor who
practices TM. John Kaplan, was
quoted favorably about it in a re

cent Time cover story on Trans
cendental Meditation. I person
ally don't consider myself an
"other-worldly" escapist, or a
fanatic, and I have been enjoying
TM for four years.
Far from being "escapist," or
"other-worldly," TM is the very
opposite: a most practical and ef
fective approach toward self
development.
