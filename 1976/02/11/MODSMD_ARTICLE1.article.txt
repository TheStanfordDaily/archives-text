# COSS indecisive on gay controversy
## 
### Lori Matsukawa 
The Committee on Services to Stu
dents (COSS) split evenly yesterday on
a recommendation to ban employers
who discriminate against gays from
using the Career Planning and Place
ment Center (CPPC).
The committee voted 3-3 with one
abstention on the fourth part of the
COSS recommendation for stopping
gay hiring discrimination.
The vote wili not affect the final
written recommendation already
submitted to President Richard Ly
man. That recommendation states pos
itions for and against the banning of
discriminating employers from using
the CPPC.
Unanimous vote
The committee also voted unanim
ously to recommend that Lyman state
the University's position on discrimi
nation against gays.
With a single dissenting vote, the
committee also voted to recommend
that employers using the CPPC be re
quired to state their gay discrimination
policy.
COSS member and Assoc. Control
ler Frank Riddle was the dissenter.
'Don't require'
"l would encourage those com
panies who use the CPPC to state their
hiring policies, but not require them to
do so," Riddle said.
"What if they don't state their hiring
policy? It seems to me there would
then be a need for a sanction," said
Riddle. He added there are no sanc
tions in the COSS proposal.
"What happens next is entirely up to
President Lyman," said COSS member
Leigh-Ann Miyasato, a senior. "If he
approves of the committee's recom
mendations, he could give them to the
director of the CPPC (Ralph Keller) to
be acted upon."
Only recommendations
"The committee does not have the
power to tell the University to estab
lish a non-discriminatory policy to
<v.'rd gays," said COSS Chairman Dan
Poston. "We can only recommend that
it make a statement about its position."
In the written proposal submitted to
Lyman, Assoc. History Prof. Barton
Bernstein argued for the banning of
discriminating employers. Senior Paul
Sobotka, a COSS member, drafted the
argument against such a ban.
Riddle, who voted against the ban,
said a ban would prevent "those who
do want an interview with them (dis
criminating employers) from seeing
them."
'Free speech issue'
"It's like a free speech issue," Riddle
said. "Would you ban an employer
from coming to the University because
his view of hiring policy isn't like
you rs ?
"At a university, we must be free and
open and allow students to make their
choices on who they want to talk to or
not," said Riddle.
"What we're basically proposing is
to ask companies if they have a (hiring)
policy that does not discriminate,"
said Eric Hemel, a ban proponent.
Military not included
"If there were a ban, the military
would not be included, though it does
discriminate openly," Hemel said.
Poston, who voted against the ban,
said a company using the CPPC cur

rently answers a list of questions on its
hiring procedure.
Whether they discriminate or not
against gays could be added onto that
list, Poston said.
"I'd like thepresident to at least take
action on those parts that we sup
ported unanimously," said Miyasato.
"I think a statement should be made
that the University doesn't discrimi
nate against gays."
"President Lyman can approve or
disapprove the recommendation,"
said Riddle. "Or he can modify it. He is
not required to consult the committee
(if he decides to modify it)."
"There weren't any surprises (in the
vote)," commented Bernstein. "Those
people who had been to previous
meetings had stated and voted the way
they wanted. We know where most
people stood."

CHIEF COUNSEL—Patricia Hearst's attorney, F. Lee Bailey (shown here),
has sought to block the introduction of an SLA tape recording, a note by
Hearst relating to the Sacramento bank robbery and testimony of witnesses
connected with the shooting in front of a Los Angeles sporting goods store.
Also during yesterday's proceedings, prosecution witness Thomas Matth
ews, another SLA kidnap victim, said that Hearst told him that she was a
"willing" accomplice of the San Francisco Hibernia Bank robbery.
