# New views on black leaders' feud
## 
### 
Black Liberation Month seems
an appropriate time to examine
the popular images of at least a
few major figures and conflicts
in the history of black folk in
America.
One of the most important —
as well as worst-reported and
best-romanticized — conflicts
was that between former slave
Booker Washington, a white
created and funded "leader,"
and W.E.B Dußois and other
self-styled radical black
spokesmen.
Writing in the Spring 1973
issue of The Journal of Negro
Education, Leo Ailunas presents
a fascinating analysis of how
Washington and Dußois — and
their conflict — have been por
trayed in elementary and secon
dary schools, and on how the
portrayals are changing.
The article makes worthwhile

reading, and summarizing it is
unfair to the author, but I will
nevertheless try to outline its es
sential points.
First, Ailunas shows that trad
itionally, Washington has been
pictured as a leader, a great man,

and radicals such as Dußois
have been ignored altogether.
The conflict between the two has
showed Washington as a hero,
the great compromiser, the apos
tle of education and self-help.
When pictured at all, Dußois has
been a dangerous opponent of
this reasonable dictum.
Roles reversed
The first move towards re
visionism, Ailunas notes, has
largely reversed their roles.
Dußois became the hero, the
spokesman for black grievance,
the battler for civil rights.
Washington was sometimes de
nigrated to mere equality with
Dußois. Some authors even
began painting Washington as
the villain. But even this re
visionism — at least in the
schools — provided only a few
vagaries and failed to illuminate
the conflict.
The new and current re
visionism, which as not yet fil
tered to the schools, has moved
toward what August Meier cal
led "reinterpretation of Booker
T. Washington," generally
couched in terms of his secret
actions which belied his public
catering to whites.
But the differences over edu
cation so often referred to in lit
erature were, for most of
Washington's career at least, in
significant. Washington es
poused industrial education as
the road to equality, playing
down higher education and ig
noring calls for social or political
equality.
He had the support of white
politicians, media and philan
thropists, and acquired immense
personal power and wealth,
primarily because his views
made sense but in no way chal
lenged the existing white reac
tionary power structure, either
on political or economic
grounds.

Black people, too, supported
him — at least from such evi
dence as is available. Although
the intelligentsia might have
been critical, their views had lit
tle circulation.
Dußois began with views very
close to Washington's, although
historians largely ignore this
fact.
But Dußois later moved to the
position that a "literary educa
tion" was necessary for the
"Talented Tenth" which, in his
view, would lead black people to
equality. He never rejected the
doctrine of industrial training
for the masses, but accused
Washington of wanting to train
all black people that way, and of
rejecting books almost entirely.
Washington responded that
he did, after all, need college
trained personnel to teach
others. But in point of fact,
Washington often took steps t(5
see that other black colleges had
trouble raising funds.
Support threatened
Atlanta University might have
lost all support from the Slater
Fund, a northern philanthropic
organization, had the school not
been able to prove that Dußois
(then employed at Atlanta) had
had no hand in an anti-
Washington protest in Boston.
Washington's new defenders
cite his record of secretly fund
ing some civil rights cases, and
of similar covert actions. True or
not, those few "merits" do little
to make up for the divisiveness

which Washington's search for
personal power brought to a po
tentially united black commun
ity.
The revisionists claim
Washington could not have
acted publicly and kept hH
power. This may be true — but
his power should not have been
the basis of his decisions. It
would be ahistorical to expect
Washington to have been a radi
cal in the current sense in any
case; but once he gained power
and wealth, could he not hav«.
sided with black radicals, at least
in getting a message across to
black America? «,
Dußois tried various move
ments and publications, but
could never build up any real
anti-Washington fervo^
Washington controlled the
purse strings and was consulted
by the politicians — Dußois and
his associates controlled virtu
ally nothing.
In fact, the much-discussed
conflict never existed, in any
real sense.
Historians are fond of saying
that Dußois and other radicals
eventually convinced blacks to
repudiate the Tuskegee
philosophy. This is untrue.
All that happened was that
Washington died, and his
power, prestige and iron-fistec
control of black America died
with him.

in the history of black folk in
America.
One of the most important —
as well as worst-reported and
best-romanticized — conflicts
was that between former slave
Booker Washington, a white
created and funded "leader,"
and W.E.B Dußois and other
self-styled radical black
spokesmen.
Writing in the Spring 1973
issue of The Journal of Negro
Education, Leo Ailunas presents
a fascinating analysis of how
Washington and Dußois — and
their conflict — have been por
trayed in elementary and secon
dary schools, and on how the
portrayals are changing.
The article makes worthwhile

reading, and summarizing it is
unfair to the author, but I will
nevertheless try to outline its es
sential points.
First, Ailunas shows that trad
itionally, Washington has been
pictured as a leader, a great man,

and radicals such as Dußois
have been ignored altogether.
The conflict between the two has
showed Washington as a hero,
the great compromiser, the apos
tle of education and self-help.
When pictured at all, Dußois has
been a dangerous opponent of
this reasonable dictum.
Roles reversed
The first move towards re
visionism, Ailunas notes, has
largely reversed their roles.
Dußois became the hero, the
spokesman for black grievance,
the battler for civil rights.
Washington was sometimes de
nigrated to mere equality with
Dußois. Some authors even
began painting Washington as
the villain. But even this re
visionism — at least in the
schools — provided only a few
vagaries and failed to illuminate
the conflict.
The new and current re
visionism, which as not yet fil
tered to the schools, has moved
toward what August Meier cal
led "reinterpretation of Booker
T. Washington," generally
couched in terms of his secret
actions which belied his public
catering to whites.
But the differences over edu
cation so often referred to in lit
erature were, for most of
Washington's career at least, in
significant. Washington es
poused industrial education as
the road to equality, playing
down higher education and ig
noring calls for social or political
equality.
He had the support of white
politicians, media and philan
thropists, and acquired immense
personal power and wealth,
primarily because his views
made sense but in no way chal
lenged the existing white reac
tionary power structure, either
on political or economic
grounds.

Black people, too, supported
him — at least from such evi
dence as is available. Although
the intelligentsia might have
been critical, their views had lit
tle circulation.
Dußois began with views very
close to Washington's, although
historians largely ignore this
fact.
But Dußois later moved to the
position that a "literary educa
tion" was necessary for the
"Talented Tenth" which, in his
view, would lead black people to
equality. He never rejected the
doctrine of industrial training
for the masses, but accused
Washington of wanting to train
all black people that way, and of
rejecting books almost entirely.
Washington responded that
he did, after all, need college
trained personnel to teach
others. But in point of fact,
Washington often took steps t(5
see that other black colleges had
trouble raising funds.
Support threatened
Atlanta University might have
lost all support from the Slater
Fund, a northern philanthropic
organization, had the school not
been able to prove that Dußois
(then employed at Atlanta) had
had no hand in an anti-
Washington protest in Boston.
Washington's new defenders
cite his record of secretly fund
ing some civil rights cases, and
of similar covert actions. True or
not, those few "merits" do little
to make up for the divisiveness

which Washington's search for
personal power brought to a po
tentially united black commun
ity.
The revisionists claim
Washington could not have
acted publicly and kept hH
power. This may be true — but
his power should not have been
the basis of his decisions. It
would be ahistorical to expect
Washington to have been a radi
cal in the current sense in any
case; but once he gained power
and wealth, could he not hav«.
sided with black radicals, at least
in getting a message across to
black America? «,
Dußois tried various move
ments and publications, but
could never build up any real
anti-Washington fervo^
Washington controlled the
purse strings and was consulted
by the politicians — Dußois and
his associates controlled virtu
ally nothing.
In fact, the much-discussed
conflict never existed, in any
real sense.
Historians are fond of saying
that Dußois and other radicals
eventually convinced blacks to
repudiate the Tuskegee
philosophy. This is untrue.
All that happened was that
Washington died, and his
power, prestige and iron-fistec
control of black America died
with him.

best-romanticized — conflicts
was that between former slave
Booker Washington, a white
created and funded "leader,"
and W.E.B Dußois and other
self-styled radical black
spokesmen.
Writing in the Spring 1973
issue of The Journal of Negro
Education, Leo Ailunas presents
a fascinating analysis of how
Washington and Dußois — and
their conflict — have been por
trayed in elementary and secon
dary schools, and on how the
portrayals are changing.
The article makes worthwhile

reading, and summarizing it is
unfair to the author, but I will
nevertheless try to outline its es
sential points.
First, Ailunas shows that trad
itionally, Washington has been
pictured as a leader, a great man,

and radicals such as Dußois
have been ignored altogether.
The conflict between the two has
showed Washington as a hero,
the great compromiser, the apos
tle of education and self-help.
When pictured at all, Dußois has
been a dangerous opponent of
this reasonable dictum.
Roles reversed
The first move towards re
visionism, Ailunas notes, has
largely reversed their roles.
Dußois became the hero, the
spokesman for black grievance,
the battler for civil rights.
Washington was sometimes de
nigrated to mere equality with
Dußois. Some authors even
began painting Washington as
the villain. But even this re
visionism — at least in the
schools — provided only a few
vagaries and failed to illuminate
the conflict.
The new and current re
visionism, which as not yet fil
tered to the schools, has moved
toward what August Meier cal
led "reinterpretation of Booker
T. Washington," generally
couched in terms of his secret
actions which belied his public
catering to whites.
But the differences over edu
cation so often referred to in lit
erature were, for most of
Washington's career at least, in
significant. Washington es
poused industrial education as
the road to equality, playing
down higher education and ig
noring calls for social or political
equality.
He had the support of white
politicians, media and philan
thropists, and acquired immense
personal power and wealth,
primarily because his views
made sense but in no way chal
lenged the existing white reac
tionary power structure, either
on political or economic
grounds.

Black people, too, supported
him — at least from such evi
dence as is available. Although
the intelligentsia might have
been critical, their views had lit
tle circulation.
Dußois began with views very
close to Washington's, although
historians largely ignore this
fact.
But Dußois later moved to the
position that a "literary educa
tion" was necessary for the
"Talented Tenth" which, in his
view, would lead black people to
equality. He never rejected the
doctrine of industrial training
for the masses, but accused
Washington of wanting to train
all black people that way, and of
rejecting books almost entirely.
Washington responded that
he did, after all, need college
trained personnel to teach
others. But in point of fact,
Washington often took steps t(5
see that other black colleges had
trouble raising funds.
Support threatened
Atlanta University might have
lost all support from the Slater
Fund, a northern philanthropic
organization, had the school not
been able to prove that Dußois
(then employed at Atlanta) had
had no hand in an anti-
Washington protest in Boston.
Washington's new defenders
cite his record of secretly fund
ing some civil rights cases, and
of similar covert actions. True or
not, those few "merits" do little
to make up for the divisiveness

which Washington's search for
personal power brought to a po
tentially united black commun
ity.
The revisionists claim
Washington could not have
acted publicly and kept hH
power. This may be true — but
his power should not have been
the basis of his decisions. It
would be ahistorical to expect
Washington to have been a radi
cal in the current sense in any
case; but once he gained power
and wealth, could he not hav«.
sided with black radicals, at least
in getting a message across to
black America? «,
Dußois tried various move
ments and publications, but
could never build up any real
anti-Washington fervo^
Washington controlled the
purse strings and was consulted
by the politicians — Dußois and
his associates controlled virtu
ally nothing.
In fact, the much-discussed
conflict never existed, in any
real sense.
Historians are fond of saying
that Dußois and other radicals
eventually convinced blacks to
repudiate the Tuskegee
philosophy. This is untrue.
All that happened was that
Washington died, and his
power, prestige and iron-fistec
control of black America died
with him.

Black Liberation Month seems
an appropriate time to examine
the popular images of at least a
few major figures and conflicts
in the history of black folk in
America.
