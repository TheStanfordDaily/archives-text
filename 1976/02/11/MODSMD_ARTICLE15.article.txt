# Djerassi, students debate DES issue

### Dave Sartoris 
Future development of
therapeutic estrogens may be
jeopardized by the recent con
troversy over diethylstilbesterol
(DES), according to Chemistry
Prof. Carl Djerassi. His remarks
accompanied a student debate
on the DES issue in the course
"Biosocial Aspects of Hirth Con
trol" Feb. 9.
Diethylstilbesterol is a man
made version of one of the
natural female sex hormones, or
estrogens. The drug was widely
prescribed as an effective deter
rent to miscarriage from World
War II through the early 19605,
with no apparent side-effects.
However, since 1971 more
than 250 cases of a previously
rare vaginal adenocarcinoma
(cancer) have been registered by
researchers at Massachusetts
Ceneral Hospital in Boston. In
vestigation of IHO of the young
women involved revealed that
the mothers of at least 120 had
taken DES or related hormones
during the first 18 weeks of pre
gnancy.
The situation has prompted
many of the victims to file mas
sive damage suits against phar
maceutical companies which
marketed the drug. Although
none have reached the trial
stage, the potential liabiliy is
staggering, as researchers esti
mate that two million women
may have been exposed

to DES before Nov. 1971
when the FDA warned against
its use in pregnancy.
Questionnaire
In dealing with the justifica
tion for such suits, students in
Djerassi's course were required
to complete a questionnaire stat
ing their views on the issue.
Based on the responses, 12 indi
viduals were chosen to briefly
present their arguments to the
rest of the class.
Junior Marna Parke contended
that the research and develop
ment leading to the synthesis of
DES should have been more
stringently executed.
"The drug was introduced
prematurely in the United
States, following poor clinical
trials in Europe which lacked
adequate controls. Tests should
have been conducted on animals
whose metabolic processes re
semble those of man in order to
verify its safety," Parke said.
Junior Allison Brown main
tained that no drug should be
approved by the FDA unless it
has first been proven uncondi
tionally safe. "Side-effects dis
covered after approval should
warrant immediate removal of
the drug from the market until its
safety is reverified by further
testing," she commented.
Not liable
Another student felt that the
drug companies should not be
held liable for the recently

discovered side-effects of DES.
"However, they should offer
some financial support toward
locating other potential victims
of vaginal carcinoma,sinceearly
recognition facilitates treatment.
This action should not seem fi
nancially burdensome, in view
of the fact that virtually no

a
money was spent by American
pharmaceutical companies on
the development of DES."
Senior Dean Hashimoto of
fered a series of specific recom
mendations aimed at solving the
DES controversy and preventing
similar cases in the future.
"Ceilings should be set on the

amount for which a patient may
sue, and guidelines for new drug
development should be strictly
enforced. As long as these
guidelines are met, a phar
maceutical company should not
be held liable, since the patient
would have been made aware of
the possible risks associated
with the drug. In addition, a
limit should be set on the
amount a lawyer may receive
from a successful suit, in order to
eliminate the incentive for
ridiculously high claims."
Of the 56 students in the class,
28 responded that they would
sue over the DES issue while an
equal number indicated that
they would not. Among the wo
men, 15 answered yes and 18
no, while 13 men responded yes
and 10 indicated otherwise.
"Several students in the sam
ple were DES babies, and not one
of them indicated that they
would sue," added Djerassi.
Others susceptible
Djerassi pointed out that the
pharmaceutical companies are
not the only parties susceptible
to lawsuit over DES. "It is
foreseeable that victims of the
drug may consider suits against
their mothers, for making a deci
sion detrimental to their health.
Physicians might be sued for fai
lure to adequately warn patients
of the risks involved in taking
such a drug."

He continued, "This latter ac
tion, if successful, would dis
courage other doctors from pre
scribing therapeutic agents for
fear of lawsuit. However, the pa
tient might then have sufficient
grounds to sue for denial of
treatment."
He added that successful suits
over the DES issue would have
tragic effects upon the future of
the pharmaceutical industry. "It
has been known for sometime
that estrogens are effective in
preventing arteriosclerosis in
men. With the incentive to de
velop a synthetic estrogen de
stroyed by fear of lawsuit, it is
unlikely that the clinical be
nefits of such an agent will ever
be realized."
Future implications
Djerassi projected the possible
future implications of DES suits
through reference to recent find
ings concerning several non
prescription drugs.
"Aspirin was shown to be
teratogenic in one study con
ducted with rabbits, while caf
feine induced stunted limbs re
sembling the Thalidomide syn
drome in another. The havoc
created by suits against man
ufacturers of such commonly
used drugs as these, if side
effects were proven in humans,
would be staggering," he con
cluded.

courage other doctors from pre
scribing therapeutic agents for
fear of lawsuit. However, the pa
tient might then have sufficient
grounds to sue for denial of
treatment."
He added that successful suits
over the DES issue would have
tragic effects upon the future of
the pharmaceutical industry. "It
has been known for sometime
that estrogens are effective in
preventing arteriosclerosis in
men. With the incentive to de
velop a synthetic estrogen de
stroyed by fear of lawsuit, it is
unlikely that the clinical be
nefits of such an agent will ever
be realized."
Future implications
Djerassi projected the possible
future implications of DES suits
through reference to recent find
ings concerning several non
prescription drugs.
"Aspirin was shown to be
teratogenic in one study con
ducted with rabbits, while caf
feine induced stunted limbs re
sembling the Thalidomide syn
drome in another. The havoc
created by suits against man
ufacturers of such commonly
used drugs as these, if side
effects were proven in humans,
would be staggering," he con
cluded.

Future development of
therapeutic estrogens may be
jeopardized by the recent con
troversy over diethylstilbesterol
(DES), according to Chemistry
Prof. Carl Djerassi. His remarks
accompanied a student debate
on the DES issue in the course
"Biosocial Aspects of Hirth Con
trol" Feb. 9.
Diethylstilbesterol is a man
made version of one of the
natural female sex hormones, or
estrogens. The drug was widely
prescribed as an effective deter
rent to miscarriage from World
War II through the early 19605,
with no apparent side-effects.
However, since 1971 more
than 250 cases of a previously
rare vaginal adenocarcinoma
(cancer) have been registered by
researchers at Massachusetts
Ceneral Hospital in Boston. In
vestigation of IHO of the young
women involved revealed that
the mothers of at least 120 had
taken DES or related hormones
during the first 18 weeks of pre
gnancy.
The situation has prompted
many of the victims to file mas
sive damage suits against phar
maceutical companies which
marketed the drug. Although
none have reached the trial
stage, the potential liabiliy is
staggering, as researchers esti
mate that two million women
may have been exposed

to DES before Nov. 1971
when the FDA warned against
its use in pregnancy.
Questionnaire
In dealing with the justifica
tion for such suits, students in
Djerassi's course were required
to complete a questionnaire stat
ing their views on the issue.
Based on the responses, 12 indi
viduals were chosen to briefly
present their arguments to the
rest of the class.
Junior Marna Parke contended
that the research and develop
ment leading to the synthesis of
DES should have been more
stringently executed.
"The drug was introduced
prematurely in the United
States, following poor clinical
trials in Europe which lacked
adequate controls. Tests should
have been conducted on animals
whose metabolic processes re
semble those of man in order to
verify its safety," Parke said.
Junior Allison Brown main
tained that no drug should be
approved by the FDA unless it
has first been proven uncondi
tionally safe. "Side-effects dis
covered after approval should
warrant immediate removal of
the drug from the market until its
safety is reverified by further
testing," she commented.
Not liable
Another student felt that the
drug companies should not be
held liable for the recently

discovered side-effects of DES.
"However, they should offer
some financial support toward
locating other potential victims
of vaginal carcinoma,sinceearly
recognition facilitates treatment.
This action should not seem fi
nancially burdensome, in view
of the fact that virtually no

a
money was spent by American
pharmaceutical companies on
the development of DES."
Senior Dean Hashimoto of
fered a series of specific recom
mendations aimed at solving the
DES controversy and preventing
similar cases in the future.
"Ceilings should be set on the

amount for which a patient may
sue, and guidelines for new drug
development should be strictly
enforced. As long as these
guidelines are met, a phar
maceutical company should not
be held liable, since the patient
would have been made aware of
the possible risks associated
with the drug. In addition, a
limit should be set on the
amount a lawyer may receive
from a successful suit, in order to
eliminate the incentive for
ridiculously high claims."
Of the 56 students in the class,
28 responded that they would
sue over the DES issue while an
equal number indicated that
they would not. Among the wo
men, 15 answered yes and 18
no, while 13 men responded yes
and 10 indicated otherwise.
"Several students in the sam
ple were DES babies, and not one
of them indicated that they
would sue," added Djerassi.
Others susceptible
Djerassi pointed out that the
pharmaceutical companies are
not the only parties susceptible
to lawsuit over DES. "It is
foreseeable that victims of the
drug may consider suits against
their mothers, for making a deci
sion detrimental to their health.
Physicians might be sued for fai
lure to adequately warn patients
of the risks involved in taking
such a drug."

He continued, "This latter ac

the possible risks associated
with the drug. In addition, a
limit should be set on the
amount a lawyer may receive
from a successful suit, in order to
eliminate the incentive for
ridiculously high claims."
Of the 56 students in the class,
28 responded that they would
sue over the DES issue while an
equal number indicated that
they would not. Among the wo
men, 15 answered yes and 18
no, while 13 men responded yes
and 10 indicated otherwise.
"Several students in the sam
ple were DES babies, and not one
of them indicated that they
would sue," added Djerassi.
Others susceptible
Djerassi pointed out that the
pharmaceutical companies are
not the only parties susceptible
to lawsuit over DES. "It is
foreseeable that victims of the
drug may consider suits against
their mothers, for making a deci
sion detrimental to their health.
Physicians might be sued for fai
lure to adequately warn patients
of the risks involved in taking
such a drug."

He continued, "This latter ac
tion, if successful, would dis
courage other doctors from pre
scribing therapeutic agents for
fear of lawsuit. However, the pa
tient might then have sufficient
grounds to sue for denial of
treatment."
He added that successful suits
over the DES issue would have
tragic effects upon the future of
the pharmaceutical industry. "It
has been known for sometime
that estrogens are effective in
preventing arteriosclerosis in
men. With the incentive to de
velop a synthetic estrogen de
stroyed by fear of lawsuit, it is
unlikely that the clinical be
nefits of such an agent will ever
be realized."
Future implications
Djerassi projected the possible
future implications of DES suits
through reference to recent find
ings concerning several non
prescription drugs.
"Aspirin was shown to be
teratogenic in one study con
ducted with rabbits, while caf
feine induced stunted limbs re
sembling the Thalidomide syn
drome in another. The havoc
created by suits against man
ufacturers of such commonly
used drugs as these, if side
effects were proven in humans,
would be staggering," he con
cluded.

Future development of
therapeutic estrogens may be
jeopardized by the recent con
troversy over diethylstilbesterol
(DES), according to Chemistry
Prof. Carl Djerassi. His remarks
accompanied a student debate
on the DES issue in the course
"Biosocial Aspects of Hirth Con
trol" Feb. 9.
Diethylstilbesterol is a man
made version of one of the
natural female sex hormones, or
estrogens. The drug was widely
prescribed as an effective deter
rent to miscarriage from World
War II through the early 19605,
with no apparent side-effects.
However, since 1971 more
than 250 cases of a previously
rare vaginal adenocarcinoma
(cancer) have been registered by
researchers at Massachusetts
Ceneral Hospital in Boston. In
vestigation of IHO of the young
women involved revealed that
the mothers of at least 120 had
taken DES or related hormones
during the first 18 weeks of pre
gnancy.
The situation has prompted
many of the victims to file mas
sive damage suits against phar
maceutical companies which
marketed the drug. Although
none have reached the trial
stage, the potential liabiliy is
staggering, as researchers esti
mate that two million women
may have been exposed

to DES before Nov. 1971
when the FDA warned against
its use in pregnancy.
Questionnaire
In dealing with the justifica
tion for such suits, students in
Djerassi's course were required
to complete a questionnaire stat
ing their views on the issue.
Based on the responses, 12 indi
viduals were chosen to briefly
present their arguments to the
rest of the class.
Junior Marna Parke contended
that the research and develop
ment leading to the synthesis of
DES should have been more
stringently executed.
"The drug was introduced
prematurely in the United
States, following poor clinical
trials in Europe which lacked
adequate controls. Tests should
have been conducted on animals
whose metabolic processes re
semble those of man in order to
verify its safety," Parke said.
Junior Allison Brown main
tained that no drug should be
approved by the FDA unless it
has first been proven uncondi
tionally safe. "Side-effects dis
covered after approval should
warrant immediate removal of
the drug from the market until its
safety is reverified by further
testing," she commented.
Not liable
Another student felt that the
drug companies should not be
held liable for the recently

discovered side-effects of DES.
"However, they should offer
some financial support toward
locating other potential victims
of vaginal carcinoma,sinceearly
recognition facilitates treatment.
This action should not seem fi
nancially burdensome, in view
of the fact that virtually no

a
money was spent by American
pharmaceutical companies on
the development of DES."
Senior Dean Hashimoto of
fered a series of specific recom
mendations aimed at solving the
DES controversy and preventing
similar cases in the future.
"Ceilings should be set on the

amount for which a patient may
sue, and guidelines for new drug
development should be strictly
enforced. As long as these
guidelines are met, a phar
maceutical company should not
be held liable, since the patient
would have been made aware of
the possible risks associated
with the drug. In addition, a
limit should be set on the
amount a lawyer may receive
from a successful suit, in order to
eliminate the incentive for
ridiculously high claims."
