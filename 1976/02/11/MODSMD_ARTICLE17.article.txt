## Pac-8 predictions 
### 
Our prognosticator correctly tabbed five of
eight Pacific Eight games last week, which
dropped his season percentage one-one
thousandth of a point to . 632.
We'll give it another go this week as the
northern teams again meet the Calfornians,
this time in the Golden State.
Injuries are depleting Stanford's roster, and
the Cards will be fortunate to win either of their
two games against Oregon and Oregon State
this weekend at Maples Pavilion. Stanford
may surprise the Ducks, but the odds are
against it.
Now for the big one. Many a predictor has
bitten it trying to foresee the end of
UCLA's win streak in Pauley Pavilion, which
now stands at 95 games. But Washington,
undefeated on the road this season and 18-2
for the year, may do it in Saturday's tele

vised game starting at 3 p.m. Then again, the
Huskies may not, and UCLA will claim one
more unsuspecting prognosticator.
Savor USC's winless Pac-8 record while
you can, because the Trojans should beat
Washington State Saturday in Los Angeles,
proving that that stupid saying "all good things
must come to an end" is really true.
Look for Cal to sink the Ducks Friday in
Berkeley and lose to Oregon State Saturday.
