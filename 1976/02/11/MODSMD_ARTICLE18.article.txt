Baseball victory
The Stanford baseball team
demolished San Francisco State
yesterday, 15-4, in San Francisco
to bring its season record to 3-0.
The Cards scored six runs in
the fourth inning and three in
the fifth to put the game away as
Dave Johnson got the win in re
lief of starter Mike Williamson.
Williamson was removed after
two innings with a back injury

not believed to be serious.
Lefthander Jerry Argust
pitched three innings and was
credited with a save.
Freshman Larry Reynolds,
who started at cornerback on the
Card football team, led Stanford
with three hits and added two
runs-batted-in. Tom Guardino,
Dave Perez and Steve Davis all
had a pair of hits for the Cards.
Stanford will attempt to make
it four in a row today at 2:30
when the Cards host Santa Clara
at Sunken Diamond.
Wrestlers host Spartans
The Stanford wrestling team
hosts the San Jose State Spartans
tomorrow night at 7:30 in the last
dual meet of the season for the
Cardinals.
Coach Joe DeMeo invites all
and any wrestling enthusiasts to
come to the Encina Gym for what
he expects to be a "close and ex
citing" meet.
Although the Cards lost an
early season match with the
Spartans, DeMeo feels that this
time around "we're going to
win."
Why? "I feel we have a much
stronger and more experienced
team than last time," DeMeo re
plies. The return of seniors John
Govea and Gary Anderson, both
coming off injuries, also

strengthens the Stanford lineup.
On February 20 and 21, the
Cardinals journey north to Cor
vallis, Ore., for the Pacific Eight
Championships.
Volleyballers lose
The Stanford volleyball team
lost to UCLA, 15-6, 15-6, 15-4, to
UCLA last weekend at Pauley
Pavilion in Los Angeles. UCLA
is the defending NCAA champ
ion.
"We really didn't provide any
test for them as I hopes we
would," said coach Art Lambert.
The team returns to Los
Angeles Saturday to play USC at
the Sports Arena.
Sailors second
Paced by the performances of
junior Alan Andrews and
sophomore Peter Skinner, the
Stanford sailing team finished
second in the Northern Califor
nia Intercollegiate Sailing As
sociation standings last
weekend.
Tying for second Saturday and
placing second Sunday in the
first two events of the year at
Davis, the Cards are now only
one-half point out of first place
in season standings behind
Sonoma State. The Cards lead
UC-Santa Cruz by one-half point
and San Jose State by two.
In individual Laser competi
tion. Skinner stands in first
place, sophomore Hugh
Cullman stands second and
senior Walt Spevak seventh.
Spevak and Andrews combined
for a fifth place Saturday and a
third Sunday.
Still remaining on the sailing
schedule are seven NCISA regat
tas, the next hosted by Stanford
at Redwood City Feb. 21. In
October the team qualified to
represent the Pacific Coast Inter
collegiate Yacht Racing
Asssociation at the Yacht Racing
Invitational Regatta at King's
Point, N.Y., in April.


MIKE'S SPlKEâ€”Sophomore Mike Watt of the Stanford volleyball
team goes up to spike the ball against Humboldt State earlier this
year. Stanford was crunched by defending national champion
IJCLA last weekend in Los Angeles.
