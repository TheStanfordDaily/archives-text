# Frat member's objection postpones surcharge
## 
### Stephen Crolius 
A proposed $5 surcharge on every
University food commissary order of
less than $50 has been indefinitely
postponed in response to objections
from Inter-Fraternity Council Presi
dent Hob Ottilie.
The surcharge was scheduled to go
into effect Feb. 2. according to Com
missary Director Sterling Silver, but
then Ottilie objected.
Director of Housing Management Ed
Scoles said yesterday he anticipates no
trouble in resolving the difficult v. ad
ding. "It's not a big problem."
Small house problem
Hut Ottilie said. "I don't think the
small houses (would be able to) afford
to t.ike this. "I think it is a problem that
affects all the small houses."
Ottilie, Sigma Chi financial manager
Tim Port wood and Sigma Chi cook
Martin Rania met with Scoles Monday
to discuss the problem.
According to Silver, the surcharge
was expected to have limited scope.
Cutting cooks' visits
"We wanted ... to get a program
that would cut down on the cooks —
there are just a very few — who seem to
come down to the commissary once or

twice a day just to pick up something
that's been forgotten," Silver said.
"It's something that is a service
beyond the type of service that we had
in mind initially when we started 28
years ago," he added.
Ottilie said he saw the problem in
different terms.
"It's not a problem of bad ordering or
lack of foresight by the cook," he said.
"It's just that we order for the space we
have, *and we can't order for any
more."
Storage
He explained that storage space in
many of the small houses is limited.
Citing the Sigma Chi house as an
example, he noted that the house
freezer has only enough space for two
days' worth of food.
Ottilie suggested that three weekly
deliveries might alleviate the need for
extra orders in the middle of the week,
saying that Rania told him he would
"never have trt go in for extras if they
had three deliveries a week."
However. Ottilie warned that some
houses might be forced to find an al
ternative source of food if the sur
charge coes into effect.
