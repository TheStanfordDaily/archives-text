# Shuffling the Cards
## Big football goof 
### Chris Baker 
I know it's basketball season, but with
Stanford's chances of winning the
Pacific Eight cage title about as likely
as the Beatles, Jefferson Starship and the
Grateful Dead headlining a show in Stan
ford Stadium, it might be nice to take a
look at who is going to appear in the
Stadium this autumn.
It certainly won't be the Cardinal foot
ball squad. Someone over in the Athletic
Department must have a little egg on his
face.
You see, Stanford will play just four
home football games this year. And only
one of them will probably be a good draw
— the USC contest on Nov. 6. Three of
the contests are Pac-8 games —
Washington, Oregon State and Southern
California. The other game is the home
opener against San Jose State on Sept. 25.
Strange contract
When the NCAA allowed football
teams to add an 11th game, Stanford ag
reed to one of the strangest contracts out
side of the San Francisco Giants' agree
ment to lease Candlestick Park. The
Cards agreed to play one game against
Penn State at home and three back in
University Park, Pa.
Athletic Department officials figured
the Penn State game, the first of the year,
would be a bad home draw because Stan
ford is not in session. Playing in
football-crazy Beaver Stadium, where
Nittany Lion season tickets are always
sold out four months in advance, Stan

ford officials assumed the Cards would
take home a bigger check.
And they were right. In 1974 the Penn
State game drew a standing-room-only
crowd of 58,200 at Beaver Stadium. In
1975 the game drew 61,325, the largest
crowd ever to see Penn State
play in Beaver Stadium. Everyone
smiled all the way to the bank.
Michigan game switched
But then something else happened.
Michigan Athletic Director Don
Canham, who could probably find a way
to make a buck selling used Wolverine
practice uniforms, looked at his paltry
$75,000 check from the Michigan-
Stanford game at Stanford Stadium in
1974 and asked to have the 1975 contest
switched to Ann Arbor, where it would
probably draw 90,000. A crowd of 52,000
saw the 1974 game at Stanford.
Canham gave Stanford an offer it could
not refuse — a guarantee of $150,000.
This meant that Stanford will play three
consecutive games back in Michigan.
Then Army asked to have last year's
game switched to Stanford and the 1976
contest moved to West Point because of a
schedule conflict. Finally, someone in
the Stanford Athletic Department took a
lookat the 1976 grid schedule, which has
been planned through 1986, and disco
vered that the Cards would only visit
Stanford Stadium four times this year.
Something had to be done.
So Athletic Director Joe Ruetz asked

Penn State Athletic Director Edward
Czekaj to move this year's game to Stan
ford. In a letter received a couple of
weeks ago, Czekaj refused the offer, say
ing that he had promised Penn State stu
dents seven home games.
To make matters worse, ABC, which
televised the Stanford- Penn State game
here in 1973 and from remote University
Park in 1974, probably won't televise this
year's game from Penn State. It seems
that ABC officials had trouble finding
lodging in University Park and getting
the television equipment into Beaver
Stadium.
That leaves Stanford fans with the
prospect of four home football games. Of
course one of the road games is the Big
Game in Berkeley and another is the
UCLA contest in Los Angeles, so it may
not be all that bad.
Home advantage
Card football Asst. Coach Norb Hecker
says, "Of course, you always like to play
at home. It's more difficult to play on the
road whether it's in Berkeley or in Penn
State."
A tour-game home slate won't happen
again, says Assoc. Athletic Director Bob
Young, who is currently planning the
Stanford football schedule through 1990.
"We've had some flack from our Athletic
Board," says Young. "But the season tic
ket price will be less."
One road game I wouldn't mind is one
in Pasadena on New Year's Day.
