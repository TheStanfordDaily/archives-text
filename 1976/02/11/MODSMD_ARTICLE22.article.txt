Scandal hurts foreign leaders
WASHINGTON — Lockheed Aircraft Corp.'s
admission that it paid $22 million to foreign offi
cials and businessmen threatened yesterday the fu
ture of the Japanese government and the Dutch
monarchy and hampered efforts to form a new Ita
lian cabinet.
The scandal also set off official inquiries or calls
for such inquiries in Colombia and Turkey.
The leading Japanese opposition party, the
Socialists, demanded that a former prime minister
be added to the eight men already summoned to
testify under oath before a committee of parliament.
The Socialist chairman said Prime Minister
Takeo Miki's Liberal-Democratic cabinet would be
forced to resign if the Lockheed affair was
thoroughly probed.
The Dutch government appointed a three-man
commission to investigate allegations that Prince
Bernhard, the (34-year-old husband of Queen
Juliana, received $1.1 million of the Lockheed
money. He has denied the accusations and said he
welcomes an inquiry.
President Lord condemned any illegal payments
by American firms overseas, and Press Secretary
Ron Nessen said the President is leaning toward the
idea of establishing a cabinet-level committee to
review the practices of U.S. corporations and
applicable laws.

Spying curbs proposed
WASHINGTON — Wrapping up its year-long in
vestigation, the Select House Intelligence Commit
tee approved recommendations yesterday to out
law or abolish some intelligence operations and
impose stiff congressional controls over the rest.
Major recommendations would create a perma
nent watchdog House intelligence committee and
require presidents to report every covert operation
to it within 48 hours.
They also would outlaw covert U.S. aid to foreign
fighting forces such as those in Angola except in
time of war and also outlaw assassination attempts.
Just before final approval by a 9-4 vote yesterday,
the committee rejected a recommendation to split
the CIA in two, with one agency to gather and
analyze intelligence and a second to conduct es
pionage and covert operations.
The committee also recommended abolition of
the FBl's Internal Security branch and limits on the
use of newsmen, clergymen and educators in intel
ligence operations.
The House has blocked public release of the
committee's separate report because it contains de
tails on secret U.S. covert operations, and House
leaders still have not decided what to do with the
report itself.
Ford signs defense bill
WASHINGTON — Expressing deep disappoint

ment at a provision prohibiting military funds for
Angola, President Ford yesterday signed a com
promise $112.3 billion defense appropriation.
The measure provides money for defense opera
tions for the 15-month period which ends Sept. 30
and is $8.6 billion less than Ford had originally
requested.
It includes money for further development of the
controversial HI bomber and the acquisition of four
airborne warning and control system aircraft.
The most controversial section was the ban on
U.S. military assistance to Angola, where rival fac
tions .are engaged in a civil war and where a
Soviet-backed group appears to be gaining the
upper haud.
"I am deeply disappointed that the Congress has
acted in this bill to deprive the people of Angola of
the assistance needed to resist Soviet and Cuban
military intervention in the country," Ford said. "I
believe this provision is an extremely undesirable
precedent that could limit severely our ability to
play a positive and effective role in international
affairs."
Africans recognize MPLA
The Organization of African Unity (OAU) has
recognized the Soviet-backed faction as the sole
government of war-torn Angola, OAU chairman Idi
Amin said yesterday. The move handed Western
supported factions a diplomatic defeat on top of
battlefield reverses.
Amin, president of Uganda, in a broadcast by
radio that was monitored in Nairobi, said recogni
tion by a majority of OAU member states automati
cally settled the question of which faction legiti
mately represents Angola in international affairs.
The diplomatic defeat for UNITA and FNLA fol
lowed a series of battlefield reverses at the hands of
Soviet-equipped MPLA forces led by 11.000 Cuban
troops. UNITA has confirmed the fall of Huambo,
its capital in south central Angola, and the FNLA
has virtually been pushed out of Angola in the
north.
In Washington, President Ford was quoted by the
Washington Staras saying congressional refusal to
support his request for American aid to Angola
demonstrates that "they've lost their guts."
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow but with local morning
fog. Mild afternoon temperatures. Lows tonight
mid 30s to low 40s. Highs today and tomorrow in
upper 50s to mid 60s. Light winds.

Spying curbs proposed
WASHINGTON — Wrapping up its year-long in
vestigation, the Select House Intelligence Commit
tee approved recommendations yesterday to out
law or abolish some intelligence operations and
impose stiff congressional controls over the rest.
Major recommendations would create a perma
nent watchdog House intelligence committee and
require presidents to report every covert operation
to it within 48 hours.
They also would outlaw covert U.S. aid to foreign
fighting forces such as those in Angola except in
time of war and also outlaw assassination attempts.
Just before final approval by a 9-4 vote yesterday,
the committee rejected a recommendation to split
the CIA in two, with one agency to gather and
analyze intelligence and a second to conduct es
pionage and covert operations.
The committee also recommended abolition of
the FBl's Internal Security branch and limits on the
use of newsmen, clergymen and educators in intel
ligence operations.
The House has blocked public release of the
committee's separate report because it contains de
tails on secret U.S. covert operations, and House
leaders still have not decided what to do with the
report itself.
Ford signs defense bill
WASHINGTON — Expressing deep disappoint

ment at a provision prohibiting military funds for
Angola, President Ford yesterday signed a com
promise $112.3 billion defense appropriation.
The measure provides money for defense opera
tions for the 15-month period which ends Sept. 30
and is $8.6 billion less than Ford had originally
requested.
It includes money for further development of the
controversial HI bomber and the acquisition of four
airborne warning and control system aircraft.
The most controversial section was the ban on
U.S. military assistance to Angola, where rival fac
tions .are engaged in a civil war and where a
Soviet-backed group appears to be gaining the
upper haud.
"I am deeply disappointed that the Congress has
acted in this bill to deprive the people of Angola of
the assistance needed to resist Soviet and Cuban
military intervention in the country," Ford said. "I
believe this provision is an extremely undesirable
precedent that could limit severely our ability to
play a positive and effective role in international
affairs."
Africans recognize MPLA
The Organization of African Unity (OAU) has
recognized the Soviet-backed faction as the sole
government of war-torn Angola, OAU chairman Idi
Amin said yesterday. The move handed Western
supported factions a diplomatic defeat on top of
battlefield reverses.
Amin, president of Uganda, in a broadcast by
radio that was monitored in Nairobi, said recogni
tion by a majority of OAU member states automati
cally settled the question of which faction legiti
mately represents Angola in international affairs.
The diplomatic defeat for UNITA and FNLA fol
lowed a series of battlefield reverses at the hands of
Soviet-equipped MPLA forces led by 11.000 Cuban
troops. UNITA has confirmed the fall of Huambo,
its capital in south central Angola, and the FNLA
has virtually been pushed out of Angola in the
north.
In Washington, President Ford was quoted by the
Washington Staras saying congressional refusal to
support his request for American aid to Angola
demonstrates that "they've lost their guts."

Scandal hurts foreign leaders
WASHINGTON — Lockheed Aircraft Corp.'s
admission that it paid $22 million to foreign offi
cials and businessmen threatened yesterday the fu
ture of the Japanese government and the Dutch
monarchy and hampered efforts to form a new Ita
lian cabinet.
The scandal also set off official inquiries or calls
for such inquiries in Colombia and Turkey.
The leading Japanese opposition party, the
Socialists, demanded that a former prime minister
be added to the eight men already summoned to
testify under oath before a committee of parliament.
The Socialist chairman said Prime Minister
Takeo Miki's Liberal-Democratic cabinet would be
forced to resign if the Lockheed affair was
thoroughly probed.
The Dutch government appointed a three-man
commission to investigate allegations that Prince
Bernhard, the (34-year-old husband of Queen
Juliana, received $1.1 million of the Lockheed
money. He has denied the accusations and said he
welcomes an inquiry.
President Lord condemned any illegal payments
by American firms overseas, and Press Secretary
Ron Nessen said the President is leaning toward the
idea of establishing a cabinet-level committee to
review the practices of U.S. corporations and
