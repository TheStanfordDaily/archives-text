# Linen service to refund $2
## 
### 
Rebates will be given to customers whose
linen exchanges were interrupted by last quar
ter's strike, National Linen Service official
Alex McGregor said yesterday.
McGregor originally said that rebates would
not be given because it was the laundry drivers
for National Linen and not the company itself
that went on strike.
"We don't feel that we broke our contract with
the students," McGregor said last week.
However, after speaking last Friday with Alan
Gummings, manager of the student housing of
fice, McGregor changed his mind. "YY'e started
looking at it from the students' point of view and
said 'Let's take another look at this thing,"' he
said.
He added that he received several letters from
studnnts that "told me where to go" shortly after

the students learned that rebates would not be
given.
However, "this had no bearing on our chang
ing our minds," McGregor said. "It was a case
where we felt very strongly that we were right,
but when we talked it over, we changed our
minds."
The rebates will be given as soon as possible
and will be handled in one of two ways. The $2
checks will either be mailed directly to the stu
dents,or the checks will be given to Kim Hast
ings, student manager for the linen service, to
distribute to them.
McGregor said that students will not need to
fill out any forms in order to receive their re
bates. "The names will be taken directly from
our master list," he added. "We hope this will
make everyone happy."
