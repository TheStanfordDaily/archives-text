# Prosecution witness testifies
## Hearst stole 'willingly' 
### Don Cox 
A prosecution witness testified yes
terday that Patricia Hearst told him she
was a willing participant in the Sym
bionese Liberation Army's (SLA) April
15,1974, Hibernia Bank robbery inSan
Francisco.
Thomas Matthews, kidnaped by
the SLA in Los Angeles May 16,1974,
as they stole his van truck, said Hearst
told him she had taken an active part in
the robbery and had not been under the
guns of SLA members.
"She stated that all of the publicity
she had heard at the time was false and
that she was a willing participant," he
said.
"Patty Hearst said she had heard a

lot of publicity that she was tied to the
gun and that people were pointing
guns at her and that this was all false,"
Matthews testified.
Matthews said Hearst told him that
during the robbery SLA members
"weren't supposed to turn their guns
more than a certain number of degrees
so that if they started firing, they
wouldn't shoot each other."
Hearst said all of this "matter-of
factly," he said.
Closed hearing
The testimony came during a con
tinuing hearing, closed to the jury, to
determine the admissibility of certain
evidence. Chief defense counsel F. Lee
Bailey is seeking to block the introdu

tion of a SLA tape recording, a note by
Hearst relating to a later bank robbery
in Sacramento and testimony of wit
nesses connected with the shooting in
front of Mel's Sporting Goods store in
Los Angeles.
Hearst, accompanied by Emily and
William Harris, fled following the
shooting at Mel's Sporting Goods
store. Earlier in the day they stole
Matthew's van, police allege.
Hearst allegedly fired a burst of au
tomatic weapons fire at the storefront
to help free William Harris, accused of
shoplifting by the store clerk.
Matthews said Hearst told him "she
had shot at the store when she saw her
in trouble across the street.
She stated it was a "good feeling' to see
her comrades running away across the
street."
Hearst 'provided cover'
The store clerk, Anthony Shepard,
testified earlier in the day that it was
Hearst who sprayed the machine gun
fire across the storefront to provide
cover for Harris' escape.
In testimony of her own, Hearst did
not deny firing the gun. However, she
claimed that she was under duress and
in fear of being killed by the SLA if she
did not do as told.
Shepard, who pursued the trio in his
car, said he never saw the Harrises
push her or pull her. threaten her, give
her commands, order her around or
point their guns at her.
Matthews testified, however that
Hearst did show some concern for his
comfort during his 12 hours in the
SLA's captivity. "She patted me on the
head and asked me if 1 was all right,"
he said. "I know she did this at least
twice, but it might have been four or
five times."
Alone with Hearst?
He said he thought he was alone
with Hearst in the van at one time
when the Harrises were out looking for
a house to spend the night in.
However, under cross-examination
by Bailey, Matthews admitted that he
was covered up and could not see any
thing and could not be sure how far
away, if at all, the Harrises were from
the van.
The prosecution has contended that
Hearst had a number of occasions to
escape if she desired.
Government plan
The government had planned to
have three witnesses testify yesterday
about their meetings with Hearst when
she was with the SLA. However, the
three refused to testify on Fifth
Amendment grounds of self
incrimination.
The government gave the three —
Jamella Muntaz, Ronald Tate and Re

timah X — immunity, and the judge
ordered one to answer questions put to
her,but she refused. All of the trial's
afternoon session was spent in legal
skirmishes between the government
and attorneys for the three witnesses.
Bailey walks out
At one point. Bailey walked out of
the courtroom in exasperation over the
legal wrangling. He objected that "the
defendant is the one on trial," rather
than the three witnesses and that
"these arguments could go on inter
minably." While the judge sym
pathized, Bailey was nonetheless
overruled.
The witnesses were neighbors in the
predominantly black section of San
Francisco where Hearst lived for sev
eral months, the Associated Press re
ported.
The witnesses, who are said to havl
helped the fugitive SLA group with
provisions and cars, were invited to
meet Hearst by SLA field marshall
Donald "Cinque" DeFreeze. The three
reportedly have said Hearst looked
happy at the time and spoke openly of
her exploits as a revolutionary, the AP
reported.

The government gave the three —
Jamella Muntaz, Ronald Tate and Re

ordered one to answer questions put to
her,but she refused. All of the trial's
afternoon session was spent in legal
skirmishes between the government
and attorneys for the three witnesses.
Bailey walks out
At one point. Bailey walked out of
the courtroom in exasperation over the
legal wrangling. He objected that "the
defendant is the one on trial," rather
than the three witnesses and that
"these arguments could go on inter
minably." While the judge sym
pathized, Bailey was nonetheless
overruled.
The witnesses were neighbors in the
predominantly black section of San
Francisco where Hearst lived for sev
eral months, the Associated Press re
ported.
The witnesses, who are said to havl
helped the fugitive SLA group with
provisions and cars, were invited to
meet Hearst by SLA field marshall
Donald "Cinque" DeFreeze. The three
reportedly have said Hearst looked
happy at the time and spoke openly of
her exploits as a revolutionary, the AP
reported.
A prosecution witness testified yes
terday that Patricia Hearst told him she
was a willing participant in the Sym
bionese Liberation Army's (SLA) April
15,1974, Hibernia Bank robbery inSan
Francisco.
Thomas Matthews, kidnaped by
the SLA in Los Angeles May 16,1974,
as they stole his van truck, said Hearst
told him she had taken an active part in
the robbery and had not been under the
guns of SLA members.
"She stated that all of the publicity
she had heard at the time was false and
that she was a willing participant," he
said.
"Patty Hearst said she had heard a

lot of publicity that she was tied to the
gun and that people were pointing
guns at her and that this was all false,"
Matthews testified.
Matthews said Hearst told him that
during the robbery SLA members
"weren't supposed to turn their guns
more than a certain number of degrees
so that if they started firing, they
wouldn't shoot each other."
Hearst said all of this "matter-of
factly," he said.
Closed hearing
The testimony came during a con
tinuing hearing, closed to the jury, to
determine the admissibility of certain
evidence. Chief defense counsel F. Lee
Bailey is seeking to block the introdu

tion of a SLA tape recording, a note by
Hearst relating to a later bank robbery
in Sacramento and testimony of wit
nesses connected with the shooting in
front of Mel's Sporting Goods store in
Los Angeles.
Hearst, accompanied by Emily and
William Harris, fled following the
shooting at Mel's Sporting Goods
store. Earlier in the day they stole
Matthew's van, police allege.
Hearst allegedly fired a burst of au
tomatic weapons fire at the storefront
to help free William Harris, accused of
shoplifting by the store clerk.
Matthews said Hearst told him "she
had shot at the store when she saw her
in trouble across the street.
She stated it was a "good feeling' to see
her comrades running away across the
street."
Hearst 'provided cover'
The store clerk, Anthony Shepard,
testified earlier in the day that it was
Hearst who sprayed the machine gun
fire across the storefront to provide
cover for Harris' escape.
In testimony of her own, Hearst did
not deny firing the gun. However, she
claimed that she was under duress and
in fear of being killed by the SLA if she
did not do as told.
Shepard, who pursued the trio in his
car, said he never saw the Harrises
push her or pull her. threaten her, give
her commands, order her around or
point their guns at her.
Matthews testified, however that
Hearst did show some concern for his
comfort during his 12 hours in the
SLA's captivity. "She patted me on the
head and asked me if 1 was all right,"
he said. "I know she did this at least
twice, but it might have been four or
five times."
Alone with Hearst?
He said he thought he was alone
with Hearst in the van at one time
when the Harrises were out looking for
a house to spend the night in.
However, under cross-examination
by Bailey, Matthews admitted that he
was covered up and could not see any
thing and could not be sure how far
away, if at all, the Harrises were from
the van.
The prosecution has contended that
Hearst had a number of occasions to
escape if she desired.

The government had planned to
have three witnesses testify yesterday
about their meetings with Hearst when
she was with the SLA. However, the
three refused to testify on Fifth

point their guns at her.
Matthews testified, however that
Hearst did show some concern for his
comfort during his 12 hours in the
SLA's captivity. "She patted me on the
head and asked me if 1 was all right,"
he said. "I know she did this at least
twice, but it might have been four or
five times."
Alone with Hearst?
He said he thought he was alone
with Hearst in the van at one time
when the Harrises were out looking for
a house to spend the night in.
However, under cross-examination
by Bailey, Matthews admitted that he
was covered up and could not see any
thing and could not be sure how far
away, if at all, the Harrises were from
the van.
The prosecution has contended that
Hearst had a number of occasions to
escape if she desired.
Government plan
The government had planned to
have three witnesses testify yesterday
about their meetings with Hearst when
she was with the SLA. However, the
three refused to testify on Fifth
Amendment grounds of self
incrimination.
The government gave the three —
Jamella Muntaz, Ronald Tate and Re

timah X — immunity, and the judge
ordered one to answer questions put to
her,but she refused. All of the trial's
afternoon session was spent in legal
skirmishes between the government
and attorneys for the three witnesses.
Bailey walks out
At one point. Bailey walked out of
the courtroom in exasperation over the
legal wrangling. He objected that "the
defendant is the one on trial," rather
than the three witnesses and that
"these arguments could go on inter
minably." While the judge sym
pathized, Bailey was nonetheless
overruled.
The witnesses were neighbors in the
predominantly black section of San
Francisco where Hearst lived for sev
eral months, the Associated Press re
ported.
The witnesses, who are said to havl
helped the fugitive SLA group with
provisions and cars, were invited to
meet Hearst by SLA field marshall
Donald "Cinque" DeFreeze. The three
reportedly have said Hearst looked
happy at the time and spoke openly of
her exploits as a revolutionary, the AP
reported.
