# Senate to invite radical thinkers
## 
### Marc Strassman Lori Matsukawa 
The ASSU Senate voted 12-3 last
night to invite Angela Davis, Ernest
Mandel and Claude Steiner to be
ASSU guest professors during spring
quarter.
"We're very happy with the deci
sion, and we hope we can get coopera
tion from the various departments to
get the courses listed with them so as
many students as possible will be able
to take the courses," said Andrea Hal
liday, a senior in psychology and
philosophy and a member of the Guest
Professorship Board. The board re
commended the trio to the senate.
Sen. Bill Tyndall, a board member,
introduced the resolution to invite
Davis, Mandel and Steiner.
Plans are for Steiner, a clinical
psychologist and author of Games Al
coholics Play and Scripts People Live,
to teach a course on the history and
future of psychiatry.
Miller approval?
However, all three nominees must
accept their invitations, and their
courses must be listed for credit by the
appropriate department. Whether
Provost William Miller will need to
approve any matters concerning the
guest professors has not been deter
mined, Halliday said.
Mandel, editor of a newspaper in
Belgium, would teach three courses on
political economy. One would deal
with the economic and political his
tory of labor movements in Europe,
another with the postwar economy
and the third with multinational cor
porations and the nation-state.
Davis, philosopher and activist,
would teach a course entitled, "The
Pemale Condition: The Search for a
Marxist Approach."
Sens. Carole Houck, Bob Ottilie and
Kevin McDermott opposed the resolu
tion.
'Bigger range'
Houck said shethought there should
be a "bigger range" of political views
represented among the guest profes
sors.
Ottilie agreed that there was not
enough variety in the proposed
choices. Then he mused, "There's a
Marxist, a Trotskyist, and a radical. I
guess we are balancing all the kinds of
communists."
He disagreed with the choices, how
ever, saying "we've got to sell this to
the students, and this won't do it."
'Radical mastectomy'
Halliday replied that Ottilie's state
ment indicated things have reached
the point where "you think someone
who performs a radical mastectomy is
a communist."
Tyndall also disagreed with Ottilie's
contention adding, that the three
nominees were alike in their views,
adding, "they still won't balance the
hundreds of conservative and liberal
professors on the campus."
Blythe Mickelson, a board member,
described the board's criteria for
selecting guest professors:
—prominence as a social or political
figure;
—wide academic appeal, specifi
cally in an otherwise under
represented field; and
— willingness to interact with stu
dents.
Sen. Brad Krevov suggested Univer
sity financial supporters might oppose
the appointments, saying that UCLA

lost $2 million in endowments as a
result of Davis* presence on the fa
culty.
'Sad comment'
Halliday responded that if the senate
refused to approve the nominees on
that basis, "it would really be a sad
comment for the senate to make."
Asked if the administration can do
anything to block the appointment,
Mickelson replied, "not that we know
of."
She explained later that if these
short-term appointments passed
through the usual channels, the board
isn't "aware of any other way the ad
ministration could block" the guest
professors from coming.
However, she said, there is some
possibility the University might stop
the appointments.
Tenure system condemned
In other action, the senate approved
8-5 a resolution "condemning" the
University tenure system "to the ex
tent that it deemphasizes the teaching
ability of candidates." The resolution
called for Miller to come before the
body to answer questions claryfing
university tenure process.
Following the vote, Tyndall, the re
solution's author, received senate ap
proval to reword the resolution and
bring it to the Feb. 23 senate meeting
for final consideration.
Houck, opposing the resolution,
said the senate should not condemn a
system it does not fully understand.
Tyndall explained, "We wanted a
firm ASSU opinion to take to a (non
publicized) meeting tomorrow of con
cerned students discussing tenure."
Sen. Bill Washburn called the resol
ution "naive."
Tenure system 'central'
"The tenure system is very central to
this institution. It makes it what it is.

ding to the frustration of faculty and
administration," said Washburn.
"1 don't believe the possibility for
tenure exists. It's just not worth creat
ing all this fuss," Washburn added.
Tbe senate also approved a resolution
supporting a student-planned shuttle
bus route to run between the hours of 6
p.m. and 12:15 a.m.
"There will be two buses, each going
in opposite directions, and the stops
will be near fire boxes so in case of an
emergency, one can pul 1 the alarm for
help," explained Sen. Sarah Alfadl.
Circling campus
The proposed route circles the cam
pus, passes all main residential areas
and could be started "sometime next
week," Alfadl said.

The Senate Finance Committee's in
formal resolution to hire a professional
investment firm to invest ASSU funds
was postponed until next meeting due
to the absence of committee chairman
McDermott and Financial Manager
Chris Cline.
A "final chapter" report from the
Senate Mascot Selection Committee
said due to "lack of attendance (at
meetings) and general disinterest" in
the mascot issue, the committee ag
reed that "Stanford's mascot should
grow on its own, naturally" and that
any attempt to bring back the Indian
would "not ever be considered."
"If the students really want the Rob
ber Barons or Trees they have to start
using it. Cet the Uailv to start using it

be a "bigger range" of political views
represented among the guest profes
sors.
Ottilie agreed that there was not
enough variety in the proposed
choices. Then he mused, "There's a
Marxist, a Trotskyist, and a radical. I
guess we are balancing all the kinds of
communists."
He disagreed with the choices, how
ever, saying "we've got to sell this to
the students, and this won't do it."
'Radical mastectomy'
Halliday replied that Ottilie's state
ment indicated things have reached
the point where "you think someone
who performs a radical mastectomy is
a communist."
Tyndall also disagreed with Ottilie's
contention adding, that the three
nominees were alike in their views,
adding, "they still won't balance the
hundreds of conservative and liberal
professors on the campus."
Blythe Mickelson, a board member,
described the board's criteria for
selecting guest professors:
—prominence as a social or political
figure;
—wide academic appeal, specifi
cally in an otherwise under
represented field; and
— willingness to interact with stu
dents.
Sen. Brad Krevov suggested Univer
sity financial supporters might oppose
the appointments, saying that UCLA

lost $2 million in endowments as a
result of Davis* presence on the fa
culty.
'Sad comment'
Halliday responded that if the senate
refused to approve the nominees on
that basis, "it would really be a sad
comment for the senate to make."
Asked if the administration can do
anything to block the appointment,
Mickelson replied, "not that we know
of."
She explained later that if these
short-term appointments passed
through the usual channels, the board
isn't "aware of any other way the ad
ministration could block" the guest
professors from coming.
However, she said, there is some
possibility the University might stop
the appointments.
Tenure system condemned
In other action, the senate approved
8-5 a resolution "condemning" the
University tenure system "to the ex
tent that it deemphasizes the teaching
ability of candidates." The resolution
called for Miller to come before the
body to answer questions claryfing
university tenure process.
Following the vote, Tyndall, the re
solution's author, received senate ap
proval to reword the resolution and
bring it to the Feb. 23 senate meeting
for final consideration.
Houck, opposing the resolution,
said the senate should not condemn a
system it does not fully understand.
Tyndall explained, "We wanted a
firm ASSU opinion to take to a (non
publicized) meeting tomorrow of con
cerned students discussing tenure."
Sen. Bill Washburn called the resol
ution "naive."
Tenure system 'central'
"The tenure system is very central to
this institution. It makes it what it is.

ding to the frustration of faculty and
administration," said Washburn.
"1 don't believe the possibility for
tenure exists. It's just not worth creat
ing all this fuss," Washburn added.
Tbe senate also approved a resolution
supporting a student-planned shuttle
bus route to run between the hours of 6
p.m. and 12:15 a.m.
"There will be two buses, each going
in opposite directions, and the stops
will be near fire boxes so in case of an
emergency, one can pul 1 the alarm for
help," explained Sen. Sarah Alfadl.
Circling campus
The proposed route circles the cam
pus, passes all main residential areas
and could be started "sometime next
week," Alfadl said.

The Senate Finance Committee's in
formal resolution to hire a professional
investment firm to invest ASSU funds
was postponed until next meeting due
to the absence of committee chairman
McDermott and Financial Manager
Chris Cline.
A "final chapter" report from the
Senate Mascot Selection Committee
said due to "lack of attendance (at
meetings) and general disinterest" in
the mascot issue, the committee ag
reed that "Stanford's mascot should
grow on its own, naturally" and that
any attempt to bring back the Indian
would "not ever be considered."
"If the students really want the Rob
ber Barons or Trees they have to start
using it. Cet the Uailv to start using it
said Sen. Tim Conway.
The ASSU Senate voted 12-3 last
night to invite Angela Davis, Ernest
Mandel and Claude Steiner to be
ASSU guest professors during spring
quarter.
"We're very happy with the deci
sion, and we hope we can get coopera
tion from the various departments to
get the courses listed with them so as
many students as possible will be able
to take the courses," said Andrea Hal
liday, a senior in psychology and
philosophy and a member of the Guest
Professorship Board. The board re
commended the trio to the senate.
Sen. Bill Tyndall, a board member,
introduced the resolution to invite
Davis, Mandel and Steiner.
Plans are for Steiner, a clinical
psychologist and author of Games Al
coholics Play and Scripts People Live,
to teach a course on the history and
future of psychiatry.
Miller approval?
However, all three nominees must
accept their invitations, and their
courses must be listed for credit by the
appropriate department. Whether
Provost William Miller will need to
approve any matters concerning the
guest professors has not been deter
mined, Halliday said.
Mandel, editor of a newspaper in
Belgium, would teach three courses on
political economy. One would deal
with the economic and political his
tory of labor movements in Europe,
another with the postwar economy
and the third with multinational cor
porations and the nation-state.
Davis, philosopher and activist,
would teach a course entitled, "The
Pemale Condition: The Search for a
Marxist Approach."
Sens. Carole Houck, Bob Ottilie and

short-term appointments passed
through the usual channels, the board
isn't "aware of any other way the ad
ministration could block" the guest
professors from coming.
However, she said, there is some
possibility the University might stop
the appointments.
Tenure system condemned
In other action, the senate approved
8-5 a resolution "condemning" the
University tenure system "to the ex
tent that it deemphasizes the teaching
ability of candidates." The resolution
called for Miller to come before the
body to answer questions claryfing
university tenure process.
Following the vote, Tyndall, the re
solution's author, received senate ap
proval to reword the resolution and
bring it to the Feb. 23 senate meeting
for final consideration.
Houck, opposing the resolution,
said the senate should not condemn a
system it does not fully understand.
Tyndall explained, "We wanted a
firm ASSU opinion to take to a (non
publicized) meeting tomorrow of con
cerned students discussing tenure."
Sen. Bill Washburn called the resol
ution "naive."
Tenure system 'central'
"The tenure system is very central to
this institution. It makes it what it is.

ding to the frustration of faculty and
administration," said Washburn.
"1 don't believe the possibility for
tenure exists. It's just not worth creat
ing all this fuss," Washburn added.
Tbe senate also approved a resolution
supporting a student-planned shuttle
bus route to run between the hours of 6
p.m. and 12:15 a.m.
"There will be two buses, each going
in opposite directions, and the stops
will be near fire boxes so in case of an
emergency, one can pul 1 the alarm for
help," explained Sen. Sarah Alfadl.
Circling campus
The proposed route circles the cam
pus, passes all main residential areas
and could be started "sometime next
week," Alfadl said.

The Senate Finance Committee's in
formal resolution to hire a professional
investment firm to invest ASSU funds
was postponed until next meeting due
to the absence of committee chairman
McDermott and Financial Manager
Chris Cline.
A "final chapter" report from the
Senate Mascot Selection Committee
said due to "lack of attendance (at
meetings) and general disinterest" in
the mascot issue, the committee ag
reed that "Stanford's mascot should
grow on its own, naturally" and that
any attempt to bring back the Indian
would "not ever be considered."
"If the students really want the Rob
ber Barons or Trees they have to start
using it. Cet the Uailv to start using it
said Sen. Tim Conway.
The ASSU Senate voted 12-3 last
night to invite Angela Davis, Ernest
Mandel and Claude Steiner to be
ASSU guest professors during spring
quarter.
"We're very happy with the deci
sion, and we hope we can get coopera
tion from the various departments to
get the courses listed with them so as
many students as possible will be able
to take the courses," said Andrea Hal
liday, a senior in psychology and
philosophy and a member of the Guest
Professorship Board. The board re
commended the trio to the senate.
Sen. Bill Tyndall, a board member,
introduced the resolution to invite
Davis, Mandel and Steiner.
Plans are for Steiner, a clinical
psychologist and author of Games Al
coholics Play and Scripts People Live,
to teach a course on the history and
future of psychiatry.
Miller approval?
However, all three nominees must
accept their invitations, and their
courses must be listed for credit by the
appropriate department. Whether
Provost William Miller will need to
approve any matters concerning the
guest professors has not been deter
mined, Halliday said.
Mandel, editor of a newspaper in
Belgium, would teach three courses on
political economy. One would deal
with the economic and political his
tory of labor movements in Europe,
another with the postwar economy
and the third with multinational cor
porations and the nation-state.
Davis, philosopher and activist,
would teach a course entitled, "The
Pemale Condition: The Search for a
Marxist Approach."
Sens. Carole Houck, Bob Ottilie and
Kevin McDermott opposed the resolu
tion.
'Bigger range'
Houck said shethought there should
be a "bigger range" of political views
represented among the guest profes
sors.
Ottilie agreed that there was not
enough variety in the proposed
choices. Then he mused, "There's a
Marxist, a Trotskyist, and a radical. I
guess we are balancing all the kinds of
communists."
He disagreed with the choices, how
ever, saying "we've got to sell this to
the students, and this won't do it."
'Radical mastectomy'
Halliday replied that Ottilie's state
ment indicated things have reached
the point where "you think someone
who performs a radical mastectomy is
a communist."
Tyndall also disagreed with Ottilie's
contention adding, that the three
nominees were alike in their views,
adding, "they still won't balance the
hundreds of conservative and liberal
professors on the campus."
Blythe Mickelson, a board member,
described the board's criteria for
selecting guest professors:
—prominence as a social or political
figure;
—wide academic appeal, specifi
cally in an otherwise under
represented field; and
— willingness to interact with stu
dents.
Sen. Brad Krevov suggested Univer
sity financial supporters might oppose
the appointments, saying that UCLA

lost $2 million in endowments as a
result of Davis* presence on the fa
culty.
'Sad comment'
Halliday responded that if the senate
refused to approve the nominees on
that basis, "it would really be a sad
comment for the senate to make."
Asked if the administration can do
anything to block the appointment,
Mickelson replied, "not that we know
of."
She explained later that if these
short-term appointments passed
through the usual channels, the board
isn't "aware of any other way the ad
