# Career center policy
## Lyons weighs gay issue 
### William Ross 
The University probably would
have opposed any recommendation by
the Committee on Services to Students
(COSS) that employers who discrimi
nate against gays be kept from using
the Career Planning and Placement
Center, according to Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus Con
ference. Lyons.an ex officio member of
COSS, explained that such a ban
would have "intruded on the free
choices of students" by denying them
the opportunity to seek jobs with dis
criminatory firms.
Although Lyons acknowledged that
such a ban might have helped discour
age discrimination against gays, he
said that "the University would be
very careful before it withheld any
thing only for a policy end."
Lyons said he hopes that gays who
might complain that the recommenda
tion did not go far enough will realize
that changing the attitude of the Stan
ford community may be more impor
tant than changing attitudes of firms
that discriminate auainst uavs

"There is plenty of work to be done
here without using the University
policies as a level for change," Lyons
said.
Lyons praised the COSS recommen
dation for taking what he called a
strong stand against discrimination
against gays.
"I would hope that the COSS report
would make the University more sen
sitive to the fact that homosexuality is
a situation faced by many of our stu
dents," Lyons said. "It can be an ex
traordinarily painful experience when
one seeks a iob."
'Discrimination occuring'
Noting that "invidious job discrimi
nation" has been occurring, Lyons
said he hoped the COSS report "will
make a dent in this."
Lyons said, however, that he would
have preferred that the committee
have used the word "ask" rather than
"require" in reference to a question
naire about job discrimination that it
recommended employers be forced to
complete.
"Most companies are already be
sieged by requirements." Lyons said.

He said that a mild request might
also have been more effective in en
couraging employers to stop dis
criminating on the basis of sexual pre
ference.
No truth monitor
Lyons acknowledged that COSS
made no recommendation regarding
how to monitor the veracity of re
sponding employers.
"This is a matter that COSS prefer
red to overlook." Lyons said.
In other matters, Lyons said that
even though the newly created Stu
dent Judicial Council (SJC) has a stu
dent majority, virtually all students
facing disciplinary charges ask to have
their cases reviewed by him instead, as
was the case under the old Campus
judicial Panel (CJP).
"Most students involved in discip
linary problems are deeply embarras
sed." Lyons said 1 . "They don't want to
confront other students."
He also noted that his hearings are
slightly more informal than those of
the SJC, making students feel more
comfortable

criminatory firms.
Although Lyons acknowledged that
such a ban might have helped discour
age discrimination against gays, he
said that "the University would be
very careful before it withheld any
thing only for a policy end."
Lyons said he hopes that gays who
might complain that the recommenda
tion did not go far enough will realize
that changing the attitude of the Stan
ford community may be more impor
tant than changing attitudes of firms
that discriminate auainst uavs

"There is plenty of work to be done
here without using the University
policies as a level for change," Lyons
said.
Lyons praised the COSS recommen
dation for taking what he called a
strong stand against discrimination
against gays.
"I would hope that the COSS report
would make the University more sen
sitive to the fact that homosexuality is
a situation faced by many of our stu
dents," Lyons said. "It can be an ex
traordinarily painful experience when
one seeks a iob."
'Discrimination occuring'
Noting that "invidious job discrimi
nation" has been occurring, Lyons
said he hoped the COSS report "will
make a dent in this."
Lyons said, however, that he would
have preferred that the committee
have used the word "ask" rather than
"require" in reference to a question
naire about job discrimination that it
recommended employers be forced to
complete.
"Most companies are already be
sieged by requirements." Lyons said.

He said that a mild request might
also have been more effective in en
couraging employers to stop dis
criminating on the basis of sexual pre
ference.
No truth monitor
Lyons acknowledged that COSS
made no recommendation regarding
how to monitor the veracity of re
sponding employers.
"This is a matter that COSS prefer
red to overlook." Lyons said.
In other matters, Lyons said that
even though the newly created Stu
dent Judicial Council (SJC) has a stu
dent majority, virtually all students
facing disciplinary charges ask to have
their cases reviewed by him instead, as
was the case under the old Campus
judicial Panel (CJP).
"Most students involved in discip
linary problems are deeply embarras
sed." Lyons said 1 . "They don't want to
confront other students."
He also noted that his hearings are
slightly more informal than those of
the SJC, making students feel more
comfortable
The University probably would
have opposed any recommendation by
the Committee on Services to Students
(COSS) that employers who discrimi
nate against gays be kept from using
the Career Planning and Placement
Center, according to Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus Con
ference. Lyons.an ex officio member of
COSS, explained that such a ban
would have "intruded on the free
choices of students" by denying them
the opportunity to seek jobs with dis
criminatory firms.
