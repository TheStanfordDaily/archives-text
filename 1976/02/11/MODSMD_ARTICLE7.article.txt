## Goodby, Moynihan 
### 
We greet with relief Daniel Patrick
Moynihan's departure as U.S. ambas
sador to the United Nations.
Daring his tumultous months at the
United Nations, Moynihan showed a
heavy-handed disregard for the prob
lems of third world nations.
He scolded third world leaders when
he should have listened to them explain
their countries' problems. Instead of try
ing to understand the aspirations of
these nations, he ridiculed them for fail
ing to acquiesce in American foreign
policy aims.
Ignoring the peculiar combination of
forces like colonialism, imperialism,

war and poverty that have shaped these
nations, Moynihan often used his posi
tion solely to increase his personal ap
peal to the most chauvinistic segment of
the U.S. population.
Finally, his tendency to treat nations
in the third world as a monolith rather
than as individual nations with indi
vidual problems and outlooks was most
unscholarly.
We hope President Ford will appoint
as Moynihan's successor someone wil
ling to grapple with this nation's prob
lems vis a vis the third world in a more
patient, quiet and thoughtful manner
than did Moynihan.
