# Solving energy problems

The Jan. 28 Daily carried a
story on a speech by Chauncey
Starr, president of the Electrical
Power Research Institute (EPRI)
headlined: "Public took energy
for granted until crisis, says EPRI
official."
I agree with Starr's statement. I
also think it would be valuable to
analyze howthecrisis cametobe
and how it may affect the future.
In the past, when there has
been an easier, cheaper, more
convenient way to do things, we
Americans have almost always
chosen that way.
Our electricity consumption
has followed such lines. Only a
few years ago we were being en
couraged to buy more electric
appliances. All-electric homes
were the wave of the future. Elec
tricity was cheap and seemingly
endless.
Madison Avenue advertising
foisted onto the American public
such items as electric can open
ers, trash compactors, garbage
disposals, electric toothbrushes,
instant-on television, self
cleaning ovens and the like.
General Electric and Westing
house still advertise these and
similar items widely. It's their
business.
Big manufacturers
Not coincidentally, they are
also the two largest manufactur
ers of nuclear reactors for elec

tricity generation. They, along
with the utility companies and
the major oil companies,make up
the energy industry and the
EPRI.
These groups are all actively
campaigning for the large-scale
development of nuclear energy.
It is obvious why reactor man
ufacturers are promoting nuc
lear energy, but it may not be so
obvious why the oil industry and
the utilities are doing the same.
It becomes clear, though,
when it is known that utilities
are allowed profit on their total
investment, and nuclear power
is much more capital intensive
than other sources of energy.
Also, the major oil companies
are all involved in uranium min
ing, milling, enrichment and
processing.
Nuclear energy has been
widely praised (albeit by organi
zations and people with a per
sonal stake) as the way out of the
energy crisis — the way to
energy independence. It has
been touted as safe, clean and
reliable.
Uranium imports
In reality it is none of those
things. The U.S. has enough
uranium to run the planned reac
tors for about 25 years. As a re
sult, next year we will begin im
porting uranium. The countries
that export uranium have met as
a group and could become a car-

tel.
The price of uranium has
risen faster than the price of oil
since 1970. The nagging prob
lem of radioactive waste dis
posal is the biggest unanswered
question surrounding nuclear
power. The fact that the first
highly toxic wates generated
over 25 years ago are still in tem
porary storage demonstrates the
magnitude of the problem.
The half-million year storage
times required make obvious
that decisions we make today
will affect untold future genera
tions.
What, then, is the answer to
our energy problems? Starr was
quoted as saying that the chang
ing of society "should be a last
resort." One wonders if he meant
that business as usual is good for
business, because societal
change is an inevitability and a
necessity.
The necessary questions are
"How?" and "How fast?" is soc
iety to change. Conditions in the
world seem to require a rapid
change from confrontation to
cooperation.
In the energy field society
must change from a consump
tion to a conservation orienta
tion, and needs to begin a large
scale shift to solar energy. Now.

The Jan. 28 Daily carried a
story on a speech by Chauncey
Starr, president of the Electrical
Power Research Institute (EPRI)
headlined: "Public took energy
for granted until crisis, says EPRI
official."
I agree with Starr's statement. I
also think it would be valuable to
analyze howthecrisis cametobe
and how it may affect the future.
In the past, when there has
been an easier, cheaper, more
convenient way to do things, we
Americans have almost always
chosen that way.
Our electricity consumption
has followed such lines. Only a
few years ago we were being en
couraged to buy more electric
appliances. All-electric homes
were the wave of the future. Elec
tricity was cheap and seemingly
endless.
Madison Avenue advertising
foisted onto the American public
such items as electric can open
ers, trash compactors, garbage
disposals, electric toothbrushes,
instant-on television, self
cleaning ovens and the like.
General Electric and Westing
house still advertise these and
similar items widely. It's their
business.
Big manufacturers
Not coincidentally, they are
also the two largest manufactur
ers of nuclear reactors for elec

tricity generation. They, along
with the utility companies and
the major oil companies,make up
the energy industry and the
EPRI.
These groups are all actively
campaigning for the large-scale
development of nuclear energy.
It is obvious why reactor man
ufacturers are promoting nuc
lear energy, but it may not be so
obvious why the oil industry and
the utilities are doing the same.
It becomes clear, though,
when it is known that utilities
are allowed profit on their total
investment, and nuclear power
is much more capital intensive
than other sources of energy.
Also, the major oil companies
are all involved in uranium min
ing, milling, enrichment and
processing.
Nuclear energy has been
widely praised (albeit by organi
zations and people with a per
sonal stake) as the way out of the
energy crisis — the way to
energy independence. It has
been touted as safe, clean and
reliable.
Uranium imports
In reality it is none of those
things. The U.S. has enough
uranium to run the planned reac
tors for about 25 years. As a re
sult, next year we will begin im
porting uranium. The countries
that export uranium have met as
a group and could become a car-
