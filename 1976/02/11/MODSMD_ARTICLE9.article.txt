Semester decision
Editor:
As one who has favored a
change from the quarter system
to semesters ever since he first
tried to teach history under the
former arrangement in 1958, I
am puzzled by the Daily edito
rial of Feb. 6 entitled "Semes
ters."
The Daily seems to believe the
administration has banned dis
cussion of the recommendation
to adopt semesters that was
made by the Committee on the
Reform and Renewal of Liberal
Education at Stanford (COR
RLES).
This belief would be strange
considering that I, the Provost,
the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies and the Dean of
Humanities and Sciences all
took part in the deliberation of
CORRLES. To the best of my
knowledge, we all agreed with
CORRLES' vote (though some of
us refrained from voting on any
recommendations, on the gen
eral principlethat our role on the
Committee was ex officio.)
No doubt I am the cause of the
Daily 's misapprehension, since I
did tell a Daily reporter recently
that I thought the issue was
dead, much though I regretted it,
in view of the report of the Task
Force on Academic Calendar
and Utilization of the Academic

Plant.
That Task Force quoted at
length from several previous
studies of the issue, strongly
suggesting that the faculty had
argued it so often that there was
nothing new to be said on the
subject, and no new result to be
anticipated.
Two more points about the
"Semesters" editorial, if I may,
one significant, one a minor
point of fact. First, this administ
ration does not set the agenda of
the Committee on Academic Ap
praisal and Achievement, a
Committee of the Academic
Council. We administrators
could not prevent it from taking
up the issue even if we wanted to
do so.
Second, CORRLES did not
vote on this or any other issue
"last month," but last spring.
There was a long hiatus between
the last CORRLES meeting in
June and the publication of
CORRLES' report this winter.
Meanwhile, the Task Force had
done its work, which is what led
me to respond as I did to the Dai
ly's reporter.

Editor:
In the Jan. 26 Daily, an article
providing an otherwise fine

summary of my presentation at
Stanford the previous week was
marred by some errors in quota
tion. The opening paragraph
which summarized the effect by
the year 2000 of the increase in
our work force should have read
a six-fold increase in electricity
consumption rather than energy
consumption.
In the fifth paragraph of the
article, I refer to the use of
clotheslines instead of the elec
tric clothes drier as having a po
tential for three percent reduc
tion in urban electricity con
sumption rather than in national
energy as stated.
Finally, in the next to the last
paragraph, in the reference to the
nuclear program in France, I
spoke specifically about the in
tensive French effort to develop
the Liquid Metal Fast Breeder
Reactor. I made the point that by
the year 2000 this intensive
program would result in elec
tricity production somewhat
less than 10 percent of France's
total electricity output.

Editor:
Despite the sincere efforts of
the Daily editorial board, I must
take issue with the Feb. 6 edito

rial regarding the future of ASSU
investment policies.
I agree any professional stu
dent government is undesirable.
But Sen. Kevin McDermott's
proposal does not affect student
government. Professional finan
cial services would only in
crease yields from ASSU in
vestments, so more funds are av
ailable to spend on student ser
vices.
Use of such services does not
constitute professional student
government; it only insures an
efficient student government.
Further, the Daily claim that
"profit making should not be the
primary aim of the ASSU" is
pointless. The aim of the ASSU
is to maximize student benefits
from available funds.
If more funds are available,
students will be better off. Con
trary to the Daily suggestion,
Stanford may face $1 Sunday
Flicks next year, unless the pro
jected budget deficit is reduced.
I believe the ASSU Senate and
the present financial manager,
Chris Cline, realize no student
can be as successful in making
investment decisions as a pro
fessional firm will. I expect the
Senate to maximize the interests
of the students; therefore, 1 ex
pect it to pass Sen. McDermott's
proposal.
