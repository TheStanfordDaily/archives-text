## Alienation: the lonely life 
### Bert Bower 
Karen is usually an eager student, but today she sits
in an isolated study booth at Meyer Library, staring
blankly at the formulas before her.
She knows that if she does poorly on tomorrow's mid
term it could mar her chances of getting into medical
school.
Her lack of motivation scares her. She was optimistic
and excited when she came to Stanford, but now she feels
alone and alienated from those around her who seem to be
studying twice as hard.
Karen is not alone in her loneliness, however.
She is suffering from a sense of alienation felt by nearly
all students at some point during their Stanford education.
"During exam week last quarter we saw 166 students
complaining of anxiety and depression," says Dr. Varda
Ganz, clinical coordinator and staff psychiatrist of Cowell's
Counseling and Psychological Services.

The problem, she feels, went deeper than mere
academic worries: "A lot of these students were suffering
from loneliness."
Ganz argues that a good deal of student anxiety stems
directly from the intense competition found at Stanford,
which drives students into their own little niches.
"There is more competition at Stanford than there was
five years ago because students are concerned about how
they are going to make it in the world after they graduate,"
Ganz says.
She has seen a noticeable change from the students of
the 60s who asked questions such as "Who am I?" to the
students of the 70s who have a distinct "driveness" about
them and are much more grade conscious.
Dean of the Chapel Robert Hamerton-Kelley agrees that
academic pressure is a main factor that isolates students.
He says the feeling of alienation among Stanford students
is "close to the chief problem" his ministry is concerned
with.
