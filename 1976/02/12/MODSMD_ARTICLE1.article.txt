## Alienation: the lonely life 
### Bert Bower 
Karen is usually an eager student, but today she sits
in an isolated study booth at Meyer Library, staring
blankly at the formulas before her.
She knows that if she does poorly on tomorrow's mid
term it could mar her chances of getting into medical
school.
Her lack of motivation scares her. She was optimistic
and excited when she came to Stanford, but now she feels
alone and alienated from those around her who seem to be
studying twice as hard.
Karen is not alone in her loneliness, however.
She is suffering from a sense of alienation felt by nearly
all students at some point during their Stanford education.
"During exam week last quarter we saw 166 students
complaining of anxiety and depression," says Dr. Varda
Ganz, clinical coordinator and staff psychiatrist of Cowell's
Counseling and Psychological Services.

The problem, she feels, went deeper than mere
academic worries: "A lot of these students were suffering
from loneliness."
Ganz argues that a good deal of student anxiety stems
directly from the intense competition found at Stanford,
which drives students into their own little niches.
"There is more competition at Stanford than there was
five years ago because students are concerned about how
they are going to make it in the world after they graduate,"
Ganz says.
She has seen a noticeable change from the students of
the 60s who asked questions such as "Who am I?" to the
students of the 70s who have a distinct "driveness" about
them and are much more grade conscious.
Dean of the Chapel Robert Hamerton-Kelley agrees that
academic pressure is a main factor that isolates students.
He says the feeling of alienation among Stanford students
is "close to the chief problem" his ministry is concerned
with.

"Most people here suffer from a
confusion of values produced by a
society that emphasizes
achievement too highly,"
Hamerton-Kelley believes. "The
University is willing to sacrifice vir
tually every other human good for
the sake of achievement."
This pressure to achieve makes
many students feel inadequate
when they see themselves per
forming below the University's

norms.

Psychologist Dr. Richard Jacks
says that he frequently hears stu
dents who are performing poorly
by University standards admit,
"They must have made a mistake
when they let me in here."
For many students, the crisis
comes when they see themselves
performing below the University's
norm.

Richard Jacks says thaj students
who aren't doing well frequently
blame themselves, often saying
they feel the University "must
have made a mistake when they
let me in here."
But students with poor
academic records aren't the only
ones to feel loneliness and anxi
ety.
"I have this friend who has a
4.06 GPA who probably can't look
at himself in the mirror if he gets an
A-," explains freshman Sue
O'Meara, a pre-med student living
in Roble Hall.
"But he stays in his room with
the door locked and never talks to
anybody. I think he must be really
lonely," she adds.
Achievement overstressed
Many people criticize the Uni
versity for creating an environ
ment which stresses competition
and performance so highly that it
oppresses the student's motiva
tion to learn from others. -
"The University is on a course
right now that doesn't invite
human interaction," Rev. Manfred
Bahmann, a campus minister
from the University Lutheran
Church, says. "Professors are tel
ling students how to do things but
aren't asking the question: Why?"
Bahmann talks to many Ph.D.
students who come to him feeling
extremely lonely and "ready to
throw in the towel" because their
questions about the meaning and
value of their research aren't
being confronted by the Univer
sity.
"Dick Lyman tells me this is a
place for academic freedom. But

there really isn't much of a dedi
cated search for the truth here,"
Bahmann complains.
Little latitude
Another cause of anxiety, some
observers feel, is that there is little
latitude for students who feel left
out by the University's narrow de
finition of achievement.
"It takes a whole lot of demys
tification in order for students to
see how oppressive this system
is," says Ann Muenchow, coor
dinator of the Bridge's counseling
program.
"Students are supposed to
think they've got it made when
they go to Stanford," she adds,
"and so when they are doing
poorly here, they blame them
selves."
Muenchow contends that the
University is oppressive because
it channels students into passive
roles, leaving little room for ques
tioning or creative thought.
Another factor that contributes
to the feeling of alienation is the
University dorm system which
does little to create a supportive
environment for students.

"Physically this place reminds
me of a hotel," Debbie
Schmedemann, a junior living in
Burbank complains. There's no
sense of community in the dorm
because everybody knows they'll
be moving out at the end of the
year."
In addition, those who aren't at
tracted to a party atmosphere
often feel personally inadequate
for not breaking into the dorm's
social structure.
Dana Gioia, a resident advisor
at Mirlo House, believes that the
socialization process of the
dorms, "characterized by pillow
fights, jokes and discussions
about classes," alienates many
students.
"The person who is the intellec
tual or artistic type is not really
interested in eating cupcakes with
everyone else," he says. "People
are pressured into socializing in
one way and their personalities
are reduced to a few functions —
like discussing grades and dirty
jokes — so they alienate parts of
themselves."

they feel the University "must

But students with poor
academic records aren't the only
ones to feel loneliness and anxi
ety.
"I have this friend who has a
4.06 GPA who probably can't look
at himself in the mirror if he gets an
A-," explains freshman Sue
O'Meara, a pre-med student living
in Roble Hall.
"But he stays in his room with
the door locked and never talks to
anybody. I think he must be really
lonely," she adds.
Achievement overstressed
Many people criticize the Uni
versity for creating an environ
ment which stresses competition
and performance so highly that it
oppresses the student's motiva
tion to learn from others. -
"The University is on a course
right now that doesn't invite
human interaction," Rev. Manfred
Bahmann, a campus minister
from the University Lutheran
Church, says. "Professors are tel
ling students how to do things but
aren't asking the question: Why?"
Bahmann talks to many Ph.D.
students who come to him feeling
extremely lonely and "ready to
throw in the towel" because their
questions about the meaning and
value of their research aren't
being confronted by the Univer
sity.
"Dick Lyman tells me this is a
place for academic freedom. But

there really isn't much of a dedi
cated search for the truth here,"
Bahmann complains.
Little latitude
Another cause of anxiety, some
observers feel, is that there is little
latitude for students who feel left
out by the University's narrow de
finition of achievement.
"It takes a whole lot of demys
tification in order for students to
see how oppressive this system
is," says Ann Muenchow, coor
dinator of the Bridge's counseling
program.
"Students are supposed to
think they've got it made when
they go to Stanford," she adds,
"and so when they are doing
poorly here, they blame them
selves."
Muenchow contends that the
University is oppressive because
it channels students into passive
roles, leaving little room for ques
tioning or creative thought.
Another factor that contributes
to the feeling of alienation is the
University dorm system which
does little to create a supportive
environment for students.

"Physically this place reminds
me of a hotel," Debbie
Schmedemann, a junior living in
Burbank complains. There's no
sense of community in the dorm
because everybody knows they'll
be moving out at the end of the
year."
In addition, those who aren't at
tracted to a party atmosphere
often feel personally inadequate
for not breaking into the dorm's
social structure.
Dana Gioia, a resident advisor
at Mirlo House, believes that the
socialization process of the
dorms, "characterized by pillow
fights, jokes and discussions
about classes," alienates many
students.
"The person who is the intellec
tual or artistic type is not really
interested in eating cupcakes with
everyone else," he says. "People
are pressured into socializing in
one way and their personalities
are reduced to a few functions —
like discussing grades and dirty
jokes — so they alienate parts of
themselves."

DEPRESSION—Many students at one time or another suffer
periods of anxiety. Some say that this is a result of loneliness,
caused by Stanford's intense competition.
Karen is usually an eager student, but today she sits
in an isolated study booth at Meyer Library, staring
blankly at the formulas before her.
She knows that if she does poorly on tomorrow's mid
term it could mar her chances of getting into medical
school.
Her lack of motivation scares her. She was optimistic
and excited when she came to Stanford, but now she feels
alone and alienated from those around her who seem to be
studying twice as hard.
Karen is not alone in her loneliness, however.
She is suffering from a sense of alienation felt by nearly
all students at some point during their Stanford education.
"During exam week last quarter we saw 166 students
complaining of anxiety and depression," says Dr. Varda
Ganz, clinical coordinator and staff psychiatrist of Cowell's
Counseling and Psychological Services.

The problem, she feels, went deeper than mere
academic worries: "A lot of these students were suffering
from loneliness."
Ganz argues that a good deal of student anxiety stems
directly from the intense competition found at Stanford,
which drives students into their own little niches.
"There is more competition at Stanford than there was
five years ago because students are concerned about how
they are going to make it in the world after they graduate,"
Ganz says.
She has seen a noticeable change from the students of
the 60s who asked questions such as "Who am I?" to the
students of the 70s who have a distinct "driveness" about
them and are much more grade conscious.
Dean of the Chapel Robert Hamerton-Kelley agrees that
academic pressure is a main factor that isolates students.
He says the feeling of alienation among Stanford students
is "close to the chief problem" his ministry is concerned
with.

"Most people here suffer from a
confusion of values produced by a
society that emphasizes
achievement too highly,"
Hamerton-Kelley believes. "The
University is willing to sacrifice vir
tually every other human good for
the sake of achievement."
This pressure to achieve makes
many students feel inadequate
when they see themselves per
forming below the University's

norms.

DEPRESSION—Many students at one time or another suffer
periods of anxiety. Some say that this is a result of loneliness,
caused by Stanford's intense competition.
Karen is usually an eager student, but today she sits
in an isolated study booth at Meyer Library, staring
blankly at the formulas before her.
She knows that if she does poorly on tomorrow's mid
term it could mar her chances of getting into medical
school.
Her lack of motivation scares her. She was optimistic
and excited when she came to Stanford, but now she feels
alone and alienated from those around her who seem to be
studying twice as hard.
Karen is not alone in her loneliness, however.
She is suffering from a sense of alienation felt by nearly
all students at some point during their Stanford education.
"During exam week last quarter we saw 166 students
complaining of anxiety and depression," says Dr. Varda
Ganz, clinical coordinator and staff psychiatrist of Cowell's
Counseling and Psychological Services.

The problem, she feels, went deeper than mere
academic worries: "A lot of these students were suffering
from loneliness."
Ganz argues that a good deal of student anxiety stems
directly from the intense competition found at Stanford,
which drives students into their own little niches.
"There is more competition at Stanford than there was
five years ago because students are concerned about how
they are going to make it in the world after they graduate,"
Ganz says.
She has seen a noticeable change from the students of
the 60s who asked questions such as "Who am I?" to the
students of the 70s who have a distinct "driveness" about
them and are much more grade conscious.
Dean of the Chapel Robert Hamerton-Kelley agrees that
academic pressure is a main factor that isolates students.
He says the feeling of alienation among Stanford students
is "close to the chief problem" his ministry is concerned
with.

"Most people here suffer from a
confusion of values produced by a
society that emphasizes
achievement too highly,"
Hamerton-Kelley believes. "The
University is willing to sacrifice vir
tually every other human good for
the sake of achievement."
This pressure to achieve makes
many students feel inadequate
when they see themselves per
forming below the University's

norms.

Richard Jacks says thaj students
who aren't doing well frequently
blame themselves, often saying
they feel the University "must
have made a mistake when they
let me in here."
But students with poor
academic records aren't the only
ones to feel loneliness and anxi
ety.
"I have this friend who has a
4.06 GPA who probably can't look
at himself in the mirror if he gets an
A-," explains freshman Sue
O'Meara, a pre-med student living
in Roble Hall.
"But he stays in his room with
the door locked and never talks to
anybody. I think he must be really
lonely," she adds.
Achievement overstressed
Many people criticize the Uni
versity for creating an environ
ment which stresses competition
and performance so highly that it
oppresses the student's motiva
tion to learn from others. -
"The University is on a course
right now that doesn't invite
human interaction," Rev. Manfred
Bahmann, a campus minister
from the University Lutheran
Church, says. "Professors are tel
ling students how to do things but
aren't asking the question: Why?"
Bahmann talks to many Ph.D.
students who come to him feeling
extremely lonely and "ready to
throw in the towel" because their
questions about the meaning and
value of their research aren't
being confronted by the Univer
sity.
"Dick Lyman tells me this is a
place for academic freedom. But

there really isn't much of a dedi
cated search for the truth here,"
Bahmann complains.
Little latitude
Another cause of anxiety, some
observers feel, is that there is little
latitude for students who feel left
out by the University's narrow de
finition of achievement.
"It takes a whole lot of demys
tification in order for students to
see how oppressive this system
is," says Ann Muenchow, coor
dinator of the Bridge's counseling
program.
"Students are supposed to
think they've got it made when
they go to Stanford," she adds,
"and so when they are doing
poorly here, they blame them
selves."
Muenchow contends that the
University is oppressive because
it channels students into passive
roles, leaving little room for ques
tioning or creative thought.
Another factor that contributes
to the feeling of alienation is the
University dorm system which
does little to create a supportive
environment for students.

"Physically this place reminds
me of a hotel," Debbie
Schmedemann, a junior living in
Burbank complains. There's no
sense of community in the dorm
because everybody knows they'll
be moving out at the end of the
