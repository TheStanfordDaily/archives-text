# 'Tania Interview':
## Hearst joined 'freely' 
### Viae Kershner 
The Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA) gave Patricia Hearst
"the choice of either joining the
combat unit or returning to my pa
rents house," and she then freely
decided to remain with the re
volutionary group, according to
the written "Tania Interview" re
leased yesterday.
"I had come to feel too strongly
about the need for revolutionary
change in amerikka (sic), about
the need for revolutionary vio
lence directed against the
capitalist ruling class, about the
need to organize the people into a
fighting force to destroy im
perialism and the racist-class soc
iety which keeps the people en
slaved," Hearst explained.
The interview, admitted into
evidence at the Hearst trial yes
terday, was found at the San
Francisco home where she was
arrested Sept. 18. The interview

apparently was intended as part of
a book with SLA members William
and Emily Harris.
Robbery
The interview does not directly
touch on the April 15,1974, Hiber
nia Bank robbery, for which she is
charged. The interview does,
however, seem to contradict
statements she made in court
Tuesday that she was forced to
say in a tape recording that she
was a willing participant in the
robbery.
Asked (possibly by radical au
thor Jack Scott) about "brain
washing" theories of Hearst's
conversion, she said in the inter
view,"! couldn't believe that any
one would come up with such
bullshit."
The interview makes no men
tion of Hearst's being forced to do
anything against her will while in
captivity — other than exercises
designed to restore her physical
condition.
'Hit in the face'
The papers do, however, sub
stantiate Hearst's story on one
point — that she was involuntarily
taken from her Berkeley apart
ment on Feb. 4, 1974. She said
she was "hit in the face with a
machine gun," collapsed, was
"dragged down the stairs outside
the apartment" and was "put in
the trunk of a car."
In the interview, Hearst said that
while she was kept in a closet for
six weeks, "after only a couple of
weeks I started to feel sympathe
tic with the SLA."
She said she overcame initial
doubts about the SLA's tactics as
she watched the "sick farce" of
the People in Need food distribu
tion program, designed to win her
release. She termed her conver
sion "a process of development,
much the same way as a photo
graph is developed onto paper."
When she decided to join her
captors, the interview said,
Hearst's major worry was that she

"was generally lacking the politi
cal analysis and military skills that
I thought would be a prerequisite
to joining the group.''
The other barrier to Hearst's
joining the group, she said, was
opposition on the part of SLA
members. But Hearst said she
"talked to each comrade individu
ally so that they could understand
what had gone into my decision,"
and that they thereupon unanim
ously agreed to let her join.
Sexual relationship?
Asked whether she had sexual
relationships with other members
of the group, Hearst did not ans
wer directly, but noted she had a
"personal relationship'' with
"Kahjoh" — SLA member Willie
Wolfe, killed in the May 17,1974,
Los Angeles shootout.
The interview said that other
group members thought
"personal/sexual relationships
could be dangerous," but that she
and Kahjoh became stronger as
revolutionaries because of "rein
forcement from each other."
In testimony Tuesday, Hearst
said she never loved Wolfe. The
interview does not deal directly
with that question.
In the interview, Hearst said
hatred for her parents made her
decision to join the SLA easier.
"My mother didn't provide a very
attractive model for me to follow,"
she said. "She was often on some
kind of drug, usually barbituates.
One day ... she was so fucked
she could hardly talk."
She said she began her affair
with Steven Weed because "I
thought I would be able to avoid
any further confrontations with my
ruling class upbringing because
Steve would change my name
and rescue me from being a
Hearst."
She said that her relationship
with Weed degenerated as he
"began to aspire to a ruling-class
life style like that of my parents."

say in a tape recording that she
was a willing participant in the
robbery.
Asked (possibly by radical au
thor Jack Scott) about "brain
washing" theories of Hearst's
conversion, she said in the inter
view,"! couldn't believe that any
one would come up with such
bullshit."
The interview makes no men
tion of Hearst's being forced to do
anything against her will while in
captivity — other than exercises
designed to restore her physical
condition.
'Hit in the face'
The papers do, however, sub
stantiate Hearst's story on one
point — that she was involuntarily
taken from her Berkeley apart
ment on Feb. 4, 1974. She said
she was "hit in the face with a
machine gun," collapsed, was
"dragged down the stairs outside
the apartment" and was "put in
the trunk of a car."
In the interview, Hearst said that
while she was kept in a closet for
six weeks, "after only a couple of
weeks I started to feel sympathe
tic with the SLA."
She said she overcame initial
doubts about the SLA's tactics as
she watched the "sick farce" of
the People in Need food distribu
tion program, designed to win her
release. She termed her conver
sion "a process of development,
much the same way as a photo
graph is developed onto paper."
When she decided to join her
captors, the interview said,
Hearst's major worry was that she

"was generally lacking the politi
cal analysis and military skills that
I thought would be a prerequisite
to joining the group.''
The other barrier to Hearst's
joining the group, she said, was
opposition on the part of SLA
members. But Hearst said she
"talked to each comrade individu
ally so that they could understand
what had gone into my decision,"
and that they thereupon unanim
ously agreed to let her join.
Sexual relationship?
Asked whether she had sexual
relationships with other members
of the group, Hearst did not ans
wer directly, but noted she had a
"personal relationship'' with
"Kahjoh" — SLA member Willie
Wolfe, killed in the May 17,1974,
Los Angeles shootout.
The interview said that other
group members thought
"personal/sexual relationships
could be dangerous," but that she
and Kahjoh became stronger as
revolutionaries because of "rein
forcement from each other."
In testimony Tuesday, Hearst
said she never loved Wolfe. The
interview does not deal directly
with that question.
In the interview, Hearst said
hatred for her parents made her
decision to join the SLA easier.
"My mother didn't provide a very
attractive model for me to follow,"
she said. "She was often on some
kind of drug, usually barbituates.
One day ... she was so fucked
she could hardly talk."
She said she began her affair
with Steven Weed because "I
thought I would be able to avoid
any further confrontations with my
ruling class upbringing because
Steve would change my name
and rescue me from being a
Hearst."
She said that her relationship
with Weed degenerated as he
"began to aspire to a ruling-class
life style like that of my parents."
The Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA) gave Patricia Hearst
"the choice of either joining the
combat unit or returning to my pa
rents house," and she then freely
decided to remain with the re
volutionary group, according to
the written "Tania Interview" re
leased yesterday.
"I had come to feel too strongly
about the need for revolutionary
change in amerikka (sic), about
the need for revolutionary vio
lence directed against the
capitalist ruling class, about the
need to organize the people into a
fighting force to destroy im
perialism and the racist-class soc
iety which keeps the people en
slaved," Hearst explained.
The interview, admitted into
evidence at the Hearst trial yes
terday, was found at the San
Francisco home where she was
arrested Sept. 18. The interview

apparently was intended as part of
a book with SLA members William
and Emily Harris.
Robbery
The interview does not directly
touch on the April 15,1974, Hiber
nia Bank robbery, for which she is
charged. The interview does,
however, seem to contradict
statements she made in court
Tuesday that she was forced to
say in a tape recording that she
was a willing participant in the
robbery.
Asked (possibly by radical au
thor Jack Scott) about "brain

conversion, she said in the inter
