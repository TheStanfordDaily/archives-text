# Tax increase for transit aid faces numerous opponents

A Santa Clara County Transit
District referendum, which transit
officials claim may prevent cur
tailment of existing transit lines —
including those near Stanford —
faces opposition from elected offi
cials and taxpayers.
The county-wide referendum,
Measure A on the March 2 ballot,
calls for the imposition of an addi
tional one-half cent county sales
tax.
The tax funds would be used to
expand existing transit systems
and to provide a light-rail system
in the west Santa Clara Valley.
Palo Alto City Councilman John
Berwald said he opposed the
measure. He charged that the tax
would be economically regres
sive, affecting most severely
those least able to pay it, and that

the proposals for expanding the
transit system, particularly the
light-rail system, are "naive.'
Serve the people?
In addition, Berwald said he op
posed the light-rail system be
cause it would not serve "the
people I was elected to serve, al
though they will be paying for it."
Councilman Kirke Ccmstock
said he is also against the re
ferendum.
He said a lower additional tax of
three-eights of a cent would gen
erate enough revenue to maintain
and improve the bus system.
He called the proposed one-half
cent tax increase "money looking
for a place to spend itself.
'Incompetence'
Joe Donohue, president of the
United Taxpayers of Santa Clara
County, said his organization op

poses the measure primarily be
cause of "the incompetence and
ineptness of the county in running
the (current) transit system."
Donohue agreed with Berwald
that the additional tax would be
"regressive."The tax increase
"hurts the little guy," he said. He
added that with the exception of
the property tax, the sales tax is
the largest single source of tax re
venue in the state.
Donohue discounted claims
that without the proposed tax in
crease, all mass transit services
could end.
He accused transit officials of
"trying to scare the hell out of
people." No transit district or any
other governmental agency ever
withdraws from areas of estab
lished operations, he said.
