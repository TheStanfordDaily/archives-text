# Cyclist invents motorized bike

### Riv Weber 
As you're panting up the last leg
of Skyline Drive on your bicycle,
don't be surprised to see a
middle-aged man bike past you
going 24 m.p.h.
Frans Vereyken, a Dutch-born
inventor and former Olympic
speed skater, has designed a new
bicycle which promises to be a
major innovation in cycling.
The Vereyken bike, designed
three years ago "on a fluke," has
since been modified to hold two
electric motors. The motors may
be activated by pushing a button
on the handlebars as the bike
reaches a speed of about 10
m.p.h.
The bicycle has a range of 40
miles, and may be recharged.

The bike's design is anything
but conventional. The pedals do
not rotate, but are pushed up and
down, moving two levers extend
ing to the rear tire. These two lev
ers move a chain attached to the
back of the tire.
Vereyken explained the reason
ing behind his design: "On a con
ventional bicycle, the top position
of the leg is least efficient and at
this point (his) bike is most effi
cient."
The conventional cyclist can
press down with a force of 200
pounds, he said, but this force is
wasted once the pedal reaches
the bottom position.
The long levers on Vereyken's
bike allow the same force with
one-third the labor. Because
"there is always a constant force,
the bike is more linear and effi
cient," he said.
The bike is also designed so
that "when the leg is up, the pedal
is lighter," Vereyken continued.
"The gears are infinite, so the rider
can pedal in large or small
strides."
Vereyken noted this feature's
importance in when making sharp
turns. On the conventional bicy
cle, there is no way to lean into a
turn without scraping the pedal on
the ground.
On the Vereyken bike, one
need only pedal in shorter strides
to keep the pedal farther from the
ground on such turns.
Enumerating the advantages of
his design, Vereyken stressed
"safety first.' Because the bicycle
chain has been shifted to the
bike's rear, the rider is saved from
the agony of bellbottoms in the
chain."
Another safety feature is the
ability of the rider to keep his
hands on the handlebars at all
times.

turns. On the conventional bicy
cle, there is no way to lean into a
turn without scraping the pedal on
the ground.
On the Vereyken bike, one
need only pedal in shorter strides
to keep the pedal farther from the
ground on such turns.
Enumerating the advantages of
his design, Vereyken stressed
"safety first.' Because the bicycle
chain has been shifted to the
bike's rear, the rider is saved from
the agony of bellbottoms in the
chain."
Another safety feature is the
ability of the rider to keep his
hands on the handlebars at all
times.

RIDING HIGH —Frans Vereyken shows his unconventional con
tribution to the cycling industry, powered by a combination of
player piano-like foot levers and two electric motors. Vereyken,
a former Olympic speed skater and coach, says he designed the
bike three years ago 'on a fluke.'
As you're panting up the last leg
of Skyline Drive on your bicycle,
don't be surprised to see a
middle-aged man bike past you
going 24 m.p.h.
Frans Vereyken, a Dutch-born
inventor and former Olympic
speed skater, has designed a new
bicycle which promises to be a
major innovation in cycling.
The Vereyken bike, designed
three years ago "on a fluke," has
since been modified to hold two
electric motors. The motors may
be activated by pushing a button
on the handlebars as the bike
reaches a speed of about 10
m.p.h.
The bicycle has a range of 40
miles, and may be recharged.

The bike's design is anything
but conventional. The pedals do
not rotate, but are pushed up and
down, moving two levers extend
ing to the rear tire. These two lev
ers move a chain attached to the
back of the tire.
Vereyken explained the reason
ing behind his design: "On a con
ventional bicycle, the top position
of the leg is least efficient and at
this point (his) bike is most effi
cient."
The conventional cyclist can
press down with a force of 200
pounds, he said, but this force is
wasted once the pedal reaches
the bottom position.
The long levers on Vereyken's
bike allow the same force with
one-third the labor. Because
"there is always a constant force,
the bike is more linear and effi
cient," he said.
The bike is also designed so
that "when the leg is up, the pedal
is lighter," Vereyken continued.
"The gears are infinite, so the rider
can pedal in large or small
strides."
Vereyken noted this feature's
importance in when making sharp
turns. On the conventional bicy
cle, there is no way to lean into a
turn without scraping the pedal on
the ground.
On the Vereyken bike, one
need only pedal in shorter strides
to keep the pedal farther from the
ground on such turns.
