CORRECTION
In yesterday's Daily ASSU
Sen. Brad Krevoy was mis
quoted as saying at Tuesday
night's Senate meeting that
UCLA lost $2 million in endow
ments as a result of Angela
Davis' presence on that faculty.
Krevoy actually said the
Claremont Colleges had been
financially affected because
Davis is a faculty member there.
