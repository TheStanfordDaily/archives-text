# Residents rename dorm:
## 'Olivo-Magnolia' to 'Ujamaa' 
### Keith Calhoun 
Black Cultural Center residents have voted to re
name Olivo-Magnolia, the dormitory where the
center is located, "Ujamaa," a Swahili word mean
ing "familyhood."
Sophomore David M. Smith, coordinator of the
move to change the name, said a vote was taken
late last week at a house meeting in Olivo-Magnolia.
Students at the meeting were asked to choose
among nine proposals, including six black persons'
names and three Swahili words. Smith said Ujamaa
received fewer than five votes more than Haram
bee, which means "all pull together." Umoja ("un
ity") finished a close third, he said. Exact totals were
not available last night.

The meeting was open to anyone in the black
community, Smith said. Earlier last week, resi
dents had been given questionnaires asking
whether nonresidents should be permitted to vote.
Of the 68 Olivo-Magnolians responding, 57 said
yes, according to Smith.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton said
he has not yet received an official proposal on the
name change. "I'll wait until I receive the proposal,
and then we'll take action as quickly as possible,"
Horton said.
He added that he had explained to the Olivo-
Magnolia resident fellow and house associates the
format such a proposal should take.
