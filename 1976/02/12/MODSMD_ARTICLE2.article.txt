B-ball prowess
Editor:
I am writing to protest the Daily s
absurd contention that Seek and
Destroy and Theta Delta are the
class of the intramural basketball
ieague. Obviously the writers
have never seen the incompara
ble Bionics from the School of
Education.
Through some administrative
error we were assigned to the "C"
league, but we have overcome
this lowly status in four brilliant
performances to stand at the very
top of our league. One has only to
scan our roster to ascertain the
reasons for this success.
First there is Paul Grippa who
leads the league in shooting — not
scoring, just shooting. Then there
is Steve Loy whose records for
drinking at Princeton may never
be broken.
Next there is our muscle for
ward, Parker Beverage. And with
a name like that you know he's got
to be tough.
Then there is the team captain,
Mary Dimmock. Mary is two of the
biggest reasons, well two of the
reasons, why we do so well when
we play as skins . .. and we al
ways play as skins.
Then there s the Big "E," Ernie
Hudson; only in this case the "E"
stands for "error-prone."
Also there are the Mexican
Banditoes, Roberto Duran and
Miguel Trujillo, who are leading
the league in steals. While
everyone else is playing, they're
out in the parking lot ripping off
hubcaps. Then there is Nate "The
Skate" Dickmeyer who spent two
years with the circus as the
world's shortest bald person. Next
there are Jack Martin, David Bell
and Dave Longanecker who lead
the league in distance from the
basket when shooting, falling
down, and running out of breath,
respectively.
Lastly comes Russ "urn, you
know' Rumberger who doesn't
know the meaning of the word
quit." But then there s a lot of
words he doesn t know the mean
ing of.
And finally, there is the team
mascot, Maggie Andrews, whose
knee injury has provided the slo
gan which has spurred us on to
victory after victory — "Let s win
this one for the Gimper."
If anyone wants to see us per
form, stop by Maples Pavilion —
but if one really wants to see us
perform, come to the Amber Lan
tern.

Quotation misquoted
Editor:
The statement attributed to me
in the Feb. 10 Daily in regard to
the current massage parlor con
troversy was not a quote but an
inaccurate condensation which
distorted the intent. What I did say
was that "the issue at stake is no
more, and no less, than the right of
the individual to choose his own
life style."
Several remarks later I called
upon the council to "find for the
cause of liberty." People obvi
ously do not choose a life style in
order to promote the cause of lib
erty, which is about as much
meaning I can attribute to the
mish-mash that was actually
printed.
I might have been willing to ex
cuse such an error in light of the
difficulties of oral transcription,
were it not quite obvious at the
time I was reading from a pre
pared text. All the reporter need
have done to insure the accuracy
of his notes was to ask me for the
written copy.
In all fairness to the Daily s re
porter I think the overall article
was accurate and well balanced in
the views it presented. This was
most clearly evident when com
pared with the coverage in the
Palo Alto Times which, it would
appear, prefers not to recognize
the existence of such threatening
creatures as Libertarians.

History lunches
Editor:
I am both puzzled and disturbed
by the fact that so few students ae
showing up for the Tuesday brown
bag lunches with professors from
the History Department.
Puzzled because I think Stan
ford students by definition should
be curious enough to want to view
their professors across a narrow
table as well as up there on the
podium, and disturbed because
students are missing this unique
opportunity to catch an hour's
glimpse of professors as decent
human beings as well as brilliant
dispensers of knowledge and,
hopefully, good grades.
The committee who worked up
this program is to be commended
and the students who don't show
up are to be viewed with alarm and
no little pity.
