It's difficult to make direct com
parisons between all the stores,
as there are a number of variables
to contend with.
For instance, some of these
shops rent only cross-country
skis, while others specialize in the
more popular, due to lower cost
(no ski-lift tickets) and a lesser de
gree of skill needed to gain com
petence.
In addition to equipment costs,
there are a few extra expenses. All
stores carry breakage insurance,
which, for the minimal cost, ($l-3),
is a good thing to carry. Also,
some shops require a deposit on
their equipment. And as long as
you're going skiing, of course, be
sure your Blue Cross is paid up.
That takes care of most of your

rental expenses, but there are a
few other tips that can cut costs.
First be sure you r car is ready to
go. Make certain you have
changed your anti-freeze within
the last year. If you need some,
most discount stores sell it for less
than $4 a gallon.
Also, good tires and a good
spare are a must, as well as a jack.
And definitely bring along

chains for your tires, as they can
only be obtained at outrageous
prices onceyou're up on the
slopes.
Chains, by the way, are very
hard on tires, and you should not
leave them on once you have left
snow or ice conditions. Brand new
tires have been known to wear out
completely after 100 miles of al
ternating ice and pavement.
