# S.F. Symphony offers disappointing virtuoso
## 
### Thaddeus Carhart 
The varied fare offered up by
the San Francisco Symphony last
Wednesday night gave a striking
example of how a seemingly im
aginative program can backfire to
the detriment of performers, audi
ence, and — not least of all — the
music itself. Curiously, the or
chestra never managed to find a
convincing unity in any of the
evening's three works, though it
came closest in the short and
lively piece of program music
which opened the concert, von
Weber's Overture to Der Feis
chutz. Despite some annoyingly
uneven attacks in the brass during
the adagio introduction, the de
velopment of subsequent themes
was full and rich in tone, and the
phrasing clear. Though the strings
failed to build the requisite tension
in the recapitulation, the balance
was restored in the energetic coda
— a masterful showcase for the
orchestra's percussion section
which concluded this brief piece.
Unfortunately, the few rough
spots in the Weber became so
many ragged edges in the ensu
ing two major works, Schumann's
Piano Concerto in A Minor, Opus
54 and Shostakovich's Symphony
No. 5, Opus 47.
The lack of cohesiveness in the
Schumann is chiefly attributable
to the inclination of the soloist,
Christoph Eschenbach, to ap
proach the score in the manner of
the bravura virtuosi who toured
Europe at the height of the
Romantic era like present-day
Elton Johns or David Bowies, of
fering the exaggerated theatrics,
the melodramatic effects, and the
pandering to the gallery for which
the public clamored.
To be sure, there is much in this
concerto that is unabashedly
dramatic in the best tradition of the
Romantics, but throughout there
is a control and a restraint that
always link the occasional fiery
flashes to a suffused flame of mus
ical poetry. It is significant that
Schumann took pains to write out
the concerto's only cadenza as in
surance against the bravura ex
cesses of the day. In short, this
piece demands of the soloist a
power of musical interpretation of
the most subtle variety; it is not a

vehicle for technical virtuosity
(through the finale certainly de
mands some agile fingerwork),
but rather a test of the pianist as
an interpreter of delicate con
trasts.
Attack
Regrettably, Eschenbach
attacked the score (I use that verb
advisedly) with a formidable dis
play of technique, but with very
little of the feeling for nuance and
restraint which breates life into the
piece. His reading of the dynamic
marking for the first movement, al
legro affettuoso, had little to do
with an "affectionate, loving" ap
proach and much to do with
heavy-handed melodrama. From
the statement of the first theme
through the cadenza his playing
was characterized by a stagey
touch, slapdash phrasing, and a
tendency to stretch the tempi
beyond a point which it is possible
to justify by reference to the score,
and which is not to be heard on
any of the recordings presently
available of this much-performed
concerto. The intermezzo of the
second movement fared better, as
Eschenback brought grace
and feeling to this lovely dialogue
between piano and orchestra, but
the finale spelled a return to the
bombastic excesses which so
marred the opening. Trills and
mordants were slutted, arpeggios
were played for mere volume, the
piano was fundamentally at odds
with the orchestra.
Disastrous
It is tempting to attribute some
of this disastrous showing to the
uneasy position of a visiting solist
playing with an unfamiliar or
chestra, but the fact is that
Eschenbach has played with the
San Francisco Symphony for the
past three seasons. Indeed, last
year he gave us a very accepta
ble, if uninspired, Emperor con
certo with the same orchestra. Nor
is this Symphony incapable of the
disciplined ensemble work so
necessary for a concerto: only last

week Mischa Dichter played a
beautiful perfectly balanced
Mozart concerto with the same
group. The fact is that the liberties
with the score taken by Es
chenbach are the chief cause of
an unconvincing performance.
The program notes hailed him as
a "peerless pianist," but one must
conclude that in the realm of this
Schumann masterpiece he is
without peers only because other
major pianists play it so much bet
ter than he.
Redemption
The orchestra managed to re
deem the evening somewhat by
its concluding performance of
Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5
but unfortunately there was again
a nagging discontinuity of in
terpretation that severely under
mined the effect of this long and
broad-ranging piece. Shos
takovich's orchestration includes
piano, xylophone, two harps, and
a host of percussion instruments,
and these were all heard to advan
tage as the orchestral tone color
was lucid and brilliant throughout.
Nevertheless, the lack of an
energetic unity caused the work to
drag terribly at times, and by the
last movement the ensemble vio
lins sounded more as if they were
sawing wood than building to a
rousing finale.
Guido Ajmone-Marsan was
the guest conductor for the even
ing. While his credentials are im
pressive for so young a maestro,
his baton was not always as cer
tain as could be hoped. His read
ing of the Shostakovich score was
forthright but it lacked vitality, and
he badly botched the trickly syn
copation in the famous second
subject of the Schumann finale.
Hopefully he will bring a steadier
hand to the podium when he con
ducts again this week. The prog
ram includes Barber's Second
Essay for Orchestra, Haydn's
Symphony No. 99 and the sel
dom heard Symphony No. 3 by
Saint-Saens.

through the cadenza his playing
was characterized by a stagey
touch, slapdash phrasing, and a
tendency to stretch the tempi
beyond a point which it is possible
to justify by reference to the score,
and which is not to be heard on
any of the recordings presently
available of this much-performed
concerto. The intermezzo of the
second movement fared better, as
Eschenback brought grace
and feeling to this lovely dialogue
between piano and orchestra, but
the finale spelled a return to the
bombastic excesses which so
marred the opening. Trills and
mordants were slutted, arpeggios
were played for mere volume, the
piano was fundamentally at odds
with the orchestra.
Disastrous
It is tempting to attribute some
of this disastrous showing to the
uneasy position of a visiting solist
playing with an unfamiliar or
chestra, but the fact is that
Eschenbach has played with the
San Francisco Symphony for the
past three seasons. Indeed, last
year he gave us a very accepta
ble, if uninspired, Emperor con
certo with the same orchestra. Nor
is this Symphony incapable of the
disciplined ensemble work so
necessary for a concerto: only last

week Mischa Dichter played a
beautiful perfectly balanced
Mozart concerto with the same
group. The fact is that the liberties
with the score taken by Es
chenbach are the chief cause of
an unconvincing performance.
The program notes hailed him as
a "peerless pianist," but one must
conclude that in the realm of this
Schumann masterpiece he is
without peers only because other
major pianists play it so much bet
ter than he.
Redemption
The orchestra managed to re
deem the evening somewhat by
its concluding performance of
Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5
but unfortunately there was again
a nagging discontinuity of in
terpretation that severely under
mined the effect of this long and
broad-ranging piece. Shos
takovich's orchestration includes
piano, xylophone, two harps, and
a host of percussion instruments,
and these were all heard to advan
tage as the orchestral tone color
was lucid and brilliant throughout.
Nevertheless, the lack of an
energetic unity caused the work to
drag terribly at times, and by the
last movement the ensemble vio
lins sounded more as if they were
sawing wood than building to a
rousing finale.
Guido Ajmone-Marsan was
the guest conductor for the even
ing. While his credentials are im
pressive for so young a maestro,
his baton was not always as cer
tain as could be hoped. His read
ing of the Shostakovich score was
forthright but it lacked vitality, and
he badly botched the trickly syn
copation in the famous second
subject of the Schumann finale.
Hopefully he will bring a steadier
hand to the podium when he con
ducts again this week. The prog
ram includes Barber's Second
Essay for Orchestra, Haydn's
Symphony No. 99 and the sel
dom heard Symphony No. 3 by
Saint-Saens.
The varied fare offered up by
the San Francisco Symphony last
Wednesday night gave a striking
example of how a seemingly im
aginative program can backfire to
the detriment of performers, audi
ence, and — not least of all — the
music itself. Curiously, the or
chestra never managed to find a
convincing unity in any of the
evening's three works, though it
came closest in the short and
lively piece of program music
which opened the concert, von
Weber's Overture to Der Feis
chutz. Despite some annoyingly
uneven attacks in the brass during
the adagio introduction, the de
velopment of subsequent themes
was full and rich in tone, and the
phrasing clear. Though the strings
failed to build the requisite tension
in the recapitulation, the balance
was restored in the energetic coda
— a masterful showcase for the
orchestra's percussion section
which concluded this brief piece.
Unfortunately, the few rough
spots in the Weber became so
many ragged edges in the ensu
ing two major works, Schumann's
Piano Concerto in A Minor, Opus
54 and Shostakovich's Symphony
No. 5, Opus 47.
The lack of cohesiveness in the
Schumann is chiefly attributable
to the inclination of the soloist,
Christoph Eschenbach, to ap
proach the score in the manner of
the bravura virtuosi who toured
Europe at the height of the
Romantic era like present-day
Elton Johns or David Bowies, of
fering the exaggerated theatrics,
the melodramatic effects, and the
pandering to the gallery for which
the public clamored.
To be sure, there is much in this
concerto that is unabashedly
dramatic in the best tradition of the
Romantics, but throughout there
is a control and a restraint that
always link the occasional fiery
flashes to a suffused flame of mus
ical poetry. It is significant that
Schumann took pains to write out
the concerto's only cadenza as in
surance against the bravura ex
cesses of the day. In short, this
piece demands of the soloist a
power of musical interpretation of
the most subtle variety; it is not a

vehicle for technical virtuosity
(through the finale certainly de
mands some agile fingerwork),
but rather a test of the pianist as
an interpreter of delicate con
trasts.
Attack
Regrettably, Eschenbach
attacked the score (I use that verb
advisedly) with a formidable dis
play of technique, but with very
little of the feeling for nuance and
restraint which breates life into the
piece. His reading of the dynamic
marking for the first movement, al
legro affettuoso, had little to do
with an "affectionate, loving" ap
proach and much to do with
heavy-handed melodrama. From
the statement of the first theme
through the cadenza his playing
was characterized by a stagey
touch, slapdash phrasing, and a
tendency to stretch the tempi
beyond a point which it is possible
to justify by reference to the score,
and which is not to be heard on

ram includes Barber's Second
Essay for Orchestra, Haydn's
Symphony No. 99 and the sel
dom heard Symphony No. 3 by
Saint-Saens.
The varied fare offered up by
the San Francisco Symphony last
Wednesday night gave a striking
example of how a seemingly im
aginative program can backfire to
the detriment of performers, audi
ence, and — not least of all — the
music itself. Curiously, the or
chestra never managed to find a
convincing unity in any of the
evening's three works, though it
came closest in the short and
lively piece of program music
which opened the concert, von
Weber's Overture to Der Feis
chutz. Despite some annoyingly
uneven attacks in the brass during
the adagio introduction, the de
velopment of subsequent themes
was full and rich in tone, and the
phrasing clear. Though the strings
failed to build the requisite tension
in the recapitulation, the balance
was restored in the energetic coda
— a masterful showcase for the
orchestra's percussion section
which concluded this brief piece.
Unfortunately, the few rough
spots in the Weber became so
many ragged edges in the ensu
ing two major works, Schumann's
Piano Concerto in A Minor, Opus
54 and Shostakovich's Symphony
No. 5, Opus 47.
The lack of cohesiveness in the
Schumann is chiefly attributable
to the inclination of the soloist,
Christoph Eschenbach, to ap
proach the score in the manner of
the bravura virtuosi who toured
Europe at the height of the
Romantic era like present-day
Elton Johns or David Bowies, of
fering the exaggerated theatrics,
the melodramatic effects, and the
pandering to the gallery for which
the public clamored.
To be sure, there is much in this
concerto that is unabashedly
dramatic in the best tradition of the
Romantics, but throughout there
is a control and a restraint that
always link the occasional fiery
flashes to a suffused flame of mus
ical poetry. It is significant that
Schumann took pains to write out
the concerto's only cadenza as in
surance against the bravura ex
cesses of the day. In short, this
piece demands of the soloist a
power of musical interpretation of
the most subtle variety; it is not a

vehicle for technical virtuosity
(through the finale certainly de
mands some agile fingerwork),
but rather a test of the pianist as
an interpreter of delicate con
trasts.
Attack
Regrettably, Eschenbach
attacked the score (I use that verb
advisedly) with a formidable dis
play of technique, but with very
little of the feeling for nuance and
restraint which breates life into the
piece. His reading of the dynamic
marking for the first movement, al
legro affettuoso, had little to do
with an "affectionate, loving" ap
proach and much to do with
heavy-handed melodrama. From
the statement of the first theme
through the cadenza his playing
was characterized by a stagey
touch, slapdash phrasing, and a
tendency to stretch the tempi
beyond a point which it is possible
to justify by reference to the score,
and which is not to be heard on
any of the recordings presently
available of this much-performed
concerto. The intermezzo of the
second movement fared better, as
Eschenback brought grace
and feeling to this lovely dialogue
between piano and orchestra, but
the finale spelled a return to the
bombastic excesses which so
marred the opening. Trills and
mordants were slutted, arpeggios
were played for mere volume, the
piano was fundamentally at odds
with the orchestra.
Disastrous
It is tempting to attribute some
of this disastrous showing to the
uneasy position of a visiting solist
playing with an unfamiliar or
chestra, but the fact is that
Eschenbach has played with the
San Francisco Symphony for the
past three seasons. Indeed, last
year he gave us a very accepta
ble, if uninspired, Emperor con
certo with the same orchestra. Nor
is this Symphony incapable of the
disciplined ensemble work so
necessary for a concerto: only last

week Mischa Dichter played a
beautiful perfectly balanced
Mozart concerto with the same
group. The fact is that the liberties
with the score taken by Es
chenbach are the chief cause of
an unconvincing performance.
The program notes hailed him as
a "peerless pianist," but one must
conclude that in the realm of this
Schumann masterpiece he is
without peers only because other
major pianists play it so much bet
ter than he.
Redemption
The orchestra managed to re
deem the evening somewhat by
its concluding performance of
Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5
but unfortunately there was again
a nagging discontinuity of in
terpretation that severely under
mined the effect of this long and
broad-ranging piece. Shos
takovich's orchestration includes
piano, xylophone, two harps, and
a host of percussion instruments,
and these were all heard to advan
tage as the orchestral tone color
was lucid and brilliant throughout.
Nevertheless, the lack of an
energetic unity caused the work to
drag terribly at times, and by the
last movement the ensemble vio
lins sounded more as if they were
sawing wood than building to a
rousing finale.
Guido Ajmone-Marsan was
the guest conductor for the even
ing. While his credentials are im
pressive for so young a maestro,
his baton was not always as cer
tain as could be hoped. His read
ing of the Shostakovich score was
forthright but it lacked vitality, and
he badly botched the trickly syn
copation in the famous second
subject of the Schumann finale.
Hopefully he will bring a steadier
hand to the podium when he con
ducts again this week. The prog
ram includes Barber's Second
Essay for Orchestra, Haydn's
Symphony No. 99 and the sel
dom heard Symphony No. 3 by
Saint-Saens.
