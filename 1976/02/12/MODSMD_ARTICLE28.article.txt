## ACT showcases 'puns on the run' 
### BoB Henry 
The American Conservatory
Theatre (ACT) has captured a
royal bird, the world premiere of
Tennessee Williams' newest
script, and even though constant
prodding does get the cock to dis
play his plumage, too much dull
down hides the few colorful feath
ers.
Williams has stated that the
present play is only a first draft,
which gives him the liberty to try
almost anything and see what
happens. He does.
The plot — which is only a man
nequin for Williams to gaudily
dress with song, dance, epigram,
double entendre, realism, fantasy
and eroticism — deals with a
countess who comes to a small,
foreign country just as a revolution
sets in. The play explores her
psyche as she cuckolds her hus
band and reveals her power of
clairvoyance; she is always "a
moment ahead of the moment."
The exploration gets lost in a
jungle of tedious babbling, but
somewhere beneath all the ex
cess foliage lies the root of some
thing great. Many moments (mo
ments, according to the countess,
are what life is made of) sparkle
with theatrical genius.
ACT goes after the elusive
beast with an entire army — a cast
of at least 40 people — but cannot
snare the crafty animal; Williams'
script stands out as the weakest
element of the production.
Elizabeth Huddle superbly
gives us a fascinating countess,
who changs beautifully from cas
trating, energetic lover to
dreamy-eyed daughter longing for
another visit from her deceased
mother. She is ably aided by Ray
Reinhardt as her antler-growing

husband and Nicholas Courtland
as both her lovers, with Reinhardt
giving a brilliant portrayal of the
wealthy military-industrialist who
screams over the telephone, as
ticker tape spews by, "Beat Beat
Clobber Clobber Kill Kill."
Gorgeous costumes by Robert
Morgan, soft, lovely music by
Conrad Susa and excellent light
ing by F. Mitchell Dana combine
with deft, lively staging by director
Allen Fletcher to produce a night
of splendid theatricality, even if it
may not be first-rate drama.
The first act is somewhat lewd,
causing many patrons to leave at
intermission, and the second act
gets a little preachy when Williams
abandons his pun-and-run format
in favor of a more serious, con
templative one.

Reinhardt as her antler-growing

husband and Nicholas Courtland
as both her lovers, with Reinhardt
giving a brilliant portrayal of the
wealthy military-industrialist who
screams over the telephone, as
ticker tape spews by, "Beat Beat
Clobber Clobber Kill Kill."
Gorgeous costumes by Robert
Morgan, soft, lovely music by
Conrad Susa and excellent light
ing by F. Mitchell Dana combine
with deft, lively staging by director
Allen Fletcher to produce a night
of splendid theatricality, even if it
may not be first-rate drama.
The first act is somewhat lewd,
causing many patrons to leave at
intermission, and the second act
gets a little preachy when Williams
abandons his pun-and-run format
in favor of a more serious, con
templative one.
