Bobby Short returned to San
Francisco's Geary Theater for his
annual Bay Area performance.
With his charming renditions of old
songs from the '20s and '30s,
Short turned the dusty old theater
into an intimate cocktail lounge.
He sang a number of obscure old
Rogers and Hart and Gershwin
tunes and saved a few Cole Porter
songs for encores, but dignified
them all with his refined manner,
smokey voice, and perfect enun
ciation. Watching Bobby Short
almost makes one yearn for those
elegant days long-gone â€” days of
Cole Porter, Noel Coward and
sororities at Stanford.
