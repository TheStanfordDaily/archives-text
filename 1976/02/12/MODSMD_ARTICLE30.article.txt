# Tyner, Jarrett:
## Elegant jazz piano RECORDS 
### Dave Smith 
Most jazz musicians have a re
latively short creative lifetime —
which makes McCoy Tyner's
achievements seem even more
extraordinary. Regardless of
who's winning the magazine polls
and selling the most records,
Tyner has been the important jazz
pianist since his debut with John
Coltrane around 1960.
Two of the members of that first
Coltrane quartet, bassist Steve
Davis and Coltrane himself, are
dead, but drummer Elvin Jones is
still an eccentric giant on his in
strument.
And over fifteen years after they
first played together, Jones and
Tyner have been reunited on
Tyner's newest Milestone album,
Trident. The addition of bassist
Ron Carter makes the cast of Tri
dent a sort of "dream trio" — one
of the finest ever to record.
Although Tyner plays some
harpsichord and celeste on the al

bum, much of the force of Trident
comes from his superb, solid
acoustic piano, played in a style
that has become richer and louder
but is essentially the same as the
one he introduced 15 years ago.
This is Tyner's most conserva
tive album in years, largely due to
the absence of saxophones and
percussion, two features in
Tyner's regular group.
Carter's solos are particularly
good — although he's been a
sideman on hundreds of jazz al
bums, he rarely gets a chance to
put down three acoustic bass
solos on the same record, as he
does here. Jones is, as usual, a
dynamo, while Tyner makes ver
sions of Coltrane's "Impressions"

and Thelonious Monk's ballad
"Ruby, My Dear" the best back
to-back tracks on any recent jazz
release.
Keith Jarrett, another highly inf
luential pianist, has earned most
of his critical praise for his solo
albums. But if the eclectic
mishmash of his solo perfor
mances is greatly overrated, his
quintet recordings are too often
overlooked.
The latest from the Jarrett
group, Backhand (ABC records),
is probably the quintet's best, rely
ing on a rare sympathy in the
styles of the five musicians to
create its mood. Tenor
saxophonist Dewey Redman has
a solo style at least as impressive
as Jarrett's, and percussionist
Guilherme Franco, a wild man
when he plays with Tyner, is more
restrained and musical with Jar
rett.
The two pianists show styles
that are hardly similar, with Tyner
relying more on pedal technique,
dissonance and sheer strength,
Jarrett on a more traditional style
— perhaps classically-influenced
— that pays more attention to
melody. In contrast to Tyner, he
sometimes sounds anemic — but
there are few pianists who don't.

dynamo, while Tyner makes ver
sions of Coltrane's "Impressions"

and Thelonious Monk's ballad
"Ruby, My Dear" the best back
to-back tracks on any recent jazz
release.
Keith Jarrett, another highly inf
luential pianist, has earned most
of his critical praise for his solo
albums. But if the eclectic
mishmash of his solo perfor
mances is greatly overrated, his
quintet recordings are too often
overlooked.
The latest from the Jarrett
group, Backhand (ABC records),
is probably the quintet's best, rely
ing on a rare sympathy in the
styles of the five musicians to
create its mood. Tenor
saxophonist Dewey Redman has
a solo style at least as impressive
as Jarrett's, and percussionist
Guilherme Franco, a wild man
when he plays with Tyner, is more
restrained and musical with Jar
rett.
The two pianists show styles
that are hardly similar, with Tyner
relying more on pedal technique,
dissonance and sheer strength,
Jarrett on a more traditional style
— perhaps classically-influenced
— that pays more attention to
melody. In contrast to Tyner, he
sometimes sounds anemic — but
there are few pianists who don't.
Most jazz musicians have a re
latively short creative lifetime —
which makes McCoy Tyner's
achievements seem even more
extraordinary. Regardless of
who's winning the magazine polls
and selling the most records,
Tyner has been the important jazz
pianist since his debut with John
Coltrane around 1960.
Two of the members of that first
Coltrane quartet, bassist Steve
Davis and Coltrane himself, are
dead, but drummer Elvin Jones is
still an eccentric giant on his in
strument.
And over fifteen years after they
first played together, Jones and
Tyner have been reunited on
Tyner's newest Milestone album,
Trident. The addition of bassist
Ron Carter makes the cast of Tri
dent a sort of "dream trio" — one
of the finest ever to record.
Although Tyner plays some
harpsichord and celeste on the al

bum, much of the force of Trident
comes from his superb, solid
acoustic piano, played in a style
that has become richer and louder
but is essentially the same as the
one he introduced 15 years ago.
This is Tyner's most conserva
tive album in years, largely due to
the absence of saxophones and
percussion, two features in
Tyner's regular group.
Carter's solos are particularly
good — although he's been a
sideman on hundreds of jazz al
bums, he rarely gets a chance to
put down three acoustic bass
solos on the same record, as he
does here. Jones is, as usual, a
dynamo, while Tyner makes ver
sions of Coltrane's "Impressions"

and Thelonious Monk's ballad
"Ruby, My Dear" the best back
