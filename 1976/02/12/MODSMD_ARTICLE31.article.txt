## Folk-singer to play Sunday 
### Perry Simon 
Janis lan, whose introspective
ballads have given her one of the
biggest comebacks in musical his
tory, will perform this Sunday
evening, Feb. 15, at 8 in Maples
Pavilion. Last month, the singer
songwriter headed the list of
Grammy nominees, beating out
such illuminaries as Paul Somon,
Linda Ronstadt and even Elton
John. "At Seventeen," the single
from a recent album called Bet
ween the Lines, was nominated
as record of the year and song of
the year, while Between the Lines
was nominated for album of the
year and lan was nominated for
best female pop vocalist.
Truth is Janis lan's stock in
trade, and, in concert, the truth
pours out. Dealing with the dis
quieting verdicts of 20th cen
tury life is what sets her apart from
other performers. Rather than
disguise them in saccarine trap
pings, she does everything possi
ble to illuminate them, whatever
the cost to her audience or herself.
Lita Eliseu writes in Phonog
raph Record magazine: "The new
album, Aftertones, has what might
be called the typical Janis lan feel
to it, a bittersweet regretful nostal
gia, phrases jumping out of the
lyrics, giving the music a texture
and solidity which usually es
capes people trying to write
'meaningful' lyrics."
Janis found her truth in music
very early and stuck to it. At three,
she began studying classical
piano, and, seven years later, she
began to write poetry.
In 1966, at the age of 16, Janis
lan wrote a song called "Society's
Child' and became an overnight

success, the child prodigy of popu
lar music. Then, after a brilliant
performance at the Philharmonic
in 1966, she disappeared.
After years of self-imposed
exile, lan has returned with a pro
nounced new talent for orchestra
tion, to become the complete
singer-composer-instrumentalist
arrange. Developing these vari
ous talents has given her work a
unity of purpose hardtoduplicate.
Life offstage for lan is quiet and
personal — spent with a small
group of friends. Poetry still gets
much of her attention with Wallace
Stevens and William Carlos Wil
liams among her favorites. When
she listens to music, it is Edith
Piaf, Odetta and Billie Holliday
who get the most play. (A friend of
long standing, Odetta contributed
a background vocal to lan's latest
album, Aftertones.
Like the tunes on Between the
Lines, much of her newest work is
concerned with the thin line divid
ing realty from illusion, the trans
actions that facilitate relationships
and, of course, the obsession with
the act of performing itself.
Yet, much has changed. Her
recent success has allowed an in
nate sense of humor to bubble up
from inside and replace the tinges
of bitterness with the ability to
laugh at herself.
At the core, though, lan remains
a truthseeker and a truthsayer.
Acceptance hasn't changed the
direction of her quest but merely
made her a little more comfortable
while she pursues her artistic go
als. In an interview a while back
she said, "I deal in truths. My au
dience wants to feel they are get
ting the truth from me."
