# War, Cold Blood
## Soul hits Santa Clara ROCK 
### Roy S. Johnson 
War had been declared. Most
knew it would be tough, but all
were eager. Shortly before mid
night. it was over. But when the
rock group, War, left the Univer
sity of Santa Clara's Levey Pavill
ion last Saturday, none of the au
dience's battle scars were those
of disappointment.
Cold Blood, a local band, led by
the powerful voice and Joe
Cocker-like movements of lead
singer Lydia Pense, shed almost a
hour of their disco-rock sounds for
a strong warm-up. Their sensuous
numbers, "I Want to Make Love to
You" and "Let Me Be The One,"
lured the crowd into their grasp.
Behind the stage stood a huge
screen that almost over-powered
the stage itself. As the house
lights were dimmed, the crowd
seemed to sense that something
different was coming. The murmur
of the crowd grew with their antici
pation as the first few notes of
War's latest hit, "Why Can't We
Be Friends?" were recognized.

But the stage was dark . .. real
War had not yet begun.
An image engulfed the screen
and was simultaneously projected
onto the domed ceiling above. It
was a film showing members of
the group acting out the verses to
the song that was playing. It was
only at the end of the tape re
corded rendition of the tune that
the live musicians meandered on
stage as the well-known grinning
face from the cover of War's last
album encompassed the screen.
Early music
The band launced into a selec
tion of their early music including
"Southern Part of Texas" and
"Low RidP r " During the latter tune
the image of an old Buick, port
holes and all, appeared on the sc
reen.
In less than two hours, War had
thrashed out 10 numbers, includ
ing an encore, ranging from their
newest hits to classics from over
the past decade. The group is
composed of a powerful rhythm

section including Harold Brown on
drums, mammoth Papa Dee
Allen on congas (and anything
else pecussionable), 8.8. Dicker
son on bass, Lonnie Jordan on
Keyboards, saxophonist Charles
Miller, Lee Osker with the har
monica and Howard Scott on lead
guitar.
After an extended rendition of
"Heartbeat," War left the stage.
Five minutes of steady applause
followed and flickering matches
dotted the darkness.
Gut-releasing
Osker returned alone. With a
15-minute harmonica solo he
moved the audience from a mel
low, but plodding ' down-home"
beat to an all-out gut-releasing
finish. It was the highlight of the
show. For many that might have
been enough, but for the hard
core War follower ecstasy was
reached when the group went
"Slippin' Into Darkness" for their
finale.
