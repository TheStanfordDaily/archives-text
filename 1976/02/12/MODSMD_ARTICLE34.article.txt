HQ in Angola taken

supplied Angola Popular Movement
(MPLA) yesterday captured Silva Porto,
military headquarters of the National Union
(UNITA), according to a spokesman for the
Western-backed faction in the Angolan civil
war.

sources also said it was almost certain that
two coastal cities — Benguela and Lobito
— had fallen or would soon be under control
of the MPLA. which is fighting along with
Cuban troops for control of the southwest
African land, a former Portuguese colony.
On Saturday the MPLA took San Antonio
do Zaire, the northern stronghold of the Na
tional Front (FNLA) and over-ran Huambo,
the provisional UNITA and FNLA capital, 90
miles west of Silva Porto
Novo Redondo. north of Benguela and
Lobito, also has fallen to the MPLA.
The UNITA spokesman said its appeal
for Western military aid is meeting no re
sponse.
MD suit issue deferred
SAN FRANCISCO — The California
Medical Association (CMA) decided yes
terday not to take its fight for changes in the
handling of malpractice suits to the public
voting booth this year
At the conclusion of its annual meeting,
theCMA's House of Delegates created a
special legal commission to review two re
solutions which called for statewide ballot
initiatives to resolve the malpractice crisis.
Both measures, which would have
needed nearly 500,000 signatures by mid-

June to qualify for the November ballot,
would have removed malpractice cases
from the court and jury system.
But one proposal called for creation of an
arbitration system while the other would
have set up a state patient compensation
board.
The House of Delegates was scheduled
to vote on the proposals yesterday but in
stead chose to refer them to a Commission
on Tort Reform for further study.
The commission was told to issue a re
port that could be acted upon before the
CMA's 1978 election of officers.
CIA to fire newsmen
WASHINGTON — As the House Intelli
gence Committee went out of existence
yesterday, CIA Director George Bush ag
reed to one of its recommendations by or
dering removal ov any full-time or part-time
U.S. journalists from the agency's payroll.
The CIA announcement said first that the
agency has "no secret paid or contractual
relationship with any American clergyman
or missionary" and that "this practice will be
continued as a matter of policy."
Then it said a similar ban would apply to
"any full-time or part-time news correspon
dents accredited by any U.S. news service,
newspaper, periodicals, radio or TV net
work or station."

The previous director, William Colby,
said the United States no longer used full
time journalists as agents but would con
tinue to rely on part-time reporters or strin
gers. Bush said the CIA would still welcome
voluntary assistance from newsmen.
Meanwhile, FBI Director Clarence Kelley
said that too much restrictive legislation
over the agency's domestic intelligence ac
tivities may hamper its ability to investigate
terrorist groups in the future.
The House Committee's proposed FBI
guidelines prohibit the commission or insti
gation by the FBI of criminal acts; the dis
semination of information for the purpose of
holding an individual or group up to scorn,
ridicule, or disgrace; the dissemination of
information anonymously or under false
identity; and the incitement of vio
lence.
Chavez calls for boycott
SACRAMENTO — Cesar Chavez, frus
trated at the suspension of California's farm
labor elections, called a new United Farm
Workers (UFW) boycott yesterday against
selected raisin, grape and fruit growers.
Chavez said the new campaign to revive
the state's farm labor board will have three
prongs: the boycott, pressure on legislators
to drop their opposition and an attempt to
put the issue before voters.

But the first and most dramatic step is an
international boycott against Sunmaid
raisins, Sunsweet prunes and dried fruit,
and eight major grape and tree fruit growers
in the Fresno area.
The farm labor leader said the boycott
would be aimed at growers who led the fight
against a $3.8-million appropriation to keep
the farm labor board alive through June.
Giants 'saved' for SF
SAN FRANCISCO — "Bobby Thomson
lives!" a smiling Mayor George Moscone
said yesterday after revealing a last
minute, $8-million offer which apparently
will keep the San Francisco Giants here.
The mayor brought together former
Texas Rangers' owner Bob Short and San
Francisco businessman Robert Lurie, who
said they would be equal partners in run
ning the Giants, to bid on the National
League team which seemed headed for To
ronto.
Moscone, after referring to the dramatic
ninth-inning homerun by the long-since re
tired Thomson, which sent the New York
Giants to the 1951 World Series, acknow
ledged in a news conference later that the
Giants' financial problems which forced
Horace Stoneham to sell made his search
for $8 million a difficult one.
