Nov. 19, 1976 —Santa Clara
County sheriff's deputies yester
day broke up a demonstration by
Stanford students at Lockheed
Research Laboratories in the
Stanford Industrial Park and ar
rested four demonstrators. The
students were protesting Loc
kheed's role in the production of
the Poseidon nuclear missile.
A Sheriff's Department spokes
person said four alleged leaders
of the demonstration were booked
on charges of "interfering with the
national defense," "obstructing
government functions by physical
interference" and "inciting others
to engage in imminent lawless
conduct that threatens the sec
urity of the federal goverment."
Sound outrageous? Such inci
dents could become com
monplace if Senate Bill One
(SB1), the Criminal Justice Re
form Act of 1975, is passed by
Congress.
Many of SBI 's provisions are in
violation of First Amendment
guarantees, according to noted
legal scholars like Prof. Vern
Countryman of Harvard Law
School and Prof. Thomas Emer
son of Vale Law School.
Tighten hold
Many allow the executive
branch of our government to
tighten its hold on classified infor
mation and to stifle or punish criti
cism of its policies. Others reduce
the rights of persons suspected of
a crime; still others establish
prison sentences of inflexible and
unreasonable length.
Sen. Birch Bayh (D-lnd.), one of
the original sponsors of SBI,
withdrew from sponsorship after
numerous conversations with
people around the country con
vinced him, in his own words, his
"initial judgment was wrong."
Bayh, like many other members of
both houses of Congress, is now
trying to correct the bill's problems
through the amendment process.
However, SBI is inherently un
amendable. It contains so many
vaguely-worded or explicitly
repressive provision that the
time-consuming process of
amendment could not deal with

them properly.
More important, the bill reflects
in its fundamental assumptions
the fearful and corrupt attitude of
the Nixon administration.
Best voice
How can we best voice our op
position to SB1? The bill is ex
pected to arrive on the Senate
floor around the end of February,
so the top priority now is to write,
call or send telegrams to one's
homestate Senators urging them
to work to defeat SBI and to send
it back to committee for total red
rafting.
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) is
presently working on amend
ments to SBI. We must urge him
to give his efforts over to defeating
the bill in its entirety. Sen. John
Tunney (D-Cal.) must also be
pressured to work against the bill.
Cranston has close ties with
Sen Gary Hart (D-Colo.), a
member of the Judicary Commit
tee, here the bill is now being con
sidered. We should ask Cranston
to encourage Hart to speak out
against SRI in the committee

hearings.
Bayh, because he is a candi
date for President this year, will be
apt to listen to voters outside his
home state. We should pressure
him to oppose the bill firmly in
stead of trying to amend it.
In the House of Reprsentatives,
Rep. Charles Wiggins (D-Cal) has
introduced HB 3907, a companion
measure to SBI. Again, our home
district representatives must be
convinced to oppose this mea
sure. Our local representative,
Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park),is trying to amend HB 3907
— we must tell him to oppose it.
Don Edwards, a Northern
California representative, has
co-spnsored HB 10850, which
would delete the objectionable
sections of HB 3907. We should
write Edwards to support his ef
forts and should urge our own re
presentatives to vote for HB 10850.
I encourage you to educate
yourselves about SBI and to unite
in opposition to it.

Nov. 19, 1976 —Santa Clara
County sheriff's deputies yester
day broke up a demonstration by
Stanford students at Lockheed
Research Laboratories in the
Stanford Industrial Park and ar
rested four demonstrators. The
students were protesting Loc
kheed's role in the production of
the Poseidon nuclear missile.
A Sheriff's Department spokes
person said four alleged leaders
of the demonstration were booked
on charges of "interfering with the
national defense," "obstructing
government functions by physical
interference" and "inciting others
to engage in imminent lawless
conduct that threatens the sec
urity of the federal goverment."
Sound outrageous? Such inci
dents could become com
monplace if Senate Bill One
(SB1), the Criminal Justice Re
form Act of 1975, is passed by
Congress.
Many of SBI 's provisions are in
violation of First Amendment
guarantees, according to noted
legal scholars like Prof. Vern
Countryman of Harvard Law
School and Prof. Thomas Emer
son of Vale Law School.
Tighten hold
Many allow the executive
branch of our government to
tighten its hold on classified infor
mation and to stifle or punish criti
cism of its policies. Others reduce
the rights of persons suspected of
a crime; still others establish
prison sentences of inflexible and
unreasonable length.
Sen. Birch Bayh (D-lnd.), one of
the original sponsors of SBI,
withdrew from sponsorship after
numerous conversations with
people around the country con
vinced him, in his own words, his
"initial judgment was wrong."
Bayh, like many other members of
both houses of Congress, is now
trying to correct the bill's problems
through the amendment process.
However, SBI is inherently un
amendable. It contains so many
vaguely-worded or explicitly
repressive provision that the
time-consuming process of
amendment could not deal with

them properly.
More important, the bill reflects
in its fundamental assumptions
the fearful and corrupt attitude of
the Nixon administration.
Best voice
How can we best voice our op
position to SB1? The bill is ex
pected to arrive on the Senate
floor around the end of February,
so the top priority now is to write,
call or send telegrams to one's
homestate Senators urging them
to work to defeat SBI and to send
it back to committee for total red
rafting.
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) is
presently working on amend
ments to SBI. We must urge him
to give his efforts over to defeating
the bill in its entirety. Sen. John
Tunney (D-Cal.) must also be
pressured to work against the bill.
Cranston has close ties with
Sen Gary Hart (D-Colo.), a
member of the Judicary Commit
tee, here the bill is now being con
sidered. We should ask Cranston
to encourage Hart to speak out
against SRI in the committee

hearings.
Bayh, because he is a candi
date for President this year, will be
apt to listen to voters outside his
home state. We should pressure
him to oppose the bill firmly in
stead of trying to amend it.
In the House of Reprsentatives,
Rep. Charles Wiggins (D-Cal) has
introduced HB 3907, a companion
measure to SBI. Again, our home
district representatives must be
convinced to oppose this mea
sure. Our local representative,
Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park),is trying to amend HB 3907
— we must tell him to oppose it.
Don Edwards, a Northern
California representative, has
co-spnsored HB 10850, which
would delete the objectionable
sections of HB 3907. We should
write Edwards to support his ef
forts and should urge our own re
presentatives to vote for HB 10850.
I encourage you to educate
yourselves about SBI and to unite
in opposition to it.
