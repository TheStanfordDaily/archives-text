### Bonny Rodden 
SAN FRANCISCO — Controversial statements indicating Patricia
Hearst said she voluntarily participated in the Hibernia Bank robbery
April 15, 1974, are admissible evidence, U.S. District Court Judge
Oliver Carter ruled yesterday.
"By a proponderance of the evidence, the government has estab
lished statements made by the defendant after the happening of the
bank robbery, either by tape recordings, orally or in writing, were made
voluntarily," the judge said.
Hearst testified earlier this week that the Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA) forced her to state she participated voluntarily.
Carter s ruling ended a three-day hearing to decide whether the
prosecution could present the crucial statements to the jury. The trial
of Hearst on bank robbery charges resumed yesterday afternoon.
The defense argued the statements were inadmissible evidence
because they were made under duress, while the prosecution con
tended they were voluntary.

The ruling, a major blow to the
defense, was not very surprising,
according to defense attorney F.
Lee Bailey.
"The jury is now permitted by
itself to decide" whether the
statements were voluntary, Bailey
remarked in a press conference
after Carter's declaration.
Before the judge ruled. Bailey
stated that permitting the state
ments as evidence would encour
age other radical groups to kidnap
individuals, involve them in crimes
and force them to state they par
ticipated willingly.
U.S. Attorney James L. Brown
ing Jr. argued. "If this court fore
closes this evidence from the jury,
the jury will be deprived of highly
probatory evidence."
He remarked that Hearst could
have escaped countless times
and that "the claim of coercion is
not true."
Browning rhetorically asked
why Hearst didn't slip a message
to her parents via Thomas Matth
ews. Matthews was the young
man allegedly kidnaped by the
SLA in Los Angeles after a scuffle
in front of Mel's Sporting Goods
Store.
Browning also asked if Hearst
were still a captive, why had SLA
members William and Emily Har
ris left her alone in the van with
two automatic weapons in form
front of Mel's?
Finally, Browning asked, "Why,
on earth, if she feared the Har
rises, why would she fire bullets to
rescue her comrades."
When i.ie trial resumed, one
prosecution witness, Matthews,
told the jury what the public
learned in the hearing Tuesday —
that in the van Hearst confided to
Matthews her willing participation
in the bank robbery.
Matthews said Hearst "told me
she was a willing participant and
could have used her weapon." He
testified she denied reports that

she was tied to her gun and that
the other SLA members had guns
trained on her.
Matthews said he did not rec
ognize Hearst when first intro
duced to her in the back of his van.
However, Harris "stated it was
Tania (Hearst), and then both he
and Tania smiled," he added.
Hearst also told Matthews that
she decided to side with the SLA
once she learned her father had
not done enough in the food dis
tribution project, Matthews tes
tified.
Bailey asked Matthews who in
formed Hearst of her father's con
tribution to the project.
Matthews said he could not re
member her saying how she
found out. He admitted, however,
testifying earlier yesterday that
she said she had heard from
members of the SLA.
Bailey shouted at another pro
secution witness, Anthony
Shepard, demanding to know
whether his testimony had
changed after talking with Brown
ing.
Carter reprimanded Bailey for
his tone of voice.
Shepard testified earlier yes
terday under Browning's question
ing that he scuffled with the Har
rises May 16,1974, in front of the
sportirg goods store.
Bailey presented to the court
the transcript of Shepard's report
to the Los Angeles police the day
of the sporting goods store inci
dent. Bailey pointed out that
Shepard did not identify the Har
rises at that time.
Browning objected that
Shepard was not asked to identify
them.
"It was after a conference with
Mr. Browning that you first iden
tified them as Emily and Bill Har
ris," Bailey said, raising his voice.
"Yes," Shepard answered
quietly.

Matthews said he did not rec

However, Harris "stated it was

Hearst also told Matthews that
she decided to side with the SLA
once she learned her father had

Bailey asked Matthews who in
formed Hearst of her father's con
tribution to the project.
Matthews said he could not re

Bailey shouted at another pro

Shepard, demanding to know

Carter reprimanded Bailey for

Shepard testified earlier yes

Bailey presented to the court
the transcript of Shepard's report

SAN FRANCISCO — Controversial statements indicating Patricia
Hearst said she voluntarily participated in the Hibernia Bank robbery
April 15, 1974, are admissible evidence, U.S. District Court Judge
Oliver Carter ruled yesterday.
"By a proponderance of the evidence, the government has estab
lished statements made by the defendant after the happening of the
bank robbery, either by tape recordings, orally or in writing, were made
voluntarily," the judge said.
Hearst testified earlier this week that the Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA) forced her to state she participated voluntarily.
Carter s ruling ended a three-day hearing to decide whether the
prosecution could present the crucial statements to the jury. The trial
of Hearst on bank robbery charges resumed yesterday afternoon.
The defense argued the statements were inadmissible evidence
because they were made under duress, while the prosecution con
tended they were voluntary.

The ruling, a major blow to the
defense, was not very surprising,
according to defense attorney F.
Lee Bailey.
"The jury is now permitted by
itself to decide" whether the
statements were voluntary, Bailey
remarked in a press conference
after Carter's declaration.
Before the judge ruled. Bailey
stated that permitting the state
ments as evidence would encour
age other radical groups to kidnap
individuals, involve them in crimes
and force them to state they par
ticipated willingly.
U.S. Attorney James L. Brown
ing Jr. argued. "If this court fore
closes this evidence from the jury,
the jury will be deprived of highly
probatory evidence."
He remarked that Hearst could
have escaped countless times
and that "the claim of coercion is
not true."
Browning rhetorically asked
why Hearst didn't slip a message
to her parents via Thomas Matth
ews. Matthews was the young
man allegedly kidnaped by the
SLA in Los Angeles after a scuffle
in front of Mel's Sporting Goods
Store.
Browning also asked if Hearst
were still a captive, why had SLA
members William and Emily Har
ris left her alone in the van with
two automatic weapons in form
front of Mel's?
Finally, Browning asked, "Why,
on earth, if she feared the Har
rises, why would she fire bullets to
rescue her comrades."
When i.ie trial resumed, one
prosecution witness, Matthews,
told the jury what the public
learned in the hearing Tuesday —
that in the van Hearst confided to
Matthews her willing participation
in the bank robbery.
Matthews said Hearst "told me
she was a willing participant and
could have used her weapon." He
testified she denied reports that

she was tied to her gun and that
the other SLA members had guns
trained on her.
Matthews said he did not rec
ognize Hearst when first intro
duced to her in the back of his van.
However, Harris "stated it was
