## Hearst remarks usable in court 
### Bonny Rodden 
SAN FRANCISCO — Controversial statements indicating Patricia
Hearst said she voluntarily participated in the Hibernia Bank robbery
April 15, 1974, are admissible evidence, U.S. District Court Judge
Oliver Carter ruled yesterday.
"By a proponderance of the evidence, the government has estab
lished statements made by the defendant after the happening of the
bank robbery, either by tape recordings, orally or in writing, were made
voluntarily," the judge said.
Hearst testified earlier this week that the Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA) forced her to state she participated voluntarily.
Carter s ruling ended a three-day hearing to decide whether the
prosecution could present the crucial statements to the jury. The trial
of Hearst on bank robbery charges resumed yesterday afternoon.
The defense argued the statements were inadmissible evidence
because they were made under duress, while the prosecution con
tended they were voluntary.

The ruling, a major blow to the
defense, was not very surprising,
according to defense attorney F.
Lee Bailey.
"The jury is now permitted by
itself to decide" whether the
statements were voluntary, Bailey
remarked in a press conference
after Carter's declaration.
Before the judge ruled. Bailey
stated that permitting the state
ments as evidence would encour
age other radical groups to kidnap
individuals, involve them in crimes
and force them to state they par

U.S. Attorney James L. Brown

closes this evidence from the jury,
the jury will be deprived of highly
probatory evidence."
He remarked that Hearst could
have escaped countless times
and that "the claim of coercion is
not true."
Browning rhetorically asked
why Hearst didn't slip a message
to her parents via Thomas Matth
ews. Matthews was the young
man allegedly kidnaped by the
SLA in Los Angeles after a scuffle
in front of Mel's Sporting Goods
Store.
Browning also asked if Hearst
were still a captive, why had SLA
members William and Emily Har
ris left her alone in the van with
two automatic weapons in form
front of Mel's?
Finally, Browning asked, "Why,
on earth, if she feared the Har
rises, why would she fire bullets to
rescue her comrades."
When i.ie trial resumed, one
prosecution witness, Matthews,
told the jury what the public
learned in the hearing Tuesday —
that in the van Hearst confided to
Matthews her willing participation
in the bank robbery.
Matthews said Hearst "told me
she was a willing participant and
could have used her weapon." He
testified she denied reports that
