Protesting unsafe working con
ditions, 10 employe., ..alked 112
the job Tuesday night at the Stan
ford Center for Information Pro
cessing (SCIP) facility in the
basement of Encina Hall.
Following an agreement with
the University on improving condi
tions, the employes returned to

work.
According to Anthony Sidlow,
safety and health manager, the
walkout was not exactly a strike.
"They just refused to perform an
assigned task," he said.
The employes were abiding by
a union-University contract signed
in 1974, which includes provisions
for employes who refuse to work

because of "abnormally danger
ous conditions."
In response to the workers' ac
tions, a local safety committee
met yesterday morning to con
sider a list of 29 safety deficien
cies. A target date of May 15 was
set for the completion of these im
provements.
Lack of space
The primary safety hazard, ac
cording to James Byrd, SCIP pro
duction service manager, is lack
of space. SCIP is in the process of
changing to a more efficient, com
pact type of machinery which will
result in more working area, he
said.
These plans were already
started at the time of the walkout,
Byrd said, but he added, "some
times progress takes time."
Humberto Narvaez, Stanford
Fire Department inspector, cited
the installation of new emergency
lighting as another needed im
provement.
Because of the machinery in the
center, SCIP's present lighting
system is ineffective, he said
Union stewards
United Stanford Employees
(USE) stewards at SCIP
suggested five immediate im
provements: temporary safety
lights, fire extinguisher signs, first
aid kits, insulated extension cords
and covered holes.
If these improvements had not
been completed by last night, the
employes threatened to once
more refuse to work.

Employe spokesman Mike
Coleman said this was not the first
time workers had mentioned the
safety hazards to management.
As early as last October, the
employes had submitted a list of
alleged safety deficiencies, he
said.
But, he added, nothing got
done. "The only way we're going
to get something accomplished is
to keep the pressure on," he said.
October improvements
According to Byrd, however,
some significant improvements
were made in October, including
the installation of outside lighting.
Plans for further improvements
were made, but the results were
not immediate, he said.
Other deficiencies listed by the
employes included loose obsta
cles on the floor, jagged exposed
articles, poor fire exits, dangerous
high-voltage warning devices,
slippery floors, lack of emergency
drills, possible water leakage into
electrical units, a congested tape
library, a brick ceiling that could
collapse during an earthquake
and obstructions within 30 feet of
the power control.
Byrd said the walkout had only a
"limited impact" on the opera
tions. Most of the processing was
completed, he said.
The following employes refused
to go to work: Pat Luma, Tom
Prussing. Rich Condon, Gary
Salaices, Bob Beattie, Robert
Owens, Janet Fulcher, Alvino
Valencia, Raymond Barrett and
James Matous

Other deficiencies listed by the
employes included loose obsta
cles on the floor, jagged exposed
articles, poor fire exits, dangerous
high-voltage warning devices,
slippery floors, lack of emergency
drills, possible water leakage into
electrical units, a congested tape
library, a brick ceiling that could
collapse during an earthquake
and obstructions within 30 feet of
the power control.
Byrd said the walkout had only a
"limited impact" on the opera
tions. Most of the processing was
completed, he said.
The following employes refused
to go to work: Pat Luma, Tom
Prussing. Rich Condon, Gary
Salaices, Bob Beattie, Robert
Owens, Janet Fulcher, Alvino

James Matous
Protesting unsafe working con
ditions, 10 employe., ..alked 112
the job Tuesday night at the Stan
ford Center for Information Pro
cessing (SCIP) facility in the
basement of Encina Hall.
Following an agreement with
the University on improving condi
tions, the employes returned to

work.
According to Anthony Sidlow,
safety and health manager, the
walkout was not exactly a strike.
"They just refused to perform an
assigned task," he said.
The employes were abiding by
a union-University contract signed
in 1974, which includes provisions
for employes who refuse to work

because of "abnormally danger
ous conditions."
In response to the workers' ac
tions, a local safety committee
met yesterday morning to con
sider a list of 29 safety deficien
cies. A target date of May 15 was
set for the completion of these im
provements.
Lack of space
The primary safety hazard, ac
cording to James Byrd, SCIP pro
duction service manager, is lack
of space. SCIP is in the process of
changing to a more efficient, com
pact type of machinery which will
result in more working area, he
said.
These plans were already
started at the time of the walkout,
Byrd said, but he added, "some
times progress takes time."
Humberto Narvaez, Stanford
Fire Department inspector, cited
the installation of new emergency
lighting as another needed im
provement.
Because of the machinery in the
center, SCIP's present lighting
system is ineffective, he said
Union stewards
United Stanford Employees
(USE) stewards at SCIP
suggested five immediate im
provements: temporary safety
lights, fire extinguisher signs, first
aid kits, insulated extension cords
and covered holes.
If these improvements had not
been completed by last night, the
employes threatened to once
more refuse to work.

Employe spokesman Mike
Coleman said this was not the first
time workers had mentioned the
safety hazards to management.
As early as last October, the
employes had submitted a list of
alleged safety deficiencies, he
said.
But, he added, nothing got
done. "The only way we're going
to get something accomplished is
to keep the pressure on," he said.
October improvements
According to Byrd, however,
some significant improvements
were made in October, including
the installation of outside lighting.
Plans for further improvements
were made, but the results were
not immediate, he said.
Other deficiencies listed by the
employes included loose obsta
cles on the floor, jagged exposed
articles, poor fire exits, dangerous
high-voltage warning devices,
slippery floors, lack of emergency
