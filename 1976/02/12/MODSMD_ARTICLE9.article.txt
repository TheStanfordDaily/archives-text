# Professorship panel seeks accreditation

### Bruce Kadden 
Members of the ASSU Guest
Professorship Board are currently
arranging for official appointments
for Angela Davis, Claude Steiner
and Ernest Mandel, and accredi
tation of their courses through
departments and the Under
graduate Specials (US) program.
The Philosophy Department
last weekend, in response to re
quests by the board, adopted a
statement of the "Sense of the
Department" which says that
Davis' proposed course would
"qualify for credit in the depart
ment."
The statement added that the
criteria were the same "used for
assessing other courses taught by
persons without an appointment
in the Philosophy Department."
However, the statement did not

recommend Davis for a short-term
appointment as the board asked,
cautiously stating that "the ASSU
should have the right to initiate
and forward directly to the Pro
vost's Office (without review by
any department), the appointment
of the ASSU Guest Professor.''
Blythe Mickelson, a member of
the board, said that the board is
"working through other depart
ments and the Undergraduate
Specials office" for Davis' ap
pointment.
No approval problem
Laura Selznick, coordinator of
the US program, said she didn't
think "they'll have any problem"
getting the courses approved pro
vided they submit detailed syllabi
by next week.
If the courses are taught
through US, the instructors would
officially be considered lecturers
or preceptors, and each of the
classes would require a sponsor
from the Academic Council.
Steiner, contacted by the Daily
yesterday, said he would accept
the invitation to serve as a guest
professor. He would be teaching a
course titled "Psychiatry and Rad
ical Psychiatry."
Davis and Mandel could not be
reached, but Mickelson and board
member Bill Tyndall said they
were virtually positive Davis would
accept, while expressing pes
simism about the chances of
Mandel teaching here.
Mandel, a Marxist economist
from Belgium, has repeatedly
been denied a visa to the U.S. be
cause of his communist ideology.
Qualifications requested
Economics Dept. Chairman
Bert Hickman said he has re
quested Mandel's qualifications
and the course proposals, which
would be considered by the de
partment.
Mandel would teach courses
entitled "The Postwar Economy"
and "Economic and Political His
tory of the Labor Movements in

Europe."
The board will approach the
Psychology and Psychiatry De
partments for the sponsorship and
accreditation for Steiner, accord
ing to Tyndall. Steiner said he
would continue training radical
psychiatrists and work on the
journal Issues in Radical Therapy
spring quarter, while teaching
here.
Mickelson said sources of fund

ing besides the $10,000-plus from
the fee assessment are "still up in
the air."
Cynthia Davis of the Center for
Research on Women (CROW)
confirmed that the board had ap
proached CROW for additional
funds, but would not reveal the
amount of the request. She said
CROW will decide next week
whether to provide financial sup
port.
