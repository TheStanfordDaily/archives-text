# Professorship panel seeks accreditation

Members of the ASSU Guest
Professorship Board are currently
arranging for official appointments
for Angela Davis, Claude Steiner
and Ernest Mandel, and accredi
tation of their courses through
departments and the Under
graduate Specials (US) program.
The Philosophy Department
last weekend, in response to re
quests by the board, adopted a
statement of the "Sense of the
Department" which says that
Davis' proposed course would
"qualify for credit in the depart
ment."
The statement added that the
criteria were the same "used for
assessing other courses taught by
persons without an appointment
in the Philosophy Department."
However, the statement did not

recommend Davis for a short-term
appointment as the board asked,
cautiously stating that "the ASSU
should have the right to initiate
and forward directly to the Pro
vost's Office (without review by
any department), the appointment
of the ASSU Guest Professor.''
Blythe Mickelson, a member of
the board, said that the board is
"working through other depart
ments and the Undergraduate
Specials office" for Davis' ap
pointment.
No approval problem
Laura Selznick, coordinator of
the US program, said she didn't
think "they'll have any problem"
getting the courses approved pro
vided they submit detailed syllabi
by next week.
