Provost William Miller may be
under consideration for the presi
dency of Brown University.
Miller is currently in New York,
where according to Brown Daily
Herald Editor Noel Rubinton, the Uni
versity was scheduled to conduct in
terviews of those under consideration
yesterday and today. Rubinton said
about five or six persons are still being
considered.
On Monday, after returning to cam
pus this weekend, Miller will be going
to Providence, Rhode Island where
Brown is located.
Pat Miller, the provost's wife last
night denied that her husband is under
consideration for the Brown presi
dency. "He is in New York, but not for
that purpose," she said.
Rubinton said that "no campus in
terviews were scheduled for early next
week" but according to a Jan. 29 story
in the Herald, a student member of the
selection committee said that
"everyone ... on the final list will
have come to campus by the end of
February."
Under consideration
According to the Jan. 29 article, the
search committee had focused their
selection on three contenders outside
the University although about a dozen
non-Brown persons were still under
consideration.
The search committee is working
closely with the "Corporation's selec
tion committee" which will make the
final decision, accordng to the Herald.
The search committee will attempt to
reach a consensus with the selection
committee.
The search committee has not yet
considered a list of twenty candidates
from within Brown University. Ac
cording to the Herald, "speculation
continues that the president is not
likely to be chosen from that group."
Student protests
Brown President David Honig an
nounced last year that he would resign
at the end of this academic year. Prior
to the announcement, student protests
of the school's financial policies gen
erated numerous calls for his resigna
tion.
Students boycotted classes for a
week last spring to protest announced
cutbacks in financial aid, student ser
vices and faculty teaching time.
Following the strike, a coalition of
black, Latin American and Asian-
American students staged a two-day
sit-in which resulted in the Brown
administration agreeing to conses
sions in the areas of minority recruit
ment and faculty affirmative action.
Though Honig vigorously defended
the agreement, he said that he would
never again negotiate in a "crisis situa
tion" with people occupying build
ings.
