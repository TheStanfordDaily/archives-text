# UFW's rights violated

Gallo is now staging another
expensive advertising campaign
to convi nee consumers free elec
tions have happened for workers
and that it is now okay to buy
Gallo wines. This is not true.
An election happened at the
Gallo ranch last summer, but the
results are not yet conclusive.
The newly formed Agricultural
Labor Relation Board has not yet
certified the election and is in
fact bringing several complaints
against Gallo for unfair labor
practices.
In 1967 the United Farm
Workers (UFW) signed the first
contract with Gallo. The contract
was renegotiated in 1970.
When the contract came up for
renewal in 1973, Gallo had al
ready contacted the Teamsters
about organizing the workers.
An employer deciding on what
union should represent workers
instead of the workers deciding
for themselves is an obvious vio
lation of unionizing rights.
The workers under UFW con
tract went on strike against Gallo
in June 1973, when they experi
enced this "sweetheart" rela
tionship between Gallo and the
Teamsters.
Last summer.the Agricultural
Labor Relations Act was signed
into law in California. It pro
vided for free elections among
workers in the field and set up a
board to oversee the elections
and to receive complaints of vio
lations of the law.
Union access
The law provided for union
access to workers at designated
times of the day, and non
intimidation of workers when
they spoke with representatives
of eithei the Teamsters or the
UFW, among other rights. Elec
tions were held in September on
a Gallo ranch, but there were
several violations of the law
which the UFW brought before
the board.
The board would not certify
the validity of an election until a
hearing on complaints of viola
tions of the law has been held.
The board found enough sub
stance to the complaints brought
against Gallo and the Teamsters
by the lIFW to call for a hearing.
That hearing was scheduled to
begin on Feb. 2, in Merced
County.
But because the California
Legislature did not vote an ext
ension of funds to enable the

continuation of the board's
work, that hearing is not being
held. However, the assertion of
violations still exists and the
election held at the Gallo ranch
is still uncertified.
There are more than 50 com
plaints which the board would
have been asking Gallo to re
spond to in its Feb. 2 meeting.
Many of the complaints cite in
stances of intimidation of work
ers. unequal access granted to
UFW and Teamster organizers,
and overt favoring of Teamsters
by Gallo.
Board's changes
I quote directly from the
charges sent to Gallo by the
board, in the order they would
have appeared for a hearing on
Feb. 2:
"On or about Aug. 29.1975, at
or near its employment offices at
its Merced County premises a
supevisor d i scrim inat orally en
forced a non-solicitation rule by
denying to representatives of the
UFW, but granting to representa
tives of the Teamsters, access to
the premises for purposes of en
gaging in organizational ac
tivities.
"On or about Aug. 29, 1975, at
its Livingston Branch, company
agents engaged in or created the
impression of engaging in the
surveillance, including photo
graphic surveillance, of its
employees who were meeting
with or attempting to meet with
representatives of the UFW.
"On or about Sept. 2,1975, at its
Merced County premises, agents
retained a Teamster campaign
poster beside a seniority list on
its office bulletin board . . . (but)
denied to a UFW representative
permission to post a UFW cam
paign sticker on its picking aid,
on which a Teamster campaign
sticker was displayed and per
mitted to remain."
Now, only because money has
not been allotted to allow the
board to continue its investiga
tive and election certification
work, justice is halted. Gallo
would have us believe elections
have happened and workers
now have the union of their
choice.
This is simply not true. The
ballots are impounded and no
legal result has been declared.

Union access
The law provided for union
access to workers at designated
times of the day, and non
intimidation of workers when
they spoke with representatives
of eithei the Teamsters or the
UFW, among other rights. Elec
tions were held in September on
a Gallo ranch, but there were
several violations of the law
which the UFW brought before
the board.
The board would not certify
the validity of an election until a
hearing on complaints of viola
tions of the law has been held.
The board found enough sub
stance to the complaints brought
against Gallo and the Teamsters
by the lIFW to call for a hearing.
That hearing was scheduled to
begin on Feb. 2, in Merced
County.
But because the California
Legislature did not vote an ext
ension of funds to enable the

continuation of the board's
work, that hearing is not being
held. However, the assertion of
violations still exists and the
election held at the Gallo ranch
is still uncertified.
There are more than 50 com
plaints which the board would
have been asking Gallo to re
spond to in its Feb. 2 meeting.
Many of the complaints cite in
stances of intimidation of work
ers. unequal access granted to
UFW and Teamster organizers,
and overt favoring of Teamsters
by Gallo.
Board's changes
I quote directly from the
charges sent to Gallo by the
board, in the order they would
have appeared for a hearing on
Feb. 2:
"On or about Aug. 29.1975, at
or near its employment offices at
its Merced County premises a
supevisor d i scrim inat orally en
forced a non-solicitation rule by
denying to representatives of the
UFW, but granting to representa
tives of the Teamsters, access to
the premises for purposes of en
gaging in organizational ac
tivities.
"On or about Aug. 29, 1975, at
its Livingston Branch, company
agents engaged in or created the
impression of engaging in the
surveillance, including photo
graphic surveillance, of its
employees who were meeting
with or attempting to meet with
representatives of the UFW.
"On or about Sept. 2,1975, at its
Merced County premises, agents
retained a Teamster campaign
poster beside a seniority list on
its office bulletin board . . . (but)
denied to a UFW representative
permission to post a UFW cam
paign sticker on its picking aid,
on which a Teamster campaign
sticker was displayed and per
mitted to remain."
Now, only because money has
not been allotted to allow the
board to continue its investiga
tive and election certification
work, justice is halted. Gallo
would have us believe elections
have happened and workers
now have the union of their
choice.
This is simply not true. The
ballots are impounded and no
legal result has been declared.

Gallo is now staging another
expensive advertising campaign
to convi nee consumers free elec
tions have happened for workers
and that it is now okay to buy
Gallo wines. This is not true.
An election happened at the
Gallo ranch last summer, but the
results are not yet conclusive.
The newly formed Agricultural
Labor Relation Board has not yet
certified the election and is in
fact bringing several complaints
against Gallo for unfair labor
practices.
In 1967 the United Farm
Workers (UFW) signed the first
contract with Gallo. The contract
was renegotiated in 1970.
When the contract came up for
renewal in 1973, Gallo had al
ready contacted the Teamsters
about organizing the workers.
An employer deciding on what
union should represent workers
instead of the workers deciding
for themselves is an obvious vio
lation of unionizing rights.
The workers under UFW con
tract went on strike against Gallo
in June 1973, when they experi
enced this "sweetheart" rela
tionship between Gallo and the
Teamsters.
Last summer.the Agricultural
Labor Relations Act was signed
into law in California. It pro
vided for free elections among
workers in the field and set up a
board to oversee the elections
and to receive complaints of vio
