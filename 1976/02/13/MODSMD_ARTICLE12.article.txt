# Cleaver's return to United States
## 
### 
Old radicals never die (unless they are
gunned down by the FBI or the Oakland
police). Yet, unlike old soldiers, radicals
don't simply fade away either.
Tom Hayden and David Harris, out
stumping and thumping with their suits
and ties on, spring to mind almost im
mediately. Besides the aforementioned duo,
another former avatar of the late sixties ac
tivism has risen again on the domestic polit
ical horizon.
Eldridge Cleaver, author of Soul on Ice
and former Black Panther Party member,
returned to the United States on Nov. 18,
1975, after spending the previous seven
years as a fugitive in political exile.
The occasion of Cleaver's fleeing the
country in late 1968 deserves explanation.
Convicted of assault and attempting murder
in 1958, Cleaver was paroled from Soledad
prison in Dec. 1966.
Chief spokesman
Joining the Panthers in early 1967,
Cleaver became their chief spokesman after
the jailing of Huey Newton in Oct. 1967.
Achieving notoriety with the publication of
Soul on Ice in early 1968 and running for
President as the Peace and Freedom Party's
candidate, Cleaver traveled and lectured
widely (including a speech at Stanford).
Suffering from now documented FBI and
police harassment (lest we forget), Cleaver
and six other Panthers became involved in a
gun battle with the Oakland police on April
6, 1968, two days after Martin Luther King
was murdered.
Arrested on assault charges, Cleaver was
unable to go free even after the $50,000 hail
had been posted.
The California Adult Authority (CAA),
without formal inquiry, voted to revoke his

parole as a result of the assault charges.
Cleaver, in the minds of the CAA, was guilty
until proven innocent.
Habeas corpus
Challenging the arbitrary action of the
CAA, Cleaver was granted a writ of habeas
corpus by Superior Court Judge Raymond
Sherwin. In reaching his decision Judge
Sherwin found "not only was there absence
of cause for the cancellation of parole, it was

the product of a type of pressure unbecom
ing, to say the least, to the law enforcement
paraphrenalia of this state."
Cleaver was temporarily free.
However, the CAA quickly appealed
Sherwin's decision. In September, the Ap
pellate Court reversed on grounds the state
statues granted the CAA absolute jurisdic
tion in determining parole violations.
No re-examination of the evidence ever
took place. (The absolute authority of the
CAA has since, in effect, been denied by the
recent Rodriguez decision of the California
Supreme Court.
The date set for Cleaver's return to prison
was Nov. 27, 1968. That date found him in
Montreal.
Seven years later, after sojourns in Cuba,
Algeria, China, North Korea, North Viet
nam, the Soviet Union and France, Eldridge
Cleaver decided it was time to return home.

Upon his arrival in New York he was ar
rested and spirited away to eagerly-waiting
California authorities. Despite the Rod
riguez decision, Cleaver was again unable to
go free on bail because of the now clearly
fictitious charges of parole violation.
His lawyers are now preparing to seek
another writ of habeas corpus.
Meanwhile, Cleaver is locked up in the
jail atop the Alameda County Courthouse in
downtown Oakland. 1 visited him there
twice this past week.
Talking over a near ancient telephone in
tercom and looking at each other through a
patinated 4 by 10 inch glass slot, we
nevertheless managed to have a fairly tren
chant discussion/interview.
The leaven of exile has wrought some re
markable changes in Cleaver, who is now
40. Still quite articulate and eloquent,
Cleaver is saying things well worth our lis
tening to.
Subsequent columns in this space will be
devoted to presenting and analyzing
Cleaver's newpoliical stance, as revealed in
conversations with him and in his recent
writings.
As Cleaver wrote in the New York Times
the day of his return:
"A fabulous new era of progress is open
ing up to the world, and coping with all of
the problems unleashed by Watergate has
opened up a creative era for American
democracy. 1 believe that every American,
regardless of his politics, has a duty to
reexamine some of his beliefs.
We'll try to join him in that reexamina
tion.
