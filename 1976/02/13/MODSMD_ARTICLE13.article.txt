Biased choice
Editor:
After Tuesday night's ASSU
Senate meeting, students must
be wondering which is the big
ger joke — the Guest Professor
Board or the senate which ac
cepted its recommendations.
The decision to invite three
guest professors gave both the
board and the senate a prime op<-
portunity to strike a balance in
the political philosophy of those
invited. Taking advantage of the
STAND (their ideology: five
bodies, one mind) slate's control
of the senate, the board chose
rather to present a trio consisting
of a Marxist, a Troskyite and a
radical.
Rather than appealing to the
interests of the large segment of
the student community which is
picking up the tab for the spring
quarter visits, these selections
will benefit only that small seg
ment which arranged so deftly to
bring them here.
Students must also be won
dering why all theappointments
tend to carry political overtones.
Nominations have never been
made in such non-political
fields as music, art, drama or
even the sciences.
Such an openly biased and un
representative selection will
only discourage student interest
in what could be an extremely
beneficial program. If such dis
regard for student opinion con
tinues there will be but one al
ternative: a defeat of future fee
assessments for the Guest Pro
fessor program.

National eminence
Editor:
I would like to protest the im
plication. in the remarks about
tenure by President Richard
Lyman as quoted in the Feb. 4

Daily, that Asst. Sociology Prof.
Anne McMahon's research is in
ferior. I am not sure that was
what Lyman meant to say, but
whether it was or not, I would
like to register my judgment that
McMahon's research is out
standing.
Lyman was right that quantity
is not the real issue. The
academic profession is full of
people who write reams who
would not be tenured at Stan
ford.
Quantity is not sufficient —
the work must also be outstand
ing. But it does not follow from
the fact quality is necessary that
it is sufficient.
The only sufficient condition
for tenure at Stanford is national
visibility. An outstanding scho
lar known only to Stanford
would not meet Stanford's
criteria of quality.
On the other hand, if it were
possible to achieve natonal emi
nence without ever publishing
anything at all, eminence alone
would be sufficient. (Stanford is
not unique in this respect, that's
what "quality" means in most
American universities.)
Unfortunately, few individu
als become nationally promi
nent by winning a Gores award.
Frankly, in McMahon's case. I
think the problem is timing.
American universities are
forever letting go scholars who
later become nationally promi
nent.
In my judgment (I speak for
myself), McMahon will establish
herself as a national presence,
but she hasn't yet. That does not
make her work inferior.

Language restrictions
Editor:
At the verv time attention is

being drawn nationally to the
decline in verbal SAT scores and
foreign language study, some of
the proponents of the 1968
Study and Education at Stanford
(SES) doctrine have begun to
take a critical look at SES's
deeper inconsistencies.
Among the suggestions heard
recently on the subject is the fol
lowing by Assoc. History Prof.
Mark Mancall: "a two year lan
guage course in foreign lan
guages should be required with
special emphasis on the rapid
acquisition of a reading skill."
(Campus Report, Feb. 4.)
This proposal takes us clear
back to the early '50s when lan
guage professors hit upon the
"reading approach" in order to
keep foreign languages in the
Stanford curriculum, despite in
credible opposition by faculty in
other departments.
The resulting program was
doomed to destruction even fas
ter than SES, for it was based on
the false premise that language
can be compartmentalized into
reading and speaking "skills."
During that D-day of foreign
language study, it was not un
common to find students read
ing Gide and Camus after one or
two quarters of French with no
knowledge of how French really
sounded. More often than not,
they were unable to pronounce a
simple sentence in the language
they were learning to read.
This "reading method" as it
was called, soon gave way to the
equally unfortunate extreme of
the aural-oral approach, with its
attendant ills of showmanship
and superficiality.
Perhaps those best qualified to
assess current language prog
rams in the context of these
changes are the foreign language
departments themselves. They
can draw upon rich resources;

theme houses, language
laboratories', native-language in
structors, to say nothing of their
own contingent of bi-lingual
scholars.
The departments' worst set
backs to date have come from
decisions forced upon them by
administrators and reformists
who have no interest in language
and are more concerned with ef
ficiency and rapidity than ca
dence and nuance.
Surely, the foreign language
requirement needs to be re
stored, but without debilitating
restrictions. Left to their own re
sources, foreign language de
partments can handle the chal
lenge of devising timely and
coherent programs in the discip
line they represent.
