# Decision on assault

The University's Statement on
Faculty Discipline, as currently
written, allows the administra
tion to keep quiet what it
chooses and prosecute whom it
chooses, allowing little correla
tion between the corrective mea
sure chosen and the seriousness
of the offense.
The Statement should be
changed to require a discipli
nary hearing before the Advisory
Hoard lor all offenses of direct
violence against persons.
To dismiss former Fnglish
Prof. Bruce Franklin for al
ledgedly inciting others to viol
ence and to fine Psychiatry and
Psychology Prof. Karl Pribram
$3000 tor active violence against
another human being makes a
mockery of the entire discipli
nary procedure, lam appalled by
the decision of President Lyman
in my case.
The disciplinary procedure
also allows the President to grant
a faculty member as many delays
as the President deems desira
ble. In my case, Pribram was
granted over three months of de
lays "out of courtesy" without a
signature being required of him
under Paragraph 111 of the State
ment on Faculty Discipline.
Prompt signature
Finally, on Feb. 1, the Presi
dent's Office informed me it was
now requiring Pribram to agree
to the terms of the letter to him
under that Paragraph (presuma
bly by incorporating a clause
demanding such agreement) or
charges brought against
him. Pribram promptly signed
the letter.
Despite my repeated pleas to
University Legal Adviser James
Siena to incorporate such a
deadline clause into the letter to
Pribram, until just recently the
President's Office elected not to
do so. Adding this clause could
have been done, and should
have been done, as soon as Siena
determined theevidence in the
case supported my charges —
some two weeks after my assault.
During these same three
months, my superior was
granted continual delays out of
courtesy, yet similar courtesy
was denied to me. 1 was in
formed in writing I would be laid
oft it I did not accept the first job
offered to me at my current title
and salary level (though a writ
ten grievance had been filed by
me seriously questioning this
classification).
Gross violation
My hearing officer appointed
himself in effect attorney, judge
and jury (a written appeal to the
Director of Personnel that these
procedural rulings grossly viol
ate written grievance policy
have gone unanswered).
Just recently, 1 discovered a
dossier was kept on meand/rom
me by Pribram and adminis
trators. It listed alleged errors on
my part for the purpose of com
piling enough evidence — all
unsubstantiated — to enable the
Psychiatry Department to fire me
(this despite a superior perfor
mance evaluation at six months
and subsequently).
May I take this one opportun
ity to say I think it extremely im
portant employes of the Univer
sity be aware they may be as
saulted by their superiors and
see only token action taken by
the administration.
Employes may be secretly
blacklisted for requiring their
superiors to observe rules of
human decency, written Univer
sity policy and the law.
Employes may, for all their ef
forts, be laid off for refusing a
single job offer after returning to
work having been the victim of a
crime.
