# Three leftists invited
## Guest profs may come...finally 
### Bruce Kadden 
Students will finally get a chance spring
quarter to take a class from an ASSU guest
professor, or two or three.
Nearly two years after passing a fee assess
ment to fund the program, and after two un
successful attempts to bring political prisoners
from South Vietnam and Chile, students will
be able to determine whether their $1, paid in
fall, 1974, was worth it.
The Guest Professorship Board may have to
settle for two of their three recommended
choices. Radical psychiatrist Claude Steiner
has already accepted his invitation; according
to Board members Blythe Mickelson and Wil
liam Tyndall, Marxist philosopher Angela
Davis will also accept.
But Belgian economist Ernest Mandel may
not be able to make it, either of his own choice
or the U.S. government's. Mandel may not be
able to make the necessary arrangements to
leave Belgium.
Marxists need not apply
Even if he wants to come, he may not be able
to obtain a visa to the United States, as he has
had previous trouble.
Board members' efforts to obtain part-time
appointments and accreditation will probably
have mixed success.
The philosophy department has already ag
reed that Davis' course, "The Female Condi
tion: Search for a Marxist Approach," would
qualify for credit "using the same criteria" as
"for assessing other courses taught by persons
without an appointment" in the department.
But the Board suffered a setback when the
department cautiously passed on the responsi
bility for recommending Davis for a short-time
appointment to the Provost's office, a path the
Board wi 11 probably avoid for obvious reasons.
Instead, it appears that Davis and possibly
Steiner and Mandel. will be teaching through
the Undergraduate Specials office, as course
lecturers or preceptors.
Course abstracts
l'he Board has not given up trying for further
department appointments. The economics de
partment is considering Mandel's qualifica
tions and proposed course: "Economics and
Political History of the Labor Movements in
Europe" and"The Postwar Economy."
Board members said they will approach the
psychology and psychiatry departments about
Steiner's appointment. He will teach
"Psychiatry and Radical Psychiatry" which
will deal with the history and future of
psychiatry.
But while the Board has finally succeeded,
the future prospects of an ASSU guest profes
sorship program appear glum.

The length of time it has taken to utilize the
fee assessment will make voters aware that
their $1 may not be used until they've
graduated.
The delay of almost two years was due to the
invitations being extended to political prison
ers who were never able to leave their coun
tries.
In its most recent attempt, the Board not only
opened up the process by allowing students to
recommend persons, but was in contact with
those who indicated they would come, so that
the Board was confident of success in at least
two cases when the recommendations to the
student senate was made.
The Board sent out letters of inquiry to all 36
persons who were recommended by faculty
and students, including Richard Nixon, who
never responded.
Of the 26 persons who did respond, nine
indicated that they would be interested in serv
ing as guest professor, from which Board
members selected Davis, Mandel and Steiner.
Opposition in the senate, though minimal,
points to another reason that students may
have second thoughts about approving another
guest professor assessment, if one is on the
ballot this spring.
Leftist bias attacked
ASSU Sen. Bob Ottilie noted two principal
grounds lor objection: that all three were polit
ical and social figures, rather than artists or
musicians, and that they are all from the left
end of the political spectrum, rather than being
balanced.
But 1 yndall said the leftist professors
would provide a good counter-balance to what
he called the "liberal-conservative" orienta
tion of Stanford professors.
Andrea Halliday, the fourth Board member,
rejected criticism which implied that someone
who performs a radical mastectomy was "a

communist" as she said Ottilie had implied
during the senate's debate.
The factor, though, which will probably de
termine the fate of the guest professorship
program is the effectiveness of Davis, Steiner
and Mandel as teachers, and whether enough
students have a chance to take advantage of
their being on campus.
Few would argue that in theory the program
is a bad idea, but most students are interested
in its effectiveness as a student service.
Unless the presence of the guest professors
next quarter changes some minds, they may be
the first and last ASSU guest professors for
some time to come.


HOUSE OF SECRETS—Few students ever venture over to the Stanford
Museum, located in an obscure corner of campus. Visitors, however,
have no trouble finding it. Neither do thieves. The Museum periodi
cally has had small objects stolen from it.Most recently,s2B, 000 worth

of rare coins were taken. Despite apparent breaks in the case, Museum
authorities and police apparent breaks in the case. Museum au
thorities and police officials are reluctant to talk about the case.
