# Officials keep mum about stolen coin mystery
## 
### Bob Zuckerman 
When 40 rare coins stolen from the Stanford
Museum ot Art in May vvere recovered last
week, museum officials and the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's office vvere secretive about de
tails.
Police only responded to most questions:
"It's still under investigation." Museum Direc
tor I.orenz Eitner said he only knew "what I
read in the newspapers."
These replies are not unusual. Since the

thieves have not been apprehended, police
probably don't want to release all their infor
mation. Such a release would tell the culprit
what the police know.
As for the museum officials, the police prob
ably have told them nothing about the case.
But what Eitner said on Sunday is unusual.
"There's something extremely interesting
about the (police) investigation," he said, "but
I won't tell you about it."
What's so "extremely interesting?"
Sheriff's Detective Capt. Wes Johnson re
fused to comment Monday on Eitner's remark,
but Marvin Herrington, director of public
safety here, said Wednesday the University
police have worked "with the sheriff's depart
ment since the case began, and I don't know
what Eitner's getting at.
Its a little unusual that the police have no
suspects and that not all the stolen property
has been returned. Maybe that's what he's re
ferring to."
Mystery man appears
Police said earlier that an attorney returned
the coins —valued at $28,000 —to the sheriff's
office about noon last Friday. Police would
neither identify the attorney nor say how he
came into possession of the coins.
Herrington said he wasn't sure what hap
pened to the rest of the coins and other stolen
property, including a silver platter and some
Navajo turquoise jewelry. Hut he said that "it's
been a long time; they might have been sold."
Whether Eitner knows something else about
the investigation can only be answered by
Eitner, but his statement that be knows more
than he's telling seems to conflict with his
statement that he only knows what he reads.
Another 'Deep Throat'?
Another interesting comment by Eitner last
week has caused some indignation at the
sheriff's office. He complained that police
"leaked" news of the coin recovery to the

press.
Johnson said, "It's not a matter of leaking.
This office has an open policy with the press. If
Eitner doesn't like it.he should come and see
me."
Eitner also said earlier, "I'm not interested in
releasing a story which will only help the crim
inals." But Herrington said he didn't think
press stories earlier aided the criminals in any
way.
Eitner also suggested earlier that releasing a
story on the stolen coins might give other
thieves ideas for stealing from the museum.
Blaming the messenger
Herrington said Eitner has a point, but ad
ded, ' 'controversy over whether crime report
ing creates more crime has another side."
Crime reporting also makes the public more
aware ol crime, and"the single biggest deter
rent is the individual," Herrington said.
Eitner also made another comment which
caused a flurry of indignation inside the Daily
office. He said, "The Daily and other members

of the irresponsible press have no interest in
what goes on at the museum, except when it's
something like this."
More specifically, Eitner complained that
the Daily, unlike other papers in the area, sel
dom covers new exhibits and events at the
museum.
Daily Editor Mark Simonian said, "the
Daily doesn't have the staff or the space, par
ticularly in entertainment, to feature every
museum exhibit."
Simonian noted that earlier this academic
year, the paper printed a half page of photo
graphs of the Auguste Rodin sculptures be
longing toi he museum. He also cited an article
printed last July on a room in the museum full
of momentos belonging to the Stanford family.
"Our readers want news," Simonian con
tinued. I hey write in and tell us that con
stantly. If the news is bad news, for the
museum or any one else, I feel sorry, but we
have a responsibility to cover it."


PROFESSOR DAVIS?- That's right. If Angela Davis accepts the ASSU Gu«i ProfesorshTp
Board s invitation to teach here next quarter, the Marxist philosopher will become one of the
I niversity s most radical (acuity members.

what Eitner's getting at.
Its a little unusual that the police have no
suspects and that not all the stolen property
has been returned. Maybe that's what he's re
ferring to."
Mystery man appears
Police said earlier that an attorney returned
the coins —valued at $28,000 —to the sheriff's
office about noon last Friday. Police would
neither identify the attorney nor say how he
came into possession of the coins.
Herrington said he wasn't sure what hap
pened to the rest of the coins and other stolen
property, including a silver platter and some
Navajo turquoise jewelry. Hut he said that "it's
been a long time; they might have been sold."
Whether Eitner knows something else about
the investigation can only be answered by
Eitner, but his statement that be knows more
than he's telling seems to conflict with his
statement that he only knows what he reads.
Another 'Deep Throat'?
Another interesting comment by Eitner last
week has caused some indignation at the
sheriff's office. He complained that police
"leaked" news of the coin recovery to the

press.
Johnson said, "It's not a matter of leaking.
This office has an open policy with the press. If
Eitner doesn't like it.he should come and see
me."
Eitner also said earlier, "I'm not interested in
releasing a story which will only help the crim
inals." But Herrington said he didn't think
press stories earlier aided the criminals in any
way.
Eitner also suggested earlier that releasing a
story on the stolen coins might give other
thieves ideas for stealing from the museum.
Blaming the messenger
Herrington said Eitner has a point, but ad
ded, ' 'controversy over whether crime report
ing creates more crime has another side."
Crime reporting also makes the public more
aware ol crime, and"the single biggest deter
rent is the individual," Herrington said.
Eitner also made another comment which
caused a flurry of indignation inside the Daily
office. He said, "The Daily and other members

of the irresponsible press have no interest in
what goes on at the museum, except when it's
something like this."
More specifically, Eitner complained that
the Daily, unlike other papers in the area, sel
dom covers new exhibits and events at the
museum.
Daily Editor Mark Simonian said, "the
Daily doesn't have the staff or the space, par
ticularly in entertainment, to feature every
museum exhibit."
Simonian noted that earlier this academic
year, the paper printed a half page of photo
graphs of the Auguste Rodin sculptures be
longing toi he museum. He also cited an article
printed last July on a room in the museum full
of momentos belonging to the Stanford family.
"Our readers want news," Simonian con
tinued. I hey write in and tell us that con
stantly. If the news is bad news, for the
museum or any one else, I feel sorry, but we
have a responsibility to cover it."

When 40 rare coins stolen from the Stanford
Museum ot Art in May vvere recovered last
week, museum officials and the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's office vvere secretive about de
tails.
Police only responded to most questions:
"It's still under investigation." Museum Direc
tor I.orenz Eitner said he only knew "what I
read in the newspapers."
These replies are not unusual. Since the

thieves have not been apprehended, police
probably don't want to release all their infor
mation. Such a release would tell the culprit
what the police know.
As for the museum officials, the police prob
ably have told them nothing about the case.
But what Eitner said on Sunday is unusual.
"There's something extremely interesting
about the (police) investigation," he said, "but
I won't tell you about it."
What's so "extremely interesting?"
Sheriff's Detective Capt. Wes Johnson re
fused to comment Monday on Eitner's remark,
but Marvin Herrington, director of public
safety here, said Wednesday the University
police have worked "with the sheriff's depart
ment since the case began, and I don't know
what Eitner's getting at.

suspects and that not all the stolen property
has been returned. Maybe that's what he's re
