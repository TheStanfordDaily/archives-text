## L'Ommies: omelet theme & variations 
### 
Reviews by Nancy Wilson
Continental cuisine is the fare
offered at L'Ommies on El
Camino, the restaurant formerly
known to local patrons as
L'Omelette. L'Ommies has ex
panded to include a wide variety
of dishes. Still, it offers nightly
variations on the omelet.
A unique feature at L'Ommies
is the cheese fondue. Besides the
pre-meal bread and butter every
restaurant serves, you get a
cheese fondue over a low flame
and a dish of bread cubes to be
skewered with the long-handled
fondue fork. Once you've eaten
this (complemented with chab
lis), you could order a two per
son serving of Caesar's or
spinach salad for $2.50 and be
pleasantly filled.
Instead of sticking to the smal
ler meals, we ordered from the
fine selection of entrees. From a
choice of stuffed mushrooms,
fish dishes, Cordon Bleu,
Shrimp Scampi, steaks and
omelets, we chose the Seafood
Brochette and the cheese and
mushroom omelet. The
brochette had shrimp, halibut
and scallops, baked, not deep
fried â€” served with teriyaki
sauce and rice. The bits were
light and tender. Not too much
so as to be filling.
The omelet came piping hot,
with lots of mushrooms and an
appropriate serving size. If
you're a cheese fan, you might be
a bit disappointed. Like all en
trees, ours came with a choice of
soup or salad and a serving of
vegetables.
The french onion soup was
good and oniony. The salad is
recommended for those who like
dressing. The vegetables, zuc
chini and carrots were served
the way vegetables should be
served hot, still crunchy and
with flavor intact, not washed
away by the cooking water.
After dinner we still had room

for some coffee and dessert. The
graham cracker and German
chocolate cakes were our
choices. Good, but not quite like
Mom makes it.
In addition to their main din
ing area, L'Ommies features
snacks from the Oyster Bar in the
cocktail lounge. There you can
also catch the nightly music and
dancing. Daytime service in
cludes full luncheons, ranging
from $2 to $4 for meaty
sandwiches or light seafood
plates.
The entrees at dinner run bet
ween $4.50 and $7.50. A dinner
for two, including coffee and de
ssert will run about $15. A
reasonable price for the food,
service and atmosphere.
Particularly striking are the
big, open hearth fireplaces in the
bar and dining rooms. If you're
making reservations, ask for a
seat near one of them, or with a
view of the garden and wooden
fence which block the traffic
from sight.
