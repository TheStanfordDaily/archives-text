# Study shows alcohol prompts more hostility than marijuana
## 
### Marc Strassman 
Marijuana is significantly less likely to lead to aggres
sive behavior than alcohol, according to a study recently
completed by Jared Tinklenberg and associates in the De
partment of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the
Veterans Administration Hospital in Palo Alto.
These findings emerged from a study of 248 male adoles
cents imprisoned during June 1973 to July 1975 at North
ern California Youth Authority facilities.
Tinklenberg said the data for the study came from
sources — interviews with the subjects and information
from police and court records. Only where the subjects
reports matched those of the authorities' files was the
data used.
The study's findings indicate that the subjects per
ceived that alcohol increased the probability of fighting
while marijuana did not affect or decreased the likelihood
of fighting.
Fifty-nine percent of the respondents reported one or
more fights while under the influence of alcohol and
twenty-five percent reported one or more fights under the
influence of marijuana.
Effects on aggression
When asked to identify the drug most likely to make
them get into a fight, 39 percent of the 229 respondents
identified secobarbital, a barbituate, as the single drug
most likely to increase aggression. Fewer than 5 percent
named marijuana as aggression-inciting. In fact, 49 per
cent of the respondents named marijuana as the single
drug most likely to decrease aggressiveness.
When asked if they ever used a drug to bolster them
selves for aggressive actions that they would not other
wise perform, 42 percent said they used alcohoi, 20 per
cent said secobarbital and 16 percent said marijuana.
Asked if they ever used a drug to calm themselves down
to avoid getting into trouble, 24 subjects reported using
marijuana for such tranquilizing purposes, and four said

they used alcohol.
Describing their drug involvement, if any, in actual
fights which took place over a one-year period, 29 percent
reported the involvement of alcohol. Only 2 percent re
ported the involvement of marijuana alone. Alcohol
related fights were reported more frequently than fights
involving no drugs, (fights involving marijuana were re
ported less frequently than the no-drug cases).
Tinklenberg said, "Cannabis (marijuana) was not re
ported to have the socially disruptive effects of alcohol
despite the fact that these two drugs were used at approx
imately the same frequency. Cannabis was generally de
scribed as reducing aggressiveness whereas alcohol either
had little effect or increased aggressive tendencies.
"Similarly, cannabis was used much more frequently
than alcohol for tranquilizing purposes so that the indi
vidual would avoid difficulties. Conversely, alcohol was
used by these youthful offenders deliberately to bolster
courage to do something they would not do in a non-drug
state."
He concludes, "Thus, on a variety of measures designed
to identify drug effects on aggressive behavior, the find
ingsof this study are consistent, cannabisusually reduced
aggressivness. and alcohol often enhanced aggressive
ness.
Laboratory studies
Laboratory studies cited by Tinklenberg also support
his findings. He said other studies indicate moderate
doses of marijuana reportedly produce a disinclination
toward extreme physical effort, an increase in positive
mood states, such as mental euphoria and a reduction of
hostility.
Tinklenberg said he felt his findings were important
because they contradict the long-standing argument that
marijuana use should be prohibited because it causes
people to commit acts of violence.

doses of marijuana reportedly produce a disinclination
toward extreme physical effort, an increase in positive
mood states, such as mental euphoria and a reduction of
hostility.
Tinklenberg said he felt his findings were important
because they contradict the long-standing argument that
marijuana use should be prohibited because it causes
people to commit acts of violence.
Marijuana is significantly less likely to lead to aggres
sive behavior than alcohol, according to a study recently
completed by Jared Tinklenberg and associates in the De
partment of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the
Veterans Administration Hospital in Palo Alto.
These findings emerged from a study of 248 male adoles
cents imprisoned during June 1973 to July 1975 at North
ern California Youth Authority facilities.
Tinklenberg said the data for the study came from
sources — interviews with the subjects and information
from police and court records. Only where the subjects
reports matched those of the authorities' files was the
data used.
The study's findings indicate that the subjects per
ceived that alcohol increased the probability of fighting
while marijuana did not affect or decreased the likelihood
of fighting.
Fifty-nine percent of the respondents reported one or
more fights while under the influence of alcohol and
twenty-five percent reported one or more fights under the
influence of marijuana.
Effects on aggression
When asked to identify the drug most likely to make
them get into a fight, 39 percent of the 229 respondents
identified secobarbital, a barbituate, as the single drug
most likely to increase aggression. Fewer than 5 percent
named marijuana as aggression-inciting. In fact, 49 per
cent of the respondents named marijuana as the single
drug most likely to decrease aggressiveness.
When asked if they ever used a drug to bolster them
selves for aggressive actions that they would not other
wise perform, 42 percent said they used alcohoi, 20 per
cent said secobarbital and 16 percent said marijuana.
Asked if they ever used a drug to calm themselves down
to avoid getting into trouble, 24 subjects reported using
marijuana for such tranquilizing purposes, and four said

they used alcohol.
Describing their drug involvement, if any, in actual
fights which took place over a one-year period, 29 percent
reported the involvement of alcohol. Only 2 percent re
ported the involvement of marijuana alone. Alcohol
related fights were reported more frequently than fights
involving no drugs, (fights involving marijuana were re
ported less frequently than the no-drug cases).
Tinklenberg said, "Cannabis (marijuana) was not re
ported to have the socially disruptive effects of alcohol
despite the fact that these two drugs were used at approx
imately the same frequency. Cannabis was generally de
scribed as reducing aggressiveness whereas alcohol either
had little effect or increased aggressive tendencies.
"Similarly, cannabis was used much more frequently
than alcohol for tranquilizing purposes so that the indi
vidual would avoid difficulties. Conversely, alcohol was
used by these youthful offenders deliberately to bolster
courage to do something they would not do in a non-drug
state."
He concludes, "Thus, on a variety of measures designed
to identify drug effects on aggressive behavior, the find
ingsof this study are consistent, cannabisusually reduced
aggressivness. and alcohol often enhanced aggressive
ness.
Laboratory studies
Laboratory studies cited by Tinklenberg also support
his findings. He said other studies indicate moderate
doses of marijuana reportedly produce a disinclination
toward extreme physical effort, an increase in positive
mood states, such as mental euphoria and a reduction of
hostility.
