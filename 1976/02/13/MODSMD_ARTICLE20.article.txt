# At U.E. Restaurant, your wish comes true
## 
### 
Up El Camino a ways in Menlo Park is a small
restaurant featuring select Mandarin and Can
tonese dishes. Meals are prepared for lunch and
dinner, to eat in or to go. This is the U.E. Chinese
Restaurant. U.E. stands for theChinesecharacters
meaning "your wishes will come true."
For lunch U.E. features an "all-you-can-eat"
buffet for $2.25. This includes six hot entrees and
vegetables with a different menu daily.
The dinner included a sampling of several main
courses and appetizers. First I was served the Wor
Won Ton soup, which had tasty won tons, a vari
ety of crisp vegetables and added meat chunks.
This goes for $2.50 for a two person serving. It
could serve three or four as a side dish, or two
people as a major part of the meal.
Then came the appetizers â€” fried prawns (eight
for $2.50) and pot stickers (eight for $2.25), ac
companied by sweet and sour sauce, vinegar
sauce and a spicy hot sauce. The prawns with the
sweet and sour sauce were delicious. The pot
stickers are a variation of the won ton (meat and
vegetable wrapped in and go well with
the vinegar or hot sauce.
The main entrees sampled were Mo Shu Pork,
with plum sauce and a paper thin rice crepe,

Ginger Beet with green onion and oyster sauce,
Hot and Sour Chicken and Prawns with black
bean sauce.
The best dishes are the Mo Shu Pork and the Hot
and Sour Chicken. They seemed to have the most
flavor. The prawns and the beef were more mild,
except for the crunchy bits of ginger served with
the beef.
The meat dishes tend to emphasize the sauce
and the intermixed vegetables. These dishes
range from $2.50 to $3.50 per generous serving,
and are divided into categories of fowl, meats,
vegetables and seafood.
Traditional steamed rice accompanies entrees.
U.K. also prepares rice with meats, fried rice and a
variety of chow meins. For the indecisive, the
menu offers a U.K. Dinner for $3.75 per person,
with soup, three entrees and a chow rnein already
selected for you.
Perhaps best of all was the dessert. We had
steaming hot fried sweet bananas and oolong tea.
Two banana chunks per person aresl.7s, served
fried and rolled in sugar. Even if you don't like
bananas, you'll probably like these. And to finish
the meal, of course, a fortune cookie: "The heart is
wiser than the intellect."
