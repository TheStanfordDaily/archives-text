# Sicilian cuisine
## Cricchio's: Italian with a twist 
### 
When you think of Italian cuisine, you
picture spaghetti, antipasto, parmegiana,
ravioli and rich tomato sauce. But what
flashes in your mind for Sicilian cuisine?
Cricchio's Ristorante Siciliano specializes
in Sicilian repast and it is indeed different
from the standard Italian meal.
One of Joe Cricchio's house specialties is
Cabalone, also called the poor man's
abalone. It's typical of the Sicilian style,
featuring seafood with a well-balanced
sauce that adds flavor without becoming too
rich.
Cabalone is squid meat, flattened into a
filet shape, then cooked in butter and top
ped with a sauce. (I had the Bernaise sauce.)
The flavor and texture aren't quite like
abalone, but this entree would prove a good

adventure for the sea food gourmet.
An excellent choice for the inexperienced
palate is the Seafood Canneloni. Pieces of
shrimp, sole, halibut and more are wrapped
in a thin crepe, topped with cheese and a
light tomato sauce. My friend reports it is
filling, but light to the taste.
The entrees are accompanied by zucchini
and some noodles with grated cheese. Also
included in the price, which ranges from $5
to $7, is a choice of soups and a green salad.
The New England clam chowder is delici
ous — full of flavor without tasting like a
mixture of spices. The salads are a real treat.
Their only drawback is that they almost
leave too little room for the main course. Of
the choice of dressings, we tried the house
and roquefort. Both are most pleasing. Best

of all, each serving of salad is inciividally
tossed at your tableside, to assure a
thoroughly spread dressing.
The menu also includes appetizers and
pasta a la carte, as well as a number of de
sserts.
Cricchio's serves a full range of drinks
from the bar. They also sport wines by the
bottle or by the glass. The house wine goes
for 75 cents a glass. And for an added touch,
the water glass is served with a lemon slice.
Cricchio's is located on El Camino and
San Antonio in Los Altos in a town & coun
try style shopping area, and it does an excel
lent job of keeping the atmosphere buffered
from the bright lights and traffic outside.
Our waiter was friendly and the service was
pleasant.

pasta a la carte, as well as a number of de
sserts.
Cricchio's serves a full range of drinks
from the bar. They also sport wines by the
bottle or by the glass. The house wine goes
for 75 cents a glass. And for an added touch,
the water glass is served with a lemon slice.
Cricchio's is located on El Camino and
San Antonio in Los Altos in a town & coun
try style shopping area, and it does an excel
lent job of keeping the atmosphere buffered
from the bright lights and traffic outside.
Our waiter was friendly and the service was
pleasant.
