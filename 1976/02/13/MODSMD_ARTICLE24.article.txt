## Parents, youths clash 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
battle of the cults has come to
Washington.
On one side are some parents
who claim their children have
been brain washed by some of t he
newly organized religious cults.
On the other side are some
young people who claim their
First Amendment right to wor
ship whom they please.
In separate hotels, the two
groups held news conferences to
hurl charges and defend them
selves, each claiming to be mis
understood.
A group of seven parents, ar
riving in town late Tuesday af

ternoon, informally discussed
their problem with reporters in a
hotel room. Theyappeared tired,
worried and distraught.
The young people took out a
full page ad in a local news
paper, rented a fancy reception
room, made formal statements
behind microphones and served
Danish pastry and coffee. About
two dozen of them were there.
The parents have formed a
group called the Individual
Freedom Foundation, which is
based in Ardmore, Pa., and are
appealing to President Ford,
Congress and the Justice De
partment to have the cults inves

tigated.
Twenty-five members of the
group marched in front of the
White House Wednesday and
talked with individual con
gressmen.
Hundreds of these controver
sial, new religious cults have
sprung up across the country,
but the best known and largest
are the Unification Church of the
Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the
Children of God Sect, the Divine
Light Mission of the Guru
Maharaj Ji, which says it's not a
religion but a way of life, and the
Hare Krishna movement.
