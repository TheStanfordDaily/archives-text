# Stanford challenges USC to blood drive
## 
### Joey F. George 
The Council of Presidents and
the Stanford chapter of Alpha
Phi Omega have challenged
their counterparts at USC to a
blood drive competition with
USC, according to Beth Hessel
meyer, 1976 blood drive chair
man.
USC has yet to accept the chal
lenge, but Hesselmeyer said she
felt their participation was al
most assured.
The proposed competition
callsforanannual "Big Drive"to
be held during winter and spring

quarters to correspond to USC's
second semester, Hesselmeyer
said.
The winning university
would be determined by the per
centage of registered students
donating blood at the area Red
Cross Blood Center or at on
campus Red Cross blood
mobiles. The winner would re
ceive a trophy donated by the
Stanford and USC chapters of
Alpha Phi Omega.
Hesselmeyer commented that
a competitive drive could help
insure that enough blood is do
nated to fill the need for Stanford
Hospital and Children's hospi
tal, where all the blood donated
here goes.
Stanford Hospital alone uses
2000 pints of blood per month,
with 25 percent of the blood
used just for heart operations.
The rest goes for leukemics,
hemophiliacs, accident victims
and premature babies. One pa
tient can use as much as sixunits
of blood in a day.
"We're trying to get people to
think of blood as a community
resource," she said, noting that
donating blood could be consi
dered a "recycling process."
Work already done toward the
blood drive at Stanford this quar
ter will count toward the Big
Drive when and if it becomes a
reality, Hesselmeyer said.

She noted that there has been a
bloodmobile at Stanford every
week since January.
In addition, bloodmobiles will
be at Kairos House on Feb. 18.
Tresidder on Feb. 23 and at Stern
Hall on March 1.
Hesselmeyer urged students
to identify themselves as such
when they donate blood so the
blood donated will count for the
Stanford side of the Big Drive.
