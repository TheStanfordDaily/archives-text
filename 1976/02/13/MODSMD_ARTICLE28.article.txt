Is it (rue that Dr. Norman Shumway has offered a reward for the
first couple to make love in one of the hanging planters at the
Medical Center? If so, how much'!' And what does he require for
proof?-D. E.
Unfortunately, Shumway will never have a chance to get to the
heart of that question, since it has been censored by his secretary (or
whatever patient bureaucrat answers his phone).
"That's obviously a joke question," snarled the aforementioned
bureaucrat. "There'd be no reason for him to offer something like
that."
As a warning to future pranksters, she added that it was "cer
tainly not an appropriate question to ask Dr. Shumway."

I have a question that might make you work. What does the word or
letters "ZODO" mean? I have seen them often carved on desks in
the old law school.-A.S.
"Zodo" is the nickname of Tim Labrucherie, a 1973 graduate of
the Stanford Law School. Labrucherie, whose antics earned him a
devoted if small fan club, was famous for making joke phone calls.
One reported example was Labrucherie's famed "pink cement"
call, in which he informed unsuspecting answerers that their load
of pink cement was on its way. When they responded that they had
never ordered such a thing, he would say that he would have to
dump the cement on their front lawns.
This kind of joke, which appeals to the law student mentality,
would obviously not be appropriate for University bureaucrats.

Would you please investigate the source of the noxious fumes that
pour out from the planter in front of the SWOPSIISCIHE office? Thtq
vegetation has died, a tree has been cut down (did it die from
inhalation?), and ive feel poisoned as we pass by. I called Plant
Services and they said they'd look into it but the stench and smoke
continue.-A.S.
In a sterling example of consumer activisim, our staff has solved
your problem. Last week we called A 1 Genevro at Plant Services
who promised to investigate. And this week the fumes are gone.
Apparently, the smell was caused by a broken steam line whicll
emitted a steam of vapors. The steam was concentrating the odor of
the manure in the planter.
