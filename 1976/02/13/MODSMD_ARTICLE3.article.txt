2 Three Toyon residents have discovered an apparent
3 hiding place for stolen bicycles inside bushes beneath
3 their dormitory windows.
I] Sophomore John Levy found a second cache of bicy
-3 cle parts in another group of bushes about 40 feet from
3 <- the first.

3 Sophomore Karen Duncan, junior Raul Pino and
□ Levy earlier this week discovered three ten-speed bicy
° cles in various stages of disassembly hidden only seven
n feet from the main paved footpath at the northwest end
g of Toyon Hall. They reported the discovery to police
o yesterday.
§ "A friend of mine told me they were there," Duncan
Q said. "You could almost see them through the cracks in
□ the bushes."
§ Levy said he and Pino searched the area Wednesday.
□ at Duncan's suggestion. "Having had three bikes stolen
g in a year and a half, I know how it feels," Levy said.
5 Stripped bikes
□ Tires, handlebars, seats and gear assemblies had
□ been stripped from the uncovered bicycles — a gre^n

Gitane and silver Motobecane and a red Centurion.
The Centurion, with its rear tire still attached, was
found locked with a damaged but unbroken cable.
Stanford police officer Kristin Henderson, who con
fiscated the bicycles, said she suspected they had been
in the grove only a short time.
The bicycles could be seen from the path, but only
under close scrutiny. They were found close together
just behind a thick group of bushes.
Bike parts
The other cache, strewn over a wider area, consisted
of bicycle baskets, cable locks, hand grips and hand
lebars. Levy discovered the parts yesterday after seeing
the first set of bicycles.
"It's very easy to bring a bike in here (the Toyon
bushes) and strip it without anyone noticing," Hender
son said.
She said the police have a difficult time tracking
down bicycle thieves. "About the only time we catch
them is when they're loading three or four of them into
a truck," she said.
"We've got a collection of bolt cutters, but no bike
thieves to eo with them." said Henderson.
