# Mountain View hydrants exhibit 'spirit of 1776'
## 
### Lyn Carlson 
The city of Mountain View, in
an effort to capture that elusive
"true spirit of 1776," is holdings
Bicentennial fire hydrant paint
ing campaign.
Rather than cashing in on the
Spirit of the Buy-Centennial
with profit-making price tags on
the paint kits they are selling the
kits at cost. Rather than includ
ing paint-by-number directions
and pre-cut stencils in the kits,
they are leaving the designs up
to the imagination of the painter.

Rather than plastering gaudy,
glossy posters all over bus-stop
benches, the main mode of ad
vertising has been word-of
mouth. Rather than restricting
the campaign to the older, more
artistic members of the commun
ity, even the youngest members
are allowed to participate.
In other words, they're not try
ing to capture that elusive "true
spirit of 1776" with the commer
cialized trappings of 1976.
Down on commercialism
Crant Huberty, chairman of
the Mountain View Bicentennial
Committee, relates that "Right
now, I'm really getting down on

the commercialism of the bicen
tennial." For that reason, it was
decided not to make a contest
out of the campaign, which
would have resulted in a rise in
the cost of the paint kits in order
to pay for the prizes.
For that reason also the cost of
the paint kits has been held
down to cost; one costs $6, three
cost $17.76, and four cost (are
you ready) — $19.76.
The cost would have been
much higher had the committee
decided to purchase elaborate,
ready-made kits through a com
pany back East which has
sprung up to capitalize on the
nation-wide rage for star
spangled hydrants.
Permits are necessary to avoid
the legal charge of "defacing
public property" — or, if one is
painting a patriot's profile, the
charge might be "facing public
property."
Special paint
The paint kit includes up to
five colors of paint, two brushes,
a drop cloth and your very own
"wet paint" sign. The paint type
had to be specially approved by
the city water department to en
sure that it will hold up for two
years until the next scheduled
re-painting.
Helen Newbank, superviser of
the Recreation Center, explains
that "it's simply a patriotic ges
ture to bring the Bicentennial to
the public." It seems that this
way the Bicentennial can be
brought as close to the people as
the grey fire plug on the curb in
front of their house.
The idea is catching on not by
slick advertising techniques but
by seeing the hydrant in front of
your house undergo meta
morphosis, and asking someone
what's going on.
As a result of this word-of
mouth or word-of-hydrant ad
vertising, approximately S(J
hydrants have been painted to
date. There are a total of 700 fire
hydrants in Mountain View, all
plotted on a map in the Recrea
tion Center, and it is optimisti

cally said that "we'd like them
all painted by July 4."
lust for fun
Nancy Noe of the Recreation
Center reflects that the campaign
is "just for fun; for the satisfac
tion of seeing your hydrant out
there instead of just an ugly gray
Plug"
Huberty adds that
"you're doing something with
the ugly in America — you're
making it represent something
good. That can be applied to a lot
of things in our country today."
Judging from the number and
the variety of participants in this
project, either a lot of people
agree with this lofty philosophy
or else they just enjoy spending
an afternoon dabbling on a fire

hydrant. Participants nave in
cluded scout troops, church
groups, young married couples
and housewives.
An elementary school held a
contest for the best idea submit
ted for the hydrant in front of the
school. One woman, aged at
least 75, wanted to paint the one
in front of her home, but asked
for help from a member of the
Bicentennial committee because
she didn't know if she could
handle it.
Restriction
The only restriction these par
ticipants must heed is that the
hydrants must be painted in a
Bicentennial theme and in good
taste.
A list of suggestions is in

cluded with the paint kits, some
being as obscure as Barbara
Fritchy and John Winthrop;
others being as ambitious as
Washington Crossing the Dela
ware and The Boston Tea Party
(all on one fire hydrant?)
However, most painters have
stayed with the tried-and-true
red-white-and-blue ideas, with
numerous repetitions of the
most popular figures, such as
Ceorge Washington, Paul Re
vere, Martha Washington, Betsy
Ross and the Stars-and-Stripes.
Mountain View could have
had an impressive number of
neat, uniform, artistic fire hyd
rants ennobling their sidewalks

had it commercialized its'cam
paign. As it is. they have a re
spectable number of wobbly,
out-of-proportion. not-quite-as
artistic fire hydrants that aren't
quite as ennobling splotching
their sidewalks.
Hut perhaps in their individu
ality. creativity and spontaneity
— yes, even in the wobbly fea
tures on George Washington —
these fire hydrants capture that
elusive spirit of the Bicentennial
better than anything else.
