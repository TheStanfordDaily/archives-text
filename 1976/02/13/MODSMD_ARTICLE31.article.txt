## Swimmers travel to L.A. 
### Chris Kamel 
Even though this holiday
weekend lasts for three days,
Stanford's men's and women's
varsity swimming teams won't
start their weekend until tomor
row afternoon.
The Card swi m squads take on
the tough one-two punch of USC
and UCLA in Los Angeles. The
women meet the Trojans at 3
p.m. today, while the Card men's
contingent takes on USC at 7:30
p.m. Both the Stanford men and
women swimmers will meet the
Bruins at noon tomorrow in
West wood.
But the Cards mav not have

much to celebrate this holiday
weekend. "USC has too much
depth for us," coach Jim Gaug
hran admitted. The Trojans beat
the Cards, 74-39, last year on the
Farm.
Distance events
USC's strength lies in the dis
tance events. Stanford sopho
more Bill Chao will meet a for
midable Trojan 1000-yard free
style contingent of three men
with times under 9:27.
"Bill will really have his work
cut out for him," said Gaughran,
"since his best time is around
9:40."
Stanford's remaining events

ought to be less one-sided. The
most exciting matchups should
come in 50 and 100-yard frees
tyle events, where Card Dave
Fairbank and USC's Joe Bottom
will be pitted against each other.
Bottom heat Fairbank for the
NCAA crown in the 50-free last
year, after Fairbank had won the
event in both conference and
dual meets.
Even Stanford All-American
John Hencken will meet the
challenge of a very strong
breaststroke group.
One point
Gaughran thinks the noon
matchup with the Bruins may
come down to one point. That
margin may come in the frees
tyle relay, where both the Cards
and Bruins have identical season
bests of 3:05.
UCLA will challenge Stanford
in the medley relay as well as the
200-yard freestyle. The Bruins
are four seconds better than the
Cards in the medley relay. Stan
ford's 200-yard free hopes rest
on senior Craig VanZandt, who
will have to shave his time down
to 1:4 lin order to be a factor in
the meet.
Stanford's women's squad
beat both the Trojans and Bruins
in the Stanford Invitational Meet
two months ago, but Gaughran
said that both Los Angeles teams
have improved.

most exciting matchups should
come in 50 and 100-yard frees
tyle events, where Card Dave
Fairbank and USC's Joe Bottom
will be pitted against each other.
Bottom heat Fairbank for the
NCAA crown in the 50-free last
year, after Fairbank had won the
event in both conference and
dual meets.
Even Stanford All-American
John Hencken will meet the
challenge of a very strong
breaststroke group.
One point
Gaughran thinks the noon
matchup with the Bruins may
come down to one point. That
margin may come in the frees
tyle relay, where both the Cards
and Bruins have identical season
bests of 3:05.
UCLA will challenge Stanford
in the medley relay as well as the
200-yard freestyle. The Bruins
are four seconds better than the
Cards in the medley relay. Stan
ford's 200-yard free hopes rest
on senior Craig VanZandt, who
will have to shave his time down
to 1:4 lin order to be a factor in
the meet.
Stanford's women's squad
beat both the Trojans and Bruins
in the Stanford Invitational Meet
two months ago, but Gaughran
said that both Los Angeles teams
have improved.

MORE PLAYING TIME — Stanford forward Jeff McHugh, putting up a shot over Oregon's Greg
Ballard in last week's 72-59 Duck win, may see a lot of action this weekend in place of injured
George Schader.
Even though this holiday
weekend lasts for three days,
Stanford's men's and women's
varsity swimming teams won't
start their weekend until tomor
row afternoon.
The Card swi m squads take on
the tough one-two punch of USC
and UCLA in Los Angeles. The
women meet the Trojans at 3
p.m. today, while the Card men's
contingent takes on USC at 7:30
p.m. Both the Stanford men and
women swimmers will meet the
Bruins at noon tomorrow in
West wood.
But the Cards mav not have

much to celebrate this holiday
weekend. "USC has too much
depth for us," coach Jim Gaug
hran admitted. The Trojans beat
the Cards, 74-39, last year on the
Farm.
Distance events
USC's strength lies in the dis
tance events. Stanford sopho
more Bill Chao will meet a for
midable Trojan 1000-yard free
style contingent of three men
with times under 9:27.
"Bill will really have his work
cut out for him," said Gaughran,
"since his best time is around
9:40."
Stanford's remaining events

ought to be less one-sided. The
most exciting matchups should
come in 50 and 100-yard frees
tyle events, where Card Dave
Fairbank and USC's Joe Bottom
will be pitted against each other.
Bottom heat Fairbank for the
NCAA crown in the 50-free last
