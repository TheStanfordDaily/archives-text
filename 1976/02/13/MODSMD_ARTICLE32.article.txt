# Injuries weaken Stanford lineup
## Cards host OSU, Oregon 
### Paul Bauman 
Injuries are never the sort of things you
wish for, but if any basketball team can not
afford them, it's Stanford. The Cards host
Oregon State tonight and Oregon tomorrow
evening with one player's leg in a cast, and a
starter whose leg probably should be.
Guard Paul Giovacchini underwent
surgery Monday morning after damaging
knee ligaments against Oregon last week.
The freshman's knee was practically over
hauled as Dr. Fred Behling repaired liga
ments, reworked part of the knee and re
moved cartilage.
With half the Pacific Eight schedule com
pleted, Giovacchini is finished for the sea
son. And we were just learning how to pro
nounce his name. . .
You could say that George Schader is
playing with a broken leg. The Card forward
has a "stress fracture," or fine break, of the
fibula alongside his left knee. Schader said
the injury first occurred in the USC game a
month ago and was later aggravated in a
practice in Hawaii.
Trainer Dave Blanchard says Schader can
play without risking further injury, but not

without great pain and decreased mobility.
Schader, who averages eight rebounds a
game, collected only five boards in the Ore
gon and Oregon State games combined last
week.
"We're thin of course, now that Schader is
on a game-to-game basis and Giovacchini's
out," said Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso. "It
sounds like you're crying the blues, but it's a
matter of not having a great deal of depth to
begin with."
The injury situation will result in more
playing time for Jay Carter, Jeff McHugh and
Mike Simons. Dißiaso will not hesitate to
use McHugh if Schader's leg affects his per
formance too much. Simons, who came off
the bench against Oregon last week to hit
three quick long jumpers,is a good outside
shooter but appears to need a little work on
defense and ballhandling.
Stanford (7-13 overall and 1-6 in the
Pac-8) will have to contend with thePac-B's
top defensive team in Oregon (13-9 and 4-3)
and the league's best shooting team in Ore
gon State (13-7 and 5-2) this weekend.
If Beaver guard George Tucker, who's try

ing to recover from a sprained ankle, doesn't
start, Oregon State's lineup will include five
players with shooting percentages over
.500:
Lonnie Shelton (.580), Rocky Smith (.571),
Paul Miller (.550), Don Smith (.514) and
Rickey bee (.524).
The Smiths' names may be ordinary, but
their scoring abilities aren't. The pair de
stroyed Stanford with its outside shooting
in Corvalis.
Shelton, the sixth leading scorer in the
Pac-8, spared the Cards the task of guarding
him last weekend by getting in foul trouble
and playing only 12 minutes. He may not be
so gracious tonight.
Oregon's Ron Lee is a great all-round
player, but he's been in a shooting slump for
about a year and one-half. Forward Greg
Ballard is the one who keeps the Ducks af
loat. Ballard is averaging 16.1 points and
10.0 rebounds a game.
Both games will be broadcast at 8:05 p.m.
by KZSU (90.1 KM) from either Maples
Pavilion or Stanford Medical Center, de
pending on lady luck.

Trainer Dave Blanchard says Schader can
play without risking further injury, but not

without great pain and decreased mobility.
Schader, who averages eight rebounds a
game, collected only five boards in the Ore
gon and Oregon State games combined last
week.
"We're thin of course, now that Schader is
on a game-to-game basis and Giovacchini's
out," said Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso. "It
sounds like you're crying the blues, but it's a
matter of not having a great deal of depth to
begin with."
The injury situation will result in more
playing time for Jay Carter, Jeff McHugh and
Mike Simons. Dißiaso will not hesitate to
use McHugh if Schader's leg affects his per
formance too much. Simons, who came off
the bench against Oregon last week to hit
three quick long jumpers,is a good outside
shooter but appears to need a little work on
defense and ballhandling.
Stanford (7-13 overall and 1-6 in the
Pac-8) will have to contend with thePac-B's
top defensive team in Oregon (13-9 and 4-3)
and the league's best shooting team in Ore
gon State (13-7 and 5-2) this weekend.
If Beaver guard George Tucker, who's try

ing to recover from a sprained ankle, doesn't
start, Oregon State's lineup will include five
players with shooting percentages over
.500:
Lonnie Shelton (.580), Rocky Smith (.571),
Paul Miller (.550), Don Smith (.514) and
Rickey bee (.524).
The Smiths' names may be ordinary, but
their scoring abilities aren't. The pair de
stroyed Stanford with its outside shooting
in Corvalis.
Shelton, the sixth leading scorer in the
Pac-8, spared the Cards the task of guarding
him last weekend by getting in foul trouble
and playing only 12 minutes. He may not be
so gracious tonight.
Oregon's Ron Lee is a great all-round
player, but he's been in a shooting slump for
about a year and one-half. Forward Greg
Ballard is the one who keeps the Ducks af
loat. Ballard is averaging 16.1 points and
10.0 rebounds a game.
Both games will be broadcast at 8:05 p.m.
by KZSU (90.1 KM) from either Maples
Pavilion or Stanford Medical Center, de
pending on lady luck.
Injuries are never the sort of things you
wish for, but if any basketball team can not
afford them, it's Stanford. The Cards host
Oregon State tonight and Oregon tomorrow
evening with one player's leg in a cast, and a
starter whose leg probably should be.
Guard Paul Giovacchini underwent
surgery Monday morning after damaging
knee ligaments against Oregon last week.
The freshman's knee was practically over
hauled as Dr. Fred Behling repaired liga
ments, reworked part of the knee and re
moved cartilage.
With half the Pacific Eight schedule com
pleted, Giovacchini is finished for the sea
son. And we were just learning how to pro
nounce his name. . .
You could say that George Schader is
playing with a broken leg. The Card forward
has a "stress fracture," or fine break, of the
fibula alongside his left knee. Schader said
the injury first occurred in the USC game a
month ago and was later aggravated in a
practice in Hawaii.
