# Card swimmer values travels
## ...Anne Brodell aims higher than Summer Olympics 
### Jill Lieber 
Stanford freestyler Anne
Brodell's swim career has
been highlighted by top
world ratings, as in 1973 and
1974 when she was ranked
sixth in the world in the
1500-meter freestyle. Hut for
the sophomore from Newton
Square, Pa., the people she
has met and the places she's
seen are what have made
swimming a meaningful part
of her life.
In 1973 Brodell swam in
the Russian National Champ
ionships and set an American
record in the 800-meter
freestyle.
"It was one of the first times
in my life that I've really felt
patriotic," she said. "Just
talking to kids — the Ruma
nians especially—they really
think of America as the em
bodiment of freedom."
Swimming has also taken
her to Germany and Holland.
But there is a trip to Chile in
1973 that she will never
forget. War broke out and the
team was trapped in Chile for
a month.
Trapped in Chile
"We went to Chile to show
their national team that it is
possible to workout hard. We
got in the water and swam
with them. We lived in their
homes. We got close to the
kids. Then we were stuck
there and had to watch them
stand in lines that were four
blocks long just to get food.
And we saw their money de
value 100 percent."
Swimming has increased
relationships for her and she
found it easier to enter Stan
ford last year because she
immediately belonged to a
group.
"The team is always there.
They may not be your closest
friends, but they care about
what you're doing, because to
you swimming is one of the

most important things in your
life."
Not pressured
Still Brodell admitted that
it's hard to form friendships
with teammates who swim in
the same event. However she
said that women distance
swimmers here are not feel
ing any pressure in this
Olympic year. "We're not let
ting swimming get in the way
of any friendships."
But practicing with Stan
ford's men's varsity swim
ming team makes friendships
harder. Brodell said there is a
lot of pressure on a woman in
a sport not to live up to her
full potential.
"If a guy is threatened by
me swimming better than
him then he won't ask me out.
I've known times, especially
in high school, where guys
I've been going out with
would get teased by other
guys and the coach if I beat
him in practice."
'Different outlook'
Brodell has found coaching
small children to be another
rewarding part of swimming.
She said it has given her a dif
ferent outlook on the sport.
Last April she thought about
giving up swimming, but
teaching others has given her
a greater love for the sport.
"If you really love swim
ming, then it's no sacrifice to
do it. But if it's getting in the
way of your life, and it's no
longer a part of your dreams,
it's better to quit. You are not
being fair to yourself or to
your sport."
This quarter she is working
for Community Association
for the Retarded (CAR) in Palo
Alto.
"There's a certain humility
you get when you realize that
all this ability you have is a
gift. Your goals seem so inci
dental when you work with
handicapped people. They

feel so good just to have free
movement in the water or to
be able to blow bubbles out
their nose."
Early start
Brodell started swimming
when she was two years old.
Her family lived in Saudi
Arabia and swimming was
the easiest way to find relief
from the heat. From that time
on, "the sky was the limit."
Now she says, "I'm not sure
whether I'm swimming for
fun or if I want to go to the
Olympic Trials."
Brodell, a religious studies
major, is satisfied and thank
ful for what swimming has
given her. She said that this
year it is finally paying off for
her parents, because she is
one of nine Stanford women
with an athletic scholarship.
"Women athletes have
come a long way," Brodell
said. "Swimming is a sport
where equality is foremost.

The Stanford swim teams are
both in the top 10 nationally.
There are few schools which
can claim that about both
their men's and women's
teams.'
Depth
The Card women's squad
has plenty of depth this year
and Brodell said the team be
lieves it can finish in the
number one spot nationally.
"We proved it when we
beat UCLA. Arizona State
beat us. but with our depth we
can get them at the AIAVV's in
March."
And" Brodell? Her long
range goals extend as far as
AAU Nationals in April.
She'll "play the Olympic
Trials by ear. If it's Cod's will
then I'll go for the Olympics."
Until then she and the rest of
the women's swim team will
be working to establish Stan
ford as a powerhouse in wo
men's swimming.
