UCLA coach named
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Terry
Donahue, like Dick Vermeil, is
young, personable and more
than a little gung-ho about foot
ball.
If Donahue, named UCLA's
football coach Wednesday, can
emulate Vermeil in another way
— success on the football field —
the Bruin job may be locked up
for a long time. Donahue, an as
sistant under Vermeil the past
two seasons, is 31 years old.
He becomes the 14th head
coach in UCLA's 57 years of
football, after Vermeil's an
nouncement Sunday that he was
going to coach the Philadelphia
Eagles.
A defensive tackle for the
Bruins in 1965-66, Donahue got
a quick start on his coaching
career, joining Pepper Rodgers'
Kansas staff immediately after
leaving Westwood.
At 23, he became one of the
youngest major college assistant
coaches in the country. And his
appointment to the UCLA job
makes him one of the youngest
head coaches in the major col
lege ranks.
His first task will be to con
vince the high school football
prospects contacted by Vermeil
to come to UCLA. The deadline
for signing the National Letter of
Intent to enroll is Wednesday
Feb. 18.
