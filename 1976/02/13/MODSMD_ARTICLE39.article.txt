## Card golfers rebuilding 
### Marc Strassman 
"I'm not that optimistic, but I
am very encouraged," says
Charles "Bud" Finger, Stanford
golf coach, assessing the pros
pects for his men's varsity golf
team this season.
The team has been doing well
so far, finishing second in the
California Invitational at Ber
keley on Jan. 30, and winning
the Kickoff Tournament at Stan
ford last weekend.
Coach Finger is particularly
pleased with the early season
performances of senior Wade
Nonnenberg, who has an overall
average of 74.6 for his last six
rounds.
The rest of this year's team,
and their six-round averages
thus far are: junior Jay Johnston,
74.3; sophomore Mike Peck,
74.8; freshman Doug Rice, 75.1;
junior Bruce McDonald, 76.3;
and junior Glen Goethals, 76.6.
Rebuilding job
Finger faces a rebuilding job.
since the Cards lost four seniors
last year. "We're going to have to
develop if we're going to be
great," he said. But he admits
that the young Stanford squad
has surprised him. "Their per
formance is better than what we
thought it would be.
Finger praised Peck, who
finished 16th in last June's
NCAA golf championships.
"Peck is capable of making four
or five birdies in a row. He's
using a new, extremely firm

driver for more accuracy and
control.'' Finger. "He's an
extremely long driver, and he's
still driving 270 yards, but with
more accuracy. His putting and
short game are good." he added.
There will be no Pacific Eight
golf competition this season as
such, because of a Pac-H move to
split the northern and southern
schools. The four southern Pac-H
schools will hold a tournament
May 3-4 at the Wilshire Country
Club in Los Angeles.
On Feb. 7, the Cards played a
Scotch foursome round with the
Stanford women's varsity squad.
Under this form of play, each
member of the mixed pair tees
off, the longest (or best placed)
drive is selected, the person who
didn't hit it hits the next shot and
the players alternate until the
ball is holed. Pam Palmieri and

McDonald won the Scotch four
some round with a 7b. Finger
saiil that the women's team is
more "hopped up" this year.
Other highlights this year in
clude the second annual Tom
Watson Pro-Am Tournament
here on Sept. 20. Watson, a 1971
Stanford graduate, was the
seventh biggest money winner
on the PGA tour last year, earn
ing $153,795. Funds generated
by thii tournament, which will
have an entry tee of $250, will go
'to support the Stanford golf
program.
The team will participate in 13
more tournaments this season,
and eight additional matches.
The next match will be against
Fresno St.ite at Stanford today;
the last will be against the Pebble
Beach All Stars at Monterey
Peninsula on May 24.
