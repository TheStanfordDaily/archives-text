## Concorde-cost to environment? 
### Geoffrey Samuels 
The recent decision of William T.
Coleman Jr., Secretary of Transporta
tion, allowing the British and French
built Concorde to land in the United
States on a 16 month trial basis, has
met with varied response from Univer
sity professors.
Opinion differed on the plane's ef
fect on the environment, the social cost
of the noise pollution and the need for
the plane at its current level of
technological development. How
ever, all agreed that the Concorde was
not economically feasible and would
require British and French govern
ment subsidies to remain in operation.
Aeronautics and Astronautics Emer
tusProf. Nicholas Hoff said the present
Concorde is "absolutely uneconomi
cal." He cited the recent rise in fuel

costs as the deciding factor in the
plane's economic unfeasibility. The
plane was designed he said when the
cost of fuel was not taken into account,
he said.
While Hoff favored Coleman's deci
sion, he criticized the noise pollution
of the plane. The noise level of opera
tion was not considered, when the
plane was developed, he said. Al
though the take-off and landing noise
"can be reduced by proper design,"
acceptance of the sonic boom was
largely a question of public tolerance,
he added.
Controversy over the effect of noise
pollution has centered on the diffi
culty of measuring its social effect and
cost.
Law Prof. William Baxter studied the
difficulties of legal appraisal of the en

vironmental and social effect of the
American Supersonic Transit(SST)
program in the late sixties as part of his
interest in governmental regulation of
business.
Social cost
In reference to New York's Kennedy
airport, he said that the population
congestion was such that the social
cost of the noise would be "quite high
there."
"Since we've never set up a decent
mechanism for even measuring —
much less internalizing in the
operator's expense accounts — the
cost of that noise, its hard to say
exactly how much it's going to be,"
Baxter remarked.
Baxter said the plane is probably the
worst technological design of any
plane produced. Building and operat
ing has already caused severe
economic difficulties, he said, and
"only the opening up of the North At
lantic routes generally wouldhelp"de
fray the cost.
American SST
However, he warned that if Col
eman's decision withstood court chal
lenges, pressure would develop to
renew an American SST program
"That would carry with it,"he said, "a
much more serious set of questions
about the noise and other environmen
tal costs of operating a substantial fleet
of SSTs."
In considering the damaging effects
of the plane on the ozone layer of the
atmosphere, Hoff said that "they have
been largely exaggerated, but it is un
deniable that there is an effect in prin
ciple."
The current usage of super-sonic
military aircraft has only had a very
minimal effect on the layer and he
added that the limited use of the Con
corde will have no effect on the ozone.
Limited demand
Richard Shevell, consulting profes
sor of aeronautics and astronautics,
did not foresee a large demand for the
Concorde, therefore limiting the
number of flights. I don't think enough
people will be willing to pay the cost of
flying on the Concorde to justify a
large number of flights," he said.
British Airways has recently an
nounced that it expects to charge
$1168 for round-trip fare between
London and New York and $1240 for a
round-trip fare between London and
Washington. These figures are 17.7
percent higher than present first class
fares.
Political Science Prof. Jan Triska, a
specialist in international law, said
that "in terms of equity, the decision of
the U.S. is wrong. The social costs and
potentiallv damaging environmental

effects to the plane, he explained, are
greater than the benefit of the plane to
limited users."
Detrimental effects
He added the detrimental effects of
the Concorde affect all countries,
while the plane is only used to the
advantage of several countries. "In
point of view of international law," he
said, "it is possible to violate the rights
of third countries through bi-lateral
agreements."
Two reasons were cited by George
Bach, professor of economics, as in
ducing the British and French to con
tinue with their Concorde program:
the increase of national prestige and
the possibility that they would be in
the vanguard of the next stage of avia
tion development.

of the noise pollution and the need for
the plane at its current level of
technological development. How
ever, all agreed that the Concorde was
not economically feasible and would
require British and French govern
ment subsidies to remain in operation.
Aeronautics and Astronautics Emer
tusProf. Nicholas Hoff said the present
Concorde is "absolutely uneconomi
cal." He cited the recent rise in fuel

costs as the deciding factor in the
plane's economic unfeasibility. The
plane was designed he said when the
cost of fuel was not taken into account,
he said.
While Hoff favored Coleman's deci
sion, he criticized the noise pollution
of the plane. The noise level of opera
tion was not considered, when the
plane was developed, he said. Al
though the take-off and landing noise
"can be reduced by proper design,"
acceptance of the sonic boom was
largely a question of public tolerance,
he added.
Controversy over the effect of noise
pollution has centered on the diffi
culty of measuring its social effect and
cost.
Law Prof. William Baxter studied the
difficulties of legal appraisal of the en

vironmental and social effect of the
American Supersonic Transit(SST)
program in the late sixties as part of his
interest in governmental regulation of
business.
Social cost
In reference to New York's Kennedy
airport, he said that the population
congestion was such that the social
cost of the noise would be "quite high
there."
"Since we've never set up a decent
mechanism for even measuring —
much less internalizing in the
operator's expense accounts — the
cost of that noise, its hard to say
exactly how much it's going to be,"
Baxter remarked.
Baxter said the plane is probably the
worst technological design of any
plane produced. Building and operat
ing has already caused severe
economic difficulties, he said, and
"only the opening up of the North At
lantic routes generally wouldhelp"de
fray the cost.
American SST
However, he warned that if Col
eman's decision withstood court chal
lenges, pressure would develop to
renew an American SST program
"That would carry with it,"he said, "a
much more serious set of questions
about the noise and other environmen
tal costs of operating a substantial fleet
of SSTs."
In considering the damaging effects
of the plane on the ozone layer of the
atmosphere, Hoff said that "they have
been largely exaggerated, but it is un
deniable that there is an effect in prin
ciple."
The current usage of super-sonic
military aircraft has only had a very
minimal effect on the layer and he
added that the limited use of the Con
corde will have no effect on the ozone.
Limited demand
Richard Shevell, consulting profes
sor of aeronautics and astronautics,
did not foresee a large demand for the
Concorde, therefore limiting the
number of flights. I don't think enough
people will be willing to pay the cost of
flying on the Concorde to justify a
large number of flights," he said.
British Airways has recently an
nounced that it expects to charge
$1168 for round-trip fare between
London and New York and $1240 for a
round-trip fare between London and
Washington. These figures are 17.7
percent higher than present first class
fares.
Political Science Prof. Jan Triska, a
specialist in international law, said
that "in terms of equity, the decision of
the U.S. is wrong. The social costs and
potentiallv damaging environmental

effects to the plane, he explained, are
greater than the benefit of the plane to
limited users."
Detrimental effects
He added the detrimental effects of
the Concorde affect all countries,
while the plane is only used to the
advantage of several countries. "In
point of view of international law," he
said, "it is possible to violate the rights
of third countries through bi-lateral
agreements."
Two reasons were cited by George
Bach, professor of economics, as in
ducing the British and French to con
tinue with their Concorde program:
the increase of national prestige and
the possibility that they would be in
the vanguard of the next stage of avia
tion development.
The recent decision of William T.
Coleman Jr., Secretary of Transporta
tion, allowing the British and French
built Concorde to land in the United
States on a 16 month trial basis, has
met with varied response from Univer
sity professors.
