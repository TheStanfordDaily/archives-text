China-Russia clash
TOKYO — China yesterday reported "face
to-face struggles against Soviet armed intrud
ers" in China's rugged northwest frontier, but
gave no details on these developments in the
long and sometimes bloody dispute over the
5000-mile Chinese-Soviet border.
There was no immediate comment from the
Kremlin, which last week called reports of
clashes in northwest Sinkiang province, home
of important Chinese nuclear testing facilities,
"a lie from beginning to end."
"The Khalkhas nationality militia in Ahochi
County has frequently had face-to-face struggles
against Soviet armed intruders' wanton provo
cations and obstruction of Chinese herdsmen in
their work. The militia has been a strong force in
frustrating the criminal plots of the Soviet re
visionist new czars."
Hsinhua, China's official news agency, said
nothing about the time, extent or severity of the
struggles or about any casualties. It also was not
known if these were previously unreported
clashes.
The Chinese press has been scolding the
Soviet Union more often and more severely
lately, accusing it of being a "socialist
imperialist" power trying to spread its domina
tion throughout the world and of restoring
capitalism at home, betraying Communist prin
ciples.
To defuse the border situation, China has cal
led for troop withdrawals from the frontier to
prevent military clashes and the holding of talks
for a nonaggression treaty.
The Soviet Union rejected the Chinese prop
osals, saying it could not accept Peking's posi
tion that some pieces of Soviet-held territory
were "disputed areas."
South Africa girds for war
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — South Af
rica is openly seeking an accomodation with
victorious Communist-backed forces in Angola
but is also preparing for the possibility of a major
war.
Officials have repeatedly declared in Parlia
ment and privately that South Africa is willing
to seek a peaceful compromise with the Soviet
backed Popular Movement (MPLA) in Angola.
But the nation is also girding itself for war
with troop callups, increased military training
schedules and a major buildup of forces along
Angola's southern border.
Jittery South Africans watch developments in
Angola with a sense of foreboding and many fear
an eventual confrontation with the MPLA in the
former Portuguese territory.
Since the beginning of its offensive in De
cember, the MPLA has virtually wiped out all
military opposition in both northern and south
ern Angola.
What is not clear is whether the MPLA, the
Cubans and the Soviet Union are prepared to
push their victory all the way to Angola's south
ern border with South-West Africa, a territory

thc*t South Africa has controlled for 50 years
under a League of Nations mandate that is now
expired. South Africa has refused to withdraw
from the mineral-rich territory.
Kissinger blasts committee
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger angrily denounced the House Intelli
gence Committee, accusing it yesterday of tak
ing part in "a new form of McCarthyism" by
distorting classified information until it became
"a vicious lie."
He warned that the misuse of the information
supplied to the panel is damaging theconduct of
U.S. foreign policy.
The latest leak of material from the intelli
gence committee, chaired by Rep. Otis Pike (D-
N.Y.) occurred Wednesday when the Village
Voice a New York weekly newspaper, published
a section of the committee's report.
Kissinger accused the panel of releasing
"classified information in a manner that is so
distorted that the total impact is to prevent a
vicious lie."
Kissinger was mentioned throughout the re
port as a man with a "passion for secrecy" whose
"comments . .. are at variance with the fact."
Without responding to any of the specific
charges in the report, Kissinger said that misuse
of the information "in a totally irresponsible
fashion must do damage to the foreign policy of
the United States."
Speaking at a news conference at the State
Department, Kissinger also:
—Said the progress of the Soviet-backed
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola
and the Cuban success in Africa could be treated
with indifference by the United States "only at
the risk of greater tragedy" throughout Africa.
—Revealed that the United States viewed the
radioactive microwave bugging by the Soviet
Union ofthe U.S. Embassy in Moscow as a "mat
ter of great complexity and sensitivity" and has
made "unilateral efforts to reduce the danger.
Ford offers probe aid
WASHINGTON — President Ford offered
House Speaker Carl Albert "all services and re
sources of the executive branch" yesterday to
find out who leaked segments of the Select
House Intelligence Committee's report.
Asked if the offer included use of FBI and
Internal Revenue Service agents, White House
Press Secretary Ron Nessen told reporters: "You
need to go ask Carl Albert." Nessen said Albert
had not asked for any help."
Albert was not available for comment on
Ford's suggestion.
The Village Voice a weekly newspaper in New
York City, published 24 pages of long excerpts
from the report, and the New York Times and
CBS Correspondent Danial Schorr had detailed
reports clearly based on a reading of drafts.
The final report of the committee headed by

Chairman Otis Pike (D-N.Y.) accused Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger of pressing for covert
operations over CIA objections, having "a pas
sion for secrecy" and at one point even lying.
The House voted last month not to release the
report.
Ford's broad offer of all federal resources to try
to track down the source of the leak to the Vil
lage Voice appeared partly a response to a
statement by Pike that the administration might
have leaked it to make the committee look bad.
Nessen said he was confident the leak "did not
come out of the executive branch." He said
Ford's disposition was to believe the Village
Voice leak and others "came from Congress."
Ford discloses income
WASHINGTON — President Ford said yes
terday he and his wife have a net worth of
$323,489, pay out 42 percent of their gross in
come in taxes and aren't saving any money.
A statement of the Ford's net worth and their
tax status over a nine-year period was distri
buted to reporters by White Press Secretary Ron
Nessen.
Nessen said Ford believes that all candidates
for the presidency should make similar disclo
sures.
The statement indicated that the net worth of
the Ford family has increased about $67,100
since he was nominated to be Presidentßichard
M. Nixon's vice president in 1973. The bulk of
the increase represented higher estimated mar
ket values for four properties that the Fords own
or in which they have an interest.
Conßail plans revised
WASHINGTON — Conßail, the new
government-backed rail system to be formed
from seven ailing Northeastern railroads, will be
2000 miles longer and millions of dollars more
costly than anticipated, the U.S. Railway As
sociation said yesterday.
Conßail also will face less competition in the
Northeast and Midwest region where it will op
erate and probably will have a better chance to
turn a profit quickly because of the changes, the
association said.
The new Conßail plan calls for a 17,000-mile
long rail system that will stretch from the Atlan
tic Ocean to the Mississippi River and will ex
tend into 17 states.
Conßail will be created by consolidating the
main routes of the Penn Central, the Erie Lac
kawanna, the Reading, the Central of New Jer
sey, the Lehigh Valley, the Lehigh and Hudson
River and the Ann Arbor railroads.
Under USRA's original plan, Conßail would
have been about 15,000 miles long. Most of the
Erie Lackawanna and Reading lines would have
been sold to the Chessie System to give that
carrier new routes through Pennsylvania and
into New York state.
The Southern Railroad would have purchased
Penn Central lines on the Delmarva Peninsula,

the strip of land between Chesapeake Bay and
the Atlantic Ocean that contains Delaware and
parts of Maryland and Virginia.
IRA guerrilla dies
WARFIELD, England — Frank Stagg, a 34-
year-old Irish Republican Army (IRA) activist,
died in an English prison cell yesterday after a
61-day hunger strike and was swiftly hailed by
the guerrillas as an IRA martyr whose death they
will avenge.
Sporadic shooting broke out in Belfast when
word of Stagg's death reached the Northern Ire
land capital. In London, bodyguards around key
politicians were reinforced and security at gov
ernment buildings was tightened.
Seamus Loughran, a one-time IRA comman
der who is the Northern Ireland organizer of the
IRA's political front, Sinn Fein, vowed in Bel
fast: " Frank Stagg's death will not go unav
enged. It cannot do so — there is a debt which
must be paid."
The British Home Office said Staff had been
warned that the "inevitable deterioration in his
health would be allowed to continue without
medical intervention unless he specifically re
quested it." He did not and the IRA blamed Bri
tain for his death.
Stagg was jailed for 10 years in November
1973 for leading an IRA unit in Coventry, the
Midlands car-manufacturing center and his
home for the last 16 years, and conspiring to
cause explosions. The hunger strike was his fifth
since he was imprisoned.
Papel Guard armed with gas
VATICAN CITY — The Vatican has added tear
gas bombs to the arsenal of the Swiss Guards, the
colorful 90-man force that is the last of the papal
armies.
Col. Pfyfer Daltishofen, corps commander,
said yesterday each man has been equipped with
a small tear gas container about the size of a can
of spray deodorant to be used for purpose of
self-defense.
Their arsenal already includes submachine
guns, rifles with bayonets and halberds, a com
bination spear and battleax with which they
stand guard at the Bronze Door, the Vatican's
main gate.
A Vatican source said the guards have re
ceived no threats but their commander wanted
to increase their protection with something
"less harmful" than the arms stored in their ar
senal and thus chose tear gas bombs.
Today's weather
Mostly fair today but with variable high
clouds at times and patchy morning fog. Increas
ing clouds with chance of rain tonight and to-
| morrow. Mild afternoon temperatures. Lows in
the upper 30s to mid 40s. Highs in the upper 50s
and 60s. Light winds.

lately, accusing it of being a "socialist
imperialist" power trying to spread its domina
tion throughout the world and of restoring
capitalism at home, betraying Communist prin
ciples.
To defuse the border situation, China has cal
led for troop withdrawals from the frontier to
prevent military clashes and the holding of talks
for a nonaggression treaty.
The Soviet Union rejected the Chinese prop
osals, saying it could not accept Peking's posi
tion that some pieces of Soviet-held territory
were "disputed areas."
South Africa girds for war
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — South Af
rica is openly seeking an accomodation with
victorious Communist-backed forces in Angola
but is also preparing for the possibility of a major
war.
Officials have repeatedly declared in Parlia
ment and privately that South Africa is willing
to seek a peaceful compromise with the Soviet
backed Popular Movement (MPLA) in Angola.
But the nation is also girding itself for war
with troop callups, increased military training
schedules and a major buildup of forces along
Angola's southern border.
Jittery South Africans watch developments in
Angola with a sense of foreboding and many fear
an eventual confrontation with the MPLA in the
former Portuguese territory.
Since the beginning of its offensive in De
cember, the MPLA has virtually wiped out all
military opposition in both northern and south
ern Angola.
What is not clear is whether the MPLA, the
Cubans and the Soviet Union are prepared to
push their victory all the way to Angola's south
ern border with South-West Africa, a territory

thc*t South Africa has controlled for 50 years
under a League of Nations mandate that is now
expired. South Africa has refused to withdraw
from the mineral-rich territory.
Kissinger blasts committee
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger angrily denounced the House Intelli
gence Committee, accusing it yesterday of tak
ing part in "a new form of McCarthyism" by
distorting classified information until it became
"a vicious lie."
He warned that the misuse of the information
supplied to the panel is damaging theconduct of
U.S. foreign policy.
The latest leak of material from the intelli
gence committee, chaired by Rep. Otis Pike (D-
N.Y.) occurred Wednesday when the Village
Voice a New York weekly newspaper, published
a section of the committee's report.
Kissinger accused the panel of releasing
"classified information in a manner that is so
distorted that the total impact is to prevent a
vicious lie."
Kissinger was mentioned throughout the re
port as a man with a "passion for secrecy" whose
"comments . .. are at variance with the fact."
Without responding to any of the specific
charges in the report, Kissinger said that misuse
of the information "in a totally irresponsible
fashion must do damage to the foreign policy of
the United States."
Speaking at a news conference at the State
Department, Kissinger also:
—Said the progress of the Soviet-backed
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola
and the Cuban success in Africa could be treated
with indifference by the United States "only at
the risk of greater tragedy" throughout Africa.
—Revealed that the United States viewed the
radioactive microwave bugging by the Soviet
Union ofthe U.S. Embassy in Moscow as a "mat
ter of great complexity and sensitivity" and has
made "unilateral efforts to reduce the danger.
Ford offers probe aid
WASHINGTON — President Ford offered
House Speaker Carl Albert "all services and re
sources of the executive branch" yesterday to
find out who leaked segments of the Select
House Intelligence Committee's report.
Asked if the offer included use of FBI and
Internal Revenue Service agents, White House
Press Secretary Ron Nessen told reporters: "You
need to go ask Carl Albert." Nessen said Albert
had not asked for any help."
Albert was not available for comment on
Ford's suggestion.
The Village Voice a weekly newspaper in New
York City, published 24 pages of long excerpts
from the report, and the New York Times and
CBS Correspondent Danial Schorr had detailed
reports clearly based on a reading of drafts.
The final report of the committee headed by

Chairman Otis Pike (D-N.Y.) accused Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger of pressing for covert
operations over CIA objections, having "a pas
sion for secrecy" and at one point even lying.
The House voted last month not to release the
report.
Ford's broad offer of all federal resources to try
to track down the source of the leak to the Vil
lage Voice appeared partly a response to a
statement by Pike that the administration might
have leaked it to make the committee look bad.
Nessen said he was confident the leak "did not
come out of the executive branch." He said
Ford's disposition was to believe the Village
Voice leak and others "came from Congress."
Ford discloses income
WASHINGTON — President Ford said yes
terday he and his wife have a net worth of
$323,489, pay out 42 percent of their gross in
come in taxes and aren't saving any money.
A statement of the Ford's net worth and their
tax status over a nine-year period was distri
buted to reporters by White Press Secretary Ron
Nessen.
Nessen said Ford believes that all candidates
for the presidency should make similar disclo
sures.
The statement indicated that the net worth of
the Ford family has increased about $67,100
since he was nominated to be Presidentßichard
M. Nixon's vice president in 1973. The bulk of
the increase represented higher estimated mar
ket values for four properties that the Fords own
or in which they have an interest.
Conßail plans revised
WASHINGTON — Conßail, the new
government-backed rail system to be formed
from seven ailing Northeastern railroads, will be
2000 miles longer and millions of dollars more
costly than anticipated, the U.S. Railway As
sociation said yesterday.
Conßail also will face less competition in the
Northeast and Midwest region where it will op
erate and probably will have a better chance to
turn a profit quickly because of the changes, the
association said.
The new Conßail plan calls for a 17,000-mile
long rail system that will stretch from the Atlan
tic Ocean to the Mississippi River and will ex
tend into 17 states.
Conßail will be created by consolidating the
main routes of the Penn Central, the Erie Lac
kawanna, the Reading, the Central of New Jer
sey, the Lehigh Valley, the Lehigh and Hudson
River and the Ann Arbor railroads.
Under USRA's original plan, Conßail would
have been about 15,000 miles long. Most of the
Erie Lackawanna and Reading lines would have
been sold to the Chessie System to give that
carrier new routes through Pennsylvania and
into New York state.
The Southern Railroad would have purchased
Penn Central lines on the Delmarva Peninsula,

the strip of land between Chesapeake Bay and
the Atlantic Ocean that contains Delaware and
parts of Maryland and Virginia.
IRA guerrilla dies
WARFIELD, England — Frank Stagg, a 34-
year-old Irish Republican Army (IRA) activist,
died in an English prison cell yesterday after a
61-day hunger strike and was swiftly hailed by
the guerrillas as an IRA martyr whose death they
will avenge.
Sporadic shooting broke out in Belfast when
word of Stagg's death reached the Northern Ire
land capital. In London, bodyguards around key
politicians were reinforced and security at gov
ernment buildings was tightened.
Seamus Loughran, a one-time IRA comman
der who is the Northern Ireland organizer of the
IRA's political front, Sinn Fein, vowed in Bel
fast: " Frank Stagg's death will not go unav
enged. It cannot do so — there is a debt which
must be paid."
The British Home Office said Staff had been
warned that the "inevitable deterioration in his
health would be allowed to continue without
medical intervention unless he specifically re
quested it." He did not and the IRA blamed Bri
tain for his death.
Stagg was jailed for 10 years in November
1973 for leading an IRA unit in Coventry, the
Midlands car-manufacturing center and his
home for the last 16 years, and conspiring to
cause explosions. The hunger strike was his fifth
since he was imprisoned.
Papel Guard armed with gas
VATICAN CITY — The Vatican has added tear
gas bombs to the arsenal of the Swiss Guards, the
colorful 90-man force that is the last of the papal
armies.
Col. Pfyfer Daltishofen, corps commander,
said yesterday each man has been equipped with
a small tear gas container about the size of a can
of spray deodorant to be used for purpose of
self-defense.
Their arsenal already includes submachine
guns, rifles with bayonets and halberds, a com
bination spear and battleax with which they
stand guard at the Bronze Door, the Vatican's
main gate.
A Vatican source said the guards have re
ceived no threats but their commander wanted
to increase their protection with something
"less harmful" than the arms stored in their ar
senal and thus chose tear gas bombs.
Today's weather
Mostly fair today but with variable high
clouds at times and patchy morning fog. Increas
ing clouds with chance of rain tonight and to-
| morrow. Mild afternoon temperatures. Lows in
the upper 30s to mid 40s. Highs in the upper 50s
and 60s. Light winds.
China-Russia clash
TOKYO — China yesterday reported "face
to-face struggles against Soviet armed intrud
ers" in China's rugged northwest frontier, but
gave no details on these developments in the
long and sometimes bloody dispute over the
5000-mile Chinese-Soviet border.
There was no immediate comment from the
Kremlin, which last week called reports of
clashes in northwest Sinkiang province, home
of important Chinese nuclear testing facilities,
"a lie from beginning to end."
"The Khalkhas nationality militia in Ahochi
County has frequently had face-to-face struggles
against Soviet armed intruders' wanton provo
cations and obstruction of Chinese herdsmen in
their work. The militia has been a strong force in
frustrating the criminal plots of the Soviet re
visionist new czars."
Hsinhua, China's official news agency, said
nothing about the time, extent or severity of the
struggles or about any casualties. It also was not
known if these were previously unreported
clashes.
The Chinese press has been scolding the
Soviet Union more often and more severely

Jittery South Africans watch developments in
Angola with a sense of foreboding and many fear
an eventual confrontation with the MPLA in the
former Portuguese territory.
Since the beginning of its offensive in De
cember, the MPLA has virtually wiped out all
military opposition in both northern and south
ern Angola.
What is not clear is whether the MPLA, the
Cubans and the Soviet Union are prepared to
push their victory all the way to Angola's south
ern border with South-West Africa, a territory

thc*t South Africa has controlled for 50 years
under a League of Nations mandate that is now
expired. South Africa has refused to withdraw
from the mineral-rich territory.
Kissinger blasts committee
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger angrily denounced the House Intelli
gence Committee, accusing it yesterday of tak
ing part in "a new form of McCarthyism" by
distorting classified information until it became
"a vicious lie."
He warned that the misuse of the information
supplied to the panel is damaging theconduct of
U.S. foreign policy.
The latest leak of material from the intelli
gence committee, chaired by Rep. Otis Pike (D-
N.Y.) occurred Wednesday when the Village
Voice a New York weekly newspaper, published
a section of the committee's report.
Kissinger accused the panel of releasing
"classified information in a manner that is so
distorted that the total impact is to prevent a
vicious lie."
Kissinger was mentioned throughout the re
port as a man with a "passion for secrecy" whose
"comments . .. are at variance with the fact."
Without responding to any of the specific
charges in the report, Kissinger said that misuse
of the information "in a totally irresponsible
fashion must do damage to the foreign policy of
the United States."
Speaking at a news conference at the State
Department, Kissinger also:
—Said the progress of the Soviet-backed
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola
and the Cuban success in Africa could be treated
with indifference by the United States "only at
the risk of greater tragedy" throughout Africa.
—Revealed that the United States viewed the
radioactive microwave bugging by the Soviet
Union ofthe U.S. Embassy in Moscow as a "mat
ter of great complexity and sensitivity" and has
made "unilateral efforts to reduce the danger.
Ford offers probe aid
WASHINGTON — President Ford offered
House Speaker Carl Albert "all services and re
sources of the executive branch" yesterday to
find out who leaked segments of the Select
House Intelligence Committee's report.
Asked if the offer included use of FBI and
Internal Revenue Service agents, White House
Press Secretary Ron Nessen told reporters: "You
need to go ask Carl Albert." Nessen said Albert
had not asked for any help."
Albert was not available for comment on
Ford's suggestion.
The Village Voice a weekly newspaper in New
York City, published 24 pages of long excerpts
from the report, and the New York Times and
CBS Correspondent Danial Schorr had detailed
reports clearly based on a reading of drafts.
The final report of the committee headed by

Chairman Otis Pike (D-N.Y.) accused Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger of pressing for covert
operations over CIA objections, having "a pas
sion for secrecy" and at one point even lying.
The House voted last month not to release the
report.
Ford's broad offer of all federal resources to try
to track down the source of the leak to the Vil
lage Voice appeared partly a response to a
statement by Pike that the administration might
have leaked it to make the committee look bad.
Nessen said he was confident the leak "did not
come out of the executive branch." He said
Ford's disposition was to believe the Village
Voice leak and others "came from Congress."
Ford discloses income
WASHINGTON — President Ford said yes
terday he and his wife have a net worth of
$323,489, pay out 42 percent of their gross in
come in taxes and aren't saving any money.
A statement of the Ford's net worth and their
tax status over a nine-year period was distri
buted to reporters by White Press Secretary Ron
Nessen.
Nessen said Ford believes that all candidates
for the presidency should make similar disclo
sures.
The statement indicated that the net worth of
the Ford family has increased about $67,100
since he was nominated to be Presidentßichard
M. Nixon's vice president in 1973. The bulk of
the increase represented higher estimated mar
ket values for four properties that the Fords own
or in which they have an interest.
Conßail plans revised
WASHINGTON — Conßail, the new
government-backed rail system to be formed
from seven ailing Northeastern railroads, will be
2000 miles longer and millions of dollars more
costly than anticipated, the U.S. Railway As
sociation said yesterday.
Conßail also will face less competition in the
Northeast and Midwest region where it will op
erate and probably will have a better chance to
turn a profit quickly because of the changes, the
association said.
The new Conßail plan calls for a 17,000-mile
long rail system that will stretch from the Atlan
tic Ocean to the Mississippi River and will ex
tend into 17 states.
Conßail will be created by consolidating the
main routes of the Penn Central, the Erie Lac
kawanna, the Reading, the Central of New Jer
sey, the Lehigh Valley, the Lehigh and Hudson
River and the Ann Arbor railroads.
Under USRA's original plan, Conßail would
have been about 15,000 miles long. Most of the
Erie Lackawanna and Reading lines would have
been sold to the Chessie System to give that
carrier new routes through Pennsylvania and
into New York state.
The Southern Railroad would have purchased
Penn Central lines on the Delmarva Peninsula,

the strip of land between Chesapeake Bay and
the Atlantic Ocean that contains Delaware and
parts of Maryland and Virginia.
IRA guerrilla dies
WARFIELD, England — Frank Stagg, a 34-
year-old Irish Republican Army (IRA) activist,
died in an English prison cell yesterday after a
61-day hunger strike and was swiftly hailed by
the guerrillas as an IRA martyr whose death they
will avenge.
Sporadic shooting broke out in Belfast when
word of Stagg's death reached the Northern Ire
land capital. In London, bodyguards around key
politicians were reinforced and security at gov
ernment buildings was tightened.
Seamus Loughran, a one-time IRA comman
der who is the Northern Ireland organizer of the
IRA's political front, Sinn Fein, vowed in Bel
fast: " Frank Stagg's death will not go unav
enged. It cannot do so — there is a debt which
must be paid."
The British Home Office said Staff had been
warned that the "inevitable deterioration in his
health would be allowed to continue without
medical intervention unless he specifically re
quested it." He did not and the IRA blamed Bri
tain for his death.
Stagg was jailed for 10 years in November
1973 for leading an IRA unit in Coventry, the
Midlands car-manufacturing center and his
home for the last 16 years, and conspiring to
cause explosions. The hunger strike was his fifth
since he was imprisoned.
Papel Guard armed with gas
VATICAN CITY — The Vatican has added tear
gas bombs to the arsenal of the Swiss Guards, the
colorful 90-man force that is the last of the papal
armies.
Col. Pfyfer Daltishofen, corps commander,
said yesterday each man has been equipped with
a small tear gas container about the size of a can
of spray deodorant to be used for purpose of
self-defense.
Their arsenal already includes submachine
guns, rifles with bayonets and halberds, a com
bination spear and battleax with which they
stand guard at the Bronze Door, the Vatican's
main gate.
A Vatican source said the guards have re
ceived no threats but their commander wanted
to increase their protection with something
"less harmful" than the arms stored in their ar
senal and thus chose tear gas bombs.
Today's weather
Mostly fair today but with variable high
clouds at times and patchy morning fog. Increas
ing clouds with chance of rain tonight and to-
| morrow. Mild afternoon temperatures. Lows in
the upper 30s to mid 40s. Highs in the upper 50s
and 60s. Light winds.
China-Russia clash
TOKYO — China yesterday reported "face
to-face struggles against Soviet armed intrud
ers" in China's rugged northwest frontier, but
gave no details on these developments in the
long and sometimes bloody dispute over the
5000-mile Chinese-Soviet border.
There was no immediate comment from the
Kremlin, which last week called reports of
clashes in northwest Sinkiang province, home
of important Chinese nuclear testing facilities,
"a lie from beginning to end."
"The Khalkhas nationality militia in Ahochi
County has frequently had face-to-face struggles
against Soviet armed intruders' wanton provo
cations and obstruction of Chinese herdsmen in
their work. The militia has been a strong force in
frustrating the criminal plots of the Soviet re
visionist new czars."
Hsinhua, China's official news agency, said
nothing about the time, extent or severity of the
struggles or about any casualties. It also was not
known if these were previously unreported
clashes.
The Chinese press has been scolding the
Soviet Union more often and more severely
lately, accusing it of being a "socialist
imperialist" power trying to spread its domina
tion throughout the world and of restoring
capitalism at home, betraying Communist prin
ciples.
To defuse the border situation, China has cal
led for troop withdrawals from the frontier to
prevent military clashes and the holding of talks
for a nonaggression treaty.
The Soviet Union rejected the Chinese prop
osals, saying it could not accept Peking's posi
tion that some pieces of Soviet-held territory
were "disputed areas."
South Africa girds for war
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — South Af
rica is openly seeking an accomodation with
victorious Communist-backed forces in Angola
but is also preparing for the possibility of a major
war.
Officials have repeatedly declared in Parlia
ment and privately that South Africa is willing
to seek a peaceful compromise with the Soviet
backed Popular Movement (MPLA) in Angola.
But the nation is also girding itself for war
with troop callups, increased military training
schedules and a major buildup of forces along
Angola's southern border.
Jittery South Africans watch developments in
Angola with a sense of foreboding and many fear

The latest leak of material from the intelli
gence committee, chaired by Rep. Otis Pike (D-
N.Y.) occurred Wednesday when the Village
Voice a New York weekly newspaper, published
a section of the committee's report.
Kissinger accused the panel of releasing
"classified information in a manner that is so
distorted that the total impact is to prevent a
vicious lie."
Kissinger was mentioned throughout the re
port as a man with a "passion for secrecy" whose
"comments . .. are at variance with the fact."
Without responding to any of the specific
charges in the report, Kissinger said that misuse
of the information "in a totally irresponsible
fashion must do damage to the foreign policy of
the United States."
Speaking at a news conference at the State
Department, Kissinger also:
—Said the progress of the Soviet-backed
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola
and the Cuban success in Africa could be treated
with indifference by the United States "only at
the risk of greater tragedy" throughout Africa.
—Revealed that the United States viewed the
radioactive microwave bugging by the Soviet
Union ofthe U.S. Embassy in Moscow as a "mat
ter of great complexity and sensitivity" and has
made "unilateral efforts to reduce the danger.
Ford offers probe aid
WASHINGTON — President Ford offered
House Speaker Carl Albert "all services and re
sources of the executive branch" yesterday to
find out who leaked segments of the Select
House Intelligence Committee's report.
Asked if the offer included use of FBI and
Internal Revenue Service agents, White House
Press Secretary Ron Nessen told reporters: "You
need to go ask Carl Albert." Nessen said Albert
had not asked for any help."
Albert was not available for comment on
Ford's suggestion.
The Village Voice a weekly newspaper in New
York City, published 24 pages of long excerpts
from the report, and the New York Times and
CBS Correspondent Danial Schorr had detailed
reports clearly based on a reading of drafts.
The final report of the committee headed by

Chairman Otis Pike (D-N.Y.) accused Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger of pressing for covert
operations over CIA objections, having "a pas
sion for secrecy" and at one point even lying.
The House voted last month not to release the
report.
Ford's broad offer of all federal resources to try
to track down the source of the leak to the Vil
lage Voice appeared partly a response to a
statement by Pike that the administration might
have leaked it to make the committee look bad.
Nessen said he was confident the leak "did not
come out of the executive branch." He said
Ford's disposition was to believe the Village
Voice leak and others "came from Congress."
Ford discloses income
WASHINGTON — President Ford said yes
terday he and his wife have a net worth of
$323,489, pay out 42 percent of their gross in
come in taxes and aren't saving any money.
A statement of the Ford's net worth and their
tax status over a nine-year period was distri
buted to reporters by White Press Secretary Ron
Nessen.
Nessen said Ford believes that all candidates
for the presidency should make similar disclo
sures.
The statement indicated that the net worth of
the Ford family has increased about $67,100
since he was nominated to be Presidentßichard
M. Nixon's vice president in 1973. The bulk of
the increase represented higher estimated mar
ket values for four properties that the Fords own
or in which they have an interest.
Conßail plans revised
WASHINGTON — Conßail, the new
government-backed rail system to be formed
from seven ailing Northeastern railroads, will be
2000 miles longer and millions of dollars more
costly than anticipated, the U.S. Railway As
sociation said yesterday.
Conßail also will face less competition in the
Northeast and Midwest region where it will op
erate and probably will have a better chance to
turn a profit quickly because of the changes, the
association said.
The new Conßail plan calls for a 17,000-mile
long rail system that will stretch from the Atlan
tic Ocean to the Mississippi River and will ex
tend into 17 states.
Conßail will be created by consolidating the
main routes of the Penn Central, the Erie Lac
kawanna, the Reading, the Central of New Jer
sey, the Lehigh Valley, the Lehigh and Hudson
River and the Ann Arbor railroads.
Under USRA's original plan, Conßail would
have been about 15,000 miles long. Most of the
Erie Lackawanna and Reading lines would have
been sold to the Chessie System to give that
carrier new routes through Pennsylvania and
into New York state.
The Southern Railroad would have purchased
Penn Central lines on the Delmarva Peninsula,

the strip of land between Chesapeake Bay and
the Atlantic Ocean that contains Delaware and
parts of Maryland and Virginia.
IRA guerrilla dies
WARFIELD, England — Frank Stagg, a 34-
year-old Irish Republican Army (IRA) activist,
died in an English prison cell yesterday after a
61-day hunger strike and was swiftly hailed by
the guerrillas as an IRA martyr whose death they
will avenge.
Sporadic shooting broke out in Belfast when
word of Stagg's death reached the Northern Ire
land capital. In London, bodyguards around key
politicians were reinforced and security at gov
ernment buildings was tightened.
Seamus Loughran, a one-time IRA comman
der who is the Northern Ireland organizer of the
IRA's political front, Sinn Fein, vowed in Bel
fast: " Frank Stagg's death will not go unav
enged. It cannot do so — there is a debt which
must be paid."
The British Home Office said Staff had been
warned that the "inevitable deterioration in his
health would be allowed to continue without
medical intervention unless he specifically re
quested it." He did not and the IRA blamed Bri
tain for his death.
Stagg was jailed for 10 years in November
1973 for leading an IRA unit in Coventry, the
Midlands car-manufacturing center and his
home for the last 16 years, and conspiring to
cause explosions. The hunger strike was his fifth
since he was imprisoned.
Papel Guard armed with gas
VATICAN CITY — The Vatican has added tear
gas bombs to the arsenal of the Swiss Guards, the
colorful 90-man force that is the last of the papal
armies.
Col. Pfyfer Daltishofen, corps commander,
said yesterday each man has been equipped with
a small tear gas container about the size of a can
of spray deodorant to be used for purpose of
self-defense.
Their arsenal already includes submachine
guns, rifles with bayonets and halberds, a com
bination spear and battleax with which they
stand guard at the Bronze Door, the Vatican's
main gate.
A Vatican source said the guards have re
ceived no threats but their commander wanted
to increase their protection with something
"less harmful" than the arms stored in their ar
senal and thus chose tear gas bombs.
Today's weather
Mostly fair today but with variable high
clouds at times and patchy morning fog. Increas
ing clouds with chance of rain tonight and to-
| morrow. Mild afternoon temperatures. Lows in
the upper 30s to mid 40s. Highs in the upper 50s
and 60s. Light winds.
China-Russia clash
TOKYO — China yesterday reported "face
to-face struggles against Soviet armed intrud
ers" in China's rugged northwest frontier, but
gave no details on these developments in the
long and sometimes bloody dispute over the
5000-mile Chinese-Soviet border.
There was no immediate comment from the
Kremlin, which last week called reports of
clashes in northwest Sinkiang province, home
of important Chinese nuclear testing facilities,
"a lie from beginning to end."
"The Khalkhas nationality militia in Ahochi
County has frequently had face-to-face struggles
against Soviet armed intruders' wanton provo
cations and obstruction of Chinese herdsmen in
their work. The militia has been a strong force in
frustrating the criminal plots of the Soviet re
visionist new czars."
Hsinhua, China's official news agency, said
nothing about the time, extent or severity of the
struggles or about any casualties. It also was not
known if these were previously unreported
clashes.
The Chinese press has been scolding the
Soviet Union more often and more severely
lately, accusing it of being a "socialist
imperialist" power trying to spread its domina
tion throughout the world and of restoring
capitalism at home, betraying Communist prin
ciples.
To defuse the border situation, China has cal
led for troop withdrawals from the frontier to
prevent military clashes and the holding of talks
for a nonaggression treaty.
The Soviet Union rejected the Chinese prop
osals, saying it could not accept Peking's posi
tion that some pieces of Soviet-held territory
were "disputed areas."
South Africa girds for war
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — South Af
rica is openly seeking an accomodation with
victorious Communist-backed forces in Angola
but is also preparing for the possibility of a major
war.
Officials have repeatedly declared in Parlia
ment and privately that South Africa is willing
to seek a peaceful compromise with the Soviet
backed Popular Movement (MPLA) in Angola.
But the nation is also girding itself for war
with troop callups, increased military training
schedules and a major buildup of forces along
Angola's southern border.
Jittery South Africans watch developments in
Angola with a sense of foreboding and many fear
an eventual confrontation with the MPLA in the
former Portuguese territory.
Since the beginning of its offensive in De
cember, the MPLA has virtually wiped out all
military opposition in both northern and south
ern Angola.
What is not clear is whether the MPLA, the
Cubans and the Soviet Union are prepared to
push their victory all the way to Angola's south
ern border with South-West Africa, a territory

thc*t South Africa has controlled for 50 years
under a League of Nations mandate that is now
expired. South Africa has refused to withdraw
from the mineral-rich territory.

Ford offers probe aid
WASHINGTON — President Ford offered
House Speaker Carl Albert "all services and re
sources of the executive branch" yesterday to
find out who leaked segments of the Select
House Intelligence Committee's report.
Asked if the offer included use of FBI and
Internal Revenue Service agents, White House
Press Secretary Ron Nessen told reporters: "You
need to go ask Carl Albert." Nessen said Albert
had not asked for any help."
Albert was not available for comment on
Ford's suggestion.
The Village Voice a weekly newspaper in New
York City, published 24 pages of long excerpts
from the report, and the New York Times and
CBS Correspondent Danial Schorr had detailed
reports clearly based on a reading of drafts.
The final report of the committee headed by

Chairman Otis Pike (D-N.Y.) accused Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger of pressing for covert
operations over CIA objections, having "a pas
sion for secrecy" and at one point even lying.
The House voted last month not to release the
report.
Ford's broad offer of all federal resources to try
to track down the source of the leak to the Vil
lage Voice appeared partly a response to a
statement by Pike that the administration might
have leaked it to make the committee look bad.
Nessen said he was confident the leak "did not
come out of the executive branch." He said
Ford's disposition was to believe the Village
Voice leak and others "came from Congress."
Ford discloses income
WASHINGTON — President Ford said yes
terday he and his wife have a net worth of
$323,489, pay out 42 percent of their gross in
come in taxes and aren't saving any money.
A statement of the Ford's net worth and their
tax status over a nine-year period was distri
buted to reporters by White Press Secretary Ron
Nessen.
Nessen said Ford believes that all candidates
for the presidency should make similar disclo
sures.
The statement indicated that the net worth of
the Ford family has increased about $67,100
since he was nominated to be Presidentßichard
M. Nixon's vice president in 1973. The bulk of
the increase represented higher estimated mar
ket values for four properties that the Fords own
or in which they have an interest.
Conßail plans revised
WASHINGTON — Conßail, the new
government-backed rail system to be formed
from seven ailing Northeastern railroads, will be
2000 miles longer and millions of dollars more
costly than anticipated, the U.S. Railway As
sociation said yesterday.
Conßail also will face less competition in the
Northeast and Midwest region where it will op
erate and probably will have a better chance to
turn a profit quickly because of the changes, the
association said.
The new Conßail plan calls for a 17,000-mile
long rail system that will stretch from the Atlan
tic Ocean to the Mississippi River and will ex
tend into 17 states.
Conßail will be created by consolidating the
main routes of the Penn Central, the Erie Lac
kawanna, the Reading, the Central of New Jer
sey, the Lehigh Valley, the Lehigh and Hudson
River and the Ann Arbor railroads.
Under USRA's original plan, Conßail would
have been about 15,000 miles long. Most of the
Erie Lackawanna and Reading lines would have
been sold to the Chessie System to give that
carrier new routes through Pennsylvania and
into New York state.
The Southern Railroad would have purchased
Penn Central lines on the Delmarva Peninsula,

the strip of land between Chesapeake Bay and
the Atlantic Ocean that contains Delaware and
parts of Maryland and Virginia.
IRA guerrilla dies
WARFIELD, England — Frank Stagg, a 34-
year-old Irish Republican Army (IRA) activist,
died in an English prison cell yesterday after a
61-day hunger strike and was swiftly hailed by
the guerrillas as an IRA martyr whose death they
will avenge.
Sporadic shooting broke out in Belfast when
word of Stagg's death reached the Northern Ire
land capital. In London, bodyguards around key
politicians were reinforced and security at gov
ernment buildings was tightened.
Seamus Loughran, a one-time IRA comman
der who is the Northern Ireland organizer of the
IRA's political front, Sinn Fein, vowed in Bel
fast: " Frank Stagg's death will not go unav
enged. It cannot do so — there is a debt which
must be paid."
The British Home Office said Staff had been
warned that the "inevitable deterioration in his
health would be allowed to continue without
medical intervention unless he specifically re
quested it." He did not and the IRA blamed Bri
tain for his death.
Stagg was jailed for 10 years in November
1973 for leading an IRA unit in Coventry, the
Midlands car-manufacturing center and his
home for the last 16 years, and conspiring to
cause explosions. The hunger strike was his fifth
since he was imprisoned.
Papel Guard armed with gas
VATICAN CITY — The Vatican has added tear
gas bombs to the arsenal of the Swiss Guards, the
colorful 90-man force that is the last of the papal
armies.
Col. Pfyfer Daltishofen, corps commander,
said yesterday each man has been equipped with
a small tear gas container about the size of a can
of spray deodorant to be used for purpose of
self-defense.
Their arsenal already includes submachine
guns, rifles with bayonets and halberds, a com
bination spear and battleax with which they
stand guard at the Bronze Door, the Vatican's
main gate.
A Vatican source said the guards have re
ceived no threats but their commander wanted
to increase their protection with something
"less harmful" than the arms stored in their ar
senal and thus chose tear gas bombs.
Today's weather
Mostly fair today but with variable high
clouds at times and patchy morning fog. Increas
ing clouds with chance of rain tonight and to-
| morrow. Mild afternoon temperatures. Lows in
the upper 30s to mid 40s. Highs in the upper 50s
and 60s. Light winds.
China-Russia clash
TOKYO — China yesterday reported "face
to-face struggles against Soviet armed intrud
ers" in China's rugged northwest frontier, but
gave no details on these developments in the
long and sometimes bloody dispute over the
5000-mile Chinese-Soviet border.
There was no immediate comment from the
Kremlin, which last week called reports of
clashes in northwest Sinkiang province, home
of important Chinese nuclear testing facilities,
"a lie from beginning to end."
"The Khalkhas nationality militia in Ahochi
County has frequently had face-to-face struggles
against Soviet armed intruders' wanton provo
cations and obstruction of Chinese herdsmen in
their work. The militia has been a strong force in
frustrating the criminal plots of the Soviet re
visionist new czars."
Hsinhua, China's official news agency, said
nothing about the time, extent or severity of the
struggles or about any casualties. It also was not
known if these were previously unreported
clashes.
The Chinese press has been scolding the
Soviet Union more often and more severely
lately, accusing it of being a "socialist
imperialist" power trying to spread its domina
tion throughout the world and of restoring
capitalism at home, betraying Communist prin
ciples.
To defuse the border situation, China has cal
led for troop withdrawals from the frontier to
prevent military clashes and the holding of talks
for a nonaggression treaty.
The Soviet Union rejected the Chinese prop
osals, saying it could not accept Peking's posi
tion that some pieces of Soviet-held territory
were "disputed areas."
South Africa girds for war
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — South Af
rica is openly seeking an accomodation with
victorious Communist-backed forces in Angola
but is also preparing for the possibility of a major
war.
Officials have repeatedly declared in Parlia
ment and privately that South Africa is willing
to seek a peaceful compromise with the Soviet
backed Popular Movement (MPLA) in Angola.
But the nation is also girding itself for war
with troop callups, increased military training
schedules and a major buildup of forces along
Angola's southern border.
Jittery South Africans watch developments in
Angola with a sense of foreboding and many fear
an eventual confrontation with the MPLA in the
former Portuguese territory.
Since the beginning of its offensive in De
cember, the MPLA has virtually wiped out all
military opposition in both northern and south
ern Angola.
What is not clear is whether the MPLA, the
Cubans and the Soviet Union are prepared to
push their victory all the way to Angola's south
ern border with South-West Africa, a territory

thc*t South Africa has controlled for 50 years
under a League of Nations mandate that is now
expired. South Africa has refused to withdraw
from the mineral-rich territory.
Kissinger blasts committee
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger angrily denounced the House Intelli
gence Committee, accusing it yesterday of tak
ing part in "a new form of McCarthyism" by
distorting classified information until it became
"a vicious lie."
He warned that the misuse of the information
supplied to the panel is damaging theconduct of
U.S. foreign policy.
The latest leak of material from the intelli
gence committee, chaired by Rep. Otis Pike (D-
N.Y.) occurred Wednesday when the Village
Voice a New York weekly newspaper, published
a section of the committee's report.
Kissinger accused the panel of releasing
"classified information in a manner that is so
distorted that the total impact is to prevent a
vicious lie."
Kissinger was mentioned throughout the re
port as a man with a "passion for secrecy" whose
"comments . .. are at variance with the fact."
Without responding to any of the specific
charges in the report, Kissinger said that misuse
of the information "in a totally irresponsible
fashion must do damage to the foreign policy of
the United States."
Speaking at a news conference at the State
Department, Kissinger also:
—Said the progress of the Soviet-backed
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola
and the Cuban success in Africa could be treated
with indifference by the United States "only at
the risk of greater tragedy" throughout Africa.
—Revealed that the United States viewed the
radioactive microwave bugging by the Soviet
Union ofthe U.S. Embassy in Moscow as a "mat
ter of great complexity and sensitivity" and has
made "unilateral efforts to reduce the danger.
