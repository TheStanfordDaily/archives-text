# Hearst tape played for jury
## 
### Christy Wise 
The tape made by Patricia Hearst
three days after the San Francisco
Hibernia Bank robbery was played in
court today by U.S. attorney James L.
Browning, Jr. Hearst is on trial for rob
bing the Hibernia Bank April 15,1974.
During the tape-playing, Hearst's
face was flushed, her eyes were
clouded and she frequently took sips
of water.
On the tape. Hearst admits to help
ing with the robbery, denounces her
ex-fiance Steven Weed and her parents
as "pigs" and calls herself "a soldier in
the People's Army ... As for (my)
being brainwashed, that is ridiculous
to the point of being beyond belief."
Earlier in the day, defense atty. F.
Lee Bailey objected to weapons evi
dence presented by Browning which
connected Hearst to the Precita Street
apartment where the Harrises were liv
ing at the time of their capture by the
FBI.
"There is no connection between the
defendant and that apartment," Bailey
said.
Overruled
U.S. District Court Judge Oliver Car
ter overruled the objection on the
grounds that the prosecution is re
quired to illustrate the connection. "If
not, I will strike the evidence," Carter
added.
Two magazines found in the Precita
Street apartment — one on guns, the
other a U.S. Army Manual — con
tained Hearst's fingerprints.
Browning showed two films of the
bank robbery to illustrate the similar
ity between the weapons used in the
bank robbery and those found in the
Precita Street apartment. Witness
Robert W. Sibert, an FBI ballistics ex
pert, described in detail both sets of
weapons.
In his cross-examination of Sibert,

Bailey pointed out that Hearst's
weapon in the film resembled the
weapon in evidence which has a firing
defect.
Trigger sticks
Bailey demonstrated to the jury that
a defect in the gun presumably held by
Hearst causes the trigger to stick.
Bailey reminded the court that Hearst
looks down at her weapon during the
film of the hank robbery.
Browning disputed the importance
of the firing defect by illustrating that
the trigger did not stick every time it
was cocked, and by showing that a
person could overcome the difficulty
by hitting the side of the gun.
Outside the presence of the jury,
Carter refused to admit as evidence
two documents containing Hearst's
fingerprints which were found in a
Sacramento bank following a bank,
robbery. t
The prosecution called one docu
ment "a general laundry list of things
to do if one is going to rob a bank.''
Bailey objected to their admission
on the grounds that "fingerprints on a
document does not necessarily signify
authorship."
Browning is expected to wind up his
case tomorrow after an hour of tes
timony. Bailey will either call his first
witness — predicted to be Weed — or
he will accompany the jury on a field
trip to Hibernia Bank and the two
houses where Hearst was first held
captive.
