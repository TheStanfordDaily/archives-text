SAN SIMEON (AP) â€” A bomb blast
caused an estimated $1 million dam
age yesterday to a treasure-filled guest
house at the fabled Hearst Castle.
Hearst family members in San Fran
cisco denounced it as a terrorist act.
No one was injured by the explosion
that ripped a gaping hole in the wall,
but 53 tourists had passed through the
area just three minutes earlier, San
Luis Obispo County sheriff's deputies
said.
There was no indication that the
bombing was connected with the San
Francisco bank robbery trial of Patri
cian Hearst. No notes or telephone
calls claiming responsibility were re
ported by authorities.
Visibly shaken and angry, Randolph
and Catherine Hearst called the bomb
ing a terrorist act akin to the kidnaping
of their daughter.
Deputies said the bomb was made of
dynamite and a timer may have been
used. They said it tore a hole "wide
enough for two or three men to crawl
through" in the wall.
No one is in custody. The Califor
nia Highway Patrol stopped a woman
about 20 miles north of San Simeon
but released her after questioning.
Sheriff's officers questioned a busload
of tourists and others visiting the pala
tial estate built to house the burgeon
ing art collection of publishing mag
nate William Randolph Hearst, Pat
ricia's grandfather.
A Hearst family attorney initially
called for police protection for family
members, but Hearst later said he did
not want any special bodyguards.
However, a private review of security
arrangements at the Hearsts' Nob Hill
apartment wys planned.
The castle, on a hill overlooking the
Pacific Ocean about 45 miles north of
San Luis Obispo, was built by news
paper publisher William Randolph
Hearst and later donated to the state.
He filled the castle with ancient art
treasures and furniture from all over
the world, and the grounds include
plush gardens, a marble pool, Creek
temple, Italian statues and fountains.
Heads of nations were among the
guests who visited the estate, which
was not open to the public until 1958.
