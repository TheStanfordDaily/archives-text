"The power of the majority it
self is not unlimited. Above it in
the moral world are humanity,
justice and reason; and in the
political world, vested rights.
The majority recognizes these
two barriers; and if it now and
then oversteps them, it is be
cause, like individuals, it has
passions and, like them, it is
prone to do what is wrong, while
it discerns what is right. .
Theauthor of theabove, asany
political science major knows, is
Alexis de Tocqueville. His in
sight spans many decades and
many democracies in America,
including even the humble
ASSU Senate.
The observation is easily
applicable to the radical major
ity that this year controls that
body, which in its passion, has
once again trod on the rights of
the senate minority.
Tuesday night the debate was
on the question of hiring three
radicals — Angela Davis, Ernest
Mandel and Claude Steiner — as
guest professors spring quarter.
There was no objection, then or
now, from the minority in the
senate (namely the moderates,
conservatives and libertarians)
as to the qualifications of the
nominees.
Well-qualified
All are well-qualified. All will
teach excellent classes which are
likely to draw large numbers of
students. What, then, is the ob
jection?
Sens. Bob Ottilie, Kevin
McDermott and Carole Houck,
who voted against acceptance,
objected to the fact all three pro
fessors are of the same view
point. Why not attempt, they
asked, to strike a rough balance
within the criteria that assured
other views could be rep
resented?
Instead, the three nominees
represent only the range of view
shared by Sen. Bill Tyndall and
the others on the Cuest Profes
sorship Board — a narrow slice
of turf near the third-base foul
line on the proverbial baseball
field of political opinion.

Tyndall defended the Board's
position by saying the radical
view was underrepresented on
theStanford campus, something
all of us who observed the
numeous activities during "Dis
orientation Week" found just
mildly ludicrous. Further, he
said "there are hundreds of con
servative and liberal professors
on campus."
This prompted one senate ob
server to recall the time Rod
Hundley boasted how he and
Elgin Baylor combined for 50
points in one game— neglecting
to mention Baylor had 48.
Enjoy boasting
Similarly, Political Science
Prof. Robert Horn and French
Prof. Alphonse Julliand must
enjoy boasting that they are a
part of the hundreds of right
wing faculty members on the
campus and should be glad stu
dents will at long last be hearing
from the far left. After all, no one
enjoys fighting for seats at those
Conservative Forum meetings,
anyway.
The point is this; The Cuest
Professorship decision is
another example of the radical
majority's abuse of power and
failure to respect minority view
point. The majority injected
political bias into what should
have been a non-partisan selec
tion process.
Certainly it needs to be
pointed out that had Richard
Nixon accepted and been re
commended to speak the radi
cals and so-called "liberals" on
campus would have done every
thing they could to stop him —
proving as they have countless
times that the radical/liberal
view of free speech is "you can
say anything you want, so long
as we agree."
Indeed, anyone can be a guest
professor so long as there are
radicals like the majority of the
senate. Once again, objectivity,
respect for other viewpoints and
the student body as a whole,
comes out on the losing side.

shared by Sen. Bill Tyndall and
the others on the Cuest Profes
sorship Board — a narrow slice
of turf near the third-base foul
line on the proverbial baseball
field of political opinion.

Tyndall defended the Board's
position by saying the radical
view was underrepresented on
theStanford campus, something
all of us who observed the
numeous activities during "Dis
orientation Week" found just
mildly ludicrous. Further, he
said "there are hundreds of con
servative and liberal professors
on campus."
This prompted one senate ob
server to recall the time Rod
Hundley boasted how he and
Elgin Baylor combined for 50
points in one game— neglecting
to mention Baylor had 48.
Enjoy boasting
Similarly, Political Science
Prof. Robert Horn and French
Prof. Alphonse Julliand must
enjoy boasting that they are a
part of the hundreds of right
wing faculty members on the
campus and should be glad stu
dents will at long last be hearing
from the far left. After all, no one
enjoys fighting for seats at those
Conservative Forum meetings,
anyway.
The point is this; The Cuest
Professorship decision is
another example of the radical
majority's abuse of power and
failure to respect minority view
point. The majority injected
political bias into what should
have been a non-partisan selec
tion process.
Certainly it needs to be
pointed out that had Richard
Nixon accepted and been re
commended to speak the radi
cals and so-called "liberals" on
campus would have done every
thing they could to stop him —
proving as they have countless
times that the radical/liberal
view of free speech is "you can
say anything you want, so long
as we agree."
Indeed, anyone can be a guest
professor so long as there are
radicals like the majority of the
senate. Once again, objectivity,
respect for other viewpoints and
the student body as a whole,
comes out on the losing side.
