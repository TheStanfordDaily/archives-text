essent ' al as profits are to the survival of our way of life, I know
Js A OIIIS of few subjects so universally misunderstood. And a recent
W WfcV nationwide survey indicated that misconceptions about profits
■Hw Jk Ul are increasing. Obviously, business is not getting the message
through. The time is long overdue for some old-fashioned
A plain talk.
By putting profits to work, companies build new factories,
modernize existing facilities, enable Americans to compete with
manufacturers abroad and—most critical—create jobs for our
people and opportunities for future generations. The company
that doesn't make a consistent profit year in and year out withers
and disappears, and so do the jobs of its employees.
Most experts agree that our economy will need at least $4
trillion in new capital during the next 10 years. Unless we plan
to convert to socialism—and we certainly don't want to do that—
a good part of it will have to come from corporate profits. Yet,
contrary to what most Americans think, corporate profits
have been shrinking. Today, the rate of profit by U.S. corpora
tions is about 5% on sales, less than it was a decade ago. If
profitability continues to shrink, we can look forward to an era
of diminished economic growth and fewer jobs.
And when there is less profit to tax, our federal, state and local
governments cannot obtain the revenues needed to carry out
public programs, and the goals we have set for our society will
be seriously threatened.
SOur company—Allied Chemical—is a good example of profits at
work. From 1970 to 1974, we earned net profits of $436 million
and plowed back $258 million into business expansion and
job-creating activities. That's about 62c of every dollar we earn.
But this creative reinvestment of profits is only part of the story.
Businesses that are profitable provide much of the support for
public spending. During this same period, our company paid
more than $382 million in taxes. Our employees paid
taxes from their wages, and our stockholders paid taxes on
their dividends. So, profits are continually recycled for
During the next few months we will be talking publicly about
corporate profits because we are convinced that an under
standing of this subject by our people is vital to protect America's
quality of life. We invite you to read these messages and to
let us know how you feel about our viewpoint.
