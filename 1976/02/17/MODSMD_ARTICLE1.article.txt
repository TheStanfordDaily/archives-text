# Hearst testimony attracts wide interest

### Ron Beck 
SAN FRANCISCO — A wave of ex
citement rippled through the Federal
District Courtroom of Judge Oliver
Carter. Friday, as defense attorney F. i
Lee Bailey called "Patricia Campbell ,
Hearst to the stand."
The appearance of the heiress—
turned urban guerilla turned innocent
victim — sent reporters from all over
the world scurrying to telephones.
Within minutes, worldwide news re
ports announced that one of the most
celebrated defendants in legal history
was testifying on her own behalf.
Led by Bailey's intensive question
ing. Hearst described the initial days of
her kidnaping ordeal to the 12-
member jury and the 200 spectators
that packed the courtroom. Fighting
back tears and stopping in order to
maintain her composure, she started
another segment of what has been
termed "the trial of the century."
Although it might not be the trial of
the century in terms of importance, it
may well be the most heavily pub
licized and fully-reported trial ever.
Correspondents representing over 60
different news outlets attend the trial
each day in order to keep trial watch
ers, hungry for Hearst news, informed
of every detail.
Worldwide coverage
Newspapermen from as far away as
West Germany and England sit
alongside wire-service correspon
dents and local reporters in the front
rows of the courtroom. Behind the
press section, 65 spectators who have
waited since early morning are permit
ted to sit and watch a few hours of the
proceedings.
Everyone is there to see Hearst. Sit
ting expressionlessly at the defense
table in full view of the judge and jury.
Hearst looks gaunt and frail. No longer
does she appear to be the armed robber
at the Hibernia Bank or the glorified
fugitive who raised her arm defiantly
shortly after being arrested.
Hearst has undergone her second
radical change in two years. Her sworn
testimony to the jury indicates a rever
sion back to her pre-kidnap days, yet
prosecuting attorney James Browning
spent the last two weeks explaining a
different side.
Prosecution ends case
Browning rested the prosecution's
case Friday, after emphasizing the
opinion that Hearst's involvement in
the Hibernia Bank robbery was volun
tary. To bolster the prosecution's case,
Browning presented eyewitnesses of
Hearst's behavior who testified of her
complicity in the robbery and in later
actions.
The Symbionese Liberation Army
(SLA) tape on which Hearst — then
known as Tania —claims credit for the
robbery was played for the jury.
Browning said that the most com
pelling evidence showing Hearst's
willingness in the hold-up is the film
of the bank robbery which was shown
to the jury in slow motion earlier in the
trial.
"I think looking at the motion pic
tures might well cause a reasonable
person to believe that there was an
element of willfulness," he said.
Prima facie case
Browning told reporters that he felt
the "government has proved a prima

facie case of bank robbery."
"1 think, the evidence will show that
she was a legitimate kidnap victim but
that she changed her sympathies and
decided to throw in with her kidnapers
and rob the bank." he said.
Bailey opened the defense's case
Friday by presenting five eyewitnesses
to Hearst's kidnaping on the night of
Feb. 4. 1974. Kach witness testified
that Hearst was taken involuntarily
from her Berkeley apartment by at least
three persons, now identified as SLA
members.
YVeed not called
Hearst's fiance at the time. Steven
Weed, was scheduled to appear as a
witness next. but. according to the San
Francisco Examiner, he was not called
to the witness stand due to an argu
ment with Bailey's associate counsel.
A 1 Johnson.
Instead. Hearst was called to the
stand to testify before the seven
woman. Five-man jury for the first
time. Hearst testified in court last
Monday, but the jury was not present.
She told of being hit by a gun-butt
outside her apartment, and of other
physical punishment to which she was
subjected. Testifying that she was
forced into a small closet in the SLA
apartment, Hearst said that she re
membered the kidnap case of Barbara
lean Mackle in Florida.
"They put her in a box and buried
her." Hearst said. "1 was afraid they
were going to do that to me."
Constant threat
Her testimony often included ac
counts of death threats from Donald
DeFreeze (Cinque) and other SLA
members. Bailey led her all the way up
to the first SLA tape after the kidnap
ing.
The tape was then played for the jury
and afterwards Bailey continued ques
tioning Hearst.
Bailey asked her whether DeFreeze
was pleased or displeased with her
performance.
"He came over to me." Hearst said,
"and said he heard from some of tin?
sisters — the women there — and he
said, i heard from some of the sisters
that you were not cooperating,' and
that 1 better not do that anvmore."

Dropping Out?
No, stopping out. See p. 3

"What happened then?" asked
Bailey.
"He pinched me." Hearst said while
crying.
"Where?"
"My breasts and down . . ."
"Your private parts as well?"
"Yes." 1
Bailey then stopped the questioning
and the court recessed until today
when Hearst will continue her tes
timony.
Yesterday, the jurors and Hearst
were taken to see two apartments
where the SLA held her captive. Ac
cording to Johnson, Hearst "cried and
sobbed" when she saw the closet in
which she claims she had been locked
for a month.

she was a legitimate kidnap victim but
that she changed her sympathies and
decided to throw in with her kidnapers
and rob the bank." he said.
Bailey opened the defense's case
Friday by presenting five eyewitnesses
to Hearst's kidnaping on the night of
Feb. 4. 1974. Kach witness testified
that Hearst was taken involuntarily
from her Berkeley apartment by at least
three persons, now identified as SLA
members.
YVeed not called
Hearst's fiance at the time. Steven
Weed, was scheduled to appear as a
witness next. but. according to the San
Francisco Examiner, he was not called
to the witness stand due to an argu
ment with Bailey's associate counsel.
A 1 Johnson.
Instead. Hearst was called to the
stand to testify before the seven
woman. Five-man jury for the first
time. Hearst testified in court last
Monday, but the jury was not present.
She told of being hit by a gun-butt
outside her apartment, and of other
physical punishment to which she was
subjected. Testifying that she was
forced into a small closet in the SLA
apartment, Hearst said that she re
membered the kidnap case of Barbara
lean Mackle in Florida.
"They put her in a box and buried
her." Hearst said. "1 was afraid they
were going to do that to me."
Constant threat
Her testimony often included ac
counts of death threats from Donald
DeFreeze (Cinque) and other SLA
members. Bailey led her all the way up
to the first SLA tape after the kidnap
ing.
The tape was then played for the jury
and afterwards Bailey continued ques
tioning Hearst.
Bailey asked her whether DeFreeze
was pleased or displeased with her
performance.
"He came over to me." Hearst said,
"and said he heard from some of tin?
sisters — the women there — and he
said, i heard from some of the sisters
that you were not cooperating,' and
that 1 better not do that anvmore."

Dropping Out?
No, stopping out. See p. 3

"What happened then?" asked
Bailey.
"He pinched me." Hearst said while
crying.
"Where?"
"My breasts and down . . ."
"Your private parts as well?"
"Yes." 1
Bailey then stopped the questioning
and the court recessed until today
when Hearst will continue her tes
timony.
Yesterday, the jurors and Hearst
were taken to see two apartments
where the SLA held her captive. Ac
cording to Johnson, Hearst "cried and
sobbed" when she saw the closet in
which she claims she had been locked
for a month.

SAN FRANCISCO — A wave of ex
citement rippled through the Federal
District Courtroom of Judge Oliver
Carter. Friday, as defense attorney F. i
Lee Bailey called "Patricia Campbell ,
Hearst to the stand."
The appearance of the heiress—
turned urban guerilla turned innocent
victim — sent reporters from all over
the world scurrying to telephones.
Within minutes, worldwide news re
ports announced that one of the most
celebrated defendants in legal history
was testifying on her own behalf.
Led by Bailey's intensive question
ing. Hearst described the initial days of
her kidnaping ordeal to the 12-
member jury and the 200 spectators
that packed the courtroom. Fighting
back tears and stopping in order to
maintain her composure, she started
another segment of what has been
termed "the trial of the century."
Although it might not be the trial of
the century in terms of importance, it
may well be the most heavily pub
licized and fully-reported trial ever.
Correspondents representing over 60
different news outlets attend the trial
each day in order to keep trial watch
ers, hungry for Hearst news, informed
of every detail.
Worldwide coverage
Newspapermen from as far away as
West Germany and England sit
alongside wire-service correspon
dents and local reporters in the front
rows of the courtroom. Behind the
press section, 65 spectators who have
waited since early morning are permit
ted to sit and watch a few hours of the
proceedings.
Everyone is there to see Hearst. Sit
ting expressionlessly at the defense
table in full view of the judge and jury.
Hearst looks gaunt and frail. No longer
does she appear to be the armed robber
at the Hibernia Bank or the glorified
fugitive who raised her arm defiantly
shortly after being arrested.
Hearst has undergone her second
radical change in two years. Her sworn
testimony to the jury indicates a rever
sion back to her pre-kidnap days, yet
prosecuting attorney James Browning
spent the last two weeks explaining a
different side.
Prosecution ends case
Browning rested the prosecution's
case Friday, after emphasizing the
opinion that Hearst's involvement in
the Hibernia Bank robbery was volun
tary. To bolster the prosecution's case,
Browning presented eyewitnesses of
Hearst's behavior who testified of her
complicity in the robbery and in later
actions.
The Symbionese Liberation Army
(SLA) tape on which Hearst — then
known as Tania —claims credit for the
robbery was played for the jury.
Browning said that the most com
pelling evidence showing Hearst's
willingness in the hold-up is the film
of the bank robbery which was shown
to the jury in slow motion earlier in the
trial.
"I think looking at the motion pic
tures might well cause a reasonable
person to believe that there was an
element of willfulness," he said.
Prima facie case
Browning told reporters that he felt
the "government has proved a prima

facie case of bank robbery."
"1 think, the evidence will show that
she was a legitimate kidnap victim but
that she changed her sympathies and
decided to throw in with her kidnapers

Carter. Friday, as defense attorney F. i
Lee Bailey called "Patricia Campbell ,
Hearst to the stand."
The appearance of the heiress—
turned urban guerilla turned innocent
victim — sent reporters from all over
the world scurrying to telephones.
Within minutes, worldwide news re
ports announced that one of the most
celebrated defendants in legal history
was testifying on her own behalf.
Led by Bailey's intensive question
ing. Hearst described the initial days of
her kidnaping ordeal to the 12-
member jury and the 200 spectators
that packed the courtroom. Fighting
back tears and stopping in order to
maintain her composure, she started
another segment of what has been
termed "the trial of the century."
Although it might not be the trial of
the century in terms of importance, it
may well be the most heavily pub
licized and fully-reported trial ever.
Correspondents representing over 60
different news outlets attend the trial
each day in order to keep trial watch
ers, hungry for Hearst news, informed
of every detail.
Worldwide coverage
Newspapermen from as far away as
West Germany and England sit
alongside wire-service correspon
dents and local reporters in the front
rows of the courtroom. Behind the
press section, 65 spectators who have
waited since early morning are permit
ted to sit and watch a few hours of the
proceedings.
Everyone is there to see Hearst. Sit
ting expressionlessly at the defense
table in full view of the judge and jury.
Hearst looks gaunt and frail. No longer
does she appear to be the armed robber
at the Hibernia Bank or the glorified
fugitive who raised her arm defiantly
shortly after being arrested.
Hearst has undergone her second
radical change in two years. Her sworn
testimony to the jury indicates a rever
sion back to her pre-kidnap days, yet
prosecuting attorney James Browning
spent the last two weeks explaining a
different side.
Prosecution ends case
Browning rested the prosecution's
case Friday, after emphasizing the
opinion that Hearst's involvement in
the Hibernia Bank robbery was volun
tary. To bolster the prosecution's case,
Browning presented eyewitnesses of
Hearst's behavior who testified of her
complicity in the robbery and in later
actions.
The Symbionese Liberation Army
(SLA) tape on which Hearst — then
known as Tania —claims credit for the
robbery was played for the jury.
Browning said that the most com
pelling evidence showing Hearst's
willingness in the hold-up is the film
of the bank robbery which was shown
to the jury in slow motion earlier in the
trial.
"I think looking at the motion pic
tures might well cause a reasonable
person to believe that there was an
element of willfulness," he said.
Prima facie case
Browning told reporters that he felt
the "government has proved a prima

facie case of bank robbery."
"1 think, the evidence will show that
she was a legitimate kidnap victim but
that she changed her sympathies and
decided to throw in with her kidnapers
and rob the bank." he said.
Bailey opened the defense's case
Friday by presenting five eyewitnesses
to Hearst's kidnaping on the night of
Feb. 4. 1974. Kach witness testified
that Hearst was taken involuntarily
from her Berkeley apartment by at least
three persons, now identified as SLA
members.
YVeed not called
Hearst's fiance at the time. Steven
Weed, was scheduled to appear as a
witness next. but. according to the San
Francisco Examiner, he was not called
to the witness stand due to an argu
ment with Bailey's associate counsel.
A 1 Johnson.
Instead. Hearst was called to the
stand to testify before the seven
woman. Five-man jury for the first
time. Hearst testified in court last
Monday, but the jury was not present.
She told of being hit by a gun-butt
outside her apartment, and of other
physical punishment to which she was
subjected. Testifying that she was
forced into a small closet in the SLA
apartment, Hearst said that she re
membered the kidnap case of Barbara
lean Mackle in Florida.
"They put her in a box and buried
her." Hearst said. "1 was afraid they
were going to do that to me."
Constant threat
Her testimony often included ac
counts of death threats from Donald
DeFreeze (Cinque) and other SLA
members. Bailey led her all the way up
to the first SLA tape after the kidnap
ing.
The tape was then played for the jury
and afterwards Bailey continued ques
tioning Hearst.
Bailey asked her whether DeFreeze
was pleased or displeased with her
performance.
"He came over to me." Hearst said,
"and said he heard from some of tin?
sisters — the women there — and he
said, i heard from some of the sisters
that you were not cooperating,' and
that 1 better not do that anvmore."

Dropping Out?
No, stopping out. See p. 3

"What happened then?" asked
Bailey.
"He pinched me." Hearst said while
crying.
"Where?"
"My breasts and down . . ."
"Your private parts as well?"
"Yes." 1
Bailey then stopped the questioning
and the court recessed until today
when Hearst will continue her tes
timony.
Yesterday, the jurors and Hearst
were taken to see two apartments
where the SLA held her captive. Ac
cording to Johnson, Hearst "cried and
sobbed" when she saw the closet in
which she claims she had been locked
for a month.
