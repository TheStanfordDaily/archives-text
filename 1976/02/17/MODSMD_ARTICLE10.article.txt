# Guest profs not students' choice
## 
### 
It appears that the ASSU Senate, in select
ing its three candidates for guest professor
ship at Stanford, is again neglecting the de
sires of the broad spectrum of students. The
selection as guest professors of three radi
cals, Angela Davis, Ernest Mandel and
Claude Steiner, was biased and reflects the
domination of the senate by a small radical
elite.
Members of Students Taking a New Di
rection (STAND) assert the list from which
the candidates were selected was balanced
and, therefore, the selection was unbiased.
Questionable logic aside, a knowlegable
source within the ASSU Guest Professor
ship Board indicates the Board, while ad
vertising in the Daily and other public
sources, did not solicit outside organiza
tions to get candidates representing a broad
spectrum of views and disciplines.
What the committee did do, said this
source, was to ask senators to submit names
from their "constituents." Presumably, for
members of STAND, that means either
themselves or the radical elite they repre
sent.
Disproportionate number
Investigation indicates that the list of 36
names initially drawn up by the committee
does indeed contain a disproportionate
number of people known for their radical
views. And if the committee were unbiased,
then the question arises of how the senate
managed to select three radical social com
mentators from what would be a politically

and academically balanced list.
The lame response to these charges was
made by Sen. Bill Tvndall when he said
these nominees "still won't balance hun
dreds ot conservative and liberal professors
on the campus."
Tyndall and his radical allies, however,
appear to be the only ones complaining
about the faculty. Most students seem satis-

fied the faculty represents an even broader
spectrum than the students themslves, from
conservative to radical.
STAND members will undoubtedly assert
they are only representing the will of the
students, because they were voted into of
fice.
This is a questionable argument because
STAND'S disproportionate strength in the
Spnate was caused by an electoral fluke.
Although no member of STAND got more
than 3 75 votes in the ASSU elections last
faII.STAND is able to command the votes of

14 d 1 the 20 senators on most issues — in
cluding the votes of nine graduate students
who received no more than 7fi votes apiece.
Narrow base
This narrow political base hardly gives
ST AND a ma nda te to ra di ca 1 ize th e ca mp us;
yet, this is what it is trying to do, partially
through the selection of these guest profes
sors.
The selection of Davis. Mandel and
Steiner represents a blatant disregard for
the wishes of the overwhelming majority of
students. Most students would like to see
ASSU money spent for things which they
couldn't care less about, perhaps even
abhor.
This disregard for student opinion is just
another example of STAND'S abdication of
its responsibility to the people, especially to
non-radicals. STAND appears to be content
catering to the whims of the radical elite
that put it into office.
The University administration should do
everything it can to block the appointment
of these guest professors, since their selec
tion was biased and will not benefit the stu
dent body — particularly those who do not
want to study Marxism. And the administ
ration should continue to fight the radical
elite which dominates the senate until
STAND broadens its programs to reflect
student needs and desires.

ship Board indicates the Board, while ad
vertising in the Daily and other public
sources, did not solicit outside organiza
tions to get candidates representing a broad
spectrum of views and disciplines.
What the committee did do, said this
source, was to ask senators to submit names
from their "constituents." Presumably, for
members of STAND, that means either
themselves or the radical elite they repre
sent.
Disproportionate number
Investigation indicates that the list of 36
names initially drawn up by the committee
does indeed contain a disproportionate
number of people known for their radical
views. And if the committee were unbiased,
then the question arises of how the senate
managed to select three radical social com
mentators from what would be a politically

and academically balanced list.
The lame response to these charges was
made by Sen. Bill Tvndall when he said
these nominees "still won't balance hun
dreds ot conservative and liberal professors
on the campus."
Tyndall and his radical allies, however,
appear to be the only ones complaining
about the faculty. Most students seem satis-

fied the faculty represents an even broader
spectrum than the students themslves, from
conservative to radical.
STAND members will undoubtedly assert
they are only representing the will of the
students, because they were voted into of
fice.
This is a questionable argument because
STAND'S disproportionate strength in the
Spnate was caused by an electoral fluke.
Although no member of STAND got more
than 3 75 votes in the ASSU elections last
faII.STAND is able to command the votes of

14 d 1 the 20 senators on most issues — in
cluding the votes of nine graduate students
who received no more than 7fi votes apiece.
Narrow base
This narrow political base hardly gives
ST AND a ma nda te to ra di ca 1 ize th e ca mp us;
yet, this is what it is trying to do, partially
through the selection of these guest profes
sors.
The selection of Davis. Mandel and
Steiner represents a blatant disregard for
the wishes of the overwhelming majority of
students. Most students would like to see
ASSU money spent for things which they
couldn't care less about, perhaps even
abhor.
This disregard for student opinion is just
another example of STAND'S abdication of
its responsibility to the people, especially to
non-radicals. STAND appears to be content
catering to the whims of the radical elite
that put it into office.
The University administration should do
everything it can to block the appointment
of these guest professors, since their selec
tion was biased and will not benefit the stu
dent body — particularly those who do not
want to study Marxism. And the administ
ration should continue to fight the radical
elite which dominates the senate until
STAND broadens its programs to reflect
student needs and desires.

It appears that the ASSU Senate, in select
ing its three candidates for guest professor
ship at Stanford, is again neglecting the de
sires of the broad spectrum of students. The
selection as guest professors of three radi
cals, Angela Davis, Ernest Mandel and
Claude Steiner, was biased and reflects the
domination of the senate by a small radical
elite.
Members of Students Taking a New Di
rection (STAND) assert the list from which
the candidates were selected was balanced
and, therefore, the selection was unbiased.
