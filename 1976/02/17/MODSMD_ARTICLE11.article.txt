I feel compelled to reply to
several charges made by ASSU
Senators Bob Ottilie and Barbara
Rizzardi in their Feb. 13 letter to
the Daily.
As a starter, the ASSU Senate
vote to approve the selections of
the ASSU Cuest Professor Board
was 12-3. Thus, even without the
votes of the five senators who ran
on the STAND slate, the margin
of support was greater than two
to-one.
The board made a strikingly
clear and logical presentation at
the senate meeting and endured
dull and repetitive questioning
with remarkable forbearance.
The only "joke" the board re
sembles is a fine epigram.
We senators were given a pre
cis for each of the nine candi
dates who responded favorably
to the board's inquiry: I. for one.
was satisfied by its decision.
A radical psychiatrist is
necessarily a radical in the same
way a civil libertarian is neces
sarily a libertarian — occasion
ally.
For better or worse, a large
portion of the world's popula
tion lives in countries which call
themselves Marxist. Stanford
has clearly and repeatedly un
derrepresented this viewpoint
on its faculty.
If one suffers from a defi
ciency. he does not seek a "ba
lanced" treatment. And let there
be no doubt the guest professor
ships are intended to comple
ment the existing curriculum.
Finally, I find it amusing that
the ideology of the STAND
members is called "five bodies,
one mind."
First, because any careful
examination of senate voting
patterns reveals how uncohe
sively STAND members have
voted on key issues And second,
because the charge is made by
Ottilie and Rizzardi. who are the
Henry and Clare Booth huce of
right-wing campus politics.

Josh's publicity
Editor:
Viae Kershner said some true

things in his column in the Feb.
9 Daily, but there is more to the
Christian faith than the fun
damentalist evangelicalism he
describes.
It is true all sin comes from
people, but there are also corpo
rate wrongs and evils in the so
cial framework that must be
dealt with by those who care
about quality of life. Intolerant
Christian groupsare of little help
and are embarassing to other
Christians who strive to be toler
ant and open.
Josh's publicity campaign
typifies a part of the revivalism
revival (of the prophets for pro
fit) that has adapted Madison
Avenue technique simply be
cause it works — everyone
knows "Josh is coming" now.
One remembers a message that
offends.
The trouble is sensationalism
ought not to be used to com
municate the gospel. Faith with
value is reasoned carefully and
is based on contentful state
ments; the emotional impact
comes after knowing, not before.
There is more variety in the
evangelical Christian faith than
the recent article in Campus Re
port would have us believe.
"Evangel" comes from a Creek
word meaning "good news" and
refers to the great reversal ac
complished by Jesus.
Evangelicals are those whose
hope and destiny rest on the fac
tual events of Jesus' life. It is not
at all necessary that this faith
shouid entail literal interpreta
tion of scripture, authoritarian
concepts of sex roles, or heavy
negative reaction to irregular
sexual behavior.

Student anxiety
Editor:
The Dec. 12 Daily article on
the lonely moments of students
at Stanford prompts me to make
a simple point. When a few
hours of anxiety, the dismay
concerning one's performance,
the anticipation and accom

panying worry about a test get to
rate first page coverage, then we
have come to a time of little seri
ous trouble in our community.
But what is one to expect
when Dr. Varda Canz ofCowell's
Counseling and Psychological
Service is concerned about such
things? We must pay heed,
musn't we?
Yet consider her brilliant
analysis: "There is more compet
ition at Stanford than there was
five years ago because students
are concerned about how they
are going to make it in the world
after they graduate." What, five
years ago they were not?
I have several friends who
went to Stanford, a decade
ago, and each recalls anxiety
attacks so severe he thought he'd
end it all right then and there.
But it was accepted then as one
of the natural obstacles one had

to meet in one's life.
And I have been at five diffe
rent colleges and universities in
the last 14 years, each of which
had students agonizing over
grades, tests, life. God and what
ever there has always been for
human beings of that age to
agonize about. These places in
cluded state colleges and prom
inent universities — yet no ap
preciable difference existed in
the matter of student moods.
We have come a long way to
ward Utopian thinking when the
anxieties of college life are
treated as major disasters. But 1
suppose that is one way for the
psychological profession to de
monstrate its success — by dis
covering more things to lament
about human mental life.

As a starter, the ASSU Senate
vote to approve the selections of
the ASSU Cuest Professor Board
was 12-3. Thus, even without the
votes of the five senators who ran
on the STAND slate, the margin
of support was greater than two
to-one.
The board made a strikingly
clear and logical presentation at
the senate meeting and endured
dull and repetitive questioning

The Dec. 12 Daily article on
the lonely moments of students
at Stanford prompts me to make
a simple point. When a few
hours of anxiety, the dismay
concerning one's performance,
the anticipation and accom

panying worry about a test get to
rate first page coverage, then we
have come to a time of little seri
ous trouble in our community.
But what is one to expect
when Dr. Varda Canz ofCowell's
Counseling and Psychological
Service is concerned about such
things? We must pay heed,
musn't we?
Yet consider her brilliant
analysis: "There is more compet
ition at Stanford than there was
five years ago because students
are concerned about how they
are going to make it in the world
after they graduate." What, five
years ago they were not?
I have several friends who
went to Stanford, a decade
ago, and each recalls anxiety
attacks so severe he thought he'd
end it all right then and there.
But it was accepted then as one
of the natural obstacles one had

to meet in one's life.
And I have been at five diffe
rent colleges and universities in
the last 14 years, each of which
had students agonizing over
grades, tests, life. God and what
ever there has always been for
human beings of that age to
agonize about. These places in
cluded state colleges and prom

preciable difference existed in
the matter of student moods.

I feel compelled to reply to
several charges made by ASSU
Senators Bob Ottilie and Barbara
Rizzardi in their Feb. 13 letter to
the Daily.
As a starter, the ASSU Senate
vote to approve the selections of
the ASSU Cuest Professor Board
was 12-3. Thus, even without the
votes of the five senators who ran
on the STAND slate, the margin
of support was greater than two
to-one.
The board made a strikingly
clear and logical presentation at
the senate meeting and endured
dull and repetitive questioning
with remarkable forbearance.
The only "joke" the board re
sembles is a fine epigram.
We senators were given a pre
cis for each of the nine candi
dates who responded favorably
to the board's inquiry: I. for one.
was satisfied by its decision.
A radical psychiatrist is
necessarily a radical in the same
way a civil libertarian is neces
sarily a libertarian — occasion
ally.
For better or worse, a large
portion of the world's popula
tion lives in countries which call
themselves Marxist. Stanford
has clearly and repeatedly un
derrepresented this viewpoint
on its faculty.
If one suffers from a defi
ciency. he does not seek a "ba
lanced" treatment. And let there
be no doubt the guest professor
ships are intended to comple
ment the existing curriculum.
Finally, I find it amusing that
the ideology of the STAND
members is called "five bodies,
one mind."
First, because any careful
examination of senate voting
patterns reveals how uncohe
sively STAND members have
voted on key issues And second,
because the charge is made by
Ottilie and Rizzardi. who are the
Henry and Clare Booth huce of
right-wing campus politics.

Josh's publicity
Editor:
Viae Kershner said some true

things in his column in the Feb.
9 Daily, but there is more to the
Christian faith than the fun
damentalist evangelicalism he
describes.
It is true all sin comes from
people, but there are also corpo
rate wrongs and evils in the so
cial framework that must be
dealt with by those who care
about quality of life. Intolerant
Christian groupsare of little help
and are embarassing to other
Christians who strive to be toler
ant and open.
Josh's publicity campaign
typifies a part of the revivalism
revival (of the prophets for pro
fit) that has adapted Madison
Avenue technique simply be
cause it works — everyone
knows "Josh is coming" now.
One remembers a message that
offends.
The trouble is sensationalism
ought not to be used to com
municate the gospel. Faith with
value is reasoned carefully and
is based on contentful state
ments; the emotional impact
comes after knowing, not before.
There is more variety in the
evangelical Christian faith than
the recent article in Campus Re
port would have us believe.
"Evangel" comes from a Creek
word meaning "good news" and
refers to the great reversal ac
complished by Jesus.
Evangelicals are those whose
hope and destiny rest on the fac
tual events of Jesus' life. It is not
at all necessary that this faith
shouid entail literal interpreta
tion of scripture, authoritarian
concepts of sex roles, or heavy
negative reaction to irregular
sexual behavior.

Student anxiety
Editor:
The Dec. 12 Daily article on
the lonely moments of students
at Stanford prompts me to make
a simple point. When a few
hours of anxiety, the dismay
concerning one's performance,
the anticipation and accom

panying worry about a test get to
rate first page coverage, then we
have come to a time of little seri
ous trouble in our community.
But what is one to expect
when Dr. Varda Canz ofCowell's
Counseling and Psychological
Service is concerned about such
things? We must pay heed,
musn't we?
Yet consider her brilliant
analysis: "There is more compet
ition at Stanford than there was
five years ago because students
are concerned about how they
are going to make it in the world
after they graduate." What, five
years ago they were not?
I have several friends who
went to Stanford, a decade
ago, and each recalls anxiety
attacks so severe he thought he'd
end it all right then and there.
But it was accepted then as one
of the natural obstacles one had

to meet in one's life.
And I have been at five diffe
rent colleges and universities in
the last 14 years, each of which
had students agonizing over
grades, tests, life. God and what
ever there has always been for
human beings of that age to
agonize about. These places in
