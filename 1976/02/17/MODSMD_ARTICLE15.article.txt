# Multinationals wield worldwide power

### Riv Weber 
"Multinational corporations
are bound to be around for a long
time," but they are not likely to
become all powerful and replace
governments, said Political Sci
ence Asst. Prof. Robert Keohane.
Keohane discussed the issue
of the "Politics of Multinational
Corporations" last Thursday
evening, as part of a lecture
series sponsored by the Under
graduate Economics Associa
tion.
Worries of a host government
about multinational corpora
tions were the first topics dis
cussed by Keohane. Explaining
that "under many cir
cumstances, the firm may be
very useful to the host com
pany," Keohane noted that mul
tinationals are usually
oligopolistic and wield the dan
gers of monopolistic powers.
Multinationals may threaten
the autonomy of a host govern
ment, Keohane continued, by br
inging in financial backing from
a home government. Such was
thecase with American power in
Chile and Cuba. A multinational
in a less-developed country may
change the direction of its
economy, making the host
country "dependent on an inter
national market with the multi
national firm as the liaison,"

said Keohane.
"The question of the status of
the host country is more elu
sive," Keohane continued.
"There is the concern that a gov
ernment which accepts a firm
may doom itself to a secondary
status," providing labor and
"becoming subservient."
There is a tende.ncy to admit
multinationals ur.jer certain
conditions. Keohane discussed
the relative bargaining power of
the multinationals and the host
governments. The determinants
ofthis power include "tin firm's
resources, tin: resources availa
ble to the government, and the
pattern of interdependence bet
ween the firm and the govern
ment."
There is a trend developing in
favor of the government and
against the firm, Keohane noted.
An example of this trend is the
international oil market.
There are also important im
plications for home govern
ments regarding the multina
tionals. In the case of American
firms, "over the last 3D years,
both sides have used the other
side. There has been a general
congruence of goals" of the firm
and the American government.
"Calls on the United States for
economic aid" have led to
"covert or overt influence bv the

American government over the
host country." An example cited
by Koehane was the ITT case in
Chile. "The U.S. government
uses multinational firms to
further its political objectives or
its international economic objec
tives," said Keohane. "Since the
firms are oligopolistic, they are
political actives, with control
over their environments," con
tinued Keohane. "They pose po
tential threats to the home gov

ernments and the host govern
ments."
The political implications of
multinational firms are great. "If
you have a powerfully en
trenched multinational firm,
moderately backed by the Un
ited States, expropriation of
the firm can cause the U.S. to
cut-off aid." This may push
struggling nations in the direc
tion of the Soviet Union,
Keohane explained.

firms are oligopolistic, they are
political actives, with control
over their environments," con
tinued Keohane. "They pose po
tential threats to the home gov

ernments and the host govern
ments."
The political implications of
multinational firms are great. "If
you have a powerfully en
trenched multinational firm,
moderately backed by the Un
ited States, expropriation of
the firm can cause the U.S. to
cut-off aid." This may push
struggling nations in the direc
tion of the Soviet Union,
Keohane explained.

"Multinational corporations
are bound to be around for a long
time," but they are not likely to
become all powerful and replace
governments, said Political Sci
ence Asst. Prof. Robert Keohane.
Keohane discussed the issue
of the "Politics of Multinational
Corporations" last Thursday
evening, as part of a lecture
series sponsored by the Under
graduate Economics Associa
tion.
Worries of a host government
about multinational corpora
tions were the first topics dis
cussed by Keohane. Explaining
that "under many cir
cumstances, the firm may be
very useful to the host com
pany," Keohane noted that mul
tinationals are usually
oligopolistic and wield the dan
gers of monopolistic powers.
Multinationals may threaten
the autonomy of a host govern
ment, Keohane continued, by br
inging in financial backing from
a home government. Such was
thecase with American power in
Chile and Cuba. A multinational
in a less-developed country may
change the direction of its
economy, making the host
country "dependent on an inter
national market with the multi
national firm as the liaison,"

said Keohane.
"The question of the status of
the host country is more elu
sive," Keohane continued.
"There is the concern that a gov
ernment which accepts a firm
may doom itself to a secondary
status," providing labor and
"becoming subservient."
There is a tende.ncy to admit
multinationals ur.jer certain
conditions. Keohane discussed
the relative bargaining power of
the multinationals and the host
governments. The determinants
ofthis power include "tin firm's
resources, tin: resources availa
ble to the government, and the
pattern of interdependence bet
ween the firm and the govern
ment."
There is a trend developing in
favor of the government and
against the firm, Keohane noted.
An example of this trend is the
international oil market.
There are also important im
plications for home govern
ments regarding the multina
tionals. In the case of American
firms, "over the last 3D years,
both sides have used the other
side. There has been a general
congruence of goals" of the firm
and the American government.
"Calls on the United States for
economic aid" have led to
"covert or overt influence bv the

American government over the
host country." An example cited
by Koehane was the ITT case in
Chile. "The U.S. government
uses multinational firms to
further its political objectives or
its international economic objec
tives," said Keohane. "Since the
firms are oligopolistic, they are
political actives, with control
over their environments," con
tinued Keohane. "They pose po
tential threats to the home gov

ernments and the host govern
