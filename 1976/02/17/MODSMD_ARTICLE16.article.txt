# Is 'Stopping-Out' OK?
## 
### Riv Weber 
Dissatisfied with the conven
tional four year college educa
tion, about 25 percent of each
Stanford class chooses to "stop
out".
Recognizing this increasing
desire to take a quarter or two off
from Stanford, SCIRE has re
cently published a booklet exp
laining the how-to's of
stopping-out.
Among the reasons cited for
stopping-out are financial con
cerns, career-testing oppor
tunities and a need to clarify
education objectives.
One student explained, "As 1
was aware of my lack of motiva
tion for learning, for taking ad
vantage of the opportunities pre
sented at Stanford, it was very
frustrating to be at school,
spending so much money for

something 1 wasn't getting as
much out of as 1 knew 1 could."
Students contemplating the
stopping out option can turn to
peer counselors or the CPHC
counselors in the Office of the
Dean of Student Affairs, or the
staff of Counseling and
Psychological Services for assis
tance.
The SCIRE booklet also con
siders the question of which
quarter to stop-out. "By t,iking
off Spring or Fall quarters you
can have a full six months away
with minimum disruption to
your academic program or social
life."
In the "how to" segments of
the booklet, registration housing
and financial aid resultants of
stopping out are discussed.
"If you are currently enrolled
at Stanford and want to stop out

next quarter, simply don't pre
register or register." (tie booklet
explains.
Stop-outs do face problems in
receiving on-campus housing.
"Students who make spur of the
moment decisions risk losing .1
guaranteed year: tor example, it
you entered theSpring Draw and
received an assignment and then
stopped out. you would lose that
guaranteed year on campus."
As Stanford scholarships are
determined on a yearly basis, "a
leave of absence does not negate
financial aid from tin; Univer
sity."
Stop out booklets are available
at the Career Planning and
Placement Center SCIRE and the
Office of the Dean of Student Af
fairs.
