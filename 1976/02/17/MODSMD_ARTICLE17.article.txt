# Costs of extraction, not supply, limits raw materials

WASHINGTON (AP) — The
problem with getting enough
raw materials is the cost of ex
tracting them, not that supplies
are running out, a group of ex
perts has concluded.
The availability of raw mate
rials was discussed last Thurs
day by experts'in materials and
energy brought together by the
American Association for the
Advancement of Science
(AAAS).
The specialists, drawn from
government, universities and
industry, said the ground rules
for getting adequate supplies ol
raw materials had changed in
the last five years.
Availability of raw materials
— including the metals, miner
als, forest products, chemicals
and fossil fuels essential to in
dustrial societies — can no
longer be taken lor granted, they
said.
However, the experts, con
tributors to a special materials
issue of the AAAS journal. Sci
ence, said better planning and
the use of technology could les
sen the effects of future prob
lems.
"Whileat Ibis moment there is

no immediate crisis, mostly be
cause of the world recession, we i
can expect increased pressure on' t
materials when the economic t
situation gets better," Philip U. (
Abelson, the editor of Science, I
said in summing up the con- I
tributors' conclusions.
"And you really can't waii to
the last minute to do something
about it if you're going to havean
orderly economy." he con
tinued.
Dr. Earl Cook, dean of geosci
ences at Texas A&M University,
said at the briefing that tlit; dis
appearance of raw materials was
not the problem many people
made it to be.
"I don't think we'll really run
out of materials," Cook said,
"but we may run out of resources
because we'll come to a point
where the cost of e\tr.ictingthem
will not be worth the benefits ol
doing so."
Cook said the costs in energy
were the major limits in getting
raw materials These costs in
clude the price of fuels and the
actual physical energy required
to get at hard to reach sir plies,
both of which are limiting fac
tors. he said.

Cook said most of the mate
rials used today come from rela
tively small pockets in the
earth's crust called geochemical
concentrations. When these are
tapped out. man will have to use
less-rich sources.
