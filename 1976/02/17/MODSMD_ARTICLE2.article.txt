### Paige Cherno 
The Soviet Union's "massive com
mitment" to the Popular Movement for
the Liberation of Angola (MPLA)
prompted United States intervention
4 in Angola, according to William
Schaufele, assistant secretary of state
for African affairs.
"We ourselves have no aspirations
in Angola." Schaufele told an audi
ence of about 300 persons at the after
noon session of an all-day symposium
on Angola held here Saturday.
Schaufele's half-hour address on the
United States' Angolan policy and the
panel discussion following climaxed
the conference sponsored by the Afri
can Studies Committee and the Afri
can and Afro-American Under
graduate Studies Program.
Schaufele said the State Depart
ment's primary consideration is that
"neither the United States nor the
Soviet Union be in a position to domi
nate any state in Africa."
Schaufele stressed the "United
States — Soviet dimension" of the An
golan situation. "Most African states
count on a balance between the Soviet
pinion and the United States and won
der if the United States can be counted
on to provide the balance in case of
Soviet intervention in Africa." he
maintained.
Great powers
"Had there been no great power in
tervention. the Angola problem would
have been solved." Schaufele said.
"The fighting never would have taken
on the proportions that it has. regard
less of the existence of the three (inter
nal) liberation movements," headded.
Schaufele said the United States first
gave financial assistance to the Na
tional Front for the Liberation of An
gola (FNLA) in January, 1975, for
"political activities." He claimed the
funds were spent on "office equip

ment, bicycles and other things
needed to set up a political organiza
tion."
The United States first sent military
aid to FNLA and National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) forces in July. 1975, accord
ing to Schaufele.
He said the United States had turned
down one request when the Soviet
Union delivered arms to the MPLA.
but did respond in July, after the
March MPLA offensive proved
"damaging" to the FNLA and UNITA
and drove them both out of Luanda.
Angola's capital.
American aid
Schaufele said American aid has
been in "no way comparable to Soviet
assistance in magnitude."
He also said that "we weren't sup
porting the victory of one (liberation
movement) over another," but rather a
"coalition" government of all three, as
originally recommended by the Or
ganization of African Unity (OAU) in
the summer of 1975.
"It is reasonable to assume the
Soviet Union misunderstood U.S. in
tentions," John Marcum, provost of
Merrill College at UC-Santa Cruz, said
during his Five-minute rebuttal period.
"We erred in not assuring (the
Soviet Union) that we were seeking a
coalition government," he said.
Marcum, who delivered the keynote
address earlier in the day. also said
that international organizations "have
been singularly neglected in this
whole crisis."
Diplomatic analysis
Tetteh Kofi, assistant professor in
the Food Research Institute, said
Schaufele's "analysis was very dip
lomatic, but ahistorical."

States aid in restoring order in the
Congo in the early sixties, saying they
preferred "independence" to U.S. in
volvement.
"Why is it that the U.S. cannot sup
port African nationalism?" he asked
Schaufele. Schaufele responded. "The
United States does back African
nationalism. That's one of the reasons
we oppose the Soviet Union in An
gola."
"The MFLA is the only group that
has stood up for African nationalism."
Koti said, "and 1 believe they will
win."
Ibrahim Fall, a UC-Barkeley
graduate student who earlier spoke on
reactions of other African states to the
Angolan situation, criticized Ameri
can emphasis on the balance of power
question.
"There has been a lack of under
standing of what African politics are
about." Fall said. "Americans have not
been willing to learn what has been
going on there."

—Asst. Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy. who discussed the
economic dominance of South Africa
in southern Africa, especially over
land-locked states, its position as an

the Angolan conflict becoming a "pre
lude to a larger conflict over South Af
rica."
—Washington Post reporter Leon
Dash, who lived for 10 weeks with
UNITA troops and showed slides from

coalition."

that Atrican leaders wanted United
States aid in restoring order in the
Congo in the early sixties, saying they
preferred "independence" to U.S. in
volvement.
"Why is it that the U.S. cannot sup
port African nationalism?" he asked
Schaufele. Schaufele responded. "The
United States does back African
nationalism. That's one of the reasons
we oppose the Soviet Union in An
gola."
"The MFLA is the only group that
has stood up for African nationalism."
Koti said, "and 1 believe they will
win."
Ibrahim Fall, a UC-Barkeley
graduate student who earlier spoke on
reactions of other African states to the
Angolan situation, criticized Ameri
can emphasis on the balance of power
question.
"There has been a lack of under
standing of what African politics are
about." Fall said. "Americans have not
been willing to learn what has been
going on there."
Other speakers
Speakers earlier in the day included:
—UCLA Political Science Prof.
Gerald Bender, who said the State De

partment chose a military policy of in
tervention despite its African bureau's
preference for diplomatic tactics and
has chosen to ignore MPLA offers to
negotiateat "any time, any place."
—Asst. Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy. who discussed the
economic dominance of South Africa
in southern Africa, especially over
land-locked states, its position as an
"international pariah" because of its
apartheid policy and the possibility of
the Angolan conflict becoming a "pre
lude to a larger conflict over South Af
rica."
—Washington Post reporter Leon
Dash, who lived for 10 weeks with
UNITA troops and showed slides from
his visit and said that the "real battle
all three movements will have to fight
is the battle for the minds of the Ango
lans." and he said he doubts that "tri
bal enmity can be overcome to allow a
coalition."
—Lewis C.ann. deputy curator of the
Hoover Institution's African collec
tion. who spoke on Portuguese colo
nial policy in Angola, and predicted
that "Cuban intervention (for the
MPLA) is likely to bring about a
change in the balance of power in the
world."
The Soviet Union's "massive com
mitment" to the Popular Movement for
the Liberation of Angola (MPLA)
prompted United States intervention
4 in Angola, according to William
Schaufele, assistant secretary of state
for African affairs.
"We ourselves have no aspirations
in Angola." Schaufele told an audi
ence of about 300 persons at the after
noon session of an all-day symposium
on Angola held here Saturday.
Schaufele's half-hour address on the
United States' Angolan policy and the
panel discussion following climaxed
the conference sponsored by the Afri
can Studies Committee and the Afri
can and Afro-American Under
graduate Studies Program.
Schaufele said the State Depart
ment's primary consideration is that
"neither the United States nor the
Soviet Union be in a position to domi
nate any state in Africa."
Schaufele stressed the "United
States — Soviet dimension" of the An
golan situation. "Most African states
count on a balance between the Soviet
pinion and the United States and won
der if the United States can be counted
on to provide the balance in case of
Soviet intervention in Africa." he
maintained.
Great powers
"Had there been no great power in
tervention. the Angola problem would
have been solved." Schaufele said.
"The fighting never would have taken
on the proportions that it has. regard
less of the existence of the three (inter
nal) liberation movements," headded.
Schaufele said the United States first
gave financial assistance to the Na
tional Front for the Liberation of An
gola (FNLA) in January, 1975, for
"political activities." He claimed the
funds were spent on "office equip

ment, bicycles and other things
needed to set up a political organiza
tion."
The United States first sent military
aid to FNLA and National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) forces in July. 1975, accord
ing to Schaufele.
He said the United States had turned
down one request when the Soviet
Union delivered arms to the MPLA.
but did respond in July, after the
March MPLA offensive proved
"damaging" to the FNLA and UNITA
and drove them both out of Luanda.
Angola's capital.
American aid
Schaufele said American aid has
been in "no way comparable to Soviet
assistance in magnitude."
He also said that "we weren't sup
porting the victory of one (liberation
movement) over another," but rather a
"coalition" government of all three, as
originally recommended by the Or
ganization of African Unity (OAU) in
the summer of 1975.

—Lewis C.ann. deputy curator of the
Hoover Institution's African collec
tion. who spoke on Portuguese colo
nial policy in Angola, and predicted
that "Cuban intervention (for the
MPLA) is likely to bring about a
change in the balance of power in the
world."
The Soviet Union's "massive com
mitment" to the Popular Movement for
the Liberation of Angola (MPLA)
prompted United States intervention
4 in Angola, according to William
Schaufele, assistant secretary of state
for African affairs.
"We ourselves have no aspirations
in Angola." Schaufele told an audi
ence of about 300 persons at the after
noon session of an all-day symposium
on Angola held here Saturday.
Schaufele's half-hour address on the
United States' Angolan policy and the
panel discussion following climaxed
the conference sponsored by the Afri
can Studies Committee and the Afri
can and Afro-American Under
graduate Studies Program.
Schaufele said the State Depart
ment's primary consideration is that
"neither the United States nor the
Soviet Union be in a position to domi
nate any state in Africa."
Schaufele stressed the "United
States — Soviet dimension" of the An
golan situation. "Most African states
count on a balance between the Soviet
pinion and the United States and won
der if the United States can be counted
on to provide the balance in case of
Soviet intervention in Africa." he
maintained.
Great powers
"Had there been no great power in
tervention. the Angola problem would
have been solved." Schaufele said.
"The fighting never would have taken
on the proportions that it has. regard
less of the existence of the three (inter
nal) liberation movements," headded.
Schaufele said the United States first
gave financial assistance to the Na
tional Front for the Liberation of An
gola (FNLA) in January, 1975, for
"political activities." He claimed the
funds were spent on "office equip

ment, bicycles and other things
needed to set up a political organiza
tion."
The United States first sent military
aid to FNLA and National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) forces in July. 1975, accord
ing to Schaufele.
He said the United States had turned
down one request when the Soviet
Union delivered arms to the MPLA.
but did respond in July, after the
March MPLA offensive proved
"damaging" to the FNLA and UNITA
and drove them both out of Luanda.
Angola's capital.
American aid
Schaufele said American aid has
been in "no way comparable to Soviet
assistance in magnitude."
He also said that "we weren't sup
porting the victory of one (liberation
movement) over another," but rather a
"coalition" government of all three, as
originally recommended by the Or
ganization of African Unity (OAU) in
the summer of 1975.
"It is reasonable to assume the
Soviet Union misunderstood U.S. in
tentions," John Marcum, provost of
Merrill College at UC-Santa Cruz, said
during his Five-minute rebuttal period.
"We erred in not assuring (the
Soviet Union) that we were seeking a
coalition government," he said.
Marcum, who delivered the keynote
address earlier in the day. also said
that international organizations "have
been singularly neglected in this
whole crisis."
Diplomatic analysis
Tetteh Kofi, assistant professor in
the Food Research Institute, said
Schaufele's "analysis was very dip
lomatic, but ahistorical."
He challenged Schaufele's assertion

States aid in restoring order in the
Congo in the early sixties, saying they
preferred "independence" to U.S. in
volvement.
"Why is it that the U.S. cannot sup
port African nationalism?" he asked
Schaufele. Schaufele responded. "The
United States does back African
nationalism. That's one of the reasons
we oppose the Soviet Union in An
gola."
"The MFLA is the only group that
has stood up for African nationalism."
Koti said, "and 1 believe they will
win."
Ibrahim Fall, a UC-Barkeley
graduate student who earlier spoke on
reactions of other African states to the
Angolan situation, criticized Ameri
can emphasis on the balance of power
question.
"There has been a lack of under
standing of what African politics are
about." Fall said. "Americans have not
been willing to learn what has been
going on there."
Other speakers
Speakers earlier in the day included:
—UCLA Political Science Prof.
Gerald Bender, who said the State De

partment chose a military policy of in
tervention despite its African bureau's
preference for diplomatic tactics and
has chosen to ignore MPLA offers to
negotiateat "any time, any place."
—Asst. Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy. who discussed the
economic dominance of South Africa
in southern Africa, especially over
land-locked states, its position as an
"international pariah" because of its
apartheid policy and the possibility of
the Angolan conflict becoming a "pre
lude to a larger conflict over South Af
rica."
—Washington Post reporter Leon
Dash, who lived for 10 weeks with
UNITA troops and showed slides from
his visit and said that the "real battle
all three movements will have to fight
is the battle for the minds of the Ango
