# What's up? A $50 million, Bicentennial theme park
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
Traveling on the Bayshore
Freeway in Santa Clara, you may
have wondered what those
billboards of Mugs Bunny ask
ing, "What's Up. I Joe?" are for.
They are the vanguard of a $50
million theme park now under
construction in Santa Clara by
the Marriott Corporation, called
Creat America.
Creat America's theme is the
history of America. Thus, its
opening in the Bicentennial year
is appropriate. It is emphasized
as a theme park to contrast with
an amusement park, which has
rides, but no overriding idea to
tie parts of the park with one rib
bon.
The park will immediately be
compared with Disneyland.
Admittedly, it has many facets
that the grandfather of all theme
parks has found successful, It is
divided into five areas —
Hometown Square, a recreation
of the rural American town of the
1920s (something like Milpitas
is today); Yukon Territory, a vis
ion of the Klondike during the
1890sGold Rush days, a kind of
a Last Frontierland; Yankee Har
bor, a 19th century New Kngland
fishing village; Orleans Place, a
recreation of the South before it
fell; and tin; Great Midwest
Livestock Exposition and
County Fair, a circus and mid
way circa 1901.
No expenses spared
Although some of those may
sound unoriginally familiar,
Marriott, sparing no expense,
has taken these ideas one step
further with many improve

ments over other amusement
parks, even Uncle Walt's. Many
authentic artisans and craftsmen
have been employed to de
monstrate their almost-forgotten
crafts in their own shops. In
cluded are candle-makers,
glassblowers. totem pole carvers
(now there's a lost art!). and
broom makers, among others.
The circus performers at the
park have been selected from a

town in Virginia that specializes
in rearing circus performers.
The rides, even though set in
the historical perspective of
their area, are as new as the Con
cede. The Sky Whirl is the
world's first triple Ferris Wheel;
Willard'.e Whizzer (named for the
president of the company, who
started it in 1927 with a
Washington root beer stand) is a
coaster ride that goes up to 45

m.p.h. on 70-degree turns, prac
tically guranteed to help you
lose your lunch: The Columbia is
a spectacular double-decker
carousel (merrv-go-round) with
more than 100 horses; and The
Turn of the Century is a
corkscrew roller coaster.
Leisure biggies
The rides were designed by
tlie R. Duell Company of Santa
Monica, which also designed the
rides lor Disneyland. Disney
World. Six Flags Over Texas. Six
Flags over Georgia. Busch Gar
dens and Magic Mountain,
among other biggies in the lei
sure industry, as it is so aptly
referred to.
All of the aforementioned
craftsmen will be employes of
the Marriott Corporation, as will
all the entertainers in the five
theatrical showcase productions
around the park. The Theater
Royale. The Wilderness Theater,
Grandstand Pavilion, Grand
Music Hall and Snowshoe Sa
loon have a combined capacity
of 6100 seats. The costumes and
architecture for each part of the
park are authentic and meticul
ously detailed, right down to the
security officers' uniforms.
The best innovation of all lor
this kind of park is theadmission
policy, designed for maximum
pleasure and to avoid waste. It
costs $7.95 for adults and $6.95
for children from ages four to. 11
(children under three are free) —
and that's all. Once inside, all
rides and attractions are free.
Gifts and food do cost, of course,
but this alleviates the problem
that has plagued most of us at
one time or another — what do
you do with 16 unused "A" tic
kets ?
Progressing nicely
Construction for Great
America began on October 24.
1973 and is speedily progressing
towards opening day on March
20. The park will be open
weekends only until summer,
when it will be open daily from
10 a.m. to 10 p.m. According to
publicist john Poimiroo. the
workers at Great America had
"an inordinate amount of pride
in their work." One day while
conducting someone on a tour of
the grounds, they commented on
the quality of a building, at
which point a worker called out.
"And I built it!"
The statistics for Great
America are boggling. It covers
200 of the 556 acres the Marriott
Corporation purchased in Santa

Clara and they expect some
where between two and two
and-a-half million people its
first year.
It was landscaped at a cost of
$2 million, with 3000 coniferous
trees. 3000 deciduous trees.
35.000 shrubs. 134 olive trees
(all older than 100 years).
150.000 annual color plants and
flowers. 500 hanging baskets
and 100.000 ground cover
plants. It has 42 attractions. 27 of
them rides geared to their par
ticular part of the park, ranging
from kids' rides to thrill rides (or
is that redundant?).
Cartoon characters
Marriott has the license from
Warner brothers to use their car
toon characters in a theme park
setting. Bugs Bunnv and his
friends and nemeses will be at
Great America, a la Mickey
Mouse and his companions. Be
sure not to get these parks con
fused — anyone wearing Mous
keteer ears upon approaching
Great America will very likely be
refused admittance.
Marriott also plans two more
Great Americas in metropolitan
areas its researchers have
found to be lacking such
facilities. In Gurnee, Illinois,
near Chicago, a Great America

will open in May of this year. In
the Blue Ridge Mountains of
Virginia, near Manassas, one is
expected to open in 1978.
With the other 358 acres Mar
riott has purchased, they plan to
provide space for light commer

c.ial industry. hopefully
entertainment-oriented. The
corporation wants the surround
ing area to be of a "soft" com
mercial nature*, without factories
or other assembly-type com
panies.
