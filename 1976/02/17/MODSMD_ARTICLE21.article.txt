## 
### Connie Butler 
The Biology Department, in
conjunction will the Biology
Bridge, will sponsor a special
pre-registration program aimed
at familiarizing students with
the major. It will be held at 4:15
on Thursday, Feb. 19, in the
Tresidder Large Lounge.
According to senior Dave Sar
toris, coordinator of the program
and member of the Biology
Bridge staff, the undertaking is
the first of its kind ever attemp
ted.
"The presentation will be
geared primarily toward non
majors and freshmen con
templating enrollment in Biol
ogy I this spring. However, it
will cover advanced course of
ferings and other topics of gen
eral interest to departmental
majors as well," he commented.
Following a brief introduction
to the Department and its
facilities, Asst. Biology Prof.
Robert Simoni will discuss the
faculty and curriculum, with
emphasis on the core and cog
nate courses required for a Biol
ogy major.
Senior Jerry Waldvogel will
then speak briefly about the
Honors Program in Biology,
which allows students to carry
out self-initiated research under
faculty supervision. His talk will
be followed by fi discussion of
the faculty, facilities and course
offerings at Hopkins Marine Sta
tion bv Professor David Ken

nedy. Slides will accompany the
program.
Biology Prof. Harold Mooney
will describe the Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve, including
its ecological significance and
related course opportunities.
Senior Mary Artero, head of
the Biology Bridge, will then
discuss sources of academic and
career information in the Biol
ogy Department, including the
services of the Bridge.
The program will be con
cluded bya social hour with re
freshments. where departmental
majors and faculty will be avail
able for questions.
The program was conceived
last quarter by the Bridge staff as
a means of promoting student
faculty interaction and adequate
advising in the department.
"Due to the large number of

Biology majors, close faculty
contact is limited, and many
student. ' ti! to learn about the
special research and academic
opportunities which are availa
ble. The seminar will attempt to
overcome this problem not only
by describing existing programs,
but also by making students
aware of where they may go for
information and advice in thefu
ture," commented Sartoris.
Simoni added. "The Biology
Bridge has had a marked effect in
promoting student-faculty in
teraction and improving the ef
fectiveness of our advising prog
ram. This orientation presenta
tion is yet another worthwhile
step in that direction, and
should be beneficial to any stu
dent with an interest in Biology
who desires more information
about the Department."
