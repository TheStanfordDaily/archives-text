## What happened to the 'New Era'? Troubled Cards drop two more 
### Chris Baker 
Stanford basketball's alleged
"New Era" looked strangely like
a vision from the past, as turnov
ers. injuries and some Pacific
Eight officials who made the Na
tional Football League's officiat
ing look flawless, helped Oregon
State and Oregon hand the Cards
two straight setbacks, 70-66 and
84-62 respectively, last weekend
in Maples Pavilion.
Stanford had a seven point
lead, 66-59, over the Beavers
with just 4:20 left to play Friday
night, and the Cards looked well
on their way to winning their
first Pac-8 home game. Stanford
was outshooting Oregon State,
the best shooting team in the

conference, hitting 17 of 23 from
the field in the second half for a
.739 performance in the stanza.
Hut then, Heaver guard Oeorge
Tucker, who hobbled into Ore
gon State's Gill Coliseum on
crutches when the two teams
met two weeks ago, hobbled the
Cards.
Seven straight points
Tucker scored seven straight
points, as the Beavers caught
and passed the Cards to stay
within a game and a half of
league-leading IJCLA going into
their Thursday showdown in
Pauley Pavilion.
Then Stanford guard Mike
Brat/ was hammered by Tucker
when he put up a shot and re

feree Lou Soriano didn't see any
thing.
But Soriano, a veteran Pac-8
official, did see Bratz, who is all
of 6-foot-2, goaltend the 6-4
Tucker's shot at the other end of
the court. Soriano also sent
Tucker to the free throw stripe.
Tucker completed the three
point play to bring the Beavers
within two, at 66-64, with 1:57
remaining. OSIJ was awarded IB
free throws compared to 10 for
Stanford in the contest.
Card coach Dick Dißiaso im
mediately called a timeout to re
group his hallclub. But it didn't
do any good. Stanford couldn't
even inbound theball.as Jay Car
ter committed his fourth and
most costly foul. Tucker, whose
nickname is "Ice-T," coolly sank
another two free throws to tie the
contest for the 13th and final
time at 66-66, with just 59 sec
onds left.
32 Card turnovers
But the Cards, who committed
32 turnovers in the game, we
ren't through yet. After Carter's
miscue, Dißiaso inserted center

Tim Patterson, who was suffer
ing from a very bad case of the
flu. into the game. The 6-11 Pat
terson responded hy handing the
ball back to the Beavers when lie
was double-teamed.
The Cards had to get the ball
back, so Bratz committed his
fifth foul, sending Tucker to the
line again. Tucker, the Pac-B's
best free throw shooter (70-84.
.833), sank two more to put OSU
ahead for the first time since the
18:42 mark of the second half, at
68-66. It was all over for Stan
ford, the Cards didn't even get a
shot off.
Dißiaso disguised his anger
after the game. "We should have
won the ball game. We should
have won going away," said the
first-year coach. "You can't win
a ball game when you have3l or
32 turnovers. Anytime you have
a close ball game, and go down
to the final three minutes, you
must execute your offense."
He praised forward Ceorge
Schader, who. despite playing
on a fibula stress fracture and an
injured Achilles tendon, scored

21 points and held QSU's lead
ing scorer, LonnieShelton. to his
18 point-per-game average.
'Determined to p!a>'
"I think George Schader did a
great job defensively on Shel
ton," DiBiaso said. "He was ob
viously determined to play a
good game." Besides Schader
and Bratz, the only other deter
mined Card was forward Ed
Schweitzer, who scored 20
points (8-9 from the floor and 4-4
from the line).
DiBiaso said his Cards would
"have to play with a lot of deter
mination" against Oregon the
following night.
Stanford played with deter
mination for about 15 minutes
before obnoxious Oregon, and
its contingent of equally obnoxi
ous fans took over.
With the score tied 26-26, at
the 5:15 mark of the first half, the
Ducks outscored the Cards nine
to one. Stanford, a club with as
much depth as Lake Lagunita,
had to play without Schader for
3 5 minutes. He was removed
under doctor's orders. Schader
will undergo x-rays to see if he
can make the Washington trip
tomorrow. Patterson played just
16 minutes because of illness.
Dismal shooting
Of course, it didn't help mat
ters any that the Cards had their
second consecutive dismal first
half shooting night against Ore
gon either (9-27, .,333).
Stanford made one brief run.
thanks to 24 free throws awarded
to the Cards in the second half, to
close to within nine, at 47-36,
with 13:09 left. But Oregon
guard Ronnie Lee made his
fourth and last visit to Maples a
memorable one, scoring 13
second-half points (18 for the
game) to give the Ducks their
second win in two weeks over
Stanford.
Almost unnoticed was Oregon
forward Creg Ballard. The 6-7
junior scored 20 points for
Duck-high honors, and grabbed
a game-high 12 caroms.
Almost too noticeable was Ore
gon sophomore guard Mike
Drummond, who after last year's
celebrated kicking incident with
Stanford's Rich Kelley, was as
welcome in Maples as John
McKay was in the Stadium.
Stanford fans booed him each
time he touched the ball, but
Oregon fans responded by cheer
ing him. The only thing missing
