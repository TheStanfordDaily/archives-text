# Pac-8 roundup
## Home teams fare poorly 
### Marko Fong 
It is said that home teams have
a tremendous advantage in col
lege basketball. In a carefully
controlled test of this adage, the
Pacific Eight Conference played
the same schedule on consecu
tive weeks with one major dif
ference: it reversed the home and
visiting teams. For all you old
wives out there, the home court
helped very little last weekend.
Home teams went 2-6.
IJCLA, which won two games
up in Washington last week to
take the conference lead, beat the
same two Washington teams at
home although it was
Washington's Birthday
weekend. Thursday the Bruins
drowned the Washington State
Cougars, 104-78. David Creen
wood, who has started at center
for UCLA the last five games (all
wins by the way), held
Washington State's high scoring

center Steve Puidokas to 10
points, a littlebetter than half his
average.
Saturday the Bruins exercised
what is elsewhere an imaginary
territorial imperative by beating
Washington, 7H-76, for their
97th straight victory at Pauley
Pavilion. Most of the game was
an exchange of scores between
UCLA's Marques Johnson (22)
and Richard Washington (24).
and the Huskies' James Edwards
(20) and Lars Hansen (22).
After Edwards fouled out.
UCLA seemed to put the game
away. Clarence Ramsey and
Hansen led a late Husky rally,
but they were unable to offset
Jim Spillane's four dutch free
throws in the last two minutes,
and a mental error following an
intercepted pass in the last mi
nute at 78-76.
Across town, USC, which had
been a gracious guest by losing
two up in Washington, proved to
be an equally gracious host. The
Trojans lost to Washington,
93-75 Thursday, and to

Washington State, 84-70. Satur
day.
They say that people are more
hospitable up in Northern
California. With Stanford trying
to keep up with I ISC] by also los
ing its games both away and at
home. California managed to
outdo its two rivals by losing to
Oregon. 75-64, and then making
up to Oregon State, whom the
Bears had beaten. 73-72. in the
last second up in Corvallis last
week.
dreg Ballard decided to tell
the pro scouts that there was a
player at Oregon other than Ron
Lee by scoring 32 points against
Cal.
