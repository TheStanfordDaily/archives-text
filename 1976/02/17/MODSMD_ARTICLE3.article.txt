HURLINGAME — "You're per
ceived as the small government crowd,
the intense personal liberties crowd,"
"olumnist Nicholas von Hoffman told
the Libertarian Party of California con
vention Sunday night at the Hilton Inn
near the San Francisco International
Airport.
Von Hoffman's speech capped the
convention's dinner, coming after an
-.uldress by Libertarian Vice Presiden
tial candidate David Bergland.
I he fourth Libertarian party state
convention, which ran here from Fri
day until yesterday, saw more than 100
delegates from throughout California
convene at the Airport Marina Hotel to
work out a party platform for the com
ing year and discuss Libertarian prog
rams and ideas through seminars.
Final draft
The Libertarians, in the final draft of
their platform, stated that they:

—favor "immediate repeal of all
laws restricting transit competition"
(such as taxicab medallion ordinances
and municipal prohibitions of private
jitney services): "immediate end to
government financing of mass transit
projects"; and full deregulation of the
trucking industry to end California's
required minimum fees as well as the
federal Interstate Commerce Commis
sion;
—oppose compulsory no-fault au
tomobile insurance;
—oppose "Right-to-VVork" laws as a
restriction on an employer's right to
make a closed shop contract;
—favor unconditional amnesty for
those convicted under victimless
crime statutes.
Pertinent planks
Kven though planks which specifi
cally mentioned state issues were pas
sed, some delegates thought onlv
those planks pertinent to California
should have been passed.
"IVe should stay away from national
issues" at a state convention, said
Carol Cunningham a delegate from
San Francisco.
The delegates, who drew a crowd of
more than 200 additional party mem
bers and interested spectators at times,
heard 1972 Libertarian presidential
candidate John Hospers speak earlier
at the Sunday luncheon. Hospers dis
cussed American foreign policy, term
ing detente too "one-sided."
Hospers, in his conclusion said "the
United States should have nothing to
do with totalitarian dictatorships,
especially predatory and expansion
sist ones."
At the dinner later that day Bergland
told the audience that the "two-party
situation in this country is a hoax."
Educate citizens
Besides educating citizens about
Libertarianism, Bergland felt that
Libertarians "will define the issues in
this presidential campaign."
However. Von Hoffman, whey spoke
after Bergland and gave his observa
tions on the Libertarian party, said "a

serious-problem will be making your
selves truly distinguishable" in this
election year.
Von Hoffman, with his usual wit.
also reminded the audience that "at
tacking bureaucracy ain't a dangerous
position" currently.
Von Hoffman also commented on
the effect that Ronald Reagan's captur
ing the Republican nomination would
have on the party.
"From the outside, that's a terrible
threat to you. His nomination could
pull you to pieces."
Gary Allen. Stanford alumnus and
pamphleteer for the John Nirch Society
who attended the convention and din
ner as an observer, agreed with Von
Hoffman as to what a Reagan nomina
tion would do to the Libertarian Party,
to which he does not belong.
Reagan "would steal the rhetoric
without any of the action." Allen said.
Though Von Hoffman pointed out
many disagreements he had with the
Libertarian party's values, most Liber
tarians were glad that he spoke.
"Von Hoffman is an outsider, and
his speaking shows we're being taken
seriously by outsiders," said San
Diego delegate Sara Baase.
