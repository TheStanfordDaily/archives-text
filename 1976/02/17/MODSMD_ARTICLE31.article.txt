# Pac-8 predictions
## 
### 
Last week our predictor layed it on the line
and picked Washington to break UCLA's
95-game win streak in Pauley Pavilion. The
Huskies came close but still became victim
number 96". So our predictor tabbed five of
eight games last week, to keep his mark at
.632.
The Cards travel to Washington this week
for a game Thursday night against the Hus
kies and Saturday afternoon at 3 against
WSU. Washington is coming off that frustrat
ing 78-76 loss to the Bruins in Westwood,
while the Cards are coming off an equally
impotent weekend against the Oregonians.
Center fames Edwards and forward Lars
Hansen combined for 42 points last week.
Still, the last time the Cards met the Dogs,
Stanford made a pretty good run at it before

losing 87-81. But now that injuries have de
cimated Stanford, the Huskies figure to run
away with it.
Washington State is the surprise team of
the conference and the Cougars certainly
surprised Stanford fans in last month's
62-60 Cougar win. This time it won't be a
surprise when the Cougs win. It's just too had
that the Giovacchinis can't hold a family
reunion. Paul is out for the season.
