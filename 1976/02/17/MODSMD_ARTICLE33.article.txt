ABA backs prostitution laws
PHILADELPHIA — Delegates to the American
Bar Association (ABA} Convention came within
two votes yesterday of recommending the repeal of
criminal penalties for prostitution.
The vote of the ABA policy-making House of
Delegates was 134-132.
On the prostitution issue, the delegates narrowly
rejected a recommendation by the ABA's Commit
tee on Individual Rights and Responsibilities,
which said sex does not "become a matter any less
of individual choice simply because money
changes hands."
Proponents of the change said existing laws dis
criminate against women and require police to di
vert needed manpower from fighting more serious
offenses.
Earlier the delegates urged Congress to create a
panel of judges which would have the power to
appoint a special prosecutor if the attorney general
declined to do so. The vote on that proposal, which
was opposed by the Justice Department, was 165-
90.
The delegates also approved, by voice vote, a
series of recommendations liberalizing the associa
tion's stand on the right to jury trial in criminal
cases.
The new standards call for a jury trial for <iny
offense that could lead to imprisonment, instead of
specifying imprisonment for six months or longer
as in the previous standard.
Postal subsidies debated
WASHINCTON — Higher postal rates are inevit
able to overcome increased costs and lagging re
venues, the Ford administration said yesterday in
opposing additional federal subsidies for the U.S.
Postal Service.
Budget Director lames T. Lynn told the Senate
Post Office Committee that pending legislation to
provide additional subsidies "provide neither an
answer to the underlying problem of rising costs
nor any incentive to increase efficiency."
He also called it unfair to taxpayers and said it
obscures the true costs of postal operations.
However, business mailers are enthusiastically
supporting proposals to turn over more of the tax
payers' money to tin; Postal Service.
The big mailers generally resisted a trend in re
cent years toward lower subsidies.
The Postal Service, in desperate need of addi
tional income, has changed its opposition to higher
subsidies. PostmasterCeneral Benjamin Bailar how
wants such an increase at least as a temporary mea
sur<! to offset the agency's chronic deficit.
And Sen. Cale McCee, (D-Wyo.) chairman of the
Senate Post Office Committee, is sponsoring a bill
to double the annual subsidy over the next three
years. The subsidy now is $1.5 billion a year.

Ford offers FEC solution
WASHINCTON — Calling for quick action to
avoid election abuses. President Ford asked Con
gress yesterday to give him the power to appoint al 1
six members of the Federal Election Commission
(FEC) subject to approval by the Senate.
In a statement he read personally to reporters at
the White House, the President said he was sending
legislation to Congress providing for such a
change. He urged Congress to approve it quickly to
avoid erosion of public confidence in the political
process and to prevent abuses in the coming elec
tion.
Presenting his request to Congress for power to
appoint the election commissioners. Ford said that
unless the House and Senate act. the present com
mission "will be stripped of most of its powers" in
two weeks. "We must not allow that to happen." he
said.
The SupremeCourt ruled Jan. 30 that the FEC as
structured under the present federal election law is
unconstitutional because four of its six members
are appointed by Congress.
Kissinger starts delayed trip
CARACAS, Venezuela — Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger began his often postponed trip to
Latin America yesterday hoping to keep divisive
issues such as Cuba and the Panama Canal as far in
the b jkground as possible.
Hours before his arrival, some students at the
Central University of Venezuela in Caracas staged
demonstrations against the visit, shouting "down
with Kissinger" and "we don't want the CIA in
Venezuela," university sources reported. The
police did not enter the campus.
Kissinger hopes to reassure Latin-American na
tions of their importance to Washington and build a
better image for the United States. Much of the
Southern Hemisphere has become increasingly
skeptical of the United States in recent years.
In Venezuela, Kissinger was expected to focus
mainly on economics and his efforts to remove a
congressional exclusion of Venezuela from trade
preferences. Venezuela and Ecuador were
excluded because they belong to the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which cut off oil
imports to the United States at the time of the 1973
Mideast war.
Meany condemns Ford
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — AFL-CIO President
Ceorge Meany condemned President Ford yester
day as "completely without compassion" for the
little people and emphasized that the labor federa
tion would support virtually any of the Democratic
presidential candidates.

Meany. denounced both Ford and his Republican
challenger, Ronald Reagan, as "products of Repub
lican conservatism." He withheld endorsement of
any Democrat, but said the only announced candi
date he would refuse to back would be Alabama
Gov. George Wallace, whom Meany called "a disas
ter."
He said that Minnesota Sen. Hubert H. Hum
phrey was "the most electable" of all the Democ
rats.
However, the AFL-CIO president reaffirmed the
federation's policy of remaining neutral in the
Democratic delegates selection process, but noted
that individual unions are encouraged to get union
members elected as convention delegates to assure
labor a voice at the convention.
Lockheed problems intensify
OTTAWA — Canada's defense minister said yes
terday there is a possibility that negotiations on a
$950 million contract with Lockheed would col
lapse unless the firm could overcome financial
trouble.
Canadian Defense Minister James Richardson
told reporters after a 90-minute meeting with top
Lockheed officials that "the difficulty has not been
resolved."
Canada and Lockheed are negotiating the purch
ase of 18 Orion patrol aircraft. The defense minister
said he was assured by Lockheed's new board
chairman, Robert Haach, that a new financing ar
rangement could be expected later this year.
Meanwhile, Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho) said
in London that the U.S. Justice Department may be
asked to probe claims that Lockheed bribed West
German officials to win aircraft sales.
Church told reporters "possible action on perjury
charges" could be involved against executives who
gave conflicting evidence to the Senate subcommit
tee probing multinational firms.
A former Lockheed official said in an interview
with the Arizona Republic that the firm paid $16
million to a West German political party and
$500,000 to Greece to help win airplane sales. He
said the money was given in addition to $22 million
the firm admitted paying foreign officials.

$950 million contract with Lockheed would col
lapse unless the firm could overcome financial
trouble.
Canadian Defense Minister James Richardson
told reporters after a 90-minute meeting with top
Lockheed officials that "the difficulty has not been
resolved."
Canada and Lockheed are negotiating the purch
ase of 18 Orion patrol aircraft. The defense minister
said he was assured by Lockheed's new board
chairman, Robert Haach, that a new financing ar
rangement could be expected later this year.
Meanwhile, Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho) said
in London that the U.S. Justice Department may be
asked to probe claims that Lockheed bribed West
German officials to win aircraft sales.
Church told reporters "possible action on perjury
charges" could be involved against executives who
gave conflicting evidence to the Senate subcommit
tee probing multinational firms.
A former Lockheed official said in an interview
with the Arizona Republic that the firm paid $16
million to a West German political party and
$500,000 to Greece to help win airplane sales. He
said the money was given in addition to $22 million
the firm admitted paying foreign officials.

ABA backs prostitution laws
PHILADELPHIA — Delegates to the American
Bar Association (ABA} Convention came within
two votes yesterday of recommending the repeal of
criminal penalties for prostitution.
The vote of the ABA policy-making House of
Delegates was 134-132.
On the prostitution issue, the delegates narrowly
rejected a recommendation by the ABA's Commit
tee on Individual Rights and Responsibilities,
which said sex does not "become a matter any less
of individual choice simply because money
changes hands."
Proponents of the change said existing laws dis
criminate against women and require police to di
vert needed manpower from fighting more serious
offenses.
Earlier the delegates urged Congress to create a
panel of judges which would have the power to
appoint a special prosecutor if the attorney general
declined to do so. The vote on that proposal, which
was opposed by the Justice Department, was 165-
90.
The delegates also approved, by voice vote, a
series of recommendations liberalizing the associa
tion's stand on the right to jury trial in criminal
cases.
The new standards call for a jury trial for <iny
offense that could lead to imprisonment, instead of
specifying imprisonment for six months or longer
as in the previous standard.
Postal subsidies debated
WASHINCTON — Higher postal rates are inevit
able to overcome increased costs and lagging re
venues, the Ford administration said yesterday in
opposing additional federal subsidies for the U.S.
Postal Service.
Budget Director lames T. Lynn told the Senate
Post Office Committee that pending legislation to
provide additional subsidies "provide neither an
answer to the underlying problem of rising costs
nor any incentive to increase efficiency."
He also called it unfair to taxpayers and said it
obscures the true costs of postal operations.
However, business mailers are enthusiastically
supporting proposals to turn over more of the tax
payers' money to tin; Postal Service.
The big mailers generally resisted a trend in re
cent years toward lower subsidies.
The Postal Service, in desperate need of addi
tional income, has changed its opposition to higher
subsidies. PostmasterCeneral Benjamin Bailar how
wants such an increase at least as a temporary mea
sur<! to offset the agency's chronic deficit.
And Sen. Cale McCee, (D-Wyo.) chairman of the
Senate Post Office Committee, is sponsoring a bill
to double the annual subsidy over the next three
years. The subsidy now is $1.5 billion a year.

Ford offers FEC solution
WASHINCTON — Calling for quick action to
avoid election abuses. President Ford asked Con
gress yesterday to give him the power to appoint al 1
six members of the Federal Election Commission
(FEC) subject to approval by the Senate.
In a statement he read personally to reporters at
the White House, the President said he was sending
legislation to Congress providing for such a
change. He urged Congress to approve it quickly to
avoid erosion of public confidence in the political
process and to prevent abuses in the coming elec
tion.
Presenting his request to Congress for power to
appoint the election commissioners. Ford said that
unless the House and Senate act. the present com
mission "will be stripped of most of its powers" in
two weeks. "We must not allow that to happen." he
said.
The SupremeCourt ruled Jan. 30 that the FEC as
structured under the present federal election law is
unconstitutional because four of its six members
are appointed by Congress.
Kissinger starts delayed trip
CARACAS, Venezuela — Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger began his often postponed trip to
Latin America yesterday hoping to keep divisive
issues such as Cuba and the Panama Canal as far in
the b jkground as possible.
Hours before his arrival, some students at the
Central University of Venezuela in Caracas staged
demonstrations against the visit, shouting "down
with Kissinger" and "we don't want the CIA in
Venezuela," university sources reported. The
police did not enter the campus.
Kissinger hopes to reassure Latin-American na
tions of their importance to Washington and build a
better image for the United States. Much of the
Southern Hemisphere has become increasingly
skeptical of the United States in recent years.
In Venezuela, Kissinger was expected to focus
mainly on economics and his efforts to remove a
congressional exclusion of Venezuela from trade
preferences. Venezuela and Ecuador were
excluded because they belong to the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which cut off oil
imports to the United States at the time of the 1973
Mideast war.
Meany condemns Ford
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — AFL-CIO President
Ceorge Meany condemned President Ford yester
day as "completely without compassion" for the
little people and emphasized that the labor federa
tion would support virtually any of the Democratic
presidential candidates.

Meany. denounced both Ford and his Republican
challenger, Ronald Reagan, as "products of Repub
lican conservatism." He withheld endorsement of
any Democrat, but said the only announced candi
date he would refuse to back would be Alabama
Gov. George Wallace, whom Meany called "a disas
ter."
He said that Minnesota Sen. Hubert H. Hum
phrey was "the most electable" of all the Democ
rats.
However, the AFL-CIO president reaffirmed the
federation's policy of remaining neutral in the
Democratic delegates selection process, but noted
that individual unions are encouraged to get union
members elected as convention delegates to assure
labor a voice at the convention.

In Venezuela, Kissinger was expected to focus
mainly on economics and his efforts to remove a

excluded because they belong to the Organization

Meany condemns Ford
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — AFL-CIO President
Ceorge Meany condemned President Ford yester
day as "completely without compassion" for the
little people and emphasized that the labor federa
tion would support virtually any of the Democratic
presidential candidates.

Meany. denounced both Ford and his Republican
challenger, Ronald Reagan, as "products of Repub
lican conservatism." He withheld endorsement of
any Democrat, but said the only announced candi
date he would refuse to back would be Alabama
Gov. George Wallace, whom Meany called "a disas
ter."
He said that Minnesota Sen. Hubert H. Hum
phrey was "the most electable" of all the Democ
rats.
However, the AFL-CIO president reaffirmed the
federation's policy of remaining neutral in the
Democratic delegates selection process, but noted
that individual unions are encouraged to get union
members elected as convention delegates to assure
labor a voice at the convention.
Lockheed problems intensify
OTTAWA — Canada's defense minister said yes
terday there is a possibility that negotiations on a
$950 million contract with Lockheed would col
lapse unless the firm could overcome financial
trouble.
Canadian Defense Minister James Richardson
told reporters after a 90-minute meeting with top
Lockheed officials that "the difficulty has not been
resolved."
Canada and Lockheed are negotiating the purch
ase of 18 Orion patrol aircraft. The defense minister
said he was assured by Lockheed's new board
chairman, Robert Haach, that a new financing ar
rangement could be expected later this year.
Meanwhile, Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho) said
in London that the U.S. Justice Department may be
asked to probe claims that Lockheed bribed West
German officials to win aircraft sales.
Church told reporters "possible action on perjury
charges" could be involved against executives who
gave conflicting evidence to the Senate subcommit
tee probing multinational firms.
A former Lockheed official said in an interview
with the Arizona Republic that the firm paid $16
million to a West German political party and
$500,000 to Greece to help win airplane sales. He
said the money was given in addition to $22 million
the firm admitted paying foreign officials.

ABA backs prostitution laws
PHILADELPHIA — Delegates to the American
Bar Association (ABA} Convention came within
two votes yesterday of recommending the repeal of
criminal penalties for prostitution.
The vote of the ABA policy-making House of
Delegates was 134-132.
On the prostitution issue, the delegates narrowly
rejected a recommendation by the ABA's Commit
tee on Individual Rights and Responsibilities,
which said sex does not "become a matter any less
of individual choice simply because money
changes hands."
Proponents of the change said existing laws dis
criminate against women and require police to di
vert needed manpower from fighting more serious
offenses.
Earlier the delegates urged Congress to create a
panel of judges which would have the power to
appoint a special prosecutor if the attorney general
declined to do so. The vote on that proposal, which
was opposed by the Justice Department, was 165-
90.
The delegates also approved, by voice vote, a
series of recommendations liberalizing the associa
tion's stand on the right to jury trial in criminal
cases.
The new standards call for a jury trial for <iny
offense that could lead to imprisonment, instead of
specifying imprisonment for six months or longer
as in the previous standard.
Postal subsidies debated
WASHINCTON — Higher postal rates are inevit
able to overcome increased costs and lagging re
venues, the Ford administration said yesterday in
opposing additional federal subsidies for the U.S.
Postal Service.
Budget Director lames T. Lynn told the Senate
Post Office Committee that pending legislation to
provide additional subsidies "provide neither an
answer to the underlying problem of rising costs
nor any incentive to increase efficiency."
He also called it unfair to taxpayers and said it
obscures the true costs of postal operations.
However, business mailers are enthusiastically
supporting proposals to turn over more of the tax
payers' money to tin; Postal Service.
The big mailers generally resisted a trend in re
cent years toward lower subsidies.
The Postal Service, in desperate need of addi
tional income, has changed its opposition to higher
subsidies. PostmasterCeneral Benjamin Bailar how
wants such an increase at least as a temporary mea
sur<! to offset the agency's chronic deficit.
And Sen. Cale McCee, (D-Wyo.) chairman of the
Senate Post Office Committee, is sponsoring a bill
to double the annual subsidy over the next three
years. The subsidy now is $1.5 billion a year.

Ford offers FEC solution
WASHINCTON — Calling for quick action to
avoid election abuses. President Ford asked Con
gress yesterday to give him the power to appoint al 1
six members of the Federal Election Commission
(FEC) subject to approval by the Senate.
In a statement he read personally to reporters at
the White House, the President said he was sending
legislation to Congress providing for such a
change. He urged Congress to approve it quickly to
avoid erosion of public confidence in the political
process and to prevent abuses in the coming elec
tion.
Presenting his request to Congress for power to
appoint the election commissioners. Ford said that
unless the House and Senate act. the present com
mission "will be stripped of most of its powers" in
two weeks. "We must not allow that to happen." he
said.
The SupremeCourt ruled Jan. 30 that the FEC as
structured under the present federal election law is
unconstitutional because four of its six members
are appointed by Congress.
Kissinger starts delayed trip
CARACAS, Venezuela — Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger began his often postponed trip to
Latin America yesterday hoping to keep divisive
issues such as Cuba and the Panama Canal as far in
the b jkground as possible.
Hours before his arrival, some students at the
Central University of Venezuela in Caracas staged
demonstrations against the visit, shouting "down
with Kissinger" and "we don't want the CIA in
Venezuela," university sources reported. The
police did not enter the campus.
Kissinger hopes to reassure Latin-American na
tions of their importance to Washington and build a
better image for the United States. Much of the
