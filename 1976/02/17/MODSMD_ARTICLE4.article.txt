# Most see approaching equity
## Sciences stressed over humanities? 
### Bill Ross Bob Fikso 
(First of two parts)
Many critics of the University over
the years have charged that the natural
and applied sciences here receive
more emphasis than the social sci
ences or humanities. Some critics have
even called the University "Stanford
Tech."
But most faculty members and ad
ministrators seem to dismiss this
charge as an unfortunate myth. They
tend to agree that there are strong and
weak departments in the natural sci
ences, the social sciences and the
humanities alike. National rankings of
departments verify this contention.
Any notion that the University is
science-oriented is rooted in the spe
cial emphasis given to the natural sci
ences here prior to its massive expan
sion in the 1950s and 19605, many pro
fessors say.
"When I came here in 1950, it was
quite commonly said that humanities
were the frosting on the cake — they
seemed supplementary to the more
fundamental study of science and
technology," John Goheen, emeritus
professor of philosophy, said. "But
since then things have changed a great
deal. Our progress in the humanities
and social sciences has been quite re
markable."
Goheen noted, however, that certain
disciplines, such as English, history
and economics have always been
strong here.
Distinguished programs
President Richard Lyman con
tended that the University's engineer
ing and professional programs are so
distinguished that the humanities and
social sciences — excellent in them
selves — tend to pale by comparison.
"It is a long-standing question
whether there is an adequate balance
at Stanford between different
academic areas," Lyman said. "This
stems in part from the unusual distinc
tion of the engineering program here.
It is hard to think of another private
university outside of the technical in

stitutes that has such a good engineer
ing department."
Lyman added that many persons
who read about the distinction of Stan
lord's graduate schools wrongly as
sume that the University must be neg
lecting undergraduate liberal arts edu
cation.
"The relation between graduate and
undergraduate education is not a
zero-sum game," Lyman said. "There
is no reason why we cannot have qual
ity in both areas."
Lyman said that the University has
not slackened its efforts, which began
in the '50s, to upgrade its social sci
ence and humanities programs.
Lyman acknowledged, however,
that this process is less spectacular
now than it was a decade or more ago
because of economic restrictions and
the difficulty of improving depart
ments that already are strong.
Not as committed
But French Prof. Robert Cohn said
that the University no longer is as
committed to upgrading its
humanities and social science de
partments as it was during the 19505.
Cerman Prof. Gerald Gillespie ag
reed.
"There is a lack of comprehensive
thinking in the administration about
the humanities. There is innate inertia.
I see no overall plan," he said.
But Emeritus Philosophy Prof.
Philip Rhinelander, who served as
dean of humanities and sciences dur
ing the late '50s and early '60s when
the University recruited dozens of dis
tinguished professors from other
schools, said that the University is still
committed to improving its social sci
ence and humanities departments.
"I'd like to see the humanities be
come stronger," Rhinelander said.
"But I am not aware that there is a
serious discrepancy here between the
quality of the natural sciences and that
of the social sciences and the
humanities."
Cohn disagreed, contending that the
University never has been as success
ful in recruiting leading scholars for

the humanities as it has been in the
natural sciences.
Religious Studies Chairman Wil
liam Clebsch. however, made a dis
tinction between quality and quantity.
"Stanford has proved in the
humanities that you don't have to be
big to be excellent," he said.
But Education and Anthropology
Prof. Robert Textor said that the Uni
versity has neglected entire areas oi
humanistic study. He cited Arabic and
Indie studies as examples.
The National Council on Educa
tion's latest rankings, published in
1970, support this contention.
Psychology, a social science, was
ranked first and biology, a natural sci
ence, was ranked second among the
departments of all universities and
colleges in the country.

Many critics of the University over
the years have charged that the natural
and applied sciences here receive
more emphasis than the social sci
ences or humanities. Some critics have
even called the University "Stanford
Tech."
But most faculty members and ad
ministrators seem to dismiss this
charge as an unfortunate myth. They
tend to agree that there are strong and
weak departments in the natural sci
ences, the social sciences and the
humanities alike. National rankings of
departments verify this contention.
Any notion that the University is
science-oriented is rooted in the spe
cial emphasis given to the natural sci
ences here prior to its massive expan
sion in the 1950s and 19605, many pro
fessors say.
"When I came here in 1950, it was
quite commonly said that humanities
were the frosting on the cake — they
seemed supplementary to the more
fundamental study of science and
technology," John Goheen, emeritus
professor of philosophy, said. "But
since then things have changed a great
deal. Our progress in the humanities
and social sciences has been quite re
markable."
Goheen noted, however, that certain
disciplines, such as English, history
and economics have always been
strong here.
Distinguished programs
President Richard Lyman con
tended that the University's engineer
ing and professional programs are so
distinguished that the humanities and
social sciences — excellent in them
selves — tend to pale by comparison.
"It is a long-standing question
whether there is an adequate balance
at Stanford between different
academic areas," Lyman said. "This
stems in part from the unusual distinc
tion of the engineering program here.
It is hard to think of another private
university outside of the technical in

stitutes that has such a good engineer
ing department."
Lyman added that many persons
who read about the distinction of Stan
lord's graduate schools wrongly as
sume that the University must be neg
lecting undergraduate liberal arts edu
cation.

(First of two parts)
Many critics of the University over
the years have charged that the natural
and applied sciences here receive
more emphasis than the social sci
ences or humanities. Some critics have
even called the University "Stanford
Tech."
But most faculty members and ad
ministrators seem to dismiss this
charge as an unfortunate myth. They
tend to agree that there are strong and
weak departments in the natural sci
ences, the social sciences and the
humanities alike. National rankings of
departments verify this contention.
Any notion that the University is
science-oriented is rooted in the spe
cial emphasis given to the natural sci
ences here prior to its massive expan
sion in the 1950s and 19605, many pro
fessors say.
"When I came here in 1950, it was
quite commonly said that humanities
were the frosting on the cake — they
seemed supplementary to the more
fundamental study of science and
technology," John Goheen, emeritus
professor of philosophy, said. "But
since then things have changed a great
deal. Our progress in the humanities
and social sciences has been quite re
markable."
Goheen noted, however, that certain
disciplines, such as English, history
and economics have always been
strong here.
Distinguished programs
President Richard Lyman con
tended that the University's engineer
ing and professional programs are so
distinguished that the humanities and
social sciences — excellent in them
selves — tend to pale by comparison.
"It is a long-standing question
whether there is an adequate balance
at Stanford between different
academic areas," Lyman said. "This
stems in part from the unusual distinc
tion of the engineering program here.
It is hard to think of another private
university outside of the technical in

stitutes that has such a good engineer
ing department."
Lyman added that many persons
who read about the distinction of Stan
lord's graduate schools wrongly as
sume that the University must be neg
lecting undergraduate liberal arts edu
cation.
"The relation between graduate and
undergraduate education is not a
zero-sum game," Lyman said. "There
is no reason why we cannot have qual
ity in both areas."
Lyman said that the University has
not slackened its efforts, which began
in the '50s, to upgrade its social sci
ence and humanities programs.
Lyman acknowledged, however,
that this process is less spectacular
now than it was a decade or more ago
because of economic restrictions and
the difficulty of improving depart
ments that already are strong.
Not as committed
But French Prof. Robert Cohn said
that the University no longer is as
committed to upgrading its
humanities and social science de
partments as it was during the 19505.
Cerman Prof. Gerald Gillespie ag
reed.
"There is a lack of comprehensive
thinking in the administration about
the humanities. There is innate inertia.
I see no overall plan," he said.
But Emeritus Philosophy Prof.
Philip Rhinelander, who served as
dean of humanities and sciences dur
ing the late '50s and early '60s when
the University recruited dozens of dis
tinguished professors from other
schools, said that the University is still
committed to improving its social sci
ence and humanities departments.
"I'd like to see the humanities be
come stronger," Rhinelander said.
"But I am not aware that there is a
serious discrepancy here between the
quality of the natural sciences and that
of the social sciences and the
humanities."
Cohn disagreed, contending that the
University never has been as success
ful in recruiting leading scholars for

the humanities as it has been in the
natural sciences.
Religious Studies Chairman Wil
liam Clebsch. however, made a dis
tinction between quality and quantity.
"Stanford has proved in the
humanities that you don't have to be
big to be excellent," he said.
But Education and Anthropology
Prof. Robert Textor said that the Uni
versity has neglected entire areas oi
humanistic study. He cited Arabic and
Indie studies as examples.
The National Council on Educa
tion's latest rankings, published in
1970, support this contention.
Psychology, a social science, was
ranked first and biology, a natural sci
ence, was ranked second among the
