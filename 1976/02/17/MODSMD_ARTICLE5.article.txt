# Lab frauds cause Medicaid waste

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Kickbacks,
fradulent billing and overpayments to
medical laboratories waste almost $1
out of $5 paid for Medicare and
Medicaid lab services, a Senate com
mittee was told yesterday.
"It is our judgment that at least $45
million of the $213 million in Medi
care and Medicaid payments for clini
cal laboratories is either fraudulent or
unnecessary," the staff of the special
Committee on Aging said.
Chairman Frank Moss (D-Utah)
made the report public in resumed
hearings on fraud and abuse in the
programs.
The report said that "numerically
the number of offenders identified in
investigation is small, but their prop
ortion of public funds for lab service is
large.
"In New York 17 clinical
laboratories controlled 70 percent of
the Medicaid business" the report

said. "In New Jersey, a dozen clinics
controlled more than 60 percent of
Medicaid funds. In Illinois, the 21 labs
under the subcommittee's scrutiny
controlled 80 percent of the state's
Medicaid business."
The staff said its findings reveal that
in other states "kickbacks are so ram
pant that laboratories are almost bar
red from obtaining a Medicaid account
unless they offer a kickback" to physi
cians.
The report focused on Illinois, hut
mentioned Pennsylvania, California,
New York and New Jersey as states
where abuses occur.
Under the Medicaid program, state
and federal governments will pay a
total of about $1 H0.5 million in thecur
rent fiscal year to laboratories for
analysis of blond and other specimens
taken from the poor. aged, blind and
disabled. Another $:J2.5 million is
paid for Medicare for persons H5 ynars
and older.
