## Opinions Josh's great hoax

"Hang in there, he's gone."
Blackboards, toilet stalls,
doors and classrooms have been
purged. Resurrection jokes have
died. Why? Josh is gone. Hilled
as an evangelist, a Campus
Crusader for Christ and a "Best-
Selling" author. Josh McDowell
will be remembered longest as
the man who had an advertising
committee good enough to con
vince the Philistines David was
bigger than Coliath.
Josh's advertising worked. As
one ancient TA reported, "I've
never seen this school so
aroused by a speaker since H.
Bruce Franklin got nailed for
throwing rocks."
Cranted, the advertising cam
paign brought out the people,
but what did it do to his mes
sage? Josh preached Christ is the
key to life, yet he taught that a
gimmick is needed to sell that
key.
But Josh supporters justify this
by arguing the message is impor
tant enough to warrant the most
productive advertising possible.
Others contend Josh blasphemed
his message through his method
of advertising.
Thus, we have a valid ques
tion: did Josh prostitute himself
in order to cleanse us? This ques
tion divides into two more exact
questions.
First, did Josh structure his
campaign around topics most
imperative to the Christian
movement, or did he base it on
sensational topics to create large
audiences?
"The Great Resurrection
Hoax" was Josh's first topic. Ob
viously, this is at the core of
Christianity.
An evangelist must convince
his audience of this if he hopes

for its conversion.
Josh's second topic was enti
tled "-Maximum Sex or Love is
Still Possible in a Junky World."
Sex has always been used as a
lure, yet the question of morality
looms large in the world. Many
sincere young men and women,
raised in homes where cohabita
tion was deemed sinful, have
come to question their moral
values.
Winning converts to a faith is
impossible without convincing
them of the moral commitments.
Thus, Josh was justified in
speaking on sex; it is pertinent to
spreading Christianity.
Having determined his topics
are valid, the next question we
must ask is, did Josh's advertis
ing conflict with the principles
he taught?
The principles he taught in his
first address were that Christ is
real, alive and the literal saviour.
The advertising and the address
definitely conflict.
Obviously, he talked more
about the verity of the resurrec
tion than the falsity. Certainly,
his talk was not advertised as "A
Refutation of the Great Resurrec
tion Hoax ..." but it was im
plied.
His posters pictured a sneaky
little apostle prancing through
the rocks with a mummv under
his arm. The clarion light of sar
casm modified the meaning of
the title.
Yet, his sarcastic, negative ap
proach was a ploy to get people
to hear him speak. He used a
gimmick. Somehow 1 find it hard
to picture Moses thinking-up
gimmicks to sell the Ten Com
mandments.
Josh's lecture on maximum

sex filled the pristine halls of
Memorial Church with curious
students. The ads for the lecture
pictured a Victorial couple in an
old fashioned romantic pose sit
ting on a couch in a junk yard.
The title meshed with the pic
ture to give the impression the
topic would be a maximum sex
that had some implied bounds.
This interpretation was all the
more plausible when one
noticed the name of the evangel
ical group that sponsored the
talk.
However, other advertise
ments began popping up in the
Daily that definitely had other
connotations. And Josh himself
put in the plug for his "sex talk"
when he spoke on the resurrec
tion.
But these were directed at the
basic sex drive in all of us.
The Daily ad pictured a
theatre audience with mouths
agape and faces aghast. The big
bold words "Maximum Sex"
underscored the picture. One
was well aware of what type of
movie the folks were watching,
even though no movie screen
was pictured.
There is a direct conflict in
what he taught and how he ad
vertised. To teach us to control
sex, he used advertising that
hoped we couldn't.
To gain success he lost purity.
To cleanse our souls, he prosti
tuted his own. Hut,as thead man
says, "That's okay, more people
heard the message that way."
Yes, I can hear the Lord now,
"Noah, it's going to rain tomor
row. Why don't you invite a
bunch of people over to the ark
for some grapes and a lecture on
the virtue of promiscuity."

proach was a ploy to get people

mandments.
Josh's lecture on maximum

sex filled the pristine halls of
Memorial Church with curious
students. The ads for the lecture
pictured a Victorial couple in an
old fashioned romantic pose sit
ting on a couch in a junk yard.
The title meshed with the pic
ture to give the impression the
topic would be a maximum sex
that had some implied bounds.
This interpretation was all the
more plausible when one
noticed the name of the evangel
ical group that sponsored the
talk.
However, other advertise
ments began popping up in the
Daily that definitely had other
connotations. And Josh himself
put in the plug for his "sex talk"
when he spoke on the resurrec
tion.
But these were directed at the
basic sex drive in all of us.
The Daily ad pictured a
theatre audience with mouths
agape and faces aghast. The big
bold words "Maximum Sex"
underscored the picture. One
was well aware of what type of
movie the folks were watching,
even though no movie screen
was pictured.
There is a direct conflict in
what he taught and how he ad
vertised. To teach us to control
sex, he used advertising that
hoped we couldn't.
To gain success he lost purity.
To cleanse our souls, he prosti
tuted his own. Hut,as thead man

heard the message that way."

"Hang in there, he's gone."
Blackboards, toilet stalls,
doors and classrooms have been
purged. Resurrection jokes have
died. Why? Josh is gone. Hilled
as an evangelist, a Campus
Crusader for Christ and a "Best-
Selling" author. Josh McDowell
will be remembered longest as
the man who had an advertising
committee good enough to con
vince the Philistines David was
bigger than Coliath.
Josh's advertising worked. As
one ancient TA reported, "I've
never seen this school so
aroused by a speaker since H.
Bruce Franklin got nailed for
throwing rocks."
Cranted, the advertising cam
paign brought out the people,
but what did it do to his mes
sage? Josh preached Christ is the
key to life, yet he taught that a
gimmick is needed to sell that
key.
But Josh supporters justify this
by arguing the message is impor
tant enough to warrant the most
productive advertising possible.
Others contend Josh blasphemed
his message through his method
of advertising.
Thus, we have a valid ques
tion: did Josh prostitute himself
in order to cleanse us? This ques
tion divides into two more exact
questions.
First, did Josh structure his
campaign around topics most
imperative to the Christian
movement, or did he base it on
sensational topics to create large
audiences?
"The Great Resurrection
Hoax" was Josh's first topic. Ob
viously, this is at the core of
Christianity.
An evangelist must convince
his audience of this if he hopes

for its conversion.
Josh's second topic was enti
tled "-Maximum Sex or Love is
Still Possible in a Junky World."
Sex has always been used as a
lure, yet the question of morality
looms large in the world. Many
sincere young men and women,
raised in homes where cohabita
tion was deemed sinful, have
come to question their moral
values.
Winning converts to a faith is
impossible without convincing
them of the moral commitments.
Thus, Josh was justified in
speaking on sex; it is pertinent to
spreading Christianity.
Having determined his topics
are valid, the next question we
must ask is, did Josh's advertis
ing conflict with the principles
he taught?
The principles he taught in his
first address were that Christ is
real, alive and the literal saviour.
The advertising and the address
definitely conflict.
Obviously, he talked more
about the verity of the resurrec
tion than the falsity. Certainly,
his talk was not advertised as "A
Refutation of the Great Resurrec
tion Hoax ..." but it was im
plied.
His posters pictured a sneaky
little apostle prancing through
the rocks with a mummv under
his arm. The clarion light of sar
casm modified the meaning of
the title.
Yet, his sarcastic, negative ap
proach was a ploy to get people
to hear him speak. He used a

productive advertising possible.
Others contend Josh blasphemed
his message through his method
of advertising.
Thus, we have a valid ques
tion: did Josh prostitute himself
in order to cleanse us? This ques
tion divides into two more exact
questions.
First, did Josh structure his
campaign around topics most
imperative to the Christian
movement, or did he base it on
sensational topics to create large
audiences?
"The Great Resurrection
Hoax" was Josh's first topic. Ob
viously, this is at the core of
Christianity.
An evangelist must convince
his audience of this if he hopes

for its conversion.
Josh's second topic was enti
tled "-Maximum Sex or Love is
Still Possible in a Junky World."
Sex has always been used as a
lure, yet the question of morality
looms large in the world. Many
sincere young men and women,
raised in homes where cohabita
tion was deemed sinful, have
come to question their moral
values.
Winning converts to a faith is
impossible without convincing
them of the moral commitments.
Thus, Josh was justified in
speaking on sex; it is pertinent to
spreading Christianity.
Having determined his topics
are valid, the next question we
must ask is, did Josh's advertis
ing conflict with the principles
he taught?
The principles he taught in his
first address were that Christ is
real, alive and the literal saviour.
The advertising and the address
definitely conflict.
Obviously, he talked more
about the verity of the resurrec
tion than the falsity. Certainly,
his talk was not advertised as "A
Refutation of the Great Resurrec
tion Hoax ..." but it was im
plied.
His posters pictured a sneaky
little apostle prancing through
the rocks with a mummv under
his arm. The clarion light of sar
casm modified the meaning of
the title.
Yet, his sarcastic, negative ap
proach was a ploy to get people
to hear him speak. He used a
gimmick. Somehow 1 find it hard
to picture Moses thinking-up
gimmicks to sell the Ten Com
mandments.
Josh's lecture on maximum

sex filled the pristine halls of
Memorial Church with curious
students. The ads for the lecture
pictured a Victorial couple in an
old fashioned romantic pose sit
ting on a couch in a junk yard.
The title meshed with the pic
ture to give the impression the
topic would be a maximum sex
that had some implied bounds.
This interpretation was all the
more plausible when one
noticed the name of the evangel
ical group that sponsored the
talk.
However, other advertise
ments began popping up in the
Daily that definitely had other
connotations. And Josh himself
put in the plug for his "sex talk"
when he spoke on the resurrec
tion.
But these were directed at the
basic sex drive in all of us.
The Daily ad pictured a
theatre audience with mouths
agape and faces aghast. The big
bold words "Maximum Sex"
underscored the picture. One
was well aware of what type of
movie the folks were watching,
even though no movie screen
was pictured.
There is a direct conflict in
what he taught and how he ad
vertised. To teach us to control
sex, he used advertising that
hoped we couldn't.
To gain success he lost purity.
To cleanse our souls, he prosti
tuted his own. Hut,as thead man
says, "That's okay, more people
heard the message that way."
Yes, I can hear the Lord now,
"Noah, it's going to rain tomor
row. Why don't you invite a
bunch of people over to the ark
for some grapes and a lecture on
the virtue of promiscuity."
