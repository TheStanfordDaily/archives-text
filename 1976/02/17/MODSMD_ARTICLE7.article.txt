# Noise problem at UGLY

Concern about the "Meyer
Library noise" has often focused
on the large scale disturbances
that come during particular sea
sons of the academic cycle. At
least one of -these disturbances
was serious enough so that it
could have been considered a
"disruption" in the technical
sense: a violation of the Univer
sity's Campus Disruption Policy
and a serious matter.
Hut beyond this rare case,
there is the more difficult ques
tion why so many students appa
rently find Meyer to be a very
unpleasant place to do serious
academic work.
Structural and nonpersonal
reasons are usually cited: it's too
hot or cold to study there; the
well in the middle makes it a bet
ter theater than a library: every
time someone walks on the un
carpeted floors, the noise is un
bearable.
All true, but these environ
mental problems must be coped
with if academic work is going to

be completed. But the part of the
noise problem which is controll
able is the way students interact
with each other, and it is at this
point consideration becomes
paramount.
Meyer Library is unique. It
was built to be an undergraduate
library, and it was designed for
Stanford students.
Meyer will always be a meet
ing and gathering place for a
significant part of the under
graduate population. In fact, it is
impressive that our students
meet at the library.
But the fact that Meyer serves
this very important function
does not detract from the reality
that Meyer is a library and that
behavior in the library must be
different from behavior outside
of it. Meyer should not be a
tomblike and silent place, be
cause using a library well in
volves activity and interaction.
But it can become a quieter
place. And for that to happen,
inanv students will have to be-

come more conscious of how
their actions affect the other
users of the library.
Here comes my plea to be con
siderate. No one, least of all my
self, would want to see the par
ticular alchemy of community
interaction at Meyer stifled.
No one, particularly the libra
rians, wants to see students view
Meyer as anything but a good
and comfortable place. And no
one is so myopic to think that
with our diverse student body
Meyer will be the best library for
all undergraduates.
But the number and intensity
of the complaints about Meyer's
noise problems should be seen
as a plea everyone should con
sider when he is in Meyer if what
he is doing is making Meyer a
better or worse place for others.
It would take too much money to
change the structure but only a
little amount of consideration to
change the "zoo" into a good
place to work.
