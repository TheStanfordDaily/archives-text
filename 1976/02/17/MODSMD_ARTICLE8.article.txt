Is showmanship equivalent to glitter and gim
mickry? Elian Gates' Feb. 10 Daily review of
David Bowie's Feb. 6 concert shows such preoc
cupation with Bowie's past image that it denies
the sheer dynamism of his San Francisco concert
and ot Bowie as one of the great rock performers.
I. too. have always been impressed with Bow
ie's theatrical ingenuity in costume and in stage
scenery. Yet his current concert tour shows most
clearly that he. as a true performer, doesn't need
the kind of gimmickry Gates was looking for.
The "straight" image Bowie began to cultivate
during his "Diamond Dogs" tour two years ago
has been absorbed by most of his fans and results
in the slickly-stylized renditions which Gates
mistakenly sees as reflecting "boredom."
As Bowie has changed with each album and
concert tour, his older pieces can hardly demand a
resurrection of his past image. Yet they can de
mand and do achieve the continual Bowie mag
netism — something that impressed me more than
what could have been a mere return to the "good
old days."
Distorted idea
Gates also launches from a distorted idea of
Bowie's "Frank Sinatra" ambition, to say he
craves the "mass appeal" of Sinatra.
Bowie's goal is. in fact, to become a multi-media
performer much in the tradition of a Judy Garland
or a Frank Sinatra, meaning that through new
endeavors — such as film — he hopes his person
ality as a performer will become more important
than his appeal in any one area of activity. David
Bowie has certainly never been one to modify his
style to fit the tastes of the general public and this
is still not his goal.

Gates also came to the concert anticipating con
tempt on Bowie's part for San Francisco audi
ences. It is true the Ziggy Stardust tour of several
vers ago produced such a poor turnout in San
Francisco that Bowie did not return there for his
following tour, but this apparently did not affect
his recent and well-attended San Francisco per
formance. contrary to Gates' implications.
The upsetting film. "Le Ghien Andalue" is
being shown at every stop on the tour, including
Los Angeles — a city which Bowie reputably likes
— for the apparent reason that Bowie's soon-to
be-released film also contains some surreal ele
ments. not out of contempt for any audience. The
music, from his latest Station-to-Station album
was in fact written for the film.
Stage departure
Gates also cites Bowie's departure from stage
during instrumentals as a sign of contempt. Yet
this has also been done at other cities. Rather than
showing a lack of enthusiasm, it has purposefully
provided a spotlight for some of the members of
his back-up band.
Nor has he performed for more than one hour,
45 minutes at any stop. In San Francisco this in
cluded a second encore, rare for a Bill Graham
production.
The review s imagined slights toward San
Francisco are simply not valid.
Gat«s apparently came to the concert with a lot
of preconceived notions about Bowie's image, his
ambitionsand his prejudices. Bowie deserves bet
ter—at least something of an objective appraisal

I. too. have always been impressed with Bow
ie's theatrical ingenuity in costume and in stage
scenery. Yet his current concert tour shows most
clearly that he. as a true performer, doesn't need
the kind of gimmickry Gates was looking for.
The "straight" image Bowie began to cultivate
during his "Diamond Dogs" tour two years ago
has been absorbed by most of his fans and results
in the slickly-stylized renditions which Gates
mistakenly sees as reflecting "boredom."
As Bowie has changed with each album and
concert tour, his older pieces can hardly demand a
resurrection of his past image. Yet they can de
mand and do achieve the continual Bowie mag
netism — something that impressed me more than
what could have been a mere return to the "good
old days."
Distorted idea
Gates also launches from a distorted idea of
Bowie's "Frank Sinatra" ambition, to say he
craves the "mass appeal" of Sinatra.
Bowie's goal is. in fact, to become a multi-media
performer much in the tradition of a Judy Garland
or a Frank Sinatra, meaning that through new
endeavors — such as film — he hopes his person
ality as a performer will become more important
than his appeal in any one area of activity. David
Bowie has certainly never been one to modify his
style to fit the tastes of the general public and this
is still not his goal.

Gates also came to the concert anticipating con
tempt on Bowie's part for San Francisco audi
ences. It is true the Ziggy Stardust tour of several
vers ago produced such a poor turnout in San
Francisco that Bowie did not return there for his
following tour, but this apparently did not affect
his recent and well-attended San Francisco per
formance. contrary to Gates' implications.
The upsetting film. "Le Ghien Andalue" is
being shown at every stop on the tour, including
Los Angeles — a city which Bowie reputably likes
— for the apparent reason that Bowie's soon-to
be-released film also contains some surreal ele
ments. not out of contempt for any audience. The
music, from his latest Station-to-Station album
was in fact written for the film.
Stage departure
Gates also cites Bowie's departure from stage
during instrumentals as a sign of contempt. Yet
this has also been done at other cities. Rather than
showing a lack of enthusiasm, it has purposefully
provided a spotlight for some of the members of
his back-up band.
Nor has he performed for more than one hour,
45 minutes at any stop. In San Francisco this in
cluded a second encore, rare for a Bill Graham
production.
The review s imagined slights toward San
Francisco are simply not valid.
Gat«s apparently came to the concert with a lot
of preconceived notions about Bowie's image, his
ambitionsand his prejudices. Bowie deserves bet
ter—at least something of an objective appraisal

Is showmanship equivalent to glitter and gim
mickry? Elian Gates' Feb. 10 Daily review of
David Bowie's Feb. 6 concert shows such preoc
cupation with Bowie's past image that it denies
the sheer dynamism of his San Francisco concert
and ot Bowie as one of the great rock performers.
