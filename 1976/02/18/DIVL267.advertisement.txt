Carlo Rossi Vin Rose
Beautiful pink c010r... beautiful taste
Salute:
Many people have asked me what gives Carlo Rossi
Vin Rose of California its beautiful pink color. The
answer, very simply, is that the color and the good taste
come from the grapes themselves. But surprisingly, the
best grapes for giving Carlo Rossi Vin Rose its fresh
clean taste and brilliant pink color are not pink . . .
they are dark purple.
You see, the color in the grapes is only in the
skins. When the grapes are first crushed the juice is
almost clear. But, by letting the juice stay in contact
with the skins for just the right amount of time after
crushing, the skin color tints the wine pink. Too little
time and the color is too pale, too long and you'd have
red wine. Just a kiss, then the skins go their way and
the juice goes on to be Vin Rose.
Try a glass of Carlo Rossi Vin Rose. You'll be
amazed at the beautiful pink color. But more importantly
you'll discover a taste you'll enjoy glass after glass.
Ciao,
J Carlo Rossi Vineyards, Modesto, Stanislaus County, California
