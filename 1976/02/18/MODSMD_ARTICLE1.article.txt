A nighttime shuttle-bus will begin
service next Monday, if funds for the
experimental program are approved
later this week, according to Donald
Winbigler, chairman of the University
Committee on Parking and Transpor
tation.
The committee recommended the
evening time shuttle to Robert Au
gsburger, vice president for Business
and Finance, who must approve use of
the funds from the Parking and Trans
portation Fund for its operation. Au
gsburger was unavailable for com
ment, but Winbigler said, "The com
mittee is operating on the assumption
that it (the recommendation) will be
accepted."
Under the proposal, the two "Mar
guerite" buses now running between
Escondido Village and the Stanford
Shopping Center during the day.
would be used for a "loop" route
around the campus Monday through
Friday, according to Assoc. Planner
Steve Schmidt.

Business will run from 7 p.m.-12:30
a.m. starting their loop at the "top of
the oval" on Serra street in front of the
quad. The buses will run in opposite
directions with the round-trip for each
bus taking about 20 minutes, Schmidt
said.
40 stops
"There will be about 40 stops, but
people will be able to hail the bus or
request a stop at any stop sign," he
added.
The evening shuttle experiment will
end April 30. During May, the plan
ning office will evaluate the evening
shuttle and decide if it will be con

tinued next year, Schmidt said.
An evening shuttle bus which ran
last year was criticized for taking a
long time to get across campus. ASSU
Sen. Sara Alfadl, who helped de
velop the schedule and route for the
evening shuttle, said the proposed
shuttle would be faster than last year's.
"We will be trying to avoid last
year's complaints by speeding up the
travel time. The (new) route is two
thirds as long as last year's and there
will be two buses running in opposite
directions, instead of only one bus
(like last year)," she explained.
Short wait
Schmidt estimated that with both
buses in operation, the wait at any stop
would be no longer than 10 minutes.
He added that the proposed shuttle

would be more attractive because it
would run on a regular schedule along
a fixed route. Copies of the schedule,
which will be completed this week,
will be distributed to residences and
will be available on the buses, he said.
Schmidt said he was unsure of the
demand for an evening shuttle bus but
that this experiment was,an inexpen
sive way to find out. The experiment
will cost $4000 and will be financed
out of the Parking and Transportation
Fund, which is composed of revenue
from the sale of parking stickers.
Alfadl said she felt there was a de

mand for the shuttle.
"The people who will use the shut
tle are people who need to get to the
other end of campus in a hurry or don't
want to ride their bikes at night," she
said. "It's a trial plan and if people are
aware of it, they will use it."
Director of Public Safety Marvin
Herrington said he did not know if
there would be a large demand for the
proposed evening shuttle. He said the
best thing to do would be to "try it and
see. If people ride it, it's worthwhile."
Schmidt said he felt the major
reason for the evening shuttle was a
concern for student safety.
However, Alfadl said that she felt
the evening shuttle was "basically a
transportation issue, not a safety issue.
The interest of safety can best be met
by more lighting and more (police)
patrols.
She noted that as many of the
scheduled stops as possible have been
located at or near fire call boxes be
cause of the vulnerability of persons
waiting for the bus.


TWILIGHT TRANSPORT—An experimental evening
shuttle-bus system may be initiated this coming Monday.
It will pass near virtually every residential area and

library. Stops will be located near fire alarms for added
security.
