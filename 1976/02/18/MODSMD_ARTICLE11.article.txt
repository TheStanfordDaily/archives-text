# Foreign bribes necessary for business
## 
### 
Within the last few months, revelations
that American business has used its money
to influence public officials at home and
abroad have created scandals.
Gulf Oil, Burroughs, Exxon, Northrop
and just recently, Lockheed and Tenneco,
are only a few of the companies implicated.
According to a study by the Library of Con
gress. payments at home and abroad of more
than $250 million were disclosed in 1975 by
some 25 American companies.
Payments to U.S. officials are illegal.
Clearly the companies and officials making
such contributions should be prosecuted
under U.S. law.
But for contributions abroad it is a diffe
rent matter, as payments to foreign politi
cians do not violate U.S. law.
Payments legal
Corporate political contributions are
legal in many foreign countires, under cer
tain circumstances. And even countries
whose law prohibits political contributions
often fail to make an effort to ferret out vio
lators.
Further complicating the issue of foreign
bribes is the fact that the recent disclosures
have toppled many of the politicians ac
cepting U.S. companies' funds. Politicos in
the Honduras and in Italy were pressured
into resigning and others are sure to follow
in their wake.
As E.H. Boullioun, the president of Boe
ing Commercial Airplane Co. (a firm now
under investigation for its political con
tributions), said in an Associated Press in
terview last week, "This is hurting the
foreign people who are getting themselves
involved. They are going to be saying
'there's an American company getting us in
trouble. " Arguments like this and the fact
that many people feel bribes to foreign
politicians violate ethical standards, exp
lain much of the recent outcry against such

contributions. While the result of this out
cry has been to justifiably call for a reexami
nation of the structure of international bus
iness deals, these critics have failed to con
sider a number of corollary issues.
Payments necessary
Businesses which contributed to foreign
politicians argue such payments were

necessary to successfully compete with
foreign companies vying for the same con
tracts. This argument has considerable
merit.
According to Sunday's New York Times,
"No government official has yet produced a
counter-argument to the consistent
rationale of corporate executives that unless
they make payoffs, they will lose con
tracts to foreign firms offering similar
bribes."
Because political bribes are literally a way
of life in many nations of the world, it is
absurd to impose restrictions on American
companies' ability to compete for foreign
contracts â€” especially considering many
U.S. firms (such as Lockheed, for example)
have practically been kept alive through
foreign sales.
Remain competitive
Only by opting for such a course can U.S.
business remain competitive with foreign
companies. And if U.S. companies do in
fringe the laws of foreign countries, it
should be up to the concerned nations to

deal with the crime.
U.S. companies'foreign bribes should not
come under the purview of U.S. courts until
there is a U.S. statute prescribing wrong
doing for such activities.
Even if foreign bribes are permitted under
U.S. law, there still remains the question of
how companies should report these pay
ments.
Lockheed, which currently is engaged in
a major shake-up over its just-disclosed
foreign bribes, maintains that disclosing the
identity of the recipients of bribes would
jeopardize the company's business wth the
foreign countries. This argument is con
vincing.
Inform SEC
However, that doesn't preclude com
panies being forced to inform the Securities
and Exchange Commission of their foreign
deals; the companies need only tell their
shareholders the sums involved. Some
audit of a company's foreign expenditures
must be conducted, but these procedures
should not hinder the company's foreign
business operations.
The ultimate solution to the multitude of
foreign bribes is a pact to establish an inter
national code of business ethics, such as
Sen. Charles Percy (R-Ill.) has proposed. For
the problem is not merely an American one,
but concerns all the world's businesses.
Yet, whether such an international moral
code can be established is still open to ques
tion. In any event, establishng such a code
would involve considerable time and effort.
Until that day, U.S. companies operating
abroad should continue to play the game by
home-court rules; any other arrangement
would have serious consequences on the
health of American business.
