'Visible' profs
I have no opinion one way or
the other on the decision not to
tenure Asst. Sociology Prof.
Anne McMahon. However,
Sociology Prof. Morris Zel
ditch's argument that national
visibility is the prime criterion
for achieving tenure in major
universities brings into the open
an aspect of academic life which
has not gained the public atten
tion it deserves.
Since many persons enter the
academic profession with the
hope they will be judged "objec
tively" for their research and
teaching, they are Pften sur
prised and disillusioned to learn
not only that teaching does not
count for much, but that even
their research, no matter how
original and exciting in its im
plications, does not achieve vis
ibility until the best known per
sons in the field choose to
acknowledge its importance.

Unfortunately, the intrinsic
quality of one's work is only one
factor among several in gaining
this acknowledgment. Other
qualities that count include such
matters as one's conviviality at
professional conventions and
one's persistence in seeking out
and cultivating those in a posi
tion to help one get a grant or
find a favorable reviewer for
one's book.
It may well be that the article
that is referred to after 20 years is
distinguished not so much for its
brilliance or usefulness as for the
fact that its author now wields
sufficient power in the field to
make it worthwhile for younger
scholars to grant him or her their
respects.
1 do not bring up these matters
to accuse academics of being evil
or corrupt, but simply to suggest
that the academic community
participates entirely in our
larger economic and social sys

tem, and that professors are sub
ject to the same ambitions and
temptations as those in less
overtly idealistic professions.
Perhaps in future tenure deci
sions we should examine the
reasons for a candidate's visibil
ity, or lack of it, with a more
skeptical eye.

TM's effectiveness
It is evident from reading Rick
Williams' Feb. 10 Daily column
that he missed an excellent tele
vision show on transcendental
meditation (TM) produced by
the Nova series for public TV 7 .
Among the many interesting
points which were raised, the
following stick out in my mind:
—An independent researcher
recently conducted tests on

TM's effectiveness. The results
were published without his con
sent by the TM organization and
distributed widely in public
relations pamphlets. The group
altered his data to arrive at diffe
rent conclusions than he had ar
rived at, and he is apparently
considering court action.
—Very recent studies by a
group of researchers in England
conclude it is impossible at this
early stage to distinguish the ef
fects of TM from the effects of
listening to music or even sim
ple relaxation.
A society in constant motion is
bound to forget, among other
things, how to rest. Relaxation
should not have to be strived
after as a conscious goal in itself.
It should be the natural by
product of a life lived moder
ately and reasonably.
