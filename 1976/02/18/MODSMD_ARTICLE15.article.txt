An avid "Upstairs, Downstairs" fini, I sometimes spend my entire
Monday lunch period humming the Masterpiece Theater theme
song. Imagine my dismay, then, when the familiar trumpet ditty
turned up on the Olympic coverage 1 . Please, Hug Me. name that
tune! -V.T.H.D.
Your melody malady seems to be contagious. Music Department
faculty members exploded in song at the mere mention of the tune
that so plagues you. After calming down, they told us that it is a
"trumpet voluntary," attributed to a musician named Henry Pur
cell. Purcell, a 17th century English organist and composer, is
better know for his operas.
However, the music was not written by Purcell but by a lesser
known contemporary of his, Jeremiah Clark. The music, long
known as "Purcell'sTrumpet Voluntary." is really not th.it at all. So
the next time you turn on your intellectual soap opera, don't torget
to comment astutely, "Ahhhh, Clark's Trumpet Voluntary! Your
friends at Whitman will like you better for it.

Why has Stanford dumped leaves in the vacant lot next to the
Escondidn gardens, and than very carefully spread them out un
iformly over the ground:* -R.A.
That area is being "disced," according to Andy Anderson,
grounds manager. The process, which reduces weeds and returns
nutrients to the soil, involves cutting into the surface of the ground
and then turning it over, mixing the soil with the leaves.

Pray tell, what is the new, hip. non-sexist greeting for business
letters? -A.S.
Cynthia Davis, director of the Center for Research on Women
suggest one of the following: "Dear Colleague," "Dear Friends" or
"Dear Madam/Sir" (or vice versa). It you don't mind sounding
quasi-Quakerish, try "Dear Gentlepersons."

Can turtles ever survive without their shells? (Mine certainly
didn't) --D.E.
A spokesman for the California Academia of Sciences in the City
said that a turtle in the buff has a very slim chance of survival. Not
only does his shell serve as protection, but it is also attached to his
backbone.
"In the wild, it would be impossible," he said. "Under controlled
conditions it would be extremely unlikely, just extreme to the
extreme."
