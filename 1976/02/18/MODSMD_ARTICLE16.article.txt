# Ice cream: what you see is not what you get
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
This may come us a shock to
you, but very few of us have had
real ice cream more than a few
times in our lives. Your first
question may very well be,
"Then just what is it that I've
been taking out of the freezer at
the supermarket all these
years?"
It's what the dairy industry
has convinced a gullible public
to believe is ice cream. But it's
not. Because real ice cream, the
kind that was consumed before
1927, is a far cry from the
chemical-laden, air-injected,
synthetic garbage we've been
stuffing our faces with all this
time.
The man in a frenzy over the
proliferation of this plastic
mock-up of ice cream is Gaylord
W. Willis, 20 percent owner of
and 100 percent supplier to Old
Uncle Gaylord's Ice Cream Par
lours (one of which opened on
Emerson St. in Palo Alto last
month).
A self-proclaimed "ice cream
revolutionary," Willis has
started what is most likely the
most unorthodox way of man
ufacturing and selling ice cream
the modern United States has
ever seen.
What went wrong
To appreciate what Willis is
doing, one must understand
what went wrong with ice cream
about 50 years ago. Ice cream
was irrevocably changed in that
banner year of 1927 when the
air-inject freezer was invented. It
became possible to manufacture

ice cream less expensively, with
as much as 60 percent air.
However, air does not simply
stay in ice cream — it must lie
kept there, courtesy of chemical
stabilizers. Artificial colors and
flavorings were added to cover
up the taste of the chemicals, and
it became far more profitable to
make chemcially treated ice
cream than the real thing.
Eventually, as Willis' own
Old U nele Gaylord's Ice Cream
Hook states, "Ice cream became
the garbage dump of the dairy

industry."
It is Willis and his
small string of shops around the
Bay Area who is changing all
this. In all of the United States,
only his ice cream contains none
of the usual ingredients found in
regular ice cream made from

FREEZE FRENZY —A branch of Uncle Gaylord's. recently opened
in Palo Alto, is unique in its manufacture of "real" ice cream.
This may come us a shock to
you, but very few of us have had
real ice cream more than a few
times in our lives. Your first
question may very well be,
"Then just what is it that I've
been taking out of the freezer at
the supermarket all these
years?"
It's what the dairy industry
has convinced a gullible public
to believe is ice cream. But it's
not. Because real ice cream, the
kind that was consumed before
1927, is a far cry from the
chemical-laden, air-injected,
synthetic garbage we've been
stuffing our faces with all this
time.
The man in a frenzy over the
proliferation of this plastic
mock-up of ice cream is Gaylord
W. Willis, 20 percent owner of
and 100 percent supplier to Old
Uncle Gaylord's Ice Cream Par
lours (one of which opened on
Emerson St. in Palo Alto last
month).
A self-proclaimed "ice cream
revolutionary," Willis has
started what is most likely the
most unorthodox way of man
ufacturing and selling ice cream
the modern United States has
ever seen.
What went wrong
To appreciate what Willis is
doing, one must understand
what went wrong with ice cream
about 50 years ago. Ice cream
was irrevocably changed in that
banner year of 1927 when the
air-inject freezer was invented. It
became possible to manufacture

ice cream less expensively, with
as much as 60 percent air.
However, air does not simply
stay in ice cream — it must lie
kept there, courtesy of chemical
stabilizers. Artificial colors and
flavorings were added to cover
up the taste of the chemicals, and
it became far more profitable to
make chemcially treated ice
cream than the real thing.
Eventually, as Willis' own
Old U nele Gaylord's Ice Cream
Hook states, "Ice cream became
the garbage dump of the dairy

industry."
It is Willis and his
small string of shops around the
Bay Area who is changing all
this. In all of the United States,
only his ice cream contains none
of the usual ingredients found in
regular ice cream made from
