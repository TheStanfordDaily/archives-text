## Lan, Wainwright enthrall Maples 
### Marc Strassman 
"Sing to us," shouted one
eager fan from the floor of
Maples Pavilion Sunday night
while Janis lan was patiently
answering another admirer's
question about her guitar.
"It has a solid mahogany
neck," she was saying, then re
sponded to the shout, admitting
that "she was about to get
around to that."
She chatted with the audience
a little while longer, then sang
her second encore, a lovely and
sensitive ballad that was dis
tinguishable from the dozen
other numbers she had played
during her 90-minute set mainly
because she seemed to be some
what more involved in it.
Which is not to say that every
thing during her act was low-key
or without flaw. Twice while she
was playing at the piano during
the middle part of her act, she
stopped a few bars into the piece,
upset because someone in her
band was goofing up.
Trouble
The first time, the trouble was
apparently quickly straightened
out and she carried on without
further delay. The second time,
however, she was about to give it
up and not do the song. But
clamoring from the audience
made her change her mind, and
she did the song after all.
Her sensitivity and attentive
ness to the audience was as
tounding. When someone in the
audience would yell a comment
or song suggestion (something
unintelligible), lan would lean
into the microphone and ask,
"What?" Usually lots more
people would reply, and the
singer-songwriter would never
get an answer to her question.
There was one song that in
volved a certain amount of
energy — her second number.
Prefaced with a long, rambling
disquisition on Annette
Funicello, Southern California
beaches and men as sex objects,
the song was lively, especially in
its upbeat and vigorous man
ifesto of a refrain: "Wake up! I've
got news for you; we don't need
you anymore!"
Good-sized crowd
The audience, good-sized but
by no means packing the Pavil
ion, was almost entirely young

and non-Stanford.
They responded warmly to
what lan gave them: they
laughed at her patter, sat silently
through the lyrics of longing and
loss, appeared attentive to her
descriptions of the subtleties
and ambiguities of intense in
terpersonal relationships, ap
preciated and applauded her
sincerity and openness. It was a
case of pure symbiosis.
Loudon Wainwright 111, the
opening act, had some worth
while things to say behind the
humorous facade of his dozen
songs.
Loneliness was a frequent
theme. He sang of deciding not
to call a friend anymore because
she was always out drinking, of
hard days for Jesus in Jerusalem,
of the need for honesty around
babies (who see through you no
matter how much learning you
have).
