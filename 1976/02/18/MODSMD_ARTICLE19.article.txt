# ACT's 'Equus' an excellent play
## 
### BOB Henry 
The biggest hit of recent Lon
don and Broadway theatrical
seasons has come to San Fran
cisco. The American Conservat
ory Theatre's (ACT) production
of Peter Shaffer's brilliant Equus
copies its predecessors in almost
every visual detail and is a very,
very good show, but does not
match the impact and intensity
of the London and New York

versions.
The story concerns a boy's
blinding of five horses and a
psychiatrist's efforts to dig out
the motivation behind the act.
Many different meanings and in
terpretations have been offered,
but the central theme to me
seems to be the conflict betwen a
passionate and non-passionate
life.
The psychiatrist believes that
by curing the boy he will create
another of the emotionless
robots that dominate society.
Sparse set
Director William Ball uses the
same sparse, wooden set as the
previous productions. Multi
purpose benches and railings on
a rotatable plaform sit on the
stage, alongside a pair of small
bleachers for part of the audi

ence.
The naked, open set gives the
play a feeling of stark reality, and
transforms readily from horse
stable to home to doctor's office
to porno movie house.
Peter Donat (Cyrano in ACT's
Cyrano) has returned to the
company to be Martin Dysart,
the psychiatrist, and gives
another strong performance. His
Dysart seems a little too ani
mated in a few instances — I be
lieve the character needs to
transmit a certain devitalized,
neurotic feeling — but he creates
many powerful moments.
Newcomer Daniel Zippi is the
troubled youth, and gives a
strong, convincing portrayal.
Smooth pudding
Ball moves the cast very well,
and outside of one error, where

Dysart's dream of butchering
children becomes inapprop
riately humorous, blends the bits
of comedy smoothly into the
dramatic pudding.
F. Mitchell Dana does the
lighting, and he makes a crucial
mistake of exposing too much of
the stage during the final scenes.
His excessive illumination
takes away much of the effect of
the frightening yet somehow at
tractive shiny-steel horses'
heads, as well as the boy's adora
tion and destruction of his quad
rupled masters.
In short, ACT has an excellent
play. The production of Shaffer's
amazing script — which is real
"theatre" as opposed to "litera
ture" — should be seen by any
one who has the opportunity to
do so.

riately humorous, blends the bits
of comedy smoothly into the
dramatic pudding.
F. Mitchell Dana does the
lighting, and he makes a crucial
mistake of exposing too much of
the stage during the final scenes.
His excessive illumination
takes away much of the effect of
the frightening yet somehow at
tractive shiny-steel horses'
heads, as well as the boy's adora
tion and destruction of his quad
rupled masters.
In short, ACT has an excellent
play. The production of Shaffer's
amazing script — which is real
"theatre" as opposed to "litera
ture" — should be seen by any
one who has the opportunity to
do so.
The biggest hit of recent Lon
don and Broadway theatrical
seasons has come to San Fran
cisco. The American Conservat
ory Theatre's (ACT) production
of Peter Shaffer's brilliant Equus
copies its predecessors in almost
every visual detail and is a very,
very good show, but does not
match the impact and intensity
of the London and New York

versions.
The story concerns a boy's
blinding of five horses and a
psychiatrist's efforts to dig out
the motivation behind the act.
Many different meanings and in
terpretations have been offered,
but the central theme to me
seems to be the conflict betwen a
passionate and non-passionate
life.
The psychiatrist believes that
by curing the boy he will create
another of the emotionless
robots that dominate society.
Sparse set
Director William Ball uses the
same sparse, wooden set as the
previous productions. Multi
purpose benches and railings on
a rotatable plaform sit on the
stage, alongside a pair of small
bleachers for part of the audi

ence.
The naked, open set gives the
play a feeling of stark reality, and
transforms readily from horse
stable to home to doctor's office
to porno movie house.
Peter Donat (Cyrano in ACT's
Cyrano) has returned to the
company to be Martin Dysart,
the psychiatrist, and gives
another strong performance. His
Dysart seems a little too ani
mated in a few instances — I be
lieve the character needs to
transmit a certain devitalized,
neurotic feeling — but he creates
many powerful moments.
Newcomer Daniel Zippi is the
troubled youth, and gives a
strong, convincing portrayal.
Smooth pudding
Ball moves the cast very well,
and outside of one error, where

Dysart's dream of butchering
children becomes inapprop
riately humorous, blends the bits
of comedy smoothly into the
dramatic pudding.
F. Mitchell Dana does the
lighting, and he makes a crucial
mistake of exposing too much of
the stage during the final scenes.
