# Hearst describes Hibernia hold-up
## 
### Roy Johnson Steve Hefter 
SAN FRANCISCO — Patricia Hearst
emotionally continued her testimony
before the five-man, seven-woman
jury yesterday, describing how the
Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA)
abused her physically and prepared
her for the holdup of the Hibernia Bank
which occurred last April 15, 1974.
Two films made during the robbery
were shown to the court. One film fo
cused on Hearst's actions which de
fense attorney F. Lee Bailey used to
show that Hearst made two controver
sial movements. At one point in the
film, Bailey noted that she looked
down suddenly at her weapon as if to
check it. Later, her mouth dropped
open suddenly, then closed again, he
pointed out.
After the film, Hearst testified that
shedid not know if her semi-automatic
weapon was loaded during the rob
bery. She denied telling a bank cus
tomer to "shut up or I'll blow your
mother-fucking head off," as a pro
secution witness had earlier testified.
Baily told the court that Hearst
opened her mouth only once. She tes
tified that it was at that moment when
she turned and saw two men getting
shot. "All I remember is turning and
seeing this man's coat fly open and
him falling to the floor," Hearst said.
The look, she testified, was one of
shock.
With her voice cracking while on the
verge of tears, Hearst also described
how she was confronted in the closet
by SLA member Willie Wolfe.
"He made me lie down on the
floor . . ." She paused and after a mo
ment of silence she finished, "we had
sexual intercourse."
Hearst also said that a week later
SLA leader Donald (Cinque) DeFreeze
confronted her in the same manner.

Hearst described the SLA group as a
group that believed violence and kil
ling to be the only means of helping
"the oppressed people." She said that
she became so afraid before the rob
bery, that when DeFreeze offered her
freedom, she did not accept it because
she feared for her life. She said she felt
they would not let her leave alive be
cause of what she knew about the SLA.
At a press conference following yes
terday's session, Bailey said that he
thought Hearst was a good witness.
"She's a lot more collected today," he
said. "When we found her in Sep
tember, she was utterly confused and
(she) would have been impossible to
comprehend."

SAN FRANCISCO — Patricia Hearst
emotionally continued her testimony
before the five-man, seven-woman
jury yesterday, describing how the
Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA)
abused her physically and prepared
her for the holdup of the Hibernia Bank
which occurred last April 15, 1974.
Two films made during the robbery
were shown to the court. One film fo
cused on Hearst's actions which de
fense attorney F. Lee Bailey used to
show that Hearst made two controver
sial movements. At one point in the
film, Bailey noted that she looked
down suddenly at her weapon as if to
check it. Later, her mouth dropped
open suddenly, then closed again, he
pointed out.
After the film, Hearst testified that
shedid not know if her semi-automatic
weapon was loaded during the rob
bery. She denied telling a bank cus
tomer to "shut up or I'll blow your
mother-fucking head off," as a pro
secution witness had earlier testified.
Baily told the court that Hearst
opened her mouth only once. She tes
tified that it was at that moment when
she turned and saw two men getting
shot. "All I remember is turning and
seeing this man's coat fly open and
him falling to the floor," Hearst said.
The look, she testified, was one of
shock.
With her voice cracking while on the
verge of tears, Hearst also described
how she was confronted in the closet
by SLA member Willie Wolfe.
"He made me lie down on the
floor . . ." She paused and after a mo
ment of silence she finished, "we had
sexual intercourse."
Hearst also said that a week later
SLA leader Donald (Cinque) DeFreeze
confronted her in the same manner.

Hearst described the SLA group as a
group that believed violence and kil
ling to be the only means of helping
"the oppressed people." She said that
she became so afraid before the rob
bery, that when DeFreeze offered her
freedom, she did not accept it because
she feared for her life. She said she felt
they would not let her leave alive be
cause of what she knew about the SLA.
At a press conference following yes
terday's session, Bailey said that he
thought Hearst was a good witness.
"She's a lot more collected today," he
said. "When we found her in Sep
tember, she was utterly confused and
(she) would have been impossible to
comprehend."
