# Black filmmakers confer
## 
### Russell Stockard 
The skies were gray outside
but the headgear shone brightly
inside Wheeler Auditorum at
UC-Berkeley Feb. 7. as current
and former stars, directors, pro
ducers, writers and film histo
rians gathered in a symposium
on black film.
It was a day of dos, don'ts and
musts as the black filmmakers
shared their observations about
the plight of blacks in filmmak
ing today and the historical high
spots of the industry, such as the
famed black director-producer
distributor, Oscar Micheaux,
after whom the annual event in
the East Bay is named.
Prominent on the panel was
Clarence Muse who, despite his
82 years, re-created a picture of
what it was like to be pursued by
a director during Hollywood's
golden era. Muse's dashiki was
the only one present, suggesting
that his age has not diluted his
flamboyance and commitment
to his blackness.
Even though he and his con
temporary Ivan Dixon went hat

less on the panel, actor-producer
Brock Peters (Fix e on the Black
Hand Side) wears many hats.
Peters replaced his filmmaker's
hat with that of a potential film
distributor as he recounted the
evolution of the Hollywood film
industry from a monolith where
moguls controlled every aspect
of filmmaking, including dis
tribution.
Old theories
Despite the application of an
titrust laws to the film studios to
break up their unified control,
Peters said film distributors still
behave as though the old
theories continue to reign, and
therefore turn their backs on
black films for fear that they may
be "inflammatory."
Peters said fear is "an all
pervasive force" in the industry.
Such fear prevented the wide
distribution of producer Dixon's
The Spook Who Sat by the
Door,according to the star of the
highly acclaimed film. Nothing
But a Man.
Dixon noted that blacks can
succeed in getting a film in the
can, only to experience a cold
shoulder from distributors.
Dixon said he felt that The Spook
Who Sat by the Door would not
be well received by the estab
lishment because it scrutinized

the intelligence community
years before the current CIA re
velations.
Dixon also said that much of
Micheaux's success as a
filmmaker (he worked in the
years between the two world
wars) resulted from the exis
tence of segregation which in
sured distribution through a
network of black-oriented theat
ers in the South.
Hlaxploitation
Also appearing on the panel
was novelist John O. Killens who
sported a blue Chinese cap as he
inveighed against "hlaxploita
tion" films saying that the long
lines outside the box offices of
such movies should be turned
into "picket lines."
Fellow writer Lonnie Elder,
creator of the widely praised
script for Sounder defended hi§
low output of film scripts on th»
grounds that he "fights against
the dos and don'ts of what got>£
on in the film industry." As he it
result, said Elder, he doesn't get
a chance to be "noble" too often.
The panel was hosted by Carol
Ward Allen, Laney College black
film historian. The Black
Filmmakers Hall of Fame events
are held every year during Black
History Week in February.
