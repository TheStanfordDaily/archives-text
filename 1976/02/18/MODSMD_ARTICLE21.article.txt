Ford revamps intelligence agency
WASHINGTON — President Ford announced a reor
ganization of the beleaguered U.S. intelligence commun
ity yesterday which he said strikes a middle ground bet
ween the need for first-class intelligence capability and
protection of the rights of U.S. citizens.
Management of foreign intelligence will be placed
under a new committee to be headed by CIA Director
George Bush, the President said in a nationally broadcast
news conference.
He named a new, three-member committee of private
citizens to oversee intelligence and revamped the sec
ret Forty Committee which makes covert intelligence re
commendations. The Forty Committee is being renamed
the Operations Advisory Group, an aide said later.
The President's plan did not include many of the re
commendations made by the House Intelligence Commit
tee, which proposed that presidents report covert opera
tions to a House committee within 48 hours and that
covert paramilitary operations be outlawed.
Palestinian student kills two
BEIRUT — An expelled Palestinian student carrying a
pistol and two hand grenades assassinated an American
dean and his Lebanese colleague yesterday at the Ameri
can University of Beirut.
A university spokesman identified the dead as Dean of
Students Robert Najemy, 56, born in Worcester, Mass., in
a family of Lebanese origin and engineering dean
Raymond Ghosn, a 55-year-old Lebanese. Both were shot
by a pistol at close range.
The 25-year-old killer took a dozen university officials
hostage and threatened to blow them up unless he got a
bus or helicopter to take him to the Lebanese-Israel border
where, he said, he wanted to make a suicide raid on the
Jewish state, police said.
Prof. Najib Abou Haidar, a medical school teacher and
former Lebanese education minister, talked the assassin
into releasing his hostages unharmed and giving up to the
Palestinian guerrilla police. It took them three hours of
tense negotiations.
U.S. breaks off Indian aid talks
NEW DELHI — The United States, unhappy about
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's accusations that
Washington is trying to topple her from power, has broken
off talks on resumption of U.S. economic aid to India,
authoritative sources said yesterday.
There was no official confirmation of the report.
The discussions were suspended under a U.S. policy
decision that followed Gandhi's declaration to her party
convention in late December that the United States is

carrying out a Chilean-style destabilization campaign
here, the sources said.
As a result, the sources added, there is almost no chance
that U.S. economic aid to India will be resumed or consi
dered further during the current fiscal year.
"We've reached another nadir in Indo-American rela
tions," said one U.S. diplomat.
Europeans to recognize MPLA?
PARIS — Major European countries prepared yesterday
to follow the lead of France and swiftly recognize the
Soviet-backed Popular Movement (MPLA) as the legiti
mate government of Angola following its battlefield vic
tories.
The European Common Market's expected action is
likely to trigger similar moves around the world, but the
United States, which supported rival factions in the civil
war, was expected to delay any decision on recognizing
the MPLA regime.
State Department spokesman John Trattner, asked if the
United States would extend recognition, said, "I don't
think we are at that point.
"I don't think it has been established who is in charge or
who controls the situation on the ground in Angola,"
Trattner said. "And while Cuban forces, supported by
Soviet arms, are still fighting there, I do not think it is
appropriate for that recognition to be considered."
Italy seeks Lockheed Agents'
ROME — Italian police spread a dragnet yesterday for a
lawyer and a businesswoman on arrest warrants charging
them with being corruption agents in the intercontinental
payoffs of Lockheed Aircraft Corp. The couple was be
lieved to have left Italy.
The warrants, issued by State Attorney Ilario Martella,
were against Ovidio Lefebvre Dovidio di Balsorano de
Clunieres, a lawyer descended from French nobility, and
business executive Maria Fava.
Lefebvre was identified in a 1970 Lockheed memoran
dum as the agent slipping $50,000 to an unnamed defense
minister of Italy for the sale of 14 C-130 Hercules cargo
planes.
Today's weather

Rain likely at times tonight and tomorrow. Little tempera

both days in the mid 50s to low 60s. Variable winds 10 to
15 mph becoming light southerly today.

Palestinian student kills two
BEIRUT — An expelled Palestinian student carrying a
pistol and two hand grenades assassinated an American
dean and his Lebanese colleague yesterday at the Ameri
can University of Beirut.
A university spokesman identified the dead as Dean of
Students Robert Najemy, 56, born in Worcester, Mass., in
a family of Lebanese origin and engineering dean
Raymond Ghosn, a 55-year-old Lebanese. Both were shot
by a pistol at close range.
The 25-year-old killer took a dozen university officials
hostage and threatened to blow them up unless he got a
bus or helicopter to take him to the Lebanese-Israel border
where, he said, he wanted to make a suicide raid on the
Jewish state, police said.
Prof. Najib Abou Haidar, a medical school teacher and
former Lebanese education minister, talked the assassin
into releasing his hostages unharmed and giving up to the
Palestinian guerrilla police. It took them three hours of
tense negotiations.
U.S. breaks off Indian aid talks
NEW DELHI — The United States, unhappy about
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's accusations that
Washington is trying to topple her from power, has broken
off talks on resumption of U.S. economic aid to India,
authoritative sources said yesterday.
There was no official confirmation of the report.
The discussions were suspended under a U.S. policy
decision that followed Gandhi's declaration to her party
convention in late December that the United States is

carrying out a Chilean-style destabilization campaign
here, the sources said.
As a result, the sources added, there is almost no chance
that U.S. economic aid to India will be resumed or consi
dered further during the current fiscal year.
"We've reached another nadir in Indo-American rela
tions," said one U.S. diplomat.
Europeans to recognize MPLA?
PARIS — Major European countries prepared yesterday
to follow the lead of France and swiftly recognize the
Soviet-backed Popular Movement (MPLA) as the legiti
mate government of Angola following its battlefield vic
tories.
The European Common Market's expected action is
likely to trigger similar moves around the world, but the
United States, which supported rival factions in the civil
war, was expected to delay any decision on recognizing
the MPLA regime.
State Department spokesman John Trattner, asked if the
United States would extend recognition, said, "I don't
think we are at that point.
"I don't think it has been established who is in charge or
who controls the situation on the ground in Angola,"
Trattner said. "And while Cuban forces, supported by
Soviet arms, are still fighting there, I do not think it is
appropriate for that recognition to be considered."
Italy seeks Lockheed Agents'
ROME — Italian police spread a dragnet yesterday for a
lawyer and a businesswoman on arrest warrants charging
them with being corruption agents in the intercontinental
payoffs of Lockheed Aircraft Corp. The couple was be
lieved to have left Italy.
The warrants, issued by State Attorney Ilario Martella,
were against Ovidio Lefebvre Dovidio di Balsorano de
Clunieres, a lawyer descended from French nobility, and
business executive Maria Fava.
Lefebvre was identified in a 1970 Lockheed memoran
dum as the agent slipping $50,000 to an unnamed defense
minister of Italy for the sale of 14 C-130 Hercules cargo
planes.

Ford revamps intelligence agency
WASHINGTON — President Ford announced a reor
ganization of the beleaguered U.S. intelligence commun

protection of the rights of U.S. citizens.
Management of foreign intelligence will be placed

George Bush, the President said in a nationally broadcast
news conference.
He named a new, three-member committee of private
citizens to oversee intelligence and revamped the sec
ret Forty Committee which makes covert intelligence re
commendations. The Forty Committee is being renamed
the Operations Advisory Group, an aide said later.
The President's plan did not include many of the re
