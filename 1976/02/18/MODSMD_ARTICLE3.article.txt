# Lyman: Guest prof criteria too political
## 
### William Ross 
President Richard Lyman last night
criticized the ASSU Senate for using
political criteria to select three radical
guest professors.
"It is a mistake to recruit faculty on
the basis of political screening no mat
ter what group it seems to serve at the
moment." Lyman said on KZSU's
Campus Conference. "The only safe
land on which to stand is that you
don't balance this or that politically.
Then you don't have to worry about
who has got the muscle to get his
viewpoint represented."
Lyman emphasized, however, that
the administration will not interfere
with the choices, even if some alumni
threaten to withhold donations.
Lyman said he would be "very sup
rised indeed" if some alumni would
not object to the presence of Marxist
philosopher Angela Davis, radical
psychologist Claude Steiner and
Trotskyite economist Ernest Mandel
on campus if they accepted the se
nate's invitations.
Lyman noted that some alumni al
ready object to the presence of some
Marxists on the faculty.
Ile objected, however, to the senate's
contention that the appointment of the
three radicals would help expose stu
dents to the Marxist viewpoint.

"It would be a gross error if Stanford
students did not have the opportunity
to learn about Marxism," Lyman said.
"But there is a widely prevalent view
that the only people who can teach
about certain problems are those who
agree with particular viewpoints. This
is palpable nonsense."
In other Campus Conference re
marks, Lyman said that the University
has sold $18.1 million in bonds held
under the California Educational
Eacilities Act.
Lyman said that the bonds were bor
rowed at 5.5 percent interest, enabling
the University to save $650,000 com
pared to the cost of borrowing from a
commercial agency.
Lyman explained that the Act "puts
private education on a more equal foot
ing with public education" by enabl
ing it to borrow funds from the state at
a low interest rate.
According to Lyman, "there was a
total lack of government interference"
in the University's use of the borrowed
funds. Funds were used primarily for
construction.
"We expect to take out more bonds
later since we had a good experience
with the ones we just sold." Lyman
said. "But we don't plan to rush
around and borrow in this way very
often."
