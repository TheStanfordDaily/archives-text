# SLAC employes win grievance case

### Vilia Kakis 
Two employes at Stanford Linear
Accelerator's (SLAC) Health Physics
Dept. who claimed that they had been
discriminated against have won their
grievances.
During proceedings concluded in
January, arbitrator Gerald Marcus
found SLAC management had
treated the two black men, who work
as radiation monitors at SLAC, in a
racist manner.
Marcus found that "the University
did violate Article 11.D.l of the
(union-University) contract by dis
criminating against Tim Johnson and
Carlton Washington because of their
race by failing during the period bet
ween Nov. 20 and Dec. 20, 1974 to
promote each to a higher classification
or to provide training for a promotion

to a higher classification and other
wise by a continuous pattern of in
timidation and harassment extending
through said period of time."
The conduct of supervisor Art
Shore, Marcus said, reflected "an un
conscious if not conscious racist
attitude." In addition to assigning
Washington unusually menial tasks,
Shore referred to him as "boy," said
Marcus.
Richard McCall, a health physicist
also named in the grievance, did not
appear to have been intentionally
guilty of racial discrimination. Marcus
said. But, he added, "the end result
was conduct tainted by racial dis
crimination nonetheless."
One of Johnson's chief grievances
was that McCall, after having consi
dered Johnson for the position of
supervisor, designated Shore instead.
Shore, a Caucasian, had begun work
nearly two years after Johnson had
been employed and had received some
of his training from Johnson. McCall
attributed the promotional bypass to
Johnson's lack of reading skills.
In a recent United Stanford
Employees (USE) newsletter, Presi
dent Jim Berk wrote that the radiation
monitor victory "sets a precedent for
all other departments at SLAC and
Stanford," for racist and sexist prac
tices are not unique to health physics
but are "built into" every department.
Marcus ordered the following set
tlement for the employes:
—that Washington be promoted to
Technician II effective immediately
with appropriate increase in pay re
troactive to Jan. 20, 1975, and further
that he be reinstated as a radiation
monitor in the health physics group:
—that Johnson be "promoted im
mediately to the position of Techni
cian Specialist in the health physics
group with appropriate adjustment in
pay retroactive to July 1, 1975. upon
the condition that the University pro
vide him with an appropriate and
reasonable course of training related to
the performance of the duties of Tech
nician Specialist."
