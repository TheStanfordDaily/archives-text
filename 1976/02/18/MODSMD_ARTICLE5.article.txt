# Are 'hard' sciences favored?
## Professors consider status of humanities at Stanford 
### Bill Ross Bob Fikso (Last of two parts) 
While most faculty members seem to
agree that the humanities and social
sciences here are on the whole as
strong as the "hard" sciences, some
fear that the former are discriminated
against in budget cuts.
French Prof. Robert Cohn argued
that the humanities in particular are
being forced to bear the brunt of
economic belt-tightening, while the
natural and applied sciences are given
preferential treatment.
"In a pinch, the hard sciences are
what they (the administration) really
care about," Cohn said.
Robert Textor, professor of educa
tion and anthropology, fears the Uni
versity might be losing its sense of
overall direction in favor of short-run
economic concerns.
"As time goes on, as economic situa
tions tighten, there are going to be in
fluences at work in the University that
are going to be accommodative to
economics rather than to what makes a
well-rounded university," Textor said.
"I hope this doesn't happen, but I'm
afraid it might."

But Art Dept. Chairman Lorenz
Eitner sees no unfairness in the ad
ministration's treatment of the
humanities.
"Departments that are vigorous in
teaching and research and in present
ing their case to the University usually
get what they need," Eitner said.
"Whatever the defects of the admini
stration, they're not trying to kill any
thing."
German Prof. Gerald Gillespie, how
ever, asserted that the social sciences
receive the fewest budget cuts in hard
times.
Social manipulation
"The people who dominate Stanford
are social engineers and managerial
types," Gillespie said. "They are not
deeply concerned about the
humanities and natural sciences. They
view all problems as matters of social
manipulation.
"They look upon the humanities as a
pleasure product, an amusement or an
embellishment," Gillespie added.
"The natural and applied sciences are
seen only as a tool, a source of techni
cal power."
According to Gillespie, social scien
tists also control the federal agencies

that allocate grants to education and
give special preference to their own
field.
The University is no better or worse
than any other universities in the
"hegemony given to social sciences,"
he remarked.
Highest salaries
Gillespie said that a recent survey
taken by the Stanford chapter of the
American Association of University
Professors showed that social scien
tists receive the highest mean salaries
in the University.
The January Stanford Observer re
ported that salaries for humanities pro
fessors are the lowest in the Univer
sity. Several of those humanities pro
fessors interviewed, however, men
tioned a generally bad national market
for humanists as an explanation for the
relatively low salaries.
"I've felt well paid," Classics Dept.
Chairman Mark Edwards said. "Our
salaries have never seemed grossly out
of proportion. You realize, of course,
that sciences are more in demand."
New library

and social sciences mentioned a new
