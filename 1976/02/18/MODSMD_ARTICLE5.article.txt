# Are 'hard' sciences favored?
## Professors consider status of humanities at Stanford 
### Bill Ross Bob Fikso (Last of two parts) 
While most faculty members seem to
agree that the humanities and social
sciences here are on the whole as
strong as the "hard" sciences, some
fear that the former are discriminated
against in budget cuts.
French Prof. Robert Cohn argued
that the humanities in particular are
being forced to bear the brunt of
economic belt-tightening, while the
natural and applied sciences are given
preferential treatment.
"In a pinch, the hard sciences are
what they (the administration) really
care about," Cohn said.
Robert Textor, professor of educa
tion and anthropology, fears the Uni
versity might be losing its sense of
overall direction in favor of short-run
economic concerns.
"As time goes on, as economic situa
tions tighten, there are going to be in
fluences at work in the University that
are going to be accommodative to
economics rather than to what makes a
well-rounded university," Textor said.
"I hope this doesn't happen, but I'm
afraid it might."

But Art Dept. Chairman Lorenz
Eitner sees no unfairness in the ad
ministration's treatment of the
humanities.
"Departments that are vigorous in
teaching and research and in present
ing their case to the University usually
get what they need," Eitner said.
"Whatever the defects of the admini
stration, they're not trying to kill any
thing."
German Prof. Gerald Gillespie, how
ever, asserted that the social sciences
receive the fewest budget cuts in hard
times.
Social manipulation
"The people who dominate Stanford
are social engineers and managerial
types," Gillespie said. "They are not
deeply concerned about the
humanities and natural sciences. They
view all problems as matters of social
manipulation.
"They look upon the humanities as a
pleasure product, an amusement or an
embellishment," Gillespie added.
"The natural and applied sciences are
seen only as a tool, a source of techni
cal power."
According to Gillespie, social scien
tists also control the federal agencies

that allocate grants to education and
give special preference to their own
field.
The University is no better or worse
than any other universities in the
"hegemony given to social sciences,"
he remarked.
Highest salaries
Gillespie said that a recent survey
taken by the Stanford chapter of the
American Association of University
Professors showed that social scien
tists receive the highest mean salaries
in the University.
The January Stanford Observer re
ported that salaries for humanities pro
fessors are the lowest in the Univer
sity. Several of those humanities pro
fessors interviewed, however, men
tioned a generally bad national market
for humanists as an explanation for the
relatively low salaries.
"I've felt well paid," Classics Dept.
Chairman Mark Edwards said. "Our
salaries have never seemed grossly out
of proportion. You realize, of course,
that sciences are more in demand."
New library
Most professors in the humanities
and social sciences mentioned a new
main library as one of their greatest
needs.
"The library is the humanist's linear
accelerator," said Lewis Spitz, history
professor and associate dean of
humanities and sciences.
President Richard Lyman indicated
that construction on the new main lib
rary may begin next year.
According to former English Asst.
Prof. Emerson Brown, who left here
last year to teach at Vanderbilt,
humanists at other major universities
are shocked by the inadequacies of
Stanford's library.
But Dean of Graduate Studies W.
Bliss Carnochan, while admitting that
"our library has been comparatively
weaker in some areas than the quality
of our faculty," noted that "we are re
pairing the omissions of the past."

Religious Studies Dept. Chairman
William Clebsch, who is chairman of
the Academic Council Committee on
Libraries, agreed that the libraries are
"buying very aggressively."
"We have an excellent acquisition
program," Clebsch said, referring to
the library's Collection Department
Program. "Collections here have not
been as accidental as elsewhere.
They've been purposefully built.
Being lean does not necessarily mean
you are weak."
Carnochan and Arthur Bienenstock,
vice president for faculty affairs, ag
reed that the library has rarely hin
dered the University's ability to attract
top scholars.
"When we have known that gaps in
the collections are going to hurt us in
bringing in a distinguished humanist
or social scientist, we have filled in the
gaps with selective acquisitions,"
Bienenstock said.
Lacks humanists
Cohn contended, however, that the
University has failed to attract leading
humanists. He and Gillespie asserted
that the University's lack of interna
tionally known humanists contrasts
sharply with the abundance of "stars"
in the natural sciences here.
Both noted that several leading
scholars from the French and German
departments have left the University
in recent years and that senior vacan
cies have been hard to fill. But several
administrators who asked not to be
identified said that the French and
German departments have suffered
from special internal problems that
have not been present in other depart
ments.
Spitz acknowledged that the Uni
versity has "lost a few key appoint
ments" in recent years.

"We still need a few superstars in
certain areas of the humanities," Spitz
said.
Spitz and other professors
cautioned, however, that senior ap
pointments are not the only gauge of
the humanities' health.
"Whereas senior appointments
bring instant lustre and fame, the big
advance in the humanities is in the
hands of young non-tenured people,"
Spitz said.
Drama Dept. Chairman Charles
Lyons said that his department stres
sed the development of lower and
middle echelons of faculty. Lyons ex
pressed the hope that tenure pressure
on young faculty members might sub
side soon, because tenure anxiety gets
in the way of productivity."
Endowed chairs
Endowed chairs are one .way in
which the University has been able to
retain quality in the humanities and
social sciences faculty, said David Ful
ton, communications director for the
C.eneral Secretary's Office.
"There seems to be a good balance
between the humanities, social sci
ences and natural sciences," Fulton
said. The five-year, $300 million Cam
paign for Stanford, begun in 1972, has
made the establishment of chairs one
of its primary goals.
Since the start of the campaign, five
chairs have been established in the
humanities, 10 in the social sciences
and four in the natural sciences, Ful
ton noted.
Several administrators explained
that there are more endowed chairs in
the humanities and social sciences
than in the natural sciences because
funds for chairs are often given by
donors who majored in those fields as
undergraduates.
Chairs therefore help to counterba
lance the generous funding given the
natural sciences by large corporations,
they contended.
While arguing that the humanities
here are healthy, Clebsch warned that
constant commitment to the
humanities must be maintained.
"We've got to have a lot more money
just to stand still," Clebsch said. "The
days of expansion are gone."

program," Clebsch said, referring to
the library's Collection Department
Program. "Collections here have not
been as accidental as elsewhere.
They've been purposefully built.
Being lean does not necessarily mean
you are weak."
Carnochan and Arthur Bienenstock,
vice president for faculty affairs, ag
reed that the library has rarely hin
dered the University's ability to attract
top scholars.
"When we have known that gaps in
the collections are going to hurt us in
bringing in a distinguished humanist
or social scientist, we have filled in the
gaps with selective acquisitions,"
Bienenstock said.
Lacks humanists
Cohn contended, however, that the
University has failed to attract leading
humanists. He and Gillespie asserted
that the University's lack of interna
tionally known humanists contrasts
sharply with the abundance of "stars"
in the natural sciences here.
Both noted that several leading
scholars from the French and German
departments have left the University
in recent years and that senior vacan
cies have been hard to fill. But several
administrators who asked not to be
identified said that the French and
German departments have suffered
from special internal problems that
have not been present in other depart
ments.
Spitz acknowledged that the Uni
versity has "lost a few key appoint
ments" in recent years.

"We still need a few superstars in
certain areas of the humanities," Spitz
said.
Spitz and other professors
cautioned, however, that senior ap
pointments are not the only gauge of
the humanities' health.
"Whereas senior appointments
bring instant lustre and fame, the big
advance in the humanities is in the
hands of young non-tenured people,"
Spitz said.
Drama Dept. Chairman Charles
Lyons said that his department stres
sed the development of lower and
middle echelons of faculty. Lyons ex
pressed the hope that tenure pressure
on young faculty members might sub
side soon, because tenure anxiety gets
in the way of productivity."
Endowed chairs
Endowed chairs are one .way in
which the University has been able to
retain quality in the humanities and
social sciences faculty, said David Ful
ton, communications director for the
C.eneral Secretary's Office.
"There seems to be a good balance
between the humanities, social sci
ences and natural sciences," Fulton
said. The five-year, $300 million Cam
paign for Stanford, begun in 1972, has
made the establishment of chairs one
of its primary goals.
Since the start of the campaign, five
chairs have been established in the
humanities, 10 in the social sciences
and four in the natural sciences, Ful
ton noted.
Several administrators explained
that there are more endowed chairs in
the humanities and social sciences
than in the natural sciences because
funds for chairs are often given by
donors who majored in those fields as
undergraduates.
Chairs therefore help to counterba
lance the generous funding given the
natural sciences by large corporations,
they contended.
While arguing that the humanities
here are healthy, Clebsch warned that
constant commitment to the
humanities must be maintained.
"We've got to have a lot more money
just to stand still," Clebsch said. "The
days of expansion are gone."
While most faculty members seem to
agree that the humanities and social
sciences here are on the whole as
strong as the "hard" sciences, some
fear that the former are discriminated
against in budget cuts.
French Prof. Robert Cohn argued
that the humanities in particular are
being forced to bear the brunt of
economic belt-tightening, while the
natural and applied sciences are given
preferential treatment.
"In a pinch, the hard sciences are
what they (the administration) really
care about," Cohn said.
Robert Textor, professor of educa
tion and anthropology, fears the Uni
versity might be losing its sense of
overall direction in favor of short-run
economic concerns.
"As time goes on, as economic situa
tions tighten, there are going to be in
fluences at work in the University that
are going to be accommodative to
economics rather than to what makes a
well-rounded university," Textor said.
"I hope this doesn't happen, but I'm
afraid it might."

But Art Dept. Chairman Lorenz
Eitner sees no unfairness in the ad
ministration's treatment of the
humanities.
"Departments that are vigorous in
teaching and research and in present
ing their case to the University usually
get what they need," Eitner said.
"Whatever the defects of the admini
stration, they're not trying to kill any
thing."
German Prof. Gerald Gillespie, how
ever, asserted that the social sciences
receive the fewest budget cuts in hard
times.
Social manipulation
"The people who dominate Stanford
are social engineers and managerial
types," Gillespie said. "They are not
deeply concerned about the
humanities and natural sciences. They
view all problems as matters of social
manipulation.
"They look upon the humanities as a
pleasure product, an amusement or an
embellishment," Gillespie added.
"The natural and applied sciences are
seen only as a tool, a source of techni
cal power."
According to Gillespie, social scien
tists also control the federal agencies

that allocate grants to education and
give special preference to their own
field.
The University is no better or worse
than any other universities in the
"hegemony given to social sciences,"
he remarked.
Highest salaries
Gillespie said that a recent survey
taken by the Stanford chapter of the
American Association of University
Professors showed that social scien
tists receive the highest mean salaries
in the University.
The January Stanford Observer re
ported that salaries for humanities pro
fessors are the lowest in the Univer
sity. Several of those humanities pro
fessors interviewed, however, men
tioned a generally bad national market
for humanists as an explanation for the
relatively low salaries.
"I've felt well paid," Classics Dept.
Chairman Mark Edwards said. "Our
salaries have never seemed grossly out
of proportion. You realize, of course,
that sciences are more in demand."
New library
Most professors in the humanities
and social sciences mentioned a new
main library as one of their greatest
needs.
"The library is the humanist's linear
accelerator," said Lewis Spitz, history
professor and associate dean of
humanities and sciences.
President Richard Lyman indicated
that construction on the new main lib
rary may begin next year.
According to former English Asst.
Prof. Emerson Brown, who left here
last year to teach at Vanderbilt,
humanists at other major universities
are shocked by the inadequacies of
Stanford's library.
But Dean of Graduate Studies W.
Bliss Carnochan, while admitting that
"our library has been comparatively
weaker in some areas than the quality
of our faculty," noted that "we are re
pairing the omissions of the past."

Religious Studies Dept. Chairman
William Clebsch, who is chairman of
the Academic Council Committee on
Libraries, agreed that the libraries are
"buying very aggressively."

tions tighten, there are going to be in
fluences at work in the University that
are going to be accommodative to
economics rather than to what makes a
well-rounded university," Textor said.
"I hope this doesn't happen, but I'm
afraid it might."

But Art Dept. Chairman Lorenz
Eitner sees no unfairness in the ad
ministration's treatment of the
humanities.
"Departments that are vigorous in
teaching and research and in present
ing their case to the University usually
get what they need," Eitner said.
"Whatever the defects of the admini
stration, they're not trying to kill any
thing."
German Prof. Gerald Gillespie, how
ever, asserted that the social sciences
receive the fewest budget cuts in hard
times.
Social manipulation
"The people who dominate Stanford
are social engineers and managerial
types," Gillespie said. "They are not
deeply concerned about the
humanities and natural sciences. They
view all problems as matters of social
manipulation.
"They look upon the humanities as a
pleasure product, an amusement or an
embellishment," Gillespie added.
"The natural and applied sciences are
seen only as a tool, a source of techni
cal power."
According to Gillespie, social scien
tists also control the federal agencies

that allocate grants to education and
give special preference to their own
field.
The University is no better or worse
than any other universities in the
"hegemony given to social sciences,"
he remarked.
Highest salaries
Gillespie said that a recent survey
taken by the Stanford chapter of the
American Association of University
Professors showed that social scien
tists receive the highest mean salaries
in the University.
The January Stanford Observer re
ported that salaries for humanities pro
fessors are the lowest in the Univer
sity. Several of those humanities pro
fessors interviewed, however, men
tioned a generally bad national market
for humanists as an explanation for the
relatively low salaries.
"I've felt well paid," Classics Dept.
Chairman Mark Edwards said. "Our
salaries have never seemed grossly out
of proportion. You realize, of course,
that sciences are more in demand."
New library
Most professors in the humanities
and social sciences mentioned a new
main library as one of their greatest
needs.
"The library is the humanist's linear
accelerator," said Lewis Spitz, history
professor and associate dean of
humanities and sciences.
President Richard Lyman indicated
that construction on the new main lib
rary may begin next year.
According to former English Asst.
Prof. Emerson Brown, who left here
last year to teach at Vanderbilt,
humanists at other major universities
are shocked by the inadequacies of
Stanford's library.
But Dean of Graduate Studies W.
Bliss Carnochan, while admitting that
"our library has been comparatively
weaker in some areas than the quality
of our faculty," noted that "we are re
pairing the omissions of the past."

Religious Studies Dept. Chairman
William Clebsch, who is chairman of
the Academic Council Committee on
Libraries, agreed that the libraries are
"buying very aggressively."
"We have an excellent acquisition
program," Clebsch said, referring to
the library's Collection Department
Program. "Collections here have not
been as accidental as elsewhere.
They've been purposefully built.
Being lean does not necessarily mean
you are weak."
Carnochan and Arthur Bienenstock,
vice president for faculty affairs, ag
reed that the library has rarely hin
dered the University's ability to attract
top scholars.
"When we have known that gaps in
the collections are going to hurt us in
bringing in a distinguished humanist
or social scientist, we have filled in the
gaps with selective acquisitions,"
Bienenstock said.
Lacks humanists
Cohn contended, however, that the
University has failed to attract leading
humanists. He and Gillespie asserted
that the University's lack of interna
tionally known humanists contrasts
sharply with the abundance of "stars"
in the natural sciences here.
Both noted that several leading
scholars from the French and German
departments have left the University
in recent years and that senior vacan
cies have been hard to fill. But several
administrators who asked not to be
identified said that the French and
German departments have suffered
from special internal problems that
have not been present in other depart
ments.
Spitz acknowledged that the Uni
versity has "lost a few key appoint
ments" in recent years.

"We still need a few superstars in
certain areas of the humanities," Spitz
said.
Spitz and other professors
cautioned, however, that senior ap
pointments are not the only gauge of
the humanities' health.
"Whereas senior appointments
bring instant lustre and fame, the big
advance in the humanities is in the
hands of young non-tenured people,"
Spitz said.
Drama Dept. Chairman Charles
Lyons said that his department stres
sed the development of lower and
middle echelons of faculty. Lyons ex
pressed the hope that tenure pressure
on young faculty members might sub
side soon, because tenure anxiety gets
in the way of productivity."
Endowed chairs
Endowed chairs are one .way in
which the University has been able to
retain quality in the humanities and
social sciences faculty, said David Ful
ton, communications director for the
C.eneral Secretary's Office.
"There seems to be a good balance
between the humanities, social sci
ences and natural sciences," Fulton
said. The five-year, $300 million Cam
paign for Stanford, begun in 1972, has
made the establishment of chairs one
of its primary goals.
Since the start of the campaign, five
chairs have been established in the
humanities, 10 in the social sciences
and four in the natural sciences, Ful
ton noted.
Several administrators explained
that there are more endowed chairs in
the humanities and social sciences
than in the natural sciences because
funds for chairs are often given by
donors who majored in those fields as
undergraduates.
Chairs therefore help to counterba
lance the generous funding given the
natural sciences by large corporations,
they contended.
While arguing that the humanities
here are healthy, Clebsch warned that
constant commitment to the
humanities must be maintained.
"We've got to have a lot more money
just to stand still," Clebsch said. "The
days of expansion are gone."
While most faculty members seem to
agree that the humanities and social
sciences here are on the whole as
strong as the "hard" sciences, some
fear that the former are discriminated
against in budget cuts.
French Prof. Robert Cohn argued
that the humanities in particular are
being forced to bear the brunt of
economic belt-tightening, while the
natural and applied sciences are given
preferential treatment.
"In a pinch, the hard sciences are
what they (the administration) really
care about," Cohn said.
Robert Textor, professor of educa
tion and anthropology, fears the Uni
versity might be losing its sense of
overall direction in favor of short-run
economic concerns.
"As time goes on, as economic situa
tions tighten, there are going to be in
fluences at work in the University that
are going to be accommodative to
economics rather than to what makes a
well-rounded university," Textor said.

sharply with the abundance of "stars"
in the natural sciences here.
Both noted that several leading
scholars from the French and German
departments have left the University
in recent years and that senior vacan
cies have been hard to fill. But several
administrators who asked not to be
identified said that the French and
German departments have suffered
from special internal problems that
have not been present in other depart
ments.
Spitz acknowledged that the Uni
versity has "lost a few key appoint
ments" in recent years.

"We still need a few superstars in
certain areas of the humanities," Spitz
said.
Spitz and other professors
cautioned, however, that senior ap
pointments are not the only gauge of
the humanities' health.
"Whereas senior appointments
bring instant lustre and fame, the big
advance in the humanities is in the
hands of young non-tenured people,"
Spitz said.
Drama Dept. Chairman Charles
Lyons said that his department stres
sed the development of lower and
middle echelons of faculty. Lyons ex
pressed the hope that tenure pressure
on young faculty members might sub
side soon, because tenure anxiety gets
in the way of productivity."
Endowed chairs
Endowed chairs are one .way in
which the University has been able to
retain quality in the humanities and
social sciences faculty, said David Ful
ton, communications director for the
C.eneral Secretary's Office.
"There seems to be a good balance
between the humanities, social sci
ences and natural sciences," Fulton
said. The five-year, $300 million Cam
paign for Stanford, begun in 1972, has
made the establishment of chairs one
of its primary goals.
Since the start of the campaign, five
chairs have been established in the
humanities, 10 in the social sciences
and four in the natural sciences, Ful
ton noted.
Several administrators explained
that there are more endowed chairs in
the humanities and social sciences
than in the natural sciences because
funds for chairs are often given by
donors who majored in those fields as
undergraduates.
Chairs therefore help to counterba
lance the generous funding given the
natural sciences by large corporations,
they contended.
While arguing that the humanities
here are healthy, Clebsch warned that
constant commitment to the
humanities must be maintained.
"We've got to have a lot more money
just to stand still," Clebsch said. "The
days of expansion are gone."
