# Emergency number benefits PA; value to University questioned
## 
### Anne Michelini 
The new '911' emergency telephone
number may speed up emergency ser
vice for Palo Alto residents, but its use
by neighboring communities, includ
ing the University, may lead to addi
tional delay for non-Palo Alto users.
Effective last Monday, many tele
phones with a Palo Alto exchange can
dial 911 to connect with a dispatcher at
the Palo Alto Communications Center.
The call will then be forwarded to the
emergency service needed — either
police, fire, highway patrol or ambu
lance. The immediacy of the dispatch,
however, will benefit only residents
within Palo Alto city limits.
Palo Alto telephone exchanges out
side the city limits can get the 911 dis
patcher who will transfer their call to
the right agency serving their area, but
there is an extra delay compared with
direct dialing.
Dialing from a campus phone with a
Palo Alto exchange, other than 497,
the 911 dispatcher would connect you
with the emergency agencies that
serve the University. The quickest way
to reach the same agency is still to dial
the campus Public Safety Communica
tions Center directly at 497-1911.
Certain University extensions how
ever cannot reach 911, but all can
reach the 7-1911 number.
Palo Alto, the fourth city in Santa
Clara county to establish an
emergency dispatch service, runs on
its own funding. Like Sunnyvale. Gil -
roy and Santa Clara, however, the city
is eligible to get back some money
from the state government.
These community dispatches cur
rently have a "ring back" mechanism
that holds a telephone line open to re
ring a caller if they inadvertently hang
up before giving necessary detail", 'o
the dispatcher. Unlike a trace, this fea

ture does not provide the telephone
number or address that would be vital
information for a rescue service.
Looking forward to eventual de
velopments in tracing features, Davis
said, "The time will come on any
emergency call where the caller's tele
phone number, or (the caller's) ad
dress, will be displayed."
Davis said that implementation of
this capability "depends on how fast
the telephone company moves. The
technology for doing such a thing is

with us today, and has been for some
time, but it is going to be expensive
and it will take some tine."
The effort to establish community
emergency dispatcher telephone
numbers is going on nationally and
also in Canada. The '911' number will
be used everywhere for that purpose.
The Palo Alto Communications
Center began last week to notify city
residents of the new service. Mailers
were sent out with utility bills along
with stickers for the telephones.
