## Opinions Support for district merger 
### 
Lucerne Beal

I would like to respond to Ravenswood City
School District Board of Trustees Chairperson
Barbara Hatton's Letter in the Jan. 29 Daily.
Hatton objected to a Jan. 14 Daily article stating
that the Ravenswood Elementary School Board
had opposed a proposed merger between the Palo
Alto School District and the South San Mateo
County school districts. Her reply, "the
Ravenswood Board has taken no formal stand," is
corrrect.
However, Hatton surely Hows that when she,
theschool board president,and the superinten
dent make widely circulated public statements
opposing the merger and school integration, most
people take this to mean the Ravenswood District
Board opposes the merger.
Hattan further comments that the merger prop
onent at the Palo Alto forum implied the
"Ravenswood Board is not representing its consti
tuency on this issue." The indications which re
veal that, indeed, the most vocal board members
are not representing their constituency, are as fol
lows.
Voluntarily transferred
Of the 1200 East Palo Alto high school students,
900 voluntarily transferred last year to schools
west of the Bayshore freeway. In two previous
unification elections, which would have meant
desegregation from earliest school years, the
Ravenswood community has approved unifica
tion.
Integration candidates for the Sequoia Union
High School District Board have always won in

the 91 percent black Ravenswood District. Last
spring, the candidate for the Ravenswood
Elementary Board who won the highest number of
votes was pro-integration.
In August the Palo Alto-Stanford chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People and the Mid-Peninsula Task Force
for Integrated Education conducted a door-to
door survey in two precincts east of Bayshoreand
in scattered canvassing of two other precincts.
Some 99 percent of those interviewed were wil
ling to sign petitions stating they desired school
integration and a chance to vote on the merger.
There are other indications of parental desires,
like the large number of black students who are
now enrolled in private and parochial schools
west of Bayshore, the over-subscribed black en
rollment at the only partially integrated school in
the Ravenswood District, and the 175 East "alo
Alto students enrolled in the Palo Alto Lnif ied
School District.
Out of touch
It would appear the Ravenswood board major
ity is out of touch with its constituency.
Hatton suggests that the more appropriate ques
tion is "whether the Palo Alto board represents
the view of its constituents."
Good comment, for one can't help wondering if
the Palo Alto board were confident of accurately
representing Palo Altoans, why would it cam
paign so vigorously to prevent the measure from
ever reaching the voters. Power is polluting both
sides.
