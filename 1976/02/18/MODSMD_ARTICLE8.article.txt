# Guest profs: good choice

There seems to be a great deal
of bleating about the ASSU
Guest Professorship Board's in
vitation of three "radicals" to
teach at Stanford next quarter.
However, ASSU Senators Carole
Houck, Bob Ottilie, Kevin
McDermott and others have
failed to acknowledge several
important facts in their com
plaints.
First, as I understand it, nomi
nations were solicited in at least
one front-page Daily article in
December, and of the 36 names
brought forward only one came
from a board member. Where
were Houck, Ottilie and
McDermott then?
Secondly, letters of inquiry
were sent to those nominees, and
only nine answered affirma-

tively. The board reviewed the
qualifications of these candi
dates at the ASSU Senate meet
ing last Tuesday, and on the
basis of the board's presentation
it was clear the most outstanding
people were chosen from the av
ailable sample.
It is unfortunate a "liberta
rian" was not included. Such an
invitee might have offered us a
radically different set of perspec
tives from either the shopworn
standards of conservative/liberal
ideology or Marxist challenges
which style themselves as the
"sole reasonable alternative" to
a bankrupt establishmen
tarianism.
Failure to help
But given the failure of those
now shedding public tears to en

courage successful solicitation
of any other spokesmen, and
given the board's commendable
efforts toward this end, the bar
rage of criticism unleased
against the committee is totally
unwarranted.
The board has actually done
the Stanford community a fine
service.
Furthermore, representating
these three candidates as of a
"single mind" on issues is pa
tently absurd.
Angela Davis and Ernest
Mandel might on issues if one
draws one's categorical distinc
tions in as red-and-white terms
as these protesters insist on do
ing. But it is naive at best to also
lump into that group a psychiat
rist who is deemed "radical" as
much due to the limited perspec
tives of modern behaviorism
(and the narrow scope of the
Psychology Department here) as
because of the uniqueness of his
own orientation.
Vaguest familiarity
In addition, anyone with even
the vaguest familiarity with both
transactional analysis and the
"libertarian" methodology
should be well aware of the
plethora of shared viewpoints
therein.
Let us try to make this new
program a success, not an issue.
Then those who might like to in
vite representatives of different
opinions may have a better op
portunity to do so in the future.
For the moment, those who
now air their sour gripes jeopar
dize the possibility of such fu
ture invitations and thereby
thwait their own ends. Critics
have made their own bed, and
should now lie in it quietly, as a
sleeping dog awaits his/her next
meal.

The board has actually done
the Stanford community a fine
service.
Furthermore, representating
these three candidates as of a
"single mind" on issues is pa
tently absurd.
Angela Davis and Ernest
Mandel might on issues if one
draws one's categorical distinc
tions in as red-and-white terms
as these protesters insist on do
ing. But it is naive at best to also
lump into that group a psychiat
rist who is deemed "radical" as
much due to the limited perspec
tives of modern behaviorism
(and the narrow scope of the
Psychology Department here) as
because of the uniqueness of his
own orientation.
Vaguest familiarity
In addition, anyone with even
the vaguest familiarity with both
transactional analysis and the
"libertarian" methodology
should be well aware of the
plethora of shared viewpoints
therein.
Let us try to make this new
program a success, not an issue.
Then those who might like to in
vite representatives of different
opinions may have a better op
portunity to do so in the future.
For the moment, those who
now air their sour gripes jeopar
dize the possibility of such fu
ture invitations and thereby
thwait their own ends. Critics
have made their own bed, and
should now lie in it quietly, as a
sleeping dog awaits his/her next
meal.

There seems to be a great deal
of bleating about the ASSU
Guest Professorship Board's in
vitation of three "radicals" to
teach at Stanford next quarter.
However, ASSU Senators Carole
Houck, Bob Ottilie, Kevin
McDermott and others have
failed to acknowledge several
important facts in their com
plaints.
First, as I understand it, nomi
nations were solicited in at least
one front-page Daily article in
December, and of the 36 names
brought forward only one came
from a board member. Where
were Houck, Ottilie and
McDermott then?
Secondly, letters of inquiry
were sent to those nominees, and
only nine answered affirma-

tively. The board reviewed the
qualifications of these candi
dates at the ASSU Senate meet
ing last Tuesday, and on the
basis of the board's presentation
it was clear the most outstanding
people were chosen from the av
ailable sample.
It is unfortunate a "liberta
rian" was not included. Such an
invitee might have offered us a
radically different set of perspec
tives from either the shopworn
standards of conservative/liberal
ideology or Marxist challenges
which style themselves as the
"sole reasonable alternative" to
a bankrupt establishmen
tarianism.
Failure to help
But given the failure of those
now shedding public tears to en

courage successful solicitation
of any other spokesmen, and
given the board's commendable
efforts toward this end, the bar
rage of criticism unleased
against the committee is totally
unwarranted.
