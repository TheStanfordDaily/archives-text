# Helps meet energy needs
## Synergy harnesses sun's rays 
### Janice Bressler 
A sun-powered water heater,
designed and built by students,
has sparked serious interest in the
possibility of using solar power to
help meet the University's energy
needs
Mounted on the Synergy House
roof, the heater is the first practical
application on campus of solar
power, an alternative energy
source that many say is becoming
increasingly viable.
The Synergy solar unit is an
example of a type of solar
technology that uses the suns
radiation directly to heat water or
air. Another currently less
feasible branch of solar research
is investigating the generation of
electricity using the sun Solar re
searchers here have said it will be
five to 20 years before solar elec
tricity can be as economical and
efficient as conventional forms of
electricity
But there are no technological
obstacles to building solar heating
units. The technology involved is
not at all that complicated," said
Chuck Pike, one of the four stu
dent bunders of the Synergy hea
ter.
Holly Townes, a coworker of
Pike s, agreed. Of four of us.
Chuck is the only engineer, she
said Anyone can build a solar
heater and understand how it
works."
A solar unit like Synergy s
works by gleaning heat from the
sun with collectors — black, metal
plates, criss-crossed with copper
pipes. Water circulates through
the pipes, absorbs heat from the
plates and is stored for use in a
tank inside the house A space
heater, for heating rooms, can be
built on much the same principle,
using air instead of water.
About one fourth of the nation's
total energy usage is devoted to
space and water heating, which
theoretically could be provided by
solar power But before solar heat
ing becomes widespread, people
will have to be convinced it is
economical.
One person who is convinced is
Rich Richardson. Housing Man

agement Office official who sec
ured the bulk of the funds for the
Synergy project.
Solar units like Synergy's."
Richardson said, hold the possi
bility of saving the University a
considerable amount of money."
Cost comparisons
Cost comparisons between
solar heaters and conventional
forms of energy are tricky, said
Gilbert Masters, a lecturer in civil
engineering who teaches a
course here on alternative
technologies. The Synergy heater
began as a project for Masters
class.
There is a relatively large initial
investment for the collectors."
Masters explains, "but after that
there are no monthly payments for
fuel. Sunlight is free."
In many parts of the country
solar heating is already cheaper
than propane and electricity, ac
cording to Masters. And in the fu
ture. he said, solar heating is likely
to become an even better buy
compared to conventional energy
forms. Conventional fuel costs will
probably rise faster than the capi
tal costs of solar heating compo
nents. he explained
The cost of the Synergy system
was just under $1000. Masters'
class donated $45 to the project.
Synergy Housa gave $100 and
the Housing Management Office
paid the rest.
Prime reason
But economics. Pike insisted,
was not the prime reason he and
the other students became in
terested in solar heating. For
them, its most important advan
tages are environmental ones.
In marked contrast to conven
tional energy technologies such
as coal or nuclear power, solar
heating is pollution-free. Also,
solar heating conserves the
dwindling supply of non
renewable fossil fuels for other
uses. The sun." said Pike, "is the
planet s only renewable re
source."
Both Masters and Pike are cri
tics of nuclear power and argue
that solar heating can help to
make nuclear energy unneces

sary.
"When people say we have to
have nuclear power and the risks
that accompany it, they're imply
ing we have no alternative
sources. Solar heating is clearly
one viable alternative right now,''
said Masters.
Self-sufficiency
Another benefit of solar heating,
said Masters, is that it increases
ones self-sufficiency. An indi
vidual with a solar heating unit
servicing his home is less vulner
able to oil embargoes, fuel shor
tages and fluctuating fuel prices.
There is one problem that own
ers of solar heaters are vulnerable
to — solar collectors cannot pro
duce energy on heavily clouded
days. So, solar-heated homes re
quire a back-up heating
mechanism.
At Synergy, the back-up is
natural gas water heating.
A control device that will turn the
solar unit on and off. depending
upon the amount of sunlight
reaching it, is one of the finishing
touches that have to be made on
the Synergy heater.
By some time in the next two
weeks," said Pike, "we should be
done."
Work on the heater began last
spring, when all four builders were
enrolled in Masters' class, "De
signs for Alternative Lifestyles.''
The first collector was finished at
the end of that quarter and. after
stopping construction over the
summer, the students finished the
second collector early in fall quar
ter.
Richardson provided a lot of

support for the project. Pike said.
For instance, he added, before the
unit was installed, Richardson
sent over two engineers to check
out the safety systems.
Richardson remains an en
thusiastic supporter of solar heat
ing and has plans already for more

units like the one at Synergy.
"We have to start small,"
Richardson said, "and building
solar units at each of the indepen
dent houses on the Row is an
ideal way to slowly convert a large
part of the University water heat
ing systems to solar power."

In marked contrast to conven

heating is pollution-free. Also,
solar heating conserves the
dwindling supply of non

Both Masters and Pike are cri

that solar heating can help to

"When people say we have to
have nuclear power and the risks

one viable alternative right now,''
said Masters.
Self-sufficiency
Another benefit of solar heating,
said Masters, is that it increases
ones self-sufficiency. An indi
vidual with a solar heating unit
servicing his home is less vulner
able to oil embargoes, fuel shor
tages and fluctuating fuel prices.
There is one problem that own
ers of solar heaters are vulnerable
to — solar collectors cannot pro
duce energy on heavily clouded
days. So, solar-heated homes re
quire a back-up heating
mechanism.
At Synergy, the back-up is
natural gas water heating.
A control device that will turn the
solar unit on and off. depending
upon the amount of sunlight
reaching it, is one of the finishing
touches that have to be made on
the Synergy heater.
By some time in the next two
weeks," said Pike, "we should be
done."
Work on the heater began last
spring, when all four builders were
enrolled in Masters' class, "De
signs for Alternative Lifestyles.''
The first collector was finished at
the end of that quarter and. after
stopping construction over the
summer, the students finished the
second collector early in fall quar
ter.
Richardson provided a lot of

support for the project. Pike said.
For instance, he added, before the
unit was installed, Richardson
sent over two engineers to check
out the safety systems.
Richardson remains an en
thusiastic supporter of solar heat
ing and has plans already for more

units like the one at Synergy.
"We have to start small,"
Richardson said, "and building
solar units at each of the indepen
dent houses on the Row is an
ideal way to slowly convert a large
part of the University water heat

SUNNY SIDE UP? — Workmen with the aid of a crane lifted a solar unit into place at Synergy
House last November. The solar unit is an example of a type of solar technology that uses the sun's
radiation directly to heat water or air.
A sun-powered water heater,
designed and built by students,
has sparked serious interest in the

Mounted on the Synergy House

The Synergy solar unit is an

feasible branch of solar research
is investigating the generation of
electricity using the sun Solar re
searchers here have said it will be
five to 20 years before solar elec
tricity can be as economical and

electricity
But there are no technological
obstacles to building solar heating
units. The technology involved is
not at all that complicated," said
Chuck Pike, one of the four stu

A solar unit like Synergy s
works by gleaning heat from the
sun with collectors — black, metal
plates, criss-crossed with copper
pipes. Water circulates through
the pipes, absorbs heat from the
plates and is stored for use in a
tank inside the house A space
heater, for heating rooms, can be
built on much the same principle,
using air instead of water.
About one fourth of the nation's
total energy usage is devoted to
space and water heating, which
theoretically could be provided by
solar power But before solar heat

will have to be convinced it is
economical.

SUNNY SIDE UP? — Workmen with the aid of a crane lifted a solar unit into place at Synergy
House last November. The solar unit is an example of a type of solar technology that uses the sun's
radiation directly to heat water or air.
A sun-powered water heater,
designed and built by students,
has sparked serious interest in the
possibility of using solar power to
help meet the University's energy
needs
Mounted on the Synergy House
roof, the heater is the first practical
application on campus of solar
power, an alternative energy
source that many say is becoming
increasingly viable.
The Synergy solar unit is an
example of a type of solar
technology that uses the suns
radiation directly to heat water or
air. Another currently less
feasible branch of solar research
is investigating the generation of
electricity using the sun Solar re
searchers here have said it will be
five to 20 years before solar elec
tricity can be as economical and
efficient as conventional forms of
electricity
But there are no technological
obstacles to building solar heating
units. The technology involved is
not at all that complicated," said
Chuck Pike, one of the four stu
dent bunders of the Synergy hea
ter.
Holly Townes, a coworker of
Pike s, agreed. Of four of us.
Chuck is the only engineer, she
said Anyone can build a solar
heater and understand how it
works."
A solar unit like Synergy s
works by gleaning heat from the
sun with collectors — black, metal
plates, criss-crossed with copper
pipes. Water circulates through
the pipes, absorbs heat from the
plates and is stored for use in a
tank inside the house A space
heater, for heating rooms, can be
built on much the same principle,
using air instead of water.
About one fourth of the nation's
total energy usage is devoted to
space and water heating, which
theoretically could be provided by
solar power But before solar heat
ing becomes widespread, people
will have to be convinced it is
economical.
One person who is convinced is
Rich Richardson. Housing Man

agement Office official who sec
ured the bulk of the funds for the
Synergy project.
Solar units like Synergy's."
Richardson said, hold the possi
bility of saving the University a
considerable amount of money."
Cost comparisons
Cost comparisons between
solar heaters and conventional
forms of energy are tricky, said
Gilbert Masters, a lecturer in civil
engineering who teaches a
course here on alternative
technologies. The Synergy heater
began as a project for Masters
class.
There is a relatively large initial
investment for the collectors."
Masters explains, "but after that
there are no monthly payments for
fuel. Sunlight is free."
In many parts of the country
solar heating is already cheaper
than propane and electricity, ac
cording to Masters. And in the fu
ture. he said, solar heating is likely
to become an even better buy
compared to conventional energy
forms. Conventional fuel costs will
probably rise faster than the capi
tal costs of solar heating compo
nents. he explained
The cost of the Synergy system
was just under $1000. Masters'
class donated $45 to the project.
Synergy Housa gave $100 and
the Housing Management Office
paid the rest.
Prime reason
But economics. Pike insisted,
was not the prime reason he and
the other students became in
terested in solar heating. For
them, its most important advan
tages are environmental ones.
In marked contrast to conven
tional energy technologies such
as coal or nuclear power, solar
heating is pollution-free. Also,
solar heating conserves the
dwindling supply of non
renewable fossil fuels for other
uses. The sun." said Pike, "is the
planet s only renewable re
source."
Both Masters and Pike are cri
tics of nuclear power and argue
that solar heating can help to
make nuclear energy unneces

sary.
"When people say we have to
have nuclear power and the risks
that accompany it, they're imply
ing we have no alternative
sources. Solar heating is clearly
one viable alternative right now,''
said Masters.
Self-sufficiency
Another benefit of solar heating,
said Masters, is that it increases
ones self-sufficiency. An indi
vidual with a solar heating unit
servicing his home is less vulner
able to oil embargoes, fuel shor
tages and fluctuating fuel prices.
There is one problem that own
ers of solar heaters are vulnerable
to — solar collectors cannot pro
duce energy on heavily clouded
days. So, solar-heated homes re
quire a back-up heating
mechanism.
At Synergy, the back-up is
natural gas water heating.
A control device that will turn the
solar unit on and off. depending
upon the amount of sunlight
reaching it, is one of the finishing
touches that have to be made on
the Synergy heater.
By some time in the next two
weeks," said Pike, "we should be
done."
Work on the heater began last
spring, when all four builders were
enrolled in Masters' class, "De
signs for Alternative Lifestyles.''
The first collector was finished at
the end of that quarter and. after
stopping construction over the
summer, the students finished the
second collector early in fall quar
ter.
Richardson provided a lot of

support for the project. Pike said.
For instance, he added, before the
unit was installed, Richardson
sent over two engineers to check
out the safety systems.
Richardson remains an en
thusiastic supporter of solar heat
ing and has plans already for more

units like the one at Synergy.
"We have to start small,"
Richardson said, "and building
solar units at each of the indepen
dent houses on the Row is an
ideal way to slowly convert a large
part of the University water heat
ing systems to solar power."
