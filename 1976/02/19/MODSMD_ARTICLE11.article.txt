# Campus Democrats to choose delegates
## 
### Pat Noonan 
The Stanford Democratic
Committee (SDC) will meet to
night at 7 30 in Meyer Library Rm
146 to determine whom it will send
as delegates to the California
Democratic Council (CDC) Con
vention. The SDC meeting will be
open to all interested students.
The CDC will hold its conven
tion in Los Angeles. Feb 27-29.
where it will make endorsements
for President and a U.S. Senator
from California
The SDC will send three dele
gates to the convention, which will
consist of 1500 delegates from
California Democratic organiza

tions.
Tonight, the SDC will decide
who their delegates will endorse
at the convention The SDC also
will decide whether or not to join
the Student Democratic Coalition
of Northern California in order to
create a more effective student
bloc at the convention. The coali
tion is composed of eight schools
including UC Berkeley and UC-
Davis
The SDC will also discuss how
students may become delegates
at the Democratic National Con
vention in New York City. Party
reforms have made it possible and
desirable for students and youths
to be represented on party, plat
form committees and state dele
gations, according to Brad Kre
voy, a committee member.
Other topics to be discussed to
night include obtaining academic
credit for campaign work, gaining
support and interaction with the
faculty, the Palo Alto Democratic
party's request for student in
volvement in supporting gun con

trol legislation and procurring
funds from the ASSU.
SDC leaders hope to bring to
gether politically interested and
active students on campus who
have so far been working sepa
rately for individual candidates.
The SDC's intent is not to get all
students together behind a single
candidate, but to establish its cre
dibility as a political organization,
according to Krevoy.
