# Residents support new house name
## 
### Keith Calhoun 
Students at the Black Student
Cultural Center are presently at
tempting to transform a house
named after trees into a house
based on familyhood.
Residents of "Olivo-Magnolia"
voted last week to change the
name of their house to "Ujamaa"
which is the Swahili name for
familyhood.
The traditional name Olivo-
Magnolia is inconsistant with re
tention of black identity at Stan
ford," states Reggie Mason, a
junior and RA at the center. "All
the names on the list were better
than Olivo-Magnolia'' and Ujamaa
is "very relevant in terms of mean
ing."
Sophomore Dave Smith, in
itiator of the name change, said
the idea for a name change has
been around as long as the center
has been there, but this is the first
time action has been taken on it.
The main purpose is to cause
people to think, if even for a half

second, that this place is diffe
rent," he said.
Sophomore Debbra Smith, said
that the old name. 'Olivo-
Magnolia, doesn't mean anything;
it doesn't sound like anything to
anybody except another dorm.''
When asked if he thought the
name was only a cosmetic change
RA Nathan Richardson replied,
Ujamaa means something to
me," and "as a residential title, it
can help to provide current as well
as incoming black students with a
sense of cultural distinctiveness,
and, hopefully a conscious
awareness of the role their
African-American roots' will play
in the personal development and
success."
The concept of familyhood was
also viewed favorably by many
white students, although many
were concerned about what the
idea of familyhood encompassed.
One freshman remarked that she
liked the name but hoped that it
did not mean just black family
hood.
