# Satellites to help fight forest fires
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) —
California and the nation's space
agency agreed Tuesday to
employ a satellite and automatic
sensors in the fight against the
state's $125-million-a-year forest
fire problem.
Dr. Hans Mark, director of the
National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Ames Research

Center, said the California project
"is a prototype of a number of
other things that are going to be
done in the next few years in
California, the Pacific Northwest,
the nation and on a world-wide
basis."
The agreement is the first of its
kind between NASA and any
state, State Forester Larry Richey
told a Capitol news conference
where he and Mark signed the
pact.
It results from a one-station,
three-year experiment, and calls
for 24 automatic forest fire
weather stations in operation by
June 1 throughout the state's
timber-rich north coast from north
of San Francisco Bay to the Ore
gon border.
"We will be able to adjust our
forces and meet fire situations
more efficiently," said Rickey of
the system he wants to replace
the slower, less reliable manual
procedure of reporting weather.
In about three years, Rickey
said, a decision will be made on
whether to go ahead with a
statewide system of 150 stations
at a total cost of $250,000.
From there, said Mark, the sys
tem could spread across the coun
try.
"We expect this to be success
ful and spread throughout the
state," Rickey said of the stations,
which cost about $6000 each. The
state is paying about $20,000 a
year into the program, he said.
The unmanned stations can be
set up in terrain too rugged for sta
tions convenient for forest ran
gers, Richey said.
The manned facilities, the re
mote sensors beaming data on
humidity, forest fuel moisture,
wind and temperature to a statio
nary communications satellite.
