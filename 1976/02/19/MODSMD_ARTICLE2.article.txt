# Tenure: who will stay?
## 
### Andrew Leuchter Bill Jordan 
ast year, Asst. Religious Studies Prof. Jerry Irish
was denied tenure. This year Asst. Sociology Prof.
Anne McMahon was also denied tenure. Both had re
ceived the Gores Award for excellence in teaching. Both
were faulted for their lack of research.
These decisions have raised numerous questions on
the University's tenure policy and its goals in that policy.
Should the emphasis be on research or on teaching and
what are the implications for the quality of education of
fered?
The University's answer to this question appears
equivocal. The administration vows to let neither the qual

ity of research nor undergraduate education lapse. This
philosophy underlies the criteria for appointments and
promotions to tenure. Those criteria were outlined by
former Dean of Humanities and Sciences Albert Hastorf in
1972:". . . any individual who is to be recommended for. . .
tenure must be truly superior as either a teacher or a
scholar and at least very good at the other. He or she
should be demonstrably the best person available.
Many have come to doubt the sincerity of the Universi
ty's commitment to maintain the quality of undergraduate
education. These doubts have increased with admissions
from the administration that research productiveness and
potential are the primary considerations in the decision to
grant tenure. Dean of Under
graduate Studies James Gibbs
stated in a 1973 memorandum:
. . (T)here is a heavy emphasis
on research and publication
capability in making faculty ap
pointments
Today, Gibbs still concludes
that "the weighting given to re
search capability is higher than it
should be." He attributes this not
to the University's priorities, but to
more "artificial reasons" within the
academic community.
According to Gibbs' report,
"University faculties have de
veloped means of assessing re
search potential and capability
that they feel are quite valid and

reliable .. . . Data on teaching po
tential and capacity, on the other
hand, tend not to be felt to be con
sistently valid or reliable." Teach
ing evaluations, thought to be
more spurious than research
evaluations, are thus given less
serjous consideration in tenure
deliberations.
Recommendations endorsed
Gibbs' 1973 memorandum
listed 17 recommendations, de
signed to develop systematic,
University-wide mechanisms for
teaching evaluation. Despite the
fact that these recommendations
have been twice endorsed by the
Faculty Senate, Gibbs believes
that "not much progress" has
been made in their implementa

tion.
In the School of Humanities and
Sciences, the Faculty Senate
charged Dean Halsey Royden
with the ultimate responsibility for
the development of systematized
teaching evaluation. Royden of
fers several explanations for why
teaching evaluation has not yet
been adopted on a schoolwide
basis.
Firstly, he sees a certain
amount of inertia within the de
partments, blocking development
of these techniques. The fear is
that "the use of these evaluations
will be primarily judgmental," not
helping professors improve their
teaching but "reinforcing the re
ward system" implicit in appoint
ments and promotions. Secondly,
Royden explains that his time has
been occupied primarily with
trimming $10 million from the
Humanities and Sciences budget,'
and that although his Subcommit
tee on the Evaluation of Teaching
has been studying the problem he
has not had time to act on their
recommendations.
Issue: service
But many believe that the de
velopment of mechanisms for the
evaluation of teaching will do no
thing to emphasize teaching as
tenure consideration. "The issue
here is not simply teaching, it is
service to the University commun
ity in general," explains B. Michael
Closson, assistant dean of un
dergraduate studies.
"This service is given little if any
weight in tenure deliberations."
Closson believes that there is a
great deal of implicit pressure
against this kind of service, since
the results of it are much less tan
gible than "a good publication re
cord." McMahon, recently denied
tenure in the sociology depart
ment, concurs: "The publication
record and national visibility are
the main issues (when the re
commendation reaches the
Committee on Appointments and
Promotions), although teaching
and service are also
documented."
Sometimes, the pressure to ig

nore community service is more
than implicit. One University ad
ministrator tells of a friend on the
junior faculty who was told by
members of his department "not
to accept a resident fellow position
in the dormitories, but to pay more
attention to his research."
Gibbs denies that this kind of
pressure is prevalent in the Uni
versity, contending that in some
ways Stanford actually encour
ages such community service. He
cites the example of the Mellon
Scholars program, which enables
junior faculty to take leaves during
their fourth year for the purpose of
intensive research. Gibbs notes
that one of the criteria used for
awarding these fellowships is
"service to the community."
Teaching always less
But in the final analysis, Royden
admits that teaching ability will al
ways be less of a consideration in
tenure deliberations. He points
out: "Evaluations for tenure are
not only immediately evaluative,

they are predictive. We are not
only assessing a candidate's pre
sent research and teaching ability,
but we are also trying to predict his
potential for growth throughout his
academic year."
Royden believes a prediction of
"what kind of research a candi
date will be doing 30 years from
now" is inherently more accurate
than a prediction of what kind of
teacher he will be."
It is difficult to tell exactly what
role the quality of teaching plays in
the decision to promote to tenure.
One difficulty inherent in any de
bate on the subject is the inability
to cite specific examples of where
a professor granted or denied te
nure largely on the basis of his
teaching ability, or his prowess as
a researcher. "Not only would this
be an invasion of privacy," points
out Royden, "but adverse judge
ments on an individual's research
or teaching ability, once made
public, could seriously damage an
individual's career."

According to Gibbs' report,
"University faculties have de
veloped means of assessing re
search potential and capability
that they feel are quite valid and

reliable .. . . Data on teaching po
tential and capacity, on the other
hand, tend not to be felt to be con
sistently valid or reliable." Teach
ing evaluations, thought to be
more spurious than research
evaluations, are thus given less
serjous consideration in tenure
deliberations.
Recommendations endorsed
Gibbs' 1973 memorandum
listed 17 recommendations, de
signed to develop systematic,
University-wide mechanisms for
teaching evaluation. Despite the
fact that these recommendations
have been twice endorsed by the
Faculty Senate, Gibbs believes
that "not much progress" has
been made in their implementa

tion.
In the School of Humanities and
Sciences, the Faculty Senate
charged Dean Halsey Royden
with the ultimate responsibility for
the development of systematized
teaching evaluation. Royden of
fers several explanations for why
teaching evaluation has not yet
been adopted on a schoolwide
basis.
Firstly, he sees a certain
amount of inertia within the de
partments, blocking development
of these techniques. The fear is
that "the use of these evaluations
will be primarily judgmental," not
helping professors improve their
teaching but "reinforcing the re
ward system" implicit in appoint
ments and promotions. Secondly,
Royden explains that his time has
been occupied primarily with
trimming $10 million from the
Humanities and Sciences budget,'
and that although his Subcommit
tee on the Evaluation of Teaching
has been studying the problem he
has not had time to act on their
recommendations.
Issue: service
But many believe that the de
velopment of mechanisms for the
evaluation of teaching will do no
thing to emphasize teaching as
tenure consideration. "The issue
here is not simply teaching, it is
service to the University commun
ity in general," explains B. Michael
Closson, assistant dean of un
dergraduate studies.
"This service is given little if any
weight in tenure deliberations."
Closson believes that there is a
great deal of implicit pressure
against this kind of service, since
the results of it are much less tan
gible than "a good publication re
cord." McMahon, recently denied
tenure in the sociology depart
ment, concurs: "The publication
record and national visibility are
the main issues (when the re
commendation reaches the
Committee on Appointments and
Promotions), although teaching
and service are also
documented."
Sometimes, the pressure to ig

nore community service is more
than implicit. One University ad
ministrator tells of a friend on the
junior faculty who was told by
members of his department "not
to accept a resident fellow position
in the dormitories, but to pay more
attention to his research."
Gibbs denies that this kind of
pressure is prevalent in the Uni
versity, contending that in some
ways Stanford actually encour
ages such community service. He
cites the example of the Mellon
Scholars program, which enables
junior faculty to take leaves during
their fourth year for the purpose of
intensive research. Gibbs notes
that one of the criteria used for
awarding these fellowships is
"service to the community."
Teaching always less
But in the final analysis, Royden
admits that teaching ability will al
ways be less of a consideration in
tenure deliberations. He points
out: "Evaluations for tenure are
not only immediately evaluative,

they are predictive. We are not
only assessing a candidate's pre
sent research and teaching ability,
but we are also trying to predict his
potential for growth throughout his
academic year."
Royden believes a prediction of
"what kind of research a candi
date will be doing 30 years from
now" is inherently more accurate
than a prediction of what kind of
teacher he will be."
It is difficult to tell exactly what
role the quality of teaching plays in
the decision to promote to tenure.
One difficulty inherent in any de
bate on the subject is the inability
to cite specific examples of where
a professor granted or denied te
nure largely on the basis of his
teaching ability, or his prowess as
a researcher. "Not only would this
be an invasion of privacy," points
out Royden, "but adverse judge
ments on an individual's research
or teaching ability, once made
public, could seriously damage an
individual's career."

ast year, Asst. Religious Studies Prof. Jerry Irish
was denied tenure. This year Asst. Sociology Prof.
Anne McMahon was also denied tenure. Both had re
ceived the Gores Award for excellence in teaching. Both
were faulted for their lack of research.
These decisions have raised numerous questions on
the University's tenure policy and its goals in that policy.
Should the emphasis be on research or on teaching and
what are the implications for the quality of education of
fered?
The University's answer to this question appears
equivocal. The administration vows to let neither the qual

ity of research nor undergraduate education lapse. This
philosophy underlies the criteria for appointments and
promotions to tenure. Those criteria were outlined by
former Dean of Humanities and Sciences Albert Hastorf in
1972:". . . any individual who is to be recommended for. . .
tenure must be truly superior as either a teacher or a
scholar and at least very good at the other. He or she
should be demonstrably the best person available.
Many have come to doubt the sincerity of the Universi
ty's commitment to maintain the quality of undergraduate
education. These doubts have increased with admissions
from the administration that research productiveness and
potential are the primary considerations in the decision to
grant tenure. Dean of Under
graduate Studies James Gibbs
stated in a 1973 memorandum:
. . (T)here is a heavy emphasis
on research and publication
capability in making faculty ap
pointments
Today, Gibbs still concludes
that "the weighting given to re
search capability is higher than it
should be." He attributes this not
to the University's priorities, but to
more "artificial reasons" within the

Issue: service
But many believe that the de
velopment of mechanisms for the
evaluation of teaching will do no
thing to emphasize teaching as
tenure consideration. "The issue
here is not simply teaching, it is
service to the University commun
ity in general," explains B. Michael
Closson, assistant dean of un
dergraduate studies.
"This service is given little if any
weight in tenure deliberations."
Closson believes that there is a
great deal of implicit pressure
against this kind of service, since
the results of it are much less tan
gible than "a good publication re
cord." McMahon, recently denied
tenure in the sociology depart
ment, concurs: "The publication
record and national visibility are
the main issues (when the re
commendation reaches the
Committee on Appointments and
Promotions), although teaching
and service are also
documented."
Sometimes, the pressure to ig

nore community service is more
than implicit. One University ad
ministrator tells of a friend on the
junior faculty who was told by
members of his department "not
to accept a resident fellow position
in the dormitories, but to pay more
attention to his research."
Gibbs denies that this kind of
pressure is prevalent in the Uni
versity, contending that in some
ways Stanford actually encour
ages such community service. He
cites the example of the Mellon
Scholars program, which enables
junior faculty to take leaves during
their fourth year for the purpose of
intensive research. Gibbs notes
that one of the criteria used for
awarding these fellowships is
"service to the community."
Teaching always less
But in the final analysis, Royden
admits that teaching ability will al
ways be less of a consideration in
tenure deliberations. He points
out: "Evaluations for tenure are
not only immediately evaluative,

they are predictive. We are not
only assessing a candidate's pre
sent research and teaching ability,
but we are also trying to predict his
potential for growth throughout his
academic year."
Royden believes a prediction of
"what kind of research a candi
date will be doing 30 years from
now" is inherently more accurate
than a prediction of what kind of
teacher he will be."
It is difficult to tell exactly what
role the quality of teaching plays in
the decision to promote to tenure.
One difficulty inherent in any de
bate on the subject is the inability
to cite specific examples of where
a professor granted or denied te
nure largely on the basis of his
teaching ability, or his prowess as
a researcher. "Not only would this
be an invasion of privacy," points
out Royden, "but adverse judge
ments on an individual's research
or teaching ability, once made
public, could seriously damage an
individual's career."

ast year, Asst. Religious Studies Prof. Jerry Irish
was denied tenure. This year Asst. Sociology Prof.
Anne McMahon was also denied tenure. Both had re
ceived the Gores Award for excellence in teaching. Both
were faulted for their lack of research.
These decisions have raised numerous questions on
the University's tenure policy and its goals in that policy.
Should the emphasis be on research or on teaching and
what are the implications for the quality of education of
fered?
The University's answer to this question appears
equivocal. The administration vows to let neither the qual

ity of research nor undergraduate education lapse. This
philosophy underlies the criteria for appointments and
promotions to tenure. Those criteria were outlined by
former Dean of Humanities and Sciences Albert Hastorf in
1972:". . . any individual who is to be recommended for. . .
tenure must be truly superior as either a teacher or a
scholar and at least very good at the other. He or she
should be demonstrably the best person available.
Many have come to doubt the sincerity of the Universi
ty's commitment to maintain the quality of undergraduate
education. These doubts have increased with admissions
from the administration that research productiveness and
potential are the primary considerations in the decision to
grant tenure. Dean of Under
graduate Studies James Gibbs
stated in a 1973 memorandum:
. . (T)here is a heavy emphasis
on research and publication
capability in making faculty ap
pointments
Today, Gibbs still concludes
that "the weighting given to re
search capability is higher than it
should be." He attributes this not
to the University's priorities, but to
more "artificial reasons" within the
academic community.
According to Gibbs' report,
"University faculties have de
veloped means of assessing re
search potential and capability
that they feel are quite valid and

reliable .. . . Data on teaching po
tential and capacity, on the other
hand, tend not to be felt to be con
sistently valid or reliable." Teach
ing evaluations, thought to be
more spurious than research
evaluations, are thus given less
serjous consideration in tenure
deliberations.
Recommendations endorsed
Gibbs' 1973 memorandum
listed 17 recommendations, de
signed to develop systematic,
University-wide mechanisms for
teaching evaluation. Despite the
fact that these recommendations
have been twice endorsed by the
Faculty Senate, Gibbs believes
that "not much progress" has
been made in their implementa

tion.
In the School of Humanities and
Sciences, the Faculty Senate
charged Dean Halsey Royden
with the ultimate responsibility for
the development of systematized
teaching evaluation. Royden of
fers several explanations for why
teaching evaluation has not yet
been adopted on a schoolwide
basis.
Firstly, he sees a certain
amount of inertia within the de
partments, blocking development
of these techniques. The fear is
that "the use of these evaluations
will be primarily judgmental," not
helping professors improve their
teaching but "reinforcing the re
ward system" implicit in appoint
ments and promotions. Secondly,
Royden explains that his time has
been occupied primarily with
trimming $10 million from the
Humanities and Sciences budget,'
and that although his Subcommit
tee on the Evaluation of Teaching
has been studying the problem he
has not had time to act on their
recommendations.
