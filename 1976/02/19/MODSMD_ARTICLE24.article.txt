# Mopeds offer a cheaper way to go
##

Just as you enter Redwood City
on El Camino Real, there is a
small white building decorated
with graphic rainbows. The trea
sure at the end of this rainbow,
says owner Sandy Secrest, is a
new form of transportation — the
moped
The moped, which literally

means "motor pedal,' combines
elements of both a motorcycle and
a bicycle You use the pedals to
get the moped moving, and from
there its mini-engine takes over.
Why would anyone buy a
Moped? Certainly not for speed;
at their fastest, mopeds travel at a
rip-roaring 25 mph
But in the truest spirit of the

Shopping Bag, the lowly moped
has one thing in its favor:
economy. Pound for pound, it's
the cheapest motorized transpor
tation you can find.
Another asset is that its repairs
are so minimal. Secrest says that
she used her Ciao for two years
before she went into the business
of selling them. In that time her

only maintenance was changing
the spark plug — once — and
cleaning the carburetor.
Brochures describing the Ciao
state that dealers and service cen
ters have been set up nationwide.
Vespa, the manufacturer of the
Ciao, is an old Italian firm.
The Ciao has a good practical
design, says Secrest. As well as
being economical to use, it takes
up little space either on the road or
while parked.
Secrest says that she can carry
three bags of groceries on her
Ciao, as there are both front and
rear racks.
Other equipment includes front
and rear lights and of course, the
50cc gasoline engine.
If you should decide to Use your
Ciao for exercise, you just simply
pedal. While the gearing is rather
low (it compares to a sting ray),
this is needed for the relatively
high weight — 75 pounds. Pedal
ing will move the machine as fast
as 10 mph.
One of the problems mopeds
have had in attaining popularity is
that California used to term them a
motorcycle, subject to vehicle re
gistration. As of Jan. 1, however,
mopeds have become bicycles
under state law.
"Look out on the road these

days," Secrest says. "Most cars
only have one person in them. I
think much of the legislation pas
sed was aimed at getting people
out of their cars, and reducing
intra-city congestion, not to men
tion prolonging our oil resen/es."
Despite their new legal status,
some have wondered whether
their use is legal on campus.
When first approached, Univer
sity authorities hadn't heard of the
new law regarding mopeds, which
under the old rules were illegal for
on-campus transportation. They
apparently hadn't received notice
of the changes in the California
Vehicle Code.
But Captain William
Wullschleger of the Stanford De
partment of Public Safety says
that after discussing the matter
with the California Department of
Motor Vehicles, the department
now allows the use of mopeds on
campus.
Yet some students have ex
pressed some concern over the
use of mopeds on campus.
"It's fun to ride, but I can't see it
out among the bicycles in White
Plaza at noon," says sophomore
Jim Moreci.
Freshman Sam Steinhardt ag
rees. "I love riding it, but it could be
hazardous around the Quad and
in bike lanes. You could kill some
body with it!"

MOPED MANlA—Mopeds, a combination motorcycle and bicycle, have become increasingly popular on
campus. Cheaper to own or operate than cars or motorcycles, mopeds also give the nder a rest on
those long hils. Furthermore, mopeds can go anywhere bicycles can while making far less noise than
motorcycles.
