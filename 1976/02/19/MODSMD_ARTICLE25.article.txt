How seldom we look back be
hind the glitter of minor legends.
Gypsy, the story of Gypsy Rose
Lee's climb to the spotlights, al
lows us just such a look. With an
entertaining blend of the mun
dane, the humorous, and the
touching, Gypsy opened in Toyon
Hall, a dormitory well known for its
previous productions.
Although cursed by occasional
dropped lines and songs lost amid
the orchestration, the acting was
generally quite good. The major
trio, Rose, Herbie, and Gypsy,
were excellent. Rose (Liza Kin
sell), the pushy mother of talent,
conveyed all the neurotic ambition
inherent in the role, while Herbie
(Brad Fisher), her agent and con
stant fiance, lent a breath of nor
mality to the frenzy of the play.
Their only flaw lay in their intermit
tant lapses of believable emotion.
Gypsy herself (Mireille Gassin)
is to be congratulated for her per
formance throughout. Her slow
growth from the naive "walk-on,"
lost in her sister's shadow, to
queen of the burlesque was ad
roitly handled.
Kudos also to Gypsy's heart
breaker, Tulsa (Clark Sterling),
who tap dances his way through
"All I Need Is a Girl" and into Gyp
sy's heart. The scene itself, one of
the show's high points, is both
lively and moving.
Mr. Goldstone (Mike Best), the

old startled benefactor caught up
in the exuberance of Rose's
troupe, stole his scene, drawing
gales of laughter without uttering a
sound. His expression of shock
and surprise as he is danced with,
flung about, and hoisted upon the
shoulders of the troupe engen
dered more delight and smiles
than an hour of comic dialogue
could have conjured.
Unmentioned, but necessary to
the final success of this charmed
and charming production, are the
sparkles and subtle touches of a
score of others. Crossed eyes and
scowling waitresses alike held the
audience in thrall. Although the
cast required time to warm up, it
rapidly hit its stride in such excel
lent scenes as that played on the
road to Los Angeles, dinner at the
Chinese restaurant (the most mel
low and down to earth scene of the
play), and the above mentioned
alleyway scene of Gypsy and
Tulsa.
Several well known songs
("Everything's Coming Up
Roses," "Small World," and "To
gether, Wherever We Go") were
sung with verve and spirit. How
ever, the energy of the show
peaked with "You Gotta Have a
Gimmick," the spicy self
advertisement of three strippers
whose paphian displays drew
hoots and laughter from their au
dience.

Although Gypsy ends on a
more wistful than burlesque note,
one wishes that the energy had
not fallen with the mood. Despite
the apparent loss of dramatic
focus, the production ended with
tenderness and power, a tribute to
the abilities of its cast and to its
director, Doug Bedard.
"Gypsy" plays through Sun
day. Performances are at 8 p.m.
through Saturday, and at 9:30
Sunday.
