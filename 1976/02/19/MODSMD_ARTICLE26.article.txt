## Upcoming extravaganza Oresteia: an inside view 
### Elliott Sroka 
"Where are we supposed to
be?"
"The Agamemnon chorus is re
hearsing with John onstage, the
Libation Bearers are in 204 for
music with e and Elliott,
Furies in the Little Theatre for a
runthrough with Michael. Please
see Mrs. Draper for some speech
coaching while you're not on, and
be ready to leave for your taping
by 10:45."
' What taping? I thought that
was next Wednesday."
For most of us connected with
the current Stanford Drama De
partment production of the Ores
teia Aischylos, the long days since
auditions appear now as a time of
alternating — and sometimes
simultaneous — inspiration and
frustration.
Collaboration
Any theatrical production is a
collaborative effort, as directors,
actors, designers and technicians
pool their ideas, creative im
pulses, and hard work towards the
making of a spectacle which pre
sents a unified and clear attitude
towards the play and its audience.
In musical theatre, we add the
contributions of composer,
choreographer, and musicians,
and we face the unique problems

presented b;, the actor/singer/
dancer.
The process of collaboration is
easiest with the kind of play whose
conventions are known to both
performer and spectator — as in
the American musical comedy.
Even an amateur group can pro
duce the most complicated of
musicals in a short rehearsal
period. Dance, singing, and
dramatic scenes can be worked
separately, and the various ele
ments can be put together in the
last phase without much danger of
disunity. But what about the kind
of play whose conventions are
foreign to us?
"You are playing captive East
ern women, mourning the death of
a good master. You must under
stand that each culture has its own
way of mourning. The Greeks do
not mourn like the Irish, and you
must forget your own cultural con
ditioning to perform this song
properly."
Director John Chioles could
have chosen to simplify there

hearsal process by establishing a
one-sided approach to the work,
based on his expertise in conven
tions of the ancient and contem
porary Greek theatres. Instead,
he chose to work with creative in
dividuals, like choreographer
Juan Valenzuela, whose experi
ence and point of view came from
other conventions in art.
"When I first agreed to do the
choreography for this production I
assumed I'd be working with
trained dancers," said Valen
zuela. "I admire the work Martha
Graham has done with Greek
tragedy, and I wanted to experi
ment in a similar way. But now I'm
glad that you are actors first, and I
understand why Graham didn't
us 9 words."
Unity
It is the unity of the Greek plays
that is most fascinating to us in the
theatre — the combination of
speech, singing, and movement.
"The taping of the singings is
next Wednesday. Tonight you are
taping the spoken rhythms."
"How are those going to work?"
"The taped sections will be
cued into the live action, to sup
port you. The rhythms Theodore
has put on those words will relate
indirectly to the underlying
rhythms of the music under the
scene, and will give extra em
phasis at key points."
Unconventional
Composer Theodore Antoniou,
like Chioles a native Greek,
shares the director's desire to
break from convention. Some
words are spoken, some are
sung. Electronic sounds and
orchestral music will underscore
scenes. Designers Richard Rid
dell and William Eddelman bring
all the resources of contemporary
staging to add to the freshness of
the approach.

"It takes me a full minute to get
down from the twenty-four foot
level. I can't do it any faster."
"Don't worry. There'll be music
underneath and some projections
on the sceen below you. While
we re stopped, please everyone
put on your masks. From this point
on you're not to work without
masks."
Just a week ago the entire cast
of all three plays sat down to see,
for the first time since read
throughs. a rehearsal of the trilogy
from beginning to end.
"We are in good shape We still
have many elements to add — the
lighting, the tapes, the costumes.
This next phase of work will be
difficult and frustrating. But finally,
Aischylos will carry us through."
And, come Tuesday night, the
24th in Memorial Auditorium, he
will.

"How are those going to work?"
"The taped sections will be
cued into the live action, to sup
port you. The rhythms Theodore
has put on those words will relate
indirectly to the underlying
rhythms of the music under the
scene, and will give extra em
phasis at key points."
Unconventional
Composer Theodore Antoniou,
like Chioles a native Greek,
shares the director's desire to
break from convention. Some
words are spoken, some are
sung. Electronic sounds and
orchestral music will underscore
scenes. Designers Richard Rid
dell and William Eddelman bring
all the resources of contemporary
staging to add to the freshness of
the approach.

"It takes me a full minute to get
down from the twenty-four foot
level. I can't do it any faster."
"Don't worry. There'll be music
underneath and some projections
on the sceen below you. While
we re stopped, please everyone
put on your masks. From this point
on you're not to work without
masks."
Just a week ago the entire cast
of all three plays sat down to see,
for the first time since read
throughs. a rehearsal of the trilogy
from beginning to end.
"We are in good shape We still
have many elements to add — the
lighting, the tapes, the costumes.
This next phase of work will be
difficult and frustrating. But finally,
Aischylos will carry us through."
And, come Tuesday night, the
24th in Memorial Auditorium, he

' What taping? I thought that
was next Wednesday."
For most of us connected with
the current Stanford Drama De
partment production of the Ores
teia Aischylos, the long days since
auditions appear now as a time of
alternating — and sometimes
simultaneous — inspiration and
frustration.
Collaboration
Any theatrical production is a
collaborative effort, as directors,
actors, designers and technicians
pool their ideas, creative im
pulses, and hard work towards the
making of a spectacle which pre
sents a unified and clear attitude
towards the play and its audience.
In musical theatre, we add the
contributions of composer,
choreographer, and musicians,
and we face the unique problems

presented b;, the actor/singer/
dancer.
The process of collaboration is
easiest with the kind of play whose
conventions are known to both
performer and spectator — as in
the American musical comedy.
Even an amateur group can pro
duce the most complicated of
musicals in a short rehearsal
period. Dance, singing, and
dramatic scenes can be worked
separately, and the various ele
ments can be put together in the
last phase without much danger of
disunity. But what about the kind
of play whose conventions are
foreign to us?
"You are playing captive East
ern women, mourning the death of
a good master. You must under
stand that each culture has its own
way of mourning. The Greeks do
not mourn like the Irish, and you
must forget your own cultural con
ditioning to perform this song
properly."
Director John Chioles could
have chosen to simplify there

hearsal process by establishing a
one-sided approach to the work,
based on his expertise in conven
tions of the ancient and contem
porary Greek theatres. Instead,
he chose to work with creative in
dividuals, like choreographer
Juan Valenzuela, whose experi
ence and point of view came from
other conventions in art.
"When I first agreed to do the
choreography for this production I
assumed I'd be working with
trained dancers," said Valen
zuela. "I admire the work Martha
Graham has done with Greek
tragedy, and I wanted to experi
ment in a similar way. But now I'm
glad that you are actors first, and I
understand why Graham didn't
us 9 words."
Unity
It is the unity of the Greek plays
that is most fascinating to us in the
theatre — the combination of
speech, singing, and movement.
"The taping of the singings is
next Wednesday. Tonight you are
taping the spoken rhythms."
"How are those going to work?"
"The taped sections will be
cued into the live action, to sup

The process of collaboration is
easiest with the kind of play whose
conventions are known to both
performer and spectator — as in
the American musical comedy.
Even an amateur group can pro
duce the most complicated of
musicals in a short rehearsal
period. Dance, singing, and
dramatic scenes can be worked
separately, and the various ele
ments can be put together in the
last phase without much danger of
disunity. But what about the kind
of play whose conventions are
foreign to us?
"You are playing captive East
ern women, mourning the death of
a good master. You must under
stand that each culture has its own
way of mourning. The Greeks do
not mourn like the Irish, and you
must forget your own cultural con
ditioning to perform this song
properly."
Director John Chioles could
have chosen to simplify there

hearsal process by establishing a
one-sided approach to the work,
based on his expertise in conven
tions of the ancient and contem
porary Greek theatres. Instead,
he chose to work with creative in
dividuals, like choreographer
Juan Valenzuela, whose experi
ence and point of view came from
other conventions in art.
"When I first agreed to do the
choreography for this production I
assumed I'd be working with
trained dancers," said Valen
zuela. "I admire the work Martha
Graham has done with Greek
tragedy, and I wanted to experi
ment in a similar way. But now I'm
glad that you are actors first, and I
understand why Graham didn't
us 9 words."
Unity
It is the unity of the Greek plays
that is most fascinating to us in the
theatre — the combination of
speech, singing, and movement.
"The taping of the singings is
next Wednesday. Tonight you are
taping the spoken rhythms."
"How are those going to work?"
"The taped sections will be
cued into the live action, to sup
port you. The rhythms Theodore
has put on those words will relate
indirectly to the underlying
rhythms of the music under the
scene, and will give extra em
phasis at key points."
Unconventional
Composer Theodore Antoniou,
like Chioles a native Greek,
shares the director's desire to
break from convention. Some
words are spoken, some are
sung. Electronic sounds and
orchestral music will underscore
scenes. Designers Richard Rid
dell and William Eddelman bring
all the resources of contemporary
staging to add to the freshness of
the approach.

"It takes me a full minute to get
down from the twenty-four foot
level. I can't do it any faster."
"Don't worry. There'll be music
underneath and some projections
on the sceen below you. While
we re stopped, please everyone
put on your masks. From this point
on you're not to work without
masks."
Just a week ago the entire cast
of all three plays sat down to see,
for the first time since read
throughs. a rehearsal of the trilogy
from beginning to end.
"We are in good shape We still
have many elements to add — the
lighting, the tapes, the costumes.
This next phase of work will be
difficult and frustrating. But finally,
Aischylos will carry us through."
And, come Tuesday night, the
24th in Memorial Auditorium, he
will.
