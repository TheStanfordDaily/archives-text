## Enrico IV triumphs THEATER 
### BoB Henry 
Italian playwright Luigi Pirandel
lo's Enrico IV, usually termed "a
rarely performed classic," is now
receiving one of its infrequent
productions by the California Ac
tors Theatre (CAT) at the Old
Town Theatre in Los Gatos.
The play resembles one of
those high school math problems
that have absolute values and
minus signs by the score, and one
must figure out whether the
number is positive or negative. In
Enrico IV, instead of positive or
negative, one must choose bet
ween sanity or insanity, truth or
falsity, reality or illusion, as well as
consider the tricky concept of
"time."
The leading character (played
by Dakin Matthews) is a fellow
who fell from a horse — which
may or may not have been due to
someone's jabbing of the horse's
flanks — and suffered logic
loosening head injuries. The fall
happened during a costume

pageant and as the man was
dressed as King Heinrich IV of
Germany, he assumed he was the
teutonic monarch.
From then on he dresses as the
King, and receives visitors only if
they put on appropriate eleventh
century costumes and assumes
the role of a historical character.
Abnormality
The play takes place as his
nephew, his ex-lover, her daugh
ter, her present lover and a
psychiatrist go to the villa 20 years
after the fall and try to cure him.
Using the symbols of a mirror, the
regal costumes and Enrico's
play-acting all superbly, Piran
dello explores the unmapped ac
reage between normality and ab

normality, truth and illusion, and
"now" and "then."
Pirandello has much to say in
his script. His biggest contention
seems to be that truth is entirely
subjective and personal, and var
ies from interpretation to interprta
ton. Therefore, sanity or insanity,
for instance, depends upon the
individual's point of view.
John Reich translated and di
rected CAT's production, and ful
fills both jobs expertly. His lively
direction fits Pirandello's farcical
humor well, but he also keeps the
play at a tempo that allows the
stimulation of thoughtful reaction
to the playwright's ideas.
Matthews gives an excellent
portrayal of Enrico, as he avers
brilliantly between raving mad
man, calculating eccentric, and
anguished lover. The rest of the
cast, especially Kurtwood Smith
as his replacement-in-love,
strongly supports him.
In its two hours, CAT'S Enrico IV
brings up many thought
provoking questions. Most of the
viewers left with a wry smile,
which would indicate either satis
faction or bemusement, or
perhaps both. The show closes
March 7.
