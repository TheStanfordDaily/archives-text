Ford orders spying limits
WASHINGTON — President Ford yes
terday ordered strict limits to spying on
American citizens but at the same time
proposed new powers for a centralized in
telligence community, including court
ordered mail opening and a secrecy law.
Except for a ban on political assassina
tions. Ford placed no limits on covert opera
tions abroad. ' There are no restraints on
the conduct of covert operations . . other
than congressional oversight,'" White
House aide John Marsh told reporters.
Ford proposed secrecy legislation that
would make it a crime to reveal intelligence
sources and methods. He ordered govern
ment employes and contractors with ac
cess to intelligence secrets to sign an ag
reement not to disclose those secrets.
The attorney general could bring a civil
suit against any person breaking the ag
reement. wmle anyone violating the prop
osed law would be liable to a maximum
penalty of a S5OOO fine and five years in jail,
under Ford's plan
Reacting to disclosure of abuses by U.S.
intelligence agencies, Ford issued a 36-
page executive order yesterday expanding
on his statement Tuesday night at a news
conference.
With certain "limited exceptions,'' Ford's
order, effective March 1, places the follow
ing limits on intelligence activities
—No electronic eavesdropping by the
CIA inside the United States.
—No interception by the National Sec
urity Agency of communications to or from
the United States.
—No collection of information on the
domestic activities of American citizens.

corporations and organizations.
—No physical surveillance c? break-ins
directed aganst U.S. citizens.
—No infiltration of domestic groups for
the purpose of influencing or reporting on
them.
British recognize MPLA
LONDON — Britain and seven other
European countries recognized the
Soviet-backed Popular Movement (MPLA)
yesterday as the legal government of An
gola, but West Germany held back.
Meanwhile, from the battlefields in
southwest Africa came reports of new
MPLA victories.
Recognizing the MPLA along with Britain
were Denmark. Ireland, Italy, The Nether
lands. Norway. Sweden and Switzerland
France had extended recognition on Tues
day.
The Soviet news agency Tass said the
recognitions were a new blow to the plans
of the imperialist elements in the U.S.A.,
some of the NATO bloc member countries,
the racist regime of South Africa and the
Maoists aligned with them ..."
West Germany will decide the recogni
tion question "at an appropriate time,'' a
Bonn government spokesman said. He
said German officials were concerne'd over
"developments characterized by foreign in
tervention" in the former Portuguese col-

ony.
Military aid bill passes
WASHINGTON — The Senate yester
day passed a $4.4-bil!ion foreign military
aid bill tightening congressional control
over mounting U.S. arms sales to foreign
nations.
The final vote was 60 to 30, sending the
measure to the House, where a similar bill is
nearing final committee action.
Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D-Minn.) floor
manager of the Senate measure, called it
the most significant revision of legislative
authorities for foreign military assistance
and sales since enactment of the mutual
security act more than a quarter of a century
ago."
The Senate measure requires the execu
tive branch to notify Congress of proposals
for commercial or government sales of
major weapons and any arms exports in
amounts of $25 million or more. It allows
Congress to disapprove the sales by major
ity vote in both chambers within 30 days.
Principal assistance will go to Middle
East countries, with Israel earmarked for
grants and credits supporting $2.2 billion in
U.S. arms imports.
The bill includes $3.05 billion in direct
military aid to foreign countries, as well as
$1.35 billion in loan guarantees.

A-plants dangerous?
WASHINGTON — Three nuclear
specialists said yesterday all nuclear power
plants in the United States have serious
engineer deficiencies which make a
dangerous reactor accident likely by the
year 2000.
The three, who resigned Feb. 2 from
General Electric s Nuclear Division to warn
of such perils, also said industry and the
federal government are aware of the prob
lems in nuclear reactors but are not acting
fast enough to attempt to find a solution.
They also told the Senate-House Atomic
Energy Committee that industry appears to
be more concerned with cost factors of
shutting down a nuclear plant to correct
problems than it is with public safety.
Soviets: radiation normal
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union yester
day took up the question of radiation re
ported at the American Embassy in Mos
cow, dismissing it as ordinary elec
tromagnetic activity normal for a large city
and not hazardous to health.
The government newspaper tzvestia cal
led Western news reports about a danger
ous level of radioactivity as "lies . . .
trumped up from beginning to end."
The paper declared they were aimed at un
dermining Soviet-U.S. understanding.
Today's weather
Rain likely this morning. Partly cloudy
with a chance of showers this afternoon and
evening. Clearing tonight. Then fair tomor
row. Lows tonight in the low to mid 40s.

British recognize MPLA
LONDON — Britain and seven other
European countries recognized the
Soviet-backed Popular Movement (MPLA)
yesterday as the legal government of An
gola, but West Germany held back.
Meanwhile, from the battlefields in
southwest Africa came reports of new
MPLA victories.
Recognizing the MPLA along with Britain
were Denmark. Ireland, Italy, The Nether
lands. Norway. Sweden and Switzerland
France had extended recognition on Tues
day.
The Soviet news agency Tass said the
recognitions were a new blow to the plans
of the imperialist elements in the U.S.A.,
some of the NATO bloc member countries,
the racist regime of South Africa and the
Maoists aligned with them ..."
West Germany will decide the recogni
tion question "at an appropriate time,'' a
Bonn government spokesman said. He

"developments characterized by foreign in
tervention" in the former Portuguese col-

Military aid bill passes
WASHINGTON — The Senate yester
day passed a $4.4-bil!ion foreign military
aid bill tightening congressional control
over mounting U.S. arms sales to foreign
nations.
The final vote was 60 to 30, sending the
measure to the House, where a similar bill is
nearing final committee action.
Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D-Minn.) floor
manager of the Senate measure, called it
the most significant revision of legislative
authorities for foreign military assistance
and sales since enactment of the mutual
security act more than a quarter of a century
ago."
The Senate measure requires the execu
tive branch to notify Congress of proposals
for commercial or government sales of
major weapons and any arms exports in
amounts of $25 million or more. It allows
Congress to disapprove the sales by major
ity vote in both chambers within 30 days.
Principal assistance will go to Middle
East countries, with Israel earmarked for
grants and credits supporting $2.2 billion in
U.S. arms imports.
The bill includes $3.05 billion in direct
military aid to foreign countries, as well as
$1.35 billion in loan guarantees.

A-plants dangerous?
WASHINGTON — Three nuclear
specialists said yesterday all nuclear power
plants in the United States have serious
engineer deficiencies which make a
dangerous reactor accident likely by the
year 2000.
The three, who resigned Feb. 2 from
General Electric s Nuclear Division to warn
of such perils, also said industry and the
federal government are aware of the prob
lems in nuclear reactors but are not acting
fast enough to attempt to find a solution.
They also told the Senate-House Atomic
Energy Committee that industry appears to
be more concerned with cost factors of
shutting down a nuclear plant to correct
problems than it is with public safety.

ous level of radioactivity as "lies . . .
trumped up from beginning to end."
The paper declared they were aimed at un
dermining Soviet-U.S. understanding.

day passed a $4.4-bil!ion foreign military
aid bill tightening congressional control
over mounting U.S. arms sales to foreign
nations.
The final vote was 60 to 30, sending the
measure to the House, where a similar bill is
nearing final committee action.
Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D-Minn.) floor
manager of the Senate measure, called it
the most significant revision of legislative
authorities for foreign military assistance
and sales since enactment of the mutual
security act more than a quarter of a century
ago."
The Senate measure requires the execu
tive branch to notify Congress of proposals
for commercial or government sales of
major weapons and any arms exports in
amounts of $25 million or more. It allows
Congress to disapprove the sales by major
ity vote in both chambers within 30 days.
Principal assistance will go to Middle
East countries, with Israel earmarked for
grants and credits supporting $2.2 billion in
U.S. arms imports.
The bill includes $3.05 billion in direct
military aid to foreign countries, as well as
$1.35 billion in loan guarantees.

A-plants dangerous?
WASHINGTON — Three nuclear
specialists said yesterday all nuclear power
plants in the United States have serious
engineer deficiencies which make a
dangerous reactor accident likely by the
year 2000.
The three, who resigned Feb. 2 from
General Electric s Nuclear Division to warn
of such perils, also said industry and the
federal government are aware of the prob
lems in nuclear reactors but are not acting
fast enough to attempt to find a solution.
They also told the Senate-House Atomic
Energy Committee that industry appears to
be more concerned with cost factors of
shutting down a nuclear plant to correct
problems than it is with public safety.
