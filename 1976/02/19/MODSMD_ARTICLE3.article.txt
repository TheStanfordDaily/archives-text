# OPINIONS
## Investments

I am writing hopefully to clear up
some misconceptions surround
ing the suggestion in a Feb. 6
Daily editorial that the ASSU's in
vestment funds not be profes
sionally managed.
Misconception No. 1: employ
ing an outside portfolio manager is
curiously similar to the idea of a
full-time financial manager.
Employing a full-time financial
manager (which incidentally I op
pose) means bringing a profes
sional m-house to manage the
ASSU Professional money man
agement, however, would be
merely the delegation of one very
specialized facet of the ASSU to
an outside professional specializ
ing in investments.
Misconception No. 2: a profes
sional money manager would be
one step removed from having
total discretion in investment de
cisions.
Investment managers may be
given whatever leeway is desired
by their clients. Thus, the ASSU
could set quite specific paramet
ers within which the professionals
would be bound to operate.
Bad precedent?
Misconception No. 3: hiring of
an outside investment manage
ment firm would set a bad prece
dent for ouside professionals to
begin assisting other ASSU pro
jects
Again the distinction must be
drawn between bringing in an out
sider to manage a project and de
legating specialized functions
where a professional has more
experience ASSU Special
Events, for example, already uses
a San Francisco publicist. This
publicist does not manage Special
Events, but simply provides a
senvce in an area where his ex
pertise is greater than that of the
Special Events director. An in
vestment management service
would assume a parallel role.
Misconception No. 4: the finan
cial manager is hired because he
is experienced in investment de
cisions and capable of operating
without supervision.
The financial manager is hired
because he is a good manager,
period Ninety-five percent of his
time must be devoted to supervis
ing the ASSU banking operation
and projects. Only roughly five
percent of his time can be allo
cated to studying investment al
ternatives.

Let s assume that the ASSU
can locate that business superstar
who is both a brilliant manager
and a top-notch investment per
son. Still, how effectively can he
compete with full-time market pro
fessionals when he devotes one
20th the time to the same
job?
Lastly, one opens a Pandora's
box of monstrous proportions in
allowing one individual to make
indapendent investment deci
sions. This fact was recently noted
by the outside accounting firm
which audits the SU's oooks in
a letter to Bill Hoke. ASSU senate
chairman, ana through personal
conversations with members of
this firm.
Whether or not an individual is
capable of operating without
supervision is not the issue. Given
the enormous responsibility of
portfolio investment, supervision
or guidance by some outside party
is mandatory. The financial man
ager currently benefits from the
aid of Rod Adams, director of fi
nance, in formulating investment
decisions.
Profit making
Misconception No. 5: generat
ing funds from invested capital
represents profit making."
Returns from invested capital
are by no means profits. The grea
ter the funds the ASSU can
generate via its investments the
lower prices need be on student
services To the extent the ASSU
does not generate as high a return
as possible on its investment
portfolio, students are indeed
being ripped off."
I contend no financial manager
can possibly have the expertise or
the time to devote to formulating
investment decisions so as to
compete favorably against pro
fessionals whose livelihood is the
market. At the same time I think it
is premature to press for a deci
sion at this point; I personally am
not fully aware of the implications
of available alternatives.
I suggest convening a commit
tee to explore different investment
management possibilities and
then give a recommendation to
the ASSU Senate. This would be
the first step toward making full
use of the investment potential of
the ASSU s funds for the benefit of
all students.
