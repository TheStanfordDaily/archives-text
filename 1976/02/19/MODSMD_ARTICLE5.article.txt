# Angela's own evangelism
## 
### 
Angela is Coming! Chalkboards
and posters herald her approach
to Stanford. That's Angela! Hand
bills and newspapers trumpet her
entry here. Hear her talk on "The
Great Proletariat Revolution
Hoax," Monday night at Kresge
Auditorium.
Angela is Coming! Listen to her
speech on "Maximum Society,"
Tuesday night at Mem Chu.
Angela is Coming! Angela is Com
ing! Sponsored by Campus
Crusade for Communism and
Stanford Communists for En
lightened Minds (SCEM). Angela
is Coming!
The Stanford masses are seem
ingly unimpressed. "Angela is
coming; so is Christmas," they
scoff. Who wants to hear some
fanatic anyway? tho ad
vertising is insulting.
Some of the leftist groups on
campus are divided on the use of
bourgeois advertising ploys" to
promote someone they so highly
respect.
"She is a learned scholar and a
true disciple of the Cause. These
garish posters make her look like
a Marxist Bozo-the-Clown,' some
contend.
Gaudy techniques?
Others disagree. The
techniques may be a bit gaudy,
but they will bring the people, and
we are interested in sharing with
the masses the good news of
socialist revolution.
Concerned citizens write letters
to the editor blasting Angela and
her hard-sell campaign. Reac
tions include:
"I don't like reading. Quit Stalin;
go see Angela' on every
chalkboard."
"We should study this group as
a part of the lunatic fringe."
Others are more terse:
"That's littering!"
"That's disgusting!"
"That's Angela!"
The first night, Kresge is packed
with people. Angela, smiling and
happy, mingles with the audience.
She moves onstage and
everyone hushes and waits.
Well-Red
Smirking, Angela says, "I've
heard that, here at Stanford, you
read a lot of books on com
munism. Does that make you
well-Red?' " The crowd relaxes

with her warm and friendly words.
Angela moves closer to the
crowd and says, "Tonight, men
and women, I'd like to explain why
I'm a communist. I'll quote from
Marx 25:42-43, a passage I used
in my book A Verdict that De
mands Evidence.
She begins, " 'I saw people
hungry and no one gave them
food, thirsty and no one gave them

drink. I saw strangers and no one
welcomed them, sick c-r>d in prison
and no one visited them." That's
why I'm a communist."
"I'm going to give all of you the
chance to become communists.
Just repeat after me, "I realize that
I've been a rotten capitalist, a run
ning dog lackey of the ruling class.
I repent and accept Marxism into
my heart. Thank you." Those of

you who said that right along with
me are now true believers.
As the meeting ends, a new
convert struts out beaming, carry
ing a brand new "Communist
Manifesto" under his arm and a
copy of "The Four Economic
Laws." He enters the Coffee
House and sees two of his friends.
"Hey guys, I accepted com
munism tonight," the initiate de
clares. The other two mutter under
their breaths, "Lenin Freak, Red
hot."
The new convert sits at his
friends' table, makes the sign of
the hammer and sickle, and be
gins his own sermon.
"Angela's talk was great. She
talked about the Fall of the Sys
tem, the Love of Marx and said
without the shedding of blood
there can be no revolution. I was
miserable and incomplete until I
let communism into my life."
The two looked at each other,
and smiled. One said to the con
vert, "You sound just like a Christ
ian. But â€” I don't think Marx ever
rose from the dead. .
