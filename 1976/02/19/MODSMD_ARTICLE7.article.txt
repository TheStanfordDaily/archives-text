## CIA beyond Congress' control? 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) â€” The House
intelligence committee concluded
that, because of administration
resistance to supplying secret in
formation, U.S. intelligence agen
cies are, today, beyond the
scrutiny of Congress, according to
a document which the Village
Voice published yesterday and
identified as part of the commit
tee's still-secret report.
The committee, which reviewed
covert intelligence operations
since 1965, also said "paramilit
ary operations of the worst type
seemed to come from outside" the
CIA and were ordered by former
President Nixon and Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger, the Voice
report said.
The statement was made in re
ference to U.S. activities in Chile
during the presidency of Salvador
Allende and U.S. support for the
now-ended Kurdish rebellion in
Iraq.
The Voice, a New York City
weekly newspaper, last week pub
lished what it said was the inves
tigative section of the committee's
report. Daniel Schorr, CBS
newsman, said earlier he supplied
the Voice with a copy of the re
port.
Leak investigation
The Justice Department said
Tuesday it may investigate the
leak which led to initial publication
of the report by the Voice last
weekend.
Rep. Samuel S. Stratton (D-
N.Y.) said yesterday he plans to
ask for a formal House investiga
tion.
The Voice said it was publish
ing the material printed yesterday
because it provides perspective
for understanding the reaction of
administration officials to the sec
tion it published last week.
The material published by the
Voice yesterday detailed the dif
ficulties the committee had in sec
uring secret information from the
White House, the intelligence
agencies and FBI, the State De
partment, and other agencies of
the executive branch.
Not much new
Other than specifics of these
problems, and statements of the
committee's reaction, there was
little, if anything, in the 20 pages
that had not previously been
made public by other newspapers
and news organizations.
Although numerous public
statements of cooperation with
the committee were made by the
executive branch and the intelli
gence agencies, the report said:
"The reality was delay, refusal,
missing information, asserted

privileges and on and on.
"If this committee's recent ex
perience is any test, intelligence
agencies that are to be controlled
by congressional lawmaking are,
today, beyond the lawmaker's
scrutiny."
The report said there are
15,466 persons in the executive
branch who can classify informa
tion. "What it all means is that
there must be a responsible sys
tem of classification, accom
panied by an equally responsible
and offoet system of declassifica
tion. We have neither."
