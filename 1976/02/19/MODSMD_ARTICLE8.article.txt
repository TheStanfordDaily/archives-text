# California drought lingers; Lake Lag remains unfilled

Lake Lagunita will not be filled
up this year, should the current
drought continue much longer,
according to Plant Utilities Man
ager Robert McKnight. "Unless
Stanford gets a few good days of
rain soon," said McKnight, "the
lake's chances of getting any

water at all will be very, very mini
mal."
The current three-month-old
drought has plagued areas
throughout California, with losses
to farmers and cattlemen
statewide estimated at over $300
million. Gov. Edmund Brown has
declared 25 California counties as

disaster areas and requested
emergency federal aid for them.
"The rain locally over the past
few days has helped, but it just
hasn't been enough," said
McKnight.
Water in both Searsville and
Felt Lakes is down to its minimal
reserve level, said McKnight.

Lake Lagunita is fed by two
creeks, Los Trancos and San
Francisquito. However, either
Searsville or Felt must be full or
nearly full before any excess
water can drain into the creeks.
"One good rain should fill
Searsville," said McKnight. "But
for now we have no intentions of
unloading any of Searsville or Felt
Lake water into Lagunita until their
levels are sufficiently high."
The last time a drought severely
affected the campus was in 1961,
when a water rationing program
had to be implemented. But even
then, Lake Lagunita had some wa
ter, according to Plant Services
Water and Sewer Superintendent
Joe Carrington.
Carnngton said that Felt Lake is
currently 11 feet short of last
year's mark, while Searsville Lake
is 9Vz feet short. Last year at this
time all three lakes were full.
Water from Searsville and Felt
Lakes is used primarily by the
Stanford Golf Course, the single
greatest user on campus, and by
local farmers and cattlemen leas
ing University land.
Lake water is also used to sup
ply parts of the Quad and west
side of campus, while serving as a
reserve backup for the Stanford
Fire Department. Most of the Uni
versity, including residence halls
and academic buildings, is on the
San Francisco Municipal system,
which has yet to be greatly af
fected by the drought, according
to McKnight.
"Searsville Lake is vital for two
main reasons," said McKnight
"First, of course, is its valuable

HOW DRY I AM — Unless long-awaited rains put an end to California's three-month-old drought,
water-starved Lake Lagunita may stay dry throughout the sprina and summer, to the dismay of local
swimmers and sailors. Other nearby lakes are also suffering from severe and near-severe water
shortages, but none look quite as bad as the barren scene above.
water supply: secondly, it is also
valuable as a recreational area,
which brings in considerable re
venue to the University in the
summer.
"The situation is not at a critical
stage yet, but if there is no rain in
the next couple of weeks, we will
start pumping water from the Uni
versity wells, which will cost us
about $500 a week. The users af
fected the most will be the Golf
Course and the farmers and cat

tlemen."
"It could get quite serious if it
doesn't rain significantly the re
mainder of February,'' said Golf
Course Superintendent Bryce
Weeks.
Fire Department Chief Frank
Jurian also expressed concern.
"One fourth of our supply comes
from Searsville and Felt," he said,
"and not too many options will be
left to us if we get low on our bare
reserves."
Hard hit financially by the
drought have been local cattle
men leasing University land. Stan
ford leases 3500 acres of agricul
tural use.
According to George Burtness.
assistant manager of university
land resources, the lack of fresh
grass has forced them to ship in
more hay than usual, which has
been both costlier for the cattle
men and not as healthy for their
livestock.
"We're just as bad off as the rest
of the cattlemen and farmers in
the state," said Manuel Piers, a
local dairyman. ' But we will stick it
out."
