# Hearst says she still fears death at hands of SLA
## 
### Blake Hallanan 
In her third and final day of di
rect examination by defense at
torney F. Lee Bailey yesterday,
Patricia Hearst testified that she
still fears for her life, saying, "I
think there's a good chance I
could be killed'' by friends or
members of the Symbionese Lib
eration Army (SLA).
Amid added security protection
in the courtroom resulting from an
earlier threat on her family, Hearst
retraced the events that occurred
after the April 15, 1974 bank rob
bery for which she is charged.
Along with others in the cour
troom. Hearst also watched a film
of the gun battle between police
and SLA members in a shootout at
an SLA hideout in Los Angeles a
little more than a month after the
robbery.
During her four-hour testimony,
Hearst also explained how she
had been trained to open fire on
anyone who might endanger SLA
members.

More specifically, Hearst de
scribed how she fired a sub
machi'-.w yu-r - in an attempt to pro
tect SLA members William and
Emily Harris while they fled from a
sporting goods store. The Har
rises and Hearst had driven to the
store to buy food and clothing. A
store manager allegedly saw Wil
liam Harris hide socks in his pants,
and attempted to stop the theft.
"As soon as I sensed that some
thing was wrong," Hearst said,
she started shooting. "I picked up
the gun and started firing at the top
of the building. Itwasjustareflex. I
didn't even think about it."
She said she had to fire be
cause if she didn't she would be
killed.
Hearst next described how she
and the Harrises retreated to a
van, jumped in and drove away.
She said William Harris began yel
ling at her because she didn't
shoot fast enough.
Fearing police apprehension,

the Harrises and Hearst did not
return to the Los Angeles hideout,
Hearst testified. Instead, they
drove to Anaheim, checking into a
hotel across the street from Dis
neyland, Hearst said. As soon as
they got to the room, she testified,
the Harrises turned on the televi
sion and they all watched a film of
the shootout.
Here Bailey ordered the shoot
out film to be shown. Sounds of
gunfire echoed through the court
room, as the jurors gazed at a
curved four-by-six foot screen and
saw flames of the burning hide
out. Hearst remained calm as she
looked at the screen.
Hearst later told about SLA
leader Donald "Cinque" De-
Freeze's plans to begin "search
and destroy" missions aimed at
randomly killing police. She also
described continual training les
sons she received in how to
handle guns while at the hideout.
Hearst also testified that after
remaining three days at the
Anaheim motel, the Harrises
drove her to Costa Mesa and on to
the Bay Area. In Berkeley, Hearst
said she met Kathy Soliah and
Jack Scott. She testified Scott
said he was going to help them
drive east, where police capture
would be less likely. She said the
Harrises and Scott planned to
write an SLA propaganda book
that Scott hoped to publish later.
Next, a June 7 tape, Hearst's
final communique while with the
SLA, played for the jury. Hearst
testified that the Harrises had
composed the message she was
to read. Hearst said that none of
the tape was in her own words.
While listening to the recording,
Hearst gazed downward, sighing
heavily at times. She appeared
pained as she heard her voice

vehemently condemning her pa
rents as "Hearst pigs."
Briefly describing her four-day
journey to the East, Hearst told
how the Harrises made her use
the name "Pearl."
Hearst said she met FBI fugitive
Wendy Yoshimura for the first
time at the Scott's New York
apartment.
Bailey questioned Hearst about
events leading up to her arrest in
September. Hearst said the
reason why she and Yoshimura
lived in separate houses in San
Francisco was because of con
tinual arguments.
At the conclusion of direct
examination by Bailey, James
Browning, prosecuting attorney,
briefly questioned Hearst about
her past involvement with politics
and with social reform.
"Would it be fair to say that you
were interested in revolution and
social change?"

"I'd say I was interested in so
cial changes."
"Violent social change?"
"No. nonviolent."
Browning is expected to con
tinue his cross-examination
throughout today. After the cross
examination, Bailey is expected to
give a rebuttal.
