### Blake Hallanan 
In her third and final day of di
rect examination by defense at
torney F. Lee Bailey yesterday,
Patricia Hearst testified that she
still fears for her life, saying, "I
think there's a good chance I
could be killed'' by friends or
members of the Symbionese Lib
eration Army (SLA).
Amid added security protection
in the courtroom resulting from an
earlier threat on her family, Hearst
retraced the events that occurred
after the April 15, 1974 bank rob
bery for which she is charged.
Along with others in the cour
troom. Hearst also watched a film
of the gun battle between police
and SLA members in a shootout at
an SLA hideout in Los Angeles a
little more than a month after the
robbery.
During her four-hour testimony,
Hearst also explained how she
had been trained to open fire on
anyone who might endanger SLA
members.

More specifically, Hearst de
scribed how she fired a sub

tect SLA members William and
Emily Harris while they fled from a
sporting goods store. The Har

store to buy food and clothing. A
store manager allegedly saw Wil

"As soon as I sensed that some
thing was wrong," Hearst said,
she started shooting. "I picked up
the gun and started firing at the top
of the building. Itwasjustareflex. I
didn't even think about it."
She said she had to fire be

killed.
Hearst next described how she
and the Harrises retreated to a
van, jumped in and drove away.
She said William Harris began yel
ling at her because she didn't
shoot fast enough.
Fearing police apprehension,

the Harrises and Hearst did not
return to the Los Angeles hideout,
Hearst testified. Instead, they
drove to Anaheim, checking into a
hotel across the street from Dis
neyland, Hearst said. As soon as
they got to the room, she testified,
the Harrises turned on the televi
sion and they all watched a film of
the shootout.
Here Bailey ordered the shoot
out film to be shown. Sounds of
gunfire echoed through the court
room, as the jurors gazed at a
curved four-by-six foot screen and
saw flames of the burning hide
out. Hearst remained calm as she
looked at the screen.
Hearst later told about SLA
leader Donald "Cinque" De-
Freeze's plans to begin "search
and destroy" missions aimed at
randomly killing police. She also
described continual training les
