MITRE is a place which daily faces the challenge of minds over matter, and where,
even more importantly, minds matter a lot. Since we're a nonprofit system engineer
ing company operating wholly in the public interest and dealing with tough problems
assigned to us by more than a score of governmental agencies, we know that our
greatest resource is the human mind. And we know that the kind of mind we need
also needs to knowthat it will be working on important problems with other profes
sionals. What's more, we'll be quite specific in spelling out your assignment to you.
All of this because you matter... and because at MITRE, minds matter.
We are currently seeking new graduates to work in command and control systems,
information processing systems, electronic surveillance and communications
systems.
If you're an EE, Computer Science, Math or Operations Research major, you could
be working on problems in digital information systems, data handling and reduction,
microprogramming techniques, data base structure, time sharing, text processing,
management information systems, computer program design and development or
evaluation of present day software for phase-over to next generation machines.
Or, you might want to get involved with telecommunications, voice communications,
microwave and digital signal processing, radar design, propagation studies or
advanced modulation, coding, error control and data compression techniques. These
are just a few of the areas in which you might get involved at MITRE.
All of these positions require a minimum of a BS degree. If you have more than a
bachelor's, that's even better. Almost % of our 750 technical staff members have
advanced degrees.
These opening are at our corporate headquarters at Bedford, Massachusetts
(suburban Boston). If you are interested and think you can meet our standards,
send us your resume. Better yet, we'd like to talk to you on campus. Sign up at your
Placement Office. We'll be there on February 26 and 27.
