# Guest professorship
## Board withdraws Mandel invitation 
### George Anders 
The ASSU Guest Professorship
Board has rescinded its invitation for
Belgian economist Ernest Mandel to
teach here next quarter, senior Andrea
Halliday, a board member, said yester
day.
The board's action was prompted,
Halliday explained, when it received a
telegram Wednesday from Mandel
stating that he would only be able to
teach from May 12 to June 9.
Senior Gordon Wheat, another
board member, explained, • "That
couldn't fit in with the program. An
important part of the program is in
teraction with students, which
wouldn't be facilitated if he came
late."
Halliday added that another reason
the board rejected Mandel's bid was
because she doubted "you can arrange
credit for a three-week course."
There is a small chance the board
could reinvite Mandel for spring quar
ter, Halliday said, "if we get a lot of
student feedback saying 'yes' to the
idea of a three-week non-credit
course."
No indication
Mandel's telegram "didn't indicate
at all why he couldn't come for the full
time," Halliday said. She added that in
earlier discussions the Trotskyist
economist had not objected to teach
ing for the full quarter.
"We could have gotten a little more
of a square treatment out of him,"
Wheat remarked.
Mandel did express an interest in
teaching here during either the sum
mer or fall terms. Halliday said the
board had considered inviting Mandel
for the summer, but rejected the idea.
"A lot of students aren't around dur
ing the summer," she explained. "We

felt it would not be an appropriate time
to invite him."
New board
The board will recommend that
Mandel be considered for a future
guest professorship. However, any de
cision about a guest professorship next
year would be made by a new ASSU
Guest Professorship Board, to be
formed this spring.
Dave Galligan, ASSU vice president,
explained that the new board will con
sist of two members chosen by the
ASSU Nominating Committee, as well
as three other members to be chosen by
the policy boards of the Action Re
search Liaison Office (ARLO), Stan
ford Workshops on Political and So
cial Issues (SWOPSI) and Student
Center for Innovation in Research and
Education (SCIRE).
Galligan said he was "just about de
finite" that a replacement for Mandel
would be found for next year.
Wheat also said he expects unused
funds "to be saved for bringing some
one next year."
"It's entirely too late to even con
sider the possibility of getting another
guest professor for this spring," Wheat
said.
Mandel was notified by telegram
yesterday that the board could not
offer him a guest professorship, Wheat
said. The other two candidates,
Marxist philosopher Angela Davis and
clinical psychologist Claude Steiner,
have agreed to come for spring quarter,
Wheat added.
Mandel, the editor of a Marxist
newspaper in Belgium, was invited to
speak here seven years ago at a confer
ence on "Technology and the Third
World." However, he was denied a
visa by the State Department after the
attorney general objected to Mandel's
communist ideology.

board member, explained, • "That
couldn't fit in with the program. An
important part of the program is in
teraction with students, which
wouldn't be facilitated if he came
late."
Halliday added that another reason
the board rejected Mandel's bid was
because she doubted "you can arrange
credit for a three-week course."
There is a small chance the board
could reinvite Mandel for spring quar
ter, Halliday said, "if we get a lot of
student feedback saying 'yes' to the
idea of a three-week non-credit
course."
No indication
Mandel's telegram "didn't indicate
at all why he couldn't come for the full
time," Halliday said. She added that in
earlier discussions the Trotskyist
economist had not objected to teach
ing for the full quarter.
"We could have gotten a little more
of a square treatment out of him,"
Wheat remarked.
Mandel did express an interest in
teaching here during either the sum
mer or fall terms. Halliday said the
board had considered inviting Mandel
for the summer, but rejected the idea.
"A lot of students aren't around dur
ing the summer," she explained. "We

felt it would not be an appropriate time
to invite him."
New board
The board will recommend that
Mandel be considered for a future
guest professorship. However, any de
cision about a guest professorship next
year would be made by a new ASSU
Guest Professorship Board, to be
formed this spring.
Dave Galligan, ASSU vice president,
explained that the new board will con
sist of two members chosen by the
ASSU Nominating Committee, as well
as three other members to be chosen by
the policy boards of the Action Re
search Liaison Office (ARLO), Stan
ford Workshops on Political and So
cial Issues (SWOPSI) and Student
Center for Innovation in Research and
Education (SCIRE).
Galligan said he was "just about de
finite" that a replacement for Mandel
would be found for next year.
Wheat also said he expects unused
funds "to be saved for bringing some
one next year."
"It's entirely too late to even con
sider the possibility of getting another
guest professor for this spring," Wheat
said.
Mandel was notified by telegram
yesterday that the board could not
offer him a guest professorship, Wheat
said. The other two candidates,
Marxist philosopher Angela Davis and
clinical psychologist Claude Steiner,
have agreed to come for spring quarter,
Wheat added.
Mandel, the editor of a Marxist
newspaper in Belgium, was invited to
speak here seven years ago at a confer
ence on "Technology and the Third
World." However, he was denied a
visa by the State Department after the
attorney general objected to Mandel's
communist ideology.
The ASSU Guest Professorship
Board has rescinded its invitation for
Belgian economist Ernest Mandel to
teach here next quarter, senior Andrea
Halliday, a board member, said yester
day.
The board's action was prompted,
Halliday explained, when it received a
telegram Wednesday from Mandel
stating that he would only be able to
teach from May 12 to June 9.
Senior Gordon Wheat, another
board member, explained, • "That
