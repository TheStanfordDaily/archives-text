# Letters: Prof. Fromme, USE repression, alienation

### 
Invite 'the Squeaker'
Former President Richard Ni
xon. Marxist Angela Davis.
Trotskyist Ernest Mandel.
All of these notables have re
cently drawn front page recogni
tion in the Daily by re
ceiving consideration from the
ASSU Guest Professorship
Board for teaching positions
here next quarter. And now the
ASSU Senate has offered the
students a Communist three
pak.
Apparently, these two legisla
tive bodies have taken a cue from
the Howard Commission's
offbeat admissions idea, bv de

ciding to consider only eminent
representatives of extremist
viewpoints.
We are appalled!
The notion behind this selec
tion policy is to present the Stan
ford community with alternative
approaches to our country's
problems. We feel the Board and
Senate have taken a step in the
right direction, but have pain
fully failed to make a significant
move and entertain truly unique
outlooks on the political spec
trum.
In this spirit we would like to
make one last recommendation
for a guest professorship:
Lynette Fromme. There would,

of course, be objections.
There are those who say
Fromme's voice carries poorly in
large lecture halls. However, re
striction of class size would
allow "The Squeaker" to over
come this drawback and effec
tively reach her students.
There are also those who
might maintain inviting
Fromme is impractical since she
has already been slated for a
guest shot at a federal dormitory
here in California. This is incon
sequential.
Practicality has never influ
enced the decisions of student
government before and we see
no reason to start now.
The concepts Fromme has to
offer far outweigh the difficul
ties involved with bringing her
here.
Imagine, "Botany 13: The Ef
fect of Presidential Assassina
tions on Redwood Preserva
tion," right here at Stanford. Or.
"Physics O: How to Shoot Prom
inent Political Figures Without
A Bullet." The possibilities are
endless.
In short, if the ASSU Guest
Professorship Board and ASSU
Senate want "alternative" ideas,
why not do it right? Why not
welcome the Squeaker?
Otherwise, they might as well
invite scholarly educators of a
more diverse nature who have
something worthwhile to pre
sent the Stanford community.
And no one wants that.

USE repressed
Last night's forum in Cubber

ley Auditorium on Senate Bill
One (SBl) warned us of the
threat SBl poses to our civil
liberties. Just as important, the
forum pointed out that SBl,
through its anti-strike and
other provisions, would cripple
the effectiveness of the United
Stanford Employees.
USE has also been engaged
in a dispute with the University
administration over the firing
of the Union's Asst. President,
William Reynolds, and seven
other USE members. To protest
the firings, USE stationed
placard-carries and leafleters
near the entrance to Encina
Hall, measures the University
claimed were in viol ation of the
Union's 1973 contract.
This conflict represents more
than a misunderstanding over
the wording of a contract. It is
an attempt by the University to
lessen USE's influence at Stan
ford and to abridge the union's
right to protest an attack on it
self.
The University's actions and
the restrictions contained in
SBl are signs of repression, not
only against labor unions, but
against all of us. Stanford stu
dents and faculty members
should educate themselves
about this repression and resist
it.

Alienation's source
The cover story on alienation
in the Eel?. 12 Thursday cor
rectly pointed out that many
Stanford students become alien
ated and lonely, but the impres
sion that this university as an in
stitution is alone responsible for
students' alienation and loneli

ness is simplistic.
Stanford does not make us
students achievement oriented
and competitively minded: most
of us were that way long before
we arrived here. Those are the
attributes which got us into this
university, as well as bases of our
motivation for coming here.
Emphasis on achievement and
competitive pressure cause alie
nation and loneliness, as does
the transitory and too often
human-contact-poor nature of
our stay here. But if our per

sonalities have been institution
ally determined, institutions
which enveloped us much ear
lier in life than the University
did are responsible, though
Stanford certainly reinforces
achievement orientation.
In analyzing the causes of our
disaffection, a more penetrating
look at ourselves, rather than a
simple use of the University as a
scapegoat, would lead closer to
the truth.
