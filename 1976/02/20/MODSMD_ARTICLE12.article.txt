# Relieving alienation

In reading the cover story on
alienation in the Feb. 12 Thurs
day 1 was impressed that the
Daily drew attention to a prob
lem that exists somewhat subtly
here, but disappointed that the
emphasis given to alienation's
manifestations was not matched
by a discussion of possible solu
tions. 1
Living in an all-freshman
dorm perhaps gives me a clearer
view of the metamorphosis from
high school superstar to Stan
ford ;ermit." 1 think the pri
mary causeot self-isolation is the
method used by many students
to determine their progress here.
If there is to be competition,
competitors must evaluate and
then challenge their adversaries.
This year I have observed stu
dents dividing and sub-dividing
themselves into such creatures
as a "calculus self," and a "stud
self," or a "jock self."
Students then compare these
parts with corresponding parts
of their peers — ignoring the re
ality of the individual as a
whole. It is easy to find someone
here who can perform a specific
task better than one can, and
frustration will result if one con
tinually compares one's self
with unbeatable attributes of
others.
Breeding surrender
We students should concen
trate more on our own progress
as individuals — independent of
others.
It makes much more sense to
compare one's self with the way
one was yesterday or last week,
as the crucial elements of the
comparison remain the same.
We should set reachable goals
that allow for exposure to non
academic activities.
It is not surprising to find that
Stanford is predominately a sci
entific research institution. This
is not to overlook the excellent
humanities offerings here, but I
feel humanities are often
smothered by the scientific con
tingent.
The nature of scientific study
(especially at the undergraduate
level) vis a vis the humanities
allows for little personal in
volvement or interaction with
the subject. (There are few inter
pretative answers — most are
right or wrong.) How does the
Fundamental Theorum of Cal
culus relate to your life?
Shoveling crap
This comparatively imper
sonal involvement, especially if
coupled with the widespread
view of the undergraduate (e.g.
pre-med courses as "the crap
that has to be shoveled to reach
the med-school doors") has the
potential to decrease the impor
tance of other people for the
deeply-committed student.
Certainly a humanities or so
cial science major could regard
law school similarly, but I
should emphasize I am not argu
ing the virtues of the humanities
over science except in relation to
loneliness. If humanities offer a
greater opportunity for personal
involvement, then my sugges
tion is that science-oriented stu
dents be aware of the difference
and work to counter such effects
with other activities.
I also feel the alienation arti
cle contained one view which
needs to be put in perspective.
I'm sorry the article found few
good words for the dorms, but
personally my experience in
Branner Hall and experiences of
friends in other dorms have been
mostly rewarding.
Wide-ranging events have fil
led the school year so far, and
any student with the least moti
vation can find numerous on
campus social alternatives.

pre-med courses as "the crap
that has to be shoveled to reach
the med-school doors") has the
potential to decrease the impor
tance of other people for the
deeply-committed student.
Certainly a humanities or so
cial science major could regard
law school similarly, but I
should emphasize I am not argu
ing the virtues of the humanities
over science except in relation to
loneliness. If humanities offer a
greater opportunity for personal
involvement, then my sugges
tion is that science-oriented stu
dents be aware of the difference
and work to counter such effects
with other activities.
I also feel the alienation arti
cle contained one view which
needs to be put in perspective.
I'm sorry the article found few
good words for the dorms, but
personally my experience in
Branner Hall and experiences of
friends in other dorms have been
mostly rewarding.
Wide-ranging events have fil
led the school year so far, and
any student with the least moti
vation can find numerous on
campus social alternatives.

In reading the cover story on
alienation in the Feb. 12 Thurs
day 1 was impressed that the
Daily drew attention to a prob
lem that exists somewhat subtly
here, but disappointed that the
emphasis given to alienation's
manifestations was not matched
by a discussion of possible solu
tions. 1
Living in an all-freshman
dorm perhaps gives me a clearer
view of the metamorphosis from
high school superstar to Stan
ford ;ermit." 1 think the pri
mary causeot self-isolation is the
method used by many students
to determine their progress here.
If there is to be competition,
competitors must evaluate and
then challenge their adversaries.
This year I have observed stu
dents dividing and sub-dividing
themselves into such creatures
as a "calculus self," and a "stud
self," or a "jock self."
Students then compare these
parts with corresponding parts
of their peers — ignoring the re
ality of the individual as a
whole. It is easy to find someone
here who can perform a specific
task better than one can, and
frustration will result if one con
tinually compares one's self
with unbeatable attributes of
others.
Breeding surrender
We students should concen
trate more on our own progress
as individuals — independent of
others.
It makes much more sense to
compare one's self with the way
one was yesterday or last week,
as the crucial elements of the
comparison remain the same.
We should set reachable goals
that allow for exposure to non
academic activities.
It is not surprising to find that
Stanford is predominately a sci
entific research institution. This
is not to overlook the excellent
humanities offerings here, but I
feel humanities are often
smothered by the scientific con
tingent.
The nature of scientific study
(especially at the undergraduate
level) vis a vis the humanities
allows for little personal in
volvement or interaction with
the subject. (There are few inter
pretative answers — most are
right or wrong.) How does the
Fundamental Theorum of Cal
culus relate to your life?
Shoveling crap
This comparatively imper
sonal involvement, especially if
coupled with the widespread
view of the undergraduate (e.g.
pre-med courses as "the crap
that has to be shoveled to reach
the med-school doors") has the
potential to decrease the impor
