# Gallo disputes misportrayed

Penny Mann's column in the Feb. 13 Daily was
rife with misstatement and innuendo. Mann
claims Gallo is staging an expensive advertising
campaign about farmworker elections on the
Gallo ranch. What advertising is Mann talking
about? We have bought no space and have not
prepared any kind of advertising concerning the
recent farmworker elections. The writer is evi
dently setting up a straw man.
Mann claims Gallo had already contacted the
Teamsters "when the contract came up for re
newal in 1973." This, too, is false. Sworn tes
timony before an Agricultural Labor Relations
Board Hearing Officer disclosed that prior to the
United Farm Workers contract expiration, Gallo
repeatedly asked the LIFW to bargain on a new
contract, but to no avail. The IJFW would not
come to the bargaining table.
New contract talks did not begin until one week
after the Gallo/UFW contract expired. It wasn't
until more than two months thereafter, that the
Teamsters claimed representation of the Gallo
farmworkes. Gallo notified the UFW of this claim
and indicated it was going tocheck theTeamsters'
proof of representation. The UFW responded with
a picket line.
Please note Gallo had not signed a contract but
had merely said the Teamsters claimed represen

tation. It was not until July, 1973 that the
Teamsters' claim was verified and a contract
negotiated and signed. Gallo farmworkes partici
pated in the Teamster contract negotiations. The
new contract made Gallo farmworkers the highest
paid in the continental United States, with the
best package of fringe benefits for farmworkers
anywhere.
On Sept. 10, 1975, a secret ballot election was
held under rules and procedures established by
the Agricultural Labor Relations Act. The vote
was 223 Teamsters, 131 UFW, 0 votes for no union
and 196 challenged ballots. Hearings have been
concluded to adjudicate some of the challenged
ballots. The UFW has made some vague charges
about the election and its conduct. Gallo is await
ing an opportunity to disprove these charges and
is meanwhile trying to obtain specific informa
tion about them.
The new Farm Labor Law was supported by
Gallo, the Teamsters, the UFW, The California
Council of Catholic Bishops and the State AFL
CIO. Governor Jerry Brown has said he will not let
the new law die.
The democratic process is working. One either
believes in it or one doesn't.
