# Decision rests with Lyman
## COSS plan may ease gay hiring 
### Lori Matsukawa 
The Committee on Services to Students
(COSS) probably breathed a sigh of relief last
week when it placed before President Richard
Lyman its recommendation on Placement Ser
vices policy. They had been grappling with the
report for their past 13 meetings.
The issue was whether the Career Planning
and Placement Center (CPPC) was represent
ing gay community interests by allowing
employers who may discriminate against gays
to use its facility.
The recommendation proposed that the
University, though not compelled by law,
make a positive commitment "to avoid dis
crimination on the basis of sexual preference in
its own promotion and hiring policies and
(urges) employers using our facilities to follow
similar practices."
It also recommended that employers using
the CPPC by required to answer the question,
"In your hiring and promotion policies and
practices do you discriminate on the basis of
sexual orientation?"
The most important issue, however, was
whether or not those employers who do dis
criminate should be banned from using the
CPPC. COSS members were split evenly —
three to three —on the decision. The recom
mendation, therefore, included the arguments
for both sides of the question.
Is present policy cruel?
Those who voted for banning employers
who discriminate stated:
—the University, by not barring such
employers, is "acceding to a policy of cruel and
debilitating discrimination directed against
some of its more vulnerable students."
—that banning of discriminatory employers
does not deny students the opportunity seek
ing interviews with these employers, but will
instead encourage students to "think carefully
about the situation and then make individual
arrangements with such employers."
—that it recommended an "uneasy com
promise" where the military and other
employers whose ban from the CPPC could
result in great financial cost to the University,
be explicitly exempt from the ban.
The pro-ban group stated that it made this
suggestion in an "arena of realism."
"We may regret the fact of such (economic)
pressures, but we do not believe that univer
sities are free," it stated.
Protection of the weak
"The University has the responsibility to
uphold the rights of all its students, especially
when a particular group itself is weak. That
means making difficult decisions," said
Richard Thomas, community relations direc
tor for the Gay People's Union (GPU).
Thomas, in an Oct. 1975 letter to COSS, in
itiated the discussion of gay hiring policies of
those who use the CPPC. The GPU proposal
was to "encourage employers to examine their
employment policies and to correct present in
justices." GPU did not recommend that certain
employers be banned from using the center.
The move to ban employers from the CPPC
was initiated by COSS members themselves.
Many members of the GPU however, support

such a ban.
"The ban is a possible sanction against those
companies who do discriminate or refuse to
state whether or not they discriminate," said
Thomas.
Those who voted against banning employers
who discriminate stated:
—"The proposed exclusion of firms that dis
criminate on the basis of sexual preferences or
affection would retard the honest relay of in
formation."
—Every student should be allowed informa
tion concerning any job opportunities and that
banning certain employers would deny them
such access.
—Any reduction in the number of interview
ing firms most directly harms the minority

applicant.
By eliminating certain employers, the CPPC
would definitely limit the number of inter
views students could have.An argument that
students could, on their own, see those
employers who are disallowed from using the
CPPC goes against the CPPC purpose of mak
ing it easier for the student to seek employ
ment.
"The purpose of such policies is not to limit
employment opportunities, but to expand
them," said Thomas.
"The University community has an obliga
tion to insure that none of its members are
victims of arbitrary discrimination," he said.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons noted
that banning employers who discriminate
against gays from the CPPC would discrimi
nate against those students who were not gay.
Many opponents of the ban noted that the job
market is tight enough without further dis
couraging employers from recruiting students.
Lyons also mentioned that there would be no
way to require employers to state whether they
discriminate against gays according to the
COSS recommendation as there were no stated
sanctions for employers who do not state their
hiring policies.
Both Lyman and Lyons praised the commit
tee for taking a stand on the issue.
They said that though the recommendation
may not solve all gay hiring problems, COSS's
advocacy of gay rights should enable gays to
achieve greater social acceptance at Stanford.
"The compromise is a pragmatic though not
courageous decision," said Thomas.
It is clear that the University's action on this
recommendation will have a strong social im
pact and that it should be watched carefully by
each person who values his rights.
