# Transit plan stirs debate amid voter apathy
## 
### Marc Strassman 
Looking at the same situation from divergent
perspectives will often generate conflicting
views. The upcoming March 2 Santa Clara
County Transit District Referendum on a one
half percent sales tax to maintain and expand
county transit service is a case in point.
Larry Nicholas, supervising transportation
service representative for the Transit District,
which supports the referendum, Measure A,
contended it is necessary for the continued
viability of the county's system.
Joe Donohue, president of the United Tax
payers of Santa Clara County, a citizens' group,
and Palo Alto City Councilman John Berwald
both attacked the measure, however, because it
proposes to raise money for federal matching
funds through a sales tax, which they consider
to be a regressive form of taxation.
Nicholas disagreed.
The only real alternative to a sales tax,
Nicholas argued, is a property tax, which he
insisted is "the most regressive tax."
The sales tax, Nicholas pointed out, is not
applied — for anyone — to essential items such

as food and rent. The more people spend for
non-essential, taxable items, the more they
contribute in taxes, which seems somehow
equitable, he argued.
Individuals on fixed incomes, according to
Nicholas, will not have to pay more than $10 a
year more under the proposed tax.
Nicholas also contended that the measure's
opponents seem to be assuming that the state of
California and the federal government might
eliminate the requirement that localities raise
funds to be matched by federal monies.
"The honeymoon is over," said Nicholas,
referring to the fact that federal funds will soon
no longer be available except to localities that
can raise substantial initial funds on their own.
"The assumption that a magic change is
going to take place is not true," Nicholas said.
"The $10 million that we need won't appear
from nowhere. Without it, we can survive only
if the laws are changed, which isn't going to
happen, or by cancelling existing programs."
Naive plan?
Berwald also argued that Measure A in
cludes a "naive" and overly-ambitious plan for

establishing a light-rail system in the western
part of the Santa Clara Valley. Berwald said
that the county has greatly underestimated
the difficulty and expense that would be in
volved in constructing the light rail system,
particularly in terms of upgrading existing
tracks and the provision of adequate over- and
underpasses.
Nicholas responded by saying the district's
intention is "not to pave the county with a
light-rail system." He emphasized that what is
proposed is more of a demonstration and feasi
bility study than it is an elaborate and exten
sive light-rail network.
The county official also noted that although
the two Palo Alto councilmen opposed the
measure, all seven other measures.
Voter apathy strikes
Asked to access the measures chances in the
actual voting on March 2, Nicholas quoted
Howard Campen, the county executive, who
recently said in a radio interview that he
thought it "would pass by a narrow margin."
Criticism has also been directed against the

measure by writers in the Grapevine, a
counter-cultural newspaper published in Palo
Alto. The Grapevine said the proposed tax and
matching funds arrangements would merely
solidify existing federal priorities in transpor
tation, and would do nothing to resolve under
lying structural contradictions in existing pat
terns of housing, transportation and employ
ment.
TheGrapevine'sbasic criticism is that voting
a sales tax increase up or down means choos
ing what to do within a rather limited set of
possibilities, doing nothing to let people for
mulate and act on more far-reaching or radical
solutions to difficulties involved in transporta
tion.
Critics of this criticism hold that these are
the only set of possibilities available.
Although Berwald, Donohue, Nicholas, and
the Grapevine are very concerned about the
outcome of the election, most observers seem
to think that the election will generate very
little interest, and that it will probably be de
cided by the votes of very few people.

a sales tax increase up or down means choos

Critics of this criticism hold that these are

Although Berwald, Donohue, Nicholas, and

SCHOOL BUS—If a Santa Clara County sales tax referendum does not pass, bus service to the
Stanford campus might be endangered. Although the vote is expected to be close, so few voters
are expected to go to the polls that anything could happen.
Looking at the same situation from divergent
perspectives will often generate conflicting
views. The upcoming March 2 Santa Clara
County Transit District Referendum on a one
half percent sales tax to maintain and expand
county transit service is a case in point.
Larry Nicholas, supervising transportation
service representative for the Transit District,
which supports the referendum, Measure A,
contended it is necessary for the continued
viability of the county's system.
Joe Donohue, president of the United Tax
payers of Santa Clara County, a citizens' group,
and Palo Alto City Councilman John Berwald
both attacked the measure, however, because it
proposes to raise money for federal matching
funds through a sales tax, which they consider
to be a regressive form of taxation.
Nicholas disagreed.
The only real alternative to a sales tax,
Nicholas argued, is a property tax, which he
insisted is "the most regressive tax."
The sales tax, Nicholas pointed out, is not
applied — for anyone — to essential items such

as food and rent. The more people spend for
non-essential, taxable items, the more they
contribute in taxes, which seems somehow
equitable, he argued.
Individuals on fixed incomes, according to
Nicholas, will not have to pay more than $10 a
year more under the proposed tax.
Nicholas also contended that the measure's
opponents seem to be assuming that the state of
California and the federal government might
eliminate the requirement that localities raise
funds to be matched by federal monies.
"The honeymoon is over," said Nicholas,
referring to the fact that federal funds will soon
no longer be available except to localities that
can raise substantial initial funds on their own.
"The assumption that a magic change is
going to take place is not true," Nicholas said.
"The $10 million that we need won't appear
from nowhere. Without it, we can survive only
if the laws are changed, which isn't going to
happen, or by cancelling existing programs."
Naive plan?
Berwald also argued that Measure A in
cludes a "naive" and overly-ambitious plan for

establishing a light-rail system in the western
part of the Santa Clara Valley. Berwald said
that the county has greatly underestimated
the difficulty and expense that would be in
volved in constructing the light rail system,
particularly in terms of upgrading existing
tracks and the provision of adequate over- and
underpasses.
Nicholas responded by saying the district's
intention is "not to pave the county with a
light-rail system." He emphasized that what is
proposed is more of a demonstration and feasi
bility study than it is an elaborate and exten
sive light-rail network.
The county official also noted that although
the two Palo Alto councilmen opposed the
measure, all seven other measures.
Voter apathy strikes
Asked to access the measures chances in the
actual voting on March 2, Nicholas quoted
Howard Campen, the county executive, who
recently said in a radio interview that he
thought it "would pass by a narrow margin."
Criticism has also been directed against the

measure by writers in the Grapevine, a
counter-cultural newspaper published in Palo
Alto. The Grapevine said the proposed tax and
matching funds arrangements would merely
solidify existing federal priorities in transpor
tation, and would do nothing to resolve under
lying structural contradictions in existing pat
