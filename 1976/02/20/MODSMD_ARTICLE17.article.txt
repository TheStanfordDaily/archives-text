Look How The Fish l.ive is
J.F. Powers' third collection of
short stories. These three books
alone have established Powers
as one of the consistently most
distinguished short story writers
living in America.
The present volume in many
ways is the weakest of tin.' three,
but even by itself it not only
needs no apology, but deserves
considerable praise. It is cer
tainly one of the most engrossing
and readable volumes of fiction
published in the last year.

If Powers is one of Ameri
ca's most neglected major
writers, it is not entirely the
public's fault. In nearly 30
years Powers has published
only four moderately sized
volumes. Each book has been
greeted with considerable
praise from critics as dis
similar as Evelyn Waugh
and Saul Bellow and each
time the public has had to
wait nearly 10 years for
another book.

Powers' only novel, Morte
O'lJrban. won the National Book
Award in 1963, but even that
considerable encouragement
only served to make him more
reticent.
Look How The Fish Live is
Powers' first collection of short
stories in nearly 20 years. Al
most all of the stories take place
in the fictitious diocese of Oster
gothenburg (Minnesota), and
most of the major characters are
priests.
From this description a poten
tial reader might well cringe in
fright of an unspeakably tedious
book, but I am confident that

anyone who reads a single story
will lose all reservations about
the subject matter.
When Powers writes about the
Midwestern Catholic clergy he is
being a regional writer only in
the best sense of the word, lie is
no more confined in his re
gionalism than was Faulkner.
Powers is able to put the full
range of his artistry to work
within his chosen subject mat
ter.
Many Catholic intellectuals
have a repressed fixation on the
priesthood. Throughout their
lives, consciously or not, they
compare the high ideals of a
priestly vocation with the con
fused goals of contemporary
secular life.
Throughout their early educa
tion the dignity of a spiritual vo
cation was so thoroughly impre
ssed on their imagination that
even renegade Catholics are
often guilty of fantasizing about
chucking their squalid lives
away and going off to a semi
nary.

Powers' fascination on the
priesthood may owe some
thing to this common day
dream, but in his short
stories at least he transcends
it. The priests in Powers'
stories are not the dedicated
saints of devotional litera
ture. Nor are they the lecher
ous hypocrites of anti-
Catholic satire. They are
complicated human beings
who have dedicated them
selves to an idealistic, life
long mission which they
must carry out within the
demanding and unyielding
structure of the Roman
Catholic church. Sometimes
they fail. More often they

succeed in totally unex
pected ways.

In Powers' stories the Catholic
Church is like a slightly more
amiable version of Kafka's court.
Decisions are made on ambiva
lent standards by distant offi
cials and usually the accused is
not even notified of the verdict.
This mystery. Powers implies,
does not invalidate either the
Church or its processes. The
priests do not question the
Church any more than Kafka's K.
questions the Court whose au
thority he considers inviolable.
While Powers does not criticize
the Church in any fundamental
way, neither does he glorify it.
His stories depict the despair
and loneliness of its servants lost
in an organization which coldly
dismisses their suffering.
In "Priestly Fellowship," for
instance, a middle-aged pastor
tries to learn why his life is so
lonely. His youthful desire to be
a saint has vanished and nothing
equally strong has replaced it.
His faith is absolutely unsha
ken, but he regrets that he feels
no warmth or love for his fellow
priests within the Church equal
to the emotions that he imagines
a family would have given him.
His failure to strike up a real
friendship with the young priest
who has just been assigned to his
parish makes him realize how
unsatisfactory the personal side
of his life has been.

I suspect that this story
and another with the same
characters, "Bill," are chap
ters of an abandoned novel.
The characters are so con
vincingly and completely
realized that it is a pity Pow
ers did not fill out the re
mainder of the story. The
stories are complete in them
selves, but the situation and

characters are worthy of
greater treatment.

In "Farewell," Powers tells
how a bishop investigating a
would-be miracle after his re
tirement unwittingly stumbles
into a new lifestyle which fills
his life in a way his previous
career had not. This wonderful
story would be worth reading
even if it had been done less
skillfully because of its subplot
in which a housewife claims the
Virgin Mary appeared to her
with the message "Keep Min
nesota Green!"
Powers' greatest achievement
is his sympathetic understand
ing of human beings. Unlike

many modern Catholic writers
such as Flannery O'Conner or
Evelyn does not
dislike his characters. The
generosity and wisdom of his
imagination is a welcome relief
to the conventional superficial
ity of so much contemporary fic
tion.
I would surely never nominate
Powers for the position of
America's greatest living writer
of short stories, hut I would be
equally eager to place him over
many recent nominees.
A reader, who has turned
away bewildered by the recent
acclaim of John Fowles and
Grace Paley as masters of the
short story, should turn to Pow
ers for an illuminating relief.

BELLOW FELLOW — The public hasn't read much of Powers'
work lately, as the author has only published four moderately
sized volumes; this collection of short stories is his first in nearly
20 years. But as an attest to his talent, fellow author Saul Bellow
considers Powers as one of America's best writers.
