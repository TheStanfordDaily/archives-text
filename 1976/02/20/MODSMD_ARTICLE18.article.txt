James Dean: The Mutant King, by David Dalton. Dell, $1.75
Reviewed by Howard Baldwin
Who besides James Dean made but three films and became a
legend in his own time? No one. Dean occupies a unique place in
the history of American films. 1 le appeared at the right time in the
right films.
Appropriately, David Dalton has written an equally unique biog
raphy, distinguished by its extensive data and philosophical at
titudes. It is a very special book about a very special person.
Everyone's heard of James Dean, but few really know who he
was or what he did that made him so special. He was a consummate
actor, almost manically dedicated to characterization and perfec
tion.
Had he not crashed his Porsche on Sept. 30.1955, he would have
surpassed the stardom of every actor in the world.
But did he have to die? Was he doomed? In The Mutant King.
Dalton treats Dean as a man with an appointment with destiny. His
comprehensive and literate biography analyzes Dean's life as a
logical and inescapable progression toward his death. Even Dean
once said that he would die young.
Dalton has written from the perspective of predestination, where
everything in Dean's life somehow related to the way he died.
His love of speed, his self-consuming talent, his lonely life end
ing on a lonely road and other little ironies all point the way on
which Dalton leads the reader.
The Mutant King is amazingly literate for a biography. One
must be extremely well-read to recognize many of Dalton's refer
ences to literature. The book's bibliography lists magazines and
newspapers from Reader's Digest and Photoplay to the New York
Times and the Marion Chronicle
Dalton left no stone unturned or lead ignored in his search for
clues to Dean's elusive identity. To his credit, he has not glossed
over any part of Dean's life. He quotes Dean's friends and lovers as
well as his enemies, ignoring no one, presenting impressions of
Dean from all sides for a truly composite personality sketch.
He concentrates extensively and clearly on each facet of Dean's
life — his early days in Illinois and how it affected his later life and
film portrayals; his life as a struggling actor in New York and on
Broadway; finally, his days of fame and insecurity in Hollywood.
At times Dalton tends toward the ludicrous in his suppositions
about Dean's life, discussing with great glee anagrams that only
have meaning to Dalton. He treats everything as if he had disco
vered the secret of God's great books.
However, this is what makes The Mutant King bold and original.
As an example, the man who smashed into Dean's speeding car,
Donald Turnupseed, said he simply did not see the Porsche on the
road. Dalton interprets this fact with an unusual metaphysical
explanation:
"Among mystics and primitives, speed, 'fast traveling,' and
'magic flight' also bestow the power to become invisible and trans
cend the earthly dimensions. In his love of speed, Jimmy had
simply become invisible, and Donald Turnupseed was the first
person not to see him."
Rarely does one find a book so carefully constructed, full of
pertinent interviews shedding light on Dean's effect on his friends.
Dalton chronicles Dean's effect on the world in his last chapter,
telling of the strange cults and popularity that sprung up after his
death and continue to exist even 20 years after his death.

Rarely does one find a book so carefully constructed, full of
pertinent interviews shedding light on Dean's effect on his friends.
Dalton chronicles Dean's effect on the world in his last chapter,
telling of the strange cults and popularity that sprung up after his
death and continue to exist even 20 years after his death.
James Dean: The Mutant King, by David Dalton. Dell, $1.75
Reviewed by Howard Baldwin
Who besides James Dean made but three films and became a
legend in his own time? No one. Dean occupies a unique place in
the history of American films. 1 le appeared at the right time in the
right films.
Appropriately, David Dalton has written an equally unique biog
raphy, distinguished by its extensive data and philosophical at
titudes. It is a very special book about a very special person.
Everyone's heard of James Dean, but few really know who he
was or what he did that made him so special. He was a consummate
actor, almost manically dedicated to characterization and perfec
tion.
Had he not crashed his Porsche on Sept. 30.1955, he would have
surpassed the stardom of every actor in the world.
But did he have to die? Was he doomed? In The Mutant King.
Dalton treats Dean as a man with an appointment with destiny. His
comprehensive and literate biography analyzes Dean's life as a
logical and inescapable progression toward his death. Even Dean
once said that he would die young.
Dalton has written from the perspective of predestination, where
everything in Dean's life somehow related to the way he died.
His love of speed, his self-consuming talent, his lonely life end
ing on a lonely road and other little ironies all point the way on
which Dalton leads the reader.
The Mutant King is amazingly literate for a biography. One
must be extremely well-read to recognize many of Dalton's refer
ences to literature. The book's bibliography lists magazines and
newspapers from Reader's Digest and Photoplay to the New York
Times and the Marion Chronicle
Dalton left no stone unturned or lead ignored in his search for
clues to Dean's elusive identity. To his credit, he has not glossed
over any part of Dean's life. He quotes Dean's friends and lovers as
well as his enemies, ignoring no one, presenting impressions of
Dean from all sides for a truly composite personality sketch.
He concentrates extensively and clearly on each facet of Dean's
life — his early days in Illinois and how it affected his later life and
film portrayals; his life as a struggling actor in New York and on
Broadway; finally, his days of fame and insecurity in Hollywood.
At times Dalton tends toward the ludicrous in his suppositions
about Dean's life, discussing with great glee anagrams that only
have meaning to Dalton. He treats everything as if he had disco
vered the secret of God's great books.
However, this is what makes The Mutant King bold and original.
As an example, the man who smashed into Dean's speeding car,
Donald Turnupseed, said he simply did not see the Porsche on the
road. Dalton interprets this fact with an unusual metaphysical
explanation:
"Among mystics and primitives, speed, 'fast traveling,' and
'magic flight' also bestow the power to become invisible and trans
cend the earthly dimensions. In his love of speed, Jimmy had
simply become invisible, and Donald Turnupseed was the first
person not to see him."
