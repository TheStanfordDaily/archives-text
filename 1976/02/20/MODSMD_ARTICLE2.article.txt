# KZSU power hike closer to approval

### Ann Amioka 
KZSU has come one step closer to
receiving the power increase it has
been seeking for the past four years.
The station received word Wednes
day that the engineering staff of the
Federal Communication Commission
(FCC) has approved KZSU's analysis
of interference with other Bay Area FM
stations and found no unresolved con
flicts, according to Station Manager
Bill Ledeen.
However, Ledeen emphasized "very
strongly" that the FCC engineering
approval is only "another hurdle in the
long set of hurdles" in KZSU's attempt
to secure a power increase.
After a copy of the request appears in
the March edition of theFederu/ Regis
ter, there will be at least a 30-day
holdover period when public com
ments on the power boost will be sol
icited, Ledeen said.
Increased wattage
The application must then be passed
by a FCC financial analysis committee,
which will determine if KZSU has the
resources to conform to FCC regula
tions while operating with the in
creased wattage.
"We should pass the financial re
view rather rapidly," Ledeen said. He
explained that KZSU has funds set
aside from a 1972 fee assessment for
the purpose of financing the changes
required for an output power increase.
Once past the financial review, the
station's request would ct>me up for
final review by the FCC â€” possibly by
June, Ledeen predicted.
If the request is approved. KZSU
would be permitted to increase its out
put power from 10 to 500 watts.
'Professionally done'
Ledeen said much of the credit for
the FCC engineers' approval belongs
to the engineering firm KZSU hired
to write up the interference analysis.
He said the firm provided "us with a
professionally done piece of work."
He commented that KZSU's first
three requests for a power increase
were handled entirely by KZSU per
sonnel.
Use of the engineering firm proved
advantageous in another respect.
Foothill Junior College's station KFJC,
whose frequency is very close to
KZSU's, had made sporadic attempts
to block KZSU's previous tries for a
power boost, saying such an increase
would interfere with their signal here.
Bay Area FM stations
However, KFJC has applied for its
own power boost and has hired the
same engineering firm to write up its
analysis of interference with Bay Area

FM stations, leading to "excellent
coordination there (between the two
stations), finally," Ledeen said.
If both stations receive power
boosts, broadcast interference between
the two should clear up, and students
shou Id be able to get both, Ledeen said.
If only KZSU is granted a power in
crease, it would overpower KFJC's
signal at Stanford but would not cut
into very much of KFJC's audience
elsewhere, he said. KFJC's transmitter
on Black Mountain, the highest point
in the Mid-peninsula, provides KFJC
with "a much larger area coverage"
than KZSU, Ledeen explained.
