# Bug Me

Ifearyou have bhindered in identifying the "Masterpiece Theatre"
theme as Clarke's "Trumpet Voluntary." A stirring piece, but
wrong. The theme in question is actually the Rondeau from "Sin
fonies de Fanfares" by Jean-Joseph Mouret. Also, my roommate,
who saw the Olympics, claims that this is different from the Olym
pic theme (which also is not Clarke's "Trumpet Voluntary."l You
might look into that.-B.V.
The impossible has finally happened. "Hug Me" has indeed
blundered. Not only did we identify the song incorrectly, but we
also managed to misspell much-maligned composer Jeremiah
Clarke's name.
Following your suggestion, we have been looking into the mat
ter. Our erroneous staff members have been firmly disciplined.
And over at the Music Department, an embarrassed secretary ad
mitted, "Nooneup here is willing toaccept credit for saying what it
was."
On the other hand, the information in the letter was right. The
song was not the Olympics theme song but background music
which floated in when Lucky Pierre Salinger had no more thrilling
price comparisons or the ABC staff balked at showing the 15th
flashback of Dorothy Hamill's pre-Olympics school figures.
Many thanks to the six readers who wrote to us and the several
hundred more who phoned in. We feel properly chastised and
promise to be more careful in the future.

Believe it or not, the irregularity > ou/ column is upsetting my
equilibrium. Living in a house without breakfast service, I never
rise before 11, except on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Then I trek
down to Encina Commons where I can enjoy coffee, doughnuts and
my favorite Daily column, "Bug Me." However, lately my schedule
has been upset. Your column appears on Tuesdays but the rest of
the week seems tentative. Please re-insert constancy in my life and
tell me, WHEN THE HELL DOES "BUG ME" RUN7-A.S.
Sometimes we've wondered that ourselves. But from now on
"Bug Me" will run on Wednesdays and Fridays. You can set your
calendars bv it.
