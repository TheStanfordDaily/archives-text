## Blacks plan '76 protest

During the bicentennial, blacks should "con
centrate on where their loyalties lie," said Brother
Adewole, chairman of the Afro-American Anti
bicentennial Committee, in a speech Tuesday
night.
Speaking to about 25 people in the Olivio-
Magnolia lounge, Adewole asked, "Will we begin
to transfer our loyalties to the masses of the black
people?"
Adewole claimed that black history as it is usu
ally represented consists of a "string of excep
tions" and asked, "What of the masses of our
people?"
Aspects ignored
He further contended that many of the most
famous aspects of black history are ignored or
incompletely represented. For example:
—More than 150 million Africans died in slave
ships in passage between Africa and America;
—During the Revolutionary War, more black
men fought with the British than with the Ameri
cans. They began to fight for their former masters
only after George Washington promised them
their freedom, a promise that was broken after the
war;
—George Washington Carver, the famous black
botanist, was castrated in his youth and lived out
his life as a eunuch;
—Charles Drew, the black researcher who dis
covered the existence and uses of blood plasma,
bled to death from wounds received in a car crash
because the nearest hospital was segregated and
refused to treat him.
Adewole also drew historical parallels between

atrocities committed on blacks in the past and in
recent times.
He said that Thomas Jefferson performed au
topsies on his slaves "to prove that they were
inferior." Adewole compared this to the medical
experiments carried out on black prisoners, the
most infamous of which were the Tuskogee, Ala.
syphilis injections.
He added that in 1776 there was widespread
rioting in Boston against the establishment of or
phanages for black children. Adewole compared
this to the present-day conflict over integration
there.
All in all, the oppression of black people has
been "just as much a part of American life as
George Washington," Adewole said.
'Propaganda coup'
"If we sit back and let this go by, white America
will have scored a propaganda coup," he de
clared. "What we feel is important is that the
bicentennial not be used for international prop
aganda by the U.S. government."
Adewole stated that the "fundamental myth of
black history" is that blacks are part of the "melt
ing pot." He declared, "There is no parallel bet
ween white immigrants and black slaves."
He called for a plebiscite of black citizens to
determine whether they will remain American
citizens. "Whether we want to separate, whether
we want to emigrate, whether we want to mix, that
is our right to choose," he said.
The Anti-bicentennial Committee is a Los
Angeles-based organization that uses literature
and speakers to persuade blacks to boycott the
bicentennial.
