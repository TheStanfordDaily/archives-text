# Associations flock to Washington
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — By what
ever name they are known — in
stitutes, associations, societies,
unions, federations — they are
concentrations of influence, and
each year more of them move to
the Washington,D.C. area.
The incentive is the same as
that which made many of them
settle at first in New York and
Chicago and other American
cities — their belief that from
these addresses they could best
listen to and make an impact on
public opinion.
Now they are saying in effect
that the way to influence public
opinion is not to shotgun their
message throughout America
but to concentrate their fire on
the specific target of legislation
and regulation.
Federal government courted
"There is a fundamental feel
ing among association people
that most of their concerns are
identified with the presence of
the federal government, and that
this is where the action is," said
Clarence Arata.
Arata, executive vice presi
dent of the Metropolitan
Washington Board of Trade,
maintains Washington has sur
passed both Chicago and New
York in the number of national
association headquarters.
"We've grown very fast in the

past two, three years." he said.
"We have 26 percent, while New
York now has only 24 percent
and Chicago 16 percent."
Fourth branch
So numerous have they be
come in Washington, that often
the associations are referred to as
the fourth branch of govern
ment. exerting influence on the
lives of Americans exceeded
only by the executive, judicial
and legislative branches.
New York, which is attempt
ing to keep its industry and in
fluence, isn't giving up the title
without an argument, and it has
some support. A new edition of
the Encyclopedia of Associa

tions still has it in first place.
Margaret Fisk, the editor,
counted 1740 national associa
tions here compared with 1622
in Washington, D.C. and 681 in
Chicago, but these numbers are
accompanied by some asterisks.
Central city
First of all, they are for the
central city rather than the met
ropolitan area, and Washington
has spilled over geographically
as well as, it is alleged, in a few
other ways. Arata's claim is
based on metropolitan area fi
gures.
Without attempting to settle
the argument for all time, Fisk
notes that New York too has a

large metropolitan area, and that
many associatons moving from
the central city are reestablish
ing themselves elsewhere in the
larger unit.
Another footnote that cannot
be ignored relates to the relative
importance of the associations,
and that's where Chicago excels,
being home to the bar, medical,
hospital, dental, realtor and lib
rary associations.
While Chicago, says Fisk,
"is holding its own," and New
York remains an important fac
tor, there is no doubt that
Washington and its environs are
where the action is.
