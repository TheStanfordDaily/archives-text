# How to raise smart children
## Researchers study kids 
### 
BOSTON (AP) â€” The brightest, happiest, most
charming children spend their earliest years in
remarkably similar ways, researchers say. They
listen to adult conversations, roam freely around
their homes and spend a lot of time staring.
The study, they say, provides a blueprint for
raising terrific kids.
Prof. Burton L. White of Harvard University
outlined the research for reporters Wednesday, a
day in advance of its formal presentation at the
annual meeting of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science.

White, who heads Harvard's Pre-School Pro
ject, said he reached his conclusions by watching
parents who consistently have bright, socially at
tractive children.
These children score highly on social and intel
ligence tests, he said.
About one family in 30 produces these kinds of
children, he said, and the abiliy does not seem to
be affected by income or education.
"The single most important factor in this is the
mother." White said. "She has a greater influence
over a child's experiences than anyone else."
