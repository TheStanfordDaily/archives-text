# 'On a commission for Christ'
## Colson converts convicts 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Charles
VV. "Chuck" Colson, once
known as the White House
"hatchet man" during the
Watergate period, is now work
ing at developing a nationwide
network of evangelist convicts
"on a commission for Jesus
Christ" behind prison walls.
"1 know Cod can change
men's lives in prison," he says.
"I've seen it and experienced it.
Where men and prison programs
have failed. Cod's ways don't
fail. We just want to give God a
chance to work inside prisons."
With a "green light" for the
program from the Federal
Bureau of Prisons, Colson and
colleagues in Fellowship House
in Washington.D.C. already have

given a two-week training
course for the first group of 12
prisoners, released temporarily
from six U.S. prisons for that
purpose.
Colson says that "when other
inmates see these men or women
come back to prison filled with
the Spirit, they say, "1 don't
know what it is, but I'm curi
ous."
'Miracles happen'
From then on, Colson adds,
"miracles happen" in changing
prisoners' outlooks and lives.
After training another group
in February, the plan calls for re
peating the process for new
groups every other month until a
corps of prisoners at the 40-odd
federal prisons have been in

volved, and then setting up
programs around the country to
do the same inside state prisons.
Colson who served seven
months in prison himself, dis
cusses his new work in inter
views in the National Courier, a
Christian-oriented news
biweekly published in Plain
field, N.J. and in the Moody
Monthly, an evangelical
magazine published in Chicago.
'Moral failure'
Telling of his own "moral fai
lure" while a White House ad
viser, he says that "I did what
ever the president of the United
States ordered .. . He's the
commander-in-chief. I followed
orders."
He said the Nixon team was a
"bunch of guys desperately try
ing to hold things together," but
lost sight of the fact that a gov
ernment doesn't exist for its own
sake.
Colson,who pleaded guilty to
spreading derogatory informa
tion about Daniel Ellsberg. says
that before his conversion, he
based his moral decision on
"what you could get away with, I
guess, on what you thought you
had to do to get a job done."
"I'd been an Episcopalian," he
says."I went to Sunday School
and learned about Jesus Christ as
an historical figure, a prophet, a
cut above his time ... My
biggest problem had always
been intellectual reservations.
Personal relations
"I knew there was a Cod, but I
could never see how man could
have personal relations with
Him," he adds.
When he left the White House
staff to resume his $100,0()0-a
-year law practice, before the
Watergate scandal broke, he said
he felt a "strange deadness ... I
had gotten to the top of the
mountain and I couldn't think of
any other mountains."
He said his conversion came
after a friend, businessman Tom
Philips, told of "committing his
life to Jesus Christ."

'Moral failure'
Telling of his own "moral fai
lure" while a White House ad
viser, he says that "I did what
ever the president of the United
States ordered .. . He's the
commander-in-chief. I followed
orders."
He said the Nixon team was a
"bunch of guys desperately try
ing to hold things together," but
lost sight of the fact that a gov
ernment doesn't exist for its own
sake.
Colson,who pleaded guilty to
spreading derogatory informa
tion about Daniel Ellsberg. says
that before his conversion, he
based his moral decision on
"what you could get away with, I
guess, on what you thought you
had to do to get a job done."
"I'd been an Episcopalian," he
says."I went to Sunday School
and learned about Jesus Christ as
an historical figure, a prophet, a
cut above his time ... My
biggest problem had always
been intellectual reservations.
Personal relations
"I knew there was a Cod, but I
could never see how man could
have personal relations with
Him," he adds.
When he left the White House
staff to resume his $100,0()0-a
-year law practice, before the
Watergate scandal broke, he said
he felt a "strange deadness ... I
had gotten to the top of the
mountain and I couldn't think of
any other mountains."
He said his conversion came
after a friend, businessman Tom
Philips, told of "committing his
life to Jesus Christ."
NEW YORK (AP) — Charles
VV. "Chuck" Colson, once
known as the White House
"hatchet man" during the
Watergate period, is now work
ing at developing a nationwide
network of evangelist convicts
"on a commission for Jesus
Christ" behind prison walls.
"1 know Cod can change
men's lives in prison," he says.
"I've seen it and experienced it.
Where men and prison programs
have failed. Cod's ways don't
fail. We just want to give God a
chance to work inside prisons."
With a "green light" for the
program from the Federal
Bureau of Prisons, Colson and
colleagues in Fellowship House
in Washington.D.C. already have

given a two-week training
course for the first group of 12
prisoners, released temporarily
from six U.S. prisons for that
purpose.
Colson says that "when other
inmates see these men or women
come back to prison filled with
the Spirit, they say, "1 don't
know what it is, but I'm curi
ous."
'Miracles happen'
From then on, Colson adds,
"miracles happen" in changing
prisoners' outlooks and lives.
After training another group
in February, the plan calls for re
peating the process for new
groups every other month until a
corps of prisoners at the 40-odd
federal prisons have been in

volved, and then setting up
programs around the country to
do the same inside state prisons.
Colson who served seven
months in prison himself, dis
cusses his new work in inter
views in the National Courier, a
Christian-oriented news
biweekly published in Plain
field, N.J. and in the Moody
Monthly, an evangelical
magazine published in Chicago.
