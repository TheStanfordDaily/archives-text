SACRAMENTO (AP) — The state attorney general's office is too
slow in preparing charges against incompetent or grossly negligent
doctors, an audit report for the legislature charged Wednesday.
The auditor general's report also urged a change in state law to
allow disciplining of doctors for any act of negligence, rather than
just the "gross" negligence now required.
The delays and legal obstructions are allowing negligent or in
competent doctors to continue practicing without restriction, the
report said.
The chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee, Assemb
lyman Mike Cullen (D-Long Beach), called it a "damning report on
state regulation of physicians."
Cullen called it "an indictment of elected and appointed officials
alike." He included the legislature in his criticism.
"It is shocking that ordinary physician negligence resulting in
severe injury or death to the patient is not subject to regulation or
discipline by the State of California," Cullen said.
The report to Cullen's committee said that as long as doctors
can't be disciplined for negligence unless it's "gross," the public
will never know how much lesser negligence there is or how many
doctors are guilty of it.
The report said that in the first three months of 1975 there were
435 investigations of gross negligence or incompetence, yet only
three doctors were disciplined for it in the whole year.
The auditor said that the only public member of the new Board of
Medical Quality Assurance said that new laws prompted by the
malpractice insurance crisis didn't broaden the grounds for discip
line and won't weed out any more bad doctors.
At one point, the auditor general said delays in preparing
charges against doctors were due to inadequate funding and legal
obstructions in getting evidence.
