# Chilean junta faces mounting criticism

SANTIAGO. Chile (PNS) —
The Chilean junta may be head
ingjor a showdown as criticism
of its policies mounts at home as
well as abroad.
Rumors of rifts between the
generals over the role of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, head of the
military government, have
gained ground since the gov
ernment's decision to allow pub
lication of an essay by former
Chilean President Eduardo Frei
criticizing junta policies.
Frei's 18.000-word essay, cir
culated clandestinely for a
month, was recently printed in
full in the government news
paper El Cronista.
Accusing the junta of seeking
"to establish a type of
nationalism with many totalita
rian characteristics," Frei de
cried violations of human rights
and called for reestablishing
democracy.
'Backward'
And Frei maintained that
economically "while others ad
vance, we are going backward."
Earlier this month the chiefs of
the Navy, Air Force and Police —
Pinochet's junta partners — ap
peared on prime time TV to af
firm their support for his
policies. According to a widely
circulated rumor, their perfor
mance was in response to a
threat by Pinochet to resign un
less they made a public state
ment of support.

In JaAuary the London Sunday
Times reported that 10 generals,
including the Air Force chief,
had signed an ultimatum de
manding that Pinochet make
changes or step down.
Although diplomatic sources
here could not verify the exis
tence of such a document, one
said, "It no longer matters
whether the document exists or
not, since everyone is convinced
that something of that sort is
going on."
But in an open split, third
ranking Gen. Sergio Arellano
Stark, former aide to Frei, was
forced to resign from the army in
January over "policy disagree
ments."
Economics
Hut the chief cause of discon
tent in the military is the coun
try's deteriorating economic
situation. The government's au
sterity program adopted ten
months ago to beat inflation has
brought an official unemploy
ment rate of 16 percent and 12
percent drop in GNP. Inflation
still runs at 8 percent a month. A
17.3 percent currency devalua
tion in January further reduced
consumer buying power.
The government's rigid
adherence to free-market princi
ples precludes intervening in
the economy with price controls,
unemployment insurance or
welfare programs to ease the
hardship imposed by recession.
