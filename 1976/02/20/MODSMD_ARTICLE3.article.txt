# For frats, Row
## Clearinghouse to open 
### Stephen Crolius 
A new, trouble-shooting office, as
yet unnamed, will start operation by
the beginning of next month as a cent
ral clearinghouse for fraternity and
Row house problems, according to
alumnus and law student Patrick
Kline.
Kline is the only person who will
staff the office.
Kline said he hopes the office, lo
cated in Grove House at 5H5 Mayfield
Ave., will become a place where resi
dents of "Row houses and fraternities
can come to vent any grievances, exp
lain any problems or make any re
quests."
The concept of such an office is a
new one, Kline said Wednesday. In the
past, the Dean of Student Affairs' Of
fice and the Student Housing Office
have each handled a share of the prob
lems associated with the fraternity and
Row houses.
"Because there are two offices doing
similar things, there was a lot of confu
sion," Kline explained.
One person
"Now there will be one person
watching the problems that develop in
each of these houses . . . so that he'll
understand them a little better and be
able to explain them . . . when deci
sions are being made," he said.
The exact duties of the office Kline
called "pretty flexible and pretty
vague.
"I don't have any authority," he
said," but at least they (the people with
grievances from the fraternity and Row

houses) can go to one office with any
kind of request."
Kline said he has been interviewing
fraternity house managers during the
last two weeks to find out what prob
lems they have and will start inter
viewing the Row house managers
soon.
Kline declined to speculate which
group has more problems, the 13
fraternity houses or the 15Rowhouses,
but said, "the Row houses . . . don't
have ihe same*internal problems" as
the fraternity houses.
Rental agreements
The lack of rental agreements bet
ween the fraternity houses and the
Llniversity will be one of the first prob
lems tackled by his office, Kline said.
He explained the problem as being de
rived from"the fact that at least the
fraternities have the perception that
they don't know what their respon
sibilities to the University are and they
don't know what the University's re
sponsibilities to them are."
He said he didn't anticipate an easy
time working this problem out, but
added, "It makes a whole hell of a lot of
sense to me to draw up some docu
ments that clearly define them (the
respective responsibilities)."
Kline also said he considered the
quota system for the fraternities "a
very sound resolution," but added, "as
a lawyer I can imagine the complica
tions of the details (of putting the
quota system into effect). I haven't
looked into it enough to know whether
we really have a substantial problem or

not."
One of the long-range concerns of
the office, according to Kline, will be
the overall health of the fraternities.
"There has been a decline of (frater
nity popularity)," he said. "The ques
tion is now: Is their popularity going
up? We are right at the changing point.
"But 1 think there will probably al
ways be fraternities on campus. How
many is another question," he said.
