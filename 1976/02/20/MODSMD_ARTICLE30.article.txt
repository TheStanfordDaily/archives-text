## Big Splash rated even 
### Chris Kamel 
"This meet should be one of
the most even meets in years,"
said coach Jim Gaughran on to
morrow afternoon's Big Splash
— the Stanford-Cal swimming
meet — at 1 in deGuerre Pool.
That may be the understate
ment of the season.
How even do they seem? Both
the Robber Baron and Bear men's
swimming squads post 7-2 sea
son records. Stanford's two los
ses came last weekend down in
Los Angeles as the Barons lost to
defending NGAA champion
USC, 85-28, and UCLA, 79-33.
Cal's two defeats came to these
two same teams. Similarly, the
Barons' and Bears' seven vic
tories include wins over Texas
and Simon Fraser.
Won 35 straight
The only category Stanford
has a definite edge in is the series
record. The Robbers defeated the
Bears the last ;J5 years. Gal's last
victory was a 51-24 triumph
back in 1941.
According toGaughran, how
ever, the Bear men's team is the
best ever in its history.
"They have recruited a lot of
fine freshmen who have really
improved over last year," he
said.
Pan-Am medalist
One Bear rookie who may give
the Stanford backstrokers some
problems is Pan-American gold
medalist, Peter Rocca. Accord
ing to Gaughran, Rocca along
with Gal's two filuropean
backstrokers, ought to prove too
tough for the Cards.
The meet may hinge on each
event. Cal's Jeff Roy will chal
lenge Stanford's Dave Fairbank
in the 50-yard and 100-yard
freestyle.
The Barons' Bill Ghao will try
to neutralize Gal freshman Pete
Tragitt in the long distance free
style events. Even the diving
events promise to be close.
Stanford's Wayne Wagner will
have trouble with the Bears' Joe
Styger even though Wagner has
beaten him before.
"We have an edge in the relays
but the diving events will proba
bly offset it," said Gaughran. "In
essence, the meet ought to be one
of individual matchups. To con
tinue our string against Gal, we
have to perform well in each
event."
