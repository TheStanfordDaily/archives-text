# Huskies drop Cards
## 
### Mike Tollin 
SEATTLE — It was the Clar
ence Ramsey show, as the
6-foot-4 senior Huskie guard
scored a career-high 36 points, to
lead ninth-ranked Washington
(7-3 in the Pacific Eight) to an
80-59 win over Stanford (1-9).
Ramsey's 36-point effort was
the eighth best single-game scor
ing performance by a
Washington player. The senior
guard, who averages 15.5 points
per game, hit on 16 of his 25
shots and was four of eight from
the free throw line as the Huskies
blew the Cards out of Ed
mundson Pavilion in the second
half.
Stanford trailed by only four,
37-33, at halftime but the Hus
kies, who've allowed only 69.5

points a contest, to rank as the
Pac-fl's best defensive team, al
lowed the Cards just 26 points in
the second half.
The Washington fastbreak, led
by Ramsey and backcourt mate
Chet "The Jet" Dorsey simply
was too quick for the Guards. Dor
sey added 10 points in the sec
ond half for the Huskies.
Washington outrebounded
Stanford 55-42 and as has been
the case for most of the season,
the Cards got most of their offen
sive punch from senior Ed
Schweitzer. The 6-H forward
scored 17 points to move into
eighth place on the Stanford
career scoring list with 1089
points, ahead of Hob Bedell's
1955 points.
He also moved into third

place, ahead of Ross Lawler 054
boards, on the Stanford career
rebounding chart, with 19
boards against the Huskies.
Stanford shot a dismal 34 per
cent from the floor (23-67), while
the Dogs were hitting on 34 of 73
shots for a 50 percent night.
Guard Mike Bratz had 14
points, but he also contributed
10 turnovers to the Cards' total of
22 miscues. Guards Wolfe Perry
and Jay Carter put in seven and
six points respectively. Card
forward George Schader wasn't a
force in the game, hitting only
four points.

blew the Cards out of Ed
mundson Pavilion in the second
half.

was too quick for the Guards. Dor
sey added 10 points in the sec
