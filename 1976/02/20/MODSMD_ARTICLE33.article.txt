# KZSU 'Sports Network' not a joke
## Basketball broadcasts, pro sports reports increase listenership 
### Daniel John Pyne 
Stanford basketball fans' only con
nection with the Card basketball team,
when it travels to remote Pullman.
Wash, tomorrow afternoon at 3, will be
the KZSU "Sports Network."
"Sports Network?"
Aha. "Sports Network."
Last fall, when Gary Cohen and Bob
Dean walked around the Stanford
Stadium, talking about a KZSU
"Sports Network," people chuckled.
Sports at Stanford's student-run sta
tion were never a very important part
of programming.
But this winter the "Network's" blue
blazers have been seen in every Pacific
Eight basketball arena, as KZSU
broadcast the Cards'Pac-8 games.
Yes, but doesn't a network have to
have more than just one station?
The "Sports Network" has graced
the ears of listeners as near as Santa
Clara (CAIN) and as far as Reno,
Nevada (KNEV FM) with broadcasts of
Stanford basketball games. Not exactly
ABC, but
'Spirit thing'
"It's more of a spirit thing," Dean
said. "1 think it gives people the im
pression that they're working for
something bigger than just KZSU."
Co-sports director with Cohen, Dean
said his sports staff now numbers
about 30, with a "core" staff of four or
live people, including Daily Basket
ball Issue Editor Mike Tollin.
The "Network" gets around. Sports
reporters cover Bay Area professional
basketball, baseball, football, tennis,
golt and even hockey with live reports
from games.
"That's one of our biggest things."
Cohen said, "no radio station anv

where has anyone at the games to give
a live report."
Dean added, "If there's a Warriors'
game in Oakland or a Seals' game, you
can tune in at 10:10 (p.m.) and know
what's happening ... up until Christ
mas we didn't miss one game."
23 games broadcast
But Cohen said, "Our major thing
that we've really done differently is
Stanford basketball — we do 23 games,
two hours each, for 40 hours of prog
ramming right there. That's most of
our air time. Last year we were lucky to
get anything."
The "Network" also has regular
sportscasts following KZSU news each
day, and last fall had two regular fea
tures each week — "Card Cut-ups" and
"Sportsline," a talk show with cam
pus sports notables. Both shows may
reappear this quarter, though Cohen
admitted that much of "Sportsline's"
success last quarter was due to the
Quarterback Controversy and prog
rams featuring Head Football Coach
Jack Christiansen or Stanford's three
quarterbacks.
In the spring the "Network" will
have broadcasts of Cardinal baseball
games from Sunken Diamond (and,
perhaps, Los Angeles), a live broadcast
of a crew race, reports from key tennis
matches, in addition to coverage of
professional baseball, soccer and ten
nis. It may even venture to Arizona to
cover baseball spring training.
Wide coverage
"We try to keep coverage of campus
sports; during the football season we
had reports from practice, and the up
coming game was always the top story
on sportscasts and . . ." he paused.

"Well, hell, some of our sportscasters
will open a cast with —"
"The Milwaukee Bucks," Dean cut
in.
Cohen laughed. " —the Milwaukee
Bucks, Kansas City-Omaha Kings
game instead of the Warriors' game or
even a Stanford volleyball game or
something, but primarily the idea is to
have a balanced focus between cam
pus and other sports news."
With underwriting the "Network" is
now able to make more road trips with
Stanford teams, including this
weekend in Washington. Underwrit
ing has, to date, added $1800 to the
sports department's station funding of

$500.
Cohen and Dean both see money as a
problem, though they said the
facilities at KZSU are excellent.
"Without the fee assessment," Cohen
said, "we'd be dead. A lot of other sta
tions get help from their universities,
but KZSU isn't a part of the University.
We can't even get credit for the work
we do."
But the credit comes in different
forms .... such as success.
'Gaining respect'
"I think people in the Athletic De
partment are starting to see we're for
real," Tollin said. "People are starting

to gain some respect for us, seeing that
we can and will cover them compe
tently."
Dean concurred, saying that the
KZSU basketball coverage is compe
tent because they work at it. "We know
the players personally — Mike Simons
did football casts for us, George
Schader is my roommate. We're
genuinely interested.
"We even tried to go to Hawaii with
the team to cover the games — not just
because it's Hawaii. We would have
tried if it was East Texas State, we just
couldn't get enough advertising."
Cohen looked at him blankly. "East
Texas State?" Silence. He laughed.
"It's a lot of work, and we put in a lot of
time, but it's still more fun than any
thing else."
Ego trip
"It's an ego trip," Dean said.
Cohen laughed again. "But it's alsoa
lot of fun."
Dean nodded. "I'll say one thing,
and you can print this. I've learned
more through KZSU than I have
through the Communication Depart
ment here. The first time I went into
the Warriors' locker room I was really
nervous, and I started doing things like
calling Jamal Wilkes 'Keith' and stuff
like that. Now we go in there and the
guys know us. We're usually the
youngest guys in the press box, and we
always get asked to see our press pas
ses. and get hassled a lot. but you learn
a lot."
Considering the value of a college
diploma these days, that means more
than a little. It may not be your conven
tional "Network," but with a little
work those blazers might just pass in
Montreal next August.

' HIE NETWORK' — The one thing that the KZSU "Sports Network" has done
differently this year is Stanford basketball. KZSU has broadcast 23 Stanford
basketball games this year. The basketball crew from left to right,
Gary Cohen, Los Angeles Times reporter Ron Rapport, a halftone guest,
engineer Mark Merrill and looking on. Mike Tollin.
Stanford basketball fans' only con
nection with the Card basketball team,
when it travels to remote Pullman.
Wash, tomorrow afternoon at 3, will be
the KZSU "Sports Network."
"Sports Network?"
Aha. "Sports Network."
Last fall, when Gary Cohen and Bob
Dean walked around the Stanford
Stadium, talking about a KZSU
"Sports Network," people chuckled.
Sports at Stanford's student-run sta
tion were never a very important part
of programming.
But this winter the "Network's" blue
blazers have been seen in every Pacific
Eight basketball arena, as KZSU
broadcast the Cards'Pac-8 games.
Yes, but doesn't a network have to
have more than just one station?
The "Sports Network" has graced
the ears of listeners as near as Santa
Clara (CAIN) and as far as Reno,
Nevada (KNEV FM) with broadcasts of
Stanford basketball games. Not exactly
ABC, but
'Spirit thing'
"It's more of a spirit thing," Dean
said. "1 think it gives people the im
pression that they're working for
something bigger than just KZSU."
Co-sports director with Cohen, Dean
said his sports staff now numbers
about 30, with a "core" staff of four or
live people, including Daily Basket
ball Issue Editor Mike Tollin.
The "Network" gets around. Sports
reporters cover Bay Area professional
basketball, baseball, football, tennis,
golt and even hockey with live reports
from games.
"That's one of our biggest things."
Cohen said, "no radio station anv

where has anyone at the games to give
a live report."
Dean added, "If there's a Warriors'
game in Oakland or a Seals' game, you
can tune in at 10:10 (p.m.) and know
what's happening ... up until Christ
mas we didn't miss one game."
23 games broadcast
But Cohen said, "Our major thing
that we've really done differently is
Stanford basketball — we do 23 games,
two hours each, for 40 hours of prog
ramming right there. That's most of
our air time. Last year we were lucky to
get anything."
The "Network" also has regular
sportscasts following KZSU news each
day, and last fall had two regular fea
tures each week — "Card Cut-ups" and
"Sportsline," a talk show with cam
pus sports notables. Both shows may
reappear this quarter, though Cohen
admitted that much of "Sportsline's"
success last quarter was due to the
Quarterback Controversy and prog
rams featuring Head Football Coach
Jack Christiansen or Stanford's three
quarterbacks.
In the spring the "Network" will
have broadcasts of Cardinal baseball
games from Sunken Diamond (and,
perhaps, Los Angeles), a live broadcast
of a crew race, reports from key tennis
matches, in addition to coverage of
professional baseball, soccer and ten
nis. It may even venture to Arizona to
cover baseball spring training.
Wide coverage
"We try to keep coverage of campus
sports; during the football season we
had reports from practice, and the up
coming game was always the top story
on sportscasts and . . ." he paused.

"Well, hell, some of our sportscasters
will open a cast with —"
"The Milwaukee Bucks," Dean cut
in.
Cohen laughed. " —the Milwaukee
Bucks, Kansas City-Omaha Kings
game instead of the Warriors' game or
even a Stanford volleyball game or
something, but primarily the idea is to
have a balanced focus between cam
pus and other sports news."
With underwriting the "Network" is
now able to make more road trips with
Stanford teams, including this
weekend in Washington. Underwrit
ing has, to date, added $1800 to the
sports department's station funding of

$500.
Cohen and Dean both see money as a
problem, though they said the
facilities at KZSU are excellent.
"Without the fee assessment," Cohen
said, "we'd be dead. A lot of other sta
tions get help from their universities,
but KZSU isn't a part of the University.
We can't even get credit for the work
we do."
But the credit comes in different
forms .... such as success.
'Gaining respect'
"I think people in the Athletic De
partment are starting to see we're for
real," Tollin said. "People are starting

to gain some respect for us, seeing that
we can and will cover them compe
tently."
Dean concurred, saying that the
KZSU basketball coverage is compe
tent because they work at it. "We know
the players personally — Mike Simons
did football casts for us, George
Schader is my roommate. We're
genuinely interested.
"We even tried to go to Hawaii with
the team to cover the games — not just
because it's Hawaii. We would have
tried if it was East Texas State, we just
couldn't get enough advertising."
Cohen looked at him blankly. "East
Texas State?" Silence. He laughed.
"It's a lot of work, and we put in a lot of
time, but it's still more fun than any
thing else."
Ego trip
"It's an ego trip," Dean said.
Cohen laughed again. "But it's alsoa
lot of fun."
Dean nodded. "I'll say one thing,
and you can print this. I've learned
more through KZSU than I have
through the Communication Depart
ment here. The first time I went into
the Warriors' locker room I was really
nervous, and I started doing things like
calling Jamal Wilkes 'Keith' and stuff
like that. Now we go in there and the
guys know us. We're usually the
youngest guys in the press box, and we
always get asked to see our press pas
ses. and get hassled a lot. but you learn
a lot."
Considering the value of a college
diploma these days, that means more
than a little. It may not be your conven
tional "Network," but with a little

through the Communication Depart
ment here. The first time I went into
the Warriors' locker room I was really
nervous, and I started doing things like
calling Jamal Wilkes 'Keith' and stuff
like that. Now we go in there and the
guys know us. We're usually the
youngest guys in the press box, and we
always get asked to see our press pas
ses. and get hassled a lot. but you learn
a lot."
Considering the value of a college
diploma these days, that means more

work those blazers might just pass in

' HIE NETWORK' — The one thing that the KZSU "Sports Network" has done
differently this year is Stanford basketball. KZSU has broadcast 23 Stanford
basketball games this year. The basketball crew from left to right,

engineer Mark Merrill and looking on. Mike Tollin.
Stanford basketball fans' only con
nection with the Card basketball team,
when it travels to remote Pullman.
Wash, tomorrow afternoon at 3, will be
the KZSU "Sports Network."
"Sports Network?"
Aha. "Sports Network."
Last fall, when Gary Cohen and Bob
Dean walked around the Stanford
Stadium, talking about a KZSU
"Sports Network," people chuckled.
Sports at Stanford's student-run sta
tion were never a very important part
of programming.
But this winter the "Network's" blue
blazers have been seen in every Pacific
Eight basketball arena, as KZSU
broadcast the Cards'Pac-8 games.
Yes, but doesn't a network have to
have more than just one station?
The "Sports Network" has graced
the ears of listeners as near as Santa
Clara (CAIN) and as far as Reno,
Nevada (KNEV FM) with broadcasts of
Stanford basketball games. Not exactly
ABC, but
'Spirit thing'
"It's more of a spirit thing," Dean
said. "1 think it gives people the im
pression that they're working for
something bigger than just KZSU."
Co-sports director with Cohen, Dean
said his sports staff now numbers
about 30, with a "core" staff of four or
live people, including Daily Basket
ball Issue Editor Mike Tollin.
The "Network" gets around. Sports
reporters cover Bay Area professional
basketball, baseball, football, tennis,
golt and even hockey with live reports
from games.
"That's one of our biggest things."
Cohen said, "no radio station anv

where has anyone at the games to give
a live report."
Dean added, "If there's a Warriors'
game in Oakland or a Seals' game, you
can tune in at 10:10 (p.m.) and know
what's happening ... up until Christ
mas we didn't miss one game."
23 games broadcast
But Cohen said, "Our major thing
that we've really done differently is
Stanford basketball — we do 23 games,
two hours each, for 40 hours of prog
ramming right there. That's most of
our air time. Last year we were lucky to
get anything."
The "Network" also has regular
sportscasts following KZSU news each
day, and last fall had two regular fea
tures each week — "Card Cut-ups" and
"Sportsline," a talk show with cam
pus sports notables. Both shows may
reappear this quarter, though Cohen
admitted that much of "Sportsline's"
success last quarter was due to the
Quarterback Controversy and prog
rams featuring Head Football Coach
Jack Christiansen or Stanford's three
quarterbacks.
In the spring the "Network" will
have broadcasts of Cardinal baseball
games from Sunken Diamond (and,
perhaps, Los Angeles), a live broadcast
of a crew race, reports from key tennis
matches, in addition to coverage of
professional baseball, soccer and ten
nis. It may even venture to Arizona to
cover baseball spring training.
Wide coverage
"We try to keep coverage of campus
sports; during the football season we
had reports from practice, and the up
coming game was always the top story
on sportscasts and . . ." he paused.

"Well, hell, some of our sportscasters
will open a cast with —"
"The Milwaukee Bucks," Dean cut
in.
Cohen laughed. " —the Milwaukee
Bucks, Kansas City-Omaha Kings
game instead of the Warriors' game or
even a Stanford volleyball game or
something, but primarily the idea is to
have a balanced focus between cam
pus and other sports news."
With underwriting the "Network" is
now able to make more road trips with
Stanford teams, including this
weekend in Washington. Underwrit
ing has, to date, added $1800 to the
sports department's station funding of

$500.
Cohen and Dean both see money as a
problem, though they said the
facilities at KZSU are excellent.
"Without the fee assessment," Cohen
said, "we'd be dead. A lot of other sta
tions get help from their universities,
but KZSU isn't a part of the University.
We can't even get credit for the work
we do."
But the credit comes in different
forms .... such as success.
'Gaining respect'
"I think people in the Athletic De
partment are starting to see we're for
real," Tollin said. "People are starting

to gain some respect for us, seeing that
we can and will cover them compe
tently."
Dean concurred, saying that the
KZSU basketball coverage is compe
tent because they work at it. "We know
the players personally — Mike Simons
did football casts for us, George
Schader is my roommate. We're
genuinely interested.
"We even tried to go to Hawaii with
the team to cover the games — not just
because it's Hawaii. We would have
tried if it was East Texas State, we just
couldn't get enough advertising."
Cohen looked at him blankly. "East
Texas State?" Silence. He laughed.
"It's a lot of work, and we put in a lot of
time, but it's still more fun than any
thing else."
Ego trip
"It's an ego trip," Dean said.
Cohen laughed again. "But it's alsoa
lot of fun."
Dean nodded. "I'll say one thing,
and you can print this. I've learned
more through KZSU than I have
through the Communication Depart
ment here. The first time I went into
the Warriors' locker room I was really
nervous, and I started doing things like
