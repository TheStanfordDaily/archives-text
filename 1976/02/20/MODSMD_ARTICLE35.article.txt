# Defend S.F. City title
## Women golfers open season 
### Marc Strassman 
"1 don't think we'll lose any
tournaments this year," pre
dicted a confident Carroll Diaz,
coach of the Stanford women's
golf team. Her Robber Barons
will test that statement this
weekend, when they compete in
the San Francisco City Champ
ionships.
"We're stronger this year than
we were last year, when we won
the league championship," she
added. "And 1 don't seeany team
improving enough to defeat us."
Senior Pat Cornett will defend
her 1975 San Francisco City title
this weekend. Cornett and
teammate Pant Palmieri qual
ified for the championship flight
of the prestigious tournament.
Won City crown
Palmieri won the City crown
in 1973. Cornett won the 1975
California Women's Amateur
Championship. The two women
were co-medalists at the Trans-
National in Tulsa last year, win

ning that competition together.
Also competing in the City
tournament's first flight will be
freshman Sally Voss and junior
f.ibby Docker. Completing the
squad are juniors Ellen Sale and
Darragh Davis and sophomore
Sue Hoover.
The team will open its regular
season March 4, with a NCIAC
Tournament at Almaden Coun
try Club in San Jose. The Barons
will be competing against the
other six, or possibly seven,
teams which make up the NCIAC
conference.
They are: Santa Clara, San lose
State, Sacramento State, UC-
Davis, Pacific, San Francisco
State and possibly Nevada.
Six league tourneys
This will be followed by six
more league tournaments, to be
held at the San Jose Municipal
golf course on April 6: at IJC-
Davis and Sacramento State on
April 19, and Sun Devil Invita
tional at Phoenix April 22-

23; at Stanford, May 7; and
the Daisy Duck Invitational at
Oregon, May 17-18.
Teams get one point for each
team they beat in tournament
play and the team with the high
est total over the whole season
will win the league champion
ship.
There will also be a North-
South Statewide Competition
May 1, which Diaz expects will
include two or three Stanford
women in the Northern Califor
nia foursome, which will consist
of those women with the lowest
scores for all league tourna
ments.
Finally, on fune 14-18 the
Robber Barons will participate
when the AIAW (Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women) holds its national
championships at Micl J gan
State.
Women's Pro-Am tourney
Diaz mentioned that the first
annual Stanford Women's

Pro-Am Tournament will take
place on May 3. A benefit for
the Stanford women's golf team,
with an entry fee of $40 ($3O of
which is tax deductible), the
event will include luncheon and
refreshments. Its purpose is to
raise money for uniforms and
equipment and to enable the
team to compete in out-of-state
collegiate tournaments. The re
gistration deadline is April 10.
Diaz, who is a Senior Teaching
Associate as well as the team's
coach, offered some general re
marks on the changing status of
women in golf.
She commented on the differ
ences between men and wo
men's professional golf, saying
the purses are often one fourth
the size in woman's tournaments
of comparable importance, rang
ing around $5,000-6000 for
women and $16,000-20,000 for
men. This gap, she claimed, is
narrowing, with women's prizes
now approaching closer to 50
percent of those available to
men.
"Why there are fewer spec
tators for women's golf, 1 can't
tell you," she admitted, saying
that she enjoys it just as much,
especially since "the galleries
are smaller at women's tourna
ments, and you can see the golf."
Diaz also mentioned that
golfer Ann Quast Sanders (along
with tennis player Janie Albert)
were among those inductees
admitted to the Stanford Hall of
Fame last Saturday.
She also pointed out that the
Stanford Golf Course has been
listed as one of the nations top
100 courses by Golf Digest for
five consecutive years. On the
subject of rankings, she also said
she expects her Barons to be
ranked in the top 10 nationally.
She said, however, that there
are now a few women trying to
become golf course architects.
Asked if there might eventually
be golf courses specifically de
signed and built to meet the spe
cial needs of women, she said, "1
think so; I hope so," adding that
these new women architects
might find it possible "at least, to
incorporate features that will be
able to meet the special needs of
both women and men."
