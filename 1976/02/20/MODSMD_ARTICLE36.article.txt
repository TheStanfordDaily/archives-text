Eight recruits sign
Wednesday, Stanford football
coach Jack Christiansen opened
his mail very carefully. It was the
first day that recruits could sign
National Letters of Intent.
The Cards received eight sig
natures, way under the 23 who
signed last year. Heading the list
of first day recruits was Brent
Saylor, a 6-foot-5 255, all-state
lineman from West Albany High
School in Oregon. Last year most
of Stanford's prospects returned
their letters the first day. But this
year four recruits are still unde
cided. One of them is debating
between Stanford and
Washington and another bet
ween Stanford and Alabama.
