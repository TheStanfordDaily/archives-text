# Card wrestlers in Pac-8 meet
## Govea looks to law career 
### Bruce Anderson 
When John Govea sheds his
wrestling garb at the end of the
season, he would like to go to
law school so that he can return
to his hometown, Bakersfield,
and wrestle with the problems
there which face the chicano
community.
"The problem we have in
Bakersfield is that there are
hardly any chicano professional
people. We are mostly working
class people," Govea said.
"The chicano community
makes up 25 or 30 percent of
Bakersfield, but we have very lit
tle representation. The commun
ity (chicano) is politically, edu
cationally and economically
alienated. There are needs to be
filled, but without representa
tion they are not going to be fil
led," said the political science
major of the town where he
began wrestling nine years ago.
Law School
Govea hopes to go to Boalt
Law School, studying immigra
tion and labor law, next year.
He will soon be working with
chicanos on campus and in Palo
Alto on an "immigration pro
ject" to obtain papers for un
documented workers. Projects
such as this one have aroused his
interest in immigration law.
The plight of the United Farm
Workers (one of Govea's sisters
has been working with them for
10 years now) has spurred his
interest in labor law..

Ideally, he will do clinical
work, providing free or low cost
legal aid to chicanos in
Bakersfield and surrounding
communities.
If Govea can produce a record
as a lawyer anywhere compara
ble to his record on the mat. his
adversaries are in trouble.
Govea's wrestling mark last
year was a cool 20-4. This year
it's 26-5, with only this
weekend's Pacific-Eight Champ
ionships, and perhaps the NGAA
meet, left in the season.
Govea's wrestling abilities
and personal qualities made him
a unanimous choice by his
teammates last spring to be one
of this season's co-captains.
"He's respected and liked by
everyone on the team," said
wrestling coach Joe DeMeo. He
adds, however, "John's not a hril
ler type guy."
'Lead by example'
DeMeo's view reflects Govea's
own opinion of his role as cap
tain. "1 resent people telling me
what to do. Instead of pushing
everybody, I try to lead by exam
ple because I've had experience
with the other kind of captain,"
said the reserved senior in his
soft, unabrasive voice.
The Robber Barons will be
looking to his example when

they wrestle in Corvallis, Ore.
this weekend for the Pac-8
crown.
"John will be as good as any at
the Pac-B's," says DeMeo. Govea
will probably be seated third,
and he believes the key to reach
ing the finals will be to beat UC
LA's Timothy Bowman.
After this weekend, or maybe
not until after the NCAA Wrestl
ing Championships in Tucson.
Ariz, next month, he will return
to working as part of a recreation
program for children in Last Palo
Alto. It is something he enjoys
doing, helping other members of
the Chicano community have a
better go at life.

The Stanford wrestling team is
in the Corvallis home of Oregon
State's Beavers today and tomor
row for the Pacific Eight Wrestl
ing Championships.
And while the host Beavers
and their immediate neighbor to
the south, Oregon's Ducks, will
probably make contention for
the team title an Oregonian exc
lusive, Stanford sends several
wrestlers north who should
make serious inroads in the in
dividual competition.
Stanford's mixed band of
wrestling neophytes and griz

zled veterans travels north corn
ing off its best dual meet of the
year. And those who shone in
the Cards' 29-17 thumping of
San Jose State last Thursday (av
enging an earlier loss to the
Spartans) will carry Stanford's
hopes in Corvallis.
Senior John Govea, 190-
pounds and junior Craig
Reyolds, 158-or 167-pounds,
appear to have the best chances
at individual laurels. Both have
won with great consistency for
the Cardinals throughout the
season. They warmed up for this
weekend with overwhelming
decisions in the match against
San Jose, Covea winning. 15-7,
and Reynolds, 17-4.
Mark Taguchi, 150-pounds,
and heavyweight Gary Ander
son ended the dual season even
more impressively, both taking
pins against the Spartans.
Taguchi's pincame when he was
trailing, 2-0 and he had just been
on his back. From his back he
worked a reversal and gained an
immediate pin. Both should fi
gure in the outcome of their
weight classifications this
weekend.
Darkhorses among the Stan
ford contingent may be Michael
King, 118-pounds; Eric Grun
seth, 158- or 167-pounds; and
Lester Yoshida, 126-pounds.

QUICK PIN — Stanford wres
tler John Govea, who will lead
the Cards as they battle for the
Pac-8 wrestling crown in Cor
vallis, Ore. this weekend, pins a
San Jose State wrestler in a meet
earlier this year. Govea plans to
attend law school and then re
turn to his native Bakersfield to
solve the problems which
plague the central valley com
munity. If he can match his im-
Eressive record on the mat, he'll
e in good shape.
