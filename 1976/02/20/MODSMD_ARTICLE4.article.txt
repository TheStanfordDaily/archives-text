# Stanford, Cal plan library cooperative
## 
### Bob Fikso 
The University and UC-Berkeley are
considering a large-scale research lib
rary cooperative program which
would create combined library hold
ings which would be second only to
Harvard in the nation, Stanford library
officials announced Wednesday.
An open hearing on the proposal has
been scheduled for 4:15 p.m. Monday
in Rm. 401 of the Main Library.
The proposed cooperation between
the two library systems includes a
coordinated acquisitions policy for
low-use items, reciprocal borrowing
privileges at all campus libraries ex
cept undergraduate libraries and a
transportation system for the daily
movement of books and patrons be
tween campuses.
When the program, which has been
on the drawing board for a year, is fully
implemented, all University academic
personnel and graduate students will
be eligible for borrowing privileges at
Berkeley and vice versa.
Asked yesterday why under

graduates were not mentioned as even
tual eligible inter-campus borrowers,
Religious Studies Prof. William
Clebsch. chairman of the Academic
Council Committee on Libraries, stres
sed the "research rather than instruc
tional'.' emphasis of the proposed
program.
Clebsch added, however, that un
dergraduates involved in bona fide re
search projects, such as honors theses,
would be able to obtain graduate stu
dent research privileges for the dura
tion of their research.
A coordinated acquisitions policy,
in which each university specializes in
certain areas, is the most far-reaching
aspect of the proposal, Clebsch said. If
the proposal is approved, the two uni
versities will begin specializing in
selected low-use collection areas.
"Once specialization begins,"
Clebsch said, "it won't be long before
turning back on the program will be
difficult or even impossible, especially
under conditions of budgetary
stringency. So we are talking about a
program that will quickly become
long-range."
If the proposal is approved by both
institutions, implementation will
begin this July and be completed by
September 1977.
Funding for the cooperative prog
ram will come froma one-time $50,000
allocation out of each university lib
rary system's book budget. Subsequent
incremental costs will come from the
operating budget of each system.
The proposal extends the already
existing cooperation of the two library
systems, which include a joint
clearing house for particularly expen
sive acquisitions, a direct borrowing
service tor faculty and daily book de
livery between campuses.
