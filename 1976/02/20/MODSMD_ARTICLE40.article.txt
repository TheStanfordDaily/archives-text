Hearst takes sth Amendment
SAN FRANCISCO — Patricia Hearst invoked the
Fifth Amendment 19 times yesterday as her lawyer
sought to bar questioning that he said could lead to
her indictment tor other crimes.
Calmly obeying instructions from F. Lee Bailey
to remain silent on the subject of her travels during
the 12 months before her capture, Hearst repeated
again and again, "1 refuse to answer on the grounds
that I might incriminate myself."
Earlier, under cross-examination by U.S. Atty.
James browning with the jury in her bank robbery
trial present, Hearst said she was not sure she was
in fact brainwashed by the Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA). "I'm not sure what happened to me,"
she said. She also said she had felt abandoned by
her parents — a comment that brought tears to her
mother's eyes.
She conceded that perhaps she "should have
taken a chance" and availed herself of an offer by
her captors to walk to freedom, even though she
doubted their sincerity. And she cried when asked
to recount details of physical abuse suffered after
her kidnap two years ago.
With the jury out of the courtroom, Bailey and
Browning argued, sometimes bitterly, before U.S.
District Court Judge Oliver Carter. At issue was the
government's efforts to tell the panel about dates
and places that might link the young defendant to a
Sacramento-area bank robbery and apparent plans
for others.
After 1 learst five times refused to answer Brown
ing's questions, Carter upheld her right to remain
silent in response to direct queries. But he agreed to
rule later on whether she could be required to iden
tify potentially incriminating documents taken
from her last fugitive hideout.
Hearst became agitated when asked to repeat de
tails of her rape by two SLA captors as Browning
sought to establish that she had developed an emo
tional attachment.
Jurors find Little innocent
LOS ANGELES — Symbionese Liberation Army
member Russell Little was found innocent yester
day on charges stemming from a shootout with
Concord police but jurors said they were still dead
locked on similar charges against Joseph Remiro
despite 18 days of deliberations.
The seven-woman and five-man Superior Court
jury had been deliberating since Jan. 30 on assault
and attempted murder charges against Little and
Remiro, already under life sentences for the murder

of Oakland Schools Supt. Marcus Foster.
Neither Little nor Remiro showed any emotion
when the verdict was announced.
Although the decision on Little was announced,
the jury must still try to reach a verdict on the two
charges against Remiro.
British urge land surrender
LONDON — Britain urged South Africa yester
day to surrender the disputed land of Namibia, or
South-VVest Africa, within a year or face another
Angola-type conflict. A Namibian guerrilla leader
raised the same prospect, saying his people "re
serve the right" to call for Cuban intervention.
David Ennals, minister of state for foreign affairs,
enunciating British government policy, also pres
sed Rhodesia's white minority rulers to seize "their
last chance" of averting a racial "bloodbath" that
could draw Cuban and other Communist forces into
the struggle.
Ennals, in a policy speech to the Royal Com
monwealth and African Societies, said South Afri
ca's occupation of Namibia, a former German pro
tectorate, "is unlawful and she should withdraw
within a year to permit the election of a government
under U.N. supervision."
He said unless South Africans come to terms with
their neighbors quickly, then "for the first time the
black population may be influenced by material as
well as moral support from outside."
Ennals said the Soviet press has served notice
that the Cuban-Soviet role in Angola is only a
stepping-stone toward the development of "libera
tion struggles" for the black majorities in Namibia,
Rhodesia and South Africa itself.
Ennals also said "it would be madness" for any
British government to commit troops to protect the
whites of Africa against the black majority.
But he left open the door for a limited British
"policing operation" in Rhodesia, provided it
swiftly ends its decade-long breakaway from Bri
tain and in the event of Cuban or Soviet interven
tion.
Ford nullifies WWII order
WASHINGTON — President Ford yesterday
signed a proclamation that he said should have
been enacted years ago nullifying the World Warll
order under which 112,000 Japanese-Americans
were sent to relocation camps.
The internment order was signed by President

Franklin Roosevelt 34 years ago yesterday and was
never really lifted. On Dec. 31, 1946. President
Harry S Truman declared the end of World War II
hostilities, which effectively nullified the order.
But some Japanese-Americans were concerned that
the internment order technically remains in effect.
As Ford signed the proclamation in the presence
of some 40 Japanese-American and Hawaiian dig
nitaries. he said "this should have been done a
long time ago. but it's done now."
Senate upholds Ford veto
WASHINGTON — President Ford's veto of a $6.1
billion public works jobs bill was uphelfl yesterday
when the Senate failed to muster the two-thirds
margin needed to override.
The veto in the Senate was 63 to 35 to override,
tliree short of the necessary margin.
The Senate voted less than three hours after the
House supported overriding the veto by a 319-98
margin, 41 votes more than thi? necessary two
thirds.
The failure of the Senate to override was a victory
for the President, whose lobbyists had been pes
simistic about chances of sustaining a veto.
The Democratic congressional leadership con
tended the measure would create up to 800,000
public works jobs. In his veto message last Friday,
Ford disputed that claim.
"The truth is that this bill would do little to create
jobs for the unemployed," the President said.
Agency votes to cut gas lead
LOS ANGELES — Galifornia's antismog agency
voted yesterday to require a drastic reduction of
lead in gasoline over the next four years to protect
public health.
If it survives expected court challenges, the law
would be the first successful regulation of gasoline
lead content by the federal government or any state.
By a unanimous 3-0 vote, the state Air Resources
Board approved the phase-down program, which
begins next January. It will all but eliminate lead
additives in gasoline sold in California by 1980.

Fifth Amendment 19 times yesterday as her lawyer
sought to bar questioning that he said could lead to
her indictment tor other crimes.
Calmly obeying instructions from F. Lee Bailey
to remain silent on the subject of her travels during
the 12 months before her capture, Hearst repeated
again and again, "1 refuse to answer on the grounds
that I might incriminate myself."
Earlier, under cross-examination by U.S. Atty.
James browning with the jury in her bank robbery
trial present, Hearst said she was not sure she was
in fact brainwashed by the Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA). "I'm not sure what happened to me,"
she said. She also said she had felt abandoned by
her parents — a comment that brought tears to her
mother's eyes.
She conceded that perhaps she "should have
taken a chance" and availed herself of an offer by
her captors to walk to freedom, even though she
doubted their sincerity. And she cried when asked
to recount details of physical abuse suffered after
her kidnap two years ago.
With the jury out of the courtroom, Bailey and
Browning argued, sometimes bitterly, before U.S.
District Court Judge Oliver Carter. At issue was the
government's efforts to tell the panel about dates
and places that might link the young defendant to a
Sacramento-area bank robbery and apparent plans
for others.
After 1 learst five times refused to answer Brown
ing's questions, Carter upheld her right to remain
silent in response to direct queries. But he agreed to
rule later on whether she could be required to iden
tify potentially incriminating documents taken
from her last fugitive hideout.
Hearst became agitated when asked to repeat de
tails of her rape by two SLA captors as Browning
sought to establish that she had developed an emo
tional attachment.
Jurors find Little innocent
LOS ANGELES — Symbionese Liberation Army
member Russell Little was found innocent yester
day on charges stemming from a shootout with
Concord police but jurors said they were still dead
locked on similar charges against Joseph Remiro
despite 18 days of deliberations.
The seven-woman and five-man Superior Court
jury had been deliberating since Jan. 30 on assault
and attempted murder charges against Little and
Remiro, already under life sentences for the murder

of Oakland Schools Supt. Marcus Foster.
Neither Little nor Remiro showed any emotion
when the verdict was announced.
Although the decision on Little was announced,
the jury must still try to reach a verdict on the two
charges against Remiro.
British urge land surrender
LONDON — Britain urged South Africa yester
day to surrender the disputed land of Namibia, or
South-VVest Africa, within a year or face another
Angola-type conflict. A Namibian guerrilla leader
raised the same prospect, saying his people "re
serve the right" to call for Cuban intervention.
David Ennals, minister of state for foreign affairs,
enunciating British government policy, also pres
sed Rhodesia's white minority rulers to seize "their
last chance" of averting a racial "bloodbath" that
could draw Cuban and other Communist forces into
the struggle.
Ennals, in a policy speech to the Royal Com
monwealth and African Societies, said South Afri
ca's occupation of Namibia, a former German pro
tectorate, "is unlawful and she should withdraw
within a year to permit the election of a government
under U.N. supervision."
He said unless South Africans come to terms with
their neighbors quickly, then "for the first time the
black population may be influenced by material as
well as moral support from outside."
Ennals said the Soviet press has served notice
that the Cuban-Soviet role in Angola is only a
stepping-stone toward the development of "libera
tion struggles" for the black majorities in Namibia,
Rhodesia and South Africa itself.
Ennals also said "it would be madness" for any
British government to commit troops to protect the
whites of Africa against the black majority.
But he left open the door for a limited British
"policing operation" in Rhodesia, provided it
swiftly ends its decade-long breakaway from Bri
tain and in the event of Cuban or Soviet interven
tion.
Ford nullifies WWII order
WASHINGTON — President Ford yesterday
signed a proclamation that he said should have
been enacted years ago nullifying the World Warll
order under which 112,000 Japanese-Americans
were sent to relocation camps.
The internment order was signed by President

Franklin Roosevelt 34 years ago yesterday and was
never really lifted. On Dec. 31, 1946. President
Harry S Truman declared the end of World War II
hostilities, which effectively nullified the order.
But some Japanese-Americans were concerned that
the internment order technically remains in effect.
As Ford signed the proclamation in the presence
of some 40 Japanese-American and Hawaiian dig
nitaries. he said "this should have been done a
long time ago. but it's done now."
Senate upholds Ford veto
WASHINGTON — President Ford's veto of a $6.1
billion public works jobs bill was uphelfl yesterday
when the Senate failed to muster the two-thirds
margin needed to override.
The veto in the Senate was 63 to 35 to override,
tliree short of the necessary margin.
The Senate voted less than three hours after the
House supported overriding the veto by a 319-98
margin, 41 votes more than thi? necessary two
thirds.
The failure of the Senate to override was a victory
for the President, whose lobbyists had been pes
simistic about chances of sustaining a veto.
The Democratic congressional leadership con
tended the measure would create up to 800,000
public works jobs. In his veto message last Friday,
Ford disputed that claim.
"The truth is that this bill would do little to create
jobs for the unemployed," the President said.
Agency votes to cut gas lead
LOS ANGELES — Galifornia's antismog agency
voted yesterday to require a drastic reduction of
lead in gasoline over the next four years to protect
public health.
If it survives expected court challenges, the law
would be the first successful regulation of gasoline
lead content by the federal government or any state.
By a unanimous 3-0 vote, the state Air Resources
Board approved the phase-down program, which
begins next January. It will all but eliminate lead
additives in gasoline sold in California by 1980.

her indictment tor other crimes.
Calmly obeying instructions from F. Lee Bailey
to remain silent on the subject of her travels during
the 12 months before her capture, Hearst repeated
again and again, "1 refuse to answer on the grounds
that I might incriminate myself."
Earlier, under cross-examination by U.S. Atty.
James browning with the jury in her bank robbery
trial present, Hearst said she was not sure she was
in fact brainwashed by the Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA). "I'm not sure what happened to me,"
she said. She also said she had felt abandoned by
her parents — a comment that brought tears to her
mother's eyes.
She conceded that perhaps she "should have
taken a chance" and availed herself of an offer by
her captors to walk to freedom, even though she
doubted their sincerity. And she cried when asked
to recount details of physical abuse suffered after
her kidnap two years ago.
With the jury out of the courtroom, Bailey and
Browning argued, sometimes bitterly, before U.S.
District Court Judge Oliver Carter. At issue was the
government's efforts to tell the panel about dates
and places that might link the young defendant to a
Sacramento-area bank robbery and apparent plans
for others.
After 1 learst five times refused to answer Brown
ing's questions, Carter upheld her right to remain
silent in response to direct queries. But he agreed to
rule later on whether she could be required to iden
tify potentially incriminating documents taken
from her last fugitive hideout.
Hearst became agitated when asked to repeat de
tails of her rape by two SLA captors as Browning
sought to establish that she had developed an emo
tional attachment.
Jurors find Little innocent
LOS ANGELES — Symbionese Liberation Army
member Russell Little was found innocent yester
day on charges stemming from a shootout with
Concord police but jurors said they were still dead
locked on similar charges against Joseph Remiro
despite 18 days of deliberations.
The seven-woman and five-man Superior Court
jury had been deliberating since Jan. 30 on assault
and attempted murder charges against Little and
Remiro, already under life sentences for the murder

of Oakland Schools Supt. Marcus Foster.
Neither Little nor Remiro showed any emotion
when the verdict was announced.
Although the decision on Little was announced,
the jury must still try to reach a verdict on the two
charges against Remiro.
British urge land surrender
LONDON — Britain urged South Africa yester
day to surrender the disputed land of Namibia, or
South-VVest Africa, within a year or face another
Angola-type conflict. A Namibian guerrilla leader
raised the same prospect, saying his people "re
serve the right" to call for Cuban intervention.
David Ennals, minister of state for foreign affairs,
enunciating British government policy, also pres
sed Rhodesia's white minority rulers to seize "their
last chance" of averting a racial "bloodbath" that
could draw Cuban and other Communist forces into
the struggle.
Ennals, in a policy speech to the Royal Com
monwealth and African Societies, said South Afri
ca's occupation of Namibia, a former German pro
tectorate, "is unlawful and she should withdraw
within a year to permit the election of a government
under U.N. supervision."
He said unless South Africans come to terms with
their neighbors quickly, then "for the first time the
black population may be influenced by material as
well as moral support from outside."
Ennals said the Soviet press has served notice
that the Cuban-Soviet role in Angola is only a
stepping-stone toward the development of "libera
tion struggles" for the black majorities in Namibia,
Rhodesia and South Africa itself.
Ennals also said "it would be madness" for any
British government to commit troops to protect the
whites of Africa against the black majority.
But he left open the door for a limited British
"policing operation" in Rhodesia, provided it
swiftly ends its decade-long breakaway from Bri
tain and in the event of Cuban or Soviet interven
tion.
Ford nullifies WWII order
WASHINGTON — President Ford yesterday
signed a proclamation that he said should have
been enacted years ago nullifying the World Warll
order under which 112,000 Japanese-Americans
were sent to relocation camps.
The internment order was signed by President

Franklin Roosevelt 34 years ago yesterday and was
never really lifted. On Dec. 31, 1946. President
Harry S Truman declared the end of World War II
hostilities, which effectively nullified the order.
But some Japanese-Americans were concerned that
the internment order technically remains in effect.
As Ford signed the proclamation in the presence
of some 40 Japanese-American and Hawaiian dig
nitaries. he said "this should have been done a
long time ago. but it's done now."
Senate upholds Ford veto
WASHINGTON — President Ford's veto of a $6.1
billion public works jobs bill was uphelfl yesterday
when the Senate failed to muster the two-thirds
margin needed to override.
The veto in the Senate was 63 to 35 to override,
tliree short of the necessary margin.
The Senate voted less than three hours after the
House supported overriding the veto by a 319-98
margin, 41 votes more than thi? necessary two
thirds.
The failure of the Senate to override was a victory
for the President, whose lobbyists had been pes
simistic about chances of sustaining a veto.
The Democratic congressional leadership con
tended the measure would create up to 800,000
public works jobs. In his veto message last Friday,
Ford disputed that claim.
"The truth is that this bill would do little to create
jobs for the unemployed," the President said.
Agency votes to cut gas lead
LOS ANGELES — Galifornia's antismog agency
voted yesterday to require a drastic reduction of
lead in gasoline over the next four years to protect
public health.
If it survives expected court challenges, the law
would be the first successful regulation of gasoline
lead content by the federal government or any state.
By a unanimous 3-0 vote, the state Air Resources
Board approved the phase-down program, which
begins next January. It will all but eliminate lead
additives in gasoline sold in California by 1980.
