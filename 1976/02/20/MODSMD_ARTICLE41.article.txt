# Senate supports new prof rank
## 
### Geoffrey Samuels 
The Faculty Senate passed a resolu
tion yesterday recommending the cre
ation of another associate professor
ship within the Adjunct Professoriate
of the School of Medicine.
The resolution, which must be ap
proved by the University's board of
trustees, specified that a new rank of
"Associate Professor of Clinical (Sub
ject)," is to be appointed for renewable
terms of up to six years duration. The
appointment will not follow standard
University tenure procedure.
Medical school Dean Clayton Rich
said that the current single rank in the
fulltime clinical faculty is inadequate,
because it presents difficulties in
promotion.
Although he did not mention the
name of the candidates for the new
position at the meeting, he said that
some of the individuals presently elig
ible for the new position do not have

the seasoning, experience and senior
ity which are usually associated with
the title of professor.
The new position, he said, would
alleviate that difficulty by presenting
an intermediary step within the ad
junct professoriate.
Rich added that the medical school
depends on a number of affiliated hos
pitals for adequate clinical experience
for its students. The new two-rank sys
tem for adjunct clinical professors
would accord better with their method
of ranking staff. Rich said, and is con
sidered preferable by them.
Rich said similar ranking systems
are currently employed at other medi
cal schools, including Harvard, Yale,
Columbia, Hopkins and Washington.
William A. Clebsch, chairman of
religious studies, opposed the resolu
tion and advised for a "complete reas
sessment" of the tenure system.
