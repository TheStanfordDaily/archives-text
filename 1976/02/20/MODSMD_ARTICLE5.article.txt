# New China premier surprise to professors

Professors here agree that the nam
ing of Hua Kuo-feng as acting China
premier was a surprise to all political
speculators. While not indicating the
exact date of the appointment, the Pek
ing Review began referring to Hua as
premier early this month.
"We know extraordinarily little
about Hua Kuo-feng; his political
views are not known to us, we don't
even know his age or if he is married,"
said Asst. Political Science Prof. Harry
Harding. Harding specializes in
Chinese politics and is presently a
member of a committee of University
faculty and staff studying United
States-China foreign relations.
"I, as well as most everyone else,
expected Teng Hsaio-p'ing (the rank
ing vice premier) to become the new

premier after the death of Chou En-lai
(the late premier)," said Assoc. History
Prof. Lyman VanSlyke.
"Rumors haWi it that his appoint
ment was an attempt at a compromise
among factions in the Chinese gov
ernment to settle for an interim prime
minister," said Harding. "Supposedly
them was a meeting of the Party Cent
ral Committee after the death, in
Jan i.•.:■» of Chou En-lai, and as a result
of a deadlock as to the question of who
the new prime minister should be. Hua
was chosen as someone who would be
temporarily acceptable for the job.
Broad spectrum
"What is of note when looking over
the broad spectrum of political control
in China is that Teng Hsaio-p'ing was
overlooked for the job," he said."No
one really expected Hua to be named
premier, when President Ford recently
visited China, it was Teng who or
ganized his visit, and this led
speculators to believe that Teng
would be the next prime minister.
"Teng, whose views toward stabili
zation and economical growth have
been attacked by the Left as subor
dinating the lower classes, probably is
taking the fact that he was not ap
pointed as a slap in the face. And what
this tells us is that there is probably a
Leftist trend in the political movement
in China," Harding added.
VanSlyke, however, cautioned
against arriving at conclusions too
rapidly. "We know so little about
Chinese politics that at any time we
can only point to vague trends and
even these we are not sure of."
Harding acknowledged the uncer
tainty of our knowledge, but sought to
interpret the implications of Hua's
past career. "From the relatively little

that we do know about Hua, we can
infer that he will probably seek to
maintain China's trend toward an ag
ricultural surge which we have seen
over the last year.
"He spent most of his career in the
Hunan province in central China
which is primarily an agricultural
area, and was an example of a man who
rose politically through the rural dis
tricts.
Compared with Ford
"Hua will not particularly dominate
the Council of Ministers in the same
way that Chou did, and it seems that he
has no interest in foreign affairs,"
Harding said. "This does not mean
that he will not develop an interest in
this subject, but it is likely that he willt
depend on the foreign minister, much
as the way Ford depends on Kissinger,
to settle foreign issues.
"It must be kept in mind Hua is sim
ply an acting prime minister,and there
appear to be no immediate consequ
ences to his appointment,"he added.
