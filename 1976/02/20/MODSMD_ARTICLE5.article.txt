Professors here agree that the nam
ing of Hua Kuo-feng as acting China
premier was a surprise to all political
speculators. While not indicating the
exact date of the appointment, the Pek
ing Review began referring to Hua as
premier early this month.
"We know extraordinarily little
about Hua Kuo-feng; his political
views are not known to us, we don't
even know his age or if he is married,"
said Asst. Political Science Prof. Harry
Harding. Harding specializes in
Chinese politics and is presently a
member of a committee of University
faculty and staff studying United
States-China foreign relations.
"I, as well as most everyone else,
expected Teng Hsaio-p'ing (the rank
ing vice premier) to become the new

premier after the death of Chou En-lai
(the late premier)," said Assoc. History
Prof. Lyman VanSlyke.
"Rumors haWi it that his appoint
ment was an attempt at a compromise
among factions in the Chinese gov
ernment to settle for an interim prime
minister," said Harding. "Supposedly
them was a meeting of the Party Cent
ral Committee after the death, in
Jan i.•.:■» of Chou En-lai, and as a result
of a deadlock as to the question of who
the new prime minister should be. Hua
was chosen as someone who would be
temporarily acceptable for the job.
Broad spectrum
"What is of note when looking over
the broad spectrum of political control
in China is that Teng Hsaio-p'ing was
overlooked for the job," he said."No
