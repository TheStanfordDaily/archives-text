## Quakers seek 'world embrace' 
### 
Katherine Rambo

On Dec. 15, 1975, a bomb
exploded outside an annexed
Victorian-era Quaker meeting
house, and the American
Friends Service Committee's
(AFSC)regional headquarters in
Des Moines, lowa, destroying a
large portion of both buildings.
Despite this incident, and
other similar to it involving
other minority groups and un
popular causes, the world is
moving away from the age when
threats and isolation kept the re
ligious and social status quo;
only people with minds still en
trenched in the Reformation will
mourn its passing.
People 1 ike Josh McDowell, for
example, are rapidly becoming
anachronisms. It is an insult to
the world's two-billion non-
Christian people to be har
angued with a doctrine which
declares the viability of their
religious/cultural experience
ended 2000 years ago.
Sympathetic hearing
And it is difficult to gain a
sympathetic hearing from
people when they are told the
only way to avoid damnation for
the sin of their non-Christianity
is to reject their religious/
cultural heritage and embrace
the complete Christian experi
ence.
The God of someone like Josh
remains a tribal God; small
minded, jealous, unable toadmit
to the prodigiously expanded
needs and life-styles of a world
grown far beyond a small tribe in
the Judean wilderness.
In the present age, cultural
and religious groups have three
alternatives.
The first is the traditional
segregate and/or destroy all
non-conforming groups within
one's own territory. This solu
tion is abhorrent to all reasoning
people.
The second is an agreement to
respect each other's beliefs' but
to co-exist peacefully in mutual
isolation, regarding all other
faiths and cultures as inviolate.
Elitism and mistrust
But this solution may lead to
elitism and mistrust, creating a
climate where oppression
breeds easily.
The third alternative is a new,
functional ecumenism, and
Quakers, regarding themselves
as a movement rather than a
church (allied to neither
Catholics or Protestants) are in a
unique position to help facilitate
this "world-embracing" ex
change.
Quakers are not bound to any
outward compulsory con-

formity. But nonetheless, they
are under an inner compulsion,
an inner discipline, to choose for
themselves and to be as faithful
to their individual duty as
though they were regimented to
a single credo.
Similarly, the Quaker sense of
being "joined to all the living,"
and the emphasis on inner faith,
which puts a minimum accent
on outward forms, makes Quak
ers at home in widely diverse
groups.
'Inner proletariat'
The Society of Friends might
be said to fit Arnold Toyenbee's
definition of an "inner pro
letariat;" a group within a civili
zation which, being in it, but not
of it, withdraws and returns to
make a creative response to a de
finite challenge.
Such an approach is taken
now in many Quaker sponsored
and/or affiliated projects, includ
ing the current system of work
camps; AFSC's volunteer prog
rams in South America, the
Middle East and rural United
Sates; and the Inner City Minis
tries of Los Angeles County.
Like the French Worker
Priests of a decade ago, Quakers
attempt to discover by participa
tion what people need and want,
and what initiatives people can
take in changing their condi
tions.
Practice fully
The ecumenical approach
does not involve wholesale syn
cretism, but encouragement to
practice religious and cultural
traditions as fully as possible,
and share them in every creative
way.
Through this process of
dialogue and mutual exchange,
it is possible to discover what
common ground all people pos
sess, and to work lo overcome
barriers of fear, misunderstand
ing and irresponsibility.
But this openness will also
leave participants vulnerable to
many, often painful mistakes.
They must be willing to give up
much of their egotism and ex
pose themselves to the question
ing and self-doubts that true
open-mindedness often brings.
For the key to this ecumenical
exchange is not a collective con
formity to a paticular creed, or
even system of creeds, but rec
ognition of the fact that genuine
differences do exist and matter
terribly; and that without such
diversity, life worth living can
not be maintained.
