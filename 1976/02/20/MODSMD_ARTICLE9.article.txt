# Scandal unfolds in Bahama banks
## 
### 
A massive new scandal is brewing in
Washington. Its star-studded cast includes
former President Richard Nixon, interna
tional swindler Robert Vesco and figures in
organized crime, the IRS and CIA.
The scandal grows out of IRS Commis
sioner Donald Alexander's decision last
year to curtail two IRS intelligence prog
rams, Operation Tradewinds and Project
Haven, geared at catching Bahama-based
tax evaders.
Using informants placed in key Baha
mian political and financial circles, the IRS
amassed information on the plans of U.S.
organized crime figures, politicians, and
businessmen (including Howard Hughes
and Robert Vesco) to invest millions of dol
lars illegally in Bahamian bank accounts,
land deals and casino developments.
Alexander's abrupt termination of the
programs caused a storm within the IRS and
provoked allegations that Alexander was
covering up for certain of his associates im
plicated by the investigation. A congres
sional committee and two grand juries are
now reviewing specific charges against
Alexander.
The other side
Many IRS agents believe Alexander is
"working for the other side." "He's dis
mantling in a year what it has taken decades
to put together," lamented one agent, refer
ring to the end of IRS investigations of or
ganized crime.
What makes Alexander's termination of
Project Haven especially suspicious is his
unannounced decision last year to drop the
requirement on 1040 forms that taxpayers
disclose whether they have secret foreign
bank accounts.
Alexander claims the forms have insuffi
cient space for the short, one sentence ques
tion. However, Senator William Proxmire
(D-Wis.) says the decision "clearly runs
contrary to the intent of the Bank Secrecy
Act" of 1970, designed to curb misuse of
secret Swiss bank accounts.
A House subcommittee report recently
charged that Alexander's decisions "consti
tute a free pass to organized crime figures
and others seeking to evade or avoid the
payment of federal taxes."
Extraordinary scandal
Now that theJusticeDepartmenthas taken
over Project Haven, a massive grand jury
probe is underway that one U.S. attorney
says will involve "thousands" of individu
als. News leaks suggest that if the case goes

to court it may become an extraordinary
scandal, exposing the criminal activities of
prominent politicians and businessmen.
For example, the Los Angeles Times,
quoting Congressional investigators said
that Nixon's name appears on computer
printouts secretly obtained from the Baha
mian Castle Bank, the prime target of federal
probes. Among the other clientele of this
bank, according to the Miami Herald, is "a
former Cleveland racketeer with top-level
gambling and political associations" and

other mob figures.
Nixon has repeatedly denied persistant
rumors that he maintains large foreign bank
accounts stuffed with money from Howard
Hughes, the Mafia or the Shah of Iran. The
Senate Watergate Committee seriously in
vestigated charges that Nixon held secret
accounts with the Cosmos Bank in Switzer
land with money "laundered" through the
Paradise Island Casino. Many organized
crime experts have charged that the Casino
fronts for mob chief Meyer Lansky.
The Casino's owner, James Crosby, do
nated $300,000 to Nixon's 1972 campaign,
and the Casino's security chief was once
Nixon's personal Secret Service guard.
Donald Nixon's report
Finally, John Meier, a former top consul
tant to Howard Hughes and close friend of
Nixon's brother Donald, claims to have
talked with Donald Nixon about alleged
secret bank accounts Richard Nixon holds
with Vesco's Bahamas Commonwealth
Bank. Donald Nixon, a business partner of
both Hughes and Vesco, might well have
known. (Donald Nixon and Vesco are now
the subject of a federal grand jury probe into
their alleged worldwide narcotics opera
tions.)
Significantly, Vesco's notorious $200,000
cash contribution to Richard Nixon came
from Vesco's untraceable accounts at the
Paradise Island Casino, according to jour
nalist Michael Dorman. Vesco liked the

Casino so much thai after meeting with top
Mafia leaders he offered to buy it for $35
million. The deal fell through when Vesco
came under federal investigation.
Although no one has publicly mentioned
the link, Vesco must be tied in to the Castle
Bank, headquartered near Vesco's own
Bahamas Commonwealth Bank. Vesco's
bank provided most of the funds for Baha
mian President Lyndon Pindling's 1973
purchase of a $4 50,000 luxury mansion.
The Castle Bank provided the remaining
$50,000, according to the Miami Herald.
Obscure attorney
The role of a far more obscure Miami
attorney, Paul L.E. Helliwell is even more
frightening. Helliwell, a director and U.S.
counsel to the bank, owns a controlling in
terest in the Bank of Perrine, an American
correspondent of the Caste Bank, which is
now also under federal grand jury investiga
tion. His chief partner in the Bank of Perrine
is counsel to a Bahamian gambling casino
company.
Helliwell is more than a Miami attorney.
Actually, according to Tai Szulc in an en
tirely different context, Helliwell (who
Szulc misspells "Holliwell") is a top rank
ing CIA official who heads Support Station
East in Miami, in charge of Latin American
and counterintelligence operations. Previ
ously, Helliwell worked in a CIA program
supporting anti-communist, opium
smuggling guerrilla forces in northern
Burma.
This would not be the first time the CIA
and Mafia linked up together (assassination
plots aside). In 1972 Jeff Gerth revealed that
James Angleton, the ClA's head of counter
intelligence, was a director of the obscure
International Bank of Miami, whose foun
der allegedly had remarkably close ties to
Meyer Lansky. Angleton resigned from the
CIA late in 1974 when he was charged with
responsibility for the ClA's domestic spying
program.
The CIA, Mafia, Vesco and Nixon have
all shown remarkable ability in the past to
escape federal prosecution. Nowtheyareall
reunited in the explosive Castle Bank case,
which Donald Alexander was unable to
suppress. It remains to be seen just how far
President Gerald Ford's Justice Department
will pursue the invstigation, and what new
revelations the investigation will yield.
