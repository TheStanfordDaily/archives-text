SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A
weekend raid on a makeshift bomb fac
tory is the latest in a series of develop
ments that have undermined the San
Francisco Bay Area's reputation as a
haven for revolutionaries.
After the raid, the FBl's chief agent
here said he hoped it had "broken the
back" of radicals who had taken re
sponsibility for numerous terrorist
bombings within the last two years.
Six persons were arrested Saturday
at a Richmond house that contained
bombs and literature from the New
World Liberation Front, a group called
the Emiliano Zapata Unit and "other
terrorist groups," said Charles Bates,
special agent in charge of the FBI office
here.
FBI agents and police Special
Weapons and Tactics teams launched
the action during predawn darkness,
and no one was hurt.
No explosives
A second house in Oakland, about
10 miles from Richmond, was raided
Saturday night by a five-man police
team. A man was taken into custody
after leaving the house during an af
ternoon stakeout, police said. Some
bomb-making materials such as wires
and timing devices — but no explo
sives — were found in the house.
Police said the man arrested iden
tified himself as Anthony Joseph
Baker, 21. His fingerprints were being
checked by the FBI.
The Saturday raids were the latest in
a series of developments that began
five months ago with the arrests of Pat
ricia Hearst and four of her under
ground companions.
Radical connections
The recent arrests of two other per
sons with radical connections after a
gun battle in Marin County led to the
raids in Richmond and north Oakland,
across the bay from San Francisco, au
thorities said.
Earlier this year, the FBI arrested
fugitive David Sylvan Fine in Marin
County. Fine, who had been on the
FBl's most-wanted list since being in
dicted Sept. 4,1970, in a fatal bombing
at the University of Wisconsin, was
captured in San Rafael, 18 miles north
of here.
Before his apprehension, Fine was
renting a room from David Cudhea, as
sistant director of communication in
the general secretary's office at Stan
ford.
The prize arrests by the FBI came
last Sept. 18, when Hearst and
another fugitive and two members of
the Symbionese Liberation Army
(SLA) that kidnaped her two years ago
