# Living with the 'no-fault' morality
## 
### 
Welcome to the no-fault society ....
In Alaska, the state government sits idly
by while a powerful Teamster boss, Jesse
Carr, and some imported thugs steal every
thing in the state except snow.
The consortium constructing the pipeline
doesn't care. It"is wi 1 ling to accept a certain
level of theft in order to buy labor peace,"
and to get its money back through higher
gas prices, according to the Los Angeles
Times.
The state government doesn't care, either.
Gov. Jay Hammond admits Carr is so power
ful "nobody is going to challenge him."
At Harvard, a professor who regularly
teaches a course on Nazi Germany notes
many of his students do not hold anyone
responsible for Nazi crimes.
Richard Hunt, associate dean of the Har
vard graduate school of arts and sciences,
notes his students have a "depressingly
fatalistic" view of the world which says
there was nothing anyone could have done
to prevent Hitler's regime. Many students,
Hunt says, would have voted to acquit or
pardon the Nuremberg defendants.
Properly contrite
Here in California, we have a unique sys
tem of justice in which the penalty you re
ceive has little to do with the crime commit
ted, only with whether the parole board and
judges think you are properly contrite and
unlikely to commit another crime. I'd bet
there isn't much a reasonably shrewd Stan
ford student could do short of an ax murder
that would land him in prison for more than
one year — if he knew how to act.
These examples point to a new era of to
lerance. Tolerance not only toward those

with diverse lifestyles, but toward criminals
of all sorts. The feeling seems to pervade
society that anyone who committed any
crime is simply a trapped victim of cir
cumstances, and shou Id not be punished for
that crime (though perhaps punished if we
don't like him).

Perhaps the reason for this no-fault view
of the world is the lack of any fixed values
against which to measure the behavior of
others.
Obedience
The old system of values, established by
the dominant groups in the United States,
and held by nearly everyone, instilled an
obedience toward the law and intolerance
toward those who disobeyed it.
That system, of course, has broken down
under the weight of its own hypocrisy. Sys
tems of criminal justice were used to prom
ote racism, keep laborers from organizing,
to protect the status quo at all costs.
The historic U.S. system of justice, many
of us would agree, simply penalized those
who never had a chance to do otherwise.
But now that set of values has been
weakened. Because of that, some strides are

being made toward equalizing justice for
rich and poor, and toward eliminating the
notion of victimless crime.
But also because of a void in the now
weakened set of values, an "it's cool" men
tality pervades. If you bribe foreign officials
it's cool. It's the way the game is played.
Stealing is 'cool'
If you want to steal from the pipeline
company, it's cool. Everyone knows the
company deserves it for ripping us off at the
gas pumps.
If you want to blow somebody away, it's
(reasonably) cool, so long as you promise
not to do it again, and we believe you. How
can we punish you, since you are only doing
what society made you do?
The problem is this: It should be possible
to impose moral judgments upon others, but
many people cannot do so because they are
unsure whether their values are anything
more than being the result of belonging to
an educated elite.
This feeling is partially responsible for
the inaction of honest officials against the
Alaska racketeers, as the officials have lost
the sense of direction which leads to a mis
sionary zeal against criminals. It is also re
sponsible for the deterministic views of the
Harvard students.
Until another value system can be pre
sented, one which will more closely lead to
justice, rather than to perpetuating in
equities in the status quo, the "no-fault"
view of the world will continue to prevail.

Welcome to the no-fault society ....
In Alaska, the state government sits idly
by while a powerful Teamster boss, Jesse
Carr, and some imported thugs steal every
thing in the state except snow.
The consortium constructing the pipeline
doesn't care. It"is wi 1 ling to accept a certain
level of theft in order to buy labor peace,"
and to get its money back through higher
gas prices, according to the Los Angeles
Times.
The state government doesn't care, either.
Gov. Jay Hammond admits Carr is so power
ful "nobody is going to challenge him."
At Harvard, a professor who regularly
teaches a course on Nazi Germany notes
many of his students do not hold anyone
responsible for Nazi crimes.
Richard Hunt, associate dean of the Har
vard graduate school of arts and sciences,
notes his students have a "depressingly
fatalistic" view of the world which says
there was nothing anyone could have done
to prevent Hitler's regime. Many students,
Hunt says, would have voted to acquit or
pardon the Nuremberg defendants.
Properly contrite
Here in California, we have a unique sys
tem of justice in which the penalty you re
ceive has little to do with the crime commit
ted, only with whether the parole board and
judges think you are properly contrite and
unlikely to commit another crime. I'd bet
there isn't much a reasonably shrewd Stan
ford student could do short of an ax murder
that would land him in prison for more than
one year — if he knew how to act.
These examples point to a new era of to
lerance. Tolerance not only toward those

with diverse lifestyles, but toward criminals
of all sorts. The feeling seems to pervade
society that anyone who committed any
crime is simply a trapped victim of cir
cumstances, and shou Id not be punished for
that crime (though perhaps punished if we
don't like him).

Perhaps the reason for this no-fault view
of the world is the lack of any fixed values
against which to measure the behavior of
others.
Obedience
The old system of values, established by
the dominant groups in the United States,
and held by nearly everyone, instilled an
obedience toward the law and intolerance
toward those who disobeyed it.
That system, of course, has broken down
under the weight of its own hypocrisy. Sys
tems of criminal justice were used to prom
ote racism, keep laborers from organizing,
to protect the status quo at all costs.
The historic U.S. system of justice, many
of us would agree, simply penalized those
who never had a chance to do otherwise.
But now that set of values has been
weakened. Because of that, some strides are

being made toward equalizing justice for
rich and poor, and toward eliminating the
notion of victimless crime.
But also because of a void in the now
weakened set of values, an "it's cool" men
tality pervades. If you bribe foreign officials
it's cool. It's the way the game is played.
