Missed bias
Jerry Lampton's cry to battle,
in his Feb. 17 Daily column,
against the "radical elite" which
"dominated" the selection of
ASSU Guest Professors deserves
a brief response, no more.
First, Lampton asserts the
selection of three Marxists "re
presents a blatant disregard for
the wishes of the overwhelming
majority of students." Who in
Leland's name is he kidding?
How does he know what the
overwhelming majority of stu
dents wish? And where was that
majority the day five members of
the STAND slate were elected to
the ASSU Senate? Off some
where, being satisfied, 1 im
agine.
Second, Lampton calls upon
the administration to block the
ASSU appointment. He claims
the three invited guests won't
benefit those who don't want to
study Marxism (presumably
himself included).
This last claim is true enough,
but Lampton has the alternative
of taking courses from any of the
multitude of professors here
who are more to his political lik
ing. He implies he is satisfied
with that group.
As for those who wish to study
Marxism (and I submit they are
more numerous than Lampton
wants to believe), the alterna
tives are as precious few as are
Marxist instructors at Stanford.
Lampton has missed the more
significant bias in this issue.

Moynihan's job
In response to the Feb. 11
Daily, 1 would like to take issue
with the views presented there.
Daniel Moynihan was the best
representative the United States
has ever had at the United Na
tions. For once, the Llnited States
was not pushed around by smal
ler nations, especially those of
the third world.
"He (Moynihan) scolded third
world leaders when he should
have listened to them explain
their countries' problems. In
stead of trying to understand the
aspirations of these nations, he
ridiculed them for failing to
acquiesce in American foreign

policy aims."
On the contrary, Moynihan
was only trying to understand
the aspirations of Americans,
and he frustrated third world
leaders because, for once, the
United States failed toacquiesce
in third world foreign policy
aims.
Moynihan was a man who re
fused to buckle under to pres
sure from the third world and
communist countries, although
so many American and Euro
pean leaders hae succumbed in
the past.
He forcefully upheld the
Jewish people in his almost
single-handed battle against the
United Nations anti-Zionism
measure. And he used his veto
power to keep North and South
Vietnam from joining the United
Nations in 1975.
Moynihan was a great asset to
the LJnited States. President
Gerald Ford cannot hope to re
place him with a man of such
force, character and ability.

Students' choice
As Stanford alumni in the
Arecibo, Puerto Rico area, we are
somewhat disappointed by the
administration's lack of en
thusiasm for "Robber Barons" as
the nickname for University
teams (athletic and otherwise).
Although it received only a
plurality in the recent referen
dum, Robber Barons was clearly
the choice of a significant
number of the students. Selec
tion of the Indian many years ago
was handled in no better way.
Robber Barons has a distinc
tiveness and relevance which
Cowboys, Huns, Cardinals,
Trees and Sequoias cannot
match. We believe it should be
given the fair chance the student
vote demands.
Richard Simpson
John Dickey
and four other
Stanford alumni
Require helmets
As one whose professional
career has been spent concerned
with the health of children and
youth. I was appalled at the ir
responsible views of Sen. Alan
Cranston (D-Cal.) published in

Jan. 7 Daily column, condoning
motorcycling without a helmet.
From a position of leadership,
this letter encouraged students
who read the Daily to ride with a
carefree attitude and without a
helmet.
Anyone who has worked
around Stanford Medical Center
has little doubt a major group of
organ donors for the transplanta
tion program comes from young
people fatally injured while rid
ing motorcycles without hel
mets. Every orthopedic surgeon
and neurosurgeon to whom I
have spoken strongly supports
use of helmets.
Even as a daily bicycle com
muter. I have been persuaded to
wear a helmet after giving first
aid on three occasions in four
years to bicyclists seriously in
jured from what should have
been minor head trauma.
There has been substantial
evidence and testimony to the
value of helmets in both motor
cycling and bicycling.
Cranston's desire for more de
finitive evidence as to the value
and request for more reasonable
helmet standards is to me a "cop
out."
It is reminiscent of the 20 or
more years it took to get Con-

gress to recognize the danger of
cigarette smoking, when every
doctor knew that case after case
of lung carcinoma was occurring
in heavy smokers.
I have previously supported
and admired Cranston's moder
ate democratic views, but it mys
tified me to understand his join
ing with so conservative a
senator as James Buckley (C-
N.Y.) to sponsor legislation on
this issue in the name of per
sonal freedom.
It is the same logic which has
prevented us from having a
meaningful gun law. It is preser
vation of personal freedom at a
great personal price for those
who are disabled or die in
motorcycle accidents.
Cranston's column came sadly
enough at a time when Sen. Ed
ward Muskie (D-Me.) was plead
ing with the nation to have faith
in the Democratic party, and to
restore our confidence in politi
cal leader. Yet to me, Cranston's
position defies all logic as either
a parent, leader or statesman;
it seems to be a politically
expedient appeal to the college
youth vote.

In response to the Feb. 11
Daily, 1 would like to take issue
with the views presented there.
Daniel Moynihan was the best
representative the United States
has ever had at the United Na
tions. For once, the Llnited States
was not pushed around by smal
ler nations, especially those of
the third world.
"He (Moynihan) scolded third
world leaders when he should
have listened to them explain
their countries' problems. In
stead of trying to understand the
aspirations of these nations, he
ridiculed them for failing to
acquiesce in American foreign

policy aims."
On the contrary, Moynihan
was only trying to understand
the aspirations of Americans,
and he frustrated third world
leaders because, for once, the
United States failed toacquiesce
in third world foreign policy
aims.
Moynihan was a man who re
fused to buckle under to pres
sure from the third world and
communist countries, although
so many American and Euro
pean leaders hae succumbed in
the past.
He forcefully upheld the
Jewish people in his almost
single-handed battle against the
United Nations anti-Zionism
measure. And he used his veto
power to keep North and South
Vietnam from joining the United
Nations in 1975.
Moynihan was a great asset to
the LJnited States. President
Gerald Ford cannot hope to re
place him with a man of such
force, character and ability.

Students' choice
As Stanford alumni in the
Arecibo, Puerto Rico area, we are
somewhat disappointed by the
administration's lack of en
thusiasm for "Robber Barons" as
the nickname for University
teams (athletic and otherwise).
Although it received only a
plurality in the recent referen
dum, Robber Barons was clearly
the choice of a significant
number of the students. Selec
tion of the Indian many years ago
was handled in no better way.
Robber Barons has a distinc
tiveness and relevance which
Cowboys, Huns, Cardinals,
Trees and Sequoias cannot
match. We believe it should be
given the fair chance the student
vote demands.

and four other
Stanford alumni
Require helmets
As one whose professional
career has been spent concerned
with the health of children and
youth. I was appalled at the ir
responsible views of Sen. Alan
Cranston (D-Cal.) published in

Jan. 7 Daily column, condoning
motorcycling without a helmet.
From a position of leadership,
this letter encouraged students
who read the Daily to ride with a
carefree attitude and without a
helmet.
Anyone who has worked
around Stanford Medical Center
has little doubt a major group of
organ donors for the transplanta
tion program comes from young
people fatally injured while rid
ing motorcycles without hel
mets. Every orthopedic surgeon
and neurosurgeon to whom I
have spoken strongly supports
use of helmets.
Even as a daily bicycle com
muter. I have been persuaded to
wear a helmet after giving first
aid on three occasions in four
years to bicyclists seriously in
jured from what should have
been minor head trauma.
There has been substantial
evidence and testimony to the
value of helmets in both motor
cycling and bicycling.
Cranston's desire for more de
finitive evidence as to the value
and request for more reasonable
helmet standards is to me a "cop
out."
It is reminiscent of the 20 or
more years it took to get Con-

gress to recognize the danger of
cigarette smoking, when every
doctor knew that case after case
of lung carcinoma was occurring
in heavy smokers.
I have previously supported
and admired Cranston's moder
ate democratic views, but it mys
tified me to understand his join
ing with so conservative a
senator as James Buckley (C-
N.Y.) to sponsor legislation on
this issue in the name of per
sonal freedom.
It is the same logic which has
prevented us from having a
meaningful gun law. It is preser
vation of personal freedom at a
great personal price for those
who are disabled or die in
motorcycle accidents.
Cranston's column came sadly
enough at a time when Sen. Ed
ward Muskie (D-Me.) was plead
ing with the nation to have faith
in the Democratic party, and to
restore our confidence in politi
cal leader. Yet to me, Cranston's
position defies all logic as either
a parent, leader or statesman;
it seems to be a politically
expedient appeal to the college
youth vote.

Jerry Lampton's cry to battle,
in his Feb. 17 Daily column,
against the "radical elite" which
"dominated" the selection of
ASSU Guest Professors deserves
a brief response, no more.
First, Lampton asserts the
selection of three Marxists "re
presents a blatant disregard for
the wishes of the overwhelming
majority of students." Who in
Leland's name is he kidding?
How does he know what the
overwhelming majority of stu
dents wish? And where was that
majority the day five members of
the STAND slate were elected to
the ASSU Senate? Off some
where, being satisfied, 1 im
agine.
Second, Lampton calls upon
the administration to block the
ASSU appointment. He claims
the three invited guests won't
benefit those who don't want to
study Marxism (presumably
himself included).
This last claim is true enough,
but Lampton has the alternative
of taking courses from any of the
multitude of professors here
who are more to his political lik
ing. He implies he is satisfied
with that group.
As for those who wish to study
Marxism (and I submit they are
more numerous than Lampton
wants to believe), the alterna
tives are as precious few as are
Marxist instructors at Stanford.
Lampton has missed the more

Students' choice
As Stanford alumni in the
Arecibo, Puerto Rico area, we are
somewhat disappointed by the
administration's lack of en
thusiasm for "Robber Barons" as
the nickname for University
teams (athletic and otherwise).
Although it received only a
plurality in the recent referen
dum, Robber Barons was clearly
the choice of a significant
number of the students. Selec
tion of the Indian many years ago
was handled in no better way.
Robber Barons has a distinc
tiveness and relevance which
Cowboys, Huns, Cardinals,
Trees and Sequoias cannot
match. We believe it should be
given the fair chance the student
vote demands.
Richard Simpson
John Dickey
and four other
Stanford alumni
Require helmets
As one whose professional
career has been spent concerned
with the health of children and
youth. I was appalled at the ir
responsible views of Sen. Alan
Cranston (D-Cal.) published in

Jan. 7 Daily column, condoning
motorcycling without a helmet.
From a position of leadership,
this letter encouraged students
who read the Daily to ride with a
carefree attitude and without a
helmet.
Anyone who has worked
around Stanford Medical Center
has little doubt a major group of
organ donors for the transplanta
tion program comes from young
people fatally injured while rid
ing motorcycles without hel
mets. Every orthopedic surgeon
and neurosurgeon to whom I
have spoken strongly supports
use of helmets.
Even as a daily bicycle com
muter. I have been persuaded to
wear a helmet after giving first
aid on three occasions in four
years to bicyclists seriously in
jured from what should have
been minor head trauma.
There has been substantial
evidence and testimony to the
value of helmets in both motor
cycling and bicycling.
Cranston's desire for more de
finitive evidence as to the value
and request for more reasonable
helmet standards is to me a "cop
out."
It is reminiscent of the 20 or
more years it took to get Con-

gress to recognize the danger of
cigarette smoking, when every
doctor knew that case after case
of lung carcinoma was occurring
in heavy smokers.
I have previously supported
and admired Cranston's moder
ate democratic views, but it mys
tified me to understand his join
ing with so conservative a
senator as James Buckley (C-
N.Y.) to sponsor legislation on
this issue in the name of per
sonal freedom.
It is the same logic which has
prevented us from having a
meaningful gun law. It is preser
vation of personal freedom at a
great personal price for those
who are disabled or die in
motorcycle accidents.
Cranston's column came sadly
enough at a time when Sen. Ed
ward Muskie (D-Me.) was plead
ing with the nation to have faith
in the Democratic party, and to
restore our confidence in politi
cal leader. Yet to me, Cranston's
position defies all logic as either
a parent, leader or statesman;
it seems to be a politically
expedient appeal to the college
youth vote.

Missed bias
Jerry Lampton's cry to battle,
in his Feb. 17 Daily column,
against the "radical elite" which
"dominated" the selection of
ASSU Guest Professors deserves
a brief response, no more.
First, Lampton asserts the
selection of three Marxists "re
presents a blatant disregard for
the wishes of the overwhelming
majority of students." Who in
Leland's name is he kidding?
How does he know what the
overwhelming majority of stu
dents wish? And where was that
majority the day five members of
the STAND slate were elected to
the ASSU Senate? Off some
where, being satisfied, 1 im
agine.
Second, Lampton calls upon
the administration to block the
ASSU appointment. He claims
the three invited guests won't
benefit those who don't want to
study Marxism (presumably
himself included).
This last claim is true enough,
but Lampton has the alternative
of taking courses from any of the
multitude of professors here
who are more to his political lik
ing. He implies he is satisfied
with that group.
As for those who wish to study
Marxism (and I submit they are
more numerous than Lampton
wants to believe), the alterna
tives are as precious few as are
Marxist instructors at Stanford.
Lampton has missed the more
significant bias in this issue.

Moynihan's job
In response to the Feb. 11
Daily, 1 would like to take issue
with the views presented there.
Daniel Moynihan was the best
representative the United States
has ever had at the United Na
tions. For once, the Llnited States
was not pushed around by smal
ler nations, especially those of
the third world.
"He (Moynihan) scolded third
world leaders when he should
have listened to them explain
their countries' problems. In
stead of trying to understand the
aspirations of these nations, he
ridiculed them for failing to
acquiesce in American foreign

policy aims."
On the contrary, Moynihan
was only trying to understand
the aspirations of Americans,
and he frustrated third world
leaders because, for once, the
United States failed toacquiesce
in third world foreign policy
aims.
Moynihan was a man who re
fused to buckle under to pres
sure from the third world and
communist countries, although
so many American and Euro
pean leaders hae succumbed in
the past.
He forcefully upheld the
Jewish people in his almost
single-handed battle against the
United Nations anti-Zionism
measure. And he used his veto
power to keep North and South
Vietnam from joining the United
Nations in 1975.
Moynihan was a great asset to
the LJnited States. President
Gerald Ford cannot hope to re
place him with a man of such
force, character and ability.
