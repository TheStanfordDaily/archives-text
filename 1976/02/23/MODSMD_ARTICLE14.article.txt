# Forum speaker: bill 'repressive'
## Wilkinson criticizes S.1 
### Mike Bailey 
Senate Bill One (S.l) amounts
to a "blueprint for a police state"
but will "probably pass quietly
and smoothly through the Se
nate within two weeks," accord
ing to Frank Wilkinson, execu
tive director of the National
Committee Against Repressive
Legislation.
Keynoting an educational
forum sponsored by the Bay
Area Coalition Against S.l last
Thursday night in Cubberley
Auditorium, Wilkinson warned
a crowd of over 100 of a "liberal
sell-out" in Congress.
He was particularly critical of
liberal Senators Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.) and JohnTunney
(D-Calif.) for leaning towards ac
ceptance of an amended version
of the bill which would not be
thoroughly "cleansed" of rep
ressive features.
"Senate Bill One can still be
stopped," he predicted, "but
only if it is vigorously debated in
the Senate first."
Radical groups
Although the coalition was
primarily organized by radical
groups, including the Alliance
for Radical Change. the
Spartacus Youth League and the
Libertarian party, he adamantly
asserted that most conservative
and moderate groups will also
come out in opposition to the bill
when they learn of its repressive
provisions.
"Give me a Kiwanis club ajid
I'll get you 100 percent opposi
tion to 5.1," claimed Wilkinson,
who delivers most of his
speeches to church groups, local
chambers of commerce and
other community groups.
Calling it the "legislative le
gacy" of the Nixon Administra
tion, he noted that "95 percent"
of the 753-page bill was written
under U.S. Attys.Gen. Mitchell
and Kleindienst.
Criminals
"The essential authors of the
'Criminal Justice Reform Act of
1975'," he reminded the audi
ence, "are now both convicted
criminals." But "anybody trying
to put the whole trip on the Re
publican Party or Richard Ni
xon, simply does not know the

history of repressive legisla
tion," he cautioned.
Wilkinson stated that it would
be impossible to outline all the
problems with S.l in the time
allotted to him, taking the posi
tion that at least 1600 amend
ments would be required to
eliminate all of its repressive fea
tures.
His comments centered on the
most blatant threats to "classical
civil liberties" posed by the bill.
"Twenty-one separate attacks"
on the right of assembly, he said,
"would convert First Amend
ment rights into felonies.
Official secrets
He further asserted that other
parts of S.l are "aimed at estab
lishing official secrets acts." The
criteria for classifying informa
tion are "so loosely defined" that
certain provisions of S.l could
be used to "cover up . . . any
thing you could imagine."
Other groups participating in
the Bay Area Coalition Against

S.l included Gunn High School
Students for Increased Political
and Social Awareness, Law Stu
dents Civil Rights Research
Council, Menlo Park Law Com
mune, Palo Alto Tenants Union,
Prison Information Center, S.F.
Prisoners Union, Stanford Na
tional Lawyers Guild, the Stan
ford Daily, Stanford Women's
Center and Women's Interna
tional League for Peace.
Only the Spartacus Youth
League, however, had a rep
resentative give an official
statement following Wilkinson's
speech. The league, he said, sees
S.l as "primarily directed
against leftists, blacks and radi
cals" and regards it as "no acci
dent that liberals are bringing us
this bill," since they are "not
'selling-out,' but reflecting their
own interests."
Wilkinson disagreed with this
analysis, pointing out the oppos
ition of over 400 liberal and con
servative newspapers to S.l.

Radical groups
Although the coalition was
primarily organized by radical
groups, including the Alliance
for Radical Change. the
Spartacus Youth League and the
Libertarian party, he adamantly
asserted that most conservative
and moderate groups will also
come out in opposition to the bill
when they learn of its repressive
provisions.
"Give me a Kiwanis club ajid
I'll get you 100 percent opposi
tion to 5.1," claimed Wilkinson,
who delivers most of his
speeches to church groups, local
chambers of commerce and
other community groups.
Calling it the "legislative le
gacy" of the Nixon Administra
tion, he noted that "95 percent"
of the 753-page bill was written
under U.S. Attys.Gen. Mitchell
and Kleindienst.
Criminals
"The essential authors of the
'Criminal Justice Reform Act of
1975'," he reminded the audi
ence, "are now both convicted
criminals." But "anybody trying
to put the whole trip on the Re
publican Party or Richard Ni
xon, simply does not know the

history of repressive legisla
tion," he cautioned.
Wilkinson stated that it would
be impossible to outline all the
problems with S.l in the time
allotted to him, taking the posi
tion that at least 1600 amend
ments would be required to
eliminate all of its repressive fea
tures.
His comments centered on the
most blatant threats to "classical
civil liberties" posed by the bill.
"Twenty-one separate attacks"
on the right of assembly, he said,
"would convert First Amend
ment rights into felonies.
Official secrets
He further asserted that other
parts of S.l are "aimed at estab
lishing official secrets acts." The
criteria for classifying informa
tion are "so loosely defined" that
certain provisions of S.l could
be used to "cover up . . . any
thing you could imagine."
Other groups participating in
the Bay Area Coalition Against

S.l included Gunn High School
Students for Increased Political
and Social Awareness, Law Stu
dents Civil Rights Research
Council, Menlo Park Law Com
mune, Palo Alto Tenants Union,
Prison Information Center, S.F.
Prisoners Union, Stanford Na
tional Lawyers Guild, the Stan
ford Daily, Stanford Women's
Center and Women's Interna
tional League for Peace.
Only the Spartacus Youth
League, however, had a rep
resentative give an official
statement following Wilkinson's
speech. The league, he said, sees
S.l as "primarily directed
against leftists, blacks and radi
cals" and regards it as "no acci
dent that liberals are bringing us
this bill," since they are "not
'selling-out,' but reflecting their
own interests."
Wilkinson disagreed with this
analysis, pointing out the oppos
ition of over 400 liberal and con
servative newspapers to S.l.

Senate Bill One (S.l) amounts
to a "blueprint for a police state"
but will "probably pass quietly
and smoothly through the Se
nate within two weeks," accord
ing to Frank Wilkinson, execu
tive director of the National
Committee Against Repressive
Legislation.
Keynoting an educational
forum sponsored by the Bay
Area Coalition Against S.l last
Thursday night in Cubberley
Auditorium, Wilkinson warned
a crowd of over 100 of a "liberal
sell-out" in Congress.
He was particularly critical of
liberal Senators Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.) and JohnTunney
(D-Calif.) for leaning towards ac
ceptance of an amended version
of the bill which would not be
thoroughly "cleansed" of rep
ressive features.
"Senate Bill One can still be
stopped," he predicted, "but
only if it is vigorously debated in
the Senate first."
