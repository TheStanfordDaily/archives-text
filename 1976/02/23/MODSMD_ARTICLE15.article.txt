# Federal 'cure' worse than disease
## Ignorance surrounds sickle cell anemia 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (FNS) — Fear and discrimina
tion have been the legacies of a four-year federal
campaign against sickle cell anemia, according
to an increasing number of medical experts.
The federal screening program, founded on
the mistaken premise that millions of black
Americans suffer from sickle cell anemia, has
convinced thousands of healthy people they
have the disease. The results have been needless
anxiety and greater obstacles for blacks in ob
taining health insurance and finding jobs.
The problem stems from a basic misun
derstanding of the characteristics and preva
lence of sickle cell anemia, a hereditary blood
disease which destroys the victim's hemoglo
bin, lowering the oxygen level of the blood.
'Crises'
This disease results in"sickle cell crises' when
the circulation is blocked by blood clots at the
joints and abdomen. No cure is known, although
the crises can be treated.
The disease afflicts two million Americans,
declared a congressional summary in passing
the 1972 Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act.
In fact, only about 50,000 Americans —most,
but not all, blacks — suffer from the disease. Far
more common is the occurrence of the genetic
trait of sickle cell anemia in otherwise healthy
people.
These people —-roughly 2.5 million in the

U.S. — never suffer from the disease itself; their
only handicap is the possibility of producing the
disease in their offspring.
Shocking number
Yet a shocking number of government agen
cies, businesses and members of the medical
profession are unable to distinguish between
those suffering from the disease and those carry
ing the genetic trail. •
In 1972, the Air Force, on the advice of the
National Academy of Sciences, began rejecting
all black pilot trainees who had the trait on the
grounds that they might black out from oxygen
deficiency during flight operations, even
though there had been no problems with black
fliers trained since World War II before testing
was begun.
In 1973, the Air Force Academy discharged a
black cadet when he was discovered to have the
genetic trait.
Higher premiums
According to a survey by the New York Health
Commission, 13 major life insurance com
panies, including Allstate, Continental Casualty
and John Hancock, charged trait carriers a
higher premium.
Only one state, North Carolina, has enacted a
measure banning discrimination against trait
carriers — and did so over the strong objections
of North Carolina Mutual, one of the nation's

largest black-owned insurance companies.
The Journal of the American Medical Associa
tion reported in 1974 that a survey of 633 doc
tors in Southern California revealed that 21 per
cent could not distinguish between the disease
and the trait.
"We've seen more people than I would like to
think about who've been improperly tested or
their results inaccurately interpreted," said
Melody Lee, program director for Sickle Cell
Anemia Research and Education.
Two cities
San Francisco is one of the two cities — Bos
ton the other — with an adequate prenatal test
ing program to determine if an unborn child will
have the disease. Elsewhere, parents are forced
to rely on a system known as"genetic counsel
ing," which is testing based on the couple's an
cestral medical history.
Statistically, two parents who each have the
sickle cell trait stand a 25 percent chance of
producing a child with the actual disease and a
25 percent chance of producing a child free of
both the disease and the trait.
But, according to Dr. Lonnie Bristow, a black
internist in San Pablo, Calif., the genetic coun
selors often suggest that the only way for
couples to make sure they don't have a sickle cell
baby is to avoid having children.
And, he added, this is not the advice given to

diabetics who are in a similar situation.
Dr. Bristow was one of the first members of his
profession to oppose the counseling program.
Anti-black?
"Knowledgeable people knew it was a poor
approach, but didn't want to stick their necks
out," he recalls. "No one stood up to say 'no' for
fear of being called anti-black."
Bristow said counseling causes fear and frust
ration without providing a cure. "With sickle
cell, or any other genetically linked illness, we
must offer patients a positive treatment beyond
counseling" he says.
Ironically, any treatment is now farther away
than ever. The $115 million authorized for re
search, testing and treatment in the 1972 bill
never left the Treasury. Sen. Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.) tried in vain to renew the Sickle
Cell Act before it expired in June 1975.
Any further money from Congress will come
through the National Heart and Lung Institute
under the general heading of genetic research.
The shifting of attention away from sickle cell
anemia may be a blessing in disguise. As one
West Coast physician commented, "The
economic and social hardships that sickle cell
anemia programs have caused the black com
munity are worse than the overall impact of the
disease."

largest black-owned insurance companies.
The Journal of the American Medical Associa
tion reported in 1974 that a survey of 633 doc
tors in Southern California revealed that 21 per
cent could not distinguish between the disease
and the trait.
"We've seen more people than I would like to
think about who've been improperly tested or
their results inaccurately interpreted," said
Melody Lee, program director for Sickle Cell
Anemia Research and Education.
Two cities
San Francisco is one of the two cities — Bos
ton the other — with an adequate prenatal test
ing program to determine if an unborn child will
have the disease. Elsewhere, parents are forced
to rely on a system known as"genetic counsel
ing," which is testing based on the couple's an
cestral medical history.
Statistically, two parents who each have the
sickle cell trait stand a 25 percent chance of
producing a child with the actual disease and a
25 percent chance of producing a child free of
both the disease and the trait.
But, according to Dr. Lonnie Bristow, a black
internist in San Pablo, Calif., the genetic coun
selors often suggest that the only way for
couples to make sure they don't have a sickle cell
baby is to avoid having children.
And, he added, this is not the advice given to

diabetics who are in a similar situation.
Dr. Bristow was one of the first members of his
profession to oppose the counseling program.
Anti-black?
"Knowledgeable people knew it was a poor
approach, but didn't want to stick their necks
out," he recalls. "No one stood up to say 'no' for
fear of being called anti-black."
Bristow said counseling causes fear and frust
ration without providing a cure. "With sickle
cell, or any other genetically linked illness, we
must offer patients a positive treatment beyond
counseling" he says.
Ironically, any treatment is now farther away
than ever. The $115 million authorized for re
search, testing and treatment in the 1972 bill
never left the Treasury. Sen. Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.) tried in vain to renew the Sickle
Cell Act before it expired in June 1975.
Any further money from Congress will come
through the National Heart and Lung Institute
under the general heading of genetic research.
The shifting of attention away from sickle cell
anemia may be a blessing in disguise. As one
West Coast physician commented, "The
economic and social hardships that sickle cell
anemia programs have caused the black com
munity are worse than the overall impact of the
disease."
SAN FRANCISCO (FNS) — Fear and discrimina
tion have been the legacies of a four-year federal
campaign against sickle cell anemia, according
to an increasing number of medical experts.
The federal screening program, founded on
the mistaken premise that millions of black
Americans suffer from sickle cell anemia, has
convinced thousands of healthy people they
have the disease. The results have been needless
anxiety and greater obstacles for blacks in ob
taining health insurance and finding jobs.
The problem stems from a basic misun
derstanding of the characteristics and preva
lence of sickle cell anemia, a hereditary blood
disease which destroys the victim's hemoglo
bin, lowering the oxygen level of the blood.
'Crises'
This disease results in"sickle cell crises' when
the circulation is blocked by blood clots at the
joints and abdomen. No cure is known, although
the crises can be treated.
The disease afflicts two million Americans,
declared a congressional summary in passing
the 1972 Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act.
In fact, only about 50,000 Americans —most,
but not all, blacks — suffer from the disease. Far
more common is the occurrence of the genetic
trait of sickle cell anemia in otherwise healthy
people.
These people —-roughly 2.5 million in the

U.S. — never suffer from the disease itself; their
only handicap is the possibility of producing the
disease in their offspring.
Shocking number
Yet a shocking number of government agen
cies, businesses and members of the medical
profession are unable to distinguish between
those suffering from the disease and those carry
ing the genetic trail. •
In 1972, the Air Force, on the advice of the
National Academy of Sciences, began rejecting
all black pilot trainees who had the trait on the
grounds that they might black out from oxygen
deficiency during flight operations, even
though there had been no problems with black
fliers trained since World War II before testing
was begun.
In 1973, the Air Force Academy discharged a
black cadet when he was discovered to have the
genetic trait.
Higher premiums
According to a survey by the New York Health
Commission, 13 major life insurance com
panies, including Allstate, Continental Casualty
and John Hancock, charged trait carriers a
higher premium.
Only one state, North Carolina, has enacted a
measure banning discrimination against trait
carriers — and did so over the strong objections
of North Carolina Mutual, one of the nation's

largest black-owned insurance companies.

West Coast physician commented, "The
economic and social hardships that sickle cell
anemia programs have caused the black com
munity are worse than the overall impact of the
disease."
SAN FRANCISCO (FNS) — Fear and discrimina
tion have been the legacies of a four-year federal
campaign against sickle cell anemia, according
to an increasing number of medical experts.
The federal screening program, founded on
the mistaken premise that millions of black
Americans suffer from sickle cell anemia, has
convinced thousands of healthy people they
have the disease. The results have been needless
anxiety and greater obstacles for blacks in ob
taining health insurance and finding jobs.
The problem stems from a basic misun
derstanding of the characteristics and preva
lence of sickle cell anemia, a hereditary blood
disease which destroys the victim's hemoglo
bin, lowering the oxygen level of the blood.
'Crises'
This disease results in"sickle cell crises' when
the circulation is blocked by blood clots at the
joints and abdomen. No cure is known, although
the crises can be treated.
The disease afflicts two million Americans,
declared a congressional summary in passing
the 1972 Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act.
In fact, only about 50,000 Americans —most,
but not all, blacks — suffer from the disease. Far
more common is the occurrence of the genetic
trait of sickle cell anemia in otherwise healthy
people.
These people —-roughly 2.5 million in the

U.S. — never suffer from the disease itself; their
only handicap is the possibility of producing the
disease in their offspring.
Shocking number
Yet a shocking number of government agen
cies, businesses and members of the medical
profession are unable to distinguish between
those suffering from the disease and those carry
ing the genetic trail. •
In 1972, the Air Force, on the advice of the
National Academy of Sciences, began rejecting
all black pilot trainees who had the trait on the
grounds that they might black out from oxygen
deficiency during flight operations, even
though there had been no problems with black
fliers trained since World War II before testing
was begun.
In 1973, the Air Force Academy discharged a
black cadet when he was discovered to have the
genetic trait.
Higher premiums
According to a survey by the New York Health
Commission, 13 major life insurance com
panies, including Allstate, Continental Casualty
and John Hancock, charged trait carriers a
higher premium.
Only one state, North Carolina, has enacted a
measure banning discrimination against trait
carriers — and did so over the strong objections
of North Carolina Mutual, one of the nation's

largest black-owned insurance companies.
The Journal of the American Medical Associa
tion reported in 1974 that a survey of 633 doc
tors in Southern California revealed that 21 per
cent could not distinguish between the disease
and the trait.
"We've seen more people than I would like to
think about who've been improperly tested or
their results inaccurately interpreted," said
Melody Lee, program director for Sickle Cell
Anemia Research and Education.
Two cities
San Francisco is one of the two cities — Bos
ton the other — with an adequate prenatal test
ing program to determine if an unborn child will
have the disease. Elsewhere, parents are forced
to rely on a system known as"genetic counsel
ing," which is testing based on the couple's an
cestral medical history.
Statistically, two parents who each have the
sickle cell trait stand a 25 percent chance of
producing a child with the actual disease and a
25 percent chance of producing a child free of
both the disease and the trait.
But, according to Dr. Lonnie Bristow, a black
internist in San Pablo, Calif., the genetic coun
selors often suggest that the only way for
couples to make sure they don't have a sickle cell
baby is to avoid having children.
And, he added, this is not the advice given to

diabetics who are in a similar situation.
Dr. Bristow was one of the first members of his
profession to oppose the counseling program.
Anti-black?
"Knowledgeable people knew it was a poor
approach, but didn't want to stick their necks
out," he recalls. "No one stood up to say 'no' for
fear of being called anti-black."
Bristow said counseling causes fear and frust
ration without providing a cure. "With sickle
cell, or any other genetically linked illness, we
must offer patients a positive treatment beyond
counseling" he says.
Ironically, any treatment is now farther away
than ever. The $115 million authorized for re
search, testing and treatment in the 1972 bill
never left the Treasury. Sen. Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.) tried in vain to renew the Sickle
Cell Act before it expired in June 1975.
Any further money from Congress will come
through the National Heart and Lung Institute
under the general heading of genetic research.
The shifting of attention away from sickle cell
anemia may be a blessing in disguise. As one
West Coast physician commented, "The
economic and social hardships that sickle cell
anemia programs have caused the black com
munity are worse than the overall impact of the
disease."
