Following is a copy of a report on "Placement Services
Policy Recommendations" sent to Stanford President
Richard W. Lyman Feb. 11, 1976 by the Committee on
Services to Students. Deans of the seven schools, Career
Planning and Placement Center Director Ralph Keller, and
other officers directly affected will be asked to send any
comments they may have on the recommendations to James
Lyons, dean of student affairs. He will forward these,
together with his own recommendations, to Lyman before
the President acts on the report.
/. Summary of Current Placement Services Philo
sophies
The keystone of the philosophy of career planning and
placement services at Stanford is student centeredness. These
services exist to respond primarily to the expressed needs of
individual students.
To the extent that those needs are served well the
University is also benefited. The programs of individual
schools or departments are undoubtedly more enticing when
their students have good job opportunities to choose from
and when the students make wise and informed choices.
Other secondary beneficiaries of a good career planning
and placement program are alumni, who can make continued
use of the several placement services on campus. They are
served better by an active and well-organized program.
However, the primary efforts of the career planning and
placement services of Stanford are directed toward the career
planning and placement needs of the individual student.
There are some objectives that are not associated with
career planning and placement services at Stanford. The
University has in recent years avoided applying political or
social tests in the career information or placement processes,
except when mandated to do so by law.
(No one, including CPPC Director Ralph Keller, has been
able to inform the Committee of practices preceeding the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its interpretation by the courts
and applications by the Government.)
Nor are our services run for the primary benefit of,
industry, governmental agencies, schools and colleges, or
other social institutions. If such groups happen to be well
served by Stanford's career planning and placement services,
it is because of a congruence of need or interest with the
group primarily served-the students.
The career planning and placement services have resisted
occasional attempts to be used as explicit instruments of
social change. Many students will consider a wide variety of
career options during their time at Stanford, a process which
will often lead them to discover a number of unimagined
alternatives and ultimately the rejection of more alternatives
than are kept as "live" options.
This is an educationally useful process, but one which
requires free access to many choices; an access unmarrcd by
political tests, censured career libraries, or by a list of firms
that are "forbidden at Stanford" for reasons of contrariness
to some political or social philosophy dominating career and
recruiting facibties at Stanford.
In short, Stanford's career planning and placement facili
ties have tried to maximize students' choices, not limit them;
and to help the individual student to make choices rather
than to choose for the student by elimination of lawful but
unpopular choice alternatives.
The University advocates the exercise of informed choice,
of the use of the intellect in the proccss of choosing an area
of employment or a particular employer. Our career planning
activities, therefore, are aimed towards helping students
discover and weigh information about areas of employment
and particular employers and to help them identify and relate
their own needs and interests to this information.
The University is also committed to helping students and
potential employers identify and distinguish between infor
mation which is job-related and that which is not.
We can and should help employers and potential em
ployees provide each other with information to help assess
predicted job performance and job expectations, and discour
age the use of information that transcends the boundaries of
job-relatedness and intrudes into areas of privacy and person
al circumstance.
Information that is usually suspect of being not job-re
lated is often associated with race, national origin, religion,
sex, sexual preferences and activities, marital status, political
and social beliefs, certain specific medical conditions, and
family background.
If employers seek such information from candidates, or
use such information if otherwise discoVered, Stanford stu
dents should reasonably expect employers to be open about
such use, to explain the job-relatedness of such information,
and to be clear and open about the criteria they will use in
hiring and promotion.
11. A Positive Commitment for the University and
Employers
(Approved unanimously)
The Gay People's Union at Stanford has emphasized that
homosexual students have comc to fear invidious discrimina
tion in the employment process. This fear is dehumanizing
and may be a significant handicap in the job-seeking process.
In recent years employers have comc to recognize the
need for full, precise, and open job descriptions. A growing
number of employers have realized that many personal
characteristics previously assumed to be job-related arc not.
We believe that students should be able to know if
companies regard personal characteristics which are usually
regarded as private, such as religion, sexual preference, or
political belief, to be job-related, and thus form a basis for
hiring, work assignment, and promotions. We also believe
that students should know if companies have or do not have
specific policies about such matters, and if so, what those
policies arc. (See Section III)
Our several career planning and placement services should
find ways that will encourage recruiting organizations to be
sensitive to such matters if they are not so already, and to
establish policies that make clear employee selection criteria
as they pertain to personal characteristics.
Wc therefore recommend:
I. That a statement by the University similar to the
following be included in communications with potential

recruiters using our facilities. "Though not compelled by
law, Stanford University wishes to avoid discrimination
on the basis of sexual preference in its own promotion
and hiring policies and urges employers using our facilities
to follow similar practices."
(The Committee believed that Stanford should assess its
own employment policies regarding homosexuals. It is
however, beyond the purview of our committee to deter
mine what that explicit and expressed policy should be.)
2. that steps be taken to involve homosexual students
and staff directly in the career planning and placement
processes and enlist their help in Finding more effective
ways for employers and applicants to deal with the feeling
invoked by the term "homosexual" when it arises in the
selections proccss.
///. A Statement of Policy from Employers
(Approved by a vote of 6 to 1 with 2 absent)
We recommend that employers using University facilities
be required to answer the question, "In your hiring and
promotion policies and practices do you discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation?"
The Committee was split on the issue of whether to
encourage or to require employers to respond to the above
question. The dissenting member accepted this section where
such a question would be encouraged rather than required.
Also, deans of some schools may feel that the proper way to
get at the spirit of this issue is through a different phrasing. If
so, wc ask the suggested changes or revisions be presented to
the Dean of Student Affairs.)
Requiring employers to answer the above question is
consistent with the philosophy underlying career placement
at Stanford. The University believes that students should be
precisely informed about all policies which might affect their
interests, in order that they can adequately judge with whom
they should seek employment.
The simplest way for students to receive employment
related information of concern to them is by asking an
interviewer directly. Students can ask interviewers questions
concerning most aspects of employment without adversely
affecting their job placement prospects.
With regard to sexual orientation however, students
making inquiries are likely to be perceived by the inter
viewers as being homosexual, which may prejudice their
employment. Being justificably afraid of jeopardizing their
job-placement chances, few gay students are willing to breach
the subject of sexual orientation with prospective employers.
In addition, some of Stanford's gay graduates may un
knowingly begin their careers in organizations whose policies
and practices are repugnant to their own. Requiring employ
ment statements to promote full employment disclosure
concerning sexual orientation would be an important step
toward a remedy.
Students who are not gay would also benefit from the
procedure this committee has called for. Many students,
while not themselves injured by discrimination on the basis
of sexual preference, morally object to hiring and advance
ment criteria not related to job performance.
Employers' statements concerning sexual orientation in
hiring and promotion will provide all students with useful
information concerning what different organizations consider
to be important.
The Committee does not believe that requesting em
ployers' statements would provide a panacea for discrimina
tion on the basis of sexual preference. Many employers will
claim that they do not discriminate, whereas in fact they do;
many Stanford graduates will remain "closet homosexuals"
regardless of employment prospects, for social and family
reasons.
Nevertheless, the procedure our committee has called for
will assist some Stanford students in contributing to the
limits of their capacities without fear that their sexual
preference will hinder them. At the very least, adoption of
this proposal will demonstrate that Stanford is willing to take
a substantial step towards helping its students make truly free
and informed choices.
IV. Section A: Employers Who Do Discriminate
Should Be Banned
(The Committee was exactly split on the issue of whether
to ban employers who discriminated on the basis of sexual
preference from using Stanford facilities.
(Despite our inability to agree on a specific recommendat
ion, we have presented the arguments on both sides of the
issue. See Section IVB. This project was to some extent to
foster greater discussion of these issues. Our arguments may
also benefit future study on this or similar issues.
(Vote: 3 for section IVA, 3 for section IVB, I abstention,
I absent.)
Position A: We believe that Stanford University has an
oblijption to deny use of its placement facilities to employers
who discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.
Such discrimination is abhorrent to gay students, faculty,
and staff, as well as to many other members of the University
community. If the University does not bar such employers, it
is in effect acceding to a policy of cruel and debilitating
discrimination directed against some of its more vulnerable
students.
Stanford should not permit itself to be used to perpetuate
discrimination against gay persons. Discrimination on the
basis of sexual preference seems to us, in principle, equivalent
to discrimination on the basis of religion, sex, and color. In
each case, such discrimination is based usually on invidious
distinctions and denies to substantial numbers equal opportu
nity and, often, humane treatment.
Opponents of our recommendation for a change in policy
have raised various principled objections, and the more
important arguments are reducible to two:
The first is that the University has barred employers who
discriminate on the basis of religion, sex, and color only
because of federal law; that the present case reaches beyond
the requirement of the law to have the University promote
social values; and that the University should not seek to act
to promote social values.
The second is that the University should allow students
free choice to make their own decisions (e.g., whether or not
to interview with a discriminatory firm) because the exercise

of such choice contributes significantly to education.
These arguments seem dubious, neglect important pre
cendents, and rest often, at critical junctures, upon incorrect
assumptions about the activities of the University.
Let us first address the "promoting social value" objec
tion. We believe that the University has acted, and has often
sought to act, in many important ways that promote partic
ular social values-whether to maintain or alter the society.
Probably no institution, by its decisions and actions, can
avoid influencing values and promoting or altering them;
certainly, that is dramatically true in the case of a major
institution such as Stanford, which has considerable impact
upon various groups and localities by its decisions on, for
example, land use, investment policies, and admissions poli
cies.
Whether Stanford decides to rent land to the highest
bidder and/or to support low-cost housing for some disadvan
taged peoples, the University is, intentionally or not, pro
moting certain social values. In some notable cases, including
recent efforts for low-cost housing, the University formulated
policy with the explicit intention of promoting particular
social values.
Let us look briefly at the area of admissions policy for
additional evidence on this matter. In the past eight to 10
years, for various social reasons, the University has chosen, at
times, to increase the number of minority students in the
student body.
Such decisions for preferential admissions were based,
often self-consciously, upon larger social considerations: the
duties of a University to the society; the need to provide
greater opportunity to members of some racial minorities;
the desirability of promoting racial integration and of stifling
social disruptions. Such commitments were not required by
law, and they marked a departure from Stanford's earlier
policies.
We cite these changes in admissions policies to establish
the proposition that the University has acted, in important
matters, without the requirement of law to promote particu
lar social values.
In actual practices, of course, the University promotes
values in other more subtle and possibly more fundamental
ways. Consider, for example, the University's commitment to
a business school or a law school. Such a major financial
commitment assumes 'hat "doing" law or business is desir
able, that it promotes desirable social values, and that it
usually serves both the society and the individual.
In turn, obviously, the establishment of schools of revolu
tion would be unlikely (though legal), for they would
promote undesirable values. The critical difference is not
whether the University intends to promote social values but
which ones it seeks to promote.
Let us address the "free choice" objection. We do not
deny that some educational value does inhere sometimes,
perhaps even most times, in free choice itself, for the fact of
free choice may compel reflection and lead to judicious
action. But often the small increment of value may be
outweighed by the great harm of particular decisions. For
example, selection of the Indian symbol, so offensive to
native Americans, is one example of possible harm outweigh
ing the benefit of choice.
The administration wisely decided to eliminate the Indian
symbol because it offended native Americans. Under the
Committee's minority contention, which we reject, it would
seem to follow that the administration should not have taken
such action. Instead, as we understand their logic, each team,
or class, or appropriate group should make a new decision
about the Indian symbol because there will be greater
educational value in this exercise of free choice.
A closer analogy to the case before us might be the
imposition of educational area distribution requirements.
These educational requirements do restrict free choice by
compelling students to take some courses in areas that they
might otherwise disregard or avoid. In most cases, it appears,
students benefit educationally from these requirements, even
though they do not experience the real possibility of free
choice.
The proposed ban of employers who discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation might operate in roughly analo
gous fashion for students. They arc not being denied the
opportunity to seek interviews with these employers. Instead,
students will have to think carefully about the situation and
then make individual arrangements with such employers.
Perhaps this small difficulty will inspire students to think
very carefully about the exercise of their choice-a goal that
the "free choice" advocates seek to achieve and that wc
endorse.
We do not believe that the proposed change in policy will
bar many employers or significantly affect job opportunities
for students. Ten years ago, and maybe even two or three
years ago, most major employers might have been unwilling
or unable to agree to a policy of nondiscrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation.
Recent declarations by AT &. T and other major firms
indicate a shift in values and standards, and wc anticipate a
continuation of this trend. Our policy, in most cases, will
simply speed the trend.
Reccnt decisions by the military services indicate, unless
there is a reversal of these decisions by the administration or
the courts, that the American military may be the notable
exception. There is some likelikhood that it may revise policy
in the next decade, but we do not foresee a reversal in the
next few years.
Since federal regulations do not allow some federal
agencies (NASA, DOD, and FRDA, among others) to con
tract with universities that ban military recruiting, and our
proposed policy would have the effect of banning such
recruiting, the University would lose some contracts and
(according to Frank Riddle) about $4.75 million in unrestric
ted funds.
We could uneasily countenance the loss of these funds
and would urge the President to act in the moral merits of
the issues without consideration of the financial problems.
Such counsel may be easier to give than to receive, and wc
recognize that it is unlikely that the President will be willing
to take such action and to plunge the University more deeply
into annual deficits at this time.

As a result, we suggest an uneasy, but not altogether
unsatisfactory compromise. If the main objection to our
proposed policy is that it cannot be imposed on the military
because of the great financial cost, why not be explicit about
this objection and impose the policy in those other areas
where the likely financial cost is nonexistent or minimal''
Such a decision by the University would be a useful
admission that the University, whatever its commitment to
humane values, must operate in an arena of realism where
financial considerations heavily influence policy and choice.
We may regret the fact of such pressures, but we do not
believe that universities arc free.
IV. Section B. Employers Who Discriminate Should
Not Be Banned
(For vote, see Sec. IVA, above)
Stanford's career planning and placement services exist to
respond to the expressed needs of individual students. Uni
versity placement facilities are therefore made available to
any student who wishes to see any prospective employer. The
only valid exceptions are those based upon sound academic
reason or legal requirement. (See Dean Thomas Ehrlich's
memorandum, Oct. 28, 1975).
The Gay People's Union proposal meets neither criterion,
yet they have asked the University to impose the CPU's
moral judgment on all students using the career information
service. Indeed, the University has judiciously avoided
applying any political, moral, or social test to the CPPC.
To the extent that the career planning and placement
service hopes to respond to the expressed needs of each
student it can never succumb to the will of a minority or to
the tyranny of the majority. Every student must be guaran
teed access to the CPPC; information concerning any business
must be made available to him or her.
The University is obligated to safeguard the right of each
student to make and exercise moral decisions. (It is unjust to
members of the Stanford community to deny them access to
job opportunities without their consent. Certainly, the CPU's
hope is to influence firms by denying them access to
Stanford students; the same result, however, can be achieved
by each Stanford student voluntarily deciding not to seek
employment with a discriminating firm.)
If the goal of the GPU is to protect its members from
malicious and discriminatory hiring, then it should seek the
dissemination of information on hiring and promotion poli
cies. By requiring the firms to make this information freely
available, each student can decide whether to seek employ
ment with a firm that may or may not claim to discriminate.
The proposed exclusion of firms that discriminate on the
basis of sexual preferences or affection would retard the
honest relay of information.
Since no statistical check exists through which a firm's
actual hiring and promotion policies can be evaluated, and
the penalties for claiming to discriminate are so high, good
financial incentives exist for employers to transmit informa
tion less than honestly.
If the goal of the CPU's request, however, is to influence
social mores through utilization of a service to students, then
they infringe on the rights of other students to make moral
decisions. Students would then have their moral actions
heavily influenced by University policy. No matter that we
agree with the moral judgment; we disagree with the direct
consequences of the advocated policy: the denial of each
student's freedom to make his own moral selections.
Sexual preference or affection should not be considered
within the same context as race, color, religion, sex, and
national origin as advocated by the GPU. This listing is used
to demark minority populations; positive employment pro
grams are created for minority communities defined by race,
color, religion, sex, and national origin. It is to the disadvan
tage of existing minority populations to expand the list.
The precedent set by linking sexual preference or affec
tion to race, color, religion, sex, and national origin could, in
time, lead to efforts to establish affirmative action policies
for gay people.
There exist two additional interesting, albeit not compel
ling, reasons not to ban sexually discriminating firms from
the CPPC:
First, the labor market conditions that allow discrimina
tion against gay people arc identical to the conditions
necessary for discrimination against minorities; the problem
lies in lack of free-market competition. Enforcement of the
GPU request would limit the number of interviewing firms at
Stanford. Unfortunately any reduction in the number of
interviewing firms most directly harms the minority appli
cant.
Second, an inevitable consequence of enforcement of the
proposed ban is to remove military recruiting from Stanford.
The dire consequences of this are delineated in I rank
Riddle's memo of Dec. 5, 1975. (See Sec. / VA, above)

institution such as Stanford, which has considerable impact
upon various groups and localities by its decisions on, for
example, land use, investment policies, and admissions poli
cies.
Whether Stanford decides to rent land to the highest
bidder and/or to support low-cost housing for some disadvan
taged peoples, the University is, intentionally or not, pro
moting certain social values. In some notable cases, including
recent efforts for low-cost housing, the University formulated
policy with the explicit intention of promoting particular
social values.
Let us look briefly at the area of admissions policy for
additional evidence on this matter. In the past eight to 10
years, for various social reasons, the University has chosen, at
times, to increase the number of minority students in the
student body.
Such decisions for preferential admissions were based,
often self-consciously, upon larger social considerations: the
duties of a University to the society; the need to provide
greater opportunity to members of some racial minorities;
the desirability of promoting racial integration and of stifling
social disruptions. Such commitments were not required by
law, and they marked a departure from Stanford's earlier
policies.
We cite these changes in admissions policies to establish
the proposition that the University has acted, in important
matters, without the requirement of law to promote particu
lar social values.
In actual practices, of course, the University promotes
values in other more subtle and possibly more fundamental
ways. Consider, for example, the University's commitment to
a business school or a law school. Such a major financial
commitment assumes 'hat "doing" law or business is desir
able, that it promotes desirable social values, and that it
usually serves both the society and the individual.
In turn, obviously, the establishment of schools of revolu
tion would be unlikely (though legal), for they would
promote undesirable values. The critical difference is not
whether the University intends to promote social values but
which ones it seeks to promote.
Let us address the "free choice" objection. We do not
deny that some educational value does inhere sometimes,
perhaps even most times, in free choice itself, for the fact of
free choice may compel reflection and lead to judicious
action. But often the small increment of value may be
outweighed by the great harm of particular decisions. For
example, selection of the Indian symbol, so offensive to
native Americans, is one example of possible harm outweigh
ing the benefit of choice.
The administration wisely decided to eliminate the Indian
symbol because it offended native Americans. Under the
Committee's minority contention, which we reject, it would
seem to follow that the administration should not have taken
such action. Instead, as we understand their logic, each team,
or class, or appropriate group should make a new decision
about the Indian symbol because there will be greater
educational value in this exercise of free choice.
A closer analogy to the case before us might be the
imposition of educational area distribution requirements.
These educational requirements do restrict free choice by
compelling students to take some courses in areas that they
might otherwise disregard or avoid. In most cases, it appears,
students benefit educationally from these requirements, even
though they do not experience the real possibility of free
choice.
The proposed ban of employers who discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation might operate in roughly analo
gous fashion for students. They arc not being denied the
opportunity to seek interviews with these employers. Instead,
students will have to think carefully about the situation and
then make individual arrangements with such employers.
Perhaps this small difficulty will inspire students to think
very carefully about the exercise of their choice-a goal that
the "free choice" advocates seek to achieve and that wc
endorse.
We do not believe that the proposed change in policy will
bar many employers or significantly affect job opportunities
for students. Ten years ago, and maybe even two or three
years ago, most major employers might have been unwilling
or unable to agree to a policy of nondiscrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation.
Recent declarations by AT &. T and other major firms
indicate a shift in values and standards, and wc anticipate a
continuation of this trend. Our policy, in most cases, will
simply speed the trend.
Reccnt decisions by the military services indicate, unless
there is a reversal of these decisions by the administration or
the courts, that the American military may be the notable
exception. There is some likelikhood that it may revise policy
in the next decade, but we do not foresee a reversal in the
next few years.
Since federal regulations do not allow some federal
agencies (NASA, DOD, and FRDA, among others) to con
tract with universities that ban military recruiting, and our
proposed policy would have the effect of banning such
recruiting, the University would lose some contracts and
(according to Frank Riddle) about $4.75 million in unrestric
ted funds.
We could uneasily countenance the loss of these funds
and would urge the President to act in the moral merits of
the issues without consideration of the financial problems.
Such counsel may be easier to give than to receive, and wc
recognize that it is unlikely that the President will be willing
to take such action and to plunge the University more deeply
into annual deficits at this time.

As a result, we suggest an uneasy, but not altogether
unsatisfactory compromise. If the main objection to our
proposed policy is that it cannot be imposed on the military
because of the great financial cost, why not be explicit about
this objection and impose the policy in those other areas
where the likely financial cost is nonexistent or minimal''
Such a decision by the University would be a useful
admission that the University, whatever its commitment to
humane values, must operate in an arena of realism where
financial considerations heavily influence policy and choice.
We may regret the fact of such pressures, but we do not
believe that universities arc free.
IV. Section B. Employers Who Discriminate Should
Not Be Banned
(For vote, see Sec. IVA, above)
Stanford's career planning and placement services exist to
respond to the expressed needs of individual students. Uni
versity placement facilities are therefore made available to
any student who wishes to see any prospective employer. The
only valid exceptions are those based upon sound academic
reason or legal requirement. (See Dean Thomas Ehrlich's
memorandum, Oct. 28, 1975).
The Gay People's Union proposal meets neither criterion,
yet they have asked the University to impose the CPU's
moral judgment on all students using the career information
service. Indeed, the University has judiciously avoided
applying any political, moral, or social test to the CPPC.
To the extent that the career planning and placement
service hopes to respond to the expressed needs of each
student it can never succumb to the will of a minority or to
the tyranny of the majority. Every student must be guaran
teed access to the CPPC; information concerning any business
must be made available to him or her.
The University is obligated to safeguard the right of each
student to make and exercise moral decisions. (It is unjust to
members of the Stanford community to deny them access to
job opportunities without their consent. Certainly, the CPU's
hope is to influence firms by denying them access to
Stanford students; the same result, however, can be achieved
by each Stanford student voluntarily deciding not to seek
employment with a discriminating firm.)
If the goal of the GPU is to protect its members from
malicious and discriminatory hiring, then it should seek the
dissemination of information on hiring and promotion poli
cies. By requiring the firms to make this information freely
available, each student can decide whether to seek employ
ment with a firm that may or may not claim to discriminate.
The proposed exclusion of firms that discriminate on the
basis of sexual preferences or affection would retard the
honest relay of information.
Since no statistical check exists through which a firm's
actual hiring and promotion policies can be evaluated, and
the penalties for claiming to discriminate are so high, good
financial incentives exist for employers to transmit informa
tion less than honestly.
If the goal of the CPU's request, however, is to influence
social mores through utilization of a service to students, then
they infringe on the rights of other students to make moral
decisions. Students would then have their moral actions
heavily influenced by University policy. No matter that we
agree with the moral judgment; we disagree with the direct
consequences of the advocated policy: the denial of each
student's freedom to make his own moral selections.
Sexual preference or affection should not be considered
within the same context as race, color, religion, sex, and
national origin as advocated by the GPU. This listing is used
to demark minority populations; positive employment pro
grams are created for minority communities defined by race,
color, religion, sex, and national origin. It is to the disadvan
tage of existing minority populations to expand the list.
The precedent set by linking sexual preference or affec
tion to race, color, religion, sex, and national origin could, in
time, lead to efforts to establish affirmative action policies
for gay people.
There exist two additional interesting, albeit not compel
ling, reasons not to ban sexually discriminating firms from
the CPPC:
First, the labor market conditions that allow discrimina
tion against gay people arc identical to the conditions
necessary for discrimination against minorities; the problem
lies in lack of free-market competition. Enforcement of the
GPU request would limit the number of interviewing firms at
Stanford. Unfortunately any reduction in the number of
interviewing firms most directly harms the minority appli
cant.
Second, an inevitable consequence of enforcement of the
proposed ban is to remove military recruiting from Stanford.
The dire consequences of this are delineated in I rank
Riddle's memo of Dec. 5, 1975. (See Sec. / VA, above)

Following is a copy of a report on "Placement Services
Policy Recommendations" sent to Stanford President
Richard W. Lyman Feb. 11, 1976 by the Committee on
Services to Students. Deans of the seven schools, Career
Planning and Placement Center Director Ralph Keller, and
other officers directly affected will be asked to send any
comments they may have on the recommendations to James
Lyons, dean of student affairs. He will forward these,
together with his own recommendations, to Lyman before
the President acts on the report.
/. Summary of Current Placement Services Philo
sophies
The keystone of the philosophy of career planning and
placement services at Stanford is student centeredness. These
services exist to respond primarily to the expressed needs of
individual students.
To the extent that those needs are served well the
University is also benefited. The programs of individual
schools or departments are undoubtedly more enticing when
their students have good job opportunities to choose from
and when the students make wise and informed choices.
Other secondary beneficiaries of a good career planning
and placement program are alumni, who can make continued
use of the several placement services on campus. They are
served better by an active and well-organized program.
However, the primary efforts of the career planning and
placement services of Stanford are directed toward the career
planning and placement needs of the individual student.
There are some objectives that are not associated with
career planning and placement services at Stanford. The
University has in recent years avoided applying political or
social tests in the career information or placement processes,
except when mandated to do so by law.
(No one, including CPPC Director Ralph Keller, has been
able to inform the Committee of practices preceeding the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its interpretation by the courts
and applications by the Government.)
Nor are our services run for the primary benefit of,
industry, governmental agencies, schools and colleges, or
other social institutions. If such groups happen to be well
served by Stanford's career planning and placement services,
it is because of a congruence of need or interest with the
group primarily served-the students.
The career planning and placement services have resisted
occasional attempts to be used as explicit instruments of
social change. Many students will consider a wide variety of
career options during their time at Stanford, a process which
will often lead them to discover a number of unimagined
alternatives and ultimately the rejection of more alternatives
than are kept as "live" options.
This is an educationally useful process, but one which
requires free access to many choices; an access unmarrcd by
political tests, censured career libraries, or by a list of firms
that are "forbidden at Stanford" for reasons of contrariness
to some political or social philosophy dominating career and
recruiting facibties at Stanford.
In short, Stanford's career planning and placement facili
ties have tried to maximize students' choices, not limit them;
and to help the individual student to make choices rather
than to choose for the student by elimination of lawful but
unpopular choice alternatives.
The University advocates the exercise of informed choice,
of the use of the intellect in the proccss of choosing an area
of employment or a particular employer. Our career planning
activities, therefore, are aimed towards helping students
discover and weigh information about areas of employment
and particular employers and to help them identify and relate
their own needs and interests to this information.
The University is also committed to helping students and
potential employers identify and distinguish between infor
mation which is job-related and that which is not.
We can and should help employers and potential em
ployees provide each other with information to help assess
predicted job performance and job expectations, and discour
age the use of information that transcends the boundaries of
job-relatedness and intrudes into areas of privacy and person
al circumstance.
Information that is usually suspect of being not job-re
lated is often associated with race, national origin, religion,
sex, sexual preferences and activities, marital status, political
and social beliefs, certain specific medical conditions, and
family background.
If employers seek such information from candidates, or
use such information if otherwise discoVered, Stanford stu
dents should reasonably expect employers to be open about
such use, to explain the job-relatedness of such information,
and to be clear and open about the criteria they will use in
hiring and promotion.
11. A Positive Commitment for the University and
Employers
(Approved unanimously)
The Gay People's Union at Stanford has emphasized that
homosexual students have comc to fear invidious discrimina
tion in the employment process. This fear is dehumanizing
and may be a significant handicap in the job-seeking process.
In recent years employers have comc to recognize the
need for full, precise, and open job descriptions. A growing
number of employers have realized that many personal
characteristics previously assumed to be job-related arc not.
We believe that students should be able to know if
companies regard personal characteristics which are usually
regarded as private, such as religion, sexual preference, or
political belief, to be job-related, and thus form a basis for
hiring, work assignment, and promotions. We also believe
that students should know if companies have or do not have
specific policies about such matters, and if so, what those
policies arc. (See Section III)
Our several career planning and placement services should
find ways that will encourage recruiting organizations to be
sensitive to such matters if they are not so already, and to
establish policies that make clear employee selection criteria
as they pertain to personal characteristics.
Wc therefore recommend:
I. That a statement by the University similar to the
following be included in communications with potential

recruiters using our facilities. "Though not compelled by
law, Stanford University wishes to avoid discrimination
on the basis of sexual preference in its own promotion
and hiring policies and urges employers using our facilities
to follow similar practices."
(The Committee believed that Stanford should assess its
own employment policies regarding homosexuals. It is
however, beyond the purview of our committee to deter
mine what that explicit and expressed policy should be.)
2. that steps be taken to involve homosexual students
and staff directly in the career planning and placement
processes and enlist their help in Finding more effective
ways for employers and applicants to deal with the feeling
invoked by the term "homosexual" when it arises in the
selections proccss.
///. A Statement of Policy from Employers
(Approved by a vote of 6 to 1 with 2 absent)
We recommend that employers using University facilities
be required to answer the question, "In your hiring and
promotion policies and practices do you discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation?"
The Committee was split on the issue of whether to
encourage or to require employers to respond to the above
question. The dissenting member accepted this section where
such a question would be encouraged rather than required.
Also, deans of some schools may feel that the proper way to
get at the spirit of this issue is through a different phrasing. If
so, wc ask the suggested changes or revisions be presented to
the Dean of Student Affairs.)
Requiring employers to answer the above question is
consistent with the philosophy underlying career placement
at Stanford. The University believes that students should be
precisely informed about all policies which might affect their
interests, in order that they can adequately judge with whom
they should seek employment.
The simplest way for students to receive employment
related information of concern to them is by asking an
interviewer directly. Students can ask interviewers questions
concerning most aspects of employment without adversely
affecting their job placement prospects.
With regard to sexual orientation however, students
making inquiries are likely to be perceived by the inter
viewers as being homosexual, which may prejudice their
employment. Being justificably afraid of jeopardizing their
job-placement chances, few gay students are willing to breach
the subject of sexual orientation with prospective employers.
In addition, some of Stanford's gay graduates may un
knowingly begin their careers in organizations whose policies
and practices are repugnant to their own. Requiring employ
ment statements to promote full employment disclosure
concerning sexual orientation would be an important step
toward a remedy.
Students who are not gay would also benefit from the
procedure this committee has called for. Many students,
while not themselves injured by discrimination on the basis
of sexual preference, morally object to hiring and advance
ment criteria not related to job performance.
Employers' statements concerning sexual orientation in
hiring and promotion will provide all students with useful
information concerning what different organizations consider
to be important.
The Committee does not believe that requesting em
ployers' statements would provide a panacea for discrimina
tion on the basis of sexual preference. Many employers will
claim that they do not discriminate, whereas in fact they do;
many Stanford graduates will remain "closet homosexuals"
regardless of employment prospects, for social and family
reasons.
Nevertheless, the procedure our committee has called for
will assist some Stanford students in contributing to the
limits of their capacities without fear that their sexual
preference will hinder them. At the very least, adoption of
this proposal will demonstrate that Stanford is willing to take
a substantial step towards helping its students make truly free
and informed choices.
IV. Section A: Employers Who Do Discriminate
Should Be Banned
(The Committee was exactly split on the issue of whether
to ban employers who discriminated on the basis of sexual
preference from using Stanford facilities.
(Despite our inability to agree on a specific recommendat
ion, we have presented the arguments on both sides of the
issue. See Section IVB. This project was to some extent to
foster greater discussion of these issues. Our arguments may
also benefit future study on this or similar issues.
(Vote: 3 for section IVA, 3 for section IVB, I abstention,
I absent.)
Position A: We believe that Stanford University has an
oblijption to deny use of its placement facilities to employers
who discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.
Such discrimination is abhorrent to gay students, faculty,
and staff, as well as to many other members of the University
community. If the University does not bar such employers, it
is in effect acceding to a policy of cruel and debilitating
discrimination directed against some of its more vulnerable
students.
Stanford should not permit itself to be used to perpetuate
discrimination against gay persons. Discrimination on the
basis of sexual preference seems to us, in principle, equivalent
to discrimination on the basis of religion, sex, and color. In
each case, such discrimination is based usually on invidious
distinctions and denies to substantial numbers equal opportu
nity and, often, humane treatment.
Opponents of our recommendation for a change in policy
have raised various principled objections, and the more
important arguments are reducible to two:
The first is that the University has barred employers who
discriminate on the basis of religion, sex, and color only
because of federal law; that the present case reaches beyond
the requirement of the law to have the University promote
social values; and that the University should not seek to act
to promote social values.
The second is that the University should allow students
free choice to make their own decisions (e.g., whether or not
to interview with a discriminatory firm) because the exercise

of such choice contributes significantly to education.
These arguments seem dubious, neglect important pre
cendents, and rest often, at critical junctures, upon incorrect
assumptions about the activities of the University.
Let us first address the "promoting social value" objec
tion. We believe that the University has acted, and has often
sought to act, in many important ways that promote partic
ular social values-whether to maintain or alter the society.
Probably no institution, by its decisions and actions, can
avoid influencing values and promoting or altering them;
certainly, that is dramatically true in the case of a major
institution such as Stanford, which has considerable impact
upon various groups and localities by its decisions on, for
example, land use, investment policies, and admissions poli
cies.
Whether Stanford decides to rent land to the highest
bidder and/or to support low-cost housing for some disadvan
taged peoples, the University is, intentionally or not, pro
moting certain social values. In some notable cases, including
recent efforts for low-cost housing, the University formulated
policy with the explicit intention of promoting particular
social values.
Let us look briefly at the area of admissions policy for
additional evidence on this matter. In the past eight to 10
years, for various social reasons, the University has chosen, at
times, to increase the number of minority students in the
student body.
Such decisions for preferential admissions were based,
often self-consciously, upon larger social considerations: the
duties of a University to the society; the need to provide
greater opportunity to members of some racial minorities;
the desirability of promoting racial integration and of stifling
social disruptions. Such commitments were not required by
law, and they marked a departure from Stanford's earlier
policies.
We cite these changes in admissions policies to establish
the proposition that the University has acted, in important
matters, without the requirement of law to promote particu
lar social values.
In actual practices, of course, the University promotes
values in other more subtle and possibly more fundamental
ways. Consider, for example, the University's commitment to
a business school or a law school. Such a major financial
commitment assumes 'hat "doing" law or business is desir
able, that it promotes desirable social values, and that it
usually serves both the society and the individual.
In turn, obviously, the establishment of schools of revolu
tion would be unlikely (though legal), for they would
promote undesirable values. The critical difference is not
whether the University intends to promote social values but
which ones it seeks to promote.
Let us address the "free choice" objection. We do not
deny that some educational value does inhere sometimes,
perhaps even most times, in free choice itself, for the fact of
free choice may compel reflection and lead to judicious
action. But often the small increment of value may be
outweighed by the great harm of particular decisions. For

native Americans, is one example of possible harm outweigh

and placement program are alumni, who can make continued
use of the several placement services on campus. They are
served better by an active and well-organized program.
However, the primary efforts of the career planning and
placement services of Stanford are directed toward the career
planning and placement needs of the individual student.
There are some objectives that are not associated with
career planning and placement services at Stanford. The
University has in recent years avoided applying political or
social tests in the career information or placement processes,
except when mandated to do so by law.
(No one, including CPPC Director Ralph Keller, has been
able to inform the Committee of practices preceeding the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its interpretation by the courts
and applications by the Government.)
Nor are our services run for the primary benefit of,
industry, governmental agencies, schools and colleges, or
other social institutions. If such groups happen to be well
served by Stanford's career planning and placement services,
it is because of a congruence of need or interest with the
group primarily served-the students.
The career planning and placement services have resisted
occasional attempts to be used as explicit instruments of
social change. Many students will consider a wide variety of
career options during their time at Stanford, a process which
will often lead them to discover a number of unimagined
alternatives and ultimately the rejection of more alternatives
than are kept as "live" options.
This is an educationally useful process, but one which
requires free access to many choices; an access unmarrcd by
political tests, censured career libraries, or by a list of firms
that are "forbidden at Stanford" for reasons of contrariness
to some political or social philosophy dominating career and
recruiting facibties at Stanford.
In short, Stanford's career planning and placement facili
ties have tried to maximize students' choices, not limit them;
and to help the individual student to make choices rather
than to choose for the student by elimination of lawful but
unpopular choice alternatives.
The University advocates the exercise of informed choice,
of the use of the intellect in the proccss of choosing an area
of employment or a particular employer. Our career planning
activities, therefore, are aimed towards helping students
discover and weigh information about areas of employment
and particular employers and to help them identify and relate
their own needs and interests to this information.
The University is also committed to helping students and
potential employers identify and distinguish between infor
mation which is job-related and that which is not.
We can and should help employers and potential em
ployees provide each other with information to help assess
predicted job performance and job expectations, and discour
age the use of information that transcends the boundaries of
job-relatedness and intrudes into areas of privacy and person
al circumstance.
Information that is usually suspect of being not job-re
lated is often associated with race, national origin, religion,
sex, sexual preferences and activities, marital status, political
and social beliefs, certain specific medical conditions, and
family background.
If employers seek such information from candidates, or
use such information if otherwise discoVered, Stanford stu
dents should reasonably expect employers to be open about
such use, to explain the job-relatedness of such information,
and to be clear and open about the criteria they will use in
hiring and promotion.
11. A Positive Commitment for the University and
Employers
(Approved unanimously)
The Gay People's Union at Stanford has emphasized that
homosexual students have comc to fear invidious discrimina
tion in the employment process. This fear is dehumanizing
and may be a significant handicap in the job-seeking process.
In recent years employers have comc to recognize the
need for full, precise, and open job descriptions. A growing
number of employers have realized that many personal
characteristics previously assumed to be job-related arc not.
We believe that students should be able to know if
companies regard personal characteristics which are usually
regarded as private, such as religion, sexual preference, or
political belief, to be job-related, and thus form a basis for
hiring, work assignment, and promotions. We also believe
that students should know if companies have or do not have
specific policies about such matters, and if so, what those
policies arc. (See Section III)
Our several career planning and placement services should
find ways that will encourage recruiting organizations to be
sensitive to such matters if they are not so already, and to
establish policies that make clear employee selection criteria
as they pertain to personal characteristics.
Wc therefore recommend:
I. That a statement by the University similar to the
following be included in communications with potential

recruiters using our facilities. "Though not compelled by
law, Stanford University wishes to avoid discrimination
on the basis of sexual preference in its own promotion
and hiring policies and urges employers using our facilities
to follow similar practices."
(The Committee believed that Stanford should assess its
own employment policies regarding homosexuals. It is
however, beyond the purview of our committee to deter
mine what that explicit and expressed policy should be.)
2. that steps be taken to involve homosexual students
and staff directly in the career planning and placement
processes and enlist their help in Finding more effective
ways for employers and applicants to deal with the feeling
invoked by the term "homosexual" when it arises in the
selections proccss.
///. A Statement of Policy from Employers
(Approved by a vote of 6 to 1 with 2 absent)
We recommend that employers using University facilities
be required to answer the question, "In your hiring and
promotion policies and practices do you discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation?"
The Committee was split on the issue of whether to
encourage or to require employers to respond to the above
question. The dissenting member accepted this section where
such a question would be encouraged rather than required.
Also, deans of some schools may feel that the proper way to
get at the spirit of this issue is through a different phrasing. If
so, wc ask the suggested changes or revisions be presented to
the Dean of Student Affairs.)
Requiring employers to answer the above question is
consistent with the philosophy underlying career placement
at Stanford. The University believes that students should be
precisely informed about all policies which might affect their
interests, in order that they can adequately judge with whom
they should seek employment.
The simplest way for students to receive employment
related information of concern to them is by asking an
interviewer directly. Students can ask interviewers questions
concerning most aspects of employment without adversely
affecting their job placement prospects.
With regard to sexual orientation however, students
making inquiries are likely to be perceived by the inter
viewers as being homosexual, which may prejudice their
employment. Being justificably afraid of jeopardizing their
job-placement chances, few gay students are willing to breach
the subject of sexual orientation with prospective employers.
In addition, some of Stanford's gay graduates may un
knowingly begin their careers in organizations whose policies
and practices are repugnant to their own. Requiring employ
ment statements to promote full employment disclosure
concerning sexual orientation would be an important step
toward a remedy.
Students who are not gay would also benefit from the
procedure this committee has called for. Many students,
while not themselves injured by discrimination on the basis
of sexual preference, morally object to hiring and advance
ment criteria not related to job performance.
Employers' statements concerning sexual orientation in
hiring and promotion will provide all students with useful
information concerning what different organizations consider
to be important.
The Committee does not believe that requesting em
ployers' statements would provide a panacea for discrimina
tion on the basis of sexual preference. Many employers will
claim that they do not discriminate, whereas in fact they do;
many Stanford graduates will remain "closet homosexuals"
regardless of employment prospects, for social and family
reasons.
Nevertheless, the procedure our committee has called for
will assist some Stanford students in contributing to the
limits of their capacities without fear that their sexual
preference will hinder them. At the very least, adoption of
this proposal will demonstrate that Stanford is willing to take
a substantial step towards helping its students make truly free
and informed choices.
IV. Section A: Employers Who Do Discriminate
Should Be Banned
(The Committee was exactly split on the issue of whether
to ban employers who discriminated on the basis of sexual
preference from using Stanford facilities.
(Despite our inability to agree on a specific recommendat
ion, we have presented the arguments on both sides of the
issue. See Section IVB. This project was to some extent to
foster greater discussion of these issues. Our arguments may
also benefit future study on this or similar issues.
(Vote: 3 for section IVA, 3 for section IVB, I abstention,
I absent.)
Position A: We believe that Stanford University has an
oblijption to deny use of its placement facilities to employers
who discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.
Such discrimination is abhorrent to gay students, faculty,
and staff, as well as to many other members of the University
community. If the University does not bar such employers, it
is in effect acceding to a policy of cruel and debilitating
discrimination directed against some of its more vulnerable
students.
Stanford should not permit itself to be used to perpetuate
discrimination against gay persons. Discrimination on the
basis of sexual preference seems to us, in principle, equivalent
to discrimination on the basis of religion, sex, and color. In
each case, such discrimination is based usually on invidious
distinctions and denies to substantial numbers equal opportu
nity and, often, humane treatment.
Opponents of our recommendation for a change in policy
have raised various principled objections, and the more
important arguments are reducible to two:
The first is that the University has barred employers who
discriminate on the basis of religion, sex, and color only
because of federal law; that the present case reaches beyond
the requirement of the law to have the University promote
social values; and that the University should not seek to act
to promote social values.
The second is that the University should allow students
free choice to make their own decisions (e.g., whether or not
to interview with a discriminatory firm) because the exercise

of such choice contributes significantly to education.
These arguments seem dubious, neglect important pre
cendents, and rest often, at critical junctures, upon incorrect
assumptions about the activities of the University.
Let us first address the "promoting social value" objec
tion. We believe that the University has acted, and has often
sought to act, in many important ways that promote partic
ular social values-whether to maintain or alter the society.
Probably no institution, by its decisions and actions, can
avoid influencing values and promoting or altering them;
certainly, that is dramatically true in the case of a major
institution such as Stanford, which has considerable impact
upon various groups and localities by its decisions on, for
example, land use, investment policies, and admissions poli
cies.
Whether Stanford decides to rent land to the highest
bidder and/or to support low-cost housing for some disadvan
taged peoples, the University is, intentionally or not, pro
moting certain social values. In some notable cases, including
recent efforts for low-cost housing, the University formulated
policy with the explicit intention of promoting particular
social values.
Let us look briefly at the area of admissions policy for
additional evidence on this matter. In the past eight to 10
years, for various social reasons, the University has chosen, at
times, to increase the number of minority students in the
student body.
Such decisions for preferential admissions were based,
often self-consciously, upon larger social considerations: the
duties of a University to the society; the need to provide
greater opportunity to members of some racial minorities;
the desirability of promoting racial integration and of stifling
social disruptions. Such commitments were not required by
law, and they marked a departure from Stanford's earlier
policies.
We cite these changes in admissions policies to establish
the proposition that the University has acted, in important
matters, without the requirement of law to promote particu
lar social values.
In actual practices, of course, the University promotes
values in other more subtle and possibly more fundamental
ways. Consider, for example, the University's commitment to
a business school or a law school. Such a major financial
commitment assumes 'hat "doing" law or business is desir
able, that it promotes desirable social values, and that it
usually serves both the society and the individual.
In turn, obviously, the establishment of schools of revolu
tion would be unlikely (though legal), for they would
promote undesirable values. The critical difference is not
whether the University intends to promote social values but
which ones it seeks to promote.
Let us address the "free choice" objection. We do not
deny that some educational value does inhere sometimes,
perhaps even most times, in free choice itself, for the fact of
free choice may compel reflection and lead to judicious
action. But often the small increment of value may be
outweighed by the great harm of particular decisions. For
example, selection of the Indian symbol, so offensive to
native Americans, is one example of possible harm outweigh
ing the benefit of choice.
The administration wisely decided to eliminate the Indian
symbol because it offended native Americans. Under the
Committee's minority contention, which we reject, it would
seem to follow that the administration should not have taken
such action. Instead, as we understand their logic, each team,
or class, or appropriate group should make a new decision
about the Indian symbol because there will be greater
educational value in this exercise of free choice.
A closer analogy to the case before us might be the
imposition of educational area distribution requirements.
These educational requirements do restrict free choice by
compelling students to take some courses in areas that they
might otherwise disregard or avoid. In most cases, it appears,
students benefit educationally from these requirements, even
though they do not experience the real possibility of free
choice.
The proposed ban of employers who discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation might operate in roughly analo
gous fashion for students. They arc not being denied the
opportunity to seek interviews with these employers. Instead,
students will have to think carefully about the situation and
then make individual arrangements with such employers.
Perhaps this small difficulty will inspire students to think
very carefully about the exercise of their choice-a goal that
the "free choice" advocates seek to achieve and that wc
endorse.
We do not believe that the proposed change in policy will
bar many employers or significantly affect job opportunities
for students. Ten years ago, and maybe even two or three
years ago, most major employers might have been unwilling
or unable to agree to a policy of nondiscrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation.
Recent declarations by AT &. T and other major firms
indicate a shift in values and standards, and wc anticipate a
continuation of this trend. Our policy, in most cases, will
simply speed the trend.
Reccnt decisions by the military services indicate, unless
there is a reversal of these decisions by the administration or
the courts, that the American military may be the notable
exception. There is some likelikhood that it may revise policy
in the next decade, but we do not foresee a reversal in the
next few years.
Since federal regulations do not allow some federal
agencies (NASA, DOD, and FRDA, among others) to con
tract with universities that ban military recruiting, and our
proposed policy would have the effect of banning such
recruiting, the University would lose some contracts and
(according to Frank Riddle) about $4.75 million in unrestric
ted funds.
We could uneasily countenance the loss of these funds
and would urge the President to act in the moral merits of
the issues without consideration of the financial problems.
Such counsel may be easier to give than to receive, and wc
recognize that it is unlikely that the President will be willing
to take such action and to plunge the University more deeply
into annual deficits at this time.

As a result, we suggest an uneasy, but not altogether
unsatisfactory compromise. If the main objection to our
proposed policy is that it cannot be imposed on the military
because of the great financial cost, why not be explicit about
this objection and impose the policy in those other areas
where the likely financial cost is nonexistent or minimal''
Such a decision by the University would be a useful
admission that the University, whatever its commitment to
humane values, must operate in an arena of realism where
financial considerations heavily influence policy and choice.
We may regret the fact of such pressures, but we do not
believe that universities arc free.
IV. Section B. Employers Who Discriminate Should
Not Be Banned
(For vote, see Sec. IVA, above)
Stanford's career planning and placement services exist to
respond to the expressed needs of individual students. Uni
versity placement facilities are therefore made available to
any student who wishes to see any prospective employer. The
only valid exceptions are those based upon sound academic
reason or legal requirement. (See Dean Thomas Ehrlich's
memorandum, Oct. 28, 1975).
The Gay People's Union proposal meets neither criterion,
yet they have asked the University to impose the CPU's
moral judgment on all students using the career information
service. Indeed, the University has judiciously avoided
applying any political, moral, or social test to the CPPC.
To the extent that the career planning and placement
service hopes to respond to the expressed needs of each
student it can never succumb to the will of a minority or to
the tyranny of the majority. Every student must be guaran
teed access to the CPPC; information concerning any business
must be made available to him or her.
The University is obligated to safeguard the right of each
student to make and exercise moral decisions. (It is unjust to
members of the Stanford community to deny them access to
job opportunities without their consent. Certainly, the CPU's
hope is to influence firms by denying them access to
Stanford students; the same result, however, can be achieved
by each Stanford student voluntarily deciding not to seek
employment with a discriminating firm.)
If the goal of the GPU is to protect its members from
malicious and discriminatory hiring, then it should seek the
dissemination of information on hiring and promotion poli
cies. By requiring the firms to make this information freely
available, each student can decide whether to seek employ
ment with a firm that may or may not claim to discriminate.
The proposed exclusion of firms that discriminate on the
basis of sexual preferences or affection would retard the
honest relay of information.
Since no statistical check exists through which a firm's
actual hiring and promotion policies can be evaluated, and
the penalties for claiming to discriminate are so high, good
financial incentives exist for employers to transmit informa
tion less than honestly.
If the goal of the CPU's request, however, is to influence
social mores through utilization of a service to students, then
they infringe on the rights of other students to make moral
decisions. Students would then have their moral actions
heavily influenced by University policy. No matter that we
agree with the moral judgment; we disagree with the direct
consequences of the advocated policy: the denial of each
student's freedom to make his own moral selections.
Sexual preference or affection should not be considered
within the same context as race, color, religion, sex, and
national origin as advocated by the GPU. This listing is used
to demark minority populations; positive employment pro
grams are created for minority communities defined by race,
color, religion, sex, and national origin. It is to the disadvan
tage of existing minority populations to expand the list.
The precedent set by linking sexual preference or affec
tion to race, color, religion, sex, and national origin could, in
time, lead to efforts to establish affirmative action policies
for gay people.
There exist two additional interesting, albeit not compel
ling, reasons not to ban sexually discriminating firms from
the CPPC:
First, the labor market conditions that allow discrimina
tion against gay people arc identical to the conditions
necessary for discrimination against minorities; the problem
lies in lack of free-market competition. Enforcement of the
GPU request would limit the number of interviewing firms at
Stanford. Unfortunately any reduction in the number of
interviewing firms most directly harms the minority appli
cant.
Second, an inevitable consequence of enforcement of the
proposed ban is to remove military recruiting from Stanford.
The dire consequences of this are delineated in I rank
Riddle's memo of Dec. 5, 1975. (See Sec. / VA, above)

Following is a copy of a report on "Placement Services
Policy Recommendations" sent to Stanford President
Richard W. Lyman Feb. 11, 1976 by the Committee on
Services to Students. Deans of the seven schools, Career
Planning and Placement Center Director Ralph Keller, and
other officers directly affected will be asked to send any
comments they may have on the recommendations to James
Lyons, dean of student affairs. He will forward these,
together with his own recommendations, to Lyman before
the President acts on the report.
/. Summary of Current Placement Services Philo
sophies
The keystone of the philosophy of career planning and
placement services at Stanford is student centeredness. These
services exist to respond primarily to the expressed needs of
individual students.
To the extent that those needs are served well the
University is also benefited. The programs of individual
schools or departments are undoubtedly more enticing when
their students have good job opportunities to choose from
and when the students make wise and informed choices.
Other secondary beneficiaries of a good career planning
and placement program are alumni, who can make continued
use of the several placement services on campus. They are
served better by an active and well-organized program.
However, the primary efforts of the career planning and
placement services of Stanford are directed toward the career
planning and placement needs of the individual student.
There are some objectives that are not associated with
career planning and placement services at Stanford. The
University has in recent years avoided applying political or
social tests in the career information or placement processes,
except when mandated to do so by law.
(No one, including CPPC Director Ralph Keller, has been
able to inform the Committee of practices preceeding the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its interpretation by the courts
and applications by the Government.)
Nor are our services run for the primary benefit of,

and to be clear and open about the criteria they will use in

social disruptions. Such commitments were not required by
law, and they marked a departure from Stanford's earlier
policies.
We cite these changes in admissions policies to establish
the proposition that the University has acted, in important
matters, without the requirement of law to promote particu
lar social values.
In actual practices, of course, the University promotes
values in other more subtle and possibly more fundamental
ways. Consider, for example, the University's commitment to
a business school or a law school. Such a major financial
commitment assumes 'hat "doing" law or business is desir
able, that it promotes desirable social values, and that it
usually serves both the society and the individual.
In turn, obviously, the establishment of schools of revolu
tion would be unlikely (though legal), for they would
promote undesirable values. The critical difference is not
whether the University intends to promote social values but
which ones it seeks to promote.
Let us address the "free choice" objection. We do not
deny that some educational value does inhere sometimes,
perhaps even most times, in free choice itself, for the fact of
free choice may compel reflection and lead to judicious
action. But often the small increment of value may be
outweighed by the great harm of particular decisions. For
example, selection of the Indian symbol, so offensive to
native Americans, is one example of possible harm outweigh
ing the benefit of choice.
The administration wisely decided to eliminate the Indian
symbol because it offended native Americans. Under the
Committee's minority contention, which we reject, it would
seem to follow that the administration should not have taken
such action. Instead, as we understand their logic, each team,
or class, or appropriate group should make a new decision
about the Indian symbol because there will be greater
educational value in this exercise of free choice.
A closer analogy to the case before us might be the
imposition of educational area distribution requirements.
These educational requirements do restrict free choice by
compelling students to take some courses in areas that they
might otherwise disregard or avoid. In most cases, it appears,
students benefit educationally from these requirements, even
though they do not experience the real possibility of free
choice.
The proposed ban of employers who discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation might operate in roughly analo
gous fashion for students. They arc not being denied the
opportunity to seek interviews with these employers. Instead,
students will have to think carefully about the situation and
then make individual arrangements with such employers.
Perhaps this small difficulty will inspire students to think
very carefully about the exercise of their choice-a goal that
the "free choice" advocates seek to achieve and that wc
endorse.
We do not believe that the proposed change in policy will
bar many employers or significantly affect job opportunities
for students. Ten years ago, and maybe even two or three
years ago, most major employers might have been unwilling
or unable to agree to a policy of nondiscrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation.
Recent declarations by AT &. T and other major firms
indicate a shift in values and standards, and wc anticipate a
continuation of this trend. Our policy, in most cases, will
simply speed the trend.
Reccnt decisions by the military services indicate, unless
there is a reversal of these decisions by the administration or
the courts, that the American military may be the notable
exception. There is some likelikhood that it may revise policy
in the next decade, but we do not foresee a reversal in the
next few years.
Since federal regulations do not allow some federal
agencies (NASA, DOD, and FRDA, among others) to con
tract with universities that ban military recruiting, and our
proposed policy would have the effect of banning such
recruiting, the University would lose some contracts and
(according to Frank Riddle) about $4.75 million in unrestric
ted funds.
We could uneasily countenance the loss of these funds
and would urge the President to act in the moral merits of
the issues without consideration of the financial problems.
Such counsel may be easier to give than to receive, and wc
recognize that it is unlikely that the President will be willing
to take such action and to plunge the University more deeply
into annual deficits at this time.

As a result, we suggest an uneasy, but not altogether
unsatisfactory compromise. If the main objection to our
proposed policy is that it cannot be imposed on the military
because of the great financial cost, why not be explicit about
this objection and impose the policy in those other areas
where the likely financial cost is nonexistent or minimal''
Such a decision by the University would be a useful
admission that the University, whatever its commitment to
humane values, must operate in an arena of realism where
financial considerations heavily influence policy and choice.
We may regret the fact of such pressures, but we do not
believe that universities arc free.
IV. Section B. Employers Who Discriminate Should
Not Be Banned
(For vote, see Sec. IVA, above)
Stanford's career planning and placement services exist to
respond to the expressed needs of individual students. Uni
versity placement facilities are therefore made available to
any student who wishes to see any prospective employer. The
only valid exceptions are those based upon sound academic
reason or legal requirement. (See Dean Thomas Ehrlich's
memorandum, Oct. 28, 1975).
The Gay People's Union proposal meets neither criterion,
yet they have asked the University to impose the CPU's
moral judgment on all students using the career information
service. Indeed, the University has judiciously avoided
applying any political, moral, or social test to the CPPC.
To the extent that the career planning and placement
service hopes to respond to the expressed needs of each
student it can never succumb to the will of a minority or to
the tyranny of the majority. Every student must be guaran
teed access to the CPPC; information concerning any business
must be made available to him or her.
The University is obligated to safeguard the right of each
student to make and exercise moral decisions. (It is unjust to
members of the Stanford community to deny them access to
job opportunities without their consent. Certainly, the CPU's
hope is to influence firms by denying them access to
Stanford students; the same result, however, can be achieved
by each Stanford student voluntarily deciding not to seek
employment with a discriminating firm.)
If the goal of the GPU is to protect its members from
malicious and discriminatory hiring, then it should seek the
dissemination of information on hiring and promotion poli
cies. By requiring the firms to make this information freely
available, each student can decide whether to seek employ
ment with a firm that may or may not claim to discriminate.
The proposed exclusion of firms that discriminate on the
basis of sexual preferences or affection would retard the
honest relay of information.
Since no statistical check exists through which a firm's
actual hiring and promotion policies can be evaluated, and
the penalties for claiming to discriminate are so high, good
financial incentives exist for employers to transmit informa
tion less than honestly.
If the goal of the CPU's request, however, is to influence
social mores through utilization of a service to students, then
they infringe on the rights of other students to make moral
decisions. Students would then have their moral actions
heavily influenced by University policy. No matter that we
agree with the moral judgment; we disagree with the direct
consequences of the advocated policy: the denial of each
student's freedom to make his own moral selections.
Sexual preference or affection should not be considered
within the same context as race, color, religion, sex, and
national origin as advocated by the GPU. This listing is used
to demark minority populations; positive employment pro
grams are created for minority communities defined by race,
color, religion, sex, and national origin. It is to the disadvan
tage of existing minority populations to expand the list.
The precedent set by linking sexual preference or affec
tion to race, color, religion, sex, and national origin could, in
time, lead to efforts to establish affirmative action policies
for gay people.
There exist two additional interesting, albeit not compel
ling, reasons not to ban sexually discriminating firms from
the CPPC:
First, the labor market conditions that allow discrimina
tion against gay people arc identical to the conditions
necessary for discrimination against minorities; the problem
lies in lack of free-market competition. Enforcement of the
GPU request would limit the number of interviewing firms at
Stanford. Unfortunately any reduction in the number of
interviewing firms most directly harms the minority appli
cant.
Second, an inevitable consequence of enforcement of the
proposed ban is to remove military recruiting from Stanford.
The dire consequences of this are delineated in I rank
Riddle's memo of Dec. 5, 1975. (See Sec. / VA, above)

Following is a copy of a report on "Placement Services
Policy Recommendations" sent to Stanford President
Richard W. Lyman Feb. 11, 1976 by the Committee on
Services to Students. Deans of the seven schools, Career
Planning and Placement Center Director Ralph Keller, and
other officers directly affected will be asked to send any
comments they may have on the recommendations to James
Lyons, dean of student affairs. He will forward these,
together with his own recommendations, to Lyman before
the President acts on the report.
/. Summary of Current Placement Services Philo
sophies
The keystone of the philosophy of career planning and
placement services at Stanford is student centeredness. These
services exist to respond primarily to the expressed needs of
individual students.
To the extent that those needs are served well the
University is also benefited. The programs of individual
schools or departments are undoubtedly more enticing when
their students have good job opportunities to choose from
and when the students make wise and informed choices.
Other secondary beneficiaries of a good career planning
and placement program are alumni, who can make continued
use of the several placement services on campus. They are
served better by an active and well-organized program.
However, the primary efforts of the career planning and
placement services of Stanford are directed toward the career
planning and placement needs of the individual student.
There are some objectives that are not associated with
career planning and placement services at Stanford. The
University has in recent years avoided applying political or
social tests in the career information or placement processes,
except when mandated to do so by law.
(No one, including CPPC Director Ralph Keller, has been
able to inform the Committee of practices preceeding the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its interpretation by the courts
and applications by the Government.)
Nor are our services run for the primary benefit of,
industry, governmental agencies, schools and colleges, or
other social institutions. If such groups happen to be well
served by Stanford's career planning and placement services,
it is because of a congruence of need or interest with the
group primarily served-the students.
The career planning and placement services have resisted
occasional attempts to be used as explicit instruments of
social change. Many students will consider a wide variety of
career options during their time at Stanford, a process which
will often lead them to discover a number of unimagined
alternatives and ultimately the rejection of more alternatives
than are kept as "live" options.
This is an educationally useful process, but one which
requires free access to many choices; an access unmarrcd by
political tests, censured career libraries, or by a list of firms
that are "forbidden at Stanford" for reasons of contrariness
to some political or social philosophy dominating career and
recruiting facibties at Stanford.
In short, Stanford's career planning and placement facili
ties have tried to maximize students' choices, not limit them;
and to help the individual student to make choices rather
than to choose for the student by elimination of lawful but
unpopular choice alternatives.
The University advocates the exercise of informed choice,
of the use of the intellect in the proccss of choosing an area
of employment or a particular employer. Our career planning
activities, therefore, are aimed towards helping students
discover and weigh information about areas of employment
and particular employers and to help them identify and relate
their own needs and interests to this information.
The University is also committed to helping students and
potential employers identify and distinguish between infor
mation which is job-related and that which is not.
We can and should help employers and potential em
ployees provide each other with information to help assess
predicted job performance and job expectations, and discour
age the use of information that transcends the boundaries of
job-relatedness and intrudes into areas of privacy and person
al circumstance.
Information that is usually suspect of being not job-re
lated is often associated with race, national origin, religion,
sex, sexual preferences and activities, marital status, political
and social beliefs, certain specific medical conditions, and
family background.
If employers seek such information from candidates, or
use such information if otherwise discoVered, Stanford stu
dents should reasonably expect employers to be open about
such use, to explain the job-relatedness of such information,
and to be clear and open about the criteria they will use in
hiring and promotion.
11. A Positive Commitment for the University and
Employers
(Approved unanimously)
The Gay People's Union at Stanford has emphasized that
homosexual students have comc to fear invidious discrimina
tion in the employment process. This fear is dehumanizing
and may be a significant handicap in the job-seeking process.
In recent years employers have comc to recognize the
need for full, precise, and open job descriptions. A growing
number of employers have realized that many personal
characteristics previously assumed to be job-related arc not.
We believe that students should be able to know if
companies regard personal characteristics which are usually
regarded as private, such as religion, sexual preference, or
political belief, to be job-related, and thus form a basis for
hiring, work assignment, and promotions. We also believe
that students should know if companies have or do not have
specific policies about such matters, and if so, what those
policies arc. (See Section III)
Our several career planning and placement services should
find ways that will encourage recruiting organizations to be
sensitive to such matters if they are not so already, and to
establish policies that make clear employee selection criteria
as they pertain to personal characteristics.
Wc therefore recommend:
I. That a statement by the University similar to the
following be included in communications with potential

recruiters using our facilities. "Though not compelled by
law, Stanford University wishes to avoid discrimination
on the basis of sexual preference in its own promotion
and hiring policies and urges employers using our facilities
to follow similar practices."
(The Committee believed that Stanford should assess its
own employment policies regarding homosexuals. It is
however, beyond the purview of our committee to deter
mine what that explicit and expressed policy should be.)
2. that steps be taken to involve homosexual students
and staff directly in the career planning and placement
processes and enlist their help in Finding more effective
ways for employers and applicants to deal with the feeling
invoked by the term "homosexual" when it arises in the
selections proccss.
///. A Statement of Policy from Employers
(Approved by a vote of 6 to 1 with 2 absent)
We recommend that employers using University facilities
be required to answer the question, "In your hiring and
promotion policies and practices do you discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation?"
The Committee was split on the issue of whether to
encourage or to require employers to respond to the above
question. The dissenting member accepted this section where
such a question would be encouraged rather than required.
Also, deans of some schools may feel that the proper way to
get at the spirit of this issue is through a different phrasing. If
so, wc ask the suggested changes or revisions be presented to
the Dean of Student Affairs.)
Requiring employers to answer the above question is
consistent with the philosophy underlying career placement
at Stanford. The University believes that students should be
precisely informed about all policies which might affect their
interests, in order that they can adequately judge with whom
they should seek employment.
The simplest way for students to receive employment
related information of concern to them is by asking an
interviewer directly. Students can ask interviewers questions
concerning most aspects of employment without adversely
affecting their job placement prospects.
With regard to sexual orientation however, students
making inquiries are likely to be perceived by the inter
viewers as being homosexual, which may prejudice their
employment. Being justificably afraid of jeopardizing their
job-placement chances, few gay students are willing to breach
the subject of sexual orientation with prospective employers.
In addition, some of Stanford's gay graduates may un
knowingly begin their careers in organizations whose policies
and practices are repugnant to their own. Requiring employ
ment statements to promote full employment disclosure
concerning sexual orientation would be an important step
toward a remedy.
Students who are not gay would also benefit from the
procedure this committee has called for. Many students,
while not themselves injured by discrimination on the basis
of sexual preference, morally object to hiring and advance
ment criteria not related to job performance.
Employers' statements concerning sexual orientation in
hiring and promotion will provide all students with useful
information concerning what different organizations consider
to be important.
The Committee does not believe that requesting em
ployers' statements would provide a panacea for discrimina
tion on the basis of sexual preference. Many employers will
claim that they do not discriminate, whereas in fact they do;
many Stanford graduates will remain "closet homosexuals"
regardless of employment prospects, for social and family
reasons.
Nevertheless, the procedure our committee has called for
will assist some Stanford students in contributing to the
limits of their capacities without fear that their sexual
preference will hinder them. At the very least, adoption of
this proposal will demonstrate that Stanford is willing to take
a substantial step towards helping its students make truly free
and informed choices.
IV. Section A: Employers Who Do Discriminate
Should Be Banned
(The Committee was exactly split on the issue of whether
to ban employers who discriminated on the basis of sexual
preference from using Stanford facilities.
(Despite our inability to agree on a specific recommendat
ion, we have presented the arguments on both sides of the
issue. See Section IVB. This project was to some extent to
foster greater discussion of these issues. Our arguments may
also benefit future study on this or similar issues.
(Vote: 3 for section IVA, 3 for section IVB, I abstention,
I absent.)
Position A: We believe that Stanford University has an
oblijption to deny use of its placement facilities to employers
who discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.
Such discrimination is abhorrent to gay students, faculty,
and staff, as well as to many other members of the University
community. If the University does not bar such employers, it
is in effect acceding to a policy of cruel and debilitating
discrimination directed against some of its more vulnerable
students.
Stanford should not permit itself to be used to perpetuate
discrimination against gay persons. Discrimination on the
basis of sexual preference seems to us, in principle, equivalent
to discrimination on the basis of religion, sex, and color. In
each case, such discrimination is based usually on invidious
distinctions and denies to substantial numbers equal opportu
nity and, often, humane treatment.
Opponents of our recommendation for a change in policy
have raised various principled objections, and the more
important arguments are reducible to two:
The first is that the University has barred employers who
discriminate on the basis of religion, sex, and color only
because of federal law; that the present case reaches beyond
the requirement of the law to have the University promote
social values; and that the University should not seek to act
to promote social values.
The second is that the University should allow students
free choice to make their own decisions (e.g., whether or not
to interview with a discriminatory firm) because the exercise

of such choice contributes significantly to education.
These arguments seem dubious, neglect important pre
cendents, and rest often, at critical junctures, upon incorrect
assumptions about the activities of the University.
Let us first address the "promoting social value" objec
tion. We believe that the University has acted, and has often
sought to act, in many important ways that promote partic
ular social values-whether to maintain or alter the society.
Probably no institution, by its decisions and actions, can
avoid influencing values and promoting or altering them;
certainly, that is dramatically true in the case of a major
institution such as Stanford, which has considerable impact
upon various groups and localities by its decisions on, for
example, land use, investment policies, and admissions poli
cies.
Whether Stanford decides to rent land to the highest
bidder and/or to support low-cost housing for some disadvan
taged peoples, the University is, intentionally or not, pro
moting certain social values. In some notable cases, including
recent efforts for low-cost housing, the University formulated
policy with the explicit intention of promoting particular
social values.
Let us look briefly at the area of admissions policy for
additional evidence on this matter. In the past eight to 10
years, for various social reasons, the University has chosen, at
times, to increase the number of minority students in the
student body.
Such decisions for preferential admissions were based,
often self-consciously, upon larger social considerations: the
duties of a University to the society; the need to provide
greater opportunity to members of some racial minorities;
the desirability of promoting racial integration and of stifling
social disruptions. Such commitments were not required by
law, and they marked a departure from Stanford's earlier
policies.
We cite these changes in admissions policies to establish
the proposition that the University has acted, in important
matters, without the requirement of law to promote particu
lar social values.
In actual practices, of course, the University promotes
values in other more subtle and possibly more fundamental
ways. Consider, for example, the University's commitment to
a business school or a law school. Such a major financial
commitment assumes 'hat "doing" law or business is desir
able, that it promotes desirable social values, and that it
usually serves both the society and the individual.
In turn, obviously, the establishment of schools of revolu
tion would be unlikely (though legal), for they would
promote undesirable values. The critical difference is not
whether the University intends to promote social values but
which ones it seeks to promote.
Let us address the "free choice" objection. We do not
deny that some educational value does inhere sometimes,
perhaps even most times, in free choice itself, for the fact of
free choice may compel reflection and lead to judicious
action. But often the small increment of value may be
outweighed by the great harm of particular decisions. For
example, selection of the Indian symbol, so offensive to
native Americans, is one example of possible harm outweigh
ing the benefit of choice.

such action. Instead, as we understand their logic, each team,

about the Indian symbol because there will be greater
educational value in this exercise of free choice.

imposition of educational area distribution requirements.
These educational requirements do restrict free choice by
compelling students to take some courses in areas that they

then make individual arrangements with such employers.

the "free choice" advocates seek to achieve and that wc
endorse.
We do not believe that the proposed change in policy will

or unable to agree to a policy of nondiscrimination on the

group primarily served-the students.
The career planning and placement services have resisted
occasional attempts to be used as explicit instruments of
social change. Many students will consider a wide variety of
career options during their time at Stanford, a process which
will often lead them to discover a number of unimagined
alternatives and ultimately the rejection of more alternatives
than are kept as "live" options.
This is an educationally useful process, but one which
requires free access to many choices; an access unmarrcd by
political tests, censured career libraries, or by a list of firms
that are "forbidden at Stanford" for reasons of contrariness
to some political or social philosophy dominating career and
recruiting facibties at Stanford.
In short, Stanford's career planning and placement facili
ties have tried to maximize students' choices, not limit them;
and to help the individual student to make choices rather
than to choose for the student by elimination of lawful but
unpopular choice alternatives.
The University advocates the exercise of informed choice,
of the use of the intellect in the proccss of choosing an area
of employment or a particular employer. Our career planning
activities, therefore, are aimed towards helping students
discover and weigh information about areas of employment
and particular employers and to help them identify and relate
their own needs and interests to this information.
The University is also committed to helping students and
potential employers identify and distinguish between infor
mation which is job-related and that which is not.
We can and should help employers and potential em
ployees provide each other with information to help assess
predicted job performance and job expectations, and discour
age the use of information that transcends the boundaries of
job-relatedness and intrudes into areas of privacy and person
al circumstance.
Information that is usually suspect of being not job-re
lated is often associated with race, national origin, religion,
sex, sexual preferences and activities, marital status, political
and social beliefs, certain specific medical conditions, and
family background.
If employers seek such information from candidates, or
use such information if otherwise discoVered, Stanford stu
dents should reasonably expect employers to be open about
such use, to explain the job-relatedness of such information,
and to be clear and open about the criteria they will use in
hiring and promotion.
11. A Positive Commitment for the University and
Employers
(Approved unanimously)
The Gay People's Union at Stanford has emphasized that
homosexual students have comc to fear invidious discrimina
tion in the employment process. This fear is dehumanizing
and may be a significant handicap in the job-seeking process.
In recent years employers have comc to recognize the
need for full, precise, and open job descriptions. A growing
number of employers have realized that many personal
characteristics previously assumed to be job-related arc not.
We believe that students should be able to know if
companies regard personal characteristics which are usually
regarded as private, such as religion, sexual preference, or
political belief, to be job-related, and thus form a basis for
hiring, work assignment, and promotions. We also believe
that students should know if companies have or do not have
specific policies about such matters, and if so, what those
policies arc. (See Section III)
Our several career planning and placement services should
find ways that will encourage recruiting organizations to be
sensitive to such matters if they are not so already, and to
establish policies that make clear employee selection criteria
as they pertain to personal characteristics.
Wc therefore recommend:
I. That a statement by the University similar to the
following be included in communications with potential

recruiters using our facilities. "Though not compelled by
law, Stanford University wishes to avoid discrimination
on the basis of sexual preference in its own promotion
and hiring policies and urges employers using our facilities
to follow similar practices."
(The Committee believed that Stanford should assess its
own employment policies regarding homosexuals. It is
however, beyond the purview of our committee to deter
mine what that explicit and expressed policy should be.)
2. that steps be taken to involve homosexual students
and staff directly in the career planning and placement
processes and enlist their help in Finding more effective
ways for employers and applicants to deal with the feeling
invoked by the term "homosexual" when it arises in the
selections proccss.
///. A Statement of Policy from Employers
(Approved by a vote of 6 to 1 with 2 absent)
We recommend that employers using University facilities
be required to answer the question, "In your hiring and
promotion policies and practices do you discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation?"
The Committee was split on the issue of whether to
encourage or to require employers to respond to the above
question. The dissenting member accepted this section where
such a question would be encouraged rather than required.
Also, deans of some schools may feel that the proper way to
get at the spirit of this issue is through a different phrasing. If
so, wc ask the suggested changes or revisions be presented to
the Dean of Student Affairs.)
Requiring employers to answer the above question is
consistent with the philosophy underlying career placement
at Stanford. The University believes that students should be
precisely informed about all policies which might affect their
interests, in order that they can adequately judge with whom
they should seek employment.
The simplest way for students to receive employment
related information of concern to them is by asking an
interviewer directly. Students can ask interviewers questions
concerning most aspects of employment without adversely
affecting their job placement prospects.
With regard to sexual orientation however, students
making inquiries are likely to be perceived by the inter
viewers as being homosexual, which may prejudice their
employment. Being justificably afraid of jeopardizing their
job-placement chances, few gay students are willing to breach
the subject of sexual orientation with prospective employers.
In addition, some of Stanford's gay graduates may un
knowingly begin their careers in organizations whose policies
and practices are repugnant to their own. Requiring employ
ment statements to promote full employment disclosure
concerning sexual orientation would be an important step
toward a remedy.
Students who are not gay would also benefit from the
procedure this committee has called for. Many students,
while not themselves injured by discrimination on the basis
of sexual preference, morally object to hiring and advance
ment criteria not related to job performance.
Employers' statements concerning sexual orientation in
hiring and promotion will provide all students with useful
information concerning what different organizations consider
to be important.
The Committee does not believe that requesting em
ployers' statements would provide a panacea for discrimina
tion on the basis of sexual preference. Many employers will
claim that they do not discriminate, whereas in fact they do;
many Stanford graduates will remain "closet homosexuals"
regardless of employment prospects, for social and family
reasons.
Nevertheless, the procedure our committee has called for
will assist some Stanford students in contributing to the
limits of their capacities without fear that their sexual
preference will hinder them. At the very least, adoption of
this proposal will demonstrate that Stanford is willing to take
a substantial step towards helping its students make truly free
and informed choices.
IV. Section A: Employers Who Do Discriminate
Should Be Banned
(The Committee was exactly split on the issue of whether
to ban employers who discriminated on the basis of sexual
preference from using Stanford facilities.
(Despite our inability to agree on a specific recommendat
ion, we have presented the arguments on both sides of the
issue. See Section IVB. This project was to some extent to
foster greater discussion of these issues. Our arguments may
also benefit future study on this or similar issues.
(Vote: 3 for section IVA, 3 for section IVB, I abstention,
I absent.)
Position A: We believe that Stanford University has an
oblijption to deny use of its placement facilities to employers
who discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.
Such discrimination is abhorrent to gay students, faculty,
and staff, as well as to many other members of the University
community. If the University does not bar such employers, it
is in effect acceding to a policy of cruel and debilitating
discrimination directed against some of its more vulnerable
students.
Stanford should not permit itself to be used to perpetuate
discrimination against gay persons. Discrimination on the
basis of sexual preference seems to us, in principle, equivalent
to discrimination on the basis of religion, sex, and color. In
each case, such discrimination is based usually on invidious
distinctions and denies to substantial numbers equal opportu
nity and, often, humane treatment.
Opponents of our recommendation for a change in policy
have raised various principled objections, and the more
important arguments are reducible to two:
The first is that the University has barred employers who
discriminate on the basis of religion, sex, and color only
because of federal law; that the present case reaches beyond
the requirement of the law to have the University promote
social values; and that the University should not seek to act
to promote social values.
The second is that the University should allow students
free choice to make their own decisions (e.g., whether or not
to interview with a discriminatory firm) because the exercise

of such choice contributes significantly to education.
These arguments seem dubious, neglect important pre
cendents, and rest often, at critical junctures, upon incorrect
assumptions about the activities of the University.
Let us first address the "promoting social value" objec
tion. We believe that the University has acted, and has often
sought to act, in many important ways that promote partic
ular social values-whether to maintain or alter the society.
Probably no institution, by its decisions and actions, can
avoid influencing values and promoting or altering them;
certainly, that is dramatically true in the case of a major
institution such as Stanford, which has considerable impact
upon various groups and localities by its decisions on, for
example, land use, investment policies, and admissions poli
cies.
Whether Stanford decides to rent land to the highest
bidder and/or to support low-cost housing for some disadvan
taged peoples, the University is, intentionally or not, pro
moting certain social values. In some notable cases, including
recent efforts for low-cost housing, the University formulated
policy with the explicit intention of promoting particular
social values.
Let us look briefly at the area of admissions policy for
additional evidence on this matter. In the past eight to 10
years, for various social reasons, the University has chosen, at
times, to increase the number of minority students in the
student body.
Such decisions for preferential admissions were based,
often self-consciously, upon larger social considerations: the
duties of a University to the society; the need to provide
greater opportunity to members of some racial minorities;
the desirability of promoting racial integration and of stifling
social disruptions. Such commitments were not required by
law, and they marked a departure from Stanford's earlier
policies.
We cite these changes in admissions policies to establish
the proposition that the University has acted, in important
matters, without the requirement of law to promote particu
lar social values.
In actual practices, of course, the University promotes
values in other more subtle and possibly more fundamental
ways. Consider, for example, the University's commitment to
a business school or a law school. Such a major financial
commitment assumes 'hat "doing" law or business is desir
able, that it promotes desirable social values, and that it
usually serves both the society and the individual.
In turn, obviously, the establishment of schools of revolu
tion would be unlikely (though legal), for they would
promote undesirable values. The critical difference is not
whether the University intends to promote social values but
which ones it seeks to promote.
Let us address the "free choice" objection. We do not
deny that some educational value does inhere sometimes,
perhaps even most times, in free choice itself, for the fact of
free choice may compel reflection and lead to judicious
action. But often the small increment of value may be
outweighed by the great harm of particular decisions. For
example, selection of the Indian symbol, so offensive to
native Americans, is one example of possible harm outweigh
ing the benefit of choice.
The administration wisely decided to eliminate the Indian
symbol because it offended native Americans. Under the
Committee's minority contention, which we reject, it would
seem to follow that the administration should not have taken
such action. Instead, as we understand their logic, each team,
or class, or appropriate group should make a new decision
about the Indian symbol because there will be greater
educational value in this exercise of free choice.
A closer analogy to the case before us might be the
imposition of educational area distribution requirements.
These educational requirements do restrict free choice by
compelling students to take some courses in areas that they
might otherwise disregard or avoid. In most cases, it appears,
students benefit educationally from these requirements, even
though they do not experience the real possibility of free
choice.
The proposed ban of employers who discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation might operate in roughly analo
gous fashion for students. They arc not being denied the
opportunity to seek interviews with these employers. Instead,
students will have to think carefully about the situation and
then make individual arrangements with such employers.
Perhaps this small difficulty will inspire students to think
very carefully about the exercise of their choice-a goal that
the "free choice" advocates seek to achieve and that wc
endorse.
We do not believe that the proposed change in policy will
bar many employers or significantly affect job opportunities
for students. Ten years ago, and maybe even two or three
years ago, most major employers might have been unwilling
or unable to agree to a policy of nondiscrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation.
Recent declarations by AT &. T and other major firms
indicate a shift in values and standards, and wc anticipate a
continuation of this trend. Our policy, in most cases, will
simply speed the trend.
Reccnt decisions by the military services indicate, unless
there is a reversal of these decisions by the administration or
the courts, that the American military may be the notable
exception. There is some likelikhood that it may revise policy
in the next decade, but we do not foresee a reversal in the
next few years.
Since federal regulations do not allow some federal
agencies (NASA, DOD, and FRDA, among others) to con
tract with universities that ban military recruiting, and our
proposed policy would have the effect of banning such
recruiting, the University would lose some contracts and
(according to Frank Riddle) about $4.75 million in unrestric
ted funds.
We could uneasily countenance the loss of these funds
and would urge the President to act in the moral merits of
the issues without consideration of the financial problems.
Such counsel may be easier to give than to receive, and wc
recognize that it is unlikely that the President will be willing
to take such action and to plunge the University more deeply
into annual deficits at this time.

As a result, we suggest an uneasy, but not altogether
unsatisfactory compromise. If the main objection to our
proposed policy is that it cannot be imposed on the military
because of the great financial cost, why not be explicit about
this objection and impose the policy in those other areas
where the likely financial cost is nonexistent or minimal''
Such a decision by the University would be a useful
admission that the University, whatever its commitment to
humane values, must operate in an arena of realism where
financial considerations heavily influence policy and choice.
We may regret the fact of such pressures, but we do not
believe that universities arc free.
IV. Section B. Employers Who Discriminate Should
Not Be Banned
(For vote, see Sec. IVA, above)
Stanford's career planning and placement services exist to
respond to the expressed needs of individual students. Uni
versity placement facilities are therefore made available to
any student who wishes to see any prospective employer. The
only valid exceptions are those based upon sound academic
reason or legal requirement. (See Dean Thomas Ehrlich's
memorandum, Oct. 28, 1975).
The Gay People's Union proposal meets neither criterion,
yet they have asked the University to impose the CPU's
moral judgment on all students using the career information
service. Indeed, the University has judiciously avoided
applying any political, moral, or social test to the CPPC.
To the extent that the career planning and placement
service hopes to respond to the expressed needs of each
student it can never succumb to the will of a minority or to
the tyranny of the majority. Every student must be guaran
teed access to the CPPC; information concerning any business
must be made available to him or her.
The University is obligated to safeguard the right of each
student to make and exercise moral decisions. (It is unjust to
members of the Stanford community to deny them access to
job opportunities without their consent. Certainly, the CPU's
hope is to influence firms by denying them access to
Stanford students; the same result, however, can be achieved
by each Stanford student voluntarily deciding not to seek
employment with a discriminating firm.)
If the goal of the GPU is to protect its members from
malicious and discriminatory hiring, then it should seek the
dissemination of information on hiring and promotion poli
cies. By requiring the firms to make this information freely
available, each student can decide whether to seek employ
ment with a firm that may or may not claim to discriminate.
The proposed exclusion of firms that discriminate on the
basis of sexual preferences or affection would retard the
honest relay of information.
Since no statistical check exists through which a firm's
actual hiring and promotion policies can be evaluated, and
the penalties for claiming to discriminate are so high, good
financial incentives exist for employers to transmit informa
tion less than honestly.
If the goal of the CPU's request, however, is to influence
social mores through utilization of a service to students, then
they infringe on the rights of other students to make moral
decisions. Students would then have their moral actions
heavily influenced by University policy. No matter that we
agree with the moral judgment; we disagree with the direct
consequences of the advocated policy: the denial of each
student's freedom to make his own moral selections.
Sexual preference or affection should not be considered
within the same context as race, color, religion, sex, and
national origin as advocated by the GPU. This listing is used
to demark minority populations; positive employment pro
grams are created for minority communities defined by race,
color, religion, sex, and national origin. It is to the disadvan
tage of existing minority populations to expand the list.
The precedent set by linking sexual preference or affec
tion to race, color, religion, sex, and national origin could, in
time, lead to efforts to establish affirmative action policies
for gay people.
There exist two additional interesting, albeit not compel
ling, reasons not to ban sexually discriminating firms from
the CPPC:
First, the labor market conditions that allow discrimina
tion against gay people arc identical to the conditions
necessary for discrimination against minorities; the problem
lies in lack of free-market competition. Enforcement of the
GPU request would limit the number of interviewing firms at
Stanford. Unfortunately any reduction in the number of
interviewing firms most directly harms the minority appli
cant.
Second, an inevitable consequence of enforcement of the
proposed ban is to remove military recruiting from Stanford.
The dire consequences of this are delineated in I rank
Riddle's memo of Dec. 5, 1975. (See Sec. / VA, above)

Following is a copy of a report on "Placement Services
Policy Recommendations" sent to Stanford President
Richard W. Lyman Feb. 11, 1976 by the Committee on
Services to Students. Deans of the seven schools, Career
Planning and Placement Center Director Ralph Keller, and
other officers directly affected will be asked to send any
comments they may have on the recommendations to James
Lyons, dean of student affairs. He will forward these,
together with his own recommendations, to Lyman before
the President acts on the report.
/. Summary of Current Placement Services Philo
sophies
The keystone of the philosophy of career planning and
placement services at Stanford is student centeredness. These
services exist to respond primarily to the expressed needs of
individual students.
To the extent that those needs are served well the
University is also benefited. The programs of individual
schools or departments are undoubtedly more enticing when
their students have good job opportunities to choose from
and when the students make wise and informed choices.
Other secondary beneficiaries of a good career planning
and placement program are alumni, who can make continued
use of the several placement services on campus. They are
served better by an active and well-organized program.
However, the primary efforts of the career planning and
placement services of Stanford are directed toward the career
planning and placement needs of the individual student.
There are some objectives that are not associated with
career planning and placement services at Stanford. The
University has in recent years avoided applying political or
social tests in the career information or placement processes,
except when mandated to do so by law.
(No one, including CPPC Director Ralph Keller, has been
able to inform the Committee of practices preceeding the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its interpretation by the courts
and applications by the Government.)
Nor are our services run for the primary benefit of,
industry, governmental agencies, schools and colleges, or
other social institutions. If such groups happen to be well
served by Stanford's career planning and placement services,
it is because of a congruence of need or interest with the
group primarily served-the students.
The career planning and placement services have resisted
occasional attempts to be used as explicit instruments of
social change. Many students will consider a wide variety of
career options during their time at Stanford, a process which
will often lead them to discover a number of unimagined
alternatives and ultimately the rejection of more alternatives
than are kept as "live" options.
This is an educationally useful process, but one which
requires free access to many choices; an access unmarrcd by
political tests, censured career libraries, or by a list of firms
that are "forbidden at Stanford" for reasons of contrariness
to some political or social philosophy dominating career and
recruiting facibties at Stanford.
In short, Stanford's career planning and placement facili
ties have tried to maximize students' choices, not limit them;
and to help the individual student to make choices rather
than to choose for the student by elimination of lawful but
unpopular choice alternatives.
The University advocates the exercise of informed choice,
of the use of the intellect in the proccss of choosing an area
of employment or a particular employer. Our career planning
activities, therefore, are aimed towards helping students
discover and weigh information about areas of employment
and particular employers and to help them identify and relate
their own needs and interests to this information.
The University is also committed to helping students and
potential employers identify and distinguish between infor
mation which is job-related and that which is not.
We can and should help employers and potential em
ployees provide each other with information to help assess
predicted job performance and job expectations, and discour
age the use of information that transcends the boundaries of
job-relatedness and intrudes into areas of privacy and person
al circumstance.
Information that is usually suspect of being not job-re
lated is often associated with race, national origin, religion,
sex, sexual preferences and activities, marital status, political
and social beliefs, certain specific medical conditions, and
family background.
If employers seek such information from candidates, or
use such information if otherwise discoVered, Stanford stu
dents should reasonably expect employers to be open about
such use, to explain the job-relatedness of such information,
and to be clear and open about the criteria they will use in
hiring and promotion.

deny that some educational value does inhere sometimes,
perhaps even most times, in free choice itself, for the fact of
free choice may compel reflection and lead to judicious
action. But often the small increment of value may be
outweighed by the great harm of particular decisions. For
example, selection of the Indian symbol, so offensive to
native Americans, is one example of possible harm outweigh
ing the benefit of choice.
The administration wisely decided to eliminate the Indian
symbol because it offended native Americans. Under the
Committee's minority contention, which we reject, it would
seem to follow that the administration should not have taken
such action. Instead, as we understand their logic, each team,
or class, or appropriate group should make a new decision
about the Indian symbol because there will be greater
educational value in this exercise of free choice.
A closer analogy to the case before us might be the
imposition of educational area distribution requirements.
These educational requirements do restrict free choice by
compelling students to take some courses in areas that they
might otherwise disregard or avoid. In most cases, it appears,
students benefit educationally from these requirements, even
though they do not experience the real possibility of free
choice.
The proposed ban of employers who discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation might operate in roughly analo
gous fashion for students. They arc not being denied the
opportunity to seek interviews with these employers. Instead,
students will have to think carefully about the situation and
then make individual arrangements with such employers.
Perhaps this small difficulty will inspire students to think
very carefully about the exercise of their choice-a goal that
the "free choice" advocates seek to achieve and that wc
endorse.
We do not believe that the proposed change in policy will
bar many employers or significantly affect job opportunities
for students. Ten years ago, and maybe even two or three
years ago, most major employers might have been unwilling
or unable to agree to a policy of nondiscrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation.
Recent declarations by AT &. T and other major firms
indicate a shift in values and standards, and wc anticipate a
continuation of this trend. Our policy, in most cases, will
simply speed the trend.
Reccnt decisions by the military services indicate, unless
there is a reversal of these decisions by the administration or
the courts, that the American military may be the notable
exception. There is some likelikhood that it may revise policy
in the next decade, but we do not foresee a reversal in the
next few years.
Since federal regulations do not allow some federal
agencies (NASA, DOD, and FRDA, among others) to con
tract with universities that ban military recruiting, and our
proposed policy would have the effect of banning such
recruiting, the University would lose some contracts and
(according to Frank Riddle) about $4.75 million in unrestric
ted funds.
We could uneasily countenance the loss of these funds
and would urge the President to act in the moral merits of
the issues without consideration of the financial problems.
Such counsel may be easier to give than to receive, and wc
recognize that it is unlikely that the President will be willing
to take such action and to plunge the University more deeply
into annual deficits at this time.

As a result, we suggest an uneasy, but not altogether
unsatisfactory compromise. If the main objection to our
proposed policy is that it cannot be imposed on the military
because of the great financial cost, why not be explicit about
this objection and impose the policy in those other areas
where the likely financial cost is nonexistent or minimal''
Such a decision by the University would be a useful
admission that the University, whatever its commitment to
humane values, must operate in an arena of realism where
financial considerations heavily influence policy and choice.
We may regret the fact of such pressures, but we do not
believe that universities arc free.
IV. Section B. Employers Who Discriminate Should
Not Be Banned
(For vote, see Sec. IVA, above)
Stanford's career planning and placement services exist to
respond to the expressed needs of individual students. Uni
versity placement facilities are therefore made available to
any student who wishes to see any prospective employer. The
only valid exceptions are those based upon sound academic
reason or legal requirement. (See Dean Thomas Ehrlich's
memorandum, Oct. 28, 1975).
The Gay People's Union proposal meets neither criterion,
yet they have asked the University to impose the CPU's
moral judgment on all students using the career information
service. Indeed, the University has judiciously avoided
applying any political, moral, or social test to the CPPC.
To the extent that the career planning and placement
service hopes to respond to the expressed needs of each
student it can never succumb to the will of a minority or to
the tyranny of the majority. Every student must be guaran
teed access to the CPPC; information concerning any business
must be made available to him or her.
The University is obligated to safeguard the right of each
student to make and exercise moral decisions. (It is unjust to
members of the Stanford community to deny them access to
job opportunities without their consent. Certainly, the CPU's
hope is to influence firms by denying them access to
Stanford students; the same result, however, can be achieved
by each Stanford student voluntarily deciding not to seek
employment with a discriminating firm.)
If the goal of the GPU is to protect its members from
malicious and discriminatory hiring, then it should seek the
dissemination of information on hiring and promotion poli
cies. By requiring the firms to make this information freely
available, each student can decide whether to seek employ
ment with a firm that may or may not claim to discriminate.
The proposed exclusion of firms that discriminate on the
basis of sexual preferences or affection would retard the
honest relay of information.
Since no statistical check exists through which a firm's
actual hiring and promotion policies can be evaluated, and
the penalties for claiming to discriminate are so high, good
financial incentives exist for employers to transmit informa
tion less than honestly.
If the goal of the CPU's request, however, is to influence
social mores through utilization of a service to students, then
they infringe on the rights of other students to make moral
decisions. Students would then have their moral actions
heavily influenced by University policy. No matter that we
agree with the moral judgment; we disagree with the direct
consequences of the advocated policy: the denial of each
student's freedom to make his own moral selections.
Sexual preference or affection should not be considered
within the same context as race, color, religion, sex, and
national origin as advocated by the GPU. This listing is used
to demark minority populations; positive employment pro
grams are created for minority communities defined by race,
color, religion, sex, and national origin. It is to the disadvan
tage of existing minority populations to expand the list.
The precedent set by linking sexual preference or affec
tion to race, color, religion, sex, and national origin could, in
time, lead to efforts to establish affirmative action policies
for gay people.
There exist two additional interesting, albeit not compel
ling, reasons not to ban sexually discriminating firms from
the CPPC:
First, the labor market conditions that allow discrimina
tion against gay people arc identical to the conditions
necessary for discrimination against minorities; the problem
lies in lack of free-market competition. Enforcement of the
GPU request would limit the number of interviewing firms at
Stanford. Unfortunately any reduction in the number of
interviewing firms most directly harms the minority appli
cant.
Second, an inevitable consequence of enforcement of the
proposed ban is to remove military recruiting from Stanford.
The dire consequences of this are delineated in I rank
Riddle's memo of Dec. 5, 1975. (See Sec. / VA, above)

Following is a copy of a report on "Placement Services
Policy Recommendations" sent to Stanford President
Richard W. Lyman Feb. 11, 1976 by the Committee on
Services to Students. Deans of the seven schools, Career
Planning and Placement Center Director Ralph Keller, and
other officers directly affected will be asked to send any
comments they may have on the recommendations to James
Lyons, dean of student affairs. He will forward these,
together with his own recommendations, to Lyman before
the President acts on the report.
/. Summary of Current Placement Services Philo
sophies
The keystone of the philosophy of career planning and
placement services at Stanford is student centeredness. These
services exist to respond primarily to the expressed needs of
individual students.
To the extent that those needs are served well the
University is also benefited. The programs of individual
schools or departments are undoubtedly more enticing when
their students have good job opportunities to choose from
and when the students make wise and informed choices.
Other secondary beneficiaries of a good career planning
and placement program are alumni, who can make continued
use of the several placement services on campus. They are
served better by an active and well-organized program.
However, the primary efforts of the career planning and
placement services of Stanford are directed toward the career
planning and placement needs of the individual student.
There are some objectives that are not associated with
career planning and placement services at Stanford. The
University has in recent years avoided applying political or
social tests in the career information or placement processes,
except when mandated to do so by law.
(No one, including CPPC Director Ralph Keller, has been
able to inform the Committee of practices preceeding the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its interpretation by the courts
and applications by the Government.)
Nor are our services run for the primary benefit of,
industry, governmental agencies, schools and colleges, or
other social institutions. If such groups happen to be well
served by Stanford's career planning and placement services,
it is because of a congruence of need or interest with the
group primarily served-the students.
The career planning and placement services have resisted
occasional attempts to be used as explicit instruments of
social change. Many students will consider a wide variety of
career options during their time at Stanford, a process which
will often lead them to discover a number of unimagined
alternatives and ultimately the rejection of more alternatives
than are kept as "live" options.
This is an educationally useful process, but one which
requires free access to many choices; an access unmarrcd by
political tests, censured career libraries, or by a list of firms
that are "forbidden at Stanford" for reasons of contrariness
to some political or social philosophy dominating career and
recruiting facibties at Stanford.
In short, Stanford's career planning and placement facili
ties have tried to maximize students' choices, not limit them;
and to help the individual student to make choices rather
than to choose for the student by elimination of lawful but
unpopular choice alternatives.
The University advocates the exercise of informed choice,
of the use of the intellect in the proccss of choosing an area
of employment or a particular employer. Our career planning
activities, therefore, are aimed towards helping students
discover and weigh information about areas of employment
and particular employers and to help them identify and relate
their own needs and interests to this information.
The University is also committed to helping students and
potential employers identify and distinguish between infor
mation which is job-related and that which is not.
We can and should help employers and potential em
ployees provide each other with information to help assess
predicted job performance and job expectations, and discour
age the use of information that transcends the boundaries of
job-relatedness and intrudes into areas of privacy and person
al circumstance.
Information that is usually suspect of being not job-re
lated is often associated with race, national origin, religion,
sex, sexual preferences and activities, marital status, political
and social beliefs, certain specific medical conditions, and
family background.
If employers seek such information from candidates, or
use such information if otherwise discoVered, Stanford stu
dents should reasonably expect employers to be open about
such use, to explain the job-relatedness of such information,
and to be clear and open about the criteria they will use in
hiring and promotion.
11. A Positive Commitment for the University and
Employers
(Approved unanimously)
The Gay People's Union at Stanford has emphasized that
homosexual students have comc to fear invidious discrimina
tion in the employment process. This fear is dehumanizing
and may be a significant handicap in the job-seeking process.
In recent years employers have comc to recognize the
need for full, precise, and open job descriptions. A growing
number of employers have realized that many personal
characteristics previously assumed to be job-related arc not.
We believe that students should be able to know if
companies regard personal characteristics which are usually
regarded as private, such as religion, sexual preference, or
political belief, to be job-related, and thus form a basis for
hiring, work assignment, and promotions. We also believe
that students should know if companies have or do not have
specific policies about such matters, and if so, what those
policies arc. (See Section III)
Our several career planning and placement services should
find ways that will encourage recruiting organizations to be
sensitive to such matters if they are not so already, and to
establish policies that make clear employee selection criteria
as they pertain to personal characteristics.
Wc therefore recommend:
I. That a statement by the University similar to the
following be included in communications with potential

recruiters using our facilities. "Though not compelled by
law, Stanford University wishes to avoid discrimination
on the basis of sexual preference in its own promotion
and hiring policies and urges employers using our facilities
to follow similar practices."
(The Committee believed that Stanford should assess its
own employment policies regarding homosexuals. It is
however, beyond the purview of our committee to deter
mine what that explicit and expressed policy should be.)
2. that steps be taken to involve homosexual students
and staff directly in the career planning and placement
processes and enlist their help in Finding more effective
ways for employers and applicants to deal with the feeling
invoked by the term "homosexual" when it arises in the
selections proccss.
///. A Statement of Policy from Employers
(Approved by a vote of 6 to 1 with 2 absent)
We recommend that employers using University facilities
be required to answer the question, "In your hiring and
promotion policies and practices do you discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation?"
The Committee was split on the issue of whether to
encourage or to require employers to respond to the above
question. The dissenting member accepted this section where
such a question would be encouraged rather than required.
Also, deans of some schools may feel that the proper way to
get at the spirit of this issue is through a different phrasing. If
so, wc ask the suggested changes or revisions be presented to
the Dean of Student Affairs.)
Requiring employers to answer the above question is
consistent with the philosophy underlying career placement
at Stanford. The University believes that students should be
precisely informed about all policies which might affect their
interests, in order that they can adequately judge with whom
they should seek employment.
The simplest way for students to receive employment
related information of concern to them is by asking an
interviewer directly. Students can ask interviewers questions
concerning most aspects of employment without adversely
affecting their job placement prospects.
With regard to sexual orientation however, students
making inquiries are likely to be perceived by the inter
viewers as being homosexual, which may prejudice their
employment. Being justificably afraid of jeopardizing their
job-placement chances, few gay students are willing to breach
the subject of sexual orientation with prospective employers.
In addition, some of Stanford's gay graduates may un
knowingly begin their careers in organizations whose policies
and practices are repugnant to their own. Requiring employ
ment statements to promote full employment disclosure
concerning sexual orientation would be an important step
toward a remedy.
Students who are not gay would also benefit from the
procedure this committee has called for. Many students,
while not themselves injured by discrimination on the basis
of sexual preference, morally object to hiring and advance
ment criteria not related to job performance.
Employers' statements concerning sexual orientation in
hiring and promotion will provide all students with useful
information concerning what different organizations consider
to be important.
The Committee does not believe that requesting em
ployers' statements would provide a panacea for discrimina
tion on the basis of sexual preference. Many employers will
claim that they do not discriminate, whereas in fact they do;
many Stanford graduates will remain "closet homosexuals"
regardless of employment prospects, for social and family
reasons.
Nevertheless, the procedure our committee has called for
will assist some Stanford students in contributing to the
limits of their capacities without fear that their sexual
preference will hinder them. At the very least, adoption of
this proposal will demonstrate that Stanford is willing to take
a substantial step towards helping its students make truly free
and informed choices.
IV. Section A: Employers Who Do Discriminate
Should Be Banned
(The Committee was exactly split on the issue of whether
to ban employers who discriminated on the basis of sexual
preference from using Stanford facilities.
(Despite our inability to agree on a specific recommendat
ion, we have presented the arguments on both sides of the
issue. See Section IVB. This project was to some extent to
foster greater discussion of these issues. Our arguments may
also benefit future study on this or similar issues.
(Vote: 3 for section IVA, 3 for section IVB, I abstention,
I absent.)
Position A: We believe that Stanford University has an
oblijption to deny use of its placement facilities to employers
who discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.
Such discrimination is abhorrent to gay students, faculty,
and staff, as well as to many other members of the University
community. If the University does not bar such employers, it
is in effect acceding to a policy of cruel and debilitating
discrimination directed against some of its more vulnerable
students.
Stanford should not permit itself to be used to perpetuate
discrimination against gay persons. Discrimination on the
basis of sexual preference seems to us, in principle, equivalent
to discrimination on the basis of religion, sex, and color. In
each case, such discrimination is based usually on invidious
distinctions and denies to substantial numbers equal opportu
nity and, often, humane treatment.
Opponents of our recommendation for a change in policy
have raised various principled objections, and the more
important arguments are reducible to two:
The first is that the University has barred employers who
discriminate on the basis of religion, sex, and color only
because of federal law; that the present case reaches beyond
the requirement of the law to have the University promote
social values; and that the University should not seek to act
to promote social values.
The second is that the University should allow students
free choice to make their own decisions (e.g., whether or not
to interview with a discriminatory firm) because the exercise

of such choice contributes significantly to education.
These arguments seem dubious, neglect important pre
cendents, and rest often, at critical junctures, upon incorrect
assumptions about the activities of the University.
Let us first address the "promoting social value" objec
tion. We believe that the University has acted, and has often
sought to act, in many important ways that promote partic
ular social values-whether to maintain or alter the society.
Probably no institution, by its decisions and actions, can
avoid influencing values and promoting or altering them;
certainly, that is dramatically true in the case of a major
institution such as Stanford, which has considerable impact
upon various groups and localities by its decisions on, for
example, land use, investment policies, and admissions poli
cies.
Whether Stanford decides to rent land to the highest
bidder and/or to support low-cost housing for some disadvan
taged peoples, the University is, intentionally or not, pro
moting certain social values. In some notable cases, including
recent efforts for low-cost housing, the University formulated
policy with the explicit intention of promoting particular
social values.
Let us look briefly at the area of admissions policy for
additional evidence on this matter. In the past eight to 10
years, for various social reasons, the University has chosen, at
times, to increase the number of minority students in the
student body.
Such decisions for preferential admissions were based,
often self-consciously, upon larger social considerations: the
duties of a University to the society; the need to provide
greater opportunity to members of some racial minorities;
the desirability of promoting racial integration and of stifling
social disruptions. Such commitments were not required by
law, and they marked a departure from Stanford's earlier
policies.
We cite these changes in admissions policies to establish
the proposition that the University has acted, in important
matters, without the requirement of law to promote particu
lar social values.
In actual practices, of course, the University promotes
values in other more subtle and possibly more fundamental
ways. Consider, for example, the University's commitment to
a business school or a law school. Such a major financial
commitment assumes 'hat "doing" law or business is desir
able, that it promotes desirable social values, and that it
usually serves both the society and the individual.
In turn, obviously, the establishment of schools of revolu
tion would be unlikely (though legal), for they would
promote undesirable values. The critical difference is not
whether the University intends to promote social values but
which ones it seeks to promote.
Let us address the "free choice" objection. We do not
deny that some educational value does inhere sometimes,
perhaps even most times, in free choice itself, for the fact of
free choice may compel reflection and lead to judicious
action. But often the small increment of value may be
outweighed by the great harm of particular decisions. For
example, selection of the Indian symbol, so offensive to
native Americans, is one example of possible harm outweigh
ing the benefit of choice.
The administration wisely decided to eliminate the Indian
symbol because it offended native Americans. Under the
Committee's minority contention, which we reject, it would
seem to follow that the administration should not have taken
such action. Instead, as we understand their logic, each team,
or class, or appropriate group should make a new decision
about the Indian symbol because there will be greater
educational value in this exercise of free choice.
A closer analogy to the case before us might be the
imposition of educational area distribution requirements.
These educational requirements do restrict free choice by
compelling students to take some courses in areas that they
might otherwise disregard or avoid. In most cases, it appears,
students benefit educationally from these requirements, even
though they do not experience the real possibility of free
choice.
The proposed ban of employers who discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation might operate in roughly analo
gous fashion for students. They arc not being denied the
opportunity to seek interviews with these employers. Instead,
students will have to think carefully about the situation and
then make individual arrangements with such employers.
Perhaps this small difficulty will inspire students to think
very carefully about the exercise of their choice-a goal that
the "free choice" advocates seek to achieve and that wc
endorse.
We do not believe that the proposed change in policy will
bar many employers or significantly affect job opportunities
for students. Ten years ago, and maybe even two or three
years ago, most major employers might have been unwilling
or unable to agree to a policy of nondiscrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation.

there is a reversal of these decisions by the administration or
the courts, that the American military may be the notable
exception. There is some likelikhood that it may revise policy
in the next decade, but we do not foresee a reversal in the
next few years.
Since federal regulations do not allow some federal
agencies (NASA, DOD, and FRDA, among others) to con
tract with universities that ban military recruiting, and our

(according to Frank Riddle) about $4.75 million in unrestric

of the use of the intellect in the proccss of choosing an area
of employment or a particular employer. Our career planning
activities, therefore, are aimed towards helping students
discover and weigh information about areas of employment
and particular employers and to help them identify and relate
their own needs and interests to this information.
The University is also committed to helping students and
potential employers identify and distinguish between infor
mation which is job-related and that which is not.
We can and should help employers and potential em
ployees provide each other with information to help assess
predicted job performance and job expectations, and discour
age the use of information that transcends the boundaries of
job-relatedness and intrudes into areas of privacy and person
al circumstance.
Information that is usually suspect of being not job-re
lated is often associated with race, national origin, religion,
sex, sexual preferences and activities, marital status, political
and social beliefs, certain specific medical conditions, and
family background.
If employers seek such information from candidates, or
use such information if otherwise discoVered, Stanford stu
dents should reasonably expect employers to be open about
such use, to explain the job-relatedness of such information,
and to be clear and open about the criteria they will use in
hiring and promotion.
11. A Positive Commitment for the University and
Employers
(Approved unanimously)
The Gay People's Union at Stanford has emphasized that
homosexual students have comc to fear invidious discrimina
tion in the employment process. This fear is dehumanizing
and may be a significant handicap in the job-seeking process.
In recent years employers have comc to recognize the
need for full, precise, and open job descriptions. A growing
number of employers have realized that many personal
characteristics previously assumed to be job-related arc not.
We believe that students should be able to know if
companies regard personal characteristics which are usually
regarded as private, such as religion, sexual preference, or
political belief, to be job-related, and thus form a basis for
hiring, work assignment, and promotions. We also believe
that students should know if companies have or do not have
specific policies about such matters, and if so, what those
policies arc. (See Section III)
Our several career planning and placement services should
find ways that will encourage recruiting organizations to be
sensitive to such matters if they are not so already, and to
establish policies that make clear employee selection criteria
as they pertain to personal characteristics.
Wc therefore recommend:
I. That a statement by the University similar to the
following be included in communications with potential

recruiters using our facilities. "Though not compelled by
law, Stanford University wishes to avoid discrimination
on the basis of sexual preference in its own promotion
and hiring policies and urges employers using our facilities
to follow similar practices."
(The Committee believed that Stanford should assess its
own employment policies regarding homosexuals. It is
however, beyond the purview of our committee to deter
mine what that explicit and expressed policy should be.)
2. that steps be taken to involve homosexual students
and staff directly in the career planning and placement
processes and enlist their help in Finding more effective
ways for employers and applicants to deal with the feeling
invoked by the term "homosexual" when it arises in the
selections proccss.
///. A Statement of Policy from Employers
(Approved by a vote of 6 to 1 with 2 absent)
We recommend that employers using University facilities
be required to answer the question, "In your hiring and
promotion policies and practices do you discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation?"
The Committee was split on the issue of whether to
encourage or to require employers to respond to the above
question. The dissenting member accepted this section where
such a question would be encouraged rather than required.
Also, deans of some schools may feel that the proper way to
get at the spirit of this issue is through a different phrasing. If
so, wc ask the suggested changes or revisions be presented to
the Dean of Student Affairs.)
Requiring employers to answer the above question is
consistent with the philosophy underlying career placement
at Stanford. The University believes that students should be
precisely informed about all policies which might affect their
interests, in order that they can adequately judge with whom
they should seek employment.
The simplest way for students to receive employment
related information of concern to them is by asking an
interviewer directly. Students can ask interviewers questions
concerning most aspects of employment without adversely
affecting their job placement prospects.
With regard to sexual orientation however, students
making inquiries are likely to be perceived by the inter
viewers as being homosexual, which may prejudice their
employment. Being justificably afraid of jeopardizing their
job-placement chances, few gay students are willing to breach
the subject of sexual orientation with prospective employers.
In addition, some of Stanford's gay graduates may un
knowingly begin their careers in organizations whose policies
and practices are repugnant to their own. Requiring employ
ment statements to promote full employment disclosure
concerning sexual orientation would be an important step
toward a remedy.
Students who are not gay would also benefit from the
procedure this committee has called for. Many students,
while not themselves injured by discrimination on the basis
of sexual preference, morally object to hiring and advance
ment criteria not related to job performance.
Employers' statements concerning sexual orientation in
hiring and promotion will provide all students with useful
information concerning what different organizations consider
to be important.
The Committee does not believe that requesting em
ployers' statements would provide a panacea for discrimina
tion on the basis of sexual preference. Many employers will
claim that they do not discriminate, whereas in fact they do;
many Stanford graduates will remain "closet homosexuals"
regardless of employment prospects, for social and family
reasons.
Nevertheless, the procedure our committee has called for
will assist some Stanford students in contributing to the
limits of their capacities without fear that their sexual
preference will hinder them. At the very least, adoption of
this proposal will demonstrate that Stanford is willing to take
a substantial step towards helping its students make truly free
and informed choices.
IV. Section A: Employers Who Do Discriminate
Should Be Banned
(The Committee was exactly split on the issue of whether
to ban employers who discriminated on the basis of sexual
preference from using Stanford facilities.
(Despite our inability to agree on a specific recommendat
ion, we have presented the arguments on both sides of the
issue. See Section IVB. This project was to some extent to
foster greater discussion of these issues. Our arguments may
also benefit future study on this or similar issues.
(Vote: 3 for section IVA, 3 for section IVB, I abstention,
I absent.)
Position A: We believe that Stanford University has an
oblijption to deny use of its placement facilities to employers
who discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.
Such discrimination is abhorrent to gay students, faculty,
and staff, as well as to many other members of the University
community. If the University does not bar such employers, it
is in effect acceding to a policy of cruel and debilitating
discrimination directed against some of its more vulnerable
students.
Stanford should not permit itself to be used to perpetuate
discrimination against gay persons. Discrimination on the
basis of sexual preference seems to us, in principle, equivalent
to discrimination on the basis of religion, sex, and color. In
each case, such discrimination is based usually on invidious
distinctions and denies to substantial numbers equal opportu
nity and, often, humane treatment.
Opponents of our recommendation for a change in policy
have raised various principled objections, and the more
important arguments are reducible to two:
The first is that the University has barred employers who
discriminate on the basis of religion, sex, and color only
because of federal law; that the present case reaches beyond
the requirement of the law to have the University promote
social values; and that the University should not seek to act
to promote social values.
The second is that the University should allow students
free choice to make their own decisions (e.g., whether or not
to interview with a discriminatory firm) because the exercise

of such choice contributes significantly to education.
These arguments seem dubious, neglect important pre
cendents, and rest often, at critical junctures, upon incorrect
assumptions about the activities of the University.
Let us first address the "promoting social value" objec
tion. We believe that the University has acted, and has often
sought to act, in many important ways that promote partic
ular social values-whether to maintain or alter the society.
Probably no institution, by its decisions and actions, can
avoid influencing values and promoting or altering them;
certainly, that is dramatically true in the case of a major
institution such as Stanford, which has considerable impact
upon various groups and localities by its decisions on, for
example, land use, investment policies, and admissions poli
cies.
Whether Stanford decides to rent land to the highest
bidder and/or to support low-cost housing for some disadvan
taged peoples, the University is, intentionally or not, pro
moting certain social values. In some notable cases, including
recent efforts for low-cost housing, the University formulated
policy with the explicit intention of promoting particular
social values.
Let us look briefly at the area of admissions policy for
additional evidence on this matter. In the past eight to 10
years, for various social reasons, the University has chosen, at
times, to increase the number of minority students in the
student body.
Such decisions for preferential admissions were based,
often self-consciously, upon larger social considerations: the
duties of a University to the society; the need to provide
greater opportunity to members of some racial minorities;
the desirability of promoting racial integration and of stifling
social disruptions. Such commitments were not required by
law, and they marked a departure from Stanford's earlier
policies.
We cite these changes in admissions policies to establish
the proposition that the University has acted, in important
matters, without the requirement of law to promote particu
lar social values.
In actual practices, of course, the University promotes
values in other more subtle and possibly more fundamental
ways. Consider, for example, the University's commitment to
a business school or a law school. Such a major financial
commitment assumes 'hat "doing" law or business is desir
able, that it promotes desirable social values, and that it
usually serves both the society and the individual.
In turn, obviously, the establishment of schools of revolu
tion would be unlikely (though legal), for they would
promote undesirable values. The critical difference is not
whether the University intends to promote social values but
which ones it seeks to promote.
Let us address the "free choice" objection. We do not
deny that some educational value does inhere sometimes,
perhaps even most times, in free choice itself, for the fact of
free choice may compel reflection and lead to judicious
action. But often the small increment of value may be
outweighed by the great harm of particular decisions. For
example, selection of the Indian symbol, so offensive to
native Americans, is one example of possible harm outweigh
ing the benefit of choice.
The administration wisely decided to eliminate the Indian
symbol because it offended native Americans. Under the
Committee's minority contention, which we reject, it would
seem to follow that the administration should not have taken
such action. Instead, as we understand their logic, each team,
or class, or appropriate group should make a new decision
about the Indian symbol because there will be greater
educational value in this exercise of free choice.
A closer analogy to the case before us might be the
imposition of educational area distribution requirements.
These educational requirements do restrict free choice by
compelling students to take some courses in areas that they
might otherwise disregard or avoid. In most cases, it appears,
students benefit educationally from these requirements, even
though they do not experience the real possibility of free
choice.
The proposed ban of employers who discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation might operate in roughly analo
gous fashion for students. They arc not being denied the
opportunity to seek interviews with these employers. Instead,
students will have to think carefully about the situation and
then make individual arrangements with such employers.
Perhaps this small difficulty will inspire students to think
very carefully about the exercise of their choice-a goal that
the "free choice" advocates seek to achieve and that wc
endorse.
We do not believe that the proposed change in policy will
bar many employers or significantly affect job opportunities
for students. Ten years ago, and maybe even two or three
years ago, most major employers might have been unwilling
or unable to agree to a policy of nondiscrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation.
Recent declarations by AT &. T and other major firms
indicate a shift in values and standards, and wc anticipate a
continuation of this trend. Our policy, in most cases, will
simply speed the trend.
Reccnt decisions by the military services indicate, unless
there is a reversal of these decisions by the administration or
the courts, that the American military may be the notable
exception. There is some likelikhood that it may revise policy
in the next decade, but we do not foresee a reversal in the
next few years.
Since federal regulations do not allow some federal
agencies (NASA, DOD, and FRDA, among others) to con
tract with universities that ban military recruiting, and our
proposed policy would have the effect of banning such
recruiting, the University would lose some contracts and
(according to Frank Riddle) about $4.75 million in unrestric
ted funds.
We could uneasily countenance the loss of these funds
and would urge the President to act in the moral merits of
the issues without consideration of the financial problems.
Such counsel may be easier to give than to receive, and wc
recognize that it is unlikely that the President will be willing
to take such action and to plunge the University more deeply
into annual deficits at this time.

As a result, we suggest an uneasy, but not altogether
unsatisfactory compromise. If the main objection to our
proposed policy is that it cannot be imposed on the military
because of the great financial cost, why not be explicit about
this objection and impose the policy in those other areas
where the likely financial cost is nonexistent or minimal''
Such a decision by the University would be a useful
admission that the University, whatever its commitment to
humane values, must operate in an arena of realism where
financial considerations heavily influence policy and choice.
We may regret the fact of such pressures, but we do not
believe that universities arc free.
IV. Section B. Employers Who Discriminate Should
Not Be Banned
(For vote, see Sec. IVA, above)
Stanford's career planning and placement services exist to
respond to the expressed needs of individual students. Uni
versity placement facilities are therefore made available to
any student who wishes to see any prospective employer. The
only valid exceptions are those based upon sound academic
reason or legal requirement. (See Dean Thomas Ehrlich's
memorandum, Oct. 28, 1975).
The Gay People's Union proposal meets neither criterion,
yet they have asked the University to impose the CPU's
moral judgment on all students using the career information
service. Indeed, the University has judiciously avoided
applying any political, moral, or social test to the CPPC.
To the extent that the career planning and placement
service hopes to respond to the expressed needs of each
student it can never succumb to the will of a minority or to
the tyranny of the majority. Every student must be guaran
teed access to the CPPC; information concerning any business
must be made available to him or her.
The University is obligated to safeguard the right of each
student to make and exercise moral decisions. (It is unjust to
members of the Stanford community to deny them access to
job opportunities without their consent. Certainly, the CPU's
hope is to influence firms by denying them access to
Stanford students; the same result, however, can be achieved
by each Stanford student voluntarily deciding not to seek
employment with a discriminating firm.)
If the goal of the GPU is to protect its members from
malicious and discriminatory hiring, then it should seek the
dissemination of information on hiring and promotion poli
cies. By requiring the firms to make this information freely
available, each student can decide whether to seek employ
ment with a firm that may or may not claim to discriminate.
The proposed exclusion of firms that discriminate on the
basis of sexual preferences or affection would retard the
honest relay of information.
Since no statistical check exists through which a firm's
actual hiring and promotion policies can be evaluated, and
the penalties for claiming to discriminate are so high, good
financial incentives exist for employers to transmit informa
tion less than honestly.
If the goal of the CPU's request, however, is to influence
social mores through utilization of a service to students, then
they infringe on the rights of other students to make moral
decisions. Students would then have their moral actions
heavily influenced by University policy. No matter that we
agree with the moral judgment; we disagree with the direct
consequences of the advocated policy: the denial of each
student's freedom to make his own moral selections.
Sexual preference or affection should not be considered
within the same context as race, color, religion, sex, and
national origin as advocated by the GPU. This listing is used
to demark minority populations; positive employment pro
grams are created for minority communities defined by race,
color, religion, sex, and national origin. It is to the disadvan
tage of existing minority populations to expand the list.
The precedent set by linking sexual preference or affec
tion to race, color, religion, sex, and national origin could, in
time, lead to efforts to establish affirmative action policies
for gay people.
There exist two additional interesting, albeit not compel
ling, reasons not to ban sexually discriminating firms from
the CPPC:
First, the labor market conditions that allow discrimina
tion against gay people arc identical to the conditions
necessary for discrimination against minorities; the problem
lies in lack of free-market competition. Enforcement of the
GPU request would limit the number of interviewing firms at
Stanford. Unfortunately any reduction in the number of
interviewing firms most directly harms the minority appli
cant.
Second, an inevitable consequence of enforcement of the
proposed ban is to remove military recruiting from Stanford.
The dire consequences of this are delineated in I rank
Riddle's memo of Dec. 5, 1975. (See Sec. / VA, above)

Following is a copy of a report on "Placement Services
Policy Recommendations" sent to Stanford President
Richard W. Lyman Feb. 11, 1976 by the Committee on
Services to Students. Deans of the seven schools, Career
Planning and Placement Center Director Ralph Keller, and
other officers directly affected will be asked to send any
comments they may have on the recommendations to James
Lyons, dean of student affairs. He will forward these,
together with his own recommendations, to Lyman before
the President acts on the report.
/. Summary of Current Placement Services Philo
sophies
The keystone of the philosophy of career planning and
placement services at Stanford is student centeredness. These
services exist to respond primarily to the expressed needs of
individual students.
To the extent that those needs are served well the
University is also benefited. The programs of individual
schools or departments are undoubtedly more enticing when
their students have good job opportunities to choose from
and when the students make wise and informed choices.
Other secondary beneficiaries of a good career planning
and placement program are alumni, who can make continued
use of the several placement services on campus. They are
served better by an active and well-organized program.
However, the primary efforts of the career planning and
placement services of Stanford are directed toward the career
planning and placement needs of the individual student.
There are some objectives that are not associated with
career planning and placement services at Stanford. The
University has in recent years avoided applying political or
social tests in the career information or placement processes,
except when mandated to do so by law.
(No one, including CPPC Director Ralph Keller, has been
able to inform the Committee of practices preceeding the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its interpretation by the courts
and applications by the Government.)
Nor are our services run for the primary benefit of,
industry, governmental agencies, schools and colleges, or
other social institutions. If such groups happen to be well
served by Stanford's career planning and placement services,
it is because of a congruence of need or interest with the
group primarily served-the students.
The career planning and placement services have resisted
occasional attempts to be used as explicit instruments of
social change. Many students will consider a wide variety of
career options during their time at Stanford, a process which
will often lead them to discover a number of unimagined
alternatives and ultimately the rejection of more alternatives
than are kept as "live" options.
This is an educationally useful process, but one which
requires free access to many choices; an access unmarrcd by
political tests, censured career libraries, or by a list of firms
that are "forbidden at Stanford" for reasons of contrariness
to some political or social philosophy dominating career and
recruiting facibties at Stanford.
In short, Stanford's career planning and placement facili
ties have tried to maximize students' choices, not limit them;
and to help the individual student to make choices rather
than to choose for the student by elimination of lawful but
unpopular choice alternatives.
The University advocates the exercise of informed choice,
of the use of the intellect in the proccss of choosing an area
of employment or a particular employer. Our career planning
activities, therefore, are aimed towards helping students
discover and weigh information about areas of employment
and particular employers and to help them identify and relate
their own needs and interests to this information.
The University is also committed to helping students and
potential employers identify and distinguish between infor
mation which is job-related and that which is not.
We can and should help employers and potential em
ployees provide each other with information to help assess
predicted job performance and job expectations, and discour
age the use of information that transcends the boundaries of
job-relatedness and intrudes into areas of privacy and person
al circumstance.
Information that is usually suspect of being not job-re
lated is often associated with race, national origin, religion,
sex, sexual preferences and activities, marital status, political
and social beliefs, certain specific medical conditions, and
family background.
If employers seek such information from candidates, or
use such information if otherwise discoVered, Stanford stu
dents should reasonably expect employers to be open about
such use, to explain the job-relatedness of such information,
and to be clear and open about the criteria they will use in
hiring and promotion.

students benefit educationally from these requirements, even
though they do not experience the real possibility of free
choice.
The proposed ban of employers who discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation might operate in roughly analo
gous fashion for students. They arc not being denied the
opportunity to seek interviews with these employers. Instead,
students will have to think carefully about the situation and
then make individual arrangements with such employers.
Perhaps this small difficulty will inspire students to think
very carefully about the exercise of their choice-a goal that
the "free choice" advocates seek to achieve and that wc
endorse.
We do not believe that the proposed change in policy will
bar many employers or significantly affect job opportunities
for students. Ten years ago, and maybe even two or three
years ago, most major employers might have been unwilling
or unable to agree to a policy of nondiscrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation.
Recent declarations by AT &. T and other major firms
indicate a shift in values and standards, and wc anticipate a
continuation of this trend. Our policy, in most cases, will
simply speed the trend.
Reccnt decisions by the military services indicate, unless
there is a reversal of these decisions by the administration or
the courts, that the American military may be the notable
exception. There is some likelikhood that it may revise policy
in the next decade, but we do not foresee a reversal in the
next few years.
Since federal regulations do not allow some federal
agencies (NASA, DOD, and FRDA, among others) to con
tract with universities that ban military recruiting, and our
proposed policy would have the effect of banning such
recruiting, the University would lose some contracts and
(according to Frank Riddle) about $4.75 million in unrestric
ted funds.
We could uneasily countenance the loss of these funds
and would urge the President to act in the moral merits of
the issues without consideration of the financial problems.
Such counsel may be easier to give than to receive, and wc
recognize that it is unlikely that the President will be willing
to take such action and to plunge the University more deeply
into annual deficits at this time.

As a result, we suggest an uneasy, but not altogether
unsatisfactory compromise. If the main objection to our
proposed policy is that it cannot be imposed on the military
because of the great financial cost, why not be explicit about
this objection and impose the policy in those other areas
where the likely financial cost is nonexistent or minimal''
Such a decision by the University would be a useful
admission that the University, whatever its commitment to
humane values, must operate in an arena of realism where
financial considerations heavily influence policy and choice.
We may regret the fact of such pressures, but we do not
believe that universities arc free.
IV. Section B. Employers Who Discriminate Should
Not Be Banned
(For vote, see Sec. IVA, above)
Stanford's career planning and placement services exist to
respond to the expressed needs of individual students. Uni
versity placement facilities are therefore made available to
any student who wishes to see any prospective employer. The
only valid exceptions are those based upon sound academic
reason or legal requirement. (See Dean Thomas Ehrlich's
memorandum, Oct. 28, 1975).
The Gay People's Union proposal meets neither criterion,
yet they have asked the University to impose the CPU's
moral judgment on all students using the career information
service. Indeed, the University has judiciously avoided
applying any political, moral, or social test to the CPPC.
To the extent that the career planning and placement
service hopes to respond to the expressed needs of each
student it can never succumb to the will of a minority or to
the tyranny of the majority. Every student must be guaran
teed access to the CPPC; information concerning any business
must be made available to him or her.
The University is obligated to safeguard the right of each
student to make and exercise moral decisions. (It is unjust to
members of the Stanford community to deny them access to
job opportunities without their consent. Certainly, the CPU's
hope is to influence firms by denying them access to
Stanford students; the same result, however, can be achieved
by each Stanford student voluntarily deciding not to seek
employment with a discriminating firm.)
If the goal of the GPU is to protect its members from
malicious and discriminatory hiring, then it should seek the
dissemination of information on hiring and promotion poli
cies. By requiring the firms to make this information freely
available, each student can decide whether to seek employ
ment with a firm that may or may not claim to discriminate.
The proposed exclusion of firms that discriminate on the
basis of sexual preferences or affection would retard the
honest relay of information.
Since no statistical check exists through which a firm's
actual hiring and promotion policies can be evaluated, and
the penalties for claiming to discriminate are so high, good
financial incentives exist for employers to transmit informa
tion less than honestly.
If the goal of the CPU's request, however, is to influence
social mores through utilization of a service to students, then
they infringe on the rights of other students to make moral
decisions. Students would then have their moral actions
heavily influenced by University policy. No matter that we
agree with the moral judgment; we disagree with the direct
consequences of the advocated policy: the denial of each
student's freedom to make his own moral selections.
Sexual preference or affection should not be considered
within the same context as race, color, religion, sex, and
national origin as advocated by the GPU. This listing is used
to demark minority populations; positive employment pro
grams are created for minority communities defined by race,
color, religion, sex, and national origin. It is to the disadvan
tage of existing minority populations to expand the list.
The precedent set by linking sexual preference or affec
tion to race, color, religion, sex, and national origin could, in
time, lead to efforts to establish affirmative action policies
for gay people.
There exist two additional interesting, albeit not compel
ling, reasons not to ban sexually discriminating firms from
the CPPC:
First, the labor market conditions that allow discrimina
tion against gay people arc identical to the conditions
necessary for discrimination against minorities; the problem
lies in lack of free-market competition. Enforcement of the
GPU request would limit the number of interviewing firms at
Stanford. Unfortunately any reduction in the number of
interviewing firms most directly harms the minority appli
cant.
Second, an inevitable consequence of enforcement of the
proposed ban is to remove military recruiting from Stanford.
The dire consequences of this are delineated in I rank
Riddle's memo of Dec. 5, 1975. (See Sec. / VA, above)

Following is a copy of a report on "Placement Services
Policy Recommendations" sent to Stanford President
Richard W. Lyman Feb. 11, 1976 by the Committee on
Services to Students. Deans of the seven schools, Career
Planning and Placement Center Director Ralph Keller, and
other officers directly affected will be asked to send any
comments they may have on the recommendations to James
Lyons, dean of student affairs. He will forward these,
together with his own recommendations, to Lyman before
the President acts on the report.
/. Summary of Current Placement Services Philo
sophies
The keystone of the philosophy of career planning and
placement services at Stanford is student centeredness. These
services exist to respond primarily to the expressed needs of
individual students.
To the extent that those needs are served well the
University is also benefited. The programs of individual
schools or departments are undoubtedly more enticing when
their students have good job opportunities to choose from
and when the students make wise and informed choices.
Other secondary beneficiaries of a good career planning
and placement program are alumni, who can make continued
use of the several placement services on campus. They are
served better by an active and well-organized program.
However, the primary efforts of the career planning and
placement services of Stanford are directed toward the career
planning and placement needs of the individual student.
There are some objectives that are not associated with
career planning and placement services at Stanford. The
University has in recent years avoided applying political or
social tests in the career information or placement processes,
except when mandated to do so by law.
(No one, including CPPC Director Ralph Keller, has been
able to inform the Committee of practices preceeding the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its interpretation by the courts
and applications by the Government.)
Nor are our services run for the primary benefit of,
industry, governmental agencies, schools and colleges, or
other social institutions. If such groups happen to be well
served by Stanford's career planning and placement services,
it is because of a congruence of need or interest with the
group primarily served-the students.
The career planning and placement services have resisted
occasional attempts to be used as explicit instruments of
social change. Many students will consider a wide variety of
career options during their time at Stanford, a process which
will often lead them to discover a number of unimagined
alternatives and ultimately the rejection of more alternatives
than are kept as "live" options.
This is an educationally useful process, but one which
requires free access to many choices; an access unmarrcd by
political tests, censured career libraries, or by a list of firms
that are "forbidden at Stanford" for reasons of contrariness
to some political or social philosophy dominating career and
recruiting facibties at Stanford.
In short, Stanford's career planning and placement facili
ties have tried to maximize students' choices, not limit them;
and to help the individual student to make choices rather
than to choose for the student by elimination of lawful but
unpopular choice alternatives.
The University advocates the exercise of informed choice,
of the use of the intellect in the proccss of choosing an area
of employment or a particular employer. Our career planning
activities, therefore, are aimed towards helping students
discover and weigh information about areas of employment
and particular employers and to help them identify and relate
their own needs and interests to this information.
The University is also committed to helping students and
potential employers identify and distinguish between infor
mation which is job-related and that which is not.
We can and should help employers and potential em
ployees provide each other with information to help assess
predicted job performance and job expectations, and discour
age the use of information that transcends the boundaries of
job-relatedness and intrudes into areas of privacy and person
al circumstance.
Information that is usually suspect of being not job-re
lated is often associated with race, national origin, religion,
sex, sexual preferences and activities, marital status, political
and social beliefs, certain specific medical conditions, and
family background.
If employers seek such information from candidates, or
use such information if otherwise discoVered, Stanford stu
dents should reasonably expect employers to be open about
such use, to explain the job-relatedness of such information,
and to be clear and open about the criteria they will use in
hiring and promotion.
11. A Positive Commitment for the University and
Employers
(Approved unanimously)
The Gay People's Union at Stanford has emphasized that
homosexual students have comc to fear invidious discrimina
tion in the employment process. This fear is dehumanizing
and may be a significant handicap in the job-seeking process.
In recent years employers have comc to recognize the
need for full, precise, and open job descriptions. A growing
number of employers have realized that many personal
characteristics previously assumed to be job-related arc not.
We believe that students should be able to know if
companies regard personal characteristics which are usually
regarded as private, such as religion, sexual preference, or
political belief, to be job-related, and thus form a basis for
hiring, work assignment, and promotions. We also believe
that students should know if companies have or do not have
specific policies about such matters, and if so, what those
policies arc. (See Section III)
Our several career planning and placement services should
find ways that will encourage recruiting organizations to be
sensitive to such matters if they are not so already, and to
establish policies that make clear employee selection criteria
as they pertain to personal characteristics.
Wc therefore recommend:
I. That a statement by the University similar to the
following be included in communications with potential

recruiters using our facilities. "Though not compelled by
law, Stanford University wishes to avoid discrimination
on the basis of sexual preference in its own promotion
and hiring policies and urges employers using our facilities
to follow similar practices."
(The Committee believed that Stanford should assess its
own employment policies regarding homosexuals. It is
however, beyond the purview of our committee to deter
mine what that explicit and expressed policy should be.)
2. that steps be taken to involve homosexual students
and staff directly in the career planning and placement
processes and enlist their help in Finding more effective
ways for employers and applicants to deal with the feeling
invoked by the term "homosexual" when it arises in the
selections proccss.
///. A Statement of Policy from Employers
(Approved by a vote of 6 to 1 with 2 absent)
We recommend that employers using University facilities
be required to answer the question, "In your hiring and
promotion policies and practices do you discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation?"
The Committee was split on the issue of whether to
encourage or to require employers to respond to the above
question. The dissenting member accepted this section where
such a question would be encouraged rather than required.
Also, deans of some schools may feel that the proper way to
get at the spirit of this issue is through a different phrasing. If
so, wc ask the suggested changes or revisions be presented to
the Dean of Student Affairs.)
Requiring employers to answer the above question is
consistent with the philosophy underlying career placement
at Stanford. The University believes that students should be
precisely informed about all policies which might affect their
interests, in order that they can adequately judge with whom
they should seek employment.
The simplest way for students to receive employment
related information of concern to them is by asking an
interviewer directly. Students can ask interviewers questions
concerning most aspects of employment without adversely
affecting their job placement prospects.
With regard to sexual orientation however, students
making inquiries are likely to be perceived by the inter
viewers as being homosexual, which may prejudice their
employment. Being justificably afraid of jeopardizing their
job-placement chances, few gay students are willing to breach
the subject of sexual orientation with prospective employers.
In addition, some of Stanford's gay graduates may un
knowingly begin their careers in organizations whose policies
and practices are repugnant to their own. Requiring employ
ment statements to promote full employment disclosure
concerning sexual orientation would be an important step
toward a remedy.
Students who are not gay would also benefit from the
procedure this committee has called for. Many students,
while not themselves injured by discrimination on the basis
of sexual preference, morally object to hiring and advance
ment criteria not related to job performance.
Employers' statements concerning sexual orientation in
hiring and promotion will provide all students with useful
information concerning what different organizations consider
to be important.
The Committee does not believe that requesting em
ployers' statements would provide a panacea for discrimina
tion on the basis of sexual preference. Many employers will
claim that they do not discriminate, whereas in fact they do;
many Stanford graduates will remain "closet homosexuals"
regardless of employment prospects, for social and family
reasons.
Nevertheless, the procedure our committee has called for
will assist some Stanford students in contributing to the
limits of their capacities without fear that their sexual
preference will hinder them. At the very least, adoption of
this proposal will demonstrate that Stanford is willing to take
a substantial step towards helping its students make truly free
and informed choices.
IV. Section A: Employers Who Do Discriminate
Should Be Banned
(The Committee was exactly split on the issue of whether
to ban employers who discriminated on the basis of sexual
preference from using Stanford facilities.
(Despite our inability to agree on a specific recommendat
ion, we have presented the arguments on both sides of the
issue. See Section IVB. This project was to some extent to
foster greater discussion of these issues. Our arguments may
also benefit future study on this or similar issues.
(Vote: 3 for section IVA, 3 for section IVB, I abstention,
I absent.)
Position A: We believe that Stanford University has an
oblijption to deny use of its placement facilities to employers
who discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.
Such discrimination is abhorrent to gay students, faculty,
and staff, as well as to many other members of the University
community. If the University does not bar such employers, it
is in effect acceding to a policy of cruel and debilitating
discrimination directed against some of its more vulnerable
students.
Stanford should not permit itself to be used to perpetuate
discrimination against gay persons. Discrimination on the
basis of sexual preference seems to us, in principle, equivalent
to discrimination on the basis of religion, sex, and color. In
each case, such discrimination is based usually on invidious
distinctions and denies to substantial numbers equal opportu
nity and, often, humane treatment.
Opponents of our recommendation for a change in policy
have raised various principled objections, and the more
important arguments are reducible to two:
The first is that the University has barred employers who
discriminate on the basis of religion, sex, and color only
because of federal law; that the present case reaches beyond
the requirement of the law to have the University promote
social values; and that the University should not seek to act
to promote social values.
The second is that the University should allow students
free choice to make their own decisions (e.g., whether or not
to interview with a discriminatory firm) because the exercise

of such choice contributes significantly to education.
These arguments seem dubious, neglect important pre
cendents, and rest often, at critical junctures, upon incorrect
assumptions about the activities of the University.
Let us first address the "promoting social value" objec
tion. We believe that the University has acted, and has often
sought to act, in many important ways that promote partic
ular social values-whether to maintain or alter the society.
Probably no institution, by its decisions and actions, can
avoid influencing values and promoting or altering them;
certainly, that is dramatically true in the case of a major
institution such as Stanford, which has considerable impact
upon various groups and localities by its decisions on, for
example, land use, investment policies, and admissions poli
cies.
Whether Stanford decides to rent land to the highest
bidder and/or to support low-cost housing for some disadvan
taged peoples, the University is, intentionally or not, pro
moting certain social values. In some notable cases, including
recent efforts for low-cost housing, the University formulated
policy with the explicit intention of promoting particular
social values.
Let us look briefly at the area of admissions policy for
additional evidence on this matter. In the past eight to 10
years, for various social reasons, the University has chosen, at
times, to increase the number of minority students in the
student body.
Such decisions for preferential admissions were based,
often self-consciously, upon larger social considerations: the
duties of a University to the society; the need to provide
greater opportunity to members of some racial minorities;
the desirability of promoting racial integration and of stifling
social disruptions. Such commitments were not required by
law, and they marked a departure from Stanford's earlier
policies.
We cite these changes in admissions policies to establish
the proposition that the University has acted, in important
matters, without the requirement of law to promote particu
lar social values.
In actual practices, of course, the University promotes
values in other more subtle and possibly more fundamental
ways. Consider, for example, the University's commitment to
a business school or a law school. Such a major financial
commitment assumes 'hat "doing" law or business is desir
able, that it promotes desirable social values, and that it
usually serves both the society and the individual.
In turn, obviously, the establishment of schools of revolu
tion would be unlikely (though legal), for they would
promote undesirable values. The critical difference is not
whether the University intends to promote social values but
which ones it seeks to promote.
Let us address the "free choice" objection. We do not
deny that some educational value does inhere sometimes,
perhaps even most times, in free choice itself, for the fact of
free choice may compel reflection and lead to judicious
action. But often the small increment of value may be
outweighed by the great harm of particular decisions. For
example, selection of the Indian symbol, so offensive to
native Americans, is one example of possible harm outweigh
ing the benefit of choice.
The administration wisely decided to eliminate the Indian
symbol because it offended native Americans. Under the
Committee's minority contention, which we reject, it would
seem to follow that the administration should not have taken
such action. Instead, as we understand their logic, each team,
or class, or appropriate group should make a new decision
about the Indian symbol because there will be greater
educational value in this exercise of free choice.
A closer analogy to the case before us might be the
imposition of educational area distribution requirements.
These educational requirements do restrict free choice by
compelling students to take some courses in areas that they
might otherwise disregard or avoid. In most cases, it appears,
students benefit educationally from these requirements, even
though they do not experience the real possibility of free
choice.
The proposed ban of employers who discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation might operate in roughly analo
gous fashion for students. They arc not being denied the
opportunity to seek interviews with these employers. Instead,
students will have to think carefully about the situation and
then make individual arrangements with such employers.
Perhaps this small difficulty will inspire students to think
very carefully about the exercise of their choice-a goal that
the "free choice" advocates seek to achieve and that wc
endorse.
We do not believe that the proposed change in policy will
bar many employers or significantly affect job opportunities
for students. Ten years ago, and maybe even two or three
years ago, most major employers might have been unwilling
or unable to agree to a policy of nondiscrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation.
Recent declarations by AT &. T and other major firms
indicate a shift in values and standards, and wc anticipate a
continuation of this trend. Our policy, in most cases, will
simply speed the trend.
Reccnt decisions by the military services indicate, unless
there is a reversal of these decisions by the administration or
the courts, that the American military may be the notable
exception. There is some likelikhood that it may revise policy
in the next decade, but we do not foresee a reversal in the
next few years.
Since federal regulations do not allow some federal
agencies (NASA, DOD, and FRDA, among others) to con
tract with universities that ban military recruiting, and our
proposed policy would have the effect of banning such
recruiting, the University would lose some contracts and
(according to Frank Riddle) about $4.75 million in unrestric
ted funds.
We could uneasily countenance the loss of these funds
and would urge the President to act in the moral merits of
the issues without consideration of the financial problems.
Such counsel may be easier to give than to receive, and wc
recognize that it is unlikely that the President will be willing
to take such action and to plunge the University more deeply

unsatisfactory compromise. If the main objection to our

this objection and impose the policy in those other areas
where the likely financial cost is nonexistent or minimal''
Such a decision by the University would be a useful
admission that the University, whatever its commitment to
humane values, must operate in an arena of realism where
financial considerations heavily influence policy and choice.
We may regret the fact of such pressures, but we do not
believe that universities arc free.

use such information if otherwise discoVered, Stanford stu
dents should reasonably expect employers to be open about
such use, to explain the job-relatedness of such information,
and to be clear and open about the criteria they will use in
hiring and promotion.
11. A Positive Commitment for the University and
Employers
(Approved unanimously)
The Gay People's Union at Stanford has emphasized that
homosexual students have comc to fear invidious discrimina
tion in the employment process. This fear is dehumanizing
and may be a significant handicap in the job-seeking process.
In recent years employers have comc to recognize the
need for full, precise, and open job descriptions. A growing
number of employers have realized that many personal
characteristics previously assumed to be job-related arc not.
We believe that students should be able to know if
companies regard personal characteristics which are usually
regarded as private, such as religion, sexual preference, or
political belief, to be job-related, and thus form a basis for
hiring, work assignment, and promotions. We also believe
that students should know if companies have or do not have
specific policies about such matters, and if so, what those
policies arc. (See Section III)
Our several career planning and placement services should
find ways that will encourage recruiting organizations to be
sensitive to such matters if they are not so already, and to
establish policies that make clear employee selection criteria
as they pertain to personal characteristics.
Wc therefore recommend:
I. That a statement by the University similar to the
following be included in communications with potential

recruiters using our facilities. "Though not compelled by
law, Stanford University wishes to avoid discrimination
on the basis of sexual preference in its own promotion
and hiring policies and urges employers using our facilities
to follow similar practices."
(The Committee believed that Stanford should assess its
own employment policies regarding homosexuals. It is
however, beyond the purview of our committee to deter
mine what that explicit and expressed policy should be.)
2. that steps be taken to involve homosexual students
and staff directly in the career planning and placement
processes and enlist their help in Finding more effective
ways for employers and applicants to deal with the feeling
invoked by the term "homosexual" when it arises in the
selections proccss.
///. A Statement of Policy from Employers
(Approved by a vote of 6 to 1 with 2 absent)
We recommend that employers using University facilities
be required to answer the question, "In your hiring and
promotion policies and practices do you discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation?"
The Committee was split on the issue of whether to
encourage or to require employers to respond to the above
question. The dissenting member accepted this section where
such a question would be encouraged rather than required.
Also, deans of some schools may feel that the proper way to
get at the spirit of this issue is through a different phrasing. If
so, wc ask the suggested changes or revisions be presented to
the Dean of Student Affairs.)
Requiring employers to answer the above question is
consistent with the philosophy underlying career placement
at Stanford. The University believes that students should be
precisely informed about all policies which might affect their
interests, in order that they can adequately judge with whom
they should seek employment.
The simplest way for students to receive employment
related information of concern to them is by asking an
interviewer directly. Students can ask interviewers questions
concerning most aspects of employment without adversely
affecting their job placement prospects.
With regard to sexual orientation however, students
making inquiries are likely to be perceived by the inter
viewers as being homosexual, which may prejudice their
employment. Being justificably afraid of jeopardizing their
job-placement chances, few gay students are willing to breach
the subject of sexual orientation with prospective employers.
In addition, some of Stanford's gay graduates may un
knowingly begin their careers in organizations whose policies
and practices are repugnant to their own. Requiring employ
ment statements to promote full employment disclosure
concerning sexual orientation would be an important step
toward a remedy.
Students who are not gay would also benefit from the
procedure this committee has called for. Many students,
while not themselves injured by discrimination on the basis
of sexual preference, morally object to hiring and advance
ment criteria not related to job performance.
Employers' statements concerning sexual orientation in
hiring and promotion will provide all students with useful
information concerning what different organizations consider
to be important.
The Committee does not believe that requesting em
ployers' statements would provide a panacea for discrimina
tion on the basis of sexual preference. Many employers will
claim that they do not discriminate, whereas in fact they do;
many Stanford graduates will remain "closet homosexuals"
regardless of employment prospects, for social and family
reasons.
Nevertheless, the procedure our committee has called for
will assist some Stanford students in contributing to the
limits of their capacities without fear that their sexual
preference will hinder them. At the very least, adoption of
this proposal will demonstrate that Stanford is willing to take
a substantial step towards helping its students make truly free
and informed choices.
IV. Section A: Employers Who Do Discriminate
Should Be Banned
(The Committee was exactly split on the issue of whether
to ban employers who discriminated on the basis of sexual
preference from using Stanford facilities.
(Despite our inability to agree on a specific recommendat
ion, we have presented the arguments on both sides of the
issue. See Section IVB. This project was to some extent to
foster greater discussion of these issues. Our arguments may
also benefit future study on this or similar issues.
(Vote: 3 for section IVA, 3 for section IVB, I abstention,
I absent.)
Position A: We believe that Stanford University has an
oblijption to deny use of its placement facilities to employers
who discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.
Such discrimination is abhorrent to gay students, faculty,
and staff, as well as to many other members of the University
community. If the University does not bar such employers, it
is in effect acceding to a policy of cruel and debilitating
discrimination directed against some of its more vulnerable
students.
Stanford should not permit itself to be used to perpetuate
discrimination against gay persons. Discrimination on the
basis of sexual preference seems to us, in principle, equivalent
to discrimination on the basis of religion, sex, and color. In
each case, such discrimination is based usually on invidious
distinctions and denies to substantial numbers equal opportu
nity and, often, humane treatment.
Opponents of our recommendation for a change in policy
have raised various principled objections, and the more
important arguments are reducible to two:
The first is that the University has barred employers who
discriminate on the basis of religion, sex, and color only
because of federal law; that the present case reaches beyond
the requirement of the law to have the University promote
social values; and that the University should not seek to act
to promote social values.
The second is that the University should allow students
free choice to make their own decisions (e.g., whether or not
to interview with a discriminatory firm) because the exercise

of such choice contributes significantly to education.
These arguments seem dubious, neglect important pre
cendents, and rest often, at critical junctures, upon incorrect
assumptions about the activities of the University.
Let us first address the "promoting social value" objec
tion. We believe that the University has acted, and has often
sought to act, in many important ways that promote partic
ular social values-whether to maintain or alter the society.
Probably no institution, by its decisions and actions, can
avoid influencing values and promoting or altering them;
certainly, that is dramatically true in the case of a major
institution such as Stanford, which has considerable impact
upon various groups and localities by its decisions on, for
example, land use, investment policies, and admissions poli
cies.
Whether Stanford decides to rent land to the highest
bidder and/or to support low-cost housing for some disadvan
taged peoples, the University is, intentionally or not, pro
moting certain social values. In some notable cases, including
recent efforts for low-cost housing, the University formulated
policy with the explicit intention of promoting particular
social values.
Let us look briefly at the area of admissions policy for
additional evidence on this matter. In the past eight to 10
years, for various social reasons, the University has chosen, at
times, to increase the number of minority students in the
student body.
Such decisions for preferential admissions were based,
often self-consciously, upon larger social considerations: the
duties of a University to the society; the need to provide
greater opportunity to members of some racial minorities;
the desirability of promoting racial integration and of stifling
social disruptions. Such commitments were not required by
law, and they marked a departure from Stanford's earlier
policies.
We cite these changes in admissions policies to establish
the proposition that the University has acted, in important
matters, without the requirement of law to promote particu
lar social values.
In actual practices, of course, the University promotes
values in other more subtle and possibly more fundamental
ways. Consider, for example, the University's commitment to
a business school or a law school. Such a major financial
commitment assumes 'hat "doing" law or business is desir
able, that it promotes desirable social values, and that it
usually serves both the society and the individual.
In turn, obviously, the establishment of schools of revolu
tion would be unlikely (though legal), for they would
promote undesirable values. The critical difference is not
whether the University intends to promote social values but
which ones it seeks to promote.
Let us address the "free choice" objection. We do not
deny that some educational value does inhere sometimes,
perhaps even most times, in free choice itself, for the fact of
free choice may compel reflection and lead to judicious
action. But often the small increment of value may be
outweighed by the great harm of particular decisions. For
example, selection of the Indian symbol, so offensive to
native Americans, is one example of possible harm outweigh
ing the benefit of choice.
The administration wisely decided to eliminate the Indian
symbol because it offended native Americans. Under the
Committee's minority contention, which we reject, it would
seem to follow that the administration should not have taken
such action. Instead, as we understand their logic, each team,
or class, or appropriate group should make a new decision
about the Indian symbol because there will be greater
educational value in this exercise of free choice.
A closer analogy to the case before us might be the
imposition of educational area distribution requirements.
These educational requirements do restrict free choice by
compelling students to take some courses in areas that they
might otherwise disregard or avoid. In most cases, it appears,
students benefit educationally from these requirements, even
though they do not experience the real possibility of free
choice.
The proposed ban of employers who discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation might operate in roughly analo
gous fashion for students. They arc not being denied the
opportunity to seek interviews with these employers. Instead,
students will have to think carefully about the situation and
then make individual arrangements with such employers.
Perhaps this small difficulty will inspire students to think
very carefully about the exercise of their choice-a goal that
the "free choice" advocates seek to achieve and that wc
endorse.
We do not believe that the proposed change in policy will
bar many employers or significantly affect job opportunities
for students. Ten years ago, and maybe even two or three
years ago, most major employers might have been unwilling
or unable to agree to a policy of nondiscrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation.
Recent declarations by AT &. T and other major firms
indicate a shift in values and standards, and wc anticipate a
continuation of this trend. Our policy, in most cases, will
simply speed the trend.
Reccnt decisions by the military services indicate, unless
there is a reversal of these decisions by the administration or
the courts, that the American military may be the notable
exception. There is some likelikhood that it may revise policy
in the next decade, but we do not foresee a reversal in the
next few years.
Since federal regulations do not allow some federal
agencies (NASA, DOD, and FRDA, among others) to con
tract with universities that ban military recruiting, and our
proposed policy would have the effect of banning such
recruiting, the University would lose some contracts and
(according to Frank Riddle) about $4.75 million in unrestric
ted funds.
We could uneasily countenance the loss of these funds
and would urge the President to act in the moral merits of
the issues without consideration of the financial problems.
Such counsel may be easier to give than to receive, and wc
recognize that it is unlikely that the President will be willing
to take such action and to plunge the University more deeply
into annual deficits at this time.

As a result, we suggest an uneasy, but not altogether
unsatisfactory compromise. If the main objection to our
proposed policy is that it cannot be imposed on the military
because of the great financial cost, why not be explicit about
this objection and impose the policy in those other areas
where the likely financial cost is nonexistent or minimal''
Such a decision by the University would be a useful
admission that the University, whatever its commitment to
humane values, must operate in an arena of realism where
financial considerations heavily influence policy and choice.
We may regret the fact of such pressures, but we do not
believe that universities arc free.
IV. Section B. Employers Who Discriminate Should
Not Be Banned
(For vote, see Sec. IVA, above)
Stanford's career planning and placement services exist to
respond to the expressed needs of individual students. Uni
versity placement facilities are therefore made available to
any student who wishes to see any prospective employer. The
only valid exceptions are those based upon sound academic
reason or legal requirement. (See Dean Thomas Ehrlich's
memorandum, Oct. 28, 1975).
The Gay People's Union proposal meets neither criterion,
yet they have asked the University to impose the CPU's
moral judgment on all students using the career information
service. Indeed, the University has judiciously avoided
applying any political, moral, or social test to the CPPC.
To the extent that the career planning and placement
service hopes to respond to the expressed needs of each
student it can never succumb to the will of a minority or to
the tyranny of the majority. Every student must be guaran
teed access to the CPPC; information concerning any business
must be made available to him or her.
The University is obligated to safeguard the right of each
student to make and exercise moral decisions. (It is unjust to
members of the Stanford community to deny them access to
job opportunities without their consent. Certainly, the CPU's
hope is to influence firms by denying them access to
Stanford students; the same result, however, can be achieved
by each Stanford student voluntarily deciding not to seek
employment with a discriminating firm.)
If the goal of the GPU is to protect its members from
malicious and discriminatory hiring, then it should seek the
dissemination of information on hiring and promotion poli
cies. By requiring the firms to make this information freely
available, each student can decide whether to seek employ
ment with a firm that may or may not claim to discriminate.
The proposed exclusion of firms that discriminate on the
basis of sexual preferences or affection would retard the
honest relay of information.
Since no statistical check exists through which a firm's
actual hiring and promotion policies can be evaluated, and
the penalties for claiming to discriminate are so high, good
financial incentives exist for employers to transmit informa
tion less than honestly.
If the goal of the CPU's request, however, is to influence
social mores through utilization of a service to students, then
they infringe on the rights of other students to make moral
decisions. Students would then have their moral actions
heavily influenced by University policy. No matter that we
agree with the moral judgment; we disagree with the direct
consequences of the advocated policy: the denial of each
student's freedom to make his own moral selections.
Sexual preference or affection should not be considered
within the same context as race, color, religion, sex, and
national origin as advocated by the GPU. This listing is used
to demark minority populations; positive employment pro
grams are created for minority communities defined by race,
color, religion, sex, and national origin. It is to the disadvan
tage of existing minority populations to expand the list.
The precedent set by linking sexual preference or affec
tion to race, color, religion, sex, and national origin could, in
time, lead to efforts to establish affirmative action policies
for gay people.
There exist two additional interesting, albeit not compel
ling, reasons not to ban sexually discriminating firms from
the CPPC:
First, the labor market conditions that allow discrimina
tion against gay people arc identical to the conditions
necessary for discrimination against minorities; the problem
lies in lack of free-market competition. Enforcement of the
GPU request would limit the number of interviewing firms at
Stanford. Unfortunately any reduction in the number of
interviewing firms most directly harms the minority appli
cant.
Second, an inevitable consequence of enforcement of the
proposed ban is to remove military recruiting from Stanford.
The dire consequences of this are delineated in I rank
Riddle's memo of Dec. 5, 1975. (See Sec. / VA, above)

Following is a copy of a report on "Placement Services
Policy Recommendations" sent to Stanford President
Richard W. Lyman Feb. 11, 1976 by the Committee on
Services to Students. Deans of the seven schools, Career
Planning and Placement Center Director Ralph Keller, and
other officers directly affected will be asked to send any
comments they may have on the recommendations to James
Lyons, dean of student affairs. He will forward these,
together with his own recommendations, to Lyman before
the President acts on the report.
/. Summary of Current Placement Services Philo
sophies
The keystone of the philosophy of career planning and
placement services at Stanford is student centeredness. These
services exist to respond primarily to the expressed needs of
individual students.
To the extent that those needs are served well the
University is also benefited. The programs of individual
schools or departments are undoubtedly more enticing when
their students have good job opportunities to choose from
and when the students make wise and informed choices.
Other secondary beneficiaries of a good career planning
and placement program are alumni, who can make continued
use of the several placement services on campus. They are
served better by an active and well-organized program.
However, the primary efforts of the career planning and
placement services of Stanford are directed toward the career
planning and placement needs of the individual student.
There are some objectives that are not associated with
career planning and placement services at Stanford. The
University has in recent years avoided applying political or
social tests in the career information or placement processes,
except when mandated to do so by law.
(No one, including CPPC Director Ralph Keller, has been
able to inform the Committee of practices preceeding the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its interpretation by the courts
and applications by the Government.)
Nor are our services run for the primary benefit of,
industry, governmental agencies, schools and colleges, or
other social institutions. If such groups happen to be well
served by Stanford's career planning and placement services,
it is because of a congruence of need or interest with the
group primarily served-the students.
The career planning and placement services have resisted
occasional attempts to be used as explicit instruments of
social change. Many students will consider a wide variety of
career options during their time at Stanford, a process which
will often lead them to discover a number of unimagined
alternatives and ultimately the rejection of more alternatives
than are kept as "live" options.
This is an educationally useful process, but one which
requires free access to many choices; an access unmarrcd by
political tests, censured career libraries, or by a list of firms
that are "forbidden at Stanford" for reasons of contrariness
to some political or social philosophy dominating career and
recruiting facibties at Stanford.
In short, Stanford's career planning and placement facili
ties have tried to maximize students' choices, not limit them;
and to help the individual student to make choices rather
than to choose for the student by elimination of lawful but
unpopular choice alternatives.
The University advocates the exercise of informed choice,
of the use of the intellect in the proccss of choosing an area
of employment or a particular employer. Our career planning
activities, therefore, are aimed towards helping students
discover and weigh information about areas of employment
and particular employers and to help them identify and relate
their own needs and interests to this information.
The University is also committed to helping students and
potential employers identify and distinguish between infor
mation which is job-related and that which is not.
We can and should help employers and potential em
ployees provide each other with information to help assess
predicted job performance and job expectations, and discour
age the use of information that transcends the boundaries of
job-relatedness and intrudes into areas of privacy and person
al circumstance.
Information that is usually suspect of being not job-re
lated is often associated with race, national origin, religion,
sex, sexual preferences and activities, marital status, political
and social beliefs, certain specific medical conditions, and
family background.
If employers seek such information from candidates, or
use such information if otherwise discoVered, Stanford stu
dents should reasonably expect employers to be open about
such use, to explain the job-relatedness of such information,
and to be clear and open about the criteria they will use in
hiring and promotion.

continuation of this trend. Our policy, in most cases, will
simply speed the trend.
Reccnt decisions by the military services indicate, unless
there is a reversal of these decisions by the administration or
the courts, that the American military may be the notable
exception. There is some likelikhood that it may revise policy
in the next decade, but we do not foresee a reversal in the
next few years.
Since federal regulations do not allow some federal
agencies (NASA, DOD, and FRDA, among others) to con
tract with universities that ban military recruiting, and our
proposed policy would have the effect of banning such
recruiting, the University would lose some contracts and
(according to Frank Riddle) about $4.75 million in unrestric
ted funds.
We could uneasily countenance the loss of these funds
and would urge the President to act in the moral merits of
the issues without consideration of the financial problems.
Such counsel may be easier to give than to receive, and wc
recognize that it is unlikely that the President will be willing
to take such action and to plunge the University more deeply
into annual deficits at this time.

As a result, we suggest an uneasy, but not altogether
unsatisfactory compromise. If the main objection to our
proposed policy is that it cannot be imposed on the military
because of the great financial cost, why not be explicit about
this objection and impose the policy in those other areas
where the likely financial cost is nonexistent or minimal''
Such a decision by the University would be a useful
admission that the University, whatever its commitment to
humane values, must operate in an arena of realism where
financial considerations heavily influence policy and choice.
We may regret the fact of such pressures, but we do not
believe that universities arc free.
IV. Section B. Employers Who Discriminate Should
Not Be Banned
(For vote, see Sec. IVA, above)
Stanford's career planning and placement services exist to
respond to the expressed needs of individual students. Uni
versity placement facilities are therefore made available to
any student who wishes to see any prospective employer. The
only valid exceptions are those based upon sound academic
reason or legal requirement. (See Dean Thomas Ehrlich's
memorandum, Oct. 28, 1975).
The Gay People's Union proposal meets neither criterion,
yet they have asked the University to impose the CPU's
moral judgment on all students using the career information
service. Indeed, the University has judiciously avoided
applying any political, moral, or social test to the CPPC.
To the extent that the career planning and placement
service hopes to respond to the expressed needs of each
student it can never succumb to the will of a minority or to
the tyranny of the majority. Every student must be guaran
teed access to the CPPC; information concerning any business
must be made available to him or her.
The University is obligated to safeguard the right of each
student to make and exercise moral decisions. (It is unjust to
members of the Stanford community to deny them access to
job opportunities without their consent. Certainly, the CPU's
hope is to influence firms by denying them access to
Stanford students; the same result, however, can be achieved
by each Stanford student voluntarily deciding not to seek
employment with a discriminating firm.)
If the goal of the GPU is to protect its members from
malicious and discriminatory hiring, then it should seek the
dissemination of information on hiring and promotion poli
cies. By requiring the firms to make this information freely
available, each student can decide whether to seek employ
ment with a firm that may or may not claim to discriminate.
The proposed exclusion of firms that discriminate on the
basis of sexual preferences or affection would retard the
honest relay of information.
Since no statistical check exists through which a firm's
actual hiring and promotion policies can be evaluated, and
the penalties for claiming to discriminate are so high, good
financial incentives exist for employers to transmit informa
tion less than honestly.
If the goal of the CPU's request, however, is to influence
social mores through utilization of a service to students, then
they infringe on the rights of other students to make moral
decisions. Students would then have their moral actions
heavily influenced by University policy. No matter that we
agree with the moral judgment; we disagree with the direct
consequences of the advocated policy: the denial of each
student's freedom to make his own moral selections.
Sexual preference or affection should not be considered
within the same context as race, color, religion, sex, and
national origin as advocated by the GPU. This listing is used
to demark minority populations; positive employment pro
grams are created for minority communities defined by race,
color, religion, sex, and national origin. It is to the disadvan
tage of existing minority populations to expand the list.
The precedent set by linking sexual preference or affec
tion to race, color, religion, sex, and national origin could, in
time, lead to efforts to establish affirmative action policies
for gay people.
There exist two additional interesting, albeit not compel
ling, reasons not to ban sexually discriminating firms from
the CPPC:
First, the labor market conditions that allow discrimina
tion against gay people arc identical to the conditions
necessary for discrimination against minorities; the problem
lies in lack of free-market competition. Enforcement of the
GPU request would limit the number of interviewing firms at
Stanford. Unfortunately any reduction in the number of
interviewing firms most directly harms the minority appli
cant.
Second, an inevitable consequence of enforcement of the
proposed ban is to remove military recruiting from Stanford.
The dire consequences of this are delineated in I rank
Riddle's memo of Dec. 5, 1975. (See Sec. / VA, above)
