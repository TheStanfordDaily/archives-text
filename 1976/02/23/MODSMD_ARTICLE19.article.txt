## Council seeks student input 
### Jim Raup 
The Graduate Student Council
is concerned with many prob
lems and issues involving
graduate students, but it is look
ing for more student input, ac
cording to Deric Jennings, the
council's head.
Consisting of one elected rep
resentative from each depart
ment of the School of
Humanities and Sciences, the
council was formed in spring

1974 by then-Dean of Graduate
Studies Lincoln Moses to advise
the dean and to open up com
munications between the stu
dents and the dean.
"The council's most impor
tant function has been to estab
lish some communication
flows between the dean and the
individual departments," said
Jennings, a second year grad
student in economics who is also
on the ASSU Senate.

However, he added, the idea of
one representative for each de
partment has not been working
too well to get input from indi
vidual students.
To attract student input, the
council has begun holding open
gripe sessions. The session last
Thursday was attended by very
few students but those that came
had several ideas.
One first year grad student
complained of the lack of an
orientation program for new
grad students. He claimed that
new students are informed only
about the department they are
entering. They are left ignorant
of the libraries and other campus
facilities.
Unlike freshmen, entering
grad students receive no infor
mation about the campus or
housing prior to registration, ac
cording to one student.
Another student pointed out
that very little was known about
the problems of the nearly 5000
graduate students living off
campus. She listed child care,
single parent housing as well as
the need for lockers and a place
to go on campus during the day
as areas of concern.
Jennings says that "a whole lot
of the battle is just getting the
information out to the students.
It's impossible to reach them in
substantial numbers."
