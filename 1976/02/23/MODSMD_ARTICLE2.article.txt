PEKING (AP) — Richard Nixon re
lived the peak of his presidency last
night half a world away from the White
House. At the same time, China's act
ing premier publicly acknowledged
for the first time that the Peking hierar
chy is going through another internal
conflict.
The Chinese army band again
played "Home on the Range." uncer
tainly. Still struggling with their
chopsticks, the honored guests sat
around the same round table in the
same Great Hall of the People. Every
body again toasted everybody with
mai tais.
The former president recalled the
Shanghai agreement he signed four
years ago that "ended a generation of
confrontation and conflict" between
China and the United States.
He noted that while "the leaders
may change" — he resigned and Pre
mier ChouEn-laidied — both countries
cling "just as strongly" to the common
interests that opened the door between
them in 1972.
Chinese chairman
He recalled the day"I had the
honor" of meeting with the legendary
Mao Tse-tung, chairman of the
Chinese Communist party.
"We spoke very candidly and hon
estly about the fact that we came from
different backgrounds and we had
many areas in which our beliefs on
philosophical, political and economic
matters were different.
At the banquet honoring Nixon and
his wife. Pat, acting premier Hua Kuo
feng acknowledged that "a revolutio
nary mass debate is going on in such
circles as education, science and
technology. It is a continuation and
deepening of the Great Proletarian
Cultural Revolution."

Hua also took another shot at the
Soviet Union. "The danger of the out
break of a new war keeps growing," he
said, "as a result of the intense rivalry
for world hegemony, and in particular
that imperialism which flaunts the
signboard of 'socialism' has reached
out its grasping hands everywhere and
carried out rabid expansion."
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
said Saturday in Brasilia that Nixon
will report to the government on his
return.
"We will, of course, wish to learn of
the nature of his discussions and his
impressions," said Kissinger.
Press Secretary
This appeared to be a change in ad
ministration policy regarding the
Nixon trip. White House Press Secret
ary Ron Nessen said on Feb. 6 that
Nixon would not meet with President
Ford to discuss the trip, and "there is
no plan now to have any report or any
thing from the former President."
Ford subsequently said he had no
plans to meet with Nixon to discuss
the trip, but John Carlson. Nessen's as
sistant, said yesterday:
"If anybody comes back from any
place and they've got something the
government should know, they can
communicate that to the government.
If Nixon has something to say he prob
ably will communicate it to someone
in the administration."
He said that Nixon's case is unique
in that he was involved in the original
contacts with that country, is very
knowledgeable about U.S. policy to
ward China and is meeting with a new
Chinese leadership.
Kissinger had expressed a special
interest in any conversations Nixon
has with Hua. Hua. who succeeded the
late Chou, met the Nixons at the
airport.

for the first time that the Peking hierar

conflict.
The Chinese army band again
played "Home on the Range." uncer

The former president recalled the
Shanghai agreement he signed four
years ago that "ended a generation of
confrontation and conflict" between
China and the United States.

Chinese chairman
He recalled the day"I had the
honor" of meeting with the legendary
Mao Tse-tung, chairman of the
Chinese Communist party.
"We spoke very candidly and hon
estly about the fact that we came from
different backgrounds and we had
many areas in which our beliefs on
philosophical, political and economic
matters were different.

his wife. Pat, acting premier Hua Kuo
feng acknowledged that "a revolutio

circles as education, science and
technology. It is a continuation and
deepening of the Great Proletarian
Cultural Revolution."

Hua also took another shot at the
Soviet Union. "The danger of the out
break of a new war keeps growing," he
said, "as a result of the intense rivalry
for world hegemony, and in particular
that imperialism which flaunts the
signboard of 'socialism' has reached
out its grasping hands everywhere and
carried out rabid expansion."
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
said Saturday in Brasilia that Nixon
will report to the government on his
return.
"We will, of course, wish to learn of
the nature of his discussions and his
impressions," said Kissinger.
Press Secretary

ministration policy regarding the
Nixon trip. White House Press Secret
ary Ron Nessen said on Feb. 6 that
Nixon would not meet with President
Ford to discuss the trip, and "there is
no plan now to have any report or any
thing from the former President."
Ford subsequently said he had no
plans to meet with Nixon to discuss
the trip, but John Carlson. Nessen's as
sistant, said yesterday:
"If anybody comes back from any
place and they've got something the
government should know, they can
communicate that to the government.
If Nixon has something to say he prob
ably will communicate it to someone
in the administration."
He said that Nixon's case is unique
in that he was involved in the original
contacts with that country, is very
knowledgeable about U.S. policy to
ward China and is meeting with a new
Chinese leadership.
Kissinger had expressed a special
interest in any conversations Nixon
has with Hua. Hua. who succeeded the
