# Simons scores career-high 16 points
## Cards lose sixth straight 
### Mike Tollin 
PULLMAN, Wash. — Who
ever first coined the phrase,
"When it rains, it pours," was
obviously a resident of
Washington State. But one he
never thought of was, "When it
doesn't rain, visiting basketball
teams will be getting beaten too
badly to enjoy it."
Okay, it doesn't quite have the
ring, but for Stanford's Cardi
nals, it fits quite well. Having
ventured to the Pacific North
west last week in quest of the
elusive upset, the Cards returned
home yesterday weary, battered
and twice-beaten. And the only
threat of rain in the usually
drenched area came when
Washington State's Ken Jones
threw up a jump shot Saturday
that arched high enough to bring
rain back down with it. Nonethe
less, it was a gloomy weekend
for the Cardinals.
Stanford lost 80-59 to
Washington Thursday night and
91-79 to Washington State on
Saturday, ran its losing streak to
six games, and as coach Dick Di-
Biaso said, "showed the wear
and tear of a long season."
Cold spells
In both games the Cards stayed
competitive through the first
half, made a challenge early in
the second stanza, and then, as
has been their custom this sea
son, lapsed into a spell of abo
minable basketball that dropped
them from contention quicker
than you can say "fast break."
Washington, the eighth or
11th best team in the country,
depending on whether you be
lieve the coaches or the writers,
led Stanford by only four points
two minutes into the second
half, but then erupted on a 19-4
tear to turn the game into a
runaway.
Then Saturday afternoon in
Pullman's spanking new Per
forming Arts Center, which ri
vals Pauley Pavilion for All-

Pacific-Eight Arena honors,
the Cougars devised an incredi
bly similar plot. After Stanford
ran offthe first eight points of the
second half to force a 41-11 tie,
WSU decided the
entertainment-starved Pullman
residents deserved a better
show. So, on the strength of a fast
break that left the Cardinals with
wind burns, the Cougs outscored
their visitors 20-6 and that was
all she wrote.
With Ron Davis leading the
way, the explosive Cougars gave
a fine demonstration of the art of
layup-shooting in the second
half and ran their season record
to 17-6 and 7-4 in thePac-8.
Davis, a 6-foot-5 senior who
plays in the very large shadow of
Steve Puidokas, shot 14-18 for an
easy 28 points, a career high.
For Stanford, things went
from worse, to ridiculous. Mike
Bratz came down with some kind
of flu Saturday, and the Cards'
third leading scorer was limited
to one field goal, a 25-footer at
the final buzzer.
Ed Schweitzer, the one untar
nished Cardinal through the los
ing streak, was held to single fi
gures in both points and re
bounds, and Wolfe Perry con
tinued to struggle with his sud
denly frigid shooting touch.
Could have won
Dißiaso and the Cards were
particularly disappointed with
the loss, since it was a game they
had a good shot at winning. "We
had our chances," Dißiaso said,
"but when we were in a position
to pull it in, we made a couple of
key mistakes.
"As I've been saying, we need

all of our men to be competitive.
With Schader hurt," he said,
"we're obviously not as strong in
rebounding."
The team's injuries also mean
a lack of bench strength, but
Saturday Mike Simons did his
bit to make up for that defi
ciency. The Pieman came off the
bench for a milestone perfor
mance. His 16 points doubled
his career high, put him into the
mythical 100-point club and, ac
cording to Dißiaso, "kept us in
the game."
For a while anyway. The loss

dropped to the Cards 7-17 for the'
season and 1-10 in league play.
If it is any consolation to Di-
Biaso, WSU coach George Ravel
ing had nothing but praise for
the Cardinal coach.
"Personally," he said, "1 think
they play up to their potential
more than anyone else in the
Pac-8. With their personnel, they
have no right to go into Pauley
Pavilion and lose by one point.
They're a very intelligent and
well-coached team and I have to
say that Dißiaso is doing a hel
luva job." ,

"but when we were in a position
to pull it in, we made a couple of
key mistakes.
"As I've been saying, we need

all of our men to be competitive.
With Schader hurt," he said,
"we're obviously not as strong in
rebounding."
The team's injuries also mean
a lack of bench strength, but
Saturday Mike Simons did his
bit to make up for that defi
ciency. The Pieman came off the
bench for a milestone perfor
mance. His 16 points doubled
his career high, put him into the
mythical 100-point club and, ac
cording to Dißiaso, "kept us in
the game."
For a while anyway. The loss

dropped to the Cards 7-17 for the'
season and 1-10 in league play.
If it is any consolation to Di-
Biaso, WSU coach George Ravel
ing had nothing but praise for
the Cardinal coach.
"Personally," he said, "1 think
they play up to their potential
more than anyone else in the
Pac-8. With their personnel, they
have no right to go into Pauley
Pavilion and lose by one point.
They're a very intelligent and
well-coached team and I have to
say that Dißiaso is doing a hel
luva job." ,
PULLMAN, Wash. — Who
ever first coined the phrase,
"When it rains, it pours," was
obviously a resident of
Washington State. But one he
never thought of was, "When it
doesn't rain, visiting basketball
teams will be getting beaten too
badly to enjoy it."
Okay, it doesn't quite have the
ring, but for Stanford's Cardi
nals, it fits quite well. Having
ventured to the Pacific North
west last week in quest of the
elusive upset, the Cards returned
home yesterday weary, battered
and twice-beaten. And the only
threat of rain in the usually
drenched area came when
Washington State's Ken Jones
threw up a jump shot Saturday
that arched high enough to bring
rain back down with it. Nonethe
less, it was a gloomy weekend
for the Cardinals.
Stanford lost 80-59 to
Washington Thursday night and
91-79 to Washington State on
Saturday, ran its losing streak to
six games, and as coach Dick Di-
Biaso said, "showed the wear
and tear of a long season."
Cold spells
In both games the Cards stayed
competitive through the first
half, made a challenge early in
the second stanza, and then, as
has been their custom this sea
son, lapsed into a spell of abo
minable basketball that dropped
them from contention quicker
than you can say "fast break."
Washington, the eighth or
11th best team in the country,
depending on whether you be
lieve the coaches or the writers,
led Stanford by only four points
two minutes into the second
half, but then erupted on a 19-4
tear to turn the game into a
runaway.
Then Saturday afternoon in
Pullman's spanking new Per
forming Arts Center, which ri
vals Pauley Pavilion for All-

Pacific-Eight Arena honors,
the Cougars devised an incredi
bly similar plot. After Stanford
ran offthe first eight points of the
second half to force a 41-11 tie,
WSU decided the
entertainment-starved Pullman
residents deserved a better
show. So, on the strength of a fast
break that left the Cardinals with
wind burns, the Cougs outscored
their visitors 20-6 and that was
all she wrote.
With Ron Davis leading the
way, the explosive Cougars gave
a fine demonstration of the art of
layup-shooting in the second
half and ran their season record
to 17-6 and 7-4 in thePac-8.
Davis, a 6-foot-5 senior who
plays in the very large shadow of
Steve Puidokas, shot 14-18 for an
easy 28 points, a career high.
For Stanford, things went
from worse, to ridiculous. Mike
Bratz came down with some kind
of flu Saturday, and the Cards'
third leading scorer was limited
to one field goal, a 25-footer at
the final buzzer.
Ed Schweitzer, the one untar
nished Cardinal through the los
ing streak, was held to single fi
gures in both points and re
bounds, and Wolfe Perry con
tinued to struggle with his sud
denly frigid shooting touch.

particularly disappointed with

residents deserved a better
show. So, on the strength of a fast
break that left the Cardinals with
wind burns, the Cougs outscored
their visitors 20-6 and that was
all she wrote.
With Ron Davis leading the
way, the explosive Cougars gave
a fine demonstration of the art of
layup-shooting in the second
half and ran their season record
to 17-6 and 7-4 in thePac-8.
Davis, a 6-foot-5 senior who
plays in the very large shadow of
Steve Puidokas, shot 14-18 for an
easy 28 points, a career high.
For Stanford, things went
from worse, to ridiculous. Mike
Bratz came down with some kind
of flu Saturday, and the Cards'
third leading scorer was limited
to one field goal, a 25-footer at
the final buzzer.
Ed Schweitzer, the one untar
nished Cardinal through the los
ing streak, was held to single fi
gures in both points and re
bounds, and Wolfe Perry con
tinued to struggle with his sud
denly frigid shooting touch.
Could have won
Dißiaso and the Cards were
particularly disappointed with
the loss, since it was a game they
had a good shot at winning. "We
had our chances," Dißiaso said,
"but when we were in a position
to pull it in, we made a couple of
key mistakes.
"As I've been saying, we need

all of our men to be competitive.
With Schader hurt," he said,
"we're obviously not as strong in
rebounding."
The team's injuries also mean
a lack of bench strength, but
Saturday Mike Simons did his
bit to make up for that defi
ciency. The Pieman came off the
bench for a milestone perfor
mance. His 16 points doubled
his career high, put him into the
mythical 100-point club and, ac
cording to Dißiaso, "kept us in
the game."
For a while anyway. The loss

dropped to the Cards 7-17 for the'
season and 1-10 in league play.
If it is any consolation to Di-
Biaso, WSU coach George Ravel
ing had nothing but praise for
the Cardinal coach.
"Personally," he said, "1 think
they play up to their potential
more than anyone else in the
Pac-8. With their personnel, they
have no right to go into Pauley
Pavilion and lose by one point.
They're a very intelligent and
well-coached team and I have to
say that Dißiaso is doing a hel
luva job." ,
