# Pac-8 roundup
## UCLA streak ends 
### Marko Fong 
Welcome to another episode of Pacific Eight
basketball. Last week, Clean Gene Bartow had fi
nally started to take command of his new family
with two more victories at home. Up north, Lon
nie Shelton was anxiously awaiting the verdict of
his court case which would finally decide who
gets custody of him. And in the air, the Oregon
Ducks were enjoying their migration south, find
ing victories in Berkeley and Stanford.
Let us join our story in a little court in the state
of Oregon. The judge speaks, "I'm sorry Lonnie.
The law says that I'll have to turn you over to the
St. Louis Spirits." Lonnie pleads. "But your
honor, the Beavers need me. I scored 24 points
against UCLA yesterday."
The judge consoles him. "But you still lost that
crucial game, 78-69. Ralph Drollinger scored 14
points against you. He even dribbled the length of
the court for a layup and a crucial basket. You're
two games out of first now. Besides, I'm sure the
Beavers will manage without you. They'll proba
bly beat USC 78-61 Saturday."
Ducks in Shakey town
The Oregon Ducks, in Los Angeles along with
the Beavers, prevail upon a friendly USC Trojan
for hospitality. The Trojan gives Greg Ballard and
Ron Lee 19 points apiece and treats all the Ducks
to a 70-67 victory. Fearing that their generous host
will try to give them even more victories than he

can afford, the Ducks head across town.
Saturday, the Ducks unwittingly seek shelter at
Pauley Pavilion. They do not realize that the
UCLA Bruins, who hibernate there, have shot
down the last 98 visitors to their humble abode.
The Ducks fly in, led by Lee's 15 points and Bal
lard's 16, and catch the Bruins asleep.
After they awaken, the Bruins shoot at the
Ducks but, at the end of the first half of the even
ing, they have hit only six of 27 from the floor. The
Ducks shoot back and hit 13 of 21 sitting Bruins.
Armed with the three Ps — patience, poise and
persistence — the Ducks beat the Bruins at home,
It is the first time the Bruins have been
hospitable at home since USC beat them in March
1970.
Bears trapped
Up north, the California Bears look for a win.
They are turned away by Washington State, 98-85,
and llth-ranked Washington, 95-75.
