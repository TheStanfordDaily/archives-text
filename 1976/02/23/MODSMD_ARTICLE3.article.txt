# Possible new Hearst evidence
## Judge to decide on use of tape 
### Dan Fiduccia 
SAN FRANCISCO — Federal Dis
trict Court Judge Oliver Carter is ex
pected to rule today whether the pro
secution may introduce into evidence
the tape recording of a conversation at
the San Mateo County Jail last fall be
tween Patricia Hearst and her friend
Patricia Tobin, a Stanford senior in
human biology.
U.S. Attorney James Browning at
tempted to question Hearst last Friday
concerning certain statements which
Hearst made on the tape.
Outside the presence of the jury, de
fense attorney Albert Johnson again
moved to suppress all jail tapes and
journals which have been kept on
Hearst while she is in the jail. Johnson
argued that besides violating Hearst's
right to privacy, the tape between
Hearst and Tobin contained several
"fluctuations."
Johnson quoted from an FBI
memorandum on the tape, which
stated "it is not possible to establish
continuity in the conversation" bet
ween Hearst and Tobin.
Anger at arrest
In the tape, Hearst said she would
not accept a bail arrangement which
would maker her "a prisoner" in her

parents' home. She also expressed
anger at having been arrested on the
tape, according to the San Francisco
Chronicle.
Browning told Carter that this was
the only tape about which he wished to
question Hearst.
Johnson had earlier questioned San
Mateo County Sheriff John McDonald
and Lt. Roger Goad of that Sheriff's
office concerning the taping of
Hearst's conversations while she is in
the jail.
Browning also asked Hearst a ques
tion which allowed her to inform the
jury of the terrorist bombing at Hearst
Castle in San Simeon.
SLA power
Browning had been questioning
Hearst as to what led her to believe
Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA)
members William and Emily Harris
had such power over her life that the
Harrises, even if arrested, could have
others kill Hearst.
Hearst responded: "It's happening
like that now on the street."
Browning asked, "It's happening
now?"
Then Hearst said "Yes," and Brown
ing asked "What do you mean. Miss
Hearst?"
Browning suddenly realized the
implications of his question and
quickly said "I withdraw the ques
tion."
Chief defense attorney F. Lee Bailey
began yelling "Let her answer."
Carter ruled Hearst had to answer

and Hearst then described the bomb
ing of San Simeon and also the threats
made against the lives of both her life
and her parents' lives.
Browning asked Hearst why she
feared killing people, or possibly
being killed, on future missions with
the SLA less than turning the SLA
members in to police.
Hearst responded: "I was afraid of
everyone."
Hearst also implicated sports ac
tivist Jack Scott in both federal and
state crimes.
Hearst said she first met fugitive
Wendy Yoshimura at Scott's New York
apartment, and that Scott had told
Hearst he had helped Yoshimura get
across the country.
Hearst said Scott had bought her a
brown wig and clothes.
'Ripoff artist'
When Browning asked Hearst where
the Scotts got their money, Hearst re
plied: "Well, okay. My understanding
of where they got it was that he was
some kind of ripoff artist with credit
cards and getting furniture on time
and selling it, and maneuvers like
that. . . ."
Scott also used contributions which
were made to his Institute for the
Study of Sport and Society to help the
SLA, according to Hearst.
Hearst also told Browning that,
when she was booked into the San
Mateo County Jail on Sept. 18, she gave
her occupation as "urban guerilla" be
cause "it was the only thing I could

think of."
Following her arrest, Hearst said she
gave clenched fist salutes only because
one of the Harrises was nearby.
"I was doing what I thought I was
supposed to do," Hearst said.

on the witness stand late in the atter
noon. Hall, currently in the San Joa
quin County Jail for a parole violation,
said he talked to SLA leader Donald
(Cinque) DeFreeze a few days after the
Hibernia Bank robbery.
Hall said he asked DeFreeze why he
had used Hearst "in a funky $10,000
bank robbery" and had "fronted her
off" when she was "worth millions."
Hall explained that "front her off"
meant exposing Hearst to being ar
rested or being killed.
Hall said DeFreeze told him that he

(Cinque) had three choices: killing
Hearst, sending her home or putting
her "in a position where she would
become a part of them, a part of the
group, where the FBI, the CIA, what
ever, would look for her as well as
them."
DeFreeze also told Hall that if Hearst
had done anything wrong during the
bank robbery he would have killed her.
according to Hall.
Under cross-examination by Brown
ing, Hall said he had been convicted of
one or more felonies, and had last used
narcotics in 1969.
