# Swimmers rally over California
## 
### Chris Kamel 
Throughout last week, diver
Wayne Wager was in the hospi
tal undergoing tests for what was
diagnosed as a tear of the dia
phragm from the sternum.
But if there was any pain, it
was not the main concern of the
junior from Bellevue, Wash, as
he was competing in the three
meter diving event Saturday
against California. He knew
what he had to do.
Last year's Pacific Eight Con
ference finalist had to take sec
ond place to stop Cal from get
ting first and second place, but,
more importantly, the 57-point
total necessary to win the meet.
Stanford came back to win,
58-55. A Cal win would have
been the first against Stanford
since 1941, when the Bears de
feated the Cards, or whatever
they were at the time, 51-24.
Wager, whose specialty is the
one-meter board, came througfi
with the unexpected second
place on the three-meter board,
edging out Cal's Steve Del Re by
six points. His second place split
Cal's entries and brought the
Cards back to 55-51 with only
the freestyle relay remaining.
Thornton strategy
What put the Bears in that en
viable lead was a little strategy
on the part of Cal coach Nort
Thornton. According to Gaug
hran, the pivotal event of the
meet was the 500-yard freestyle.
He figured the Cards had to win
the event to win the meet. Bill
Chao v who earlier captured the
1000-yard freestyle in 9:41.9,
represented the Cardinals' hope.
Thornton's last-minute decision
to put Peter Rocca in the 500-
free, however, eventually gave
Cal first place in the event as
Rocca finished a half-second in
front of Chao.
The switch paid off as the
Bears found themselves ahead,
48-40, but just as fast as the Card

swimming squad chanted, "S-U,
one-two" before the 200-yard
breaststroke, the Cards' John
Hencken and Stu Corliss took
one-two in the event to bring
Stanford right back. The Bears
then trailed, 49-48, setting up
Wager's performance.
"I was sure we'd lost it after
the 500-free but then we came
back," said Caughran. "I was
confident we could take the last
relay, but the problem was get
ting there in a position to win."
Big relays
According to Gaughran, the
relay events were important
parts of the meet and Jon Pow
ell's performance in both relays
gave the Cards what turned out
to be 14 very important points.
"I wanted to rest Dave (Fair
bank) so 1 put Jon in for him in
the 400 medley relay," said
Gaughran. "It was his 45.89
freestyle leg which assured the
event, and meet, win."
According to Gaughran, how
ever, every point in the meet had
to be there for the win; a win he
admitted was the most exciting
in six years.

ting first and second place, but,
more importantly, the 57-point
total necessary to win the meet.
Stanford came back to win,
58-55. A Cal win would have
been the first against Stanford
since 1941, when the Bears de
feated the Cards, or whatever
they were at the time, 51-24.
Wager, whose specialty is the
one-meter board, came througfi
with the unexpected second
place on the three-meter board,
edging out Cal's Steve Del Re by
six points. His second place split
Cal's entries and brought the
Cards back to 55-51 with only
the freestyle relay remaining.
Thornton strategy
What put the Bears in that en
viable lead was a little strategy
on the part of Cal coach Nort
Thornton. According to Gaug
hran, the pivotal event of the
meet was the 500-yard freestyle.
He figured the Cards had to win
the event to win the meet. Bill
Chao v who earlier captured the
1000-yard freestyle in 9:41.9,
represented the Cardinals' hope.
Thornton's last-minute decision
to put Peter Rocca in the 500-
free, however, eventually gave
Cal first place in the event as
Rocca finished a half-second in
front of Chao.
The switch paid off as the
Bears found themselves ahead,
48-40, but just as fast as the Card

swimming squad chanted, "S-U,
one-two" before the 200-yard
breaststroke, the Cards' John
Hencken and Stu Corliss took
one-two in the event to bring
Stanford right back. The Bears
then trailed, 49-48, setting up
Wager's performance.
"I was sure we'd lost it after
the 500-free but then we came
back," said Caughran. "I was
confident we could take the last
relay, but the problem was get
ting there in a position to win."
Big relays
According to Gaughran, the
relay events were important
parts of the meet and Jon Pow
ell's performance in both relays
gave the Cards what turned out
to be 14 very important points.
"I wanted to rest Dave (Fair
bank) so 1 put Jon in for him in
the 400 medley relay," said
Gaughran. "It was his 45.89
freestyle leg which assured the
event, and meet, win."
According to Gaughran, how
ever, every point in the meet had
to be there for the win; a win he
admitted was the most exciting
in six years.

six points. His second place split
Cal's entries and brought the
Cards back to 55-51 with only
the freestyle relay remaining.
Thornton strategy
What put the Bears in that en
viable lead was a little strategy
on the part of Cal coach Nort
Thornton. According to Gaug
hran, the pivotal event of the
meet was the 500-yard freestyle.
He figured the Cards had to win
the event to win the meet. Bill
Chao v who earlier captured the
1000-yard freestyle in 9:41.9,
represented the Cardinals' hope.
Thornton's last-minute decision
to put Peter Rocca in the 500-
free, however, eventually gave
Cal first place in the event as
Rocca finished a half-second in
front of Chao.
The switch paid off as the
Bears found themselves ahead,
48-40, but just as fast as the Card

swimming squad chanted, "S-U,
one-two" before the 200-yard
breaststroke, the Cards' John
Hencken and Stu Corliss took
one-two in the event to bring
Stanford right back. The Bears
then trailed, 49-48, setting up
Wager's performance.
"I was sure we'd lost it after
the 500-free but then we came
back," said Caughran. "I was
confident we could take the last
relay, but the problem was get
ting there in a position to win."
Big relays
According to Gaughran, the
relay events were important
parts of the meet and Jon Pow
ell's performance in both relays
gave the Cards what turned out
to be 14 very important points.
"I wanted to rest Dave (Fair
bank) so 1 put Jon in for him in
the 400 medley relay," said
Gaughran. "It was his 45.89
freestyle leg which assured the
event, and meet, win."
According to Gaughran, how
ever, every point in the meet had
to be there for the win; a win he
admitted was the most exciting
in six years.

OFF THE BLOCKS—Stanford three-time All-American fohn
Hencken prepares for the gun in Saturday's meet against Califor
nia. Mencken, considered the world's most outstanding
breaststroker, broke the meet record against Cal in the 200-
individual medley with a time of 1:55.48 and won the 200-breast in
2:05.92.
Throughout last week, diver
Wayne Wager was in the hospi
tal undergoing tests for what was
diagnosed as a tear of the dia
phragm from the sternum.
But if there was any pain, it
was not the main concern of the
junior from Bellevue, Wash, as
he was competing in the three
meter diving event Saturday
against California. He knew
what he had to do.
Last year's Pacific Eight Con
ference finalist had to take sec
ond place to stop Cal from get
ting first and second place, but,
more importantly, the 57-point
total necessary to win the meet.
Stanford came back to win,
58-55. A Cal win would have
been the first against Stanford
since 1941, when the Bears de
feated the Cards, or whatever
they were at the time, 51-24.
Wager, whose specialty is the
one-meter board, came througfi
with the unexpected second
place on the three-meter board,
edging out Cal's Steve Del Re by
six points. His second place split
Cal's entries and brought the
