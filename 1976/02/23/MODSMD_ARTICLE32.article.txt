The women cagers nipped the University of
Nevada-Reno, 59-52, Friday night and came back
to crush Santa Clara, 62-23, Saturday to close out
their home season and extend their winning
streak to four games.
Neither game carried much significance as the
Cards have already clinched a spot in next week's
Northern California basketball championships on
the basis of their second place finish and 7-3

league record.
Nevada-Reno, a late addition to the schedule
and a non-league opponent, proved a reasonable
match for the Cards â€” unlike Santa Clara. Al
though the Cards led throughout the contest,
Reno kept within 10 by compensating for its lack
of skill with sheer muscle.
Stanford did suffer a major setback in the game
when forward Onnie Killefer sprained her ankle
coming off the boards early in the first half.

Santa Clara was a poor excuse
for a basketball team. Managing
to bring just six players, with
two of them obviously out of
shape to play anywhere near a
full game, Santa Clara quickly
succumbed to the Cards' fast
break attack.
Stanford's only disappoint
ment seemed to come when
Santa Clara scored at the final
buzzer. Coach Gay Coburn had
set an 11-point limit for Santa
Clara in the second half. Al
though she had her players pres
sing in the final minutes. Santa
Clara put its 12th second-half
point in at the buzzer.
Guard Nancy Lovvold again
sparkled with the ballhandling
chores while forward Sukie
Jackson and center Maggie Nel
son led scorers with 17 and 13
points, respectively.
