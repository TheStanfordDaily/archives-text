Batters lose two
Stanford baseball coach Ray
Young probably wishes that he
could have saved some of the 13
runs his Cards scored Friday
against Fresno State, for the
doubleheader against the
Bulldogs Saturday afternoon.
After pounding Fresno State,
13-7, Friday night in Fresno, the
Bulldogs came back Saturday to
sweep a twin bill from Stanford,
6-3 and 4-3.
"Friday night we played a fine
ballgame,"said Young. Card hit
ters pounded out four home runs
as Stanford got 12 hits. Steve
Davis, Gary Pitchford, Randy
Wongand TomGuardinoall had
round trippers for the Cards.
Jim Scharffenberger, who

came into the ball game in the
fifth inning to quell, a Bulldog
rally, picked up the win. He is
now 2-1.
Maybe the fact that Friday
night's game lasted a little over
three hours hurt Stanford in the
doubleheader the following day.
The Cards jumped out to a 2-0
lead in the first frame of the first
game, as Stanford continued to
hit well, but the Cards got just
one more* run, while the
Bulldogs were scoring six times,
to lose 6-3. Stanford had just four
hits for the game.
The Cards, who last week were
4-1, are now 5-5. Stanford will
visit Sunken Diamond just once
this week, for a 2:30 p.m. contest
Wednesday against Santa Clara.

Wrestlers last
The Stanford wrestling team
capped a disappointing season
by finishing a disappointing last
in the Pacific Eight Champion
ships Friday in Corvallis, Ore.
Host Oregon State won the
seven-team tournament (USC
does not have a wrestling team).
No Stanford wrestler qualified
for the Nationals, but three Cards
took fourth places: Mike King in
the 118-pound division, Craig
Reynolds in the 158-pound
bracket and Gary Anderson in
the heavyweight group.
Golfers routed
It was just one of those days for
the Stanford golf team as it
evened its match record at 1-1
with a 23V2-3V2 loss to San Jose
State last Thursday.
The Cards had beaten the

Spartans twice earlier in the sea
son in the California and Stan
ford tournaments by scores of
299-302 and 295-301, respec
tively.
Jay Johnston (74) and Doug
Rice (83) scored one point apiece
for the Cards, who travel today to
play San Francisco State at noon.
Sailing team
Although it's doubtful that
Lake Lag will even appear this
year, the Stanford sailing team
has moved into an uncontested
lead in the Northern California
Sailing Association Series.
A field of nine schools was
blown off the water Saturday by
the sailing of Alan Andrews and
his crew, Russel Winslow. In
light winds this team compiled
finishes of 1-1-1.
