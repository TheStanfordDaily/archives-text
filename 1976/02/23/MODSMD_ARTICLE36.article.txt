# Maze's tough preliminary
## Netters beat Spartans 
### Paul Bauman 
SAN JOSE — While most of the Stanford tennis
team prepared for Friday's match at San Jose State
with some light-hearted singles and doubles ac
tion on the varsity courts last week, Bill Maze was
tuning up a little more seriously.
A challenge match perhaps? Six-hour work
outs? Neither. Maze, currently No. 1 on the Card
ladder, was playing a guy ranked second — not
second on his team and not second in college, but
second in the world . . . Jimmy Connors.
A very nervous Maze lost to Connors, 6-1, 6-4,
in the U.S. National Indoor Championships in
Salisbury, Md.
"It was a good experience," Maze said, "If I
hadn't been so nervous I might have done better."
Bad luck
Maze said he has a history of drawing tough
opponents.
"Last year (tennis promoter) Bill Riordan gave
me Illie Nastase. 1 didn't think he could do any
worse this year. So who do I get . . . Jimbo Con
nors. I'm just wondering what Riordan is going to
do next year."
Maze returned to California in time to lead Stan
ford to a 6-3 win over San Jose State. The big
sophomore from Emeryville, Ca. defeated Joe
Meyers, playing No. 1 for the Spartans in place of
the injured Hank Pfister, 6-4, 7-5, in the featured
indoor singles match.
In the other indoor matches, San Jose State's
Brad Rowe beat Card freshman Matt Mitchell, 6-4,'
6-2, at second singles, and Meyers and Tim
McNeil outplayed Maze and Mitchell, 6-3, 4-6,
6-4, at first doubles.
Bigger than breadbox
Whereas Maples Pavilion is an example of how
successfully a basketball arena can be adapted to
tennis, San Jose State's home court perverts the
whole idea. The gym is bigger than a breadbox,
but that's about it. There's no room to maneuver
behind the baselines and low scaffolding allows
only bloop shots — not lobs. Matt Mitchell said

the place was exactly like a pit."
As if the dimensions of the gym don't pose
enough of a problem, opposing players must also
adjust to the surface, which is about as coarse as
ice. San Jose State has disdained using any type of
carpet, and so the surface is the hardwood floor
itself. Balls skip off the slick floor like flat stones
off a serene lake.
The Spartans take advantage of their surface by
recruiting lanky players with booming serves.
Pfister, Meyers and Rowe are all in the 6-fooM
range.
'Devastating serve'
The Maze-Meyers match shaped up as a battle
oi heavy artillery. Maze is 6-3 himself and has
what coach Dick Gould calls "the most devastat
ing serve on the team."
Interestingly, Maze alternated a spin serve with
his power serve and did not ace Meyers at all.
Sometimes the strategy worked to keep Meyers off
balance, but at other times he was able to counter
with passing shots off returns of serve. In the big
points however, Maze reached back and blasted
serves which Meyers couldn't handle.
• In the end, it was Maze's sharp groundstrokes
and volleys that outclassed Meyers. Keeping the
ball low. Maze played a controlled game and
looked comfortable on the fast surface throughout
the match.
Three of Stanford's top players were absent
trom the San Jose State match. Gene Mayer, Nick
Saviano and Pat DuPre are all off playing on inde
pendent tours. Saviano will be back at Stanford
within two weeks, but Mayer and DuPre won't be
back until the beginning of next quarter, when the
Gards begin league play.

SAN JOSE — While most of the Stanford tennis
team prepared for Friday's match at San Jose State
with some light-hearted singles and doubles ac
tion on the varsity courts last week, Bill Maze was
tuning up a little more seriously.
A challenge match perhaps? Six-hour work
outs? Neither. Maze, currently No. 1 on the Card
ladder, was playing a guy ranked second — not
second on his team and not second in college, but
second in the world . . . Jimmy Connors.
A very nervous Maze lost to Connors, 6-1, 6-4,
in the U.S. National Indoor Championships in
Salisbury, Md.
"It was a good experience," Maze said, "If I
hadn't been so nervous I might have done better."
Bad luck
Maze said he has a history of drawing tough
opponents.
"Last year (tennis promoter) Bill Riordan gave
me Illie Nastase. 1 didn't think he could do any
worse this year. So who do I get . . . Jimbo Con
nors. I'm just wondering what Riordan is going to
do next year."
Maze returned to California in time to lead Stan
ford to a 6-3 win over San Jose State. The big
sophomore from Emeryville, Ca. defeated Joe
Meyers, playing No. 1 for the Spartans in place of
the injured Hank Pfister, 6-4, 7-5, in the featured
indoor singles match.
In the other indoor matches, San Jose State's
Brad Rowe beat Card freshman Matt Mitchell, 6-4,'
6-2, at second singles, and Meyers and Tim
McNeil outplayed Maze and Mitchell, 6-3, 4-6,
6-4, at first doubles.
Bigger than breadbox
Whereas Maples Pavilion is an example of how
successfully a basketball arena can be adapted to
tennis, San Jose State's home court perverts the
whole idea. The gym is bigger than a breadbox,
but that's about it. There's no room to maneuver
behind the baselines and low scaffolding allows
only bloop shots — not lobs. Matt Mitchell said

the place was exactly like a pit."
As if the dimensions of the gym don't pose
enough of a problem, opposing players must also
adjust to the surface, which is about as coarse as
ice. San Jose State has disdained using any type of
carpet, and so the surface is the hardwood floor
itself. Balls skip off the slick floor like flat stones
off a serene lake.
The Spartans take advantage of their surface by
recruiting lanky players with booming serves.
Pfister, Meyers and Rowe are all in the 6-fooM
range.
'Devastating serve'
The Maze-Meyers match shaped up as a battle
oi heavy artillery. Maze is 6-3 himself and has
what coach Dick Gould calls "the most devastat
ing serve on the team."
Interestingly, Maze alternated a spin serve with
his power serve and did not ace Meyers at all.
Sometimes the strategy worked to keep Meyers off
balance, but at other times he was able to counter
with passing shots off returns of serve. In the big
points however, Maze reached back and blasted
serves which Meyers couldn't handle.
• In the end, it was Maze's sharp groundstrokes
and volleys that outclassed Meyers. Keeping the
ball low. Maze played a controlled game and
looked comfortable on the fast surface throughout
the match.
Three of Stanford's top players were absent
trom the San Jose State match. Gene Mayer, Nick
Saviano and Pat DuPre are all off playing on inde
pendent tours. Saviano will be back at Stanford
within two weeks, but Mayer and DuPre won't be
back until the beginning of next quarter, when the
Gards begin league play.
