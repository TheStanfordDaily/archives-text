Portugal recognizes MPLA
LISBON, Portugal — Portugal yesterday recog
nized the Soviet- and Cuban-backed Popular
Movement (MPLA) in Luanda as the official gov
ernment of Angola, its last and largest African col
ony.
Foreign Minister Ernesto Melo Antunes, after an
extraordinary all-night cabinet meeting, an
nounced recognition of the Marxist government
and called for a relationship of "non
interference . . . and mutual respect" between the
two countries.
Portugal granted Angola independence last
Nov. 11 and gave the MPLA and two non-
Communist groups equal shares in governing the
new state.
Since then, the MPLA, which had controlled
only a third of the country, has routed the rival
forces, with the help of 14,000 Cuban troops and
Soviet arms.
Portugal acted after more than half of the coun
tries of the world had recognized the MPLA's
Peoples Republic of Angola, headed by President
Agostinho Neto. The most recent included Japan,
the nine nations of the West European community,
Kuwait and Peru.
Holdouts include the United States, which has
denounced the Soviet and Cuban intervention but
was stopped by Congress from actively helping
MPLA rivals.
Tass, the Soviet news agency, said yesterday a
State Department go-ahead for the Gulf Oil Co. and
Boeing Aircraft Corp. to resume business with the
MPLA regime "may be assessed as the first step
toward the establishment of U.S. diplomatic rela
tions with the MPLA government."
Dead Gls leave Vietnam
BANGKOK, Thailand — Encased in metal coffins
drapped with American flags, the remains of the
last two U.S. military men known to have been
killed in Vietnam were flown out of Saigon yester
day.
Two aides of U.S. Sen Edward Kennedy flew into
the South Vietnamese capital and returned to
Bangkok five hours later with the coffins of corpor
als Charles McMahon Jr., and Darwin L. Judge, two
Marines killed by a rocket blast one day before
communist forces captured Saigon last April.
McMahon, from Woburn, Mass., was 21 when he
died. Judge, of Marshalltown, lowa, was 19.
The two Kennedy aides — Jerry Tinker and Dale

Dehaan — called the repatriation "an important
gesture on the part of the North and South Viet
namese governments which will contribute to the
normalization of relations between the United
States and Vietnam."
The remains will be flown to the United States for
burial after being processed for positive identifica
tion at the U.S. Central Identification Laboratory,
80 miles southeast of Bangkok.
Soviet dissident detained
MOSCOW — Soviet polics forced dissident his
torian Andrei Amalrik to make a 250-mile trip over
the weekend and then released him without any
explanation, Amalrik said yesterday.
Amalrik told correspondents in his wife's Mos
cow apartment that the only reason he could i
magine for his detention was "official nervousness
before the party congress."
He was referring to the 25th congress of the
Soviet Communist party which begins tomorrow.
Some 5000 delegates from around this country and
the world have been invited.
Prior to previous congresses here, many dissi
dent intellectuals and Jewish activists have either
been held in custody or under house detention to
avoid embarrassing demonstrations.
This time, however, Amalrik and other dissi
dents believe authorities probably will not conduct
any mass roundup for fear of setting off interna
tional protests.
Amalrik, 37, said he had been grabbed on the
street by four men Friday night and taken by car to a
police station in his home district of Kaluga, about
125 miles south of Moscow.
Amalrik said he was kept in custody until early
Saturday morning and then driven north to another
police station in Borovsk, 75 miles closer to Mos
cow.
There, he was told to report back for "a talk"
about his job and residence status tomorrow. Then
he was put on a train back to Moscow.
The writer, who was released last May after five
years in prison and exile for anti-Soviet activity,
said it appeared the various Soviet police agencies
were confused as to what to do with him.
Israelis seek peace accord
JERUSALEM — The Israeli government decided
yesterday to seek a formal end to its state of war
with the Arabs as the next step toward Middle East
peace.

Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who proposed
the strategy to the cabinet, said he would advise the
United States of the decision and ask it to check the
possibility of reaching an "end to the state of war"
formula, a cabinet statement said.
The existing interim agreement with Egypt ob
liges both sides to renounce force as a means of
settling disputes. But Israeli experts say this fails
short of a non-belligerency pact, since the interim
deal is for three years only.
Israel tried to persuade Egypt to declare an end to
the state of belligerency as part of the interim a
greement, but Egypt said the formula was unac
ceptable as long as Israel occupied Arab land.
Manufacturers drill for gas
COLUMBUS, Ohio — A wildcat driller walked
into the General Motors Corp. Lordstown assembly
plant in northeastern Ohio and told officials they
had natural gas under their parking lot.
"And off we went," recalls GM spokesman Don
Postma.
Like scores of other manufacturing companies in
the Midwest, Northeast and Appalachian regions,
GM is drilling its own gas wells as insurance
against curtailments imposed by pulic utilities.
Tony Amurgis of Columbia Gas of Ohio says 65
firms in seven states are in various stages of seeking
their own supply through exploration firms,
wildcatters and contractors. About 75 percent of
them are in Ohio, one of the most critical states for
natural gas supply, Amurgis says.
The other stales he mentioned were Pennsyl
vania, New York, Virginia, West Virginia, Ken
tucky and Maryland.
The Ohio Public Utilities Commission approved
the first self-help program in late 1973. Since then,
according to PUC spokesman Paul Richards, the
commission has approved 39 applications and five
are pending.
Participation has been generally limited to large
firms including GM, Libby-Owens-Ford and Otis
Elevator. They are not in it for a profit. Some firms
are paying more for gas that comes out of their own
wells than for gas supplied by utilities.
Today's weather
Rain likely at times through today. Partly cloudy
with chance of rain tomorrow. Slightly cooler to
day. Lows in the low 40s to low 50s. Highs today
and tomorrow in the mid 50s to low 60s. Chance of
rain 70 percent today and 60 percent tonight.

Portugal recognizes MPLA
LISBON, Portugal — Portugal yesterday recog
nized the Soviet- and Cuban-backed Popular
Movement (MPLA) in Luanda as the official gov
ernment of Angola, its last and largest African col
ony.
Foreign Minister Ernesto Melo Antunes, after an
extraordinary all-night cabinet meeting, an
nounced recognition of the Marxist government
and called for a relationship of "non
interference . . . and mutual respect" between the
two countries.
Portugal granted Angola independence last
Nov. 11 and gave the MPLA and two non-
Communist groups equal shares in governing the
new state.
Since then, the MPLA, which had controlled
only a third of the country, has routed the rival
forces, with the help of 14,000 Cuban troops and
Soviet arms.
Portugal acted after more than half of the coun
tries of the world had recognized the MPLA's
Peoples Republic of Angola, headed by President
Agostinho Neto. The most recent included Japan,
the nine nations of the West European community,
Kuwait and Peru.
Holdouts include the United States, which has
denounced the Soviet and Cuban intervention but
was stopped by Congress from actively helping
MPLA rivals.
Tass, the Soviet news agency, said yesterday a
State Department go-ahead for the Gulf Oil Co. and
Boeing Aircraft Corp. to resume business with the
MPLA regime "may be assessed as the first step
toward the establishment of U.S. diplomatic rela
tions with the MPLA government."
Dead Gls leave Vietnam
BANGKOK, Thailand — Encased in metal coffins
drapped with American flags, the remains of the
last two U.S. military men known to have been
killed in Vietnam were flown out of Saigon yester
day.
Two aides of U.S. Sen Edward Kennedy flew into
the South Vietnamese capital and returned to
Bangkok five hours later with the coffins of corpor
als Charles McMahon Jr., and Darwin L. Judge, two
Marines killed by a rocket blast one day before
communist forces captured Saigon last April.
McMahon, from Woburn, Mass., was 21 when he
died. Judge, of Marshalltown, lowa, was 19.
The two Kennedy aides — Jerry Tinker and Dale

Dehaan — called the repatriation "an important
gesture on the part of the North and South Viet
namese governments which will contribute to the
normalization of relations between the United
States and Vietnam."
The remains will be flown to the United States for
burial after being processed for positive identifica
tion at the U.S. Central Identification Laboratory,
80 miles southeast of Bangkok.
Soviet dissident detained
MOSCOW — Soviet polics forced dissident his
torian Andrei Amalrik to make a 250-mile trip over
the weekend and then released him without any
explanation, Amalrik said yesterday.
Amalrik told correspondents in his wife's Mos
cow apartment that the only reason he could i
magine for his detention was "official nervousness
before the party congress."
He was referring to the 25th congress of the
Soviet Communist party which begins tomorrow.
Some 5000 delegates from around this country and
the world have been invited.
Prior to previous congresses here, many dissi
dent intellectuals and Jewish activists have either
been held in custody or under house detention to
avoid embarrassing demonstrations.
This time, however, Amalrik and other dissi
dents believe authorities probably will not conduct
any mass roundup for fear of setting off interna
tional protests.
Amalrik, 37, said he had been grabbed on the
street by four men Friday night and taken by car to a
police station in his home district of Kaluga, about
125 miles south of Moscow.
Amalrik said he was kept in custody until early
Saturday morning and then driven north to another
police station in Borovsk, 75 miles closer to Mos
cow.
There, he was told to report back for "a talk"
about his job and residence status tomorrow. Then
he was put on a train back to Moscow.
The writer, who was released last May after five
years in prison and exile for anti-Soviet activity,
said it appeared the various Soviet police agencies
were confused as to what to do with him.
Israelis seek peace accord
JERUSALEM — The Israeli government decided
yesterday to seek a formal end to its state of war
with the Arabs as the next step toward Middle East
peace.

Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who proposed
the strategy to the cabinet, said he would advise the
United States of the decision and ask it to check the
possibility of reaching an "end to the state of war"
formula, a cabinet statement said.
The existing interim agreement with Egypt ob
liges both sides to renounce force as a means of
settling disputes. But Israeli experts say this fails
short of a non-belligerency pact, since the interim
deal is for three years only.
Israel tried to persuade Egypt to declare an end to
the state of belligerency as part of the interim a
greement, but Egypt said the formula was unac
ceptable as long as Israel occupied Arab land.
Manufacturers drill for gas
COLUMBUS, Ohio — A wildcat driller walked
into the General Motors Corp. Lordstown assembly
plant in northeastern Ohio and told officials they
had natural gas under their parking lot.
"And off we went," recalls GM spokesman Don
Postma.
Like scores of other manufacturing companies in
the Midwest, Northeast and Appalachian regions,
GM is drilling its own gas wells as insurance
against curtailments imposed by pulic utilities.
Tony Amurgis of Columbia Gas of Ohio says 65
firms in seven states are in various stages of seeking
their own supply through exploration firms,
wildcatters and contractors. About 75 percent of
them are in Ohio, one of the most critical states for
natural gas supply, Amurgis says.
The other stales he mentioned were Pennsyl
vania, New York, Virginia, West Virginia, Ken
tucky and Maryland.
The Ohio Public Utilities Commission approved
the first self-help program in late 1973. Since then,
according to PUC spokesman Paul Richards, the
commission has approved 39 applications and five
are pending.
Participation has been generally limited to large
firms including GM, Libby-Owens-Ford and Otis
Elevator. They are not in it for a profit. Some firms
are paying more for gas that comes out of their own
wells than for gas supplied by utilities.

The other stales he mentioned were Pennsyl

The Ohio Public Utilities Commission approved
the first self-help program in late 1973. Since then,
according to PUC spokesman Paul Richards, the
commission has approved 39 applications and five
are pending.
Participation has been generally limited to large
firms including GM, Libby-Owens-Ford and Otis
Elevator. They are not in it for a profit. Some firms
are paying more for gas that comes out of their own

Portugal recognizes MPLA
LISBON, Portugal — Portugal yesterday recog
nized the Soviet- and Cuban-backed Popular
Movement (MPLA) in Luanda as the official gov
ernment of Angola, its last and largest African col
ony.
Foreign Minister Ernesto Melo Antunes, after an
extraordinary all-night cabinet meeting, an
nounced recognition of the Marxist government
and called for a relationship of "non
interference . . . and mutual respect" between the
two countries.
Portugal granted Angola independence last
Nov. 11 and gave the MPLA and two non-
Communist groups equal shares in governing the
new state.
Since then, the MPLA, which had controlled
only a third of the country, has routed the rival
forces, with the help of 14,000 Cuban troops and
Soviet arms.
Portugal acted after more than half of the coun
tries of the world had recognized the MPLA's
Peoples Republic of Angola, headed by President
Agostinho Neto. The most recent included Japan,
the nine nations of the West European community,
Kuwait and Peru.
Holdouts include the United States, which has
denounced the Soviet and Cuban intervention but
was stopped by Congress from actively helping
MPLA rivals.
Tass, the Soviet news agency, said yesterday a
State Department go-ahead for the Gulf Oil Co. and
Boeing Aircraft Corp. to resume business with the
MPLA regime "may be assessed as the first step
toward the establishment of U.S. diplomatic rela
tions with the MPLA government."
Dead Gls leave Vietnam
BANGKOK, Thailand — Encased in metal coffins
drapped with American flags, the remains of the
last two U.S. military men known to have been
killed in Vietnam were flown out of Saigon yester
day.
Two aides of U.S. Sen Edward Kennedy flew into
the South Vietnamese capital and returned to
Bangkok five hours later with the coffins of corpor
als Charles McMahon Jr., and Darwin L. Judge, two
Marines killed by a rocket blast one day before
communist forces captured Saigon last April.
McMahon, from Woburn, Mass., was 21 when he
died. Judge, of Marshalltown, lowa, was 19.
The two Kennedy aides — Jerry Tinker and Dale

Dehaan — called the repatriation "an important
gesture on the part of the North and South Viet
namese governments which will contribute to the
normalization of relations between the United
States and Vietnam."
The remains will be flown to the United States for
burial after being processed for positive identifica
tion at the U.S. Central Identification Laboratory,
80 miles southeast of Bangkok.
Soviet dissident detained
MOSCOW — Soviet polics forced dissident his
torian Andrei Amalrik to make a 250-mile trip over
the weekend and then released him without any
explanation, Amalrik said yesterday.
Amalrik told correspondents in his wife's Mos
cow apartment that the only reason he could i
magine for his detention was "official nervousness
before the party congress."
He was referring to the 25th congress of the
Soviet Communist party which begins tomorrow.
Some 5000 delegates from around this country and
the world have been invited.
Prior to previous congresses here, many dissi
dent intellectuals and Jewish activists have either
been held in custody or under house detention to
avoid embarrassing demonstrations.
This time, however, Amalrik and other dissi
dents believe authorities probably will not conduct
any mass roundup for fear of setting off interna
tional protests.
Amalrik, 37, said he had been grabbed on the
street by four men Friday night and taken by car to a
police station in his home district of Kaluga, about
125 miles south of Moscow.
Amalrik said he was kept in custody until early
Saturday morning and then driven north to another
police station in Borovsk, 75 miles closer to Mos
cow.
There, he was told to report back for "a talk"
about his job and residence status tomorrow. Then
he was put on a train back to Moscow.
The writer, who was released last May after five
years in prison and exile for anti-Soviet activity,
said it appeared the various Soviet police agencies
were confused as to what to do with him.
Israelis seek peace accord
JERUSALEM — The Israeli government decided
yesterday to seek a formal end to its state of war
with the Arabs as the next step toward Middle East
peace.

Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who proposed
the strategy to the cabinet, said he would advise the
United States of the decision and ask it to check the
possibility of reaching an "end to the state of war"
formula, a cabinet statement said.
The existing interim agreement with Egypt ob
liges both sides to renounce force as a means of
settling disputes. But Israeli experts say this fails
short of a non-belligerency pact, since the interim
deal is for three years only.
Israel tried to persuade Egypt to declare an end to
the state of belligerency as part of the interim a
greement, but Egypt said the formula was unac
ceptable as long as Israel occupied Arab land.
Manufacturers drill for gas
COLUMBUS, Ohio — A wildcat driller walked
into the General Motors Corp. Lordstown assembly
plant in northeastern Ohio and told officials they
had natural gas under their parking lot.
"And off we went," recalls GM spokesman Don
Postma.
Like scores of other manufacturing companies in
the Midwest, Northeast and Appalachian regions,
GM is drilling its own gas wells as insurance
against curtailments imposed by pulic utilities.
Tony Amurgis of Columbia Gas of Ohio says 65
firms in seven states are in various stages of seeking
their own supply through exploration firms,
wildcatters and contractors. About 75 percent of
them are in Ohio, one of the most critical states for
natural gas supply, Amurgis says.
The other stales he mentioned were Pennsyl
vania, New York, Virginia, West Virginia, Ken
