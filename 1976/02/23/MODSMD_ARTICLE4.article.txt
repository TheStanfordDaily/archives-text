## 
### Mike Bailey 
"Welcome to a demonstration —
while they're still legal," over 150 stu
dents were told in a noon rally against
Senate Bill One, the proposed reform
of the U.S. Criminal Code, held in
White Plaza last Friday.
The rally was sponsored by the Bay
Area Coalition Against S.l, a recently
formed organization of over 30 groups,
most from the extremes of the political
spectrum.
Sophomore Wayne Sachs, the rally's
moderator, said the bill poses several
threats to First Amendment rights.
"All of the draft board demonstra
tions" and all the press reports con
tradicting the official military version
of the Vietnam War "would have been
felonies" under S.l, he said.
United Stanford Employes (USE)
officer Roger Hardy said he favors "br
inging USE out of the
closet . . . against Senate Bill
One . . . because it promotes repres
sion of individuals who are already
repressed."
Hardy also denounced Police Cap

tain Raoul Niemeyer for allegedly
threatening to arrest Teresa
Longworth and Stephanie Onufer,
dispatchers for the Department of Pub
lic Safety, because he said they refused
to dispatch a police officer to a
burglary last Thursday.
Longworth and Onufer told USE of
ficer Glenda Jones that Niemeyer
threatened to arrest them after Onufer
dispatched an officer to a burglary who
was later called away and never re
sponded to the burglary call, Jones said
later.
Terry Bright, representing ARC, cal
led S.l a symptom of "the deepening
contradictions of capitalism."
From a free enterprise standpoint.
Bill Evers of the Stanford Libertarian
Society.called upon students "to rec
ognize that private citizens have an ab
solute right of privacy applying to
their own persons and property while
citizens and taxpayers have an abso
lute right to know everything about
government operations and ac
tivities." He emphasized that "the
question is whether government will
be the master or the servant of the
people."
Casey McKeever, representing the
Stanford Law Students' iivil Rights Re
search Council and the Stanford Chap
ter of the National Lawyers Guild,
stressed that it would be a "disturb
ingly naive miscalculation" to rely
upon the Supreme Court to invalidate
repressive features of the bill.
A representative for the Palo Alto
Branch of the Women's International
League for Peace and Freedom expres
sed concern that local group ac
tivities, particularly the protest against
nuclear power plants, could be repres
sed by the provisions of 9.1.

"Welcome to a demonstration —
while they're still legal," over 150 stu
dents were told in a noon rally against
Senate Bill One, the proposed reform
of the U.S. Criminal Code, held in
White Plaza last Friday.
The rally was sponsored by the Bay
Area Coalition Against S.l, a recently
formed organization of over 30 groups,
most from the extremes of the political
spectrum.
Sophomore Wayne Sachs, the rally's
moderator, said the bill poses several
threats to First Amendment rights.
"All of the draft board demonstra
tions" and all the press reports con
tradicting the official military version
of the Vietnam War "would have been
felonies" under S.l, he said.
United Stanford Employes (USE)
officer Roger Hardy said he favors "br
inging USE out of the
closet . . . against Senate Bill
One . . . because it promotes repres
sion of individuals who are already
repressed."
Hardy also denounced Police Cap

tain Raoul Niemeyer for allegedly
threatening to arrest Teresa
Longworth and Stephanie Onufer,
dispatchers for the Department of Pub
lic Safety, because he said they refused
to dispatch a police officer to a
burglary last Thursday.
Longworth and Onufer told USE of
ficer Glenda Jones that Niemeyer
threatened to arrest them after Onufer
dispatched an officer to a burglary who
was later called away and never re
sponded to the burglary call, Jones said
later.
Terry Bright, representing ARC, cal
led S.l a symptom of "the deepening
contradictions of capitalism."

Bill Evers of the Stanford Libertarian
Society.called upon students "to rec
ognize that private citizens have an ab
solute right of privacy applying to
their own persons and property while
citizens and taxpayers have an abso
lute right to know everything about
government operations and ac
tivities." He emphasized that "the
question is whether government will
be the master or the servant of the
people."
