Greyhound will be abandoning its
local service along El Camino Real "at
some undetermined time in the fu
ture," according to John Mauro, gen
eral manager of the San Mateo County
Transit District.
Mauro said that the San Mateo
County Transit District has made plans
to provide "a comparable service
along El Camino so that when they do
abandon it, we can effectively replace
them."
Greyhound's geneal manager in San
Francisco, D.W. Miller, said that it was
"quite premature" to speculate about
when the transfer of responsibility
from Greyhound to the transit district
would take place.
Me said his company would file a
r equest to abandon the local service
along El Camino with the Public
Utilities Commission "concurrent
with the county of San Mateo taking

over the service."
Mauro noted that the whole ques
tion of transferring responsibility will
take place within the context of a
transit district plan to develop five
year transit program.
Although he could provide no
specific figures, Mauro claimed that
Greyhound has told him it wants to
abandon the route because it is "losing
ridership and money."
According to Mauro, Greyhound
will not abandon its express runs from
San Jose and other mid-Peninsula lo
cations to San Francisco.
Mauro refused to make any definite
statements about possible changes in
the service once the county takes over,
but said. "It is our intention to move
frequently and at a lower price" than
Greyhound had done previously.
"Depending on volume, we would
hope to have service on the order of 10
to 15 minutes," he added.
