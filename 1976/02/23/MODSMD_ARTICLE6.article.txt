## Judge refuses to alter Franklin ruling 
### Jacob Young John Freed 
University of Colorado regents
violated their own hiring rules
when they refused to hire former
Assoc. English Prof. H. Bruce
P'ranklin, but were legally justified
in doing so, a U.S. district judge
ruled in Denver last week.
Franklin had been under consid
eration at the Boulder. Golo. cam
pus, but was refused a position by
the regents despite recommenda
tions from the university's presi
dent, provost and English depart
ment faculty.
U.S. District fudge Alfred
Arraj ruled that the court did not
have the right to stop the regents
from considering the possible effect
of Franklin's employment on dis
ruptions at the university and con
tributions to the school. He made
this ruling despite the fact that the
regents had rules against consider
ing such factors in hiring faculty
members.
"It would be intolerable for the
courts to interject themselves, to
emasculate the discretion of the re
gents and require an educational
institution to hirea professor whom
it deemed undesirable," Arraj
ruled.
Franklin, fired from Stanford in
1972 for "urging and inciting" stu
dents to disrupt University opera

tions and now a member of the Rut
gers University faculty, could leg
ally have his First Amendment
rights limited if his actions could
disrupt University of Colorado
functions, Arraj added.
Arraj ruled that the regents had
included illegal considerations
such as Franklin's Maoist beliefs, in
their decision, but that these had
not been the primary reasons for re
jection.
"The court finds that there were
facts which reasonably led the sev
eral defendants (the regents) to
forecast material disruption of
school discipline and the employ
ment relationship," Arraj said.
Allegations regarding Franklin's
incitement of violence here could
be legally considered in Colorado,
Arrai ruled, because the alleged in
cidents fell "outside the realm of
protected free speech and because
the pattern of conduct indicated a
substantial risk of similar occur
ences" on the Boulder campus.
Arraj's ruling came on a suit filed
by the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) attempting to prove
that the regents rejected Franklin
because, of his political views. It
also asked that Franklin be hired
and that the court order a reconsid
eration of the regents' decision.
It is not known whether Franklin
or the ACLU will appeal Arraj's de
cision.

it deemed undesirable," Arraj
ruled.
Franklin, fired from Stanford in
1972 for "urging and inciting" stu
dents to disrupt University opera

tions and now a member of the Rut
gers University faculty, could leg
ally have his First Amendment
rights limited if his actions could
disrupt University of Colorado
functions, Arraj added.
Arraj ruled that the regents had
included illegal considerations
such as Franklin's Maoist beliefs, in
their decision, but that these had
not been the primary reasons for re
jection.
"The court finds that there were
facts which reasonably led the sev
eral defendants (the regents) to
forecast material disruption of
school discipline and the employ
ment relationship," Arraj said.
Allegations regarding Franklin's
incitement of violence here could
be legally considered in Colorado,
Arrai ruled, because the alleged in
cidents fell "outside the realm of
protected free speech and because
the pattern of conduct indicated a
substantial risk of similar occur
ences" on the Boulder campus.
Arraj's ruling came on a suit filed
by the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) attempting to prove
that the regents rejected Franklin
because, of his political views. It
also asked that Franklin be hired
and that the court order a reconsid
eration of the regents' decision.
It is not known whether Franklin
or the ACLU will appeal Arraj's de
cision.

FRANKLIN RULING—A U.S. District judge ruled in Denver last week that
University of Colorado regents violated their own hiring rules when they
refused to hire lormer Assoc. English Prof. H. Rruce Franklin hut were legally
justified in doing so. This picture shows Franklin publicizing his hook at a
local bookstore in a press conference last year.
University of Colorado regents
violated their own hiring rules
when they refused to hire former
Assoc. English Prof. H. Bruce
P'ranklin, but were legally justified
in doing so, a U.S. district judge
ruled in Denver last week.
Franklin had been under consid
eration at the Boulder. Golo. cam
pus, but was refused a position by
the regents despite recommenda
tions from the university's presi
dent, provost and English depart
ment faculty.
U.S. District fudge Alfred
Arraj ruled that the court did not
have the right to stop the regents
from considering the possible effect
of Franklin's employment on dis
ruptions at the university and con
tributions to the school. He made
this ruling despite the fact that the
regents had rules against consider
ing such factors in hiring faculty
members.
"It would be intolerable for the
courts to interject themselves, to
emasculate the discretion of the re
gents and require an educational
institution to hirea professor whom
it deemed undesirable," Arraj
ruled.
