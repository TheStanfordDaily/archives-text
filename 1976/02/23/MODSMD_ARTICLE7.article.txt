## Gores Award: kiss of death? 
### 
Lan Phillips

Recently, I had occasion to walk into Prof.
Franklish's office and, to my great shock and sur
prise, found him sobbing uncontrollably by his
desk. 1 asked politely what was wrong.
"I knew something like this was bound to hap
pen sooner or later," he replied. "Just when all
seemed fine, the worst happens.,"
I was perplexed. What could be the cause for
this breakdown?
"This, look at this," he implored, his voice
breaking. A tear dripped from his red eyes onto
his desk.
. "They just awarded me the Gores Award," he
said. "Forexcellence in teaching. Oh God, why
me? Make me bald, give me athlete's foot, chop off
my fingers, burn my home.
"But this, why this?" He started sobbing again.
1 tried explaining to him what a great honor it
was to receive the Gores Award. I saw no reason
for this emotional breakdown. Surely, wouldn't
any professor be honored and delighted to receive
such recognition?
Huge sobs
"Recognition, my ass! " he splurted out bet
ween huge sobs. "How can I ever expect to receive
tenure now, with that, that thing," pointing to the
Gores Award, "hanging around my neck."
He grabbed a Kleenex and blew hard, breaking
the white silky fabric into diverse, irregular
pieces.
"I tried, believe me I tried. The last thing in the
world any untenured professor wants is that
damn Hores Award."
"Gores, sir," I said, interrupting.
"Gores, Horse .. . who needs it?" he queried.
"No one tried harder than me to avoid it. I ignored

undergraduates. I walked away from those who
approached me. I chopped my office hours to
thirty mintues a week — on Saturday mornings.
"1 ran out of class after each lecture. No stupid,
conniving undergrad was going to be able to say
that I inspired, or in fact even helped. No sir, 1 did
everything 1 could but stop giving lectures com
pletely.
"And don't think that idea didn't cross my
mind at times. 1 can't understand what hap
pened."
"Can't youappeal the decision? Tell them you're
not worthy, that there must be some mistake.
Beg."
Sigh of relief
"It wouldn't do any good. Those bastards won't
take it back. Let me tell you something. Every
other untenured professor a* this place breathed a
deep sigh of relief when I £ot that damn award
instead of them."
"Maybe it really is a mistake," 1 offered, hope
fully.
"Not a chance," he replied bitterly. "This is
their way of telling me I'm no longer* wanted
around here.
"Having this Gores Award on my record just
gives them an excuse to fire me when I come up
for tenure next year. It's all over now," he cried
out.
I couldn't stand to see him in this state. "Surely
there must be some school somewhere that will
hire you. Some school must value good teaching."
"Stanford students always were naive," he said,
and with that Franklish started clearing out his
desk.
