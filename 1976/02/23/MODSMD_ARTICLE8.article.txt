# SCIRE internship program
## 
### 
Alice Supton

It's prereg. Spring quarter.
There's so much to choose from.
One flips through the Time
Schedule, the Course Guide, the
Extra-Departmental Programs
catalogs. But one's still not sure
what to take. Or how the courses
one's interested in fit together.
Or where all this is leading. Or
how it relates to the "real world"
beyond Palm Drive.
If these thoughts are familiar,
the SCIRE pilot internship prog
ram might be appealing. One can
combine half-time field place
ment with related coursework at
Stanford for a full quarter's
academic credit.
The program is open to all
non-freshmen undergraduates.
Not new
The internship idea is not
new. For years students have
been interested in field work for
credit.
But educators have generally
asserted off-campus learning
experiences, while valuable, are
not "academic" and therefore
not creditable. SCIRE's program
is premised on the idea some
field work experiences contain
creditable activity.
SCIRE's program limits in
ternships for credit to those
which significantly augment or
extend some area of faculty in
struction. This formulation of
creditable activity gives stu
dents two responsibilities: They
must demonstrate how the
placement they select relates to
academic work at Stanford, and
concurrently with the intern
ship, they must enroll"in two
campus courses which directly
relate to their field placement.
Students can suggest any field
placement as long as they justify
their choice.

They can take a job in local
government, in business or in a
community agency. They can
conduct field research or work in
a clinical setting. Interns can
lobby for the Sierra Club, report
for the Palo Alto Times, work in
the Menlo Park City Manager's
Office, conduct experiments at
Stanford Hospital ....
SCIRE does not have a list of
suggested internships, but the
office will help any interested
student find appropriate place
ment.
Students are responsible for
selecting a departmental course
to take simultaneously with
their internships. The course
should give the background
necessary to understand the is
sues encountered in the field
placement.
A student working on an elec
toral campaign might take Polit
ical Science 190, "Political Par
ties and Pressure Groups"; a stu
dent working in a local welfare
office might enroll in Sociology
130, "Poverty and Public Pol
icy"; a student working in busi
ness might take Political Science
210, "Administrativeßehavior."
Methods course
In addition to the content
course, students must also take a
methods course. This require
ment is one outcome of the
Workshop in Social Science
Field Research jointly sponsored
by SCIRE and ARLO last fall.
At the workshop students
explained that often it was not
until they had begun assign
ments that they realized what
skills they needed to have. And
they found it difficult to pick up
the requisite methodology in an
informal way.
A student undertaking an
opinion poll for the county, for

example, needs to know inter
viewing techniques and
methods of recording and
analyzing data. The SCIRE in
ternship program is set up to
help a student acquire the skills
necessary to do the field work —
be it a research-based project or a
job in a clinical setting, business
or government office.
The fieldwork component of
the internship will be evaluated
through a project submitted by
the student at the end of the
quarter. This project, for which
the student receives seven units,
must integrate the intern's prac
tical experience with the con
cepts and analytic modes pre
sented in the content and
methods courses.
Several benefits
Internships benefit students in
several ways.
Most importantly, students
consciously identify and arrange
for educational experiences
which are based on their own in
terests. Internships also provide
students with ways to better un
derstand and apply classroom
learning; this application of
theoretical concepts in a practi
cal setting makes seemingly
abstract learning "relevant" and
more meaningful.
In addition, internships are a
means of exploring career in
terests and gaining awareness of
the day-to-day routine and re
sponsibilities of workers in a
variety of job settings. The
chance to learn work-related
skills, to experience job respon
sibility and to gain a sense <5f
competence in a work situation
are other benefits of the intern
ship experience.

catalogs. But one's still not sure
what to take. Or how the courses
one's interested in fit together.
Or where all this is leading. Or
how it relates to the "real world"
beyond Palm Drive.
If these thoughts are familiar,
the SCIRE pilot internship prog
ram might be appealing. One can
combine half-time field place
ment with related coursework at
Stanford for a full quarter's
academic credit.
The program is open to all
non-freshmen undergraduates.
Not new
The internship idea is not
new. For years students have
been interested in field work for
credit.
But educators have generally
asserted off-campus learning
experiences, while valuable, are
not "academic" and therefore
not creditable. SCIRE's program
is premised on the idea some
field work experiences contain
creditable activity.
SCIRE's program limits in
ternships for credit to those
which significantly augment or
extend some area of faculty in
struction. This formulation of
creditable activity gives stu
dents two responsibilities: They
must demonstrate how the
placement they select relates to
academic work at Stanford, and
concurrently with the intern
ship, they must enroll"in two
campus courses which directly
relate to their field placement.
Students can suggest any field
placement as long as they justify
their choice.

They can take a job in local
government, in business or in a
community agency. They can
conduct field research or work in
a clinical setting. Interns can
lobby for the Sierra Club, report
for the Palo Alto Times, work in
the Menlo Park City Manager's
Office, conduct experiments at
Stanford Hospital ....
SCIRE does not have a list of
suggested internships, but the
office will help any interested
student find appropriate place
ment.
Students are responsible for
selecting a departmental course
to take simultaneously with
their internships. The course
should give the background
necessary to understand the is
sues encountered in the field
placement.
A student working on an elec
toral campaign might take Polit
ical Science 190, "Political Par
ties and Pressure Groups"; a stu
dent working in a local welfare
office might enroll in Sociology
130, "Poverty and Public Pol
icy"; a student working in busi
ness might take Political Science
210, "Administrativeßehavior."
Methods course
In addition to the content
course, students must also take a
methods course. This require
ment is one outcome of the
Workshop in Social Science
Field Research jointly sponsored
by SCIRE and ARLO last fall.
At the workshop students
explained that often it was not
until they had begun assign
ments that they realized what
skills they needed to have. And
they found it difficult to pick up
the requisite methodology in an
informal way.
A student undertaking an
opinion poll for the county, for

example, needs to know inter
viewing techniques and
methods of recording and
analyzing data. The SCIRE in
ternship program is set up to
help a student acquire the skills
necessary to do the field work —
be it a research-based project or a
job in a clinical setting, business
or government office.
The fieldwork component of
the internship will be evaluated
through a project submitted by
the student at the end of the
quarter. This project, for which
the student receives seven units,
must integrate the intern's prac
tical experience with the con
cepts and analytic modes pre
sented in the content and
methods courses.
Several benefits
Internships benefit students in
several ways.
Most importantly, students
consciously identify and arrange
for educational experiences
which are based on their own in
terests. Internships also provide
students with ways to better un
derstand and apply classroom
learning; this application of
theoretical concepts in a practi
cal setting makes seemingly
abstract learning "relevant" and
more meaningful.
In addition, internships are a
means of exploring career in
terests and gaining awareness of
the day-to-day routine and re
sponsibilities of workers in a
variety of job settings. The
chance to learn work-related
skills, to experience job respon
sibility and to gain a sense <5f
competence in a work situation
are other benefits of the intern
ship experience.
