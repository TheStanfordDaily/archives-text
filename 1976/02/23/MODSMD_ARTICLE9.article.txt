# Guest profs: good choice

Having been a member of the original group
that invited Nguyen Huu Thai as ASSU Guest
Professor in 1974, I would like to provide
background information and clarify some issues
which have created the current controversy over
the professorships.
The decision to invite Thai was from the start
both a political and educational decision. We felt
political pressure could help free then political
prisoner Thai, a leading Vietnamese student
political leader and expert in urban planning,
from jail.
I he political nature of the selection was clearly
stated during the spring 1974 fee assessment
campaign; students chose to spend their own
money to both invite Thai and to revive the long
dormant ASSLJ guest professor program. We also
felt Stanford could benefit from learning from one
who had gained his intellectual and political "ex
pertise" from first hand experience.
This was not meant to provide a political ba
lance; this was not meant to totally represent the
interests of a majority of students. This was meant
to make a valuable addition to Stanford's highly
theoretical and supposedly value-neutral educa
tional system.
I find most criticism and defense of the selec
tion of the current guest professors to miss the
main point.

The arguments that the selection were too
"political" and specifically too "radical" ignore
the fact the people who approved the fee assess
ment approved a very political and, in his own
way, extremely radical person, to teach as their
guest professor.
It is difficult to agree that the majority has viol
ated the rights of the minority since the Guest
Professor Board's criteria (prominence as a social
or political figure, wide academic appeal in an
underrepresented field and willingness to in
teract with students) are very much in line with
the constituency that paid for the guest professor.
The arguments in defense of the board's selec
tions focus on the selections' "balancing" effect.
Any of the invited professors will be a small and
unique addition to the faculty; however, this addi
tion, like the excellent Conservative Forum prog
rams of a few years ago, cannot hope to provide a
bala nee to Stanford's liberal majority.
It is unfortunate criticism of the selection has
turned to criticism of t he guest professor program.
If anything, the controversy shows students
should hire and pay for more professors of their
own choosing.
The professors need not be political; they only
need to be supported by students willing to pay
for them.
