# Refuting the 'Stanford Tech' image
## 
### 
Although the high national rankings ac
corded most humanities and social science
departments here belie the myth that Stan
ford primarily emphasizes technical educa
tion, the recent need to cut costs has raised
fears the administration will save its
deepest cost cuts for the humanities and
social sciences.
Persons who hold such views, however,
have arrived at many erroneous conclusions
about the University's budgetary alloca
tions.
They rightly point out the University is
heavily dependent on the federal govern
ment and large corporations for financial
support. Both these entities give funds
primarily to technical research in which
they have a direct interest.
It is wrong, however, to overestimate the
support the University receives from gov
ernment contracts and corporate grants.
In recent years, for example, government
contracts have accounted for about 15 per
cent of the University's operating budget
and corporations have provided about 13
percent of annual fund dollars. Corpora
tions are expected to donate about 10 per
cent of the funds in the University's five
year, $300 million Campaign for Stanford.
Derivation of funds
This means that about three-fourths of the
University's funds are derived from tuition,
endowment income and gifts from private
donors.
Many persons have also complained the
University spends millions of dollars on
technical programs while it spends only
thousands on comparable social sciences
and humanities programs.
Indeed, to look at the vast sums spent on
the natural and applied sciences here vis a
vis the humanities and social sciences, one
might easily conclude the University is a
technical institute.
Such a conclusion, however, would be
unwarranted because it would overlook the

special needs of natural and applied science
departments.
Modest costs
The costs of a good humanities depart
ment are relatively modest. Professorial
salaries, office and classroom upkeep,
graduate student stipends and library mate
rials are the primary expenses. Natural and
applied science departments, however, not

only must carry these expenses but also they
have the added burden of needing laborat
ory equipment and other costly technical
devices.
The great differences between the finan
cial needs of the soft and the hard sciences
are crudely but dramatically illustrated by
comparing the cost of building the Stanford
Linear Accelerator (SLAC) to the cost of the
proposed new main library.
Although both are considered first-rate,
SLAC, built in 1961, cost roughly $200 mill
ion in 1976 dollars. The library, in contrast,
is expected to cost only $20 million.
Humanists and social scientists here
have also sometimes assumed that their de
partments are the only ones to experience
painful cost cuts.
Lesser cuts
But according to President Richard Ly
man, cuts in these areas have been slightly
less than in engineering and the profes
sional schools.
It is significant also to note that the first

Stanford program to be eliminated al
together because of financial problems was
a technical subject — architecture.
A number of humanists have also expres-*
sed dismay because the University has
failed to succeed in hiring certain leading
scholars to fill senior vacancies and some
scholars already here have chosen to go
elsewhere.
The Classics Department, for example,
has had two vacancies unfilled for a year.
But the number of qualified persons to fill
such billets is extremely limited and it
should not be surprising most candidates
do not want to uproot themselves to accept
positions here.
Scholars attracted
While a few distinguished scholars have
left the University in recent years, the Uni (
versity has also at the same time attracted
several leading scholars.
Several French and German professors,
for example, have been lured away from
Stanford by the University of Virginia's
Commonwealth Fund. But during its period
of expansion in the 1950s and 19605, Stan
ford recruited many faculty members from
Ivy League schools, and no one at those
colleges worried that this was a sign of their
decline.
But while critics of the University's at
titude toward the social sciences and
humanities are rash in many of their con
clusions about financial priorities here,
their protests serve a useful purpose.
In a time of budgetary stress, it would be
easy for the University to shaft the
humanities and social sciences in order to
maintain or expand technical programs in
order to attract more much-needed corpo
rate and government support. The vigilance
of such critics makes this unsettling possi
bility less likely to occur.

ernment contracts and corporate grants.
In recent years, for example, government
contracts have accounted for about 15 per
cent of the University's operating budget
and corporations have provided about 13
percent of annual fund dollars. Corpora
tions are expected to donate about 10 per
cent of the funds in the University's five
year, $300 million Campaign for Stanford.
Derivation of funds
This means that about three-fourths of the
University's funds are derived from tuition,
endowment income and gifts from private
donors.
Many persons have also complained the
University spends millions of dollars on
technical programs while it spends only
thousands on comparable social sciences
and humanities programs.
Indeed, to look at the vast sums spent on
the natural and applied sciences here vis a
vis the humanities and social sciences, one
might easily conclude the University is a
technical institute.
Such a conclusion, however, would be
unwarranted because it would overlook the

special needs of natural and applied science
departments.
Modest costs
The costs of a good humanities depart
ment are relatively modest. Professorial
salaries, office and classroom upkeep,
graduate student stipends and library mate
rials are the primary expenses. Natural and
applied science departments, however, not

only must carry these expenses but also they
have the added burden of needing laborat
ory equipment and other costly technical
devices.
The great differences between the finan
cial needs of the soft and the hard sciences
are crudely but dramatically illustrated by
comparing the cost of building the Stanford
Linear Accelerator (SLAC) to the cost of the
proposed new main library.
Although both are considered first-rate,
SLAC, built in 1961, cost roughly $200 mill
ion in 1976 dollars. The library, in contrast,
is expected to cost only $20 million.
Humanists and social scientists here
have also sometimes assumed that their de
partments are the only ones to experience
painful cost cuts.
Lesser cuts
But according to President Richard Ly
man, cuts in these areas have been slightly
less than in engineering and the profes
sional schools.
It is significant also to note that the first

Stanford program to be eliminated al
together because of financial problems was
a technical subject — architecture.
A number of humanists have also expres-*
sed dismay because the University has
failed to succeed in hiring certain leading
scholars to fill senior vacancies and some
scholars already here have chosen to go
elsewhere.
The Classics Department, for example,
has had two vacancies unfilled for a year.
But the number of qualified persons to fill
such billets is extremely limited and it
should not be surprising most candidates
do not want to uproot themselves to accept
positions here.
Scholars attracted
While a few distinguished scholars have
left the University in recent years, the Uni (
versity has also at the same time attracted
several leading scholars.
Several French and German professors,
for example, have been lured away from
Stanford by the University of Virginia's
Commonwealth Fund. But during its period
of expansion in the 1950s and 19605, Stan
ford recruited many faculty members from
Ivy League schools, and no one at those
colleges worried that this was a sign of their
decline.
But while critics of the University's at
titude toward the social sciences and
humanities are rash in many of their con
clusions about financial priorities here,
their protests serve a useful purpose.
In a time of budgetary stress, it would be
easy for the University to shaft the
humanities and social sciences in order to
maintain or expand technical programs in
order to attract more much-needed corpo
rate and government support. The vigilance
of such critics makes this unsettling possi
bility less likely to occur.

Although the high national rankings ac
corded most humanities and social science
departments here belie the myth that Stan
ford primarily emphasizes technical educa
tion, the recent need to cut costs has raised
fears the administration will save its
deepest cost cuts for the humanities and
social sciences.
Persons who hold such views, however,
have arrived at many erroneous conclusions
about the University's budgetary alloca
tions.
They rightly point out the University is
heavily dependent on the federal govern
ment and large corporations for financial
support. Both these entities give funds
primarily to technical research in which
they have a direct interest.
It is wrong, however, to overestimate the
