On guest prof criticism
Once again some of the con
servative ASSU Senators seem to
be confused.
It is curious to note that the
dominant STAND slate with its
strict party discipline has only
five members. Who were the
other seven senators mentioned
in Sen. Dan. Livingston's Feb. 13
Daily column who voted for the
nominations of the ASSU Guest
Professorship Board?
Certainly they wouldn't call
themselves a monolithic group
of radicals. I am surprised
Livingston so easily condemns
the voluntary cooperation so be
loved by most with his political
philosophy.
From what I know of the pro
cess, the Guest Professorship
Board has been at least as energe
tic in soliciting student response
as any of the senators. All those
who were suggested by students
as nominees were sent inquiries.
There was an unfortunate lack
of nominees in nonpolitical
areas. And there is a very obvi

ous reason why those who ac
cepted are of a somewhat con
troversial background.
They are the ones who are sys
tematically denied access to
academia, unlike prominent lib
eral and conservative prospects
who already have very comfort
able positions. The conservative
senators would do well to learn
the meaning of radical, as a
psychologist involved in trans
actional analysis might very
well be libertarian and still be
called radical.
Livingston's thoughts on the
abundance of radical opinion on
the Stanford campus strikes me
as a bit paranoid. He seems to
think Disorientation Week was
put on by a cowed administra
tion, and not by the Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC), which
put on the week at least partly
out of loneliness.
Perhaps Livingston would
appreciate a list of conservative
faculty members from ARC so
that he could develop his own
week.
As far as I can tell, the dissent
ing senators do not dispute the
quality of the nominees, nor the
popularity of their classes to be.
Their complaints strike me as
after the fact recognition they
had not been interested enough
to suggest viable candidates.
I suggest in their future politi
cal careers they follow the model
set by the board in soliciting stu
dent opinion.

Problem of anxiety
Tibor Machan says in his Feb.
17 Daily letter that since in the
past school-related anxiety was
accepted as one of the natural
obstacles and had to meet in
one's life there is no need to con
cern oneself with such things
today. 1 don't agree.
We know that both animals
and men respond to anxiety in a
characteristic way — a little bit
of anxiety enhances perfor
mance, but too much of it is in
hibiting and counterproductive.
With relatively minor interven
tions we can help many students

control their anxiety. Should we
withold this help?
It is not unusual for people to
be able to handle their personal
problems only to lose their abil
ity to cope when one more pres
sure, such as an examination, is
added. The resulting anxiety or
other symptoms may therefore
indicate underlying problems.
Dealing with these problems
when a person is motivated to
change them may be helpful at
that time as well as for the future.
There are problems which
students seem to have always
been concerned with. However,
general socio-economic and
political events also play a role
in the type of problems people
experience.
During the period of Vietnam,
the draft and college unrest, stu
dents seemed less preoccupied
with jobs or ways of earning a
living. Jobs were plentiful. To
day, with the change in the
economic situation and with
greatly reduced occupation and
career opportunities, students
seem preoccupied with the dif
ficulties of making it into

graduate and professional
schools or getting one of the few
open academic positions.
Competition seems much
more severe than a few years ago
when the question was not so
much whether one would get
a job but which one prefers. I
do know that such academic
pressures lead students to neg
lect their personal lives without
satisfying the need for intimacy
and personal satisfaction.
Competition interfers with
friendship: for how can one
compete with a friend, or con
versely, how close can one get to
a competitor?
Considering such factors as
competition, the general
economic condition, examina
tion anxiety and their effects on
college life, does not mean one
treats them as major disasters,
nor that he explains all the prob
lems students experience.
Being aware of them, how
ever, makes it much easier to
understand and therefore be
helpful to some students.

compete with a friend, or con

a competitor?
Considering such factors as
competition, the general
economic condition, examina

college life, does not mean one
treats them as major disasters,

Being aware of them, how

Once again some of the con
servative ASSU Senators seem to
be confused.
It is curious to note that the
dominant STAND slate with its
strict party discipline has only
five members. Who were the
other seven senators mentioned
in Sen. Dan. Livingston's Feb. 13
Daily column who voted for the
nominations of the ASSU Guest
Professorship Board?
Certainly they wouldn't call
themselves a monolithic group
of radicals. I am surprised
Livingston so easily condemns
the voluntary cooperation so be
loved by most with his political
philosophy.
From what I know of the pro
cess, the Guest Professorship
Board has been at least as energe
tic in soliciting student response
as any of the senators. All those
who were suggested by students
as nominees were sent inquiries.
There was an unfortunate lack
of nominees in nonpolitical
areas. And there is a very obvi

ous reason why those who ac
cepted are of a somewhat con
troversial background.
They are the ones who are sys
tematically denied access to
academia, unlike prominent lib
eral and conservative prospects
who already have very comfort
able positions. The conservative
senators would do well to learn
the meaning of radical, as a
psychologist involved in trans
actional analysis might very
well be libertarian and still be
called radical.
Livingston's thoughts on the
abundance of radical opinion on
the Stanford campus strikes me
as a bit paranoid. He seems to
think Disorientation Week was
put on by a cowed administra
tion, and not by the Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC), which
put on the week at least partly
out of loneliness.
Perhaps Livingston would
appreciate a list of conservative
faculty members from ARC so
that he could develop his own
week.
As far as I can tell, the dissent
ing senators do not dispute the
quality of the nominees, nor the
popularity of their classes to be.
Their complaints strike me as
after the fact recognition they
had not been interested enough
to suggest viable candidates.
I suggest in their future politi
cal careers they follow the model
set by the board in soliciting stu
dent opinion.

Problem of anxiety
Tibor Machan says in his Feb.
17 Daily letter that since in the
past school-related anxiety was
accepted as one of the natural
obstacles and had to meet in
one's life there is no need to con
cern oneself with such things
today. 1 don't agree.
We know that both animals
and men respond to anxiety in a
characteristic way — a little bit
of anxiety enhances perfor
mance, but too much of it is in
hibiting and counterproductive.
With relatively minor interven
tions we can help many students

control their anxiety. Should we
withold this help?
It is not unusual for people to
be able to handle their personal
problems only to lose their abil
ity to cope when one more pres
sure, such as an examination, is
added. The resulting anxiety or
other symptoms may therefore
indicate underlying problems.
Dealing with these problems
when a person is motivated to
change them may be helpful at
that time as well as for the future.
There are problems which
students seem to have always
been concerned with. However,
general socio-economic and
political events also play a role
in the type of problems people
experience.
During the period of Vietnam,
the draft and college unrest, stu
dents seemed less preoccupied
with jobs or ways of earning a
living. Jobs were plentiful. To
day, with the change in the
economic situation and with
greatly reduced occupation and
career opportunities, students
seem preoccupied with the dif
ficulties of making it into

graduate and professional
schools or getting one of the few
open academic positions.
Competition seems much
more severe than a few years ago
when the question was not so
much whether one would get
a job but which one prefers. I
do know that such academic
pressures lead students to neg
lect their personal lives without
satisfying the need for intimacy
and personal satisfaction.

seem preoccupied with the dif
ficulties of making it into

graduate and professional
schools or getting one of the few
open academic positions.
Competition seems much
more severe than a few years ago
when the question was not so
much whether one would get
a job but which one prefers. I
do know that such academic
pressures lead students to neg
lect their personal lives without
satisfying the need for intimacy
and personal satisfaction.
Competition interfers with
friendship: for how can one
compete with a friend, or con
versely, how close can one get to
a competitor?
Considering such factors as
competition, the general
economic condition, examina
tion anxiety and their effects on
college life, does not mean one
treats them as major disasters,
nor that he explains all the prob
lems students experience.
Being aware of them, how
ever, makes it much easier to
understand and therefore be
helpful to some students.
