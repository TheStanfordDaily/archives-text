# Forms campus historical society
## Prof eyes Stanford's past 
### Marc Zasada 
Did you know that William Hewlett and David
Packard invented the oscillator immediately
upon graduation from Stanford? Or that Alexan
der Kerenski once slept in the Kingscote Apart
ments? Or that University President David Starr
Jordan used to hold informal talks with under
graduates every Thursday night in Serra Cottage?
The resurrection and maintenance of these and
other tidbits of Stanford University history has
been taken over by a newly formed group called
the Stanford Historical Society.
Presided over by James T. Watkins IV, professor
emeritus of political science, the society will un
dertake in the coming years a number of projects
to inform and involve the Stanford community in
its own history.
These projects will include such diverse ac
tivities as preparing a history of Stanford, pub
lishing various campus guides, putting up histor
ical plaques, promoting a Stanford Hall of Fame
and keeping flowers at the Stanford family
mausoleum.
In the area of literary contribution, the group
plans not only an "all-out" history of the Univer
sity, but an encyclopedia of Stanford history, a
Stanford Chronology, a souvenir booklet for vis
itors, a guide for freshmen and the compilation of
fictional stories set on the campus.
Watkins stresses, however, that the primary
function of the Society will not be to "sit around
and read historical papers to each other," but to be
active in the "dissemination of information."
One of the first activities this spring will be an
inventory of the various historical plaques set in
and around the campus, in order to prepare a
guide for visitors. The group will also recommend
the installation of new plaques.
In addition they hope to dig out all the histori
cal portraits that lay forgotten in dusty rooms, and
promote the painting of new ones.
The society also hopes to restore the bronze
statue of the Stanford family to a prominent posi
tion on the campus, and reconstruct the old
church clock (destroyed in the 1906 quake) tower
with its original bells in a suitable location.
The proposed Stanford Hall of Fame would not

only honor outstanding educators and adminis
trators of the past, but confer "unsung hero"
awards to those whose contributions to the Uni
versity have never been brought to the attention of
the community.
Asked if he felt the Society would be capable of
generating interest on the part of students, Wat
kins pointed to the popularity of a seminar he
taught two years ago on Stanford history.
"People will never become interested in some
thing," he added, "unless they know a little about
it."
For this reason, membership in the Stanford
Historical Society is open to "alumni, students,
faculty, University staff, townspeople — anyone
interested in preserving and making better known
the story of Stanford and the ideals of its found
ers," and willing to pay $10 dues.

only honor outstanding educators and adminis
trators of the past, but confer "unsung hero"
awards to those whose contributions to the Uni
versity have never been brought to the attention of
the community.
Asked if he felt the Society would be capable of
generating interest on the part of students, Wat
kins pointed to the popularity of a seminar he
taught two years ago on Stanford history.
"People will never become interested in some
thing," he added, "unless they know a little about
it."
For this reason, membership in the Stanford
Historical Society is open to "alumni, students,
faculty, University staff, townspeople — anyone
interested in preserving and making better known
the story of Stanford and the ideals of its found
ers," and willing to pay $10 dues.

Did you know that William Hewlett and David
Packard invented the oscillator immediately
upon graduation from Stanford? Or that Alexan
der Kerenski once slept in the Kingscote Apart
ments? Or that University President David Starr
Jordan used to hold informal talks with under
graduates every Thursday night in Serra Cottage?
The resurrection and maintenance of these and
other tidbits of Stanford University history has
been taken over by a newly formed group called
the Stanford Historical Society.
Presided over by James T. Watkins IV, professor
emeritus of political science, the society will un
dertake in the coming years a number of projects
to inform and involve the Stanford community in
its own history.
These projects will include such diverse ac
tivities as preparing a history of Stanford, pub
lishing various campus guides, putting up histor
ical plaques, promoting a Stanford Hall of Fame
and keeping flowers at the Stanford family
mausoleum.
In the area of literary contribution, the group
plans not only an "all-out" history of the Univer
sity, but an encyclopedia of Stanford history, a
Stanford Chronology, a souvenir booklet for vis
itors, a guide for freshmen and the compilation of
fictional stories set on the campus.
Watkins stresses, however, that the primary
function of the Society will not be to "sit around
and read historical papers to each other," but to be
active in the "dissemination of information."
One of the first activities this spring will be an
inventory of the various historical plaques set in
and around the campus, in order to prepare a
guide for visitors. The group will also recommend
the installation of new plaques.
In addition they hope to dig out all the histori
cal portraits that lay forgotten in dusty rooms, and
promote the painting of new ones.
The society also hopes to restore the bronze
statue of the Stanford family to a prominent posi
tion on the campus, and reconstruct the old
church clock (destroyed in the 1906 quake) tower
with its original bells in a suitable location.
The proposed Stanford Hall of Fame would not

only honor outstanding educators and adminis
trators of the past, but confer "unsung hero"
awards to those whose contributions to the Uni
versity have never been brought to the attention of
the community.
