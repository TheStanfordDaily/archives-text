## Barber, Haydn and Saint-Saen S.F. Symphony's uneven performance 
### Thaddeus Carhart 
Did the previous week's uneven con
cert keep symphony-goers away, or were
all the classical music lovers across town
at the Masonic Auditorium hearing
jean-Pierre Rampal's matchless flute?
Whatever the reason, the Opera House
was far from full when Guido Ajmone-
Marsan returned to the podium on Wed
nesday night two weeks ago to conclude
his two-week engagement as guest con
ductor of the San Francisco Symphony.
And whatever the reason, the Sym
phony once again demonstrated that
under this young muestro its playing is at
best inconsistent, at times descending to a
remarkably diffident and perfunctory ap
proach to the music, as if the conductor's
presence were wholly superfluous.
The concert began with a token bit of
American fluff in this, the year of the
Bicentennial Behemoth, Samuel Barber's
Second Essay for Orchestra. First per
formed in 1942, this piece is an interest
ing, if not particularly profound, exercise
for tone color, highlighting by turn the
different orchestral sections. The majestic
trumpet fanfare which introduces the first

theme over receding strings was bright
and energetic, qualities which the brass
displayed all evening.
Similarly, the winds were delicate and
lucid throughout the program, showing
commendable unity and control with the
triplet figure of this work's polytonal
fugue. The strings, however, had a prob
lem maintaining cohesiveness, but this
short piece concluded on a tight swell of
lovely sonority.

Haydn's Symphony No. 99 followed
the Barber, and unsteady strings proved
to be its downfall. Again and again, off
pitch attacks in the first violins destroyed
the liveliness and grandeur of this de
lightful piece by the mature Haydn, pen
ned by the composer for his second and
final visit to London in 1794.
The vivace strings were decidedly rag
ged at the edges — in this case the edges
are the upper registers — and the general
lack of discipline in their ensemble work
is lamentable. (It is a curious fact that the
violins become demonstrably more erra
tic as Mr. Seiji Ozawa extends his winter
hiatus in Boston.)
In marked contrast to the sloppiness of
the strings was the superlative playing in
the woodwinds; their sublime interlude
at the beginning of the adagio was per
fectly controlled and evenly balanced.
Ajmone-Marsan brought a curiously
subdued interpretation to the score. His
phrasing lacked bite: the third movement
had none of the edge which makes
Haydn's minuets so endearing. Where
Haydn should be genial and lilting, there
was no bounce, only a lackluster account

of the score. Despite the erratic violins,
the musicianship was adequate, but the
overall conception lacked panache.
Saint-Saens' Third Symphony rounded
out the evening admirably. From the
statement of the plaintive first theme
there was a broad, bold development
equal to the vast range of effects called for
in this 1886 piece dedicated "to the mem
ory of Franz Liszt."
Saint-Saens once wrote "The soul is no
more than a means to explain the produc
tion of thought," but this score gives the
lie to that philosophy with its grandiose
conception and passionate warmth. One
was continually reminded of Berlioz'
majestic orchestration as the piano, or
gan, and a host of percussion instruments
combined to reproduce the magnificent
dynamic contrasts under the conductor's
steady hand.
Ajmone-Marsan demonstrated wel
come restraint in the allegro conclusion,
just the right touch so that the orchestra
does not gallop away with the finale.
Again, the brass are deserving of special
notice for their splendid clarity through
out a very demanding score.
