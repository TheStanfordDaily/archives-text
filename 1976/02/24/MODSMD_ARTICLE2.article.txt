### Lori Matsukawa 
Freshman housing priority will be
eliminated next year if Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton approves
a recommendation from the Commit
tee on Services to Students (COSS)
subcommittee on husing, subcommit
tee chairman Paul Sobotka announced
at last night's ASSU Senate meeting.
Sobotka said the recommendation
will not affect any currently enrolled
students and predicted that the re
commendation would meet with "no
trouble" at the Housing Office.
The subcommittee, whose purpose
was to investigate and evaluate under
graduate housing on campus, also re
commended:
—continuing the current upperclass
present resident housing priority;
—eliminating the current house fel
low position as unnecessary and re
placing it with a new senior house as
sociate position;
—placing two new theme (Italian
and American Studies) among the
three new row houses to be built by
next September;
—evaluating and improving resi
dent fellow selection processes in
view of three or four new openings for
the position next year; and
—approving the current fraternity
quota, drafting and housing
mechanisms.
Food service
Sobotka also announced that the
Food Service will put out data on food
costs for students to evaluate where
their board dollars go.
Sobotka said the subcommittee re
commended eliminating thehousefel
low position in lieu of a senior house
associate because of overlaps in both

financing and authority.
Both house fellows and senior house
associates are student staff members.
House fellows currently serve as ad
ministration liaisons between
houses and the University.
Senior house associates will be con
cerned with "functional, as well as
academic activities," said Sobotka.
"The demarcation (between a house
fellow and a resident associate) is
pretty nebulous," said Sobotka.
In addition to the approved theme
houses, the Kosher Kitchen and An
drogyne (a coed feminist theme house)
are still awaiting confirmation pend
ing selection of qualified resident fel
lows, Sobotka said.
"We have two houses on the Row
already involved in it (looking for fel
lows)," said Sobotka. "We hope the
fellows will pick up on the themes and
pursue them actively."
Approval expected
The recommendations will go be
fore Horton "piece by piece," accord
ing to Sobotka, and his approval is ex
pected.
In other action, the Senate Finance
Committee recommended allocating
$1000 of the money from the $1 ASSU
program fee assessment to the Publica
tions Board, anticipating increased
costs to the Board for printing newslet
ters and other publications previously
printed at the expense of the publish
ing organizations.
The committee also recommended
allocating $889 for an ASSU
discretionary fund to be held in re
serve for organizations requesting
funds over the next year.
"The money will be recirculated
back into the student body," Sen. Seth
Foldy a finance committee member

explained.
Senior Tim Ferguson suggested that
the ASSU Nominations Committee
change its mode of questioning when
interviewing applicants for committee
positions.
Should change questions
"For the past two years I've ap
peared before the committee,they have
asked, 'What is your opinion on such a
topic' as concerns your committee. I
feel their questions should ask what

significant topics face the committee,"
Ferguson said.
"The (nominations) committee cur
rently takes the risk of selecting a stu
dent with preconceived notions of the
committee," Ferguson said.
Committee member Tom Price re
plied that the committee evaluated the
"candidates ability to express them
selves.
"We don't look at the content of
