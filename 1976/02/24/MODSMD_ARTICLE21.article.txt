# All-Scarlatti evening'
## Valenti excels at Dink 
### Karen Caesar 
Dinkelspiel Auditorium was packed Friday
night when harpsichordist con s/orza Fernando
Valenti returned to Stanford to perform "An All-
Scarlatti Evening" that provided a few surprises
and a lot of good listening to the mostly non
student audience.
No programs or information concerning the
performance were given out, but Valenti
explained this by saying it was "much more in the
18th century spirit" to do without.
He surprised the audience by saying, too, that "I
very often don't decide which ones to play until 1
decide which ones to play."
Another reason for not distributing programs,
he said, was that "the only way to identify these
pieces is by numbers, which refer to catalogues,
which are different from each other, which are
wrong ..." So much said for programs.
"I don't know how many I'll play, so don't try
and count them," said Valenti. "I'll just play it by
the yard until I drop."
Well, there are some 600 Scarlatti harpsichord
sonatas, and though he must have played quite a
few, Valenti never dropped. He played for 70 mi
nutes, and though the audience applauded long
enough and hard enough to bring him back on
stage three times when the performance was
through, he did not play an encore.
Elegance
Valenti plays with the elegance and poise that
comes from being one of the most prominent and
experienced harpsichordists around today. He

studies the keyboard, rarely lifting his eyes from it
except to pause between sonatas.
Though his fingers seem to literally fly across
the keyboards, each note is enunciated, cleanly
played with just the right amount of emphasis and
force. He lingers over the notes when the mood
calls for it, he drones and drills up and down
monotonously and repetitively, or his fingers fly.
Valenti can handle each mood.
Fungus
In spite of his impressive performance, Valenti
was not at his best. His fingers were bandaged due
to a fungas he contracted under his fingernails,
and the bandages were an attempt to keep the
nails from falling off and thus cut down the pain.
He perspired heavdy, repeatedly using his finger
to push his glasses up because they kept sliding
down his nose.
He concluded his performance with a sonata
that he said was "not really a piece," but "an
attack of schizophrenia."
There could not be a more apt description. The
piece was filled with melodramatic contrasts of
violent drilling and pregnant pauses, and Valenti
milked the piece for all it was worth. He played
dramatic flourishes with such style and humor to
elicit laughter from the audience, while amazing
them with the speed of his fingers and his awe
some command of the instrument.
A more talented, poised, capable, and crowd
pleasing a performer could not be asked for. Val
enti and a harpsichord are all that's needed.

wrong ..." So much said for programs.
"I don't know how many I'll play, so don't try
and count them," said Valenti. "I'll just play it by
the yard until I drop."
Well, there are some 600 Scarlatti harpsichord
sonatas, and though he must have played quite a
few, Valenti never dropped. He played for 70 mi
nutes, and though the audience applauded long
enough and hard enough to bring him back on
stage three times when the performance was
through, he did not play an encore.
Elegance
Valenti plays with the elegance and poise that
comes from being one of the most prominent and
experienced harpsichordists around today. He

studies the keyboard, rarely lifting his eyes from it
except to pause between sonatas.
Though his fingers seem to literally fly across
the keyboards, each note is enunciated, cleanly
played with just the right amount of emphasis and
force. He lingers over the notes when the mood
calls for it, he drones and drills up and down
monotonously and repetitively, or his fingers fly.
Valenti can handle each mood.
Fungus
In spite of his impressive performance, Valenti
was not at his best. His fingers were bandaged due
to a fungas he contracted under his fingernails,
and the bandages were an attempt to keep the
nails from falling off and thus cut down the pain.
He perspired heavdy, repeatedly using his finger
to push his glasses up because they kept sliding
down his nose.
He concluded his performance with a sonata
that he said was "not really a piece," but "an
attack of schizophrenia."
There could not be a more apt description. The
piece was filled with melodramatic contrasts of
violent drilling and pregnant pauses, and Valenti
milked the piece for all it was worth. He played
dramatic flourishes with such style and humor to
elicit laughter from the audience, while amazing
them with the speed of his fingers and his awe
some command of the instrument.
A more talented, poised, capable, and crowd
pleasing a performer could not be asked for. Val
enti and a harpsichord are all that's needed.
Dinkelspiel Auditorium was packed Friday
night when harpsichordist con s/orza Fernando
Valenti returned to Stanford to perform "An All-
Scarlatti Evening" that provided a few surprises
and a lot of good listening to the mostly non
student audience.
No programs or information concerning the
performance were given out, but Valenti
explained this by saying it was "much more in the
18th century spirit" to do without.
He surprised the audience by saying, too, that "I
very often don't decide which ones to play until 1
decide which ones to play."
Another reason for not distributing programs,
he said, was that "the only way to identify these
pieces is by numbers, which refer to catalogues,
which are different from each other, which are
wrong ..." So much said for programs.
