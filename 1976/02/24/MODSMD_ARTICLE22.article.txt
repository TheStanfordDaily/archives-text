# Smith: concert as ritual
## 
### Sally Young 
The late show audience at the
Boarding House on Feb. 11 is a
noisy and colorful crowd enti
tled by the price of admission to
an awesome performance by
singer Patti Smith. For $5 they
will have their senses assaulted,
their animas elevated, and their
demons exorcised by the elec
trifying Smith, high priestess of
rock as primal therapy.
When she comes onstage, the
atmosphere becomes charged as
people cheer and applaud this
unseemly figure of adulation,
who looks like a cross between
Keith Richards and a rat. Smith
expends so much energy in the
opening number that one won
ders how she'll make it through
f*he whole show. She flounces
around stage, pummels the air
with her fists, gyrates against the
keyboards, and grinds along the
stage floor likean animal in heat.
The first four songs, all from
her recent Morses album, are a
tight set. and Patti maintains her
frenetic activity onstage while
the audience signals its response
by boxing the air with their fists
in imitation of herstandard stage
behavior.
During a break, people throw
her valentines and a heart
shaped cookie, which she shat
ters and throws back to her ad
mirers. Smith, as poet, then pro
ceeds to read a few of her own
verses, a string of dark images
straight from the collective un
conscious. The violence in the
mind of a high school boy is
enacted by Patti and echoed by

the screaming guitars of her
band, Television, in a drawn-out
version of "Land," also from her
Horses album.
Poetic tension
Patti's behavior is sexually
blatant and her songs are hard
core rock, but her lyrics maintain
a poetic tension through the
synthesis of the transcendental
and the bestially-immediate.
"Time," she quotes, "is like the
swinging of hips," ending with a
defiant, "fuck the clock," which
launches her band into a searing
rendition of "Time is on My
Side."
She reduces metaphysics to
existence on an animal level, the
level at which rock music is ap
pealing, and therefore has made
a successful conversion from
poet to singer.
The songs played in concert,
and most of those on her album,
area celebration of Id, concerned
with the violent dreams of a high
school punk, and the lust for
women and money; moaning,
spitting, l motioning obscenely,
Smith conjures up the anima in
all of us, who can only watch

from the audience like observers
at the orgy.
Playful
But beyond their primal
energy, her songs are rich with
the acute perceptions of the poet,
who speaks of things other than
sex, and who is, at times, simply
playful. By way of an introduc
tion to "Sympathy for the De
vil," Patti recounts that "the
devil was kicked out of heaven
for seeking knowledge and try
ing to create things," approving
him further as a "very interest
ing guy."
Smith's final bit of theatrics is
saved for the encore, when she
puts on her own guitar and pre
tends to play through "My Gen
eration." This selection effec
tively rallies the crowd in ap
preciation of the performers and
themselves, as the spunky de
fenders of what she has been ex
postulating all evening.
Smith has succeeded, with the
help of her excellent band, in
joining the most vital element of
rock, its driving beat, with the
most vital elements of poetry, its
sensual images and poetic ten
sion. Her music is of uncommon
vitality, and makes for an excit
ing and memorable concert.

energy, her songs are rich with
the acute perceptions of the poet,
who speaks of things other than
sex, and who is, at times, simply
playful. By way of an introduc
tion to "Sympathy for the De
vil," Patti recounts that "the
devil was kicked out of heaven
for seeking knowledge and try
ing to create things," approving
him further as a "very interest
ing guy."
Smith's final bit of theatrics is
saved for the encore, when she
puts on her own guitar and pre
tends to play through "My Gen
eration." This selection effec
tively rallies the crowd in ap
preciation of the performers and
themselves, as the spunky de
fenders of what she has been ex
postulating all evening.
Smith has succeeded, with the
help of her excellent band, in
joining the most vital element of
rock, its driving beat, with the
most vital elements of poetry, its
sensual images and poetic ten
sion. Her music is of uncommon
vitality, and makes for an excit
ing and memorable concert.
The late show audience at the
Boarding House on Feb. 11 is a
noisy and colorful crowd enti
tled by the price of admission to
an awesome performance by
singer Patti Smith. For $5 they
will have their senses assaulted,
their animas elevated, and their
demons exorcised by the elec
trifying Smith, high priestess of
rock as primal therapy.
When she comes onstage, the
atmosphere becomes charged as
people cheer and applaud this
unseemly figure of adulation,
who looks like a cross between
Keith Richards and a rat. Smith
expends so much energy in the
opening number that one won
ders how she'll make it through
f*he whole show. She flounces
around stage, pummels the air
with her fists, gyrates against the
keyboards, and grinds along the
stage floor likean animal in heat.
The first four songs, all from
her recent Morses album, are a
tight set. and Patti maintains her
frenetic activity onstage while
the audience signals its response
by boxing the air with their fists
in imitation of herstandard stage
behavior.
During a break, people throw
her valentines and a heart
shaped cookie, which she shat
ters and throws back to her ad
mirers. Smith, as poet, then pro
ceeds to read a few of her own
verses, a string of dark images
straight from the collective un
conscious. The violence in the
mind of a high school boy is
enacted by Patti and echoed by

the screaming guitars of her
band, Television, in a drawn-out
version of "Land," also from her
Horses album.
Poetic tension
Patti's behavior is sexually
blatant and her songs are hard
core rock, but her lyrics maintain
a poetic tension through the
synthesis of the transcendental
and the bestially-immediate.
"Time," she quotes, "is like the
swinging of hips," ending with a
defiant, "fuck the clock," which
launches her band into a searing
rendition of "Time is on My
Side."
She reduces metaphysics to
existence on an animal level, the
level at which rock music is ap
pealing, and therefore has made
a successful conversion from
poet to singer.
The songs played in concert,
and most of those on her album,
area celebration of Id, concerned
with the violent dreams of a high
school punk, and the lust for
women and money; moaning,
spitting, l motioning obscenely,
Smith conjures up the anima in
all of us, who can only watch

from the audience like observers
at the orgy.
Playful
But beyond their primal
energy, her songs are rich with
the acute perceptions of the poet,
who speaks of things other than
sex, and who is, at times, simply
playful. By way of an introduc
tion to "Sympathy for the De
vil," Patti recounts that "the
