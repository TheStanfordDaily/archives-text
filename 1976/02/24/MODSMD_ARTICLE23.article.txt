Currently on exhibit at the
Stanford Museum, Early Ameri
can Silver from the collection of
Mrs. John E. Marble is a timely
contribution to the Bicentennial
reexamination of the American
past.
The decorative arts provide an
especially fruitful medium for
such a study .Spanningthetransi
tional decades from the 1760s to
the 1840s, the show traces the
transformations in the American
self-image during this crucial
period of Revolution and early
nationhood.
As Lorenz Zitner states in the
introduction to the catalogue,
"There are times when, for par
ticular historical reasons, the
arts that are usyally considered
merely decorative and therefore
'minor', in fact play a leading
role and reflect their society with
special character."
Silver had an important func
tion both in the economic and
the social life of the colonies.
During this economically unsta
ble period, silver plate trans
formed into domestic items such
as teapots, bowls, ladies and
cups, was an ideal means of pre
serving surplus wealth. Wealth
in this readily visible and practi
cal form paid a tribute to the
prosperity and social ac
complishments of its possessor.
In the sphere of the domestic
arts, the more than 150 artisans
represented in the show expres

sed a spirit of independence and
functionalism which placed
American design on a firm and
assertive footing. The design
forms of the colonial period take
on a chaste simplicity of state
ment worlds apart from the
Rococco flourishes of European
design. Such a style suggests the
directness of approach to the de
sign problem which reflects a
society undifferentiated, at this
time,into aristocratic and popu
lar.
Economy
The silversmiths themselves
were prominent exponents of
this social style, men who dis
played a political and national
self-consciousness which made
of their work an unfiltered ex
pression of beliefs and attitudes.
Depriving its basic shapes
from the middle-class traditions
of British, Dutch and Huguenot,
American silver, like domestic
architecture and furniture de
sign, employed a characteristic
economy of methods and mate
rials.
Later, during the early
Federalist period which followd
the Revolution, American silver
more closely approximates
Neoclassical design in Europe
during the age of Republicanism
and political ferment. Re
strained and balanced in design,
it reflects a reaction to the elabo
rate and ornamental accessories
of aristocratic and courtly life in
Europe.

Economy
The silversmiths themselves
were prominent exponents of
this social style, men who dis
played a political and national
self-consciousness which made
of their work an unfiltered ex
pression of beliefs and attitudes.
Depriving its basic shapes
from the middle-class traditions
of British, Dutch and Huguenot,
American silver, like domestic
architecture and furniture de
sign, employed a characteristic
economy of methods and mate
rials.
Later, during the early
Federalist period which followd
the Revolution, American silver
more closely approximates
Neoclassical design in Europe
during the age of Republicanism
and political ferment. Re
strained and balanced in design,
it reflects a reaction to the elabo
rate and ornamental accessories
of aristocratic and courtly life in
Europe.

SCAR LATH—Fernando Valenti, noted harpsichordist, gave a de
lightful performance of Scarlatti's sonatas for harpsichord at
Stanford last week. Valenti proved to be a talented jokester as well
as musician.

Currently on exhibit at the
Stanford Museum, Early Ameri
can Silver from the collection of
Mrs. John E. Marble is a timely
contribution to the Bicentennial
reexamination of the American
past.
The decorative arts provide an
especially fruitful medium for
such a study .Spanningthetransi
tional decades from the 1760s to
the 1840s, the show traces the
transformations in the American
self-image during this crucial
period of Revolution and early
nationhood.
As Lorenz Zitner states in the
introduction to the catalogue,
"There are times when, for par
ticular historical reasons, the
arts that are usyally considered
merely decorative and therefore
'minor', in fact play a leading
role and reflect their society with
special character."
Silver had an important func
tion both in the economic and
the social life of the colonies.
During this economically unsta
ble period, silver plate trans
formed into domestic items such
as teapots, bowls, ladies and
cups, was an ideal means of pre
serving surplus wealth. Wealth
in this readily visible and practi
cal form paid a tribute to the
prosperity and social ac
complishments of its possessor.
In the sphere of the domestic
arts, the more than 150 artisans
represented in the show expres

sed a spirit of independence and
functionalism which placed
American design on a firm and
assertive footing. The design
forms of the colonial period take
on a chaste simplicity of state
ment worlds apart from the
Rococco flourishes of European
design. Such a style suggests the
directness of approach to the de
sign problem which reflects a
society undifferentiated, at this
time,into aristocratic and popu
lar.
