Donald Byrd And The
Blackbyrds came to the Great i
American Music Hall last week :
from Howard University in i
Washington, D.C. to "give you I
folks out west a lesson on how to
act."
"While you all were back here
'streakin', Byrd explained,we at
Howard were gettin' laid back
'strokin.' "
By evening's end, Byrd and
Billboard's Top Group of The
Blackbyrds, 1975 had trans
formed the primarily sedate San
Francisco crowd into 500 stom
pers gettin' down to the tunes
that have put the group on top.
The group is composed of men
who all studied under Byrd
while he was Chairman of the
Department of Music at predo
minantly black Howard. Despite
their youth, all but one are still
undergrads. yet they have been
able to become an extremely
tight group. The band came out
and talked with some of the
crowd between shows, a rarity
nowadays.
Backbone
Keith Gilroy, provides a strong
backbone for the group on
drums. On guitar, Orval Saun
ders strummed almost expres
sionless through some powerful
solos. Tall Joe Hall 111 filled in on
bass.
Steve Johnson the only grad
student handled three horns
throughout the evening. His
solos on the soprano and tenor
saxophones were both artistic
and crowd-stirring, while his
smooth and mellow tones on the
flute have come to be charac
teristic of the group's jazzy soul
sound.
Using three different
keyboards, Kevin Carter added
another strong dimension to the
sounds, while Byrd usually ac
companied them on the trumpet.
The show opened casually.
There were none of the theatrics
that usually accompany groups

playing before larger crowds.
The group merely walked out
onto the stage, plugged up and
slipped into a 15-minute version
of "I Need You," one of their
biggest hits.
Request
Surprisingly, their million
seller "Walkin' in Rhythm" was
saved for their second show of
the evening while "Flyin'
High," a big request all evening,
never showed up.
Dressed in sequined denim
patchwork jackets, the group
moved through ten numbers
ranging from early little-known
Blackbyrds to the more sophisti
cated sounds of their latest al
bum, City Life.
"We're not used to playing to
such quiet audiences," Byrd
explained as his band pounded
out a steady background. So,
about halfway through the show,
Byrd left the stage. As he re
turned, he explained, "most of
the people that come to our
shows on campus bring whistles
and horns and all sorts of
noise-making shit."
"Since the boys thought you
Bay Area folks might come un
prepared, they suggested that I
bring something to help," Byrd
said. He then pulled out a bag of
200 whistles, threw them to the
crowd, and left the rest to fate.
"Rock Creek Park," brought
the noises out and the bumpers
to their feet to stay. Deafening
approval was given the lead into
"Dominoes," off one of his
Byrd's earlier albums. "Happy
Music" lead the continuous
dancing into "Enjoy."
The small, mellow atmos
phere of the Great American
Music Hall combined with the
"East Coast strokin" of the
Blackbyrds into a draining but
rewarding show.
By the way, Clifford Ray of the
Golden State Warriors told me to
, put in my article that he liked the
; show. I looked up and decided 1
; would.
