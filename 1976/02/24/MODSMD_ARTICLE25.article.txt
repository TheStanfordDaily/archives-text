Embassy siege in Beirut ends
BEIRUT — A Lebanese gunman and four armed
relatives who seized the Canadian Embassy and
more than 20 hostages in a family argument over
possession of a Canadian island freed their captives
unharmed and surrendered to police after a day
long siege.
The gunman, who had been deported from
Canada, had demanded to talk with Canadian
Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau about what he said
was a $450,000 real estate deal that went sour be
cause of his estranged wife and a doctor friend in
Canada.
Police said Mohammed Haimour and relatives
from the mountainous Bekaa Valley seized the em
bassy and 23 hostages, but freed eight female cap
tives after tliree hours of tense negotiatins.
One of the freed women said that among those
remaining inside the building at that time were the
charge d'affaires, Allan Sullivan, and seven other
Canadian diplomats. All were later released un
harmed.
There was no shooting, and an embassy spokes
man said no one had been injured.
Stage set for N.H. primary
CONCORD, N.H. — Campaigning Democrats
reached out for final handshakes while rival Repub
lican camps mapped their get-out-the-vote drives
yesterday on the eve of New Hampshire's first step
in the long march of presidential primary elections.
In the tight race between President Ford and
former California Gov. Ronald Reagan, today's out
come could hinge on the nuts-and-bolts tasks of
getting supporters to the polls.
For the Ford camp, there was a worrisome ques
tion named Richard Nixon, whose journey to Pek
ing brought him back to public attention in the
waning days of the New Hampshire campaign.
While Ford and Reagan meet head on in New
Hampshire, five Democratic contenders will be
carving up the primary vote. That race is expected
to be close as well, with former Georgia Gov. Jimmy
Carter and Arizona Rep. Morris Udall expected to
be the top finishers.
Sen. Birch Bayh of Indiana, former Sen. Fred
Harris of Oklahoma, and 1972 vice presidential
nominee Sargent Shriver are the other nationally
rated candidates.
Court to define widower rights
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed
yesterday to spell out how far the Social Security
Administration must go in treating widowers the
same as widows.

Last March the court ruled that men left with
children on their hands must be granted benefits on
the same basis as women in that situation.
In yesterday's action the court said it will decide
whether the government may require widowers
applying for benefits to prove they were dependent
upon their spouses, although widows are not re
quird to do so.
A three-judge federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
ruled last June that the requirement is unconstitu
tional under the logic of the Supreme Court's ruling
in March.
The government defended the requirement and
said that striking it down would cost approxi
mately $400 million in widowers' benefits each
year.
Nuclear facility in Pakistan?
WASHINGTON — Pakistan is trying to buy from
France a nuclear reprocessing facility that would
enable it to produce weapons-grade material, pre
sumably to counter the development of atomic
weapons by India, the chief U.S. disarmament
negotiator said yesterday.
Fred Ikle, director of the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, told the Senate Foreign Re
lations Committee that Pakistan has no economic
justification to procure such a facility.
"The reason is the iron law of nuclear prolifera
tion," he said. "If one country confronting a princi
pal adversary proceeds to develop a nuclear explo
sive, that principal adversary will try to do the same
unless protected by a firm alliance to a nuclear
power.
Concorde landings protested
ALBANY, N.Y. — The New York State Legisla
ture gave an emphatic "no" vote yesterday to the
British-French supersonic passenger plane Con
corde.
Both houses of the legislature passed by over
whelming margins a measure to set new noise
restrictions for planes landing at airports operated
by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
The action however, requires the concurrence of
New Jersey and the approval of New York Gov.
Hugh Carey, who has expressed doubts about the
Concorde but has not stated a position on legisla
tion to ban the SST.
The noise restrictions are set low enough that
many current subsonic jets landing at Kennedy and
LaGuardia airports in New York and Neward air
port in New Jersey could also be banned.
But the legislation was written to cover only
planes not now flying into the airports — specifi
cally, the Concorde.

A motorcade of 1500 cars protesting planned
flights of the Concorde slowed traffic on main roads
at Kennedy for 2Vi hours Sunday. The de
monstrators came from communities near the air
port.
City-growth restriction allowed
WASHINGTON — A Supreme Court decision
yesterday upholding a lower court ruling allowing
Fetaluma, Calif., to restrict construction of new
housing has brought stern criticism from state labor
representatives.
The court refused to hear conflicting claims by a
group of trade associations and the City of Petal uma
about a city plan restricting new-home construc
tion to 500 units per year.
The decision was seen as a blow to the home
building industry and a victory for backers of
restricted city growth.
"That's just great!" said Petaluma Asst. City
Manager David Breninger, after learning of the
court's one-sentence decision. "We're very elated
because the court has upheld the city's right to
determine its own destiny.
But John Henning, executive secretary-treasurer
of the California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, which
represents 1.7 million California laborers, pre
dicted the court decision will increase unemploy
ment and hinder racial minorities seeking to escape
city slums.
Sales of contraceptive halted
PALO ALTO — At the request of the Federal
Food and Drug Administration, Syntex Corp. an
nounced yesterday that it will halt sales of a birth
control pill called Norquen R.
"The company's action followed an FDA request
to all manufacturers of sequential oral contracep
tives that these products should be discontinued in
the United States," said a spokesman for Syntex.
"Although scientific evidence is not conclusive
to support this action, Syntex has decided to com
ply with the FDA request."
Syntex advised women using Norquen not to in
terrupt their current cycle of pills until they consult
with a doctor about changing to another form of
contraception.
