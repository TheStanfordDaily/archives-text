# Hearst leaves stand; warned of contempt
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” Patricia
Hearst ignored a warning from her
judge yesterday and invoked the Fifth
Amendment 42 times under cross
examination in her bank robbery trial.
She also testified that she was pres
sured into writing of a desire for sexual
relations with her terrorist captors, in
cluding a man she swore had raped
her.
Hearst ended six days on the witness
stand by risking a contempt of court
citation which U.S. District Court
Judge Oliver Carter said he could issue
for refusing to answer questions which
the heiress said could incriminate and
endanger her.
But U.S. Atty. James Browning Jr
never specifically asked her about he
alleged involvement in plans for bank
robberies in Sacramento during the
12-month period she remained with
the Symbionese Liberation Army
(SLA) "soldiers" who had kidnaped
her in February 1974.
Willing struggle?
Browning tried to show that Hearst
was intimately aligned with her cap
tors and chose willingly to "struggle
with the SLA." Thus, the jury did not
hear of her possible involvement in
other crimes but did hear her cite the
Fifth Amendment despite the judge's
warning.

Carter did elicit admissions that
Hearst was co-author of writings on
her sexual involvements within the
SLA. But in a rambling response,
Hearst maintained that she wrote of
her sexual inclinations only to end a
fight with a member of the SLA.
Manuscripts
Browning, who won his fight to
question Hearst on damaging docu
ments found in her last hideout,
showed her the manuscript featuring
her own blue-ink handwriting and the
red-inkwriting of SLA member Wil

liani Harris. Then Browning asked
about the words.
Q. Is it true that the lust sentence of
that handwriting of William Harris is,
'Gelina (SLA member Angela Atwood)
then asked hur again ... if she was
sexually attracted to anyone in the cell
and you crossed out the 'sexually at
tracted' and placed, in your own
handwriting, 'wanted to fuck.' Isn't
that true?
A. That's not exactly how it hap
pened.
