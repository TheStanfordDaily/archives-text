# Hearst leaves stand; warned of contempt
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” Patricia
Hearst ignored a warning from her
judge yesterday and invoked the Fifth
Amendment 42 times under cross
examination in her bank robbery trial.
She also testified that she was pres
sured into writing of a desire for sexual
relations with her terrorist captors, in
cluding a man she swore had raped
her.
Hearst ended six days on the witness
stand by risking a contempt of court
citation which U.S. District Court
Judge Oliver Carter said he could issue
for refusing to answer questions which
the heiress said could incriminate and
endanger her.
But U.S. Atty. James Browning Jr
never specifically asked her about he
alleged involvement in plans for bank
robberies in Sacramento during the
12-month period she remained with
the Symbionese Liberation Army
(SLA) "soldiers" who had kidnaped
her in February 1974.
Willing struggle?
Browning tried to show that Hearst
was intimately aligned with her cap
tors and chose willingly to "struggle
with the SLA." Thus, the jury did not
hear of her possible involvement in
other crimes but did hear her cite the
Fifth Amendment despite the judge's
warning.

Carter did elicit admissions that
Hearst was co-author of writings on
her sexual involvements within the
SLA. But in a rambling response,
Hearst maintained that she wrote of
her sexual inclinations only to end a
fight with a member of the SLA.
Manuscripts
Browning, who won his fight to
question Hearst on damaging docu
ments found in her last hideout,
showed her the manuscript featuring
her own blue-ink handwriting and the
red-inkwriting of SLA member Wil

liani Harris. Then Browning asked
about the words.
Q. Is it true that the lust sentence of
that handwriting of William Harris is,
'Gelina (SLA member Angela Atwood)
then asked hur again ... if she was
sexually attracted to anyone in the cell
and you crossed out the 'sexually at
tracted' and placed, in your own
handwriting, 'wanted to fuck.' Isn't
that true?
A. That's not exactly how it hap
pened.
Q. Well, tell us how it happened.
A. William Harris was writing this
thing in a book about whether I wanted
to have sex with William Wolfe and I
had a fight with him about it, and what
I wrote in there was like the end of the
fight because I didn't feel like I ever
wanted to talk about any of that again
and he gave me a black eye and that's
the way it was left.
Q. Did he force you to write that in
terlineation on this document?
A. It was part of a fight.
Treated at hospital
Browning, pressing the point again
that Hearst had chances to escape dur
ing her fugitive months, also elicited
her admission that on Aug. 12, 1975,
slightly more than a month before her
capture, she was treated at a San Fran
cisco hospital for poison oak and did
not reveal her true identity.
After Hearst was dismissed from the
witness stand, her defense called one of
three psychiatrists it is expected to
summon before resting its case.
Dr. L.J. West, on the stand when the
trial recessed yesterday, described
Hearst's behavior after her arrest as
similar to that of a prisoner of war.
West, head of the Neuropsychiatric
Institute at the University of California
at Los Angeles, said she showed signs
of the "survivor's syndrome . . . that of
someone experiencing a profound
fear."
He said he interviewed and tested
Hearst in jail and found in one test that
she suffered "a lack of self-esteem and
a badly shattered pride."
He also said Hearst's time with the
SLA had left her with memory im
pairment and an IQ that had dropped
from 130 to 109.
