NEW YORK (AP) â€” CBS newsman
Daniel Schorr, who has admitted re
leasing a secret House intelligence re
port to a weekly newspaper, was inde
finitely suspended from reporting
duties by the network yesterday.
Schorr admitted releasing the report
prepared by the House committee on
intelligence operations of the govern
ment to the Village Voice a weekly
published in New York's Greenwich
Village.
CBS, in a statement released by Pres
ident Richard Salant, noted that gov
ernment investigations have been cal
led to determine whether Schorr can
be prosecuted for releasing the secret
report.
"In view of the adversary situations
in which Dan Schorr is placed in pend
ing government investigations, he has
agreed with CBS that he will be re
lieved of all reporting duties for an in
definite period," Salant's statement
said.
It said the network would provide
legal counsel to Schorr "insofar as in
vestigations relating to his CBS news

activities are concerned" and said the
network "will fully support Mr. Schorr
against attempts to require him to re
veal the source through which he ob
tained the report.
These aspects of the matter involve
fundamental issues of press freedom."
The House has ordered its Ethics
Committee to investigate the leak of its
report and determine if any action
should be taken against Schorr. The
Justice Department indicated it was
also considering a probe.
The report, still classified as secret,
was published in two parts by the
Voice. Much of what was in the report
already had been reported by Schorr
and others.
"I decided." Schorr said in a public
statement last week, "that with
much of the contents already known I
could not be the one responsible for
suppressing the report."
Schorr, 59. joined CBS News in 1953
after working on the New York Times
and Christian Science Monitor. Fie has
been assigned to Washington since
1966 and won an Emmy Award in
1973 for a segment on Watergate.
