# Statistics profs criticize pollution studies

"A great many of the studies of the
effects of air pollution on health,
which involved millions of dollars in
taxpayers' money, were not planned
with the advice of statisticians," ac
cording to Statistics Prof. Tom Sager.
He added that a "number of reputa
ble clinical studies were rather shod
dily done" onairpollutionand health.
Sager's conclusions were a result of
special Statistics Department investi
gations funded by a branch of the na
tional Society for Industrial and
Applied Mechanics (SIAM), the SLAM
Institute for Mathematics and Society
(SIMS).
Under the direction of Assoc. Statis
tics Prof. Paul Switzer, Professors
Sager , Lincoln Moses, Ingram Olkin
and Assistant Professors Yash Mittal
and Persi Diaconis are conducting
several projects on the health effects of
pollution and pollution forecasting,
according to a Statistics Department
press release.

The department holds weekly semi
nars on the biological and environ
mental effects of air pollution, Sager
said, inviting outside experts in the
field to speak.
The Stanford SIMS project, a joint
effort with Columbia University, em
phasizes the need tor using mathema
tics in dealing with society's prob
lems. An April, 1975, outline of the
program calls applied statistical
analysis a mathematical area with
promise in solving environmental
problems.
Stanford statisticians can help in
creating and analyzing environmental
experiments, Sager said. He added that
he is currently estimating the distribu
tion of pollutants in specific geog
raphicareasand their effects on health.
Diaconis is presently investigating
the relationship between pollution
levels and mortality rates, Sager said,
and is questioning a theory that the
1974 fuel crisis lowered the mortality
rate.
Moses is creating a statistical model

to aid in pollution level prediction,
Sager said.
Environmental statistics is a wholly
new field and the department here is
one of the pioneers in the area, accord
ing to Sager. The SIMS project estab
lished in 1974. is "unique in the Un
ited States." he said.
No students are presently studying
to become environmental statisticians
at any U.S. university, Sager said, ad
ding that there is "a great future for
students" in the field. Creating a
graduate program in environmental
statistics is one of SIMS' major goals,
Sager added, and SIMS may award fel
lowships and grants to the field's stu
dents in the future.
Air pollution forecasting, a major
SIMS concern, has not met with much
success, according to Sager. "Elabo
rate models are not much more reliable
than the technique of measuring the
weather and the pollution today and
predicting the sa'me for tomorrow."
commented Tim Greene, a graduate
statistics major.

ro call attention to the SIMS prog
ram and the problems of pollution
prediction, Greene said he has or
ganized a SIMS-sponsored pollution
prediction contest. Students will be
provided with pollution statistics and
asked to predict pollution levels in
Redwood City and Sunnyvale for the
week of Feb. 29 â€” Mar. 6, Greene said.
Those predictions will be compared
with actual pollution measurments
from the Bay Area Pollution Control
District and the contestants coming
closest to the actual pollutant level
will be awarded cash prizes, Greene
added.
"Since the department is fairly small
and has no undergraduate majors, un
dergrads don'* realize that Stanford
probably has the best theoretical statis
tics department in the country,'Greene
said.
. "This content will try to publicize
the department as well as the fact that
statisticians actually do real-life prob
lem solving," he added.
