# Night life report: the pediatrics ward
## 
### Paige Cherno 
Renee is chatting on the phone, giving in
structions about the care and feeding of a pet
rabbit. Sophie and Jim are shooting pool in the
game room. Kirk is asking everybody for sugges
tions for an upcoming Valentine's party. A typi
cal dorm evening? No. A typical evening in the
pediatrics ward at the Stanford Hospital.
Renee Cooley and Sophie James are teenage
patients. Jim Taylor and Kirk Ingebretsen are
co-chairmen of the Stanford Aides, a group of 23
University students who volunteer to spend one
evening per week visiting the five oldest girls
and the five oldest boys in the ward.
At 6 p.m. seven days a week, three aides arrive
for a three-hour period. Taylor, a junior mechan
ical engineering major, says that the aides "talk,
play pool with the kids who can get up and walk
around, play games and watch TV. We have
pizza bakes for birthdays, plan special parties
and bring in any talent we can dig up. like
guitar-playing friends."
Main goals
The main goals, according to Taylor, are to
"alleviate the boredom, show the patients some
one really cares and keep them from thinking
about the situation."
Ingebretsen. a junior in human biology, adds,
"We do whatever they want to do. And unlike
most of their visitors, we are not constantly ask
ing, 'How do you feel?' "
Pediatrics Recreation Director Bettv Lovelace

emphasizes that the aides are "non-uniformed
peer counselors, here strictly as friends to pro
vide diversion."
Before the Stanford Aides program, modeled
after a similar program at Yale, began a year ago,
Lovelace says the hospital staff was "very aware
that teenagers had needs that weren't being
met."
She points out, for example, that the 16 to
18-year-old "candystripers" (volunteerhospital
aids performing general tasks)"over-identified"
with the teenage patients while the "pink
ladies" (older volunteers) compounded the
"matriarchal society" of the hospital.
The aides, male and female and older than the
candystripers, solved both problems. Lovelace
says she is "particularly pleased with the per
centage of males" who participate.
"We're very pleased with the program,"
Lovelace says. "Patients, parents and staff all
appreciate it."
Parents enjoy having a third party join their
conversations. Ingebretsen says. "They are with
their kids hours on end and run out of things to
talk about."
Relieve parents
The aides relieve parents who "don't have
much to say to their kids," Taylor says."The
parents "have problems playing with their kids
— they don't know how to do it anymore."
Aide Hallie Katz. a junior in human biology
and psychology, adds that parents who cannot

come in for some reason "don't feel that badly"
knowing that someone is there. Many of the pa
tients are not local residents, according to
Lovelace.
The patients are in the hospital "for anything
from tonsils to chronic conditions," according
to Taylor. He says the average stay is five days.
"The ones who really appreciate our coming
are the kids who have been here for a longtime,"
Ingebretsen says.
A crush
Renee, a high school sophomore, is a return
ing patient. She says she likes the aides' visits
because they "do whatever you want to do. I like
to just talk," she adds.
The student-run program has met with few, if
any, problems, and the aides speak highly of
their relations with the hospital staff.
ludy Cramer, Lovelace's assistant, is on duty
during evening hours. Katz says, "She is so
gung-ho about the whole thing. That has a lot to
do with the good feeling you get when you work
there."
"Judy and 1 met with them as a group at the
beginning of the year to make sure they under
stood our goals," notes Lovelace. "We provide
supervision and introduce them to the patients.
But we really let them be very flexible."
Taylor and Ingebretsen screen candidates and
set up the schedules. Taylor says the hospital
requires only that all aides join the volunteer
auxiliary and attend an orientation session.
