The report of the House of Representa
tives select intelligence committee ap
peared a few days ago in the New York
Village Voice. Both the publishing of the
report and the report itself pose serious
problems both to our Constitution and
nation.
The House committee was dismayed
at the budgets for our intelligence agen
cies and the way in which taxpayers'
money is used and reported. The com
mittee particularly criticized members
of the executive branch, as "Executive
officials do not stress the lack of a cen
tralized budget authority in the intelli
gence services, which causes enormous
waste, duplication and hidden costs in
military intelligence."
The committee also described to what
purposes this money was put. In one in
stance, the committee described the
Middle East war of 1973, saying "it gave
the intelligence community a real test of
how it can perform when all its best
technology and human skills are focused
on a known world hot spot. It failed."
As for domestic intelligence, the
committee discussed the collection of
garbage from the Institute for Policy
Studies by the FBI. Material in this gar
bage disclosed sexual information.
According to the committee's report,
"FBI officials told committee staff, under
oath, that personal information, such as
sexual activities, is discarded if it does
not bear upon a crime. That was not true.
Information from the trash retrieval, in
cluding the sexual gossip, was included
into a number of reports."

We are appalled at the conduct of both
our foreign and domestic intelligence
agencies and that of other members of
the executive branch. They appear to
have engaged in massive waste, fraud,
gross ineptitude and have possibly
committed felonies — and just two years
after Watergate.
CBS correspondent Daniel Schorr has
admitted leaking this report to the Vil
lage Voice. However, the Village Voice
had to make a contribution to the Repor
ters' Committee for Freedom of the Press
in order to receive the report.
While we feel Schorr was correctly
performing his duties as a newsman in
transmitting this report to the public, he
denigrated the First Amendment's free
dom of press guarantee. Schorr should
not have made the publication of this
report be part of a financial transaction.
Rep. Samuel Stratton (D-N.Y.) is at
tempting to have Schorr held in con
tempt of Congress. Because the
government is going to investigate
Schorr's role in the leaking of this report,
he was suspended from CBS yesterday.
Schorr, commenting last week on
Stratton's attempts to have him held in
contempt, said "I do not understand the
constitutional basis for Congressman
Stratton's action. I have tried to fulfill
what I consider my constitutional obli
gation. I hope he will fulfill his."
We agree. Neither Congress nor the
Justice Department should take any ac
tion against Schorr for his participation
in the publication of this report.

purposes this money was put. In one in
stance, the committee described the
Middle East war of 1973, saying "it gave
the intelligence community a real test of
how it can perform when all its best
technology and human skills are focused
on a known world hot spot. It failed."
As for domestic intelligence, the
committee discussed the collection of
garbage from the Institute for Policy
Studies by the FBI. Material in this gar
bage disclosed sexual information.
According to the committee's report,
"FBI officials told committee staff, under
oath, that personal information, such as
sexual activities, is discarded if it does
not bear upon a crime. That was not true.
Information from the trash retrieval, in
cluding the sexual gossip, was included
into a number of reports."

We are appalled at the conduct of both
our foreign and domestic intelligence
agencies and that of other members of
the executive branch. They appear to
have engaged in massive waste, fraud,
gross ineptitude and have possibly
committed felonies — and just two years
after Watergate.
CBS correspondent Daniel Schorr has
admitted leaking this report to the Vil
lage Voice. However, the Village Voice
had to make a contribution to the Repor
ters' Committee for Freedom of the Press
in order to receive the report.
While we feel Schorr was correctly
performing his duties as a newsman in
transmitting this report to the public, he
denigrated the First Amendment's free
dom of press guarantee. Schorr should
not have made the publication of this
report be part of a financial transaction.
Rep. Samuel Stratton (D-N.Y.) is at
tempting to have Schorr held in con
tempt of Congress. Because the
government is going to investigate
Schorr's role in the leaking of this report,
he was suspended from CBS yesterday.
Schorr, commenting last week on
Stratton's attempts to have him held in
contempt, said "I do not understand the
constitutional basis for Congressman
Stratton's action. I have tried to fulfill
what I consider my constitutional obli
gation. I hope he will fulfill his."
We agree. Neither Congress nor the
Justice Department should take any ac
tion against Schorr for his participation
in the publication of this report.
The report of the House of Representa
tives select intelligence committee ap
peared a few days ago in the New York
Village Voice. Both the publishing of the
report and the report itself pose serious
problems both to our Constitution and
nation.
The House committee was dismayed
at the budgets for our intelligence agen
cies and the way in which taxpayers'
money is used and reported. The com
mittee particularly criticized members
of the executive branch, as "Executive
officials do not stress the lack of a cen
tralized budget authority in the intelli
gence services, which causes enormous
waste, duplication and hidden costs in
military intelligence."
The committee also described to what
purposes this money was put. In one in
stance, the committee described the

the intelligence community a real test of
