# Minority construction hiring
##

John Lerry

I am responding to Henry Or
gan's Feb. 9 Daily column enti
tled "Construction hirings
biased," not only because it im
punes the University but it also
sullies the sincere and hard
working efforts of several dedi
cated employes.
No one believes that Equal
Employment Opportunity is an
easy task, but if intelligent and
diligent efforts are being made
with positive yet practical re
sults, the negativism expressed
by Organ's rhetoric and his emo
tional but baseless comments do
more to discourage than to help.
What are the facts that re
spond to Organ's observations?
There are two elements of the
program in the overview of this
article — minority construction
workers and contractors.
As to item one, the Construc
tion Office has had a policy in
this area for about nine years. In
more recent times we have been
assisted through the Santa Clara
Plan, a joint agreement between
contractor associations, trade
unions and minority group or
ganizations.
All but a few unions and con
tractors are signatories to this
plan, and compliance with its
minority employment goals is a
requirement not only of Stanford
but of the federal government. In
broad terms this requirement is
for best efforts to be made to sec
ure an overall average between
18 and 21 percent minority
employment in all trades
throughout Santa Clara County.

(The minority population of the
county is approximately 17 per
cent chicano, 1.7 percent black
and 4 percent other.)
Stanford, with the advice of
the External Affirmative Action
Panel, chose to insist in its con
ditions for bidding that this goal
be applied to projects on cam
pus, not just across the county.
Quarterly percentages of
minority workers on construc
tion projects here since 1974 (in
cluding laborers) are:
First quarter, 1974, 3 5 percent;
second quarter, 31; third quarter,
36; fourth quarter, 32; first quar
ter 1975, 21; second quarter, 28;
third quarter, 27; fourth quarter,
28.
Percentages excluding labor
ers were:
First quarter 1974, 22.7; sec
ond quarter, 19.7; third quarter,
21.8; fourth quarter, 22.4; first
quarter 1975, 16.2; second quar
ter, 22.6; third quarter, 22.2;
fourth quarter, 23.0.
For obvious reasons the plan
itself excludes laborers, so the
numbers are very significant be
cause they illustrate that in spite
of there not being "good times"
the target has been maintained
— in fact, it has been brought
back by efforts of my staff from
the sudden drop of the recession
at the end of 1974.
Let us examine what the Plan
is all about: It is to get more
minorities employed and the fi
gures speak for themselves be
cause the increases have been

highly noticeable in the appren
tices in all trades. I, for one, re
fuse to be confused by the facts.
Payments are withheld from
contractors who fail to make best
efforts to meet all goals.
How about minority contrac
tors? Here, the efforts have been
more recent but the effects have
been good. Whereas two years
ago only a handful of minority
contractors were bidding with
us, in the past year or so the
number has swelled to about
120, of whom 35 were awarded a
contract.
This situation has been
brought about by the efforts of
staff, but only by close coopera
tion with contractors. Again, it is
a gradual building process
which grows only so long as we
are never satisfied.
I need the constructive criti
cism which I am sure Organ in
tended, but I can only be spurred
by people working with me and
with the minority community
and organizations — not by
phrases such as "willful financ
ing of racism in employment."
It is quite untrue to say there is
no manning of Affirmative Ac
tion on construction contracts;
there is probably the equivalent
of four person days per week de
voted to this element of Equal
Employment Opportunity alone.
This in itself speaks to whether
the University "puts its money
where its mouth is."

with positive yet practical re
sults, the negativism expressed
by Organ's rhetoric and his emo
tional but baseless comments do
more to discourage than to help.
What are the facts that re
spond to Organ's observations?
There are two elements of the
program in the overview of this
article — minority construction
workers and contractors.
As to item one, the Construc
tion Office has had a policy in
this area for about nine years. In
more recent times we have been
assisted through the Santa Clara
Plan, a joint agreement between
contractor associations, trade
unions and minority group or
ganizations.
All but a few unions and con
tractors are signatories to this
plan, and compliance with its
minority employment goals is a
requirement not only of Stanford
but of the federal government. In
broad terms this requirement is
for best efforts to be made to sec
ure an overall average between
18 and 21 percent minority
employment in all trades
throughout Santa Clara County.

(The minority population of the
county is approximately 17 per
cent chicano, 1.7 percent black
and 4 percent other.)
Stanford, with the advice of
the External Affirmative Action
Panel, chose to insist in its con
ditions for bidding that this goal
be applied to projects on cam
pus, not just across the county.
Quarterly percentages of
minority workers on construc
tion projects here since 1974 (in
cluding laborers) are:
First quarter, 1974, 3 5 percent;
second quarter, 31; third quarter,
36; fourth quarter, 32; first quar
ter 1975, 21; second quarter, 28;
third quarter, 27; fourth quarter,
28.
Percentages excluding labor
ers were:
First quarter 1974, 22.7; sec
ond quarter, 19.7; third quarter,
21.8; fourth quarter, 22.4; first
quarter 1975, 16.2; second quar
ter, 22.6; third quarter, 22.2;
fourth quarter, 23.0.
For obvious reasons the plan
itself excludes laborers, so the
numbers are very significant be
cause they illustrate that in spite
of there not being "good times"
the target has been maintained
— in fact, it has been brought
back by efforts of my staff from
the sudden drop of the recession
at the end of 1974.
Let us examine what the Plan
is all about: It is to get more
minorities employed and the fi
gures speak for themselves be
cause the increases have been

highly noticeable in the appren
tices in all trades. I, for one, re
fuse to be confused by the facts.
Payments are withheld from
contractors who fail to make best
efforts to meet all goals.
How about minority contrac
tors? Here, the efforts have been
more recent but the effects have
been good. Whereas two years
ago only a handful of minority
contractors were bidding with
us, in the past year or so the
number has swelled to about
120, of whom 35 were awarded a
contract.
This situation has been
brought about by the efforts of
staff, but only by close coopera
tion with contractors. Again, it is
a gradual building process
which grows only so long as we
are never satisfied.
I need the constructive criti
cism which I am sure Organ in
tended, but I can only be spurred
by people working with me and
with the minority community
and organizations — not by
phrases such as "willful financ
ing of racism in employment."
It is quite untrue to say there is
no manning of Affirmative Ac
tion on construction contracts;
there is probably the equivalent
of four person days per week de
voted to this element of Equal
Employment Opportunity alone.
This in itself speaks to whether
the University "puts its money
where its mouth is."

struction and engineering in the
