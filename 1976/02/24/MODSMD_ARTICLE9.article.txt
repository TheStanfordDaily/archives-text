# Davis well-qualified to be guest prof

Mark Davis

It is always hard for me to understand
why people write opinion columns like Jor
dan Lorence's discussion (?) of Angela
Davis' likely appearance at Stanford next
quarter.
His analogy of her visit to that of Josh
McDowell was only surpassed in inaccu
racy and unmitigated bias by his amazingly
cynical unwillingnesstoadmit the possibil
ity she might be a good teacher and may
have some valuable and/or interesting
ideas.
Davis' visit is the culmination of a well
planned and, in my opinion, unbiased
selection procedure that provided more
than adequate opportunity for students to
suggest Cuest Professorship candidates.
Given the intent of the Guest Professorship
Board (i.e., tocomplementand balance exis
tent course offerings), Angela Davis' unique
perspectives on modern America, com
bined with her excellent philosophical
training, make her an ideal candidate.
She has nof been hailed as the messiah of
the Stanford left; rather the attitude of most

people towards her is that her proposed
course on marxism will simply blend into
the spring-quarter sun while giving stu
dents interested in marxism a chance to in
crease their knowledge.
Insults integrity
By suggesting Angela Davis' visit has
strangely evangelical overtones, Lorence
insults the integrity not only of the board
and of the students who wish to bring her
here, but also the integrity of a professional
philosopher.
While the Philosophy Department was
determining its position concerning Angela
Davis' arrival, students assembled informa
tion concerning her education at Brandeis
and Berkeley, and her teaching at UCLA. At
Brandeis she was a Phi Beta Kappa and at
Berkeley had finished the course work for
her Ph.D. in Philosophy.
She was working on her dissertation
when the Marin County shoot-out ended
her studies. The recommendations and as
sessments of her teaching while a professor
at UCLA give her uniformly superior rat
ings.

The reports are filled with comments that
she carefully separated her politics and
teaching, and that she very satisfactorily
performed her teaching duties (e.g., keeping
office hours, doing committee work).
Teaching ability
Personally, I am somewhat bothered by
Davis' alleged involvement in the shootout,
but she was acquitted and has not partici
pated in any violence since. Besides, this
issue should be irrelevant in considering
her teaching ability.
I do not plan to take her class as my in
terests currently lie elsewhere and, further, I
doubt she is the best person available to
teach marxism. But her qualifications are
certainly sufficient.
She deserves a chance to demonstrate her
abilities as a professor and her qualities as a
person. It can only be hoped people will
examine the situation more honestly and
carefully than has Lorence.
Perhaps we even ought to let Angela
Davis speak for herself.
fMurk Davis is a senior in philosophy.)
