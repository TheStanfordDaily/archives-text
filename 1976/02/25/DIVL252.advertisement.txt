Carlo Rossi Burgundy
"The wine with the promise of a kiss"
Salute:
My name is "Carlo" Rossi. As you know, it
takes good grapes to make good wine. The grapes in
Carlo Rossi California Burgundy receive plenty of
sunshine during the day and cool breezes during the
night. The warmth makes them develop the body and
character I like in a burgundy. The coolness develops
the deep color and adds complexity to the flavor.
When you taste Carlo Rossi Burgundy, notice
the clarity and the deep, ruby-red color. Then
swirl it in your glass, sniff the wine and experience
the fruity, complex aroma, THE PROMISE OF A KISS TO
COME. Then taste the wine. Bacio dolce!
I believe you will enjoy Carlo Rossi Burgundy --
a wine made for you to enjoy as much as I do.
