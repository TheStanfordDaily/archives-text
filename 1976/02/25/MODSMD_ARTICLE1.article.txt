# Psychiatrist: Hearst in POW state
## 
### Vilia Kakis Roy Johnson 
SAN FRANCISCO — One of three
psychiatrists who examined Patricia
Hearst before her trial testified yester
day that Hearst is suffering from
"traumatic neurosis" due to the "vio
lent transition" she experienced with
her abduction by the Symbionese Lib
eration Army (SLA).
Comparing her condition to that of
POW s in the past, Dr. Louis West said
that the abruptness of the change was
"more violent than any military cap
ture" and caused Hearst to have a
"child-like dependency on her cap
tors."
West, chief witness for the defense,
pointed out that early in her confine
ment Hearst began to "dissociate"
with her past and comply with the de
mands of her captors. After repeated
military drills, he said, she "assumed
the role of Tania and did what they
told her to do."
Under direct examination by de
fense counsel F. Lee Bailey, West cited
long passages from a report issued Oct.
24, 1975, on Hearst's mental condi
tion.
Back-door victory
At one point, judge Oliver Carter or
dered Bailey to develop his examina
tion into more of a "question and ans
wer" exchange. Some observers
thought this may have been a backdoor
victory for Bailey who seemed able to
elicit responses in Hearst's favor from
West.
Citing his observations about return
ing POW s, West said that in the major
ity of cases there were signs of chronic
stress, withdrawal, apathy and depres
sion. Although prior to her abduction
Hearst had "no symptoms of psychiat
ric disorder," she possessed all of
these characteristics at the time of her
arrest, West explained.
Carter overruled an attempt by the
prosecution to strike West's testimony
from the record and labeled it "neces
sary for the basis of the defense of the
defendant."
Deputy U.S. Attorney David Ban
croft began his cross-examination of
West by noting that the psychiatrist
had corresponded with the Hearst fam
ily before he was appointed by the
court to examine the defendant.
West, however, replied that he in
formed the court of his actions and that
he had written to the family merely as
"one concerned parent to another."
Bancroft also questioned West about
dining with the Hearsts on one occa
sion. Rather than being a social visit,
West explained he went to the Hearst
home with Berkeley psychologist
Margaret Singer to observe and inter
view the family.
Tests taken shortly after Hearst's ar
rest indicated that her IQ had dropped
to 109, from 129 measured in 1969.
She completed parts of the test with
"childlike simplicity which reflected a
marked degree of regression to a
child-like state," said West.

"one concerned parent to another."
Bancroft also questioned West about
dining with the Hearsts on one occa
sion. Rather than being a social visit,
West explained he went to the Hearst
home with Berkeley psychologist
Margaret Singer to observe and inter
view the family.
Tests taken shortly after Hearst's ar
rest indicated that her IQ had dropped
to 109, from 129 measured in 1969.
She completed parts of the test with
"childlike simplicity which reflected a
marked degree of regression to a
child-like state," said West.
SAN FRANCISCO — One of three
psychiatrists who examined Patricia
Hearst before her trial testified yester
day that Hearst is suffering from
"traumatic neurosis" due to the "vio
lent transition" she experienced with
her abduction by the Symbionese Lib
eration Army (SLA).
Comparing her condition to that of
POW s in the past, Dr. Louis West said
that the abruptness of the change was
"more violent than any military cap
ture" and caused Hearst to have a
"child-like dependency on her cap
tors."
West, chief witness for the defense,
pointed out that early in her confine
ment Hearst began to "dissociate"
with her past and comply with the de
mands of her captors. After repeated
military drills, he said, she "assumed
the role of Tania and did what they
told her to do."
Under direct examination by de
fense counsel F. Lee Bailey, West cited
long passages from a report issued Oct.
24, 1975, on Hearst's mental condi
tion.
Back-door victory
At one point, judge Oliver Carter or
dered Bailey to develop his examina
tion into more of a "question and ans
wer" exchange. Some observers
thought this may have been a backdoor
victory for Bailey who seemed able to
elicit responses in Hearst's favor from
West.
Citing his observations about return
ing POW s, West said that in the major
ity of cases there were signs of chronic
stress, withdrawal, apathy and depres
sion. Although prior to her abduction
Hearst had "no symptoms of psychiat
ric disorder," she possessed all of
these characteristics at the time of her
arrest, West explained.
Carter overruled an attempt by the
prosecution to strike West's testimony
from the record and labeled it "neces
sary for the basis of the defense of the
defendant."
Deputy U.S. Attorney David Ban
croft began his cross-examination of
West by noting that the psychiatrist
had corresponded with the Hearst fam
ily before he was appointed by the
court to examine the defendant.
West, however, replied that he in
formed the court of his actions and that
he had written to the family merely as
"one concerned parent to another."
