# Schlesinger's foreign policy stance
## 
### 
Conservatives were distressed at the dis
missal of James Schlesinger from his post as
secretary of defense.Conservative Republi
can Ronald Reagan and conservative Demo
crat Sen. Henry Jackson share Schlesinger's
penchant for global interventionism and
hence have been quick to mimic Schlesing
er's foreign policy analysis.
Schlesinger follows a pattern which is
time-honored among conservative
warhawks. First, statements by foreign
leaders are distorted in order to create the
impression that America's global interven
tionism is merely a response to an implac
able foe bent upon world military conquest.
Once Germany served as the foreign threat
in the warhawks' apologia for intervention;
now it is Russia.
Second, Schlesinger defines as an area of
vital American interest virtually the entire
globe. In his account, America's interests
turn out to be raw materials, investment out
lets and markets.
Schlesinger apparently believes in his
own way the old Leninist canard that the
capitalist system necessarily must be im
perialistic, that obtaining natural resources
and exporting capital and goods abroad are
necessary to the survival of a market
economy and require military threats and
intervention.
Sharp contrast
Schlesinger's interventionism stands in
sharp contrast to an isolationist foreign pol
icy goal of avoiding entangling alliances
and abstaining totally from foreign quarrels
and imperialist adventures.
Schlesinger's discussion of the Soviet no
tion of peaceful coexistence in the February
issue ofFortune shows how he distorts real
ity.
All Soviet leaders have ever said was that
renunciation of war between states was a
necessity in a nuclear age. Yet Schlesinger
treats as a major revelation the fact that the
Russians have not totally abandoned
ideological propaganda, the fact that the
Russians say they hope for changes in the
domestic status quo in various countries
around the world, and the fact that the Rus
sians say they are on the side of anti
colonial political movements and do pro
vide financial aid, but never troops, for a
minority of such anti-colonial groups.
Izvestia editorials and Leonid Brezhnev's
speeches regularly make these points, and it
is no investigative reporting coup for inter
ventionists like Schlesinger to string to
gether quotations from such readily availa
ble sources. But such quotations are by no
means the blueprints for world conquest
some interventionists claim they are.
Of course, all lovers of freedom and self
determination deplore Soviet aggression in

borderland territories such as Czechos
lovakia, just as they deplored American in
tervention in Southeast Asia. Noninterven
tionists believe governments should con
fine their activities to their own territories.
Since the time of Woodrow Wilson,
though, American interventionists have ar
gued that government guarantees of in
vestments abroad, government promotion
of exports, government subsidization of the
costs of obtaining raw materials abroad, and
expansion abroad of American political in
stitutions are all necessary to the survival of
the American "system."

The following quotation from Schlesing
er's annual report setting forth the objec
tives for the fiscal year 1976-77 Defense De
partment shows that Schlesinger shares
much of this interventionist ideology:
"We live in an interdependent world
economy, and our foreign economic in
terests are substantial. U.S. assets abroad
amount to more than $180 billion. Annu
ally, we export more than $70 billion in
goods and services, and our imports are of
an equal or greater amount. The oil embargo
of 1973 is only the most recent and pointed
reminder that we have a keen and growing
interest in distant lands — their markets and
their products.
More extensive
"Our foreign political interests are even
more extensive. Within this century we
have participated in two great wars to en
sure that Europe did not fall under the
domination of a single power. We have a
similar interest in seeing that Japan remains
independent and that the other nations of
Asia are free to choose their own destinies.
"Even in a period of questioning and
self-doubt, there remains a consensus
within the country that we have vital in
terests in Western Europe, the Middle East,
the Persian Gulf, and Asia. Contrary to occa
sional suggestions, surely the right cure for
what may seem an excess of commitments is
not the blind and hasty abandonment of all
commitments. Our objective, as a great
power, is to display a somewhat greater de
gree of steadfastness."
Several comments on economic matters
are in order here, for some believe that what

Schlesinger calls economic interests are
economic necessities. International trade is
advantageous both to America and to
America's trading partners. But in no sense
is the further existence Of a market economy
in the United States dependent on foreign
trade.
If, for example, all the less developed
countries formed a bloc that refused to trade
with the United States, some comparatively
inexpensive source of raw materials would
no longer be available. But, in the words of
Edward Banfield, "at some additional cost,
we could either produce these raw materials
ourselves or find substitutes for them from
within our own borders."
The continued existence of a developed
market economy in the Unitod States is not
dependent upon new frontiers for invest
ments and products. The belief that new
frontiers are necessary stems from under
consumptionist economic fallacies.
Furthermore, those who fear that
economies around the world may become
closed to U.S. trade seem to forget that, in
Banfield's words, "the present restrictions
on East-West trade . . . are mostly of our
making."
Paradoxically, some Reagan conserva
tives who fear the closing out of U.S. trade
also wish to prohibit East-West trade.
Military option
As defense secretary, Schlesinger was
not only a proponent of U.S. intervention
around the world, he was also a proponent
of nuclear warfare as a normal military op
tion. "1 was delighted to see Ford fire
Schlesinger," commented Ambassador Av
erell Harriman at the time. "I think
Schlesinger's idea of a limited nuclear war
is little short of insanity."
Throughout his career as defense secret
ary, Schlesinger promoted a "counterforce"
nuclear strategy for the United States
(building what looks like a preemptive,
first-strike capacity) and opposed the other
Establishment nuclear strategy —deterrence
via "mutually assured destruction."
A final indication of Schlesinger's fun
damentally conservative values can be
found in his article in the February Fortune.
There he specifically attacks straightfor
ward applications to international affairs of
Lord Acton's famous libertarian dictum that
power tends to corrupt.
It is almost as if Schlesinger had deliber
ately decided to provide us with a perfect
illustration of Kenneth Minogue's observa
tion that "from a government's point of
view, particularly in international
affairs . . . freedom is nice, but national
strength and discipline are even nicer."
