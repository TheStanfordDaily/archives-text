Why is Cubberley Auditorium always so warm? "Mass Communi
cations" is bad enough without the heat helping put me to sleep. I
know there is a ventilation system, because it was actually working
once (Feb. 18). Is there any way Plant Services can make the room
less stuffy?-H.B.
Why must the audio system in Cubberley Auditorium remain so
inadequate? Surely enough movies are shown there to justify and
pay for a new system -and even repair the tear in the screen.—D.E.
A cooler, more modern Cubberley may be just a phone call away.
In the first case, you should call the Plant Services work order desk
at 497-2281. In the second, needle the dean at the School of Educa
tion. If he decides that your claims are justified, he too will contact
the work order desk.

One of the hazards of my occupation is that 1 often find myself
walking city streets alone at night. A friend of mine who lives in
New York City carries an aerosol can of a mace-like substance for
self-protection. I was told by police, however, that it is illegal to use
such substances in California. Is this true? If not, how effective are
the various spray-on attack-deterring products? I don't want to
wait until I'm being mugged to find out that I've bought a can of
hairspray.-T.A.
You'll be surprised to find out that Police Officer Debbie Mari
naro recommends that you try just that. Although the use of mace is
illegal in California (except by policemen and security officers,
who have taken a course on its use), Marinaro emphasized that any
product irritating to the eyes, including hairspray, is effective in
repelling attackers. In fact, she recommends sprays above weapons
like nail files since these are too easily used against the victim.
Another possibility is a dog repellent-type spray. The Post Office
uses a product called "Halt!" which sells for $2.99 at most pet
supply stores.
