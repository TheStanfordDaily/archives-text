SACRAMENTO (AP) — The
state Department of Transporta
tion says it has enough money to
finish the final link of the
1373-mile-long Interstate 5.
Department spokesman Jeff
Rupp said the state Highway
Commission will decide
whether to spend the money on
the 23.5-mile gap between Sac
ramento and Stockton.
He said the $3.5 million, the
state's share in the $40 million
project, is part of $60 million in
unexpected funds the depart
ment has come up with because

of several developments:
—additional fees from a new
system of year-round auto regist
ration;
—savings from a drop in snow
removal requirements this
winter; and
—layoffs within the depart
ment and lower-than-expected
bids for highway projects.
The commission may decide
Friday whether to commit the
$36.5 million in available fed
eral money to the project, Rupp
said.
