## Two-time All-American joins pro tour Saviano leaves net team, turns pro 
### Paul Bauman 
Two-time Ail-American Nick
Saviano has informed coach
DickGould that he is quitting the
Stanford tennis team in favor of
the professional ranks.
The loss seriously reduces
whatever chances Stanford had
of dethroning defending NCAA
net champion UCLA.
Saviano, a junior and the
eighth-ranked amateur in the

country, is the second Stanford
player in six months to forego
his remaining years of college
eligibility to turn pro. John Whit
linger, the 1974 NCAA champ
ion, skipped his senior year on
the Farm and took the plunge
last summer.
Gould, who has also seen
former Stanford stars Roscoe
Tanner, Chico Hagey and Alex
"Sandy" Mayer turn pro early,

said, about Saviano's departure.
"This one really surprised me —
at this point in the year."
Lost in first round
"1 think he's a little frus
trated," Gould said. "He wanted
to do well in the U.S. National
Indoors in Salisbury, Md. last
week and he lost in the first
round (to Trey VValtke, if any
body cares)."
Gould said he did not try to

persuade Saviano to return to
Stanford. "He felt the time was
right for his tennis game. That
was it. About the only thing a
coach can do is ask, 'Have you
thought it through?' "
Gould was rather non
committal about assessing
Saviano's move, but did say, "If a
guy really wants to be a world
class tennis player, the best
thing is to go out and play with
the pros everyday and not go to
school."
Card veterans
Saviano's decision focuses at
tention on the ambitions of Stan
ford veterans Gene Mayer, a
junior and the third-ranked
amateur in the country, and Fat
DuPre, a senior. Both are pre
sently playing on independent
tours before Stanford's league
season opens in April.
"As far as I know," Gould said,
"Gene and Fat will be back with
us in April. Neither has given me
any indication of possibly turn
ing pro this year."
Not only has Stanford lost one
of its top players, but yesterday
the Cards also lost to a team other
than USC or UCLA for the first
time in six years. Canada edged
Stanford, 5-4, on the Varsity
Courts, to even the Cards' 1976

dual match record at 1-1.
Gould took a "calculated
gamble" by resting some of his
top playes and lost. Bill Maze,
No.l on the Card ladder, didn i
play at all and Matt Mitchell
played only doubles.
The Cards' loss to Canada
casts doubt on whether they can
successfully defend their
championship in the Nor-Cal In
tercollegiates, running today
through Saturday in Berkeley.
Stanford has won that tourna
ment six straight years.

TENNIS PRO — Stanford tennis star Nick Saviano has
informed Card tennis coach Dick Gould that he intends to turn
professional. The junior lefthander has been an All-American for
the past two years.
Two-time Ail-American Nick
Saviano has informed coach
DickGould that he is quitting the
Stanford tennis team in favor of
the professional ranks.
The loss seriously reduces
whatever chances Stanford had
of dethroning defending NCAA
net champion UCLA.
Saviano, a junior and the
eighth-ranked amateur in the

country, is the second Stanford
player in six months to forego
his remaining years of college
eligibility to turn pro. John Whit
linger, the 1974 NCAA champ
ion, skipped his senior year on
the Farm and took the plunge
last summer.
Gould, who has also seen
former Stanford stars Roscoe
Tanner, Chico Hagey and Alex
"Sandy" Mayer turn pro early,

said, about Saviano's departure.
"This one really surprised me —
at this point in the year."
Lost in first round
"1 think he's a little frus
trated," Gould said. "He wanted
to do well in the U.S. National
Indoors in Salisbury, Md. last
week and he lost in the first
round (to Trey VValtke, if any
body cares)."
Gould said he did not try to

persuade Saviano to return to
Stanford. "He felt the time was
right for his tennis game. That
was it. About the only thing a
coach can do is ask, 'Have you
thought it through?' "
Gould was rather non
committal about assessing
Saviano's move, but did say, "If a
guy really wants to be a world
class tennis player, the best
thing is to go out and play with
the pros everyday and not go to
school."
Card veterans
Saviano's decision focuses at
tention on the ambitions of Stan
ford veterans Gene Mayer, a
junior and the third-ranked
amateur in the country, and Fat
DuPre, a senior. Both are pre
sently playing on independent
tours before Stanford's league
season opens in April.
"As far as I know," Gould said,
"Gene and Fat will be back with
us in April. Neither has given me
any indication of possibly turn
ing pro this year."
Not only has Stanford lost one
of its top players, but yesterday
the Cards also lost to a team other
than USC or UCLA for the first
time in six years. Canada edged
Stanford, 5-4, on the Varsity
Courts, to even the Cards' 1976

dual match record at 1-1.
Gould took a "calculated
gamble" by resting some of his
top playes and lost. Bill Maze,
No.l on the Card ladder, didn i
play at all and Matt Mitchell
played only doubles.
The Cards' loss to Canada
casts doubt on whether they can
successfully defend their
championship in the Nor-Cal In
tercollegiates, running today
through Saturday in Berkeley.
Stanford has won that tourna
ment six straight years.
