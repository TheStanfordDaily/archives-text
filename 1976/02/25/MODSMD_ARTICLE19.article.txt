# Pac-8 predictions
## 
### 
Our prognosticator had picked seven of
seven Pacific Eight games correctly last week
before UCLA and Oregon squared off in
Pauley Pavilion. So he unwittingly placed his
faith in a team that hadn't lost at home in five
years, and as everyone who knows Rich
Washington from George Washington can tell
you, the Bruins lost. Our predictor had to settle
for a seven-for-eight week. His season total is
36 of 54 games, a .667 percentage.
This week USC and UCLA visit Maples
Pavilion, and you can forget about all that
"Maples Miracle" stuff. Just hope the Cards
can avoid a "Maples Debacle" this time.
We hate to say it, but USC will hand Stan
ford its seventh consecutive loss Friday night.
The Cards are still physically disabled and

they looked lousy last week in Washington.
Stanford is simply in no position to beat
UCLA Saturday. The Cards came within one
point of beating the Bruins in Los Angeles
earlier this year, but the situation is different
this time. UCLA will show its real ability after
losing to Oregon, and Stanford will continue to
suffer primarily from the injured George
Schader's reduced effectiveness.
