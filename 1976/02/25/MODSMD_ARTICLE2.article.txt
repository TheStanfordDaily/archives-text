Ron Robinette, a carpenter for the F.P. Lathrop Construction Company,
broke both wrists in an 18-foot fall yesterday afternoon at the Frederick E.
Terman Engineering Center construction site next to the Roble Gym,
according to a construction company source.
Robinette, 27, was also cut and bruised in the fall, said the source, but
there was "no mention of a concussion from the doctors." The patient was
in shock and will be kept under observation at the Medical Center for the
next two to three days, said the source.
According to the source, Robinette was spreading four by four timbers
over the top of a scaffolding when one of the timbers he had just placed
down apparently "snapped under his weight" due to a "nonapparent
defect."
Robinette has been a carpenter for about eight years and is a "very
experienced man," the source said.
