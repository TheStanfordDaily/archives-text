# Women cagers set for tourney

Stanford women's basketball
has come a long way.butthe path
ahead is equally long. For the
women it has been a year of
firsts, first game in Maples Pavil
ion, first year of better than
adequate training facilities, first
time with set offensive plays and
first time with a good schedule.
The only thing which wasn't
new was mediocre women's
basketball games.
But then again, don't sneeze at
their 10-4 record. The women
cagers are the Stanford varsity
basketball team that has a five
game winning streak, not a six
game losing one.
That record has propelled the
Card women into the Northern
California Championships,
where their number-five seeding
has placed them against fourth
ranked UC-Davis tomorrow.
Their season ends if they lose.
Peak for playoffs
But "our plan before the sea
son began was to peak for the
playoffs," said coach Gay
Coburn. "Right now, we're start
ing to play our best basketball of
the year."
Whether Stanford's five-game
winning streak is due to its "best
basketball of the year," is debata
ble. The problem is that the
women haven't faced Chico
State in five games. When the
two teams met on Feb. 6, the ver
dict was 64-35 Chico State. Since
then Stanford has generally
played schools, such as Hum
boldt State and Santa Clara, who
have more trouble fielding a full
squad than losing by 30 to the
Cardinals.

But Stanford, sporting both
the youngest and the tallest team
in Northern California, has
much to be proud of this year.
Immediately preceding the
men's game against California,
Stanford took on the Bear
women in front of over 1000
slowly departing fans. After 10
minutes the Cards held a 27-0
lead.
Hot and cold
"Its been like that all season,"
said Sukie Jackson, the team's
high scorer. "Sometimes we've
just been really hot and other
times we couldn't buy a basket.
"Last Monday's game was
probably our best," Jackson
stated. After losing to San Jose
State, 68-49, earlier in the sea
son, the Cards ripped the Spar
tans, 83-66, with a 50-point sec
ond half. Center Maggie Nelson
and guard Nancy Lowold both
set personal high scoring marks
with 26 and 21 points respec
tively.
On the basis of that game alone
the Cards are ready for UC-Davis.
But Stanford will have to go with
just the partial services of for
ward Onnie Killefer, who
sprained her ankle in a game last
week.
Coburn, who has shuffled her
lineup as regularly as men's var
sity cage coach Dick Dißiaso
(one game averaged a substitute
less than every two minutes),
will probably go with Nelson at
center, captain Sonia Jarvis and
Jackson at the forward spot, and
Lowold and Peggy Bruggman or
fast improving Stephanie Galef
at the guard position.
