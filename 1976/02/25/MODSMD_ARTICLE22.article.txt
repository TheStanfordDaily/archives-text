# Golfers rout S.F. State

### 
San Francisco State proved to be no match for the Stanford
men's varsity golf squad last Monday, as the Robber Barons
tallied their first perfect, 27-0, match of the early season.
The victory, which raised Stanford's season record to 2-1, was
paced by Mike Peck's one-over-par 72. Robber Barons Glen
Goethals, 74, Jay Johnston and Doug Rice, 77, Bruce McDonald,
78, and Wade Nonnenberg, 80, rounded out the Stanford con
tingent. The rout was dramatized as the San Francisco State
scores ranged from 76 to 108.
