Injuries, illness and inexperi
ence transformed a team which
was promising on preseason
paper into a squad of convales
cents and fledgling matmen.
The Stanford wrestling team
ended its season last weekend
witn a 6-14 dual meet record.
"Before the season started we
had hoped our record would be
the opposite of that or better,"
wrestling coach Joe DeMeo said
of the Robber Barons' disap
pointing season.
Preseason wrestling polls
picked Stanford to battle with
UCLA for third place in the
highly competitive Pacific
Eight. Instead, after a plague of
misfortune sidelined much of
the team, the Robber Barons
finished last in the seven-team
conference (USC has no wrestl
ing team).
This season it would have
been easy to run up the white
flag and surrender. Rather than
give up, however, the team used
the season as a springboard for
next year by gaining badly
needed experience.
'Showed courage'
"They showed courage and
heart throughout the season,"
DeMeo said. "The coach can't
give courage. You've got to have
it before you get to college,
maybe before you get to high
school. And they all had cour
age."
DeMeo's claims were in part
substantiated when Stanford
thrashed San Jose State in its last
dual match of the season. The
29-17 victory avenged an earlier
loss to the Spartans, and came to
the end of a despairing season.
With one exception, graduat
ing senior Eric Grunseth, the

team that beat San Jose could all
be back next year. Co-captain
John Govea, a senior, is leaning
toward graduation despite a
remaining year of eligibility.
DeMeo would like to see Govea
remain at Stanford and wrestle
one more year.
Familiar fat es
Nonetheless, most of the faces
next year will be familiar. The
top Stanford finishers in last
weekend's Pac-8 meet, Craig
Reynolds, Michael King and
Gary Anderson, will all return
next year.
Reynolds 17-7 dual meet re
cord was second only toGovea's
24-5 mark. Reynolds vacillated
between 158 and 167 pounds
this season, wrestling where he
could help the team most, and
yet still wrestled with remarka
ble consistency.
King, a freshman, had a 12-13
record. "That's a good record for
the competition we wrestled this
year," DeMeo said. Anderson, an
offensive lineman on thefootball
team, was 8-6-2 on the year. Two
of his losses came at the hands of

the defending NCAA
heavyweight champ, and
another was to the runner-up in
last year's NCAA finals.
Others who will be returning
next year showed excellent po
tential, according to coach De-
Meo. Next year's returnees will
include Mark Taguchi, Eric
Sommer, Lester Yoshida, Bob
Picazo, JoeCoelhoand Bill Egan.
Much of Stanford's strength
next winter will come from those
who sat out this season with one
of the varied maladies which hit
the team. Bob Keating, Jim
Spangler, RoyTolles, MikeGeb
ers and Gary Lynn should all be
at full strength come November.
Lynn, who was elected one of
this year's captains last spring,
broke his ankle in the Big Game
and did not wrestle all year.
Lynn, Anderson and perhaps
Govea will be at the U.S. Olym
pic wrestling team trials this
May in Cleveland.
DeMeo also figures that three
or four of the high school seniors
he is presently recruiting will
find their way here next fall.
