Terrorists plan activities?
SAN FRANCISCO — The New World Libera
tion Front (NWLF) may be planning new ter
rorist activities to show that recent FBI arrests
"haven't made a ripple" in the terrorist under
ground, a radical source was quoted as saying
yesterday.
The unidentified source, quoted in yester
day's editions of the San Francisco Examiner,
said despite the FBI arrests of nine persons last
week and the discovery of a makeshift bomb
factory in a Richmond home, "the NWLF is still
functioning."
FBI agents arrested three men and three
women last Saturday in a raid on a Richmond
home where they confiscated original com
muniques from the terrorist Emiliano Zapata
Unit, literature "in the name of the New World
Liberation Front" and 150 pounds of explosives,
including several bombs and 30 others partially
completed.

Brezhnev supports peace
MOSCOW — Soviet Communist leader
Leonid Brezhnev promised "redoubled energy"
yesterday in the pursuit of peaceful coexistence
with the West but said the Kremlin intends to
continue support for "liberation" struggles ab
road, such as in Angola.
The 69-year-old Brezhnev made his pledge on
the opening day of the 25th Soviet Communist
party congress in a speech intended to chart this
country's course for the next five years.
Brezhnev forcefully repeated Moscow's inten
tion to continue its aid to the leftist Popular
Movement (MPLA) government in Angola as a
matter of "revolutionary conscience" and said it
would also support other ideological allies in
volved in struggles.
The general secretary, who turns 70 this year,
spoke in a strong voice and with firm gestures
for five hours and five minutes, in seeming de
fiance of rumors in the West about his health. He
took two recesses during the speech. Nearly
5000 delegates and 103 foreign delegations gave
him a standing ovation for three minutes, 15
seconds at the conclusion.
Nixon meets throng in Peking
PEKING — Former President Richard Nixon
gave a smiling Chinese throng a taste of
American-style campaigning yesterday as he
shook hands, tweaked babies and invited all to
visit him in the United States.
The crowd gathered at the Gate of Heavenly
Peace appeared unrehearsed as it pushed close
to the visitor, offering hands in welcome.
"I bring you wishes from America. I hope
some day you'll come see us," a vigorous
looking Nixon told his welcomers. Many of the
Chinese wished him good health.
The encounter on the broad Tien An Men
Square outside the Forbidden City was unusual.
Foreigners visiting Peking seldom get to meet
ordinary citizens in spontaneous groups.
This morning Nixon is scheduled for another
excursion among the public — to visit Tsinghua
University and have a look at wall posters re
flecting the current ideological struggle bet
ween radicals and conservatives in the Chinese
Communist party.
Nixon met with Acting Premier Hua Kuo-feng
yesterday afternoon for their third round of talks
since he arrived in Peking last Saturday. There
was no immediate report from either Nixon

aides or the Chinese Hsinhua news agency on
what topics they discussed.
Schorr report money refused
WASHINGTON — A reporters' organization
announced yesterday it has decided to refuse
any money from the publication of the House
intelligence committee report that was released
by Daniel Schorr.
CBS Correspondent Schorr had specified that
any payment for publication of the report by the
Village Voice in New York should go to the
group, The Reporters Committee for Freedom of
the Press.
Village Voice publisher Clay Felker has never
said if he is paying anyone for the report, how
ever, and he did not return telephone calls on
that question yesterday.
The Village Voice published parts of the re
port although the House had voted to keep it
secret on grounds that it contains classified in
formation.
Jack Landau, the Reporters Committee's chief
trustee, said the group decided to accept no
money "to avoid any suggestion the committee
was involved in commercialization or
checkbook journalism."
Court asked,to limit appeals
WASHINGTON — State law enforcement au
thorities asked the Supreme Court yesterday to
limit the right of prisoners to challenge their
convictions on grounds the evidence against
them was illegally obtained.
The court heard arguments on appeals by
Nebraska and California officials from decisions
of federal appelate courts overturning the mur
der convictions of two men.
Attorneys for the two states said federal judges
should be stripped of their power to overturn
state convictions on grounds that evidence was
obtained unconstitutionally.
The high court ruled in 1969 that federal
courts have this power under a 109-year-old fed
eral law authorizing them to free any state pris
oner being unconstitutionally held.
The justices are expected to rule on the two
cases by the end of their current term, probably
in June.
Pentagon sets defense plans
WASHINGTON — A group of Pentagon offi

cials is busily planning for something most
Americans would rather not think about: a nuc
lear attack some day on the United States.
The Defense Civil Preparedness Agency,
fighting to justify its existence, says planning for
such a mass exodus from the cities is necessary.
Agency officials say someone should "think the
unthinkable."
In this era of detente, some others think such
planning is a waste of money.
Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), a consistent critic of
the Pentagon, says it is unsuitable for a nation
that has renounced the option to attack first to
plan for a nuclear war. Aspin calls such plan
ning "provocative."
State and local Civil Defense officials don't
like the agency's plan to curtail assistance for
grass-roots planning for natural disasters such
as floods, hurricanes and tornadoes.
These cutbacks in money for state Civil De
fense plans "will be the demise of a lot of Civil
Defense plans that help people in real emergen
cies," said Ronald San Felippo, administrator of
Wisconsin's program.
Peron impeachment sought
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — President
Isabel Peron's foes in Congress were trying to
rally a two-thirds majority today to impeach her
or declare her unfit to govern.
The lower house of Congress was to meet for
the special session that the government can
celed last week in an attempt to avert a show
down.
Although the session vas called to consider
bills still pending, the deputies could decide to
discuss action against the embattled president.
Top officials of the Peronist movement met
yesterday after Peron rejected their demand that
she purge her cabinet and circle of advisers of
men linked to Jose Lopez Rega, her chief adviser
and confidant who was forced to exile last sum

Terrorists plan activities?
SAN FRANCISCO — The New World Libera
tion Front (NWLF) may be planning new ter
rorist activities to show that recent FBI arrests
"haven't made a ripple" in the terrorist under
ground, a radical source was quoted as saying
yesterday.
The unidentified source, quoted in yester
day's editions of the San Francisco Examiner,
said despite the FBI arrests of nine persons last
week and the discovery of a makeshift bomb
factory in a Richmond home, "the NWLF is still
functioning."
FBI agents arrested three men and three
women last Saturday in a raid on a Richmond
home where they confiscated original com
muniques from the terrorist Emiliano Zapata
Unit, literature "in the name of the New World
Liberation Front" and 150 pounds of explosives,
including several bombs and 30 others partially
completed.

Brezhnev supports peace
MOSCOW — Soviet Communist leader
Leonid Brezhnev promised "redoubled energy"
yesterday in the pursuit of peaceful coexistence
with the West but said the Kremlin intends to
continue support for "liberation" struggles ab
road, such as in Angola.
The 69-year-old Brezhnev made his pledge on
the opening day of the 25th Soviet Communist
party congress in a speech intended to chart this
country's course for the next five years.
Brezhnev forcefully repeated Moscow's inten
tion to continue its aid to the leftist Popular
Movement (MPLA) government in Angola as a
matter of "revolutionary conscience" and said it
would also support other ideological allies in
volved in struggles.
The general secretary, who turns 70 this year,
spoke in a strong voice and with firm gestures
for five hours and five minutes, in seeming de
fiance of rumors in the West about his health. He
took two recesses during the speech. Nearly
5000 delegates and 103 foreign delegations gave
him a standing ovation for three minutes, 15
seconds at the conclusion.
Nixon meets throng in Peking
PEKING — Former President Richard Nixon
gave a smiling Chinese throng a taste of
American-style campaigning yesterday as he
shook hands, tweaked babies and invited all to
visit him in the United States.
The crowd gathered at the Gate of Heavenly
Peace appeared unrehearsed as it pushed close
to the visitor, offering hands in welcome.
"I bring you wishes from America. I hope
some day you'll come see us," a vigorous
looking Nixon told his welcomers. Many of the
Chinese wished him good health.
The encounter on the broad Tien An Men
Square outside the Forbidden City was unusual.
Foreigners visiting Peking seldom get to meet
ordinary citizens in spontaneous groups.
This morning Nixon is scheduled for another
excursion among the public — to visit Tsinghua
University and have a look at wall posters re
flecting the current ideological struggle bet
ween radicals and conservatives in the Chinese
Communist party.
Nixon met with Acting Premier Hua Kuo-feng
yesterday afternoon for their third round of talks
since he arrived in Peking last Saturday. There
was no immediate report from either Nixon

aides or the Chinese Hsinhua news agency on
what topics they discussed.
Schorr report money refused
WASHINGTON — A reporters' organization
announced yesterday it has decided to refuse
any money from the publication of the House
intelligence committee report that was released
by Daniel Schorr.
CBS Correspondent Schorr had specified that
any payment for publication of the report by the
Village Voice in New York should go to the
group, The Reporters Committee for Freedom of
the Press.
Village Voice publisher Clay Felker has never
said if he is paying anyone for the report, how
ever, and he did not return telephone calls on
that question yesterday.
The Village Voice published parts of the re
port although the House had voted to keep it
secret on grounds that it contains classified in
formation.
Jack Landau, the Reporters Committee's chief
trustee, said the group decided to accept no
money "to avoid any suggestion the committee
was involved in commercialization or
checkbook journalism."
Court asked,to limit appeals
WASHINGTON — State law enforcement au
thorities asked the Supreme Court yesterday to
limit the right of prisoners to challenge their
convictions on grounds the evidence against
them was illegally obtained.
The court heard arguments on appeals by
Nebraska and California officials from decisions
of federal appelate courts overturning the mur
der convictions of two men.
Attorneys for the two states said federal judges
should be stripped of their power to overturn
state convictions on grounds that evidence was
obtained unconstitutionally.
The high court ruled in 1969 that federal
courts have this power under a 109-year-old fed
eral law authorizing them to free any state pris
oner being unconstitutionally held.
The justices are expected to rule on the two
cases by the end of their current term, probably
in June.

Court asked,to limit appeals
WASHINGTON — State law enforcement au
thorities asked the Supreme Court yesterday to
limit the right of prisoners to challenge their
convictions on grounds the evidence against
them was illegally obtained.
The court heard arguments on appeals by
Nebraska and California officials from decisions
of federal appelate courts overturning the mur
der convictions of two men.
Attorneys for the two states said federal judges
should be stripped of their power to overturn
state convictions on grounds that evidence was
obtained unconstitutionally.
The high court ruled in 1969 that federal
courts have this power under a 109-year-old fed
eral law authorizing them to free any state pris
oner being unconstitutionally held.
The justices are expected to rule on the two
cases by the end of their current term, probably
in June.
Pentagon sets defense plans
WASHINGTON — A group of Pentagon offi

cials is busily planning for something most
Americans would rather not think about: a nuc
lear attack some day on the United States.
The Defense Civil Preparedness Agency,
fighting to justify its existence, says planning for
such a mass exodus from the cities is necessary.
Agency officials say someone should "think the
unthinkable."
In this era of detente, some others think such
planning is a waste of money.
Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), a consistent critic of
the Pentagon, says it is unsuitable for a nation
that has renounced the option to attack first to
plan for a nuclear war. Aspin calls such plan
ning "provocative."
State and local Civil Defense officials don't
like the agency's plan to curtail assistance for
grass-roots planning for natural disasters such
as floods, hurricanes and tornadoes.
These cutbacks in money for state Civil De
fense plans "will be the demise of a lot of Civil
Defense plans that help people in real emergen
cies," said Ronald San Felippo, administrator of
Wisconsin's program.
Peron impeachment sought

Terrorists plan activities?
SAN FRANCISCO — The New World Libera
tion Front (NWLF) may be planning new ter
rorist activities to show that recent FBI arrests
"haven't made a ripple" in the terrorist under
ground, a radical source was quoted as saying
yesterday.
The unidentified source, quoted in yester
day's editions of the San Francisco Examiner,
said despite the FBI arrests of nine persons last
week and the discovery of a makeshift bomb
factory in a Richmond home, "the NWLF is still
functioning."
FBI agents arrested three men and three
women last Saturday in a raid on a Richmond
home where they confiscated original com
muniques from the terrorist Emiliano Zapata
Unit, literature "in the name of the New World
Liberation Front" and 150 pounds of explosives,
including several bombs and 30 others partially
completed.

Brezhnev supports peace
MOSCOW — Soviet Communist leader
Leonid Brezhnev promised "redoubled energy"
yesterday in the pursuit of peaceful coexistence
with the West but said the Kremlin intends to
continue support for "liberation" struggles ab
road, such as in Angola.
The 69-year-old Brezhnev made his pledge on
the opening day of the 25th Soviet Communist
party congress in a speech intended to chart this
country's course for the next five years.
Brezhnev forcefully repeated Moscow's inten
tion to continue its aid to the leftist Popular
Movement (MPLA) government in Angola as a
matter of "revolutionary conscience" and said it
would also support other ideological allies in
volved in struggles.
The general secretary, who turns 70 this year,
spoke in a strong voice and with firm gestures
for five hours and five minutes, in seeming de
fiance of rumors in the West about his health. He
took two recesses during the speech. Nearly
5000 delegates and 103 foreign delegations gave
him a standing ovation for three minutes, 15
seconds at the conclusion.
Nixon meets throng in Peking
PEKING — Former President Richard Nixon
gave a smiling Chinese throng a taste of
American-style campaigning yesterday as he
shook hands, tweaked babies and invited all to
visit him in the United States.
The crowd gathered at the Gate of Heavenly
Peace appeared unrehearsed as it pushed close
to the visitor, offering hands in welcome.
"I bring you wishes from America. I hope
some day you'll come see us," a vigorous
looking Nixon told his welcomers. Many of the
Chinese wished him good health.
The encounter on the broad Tien An Men
Square outside the Forbidden City was unusual.
Foreigners visiting Peking seldom get to meet
ordinary citizens in spontaneous groups.
This morning Nixon is scheduled for another
excursion among the public — to visit Tsinghua
University and have a look at wall posters re
flecting the current ideological struggle bet
ween radicals and conservatives in the Chinese
Communist party.
Nixon met with Acting Premier Hua Kuo-feng
yesterday afternoon for their third round of talks
since he arrived in Peking last Saturday. There
was no immediate report from either Nixon

aides or the Chinese Hsinhua news agency on
what topics they discussed.
