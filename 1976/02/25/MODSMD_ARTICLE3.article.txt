## ASSU projects lose money fall quarter 
### Lori Matsukawa 
ASSU Special Events and Travel
Service projects suffered financial set
backs during fall quarter according to
fall quarter project performance state
ments issued by Financial Manager
Chris Cline at an ASSU Senate meeting
two weeks ago.
The Travel Service, which lost about
$1824.17 due to the United Airlines
strike last quarter, is expected to re
cuperate the loss this quarter.
"All of our (charter) flights during
winter quarter have already sold out,"
Cline stated in his report.
ASSU Special Events showed losses
of $1839.44. However, the report is
"not quite accurate,"according to Spe
cial Events Director Randy Phillips.
"The whole statement is really ir
relevant in terms of the (Special
Events) project as a whole," said Phil
lips.
Not included
Phillips pointed out that the Eric
Clapton concert, which brought in a
$6000 profit, was not included in
Cline's statement. The concert was in
stead reported in (former Special
Events Director)Danny Scher's finan
cial statement for tax reasons.
"Much of the money we spent over
the first part of the year has to be amor
tized over the remainder of the year,"
said Phillips. "For example, we have a
contract with the Daily for $5000. This
cost is for a whole year. $4000 is not
used yet."
Phillips also cited costs for ads in the
"trades" (music industry journals and
papers).
'Pushed advertising'
"We really pushed advertising dur
ing the first quarter so people knew
there was an alternative to Bill
Graham," said Phillips.
Graham is a Bay Area entertainment
promoter.
"We've been letting people in the
music industry know that we are via
ble promoters in the South Bay Area.
This (advertising) cost is something I
assessed as necessary, something we
had to do to keep up the impetus
which Danny established," said Phil
lips.
Phillips did acknowledge losses in
the Robert Klein and Firesign Theatre
performances of $3217.71 and
$1007.15 respectively.
'Out of hand'
Phillips also said a $438.12 loss suf
fered by the Leo Kottke concert was
due to "advertising that got out of
hand."
"We had expected to do two shows
and advertised for two. We realized

later that we would only do one show.
(Leo Kottke's) draw was strong, but not
strong enough," explained Phillips.
"We spent more money for advertis
ing because we anticipated selling
more seats than we did."
Phillips had made advertising ar
rangements with Ken Baker Publicity
Services of San Francisco. Phillips
writes the advertising and he and
Baker "discuss where it should be
placed," said Phillips.
"He knows people, he has contacts.
We save 15 percent of the (advertising)
price by working through him. He has
a mailing list that's helpful," added
Phillips.
Phillips said Baker also made
advertising in the trades more accessi
ble.
'Generating revenue'
Phillips said, however, that the
Stephen Stills concert grossed about
$10,000, the Tubes, $5000 and the

Globetrotters benefit for club sports,
$7000. "So we are generating re
venue," said Phillips.
"We're real promoters," Phillips
added. "We handle all phases of con
cert negotiations. We have produced
concerts in other colleges, also. The
War concert in Santa Clara and the
Kinks in San Jose, for example."
Last year, Scher was "the first suc
cessful" manager to produce for in
terests outside Stanford, according to
Phillips.
"He practically worked for Bill
Graham.'The others (previous mana
gers) didn't know what they were even
doing here," said Phillips.
Help out
"I produced the Santa Clara (War)
show at the request of the dean of stu
dents there," said Phillips.
Cline's statement noted that Special
Events "demonstrated its volatility in
terms of net revenue production" de

spite successful events such as Stills,
Elvin Bishop and Globetrotters.
Meanwhile, a surprising profit mar
gin was shown by the ASSU Sunday
Flicks. The net contribution to the re
serve was $3785.86, an amount which
"will, I'm sure, be subject to criticism"
according to Cline.
At last Monday's ASSU Senate
meeting, Cline reported that the 75-
cent admission would not be reduced
due to anticipated production cost in
creases this spring quarter. However,
he said, the price for season passes will
be reduced to $5 for 10 shows.
The Lecture Notes service showed a
profit of $2694.60 while the Re
frigerator rentals earned $1315.37 this
fall quarter.
It is the policy of the ASSU to keep
all projects on a break-even status, a
policy which Cline said he has "in the
past affirmed, and (will) continue to
recognize."

"trades" (music industry journals and
papers).
'Pushed advertising'
"We really pushed advertising dur
ing the first quarter so people knew
there was an alternative to Bill
Graham," said Phillips.
Graham is a Bay Area entertainment
promoter.
"We've been letting people in the
music industry know that we are via
ble promoters in the South Bay Area.
This (advertising) cost is something I
assessed as necessary, something we
had to do to keep up the impetus
which Danny established," said Phil
lips.
Phillips did acknowledge losses in
the Robert Klein and Firesign Theatre
performances of $3217.71 and
$1007.15 respectively.
'Out of hand'
Phillips also said a $438.12 loss suf
fered by the Leo Kottke concert was
due to "advertising that got out of
hand."
"We had expected to do two shows
and advertised for two. We realized

later that we would only do one show.
(Leo Kottke's) draw was strong, but not
strong enough," explained Phillips.
"We spent more money for advertis
ing because we anticipated selling
more seats than we did."
Phillips had made advertising ar
rangements with Ken Baker Publicity
Services of San Francisco. Phillips
writes the advertising and he and
Baker "discuss where it should be
placed," said Phillips.
"He knows people, he has contacts.
We save 15 percent of the (advertising)
price by working through him. He has
a mailing list that's helpful," added
Phillips.
Phillips said Baker also made
advertising in the trades more accessi
ble.
'Generating revenue'
Phillips said, however, that the
Stephen Stills concert grossed about
$10,000, the Tubes, $5000 and the

Globetrotters benefit for club sports,
$7000. "So we are generating re
venue," said Phillips.
"We're real promoters," Phillips
added. "We handle all phases of con
cert negotiations. We have produced
concerts in other colleges, also. The
War concert in Santa Clara and the
Kinks in San Jose, for example."
Last year, Scher was "the first suc
cessful" manager to produce for in
terests outside Stanford, according to
Phillips.
"He practically worked for Bill
Graham.'The others (previous mana
gers) didn't know what they were even
doing here," said Phillips.
Help out
"I produced the Santa Clara (War)
show at the request of the dean of stu
dents there," said Phillips.
Cline's statement noted that Special
Events "demonstrated its volatility in
terms of net revenue production" de

spite successful events such as Stills,
Elvin Bishop and Globetrotters.
Meanwhile, a surprising profit mar
gin was shown by the ASSU Sunday
Flicks. The net contribution to the re
serve was $3785.86, an amount which
"will, I'm sure, be subject to criticism"
according to Cline.
At last Monday's ASSU Senate
meeting, Cline reported that the 75-
cent admission would not be reduced
due to anticipated production cost in
creases this spring quarter. However,
he said, the price for season passes will
be reduced to $5 for 10 shows.
The Lecture Notes service showed a
profit of $2694.60 while the Re
frigerator rentals earned $1315.37 this
fall quarter.
It is the policy of the ASSU to keep
all projects on a break-even status, a
policy which Cline said he has "in the
past affirmed, and (will) continue to
recognize."
ASSU Special Events and Travel
Service projects suffered financial set
backs during fall quarter according to
fall quarter project performance state
ments issued by Financial Manager
Chris Cline at an ASSU Senate meeting
two weeks ago.
The Travel Service, which lost about
$1824.17 due to the United Airlines
strike last quarter, is expected to re
cuperate the loss this quarter.
"All of our (charter) flights during
winter quarter have already sold out,"
Cline stated in his report.
ASSU Special Events showed losses
of $1839.44. However, the report is
"not quite accurate,"according to Spe
cial Events Director Randy Phillips.
"The whole statement is really ir
relevant in terms of the (Special
Events) project as a whole," said Phil
lips.
Not included
Phillips pointed out that the Eric
Clapton concert, which brought in a
$6000 profit, was not included in
Cline's statement. The concert was in
stead reported in (former Special
Events Director)Danny Scher's finan
cial statement for tax reasons.
"Much of the money we spent over
the first part of the year has to be amor
tized over the remainder of the year,"
said Phillips. "For example, we have a
contract with the Daily for $5000. This
cost is for a whole year. $4000 is not
used yet."
Phillips also cited costs for ads in the

price by working through him. He has
a mailing list that's helpful," added
Phillips.
Phillips said Baker also made
advertising in the trades more accessi
ble.
'Generating revenue'
Phillips said, however, that the
Stephen Stills concert grossed about
$10,000, the Tubes, $5000 and the

Globetrotters benefit for club sports,
$7000. "So we are generating re
venue," said Phillips.
"We're real promoters," Phillips
added. "We handle all phases of con
cert negotiations. We have produced
concerts in other colleges, also. The
War concert in Santa Clara and the
Kinks in San Jose, for example."
Last year, Scher was "the first suc
cessful" manager to produce for in
terests outside Stanford, according to
Phillips.
"He practically worked for Bill
Graham.'The others (previous mana
gers) didn't know what they were even
doing here," said Phillips.
Help out
"I produced the Santa Clara (War)
show at the request of the dean of stu
dents there," said Phillips.
Cline's statement noted that Special
Events "demonstrated its volatility in
terms of net revenue production" de

spite successful events such as Stills,
Elvin Bishop and Globetrotters.
Meanwhile, a surprising profit mar
gin was shown by the ASSU Sunday
Flicks. The net contribution to the re
serve was $3785.86, an amount which
"will, I'm sure, be subject to criticism"
according to Cline.
At last Monday's ASSU Senate
meeting, Cline reported that the 75-
cent admission would not be reduced
due to anticipated production cost in
creases this spring quarter. However,
he said, the price for season passes will
be reduced to $5 for 10 shows.
The Lecture Notes service showed a
profit of $2694.60 while the Re
frigerator rentals earned $1315.37 this
fall quarter.
It is the policy of the ASSU to keep
all projects on a break-even status, a
policy which Cline said he has "in the
past affirmed, and (will) continue to
recognize."
ASSU Special Events and Travel
Service projects suffered financial set
backs during fall quarter according to
fall quarter project performance state
ments issued by Financial Manager
Chris Cline at an ASSU Senate meeting
two weeks ago.
The Travel Service, which lost about
$1824.17 due to the United Airlines
strike last quarter, is expected to re
cuperate the loss this quarter.
"All of our (charter) flights during
winter quarter have already sold out,"
Cline stated in his report.
ASSU Special Events showed losses
of $1839.44. However, the report is
"not quite accurate,"according to Spe
cial Events Director Randy Phillips.
"The whole statement is really ir
relevant in terms of the (Special
Events) project as a whole," said Phil
lips.
Not included
Phillips pointed out that the Eric
Clapton concert, which brought in a
$6000 profit, was not included in
Cline's statement. The concert was in
stead reported in (former Special
Events Director)Danny Scher's finan
cial statement for tax reasons.
"Much of the money we spent over
the first part of the year has to be amor
tized over the remainder of the year,"
said Phillips. "For example, we have a
contract with the Daily for $5000. This
cost is for a whole year. $4000 is not
used yet."
Phillips also cited costs for ads in the
"trades" (music industry journals and
papers).
'Pushed advertising'
"We really pushed advertising dur
ing the first quarter so people knew
there was an alternative to Bill
Graham," said Phillips.
Graham is a Bay Area entertainment
promoter.
"We've been letting people in the
music industry know that we are via
ble promoters in the South Bay Area.
This (advertising) cost is something I
assessed as necessary, something we
had to do to keep up the impetus
which Danny established," said Phil
lips.
Phillips did acknowledge losses in
the Robert Klein and Firesign Theatre
performances of $3217.71 and
$1007.15 respectively.
'Out of hand'
Phillips also said a $438.12 loss suf
fered by the Leo Kottke concert was
due to "advertising that got out of
hand."
"We had expected to do two shows
and advertised for two. We realized

later that we would only do one show.
(Leo Kottke's) draw was strong, but not
strong enough," explained Phillips.
"We spent more money for advertis
ing because we anticipated selling
more seats than we did."
Phillips had made advertising ar
rangements with Ken Baker Publicity
Services of San Francisco. Phillips
writes the advertising and he and
Baker "discuss where it should be
placed," said Phillips.
"He knows people, he has contacts.
We save 15 percent of the (advertising)
price by working through him. He has
a mailing list that's helpful," added
Phillips.
Phillips said Baker also made
advertising in the trades more accessi
ble.
