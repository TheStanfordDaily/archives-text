# Carter wins N.H. primary; Ford squeaks by Reagan

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — President
Ford and Republican challenger
Ronald Reagan battled to a near stale
mate early this morning as the votes
were counted in New Hampshire's
leadoff presidential primary election.
Former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter
strode past a crowded field to win with
31 percent of the Democratic vote.
Ford held the edge, but it was a nar
row one, in the slow count of the Re
publican race.
The President said he expected to
win in the end. Reagan claimed he al
ready had by holding the President to a
virtual standoff that "far exceeded our
expectations."

First it was Reagan, then it was Ford,
then it was Reagan, then Ford again as
the lead switched with a relative hand
ful of ballots separating the man who
is president by appointment and the
man who wants to deny him White
House nomination.
'A victory'
"1 feel what's happened tonight is a
victory," Reagan told a post-midnight
news conference. He said it could be
either a moral victory or an outright
one.
And, in a line that could be a slogan
for winners and losers in the first of 31
presidential primaries, Reagan added:
"One primary does not a summer
make."
The jubilant Carter said it would for
him. He forecast first-ballot nomina

tion at the Democratic National Con
vention next July, and he emerged as
the clear frontrunner, atop the list of
nine Democratic presidential candi
dates.
The four who didn't tackle him here
await him in primary tests to come.
Carter's closet challenger was
Arizona Rep. Morris K. Udall, who
claimed in his second-place showing
to have emerged as the top liberal con
tender for the nomination. He trailed
Carter by about seven percentage
points.
Ford's strategists were counting on
ballots from Keene, a southwestern
city where he campaigned personally
and where GOP moderates are plenti
ful, to boost his tally. But that was the
last major New Hamsphire city to get
its ballots tallied.
Ford's New Hampshire campaign
manager, Rep. James Cleveland, had a
word for the Reagan victory claim, "1
say it's hog easy."
Cleveland said a victory is a victory.
The presidential preference vote
that got the New Hampshire spotlight
was advisory only. National conven
tion delegates were being elected
separately, and in that category candi
dates pledged to Ford were leading 18

to 3.
Delegates pledged to Carter led for
13 Democratic convention seats, to
Udall for 4.
