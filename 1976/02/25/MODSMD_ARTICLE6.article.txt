# Cline says ASSU needs professional

"I'm not necessarily advocating that
the ASSU make the decision to turn
over its funds to an outside financial
manager," said ASSU Financial Man
ager Chris Cline last night. "What I'm
suggesting is that we consider the pos
sibility â€” that it's one of a number of
alternatives that we might pursue."
Speaking on KZSU's Camp us Con
ference, Cline said improving the re
turn on the ASSU's portfolio is impor
tant because "a large measure of the
funds we are going to allocate toward
making up the shortfall (created by the
University's withdrawal of funding for
the ASSU next year) will come from
our investment portfolio."
He also maintained that "it's dif
ficult to compete against them (pro
fessional investment managers) unless
you have the same amount of expertise
and the same amount of time."
Cline said turning over investments
to a professional would not be the
same as if the ASSU delegated all its
activities to him. He cited ASSU Spe
cial Events' use of a professional pub
licist as evidence that a precedent
exists for employing professionals.
However, Cline said the University
would have a hand in the final deci
sion on whether to employ profession
als. The reason for this is that "the
University asked us to observe certain
constraints in terms of investments on
the portfolio," said Cline.
'Discretion'
The University asked for the con
straints last year when the ASSU
gained "discretion" over its funds as a
result of negotiations between last

year's financial manager. Frank
Olivieri, and the University administ
ration.
Regarding his recent announcement
that the Sunday Flicks will offer
season-passes, which now cost $7,
for $5 next quarter, Cline attributed
the decrease to the "fact that we have
made a profit on the Sunday Flicks
during fall quarter.
'Break even basis'
"I have continually affirmed that the
Sunday Flicks is not meant to be a re
venue generating project and that we
hope to operate it on a break-even
basis," Cline said.
The decision to lower only season
pass prices and to hold single tickets at
their present price of 75 cents was
made on the basis that "those who
support us the most (i.e. season-pass
holders), we feel should be the ones
who benefit from the reduction in
cost," said Cline.
Concerning the decisions on ASSU
financial allocations to organizations
on campus, Cline said that "it is com
mon practice (for organizations) to in
flate their budgets tremendously." He
said allocation decisions are based on
what the financial manager and Senate
perceive are the "basic needs" of each
organization.
Three guidelines which are used in
such decisions, Cline said,are: Funds
are not to be allocated to an organiza
tion for social activities, preference is
given to requests for operating funds,
and funds are allocated to organiza
tions which have "a maximum of
campus outreach."
