# Program opens museum to area residents

Ever wonder why ancient Egyptians walked
flat? Why the Chinese painted vertical land
scapes?
The Educational Program of Stanford Univer
sity Museum of Art answers these questions
— and others like them — for hundreds of area
residents each year.
"We want to help people to better interpret the
content of the museum," says Carol Hay, the
museum's educational curator.
Helping people develop an understanding of
art is only part of the program's purpose.
Founded seven years ago by Art Department
Chairman Lorenz Eitner, the program is de
signed to extend the reach of the museum
beyond the confines of the University campus.
Art appreciation
Its goal, says Hay, is "to help children develop
an appreciation for art and to relate it to their
studies in school."
The educational program enables the students
— orany other interested group — to learn about
the cultural and historical background of an
exhibit before actually touring the museum. To
accomplish this, a docent (a person trained to
explain museum exhibits), describes exhibits of
interest to the group through a combination lec
ture and slide show, which is known as a
portfolio.
The docents form the backbone of the prog
ram. A group of roughly 60 women, the docents
are composed of volunteers from the Stanford
Committee for Art. In order to become docents,
the women spend a year studying Egyptian,
Chinese, Greek and American Indian art here.

They receive additional training from curator
Hay as well.
Docents must also have stamina. Last year
they presented over 200 portfolios on various
exhibits. In addition, 14,870 people took advan
tage of docent-guided tours of the museum.
Portfolio showings
There is no upper age limit on the groups
using the program. Recent portfolio showings
have been held at Sunnyvale and Cupertino
elementary schools as well as Palo Alto and
Crystal Springs High Schools. Students at
DeAnza and Canada colleges have also seen the
docent's presentations.
Nevertheless, it is difficult to tell exactly how
effective the program is, Hay says. The program
simply does not produce the kind of results that
can be measured in quantitative terms, she adds.
Measurable or not, portfolio showings are be
coming a regular part of the educational system
in the area, Hay says.
Although the program is not officially adver
tised in the schools, many teachers hear of it
from their colleagues and decide to try the prog
ram for their own classes. Most get hooked on
the first trip.
"Many teachers bring their classes back sev
eral times to see different exhibits," she com
ments.
The teachers are not the only ones who ap
preciate the program. Its reputation has spread
beyond the school system.
"The number of adult groups using the prog
ram has increased dramatically in the past year."

elementary schools as well as Palo Alto and
Crystal Springs High Schools. Students at
DeAnza and Canada colleges have also seen the
docent's presentations.
Nevertheless, it is difficult to tell exactly how
effective the program is, Hay says. The program
simply does not produce the kind of results that
can be measured in quantitative terms, she adds.
Measurable or not, portfolio showings are be
coming a regular part of the educational system
in the area, Hay says.
Although the program is not officially adver
tised in the schools, many teachers hear of it
from their colleagues and decide to try the prog
ram for their own classes. Most get hooked on
the first trip.
"Many teachers bring their classes back sev
eral times to see different exhibits," she com
ments.
The teachers are not the only ones who ap
preciate the program. Its reputation has spread
beyond the school system.
"The number of adult groups using the prog
ram has increased dramatically in the past year."

program is "to help children develop an ap
preciation for art" and to try and help them
"relate it to their studies in school."
Ever wonder why ancient Egyptians walked
flat? Why the Chinese painted vertical land
scapes?
The Educational Program of Stanford Univer
sity Museum of Art answers these questions
— and others like them — for hundreds of area
residents each year.
"We want to help people to better interpret the
content of the museum," says Carol Hay, the
museum's educational curator.
Helping people develop an understanding of
art is only part of the program's purpose.
Founded seven years ago by Art Department
Chairman Lorenz Eitner, the program is de
signed to extend the reach of the museum
beyond the confines of the University campus.
Art appreciation
Its goal, says Hay, is "to help children develop
an appreciation for art and to relate it to their
studies in school."
The educational program enables the students
— orany other interested group — to learn about
the cultural and historical background of an
exhibit before actually touring the museum. To
accomplish this, a docent (a person trained to
explain museum exhibits), describes exhibits of
interest to the group through a combination lec
ture and slide show, which is known as a
portfolio.
The docents form the backbone of the prog
ram. A group of roughly 60 women, the docents
are composed of volunteers from the Stanford
Committee for Art. In order to become docents,
the women spend a year studying Egyptian,
Chinese, Greek and American Indian art here.

They receive additional training from curator
Hay as well.
Docents must also have stamina. Last year
they presented over 200 portfolios on various
exhibits. In addition, 14,870 people took advan
tage of docent-guided tours of the museum.
Portfolio showings
There is no upper age limit on the groups
using the program. Recent portfolio showings
have been held at Sunnyvale and Cupertino
elementary schools as well as Palo Alto and
Crystal Springs High Schools. Students at
DeAnza and Canada colleges have also seen the
docent's presentations.
Nevertheless, it is difficult to tell exactly how
effective the program is, Hay says. The program
