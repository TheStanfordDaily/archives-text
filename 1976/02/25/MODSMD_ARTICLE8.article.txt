## Opinions editorial Welcome, guest profs 
### 
We commend the ASSU Senate and
the ASSU Guest Professorship Board for
inviting three guest professors for spring
quarter who will help fill gaping deficits
in the current faculty and are certainly in
keeping with the spirit under which the
original guest professor fee assessment
passed.
Marxist philosopher Angela Davis and
radical psychiatrist Claude Steiner
would be valuable additions to the fa
culty of any university. So would
economist Ernest Mandel, whose invita
tion to teach here has been withdrawn.
Critics have charged that the board in
vited only people whose politics were
"radical," and that the senate did not act
in accordance with the wishes of the
majority of students.
But one of the original purposes of the
ASSU Guest Professorship was to al
leviate weaknesses in the Stanford fa
culty. More governments of the world
profess to follow the tenets of Marxism
than of any other doctrine, yet that

philosophy is woefully underrepre
sented on the Stanford faculty.
In inviting Davis, Steiner and Mandel,
the board and the senate acted in accor
dance with the principles of the original
referendum, which was tied in many
people's minds to the invitation of Viet
namese journalist Nguyen Huu Thai.
The board can not be accused of refus
ing to solicit student input. It sent letters
of inquiry to every person suggested to
it, after an article on the front page of the
Daily requested such suggestions.
From the nine positive responses re
ceived, the board selected three. It
explained to the senate its criteria in
doing so, and the senate — elected by
the student body — overwhelmingly ap
proved the choices.
We welcome Angela Davis and Claude
Steiner to Stanford, and hope that other
organizations will follow the example of
the ASSU Guest Professorship Board in
soliciting input and making informed
decisions.
