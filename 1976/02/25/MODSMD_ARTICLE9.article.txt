# Humanities' ills: again
## 
### 
Robert Cohn

I wish to congratulate the
Daily on a fine job of investiga
tive reporting about the plight of
the humanities. However, the
breezy optimism expressed by
many colleagues raises my eyeb
rows (and at times my hair).
That it is, to say the least, ill
founded is shown by the follow
ing:
—President Richard Lyman's
admission the humanities are
"pale" next to engineering. This
is health?

—a remark by a well-placed
dean that the choices of applying
students fully reflect the weak
ness of humanities here;
—a thinking exercise: im
agine a brilliant young faculty
member given the option of a
professorship in the humanities
at Harvard or Stanford, at
roughly equal conditions. Next
try Yale. Next imagine Stanford
without its climate.
I must also observe that the ar
ticles lumped social science and

humanities together. That kind
of confusion is precisely what
has kept humanities from or
ganizing even an effective voice
here.
What we need, as German
Prof. Gerald Gillespie says, is a
plan for humanities. For starters,
a Task Force with humanists on
it (unlike the Study of Education
at Stanford Committee which
had only one true member of the
species).
And it would be nice to have a
fighting Dean of the Humanities:
the only full humanist we had in
the presently hybrid post was
induced to resign rather quickly.
The Metternichians "up
stairs" have used a "lump and
rule" technique based on con
descension: in a joint
Humanities and Science school,
the sciences being richer (e.g.
from government money), we in
the humanities should be happy
to get some of the trickled-down
largesse and shut up.
I am as aware as the next per
son of the argument for organic
and "humble" development and
against prima donnas; but I have
become a bit wily myself here in
self defense. My reasoning was
that a few superstars would
make it a little harder to condes
cend.
If 'anyone can think of a
cleaner way to shake off the
stranglehold of big technology
and big money here, I'd be tick
led.
