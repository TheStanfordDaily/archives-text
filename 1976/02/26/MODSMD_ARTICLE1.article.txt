# Traditions quietly vanish

Who remembers the Plug Ugly? The freshman
sophomore rush? How about tubbing, or the an
nual pajamarino?
Almost nobody. All are Stanford traditions that died out
long ago. And while some, like "kissing in the Quad," are
making a comeback, others are recalled only in the musty
pages of the earliest Quads.
But why did Stanford traditions evolve in the first place?
And if our grandparents enjoyed them so much, why aren't
the same rituals around today?
"People have a need for traditions," says Gerald Talley,
acting assistant professor of sociology. Years spent in
college are ones of emotional, intellectual and aspirational
change. "It is important to have something stable, even if
it's belonging to the Stanford community," remarks Talley.
There are two basic reasons for the existence of tradi
tions here, according to Talley. The first is to initiate mem

bers into the group "so they get a feeling they really belong
here, that they're not still at home, but in a new place."
The second reason people cling to traditions is to "reaf
firm their membership in the group." For example, Talley
says, "only insiders participate in the Big Game. He exp
lains that taking part in Big Game activities such as the
bonfire "says I'm a Stanford person, in contrast to those
others at Cal.'"
These needs have created some antics at Stanford that
can only be termed bizarre. Birge M. Clark, a member of
the class of 1914, can remember one such custom â€” the
freshman-sophomore rush, an annual wale-on-'em free
for-all.
"In those days the freshman-sophomore rushes were
called tie-ups,' " he reminisces, "and they were held on
the baseball diamond" located between the main library
and Encina, a men's dorm at that time.
