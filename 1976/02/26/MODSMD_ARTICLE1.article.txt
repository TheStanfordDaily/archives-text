# Traditions quietly vanish

Who remembers the Plug Ugly? The freshman
sophomore rush? How about tubbing, or the an
nual pajamarino?
Almost nobody. All are Stanford traditions that died out
long ago. And while some, like "kissing in the Quad," are
making a comeback, others are recalled only in the musty
pages of the earliest Quads.
But why did Stanford traditions evolve in the first place?
And if our grandparents enjoyed them so much, why aren't
the same rituals around today?
"People have a need for traditions," says Gerald Talley,
acting assistant professor of sociology. Years spent in
college are ones of emotional, intellectual and aspirational
change. "It is important to have something stable, even if
it's belonging to the Stanford community," remarks Talley.
There are two basic reasons for the existence of tradi
tions here, according to Talley. The first is to initiate mem

bers into the group "so they get a feeling they really belong
here, that they're not still at home, but in a new place."
The second reason people cling to traditions is to "reaf
firm their membership in the group." For example, Talley
says, "only insiders participate in the Big Game. He exp
lains that taking part in Big Game activities such as the
bonfire "says I'm a Stanford person, in contrast to those
others at Cal.'"
These needs have created some antics at Stanford that
can only be termed bizarre. Birge M. Clark, a member of
the class of 1914, can remember one such custom — the
freshman-sophomore rush, an annual wale-on-'em free
for-all.
"In those days the freshman-sophomore rushes were
called tie-ups,' " he reminisces, "and they were held on
the baseball diamond" located between the main library
and Encina, a men's dorm at that time.

Compounds for each class
were marked off and the men
(women "strictly were not in
volved in this sort of thing) were
provided with cloth bandages.
Each class was divided into

groups of five and lined up on op
posite sides of the baseball
diamond.
Juniors and seniors supervised
as the groups of underclassmen
rushed at each other and tried to
isolate one of the opposite class"

in order to tie him up.
"Some (men) were quite skill
ful" in taking one wrist or ankle,
making "a slip noose, and jerking
up the other one," recalls Clark.
"Then they would go running off,
carrying or dragging their victim to

the compound.
"The sophomores usually suc
ceeded in tying up most of the
freshmen. The freshmen had a
reputation for not being very well
organized," laughs Clark.
Tubbing was a more odious
form of freshman hazing, accord
ing to Clark.
The bathtubs were filled with
water from Searsville Lake, which
"smelled very bad," Clark says.
The unfortunate freshman was
"held under until he bubbled,
which meant that he had taken
water into his lungs. Then he'd be
taken out and rescuscitated." No
one ever died, but one man "al
most drowned," recalls Clark.
Certain types of clothes and
ways of wearing them have al
ways set Stanford students apart
from others, and even differen
tiated members of the four clas
ses.
Hats were an important part of
one's dress in the early days at
Stanford. Although the 1915 Quad
says that traditionally, "due to the
climatological result of Stanford's
mild and clear air" Stanford

women went hatless, the men still
wore them. Freshmen donned
caps or "dinks," while the sopho
mores sported red hats with gray
bands.
"Gray stovepipe hats" called
plugs were worn by the juniors,
says Clark, and emeritus profes
sor Harold Bacon recalls that the
senior sombreros, which looked
like "engineers' hats or army
campaign hats," dated back to be
fore 1901, when his father was a
student.
Plug Ugly'
The junior hats were the focus
of another long-dead tradition, the
Plug Ugly. This was "an upper
class fight between the juniors
and seniors," explains Clark.
Art students would paint the
junior plugs with a white paint con
taining lead, which dried to a very
hard finish. On a designated day
the juniors would march around
the inner Quad carrying their hats,
which Clark says were "used as
weapons" against bands of
marauding seniors bent on
smashing the plugs.

THE PLUGS OF 1900—Members of the junior class solemnly display their treasured Plugs, soon to
become objects of contention in the Plug Ugly debacle. The gray stove-pipes, painted with class
numerals, slogans, and symbols, were used as weapons against attacking seniors.
Clark comments that the heavy,
hard hats were very dangerous
and that "several people were
badly cut. There were broken
arms, too, when people fell down
the steps to the Quad."
Because of increasing physical

danger associated with the Plug
Ugly, the ceremony was
abolished in 1913. As Clark puts it,
tongue-in-cheek, "it was all right
for the freshmen and sophomores
to fight because they were kind of
savages anyway, but up
perclassmen shouldn't do t; .at
sort of thing."

But the annual pajamarino, or
"nightshirt peerade," had to have
been the zaniest custom of all.
On the first moonlight night of
the year Encina men, instead of
growing hair on their palms,
marched to Roble where they
serenaded the sleepy female in
habitants. From there they

paraded along the Row. and fi
nally cruised into Palo Alto and
crashed the theatre for some late
night entertainment.
Human ladders
That entertainment must have
been extremely stimulating be
cause records tell of student
police clashes and people injured
when they were used as ladders
to reach the balcony.
The 1915 Quad says this quaint
tradition "started the night of April
23,1892 when 220 Encina men in
white night shirts (over clothes)
marched along Alvarado, circling
around Roble and then to
Mayfield."
The men were celebrating Stan
ford's baseball victory over Cal,
and eventually marched to Menlo
to provide an escort for the
homecoming heroes.
Sociology professor Morris Zel
ditch Jr. presents two compelling
reasons most such traditions are
gone for good.
First, he notes that over the
years graduate enrollment has in
creased relative to the number of

undergraduates at Stanford He
hypothesizes that graduate stu
dents are more interested in
what's going on in their fields
worldwide rather than in local
symbols and rituals, and that this
global view has broadened the
isolated, tightly-knit community
feeling necessary for many Stan
ford traditions.
Zelditch also points out that
Stanford is no longer a finishing
school for the middle and upper
classes. Four years at Stanford
used to be social "preparation for
assuming a certain place in the
class structure."
Playboy school
But as increasing numbers of
students are preparing for careers
rather than inherited wealth a
Stanford education has become
less socially oriented. The image
of Stanford as a playboy school
has waned, and with it have gone
many social traditions.
Talley agrees with Zelditch that
students' increasing career orien
tations led to the death of many
traditions.
"Stanford is more and more a
training institution," Talley exp
lains. "It doesn't have the flavor of
community and family" it used to
have.
"People have enormous career
drives," Talley concludes. Stu
dents are at Stanford to prepare
for med school or law school.
"They're on their way to some
other community, even if it's only
in their heads. In the early days
college was an end in itself," but
that feeling isn't so common to
day.
