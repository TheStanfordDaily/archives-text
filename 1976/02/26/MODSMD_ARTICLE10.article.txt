# Media must alter outlook, former 'Look' editor says
## 
### Loie Sauer 
The mass media must be put
back on a constructive track,
former Look editor George
Leonard told 100 people at Tre
sidder Union Tuesday.
Leonard's speech, which he cal
led "a marriage between the
media and the martial arts" was
sponsored by the Stanford Martial
Arts Association and the Tresid
der Program Board.
What the public hears through
the media is "mostly bad news,
news of destruction, and the
breaking down of form," he said.
"The present tremendous em
phasis on investigative reporting
has its bad as well as its good
aspects," he said. Investigative
reporting carries "not an air of cor
rection, but an air of destruction."
Woodward-Bernstein
He called this the "Woodward-
Bernstein syndrome." He said
that the "root of the fantasy" in
many budding journalists is to ex
pose and bring down some cor
rupt structure. "It's a daydream of
pure destructiveness," he said.
The effects of investigative re
porting are good, he said. The
problem is that it has become an
over-emphasized specialty.
"I want to go on record as being
in favor of investigative reporting,"
he said. He advised the media to
"continue to nail the corrupt bas
tard who's cheating the public."
He cautioned, however, that "to
bring down a government takes
courage, but not as much courage
as building things up."
Leonard, 52, received his black
belt in Aikido two weeks ago, and
currently writes freelance articles
and gives lectures. He also leads
workshops on the martial arts and
"energy flow "on college cam
puses.
Leonard read a quote from
psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, in

which Freud said the struggle be
tween destructive and construc
tive processes is the essence of
life.
Leonard used Freud's term
"eros" to describe "the construc
tive, creative process. Eros is the
joining of elements into a greater,
more ordered whole. It is negative
entropy."
The opposite process is
"thanatose." he said. "Thanatose
is a disordering, a destruction of
forms."
He called for a transformation in
mass media from a focus on
thanatose to one on eros, and re
lated the two forces to the martial
arts.
Dialectic existence
"All existence is dialectic," he
said. "Thanatose and eros are
synthesized in the cosmos, which
is the ultimate moment of har
mony. In Aikido the attacker
dances thanatose. the possibility
of destruction. The defender
dances around him and the two
become the dance of life.
"Maybe our news media will
look beyond the thanatose and
eros and see cosmos,' he said.
A great deal of current news
comes under the classification of
"contests" and contains "fight or
struggle metaphors," he said. "It's
very hard to think or write without
using them. There was the War on
Poverty. Ford wanted to whip in
flation now.' Built in our very
bones is the idea of struggle."
No agreement
One reason that "good news" is
hard to find is that "right now we
can't agree on what's good news
or bad news."
During the time of America's
westward expansion, for exam
ple, everyone knew what good
news was, he said. When two rail
roads were joined or a new hotel
built, it was good news, he said.

'Today when we hear that
many Vietnamese were killed, is it
good news or bad news? Or when
a new freeway is planned?
"We are adrift," he said. "We've
lost our consensus. The territory
of generally agreed upon good
news is getting smaller all the
time."
"Transformed media"
Leonard said he has a "positive
vision of a transformed media that
will serve eros in the building of
humanity." The media should de
velop a new vocabulary to de
scribe "adventures of conscious
ness" and feelings, he said.
"I present this vision to elicit vis
ions in others."
He advised journalists to "be
willing to be enthusiastic. Be cyni
cal, too. But be open and reveal
yourself. Learn to be both learned
and a learner."
While Look senior editor he
produced some special issues
which were "pure eros," he said.
These were "California: A New
Game with New Rules" in 1966
and"The Seventies: Mankind's
Last, Best Chance" in 1970.

former Look editor George
Leonard told 100 people at Tre
sidder Union Tuesday.
Leonard's speech, which he cal
led "a marriage between the
media and the martial arts" was
sponsored by the Stanford Martial
Arts Association and the Tresid
der Program Board.
What the public hears through
the media is "mostly bad news,
news of destruction, and the
breaking down of form," he said.
"The present tremendous em
phasis on investigative reporting
has its bad as well as its good
aspects," he said. Investigative
reporting carries "not an air of cor
rection, but an air of destruction."
Woodward-Bernstein
He called this the "Woodward-
Bernstein syndrome." He said
that the "root of the fantasy" in
many budding journalists is to ex
pose and bring down some cor
rupt structure. "It's a daydream of
pure destructiveness," he said.
The effects of investigative re
porting are good, he said. The
problem is that it has become an
over-emphasized specialty.
"I want to go on record as being
in favor of investigative reporting,"
he said. He advised the media to
"continue to nail the corrupt bas
tard who's cheating the public."
He cautioned, however, that "to
bring down a government takes
courage, but not as much courage
as building things up."
Leonard, 52, received his black
belt in Aikido two weeks ago, and
currently writes freelance articles
and gives lectures. He also leads
workshops on the martial arts and
"energy flow "on college cam
puses.
Leonard read a quote from
psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, in

which Freud said the struggle be
tween destructive and construc
tive processes is the essence of
life.
Leonard used Freud's term
"eros" to describe "the construc
tive, creative process. Eros is the
joining of elements into a greater,
more ordered whole. It is negative
entropy."
The opposite process is
"thanatose." he said. "Thanatose
is a disordering, a destruction of
forms."
He called for a transformation in
mass media from a focus on
thanatose to one on eros, and re
lated the two forces to the martial
arts.
Dialectic existence
"All existence is dialectic," he
said. "Thanatose and eros are
synthesized in the cosmos, which
is the ultimate moment of har
mony. In Aikido the attacker
dances thanatose. the possibility
of destruction. The defender
dances around him and the two
become the dance of life.
"Maybe our news media will
look beyond the thanatose and
eros and see cosmos,' he said.
A great deal of current news
comes under the classification of
"contests" and contains "fight or
struggle metaphors," he said. "It's
very hard to think or write without
using them. There was the War on
Poverty. Ford wanted to whip in
flation now.' Built in our very
bones is the idea of struggle."
No agreement
One reason that "good news" is
hard to find is that "right now we
can't agree on what's good news
or bad news."
During the time of America's
westward expansion, for exam
ple, everyone knew what good
news was, he said. When two rail
roads were joined or a new hotel
built, it was good news, he said.

'Today when we hear that
many Vietnamese were killed, is it
good news or bad news? Or when
a new freeway is planned?
"We are adrift," he said. "We've
lost our consensus. The territory
of generally agreed upon good
news is getting smaller all the
time."
"Transformed media"
Leonard said he has a "positive
vision of a transformed media that
will serve eros in the building of
humanity." The media should de
velop a new vocabulary to de
scribe "adventures of conscious
ness" and feelings, he said.
"I present this vision to elicit vis
ions in others."
He advised journalists to "be
willing to be enthusiastic. Be cyni
cal, too. But be open and reveal
yourself. Learn to be both learned
and a learner."
While Look senior editor he
produced some special issues
which were "pure eros," he said.
These were "California: A New
Game with New Rules" in 1966
and"The Seventies: Mankind's
Last, Best Chance" in 1970.
The mass media must be put
back on a constructive track,
