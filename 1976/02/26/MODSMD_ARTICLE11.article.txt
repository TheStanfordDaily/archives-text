# Counseling program may be dropped

### Geoffrey Samuels 
An experimental peer advising
program, located in Branner and
Stern halls, has been having diffi
culty attracting students through
out the quarter and may be dis
continued in the spring if there is
no increase in demand, according
to program coordinator Charlotte
Germane.
Germane, a member of the
Council of Presidents, said that
there has recently been a distribu
tion of information throughout the
campus in an attempt to increase
student awareness of the prog
ram.
Improved student response is
necessary for the pilot program to
continue, she said.
She cited a lack of publicity as
the cause for minimal student in
terest. "The only publicity we
had," she said, "was one story in
the Daily "
The program was introduced
during fall registration as a sup
plement to departmental advising
by faculty members. It consists of
seven students who hold regular
hours for academic advising in the
Branner lounge and Stern office.
The students trained were by the
Academic Information Center Di
rector Bob Hamrdla.
Difficulties in student relations
with departmental advisors led to

the creation of the program, Ger
mane explained.
"It's academic advising," Ger
mane said, "and there are refer
rals if there is a need for other
forms of counseling."
Students had complained that
they were not comfortable with or
that they had difficulties in contact
ing their advisors.
A 1974 study sponsored by the
office of the Dean of Student Af
fairs found that the majority of stu
dents prefer to consult their peers
when they have- difficulties. It is in
this context that the peer advising
program was initiated. Germane
said.
Joan Trusty, a peer advisor,
said that most students who used
the service were freshman. Ques
tions ranged from structuring a
pre-med program to opportunities
for independent research.
Recent publicity has increased
student interest in the program,
Trusty said "We're getting the
response that we want now that
we've stepped up the publicity,"
she said.
However, she also attributed
the improved response to
academic problems which arise
during pre-registration. Demand
fell during the past quarter until
advisors stopped holding office
hours.
