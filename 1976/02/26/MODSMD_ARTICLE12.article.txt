# Name a building — it only costs $600,000

### Kathryn Ma 
Happen to have an extra eight
million dollars lying around your
room? If so. and you are the first in
line, the new addition to Main Lib
rary could bear your name. Or, for
the paltry sum of $600,000, one of
the new Row houses would
forever immortalize your name in
stone — or at least wood.
Most of the buildings on cam
pus are named for or by their prin
cipal donors. Even now, the

search continues for philan
thropists with a streak of vanity
who want their names to become
a bit more well-known.
Florence Moore Hall bears the
name of its major benefactor, who
also included a bequest in her will
that has helped build the new stu
dent residences which will open
next year. The investment of the
original $750,000 bequest has
yielded about $I,3oo,ooo.accord
ing to Kenneth Cuthbertson, vice

president for development, which
has paid for two of the three Row
houses under construction. They
will most likely be named "Robert
Moore House. North" and
"South", after her husband.
We are looking for a gift of
$600,000 for the third house."
Cuthbertson added hopefully.
Library gift
But finding a $600,000 gift for
the Row house is the least of his
worries and seems a small sum
when compared to the request for
$8 million for the construction of
the addition to Main Library. An
anonymous donor has given the
largest gift so far, "and indicated
that $5 million could be allocated
to the new building as an encour
agement to other donors,"
claimed Cuthbertson. The Uni
versity's request, reduced from
$12 million of the projected $20
million cost, to $10 million and
then to $8 million, where it stands
now, has not been met.
It's been a great disappoint
ment to me," says Cuthbertson,
adding that the school can reduce
the initial request of one-half the

construction cost for putting a
name on the building "depending
on how much we think we can get
in gifts of other sizes. Usually, at
least one-third is asked for. It
looks like $8 million will be as low
as we can go on Main Library.
If you can't afford a whole build
ing, you could put your name on
part of one. Multiple donors are
very common and some have
been immortalized on inner, not
outer, doors. Kresge Auditorium in
the new law school and Annen
berg Auditorium in the Cummings
Art Building are two such exam
ples.
There was only one original
building named after a person
when Stanford opened, notes
Ralph Hansen, chief of acquisi
tions for the University library sys
tem. The Department of Political
Sciences in the Quad was origi
nally named after Thomas Welton
Stanford, "the man who made his
fortune in Australia," says Han
sen.
Jane and Leland Stanford Sr.
chose the names of the original
buildings. "They just named them

as they liked," commented Oscar
Nelson, university master plan
ner. They weren't that vain that
they wanted their names on every
building. After all, the whole uni
versity was already named after
them."
Street names
Nelson's office is in charge of
naming new streets. "We are try
ing to move away from innocuous
names like Panama'or Galvez,' "
he says. "We try to select a name
related to the locale of the street
and the function of nearby build
ings." For example, a street be
hind the law school complex was
named "Nathan Abbot Way" in
honor of a former dean of Stanford
Law School.
"Never name a street after any
one who's living," Nelson warns,
for "they might end up in dis
grace."
Less obvious memorials also
dot the campus. The four corners
of the Inner Quad are graced by
drinking fountains generously do
nated by the Classes of '24-'27. A
plaque easily missed by the daily
student traffic in White Plaza de
dicates that area to the memory of
the White brothes, two Stanford
alumni killed in tragic accidents.
Near the Cummings Art Buildings
a tree planted in memory of a
suicide victim shades a bench and
a small plaque which reads "He
sought peace, may others find it
here."
Nor are the donors limited to pri
vate foundation and personal
gifts. Upon the death of former
University President Tresidder,
students voted to approve of a fee

assessment that helped pay for
Tresidder Memorial Union. Con
struction of the Herbert Hoover
Memorial Building which begins
soon is partially financed by a
Congressional allocation of $7
million.
Nicknames
As a federal memorial, the build
ing will be named after the donor
of Hoover Tower, but as a Stan
ford edifice, it may soon fall prey to
the nicknaming plague that has
swept the campus. The plague
has left us with such memorables
as "Mem Chu," "Dink," and the

unforgetable "Lou Hen Hoo How.'
If you can't afford one-third the
cost of a building and a dormitory
doesn't thrill you, you probably
won't live to see your name en
graved upon Stanford, unless
you're an unscrupulous tree
carver. Stanford does not encour
age your last alternative: planting
trees and bronze plaques all over
campus.
"We've tried to discourage too
much of that sort of individual
planning," comments Nelson.
"The campus would look like
Forest Lawn, North."
