Contempt action begins
WASHINGTON — A House subcommit
tee began contempt action yesterday
against five federal agents who. under or
ders from top administration officials, re
fused to testify on interception of cable traf
fic for intelligence purposes.
The five include three present FBI agents
and a former agent who told the House
government information subcommittee
they had been ordered by Atty. Gen. Ed
ward Levi not to testify.
An employe of the National Security
Agency also involved in the 29-year-long
cable interception operation known as
Shamrock said his order came from Deputy
Secretary of Defense William Clements.
President Ford told Levi and Clements
last week not to comply with the subcommit
tee s blanket subpoena for all documents
and records relating to the cable intercep
tions since January 1947.
Ford said the scope of the records sought
was so broad that it encompassed sensitive
national security information.
Meanwhile, the Senate intelligence
committee voted to turn over to the Justice
Department its files on mail opening by the
Central Intelligence Agency and the FBI
and electronic eavesdropping by the Na
tional Security Agency, chairman Frank
Church (D-ldaho) said.
Ford picks UN delegate
WASHINGTON — President Ford said
yesterday he is giving former Pennsylvania
Gov. William Scranton the job of "standing
up for the United States against some of
those unfair attacks in the United Nations.
Ford nominated his "good, close, per-

sonal friend" to succeed Daniel Moynihan
as U.N ambassador and reaffirmed ad
ministration promises that the United
States will take a firm stand in the world
organization.
The actions of Moynihan, Ford said,
"have been good from the point of view of
the United States."
Scranton, appearing before cameras and
reporters with Ford and Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger in the White House Oval
Office, said the job was "a great honor" but
a very difficult one.
Clerk identifies Soliah
SACRAMENTO — A former bank
employe yesterday identified Steven Sol
lah's picture as that of a gun-wielding man
she saw in the lobby of a bank during a
holdup in which a woman was killed.
Kathleen James said she stared into the
man's eyes for sto 10 seconds as he stood
in the lobby of the bank, slowly waving a
double barreled rifle back and forth.
"When you go through a robbery like that
and you look a man in the face, you don't
forget." said James, a bookkeeper at
the bank during the April 1975 holdup.
She is expected to be a key prosecution
witness at Soliah's trial.
Earlier, pictures which resembled Pat
ricia Hearst were identified by a witness as
the woman who rented a garage where a

r
Associated Press

car was stored before it was used in the
robbery.
However, despite repeated questions
from the reporters who saw the pictures, the
prosecutor who showed the pictures during
a recess refused to comment on the wo
man's identity.
Hearst used drugs?
SAN FRANCISCO — A psychiatrist who
portrayed Patricia Hearst as "a naive
schoolgirl" before her kidnaping conceded
under cross-examination yesterday that
Hearst had smoked marijuana, used mes
caline and may have experimented with
LSD.
But Dr. L.J. West insisted that information
had nothing to do with his evaluation of the
22-year-old heiress. He said he meant she
was politically naive.
The references to Hearst's drug use were
the first before the jury, although a recently
published book by her former fiance also
covered the subject.
After a relatively brief redirect examina
tion by the defense. West wrapped up his
three days on the witness stand by defend
ing a battery of tests he administered to the
defendant.
The next defense witness called was Dr.
Martin Orne, a psychiatrist from the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania. He was on the stand

when court adjourned for the day.
Nixon hosts China fete
PEKING — Richard Nixon predicted last
night that China and the United States will
complete the "bridge of understanding,
mutual respect and lasting friendship"
begun four years ago.
He told his guests at a banquet closing
his visit to Peking that both nations share a
common interest in helping to build a "new
world in which every nation, large and
small, can be free to choose its own way to
be independent and to live without fear of
aggression from any power."
The Nixons invited 300 guests to the
banquet in the Great Hall of the People. The
engraved invitations began:
"The Former President of the United
States of America and Mrs. Nixon cordially
invite ..
About the time the banquet was under
way in China, Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-
Ariz), said in the United States that Nixon
could do the country a favor by staying in
China. He also accused Nixon of breaking a
law by making statements in Peking about
U.S. foreign policy.
He said he referred to the Logan Act
which reserves foreign policy discussions
for the president and secretary of state.
There was no immediate comment from the
Nixon party on Goldwater's remarks.
