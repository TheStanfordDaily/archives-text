# Photo art develops

### Anita Mozley 
Photographs are put to many uses in our society.
They serve the sciences, are part of our daily infor
mation of the events of the world, illustrate for us
objects we might not otherwise comprehend so
exactly, prove personal identity, help us remember
what we are afraid we might forget and serve as
talismans of our past.
Photographs also can be interpretations of their
subjects, as powerful in their ability to command our
attentive scrutiny and study as any other kind of
picture.
Today photography of this latter sort, photo
graphy as an expressive medium, is celebrated to
an extent that would have been unthinkable even 10
years ago. Its practice is taught as a part of
academic studies; the study of its history has a place
in the art departments of universities; photographs
are collected by individuals and by institutions; and
in the marketplace, photographic prints of the past

command ever-higher prices as they become more
scarce.
Demand for photos
Transatlantic battles are waged over such rare
photographic treasures, for instance, as the album
of prints that the mid-Victorian photographer Julia
Margaret Cameron presented to the British as
tronomer and inventor Sir John Herschel in 1864.
Bought at auction in London in 1974 by an American
collector, the album of 94 prints was recently saved
by national subscription for England's National Por
trait Gallery.
The demand today is not only for prints by photo
graphers such as Cameron. who consciously
used the medium as a means of personal expres
sion. but for photographs which were made, origi
nally, to serve some of the other purposes men
tioned above.
We today see as fine examples of the art of

photography the prints
that Timothy O Sullivan
made in the 1870s for the U.S.
Government s Geographic and
Geological Surveys of the West
ern Territories. Although originally
intended to convey specific and
useful information about the geol
ogy and geography of uncharted
lands. O Sullivan s prints are seen
more often today by eyes accus
tomed, through the influence of
twentieth-century painting and
sculpture, to finding significance
in the relation of positive to nega
tive spaces than by eyes that can
read the information that the
photographs were taken to con
vey.
Shopfronts and doorways
The French photographer
Eugene Atget, who took photo
graphs of the streets, shopfronts
and doorways of Paris in the clear
morning light, advertised his prints
as Documents for Artists." But
now he himself is seen to be an
artist of the camera, and his origi
nal prints, literally saved from de
struction in Paris in the 1920s by
the American photographer Ber
nice Abbott, are rare and highly
prized examples of photographic
documentation so consistent in its
revelation of the subject that we
seek them as part of the continu
ing tradition of the art of photo
graphy.
Photography was made possi
ble by developments in the sci
ences of optics and chemistry.
The desire for its invention had its
roots in the search for realism that
was increasingly felt in the paint
ing and drawing of the 19th
century.
Although there were several
who contributed to its invention,
two men were finally successful in
fixing the images received
through the lens of the camera on
chemically treated grounds: Louis
Jacques Mande Daguerre, the
Parisian painter of the diorama,
and William Henry Fox Talbot, an
English country gentleman and
amateur of the arts and sciences.
Neither knew of the other's work,
although both of them had been
conducting their experiments
simultaneously
Daguerre vs. Talbot
Daguerre s invention, a re
versed image on a silvered plate
(which we know as the daguer
reotype). was announced by the
astronomer Arrago to the French
Academy of Sciences on Jan.
7. 1839. Fox Talbot, already suc
cessful, learned of the an
nouncement with some amaze
ment and immediately arranged to
have his process, a paper nega
tive and positive paper print (the
calotype), announced and de
scribed in London on Jan. 31
of that year.
Although Daguerre s process,
enchanting in its fineness of detail
and subtle gradation of tone, re
mained the most popular in this
country until about 1860. it was
Fox Talbot s positive-negative
process that forecast photo
graphy as we know it today. Ac
cording to an eyewitness report of
the first daguerreotypes made in
Paris in 1839. (Everyone)
counted roof tiles and chimney

bricks, was astonished to see the
very mortar between the
bricks
This appreciation of detailed
representation made Fox Talbot's
process, with its heavy contrasts
in light and shadow, generally less
valued than the daguerreotype
However, in the hands of two
Scottish pioneer photographers,
David Octavius Hill and Robert
Adamson, who made calotypes of
eminent Scotsmen in Edinburgh
in the 1840s, the effect of the
calotype was, according to an
admirer, "Rembrandt perfected."
There are many individual
photographers whose names
should be mentioned in any re
sume of the history of photo
graphy; it is impossible in this con
text to call them all up But cer
tainly I must include the name of
Eadweard Muybridge, the photo
grapher who made here at the
Palo Alto Stock Rancho, as he so
quaintly called it, the first analyti
cal photographs of animals and
human beings in fast motion.
Muybridge's work led to further
experiments in methods of photo
graphing motion by the
physiologist Marey of France, and
then to the development of a form
of photography that almost all of
us witness daily â€” the motion pic
ture.
Press the button
The purity of intention of the
19th-century workers was
somewhat deflected by the 1888
introduction of George Eastman's
Kodak: you pressed the button,
the Eastman Company did the
rest. A general aimlessness about
photographic intention ensued,
partly the democratizing result of
Eastman s camera.

But in 1902. the universally
acknowledged champion of the
art of photography came forth,
fresh from studies in Berlin and in
England: Alfred Stieglitz. born in
Hoboken, N.J., proc
laimed in an exhibition in New
York City the fine art of photo
graphy in the first exhibition of
The Photo-Secessionists." and
thereafter published criticism,
theory and polemics to support his
argument. In his magazine. Cam
era Work, he published fine
photogravure prints of photo
graphers such as Edward
Steichen, F. Holland Day, Ger
trude Kasebier, Ann Brigman,
Heinrich Kuhn, Clarench White
and Paul Strand, names which
sound with rich interest in any sur
vey of the history of the medium.
If Stieglitz reclaimed photo
graphy as an art. there were, sub
sequently, many who would make
further reclamation, with a greater
emphasis on photographic
technique, and with a command of
the technique that offered the
richest comprehension of the sub
ject possible. The inspiration for
this reclamation was the Ameri
can photographer, Edward Wes
ton. who in the 1920s insisted
upon the overall definition of his
subject, and who investigated the
expressive possibilities of such
common objects as a bell pepper,
a shell and a toilet bowl.
Small apertures
The 112 64 group, formed in 1932,
included, among others, Weston,
Ansel Adams and Imogen Cun
ningham. Using large cameras,
an aperture not greater than 112 64,
and eschewing enlargement for a
while, they celebrated the West
ern landscape, or the fruits of it.

Pictorialism, by which was meant
the aping of softening, "artistic"
events in the photographic print,
was finished.
It is only comparatively recently,
and chiefly under the influence of
such photographers as Minor
White and Clarence John
Laughlin, that this excellence of
technique has been put to a less
specific use, one in which the sub
ject is not so much comprehended
in its totality as it is represented,
with a determinedly personal in
terpretation.
More recently, younger photo
graphers are investigating the
range of expressive possibilities
that lie outside a sophisticated
photographic technique as we
have known it: double exposure

open shutters, composite printing,
grainy prints (enlargements from
Minox-size film), are all
techniques currently being used in
a search for expressive content in
the photograph.
Despite its 137-year history,
one feels that photography is now
truly coming into its own. Our pre
sent growing comprehension of
the history of the medium, and the
unlimited possibilities offered by
camera work today, will produce
photographs that will be as amaz
ing to us as those of the mortar
between the bricks were to the
Parisian public of 1839.
