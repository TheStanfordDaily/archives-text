The poster says: "Peter Brown,
Photographs." It is a picture of a
truck rolling down a deserted
highway, underneath jagged
thunderhead clouds. Peter is
showing some of his photographs
in the Coffee House; this is his
advertisement.
Brown is the only photographer
at Stanford who is a candidate for
a Master of Fine Arts. He began
photography seriously less than
six years ago during a trip to Asia.
He said that photography first be

came a means of self-expression
when he noticed the subtle
balancing of shapes and forms
during a boat ride from Hong
Kong, and .. got fascinated by
what could be done with photo
graphy."
Brown, who has lived in New
York City, Oxford, England, Mas
sachusetts, and more recently,
Palo Alto, spent his under
graduate years immersed in the
English Honors program at Stan
ford. He graduated in 1971 with a
degree in English and spent two

years devoting much of his time,
as he puts it, . . learning about
myself, the way my mind works,
about my imagination."
Lost cameras
Brown's life has been a series of
chances and changes. He spent
his sophomore year in Tours,
where he traveled extensively and
managed to leave his camera on
top of a ski lift in Hochgurgl, Au
stria. "By the time I got to it, the
snow had totally ruined it."(The
first camera he ever owned he left
in a boot store on a trip to Mexico.)
Back at Stanford, he gave seri
ous thought to graduate work in
English, with an eventual teaching
job. Junior year culminated with
another trip to Europe, ostensibly

to work on an honors thesis.
Brown returned to Stanford to
become a graduate-at-large. with
specific interest in communication
and journalism. He just happened
to squeeze into an Art 70 class for
elementary photographers and
discovered that photography filled
an expressive void in his life. "I
didn't feel the compulsion to write;
I'd captured what I was after."
Travel and write
A year later, after having taken
intermediate and advanced clas
ses, Brown applied for a Master of
Fine Arts degree in photography.
He was accepted on the program
and is now in his first of two years
of work.
