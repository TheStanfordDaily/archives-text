The poster says: "Peter Brown,
Photographs." It is a picture of a
truck rolling down a deserted
highway, underneath jagged
thunderhead clouds. Peter is
showing some of his photographs
in the Coffee House; this is his
advertisement.
Brown is the only photographer
at Stanford who is a candidate for
a Master of Fine Arts. He began
photography seriously less than
six years ago during a trip to Asia.
He said that photography first be

came a means of self-expression
when he noticed the subtle
balancing of shapes and forms
during a boat ride from Hong
Kong, and .. got fascinated by
what could be done with photo
graphy."
Brown, who has lived in New
York City, Oxford, England, Mas
sachusetts, and more recently,
Palo Alto, spent his under
graduate years immersed in the
English Honors program at Stan
ford. He graduated in 1971 with a
degree in English and spent two

years devoting much of his time,
as he puts it, . . learning about
myself, the way my mind works,
about my imagination."
Lost cameras
Brown's life has been a series of
chances and changes. He spent
his sophomore year in Tours,
where he traveled extensively and
managed to leave his camera on
top of a ski lift in Hochgurgl, Au
stria. "By the time I got to it, the
snow had totally ruined it."(The
first camera he ever owned he left
in a boot store on a trip to Mexico.)
Back at Stanford, he gave seri
ous thought to graduate work in
English, with an eventual teaching
job. Junior year culminated with
another trip to Europe, ostensibly

to work on an honors thesis.
Brown returned to Stanford to
become a graduate-at-large. with
specific interest in communication
and journalism. He just happened
to squeeze into an Art 70 class for
elementary photographers and
discovered that photography filled
an expressive void in his life. "I
didn't feel the compulsion to write;
I'd captured what I was after."
Travel and write
A year later, after having taken
intermediate and advanced clas
ses, Brown applied for a Master of
Fine Arts degree in photography.
He was accepted on the program
and is now in his first of two years
of work.

What are the prospects for a
good photographer with a Master
of Fine Arts? Brown explains, "I
plan to try and get a traveling fel
lowship and maybe do a book.
Then I guess teach . . . that
doesn't really appeal to me."
Brown stresses the importance
of getting known. He has had his
photographs recognized by Popu
lar Photography, as well as won
third prize in a nation-wide con
test. "I'm not ready to cart my
portfolio around San Francisco
and see what people think about
it; I'm just not ready for that yet."
What makes Peter Brown's
photographs so effecitve? "I look
for moments in time. I try to put
myself in positions where things
are going to happen. But I don't
preconceive photographs. I go
back and take shots over if I feel
that I have missed the essence of
the scene."
His photos, most of which are
mounted and edged in a fine band
of black, are diverse in subject
matter. But all are polished, the
work of an expert.
As to why he left writing to focus
on photography, Brown says that,
"I ran into brick wall after brick wall
trying to get published. But then I
realized that the most important
part of my writing was visual.
"The most important part of

your work is rounding out the mid
dle class gap of ideas and experi
ences. In terms of photography,
there's a subtlety in life. You have
to find the dichotomy between this
subtlety and chaos," he adds.
Political interests led Brown to
take action on anti-war protests in
1971. He, along with his father, a
professor of theology at Stanford,
and several friends, marched
against the San Mateo draft
board. They were ignored. "But
when we did the same thing in

Berkeley," Brown commented,
"we were arrested and given na
tional coverage. We had the
choice of $500 or five days in
Santa Rita. We decided to go to
jail. It was one of the most educa
tional experiences in my life."
"There were no facilities for re
habilitation. The barracks were
segregated ... all they ever did
was sit around and play cards."
He considers the ideal life style
as one which combines art and
political activism.
