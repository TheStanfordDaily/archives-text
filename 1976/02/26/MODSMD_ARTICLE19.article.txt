# Shopping Bag: film and photos
## 
### Kevin Ohlson 
So Aunt Matilda wants a picture
of you in front of Mem Chu and
you've finally decided to send her
one. But where is the cheapest
place to buy film, or have it pro
cessed?
Perhaps you're considering Art
170 next quarter, or are already
taking it. Where is a good place to
purchase one of your most neces
sary supplies?
This survey covers film and
processing. Nine stores in the
area were appraised for color and
black-and-white films, as well as
color print and slide processing.
The prices listed are for Kodak
films and processing. While there
are many other brands which are
as good as Kodak it is still the
most readily available, and consi
dered by most the "standard of the
industry."
Color print and slide processing
is for Kodak's prepaid mailers. Vir
tually every camera store has an
alternate processing service,

usually done through an indepen
dent local lab. But color tones and
print quality can vary from lab to
lab.
Kodak, on the other hand, usu
ally offers the same professional
quality with its large color proces
sing plants throughout the coun
try.
If you are going to shoot a lot of
pictures, bulk film is the only way
to go. Price per roll drops to less
than 40 cents. Even if you include
the price of a bulk loader and
reusable film cassettes, the price
is cheaper than buying the pac
kaged product. Bulk film price for a
100-foot roll is included in the sur
vey. (Plus-X and Tri-X prices are
the same.)
Some retail outlets are notice
ably cheaper than others.
Schaefer's and Payless, for
example, seem to be the cheapest
overall. Besides film and proces
sing, Payless offers a limited line
of paper and darkroom acces
sories. Schaefer's is a full-fledged

So Aunt Matilda wants a picture
of you in front of Mem Chu and
you've finally decided to send her
one. But where is the cheapest
place to buy film, or have it pro
cessed?
Perhaps you're considering Art
170 next quarter, or are already
taking it. Where is a good place to
purchase one of your most neces
sary supplies?
This survey covers film and
processing. Nine stores in the
area were appraised for color and
black-and-white films, as well as
color print and slide processing.
The prices listed are for Kodak
films and processing. While there
are many other brands which are
as good as Kodak it is still the
most readily available, and consi
dered by most the "standard of the
industry."
Color print and slide processing
is for Kodak's prepaid mailers. Vir
tually every camera store has an
alternate processing service,

usually done through an indepen
dent local lab. But color tones and
print quality can vary from lab to
lab.
Kodak, on the other hand, usu
ally offers the same professional
quality with its large color proces
sing plants throughout the coun
try.
If you are going to shoot a lot of
pictures, bulk film is the only way
to go. Price per roll drops to less
than 40 cents. Even if you include
the price of a bulk loader and
reusable film cassettes, the price
is cheaper than buying the pac
kaged product. Bulk film price for a
100-foot roll is included in the sur
vey. (Plus-X and Tri-X prices are
the same.)
Some retail outlets are notice
ably cheaper than others.
Schaefer's and Payless, for
example, seem to be the cheapest
overall. Besides film and proces
sing, Payless offers a limited line
of paper and darkroom acces
sories. Schaefer's is a full-fledged

films and processing. While there
are many other brands which are
as good as Kodak it is still the
most readily available, and consi
dered by most the "standard of the
industry."
Color print and slide processing
is for Kodak's prepaid mailers. Vir
tually every camera store has an
alternate processing service,

usually done through an indepen
dent local lab. But color tones and
print quality can vary from lab to
lab.
Kodak, on the other hand, usu

quality with its large color proces
sing plants throughout the coun

If you are going to shoot a lot of
pictures, bulk film is the only way
to go. Price per roll drops to less
than 40 cents. Even if you include
the price of a bulk loader and
reusable film cassettes, the price
is cheaper than buying the pac
kaged product. Bulk film price for a
100-foot roll is included in the sur
vey. (Plus-X and Tri-X prices are
the same.)
Some retail outlets are notice

Schaefer's and Payless, for

overall. Besides film and proces
sing, Payless offers a limited line
of paper and darkroom acces
sories. Schaefer's is a full-fledged
