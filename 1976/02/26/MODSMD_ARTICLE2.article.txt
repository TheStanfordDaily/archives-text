## editorial Transit tax 
### 
On Tues., March 2, Santa Clara county voters will be
asked to approve a one-half percent sales tax increase to
fund the county Transit District.We reluctantly recommend a
on the measure.
The county's bus fleet is currently funded primarily by
contributions from the state. This money will not be availa
ble after June 30, 1977 unless the county matches state
contributions. Without state money, the bus system will die.
This should not happen. Bus service is important to Stan
ford. The bus system currently allows employes and stu
dents to get to campus without a car. It also aids in reduc
ing Stanford's parking and traffic problems.
If the tax is passed, additional routes in the Stanford-Palo
Alto area will be created, making the system much more
valuable to the community. These new routes are not ones
arbitrarily picked by officials in San Jose. They are, rather,
grid ' routes suggested by a task force headed by Assoc.
Industrial Engineering Prof. James Jucker which would
bring nearly every point in the Stanford area within one
quarter mile of a bus stop.
While for the most part, the proposed expenditures of the
Transit District seem wise, we are somewhat skeptical of
the county's plan to use some of the money to help build a
light rail (streetcar) system from Cupertino to the IBM plant
south of San Jose.
County officials privately admit that their proposal may
have drastically understated the cost of such a system, but
say that the system is necessary to win endorsements from
the powerful Sierra Club and Modern Transit Society.
We don't approve of the "something-for-everybody" poli
tics being practiced by the county. We do, however, believe
that thecounty transit systemis a good one and deserves to
be continued.
