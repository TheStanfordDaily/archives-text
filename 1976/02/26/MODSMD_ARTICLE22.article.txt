# Museum's expensive collection spans photographic history
## 
### Iris Krasnow 
You may be surprised to know
that the Leland Stanford Junior
Museum has a permanent collec
tion covering the entire range of
photographic history, from 1839 to
the present. There are approxi
mately 500 prints in a collection
which includes the work of the
world's finest photographers.
Every movement and change in
the medium of photography as a

creative expression are rep
resented.
Putting this assemblage to
gether is an expensive task. Con
temporary photographers such as
Oliver Gagliani and Jerry Ules
mann sell originals for $125-150.
Great masters such as Wynn Bul
lock, Ansel Adams and Edward
Weston have their originals on the
market in a range from $750-
2000.

Anita Mozley, curator of the
museum's photography collection
bargains in this price bracket four
or five times a year. Dealers visit
the museum from all over the
country to show their goods. Dr.
Lorenz Eitner, director of the
museum and Chairman of the Art
Department okays the buying.
The prints are purchased with the
museum's Acquisition Fund
raised by the Committee for Art at
Stanford. Occasionally, alumni
and photographers donate prints
to the collection. Stanford's Class
of '75 contributed three photo
graphs to the museum as a class
gift.
Began with Weston
There isn't an era in history that
Mozley hasn't uncovered for the
photography collection. "Wher
ever I go I look for photographs,"
she says. The collection began in
1971, to build on Eitner's purch
ase of some of Weston's work.
French, English, Italian, Scot
tish and American photographs
comprise the collection. There is a
19th century mammoth plate orig
inal by William Henry Jackson,
only a few of which are left today.
There are three portraits by Julian
Margaret Cameron, an English
photographer of the 1860-1870
era.
Another British master of that
age represented in the collection
is Roger Fenton. Hill and Adam
son, mid-19th century Scottish ar
tists have two originals in the col

lection. Karlton Watkins and Ead
weard Muybridge, masters of the
western landscape, round off the
major contributions of 19th cen
tury photographs owned by the
museum.
Important works of this century
include those of Eugene Atget,
known as the "photographer of
Paris" in 1900-1915. There are
two platinum plates done in 1912
by the grand dame of the art, Im
ogen Cunningham. The museum
also boasts a poignant portrait of
Cunningham taken by Leo Holub,
a Stanford photography instructor
and a close friend of Cunningham.
The museum's most recent
purchase was a Diane Arbus.


Anita Mozley
One of these masters was
launched to fame following
studies conducted here at Stan
ford. Leland Stanford Sr. wished
to prove that at one point in a run,
a horse has all four feet off the
ground simultaneously. His
curiosity cost him $40,000.
In 1878 Stanford hired Muyb
ridge to photograph a moving
horse. He shot sequential stills
that could be moved quickly in
front of a lens to resemble a mo
tion picture. It was proven that in
deed horses are airborne for a
split second when running and
Muybridge became famous for his
"Horse in Motion" series.
The Stanford Muybridge collec
tion toured the United States for
two years and recently received a
bid from museums in Germany.
"The Muybridge show could never
have taken place without Leo,''
Mozley says. Holub did some of
the printing for the exhibit from
Muybridge's original negatives.
Adams' birthday
Ansel Adams' 70th birthday
party could never have taken
place without Holub either. Stan
ford held an Adams exhibit in
celebration of the master's 70th
year in 1972. Following the show,
all of photography's "Who's Who"
held a bash at Holub's San Fran
cisco home. Only Stanford has a
photograph of Adams in motion,
snuffing out 70 candles in one
gust, snapped by Dave Lima.
Mozley has clear ideas for the
expansion of the collection. She'd
love an original by Dorothea
Lange, an American photo
grapher during the Depression.
She's looking for an August San
der original. Sander did a
sociological analysis of German

society in the 1920s with his cam
era. She foresees a Wynn Bullock
print for the collection. She is
keeping her eyes open for a large
landscape original by Adams. She
is always open to finding new
trends in unknown artists as well.
The historical future of the col
lection looks hopeful with Mozley
at the helm. "She is really a magi
cal lady," concludes Julie Ann
Kodmur, an art history student
who does volunteer work at the
museum. Mozley is still very much
the student herself, learning all the
time of photographers who should
have been famous, or soon will
be.

museum purchase fund.
You may be surprised to know
that the Leland Stanford Junior
Museum has a permanent collec
tion covering the entire range of
photographic history, from 1839 to
the present. There are approxi
mately 500 prints in a collection
which includes the work of the
world's finest photographers.
Every movement and change in
the medium of photography as a

creative expression are rep
resented.
Putting this assemblage to
gether is an expensive task. Con
temporary photographers such as
Oliver Gagliani and Jerry Ules
mann sell originals for $125-150.
Great masters such as Wynn Bul
lock, Ansel Adams and Edward
Weston have their originals on the
market in a range from $750-
2000.

Anita Mozley, curator of the
museum's photography collection
bargains in this price bracket four
or five times a year. Dealers visit
the museum from all over the
country to show their goods. Dr.
Lorenz Eitner, director of the
museum and Chairman of the Art
Department okays the buying.
The prints are purchased with the
museum's Acquisition Fund
raised by the Committee for Art at
Stanford. Occasionally, alumni
and photographers donate prints
to the collection. Stanford's Class
of '75 contributed three photo
graphs to the museum as a class
gift.
Began with Weston
There isn't an era in history that
Mozley hasn't uncovered for the
photography collection. "Wher
ever I go I look for photographs,"
she says. The collection began in
1971, to build on Eitner's purch
ase of some of Weston's work.
French, English, Italian, Scot
tish and American photographs
comprise the collection. There is a
19th century mammoth plate orig
inal by William Henry Jackson,
only a few of which are left today.
There are three portraits by Julian
Margaret Cameron, an English
photographer of the 1860-1870
era.
Another British master of that
age represented in the collection
is Roger Fenton. Hill and Adam
son, mid-19th century Scottish ar
tists have two originals in the col

lection. Karlton Watkins and Ead
weard Muybridge, masters of the
western landscape, round off the
major contributions of 19th cen
tury photographs owned by the
museum.
Important works of this century
include those of Eugene Atget,
known as the "photographer of
Paris" in 1900-1915. There are
two platinum plates done in 1912
by the grand dame of the art, Im
ogen Cunningham. The museum
also boasts a poignant portrait of
Cunningham taken by Leo Holub,
a Stanford photography instructor
and a close friend of Cunningham.
The museum's most recent
purchase was a Diane Arbus.


Anita Mozley
One of these masters was
launched to fame following
studies conducted here at Stan
ford. Leland Stanford Sr. wished
to prove that at one point in a run,
a horse has all four feet off the
ground simultaneously. His
curiosity cost him $40,000.
In 1878 Stanford hired Muyb
ridge to photograph a moving
horse. He shot sequential stills
that could be moved quickly in
front of a lens to resemble a mo
tion picture. It was proven that in
deed horses are airborne for a
split second when running and
Muybridge became famous for his
"Horse in Motion" series.
The Stanford Muybridge collec
tion toured the United States for
two years and recently received a
bid from museums in Germany.
"The Muybridge show could never
have taken place without Leo,''
Mozley says. Holub did some of
the printing for the exhibit from
Muybridge's original negatives.
Adams' birthday
Ansel Adams' 70th birthday
party could never have taken
place without Holub either. Stan
ford held an Adams exhibit in
celebration of the master's 70th
year in 1972. Following the show,
all of photography's "Who's Who"
held a bash at Holub's San Fran
cisco home. Only Stanford has a
photograph of Adams in motion,
snuffing out 70 candles in one
gust, snapped by Dave Lima.
Mozley has clear ideas for the
expansion of the collection. She'd
love an original by Dorothea
Lange, an American photo
grapher during the Depression.

Muybridge became famous for his
"Horse in Motion" series.
The Stanford Muybridge collec
tion toured the United States for
two years and recently received a
bid from museums in Germany.
"The Muybridge show could never
have taken place without Leo,''
Mozley says. Holub did some of
the printing for the exhibit from
Muybridge's original negatives.
Adams' birthday
Ansel Adams' 70th birthday
party could never have taken
place without Holub either. Stan
ford held an Adams exhibit in
celebration of the master's 70th
year in 1972. Following the show,
all of photography's "Who's Who"
held a bash at Holub's San Fran
cisco home. Only Stanford has a
photograph of Adams in motion,
snuffing out 70 candles in one
gust, snapped by Dave Lima.
Mozley has clear ideas for the
expansion of the collection. She'd
love an original by Dorothea
Lange, an American photo
grapher during the Depression.
She's looking for an August San
der original. Sander did a
sociological analysis of German

society in the 1920s with his cam
era. She foresees a Wynn Bullock
print for the collection. She is
keeping her eyes open for a large
landscape original by Adams. She
is always open to finding new
trends in unknown artists as well.
The historical future of the col
lection looks hopeful with Mozley
at the helm. "She is really a magi
cal lady," concludes Julie Ann
Kodmur, an art history student
who does volunteer work at the
museum. Mozley is still very much
the student herself, learning all the
time of photographers who should
have been famous, or soon will
be.

"Lady Mary Ruthew," c. 1845,
D.O. Hill and R. Adamson,
museum purchase fund.
You may be surprised to know
that the Leland Stanford Junior
Museum has a permanent collec
tion covering the entire range of
photographic history, from 1839 to
the present. There are approxi
mately 500 prints in a collection
which includes the work of the
world's finest photographers.
Every movement and change in
the medium of photography as a

creative expression are rep
resented.
Putting this assemblage to
gether is an expensive task. Con
temporary photographers such as
Oliver Gagliani and Jerry Ules
mann sell originals for $125-150.
Great masters such as Wynn Bul
lock, Ansel Adams and Edward
Weston have their originals on the
market in a range from $750-
2000.

Anita Mozley, curator of the
museum's photography collection
bargains in this price bracket four
or five times a year. Dealers visit
the museum from all over the
country to show their goods. Dr.
Lorenz Eitner, director of the
museum and Chairman of the Art
Department okays the buying.
The prints are purchased with the
museum's Acquisition Fund
raised by the Committee for Art at
Stanford. Occasionally, alumni
and photographers donate prints
to the collection. Stanford's Class
of '75 contributed three photo
graphs to the museum as a class
gift.
Began with Weston
There isn't an era in history that
Mozley hasn't uncovered for the
photography collection. "Wher
ever I go I look for photographs,"
she says. The collection began in
1971, to build on Eitner's purch
ase of some of Weston's work.
French, English, Italian, Scot
tish and American photographs
comprise the collection. There is a
19th century mammoth plate orig
inal by William Henry Jackson,
only a few of which are left today.
There are three portraits by Julian
Margaret Cameron, an English
photographer of the 1860-1870
era.
Another British master of that
age represented in the collection
is Roger Fenton. Hill and Adam
son, mid-19th century Scottish ar
tists have two originals in the col

lection. Karlton Watkins and Ead
weard Muybridge, masters of the
western landscape, round off the
major contributions of 19th cen
tury photographs owned by the
museum.
Important works of this century
include those of Eugene Atget,
known as the "photographer of
Paris" in 1900-1915. There are
two platinum plates done in 1912
by the grand dame of the art, Im
ogen Cunningham. The museum
also boasts a poignant portrait of
Cunningham taken by Leo Holub,
a Stanford photography instructor
and a close friend of Cunningham.
The museum's most recent
purchase was a Diane Arbus.

One of these masters was
launched to fame following
studies conducted here at Stan
ford. Leland Stanford Sr. wished
to prove that at one point in a run,
a horse has all four feet off the
ground simultaneously. His
curiosity cost him $40,000.
In 1878 Stanford hired Muyb
ridge to photograph a moving
horse. He shot sequential stills
that could be moved quickly in
front of a lens to resemble a mo
tion picture. It was proven that in
deed horses are airborne for a
split second when running and
Muybridge became famous for his
"Horse in Motion" series.
