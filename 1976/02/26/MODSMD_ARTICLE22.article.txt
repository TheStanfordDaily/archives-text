# Museum's expensive collection spans photographic history
## 
### Iris Krasnow 
You may be surprised to know
that the Leland Stanford Junior
Museum has a permanent collec
tion covering the entire range of
photographic history, from 1839 to
the present. There are approxi
mately 500 prints in a collection
which includes the work of the
world's finest photographers.
Every movement and change in
the medium of photography as a

creative expression are rep
resented.
Putting this assemblage to
gether is an expensive task. Con
temporary photographers such as
Oliver Gagliani and Jerry Ules
mann sell originals for $125-150.
Great masters such as Wynn Bul
lock, Ansel Adams and Edward
Weston have their originals on the
market in a range from $750-
2000.

Anita Mozley, curator of the
museum's photography collection
bargains in this price bracket four
or five times a year. Dealers visit
the museum from all over the
country to show their goods. Dr.
Lorenz Eitner, director of the
museum and Chairman of the Art
Department okays the buying.
The prints are purchased with the
museum's Acquisition Fund
raised by the Committee for Art at
Stanford. Occasionally, alumni
and photographers donate prints
to the collection. Stanford's Class
of '75 contributed three photo
graphs to the museum as a class
gift.
Began with Weston
There isn't an era in history that
Mozley hasn't uncovered for the
photography collection. "Wher
ever I go I look for photographs,"
she says. The collection began in
1971, to build on Eitner's purch
ase of some of Weston's work.
French, English, Italian, Scot
tish and American photographs
comprise the collection. There is a
19th century mammoth plate orig
inal by William Henry Jackson,
only a few of which are left today.
There are three portraits by Julian
Margaret Cameron, an English
photographer of the 1860-1870
era.
Another British master of that
age represented in the collection
is Roger Fenton. Hill and Adam
son, mid-19th century Scottish ar
tists have two originals in the col

lection. Karlton Watkins and Ead
weard Muybridge, masters of the
western landscape, round off the
major contributions of 19th cen
tury photographs owned by the
museum.
Important works of this century
include those of Eugene Atget,
known as the "photographer of
Paris" in 1900-1915. There are
two platinum plates done in 1912
by the grand dame of the art, Im
ogen Cunningham. The museum
also boasts a poignant portrait of
Cunningham taken by Leo Holub,
a Stanford photography instructor
and a close friend of Cunningham.
The museum's most recent
purchase was a Diane Arbus.
