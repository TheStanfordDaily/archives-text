Blood drive
I am writing to express my de
light over Stanford's recent chal
lenge to USC concerning the Red
Cross blood drive (Daily, Feb. 13).
I have been a regular blood
donor for several years and have
been concerned over the low level
of altruistic enthusiasm among
Stanford students. Perhaps their
rather unimpressive showing at
the Blood Center has been due in
part to an inadequate amount of
publicity.
Inconvenience has certainly
been a problem as well, for the
Blood Center is two miles away
and many students don't have
cars. Hopefully, the publicity that
has been afforded the Big Drive in
the Daily and other campus publi
cations, and the convenience af
forded by the new on-campus
bloodmobile, will lead many new
students to spend five minutes
donating blood to save the life of
another human being.

Lack of enthusiasm
The enthusiasm, or lack of it,
shown by the Stanford basketball
fans was quite noticeable last
week, when we were totally out
classed by the University of Ore
gon fans.

I believe it was a home game,
but one never would have gues
sed.
At least the team might feel we
are supporting them in some other
way other than just attending the
games. Say the cause of all our
turnovers is that the players have
to keep checking to see if we're
still there . ..
That may be ridiculous, but so is

6000 people sitting perfectly still
with possibly an occasional polite
applause for an entire 40 minutes
of basketball.
Hopefully we'll be hearing from
the fans this week . . . Let's hope
the fans will let the team know they
appreciate the past five months of
practicing. We try harder.
