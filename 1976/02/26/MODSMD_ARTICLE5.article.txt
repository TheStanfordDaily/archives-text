## Earth sciences' emeralds stolen 
### Dan Fiduccia 
An emerald mineral specimen
valued at $5000 was stolen from
the Mitchell Earth Sciences Build
ing, Asst. Geology Prof. Gordon
Brown confirmed yesterday.
The specimen was about three
inches in diameter and consisted
of six or seven emerald crystals
still imbedded in their original
rock. The specimen was taken
sometime between Jan. 16 and
Feb. 13, according to Brown.
Bradford Mills, a coterminal
student in geology and curator of
the mineral collection, said he
"happened to notice it was gone
on Friday the thirteenth."
Brown said the mineral collec
tion consists of about 65,000
specimens which are "strictly for
research in minerals and rocks."
Brown said he believes the

emerald specimen was the most
expensive one in the collection.
The emeralds, when removed
from the limestone, can then be
cut and polished, Brown said.
Brown said the collection "was
not publicized" but he believed
more than 50 people might have
known about the collection.
Mills and Brown said they did
not report the theft to police be
cause they left for a few days after
Feb. 13 and on returning began
searching the collection to see if
the emerald specimen had been
misplaced.
Brown added that "several
others were familiar with it (the col
lection) since it was of such par
ticular value."
Brown said only Earth Sci
ences Dean Richard Jahns, Stan
ford Police and Fire Departments
and he now have access to the
collection. Before the theft, some
faculty members and mainte
nance personnel had keys to the
collection, which is housed in one
room, he said.
Jahns confirmed that other new
security precautions had been put
into effect but did not elaborate.
Jahns said he felt "acute un
happiness" over the loss.
"As in any building there is a
substantial amount of traffic and
the news (of the specimens pre
sence) got out," Jahns said.
Jahns said he had been afraid
of losses from the collection for
many years because there was no
extraordinary security for undis
played specimens.

UP IN ARMS —For the past few weeks, Palo Alto residents have staged picket lines in front of the
Wells Fargo Bank on Hamiton Avenue, protesting rent increases in a bank-owned apartment buiding.
The bank spokesman insists that the increase was necessary. Residents insist that the increase is
designed to evict them, so that the bank might use the space for a parking lot.

Jahns said he had been afraid
of losses from the collection for
many years because there was no
extraordinary security for undis
played specimens.

UP IN ARMS —For the past few weeks, Palo Alto residents have staged picket lines in front of the
Wells Fargo Bank on Hamiton Avenue, protesting rent increases in a bank-owned apartment buiding.
The bank spokesman insists that the increase was necessary. Residents insist that the increase is
designed to evict them, so that the bank might use the space for a parking lot.
An emerald mineral specimen
valued at $5000 was stolen from
the Mitchell Earth Sciences Build
ing, Asst. Geology Prof. Gordon
Brown confirmed yesterday.
The specimen was about three
inches in diameter and consisted
of six or seven emerald crystals
still imbedded in their original
rock. The specimen was taken
sometime between Jan. 16 and
Feb. 13, according to Brown.
Bradford Mills, a coterminal
student in geology and curator of
the mineral collection, said he
"happened to notice it was gone
on Friday the thirteenth."
Brown said the mineral collec
tion consists of about 65,000
specimens which are "strictly for
research in minerals and rocks."
Brown said he believes the

emerald specimen was the most
expensive one in the collection.
The emeralds, when removed
from the limestone, can then be
cut and polished, Brown said.
Brown said the collection "was
not publicized" but he believed
more than 50 people might have
known about the collection.
Mills and Brown said they did
not report the theft to police be
cause they left for a few days after
Feb. 13 and on returning began
searching the collection to see if
the emerald specimen had been
misplaced.
Brown added that "several
others were familiar with it (the col
lection) since it was of such par
ticular value."
Brown said only Earth Sci
ences Dean Richard Jahns, Stan
ford Police and Fire Departments
and he now have access to the
collection. Before the theft, some
faculty members and mainte
nance personnel had keys to the
collection, which is housed in one
room, he said.
Jahns confirmed that other new
security precautions had been put
into effect but did not elaborate.
Jahns said he felt "acute un
happiness" over the loss.
"As in any building there is a
substantial amount of traffic and
the news (of the specimens pre
sence) got out," Jahns said.
Jahns said he had been afraid
of losses from the collection for
many years because there was no
extraordinary security for undis
played specimens.
