## Tenants picket bank 
### Blake Hallanan 
Palo Alto residents have been picketing the Wells
Fargo Bank on Hamilton Avenue for the past two
weeks, protesting recent rent increases at an
apartment complex owned by the bank, Palo Alto
Tenants Union member Bill Cane said Tuesday.
Cane said the rent increases were designed to
"force" the tenants, including two graduate students
herefrom their homes.
The students are Jerry Kuner and Elba Serrano,
both in biology.
The bank, Cane said, may want to use the apart
ment property, located next to the bank, for other
purposes, possibly a parking lot. Bank official Jack
Lopez said there are no immediate construction
plans for the apartment complex property, but admit
ted the bank might decide to build a parking lot there
"This entire episode began as a simple rent in

crease, and it has turned into something more vici
ous and underhanded," Lopez said. "It costs us
money to operate the complex, and we consider our
recent increase as a modest one, especially be
cause the rent has been stable for the past six
years."
Cane said the protesters would continue picketing
until the bank agrees to negotiate on the rent in
creases.
The protesters, he said, are asking bank custom
ers to close their accounts until the current conflict is
solved.
Cane estimated that at least 24 persons and three
or four community organizations, including Briar
patch Market in Menlo Park, have withdrawn their
accounts from the bank branch.
Lopez said he could neither confirm nor deny this.
