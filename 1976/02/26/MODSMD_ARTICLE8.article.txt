## Ford predicts victory over Reagan 
### 
CONCORD, N.H. (AP) â€” President Ford
said yesterday that from the springboard of
his narrow presidential primary victory
here, he can eliminate Ronald Reagan's
Republican challenge "if we win a couple
more, and I think we will."
But Reagan insisted that his close finish
was a victory, too. "No one has ever done
this to an incumbent," he said as he left to
resume his campaign for the March 16 pres
idential primary in Illinois. "I think it's great
and we'll go on from here."
It was Ford 51 percent, Reagan 49 per
cent, in the first of the presidential primary
elections Tuesday. It took all night to settle
the issue. Ford and Reagan meet next in
the Florida primary, on March 9.
New Hampshire Democrats completed
the conversion of former Georgia Gov.
Jimmy Carter from longshot to frontrunner

by choosing him over four rival contenders
in their primary. Carter received 30 percent
of the vote, finishing comfortably ahead of
Rep. Morris Udall of Arizona, and said that
he would win the Democratic presidential
nomination on the first ballot.
Long struggle
While Ford talked of locking up the Re
publican nomination with a few more prim
ary victories over Reagan, the prospect
after the narrow verdict here was for a long
struggle over the GOP nomination.
Unless Republican opinion elsewhere is
markedly different, the balance at the ballot
box is a close one, and neither man ap
pears likely to have an early shot at knock
ing the other from the race.
Senate Republican Whip Robert Griffin
said in Washington that Ford's New Hamp
shire victory gave him "important momen

turn in the upcoming primaries " He said
Reagan will have to win decisively in Florida
in order to stay in the race.
Not elected
Reagan and his allies have been trying
from the start to make a case for running
second, on grounds that even coming close
to an incumbent is a big political achieve
ment. But Ford holds his office by appoint
ment and succession, not by election. And
Reagan doesn't hesitate to point out, when
it serves his purposes, that he has electoral
experience rivaling Ford's, having won two
terms as governor of California by landslide
margins.
Presidential Press Secretary Ron Nes
sen said Ford will win next Tuesday in Mas
sachusetts, where Reagan's name is on the
ballot but he has no campaign organization;
in Vermont, where Ford is unopposed: and

on the following Tuesday in Florida.
With the vote count here nearing comple
tion, this was the Republican tally: Ford
54,824 or 51 percent. Reagan 53,507 or 49
percent.
Ford wins delegates
At the same time, Ford comfortably won
overwhelming control of the state's 21-
member delegation to the Republican Na
tional Convention.
With some races still in doubt, and likely
to remain so until the official canvass, dele
gates supporting the President for nomina
tion had 17 seats, Reagan four.
The popular vote primary has nothing to
do with the delegate selection balloting
Delegate candidates run in their own
names, and are listed on the ballot beneath
the name of the candidate to whom they are
pledged
