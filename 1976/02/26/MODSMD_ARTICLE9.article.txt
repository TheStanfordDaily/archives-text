# To discuss judicial plan
## ASSU presidents urge C-15 meeting 
### Bob Zuckerman 
The ASSU Council of Presi
dents is attempting to reconvene
the Committee of 15 (C-15), a
panel which is responsible for re
commending changes in the
campus judicial system.
ASSU Vice President Charlot
te Germane, a senior in art history,
said yesterday that 100 student
signatures have been collected
this quarter on a petition to recon
vene the committee. About 600
signatures are needed to recon
vene the committee, she said.
Germane said the ASSU Coun
cil of Presidentswants the commit
tee to reconvene to consider three
procedural changes in the cam
pus judicial system.
First, according to the petition,
the committee should reconvene
to consider calling on the ASSU
Nominations Committee to ap
point all student members to the

Student Conduct Legislative
Council (SCLC), a panel charged
with studying Honor Code reform.
'Costly, time-consuming'
Currently, SCLC student mem
bers must be picked in general
student elections. Germane cal
led these elections "costly and
time-consuming." She noted that
during fall quarter the ASSU held
a special election to elect SCLC
student members. ASSU Finan
cial Manager Chris Cline, a busi
ness school student, said that
election cost about $230.
Second, the petition asks that
the C-15 reconvene to consider
an amendment which would pro
vide for a student majority on the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC) in
all cases.
The SJC which began opera
tions this fall, hears cases involv
ing student violations of University
rules. The SJC has six voting

members — three students and
three faculty members. In addi
tion, there are two cochairmen: a
third-year law student who votes
to break ties in Honor Code cases
and a faculty member who votes
to break ties in all other cases.
Selection process
Third, the petition asks that the
C-15 reconvene to consider
changing the way chairmen and
members of the SJC are chosen.
Currently. 20 students are ran
domly chosen by computer from
registration lists for student SJC
positions. Next, the ASSU Nomi
nations Committee interviews the
20 students, and recommends
three to the ASSU Senate, which
makes the final choice.
Faculty members are selected
by the Faculty Senate's Commit
tee on Committees.
The chairmen are both ap
pointed by the University presi

dent after consultation with the
Law School dean.
Germane said she hopes the
C-15 will recommend equivalent
methods for selecting all SJC
members. She said present
methods allow faculty to "hand
pick" SJC faculty members.
"The faculty can determine the
political orientation of its (SJC)
members," she said, "but stu
dents can't determine the orienta
tion of their members."
Political systems
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons yesterday said, "I have no
response to that except to notice
that the faculty appointment sys
tem has a greater amount of stabil
ity and is less a political system
than the ASSU. which is, by defini
tion, political."
Lyons said the petition "sounds
to me like a campaign promise
made a long time ago that some
one at the last minute has decided
to do something about."
He said he is satisfied with the
way in which SCLC and SJC
members are chosen and with the
way both councils are operating
"I'm surprised they (ASSU Coun
cil of Presidents) want to change
the system when we haven't had a
full-year with the current effort."
Dismissal
Lyons noted that the SJC has
only heard one case this y«?ar. It
involved a student who was un
conditionally dismissed from the
University five years ago. The

council recommended that the
student be reinstated as he re
quested. The University is cur
rently considering the recommen
dation. Lyons said.
Lyons also noted that in the 10
honor code cases which have ari
sen this year, the students in
volved have asked him to hear the
case alone. Under the current jud
icial plan, alleged honor code vio
lators may choose to have their
cases heard by the dean of stu
dent affairs rather than the SJC.
Lyons also criticized the student
officers for bringing up a con
troversy which, he said, has al
ready been decided by students,
faculty and administration.
Last year, controversy eruptetf
when C-15 student members at
tempted to change the Campus
Judicial Panel, which used to hear
SJC cases. In a referendum last
April, students approved the SJC
by a slim margin (769 to 635) with
more than 1000 students opting
for "No Choice." Later, the Faculty
Senate and University President
Richard Lyman approved the
SJC.
When asked whether she
thought any new amendments to
the current SJC plan would ever
receive the necessary support
from the Faculty Senate and the
president, Germane said, "I think
it's doubtful, but it's important to
keep this issue in the people's
minds, so that it doesn't die out."

with studying Honor Code reform.
'Costly, time-consuming'
Currently, SCLC student mem
bers must be picked in general
student elections. Germane cal
led these elections "costly and
time-consuming." She noted that
during fall quarter the ASSU held
a special election to elect SCLC
student members. ASSU Finan
cial Manager Chris Cline, a busi
ness school student, said that
election cost about $230.
Second, the petition asks that
the C-15 reconvene to consider
an amendment which would pro
vide for a student majority on the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC) in
all cases.
The SJC which began opera
tions this fall, hears cases involv
ing student violations of University
rules. The SJC has six voting

members — three students and
three faculty members. In addi
tion, there are two cochairmen: a
third-year law student who votes
to break ties in Honor Code cases
and a faculty member who votes
to break ties in all other cases.
Selection process
Third, the petition asks that the
C-15 reconvene to consider
changing the way chairmen and
members of the SJC are chosen.
Currently. 20 students are ran
domly chosen by computer from
registration lists for student SJC
positions. Next, the ASSU Nomi
nations Committee interviews the
20 students, and recommends
three to the ASSU Senate, which
makes the final choice.
Faculty members are selected
by the Faculty Senate's Commit
tee on Committees.
The chairmen are both ap
pointed by the University presi

dent after consultation with the
Law School dean.
Germane said she hopes the
C-15 will recommend equivalent
methods for selecting all SJC
members. She said present
methods allow faculty to "hand
pick" SJC faculty members.
"The faculty can determine the
political orientation of its (SJC)
members," she said, "but stu
dents can't determine the orienta
tion of their members."
Political systems
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons yesterday said, "I have no
response to that except to notice
that the faculty appointment sys
tem has a greater amount of stabil
ity and is less a political system
than the ASSU. which is, by defini
tion, political."
Lyons said the petition "sounds
to me like a campaign promise
made a long time ago that some
one at the last minute has decided
to do something about."
He said he is satisfied with the
way in which SCLC and SJC
members are chosen and with the
way both councils are operating
"I'm surprised they (ASSU Coun
cil of Presidents) want to change
the system when we haven't had a
full-year with the current effort."
Dismissal
Lyons noted that the SJC has
only heard one case this y«?ar. It
involved a student who was un
conditionally dismissed from the
University five years ago. The

council recommended that the
student be reinstated as he re
quested. The University is cur
rently considering the recommen
dation. Lyons said.
Lyons also noted that in the 10
honor code cases which have ari
sen this year, the students in
volved have asked him to hear the
case alone. Under the current jud
icial plan, alleged honor code vio
lators may choose to have their
cases heard by the dean of stu
dent affairs rather than the SJC.
Lyons also criticized the student
officers for bringing up a con
troversy which, he said, has al
ready been decided by students,
faculty and administration.
Last year, controversy eruptetf
when C-15 student members at
tempted to change the Campus
Judicial Panel, which used to hear
SJC cases. In a referendum last
April, students approved the SJC
by a slim margin (769 to 635) with
more than 1000 students opting
for "No Choice." Later, the Faculty
Senate and University President
Richard Lyman approved the
SJC.
When asked whether she
thought any new amendments to
the current SJC plan would ever
receive the necessary support
from the Faculty Senate and the
president, Germane said, "I think
it's doubtful, but it's important to
keep this issue in the people's
minds, so that it doesn't die out."
The ASSU Council of Presi
dents is attempting to reconvene
the Committee of 15 (C-15), a
panel which is responsible for re
commending changes in the
campus judicial system.
ASSU Vice President Charlot
te Germane, a senior in art history,
said yesterday that 100 student
signatures have been collected
this quarter on a petition to recon
vene the committee. About 600
signatures are needed to recon
vene the committee, she said.
Germane said the ASSU Coun
cil of Presidentswants the commit
tee to reconvene to consider three
procedural changes in the cam
pus judicial system.
First, according to the petition,
the committee should reconvene
to consider calling on the ASSU
Nominations Committee to ap
point all student members to the

Student Conduct Legislative
Council (SCLC), a panel charged
with studying Honor Code reform.

to break ties in Honor Code cases
and a faculty member who votes
to break ties in all other cases.
Selection process
Third, the petition asks that the
C-15 reconvene to consider
changing the way chairmen and
members of the SJC are chosen.
Currently. 20 students are ran
domly chosen by computer from
registration lists for student SJC
positions. Next, the ASSU Nomi
nations Committee interviews the
20 students, and recommends
three to the ASSU Senate, which
makes the final choice.
Faculty members are selected
by the Faculty Senate's Commit
tee on Committees.
The chairmen are both ap
pointed by the University presi

dent after consultation with the
Law School dean.
Germane said she hopes the
C-15 will recommend equivalent
methods for selecting all SJC
members. She said present
methods allow faculty to "hand
pick" SJC faculty members.
"The faculty can determine the
political orientation of its (SJC)
members," she said, "but stu
dents can't determine the orienta
tion of their members."
Political systems
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons yesterday said, "I have no
response to that except to notice
that the faculty appointment sys
tem has a greater amount of stabil
ity and is less a political system
than the ASSU. which is, by defini
tion, political."
Lyons said the petition "sounds
to me like a campaign promise
made a long time ago that some
one at the last minute has decided
to do something about."
He said he is satisfied with the
way in which SCLC and SJC
members are chosen and with the
way both councils are operating
"I'm surprised they (ASSU Coun
cil of Presidents) want to change
the system when we haven't had a
full-year with the current effort."
Dismissal
Lyons noted that the SJC has
only heard one case this y«?ar. It
involved a student who was un
conditionally dismissed from the
University five years ago. The

council recommended that the
student be reinstated as he re
quested. The University is cur
rently considering the recommen
dation. Lyons said.
Lyons also noted that in the 10
honor code cases which have ari
sen this year, the students in
volved have asked him to hear the
case alone. Under the current jud
icial plan, alleged honor code vio
lators may choose to have their
cases heard by the dean of stu
dent affairs rather than the SJC.
Lyons also criticized the student
officers for bringing up a con
troversy which, he said, has al
ready been decided by students,
faculty and administration.
Last year, controversy eruptetf
when C-15 student members at
tempted to change the Campus
Judicial Panel, which used to hear
SJC cases. In a referendum last
April, students approved the SJC
by a slim margin (769 to 635) with
more than 1000 students opting
for "No Choice." Later, the Faculty
Senate and University President
Richard Lyman approved the
SJC.
When asked whether she
thought any new amendments to
the current SJC plan would ever
receive the necessary support
from the Faculty Senate and the
president, Germane said, "I think
it's doubtful, but it's important to
keep this issue in the people's
minds, so that it doesn't die out."
The ASSU Council of Presi
dents is attempting to reconvene
the Committee of 15 (C-15), a
panel which is responsible for re
commending changes in the
campus judicial system.
ASSU Vice President Charlot
te Germane, a senior in art history,
said yesterday that 100 student
signatures have been collected
this quarter on a petition to recon
vene the committee. About 600
signatures are needed to recon
vene the committee, she said.
Germane said the ASSU Coun
cil of Presidentswants the commit
tee to reconvene to consider three
procedural changes in the cam
pus judicial system.
First, according to the petition,
the committee should reconvene
to consider calling on the ASSU
Nominations Committee to ap
point all student members to the

Student Conduct Legislative
Council (SCLC), a panel charged
with studying Honor Code reform.
'Costly, time-consuming'
Currently, SCLC student mem
bers must be picked in general
student elections. Germane cal
led these elections "costly and
time-consuming." She noted that
during fall quarter the ASSU held
a special election to elect SCLC
student members. ASSU Finan
cial Manager Chris Cline, a busi
ness school student, said that
election cost about $230.
Second, the petition asks that
the C-15 reconvene to consider
an amendment which would pro
vide for a student majority on the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC) in
all cases.
The SJC which began opera
tions this fall, hears cases involv
ing student violations of University
rules. The SJC has six voting

members — three students and
three faculty members. In addi
tion, there are two cochairmen: a
third-year law student who votes
to break ties in Honor Code cases
and a faculty member who votes
to break ties in all other cases.
