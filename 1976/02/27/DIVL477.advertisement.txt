I NEED A WOME"
Yukon King? No. Rin TinTin? Hardly. Snoopy? Sometimes., but listen folks,
IT'S ISAAC! and he needs help. After a successful career as faithful hound and
loveable lap dog, Isaac is now ignominously up for adoption and gobble this:
Isaac is a gen u ine Rhodesian Ridgeback, a breed first plucked from native
Africa by Errol Flynn to serve as guard dog and conversation piece. Wouldn't
it be exotic to have a lion hunter (they originally were bred for lion hunting but
Isaac will balk from a kitten) in your very own home?
If Born Free tugged at your heart strings, Isaac's story will tear you to
pieces. Born to my sister (she was hand maiden, not progenitor) six years ago
was a litter of Ridgeback pups. All were promptly sold off except one â€” yes,
Isaac... I couldn't partwithhim. He has real oaf appeal.
For many years Isaac has been this woman's best friend. We have romped
together through the wilds of El Camino and in the hallowed halls of Stanford
U. But other, more pressing dreams tore our affair asunder. I, like Cruella
Devil have moved to "The City" and can't possibly keep Isaac.
Alas! I am forced to appeal to you. Please. Someone who loves dogs (Isaac is
fickle and loves everyone including new born babes) come over and meet
Isaac. If anyone chooses, we could work out a foster parent situation where I
pay board and then have him back after a specific time, or not at all if the new
owner so chooses. Ain't it a dog's life?
