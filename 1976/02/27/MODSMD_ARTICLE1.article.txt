### Ron Sege 
Next Tuesday, University students
who have registered to vote in Palo
Alto will have the opportunity to cast
their ballot 112 or a new board member on
the Palo Alto Unified School District
(FAUSD) Governing Hoard.
The vacancy on the board is a result
of the resignation of Ted Vian last Au
gust. Vian had served for three years,
and still had two more years left on his
term. The remaining board members
appointed Palo Alto stockbroker James
Steele after Vian's resignation to serve
until the next general election, when
the law provides that Steele must be
elected to the board.
Steele is being challenged by Joseph
Sirnitian, a Berkeley law student. Si ru
ffian supports a school board that is
"accountable and responsive to the
community."
Simitian said he feels that "the
neighborhood school is the focal point
of our educational community." When
asked if this meant that In: was op
posed to the current wave of elemen
tary school closures, he says that
"there are some economies that can be
made that don't mean school closure."
Specifically he was referring to ways
to economize such as principal shar
ing, kindergarten through eighth
grade schools, and community ser
vices or private industry occupying
empty classroom space.
Provide alternatives
Simitian says that the district should
"continue to provide educational al
ternatives for students who learn best
in an alternative environment." The
reason for this,he says,is that"we have
the interest and the ability to provide
alternative programs for students

whose parents feel that they need or
want their children in that alternative
type of environment." The alternate
programs that he is referring to are
special learning situations being
tested at Hoover and Oh lone elemen
tary schools.
With regard to the PAUSD merger
being contemplated, Simitian says,"I
was opposed, and still am opposed to
the proposed merger of the PAIJSD
with the five South San Mateo dis
tricts."
Steele hesitant
The incumbent, Steele, was hesitant
to discuss his platform.
"I do have a candidate's statement
and a complete biographical sketch on
myself that I would be very happy to
supply you with," he said.
"Our district must prepare students
on a rapidly changing world. We must
assure that students attain proficiency
in the three 'r's, as well as to develop
understanding and respect for others.
Our board must be open and sensitive
to all community inputs," Steele's
statement said.
Steele is presently tin; manager of
Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, I'enner and
Smith, Inc. in Palo Alto. His school
board activities include serving on the
district's advisory committees on bus
iness education and superintendent
selection. He presently has three chil
dren in Palo Alto schools.
Simitian is a second year law stu
dent at Berkeley. His district activities
include being a member of the Re
source Group on School Reorganiza
tion and Glosure, and the Advisory
Committee on Information Services.
He is a 1970 graduate of Palto Alto
High School.

with the five South San Mateo dis
tricts."
Steele hesitant
The incumbent, Steele, was hesitant
to discuss his platform.
"I do have a candidate's statement
and a complete biographical sketch on
myself that I would be very happy to
supply you with," he said.
"Our district must prepare students
on a rapidly changing world. We must
assure that students attain proficiency
in the three 'r's, as well as to develop
understanding and respect for others.
Our board must be open and sensitive
to all community inputs," Steele's
statement said.
Steele is presently tin; manager of
Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, I'enner and
Smith, Inc. in Palo Alto. His school
board activities include serving on the
district's advisory committees on bus
iness education and superintendent
selection. He presently has three chil
dren in Palo Alto schools.
Simitian is a second year law stu
dent at Berkeley. His district activities
include being a member of the Re
source Group on School Reorganiza
tion and Glosure, and the Advisory
Committee on Information Services.
He is a 1970 graduate of Palto Alto
High School.
Next Tuesday, University students
who have registered to vote in Palo
Alto will have the opportunity to cast
their ballot 112 or a new board member on
the Palo Alto Unified School District
(FAUSD) Governing Hoard.
The vacancy on the board is a result
of the resignation of Ted Vian last Au
gust. Vian had served for three years,
and still had two more years left on his
term. The remaining board members
appointed Palo Alto stockbroker James
Steele after Vian's resignation to serve
until the next general election, when
the law provides that Steele must be
elected to the board.
Steele is being challenged by Joseph
Sirnitian, a Berkeley law student. Si ru
ffian supports a school board that is
"accountable and responsive to the
community."
Simitian said he feels that "the
neighborhood school is the focal point
of our educational community." When
asked if this meant that In: was op
posed to the current wave of elemen
tary school closures, he says that
"there are some economies that can be
made that don't mean school closure."
Specifically he was referring to ways
to economize such as principal shar
ing, kindergarten through eighth
grade schools, and community ser
vices or private industry occupying
empty classroom space.
Provide alternatives
Simitian says that the district should
"continue to provide educational al
ternatives for students who learn best
in an alternative environment." The
reason for this,he says,is that"we have
the interest and the ability to provide
alternative programs for students

whose parents feel that they need or
want their children in that alternative
type of environment." The alternate
programs that he is referring to are
special learning situations being
tested at Hoover and Oh lone elemen
tary schools.
With regard to the PAUSD merger
being contemplated, Simitian says,"I
was opposed, and still am opposed to
the proposed merger of the PAIJSD
with the five South San Mateo dis
tricts."
