# Cleaver adopts 'American dream'
## 
### 
If we peer deep enough through the
smoke belched from the stogies of unctuous
politicians and vicious profiteers we will
see two Americas. Eldridge Cleaver, now in
an Oakland jail, calls attention to the
"America of the American dream" and the
"America of the American nightmare."
The dream was "that all Men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their
Creator with certain unalienable Rights,
that among these are Life, Liberty, and the
Pursuit of Happiness." Throughout our
lives we have pledged aloud our allegiance
to this dream "with liberty and justice for
all." The Declaration of Independence, the
Constitution, the Bill of Rights are the re
positories of the dream.
The nightmare was slavery, the rape of
the native American, the Depression, Viet
nam, Watergate. We are asked to tacitly
pledge allegiance to Lockheed profits and
payoffs, to Castro's attempted assassination,
to seven percent unemployment, to segrega
tion in the Boston schools. Racism, exploi
tation, corruption, violence, repression, J.
Edgar Hoover, Nixon, Reagan, Wallace are
all part of the nightmare.
In my discussions with him, Cleaver is
quick to point out that the America of the
dream need have nothing to do with the
America of the nightmare, and that some
how we must separate the two.
Super-patriot
He interprets the Watergate affair, the end
of the Vietnam war, the exposure of the FBI
and the CIA, the feminist movement as mak
ing a crucial start in divorcing "the true
interests of the people from the machina
tions of the imperialists and politicians."
Calling himself a "super-patriot" of the
America of the dream, Cleaver has come
home to aid in this segregation.
After seven years away from America,
Cleaver now believes that, while their oper
ation should be "vastly improved," "all the
basic featuresof our democratic institutions
need to be conserved." It is these institu-

tions which, despite the incubus lying atop
them, have provided us with "the freest and
most democratic political system in the
world," he says.
As Cleaver hints, the above judgment
springs from his new found sense of relativ
ity and balance. Comparisons loom large as
of late in his thinking.
"Americans need only look around" at

other systems to see that they have some
thing precious: the most highly developed
democracy in the world, he continues. "The
structural form of individual liberty en
joyed by the American citizen is greater
than that of any other country."
Legerdemain
For those embarrassed or indignant at
reading such an evaluation rendered by the
same man who in 1970 said that "the U.S. as
it exists today has to be totally obliterated
and has to be rebuilt and restructured," 1
should report that Cleaver, with probably a
slight bit of legerdemain, now draws a dis
tinction between "political democracy"
and "economic democracy."
Political democracy Cleaver defines as "a
system in which the sovereignty lies with
the people. Officials are selected and
elected through a machinery that allows the
citizens to bring their will to bear on the
choices." Economic democracy translates
as economic security. Of the two, Cleaver
believes political democracy the more im
portant, but I have my doubts that this rank
ing should apply in all situations.
Granting that communist countries sur-

pass the United States in degree of
economic democracy, Cleaver finds them
lacking almost completely in political
democracy.
The United States, while also needing to
expand its political democracy, needs to
drastically increase its economic democ
racy. In seeking the proper balance, Cleaver
says we should recognize the "compatibil
ity of American political institutions with
many different economic systems." The
profits of Culf Oil have nothing to do with
the Bill of Rights.
American socialism
Cleaver talks of a distinctly American
type of socialism â€” what Huey Newton
used to call the "Yankee Doodle Dandy"
variety. Toward that goal, Cleaver urges
the radical left to use a "patriotic gambit."
By failing to realize the worth of the
America of the dream,by trampling upon its
symbols, radicals have alienated them
selves from the mass majority of American
people. Operating with what Cleaver de
scribes as a "fifth column mentality," radi
cals have abandoned patriotism and its
mass appeal to the distortions and corrup
tions of the reactionaries. "Why should we
have allowed Nixon to wrap himself up in
the flag?" Cleaver asks. It is time to take it
back.
As a symbol of our determination to sepa
rate ourselves from the America of the
nightmare, Cleaver suggests we make a
"bicentennial pledge to elminate violence
from our lives over the next century."
That is a remarkable shift for someone
previously prepared to "fight a revoluto
nary struggle for the violent overthrow of
the U.S. government." Yet this shift, along
with others, has served to clear smoke from
Cleaver's thought. The Cleaver of the dream
is distinguishing himself from the Cleaver
of the nightmare.
