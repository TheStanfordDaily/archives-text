COSS coverage
I would like to thank the Daily
for the fine reporting it did on
the Committee on Services to
Students (COSS) debate con
cerning placement center non
discrimination policies.
The articles were unbiased
and factually accurate, and the
committee members were cor
rectly quoted â€” all in sharp con
trast to my past experiences with
Daily coverage.
My special thanks go to repor
ter Lori Matsukawa for her
superb coverage and to the
editors for the job they have done

to revitalize both the format and
the quality of reporting and, after
two or three years of disap
pointment, again make the Daily
an impressive college news
paper.

Yea for Jimmy
I am both surprised and elated
with the results from New
Hampshire. Jimmy Carter has
managed to do well in both the

cities and the countryside, re
flecting what we believe to be his
appeal to all segments of the
Democratic party.
However there is still a long
road ahead. Innumerable pitfalls
await each candidate, and the
competition should remain
tough throughout the campaign.
The performance of Rep. Mor
ris Udall (D-Ariz.) should not be
underrated. He is intelligent, in
novative and very witty. His or
ganization both here on campus
and around the nation is very
strong, and this factor should
begin to demonstrate itself in

state primaries with a more
urban populace.
Sen. Birch Bayh (D-Ind.), a late
starter in this primary, should
not be eliminated as a main con
tender. Attractive, personal and
progressive, he should begin to
pick up momentum once his or
ganization becomes more sol
idified.
As for the campaigns here on
campus, the Stanford Democ
rats' Club has offered to sponsor
a series of mini-debates around
the campus. This would feature
student representatives of the
various candidates and would be
held in 14 different dorms
around campus, plus a final de
bate in Cubberley three weeks
before the June 8 California
primary.
These debates would thus en
sure all Stanford students the
chance to become acquainted
with, and active in, the cam
paigns.

Stick to issues
Herbert Schwartz's Feb. 2
Daily letter missed the point.
The issue is not whether
motorcycle helmets should be
worn. I support the use of hel
mets, too. and I wear one.
But it's illogical to compare
helmet laws with gun laws
(which I strongly support). The
gun user usually harms others;
the motorcycle rider harms him
self.
A better comparison is a seat
belt law. requiring all car drivers
and riders to wear them.
The only rationale for a helmet
law that may be valid is the rest
of us may end up supporting
those disabled from not wearing
helmets. But let's stick to the is
sues. instead of discussing gun
laws, cigarette smoking (would
Schwartz outlaw cigarettes?)
and the Democratic party.

New acronym
K-Mart should be selected as
the official acronym of the Law
School's Kresge Auditorium.
K-Mart fulfills all the traditional
requirements of Stanford ac
ronyms, being brief, snappy and
historically relevant.
S.S. Kresge founded the
Kresge Corp., which opened
high volume, low margin retail
outlets across the country. These
K-Mart stores returned enorm
ous profits, some of which were
donated to build the auditorium.
The Daily's readers should be
aware of this most recent addi
tion to the glorious list of ac
ronyms.
