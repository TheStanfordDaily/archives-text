The time has come to reconsider criteria used in
Stanford's tenure decisions — not only is the im
portance of teaching overlooked, but these criteria
also seem to contradict the University's stated
goals for residential education.
The administration has prided itself on the
quality of Stanford's residential education prog
ram, asserting that Stanford's undergraduate re
sidences offer variety and academic challenge.
Although there has been a serious housing shor
tage, which is being slowly alleviated, the idea
has persisted in University echelons that resi
dences offer an educational experience worth the
rising cost of Stanford's tuition.
It is true University residences play an impor
tant part in undergraduates' lives — approxi
mately three quarters of the 6500 undergraduates
here currently live on campus.
Thus, Asst. Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Michael Closson's statement in the Feb. 19
Thursday article on tenure that "service to the
University community in general ... is given lit
tle if any weight in tenure deliberations" is espe
cially distressing in light of the University's sup
posed commitment to quality in undergraduate
residences.
At another point in the article, reference is
made to a junior faculty member told not to accept
a resident fellow position but to concentrate on
his research. The implication is that tenure is
granted to those with the most prestigious re
search credentials.
The question must be asked, "How can the uni
versity continue to stress its commitment to qual

ity in undergraduate residences while ignoring
service to residential education when tenure de
cisions are made?"
Last year's job description for student residence
staff positions stated: "It is the policy of Stan
ford's residential education program to foster as
much as possible an active intellectual vitality as
well as a community atmosphere in the student
residences; the responsibility for the execution of
this policy rests squarely on the shoulders of the
student residence staff and the Resident Fellows
and Directors."
Yet, if junior faculty are discouraged from par
ticipating as resident fellows in order to spend
more time on research, the responsibility for en
couraging intellectual vitality may fall too heavily
on the student staff.
In addition, junior faculty may be less disposed
to spend time advising undergraduates in resi
dences or in offering meaningful seminars, given
pressures to concentrate on research.
Perhaps the University is not so committed to
residential education as it would like students to
believe. The term residential education connotes
a certain amount of interaction between faculty
and students within the residences.
One can only hope that future tenure decisions
wi 11 give some consideration to service to residen
tial education — if not, Stanford's form of residen
tial education may become just another housing
system.
