# S.1 threats must be opposed

An article in the Feb. 23 Daily
about the anti-S.l rally that took
place Feb. 20 quoted me as say
ing. "All of the draft board de
monstrations . . . would have
been felonies" under S.l.
Though that assertion is correct I
said nothing about draft boards.
Were my opposition to S.l
based merely on the few pages
among the bill's 753 which ne
gate first amendment rights I
would not mind the misquota
tion. S.l's repressive measures
however go far beyond theTealm
of free speech and peaceable as
sembly.
To cite a few examples, S.l
equates many now-legal types of
labor organizing with "extor
tion," sets a minimum penalty
for possession of the slightest
amount of marijuana (first of
fense) at 30 days imprisonment
and/or $10,000 fine, imposes
strict mimimum sentences for
many other offenses.
It broadens government pow
ers of domestic surveillance and
wiretapping, legalizes police en
trapment, renders admissible in
court any confessions gained in
secret police interrogations both
in the absence of counsel and
without police self
identification and sets Victorian
obscenity levels with federal law
enforcement permissible against
even the most trivial local trans
actions.
S.l also enables "public ser
vants" (i.e. future Watergaters)
to escape prosecution for illegal
acts by claiming even a "mista
ken" belief that their actions!
were "required or authorized"
from above and allows govern
ment officials to suppress virtu
ally any information which they
choose either to classify or to
claim is related to a vaguely de
fined "national defense."
Whether one views the Crimi
nal Justice Reform Act of 1975
(S.l, H.R. 3907) as another
episode in a long history of U.S.
governmental repression or
simply as the residue of Nixon
and Watergate, it is instantly ap
parent that the bill must be stop
ped.
So filled with unconstitu
tional features is S.l that no feas
ible number of amendments
could make it acceptable. No
thing less than a complete
redrafting could change the fact
that S.l threatens every Ameri
can regardless of his/her politi
cal views.
Write letters to senators and
congresspeople, circulate peti
tions, participate in demonstra
tions and strikes or do anything
else that will express your un
equivocal opposition to S.l.

based merely on the few pages
among the bill's 753 which ne
gate first amendment rights I
would not mind the misquota
tion. S.l's repressive measures
however go far beyond theTealm
of free speech and peaceable as
sembly.
To cite a few examples, S.l
equates many now-legal types of
labor organizing with "extor
tion," sets a minimum penalty
for possession of the slightest
amount of marijuana (first of
fense) at 30 days imprisonment
and/or $10,000 fine, imposes
strict mimimum sentences for
many other offenses.
It broadens government pow
ers of domestic surveillance and
wiretapping, legalizes police en
trapment, renders admissible in
court any confessions gained in
secret police interrogations both
in the absence of counsel and
without police self
identification and sets Victorian
obscenity levels with federal law
enforcement permissible against
even the most trivial local trans
actions.
S.l also enables "public ser
vants" (i.e. future Watergaters)
to escape prosecution for illegal
acts by claiming even a "mista
ken" belief that their actions!
were "required or authorized"
from above and allows govern
ment officials to suppress virtu
ally any information which they
choose either to classify or to
claim is related to a vaguely de
fined "national defense."
Whether one views the Crimi
nal Justice Reform Act of 1975
(S.l, H.R. 3907) as another
episode in a long history of U.S.
governmental repression or
simply as the residue of Nixon
and Watergate, it is instantly ap
parent that the bill must be stop
ped.
So filled with unconstitu
tional features is S.l that no feas
ible number of amendments
could make it acceptable. No
thing less than a complete
redrafting could change the fact
that S.l threatens every Ameri
can regardless of his/her politi
cal views.
Write letters to senators and
congresspeople, circulate peti
tions, participate in demonstra
tions and strikes or do anything
else that will express your un
equivocal opposition to S.l.

An article in the Feb. 23 Daily
about the anti-S.l rally that took
place Feb. 20 quoted me as say
ing. "All of the draft board de
monstrations . . . would have
been felonies" under S.l.
Though that assertion is correct I
said nothing about draft boards.
Were my opposition to S.l
