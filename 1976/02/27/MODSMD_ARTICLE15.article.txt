## Does GPA inflation hurt grads? Grades lower, but 3.55 myth lingers

3.55. When that figure was published last
year as the average grade given at Stanford, it
caused a furor among administrators and stu
dents.
National magazines picked it up as evidence
grading at college is nothing more than a joke.
And despite the fact that subsequent studies
greatly revised that figure — not to mention
that professors seem to have decided to lower
their grading, as evidenced by last quarter's
statistics — 3.55 is still thoughi by many to be
the average grade at Stanford.
Within the past several months, theNutionui
Review, Newsweek and Time have run articles
or opinions columns citing that figure.
Likewise, the people one meets from the East
invariably seem to feel 3.55 is the average
grade here.
Statistics Prof. Bradley Efron derived the
3.55 figure last year in a semi-random study of
100 students' grades. 1 le conducted the survey
in his role as chairman of the ad hoc panel on
grading.
However, Efron admits "he hadn't worried
much about definitions" of grades at the time
of the study. He says the study was mainly for
internal use and he didn't intend it to be com
prehensive.
"There were a lot of things that were far from
ideal," he said.
Methodology was faulty
The grades considered in Efron's study were
all grades on a student's grade sheet. These
grades were calculated on a straight A. Band C
scale.
Pluses and minuses were not taken into ac
count — a fact that probably distorted the fi
gures. as a later report found twice as many
minuses given as pluses.
Following Efron's study, the Registrar's Of
fice did a more comprehensive study of grades,
including all the grades given in 1973-74. This
study found 3.41 the average grade awarded.
However, the registrar's study again did not
include pluses and minuses. One might sur
mise the difference between Efron's and the
registrar's study could be due to the fact that
Efron included all grades, whereas the Regis
trar's Office evidently only included academic
scores.
The third study done last year came up with
an entirely different figure. Bonny Roddenand
Jeffrey Stoler, students in Statistics 60, con
ducted a semi-random survey of each student's
grades.
The Rodden-Stoler study calculated the av
erage grade point average (GPA) of under
graduates, not the average grade given to un
dergraduates as the previous studies had cal
culated. Their study found a significant differ
ence between the registrar's calculations and
those they did.
Their calculation, according to the regis

trar's method, of the average grade given was
3.42 — approximately the same figure as the
registrar's . which indicates their data was rep
resentative. The average GPA of under
graduates was only 3.31, according to Rodden
and Stoler.
The reason for the lower figure was attri
buted to the fact students taking heavier loads
were those getting the higher CPAs. When
Rodden and Stoler regressed GPA versus units
taken, they confirmed this hypothesis.
All of this leads to the really important ques
tion: What's the present GPA for under
graduates?
Apparently no one has studied that so far
this year, although the Registrar's Officeonce
again has calculated the average grades
awarded.
The percentage o f "A"s given dropped by five
percent in the School ot Humanities and Sci
ences, and as much as 16 percent in the School
of Earth Sciences. Oth»*r grades changed
little, with the exception ot one or two percent
"D"s.
Are profs getting tougher?
Whether the decrease in "A"s awarded was
due to the reinstitution of or be
cause of profcaSui iiil tJifui u. to giade stricter is
not known.
The effect of grade inflation on business hir
ing is not known, according to an employe of
the Career Planning and Placement Center.
However, she did comment that no interviewer
has commented to her about grade inflation,
even though she deals with them on a daily
basis.

Law Prof. William Baxter said at a forum for
prospective law students that because of grade
inflation GPAs are no longer used per se in the
admissions process. He said CPAs are now
only used to indicate one's percentile ranking
in his class, a figure which is then placed into
the Law Quotient Index, to rank applicants.
Are grades worthless?
Student reaction to grade inflation has been
mixed.
According to Collette Lieber, a sophomore
who transferred last year from Johns Hopkins
University, "The'A'here doesn't mean any
thing. If an'A'is given to 30 percent of one's
class, it isn't special."
She said at Hopkins many classes only
awarded "A"s to 10 percent of the students.
However, Dave Judelson said he thought
"teachers have tried to cut back on grade infla
tion. They are making an effort to keep the
grades down — and in technical classes, this
especially seems to be true."
Donald Black, another transfer student, in
dicated Stanford is much more competitive
than the school from which he transferred. He
said he now has to do considerably more work
to earn an "A."
But as one student stated: "The distribution
of grades given really doesn't matter for those
going to professional schools since the schools
will adjust the grades anyway. For those going
directly to a job, having a high grade average
can be either a help or hindrance, depending
upon whether the employer feels Stanford
grades are skewed towards the' A.' "
