# New Hampshire vote adds to electoral enigma
## 
### Bruce Kadden 
New Hampshire normally seems to most
Americans like an obscure place. Half of the
Californians probably don't know the state's
capital; it's a good bet that not even one in 10
Stanford students can name its U.S. senators.
Mut all eyes were focused on the small New
England state earlier this week as its voters
endorsed President Gerald Ford and former
Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter in the first of 31
primary elections.
Ford's slim victory and Carter's impressive
victory answered some important questions for
political observers, although they did little to
indicate who would wind up with the presi
dential nominations at Kansas City, the Demo
cratic convention site, and Miami Beach, the
Republican locale.
Former California Gov. Ronald Reagan's
51-19 percentage point loss to Ford indicates
that the challenger poses a serious threat to the
non-elected incumbent.
But Reagan will have to do more than come
close to pick up enough momentum to win the
crucial California primary in June.
Specifically, the former movie star will have
to be a big hit in Florida's March 9 vote if he is
to take advantage of his purported strength
south of the Mason-Dixon line.
Illinois contest looms large
Ford should easily win next Tuesday's Mas
sachusetts balloting; here his opponent is
listed as a candidate but has not campaigned.
The President's real test will be on March 16 in
Illinois, where Reagan headed directly after
leaving New Hampshire.
If Reagan does not do well in Illinois, and it
becomes apparent that the Ford supporters'

claim that New Hampshire is the challenger's
best northern state is true, March 16 will be the
beginning of the end of Reagan's political
career.
Carter's victory with 30 percent of the vote,
definitively established him as the Democratic
frontrunner, an enviable but difficult position
;it this point in the presidential election game.
His plurality proved that his knack of garner
ing delegates in states without primaries could

be carried over to states with primaries.
Just as significant as Carter's poll was the
strong showing of Rep. Morris Udall of
Arizona, who with 24 percent of the votes
emeged as the leading liberal candidate. Carter
is considered a moderate by some observers
and a conservative by others.
Udall leads liberal pack
Udall's support is particularly impressive,
considering that the other three listed Democ
rats: Indiana Sen. Birch Bayh (16 percent),
former Oklahoma Cov. Fred Harris(ll percent)
and 1972 vice presidential candidate Sargent
Shriver (9 percent), areall classified as liberals.
Bayh will have to challenge Udall for the
supremacy of the left if he expects to stay in the
race until summer. Harris is probably nearing
the end of the line, while Shriver has one last
chance to pull off a miracle in Massachusetts,
where his relationship to the Kennedys could
have a significant influence.
If Carter can win the Southern governors'
showdown in Florida, there may be no topping
him. Wallace, who garnered two percent as a
write in Tuesday, needs to take that state if he is
to have a strong influence at the convention.
New Hampshire in perspective
Cood reasons exist, however, to take the New
Hampshire primary results with a grain of salt.
The balloting was only a preference poll and
therefore non-binding. At the same time the
voters were indicating they were split between
Ford and Reagan, they supported 17 of 21 con
vention delegates pledged to the President.
And while Carter only received 30 percent of
the popular ballots, he emerged with 13 of 17
delegates.
Secondly, there are relatively so few voters

in the state that the candidates and their sup
porters could contact each resident a number
oftimes. Carterand Udall have been campaign
ing in the state for more than a year. Reagan
also spent a large amount of time in New
Hampshire.
In the Democratic contest, the survival of the
fittest will end up fighting it out in Kansas City.
While Carter continues to appear impressive,
the slightest mistake could make him the Ed
mund Muskie of 1976.
But if his campaign continues to run as
smooth as his Southern style, the Democrats
will have one peach of a candidate this year.

strong showing of Rep. Morris Udall of
Arizona, who with 24 percent of the votes
emeged as the leading liberal candidate. Carter
is considered a moderate by some observers
and a conservative by others.
Udall leads liberal pack
Udall's support is particularly impressive,
considering that the other three listed Democ
rats: Indiana Sen. Birch Bayh (16 percent),
former Oklahoma Cov. Fred Harris(ll percent)
and 1972 vice presidential candidate Sargent
Shriver (9 percent), areall classified as liberals.
Bayh will have to challenge Udall for the
supremacy of the left if he expects to stay in the
race until summer. Harris is probably nearing
the end of the line, while Shriver has one last
chance to pull off a miracle in Massachusetts,
where his relationship to the Kennedys could
have a significant influence.
If Carter can win the Southern governors'
showdown in Florida, there may be no topping
him. Wallace, who garnered two percent as a
write in Tuesday, needs to take that state if he is
to have a strong influence at the convention.
New Hampshire in perspective
Cood reasons exist, however, to take the New
Hampshire primary results with a grain of salt.
The balloting was only a preference poll and
therefore non-binding. At the same time the
voters were indicating they were split between
Ford and Reagan, they supported 17 of 21 con
vention delegates pledged to the President.
And while Carter only received 30 percent of
the popular ballots, he emerged with 13 of 17
delegates.
Secondly, there are relatively so few voters

in the state that the candidates and their sup
porters could contact each resident a number
oftimes. Carterand Udall have been campaign
ing in the state for more than a year. Reagan
also spent a large amount of time in New
Hampshire.
In the Democratic contest, the survival of the
fittest will end up fighting it out in Kansas City.
While Carter continues to appear impressive,
the slightest mistake could make him the Ed
mund Muskie of 1976.
But if his campaign continues to run as
smooth as his Southern style, the Democrats
will have one peach of a candidate this year.

New Hampshire normally seems to most
Americans like an obscure place. Half of the
Californians probably don't know the state's
capital; it's a good bet that not even one in 10
Stanford students can name its U.S. senators.
Mut all eyes were focused on the small New
England state earlier this week as its voters
endorsed President Gerald Ford and former
Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter in the first of 31
primary elections.
Ford's slim victory and Carter's impressive
victory answered some important questions for
political observers, although they did little to
indicate who would wind up with the presi
dential nominations at Kansas City, the Demo
cratic convention site, and Miami Beach, the
Republican locale.
Former California Gov. Ronald Reagan's
51-19 percentage point loss to Ford indicates
that the challenger poses a serious threat to the
non-elected incumbent.
But Reagan will have to do more than come
close to pick up enough momentum to win the
crucial California primary in June.
Specifically, the former movie star will have
to be a big hit in Florida's March 9 vote if he is
to take advantage of his purported strength
south of the Mason-Dixon line.
Illinois contest looms large
Ford should easily win next Tuesday's Mas
sachusetts balloting; here his opponent is
listed as a candidate but has not campaigned.
The President's real test will be on March 16 in
Illinois, where Reagan headed directly after
leaving New Hampshire.
If Reagan does not do well in Illinois, and it
becomes apparent that the Ford supporters'

claim that New Hampshire is the challenger's
best northern state is true, March 16 will be the
beginning of the end of Reagan's political
career.
Carter's victory with 30 percent of the vote,
definitively established him as the Democratic
frontrunner, an enviable but difficult position
;it this point in the presidential election game.
His plurality proved that his knack of garner
ing delegates in states without primaries could

be carried over to states with primaries.
Just as significant as Carter's poll was the
strong showing of Rep. Morris Udall of
Arizona, who with 24 percent of the votes
