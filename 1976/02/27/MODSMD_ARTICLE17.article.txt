# Senate Bill One protest is limited
## 
### Mike Bailey 
A month ago, Cubberley Auditorium over
flowed with students wanting to hear big
names of the radical left blast the Establish
ment. Marxist philosopher Herbert Marcuse
urged students to stem "the growing tide of
fascism." Former Chicago Seven defendant
David Dellinger warned that if Senate Bill One
was passed "it would be all over" for free
speech.
But last Friday, scarcely 100 individuals fil
tered into Cubberley to attend an educational
forum on S.l. About 150 attended a rally in
White Plaza to protest the measure.
Cary Thorne, an Alliance for Radical Change
(ARC) member, acknowledged that neither

turn-out was large by the standards of political
rallies of the late '60s and early '70s. But he
contended that the protesters represented a
"different kind of activism" in which no one
encompassing issue, like the Vietnam war,
thataffects everyone could inspirea broad base
of support.
Thorne and other ARC members said they
were satisfied with student response. Thorne
noted that a "lot who came to the rally skepti
cal were by the end pretty enthusiastic."
Pointing out that Frank Williamson, speaker
for the anti-S.l forum, is a moderate, Thorne
asserted that the apparent apathy of most stu
dents toward S.l is more a problem of lack of
information than lack of interest.

He suggested that S.l has the potential of
hecomi ng an "encompassing issue" that might
spark widespread protest if it were passed and
implemented.
Unconstitutional measure?
Opponents of the measure argue that the bill
would decimate First Amendment freedoms
by forbidding newspapers to publish national
defense information, reaffirming presidential
authority to conduct wiretaps and curbing the
rights of demonstrators.
They also contend that the 753-page mea
sure contains numerous other provisions that
would convert First Amendment rights into
felonies.
More than a dozen campus groups have
joined the Bay Area Coalition Against S.l, but

their aggregate membership is not large. Al
though the groups opposing the bill are politi
cally diverse, ranging from the Spartacus
Youth League to libertarians, most groups op
posing the bill represent the extremes of the
political spectrum.
Issue is still fuzzy
Nothing probably deters more students from
participating in opposition to S.l than the fuz
ziness of the issue.
Not even those most active in opposing the
measure seem to know exactly what S.l is. No
one expects that it could pass through the Se
nate without numerous amendments. But for
the present, S.l is in limbo in the Senate
Judiciary Committee, and no one knows
exactly what form the final measure will take.
Uncompromising opposition to the bill is
based on the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) argument that it is inherently un
amendable.
But few have the time or the expertise to read
all 753 pages of S.l to verify for themselves that
it is a hopeless case.
Law Prof. Gerald Gunther stressed that S.l
"does not lend itself to a simple adjective." He
suggested that a panel discussion of lawyers
who had studied the bill might be an approp
riate way to approach the issue.
He called the ACLU stand a "vast over
simplification" and condemned the "slap
dash campaign" against S.l as "irresponsi
ble."
Is apathy justified?
Political Science Prof. Robert Horn also
questioned uncritical acceptance of the ACLU
stand, remarking half-facetiously that "the
ACLU says a lot of crazy things." Horn said that
student apathy is "well justified in the cir
cumstances."
In effect, student opposition to S.l some
times seems founded more upon general sus
picion of the establishment than analysis of the
bill. The role that John Mitchell, Richard
Kleindienst and Richard Nixon played in its
drafting is enough in itself to set many against
it.
Gunther pointed out that many of the worst
features of the bill were written under Lyndon
Johnson and that "to call it the Nixon-Mitchell
bill" is a "key propaganda ploy."
But the fate of the bill is so uncertain at this
stage that the "Nixon's legacy" approach
seems to be the best banner around which op
ponents of S.l can rally their cause.
That the response to this rallying call has
been so weak perhaps reveals a deference of
most students to the Establishment. The pro
tests may have been ill-timed, because most
students seem not sufficiently suspicious to be
alarmed over what Congress might do.

Gunther pointed out that many of the worst
features of the bill were written under Lyndon
Johnson and that "to call it the Nixon-Mitchell
bill" is a "key propaganda ploy."
But the fate of the bill is so uncertain at this
stage that the "Nixon's legacy" approach
seems to be the best banner around which op
ponents of S.l can rally their cause.
That the response to this rallying call has
been so weak perhaps reveals a deference of
most students to the Establishment. The pro
tests may have been ill-timed, because most
students seem not sufficiently suspicious to be
alarmed over what Congress might do.

deeply concerned about the S.l issue, so op
position to the measure does not seem to
foreshadow a return of student activism.
A month ago, Cubberley Auditorium over
flowed with students wanting to hear big
names of the radical left blast the Establish
ment. Marxist philosopher Herbert Marcuse
urged students to stem "the growing tide of
fascism." Former Chicago Seven defendant
David Dellinger warned that if Senate Bill One
was passed "it would be all over" for free
speech.
But last Friday, scarcely 100 individuals fil
tered into Cubberley to attend an educational
forum on S.l. About 150 attended a rally in
White Plaza to protest the measure.
Cary Thorne, an Alliance for Radical Change
(ARC) member, acknowledged that neither

turn-out was large by the standards of political
rallies of the late '60s and early '70s. But he
contended that the protesters represented a
"different kind of activism" in which no one
encompassing issue, like the Vietnam war,
thataffects everyone could inspirea broad base
of support.
Thorne and other ARC members said they
were satisfied with student response. Thorne
noted that a "lot who came to the rally skepti
cal were by the end pretty enthusiastic."
Pointing out that Frank Williamson, speaker
for the anti-S.l forum, is a moderate, Thorne
asserted that the apparent apathy of most stu
dents toward S.l is more a problem of lack of
information than lack of interest.

He suggested that S.l has the potential of
hecomi ng an "encompassing issue" that might
spark widespread protest if it were passed and
implemented.
Unconstitutional measure?
Opponents of the measure argue that the bill
would decimate First Amendment freedoms
by forbidding newspapers to publish national
defense information, reaffirming presidential
authority to conduct wiretaps and curbing the
rights of demonstrators.
They also contend that the 753-page mea
sure contains numerous other provisions that
would convert First Amendment rights into
felonies.
More than a dozen campus groups have
joined the Bay Area Coalition Against S.l, but

their aggregate membership is not large. Al
though the groups opposing the bill are politi
cally diverse, ranging from the Spartacus
Youth League to libertarians, most groups op
posing the bill represent the extremes of the
political spectrum.
Issue is still fuzzy
Nothing probably deters more students from
participating in opposition to S.l than the fuz
ziness of the issue.
Not even those most active in opposing the
measure seem to know exactly what S.l is. No
one expects that it could pass through the Se
nate without numerous amendments. But for
the present, S.l is in limbo in the Senate
Judiciary Committee, and no one knows
exactly what form the final measure will take.
Uncompromising opposition to the bill is
based on the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) argument that it is inherently un
amendable.
But few have the time or the expertise to read
all 753 pages of S.l to verify for themselves that
it is a hopeless case.
Law Prof. Gerald Gunther stressed that S.l
"does not lend itself to a simple adjective." He
suggested that a panel discussion of lawyers
who had studied the bill might be an approp
riate way to approach the issue.
He called the ACLU stand a "vast over
simplification" and condemned the "slap
dash campaign" against S.l as "irresponsi
ble."
Is apathy justified?
Political Science Prof. Robert Horn also
questioned uncritical acceptance of the ACLU
stand, remarking half-facetiously that "the
ACLU says a lot of crazy things." Horn said that
student apathy is "well justified in the cir
cumstances."
In effect, student opposition to S.l some
times seems founded more upon general sus
picion of the establishment than analysis of the
bill. The role that John Mitchell, Richard
Kleindienst and Richard Nixon played in its
drafting is enough in itself to set many against
it.

But few have the time or the expertise to read
all 753 pages of S.l to verify for themselves that
it is a hopeless case.
Law Prof. Gerald Gunther stressed that S.l
"does not lend itself to a simple adjective." He
suggested that a panel discussion of lawyers
who had studied the bill might be an approp
riate way to approach the issue.
He called the ACLU stand a "vast over
simplification" and condemned the "slap
dash campaign" against S.l as "irresponsi
ble."
Is apathy justified?
Political Science Prof. Robert Horn also
questioned uncritical acceptance of the ACLU
stand, remarking half-facetiously that "the
ACLU says a lot of crazy things." Horn said that
student apathy is "well justified in the cir
cumstances."
In effect, student opposition to S.l some
times seems founded more upon general sus
picion of the establishment than analysis of the
bill. The role that John Mitchell, Richard
Kleindienst and Richard Nixon played in its
drafting is enough in itself to set many against
it.
Gunther pointed out that many of the worst
features of the bill were written under Lyndon
Johnson and that "to call it the Nixon-Mitchell
bill" is a "key propaganda ploy."
But the fate of the bill is so uncertain at this
stage that the "Nixon's legacy" approach
seems to be the best banner around which op
ponents of S.l can rally their cause.
That the response to this rallying call has
been so weak perhaps reveals a deference of
most students to the Establishment. The pro
tests may have been ill-timed, because most
students seem not sufficiently suspicious to be
alarmed over what Congress might do.

deeply concerned about the S.l issue, so op
position to the measure does not seem to
foreshadow a return of student activism.
