### 
STOCKHOLM. Sweden (AP)
— A special government com
mittee proposed yesterday that
sexual intercourse be permitted
here as early as age 14 and that
the old prohibition against in
cest be abolished.
The committee also suggested
that the word "homosexual" be
banned from legislation dealing
with sex and that homosexuals
be treated in the same manner as
heterosexuals.
Seven experts in medicine,
sexual research and law were in
cluded in the committee, headed
by Malmoe chief appeals justice
Bjoern Kjellin.
In recommending lowering
the permissible age for sex rela
tions from 15 to 14, they cited
freer and more tolerant attitudes
toward sex in today's society.
"The proposal is also based on
the fact that the age of puberty is

lower than before and that
youths today in practice may
make their sexual debut before
15 years of age without this
hardly ever leading to police in
vestigation, legal action or sen
tence," the committee stated.
An exception would be in rela
tions between an adult and a
young man or girl under his or
her care. A sexual relationship in
such cases would not be allowed
under the age of 18 in order to
protect children from being used
by people upon whom they are
dependent.
Prohibitions against incest —
sex between brother and sister or
child and parent — should be
abolished, the committee said,
and incestuous relations should
be treated li ke any other sex acts.
The age limits of 14 and 18 and
protection for dependents
would apply in cases of incest.
