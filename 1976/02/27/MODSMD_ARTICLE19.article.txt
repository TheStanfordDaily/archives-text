## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Un
able to find a use for the ClA's
inultimillion dollar Glomar
Explorer, the government yes
terday asked private industry to
submit bids to lease the spy ship
for up to three years.
But executives for two of the
three corporations that govern
ment officials hoped might
submit bids expressed no in
terest in the sophisticated vessel,
which was used by the CIA to
recover part of a Russian sub
marine from the bottom of the
Pacific Ocean.
One industry executive has
said the government would be
willing to lease the Glomar for
$30,000 a day.
The General Services Ad
ministration (GSA), custodian of
the 618-foot ship, suggested that
private industry might use it for
"deep sea mining, salvaging,
pipelaying and under-sea dril
ling."
A GSA spokesman said the
government would place an ad
vertisement Friday in the Wall
Street Journal saying: "For
lease, HughesGlomar Explorer."
The ship was built with gov
ernment funds under a secret a
greement between the CIA and a
corporation controlled by there

clusive billionaire Howard
Hughes.
After the CIA was through
with it, the government tried un
successfully to find another fed
eral agency that might use it, the
spokesman said.
The spokesman described the
ship's "sophisticated automatic
station-keeping system" which
keeps it in one spot on the mov
ing sea.
He also described its 14-
million pound capacity hoisting
system, capable of raising and
lowering equipment more than
17,000 feet.
Any successful bidder would
get a two-year lease with a one
year renewal option,the spokes
man said.
"It's a white elephant that just
attracts attention," an executive
for International Nickel Co. said
of the ship.
"The possibilities of leasing
the Glomar are quite minimal,"
said an executive for Deepsea
Ventures, a Tenneco Inc., sub
sidiary.
Marne Dubs, head of Ken
necott Copper Inc.,'s deep-sea
mining division, was the only
executive queried by a reporter
who seemed interested in the
Glomar.
