# Survey to appraise Honor Code
## 
### Becky Trounson 
Karly next quarter, the Student Con
duct Legislative Council (SCLC) vviil
he mailing out questionnaires to Uni
versity students to determine their
feelings on the Honor Code.
The council, whose sole purpose is
to review the code, was formed last
quarter after a request for such a coun
cil was made by President Lyman and
the ASSU Council of Presidents.
The SCLC consists of five faculty
members and five students, three of
whom are elected and who are ex
officiomembers. James Lyons, dean of
student affairs, is also an ex-officio
member but has no vote.
"I'm impressed with the tremend
ous amount of work that is going into
this questionnaire," said elected stu
dent member Cregg Densmore. "It's
really difficult to write a questionnaire
that will find out people's attitudes on
an issue as sensitive as cheating is.
Emotions are always tense on that sub
ject."
Densmoreadded t hat he "can't think
of anything that would work better at
Stanford" than the Honor Code.
Math Prof. Paul Berg, chairman
of the SCLC, agreed and said
"Is there really any better scheme?"
"I like the flexibility of the Honor
Code," said Cathy Wittrock, another

elected student member of the SCLC.
"I don't know how effective the code
is, but I like the idea of the administra
tion respecting the students' integ
rity."
She added, though, that if the deci
sion is made to keep the Honor Code,
changes should be made in it. "It's re
al ly a hard thing for students to report
violations. In the questionnaire, one of
the things we want to do is to find out if
students think that there can be some
thing between an Honor Code and
proctoring. I think that there is."
When asked whether the Honor
Code is still valid. Berg said, "I've al
ways acted as if it were, but I know t hat
some professors don't. I think that stu
dents have a valid point when they
complain of 'vigilante justice' from
professors who don't observe the
code."
Prevalence of cheating
Asked about the prevalence of cheat
ing here, Densmore said, "I don't think
that cheating is common here."
Berg, however, said, "We have to ac
cept that there has always been some
cheating at Stanford. But students here
don't go back to their dorms and boast
about it, the way ihey do at some
schools."
The attitude of the students toward
cheating is really the most important

part of the code, Berg emphasized.
"The attitude that cheating is not tol
erated here is very important," he said.
Proctoring considered
Proctoring has been considered as
an alternative to the Honor Code hut
most SCI.C members seem to view it
unfavorably. "I would be very sorry to
see proctoring return," Wittrock said.
"As far as I'm concerned, a return to
proctoring would continue a trend to
ward retrogressive conservatism ;it
Stanford."
Berg feels that active student par
ticipation in the Honor Code makes it
as effective as proctoring. "I believe
that students participating in uphold
ing the I lonor Code, by letting the per
son know that he is observed while
cheating, makes it at least as effective
as proctoring would be," he said.
More effective
To make the Honor Code effective,
students must report violations they
observe, he added. "The students have;
to take it upon themselves to report
violations. An Honor Code without
student responsibility has no mean
ing."
When asked about the severity of the
punishment for cheating, Berg said
that punishments here do not seem
to be generally known. "The typical
punishment for one instance of cheat
ing is suspension for one quarter," he
said.
Several members of the SCLC com
mented on the flexibility of the code in
this area. "As far as I'm concerned, 1
think you have to look at each case of
cheating individually, and I'm glad
the code allows for that," Densmore
said.
Berg's feeling about the relative ef
fectiveness of the Honor Code and of
proctoring are borne out by the results

of a survey concerning academic dis
honesty which was conducted by Col
umbia University in 1961. The survey,
which was carried out at schools all
over the United States and included
some students here, showed that the
incidence of cheating at institutions
which used the Honor Code was sig
nificantly less than at those which
used proctoring.
However, Berg said, "Times have
changed and until we get the results of
our survey, we can't tell whether that's
true anymore."
