I am well aware of the problems of inflation, overhead and all the
other evils that plague today's good establishments. But why on
earth must the Stanford Coffeehouse charge 40 cents for a
pickle?-S.P.L.
The Coffeehouse is using a tricky economic gadget that even the
University doesn't understand. It's called overpricing. According
to Heidi Gross, a worker there, the Coffeehouse wants to sell only
sandwiches in the sandwich line. Consequently, the place sells
pickles at "outrageous" prices to discourage their purchase.
Strangely enough. University policy works just the other way
around. Only several months ago, Robert Summers (manager of
faculty of staft housing) declared that if the emeritus housing units
didn t sell that the University would have to raise their prices.
That's something to think about.

One of the pieces of propaganda distributed during "Celebration,"
claimed that the new law school building was temperature
controlled for "maximum year-round comfort." What a joke! The
only comfort I've ever experienced in the law library is relaxed
sleep in the 80-85 degree heat. I realize that the library might be
expensive to heat in the winter, but it does seem that it could at
least stay cool in the middle of February. Otherwise, what the hell's
going to happen in August?-L.S.
Alter talking to various library employes, our perceptive staff
realized that your complaint is far from the first (or last). In fact the
temperature of the law library is undoubtedly the central issue
occupying the teeming, seething minds of Stanford's would-be
lawyers.
And Plant Services is desperately working on the problem.
Utilities Manager Bob McKnight described the library as a"tomb"
with very few windows and tremendous lighting, which was un
fortunately designed before the energy crunch. As a result, keeping
it on the University cycling system (in which fans around the
campus go on and off at different times) is simply not enough.
Because of this, the library went off the cycling system yesterday.
From now on, air will be circulated from 6 a.m. to 12 midnight,
which should bring the library down to the required 78 degrees. In
the summer it will be air-conditioned â€” at a cost of over $1000 per
day.
