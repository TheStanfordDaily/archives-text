# 'Conspiracy' lowers food prices
## Escondido co-op aids shoppers 
### Loie Sauer 
In these times of increasing
grocery bills, one way to save
money is to leave out the mid
dleman and buy your food
wholesale. Members of the Es
condido Village Food Conspi
racy, a cooperative venture, do
just that.
Through collective buying
and distribution, co-op members
save 30-40 percent on food costs.
The overall markup for the aver
age order is around 10 percent,
according to co-op figures.
Members can buy fresh pro
duce, dry goods, dairy products
and breads through the coopera
tive. Organically grown produce
is bought if it is available, and
members receive the produce
the same day it is bought.
Labor
In return, each household in
the co-op is required to give 4 to
5 hours of labor per month. Work
tasks include cutting cheese,
packaging dry goods, boxing or
ders and working with the com
puter.
The Escondido Village co-op
and four other neighborhood
based co-ops (College Terrace,
Lifestream Friendly, Barron Park
and Stanford Campus) collec
tively make up the Sangha Food
Co-op.
Each week members give their
orders to a co-op representative
who tallies each item and sends
the totals to Sangha. Orders from
the five organizations are com
bined.
Separte orders
Sangha's buyer makes the
purchases and the large order is
broken down into the five

neighborhood orders. Each
co-op divides the food into
separate orders and members
pick them up every Thursday af
ternoon.
Malcom Goggin, a member of
the Escondido co-op, says the
co-op is an example of a "leader
less, non-bureaucratic system
that is working."
The system operates on divi
sion of labor, not power, he said.
There is a co-op steering com
mittee consisting of job team

leaders which discusses operat
ing processes of the co-op.
Any membrr can call a meet
ing of ihe entire co-op and deci
sions are made collectively by all
co-op members.
Margarine
A current discussion, for
example, is what kind of mar
garine- to buy, considering both
expense and saturated fat con
tent.
Goggin said that some co-op

members joined because "it's a
good deal financially." Others
are more involved in the spirit of
the cooperative as a community
and as an alternative to super
market shopping, he said.
Sangha member Michael
Stone says that federations of
small co-ops provide "the
economic power to implement
buying policies consistent with
humane values and an ecologi
cal consciousness."
The Escondido co-op has run
very smoothly, Goggin said.
"Occasionally people don't
show up to work, and a few jobs
are hard to fill."
Spirit
At times the co-op spirit isn't
what it could be, he said. "The
new members don't have the
same pioneering experience as
the people who started the
co-op. They see it from a
different perspective.
"They're not as inclined to
pitch in if somebody is sick and
the job has to get done," he ad
ded.
The Escondido Conspiracy,
organized in January 1975, cur
rently has around 40 members
and has openings for about 10
more households. At the begin
ning of the year the co-op was
full and had to turn away poten
tial members.
"Some members have
moved," Goggin said. "For
others who didn't buy much
through the co-op it wasn't
worthwhile to put in the four
hours of labor every month. We
haven't gotten many new mem
bers simply because people ha
ven't heard about it."

The Escondido Conspiracy,

through the co-op it wasn't

HARD LABOR?—While food co-ops like the Escondido Village
Conspiracy offer lower prices through volume buying, co-op
members must often put in some work. Here, one member sorts
groceries, bought in bulk, into individual bundles.
In these times of increasing
grocery bills, one way to save
money is to leave out the mid
dleman and buy your food
wholesale. Members of the Es
condido Village Food Conspi
racy, a cooperative venture, do
just that.
Through collective buying
and distribution, co-op members
save 30-40 percent on food costs.
The overall markup for the aver
age order is around 10 percent,
according to co-op figures.
Members can buy fresh pro
duce, dry goods, dairy products
and breads through the coopera
tive. Organically grown produce
is bought if it is available, and
members receive the produce
the same day it is bought.
Labor
In return, each household in
the co-op is required to give 4 to
5 hours of labor per month. Work
tasks include cutting cheese,
packaging dry goods, boxing or
ders and working with the com
puter.
The Escondido Village co-op
and four other neighborhood
based co-ops (College Terrace,
Lifestream Friendly, Barron Park
and Stanford Campus) collec
tively make up the Sangha Food
Co-op.
Each week members give their
orders to a co-op representative
who tallies each item and sends
the totals to Sangha. Orders from
the five organizations are com
bined.
Separte orders
Sangha's buyer makes the
purchases and the large order is
broken down into the five

neighborhood orders. Each
co-op divides the food into
separate orders and members
pick them up every Thursday af
ternoon.
Malcom Goggin, a member of
the Escondido co-op, says the
co-op is an example of a "leader
less, non-bureaucratic system
that is working."
The system operates on divi
sion of labor, not power, he said.
There is a co-op steering com
mittee consisting of job team

leaders which discusses operat
ing processes of the co-op.
Any membrr can call a meet
ing of ihe entire co-op and deci
sions are made collectively by all
co-op members.
Margarine
A current discussion, for
example, is what kind of mar
garine- to buy, considering both
expense and saturated fat con
tent.
Goggin said that some co-op

members joined because "it's a
good deal financially." Others
are more involved in the spirit of
the cooperative as a community
and as an alternative to super
market shopping, he said.
Sangha member Michael
Stone says that federations of
small co-ops provide "the
economic power to implement
buying policies consistent with
humane values and an ecologi
cal consciousness."
The Escondido co-op has run
very smoothly, Goggin said.
"Occasionally people don't
show up to work, and a few jobs
are hard to fill."
Spirit
At times the co-op spirit isn't
what it could be, he said. "The
