# Daylight savings bill OK'd
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Senate approved a bill Wednes
day providing seven months of
Daylight Saving Time (DST) this
year and next.
However, because of inaction
in the House, it is doubtful the
nation will observe this year
more than the current six
months of DST or fast time.
My a 4H-15 vote, the Senate ap
proved an amendment by Sen.
Bob Dole (R-Kan.) settling on
DST from mid-March through
mid-October this year and next.
Should this become law, most
Americans would set their
clocks-forward one hour on
March 14 and turn back the
hands one hour on Oct. 10.
The time bill then was'ap
proved 70 to 23 and sent to the
House.
That vote came after senators
rejected, 02 to 31, an effort by.
Sen. Wedell Kord (U-ky.) to cut
back to five months of DST per
year.
By accepting Dole's seven
month plan, the Senate rejected
the proposal by the Commerce
Committee that Daylight Saving
Time be observed from the first
Sunday in March through the;;
second Sunday in November*
this year and next.
Unless some sort of time bill 4
clears both houses of Congress!
soon the nation will go back tuj
the old pattern of six months*
DST and six months'
time each year. DST would run*
from April 25 to Oct. 31.
