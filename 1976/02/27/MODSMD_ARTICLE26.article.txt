# Goldwater: Nixon should stay in China

WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen.
Barry M. Goldwater accused
former President Richard M.
Nixon Wednesday of breaking
an American law in China and
suggested Nixon could do the
United States a favor by staying
in Peking.
Goldwater, a leader of GOP
conservatives and longtime
Nixon ally, made the allegations
when asked if Nixon's current
trip to China had any impact on
President Ford's showing in the
New Hampshire primary.
"1 don't think Mr. Nixon's visit
to China did anything, and if he
wants to do this country a favor
he might stay over there. He is

violating the law," the Arizona
Republican said in an interview
on ABC-TV's Good Morning
America.
"The Logan Act prohibits any
American — and that's all he is,
he's an ex-president and a pri
vate citizen — the Logan Act
says no one but the President
and the secretary of state can
discuss foreign policy.
"1 don't thinkit (the trip) hurt
Mr. Ford," Goldwater said.
"1 don't think the average
American has enough respect for
Mr. Nixon anymore to really be
lieve that what he's doing is in
anybody's interest but Mr.
Nixon's."
