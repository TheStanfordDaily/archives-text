## Hungarian specialties Tokaj: like Europe 
### 
Reviews by Nancy Wilson
Tucked away on a short block
of Santa Cruz Ave. in MenloPark
is the Tokaj Continental Inn.
Featuring continental cuisine,
the Tokaj specializes in Hunga
rian fare. The decor suggests a
small inn hidden in the lush
forests of central Europe. Ad
ding to the atmosphere is a
young man playing a zither-like
instrument, with subdued ver
sions of the "Sound of Music"
and other mid-European special
ties.

The simply styled menu offers
elegant choices from appetizers
through desserts. One can start
with crab or shrimp cocktails, or
perhaps escargots. Of the three
choices of soup, we tried the
vegetable. It's hot, well
seasoned, and accompanied by
black bread.
The fresh mushroom salad is a
plate piled high with crisp
mushroom slices, topped with a
light dressing. They also offer a
mixed greens and a cucumber
salad.

The entrees present a wide
range of veal, beef and fish dis
hes, as well as a few specialties.
By far the largest selection, the
veal entrees cover wiener
schnitzel, schnitzel ala Holstein,
veal cutlet "Oscar" and veal
paprikas. The petit filet mignon,
grenadine of beef and pepper
steak are just part of the beef sec
tion. Fish dishes include lobs
ter, crab mornay, prawns and
shrimp. All entrees run between
$6-8.
To sample the different meats,
we tried the Gourmet Special
known as the Wooden Platter
($14.96 for two persons). A
skewer held Hungarian bacon,
kolbasa sausage and a red pep
per atop the meats.
As we took apart the feast, we
found pieces of veal, pork, lamb
and beef. Each piece was tender,
tasty and beautifully cooked.
Underneath it all were french
fries and rice, and around the
side were a variety of vegetables.
When all was dismantled we
had broccoli, red cabbage,
sauerkraut, pickles, beets and
probably more. Everything was
done with style. The french fries
were thick strips of potato, the
sauerkraut was mild but not
bland, and the red cabbage was
flavorful without tasting vineg
ary.
The house rose is a pleasant
wine, almost like sherry, but
lighter. They also have a fine
wine list and a complete bar for
drinks.
The dessert selection is
equally tempting: cherries
Jubilee, crepe with walnuts or
cottage cheese, baklava and
cheese cake.

schnitzel, schnitzel ala Holstein,
veal cutlet "Oscar" and veal
paprikas. The petit filet mignon,
grenadine of beef and pepper
steak are just part of the beef sec
tion. Fish dishes include lobs
ter, crab mornay, prawns and
shrimp. All entrees run between
$6-8.
To sample the different meats,
we tried the Gourmet Special
known as the Wooden Platter
($14.96 for two persons). A
skewer held Hungarian bacon,
kolbasa sausage and a red pep
per atop the meats.
As we took apart the feast, we
found pieces of veal, pork, lamb
and beef. Each piece was tender,
tasty and beautifully cooked.
Underneath it all were french
fries and rice, and around the
side were a variety of vegetables.
When all was dismantled we
had broccoli, red cabbage,
sauerkraut, pickles, beets and
probably more. Everything was
done with style. The french fries
were thick strips of potato, the
sauerkraut was mild but not
bland, and the red cabbage was
flavorful without tasting vineg
ary.
The house rose is a pleasant
wine, almost like sherry, but
lighter. They also have a fine
wine list and a complete bar for
drinks.
The dessert selection is
equally tempting: cherries
Jubilee, crepe with walnuts or
cottage cheese, baklava and
cheese cake.

Tokaj Continental Inn
Reviews by Nancy Wilson
Tucked away on a short block
of Santa Cruz Ave. in MenloPark
is the Tokaj Continental Inn.
Featuring continental cuisine,
the Tokaj specializes in Hunga
rian fare. The decor suggests a
small inn hidden in the lush
forests of central Europe. Ad
ding to the atmosphere is a
young man playing a zither-like
instrument, with subdued ver
sions of the "Sound of Music"
and other mid-European special
ties.

The simply styled menu offers
elegant choices from appetizers
through desserts. One can start
with crab or shrimp cocktails, or
perhaps escargots. Of the three
choices of soup, we tried the
vegetable. It's hot, well
seasoned, and accompanied by
black bread.
The fresh mushroom salad is a
plate piled high with crisp
mushroom slices, topped with a
light dressing. They also offer a
mixed greens and a cucumber
salad.

The entrees present a wide
range of veal, beef and fish dis
hes, as well as a few specialties.
By far the largest selection, the
veal entrees cover wiener
schnitzel, schnitzel ala Holstein,
veal cutlet "Oscar" and veal
paprikas. The petit filet mignon,
grenadine of beef and pepper
steak are just part of the beef sec
tion. Fish dishes include lobs
ter, crab mornay, prawns and
shrimp. All entrees run between
$6-8.
