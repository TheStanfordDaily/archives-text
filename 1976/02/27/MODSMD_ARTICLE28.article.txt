# Red Pepper lacks spice
## 
### 
The Red Pepper, located on El Gainino Way (not
to be confused with El Camino Real), is a good
Mexican restaurant at a modest price. The menu
offers complete dinners, each including an as
sortment of the following dishes: tacos, en
chiladas, tostados, tamales, chile rellenos, rice
and beans. The combos vary in size to accommo
date both big and small appetites. There is also an
a la carte arrangement of the various dishes.
Dinner starts with a basket of corn chipsand hot
sauce. The sauce is authentic, plenty of peppers
and plenty hot. We also had guacamole for dip
ping the chips; it's rich in avacado flavor, but not
very spicy.
The chicken tostado and the beef enchilada
come served on the same hot plate, with a bed of
rice. Tostado and enchilada are $2.50 each (a bit
extra for added guacamole). The beef enchilada is
preferred.
The Burrito Grande Special at $3.50 consists of
small chunks of beef with a gravy-tvpe sauce,
wrapped in a soft tortilla. Sharing the spread are
chile relleno and rice. The chile relleno is tasty:

green peppers and a generous amount of cheese,
cooked in an egg batter.
The dishes lack the spiciness one expects in
Mexican food. However, by just reaching across
the table, one has access to the small bowl of
wincingly hot, green chile sauce.
To cool the tongue after a too-ambitious taste of
the hot-sauce, try a pitcher of sangria: $3.50 for
about five glasses. The sangria is fruity but weak.
Also available are local and imported beers (Dos
Equis) and several wines.
The dessert selection, if you have room for it,
isn't very large: sherbet and ice cream. But the
coffee, served in attractive mugs, is smooth and
rich.
The interior decoration, with stucco walls and
wooden benches and tables, is Mexican enough.
The main dining area is divided into small, pri
vate cubicles by the high backs of the wooden
benches and several free-standing walls. The
mood is quiet, dim and the waitresses are accom
modating.
