# A 						change of pace
## Do-it-yourself at Genghis Khan 
### 
For a casual, do-it-yourself
meal, there's the Genghis Khan
Mongolian Barbecue in the
Alma Plaza. A row of tables line
the wall on one side of the room,
while the counter, with cooking
area and cashier, line the other.
Over each table is a metal stove
hood, with a well taken notice to
watch your head.
After you're seated, the wait
ress turns on the gas jets inside
your private hibachi and leaves
you with the menu. Your choice

is between half and three-quarter
pound servings of either beef,
pork, lamb, shrimp or scallops,
or any combination of the five. A
half pound serving of one variety
runs about $3.75. a combination*
serving runs about $4 to $5.
Included in the price of the
meal is either soup or salad, rice,
vegetable, tea and dessert. The
soup was packed with chunks of
chicken. The vegetables were
cooked bean sprouts. Dessert
was a scoop of ice cream.
Meat comes served in raw
pieces, over a layer of sliced on
ions. With the long handled
fondue-like fork, you place the
pieces on the hibachi, and cook
them for as long as needed. (The
menu includes estimated cook
ing time for desired doneness.)
Then, drop the piece in the spe
cial mongolian sauce, and pre
sto, you have cooked your own
meal. This way each piece is
done and hot just when you're
ready to eat it.
All five meats come coated
with sesame seeds for a little
crunch. One warning: watch that
the meat doesn't get stuck to the
grill.
To accompany the meal a half
carafe of house chablis costs
only $1.75 for about four glasses.
They also keep a refrigerator of
beers and wines.
The Genghis Khan is a change
of pace for eating out. Nothing
fancy, but then neither is tbe
price. If you're looking for some
thing to keep you busy while
you're dining, it's a neat idea.
