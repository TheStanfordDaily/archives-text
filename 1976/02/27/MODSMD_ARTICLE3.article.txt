# Quota miss feared
## IFC in preparation for rush 
### Stephen Crolius 
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) Rush
Committee Chairman Tim Ferguson
said at yesterday's IFC meeting that he
was "worried" that the fraternity sys
tem won Id not be able to meet its quota
for the 1976-1977 academic year.
IFC President Bob Ottilie, however,
said he was confident that the IFC
would meet its quota this year, despite
the fact that it missed last year's quota

by nine places. "I don't foresee any
problems," he said.
The quota, as defined in the Univer
sity housing regulations, is based on
the percentage of all University hous
ing which the fraternity system repre
sents. II the fraternity system is not
able to attract 17.4 percent of the total
number of students entering the hous
ing draw this year, it stands to lose a
house to the University residence sys
tem.
Ferguson, complaining of a lack of
support for the rush committee from
certain individual fraternities, said,"l
don't think I can say for certain that
wire going to meet our quota this
v *ir.
He cited chronically poor atten
dance at the rush committee meetings
as a hindrance to the organization of
the rush.
'Hurt us all'
"We've got to come to the realiza
tion," he said, "that no matter how
strong individual houses are, if one
house fails it's going to hurt us all."
Ferguson called the fraternities'in
formal rush activities during the last
quarter "somewhat of a success" and
outlined a plan for a possible transfer
students' rush next autumn that would
act as a "safety valve for those houses
who miss their quota this spring."
Concluding that the fraternity sys
tem is in "a better position than last
year" for the rush. Ferguson warned
that cooperation between the frater
nities would be essential in order to
meet the quota.
Answer questions
Row director Norm Robinson at
tended the meeting to answer ques
tions about the sections of the new
housing regulations pertaining to tin;
fraternities.
The compilation of the regulations,

which will serve as the official
guidelines for administering the hous
ing system from April 1 of this year to
March ,'t 1 of next year, should be com
pleted by the end of this quarter, ac
cording to Robinson.
Robinson said the fraternity quota is
"in the 230 to 240 range," down from
202 places last year. I le cited a smaller
freshman class entering next Sep
tember and an increase in tin; number
of students who will choose to live off
campus next year as reasons for the
drop in the quota.

'230 to 240' range.
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) Rush
Committee Chairman Tim Ferguson
said at yesterday's IFC meeting that he
was "worried" that the fraternity sys
tem won Id not be able to meet its quota
for the 1976-1977 academic year.
IFC President Bob Ottilie, however,
said he was confident that the IFC
would meet its quota this year, despite
the fact that it missed last year's quota

by nine places. "I don't foresee any
problems," he said.
The quota, as defined in the Univer
sity housing regulations, is based on
the percentage of all University hous
ing which the fraternity system repre
sents. II the fraternity system is not
able to attract 17.4 percent of the total
number of students entering the hous
ing draw this year, it stands to lose a
house to the University residence sys
tem.
Ferguson, complaining of a lack of
support for the rush committee from
certain individual fraternities, said,"l
don't think I can say for certain that
wire going to meet our quota this
v *ir.
