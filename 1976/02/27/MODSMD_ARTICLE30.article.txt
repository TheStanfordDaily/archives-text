## Orange crate art Labels recall frontier heritage

lake a second look at those old
produce crates that many stu
dents use as tables or as wall
units. You may unexpectedly
find some collectors' items.
In fact, one of the largest col
lections of California Orange
Crate Label Art, 1900-1940, is
now in exhibition at the De
Young Museum, San Francisco.
As American popular art, as
colorful imagery and even as his
torical documentation, a more
enjoyable exhibition can hardly
be found.
The current San Francisco
show is special, says dealer and
collector of label art Laurie Cor
don, because several public and
private collections have com
bined to produce the largest
show ever in one place.
The "Orange Crate Show"
greets the viewer with an au
thentic transfer press and illust
ration of the surprisingly elabo

rate lithography process that
produced the surprisingly color
ful label designs. San Francis
co's present attraction for artists
and designers is interestingly
based on the tradition of graphic
quality pioneered by the city's
early crate label lithographers.
Colorful
Simply as American popular
art, the orange crate labels are
the colorful and fantastic images
of a pre-TV and pre-color photo
graphy era.
During that period of 1900-
1940, their elaborate "catchi
ness" served the advertising
purposes of some 8000 indi
vidual growers in Southern
California, each of whom had his
own personally-designed label.
For us, the label designs still
provide motifs for such contem
porary items as billboards, ice
cream cartons and record labels.
Their nostalgia value heightens
their current interest as exhibit

able and collectible.
The emergence of orange crate
labels as an art form paralleled
the rise of the California citrus
industry itself. Likewise, the
labels' themes and motifs reflect
the American dreams, or myths,
of the period.
Romantic
California, with its growing
citrus industry, symbolized to
Americans the last romantic
fronties — the cowboy, the
farmer, the missions, not to men
tion the glamor of Hollywood
all found places in label art.
In wartime the "All-American
Orange" label became artisti
cally patriotic in displaying
Uncle Sams, colonial figures,
fighting men and the products of
the wartime industries that grew
along with the California citrus
groves.
Crate labels not only roman
ticized American frontier oppor

tunity and military prowess but
also the pervasive sexual and ra
cial stereotypes. We see rough,
tough "men of action," gentle
and alluring women and
"angelic" children.
Race
Neither does any race escape
characterization by the Califor
nia label artists. Some labels
show us a world of smoking jac
kets, resorts, black porters and
Chinese launderers, for exam
ple.
And among other "Myths of
the West," the "Savage Injun" is
tamed by the citrus industry.
The Indian was a favorite fron
tier subject of the artists and they
portrayals personify the images
that have become so controver
sial here on the Stanford cam
pus.
About 1940, though, this
California "romance" began to
fade. The advent of color photo
graphy, of greater industrial effi
ciency and of the corporate
grower resulted in cardboard
crates and non-pictorial, less
colorful labels.
The sentimental American
myth of 1900-1940 as preserved
in label art is definitely an en
lightening attraction of the De
Young exhibition. Yet the color
ful images are artistically satisfy
ing in themslves. Co see the
"Orange Crate Show." It runs at
the De Young Museum, Golden
Cate Park, through March 28.

art.

Crate Label Art, 1900-1940, is

As American popular art, as
colorful imagery and even as his
torical documentation, a more
enjoyable exhibition can hardly
be found.

Colorful
Simply as American popular
art, the orange crate labels are
the colorful and fantastic images
of a pre-TV and pre-color photo
graphy era.
During that period of 1900-
1940, their elaborate "catchi
ness" served the advertising
purposes of some 8000 indi
vidual growers in Southern
California, each of whom had his
own personally-designed label.
For us, the label designs still
provide motifs for such contem
porary items as billboards, ice
cream cartons and record labels.
Their nostalgia value heightens
their current interest as exhibit

able and collectible.
The emergence of orange crate
labels as an art form paralleled
the rise of the California citrus
industry itself. Likewise, the
labels' themes and motifs reflect
the American dreams, or myths,
of the period.
Romantic
California, with its growing
citrus industry, symbolized to
Americans the last romantic
fronties — the cowboy, the
farmer, the missions, not to men
tion the glamor of Hollywood
all found places in label art.
In wartime the "All-American
Orange" label became artisti
cally patriotic in displaying
Uncle Sams, colonial figures,
fighting men and the products of
the wartime industries that grew
along with the California citrus
groves.
Crate labels not only roman
ticized American frontier oppor

tunity and military prowess but
also the pervasive sexual and ra
cial stereotypes. We see rough,
tough "men of action," gentle
and alluring women and
"angelic" children.
Race
Neither does any race escape
characterization by the Califor
nia label artists. Some labels
show us a world of smoking jac
kets, resorts, black porters and
Chinese launderers, for exam
ple.
And among other "Myths of
the West," the "Savage Injun" is
tamed by the citrus industry.
The Indian was a favorite fron
tier subject of the artists and they
portrayals personify the images
that have become so controver
sial here on the Stanford cam
pus.
About 1940, though, this
California "romance" began to
fade. The advent of color photo
graphy, of greater industrial effi
ciency and of the corporate
grower resulted in cardboard
crates and non-pictorial, less
colorful labels.
The sentimental American
myth of 1900-1940 as preserved
in label art is definitely an en
lightening attraction of the De
