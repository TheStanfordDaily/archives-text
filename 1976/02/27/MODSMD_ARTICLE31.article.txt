# Spring opera a bargain
## 
### Alexander Leff 
In its 15th season, the San
Francisco Spring Opera Theatre
offers audiences four unusual
operas, all in English.
Produced by the San Fran
cisco Opera, and directed by the
noted Kurt Adler, the spring
opera promises to be a lively and
surprisingly inexpensive smor
gasbord of first-class opera.
While the main season for the
San Francisco Opera is in the au
tumn, the spring opera is simi
lar to baseball's spring exhibi
tion games.
Produced under the auspices
of the San Francisco Opera, the
spring opera gives young per
formers a chance to gain experi
ence and allows veterans an op

portunity to experiment.
But it is not only performers
who benefit, for the spring
opera gives opera fans a chance
to see first rate opera at budget
prices. It isn't necessary to hock
your Sutherland records to buy a
seat there.
In other words, ticket prices in
the spring are nowhere as high
as prices are for the autumn sea
son.
The mood of the spring opera
this year is young and experi
mental. Of its four operas, two
are new productions — La
PerichoJe by Offenbach, and
L'Amico Fritz by Mascagni. The
third is a world premiere —
Meeting Mr. Ives. Bach's The
Passion According to St.

Matthew, which received en
thusiastic reviews last year,
rounds out this year's season.
San Francisco audiences will
be treated to the world premiere
of Meeting Mr. Ives when Spring
Opera Theatre unveils the color
ful new production at theCurran
Theatre this evening with addi
tional performances on March 6,
11 and 14.
The presentation represents
Spring Opera Theatre's salute to
the bicentennials of the United
States and the city of San Fran
cisco.
Meeting Mr. Ives is set in a
small Connecticut town in the
late 19th century and tells the
story of New England composer
Charles Ives (1874-1954), re
garded by Leonard Bernstein as
"our Washington, Lincoln and
Jefferson of music."
Sparkling choreography and
dialogue blend in a lively piece
of theater with generous sampl
