# Oscar nominations create Hollywood frenzy
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
When the Oscar nominations
were announced on Feb. 17, it is
very likely that the following
people were in a state of uncon
trollable frenzy:
Carol Kane, nominated; Roy
Scheider, shafted; Louise
Fletcher, nominated; Warren
Beatty, shafted; Ann-Margret,
nominated; Lorraine Gary,
shafted; Lily Tomlin, nomi
nated; Donald Sutherland,
shafted; James Whitmore, nomi
nated; Karen Mack, shafted;
Richard Dreyfuss, shafted; Ste
ven Spielberg, shafted; the list is
practically endless.
The nominations were ex
tremely unexpected. Just a few
months ago someone predicted
that Shampoo and Jaws would
get 12 nominations apiece. They
got four apiece. Considering that

they are probably the two biggest
money-makers of the year, what
can explain that kind of be
havior?
Problem
Roy Scheider, in an interview
with the Examiner's Stanley
Eichelbaum, zeroed in on the
problem that may have plagued
both /uivs and Shampoo.
"There's a backlash. The gros
ses have made Juws a gross pic
ture. People think it deserves a
punch in the face for making so
much money. For that reason, it
may lose out for the Oscars.
"Too much success breeds
contempt," Scheider said.
Ignored
Superstars, with the exception
of Jack Nicholson and A 1 Pacino,
were uniformly ignored for bet
ter but less well-known perfor
mers. On the whole, the nomina
tions were for artistic endeavors
rather than flashy big-budget
films.
This is a switch for those who
may have expected fluff like
Lucky Ludy and Funny Lady to
sweep through with a happy
go-lucky air. When small and
little-seen films like The Man In
The Glass Booth, Hester Street
and Give 'Em Hell, Harry are
nominated in the acting
categories, one can tell a change
is in the air.
In predicting Oscar winners,
one must remember the previous
year's predictions. Those of
Jimmy The Greek in 1975 were
Chinatown (Godfather II won);
Jack Nicholson (Art Carney
won); Faye Dunaway (Ellen
Burstyn won); Fred Astire
(Robert DeNiro won); Ingrid
Bergman (bullseye) and Francis
Ford Coppola (bullseye).
As the March 29 ceremony
grows increasingly close, pre
dictions will be showering right
and left. Always remember to
take them with a grain of salt.

Ready with the salt? Here are
mine:
Usually picture and director
awards are for the same film.
There may be a Cabaret/
Godfuther split, something that
occurs every few years.
In that case, I would guess that
Juws' $200 million won't be to
tally ignored, and Milos Formun
will win for One Flew Over The
Cuckoo's Nest.

Jack Nicholson is the favorite
for Cuckoo's Nest, and, while Al
Pacino (Dog Day Afternoon) is
his most formidable competition
this year as for the last two years.
I don't think they'll let Nichol
son walk away without it.
For best actress, the chances
seem best for either Louise
Fletcher (Cuckoo's Nest) or
Ann-Margret (7'ommy).
The best supporting actor

category has three veterans —
George Burns, Burgess Meredith
and Jack Warden — hut since
sentimentality runs in cycles,
and Fred Astaire lost last year,
it'll probably be Burns.
As tor best supporting actress,
I would choose either Brenda
Vaccaro (the only asset of Once
Is Not Enough) or Lily Tomlin
(giving a bravura debut in
Nashville).

GIVE 'EM HELL, OSCAR—Who will those lucky winners be? No one knows for sure, and even the
Hollywood sages have been wrong in the past. James VVhitmore, pictured above portraying Presi
dent Harry S Truman, has a chance to pick up an Oscar for best actor even thougn his film has not
made a big Hollywood splash.
