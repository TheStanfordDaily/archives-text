"And suddenly, the Maples
floor vvhinged like a trampoline
as hundreds of crazed fans
swarmed on it and jumped on it
to an inspired rendition of 'All
Right Now.'
"And if one of those fans had
gotten as highphysically.as he or
she was mentally, and actually
flown to the roof, it wouldn't
have been as surprising as the
events which had j"st taken
place.
"Stanford 64, second-ranked
UCLA 60."
"Stanford 67, fifth-ranked
USC 66."

'Maples Miracle'
The weekend that has become
known as the "Maples Miracle"
will linger on in the memories of
the 7913 and 7843 fans, respec
tively, who jammed the Pavilion
last Jan. 17 and 18 expecting to
see the SoCal duo teach the
Cards how the game is supposed
to be played.
But Rich Kelley, Howie
Dallmar and Company de
monstrated the art and skill of
basketball like Stanford fans,
and perhaps even UCLA coach
John Wooden, had never seen it
played.
The Cardinals out-hustled,
out-muscled and out-rustled the
Bruins and Trojans, temporarily
tying for the Pacific Eight lead
and catching the fancy of Stan
ford's fickle fans.
Not a masterpiece
The games themselves weren't
majestic masterpieces. Stanford
had played better, in a game it
had lost to Oregon, earlier in the
season.
But the pressure was on the
Cards in the last few minutes and
the unbelieving fans were on the
edges of their seats, creating in
describable tension and excite
ment. The Cards did not fold or
falter, and the fans went wild.
In the first half against the
Bruins, Stanford could do no
wrong, building up a 37-24 lead.
But UCLA managed one of its
patented comebacks early in the
second frame, causing the Cards
to temporarily choke away 11 of
the 15-point lead they had built
up.
Four point margin
A Dallmar time-out got the
Cards back on the right track and
the Bruins could get no closer
than four points for the rest oft he
game.
Kelley and Ed Schweitzer
each contributed 22 points, but
more importantly, this year's

team captain blanketed UCLA
Ail-American Dave Meyers,
holding him to 15 points.
Richard Washington, who'll
probably have something to say
about the outcome of tomorrow's
contest, kept the Bruins in the
game during the last 10 minutes,
finishing with 17 points, but it
was not enough.
The Bruins had been con
quered, but the Stanford dres
sing room was not as jubilant as
might be expected of a team
which had not beaten its south
land rivals since 1966. The Mira
cle had only begun.
DSC more exciting
The USC game, if possible,
was more exciting than the pre
vious night's encounter, as
neither team was able to build up
a lead. The Trojans couldn't stop
Kelley, who finished with 30
points; and the Cards couldn't
do much about Cus Williams,
who put in 31.
The key to the game was the
play of then-freshman Jay Carter.
Coming off the bench, the
6-foot-3 guard hit five of five
from the floor and stopped Tro
jan star Bob Trowbridge with
four points.
When Carter suffered a cramp
with less than a minute and a
half left and the Cards up by one,
Dallmar called a double time
out. as the fans agonized a big
longer and the band played a bit
louder.
Superhuman block
With 39 seconds left, theCards
tried to ice it with Dallmar's in
famous backdoor allev-oop pin v,
but Williams made a super
human block of ScottTrobbe's
layin, coming down with the
ball in his hands and his foot on
the baseline.
But as nearly 8000 fans waited
for the referee's whistle, it didn't
come. "Could this be the begin
ning of the end?" they thought
as they screamed their discon
tent.
No, was the resounding ans
wer, as one of the officials man
aged to toot his horn just before
Williams got to half court.
The rest of the game was Kel
ley, as far as the Cards were con
cerned. He converted two one
and-one situations, each time
with the Cards only leading by a
point. (Kelley, by the way, hit on
18 straight free throws during
the two games.)
The fans went wild: "Stanford
basketball has indeed arrived,"
the Daily reported. And al
though the top spot in the Pac-8
didn't last long, THE weekend
made all the other games worth
it.
