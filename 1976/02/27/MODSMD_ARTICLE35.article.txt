# Stanford seniors' last home game
## Cards host SC, UCLA 
### Paul Bauman 
It's that weekend again. When
students who would normally
rather spend a Friday or Satur
day evening at a party than at
Maples Pavilion are suddenly
complaining that they can't get a
basketball ticket. When students
who haven't been to a Stanford
game all season suddenly can't
think of anything they'd rather
do. And when the players and
coaches talk about extra incen
tive.
It's the weekend of the USC
and UCLA games at Maples. And
while in many ways, especially
increased ticket sales, this is just
like past USC-UCLA visits, there
are some novel aspects.
First, UCLA, Stanford's oppo
nent Saturday night (KZSU, 90.1
FM, 8:05 p.m.), is coming off a
loss at home, and the last time
that happened, premium
gasoline sold for about 39 cents a
gallon.
Second, the Bruins, with a
tenuous one-game lead in the
Pacific Eight, haven't yet
clinched the league champion
ship for a change.
Third, not only is USC headed
for its first losing season in coach
Bob Boyd's 10 years there, but
the Trojans are doing it in style.
USC is 0-11 in the Pac-8 this
year, and if the Trojans can't fill
"Boyd's Void" against Stanford
(1-10) tonight, they may go
through an entire league season
winless.
Last home games
Finally, Cards Ed Schweitzer,
Tim Patterson and Mike Simons
will be playing their last games
in Maples.
The Stanford-USC game to
night (KZSU, 90.1 FM, 8:05
p.m.) should help answer that
nagging question of who is the
Pac-B's worst team.
The injury-plagued Cardinals
have lost six straight games, and
14 of their last 17, by progres
sively wider margins. A major
factor has been forward Ceorge
Schader's reduced effectiveness.
Schader is still playing with a
stress fracture in his left leg and a
strained achilles tendon in his
left foot. He practiced for the first
time in a week Wednesday.
Schader, who scored 25 points
and added 14 rebounds in Stan
ford 's 86-7 5 win over USC in Los
Angeles last month, is a ques
tionable starter tonight, as is
guard Wolfe Perry. The
freshman has a bruised hip and
has been working out only half
time in practice. )av Carter and
Jeff McHugh should see substan
tial playing time whether or not
Schader and Perry start.
USC, which has lost 15 con

secutive league games in basket
ball and football, will be out to
prove that it can win a Pac-8
game in a major sport.
What has happened to USC
since the Trojans began the sea
son by winning 11 of 12 non
conference games? Nobody
seems to have a precise answer.
"They play similar to us." said
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso.
"They make mistakes at the
wrong time. I look at their box
scores and they're ahead at
halftime. Then they're down by
10 at the end. Something must be
happening in between."
USC will start Marv Safford,
the seventh leading scorer in the
Pac-8 with a 17.7 average and
probably the Trojans' most con
sistent player, and 6-foot-6 Earl
Evans in the backcourt. Steve
Malovic, the league's fifth best
rebounder, will open at center
and Bob Trowbridge and Greg
White are the starting forwards.
No tickets
The UCLA game has been sold
out for over a month. The Bruins
will be entering Maples after
playing their worst game ever at
Pauley Pavilion, where they are
still a pretty fair 167-3.
UCLA lost to Oregon, 65-45,

after scoring only 14 points in
the first half. The Bruins hit only
six of 27 from the floor (.222) in
the half and were down 2H-8
with 3:50 left before intermis
sion.
"Oregon played great and de
served to win," said UCLA coach
Gene Bartow. "But I've never
had a team either in high school
or college ever get off to such a
horrible start."
Bartow said he will stic:k with
his starting lineup of Rich
Washington, who leads the
Pac-8 with a 20.2 scoring aver
age, and Marques Johnson at
forwards, freshman David
Greenwood at center and Andre
McCarter and Raymond
Townsend at guards.
The three Stanford seniors all
regard the UCLA game, their last
at Stanford, exactly alike.
"1 don't want to say it's just <
another game," Patterson said,
"because that's probably not
true."
"It's just like any other game,"
said Schweitzer.
"It really means a lot to me."
Simons said. "This is kind of the
end of basketball for me. It's been
the main part of my life for the
past 10 years."

"Oregon played great and de

Gene Bartow. "But I've never
had a team either in high school

his starting lineup of Rich
Washington, who leads the
Pac-8 with a 20.2 scoring aver
age, and Marques Johnson at
forwards, freshman David
Greenwood at center and Andre
McCarter and Raymond
Townsend at guards.
The three Stanford seniors all
regard the UCLA game, their last

another game," Patterson said,

"It's just like any other game,"

"It really means a lot to me."
Simons said. "This is kind of the

MAN TO STOP—UCLA guard Andre McCarter, shown here scor
ing two of his 26 points in the Bruins' 68-67 win over Stanford last
month, will be a primary target of the Card defense tomorrow,
when the Bruins visit Maples at 8:05 p.m.
It's that weekend again. When
students who would normally
rather spend a Friday or Satur
day evening at a party than at
Maples Pavilion are suddenly
complaining that they can't get a
basketball ticket. When students
who haven't been to a Stanford
game all season suddenly can't
think of anything they'd rather
do. And when the players and
coaches talk about extra incen
tive.
It's the weekend of the USC
and UCLA games at Maples. And
while in many ways, especially
increased ticket sales, this is just
like past USC-UCLA visits, there
are some novel aspects.
First, UCLA, Stanford's oppo
nent Saturday night (KZSU, 90.1
FM, 8:05 p.m.), is coming off a
loss at home, and the last time
that happened, premium
gasoline sold for about 39 cents a
gallon.
Second, the Bruins, with a
tenuous one-game lead in the
Pacific Eight, haven't yet
clinched the league champion
ship for a change.
Third, not only is USC headed
for its first losing season in coach
Bob Boyd's 10 years there, but
the Trojans are doing it in style.
USC is 0-11 in the Pac-8 this
year, and if the Trojans can't fill
"Boyd's Void" against Stanford
(1-10) tonight, they may go
through an entire league season
winless.
Last home games
Finally, Cards Ed Schweitzer,
Tim Patterson and Mike Simons
will be playing their last games
in Maples.
The Stanford-USC game to
night (KZSU, 90.1 FM, 8:05
p.m.) should help answer that
nagging question of who is the
Pac-B's worst team.
The injury-plagued Cardinals
have lost six straight games, and
14 of their last 17, by progres
sively wider margins. A major
factor has been forward Ceorge
Schader's reduced effectiveness.
Schader is still playing with a
stress fracture in his left leg and a
strained achilles tendon in his
left foot. He practiced for the first
time in a week Wednesday.
Schader, who scored 25 points
and added 14 rebounds in Stan
ford 's 86-7 5 win over USC in Los
Angeles last month, is a ques
tionable starter tonight, as is
guard Wolfe Perry. The
freshman has a bruised hip and
has been working out only half
time in practice. )av Carter and
Jeff McHugh should see substan
tial playing time whether or not
Schader and Perry start.
USC, which has lost 15 con

secutive league games in basket
ball and football, will be out to
prove that it can win a Pac-8
game in a major sport.
What has happened to USC
since the Trojans began the sea
son by winning 11 of 12 non
conference games? Nobody
seems to have a precise answer.
"They play similar to us." said
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso.
"They make mistakes at the
wrong time. I look at their box
scores and they're ahead at
halftime. Then they're down by
10 at the end. Something must be
happening in between."
USC will start Marv Safford,
the seventh leading scorer in the
Pac-8 with a 17.7 average and
probably the Trojans' most con
sistent player, and 6-foot-6 Earl
Evans in the backcourt. Steve
Malovic, the league's fifth best
rebounder, will open at center
and Bob Trowbridge and Greg
White are the starting forwards.
No tickets
The UCLA game has been sold
out for over a month. The Bruins
will be entering Maples after
playing their worst game ever at
Pauley Pavilion, where they are
still a pretty fair 167-3.
UCLA lost to Oregon, 65-45,

after scoring only 14 points in
the first half. The Bruins hit only
six of 27 from the floor (.222) in
the half and were down 2H-8
with 3:50 left before intermis

game in a major sport.
What has happened to USC
since the Trojans began the sea
son by winning 11 of 12 non
conference games? Nobody
seems to have a precise answer.
"They play similar to us." said
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso.
"They make mistakes at the
wrong time. I look at their box
scores and they're ahead at
halftime. Then they're down by
10 at the end. Something must be
happening in between."
USC will start Marv Safford,
the seventh leading scorer in the
Pac-8 with a 17.7 average and
probably the Trojans' most con
sistent player, and 6-foot-6 Earl
Evans in the backcourt. Steve
Malovic, the league's fifth best
rebounder, will open at center
and Bob Trowbridge and Greg
White are the starting forwards.
No tickets
The UCLA game has been sold
out for over a month. The Bruins
will be entering Maples after
playing their worst game ever at
Pauley Pavilion, where they are
still a pretty fair 167-3.
UCLA lost to Oregon, 65-45,

after scoring only 14 points in
the first half. The Bruins hit only
six of 27 from the floor (.222) in
the half and were down 2H-8
with 3:50 left before intermis
sion.
"Oregon played great and de
served to win," said UCLA coach
Gene Bartow. "But I've never
had a team either in high school
or college ever get off to such a
horrible start."
Bartow said he will stic:k with
his starting lineup of Rich
Washington, who leads the
Pac-8 with a 20.2 scoring aver
age, and Marques Johnson at
forwards, freshman David
Greenwood at center and Andre
McCarter and Raymond
Townsend at guards.
The three Stanford seniors all
regard the UCLA game, their last
at Stanford, exactly alike.
"1 don't want to say it's just <
another game," Patterson said,
"because that's probably not
true."
"It's just like any other game,"
said Schweitzer.
"It really means a lot to me."
Simons said. "This is kind of the
end of basketball for me. It's been
the main part of my life for the
past 10 years."

MAN TO STOP—UCLA guard Andre McCarter, shown here scor
ing two of his 26 points in the Bruins' 68-67 win over Stanford last
month, will be a primary target of the Card defense tomorrow,
when the Bruins visit Maples at 8:05 p.m.
It's that weekend again. When
students who would normally
rather spend a Friday or Satur
day evening at a party than at
Maples Pavilion are suddenly
complaining that they can't get a
basketball ticket. When students
who haven't been to a Stanford
game all season suddenly can't
think of anything they'd rather
do. And when the players and
coaches talk about extra incen
tive.
It's the weekend of the USC
and UCLA games at Maples. And
while in many ways, especially
increased ticket sales, this is just
like past USC-UCLA visits, there
are some novel aspects.
First, UCLA, Stanford's oppo
nent Saturday night (KZSU, 90.1
FM, 8:05 p.m.), is coming off a
loss at home, and the last time
that happened, premium
gasoline sold for about 39 cents a
gallon.
Second, the Bruins, with a
tenuous one-game lead in the
Pacific Eight, haven't yet
clinched the league champion
ship for a change.
Third, not only is USC headed
for its first losing season in coach
Bob Boyd's 10 years there, but
the Trojans are doing it in style.
USC is 0-11 in the Pac-8 this
year, and if the Trojans can't fill
"Boyd's Void" against Stanford
(1-10) tonight, they may go
through an entire league season
winless.
Last home games
Finally, Cards Ed Schweitzer,
Tim Patterson and Mike Simons
will be playing their last games
in Maples.
The Stanford-USC game to
night (KZSU, 90.1 FM, 8:05
p.m.) should help answer that
nagging question of who is the
Pac-B's worst team.
The injury-plagued Cardinals
have lost six straight games, and
14 of their last 17, by progres
sively wider margins. A major
factor has been forward Ceorge
Schader's reduced effectiveness.
Schader is still playing with a
stress fracture in his left leg and a
strained achilles tendon in his
left foot. He practiced for the first
time in a week Wednesday.
Schader, who scored 25 points
and added 14 rebounds in Stan
ford 's 86-7 5 win over USC in Los
Angeles last month, is a ques
tionable starter tonight, as is
guard Wolfe Perry. The
freshman has a bruised hip and
has been working out only half
time in practice. )av Carter and
Jeff McHugh should see substan
tial playing time whether or not
Schader and Perry start.
USC, which has lost 15 con

secutive league games in basket
ball and football, will be out to
prove that it can win a Pac-8
game in a major sport.
