# 'Easy Eddie' is shy Eddie off basketball court
## Stanford basketball team captain not a 'rah-rah' type 
### Gary Sprague 
Ed Schweitzer perches nervously on the
edge of his bed. He talks quietly, leaning
forward to touch his feet, then rocking hack
to grasp his knees. His features are as ani
mated as his voice, his brown eyes widen
ing to punctuate his comments. He moves
easily from one subject to another, talking
about basketball's role in his life.
"1 started playing in ninth grade. I needed
a little pushing. Once I started playing, the
interest built as I improved. I wound up
playing every day and it was taking up
every minute of my life. It's been that way
ever since."
On academics
"1 rate basketball and school pretty even.
They both involve a lot of time. I probably
put more time this year into basketball than
1 have the preceding two years. Possibly,
because of (first-year) coach (Dick) Dißiaso,
and possibly because of my role as team
captain, there's a little more dedication.
"I've always taken school pretty seri
ously. I've taken a few easy classes here and
there, you know, like any athlete, but I've
kept right up with the studies, and I spend a
lot of time studying, usually. Except for this
quarter."
On his future
"I can't believe how quickly these four
years have gone. I'd like to keep playing for
a while more. I'll take it on a year-to-year
basis. I'm still very enthusiastic about the
game. I'm still willing to work out hard and
play for. maybe, five more years. I'd like to
play in Italy because I knowa little Italian."
On his personality
"I find myself very conscientious about a
lot of things. I think I'm a pretty mellow
person. I tend to take things seriously a lot of
times and I don't really want to.
"Such as I tend to get far too involved in
basketball, sometimes, than I'd rather be. I
keep telling myself relax, try to relax a bit
more, and things will cornea little bit easier.
"And it's the same thing with school.
Most of the time I'm an easy-going person. I
don't get particularly excited about too
many things, particularly off the basketball
court. I'm pretty low key. I get frustrated and
aggressive but playing basketball is a good
outlet.
Introverted
"I'm basically an introvert. I'm not a real
rah-rah type, you know. As for my role of
team captain, I don't really come out there
gung-ho, screaming and all that.
"As I approach a game, and if I'm particu

larly nervous about it and really ready to
play. 1 won't say a word. And the more ready
1 am, the quieter I'll be.
"And sometimes, because the coach (Di-
Biaso) is an extrovert, our styles conflict.
He'll say, 'Come on Schweitzer, get up, get
up,' and I'll just be sitting there, not saying
anything. That's just the difference in the
two personalities. I think he (DiBiaso)
realizes that now. If I'm pretty loose, walk
ing around, talking, singing or doing what
ever, 1 know I'm not ready to play."
On his frustration
"I've had moments when I've been down.
I reached a point last Saturday night after

the Washington State game (the Cards lost
40-79, as Schweitzer scored seven points). I
didn't play well, we lost, I really wanted to
win that game.
"Losing, as much as people stress win
ning, and I think it should be stressed be
cause a lot of times it's really hard to lose, is
just a drag. You really get down about it.
You don't like to be called 'a loser.'
"It gets frustrating, and a lot of times,
particularly after a weekend where we've
lost games, I'll come out to practice and I'll
find myself doing things I normally
wouldn't do.
"I'll be a little more aggressive than I
should, throw a few elbows, here and there,
at guys who are my friends. Afterwards I'll
feel sorry for it, but at the time you have no
control. We've had days, in practice, where
the whole team real ly goes after each ot her.
On playing for a loser
"I'd rather not play as much and play for a
winner. It's nice to be. quote 'the star.' but I
really don't look at myself in those terms. I
just try to go out and do what will help the
team.
"I'd like to play for a team that's a winner.
I really dislike losing. The past few seasons
have been particularly frustrating, particu
larly in the sense that I felt we could do
better but we just didn't. Nobody seemed to
know why."
On fans recognizing him
"Once in awhile, I'll get something here
or there, a 'hello.' or 4 uood uame.' or some

thing. In the last two years, as people get
familiar with your face, and have seen you
play quite a few times, you find they just
start talking, or ask you a few questions
here or there. It's all right. I enjoy that.
"The things I don't like are the obnoxious
things, such as getting down on your
height. 'How's the weather up there?' that
kind of thing. I'll really give someone the
cold shoulder quick when they start giving
me that. People can be really annoying
sometimes."
On his temper
"My personality's pretty steady. I don't
vary too much. I'll get mad once ina while
about certain things, but I don't fly off the
handle. I can't recall ever getting really mad
except in a game. It gets to a point, in a
game, where some guy starts beating on
you, or starts throwing elbows, then you get
upset.
"I lost my temper a couple of times on the
court. I've just gone after somebody, thrown
a few elbows and hit him in the head.
"In the Nevada-Reno game, the first game
of the season as a matter of fact, I got under
the basket, and a player was pushing me,
and he pushed me beyond the point, you
know, where he got me pretty upset, so I just
kind of swung around and hit him in the
side of the head with an elbow. Told him I
didn't appreciate it.
"A couple of guys stepped in between us.
It happened right at the end of the second
half. He was ready to come after me and a
couple of players stepped in.
'Practice frustrating'
"I've gone at it with a few players in prac
tice too. Practice gets frustrating sometimes,
the coach starts yelling at you and you start
trying to correct your mistakes. And some
body on the second team is pounding on
me, you know, and I just lose my temper,
man. It's a natural thing to do out there.
"Usually, Mark Fitzner (Stanford reserve)
guards me. Mark doesn't have any qualms
about using his elbows or his body. At this
point he outweighs me by about 10 pounds
so he pushes on me a lot. hangs on me a lot.
and 1 suppose I do the same to him.
"You try to stay pretty mellow. You talk to
him and say. well, let's just mellow out a bit
today and not beat on ea< h other. But when
thecoach starts screaming you find yourself
going at it a little harder, and before you
know it. you're at it again."

because of (first-year) coach (Dick) Dißiaso,
and possibly because of my role as team
captain, there's a little more dedication.
"I've always taken school pretty seri
ously. I've taken a few easy classes here and
there, you know, like any athlete, but I've
kept right up with the studies, and I spend a
lot of time studying, usually. Except for this
quarter."
On his future
"I can't believe how quickly these four
years have gone. I'd like to keep playing for
a while more. I'll take it on a year-to-year
basis. I'm still very enthusiastic about the
game. I'm still willing to work out hard and
play for. maybe, five more years. I'd like to
play in Italy because I knowa little Italian."
On his personality
"I find myself very conscientious about a
lot of things. I think I'm a pretty mellow
person. I tend to take things seriously a lot of
times and I don't really want to.
"Such as I tend to get far too involved in
basketball, sometimes, than I'd rather be. I
keep telling myself relax, try to relax a bit
more, and things will cornea little bit easier.
"And it's the same thing with school.
Most of the time I'm an easy-going person. I
don't get particularly excited about too
many things, particularly off the basketball
court. I'm pretty low key. I get frustrated and
aggressive but playing basketball is a good
outlet.
Introverted
"I'm basically an introvert. I'm not a real
rah-rah type, you know. As for my role of
team captain, I don't really come out there
gung-ho, screaming and all that.
"As I approach a game, and if I'm particu

larly nervous about it and really ready to
play. 1 won't say a word. And the more ready
1 am, the quieter I'll be.
"And sometimes, because the coach (Di-
Biaso) is an extrovert, our styles conflict.
He'll say, 'Come on Schweitzer, get up, get
up,' and I'll just be sitting there, not saying
anything. That's just the difference in the
two personalities. I think he (DiBiaso)
realizes that now. If I'm pretty loose, walk
ing around, talking, singing or doing what
ever, 1 know I'm not ready to play."
On his frustration
"I've had moments when I've been down.
I reached a point last Saturday night after

the Washington State game (the Cards lost
40-79, as Schweitzer scored seven points). I
didn't play well, we lost, I really wanted to
win that game.
"Losing, as much as people stress win
ning, and I think it should be stressed be
cause a lot of times it's really hard to lose, is
just a drag. You really get down about it.
You don't like to be called 'a loser.'
"It gets frustrating, and a lot of times,
particularly after a weekend where we've
lost games, I'll come out to practice and I'll
find myself doing things I normally
wouldn't do.
"I'll be a little more aggressive than I
should, throw a few elbows, here and there,
at guys who are my friends. Afterwards I'll
feel sorry for it, but at the time you have no
control. We've had days, in practice, where
the whole team real ly goes after each ot her.
On playing for a loser
"I'd rather not play as much and play for a
winner. It's nice to be. quote 'the star.' but I
really don't look at myself in those terms. I
just try to go out and do what will help the
team.
"I'd like to play for a team that's a winner.
I really dislike losing. The past few seasons
have been particularly frustrating, particu
larly in the sense that I felt we could do
better but we just didn't. Nobody seemed to
know why."
On fans recognizing him
"Once in awhile, I'll get something here
or there, a 'hello.' or 4 uood uame.' or some

thing. In the last two years, as people get
familiar with your face, and have seen you
play quite a few times, you find they just
start talking, or ask you a few questions
here or there. It's all right. I enjoy that.
"The things I don't like are the obnoxious
things, such as getting down on your
height. 'How's the weather up there?' that
kind of thing. I'll really give someone the
cold shoulder quick when they start giving
me that. People can be really annoying
sometimes."
On his temper
"My personality's pretty steady. I don't
vary too much. I'll get mad once ina while
about certain things, but I don't fly off the
handle. I can't recall ever getting really mad
except in a game. It gets to a point, in a
game, where some guy starts beating on
you, or starts throwing elbows, then you get
upset.
"I lost my temper a couple of times on the
court. I've just gone after somebody, thrown
a few elbows and hit him in the head.
"In the Nevada-Reno game, the first game
of the season as a matter of fact, I got under
the basket, and a player was pushing me,
and he pushed me beyond the point, you
know, where he got me pretty upset, so I just
kind of swung around and hit him in the
side of the head with an elbow. Told him I
didn't appreciate it.
"A couple of guys stepped in between us.
It happened right at the end of the second
half. He was ready to come after me and a
couple of players stepped in.
'Practice frustrating'
"I've gone at it with a few players in prac
tice too. Practice gets frustrating sometimes,
the coach starts yelling at you and you start
trying to correct your mistakes. And some
body on the second team is pounding on
me, you know, and I just lose my temper,
man. It's a natural thing to do out there.
"Usually, Mark Fitzner (Stanford reserve)
guards me. Mark doesn't have any qualms
about using his elbows or his body. At this
point he outweighs me by about 10 pounds
so he pushes on me a lot. hangs on me a lot.
and 1 suppose I do the same to him.
"You try to stay pretty mellow. You talk to
him and say. well, let's just mellow out a bit
today and not beat on ea< h other. But when
thecoach starts screaming you find yourself
going at it a little harder, and before you
know it. you're at it again."

On his personality
"I find myself very conscientious about a
lot of things. I think I'm a pretty mellow
person. I tend to take things seriously a lot of
times and I don't really want to.
"Such as I tend to get far too involved in
basketball, sometimes, than I'd rather be. I
keep telling myself relax, try to relax a bit
more, and things will cornea little bit easier.
"And it's the same thing with school.
Most of the time I'm an easy-going person. I
don't get particularly excited about too
many things, particularly off the basketball
court. I'm pretty low key. I get frustrated and
aggressive but playing basketball is a good
outlet.
Introverted
"I'm basically an introvert. I'm not a real
rah-rah type, you know. As for my role of
team captain, I don't really come out there
gung-ho, screaming and all that.
"As I approach a game, and if I'm particu

larly nervous about it and really ready to
play. 1 won't say a word. And the more ready
1 am, the quieter I'll be.
"And sometimes, because the coach (Di-
Biaso) is an extrovert, our styles conflict.
He'll say, 'Come on Schweitzer, get up, get
up,' and I'll just be sitting there, not saying
anything. That's just the difference in the
two personalities. I think he (DiBiaso)
realizes that now. If I'm pretty loose, walk
ing around, talking, singing or doing what
ever, 1 know I'm not ready to play."
On his frustration
"I've had moments when I've been down.
I reached a point last Saturday night after

the Washington State game (the Cards lost
40-79, as Schweitzer scored seven points). I
didn't play well, we lost, I really wanted to
win that game.
"Losing, as much as people stress win
ning, and I think it should be stressed be
cause a lot of times it's really hard to lose, is
just a drag. You really get down about it.
You don't like to be called 'a loser.'
"It gets frustrating, and a lot of times,
particularly after a weekend where we've
lost games, I'll come out to practice and I'll
find myself doing things I normally
wouldn't do.
"I'll be a little more aggressive than I
should, throw a few elbows, here and there,
at guys who are my friends. Afterwards I'll
feel sorry for it, but at the time you have no
control. We've had days, in practice, where
the whole team real ly goes after each ot her.
On playing for a loser
"I'd rather not play as much and play for a
winner. It's nice to be. quote 'the star.' but I
really don't look at myself in those terms. I
just try to go out and do what will help the
team.
"I'd like to play for a team that's a winner.
I really dislike losing. The past few seasons
have been particularly frustrating, particu
larly in the sense that I felt we could do
better but we just didn't. Nobody seemed to
know why."
On fans recognizing him
"Once in awhile, I'll get something here
or there, a 'hello.' or 4 uood uame.' or some

thing. In the last two years, as people get
familiar with your face, and have seen you
play quite a few times, you find they just
start talking, or ask you a few questions
here or there. It's all right. I enjoy that.
"The things I don't like are the obnoxious
things, such as getting down on your
height. 'How's the weather up there?' that
kind of thing. I'll really give someone the
cold shoulder quick when they start giving
me that. People can be really annoying
sometimes."
On his temper
"My personality's pretty steady. I don't
vary too much. I'll get mad once ina while
about certain things, but I don't fly off the
handle. I can't recall ever getting really mad
except in a game. It gets to a point, in a
game, where some guy starts beating on
you, or starts throwing elbows, then you get
upset.
"I lost my temper a couple of times on the
court. I've just gone after somebody, thrown
a few elbows and hit him in the head.
"In the Nevada-Reno game, the first game
of the season as a matter of fact, I got under
the basket, and a player was pushing me,
and he pushed me beyond the point, you
know, where he got me pretty upset, so I just
kind of swung around and hit him in the
side of the head with an elbow. Told him I
didn't appreciate it.
"A couple of guys stepped in between us.
It happened right at the end of the second
half. He was ready to come after me and a
couple of players stepped in.
'Practice frustrating'
"I've gone at it with a few players in prac
tice too. Practice gets frustrating sometimes,
the coach starts yelling at you and you start
trying to correct your mistakes. And some
body on the second team is pounding on
me, you know, and I just lose my temper,
man. It's a natural thing to do out there.
"Usually, Mark Fitzner (Stanford reserve)
guards me. Mark doesn't have any qualms
about using his elbows or his body. At this
point he outweighs me by about 10 pounds
so he pushes on me a lot. hangs on me a lot.
and 1 suppose I do the same to him.
"You try to stay pretty mellow. You talk to
him and say. well, let's just mellow out a bit

rah-rah type, you know. As for my role of
team captain, I don't really come out there
gung-ho, screaming and all that.
"As I approach a game, and if I'm particu

larly nervous about it and really ready to
play. 1 won't say a word. And the more ready
1 am, the quieter I'll be.
"And sometimes, because the coach (Di-
Biaso) is an extrovert, our styles conflict.
He'll say, 'Come on Schweitzer, get up, get
up,' and I'll just be sitting there, not saying
anything. That's just the difference in the
two personalities. I think he (DiBiaso)
realizes that now. If I'm pretty loose, walk
ing around, talking, singing or doing what
ever, 1 know I'm not ready to play."
On his frustration
"I've had moments when I've been down.
I reached a point last Saturday night after

the Washington State game (the Cards lost
40-79, as Schweitzer scored seven points). I
didn't play well, we lost, I really wanted to
win that game.
"Losing, as much as people stress win
ning, and I think it should be stressed be
cause a lot of times it's really hard to lose, is
just a drag. You really get down about it.
You don't like to be called 'a loser.'
"It gets frustrating, and a lot of times,
particularly after a weekend where we've
lost games, I'll come out to practice and I'll
find myself doing things I normally
wouldn't do.
"I'll be a little more aggressive than I
should, throw a few elbows, here and there,
at guys who are my friends. Afterwards I'll
feel sorry for it, but at the time you have no
control. We've had days, in practice, where
the whole team real ly goes after each ot her.
On playing for a loser
"I'd rather not play as much and play for a
winner. It's nice to be. quote 'the star.' but I
really don't look at myself in those terms. I
just try to go out and do what will help the
team.
"I'd like to play for a team that's a winner.
I really dislike losing. The past few seasons
have been particularly frustrating, particu
larly in the sense that I felt we could do
better but we just didn't. Nobody seemed to
know why."
On fans recognizing him
"Once in awhile, I'll get something here
or there, a 'hello.' or 4 uood uame.' or some

thing. In the last two years, as people get
familiar with your face, and have seen you
play quite a few times, you find they just
start talking, or ask you a few questions
here or there. It's all right. I enjoy that.
"The things I don't like are the obnoxious
things, such as getting down on your
height. 'How's the weather up there?' that
kind of thing. I'll really give someone the
cold shoulder quick when they start giving
me that. People can be really annoying
sometimes."
On his temper
"My personality's pretty steady. I don't
vary too much. I'll get mad once ina while
about certain things, but I don't fly off the
handle. I can't recall ever getting really mad
except in a game. It gets to a point, in a
game, where some guy starts beating on
you, or starts throwing elbows, then you get
upset.
"I lost my temper a couple of times on the
court. I've just gone after somebody, thrown
a few elbows and hit him in the head.
"In the Nevada-Reno game, the first game
of the season as a matter of fact, I got under
the basket, and a player was pushing me,
and he pushed me beyond the point, you
know, where he got me pretty upset, so I just
kind of swung around and hit him in the
side of the head with an elbow. Told him I
didn't appreciate it.
"A couple of guys stepped in between us.
It happened right at the end of the second
half. He was ready to come after me and a
couple of players stepped in.
'Practice frustrating'
"I've gone at it with a few players in prac
tice too. Practice gets frustrating sometimes,
the coach starts yelling at you and you start
trying to correct your mistakes. And some
body on the second team is pounding on
me, you know, and I just lose my temper,
man. It's a natural thing to do out there.
"Usually, Mark Fitzner (Stanford reserve)
guards me. Mark doesn't have any qualms
about using his elbows or his body. At this
point he outweighs me by about 10 pounds
so he pushes on me a lot. hangs on me a lot.
and 1 suppose I do the same to him.
"You try to stay pretty mellow. You talk to
him and say. well, let's just mellow out a bit
today and not beat on ea< h other. But when
thecoach starts screaming you find yourself
going at it a little harder, and before you
know it. you're at it again."

Ed Schweitzer perches nervously on the
edge of his bed. He talks quietly, leaning
forward to touch his feet, then rocking hack
to grasp his knees. His features are as ani
mated as his voice, his brown eyes widen
ing to punctuate his comments. He moves
easily from one subject to another, talking
about basketball's role in his life.
"1 started playing in ninth grade. I needed
a little pushing. Once I started playing, the
interest built as I improved. I wound up
playing every day and it was taking up
every minute of my life. It's been that way
ever since."
On academics
"1 rate basketball and school pretty even.
They both involve a lot of time. I probably
put more time this year into basketball than
1 have the preceding two years. Possibly,
because of (first-year) coach (Dick) Dißiaso,
and possibly because of my role as team
captain, there's a little more dedication.
"I've always taken school pretty seri
ously. I've taken a few easy classes here and
there, you know, like any athlete, but I've
kept right up with the studies, and I spend a
lot of time studying, usually. Except for this
quarter."
On his future
"I can't believe how quickly these four
years have gone. I'd like to keep playing for
a while more. I'll take it on a year-to-year
basis. I'm still very enthusiastic about the
game. I'm still willing to work out hard and
play for. maybe, five more years. I'd like to
play in Italy because I knowa little Italian."
On his personality
"I find myself very conscientious about a
lot of things. I think I'm a pretty mellow
person. I tend to take things seriously a lot of
times and I don't really want to.
"Such as I tend to get far too involved in
basketball, sometimes, than I'd rather be. I
keep telling myself relax, try to relax a bit
more, and things will cornea little bit easier.
"And it's the same thing with school.
Most of the time I'm an easy-going person. I
don't get particularly excited about too
many things, particularly off the basketball
court. I'm pretty low key. I get frustrated and
aggressive but playing basketball is a good
outlet.
