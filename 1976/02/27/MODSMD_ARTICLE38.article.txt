# Card tracksters open season
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
With an abundance of ability
in the distance events, but a
paucity of depth in most of the
remaining events, Stanford's
track and field team begins its
197b season tomorrow against
Hayward State. The Cards travel
to Hayward for an 11 a.m. meet
against the Pioneers.
"With everyone healthy, we'll
have a better dual meet team
than we've had the past four
years," track coach Payton Jor
dan says. Hut pointing to Stan
ford's lack of depth in many
events, Jordan adds, "We'll have
to hustle for points in every dual
meet we're in."
The Cardinals' corps of dis
tance men will be the backbone
of the team this year. Heading
the talented group of distance
runners will be seniors Tony
Sandoval and Jack Bellah.
International meet
Sandoval, presently in Wales
for tomorrow's International
Cross-Country Championships,
holds the team's top marks in
every event over one mile except
the steeplechase. Included in
those times are an 8:49.2 two
mile and a 28:43.2 six-mile.
Bellah, a top-notch man in the
steeplechase and cross country,
was seventh in the six-mile at
last year's Pacific Eight meet.
Other returnees in the dis
tance events include Steve
Crowley, Jeff Parietti, Stacy
Oeiken and Doug McLean.
Crowley's services in the mile
will not be available until next
month when he returns from
Stanford-in-Hritain. Parietti is
the only Cardinal to have met a
Pac-8 qualifying mark this sea
son with a 13:50.8 three-mile
earlier this month. Geiken set
Stanford frosh marks in the
two-mile and steeplechase last
year.
Freshman Roy Kissin, also in
Wales this week for the world
championships, Harold Celms
and Jerry Emory will all have
their sights set on Geiken's frosh
marks during the season.
Hurdle talent
Matt Hogsett and John Foster
provide the Cardinals with ex
cellent individual talent in the
hurdles. Hogsett won the Pac-8
440 intermediate title last year
and Foster has a best of 13.9 in
the 120 highs.
In the other track events, Mark
Hadley heads Stanford's half
milers, while incoming
freshman Paul McCarthy will do
double duty in the 880- and
440-yard dashes. Junior Marvin
Holmes leads Cardinal sprinters
with bests of 9.7 in the 100 and
21.4 in the 220.
Sophomore James Lofton, who
finished ninth in tlie 1975 NCAA
outdoor long jump and second

against the Russian junior team,
will carry a big burden in the
long jump and the triple jump
for the Cardinals.
Pole vault
Hob Flint, former California JC
titlist, is Stanford's hope in the
pole vault. Flint cleared 16-0 in
the team trials two weeks ago.
With a best of 218-9, senior John
Macrorie remains Stanford's
only threat in the javelin.
Stanford has two freshmen
challenging upperclassmen for
supremacy in the weight events.
Urad Slinkard, fourth in the state
and sixth in the nation in the
shot put as a prep last year, cap
tured the event in the recent
team meet, while freshman
teammate DougCreenwood won
the discus. The youngsters will
be competing with the veterans
John Olenchalk, Mark Hill and
Rich Merlo, all of whom see
double duty in the fall as mem
bers of the football team.
Tomorrow will be Stanford's
first meeting with Hay ward
State. Coach Jordan says, "We
expect a close meet. They are
very sUrong in the sprints and
jumps, and quite strong in the
weights."
The Cards, who finished their
1975 dual meet season with a 2-4
mark, were last in the conference
meet last year. Stanford did not
win a conference dual meet last
year. Jordan is also limited by the
fact that he is not able to offer as
many track scholarships as other
Pac-8 schools. The conference is
perhaps the strongest in the na
tion.

OFF TO WALES—Stanford distancemai Tony Sandoval won't be
running for the Cards when they open their 1976 dual meet season
tomorrow morning at 11 against Hay ward State. Sandoval and
teammate Roy Kissin will he in Wales for the International cross
country Championships.
With an abundance of ability
in the distance events, but a
paucity of depth in most of the
remaining events, Stanford's
track and field team begins its
197b season tomorrow against
Hayward State. The Cards travel
to Hayward for an 11 a.m. meet
against the Pioneers.
"With everyone healthy, we'll
have a better dual meet team
than we've had the past four
years," track coach Payton Jor
dan says. Hut pointing to Stan
ford's lack of depth in many
events, Jordan adds, "We'll have
to hustle for points in every dual
meet we're in."
The Cardinals' corps of dis
tance men will be the backbone
of the team this year. Heading
the talented group of distance
runners will be seniors Tony
Sandoval and Jack Bellah.
International meet
Sandoval, presently in Wales
for tomorrow's International
Cross-Country Championships,
holds the team's top marks in
every event over one mile except
the steeplechase. Included in
those times are an 8:49.2 two
mile and a 28:43.2 six-mile.
Bellah, a top-notch man in the
steeplechase and cross country,
was seventh in the six-mile at
last year's Pacific Eight meet.
Other returnees in the dis
tance events include Steve
Crowley, Jeff Parietti, Stacy
Oeiken and Doug McLean.
Crowley's services in the mile
will not be available until next
month when he returns from
Stanford-in-Hritain. Parietti is
the only Cardinal to have met a
Pac-8 qualifying mark this sea
son with a 13:50.8 three-mile
earlier this month. Geiken set
Stanford frosh marks in the
two-mile and steeplechase last
year.
Freshman Roy Kissin, also in
Wales this week for the world
championships, Harold Celms
and Jerry Emory will all have
their sights set on Geiken's frosh
marks during the season.
Hurdle talent
Matt Hogsett and John Foster
provide the Cardinals with ex
cellent individual talent in the
hurdles. Hogsett won the Pac-8
440 intermediate title last year
and Foster has a best of 13.9 in
the 120 highs.
In the other track events, Mark
Hadley heads Stanford's half
milers, while incoming
freshman Paul McCarthy will do
double duty in the 880- and
440-yard dashes. Junior Marvin
Holmes leads Cardinal sprinters
with bests of 9.7 in the 100 and
21.4 in the 220.
Sophomore James Lofton, who
finished ninth in tlie 1975 NCAA
outdoor long jump and second

against the Russian junior team,
will carry a big burden in the
long jump and the triple jump
for the Cardinals.
Pole vault
Hob Flint, former California JC
titlist, is Stanford's hope in the
pole vault. Flint cleared 16-0 in
the team trials two weeks ago.
With a best of 218-9, senior John
Macrorie remains Stanford's
only threat in the javelin.
Stanford has two freshmen
challenging upperclassmen for
supremacy in the weight events.
Urad Slinkard, fourth in the state
and sixth in the nation in the
shot put as a prep last year, cap
tured the event in the recent
team meet, while freshman
teammate DougCreenwood won
the discus. The youngsters will
be competing with the veterans
John Olenchalk, Mark Hill and
Rich Merlo, all of whom see
double duty in the fall as mem
bers of the football team.
Tomorrow will be Stanford's
first meeting with Hay ward
State. Coach Jordan says, "We
expect a close meet. They are
very sUrong in the sprints and
jumps, and quite strong in the
weights."
The Cards, who finished their
1975 dual meet season with a 2-4
mark, were last in the conference
meet last year. Stanford did not
win a conference dual meet last
year. Jordan is also limited by the
fact that he is not able to offer as
many track scholarships as other

Tomorrow will be Stanford's
first meeting with Hay ward
State. Coach Jordan says, "We
expect a close meet. They are
very sUrong in the sprints and
jumps, and quite strong in the
weights."
The Cards, who finished their
1975 dual meet season with a 2-4
mark, were last in the conference
meet last year. Stanford did not
win a conference dual meet last
year. Jordan is also limited by the
fact that he is not able to offer as
many track scholarships as other
Pac-8 schools. The conference is
perhaps the strongest in the na
tion.
