SAN FRANCISCO (Al») — The
judge, attorneys and two witnesses in
Patricia Hearst's bank robbery trial
were threatened with death yesterday
in a communique purportedly from
the Symbionese Liberation Army
(SLA).
Charles Hates, special agent in
charge of the FBI office here, said there
was "no way we can tell if they are
legitimate, hut being a death threat
against specific persons weadvised all
the people involved."
Copies of the message wer<; received
by a newspaper and two radio stations
in the San Francisco Hay area.
The chief prosecutor in Hearst's
trial, US Atty. )ames browning Jr.,
laughed off the threat, saying: "1 hope
they don't shoot me before the final
arguments."
I Jpon hearing of the threat, chief de
fense attorney F. Lee Bailey com
mented, "Very interesting."
Bates said the last known authentic

communication from I lie SLA, tlx; tiny
band of terrorists t h<it kidnaped Hearst
on Feb. 4. 1U74, was June H. 1<)74.
The five-paragraph communique
received yesterday said in part:
"This so-called trial is nothing more
than an act, a sexist plot engineered by
the corporate state against the people.
Carter, Hailev, Browning, Matthews
and Shepard have sealed their fate.
The Symbionese Liberation Army wiII
not be mocked, .ill those mentioned
above shall die."
U.S. District Court Judge Oliver (bar
ter is presiding ofter Hearst's trial.
Thomas Matthews and Anthony
Shepard testified about Los Angeles
activities of Hearst and SLA members
William and Emily Harris.
Meanwhile, at the I learst trial in San
Francisco, a defense psychiatrist tes
tified that I learst was "the only private
in an army of generals." I le theorized
that had shetruly joined theSl.A,"she
would have insisted on a promotion,"
said Martin Orne.
The University of Pennsylvania
psychiatrist told jurors at Hearst's
bank robbery trial that "if this was
someone who really joined them, it
doesn't make sense that she stayed a
private.
"It would have been much more im
pressive," he added with a smile, "if
Col. Hearst had done a tape recording
rather than Miss Hearst."
The pudgy, mustachioed Orne,
speaking with a slight Viennese ac
cent, was the second psychiatrist cal
led by defense attorney F. Lee Hailey to
support Hearst's own witness stand
account of her captivity. She is ac
cused of joining the SLA in a bank
robbery 10 weeks after she was kid
napped on Feb. 4, 1 *>74.

was "no way we can tell if they are
legitimate, hut being a death threat
against specific persons weadvised all
the people involved."
Copies of the message wer<; received
by a newspaper and two radio stations
in the San Francisco Hay area.
The chief prosecutor in Hearst's
trial, US Atty. )ames browning Jr.,
laughed off the threat, saying: "1 hope
they don't shoot me before the final
arguments."
I Jpon hearing of the threat, chief de
fense attorney F. Lee Bailey com
mented, "Very interesting."
Bates said the last known authentic

communication from I lie SLA, tlx; tiny
band of terrorists t h<it kidnaped Hearst
on Feb. 4. 1U74, was June H. 1<)74.
The five-paragraph communique
received yesterday said in part:
"This so-called trial is nothing more
than an act, a sexist plot engineered by
the corporate state against the people.
Carter, Hailev, Browning, Matthews
and Shepard have sealed their fate.
The Symbionese Liberation Army wiII
not be mocked, .ill those mentioned
above shall die."

ter is presiding ofter Hearst's trial.
Thomas Matthews and Anthony
Shepard testified about Los Angeles
activities of Hearst and SLA members
William and Emily Harris.
Meanwhile, at the I learst trial in San
Francisco, a defense psychiatrist tes
tified that I learst was "the only private
in an army of generals." I le theorized
that had shetruly joined theSl.A,"she
would have insisted on a promotion,"
said Martin Orne.
The University of Pennsylvania
psychiatrist told jurors at Hearst's
bank robbery trial that "if this was
someone who really joined them, it
doesn't make sense that she stayed a
private.
"It would have been much more im
pressive," he added with a smile, "if
Col. Hearst had done a tape recording
rather than Miss Hearst."
The pudgy, mustachioed Orne,
speaking with a slight Viennese ac
cent, was the second psychiatrist cal
led by defense attorney F. Lee Hailey to
support Hearst's own witness stand
account of her captivity. She is ac
cused of joining the SLA in a bank
robbery 10 weeks after she was kid
napped on Feb. 4, 1 *>74.
