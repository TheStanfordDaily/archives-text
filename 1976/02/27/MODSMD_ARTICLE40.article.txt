Tom Duralde plays volleyball.
Last summer he was asked to try
out for the U.S. national team —
a team destined for the 1980
Olympics.
He is one of the two primary
hitters on Stanford's volleyball
team. But the Robber Baron vol
leyball team is in its infant stage,
and it is hard for Stanford to
compete with the southern
California powerhouses like
UCLA and UC-Santa Barbara.
"If 1 were at one of those
schools there would be more
guys at my level and it would
give me an incentive to improve.
It's hard playing on a team where
the guys haven't had much ex
perience."
Duralde,junior from Fuller
ton, has been playing volleyball
seriously since his senior year in
high school, but many of the
members of this year's Barons
have had little or no experience
other than playing volleyball at
the beach.
Fundamentals
But Duralde is willing to help
his teammates work on funda
mentals because he was a begin
ner once. When Duralde decided
to play for Stanford this season,
he knew he would be joining a
young team.
Last year he represented the
San Francisco Olympic Club
rather than playing for the Ba
rons. The Olympic Club is com
prised of players who range from
20 to 35 in age.
"I have a lot more responsibil
ity this year. Last year 1 didn't set
for the Olympic Club. This year
I'm setting and hitting strong
side. People will be learning
from me and hopefully I'll be
able to get the team going,
whereas last year, with the
Olympic Club.l was the youngest
guy on the team and was learn
ing from the others."
New status
Stanford's volleyball team has
received Varsity Club status this
year. One of the reasons Duralde
rejoined the team this year was
because the Barons have a coach
for the first time.
Art Lambert, who also coaches
the Stanford waterpoloteam, has
taken on the volleyball duties.
Duralde said that Lambert's pre
sence has made the players put
forth more effort. Practices are
more intense, and the team is
progressing rapidly.
"Compared to freshman year it
seems more like a real team. Now
we practice five days a week —
we didn't freshman year. But
when you're playing teams that

practice tive days a week you ve
got toalso. or you'll get blown off
the court."
Growing sport
Volleyball is a growing sport
in the U.S., and southern
California is where most of the
action is. Duralde said many
people think that the game is
easy, casual and undemanding.
"Volleyball players are
stereotyped. People say. 'Vol
leyball. that's what the girls
used to play in gym class. Sure, I
know how to play volleyball.
You just hit it over the net.' And
then they crawl and climb .ill
over it. There are others who say
volleyball players are all beach
bums."
Duralde. a premed, explained
that being 011 the volleyball team
helps him structure his time, and
it also serves as an emotional
outlet. "You can get so wrapped
up in school work that you need
a sport to totally involve you rself
in. 1 like volleyball because it's a
team sport but there is a personal
element to it.
Every set a thrill
"When you're hitting you've
got to beat the blocker. Once you
get the set, it's up to you to de

cide what you're going to do
with it." said Duralde. "You've
got to go over the other team,
around them, or past them some
way. Every set, spike or dig is a
thrill."
Volleyball is a fast game. A
moment's lapse in concentration
can cost a team several points.
"You have to be mentally keyed
but you have to be flexible and
ready for anything," he said. "It
you're too loose, the ball just
whizzes by. If you're too tight,
you end up hitting it into the
bleachers."
Duralde said he isn't satisfied
with his level of concentration.
"Last weekend we played a
couple of weak teams, and even
though we won both matches,we
didn't play very well. I let my
concentration down and played
down to the level of the teams we
played. If they play sloppy, we
do too."
The Barons have not been pas
sing well lately. The setter must
receive a good pass up the mid
dle in order for the offense to
run its plays. "We're putting the
ball high on the outside and
you've got to run to get under the
ball. Then you can't run plays."
