drew criticism from diplomats but fan mail from
Americans.

the United Nations to run for office, but since then
some backers have pushed his candidacy.

the world like to be."
Judge blocks postal closing
WASHINGTON — A federal judge yesterday
blocked the Postal Service from closing small post
offices to save money.
U.S. District Court Judge John Lewis Smith is
sued a temporary restraining order against the
Postal Service several hours after 44 members of
Congress filed suit against the agency.
I lie Postal Service said the order would result in
a loss of about $5500 and a day. Smith will decide
whether to end the order or make it permanent at a
hearing on March 3.
So far about 180 post offices operating at a deficit
have been closed and about 600 others are under
scrutiny- The judge's decision stops any further
closures.
The financially troubled Postal Service says it
can save millions of dollars per year without hurt
ing mail service by closing rural post offices. When
the agency closes one of its small post offices, it
replaces it with rural route delivery on contracts
with a local citizen to carry on post office functions
as a part-time enteprise.

Ford urges action on energy
WASHINGTON — With energy issues partly re
solved by a two-month-old law, President Ford yes
terday urged Congress to get on with the unfinished
business of achieving national energy indepen
dence.
In a special message to Congress. Ford proposed
two new measures:
—legislation setting deadlines for federal pro
cessing of pipeline projects to bring natural gas
from northern Alaska to the "lower 48 states and
allowing the President to select a pipeline route
subject to congressional approval;
—a proposal to limit imports of liquified natural
gas to no more than one trillion cubic feet per year
by 1905, a measure requiring specific legislation;
little liquified natural gas is now imported but vari
ous projects have been approved or proposed.
Ford also made a strong request that Congress
enact bis remaining legislative proposals.
He especially urged passage of a bill to end fed
eral price regulation of natural gas.
Longer FEC term asked
WASHINGTON — Public interest groups asked
the Supreme Court yesterday to permit the illegally
constituted Federal Elections Commission to con
tinue operating for 30 more days.
The groups said legislation to restructure the
commission and make it comply with the law "is
progressing rapidly through Congress. If the court
extends the stay for an additional 30 days, we be
lieve the Congress will be able to complete its ac
tion within that period."
If the court fails to grant the extension the FEC
will cease awarding federal matching presidential
campaign funds at midnight Monday.
The justices gave no indication when they would
act. They meet today for one of their regularly
scheduled closed conferences.
Congress was not expected to pass legislation
before the deadline.
The public interest groups cited Maryland and
Georgia reapportionment cases to bolster their ar
gument that the court has authority to permit the
FEC to continue functioning.
Allowing the commission to die "would obvi
ously have a serious and adverse impact on candi
dates" in the presidential primaries in Mas
sachusetts and Vermont on March 2; Florida,
March 9; Illinois, March 16; and North Carolina,
March 23, the groups said.
Kidnapers release officials
ATHENS, Greece — A feast of smoked salmon
medallions of veal, red wine and champagne was

served over the Mediterranean yesterday to two
U.S. officials who were held in Lebanon for four
months by kidnapers who fed them only bread,
rice, eggs, yogurt and cheese.
The two officials — Charles Gallagher, 44, of
Roanoke, Va . and William Dykes, 50, of San Jose,
Calif. — ialxv had tearful reunions with their wives
in Athens and were greeted by American
youngsters waving flowers.
Gallagher and Dykes were abducted during
Lebanon's civil war and were held captive in
4-by-9-foot cells. They were flown to Athens in a
commercial jetliner after their release in Beirut late
Wednesday.
The two dug in with gusto when their meal was
brought to thern in the jetliner's first-class cabin
soon after leaving Beirut. Asked whether it beat the
food they had as captives, Dykes, between bites of
salmon,raised his fingers in a V-for-victory signal.
"We are all right, no big problems," said Gal
lagher. "But at some times we thought we just
wouldn't make it." He said he had lost 14 pounds.
Dykes also lost weight during the ordeal but said he
was not mistreated.
House panel cuts foreign aid
WASHINGTON — A House subcommittee cut
$55 million from U.S. contributions to a lending
program for poor nations because the money is not
used wisely and the United States cannot afford it,
the panel chairman says.
Officials of the World Bank and the U.S. Treasury
Department said the action could jeopardize the
program. The World Bank has used such contribu
tions in education, agriculture, transportation and
industry in the world's poorest nations.
The cut was made in a closed session last week by
the subcommittee on foreign operations of the
House Appropriations Committee. The cut was
confirmed yesterday by the panel's chairman, Rep.
Otto Passman (D-La.).
"There's just a limit as to how far we can let these
international organizations go," Passman said inan
interview. His panel cut the U.S. contribution to the
bank's International Development Association to
$.520 million for 1976 from a previously authorized
$375 million.

Kidnapers release officials
ATHENS, Greece — A feast of smoked salmon
medallions of veal, red wine and champagne was

served over the Mediterranean yesterday to two
U.S. officials who were held in Lebanon for four
months by kidnapers who fed them only bread,
rice, eggs, yogurt and cheese.
The two officials — Charles Gallagher, 44, of
Roanoke, Va . and William Dykes, 50, of San Jose,
Calif. — ialxv had tearful reunions with their wives
in Athens and were greeted by American
youngsters waving flowers.
Gallagher and Dykes were abducted during
Lebanon's civil war and were held captive in
4-by-9-foot cells. They were flown to Athens in a
commercial jetliner after their release in Beirut late
Wednesday.
The two dug in with gusto when their meal was
brought to thern in the jetliner's first-class cabin
soon after leaving Beirut. Asked whether it beat the
food they had as captives, Dykes, between bites of
salmon,raised his fingers in a V-for-victory signal.
"We are all right, no big problems," said Gal
lagher. "But at some times we thought we just
wouldn't make it." He said he had lost 14 pounds.
Dykes also lost weight during the ordeal but said he
was not mistreated.
House panel cuts foreign aid
WASHINGTON — A House subcommittee cut
$55 million from U.S. contributions to a lending
program for poor nations because the money is not

the subcommittee on foreign operations of the
House Appropriations Committee. The cut was
confirmed yesterday by the panel's chairman, Rep.

"There's just a limit as to how far we can let these
international organizations go," Passman said inan
interview. His panel cut the U.S. contribution to the
bank's International Development Association to
$.520 million for 1976 from a previously authorized
$375 million.

Judge blocks postal closing
WASHINGTON — A federal judge yesterday
blocked the Postal Service from closing small post
offices to save money.
U.S. District Court Judge John Lewis Smith is
sued a temporary restraining order against the
Postal Service several hours after 44 members of
Congress filed suit against the agency.
I lie Postal Service said the order would result in
a loss of about $5500 and a day. Smith will decide
whether to end the order or make it permanent at a
hearing on March 3.
So far about 180 post offices operating at a deficit
have been closed and about 600 others are under
scrutiny- The judge's decision stops any further
closures.
The financially troubled Postal Service says it
can save millions of dollars per year without hurt
ing mail service by closing rural post offices. When
the agency closes one of its small post offices, it
replaces it with rural route delivery on contracts
with a local citizen to carry on post office functions
as a part-time enteprise.

Judge blocks postal closing
WASHINGTON — A federal judge yesterday
blocked the Postal Service from closing small post
offices to save money.
U.S. District Court Judge John Lewis Smith is
sued a temporary restraining order against the
Postal Service several hours after 44 members of
Congress filed suit against the agency.
I lie Postal Service said the order would result in
a loss of about $5500 and a day. Smith will decide
whether to end the order or make it permanent at a
hearing on March 3.
So far about 180 post offices operating at a deficit
have been closed and about 600 others are under
scrutiny- The judge's decision stops any further
closures.
The financially troubled Postal Service says it
can save millions of dollars per year without hurt
ing mail service by closing rural post offices. When
the agency closes one of its small post offices, it
replaces it with rural route delivery on contracts
with a local citizen to carry on post office functions
as a part-time enteprise.

Ford urges action on energy
WASHINGTON — With energy issues partly re
solved by a two-month-old law, President Ford yes
terday urged Congress to get on with the unfinished
business of achieving national energy indepen
dence.
In a special message to Congress. Ford proposed
two new measures:
—legislation setting deadlines for federal pro
cessing of pipeline projects to bring natural gas
from northern Alaska to the "lower 48 states and
allowing the President to select a pipeline route
subject to congressional approval;
—a proposal to limit imports of liquified natural
gas to no more than one trillion cubic feet per year
by 1905, a measure requiring specific legislation;
little liquified natural gas is now imported but vari
ous projects have been approved or proposed.
Ford also made a strong request that Congress
enact bis remaining legislative proposals.
He especially urged passage of a bill to end fed
eral price regulation of natural gas.
Longer FEC term asked
WASHINGTON — Public interest groups asked
the Supreme Court yesterday to permit the illegally
constituted Federal Elections Commission to con
tinue operating for 30 more days.
The groups said legislation to restructure the
commission and make it comply with the law "is
progressing rapidly through Congress. If the court
extends the stay for an additional 30 days, we be
lieve the Congress will be able to complete its ac
tion within that period."
If the court fails to grant the extension the FEC
will cease awarding federal matching presidential
campaign funds at midnight Monday.
The justices gave no indication when they would
act. They meet today for one of their regularly
scheduled closed conferences.
Congress was not expected to pass legislation
before the deadline.
The public interest groups cited Maryland and
Georgia reapportionment cases to bolster their ar
gument that the court has authority to permit the
FEC to continue functioning.
Allowing the commission to die "would obvi
ously have a serious and adverse impact on candi
dates" in the presidential primaries in Mas
sachusetts and Vermont on March 2; Florida,
March 9; Illinois, March 16; and North Carolina,
March 23, the groups said.
Kidnapers release officials
ATHENS, Greece — A feast of smoked salmon
medallions of veal, red wine and champagne was

served over the Mediterranean yesterday to two
U.S. officials who were held in Lebanon for four
months by kidnapers who fed them only bread,
rice, eggs, yogurt and cheese.
The two officials — Charles Gallagher, 44, of
Roanoke, Va . and William Dykes, 50, of San Jose,
Calif. — ialxv had tearful reunions with their wives
in Athens and were greeted by American
youngsters waving flowers.
Gallagher and Dykes were abducted during
Lebanon's civil war and were held captive in
4-by-9-foot cells. They were flown to Athens in a
commercial jetliner after their release in Beirut late
Wednesday.
The two dug in with gusto when their meal was
brought to thern in the jetliner's first-class cabin
soon after leaving Beirut. Asked whether it beat the
food they had as captives, Dykes, between bites of
salmon,raised his fingers in a V-for-victory signal.
"We are all right, no big problems," said Gal
lagher. "But at some times we thought we just
wouldn't make it." He said he had lost 14 pounds.
Dykes also lost weight during the ordeal but said he
was not mistreated.
House panel cuts foreign aid
WASHINGTON — A House subcommittee cut
$55 million from U.S. contributions to a lending
program for poor nations because the money is not
used wisely and the United States cannot afford it,

"There's just a limit as to how far we can let these
international organizations go," Passman said inan

bank's International Development Association to
$.520 million for 1976 from a previously authorized
$375 million.

Roanoke, Va . and William Dykes, 50, of San Jose,
Calif. — ialxv had tearful reunions with their wives
in Athens and were greeted by American
youngsters waving flowers.
Gallagher and Dykes were abducted during
Lebanon's civil war and were held captive in
4-by-9-foot cells. They were flown to Athens in a
commercial jetliner after their release in Beirut late
Wednesday.
The two dug in with gusto when their meal was
brought to thern in the jetliner's first-class cabin
soon after leaving Beirut. Asked whether it beat the
food they had as captives, Dykes, between bites of
salmon,raised his fingers in a V-for-victory signal.
"We are all right, no big problems," said Gal
lagher. "But at some times we thought we just
wouldn't make it." He said he had lost 14 pounds.
Dykes also lost weight during the ordeal but said he
was not mistreated.
House panel cuts foreign aid
WASHINGTON — A House subcommittee cut
$55 million from U.S. contributions to a lending
program for poor nations because the money is not
used wisely and the United States cannot afford it,
the panel chairman says.
Officials of the World Bank and the U.S. Treasury
Department said the action could jeopardize the
program. The World Bank has used such contribu
tions in education, agriculture, transportation and
industry in the world's poorest nations.
The cut was made in a closed session last week by
the subcommittee on foreign operations of the
House Appropriations Committee. The cut was
confirmed yesterday by the panel's chairman, Rep.
Otto Passman (D-La.).
"There's just a limit as to how far we can let these
international organizations go," Passman said inan
interview. His panel cut the U.S. contribution to the
bank's International Development Association to
$.520 million for 1976 from a previously authorized
$375 million.
