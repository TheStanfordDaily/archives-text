# Capital punishment, called 'deadly game'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (Al>) — Capital
punishment was condemned as a
"deadly game of blind man's bluff"
yesterday by attorneys for six con
victed murderers whose appeals the
Supreme Court will hear next month.
Arguments in the cases, scheduled
for March 30 and HI, will set the stage
for the court's first ruling on the death
penalty since it struck down capital
punishment four years ago.
At that time, the court ruled that
existing laws gave judges and juries
too much leeway in determining
which persons should die and which
should not on conviction of the same
crimes.

Amsterdam will serve as a defense
counsel. Amsterdam also served as
counsel inFuhrmun v.Coorgio (1U72),
the landmark case in which the Sup
reme Court struck down nil existing
state death penalties.
The men whose appends the court
has agreed to hear are among more
than 400 persons condemned to death

since 1!>72. The death sentences were
handed down under new laws passed
by :$4 states that were designed to
eliminate Supreme Court objections to
previous laws.
Their lawyers told t ho court that the
new lawsare just as arbitrary as the old
ones, il not more so.
They asked the court to condemn
capital punishment as "an ancient
exercise in savagery" and a constitu
tionally prohibited cruel and unusual
punishment.
But, il the court is unwilling to go
this tar, they argued, it must at least
strike down the live state laws under
which the condemned men were sen
tenced.
Those laws — passed by the legisla
tures of Honda, Ccorgia, North
Carolina, Texas and Louisiana — are
typical of the ones enacted since the
court's 1072 ruling. They either make
the penalty mandatory for certain
crimes or provide guidelines for its
imposition.
