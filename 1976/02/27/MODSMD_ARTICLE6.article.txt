# Palo Alto schools offer educational alternatives
## 
### Janet Gendler 
"Traditional ly, people thought all schools were alike
and all teachers did the same thing. People don't think
all dentists are alike," says James Mathiott, principal of
Ohlone Elementary School in Palo Alto. "You can
choose your dentist. Why not choose your school?"
In Palo Alto parents can choose between two alterna
tive public schools. Ohlone. the open school, stresses
informal education, the joy of learning and individual
choice.
Hoover Elementary School, the more structured al
ternative school, lists its four priorities as the "acquisi
tion of basic academic ski lis in a sequential manner, the
development of a quiet, orderly classroom atmosphere
and the quantitative measurement of student progress
through testing and grades."
Not new
The idea of alternative schools is not new. The cur
rent interest developed in the'6os as several educa
tional reformers cried out against the rigidity of the
schools and the authority of the teacher. Charles Si I -
berman's book Crisis in the Classroom, published in
1 described the open classroom in England's infant
schools. In America, private alternative schools flo
wered, followed by alternatives to public school.
Mathiott comments that there is no way of knowing
exactly how many open classrooms and schools there
are in the I I.S. now "because we do not have a national
organization like the Progressive Education Associa
tion which existed in the 30's." Every state has some
open education programs but New York, North Dakota
and Vermont took a particularly strong interest in
the informal approach.
Mathiott defines informal education at Ohlone by
comparing it to three things: a smorgasbord full of
choices, a good summer camp where children are
active and purposeful and a warm family whose

members respect each other. i
According to traditional educational standards, the i
open approach works at Oh lone. Kuthe l.undy, coor- [
dinator for elementary education in the I'alo Alto tin- '
ified School District, reports that Oh lone students doas [
well or better on standardized tests than other I'alo Alto £
studems their ago. Mathiott notes that they excel in [
areas that are different to lest like decision-making and [
accepting responsibility.
The variety of classroom decor at ()hlone reflects the r
emphasis on choice. The arrangement ol lofts, solas, [-
tables, desks, pillows, rugsand art work creates several t
environments within one room and makes each room [
unique. One of the key ideas of the open school
philosophy is to provide children with an interesting r
environment which stimulates learning.
Within this environment students do many activities t
simultaneously. During a recess period, a girl is (
stretched out on a couch absorbed in a book while her \
friends play marbles nearby. Mathiott says that it sur- i
prises parents to see their children work in such a busy 112
atmosphere but "today's children live in a noisy
world," Students are accustomed to seeing visitors and i
parents who do volunteer work at the school.
Quiet and orderly
At I loover the classrooms arc quiet and orderly. VV.il 112
lace Clark, principal ot Hoover School, said hy main-
taining a quiet roOm, a child with a learning disability L
is given a chance to pay attention. "The gilteil student 5
has more of the teacher's time si nee i I is not taken up by J;
behavior problems."
Behavior standards for the classroom, playground |
and lunch room stress courtesy, promptness and 112
obedience. "It is my belief that children are looking lor t
standards," ('lark comments. "I I ere, children know I he F
limits and work within them."


SCHOOL HAZE—PaIo Alio parents may now choose be
tween the traditional or the innovative in their children's
elementary education. Hoover Elementary offers the

offering an alternative.
