# Palo Alto schools offer educational alternatives
## 
### Janet Gendler 
"Traditional ly, people thought all schools were alike
and all teachers did the same thing. People don't think
all dentists are alike," says James Mathiott, principal of
Ohlone Elementary School in Palo Alto. "You can
choose your dentist. Why not choose your school?"
In Palo Alto parents can choose between two alterna
tive public schools. Ohlone. the open school, stresses
informal education, the joy of learning and individual
choice.
Hoover Elementary School, the more structured al
ternative school, lists its four priorities as the "acquisi
tion of basic academic ski lis in a sequential manner, the
development of a quiet, orderly classroom atmosphere
and the quantitative measurement of student progress
through testing and grades."
Not new
The idea of alternative schools is not new. The cur
rent interest developed in the'6os as several educa
tional reformers cried out against the rigidity of the
schools and the authority of the teacher. Charles Si I -
berman's book Crisis in the Classroom, published in
1 described the open classroom in England's infant
schools. In America, private alternative schools flo
wered, followed by alternatives to public school.
Mathiott comments that there is no way of knowing
exactly how many open classrooms and schools there
are in the I I.S. now "because we do not have a national
organization like the Progressive Education Associa
tion which existed in the 30's." Every state has some
open education programs but New York, North Dakota
and Vermont took a particularly strong interest in
the informal approach.
Mathiott defines informal education at Ohlone by
comparing it to three things: a smorgasbord full of
choices, a good summer camp where children are
active and purposeful and a warm family whose

members respect each other. i
According to traditional educational standards, the i
open approach works at Oh lone. Kuthe l.undy, coor- [
dinator for elementary education in the I'alo Alto tin- '
ified School District, reports that Oh lone students doas [
well or better on standardized tests than other I'alo Alto £
studems their ago. Mathiott notes that they excel in [
areas that are different to lest like decision-making and [
accepting responsibility.
The variety of classroom decor at ()hlone reflects the r
emphasis on choice. The arrangement ol lofts, solas, [-
tables, desks, pillows, rugsand art work creates several t
environments within one room and makes each room [
unique. One of the key ideas of the open school
philosophy is to provide children with an interesting r
environment which stimulates learning.
Within this environment students do many activities t
simultaneously. During a recess period, a girl is (
stretched out on a couch absorbed in a book while her \
friends play marbles nearby. Mathiott says that it sur- i
prises parents to see their children work in such a busy 112
atmosphere but "today's children live in a noisy
world," Students are accustomed to seeing visitors and i
parents who do volunteer work at the school.
Quiet and orderly
At I loover the classrooms arc quiet and orderly. VV.il 112
lace Clark, principal ot Hoover School, said hy main-
taining a quiet roOm, a child with a learning disability L
is given a chance to pay attention. "The gilteil student 5
has more of the teacher's time si nee i I is not taken up by J;
behavior problems."
Behavior standards for the classroom, playground |
and lunch room stress courtesy, promptness and 112
obedience. "It is my belief that children are looking lor t
standards," ('lark comments. "I I ere, children know I he F
limits and work within them."


SCHOOL HAZE—PaIo Alio parents may now choose be
tween the traditional or the innovative in their children's
elementary education. Hoover Elementary offers the
traditional method of teaching, with the Ohlone School
offering an alternative.

Reports have shown thai Ohlone students do 'as well or
better' on standardized tests than other Palo Alto stu
dents their age. Ohlone is an 'open school/ with lofts,
sofas, rugs and arl work.
Hoover assigns homework four nights a
week and is the only Palo Alto elementary
school that issues report cards. In addition
teachers send weekly reports to the parents.
Parents have been involved with the school
since it opened.
Dissatisfied parents
In 1973 a group of parents who were dissatis
fied with their children's schools wrote a letter
to the school board requesting the establish
ment of an elementary school with a more
structured program. The school board ap
proved the request and a committee met for a
year to set guidelines for the school. When
Hoover opened last year, it had 150 pupils; this
year it has 250.
Until recently an alternative school meant an
open school, but in the last few years struc
tured schools have begun in Maryland, Col
orado and North Carol!n«.
The day after Palo Alto parents made their
original request to the school board they found
out that the nearby town of Cupertino was also
planning a fundamental school.
Inquiries
Mary Bushnell, another Hoover school
student, notes that Hoover has received in
quiries from all over the country. However, he
notes that there have been less letters from
the Midwest because schools have remained
more traditional there throughout the progres
sive movement.
The teacher is king at Hoover. Although pa
rents are expected to reinforce the goals of the
school in the home. Clark says. "We tell them

to stay out of the classroom." He explained that
parents in the classroom might cause all kinds
of problems. "The teacher is being paid to
teach; let him do his job."
Working together
The teacher and principal work together
closely. Clark comments that a fundamental
school needs a strong principal. "If not im
plemented correctly, this approach could eas
ily go awry."
According to Fred Hechinger of the New
York Times' editorial board, back-to-basics
schools are too often accompanied by a return
to harsh discipline and super-partriotism. He
names Hoover as a school which stresses basic
skills but omits "the harsh regimentation that
has often been the mark of conservative peda
gogy."
"Hoover is not opposed to the modern if it
works," said Clark.
Learn differently
In recent years educators have emphasized
the idea that children learn in different ways.
The fundamental school is not intended to re
place the open school as the latest educational
fad but exist alongside it. Mathiott comments
that there is enough interest in alternatives that
Palo Alto could support two open and two
structured schools if it were possible to house
them.
With interests in alternatives on the in
crease, Lundy, coordinator of elemen
tary education for Palo Alto, predicts a trend
toward alternative classrooms within a single
school as well as more schools dedicated to one
approach.
