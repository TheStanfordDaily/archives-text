## Opinions editorial Jobs for gays

The Committee on Services to Students (COSS) did
not go far enough when it declined to recommend that
employers who discriminate on the basis of sexual
preference be banned from recruiting at the Career
Planning and Placement Center (CPPC).
It is not enough to suggest that employers be asked to
state whether they discriminate. Such discrimination
is wrong and should be prevented, not merely acknow
ledged.
The CPPC already forbids employers who discrimi
nate in a variety of other areas in which discrimination
in employment is forbidden by federal law. But the
decision whether to ban employers who discriminate
is more a matter of individual freedom than of law.
An employer who refuses to hire gay people is im
properly prying into the private lives of prospective
employes and restricting their freedom of choice. The
University is under no obligation to provide such
employers a place to recruit.
Discrimination in employment is just one area of
societal oppression of a gay community often esti
mated at up to 10 percent of the nation's population.
The primary argument against banning employers
who discriminate on this basis is that such a ban would
interfere with the rights of students to seek employ
ment where and with whom they please.
But the rights of individuals in their private conduct
outweigh the privilege of being provided with a con
venient means of seeking employment.
We urge the University to give the COSS proposal
more than a cursory approval. We urge it to go beyond
the scope of the COSS vote and to eliminate the injus
tice that arises from permitting employers to discrimi
nate.
