# Beutelsbach closing 'tragic'
## 
### 
Bennett, et al.

As students who spent three to
six months at the Beutelsbach
campus last year, we feel its clos
ing was a tragic thing and a very
serious mistake. It represents the
loss of one of the very few
genuinely unique educational
experiences offered by the Uni
versity.
It seems that a foreign campus,
whose intended purpose is to in
troduce students to a culture,
should introduce students to as
wide a variety of people and
lifestyles as possible.
' The new Beutelsbach program
was centered right inside the
town so there was a constant re
'eiprocal reinforcement between
the community and the class
room. We got to know people
from many walks of life — old
style farmers, businessmen,
tradesmen, craftsmen and stu
dents, and through these con
tacts we got a feeling of German
life instead of experiencing
another city.
At the Vienna campus, on the
other hand, due to its size and to
the housing arrangements, the
only Austrians the students
came to know well were univer
sity students.
Best ballet
And what of "culture"? Some
say Vienna has a lot more culture
than Beutelsbach, yet the city of
Stuttgart was only 25 minutes
away by train, and Stuttgard had
opera, theater, symphony and
one of the best ballets in the
world.
But when it comes to living
culture of a people — that is
something you can't experience
unless you live with them, as we
in Beutelsbach could through
the family program there. You
have to become an insider, and
Stanford students in Vienna will
always remain outsiders.
Academically, Beutelsbach
was excellent. German classes
let us use what we were learning
while learning it. The an
thropology classes made us a
ware of where we were, and in a
larger sense more aware of the
world around us.
The history and East-West re
lations classes were stimulating
since we actually were in the
place that history was made. The
art and music classes gave us a
better appreciation of what we
saw and heard in our travels.
Non-stop learning
Outside the classroom the
education experience did not
stop. Through field trips and
through interacting with the
German people we learned les
sons we shall never forget about
ourselves and our lives.
Certainly economic reasons
can be claimed and perhaps even
justified for closing Beutelsbach,
but it is much harder to justify
this rapid switch in the stories by
Stanford administrators. Now
the staff in Beutelsbach is left to

itself to find other work since all
their work, dedication, talent
and effort wasn't enough to keep
Beutelsbach.
To them, we who have been
there send our thanks and love
and regrets that Snodfart U. can't
organize its priorities to hold on
to the gold mine of Beutelsbach.

economics; Sandy Mnrkus, a
senior in biology sciences; and
Scott Swanson, a senior, were
once students at the Beutclsbach
campus.)
