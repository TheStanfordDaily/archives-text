# Bailey brings Hearst defense to campus
## 
### Jack Vaughn 
"A military court wouldn't be out five mi
nutes" before acquitting Patricia Hearst in her
San Francisco bank robbery trial, defense attor
ney F. Lee Bailey said here Saturday.
Speaking before a crowd of 300 at Kresge Au
ditorium at the law school in a talk sponsored by
the Stanford Law Forum, Bailey said the armed
forces no longer prosecute former prisoners of
war for acts and statements in prison which
would otherwise be considered treasonous.
"There has been substantial evidence that
there is no way to resist" the process of what trial
experts have termed "coercive persuasion" —
the systematic training of a captive to depend on
and obey his captors.
Bailey said his defense rests on the concept of
"simply breaking a person so that they acquire
the habit of obedience."
However, he said he made no claim that
Hearst was the victim of complete "thought re
form" of the kind that converted American and
European prisoners in the People's Republic of
China to communism in the 1950'5.
If this were the case, he said, Hearst would still
be "spouting the SLA (Symbionese Liberation
Army) line" and "we would be trying Tania and
not Patty Hearst" for bank robbery.
Another personality
Bailey said that during Hearst's 57 days con
fined in two small closets after her capture, she
had "disassociated from what she had been"and
had "split herself off into another personali
ty ... in a way to please her captors."
He denied, however, that Hearst ever assumed
a true "dual personality" during her captivity.

Atty. Gen. William Saxbe's statement im
mediately after the robbery that Hearst was a
"common criminal" was a "reinforcement" in
Hearst's mind for statements by SLA members
that her former community had rejected her.
Bailey said.
He said the Los Angeles shoot-out between the
SLA and police which left six SLA members
dead was, for Hearst, equal to "watching your
self being killed on television" and was another
reinforcement of SLA coercive tactics.
Mixed emotions
Bailey said Hearst was depressed just before
her kidnaping, but that the depression was the
result of "very mixed emotions on getting mar
ried" to Steven Weed, and was "not very much
different from what other people go through."
The idea that "you can always buy an expert
witness" who will testify to what a lawyer wants
"tends to be much more truthful" for psychiat
rists than for other experts, Bailey said. He
explained other experts — handwriting, firearm
and polygraph experts, for example — tend to
give testimony in "pretty precise alignment
with each other."
He added, however, that he and others are
"trying to put an end" to "court-horses" —
psychiatrists who, though not specialists in a
field of interest relevant to the trial, are trained
in testifying techniques. The three psychiatrists
used in the Hearst defense were selected be
cause they were among "the 15 experts alive
today in the field of coercive persuasion."
Bailey said that because "everyone agrees that
Patty was forcibly kidnaped" and the defense
contends SLA member Donald DeFreeze was

holding a gun on Hearst during the bank rob
bery, the "bank robbery case standing on its own
could have been won without any of the evi
dence" of coercive persuasion.
Evidence admitted
The government's admission of evidence
suggesting that Hearst willingly took part in
later SLA activities forced him to use the coer
cion defense, Bailey said.
"The government most heavily relies" on
Hearst's alleged firing of a submachine gun near
a Los Angeles sporting goods store to protect the
flight of SLA members William and Emily Harris
from a robbery at the store in proving Hearst's
willing conversion to the SLA, he added.
Bailey said Hearst protected the Harrises be
cause she was "drilled" to do so, not because of
affection for the SLA. She acted "just as a soldier
who may have applied to be a conscientious
objector" and was turned down would have
acted if his commanding officer needed assis
tance.
The soldier is trained not to engage in "the
reflective process" at these moments, Bailey
said.
Primary purpose
"The government must prove," however, that
"her primary purpose was to rob the San Fran
cisco bank . . . regardless of what happened in
L.A.," Bailey said.
Bailey admitted that if Hearst is indicted in the
Los Angeles case, evidence of coercive persua
sion will be more necessary for her defense,
especially if the bank robbery jury "finds this
evidence cogent."
