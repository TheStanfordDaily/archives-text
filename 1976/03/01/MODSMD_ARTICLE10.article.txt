# Destroy 'monstrous' spy agencies
## 
### 
The report of the House Select
Committee on Intelligence,
transmitted by CBS correspon
dent Daniel Schorr to the New
York Village Voice, is a frighten
ing tale of an Executive branch
gone berserk. Not only have
members of the Executive
branch engaged in numerous
moral and legal transgressions,
but it now appears that there is
little Congress cart do to restrain
them.
The system of intelligence
gathering and intelligence oper
ations in this country is posing
quite a threat to our tripartite
democratic government.
The report was printed in two
issues of the Village Voice. The
first issue contained the inves
tigative findings of the commit
tee; the second contained the
problems thecommittee met as it
conducted the investigation.
The first issue began with the
committee analysis of the intel
ligence community's budgets.
Some of the highlights: There is
little, if any, fiscal accountability
by our intelligence agencies.
The committee wrote that the
Ceneral Accounting Office
(C1AO), the auditing arm of Con
gress:
"Is empowered to analyze the
economy and efficiency with
which government funds art;
spent. The Comptroller Ceneral,
who headsCAO,testified that he
cannot even balance ClA's
books, hit alone analyze its effi
ciency. Specifically, he said that
Irom 1962,(1 AO has made no at
tempt toaudit theCIA, because it
was allowed scant access to clas
sified spending."
Even the total fioure for our

intelligence budgets is un
known. The committee wrote:
"Today, taxpayers and most
Congressmen do not know, and
cannot find out, how much they
spend on spy activities. This is
in direct conflict with the Con
stitution. . .
"Those who argue for secrecy
do not mention the Constitution.
They do not mention taxpayers.
Instead, they talk ot rather
obscure understanding the Rus
sians might derive about some
specific operations" even if the
Russians just knew one total fi
gure.
"How the Russians would do

this is not clear. The committee
asked, but there was no real
answer. In all likelihood, the
only people who can; to know
and do not know these costs
today are American taxpayers,"
wrote the committee.
The committee then detailed
how the intelligence system
failed again and again in such
places as Vietnam ("where (in
telligence) perceptions were
shattered"), Czechoslovakia
("where we 'lost' the Russian
army, for two weeks"), the Mid
dle East (where tin; system
"failed"), and Cyprus (where
"intelligence tried to unravel

events — and America of
fended all participants").
Violated manual
Then the committee explained
how thi! KM violated its own
manual and how KM officials
possibly perjured themselves be
fore the committee. One interest
i iitf episode was the KBl's refusal
to follow an order from a United
States attorney concerning the
investigation of illegal police
wiretapping in Houston, Tex.
This section of the report
ended with the current intelli
gence "activities" concerning
information on Soviet com
pliance with the Strategic: Arms
Limitations Talks agreements.
It one is sickened while read
ing this section, one is chilled
upon turning to the next section.
It begins: "If this Committee's
recent experience is any test, in
telligence agencies that are to be
controlled by Congressional
lawmaking are, today, beyond
Iht! lawmaker's scrutiny."
The report then detailed how
Congressional subpoenas were
ignored, how the committee was
"cut-off" from all records, how
witnesses said they could only
speak in the presence of their
superior*(usually the secretary
of state), and how the Executive
branch finally resorted to smear
ing the committee by equating it
with McCarthyism. When
documents were forthcoming,
they were lull of deletions that
would make the Watergate crew
jump with joy.
Selective briefing
Then the committee found it
self up against the "selective
briefing" tactic, where the CIA
said it would oidy brief one or

two members of the committee.
The CIA also attempted to pro
cure the signatures of committee
staff members on oaths of sec
recy. If the staff members did not
sign the oaths, the CIA would
not release any secret informa
tion.
The committee commented
on this: "The Committee re
minded the CIA that subjecting
our employees to Executive
oaths would violate the concept
that Congress is an independent
and co-equal branch of govern
ment" and also "it is important
not to underestimate the signifi
cance of firmly establishing tin;
premise that a target ofan inves
tigation does not lay down
ground rules." The report is a
tale of widespread waste, fraud,
lies and illegalities—even the
Constitution is being ignored.
There are no isolated instances
of wrongdoing which should be
disregarded because the rest of
an agency (e.g., the KM) is doing
a great job. There has been no
reform since Watergate.
Our intelligence agents and
other members of the Executive
branch have shown their con
tempt and callous disregard for
the American people. These
agents deserve similar treat
ment: prosecution for all of their
crimes, and the abolishment of
any agency or branch of an
agency which shows it refuses to
operate under our system of gov
ernment.
We've already created our
Krankenstein's monster: let's de
stroy it before it wakes up.
