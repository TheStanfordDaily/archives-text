# Reconvene C-15

Rosenbaum, et al.

Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons made some very odd
comments in the Feb. 2fi Daily
regarding our drive to reconvene
theC-15. Lyons accuses usof try
ing to fulfill "a campaign prom
ise ... at the last minute."
Not true: the Student judicial
Counsel (SJC]) had not been
voted on when we ran for office.
Lyons also accuses us of reviv
ing an issue already decided by
students, faculty and administ
ration.
Wrong again: Lyons forgets
that final student approval of the
measure rested with the ASSU
Senate. In considering a highly
dubious referendum vote (those;
voting no or no choice outnum
bered the yes votes by more than
two to one; the ballot was so

poorly worded as to make it no
choice vote appear to he a vole
against), the Senate approved
the vot(! contingent upon a
pledge from this Council of Pres
idents to attempt to get the CM 5
to meet again.
Lastly, Lyons criticizes us for
challenging a system which is
not even a year old. One might
respond that the longer the SJC
goes unchallenged, the more
legitimacy it will gain and the
greater is the likelihood students
will forget the issue.
No douht this is what tin; ad
ministration and faculty would
like to see.
