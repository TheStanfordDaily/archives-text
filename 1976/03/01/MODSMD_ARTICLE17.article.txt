# Pac-8 roundup
## OSU alone in second

When Jenner invented the
smallpox vaccine, he probably
didn't realize that two of his dis
ciples would be UCLA coach
dene Bartow and Oregon State
coach Ralph Miller. Last week,
both teams were vaccinated with
a painful but non-lethal dose of
losing â€” UCLA to Oregon at
home, and Oregon State to
UCLA at Pauley Pavilion, and to
the St. Louis Spirits in the
courts. This weekend they both
showed signs that they are on the
way to recovery.
UCLA was held to 45 points
last week in the Oregon disaster.
This weekend the Bruins scored
2.33 x 10 2 points in two wins
against Cal and Stanford. In the
Cal game Marques Johnson had
no experimental error, going 11
of 11 from the floor and 5 of 5
from the line. The excellent lab
work of the Bruins' two newest
starters: center Dave Green
wood, and guard RayTownsend,
in the 113-93 win over Cal was
probably more significant for
UCLA's long term chances for
survival in the NCAAs.
Oregon State displayed the
single most important quality of
a winner last weekend, the abil
ity to handle adversity. Having
dropped into a tie for second
place and having lost Shelton,
the Beavers went on to take sole
possession of second place with
convincing victories over
Washington State, 69-55, and
Washington, 73-64.
Rocky Smith had 20 points in
each game and, along with
George Tucker, directed a preci
sion passing offense which be
wildered the slower, bigger
Washington teams. No matter

where they go tournament-wise,
the Beavers proved they are a
class team.
Oregon, which had heen the
hottest team in the conference,
gets to try the Jenner theory of
basketball next week against
Oregon State. The Ducks lost to
Washington 67-62. The Huskies
shot 70 percent from the field in
the second half and held Ron Lee
and Greg Ballard to 22 points to
tal. On Saturday, Oregon started
its recovery by beating
Washington State 70-56.
Apparently USC overdosed on
the losing vaccine. The Trojans
lost both their Bay Area games to
tun their league record to a lucky
0-13. In the overtime loss to Cal,

96-94, Bear guard Rickie Hawth
orne scored a career-high 3 7
points.
