# Spikers win first meet

### Bruce Anderson 
With characteristic strength in
the distance runs and surprising
performances in the sprints,
Stanford lambasted Hayward
State and Santa Clara, 116 to 77
to 9, Saturday in the season's
opening track meet.
Coach Payton Jordan, begin
ning his 20th season on the
Farm, pointed to the 400-meter
relay race run early in the meet
as the catalyzing event for the
Cardinals. The relay victory,
clocked at 40.7, foreshadowed
additional success in thesprints.
In the 200-meter dash,
sophomore Alan Sheats and
Cardinal teammate Marvin
Holmes finished one-two with
identical 21.4 times. It was a per
sonal best for Sheats, as were
Matt Hoggsett's and Scott Win
go's first and second place times

of 48.4 and 49.4 in the 400-
meters.
If the successes in the sprints
were pleasantly surprising,
Stanford's domination in the
distances was anything but un
expected. The Cards swept the
first three spots in the steeple
chase, the 1500 meters and the
two-mile.
Senior Jack Bellah, coming off
a sprained hamstring, beat the
remainder of the field by nearly
40 seconds with a 9:26.8 time in
the steeplechase.
Junior Jeff Parietti, showing
constant improvement, picked
up his first collegiate victory
with a win in the 1500, then
came back to take the two-mile
in 9:06.8.
In the field events, Brad Slin
kard is starting to look likean old
pro among the weight men. The

freshman from Lakewood, Calif.,
took first in the shotput, second
in the discus and fourth in the
hammer throw.
James Lofton's winning long
jump of 23-7V2 was Stanford's
only redemption in the jumps.
Hayward blitzed the Cardinals
in the triple, long and high
jumps, taking 27 of 33 possible
points.
Hayward coach Jim Santos
said he felt the meet had done his
team considerable good despite
the score. "After all," he said,
"it's better to get beat by Stan
ford than somebody like Azusa
Pacific."
Track notes: Stanford's Tony
Sandoval finished 20th in a field
of nearly 150 Saturday in the In

to finish, Cary Tuttle of the Be

finished seventh. Freshman Roy
Kissin, also in Chepstow for the
world championships, finished
139 th.
