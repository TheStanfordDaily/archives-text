# Grants decrease for grad students
## 
### Jim Raup 
The Committee on Graduate Studies
(CGS) and the Graduate Student Coun
cil have been working for the past two
years to get the University to take
graduate students' financial needs into
account when granting fellowships,
according to the committee's chair
man, Education Prof. Henry Levin, and
the Council's head, Deric Jennings, a
second-year graduate student in
economics.
The effort was dealt a blow in
January when the Faculty Senate re
fused to consider the complex issue
without more information and alterna
tive proposals. However, the issue is
still very much alive, according to Jen
nings.
At present, the University stipend is
$2310 per year to all recipients and is
generally offered to all graduate stu
dents for four years.
The stipends, however, are only up
15 percent from the 1970 level of
$2000, compared with a 40 percent in
flation rise over the same time period.
Dean of Graduate Studies W. Bliss
Carnochan admitted that the Univer
sity "no longer makes any pretense
that the stipend can be lived on."
Carnochan said that the grants are
"too low," but pointed out that the
University budget is restricted. Ac
cording to Levin, the fellowship prog
ram already costs about $1.5 million
per year.
'Budget problems'
"Budget problems are getting
worse," added Levin. "It used to be
that grad students would leave the
University and take jobs when they got
to their third year. However, the job
market is bad now so people are stay

ing and using up the full four years of
grants."
"There are inequities" in the present
system, said Levin. "Everyone gets the
same amount of money, but the poor
and even the middle class students
have a tough time living on it."
Less sensitive
Levin stated that he believed that
"the wealthy students are a lot less
sensitive about how much money they
got. If they want to come to Stanford,
they will."
Since the University's budget won't
allow a large raise in grants, Jennings
said there are two alternatives: a cut in
enrollments and grants based on the
students' financial need.
Jennings ruled out a cut in enroll
ments saying, "There are limits to how
small departments can be and still
maintain their quality. Right now,
there is not a lot of fat in the depart
ments that could be cut."
Basic questions
Jennings identified three basic ques
tions that have been raised by critics of
the svstem.

MONEY, MONEY, MONEY—Prof. Henry Levin recently discussed problems
with grants being loaned for graduate students' work. Not only is the amount
not rising with the rate of inflation, but also. Levin adds, wealthier students
are able to survive on the grants more easily.
One question concerns the determi
nation of need, whether the income of
spouses and parents should be consi
dered and whether it is right to enforce
students' dependence on parents.
The second question concerns im
plementation of the system — who
should be in charge of it.and how
much voice the individual depart
ments would have.

without more information and alterna
tive proposals. However, the issue is
still very much alive, according to Jen
nings.
At present, the University stipend is
$2310 per year to all recipients and is
generally offered to all graduate stu
dents for four years.
The stipends, however, are only up
15 percent from the 1970 level of
$2000, compared with a 40 percent in
flation rise over the same time period.
Dean of Graduate Studies W. Bliss
Carnochan admitted that the Univer
sity "no longer makes any pretense
that the stipend can be lived on."
Carnochan said that the grants are
"too low," but pointed out that the
University budget is restricted. Ac
cording to Levin, the fellowship prog
ram already costs about $1.5 million
per year.
'Budget problems'
"Budget problems are getting
worse," added Levin. "It used to be
that grad students would leave the
University and take jobs when they got
to their third year. However, the job
market is bad now so people are stay

ing and using up the full four years of
grants."
"There are inequities" in the present
system, said Levin. "Everyone gets the
same amount of money, but the poor
and even the middle class students
have a tough time living on it."
Less sensitive
Levin stated that he believed that
"the wealthy students are a lot less
sensitive about how much money they
got. If they want to come to Stanford,
they will."
Since the University's budget won't
allow a large raise in grants, Jennings
said there are two alternatives: a cut in
enrollments and grants based on the
students' financial need.
Jennings ruled out a cut in enroll
ments saying, "There are limits to how
small departments can be and still
maintain their quality. Right now,
there is not a lot of fat in the depart
ments that could be cut."
Basic questions
Jennings identified three basic ques
tions that have been raised by critics of
the svstem.

MONEY, MONEY, MONEY—Prof. Henry Levin recently discussed problems
with grants being loaned for graduate students' work. Not only is the amount
not rising with the rate of inflation, but also. Levin adds, wealthier students
are able to survive on the grants more easily.
One question concerns the determi
nation of need, whether the income of
spouses and parents should be consi
dered and whether it is right to enforce
students' dependence on parents.
The second question concerns im
plementation of the system — who
should be in charge of it.and how
much voice the individual depart
ments would have.
The Committee on Graduate Studies
(CGS) and the Graduate Student Coun
cil have been working for the past two
years to get the University to take
graduate students' financial needs into
account when granting fellowships,
according to the committee's chair
man, Education Prof. Henry Levin, and
the Council's head, Deric Jennings, a
second-year graduate student in
economics.
The effort was dealt a blow in
January when the Faculty Senate re
fused to consider the complex issue
without more information and alterna
tive proposals. However, the issue is
still very much alive, according to Jen
nings.
