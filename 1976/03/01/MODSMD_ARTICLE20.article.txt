## USC awful, Bruins awesome UCLA wins 'Maples Debacle' 
### Chris Baker 
Cancel two shipments of
seven-foot coffins.
Stanford, with its second
Pacific Eight basketball win over
USC, 96-83, Friday evening in
Maples Pavilion, assured itself
of a seventh-place finish in the
conference.
And UCLA, having won the
Pac-8 title for the last nine years
in a row, assured itself of no
thing worse than a tie for the
league crown with a 120-74 win
over the Cards Saturday night
before a sellout Maples crowd of
7945.
But those Stanford fans who
entertained thoughts of a second
Miracle on Campus Drive, after
watching the Cards' first Pac-8
home win Friday night, aren't
really the nuts who envision the
Stanford Board of Trustees sud
denly abolishing tuition.
14-point lead
It would be hard to imagine
Stanford playing any better than
it did in running up a 14-point
first half lead over the Trojans,
50-36. And that's exactly what
Stanford did. The Cards ran the
Trojans out of the Pavilion.
With the score tied at 6-6 early
in the first half, Stanford,led by
freshman guard Wolfe Perry and

backcourt mate Mike Bratz, out
scored USC 16-2, to take a 22-8
lead at the 11:37 mark of the half.
Stanford was playing basket
ball the way it should be played.
Card coach Dick Dißiaso, who
normally goes to his bench faster
than it takes most Stanford men
to learn the names of the new
Dollies, made his first change a
little more than 13 minutes into
the game.
Of course, it didn't hurt mat
ters any that Stanford shot 61
percent from the floor during the
half. Perry, who normally
amazes Maples fans with his un
usual shot selection, amazed
them with a seven for 13 first half
performance from the floor.
Board strength
Card forwards George Schader
and Ed Schweitzer, playing his
last two games at home, domi
nated the boards, as they had
when Stanford beat USC, 89-75,
two months ago. It seemed
Schweitzer couldn't miss as he
hit five of seven from the floor
during the first half.
But neither could SC guard
Marv Safford, who hit seven of
10 from the field, for 14 points, to
keep USC from getting com
pletely emasculated in the first
half.
The Trojans opened the sec
ond half by outscoring Stanford
26-12, as the Cards stood around
on offense.
Jay Carter's tip gave Stanford a
64-62 lead, but the Cards were
far from assured of their first
home conference win.
Schweitzer in foul trouble
Stanford had a chance to in
crease its cushion, with the ball
out of bounds under its own bas
ket. But Schweitzer, trying to es
tablish offensive position, com
mitted his fourth foul.
Immediately Dißiaso inserted
Tim Patterson for Schweitzer in
an attempt to protect his leading
scorer. Just a minute and a half
later, Schweitzer returned to the
game with the score tied at
68-68.
The strategy worked. When
Schweitzer returned, Stanford
started to play like it had during
the first half and outscored USC
18-6.

"Tonight we worked out our
problems. It was gratifying."
said Dißiaso. He praised Perry,
who had a career-high 20 points,
Schweitzer, who was the Cards'
high-scorer with 21, Schader,
who had one of his best games
since his leg injuries,and Bratz,
who finished with 16 points.
Safford stopped
Then Dißiaso added another
important effort: "Jay Carter
coming off the bench and going
five for eight. He also did a good
job on Safford, the game's high
scorer with 22 points. 1 don't be
lieve Safford scored once after
jay started guarding him."
Maples was as loud as Ore
gon's Mac Court for Saturday
night's UCLA game. The place
had been sold out for over a
month and scalpers were getting
$10 per ticket.
All three of Stanford's seniors
— Patterson, Schweitzer and
Simons — were introduced be
fore their last game in Maples
with their parents. There were
more standing ovations than
there would be at a speech by
Ceorge Wallace before a Klu
Klux Klan BYON gathering.
After all, thought the fans,
what better way to close out a
career than with a win over the
defending NCAA champions at
home. The place went wild be
fore the game, as the Red Vest
Band played "Bill Tell" and "All
Right Now."
But UCLA will probably be de
fending its NCAA crown for a
long time to come. It's as hard to
see how Oregon beat the Bruins
by 20 points, 65-45, in Pauley, as
it is to imagine how Stanford lost
to the Bruins by a point, 68-07,
two months ago.
71 percent
"The question is," said one
press box observer, watching
UCLA shoot an amazing 71 per
cent from the floor during the
first half, "not how many shots
UCLA has missed (eight),but if

any hit the rim."
The first half score was
Richard Washington and Mar
ques Johnson 32, Stanford 31.
The junior forwards combined
for 32 first-half points to lead the
Bruins to a 49-31 half time lead
over Stanford.
"Did we shoot 71 percent in
the first half?," asked
Washington, after the game.
"Wow."
But even that adjective doesn't
describe the second half. UCLA
scored 71 points in the second

stanza, to set a new Maples
single-game scoring record,
with 120 points. The final 4fS
point margin was also the
Bruins' biggest win over Stan
ford.
Cards outrebounded
The Cards, who had out
rebounded UCLA, 54-26, two
months ago, were outrebounded
38-34 this time.
All the UCLA starters finished
in double figures, and the Bruin
bench added 39 points.

to the Bruins by a point, 68-07,
two months ago.
71 percent
"The question is," said one
press box observer, watching
UCLA shoot an amazing 71 per
cent from the floor during the
first half, "not how many shots
UCLA has missed (eight),but if

any hit the rim."
The first half score was
Richard Washington and Mar
ques Johnson 32, Stanford 31.
The junior forwards combined
for 32 first-half points to lead the
Bruins to a 49-31 half time lead
over Stanford.
"Did we shoot 71 percent in
the first half?," asked
Washington, after the game.
"Wow."
But even that adjective doesn't
describe the second half. UCLA
scored 71 points in the second

stanza, to set a new Maples
single-game scoring record,
with 120 points. The final 4fS
point margin was also the
Bruins' biggest win over Stan
ford.
Cards outrebounded
The Cards, who had out
rebounded UCLA, 54-26, two
months ago, were outrebounded
38-34 this time.
All the UCLA starters finished
in double figures, and the Bruin
bench added 39 points.

ADMIRAL PERRY—Stanford freshman Wolfe Perry challenges Richard Washington of UCLA
Saturday night. Perry had probably his best weekend of the year, hitting 14 of 23 shots from the field
in the USC and UCLA games combined.
Cancel two shipments of
seven-foot coffins.
Stanford, with its second
Pacific Eight basketball win over
USC, 96-83, Friday evening in
Maples Pavilion, assured itself
of a seventh-place finish in the
conference.
And UCLA, having won the
Pac-8 title for the last nine years
in a row, assured itself of no
thing worse than a tie for the
league crown with a 120-74 win
over the Cards Saturday night
before a sellout Maples crowd of
7945.
But those Stanford fans who
entertained thoughts of a second
Miracle on Campus Drive, after
watching the Cards' first Pac-8
home win Friday night, aren't
really the nuts who envision the
Stanford Board of Trustees sud
denly abolishing tuition.
14-point lead
It would be hard to imagine
Stanford playing any better than
it did in running up a 14-point
first half lead over the Trojans,
50-36. And that's exactly what
Stanford did. The Cards ran the
Trojans out of the Pavilion.
With the score tied at 6-6 early
in the first half, Stanford,led by
freshman guard Wolfe Perry and

backcourt mate Mike Bratz, out
scored USC 16-2, to take a 22-8
lead at the 11:37 mark of the half.
Stanford was playing basket
ball the way it should be played.
Card coach Dick Dißiaso, who
normally goes to his bench faster
than it takes most Stanford men
to learn the names of the new
Dollies, made his first change a
little more than 13 minutes into
the game.
Of course, it didn't hurt mat
ters any that Stanford shot 61
percent from the floor during the
half. Perry, who normally
amazes Maples fans with his un
usual shot selection, amazed
them with a seven for 13 first half
performance from the floor.
Board strength
Card forwards George Schader
and Ed Schweitzer, playing his
last two games at home, domi
nated the boards, as they had
when Stanford beat USC, 89-75,
two months ago. It seemed
Schweitzer couldn't miss as he
hit five of seven from the floor
during the first half.
But neither could SC guard
Marv Safford, who hit seven of
10 from the field, for 14 points, to
keep USC from getting com
pletely emasculated in the first
half.
The Trojans opened the sec
ond half by outscoring Stanford
26-12, as the Cards stood around
on offense.
Jay Carter's tip gave Stanford a
64-62 lead, but the Cards were
far from assured of their first
home conference win.
Schweitzer in foul trouble
Stanford had a chance to in
crease its cushion, with the ball
out of bounds under its own bas
ket. But Schweitzer, trying to es
tablish offensive position, com
mitted his fourth foul.
Immediately Dißiaso inserted
Tim Patterson for Schweitzer in
an attempt to protect his leading
scorer. Just a minute and a half
later, Schweitzer returned to the
game with the score tied at
68-68.
The strategy worked. When
Schweitzer returned, Stanford
started to play like it had during
the first half and outscored USC
18-6.

"Tonight we worked out our
problems. It was gratifying."
said Dißiaso. He praised Perry,
who had a career-high 20 points,
Schweitzer, who was the Cards'
high-scorer with 21, Schader,
who had one of his best games
since his leg injuries,and Bratz,
who finished with 16 points.
Safford stopped
Then Dißiaso added another
important effort: "Jay Carter
coming off the bench and going
five for eight. He also did a good
job on Safford, the game's high
scorer with 22 points. 1 don't be
lieve Safford scored once after
jay started guarding him."
Maples was as loud as Ore
gon's Mac Court for Saturday
night's UCLA game. The place
had been sold out for over a
month and scalpers were getting
$10 per ticket.
All three of Stanford's seniors
— Patterson, Schweitzer and
Simons — were introduced be
fore their last game in Maples
with their parents. There were
more standing ovations than
there would be at a speech by
Ceorge Wallace before a Klu
Klux Klan BYON gathering.
After all, thought the fans,
what better way to close out a
career than with a win over the
defending NCAA champions at
home. The place went wild be
fore the game, as the Red Vest
Band played "Bill Tell" and "All
Right Now."
But UCLA will probably be de
fending its NCAA crown for a
long time to come. It's as hard to
see how Oregon beat the Bruins
by 20 points, 65-45, in Pauley, as
it is to imagine how Stanford lost
to the Bruins by a point, 68-07,
two months ago.

Schweitzer, who was the Cards'
high-scorer with 21, Schader,
who had one of his best games
since his leg injuries,and Bratz,
who finished with 16 points.
Safford stopped
Then Dißiaso added another
important effort: "Jay Carter
coming off the bench and going
five for eight. He also did a good
job on Safford, the game's high
scorer with 22 points. 1 don't be
lieve Safford scored once after
jay started guarding him."
Maples was as loud as Ore
gon's Mac Court for Saturday
night's UCLA game. The place
had been sold out for over a
month and scalpers were getting
$10 per ticket.
All three of Stanford's seniors
— Patterson, Schweitzer and
Simons — were introduced be
fore their last game in Maples
with their parents. There were
more standing ovations than
there would be at a speech by
Ceorge Wallace before a Klu
Klux Klan BYON gathering.
After all, thought the fans,
what better way to close out a
career than with a win over the
defending NCAA champions at
home. The place went wild be
fore the game, as the Red Vest
Band played "Bill Tell" and "All
Right Now."
But UCLA will probably be de
fending its NCAA crown for a
long time to come. It's as hard to
see how Oregon beat the Bruins
by 20 points, 65-45, in Pauley, as
it is to imagine how Stanford lost
to the Bruins by a point, 68-07,
two months ago.
71 percent
"The question is," said one
press box observer, watching
UCLA shoot an amazing 71 per
cent from the floor during the
first half, "not how many shots
UCLA has missed (eight),but if

any hit the rim."
The first half score was
Richard Washington and Mar
ques Johnson 32, Stanford 31.
The junior forwards combined
for 32 first-half points to lead the
Bruins to a 49-31 half time lead
over Stanford.
"Did we shoot 71 percent in
the first half?," asked
Washington, after the game.
"Wow."
But even that adjective doesn't
describe the second half. UCLA
scored 71 points in the second

stanza, to set a new Maples
single-game scoring record,
with 120 points. The final 4fS
point margin was also the
Bruins' biggest win over Stan
ford.
Cards outrebounded
The Cards, who had out
rebounded UCLA, 54-26, two
months ago, were outrebounded
38-34 this time.
All the UCLA starters finished
in double figures, and the Bruin
bench added 39 points.

ADMIRAL PERRY—Stanford freshman Wolfe Perry challenges Richard Washington of UCLA
Saturday night. Perry had probably his best weekend of the year, hitting 14 of 23 shots from the field
in the USC and UCLA games combined.
Cancel two shipments of
seven-foot coffins.
Stanford, with its second
Pacific Eight basketball win over
USC, 96-83, Friday evening in
Maples Pavilion, assured itself
of a seventh-place finish in the
conference.
And UCLA, having won the
Pac-8 title for the last nine years
in a row, assured itself of no
thing worse than a tie for the
league crown with a 120-74 win
over the Cards Saturday night
before a sellout Maples crowd of
7945.
But those Stanford fans who
entertained thoughts of a second
Miracle on Campus Drive, after
watching the Cards' first Pac-8
home win Friday night, aren't
really the nuts who envision the
Stanford Board of Trustees sud
denly abolishing tuition.
14-point lead
It would be hard to imagine
Stanford playing any better than
it did in running up a 14-point
first half lead over the Trojans,
50-36. And that's exactly what
Stanford did. The Cards ran the
Trojans out of the Pavilion.
With the score tied at 6-6 early
in the first half, Stanford,led by
freshman guard Wolfe Perry and

backcourt mate Mike Bratz, out
scored USC 16-2, to take a 22-8
lead at the 11:37 mark of the half.
Stanford was playing basket
ball the way it should be played.
Card coach Dick Dißiaso, who
normally goes to his bench faster
than it takes most Stanford men
to learn the names of the new
Dollies, made his first change a
little more than 13 minutes into
the game.
Of course, it didn't hurt mat
ters any that Stanford shot 61
percent from the floor during the
half. Perry, who normally
amazes Maples fans with his un
usual shot selection, amazed
them with a seven for 13 first half
performance from the floor.
Board strength
Card forwards George Schader
and Ed Schweitzer, playing his
last two games at home, domi
nated the boards, as they had
when Stanford beat USC, 89-75,
two months ago. It seemed
Schweitzer couldn't miss as he
hit five of seven from the floor
during the first half.
But neither could SC guard
Marv Safford, who hit seven of
10 from the field, for 14 points, to
keep USC from getting com
pletely emasculated in the first
half.
The Trojans opened the sec
ond half by outscoring Stanford
26-12, as the Cards stood around
on offense.
Jay Carter's tip gave Stanford a
64-62 lead, but the Cards were
far from assured of their first
home conference win.
Schweitzer in foul trouble
Stanford had a chance to in
crease its cushion, with the ball
out of bounds under its own bas
ket. But Schweitzer, trying to es
tablish offensive position, com
mitted his fourth foul.
Immediately Dißiaso inserted
Tim Patterson for Schweitzer in
an attempt to protect his leading
scorer. Just a minute and a half
later, Schweitzer returned to the
game with the score tied at
68-68.
The strategy worked. When
Schweitzer returned, Stanford
started to play like it had during
the first half and outscored USC
18-6.

"Tonight we worked out our
problems. It was gratifying."
said Dißiaso. He praised Perry,
who had a career-high 20 points,
Schweitzer, who was the Cards'
high-scorer with 21, Schader,
who had one of his best games
since his leg injuries,and Bratz,
who finished with 16 points.
