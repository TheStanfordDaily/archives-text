# Onnie Killefer: a free-lance athlete
## Two-sport star combines femininity, athletics 
### Jill Lieber 
The name Onnie Killefer is almost
synonymous with Stanford women's sports.
This year the sophomore from Grosse Point,
Mich., participated on the field hockey and
basketball teams. Last year she not only played
field hockey and basketball, but was also a
member of the volleyball and junior varsity
tennis teams.
Killefer said she doesn't mind being clas
sified as a "jock." "I certainly don't think femi
ninity has anything to do with whether or not
you're involved in athletics. Being feminine
depends on how you carry yourself and how
you view yourself. I view myself as strictly
feminine."
It's not surprising that Killefer's family is
athletic. One grandfather was a national tennis
champion, while the other was a pro baseball
player. Her brother played football on Stan
ford's last Rose Bowl team as well as on the
rugby and lacrosse teams. Killefer and her
mother have participated in the national
mother-daughter tennis championships for the
past five years. The pair finished third last
year.
New love
Killefer said she once wanted to concentrate
solely on tennis, but has since decided she'd
rather pursue field hockey.
"This past fall I played club hockey every
Sunday. There are nine independent teams in
the Bay Area. I enjoy team sports more than
individual sports. It's a five-and-go situation
with the other people. You've got to learn to
work with and rely on them. Sometimes it's
hard becau> e of so many different per
sonalities.
"In individual sports such as tennis you rely
totally on yourself. If I don't play up to my
potential, I have let myself down. However, in
team sports where you rely on others and they

depend on you, if you don't come through it's a
harder loss to take."
Sometimes a large crowd influences a team's
play. The women's basketbail team not only
plays in Maples Pavilion this year, but some of
their games precede the men's varsity games.
Killefer pointed out that these "double
headers" took place early in the women's sea
son and the team looked unorganized. "We did
not play up to our potential and were rattled by
the crowd. I would like more people to attend
women's basketball games for the team so that
the program can expand. But for myself, a
crowd doesn't really make any difference."
Killefer would not like to be a part of the
crowd however. She said it is hard for her to
watch sports in which she competes. "I can sit
and watch ice skating, because 1 don't skate —
or gymnastics. The sports I'm not involved in I
can watch."
Dißiaso de boss
This year, with the merging of the athletic
departments, Dick Dißiaso heads both the
men's and women's basketball programs.
"Coach Dißiaso is accessible and he's often at
part of our practices," Killefer said. "He's there
if someone has a question and wants help, but
women's basketball is not his primary con
cern."
Next quarter, Killefer, an English major,
will be in Stanford-in-Germany — the
Beutelsbach campus. "It will be the first time
in my life that I won't be involved in sports. I'm
looking forward to catching up on things I ha
ven't had time to do because of sports."
Onnie Killefer will never be able to give up
sports because her life revolves around them.
But perhaps by traveling the world, and being
away from organized sports, she'll be able to
pinpoint her favorite one. "If I knew right now
which was my favorite it would make life so
much easier," Killefer said.

ford's last Rose Bowl team as well as on the
rugby and lacrosse teams. Killefer and her
mother have participated in the national
mother-daughter tennis championships for the
past five years. The pair finished third last
year.
New love
Killefer said she once wanted to concentrate
solely on tennis, but has since decided she'd
rather pursue field hockey.
"This past fall I played club hockey every
Sunday. There are nine independent teams in
the Bay Area. I enjoy team sports more than
individual sports. It's a five-and-go situation
with the other people. You've got to learn to
work with and rely on them. Sometimes it's
hard becau> e of so many different per
sonalities.
"In individual sports such as tennis you rely
totally on yourself. If I don't play up to my
potential, I have let myself down. However, in
team sports where you rely on others and they

depend on you, if you don't come through it's a
harder loss to take."
Sometimes a large crowd influences a team's
play. The women's basketbail team not only
plays in Maples Pavilion this year, but some of
their games precede the men's varsity games.
Killefer pointed out that these "double
headers" took place early in the women's sea
son and the team looked unorganized. "We did
not play up to our potential and were rattled by
the crowd. I would like more people to attend
women's basketball games for the team so that
the program can expand. But for myself, a
crowd doesn't really make any difference."
Killefer would not like to be a part of the
crowd however. She said it is hard for her to
watch sports in which she competes. "I can sit
and watch ice skating, because 1 don't skate —
or gymnastics. The sports I'm not involved in I
can watch."
Dißiaso de boss
This year, with the merging of the athletic
departments, Dick Dißiaso heads both the
men's and women's basketball programs.
"Coach Dißiaso is accessible and he's often at
part of our practices," Killefer said. "He's there
if someone has a question and wants help, but
women's basketball is not his primary con
cern."
Next quarter, Killefer, an English major,
will be in Stanford-in-Germany — the
Beutelsbach campus. "It will be the first time
in my life that I won't be involved in sports. I'm
looking forward to catching up on things I ha
ven't had time to do because of sports."
Onnie Killefer will never be able to give up
sports because her life revolves around them.
But perhaps by traveling the world, and being
away from organized sports, she'll be able to
pinpoint her favorite one. "If I knew right now
which was my favorite it would make life so
much easier," Killefer said.

VERSATILE ATHLETE—Onnie Killefer in her basketball un
iform, one of many she has worn in the past few years. j
The name Onnie Killefer is almost
synonymous with Stanford women's sports.
This year the sophomore from Grosse Point,
Mich., participated on the field hockey and
basketball teams. Last year she not only played
field hockey and basketball, but was also a
member of the volleyball and junior varsity
tennis teams.
Killefer said she doesn't mind being clas
sified as a "jock." "I certainly don't think femi
ninity has anything to do with whether or not
you're involved in athletics. Being feminine
depends on how you carry yourself and how
you view yourself. I view myself as strictly
feminine."
It's not surprising that Killefer's family is
athletic. One grandfather was a national tennis
champion, while the other was a pro baseball
player. Her brother played football on Stan
ford's last Rose Bowl team as well as on the
rugby and lacrosse teams. Killefer and her

mother-daughter tennis championships for the
