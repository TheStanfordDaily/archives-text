Swimmers tune up
In its last tune-up before the
California Collegiate Champion
ships in Los Angeles next
weekend, Stanford's men's
swimming squad defeated
Foothill College Saturday, 115-
98.
The Cardinals, who upped
their season dual meet record to
9-2, took first and second place
in just about every event.
To make the trip down to Los
Angeles with the Pacific-8 con
tingent, a swimmer must qualify
in an official time trial or meet.
Cards Scott O'Connor and Matt
Sullivan are two swimmers who
did just that in the Foothill meet.
O'Connor's 21.4 in the 50-yard
freestyle qualified him in that
event as well as earning him a tie
for first place along with team
mate Jon Powell.
The freshman from Arizona
also turned in his best time in the
100-yard freestyle: 46.8. Sulli
van turned in a 200-yard
backstroke time of 1:56.1. mark
ing his best time of the season in
that event.
Bill Chao led Stanford's vic
tory. The double-winner clocked
in at 1:43.7 and 4:40.3 in the
200-yard and 500-yard freestyle
events, respectively. Other per
sonal bests came from Ail-
American John Hencken in the
200-yard breaststroke and
freshman Jim Dewey in the 200-
yard freestyle.
Illustrating the easy time the
Cards had against Foothill,
sophomore Stuart Corliss, regu
larly a backstroker, swam a fine
1:57 200-yard butterfly event.
"This meet was intended to
get some of our guys to attain
their best times," said coach Jim
Gaughran. "We had quite a few
qualify for the Nationals."

The women's squad saw as
much success as the men's did
that day as eight members qual
ified for the ALAW Champion
ships at the University of Miami
in Florida. The Card qualifiers
included Margot Hagstette,
whose 1:02.7 was faster than the
1:03.5 needed to qualify for the
100-yard medley.
She also qualified with a 54.4
in the 100-yard freestyle as did
teammate Mary Ann Floyd with
a 54.6 clocking. In the 200-yard
individual medley, Holly Ed
wards bettered the qualifying
timeof2:l6.4 with a 2:13.8 while
Kathy Heinze equalled the time.
The butterfly events saw just
ah much action as Stanford's
Barbara Beck and Barbara Bacon
swam 27.0 and 27.1 in the 50-
yard butterfly, respectively, bet
tering the national qualifying
time of 27.5. Sophomore Wendy
Paskin's 1:00.5 equalled the
qualifying time in the 100-yard
butterfly.

Doubleheader sweep
With its first conference
baseball game just 11 days away,
Stanford's pitching corps is fi
nally rounding into shape.
Junior John Yandle and
freshman Bruce Fiala both
went the distance as the Cards
took a doubleheader from Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo 7-4 and
7-0 Saturday at San Luis
Obispo.
Friday the Mustangs took a 6-5
decision from Stanford. In that
contest the hitting was there but
the pitching wasn't. All
- candidate Steve Davis
had two round-trippers and sec
ond baseman Dave Perez had
one in the losing effort.
But the Cards came out run
ning and hitting Saturday. Stan

ford stole eight bases in the the
two games. Sophomore Rich
Bruzzone and freshman Bruce
Walters hit back-to-back home
runs in the first game to give
pitcher Yandie a healthy
lead.
Young was able to experiment
in the second game, as Fiala was
never in trouble. "We're still try
ing to find one outfielder, but I
think we're in pretty good shape
for UCLA.
The Cards open their league
campaign against the Bruins in
Los Angeles on March 12.
The Cards, now 9-6 on the
year, have a full home slate this
week. Stanford entertains UC-
Davis tomorrow afternoon at
2:30 and Gonzaga College Friday
at 2:30 p.m.
Spikers win
The Stanford volleyball team
won both of its matches this
weekend in three straight games.
Friday the Barons downed Ber
keley 15-10, 15-10, 16-14. Then

on Saturday Stanford beat Chico
15-9, 16-14, 16-14.
Friday's action against Cal
was highlighted by a tough third
game. The Barons, down by as
much as seven points, came from
behind to win the match.
Coach Art Lambert said he was
pleased with the team's perfor
mance. "When you're down by
seven and can come back to win.
that says a lot about a team. Up
until this time I hadn't seen the
ability in the team to play as they
did. Tonight we were passing as
a team."
Saturday the Barons found
themselves in a similar situation
in the third game as they were
behind Chico by five. But again
they came back to win the game
16-14 — a game in which the
Barons didn't miss any serves.

behind the play of Wade Non
nenberg, finished first in the

six-team Silverado Tounament
at Napa last weekend.

143, 36-hole tounament course
earned him a tie for first place
before being edged out by Cal
Fred Solomon in sudden death.
