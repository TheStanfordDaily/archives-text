# Women cagers lose in playoffs

The playoff hopes of the Stan
ford women's basketball team
came to an abrupt end as the
Robber Barons were trounced by
UC-Davis 66-49 in the first round
of the Northern California
Championships last Thursday.
The squad closed out its sea
son in the consolation bracket,
first by beating Stanislaus State.
69-49, but then losing to San Jose
State, 57-50, Saturday.
"We just didn't match up well
with Davis," coach Cay Coburn
commented. "We were ready for
them but they are just a very
talented, physical team and we
couldn't keep up with them.
Additionally, we had to play
without Onnie killefer (a starter
at forward who was out with a
sprained ankle) and Stephanie
Calef, (a guard who suffered a
concussion earlv in the first
half)."
Probably the Barons' quickest
guard, Calef dove for a loose ball
and landed on her head, ending
her 1976 Stanford basketball
season. She was hospitalized
Thursday night but suffered no
after-affects.
High hopes
The team had high hopes of
finishing in the top two of the
eight-team tournament and ad
vancing to the regionals, but in
the opening of the Davis game it
was apparent that was not to be
the case.
"We came out really cold and
when we started to come back in
the second half, we ran out of
time," captain Sonia Jarvis said.
The Barons went with their
usual starting lineup (Maggie
Nelson at center, Jarvis and
Sukie Jackson at the forwards,

and Nancy Lowold and Peggy
Bruggman at the guards) and
had their usual point dispersals
(Nelson and Jackson leading the
scoring attack with 17 and nine
points, respectively), but it was
all to no avail. .
Small consolation
With the loss, the Barons were
subjected to closing out their
season with consolation games.
Consequently, after edging
Stanislaus State, the Cards lost to
San Jose State after having nip
ped the Spartans by 17 points
live days before. Coburn sum
med it up: "What can 1 say, San
Jose just played extremely well."
The Barons, who finished 11-6
in 1975-76, look to a brighter
year next season. "We learned a
lot this year. (Assistant coach)
Ken Morgan gave our offense a
lot more structure than it had
had before," Jarvis said. "Next
year, with the experience we've
gained combined with having
practically everybody returning
and a lot of good incoming
freshmen, we could be a very
strong team."
Jackson to leave
The Barons will lose the
team's highest scorer, Jackson,
who will be teaching in In
donesia, and possibly jarvis, a
junior, who might be graduating
early.
The coaching situation is also
tenuous and "has kept some of
Stanford's best women basket
ball players from committing
their time to the women's bas
ketball team," one squad
member says. Coburn, on a one
year appointment, and Morgan,
a volunteer, are unsure of their
status next vear.
