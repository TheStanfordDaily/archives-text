Hearst defense to rest today
SAN FRANCISCO — One of Patricia Hearst's lawyers
says the defense will rest today and predicts that her bank
robbery case could go to the jury by Thursday.
"Depending on what the prosecution does, 1 expect the
case to go to the jury by Thursday," defense attorney A 1
Johnson said in an interview yesterday.
"We haven't ruled out the possibility of Patty taking the
stand again," Johnson said in response to a question. "But
1 can't imagine circumstances which would bring her
back."
U.S. Atty. James L. Browning Jr. has hinted he might
have a surprise rebuttal witness and has said "something
is in the wind."
But the prosecutor is playing close to the vest entering
the sixth and perhaps final week of the celebrated bank
robbery trail.
Johnson also was cautious not to tip his tinal hand.
However, he said that Margaret Thaler Singer, a clinical
psychologist from Berkeley, would be called to testify
today.
Former double agent dies
SOUTHBURY, Conn. — A former Mobil Oil Co. en
gineer who reportedly sold important oil industry know
how to the Soviet Union before turning double agent for
the FBI died yesterday of what authorities said was a
self-inflicted gunshot wound.
An autospy was begun to determine the cause of death.
Norman John Rees, 69, admitted accepting money for
information he gave to Soviet intelligenceagents and said
that from 1971 to 1975 he acted as a double agent for the
FBI, according to a published interview. His work was
considered so important that the Kremlin awarded him a
medal, according to the interview published in the Dallas
Times Herald.
Rees said in the interview that he agreed to work as a
double agent in 1971 when he was confronted by the FBI,
and continued in that capacity until 1975. He continued to
meet Soviet contacts at FBI instructions, allowing the
agency to observe and identify a number of Soviet intelli
gence officers, he said.
Spanish dissidents to go on trial
MADRID, Spain — After weeks of delay and maneuver
ing the army is putting nine leaders of a dissident officers'
movement on trial in what could prove to be the most
politically explosive case in modern Spanish military his
tory.

Families of the accused — a major and eight captains —
say conviction on charges of sedition is virtually certain.
A spokesman for the officers says this would spark new
dissent within the armed forces, with broad antigovern
ment impact.
The court martial, now scheduled for March 8 in Mad
rid, also has been taken up as a cause by the outlawed
Communist and Socialist parties.
The charges against the nine officers stem from their
alleged membership in the Democratic Military Union
(UMD), an underground organization of junior officers
whose stated goal is to block right-wing generals if they
attempt to hamper progress toward democracy.
The nine officers were arrested by military police last
August and have been shunted from prison to prison
since. The sedition charge has not been detailed, but it is
presumed that membership in the UMD, if proved, would
be sufficient for conviction.
Arafat's troops called in Beirut
BEIRUT, Lebanon — The Syrian-led armistice commis
sion said yesterday it «vas calling in Lebanese troops to
help Yasir Arafat's Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) curb a
fresh wave of lawlessness in Beirut.
PLA units based in north Lebanon also will be moved
into Tripoli, Lebanon's second largest city, following an
outbreak of mass robberies that cost the city's army garri
son much of its February pay- a commission spokesman
reported.
The new security measures were launched as Lebanese
politicians journeyed to Damascus to consult on Syria's
suspended mediation on forming a national union gov
ernment to settle Lebanon's civil war.
Meanwhile, President Anwar Sadat of Egypt expressed
concern that Syria and Jordan are planning new Middle
East moves behind his back.
"There is something being concocted between the two
countries which I cannot understand," he told a news
conference in Kuwait before returning to Cairo at the end
of a Persian Culf fund-raising tour. "Egypt cannot approve
of or accept such things."

Spanish dissidents to go on trial
MADRID, Spain — After weeks of delay and maneuver
ing the army is putting nine leaders of a dissident officers'
movement on trial in what could prove to be the most
politically explosive case in modern Spanish military his
tory.

Families of the accused — a major and eight captains —
say conviction on charges of sedition is virtually certain.
A spokesman for the officers says this would spark new
dissent within the armed forces, with broad antigovern
ment impact.
The court martial, now scheduled for March 8 in Mad
rid, also has been taken up as a cause by the outlawed
Communist and Socialist parties.
The charges against the nine officers stem from their
alleged membership in the Democratic Military Union
(UMD), an underground organization of junior officers
whose stated goal is to block right-wing generals if they
attempt to hamper progress toward democracy.
The nine officers were arrested by military police last
August and have been shunted from prison to prison
since. The sedition charge has not been detailed, but it is
presumed that membership in the UMD, if proved, would
be sufficient for conviction.

help Yasir Arafat's Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) curb a

politicians journeyed to Damascus to consult on Syria's
suspended mediation on forming a national union gov
ernment to settle Lebanon's civil war.
Meanwhile, President Anwar Sadat of Egypt expressed

Hearst defense to rest today
SAN FRANCISCO — One of Patricia Hearst's lawyers
says the defense will rest today and predicts that her bank
robbery case could go to the jury by Thursday.
"Depending on what the prosecution does, 1 expect the
case to go to the jury by Thursday," defense attorney A 1
Johnson said in an interview yesterday.
"We haven't ruled out the possibility of Patty taking the
stand again," Johnson said in response to a question. "But
1 can't imagine circumstances which would bring her
back."
U.S. Atty. James L. Browning Jr. has hinted he might
have a surprise rebuttal witness and has said "something
is in the wind."
But the prosecutor is playing close to the vest entering
the sixth and perhaps final week of the celebrated bank
robbery trail.
Johnson also was cautious not to tip his tinal hand.
However, he said that Margaret Thaler Singer, a clinical
psychologist from Berkeley, would be called to testify
today.
