# Miles for Meals
## Students march for hungry 
### Rick Christian 
They walked for a variety of reasons.
One walker said she came because her
seventh grade teacher came. Another
said it was simple a way to help out.
For others, however, merely walk
ing the route was grueling. Many of the

youngsters needed to stop and cover
their blisters with bandages they had
brought from home.
In addition to the students, Chapel
Dean Robert Hamerton-Kelley made
. the walk. And even Rep. Paul N.
i McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) put in an
appearance, running the first quarter
mile with Stanford students, but
finishing the walk at a somewhat
slower pace.
But it all seemed worth the trouble.
An estimated 1300 walkers partici
pated and raised nearly $55,000. ac
cording to Joanne Peterson, volunteer
chairperson and an intern at Memorial
Church.
The funds collected will be chan
neled into food programs both locally
and abroad. CARE and CROP, interna
tional relief agencies, will use two
thirds of the money to help those in
such countries as Chad and
Guatemala.
One-third of the money raised will
purchase emergency food for distribu
tion throughout Northern California
by the Northern California Ecumenical
Council Food Network. The Bay Area
and East Palo Alto will also receive
some of the aid. Peterson said.
"The walk is a way of responding,
however inadequate that may be, to
those in need of some sort of aid. It's a
small way of connecting myself to how
two-thirds of the world lives," said
senior Wayne Larocque, a social
thought and institutions major.
Larocque. who described himself as
"an old football player, currently play
ing rugby, who likes to run," was one
of three students to run the 17 mile
course.
Although he had been working-out
in preparation for the long distance, he
'vas not out tobreak any speed records.

Before the walk began, he confided
his secret: "One of my secrets of not
pooping out is to run backwards part of
the way."
Evidently it worked. Larocque was
among the first to cross the finish line
two hours later.
