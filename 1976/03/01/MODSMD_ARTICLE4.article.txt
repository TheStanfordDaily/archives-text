"Mankind appears to be suffering
from global schizophrenia," UC-Davis
Prof. Ledyard Stebbins concluded at
Saturday's day-long Evolution Sym
posium.
Stebbins cited former President
Richard Nixon's recent visit with
Chinese Communist Party Chairman
Mao Tse-tung as an anomaly because
long-standing evolutionary principles
demand that opposing groups seek to
annihilate each other.
The symposium, sponsored by the
Program in Human Biology, discussed
process and substance in evolution at
the molecular, anatomical and cultural
levels.
UC-Berkeley Prof. Clark Howell,
speaking on the evolution of man, in
advertently changed his topic to polit
ical evolution. He said the new Ethio
pian government and the Zaire gov
ernment were making his fossil re
search in Africa difficult.
"We have these little political prob
lems. you'll notice, in trying to do
physical science," Howell said.
Howell emphasized the slowness of
man's transition to Homo sapiens, a
process he said he believes took some
two million years.

"By six or seven million years ago,
we have some indicators of something
becoming hominidae-like," Howell
said, referring to the family of mam
mals to which man belongs.
University of Maryland Prof. Cyril
Ponnamperuma, a former Ames
Research Laboratory scientist, said
laboratory efforts to create amino acids
have been successful enough to sup
port the theory that the acids, the
building blocks of life, could have
been formed from non-living sub
stances in or near primordial oceans.
This theory is also supported, he
said, by analysis of in
terstellar space, which had by the end
of last year revealed 39 types of organic
molecules. "The process of going from
inorganic atoms to organic molecules
out of the basic hydrogen, nitrogen
and oxygen," he said, "seems to be a
cosmic constant."
Ponnamperuma indicated he will be
watching for the results of the Viking
One spaceprobe landing this summer
on Mars, which may show life on the
planet. "Finding life on two planets in
one solar system," he said, "must
mean that it also occurs on vast num
bers of other planets."
