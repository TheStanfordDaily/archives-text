TAMPA, Fla. (AP) â€” President
Gerald Ford said yesterday he is "abso
lutely certain" he will win the Florida
primary March 9 and, if he wins big,
Ronald Reagan's supporters "ought to
know they can't win, period."
Ford made the optimistic statement
to a group of President Ford Commit
tee workers in Tampa as he completed
a two-day campaign swing through
Florida and prepared to fly back to
Washington.
"I thought that before we came
down here this time that we had this
momentum," he said. "Now I know
more than ever that we have it.
"I am absolutely certain we are
going to win," the President stated.
Meanwhile in Massachusetts,with a
flurry of forecasts about the outcome,
campaigning Democrats continued
their scramble for presidential primary
votes.
Sen. Henry Jackson of Washington
said what will happen is that he'll win
tomorrow. So did Sargent Shriver.
Finish ahead
Rep. Morris Udall said he thinks he
has a good chance to top the field but
insisted that his showing will be a plus
so long as he finishes "ahead of the
other progressive candidates."
Shriver said he is in the presidential
campaign to stay, "and we're going to
win on Tuesday." With his wife, the
former Eunice Kennedy, Shriver held a
Family Day rally at Faneuil Hall, em
phasizing his tie to the biggest Democ
ratic name in Massachusetts.
Cesar Chavez, president of the Un
ited Farm Workers Union, also ap
peared with Shriver.
Vermont also holds its primary to
morrow, with Carter, Harris and

Shriver entered.
Ford is unopposed on the Republi
can ballot there. Ford and Ronald
Reagan both are on the Massachusetts
ballot, but neither has campaigned
there.
Former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Garter,
frontrunner among Democrats by vir
tue of his New Hampshire primary vic
tory, already has wrapped up his Mas
sachusetts campaign, with Democratic
oddsmakers generally agreed that he
probably will run near the top of the
field here.
Busing controversey
Gov. George Wallace of Alabama
was staging the last of 17 campaign
rallies Monday night in Boston, and
his primary strength was a major im
ponderable, particularly in a city torn
by controversy over the busing of
school children for racial integration.
