# Library exchange finalized
## 
### Bob Fikso 
The Academic Council Committee
on Libraries put finishing touches on
the proposed large-scale research lib
rary cooperative program with UC-
Berkeley at a meeting Thursday.
In attempting to economize while
maintaining high quality research
facilities, the proposal calls for the
two libraries to coordinate acquisi
tions of low-use books, journals and
other research materials to avoid dup
lication.
When the cooperative program is
fully implemented, all faculty,
graduate students and academic staff
at each campus will have full borrow
ing and research privileges here and at
UC-Berkeley.
Undergraduates with bona fide re
search projects will probably also be
eligible for privileges.
Implementation of the plan is
scheduled to begin in April, when
Berkeley will begin processing its
cataloguing through Stanford's BAL
LOTS library automation system.
September 1977 is the target date for
full implementation of the plan.
The proposal was first made public
by the committee on Feb. 18.
Library staff members are currently
working on the details of the propos
al's provision for a system of daily
transportation of books and re
searchers between campuses.
Other research libraries in the nation
have cooperative programs, but or
ganizers of the project here say the
Stanford-Berkeley proposal is distin
guished by the extensive acquisition
coordination plan and the possibility
of intnr-campus transportation.
Two existing library cooperative
programs are at Duke and the Univer
sity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
and at Columbia and the New York
Public Library.
