## Opinions Vote down transit tax 
### 
Genis and Evers

We urge Santa Clara County voters to vote "No"
on measure A (the transit tax) and measure B (the
transit plan) this Tuesday. Not only will the sales
tax increase take more from the already overbur
dened taxpayer, bu| the government transit
monopoly in its existing form or with the prop
osed expansions is by nature out of tune with
daily life in Santa Clara County, in a way that
cannot be corrected without ending government
funding and monopoly.
Americans across the country during the 2(Jth
century have gone from a 90 percent reliance on
the streetcar for urban trips to today's almost as
high reliance on the automobile.
Locally, one of the most advanced public transit
systems in the world began operating in the Santa
Clara Valley during the later half of the 19th cen
tury. An electrified railway operated here until it
was dismantled during World War 11 for its steel
rails.
Automobiles, it turned out, could travel almost
anywhere with no tracks or overhead wires, and
changing cost conditions meant that buses re
placed trolleys on the old routes. The automobile
ultimately proved to be the least costly method of
moving people on tfit; light-density routes which
were characteristic of suburban life.
During the 19505, the county entered a period of
explosive population growth and soaring labor
and equipment costs. San Jose City Lines was a
government-franchised bus monopoly with regu
lated fares and routes.
Unable or unwilling to innovate and meet the
changing demand for service, the bus company

was suffering heavy losses by 1970 and sub
sequently was taken over by the Transit District. It
became the nucleus of the heavily subsidized
transit system now in operation.
The usual difficulty with mass transit
everywhere is that only radial routes from a cent
ral business district generate enough traffic to
warrant transit routes, and, even then, only
people with low time valuation will make use of a
mass transit system. A decentralized community
patterned like San Jose or the rest of Santa Clara
County makes such linear, fixed-route systems
geographically and demographically inapprop
riate.
Thus, raising the sale tax will not only draw
more blood from the long-suffering taxpayer, it
will also overcapitalize an already wasteful prog
ram.
What is needed instead is a turn toward full
privatization of all modes of transit and transit
routes, beginning with road-use charges geared to
cutting down rush-hour congestion, elimination
of all anti-jitney laws (which lock in place transit
and taxicab monopolies), and cutting back the tax
revenues taken by the bloated transit monopoly.
Instead of a transit system as inefficient and
wasteful as the Post Office, let's move toward a
new approach where transit services will be re
sponsive to changing consumer desires and shift
ing market conditions. Let's vote down measures
A and B.

funding and monopoly.
Americans across the country during the 2(Jth
century have gone from a 90 percent reliance on
the streetcar for urban trips to today's almost as
high reliance on the automobile.
Locally, one of the most advanced public transit
systems in the world began operating in the Santa
Clara Valley during the later half of the 19th cen
tury. An electrified railway operated here until it
was dismantled during World War 11 for its steel
rails.
Automobiles, it turned out, could travel almost
anywhere with no tracks or overhead wires, and
changing cost conditions meant that buses re
placed trolleys on the old routes. The automobile
ultimately proved to be the least costly method of
moving people on tfit; light-density routes which
were characteristic of suburban life.
During the 19505, the county entered a period of
explosive population growth and soaring labor
and equipment costs. San Jose City Lines was a
government-franchised bus monopoly with regu
lated fares and routes.
Unable or unwilling to innovate and meet the
changing demand for service, the bus company

was suffering heavy losses by 1970 and sub
sequently was taken over by the Transit District. It
became the nucleus of the heavily subsidized
transit system now in operation.
The usual difficulty with mass transit
everywhere is that only radial routes from a cent
ral business district generate enough traffic to
warrant transit routes, and, even then, only
people with low time valuation will make use of a
mass transit system. A decentralized community
patterned like San Jose or the rest of Santa Clara
County makes such linear, fixed-route systems
geographically and demographically inapprop
riate.
Thus, raising the sale tax will not only draw
more blood from the long-suffering taxpayer, it
will also overcapitalize an already wasteful prog
ram.
What is needed instead is a turn toward full
privatization of all modes of transit and transit
routes, beginning with road-use charges geared to
cutting down rush-hour congestion, elimination
of all anti-jitney laws (which lock in place transit
and taxicab monopolies), and cutting back the tax
revenues taken by the bloated transit monopoly.
Instead of a transit system as inefficient and
wasteful as the Post Office, let's move toward a
new approach where transit services will be re
sponsive to changing consumer desires and shift
ing market conditions. Let's vote down measures
A and B.

We urge Santa Clara County voters to vote "No"
on measure A (the transit tax) and measure B (the
transit plan) this Tuesday. Not only will the sales
tax increase take more from the already overbur
dened taxpayer, bu| the government transit
monopoly in its existing form or with the prop
osed expansions is by nature out of tune with
daily life in Santa Clara County, in a way that
cannot be corrected without ending government
funding and monopoly.
