# Why cheer bicentennial?

Sfeve Carter

A recent letter to the New
York Times asked whether the
bicentennial craze had not gone
far enough when a large man
ufacturer of paper towels asks us
to wipe our tables with Benjamin
Franklin's face and virtually ev
erything is sale priced at $1 7.7fi.
The writer was justifiably in
dignant at the commericaliza
tion of the entire bicentennial
idea, but failed to raise the larger
question of whether, despite any
interest business might make,
there really is something to
: celebrate.
Of course, the I Inited States of
America will indeed be 200
years old on July 4 of this year.
Hut then, last year it was 199,
and next year it will be 201 . . .
presumably.
However, if we grant that a
nice, round figure is attractive in
some sense, we must consider
what the purpose of the bicen
tennial should be. Certainly it
does not mean we should be bar
raged with misleading televi
sion shows about what great
leaders some of our most corrupt
and imperialistic presidents
were.
Blind adherence
Nor does it suddenly bestow
legitimacy upon a blind adher
ence to tradition, toward "hon
oring" the nation's flag for its
own sake, without critically
analyzing what it represents.
For all Americans, 1976
should be a year to carefully con
sider old wrongs and try to right
them, and a year to question all
assumptions and try to update
them. Massive injustice must
still be undone before we can
fairly be asked to celebrate any
thing.
Black people, for example,
have barely been out of slavery
for a single century — and are
now being asked to celebrate

two. But we really have nothing
to celebrate.
In the first decades after the
nation's centennial, there was a
dramatic increase in lynchings
and bloody race riots, in the
North as well as in the South.
Segregation increased across the
country, and in I'lessy v. Fergu
son, the United States Supreme
Court legitimized an 18 percent
decision, the forced oppression
of a large segment of America.
Fiery radicals
Politicians conned black vot
ers then as ever after. Woodrow
Wilson secured the support of
even such fiery black radicals as
William Monroe Trotter in his
election bid — but after Wilson
won the presidency, he; followed
the same segregationist policies
he had supported as president of
Princeton and ordered im
mediate segregation of many
federal agencies.
Meanwhile* black Americans
were herded into ghettos, with
inferior schools and housing,
then told they were stupid and
could not learn, and that they
were alcoholics and criminals : —
and were generally denied any
opportunity to battle fairly for
equality.
Sure, a few outstanding black
men and women managed to
break through in various fields
and to outperform even their
white counterparts. Hut there
was no reason then why black
people should have had to out
strip whites even to gain minor
recognition.
Times changed in the wake of
a second world war, and in many
cases, black soldiers, equal at
last in the Army, were unwilling
to accept secondary status at
home. The movement for civil
rights grew stronger.
So did its opposition: Racial
murders, lynchings, beatings

and intimidation continued un
abated — and not only in the
South. White Americans took lit
tle notice.
In fact, it took the assassina
tion of white civil rights workers
in the South to move, for ever so
brief a moment, the conscience
of a lethargic and largely hostile
America.
Yet even now we are being
told that "affirmative action has
gone too far" — even though we
know full well it has never gone
quite far enough. We are warned
of the evils of "reverse discrimi
nation" — when even the
straightforward kind continues.
There are those who will go on
waving flags and singing war
songs in spite of such objections
(certainly no other nation
chooses to couch its traditional
melodies inqu i te so be 11 i gera nt a
manner). Some, however, may
read and be persuaded.
Not alone
Black people are not alone in
this struggle. Certainly
chicanos, Asian Americans and,
possibly more than anyone else,
native Americans; have many
reasons for protest.
None-of us, I think, has much
to celebrate.
The bands will playon and the
pious speeches will drone on
and life as we know it will cer
tainly go on. Hut people simply
should not be too shocked to
learn that after all they have
done to help our minorities, a
few ungrateful, trouble-making
sons-of-bitches remain.
But those who complain
should stop and ask themselves
what all the shouting is about;
then perhaps they will begin to
understand why not all of us are
shouting.
