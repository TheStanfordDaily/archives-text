SAN FRANCISCO—The defense
rested its case yesterday in the bank
robbery trial of Patricia Hearst after
unsuccessfully attempting to have all
charges against the newspaper heiress
dropped.
U.S. District Court Judge Oliver Car
ter denied a motion by Asst. Defense
Atty. Albert Johnson to "dismiss all
indictments against the defendant."
Johnson based his motion on photo
graphs taken by automatic bank
cameras during the holdup of the
Hibernia Bank by Hearst and Sym
bionese Liberation Army (SLA) mem
bers April 15, 1974.
Johnson said that the photos origi
nally provided by the FBI "did not de
pict what was actually happening."
He distributed 8-by-10-inch photo
graphs of the robbery to the jury, that
showed Camilla Hall standing in the
upper right corner of the photographs.
The photographs, released Feb. 25 by
the FBI, show Hall with a "weapon
pointed in the direction of Miss
Hearst," Johnson told the jury.
Not pointed at Hearst
Vernon Kipping, an FBI photograph
expert who analyzed the robbery films,
testified that, in his opinion, the gun
was not pointed at Hearst, but at the
persons behind the counter."
Johnson asked Kipping, "Would
you say that it (the gun) is pointing in
the direction of Patricia Hearst?"
Kipping replied, "No sir, I could

not."
Kipping said that the reasons the
first photographs released by the FBI
did not show the full figure of Hall
were that the film was misaligned in
the camera and that the automatic pro
cessor which produced the first set of
prints did not compensate for this.
He explained, "The first set (of
prints) were printed by an automatic
process which masked out the portion
(of the photograph) where Camilla
Hall was standing."
Custom process
He added that the prints produced
later, showing Hall,were "custom pro
cessed individually" by the FBI
bureau in San Francisco.
After the jury was removed from the
courtroom, Johnson claimed that the
photographs were exculpatory be
cause they showed that Hall's gun as
well as the gun of Donald "Cinque"
DeFreeze was pointed at Hearst. De-
Freeze was visible in the original FBI
photographs.
The photographs released Feb. 25
show that "more than one gun was
trained on Patricia Hearst during the
robbery," Johnson claimed.
Johnson said that because the
photographs were evidence not re
leased until Feb. 25, after the prosecu
tion had finished its case, the govern
ment had withheld "exculpatory evi
dence."
He then cited the court decision,
Brady v. Maryland, in which charges

against the defendant were dropped
because exculptatory evidence was
not made available to the defense.
'Subject to interpretation'
Carter denied the motion on the
grounds that the photographs "were
subject to interpretion." Carter said
"There is no testimony anywhere that
the muzzle (of the gun) is pointed di
rectly at the defendant."
Carter also did not admit testimony
by UC-Berkeley psychologist Margaret
Singer that Hearst's attorney, F. Lee
Bailey claimed would prove that
Hearst had been reading from a script,
prepared by SLA members, when she
made several tape recordings for the
SLA.
Carter refused to admit Singer's tes
timony on the grounds that her tes
timony could not be certified as "ex
pert" by the court.
He added that the consequences of
admitting Singer's testimony would
be "time consuming." Carter said, "It
seems this is going to add many hours
to the trial, but it will not add to the
case."
Bailey protested Carter's reasons,
but Carter said he would have to deny
admission of her testimony before the
jury "at least for now."
Singer testified that her analysis of
tape transcripts indicated that the
scripts for three of the seven SLA tapes
were probably written by Angela At
wood, who was killed in the Los
Angeles shoot-out.

Not pointed at Hearst
Vernon Kipping, an FBI photograph
expert who analyzed the robbery films,
testified that, in his opinion, the gun
was not pointed at Hearst, but at the
persons behind the counter."
Johnson asked Kipping, "Would
you say that it (the gun) is pointing in
the direction of Patricia Hearst?"
Kipping replied, "No sir, I could

not."
Kipping said that the reasons the
first photographs released by the FBI
did not show the full figure of Hall
were that the film was misaligned in
the camera and that the automatic pro
cessor which produced the first set of
prints did not compensate for this.
He explained, "The first set (of
prints) were printed by an automatic
process which masked out the portion
(of the photograph) where Camilla
Hall was standing."
Custom process
He added that the prints produced
later, showing Hall,were "custom pro
cessed individually" by the FBI
bureau in San Francisco.
After the jury was removed from the
courtroom, Johnson claimed that the
photographs were exculpatory be
cause they showed that Hall's gun as
well as the gun of Donald "Cinque"
DeFreeze was pointed at Hearst. De-
Freeze was visible in the original FBI
photographs.
The photographs released Feb. 25
show that "more than one gun was
trained on Patricia Hearst during the
robbery," Johnson claimed.
Johnson said that because the
photographs were evidence not re
leased until Feb. 25, after the prosecu
tion had finished its case, the govern
ment had withheld "exculpatory evi
dence."
He then cited the court decision,
Brady v. Maryland, in which charges

against the defendant were dropped
because exculptatory evidence was
not made available to the defense.
'Subject to interpretation'
Carter denied the motion on the
grounds that the photographs "were
subject to interpretion." Carter said
"There is no testimony anywhere that
the muzzle (of the gun) is pointed di
rectly at the defendant."
Carter also did not admit testimony
by UC-Berkeley psychologist Margaret
Singer that Hearst's attorney, F. Lee
Bailey claimed would prove that
Hearst had been reading from a script,
prepared by SLA members, when she
made several tape recordings for the
SLA.
Carter refused to admit Singer's tes
timony on the grounds that her tes
timony could not be certified as "ex
pert" by the court.
He added that the consequences of
admitting Singer's testimony would
be "time consuming." Carter said, "It
seems this is going to add many hours
to the trial, but it will not add to the
case."
Bailey protested Carter's reasons,
but Carter said he would have to deny
admission of her testimony before the
jury "at least for now."
Singer testified that her analysis of
tape transcripts indicated that the
scripts for three of the seven SLA tapes
were probably written by Angela At
wood, who was killed in the Los
Angeles shoot-out.

SAN FRANCISCO—The defense
rested its case yesterday in the bank
robbery trial of Patricia Hearst after
unsuccessfully attempting to have all
charges against the newspaper heiress
dropped.
U.S. District Court Judge Oliver Car

Johnson said that the photos origi

graphs of the robbery to the jury, that
showed Camilla Hall standing in the
upper right corner of the photographs.
