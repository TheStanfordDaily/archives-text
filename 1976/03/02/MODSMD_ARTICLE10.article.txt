Sexism at Maples
Wednesday night, Feb. 25, in
Maples Pavilion, there was
scheduled in overlapping time
slots Dolly tryouts and a wo
men's intramural basketball
game.
The basketball game started at
8:30 p.m.. during the time when
the judges of the Dolly tryouts
were trying to decide the cut of
beef they wanted to represent
Stanford.
With four minutes to go in the
women's basketball game, the
game was stopped to allow the
10 semi-finalists to perform their
own original routines to identi
cal music. Patiently the women's
basketball teams waited 15 to 20
minutes for these 10 women to
finish their dancing routines to
the monotonous music.
The protest that immediately
comes to mind is against the
poor scheduling. One of the
teams,Zapata,had tried to get the
game postponed because many
of its players were ill. Even for a
reason such as this, reschedul
ing was not allowed.
How unfortunate it is that
these two separate worlds, those
of us enjoying the game of bas
ketball and the made-up mani
kin exhibitionist portrayal of
women — the stereotypical
American dream — should have
been housed in the same place at
the same time.
Is this perhaps a reflection on
the difference between what
women think they can be here
and the reality of what they in
fact are? I cannot believe this is
not so when intelligent women,
who are also for the most part
beautiful, can sit passively and
allow others to request another
women's function halted (with a
mere four minutes left) so that
they can be paraded around like
cattle at a county fair.
1 lad the act been committed by
any other group it would have
been as rude, but having it com
mitted with the consent of other
women — ironically the Dollies
— rubs salt into already sore
wounds incurred in the battle
against sexism here.
