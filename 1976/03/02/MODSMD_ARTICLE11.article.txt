# SST decisions show poor planning

Secretary of Transportation William Col
eman's recent announcement that the
British-French supersonic Concorde would
be allowed to fly into and out of American
cities demonstrates a clear lack of planning
regarding the SST issue.
In 1971, federal financing for develop
ment of an American SST was killed by the
claims of the environmentalists. Objection
able noise, air pollution, climatic changes
and skin-cancer-inducing depletion of the
ozone layer in the stratosphere were among
the predicted side-effects of the SST.
Although these arguments were unques
tionably valid, the decision to halt de
velopment of an American SST has had dis
astrous consequences on the domestic air
craft industry. Rising fuel prices have
stifled commercial air travel by inducing
fare hikes, with the result that there is no
market for surplus planes.
The authoritative Aerospace Industries
Association predicts that commercial
transport sales this year will not exceed 215
planes. This will undoubtedly mean still
fewer jobs in an industry whose direct

employment had already fallen from
973,000 peopleinl974 to 921,000 last year.
Including such factors as subcontractors'
layoffs and the ripple effect on housing and
other industries in plant towns, the sag in
the aircraft industry may severely inhibit
national economic recovery.
Approval of domestic development and
production of an SST would have overcome
this slump in the United States jetliner bus
iness. This is clearly demonstrated by the
marked economic gains of foreign com
petitors determined to open new horizons
of excitement and speed in air travel.
By far the most noteworthy planes of 1975
— the medium-ranged, twin-engine Airbus
A3OOB, the short-range Fokker VW-614
and the Concorde itself — were built by
European manufacturers; the American air
craft industry, long pre-eminent in the
world market, is suddenly being seriously
threatened by foreign competition.
Despite these economic consequences,
the 1971 defeat of the SST was justifiable in
view of its dangerous effects upon the envi
ronment. Now, however, Coleman's an
nouncement has shattered all beneficial

consequences of that decision.
The nation will not only have a slumping
aircraft industry at the expense of foreign
profit, but will also be subject to all the
adverse environmental consequences of the
SST.
In view of the present situation, it is clear
that more careful consideration and
foresight were necessary prior to the 1971
decision to halt the American SST. It was
inevitable a foreign nation with less public
environmental concern than our own
would not hesitate to develop an SST and to
maximize the profits of such an endeavor by
initiating flights to the United States.
Although Coleman's decision presently
faces strong opposition from several con
gressional bills and an Environmental De
fense Fund suit filed in federal court, the
situation clearly indicates a need for effec
tive governmental planning in dealing with
major issues. The SST debate lends strong
support to those who argue that politics and
government often create more problems
than they solve.

— the medium-ranged, twin-engine Airbus
A3OOB, the short-range Fokker VW-614
and the Concorde itself — were built by
European manufacturers; the American air
craft industry, long pre-eminent in the
world market, is suddenly being seriously
threatened by foreign competition.
Despite these economic consequences,
the 1971 defeat of the SST was justifiable in
view of its dangerous effects upon the envi
ronment. Now, however, Coleman's an
nouncement has shattered all beneficial

consequences of that decision.
The nation will not only have a slumping
aircraft industry at the expense of foreign
profit, but will also be subject to all the
adverse environmental consequences of the
SST.
In view of the present situation, it is clear
that more careful consideration and
foresight were necessary prior to the 1971
decision to halt the American SST. It was
inevitable a foreign nation with less public
environmental concern than our own
would not hesitate to develop an SST and to
maximize the profits of such an endeavor by
initiating flights to the United States.
Although Coleman's decision presently
faces strong opposition from several con
gressional bills and an Environmental De
fense Fund suit filed in federal court, the
situation clearly indicates a need for effec
tive governmental planning in dealing with
major issues. The SST debate lends strong
support to those who argue that politics and
government often create more problems
than they solve.

Secretary of Transportation William Col
eman's recent announcement that the
British-French supersonic Concorde would
be allowed to fly into and out of American
cities demonstrates a clear lack of planning
regarding the SST issue.
In 1971, federal financing for develop
ment of an American SST was killed by the
claims of the environmentalists. Objection
able noise, air pollution, climatic changes
and skin-cancer-inducing depletion of the
ozone layer in the stratosphere were among
the predicted side-effects of the SST.
Although these arguments were unques
tionably valid, the decision to halt de
velopment of an American SST has had dis
astrous consequences on the domestic air
craft industry. Rising fuel prices have
stifled commercial air travel by inducing
fare hikes, with the result that there is no
market for surplus planes.
The authoritative Aerospace Industries
Association predicts that commercial
transport sales this year will not exceed 215
planes. This will undoubtedly mean still
fewer jobs in an industry whose direct

employment had already fallen from
973,000 peopleinl974 to 921,000 last year.
Including such factors as subcontractors'
layoffs and the ripple effect on housing and
other industries in plant towns, the sag in
the aircraft industry may severely inhibit
national economic recovery.
Approval of domestic development and
production of an SST would have overcome
this slump in the United States jetliner bus
iness. This is clearly demonstrated by the
marked economic gains of foreign com
petitors determined to open new horizons
of excitement and speed in air travel.
By far the most noteworthy planes of 1975
