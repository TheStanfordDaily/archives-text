# Spock carries veep campaign here
## Won't take credit for antiwar generation 
### Scott Wakefield 
Political organizers have to get
people "hot" about local issues,
because people can't become
very concerned about general is
sues, Dr. Benjamin Spock, a
child care expert and
peace activist, said last Wednes
day night at a private reception.
For example, he said when the
police bloodied people in Har
vard Square during the 19605,
the Harvard faculty voted over
whelmingly that ROTC was
"out," completely reversing
themselves from their earlier
position.
During a 90-minute chat
with staff counselors at The
Bridge, Spock gave advice to
those wondering how to change
things.
"The only thing I know is to
get people organized, get a
majority and get them to take
over the government," he said.
First educate people, then
"have them well prepared for the
revolution that comes," he con
tinued.
'Get them mad'
"Make inflamed speeches. Get
them mad that they're paying for
Nixon's fine meals and fine
clothes."
Spock commented it is
surprising how unready most

Americans are to uncouple from
the two-party system.
He said there was always
somebody who would come up
after one of his speeches and say,
"Creat speech, but don't expect
me to waste my vote on you."
when the speech was about the
necessity for getting away from
the two parties.
"That's the only possible way
to change the system," he said.
He pointed out that both parties
had continued the Vietnam war
and are responsible for poor
medical care and education.
Recession not enough
"1 thought the recession
would be enough to open men's
eyes, but they go right on vot
ing" for the same two parties, he
said.
"It's going to take a much
more serious recession. But we
have to find a few organizers so
that when recession comes we'll
be ready," he continued.
This year Spock is the vice
presidential candidate for the
People's Party.
Spock was the party's presi
dential nominee in 1972.
"I didn't choose to run for
president in '72. My arm was
twisted," he said.
"Since I started with the high
est office, there was no place to
go but down."
Spock also mentioned that the
latest campaign contribution re
forms actually work against in
dependent parties, since they
limit individual contributions to
$1000.
Brainwashed
"Another thing that the
American people are brain
washed" into thinking "by the
proteges of the capitalist system
. . . (is that) the only thing that
makes Americans work is boo
dle," Spock said.
"Our campaign platform calls
for a progressive income tax" so
that effectively no one could
make more than $50,000 per
year.
•Spock noted that when he
mentions this in a speech, "one
of the first questions is '$50,000!
Don't you realize there'd be no
incentive?' " Spock said that he
was astounded that so much

money was not considered an
incentive to work.
Spock said that most people
are more interested in his views
on child care than his politics.
When he was indicted, the
popular accusation was not that
he was an anarchist so much as
that he was responsible for the
raising of a generation of "brats,
undisciplined, irresponsible . . .
and unpatriotic — which meant
opposed to the war in Vietnam,"
he said.
He noted that during the first
22 years his book Baby and
Child C lare was out, he was never
accused of being permissive.
"Older people had no expla
nation for what had happened"
to their children. But their chil
dren opposed the war and
"Spock is also opposed to the
war, so the logical conclusion"
was that Spock was responsible
for their attitude, he said.
'Horrible letters'
"I believe there is no truth in it
at all. But that doesn't keep mill
ions of people from believing it. 1
still get horrible letters." Spock
said.
Since 1968, sales of his book
have been cut in half, from a
million to 400,000 copies per
year, he said.
"1 thought that with the war in
Vietnam receding" into the
past that criticism would stop,
Spock said. But in April. Mayor
Richard Daley of Chicago
blamed Spock for the bad shape
of the schools, and in Ontario the
premier said that Spock had
caused the low moral tone
among youth.
"I'm valuable as a scapegoat,"
said Spock.
But Spock said not to feel too
bad for him. His publisher will
be paying him royalties of 10
percent instead of six percent,
and he still has his monthly col
umn in Hedhook. Also, his
newly revised edition of Baby
and Child Care will be out in
April.
"I hope that the people who
say I was a corrupter (among
them former Vice President
Spiro Agnew) will remember
what happened to Agnew,"
said.

For example, he said when the
police bloodied people in Har
vard Square during the 19605,
the Harvard faculty voted over
whelmingly that ROTC was
"out," completely reversing
themselves from their earlier
position.
During a 90-minute chat
with staff counselors at The
Bridge, Spock gave advice to
those wondering how to change
things.
"The only thing I know is to
get people organized, get a
majority and get them to take
over the government," he said.
First educate people, then
"have them well prepared for the
revolution that comes," he con
tinued.
'Get them mad'
"Make inflamed speeches. Get
them mad that they're paying for
Nixon's fine meals and fine
clothes."
Spock commented it is
surprising how unready most

Americans are to uncouple from
the two-party system.
He said there was always
somebody who would come up
after one of his speeches and say,
"Creat speech, but don't expect
me to waste my vote on you."
when the speech was about the
necessity for getting away from
the two parties.
"That's the only possible way
to change the system," he said.
He pointed out that both parties
had continued the Vietnam war
and are responsible for poor
medical care and education.
Recession not enough
"1 thought the recession
would be enough to open men's
eyes, but they go right on vot
ing" for the same two parties, he
said.
"It's going to take a much
more serious recession. But we
have to find a few organizers so
that when recession comes we'll
be ready," he continued.
This year Spock is the vice
presidential candidate for the
People's Party.
Spock was the party's presi
dential nominee in 1972.
"I didn't choose to run for
president in '72. My arm was
twisted," he said.
"Since I started with the high
est office, there was no place to
go but down."
Spock also mentioned that the
latest campaign contribution re
forms actually work against in
dependent parties, since they
limit individual contributions to
$1000.
Brainwashed
"Another thing that the
American people are brain
washed" into thinking "by the
proteges of the capitalist system
. . . (is that) the only thing that
makes Americans work is boo
dle," Spock said.
"Our campaign platform calls
for a progressive income tax" so
that effectively no one could
make more than $50,000 per
year.
•Spock noted that when he
mentions this in a speech, "one
of the first questions is '$50,000!
Don't you realize there'd be no
incentive?' " Spock said that he
was astounded that so much

money was not considered an
incentive to work.
Spock said that most people
are more interested in his views
on child care than his politics.
When he was indicted, the
popular accusation was not that
he was an anarchist so much as
that he was responsible for the
raising of a generation of "brats,
undisciplined, irresponsible . . .
and unpatriotic — which meant
opposed to the war in Vietnam,"
he said.
He noted that during the first
22 years his book Baby and
Child C lare was out, he was never
accused of being permissive.
"Older people had no expla
nation for what had happened"
to their children. But their chil
dren opposed the war and
"Spock is also opposed to the
war, so the logical conclusion"
was that Spock was responsible
for their attitude, he said.
'Horrible letters'
"I believe there is no truth in it
at all. But that doesn't keep mill
ions of people from believing it. 1
still get horrible letters." Spock
said.
Since 1968, sales of his book
have been cut in half, from a
million to 400,000 copies per
year, he said.
"1 thought that with the war in
Vietnam receding" into the
past that criticism would stop,
Spock said. But in April. Mayor
Richard Daley of Chicago
blamed Spock for the bad shape
of the schools, and in Ontario the
premier said that Spock had
caused the low moral tone
among youth.
"I'm valuable as a scapegoat,"
said Spock.
But Spock said not to feel too
bad for him. His publisher will
be paying him royalties of 10
percent instead of six percent,
and he still has his monthly col
umn in Hedhook. Also, his
newly revised edition of Baby
and Child Care will be out in
April.
"I hope that the people who
say I was a corrupter (among
them former Vice President
Spiro Agnew) will remember
what happened to Agnew,"
said.

Bridge, Spock gave advice to
those wondering how to change
things.
"The only thing I know is to
get people organized, get a
majority and get them to take
over the government," he said.
First educate people, then
"have them well prepared for the
revolution that comes," he con
tinued.
'Get them mad'
"Make inflamed speeches. Get
them mad that they're paying for
Nixon's fine meals and fine
clothes."
Spock commented it is
surprising how unready most

Americans are to uncouple from
the two-party system.
He said there was always
somebody who would come up
after one of his speeches and say,
"Creat speech, but don't expect
me to waste my vote on you."
when the speech was about the
necessity for getting away from
the two parties.
"That's the only possible way
to change the system," he said.
He pointed out that both parties
had continued the Vietnam war
and are responsible for poor
medical care and education.
Recession not enough
"1 thought the recession
would be enough to open men's
eyes, but they go right on vot
ing" for the same two parties, he
said.
"It's going to take a much
more serious recession. But we
have to find a few organizers so
that when recession comes we'll
be ready," he continued.
This year Spock is the vice
presidential candidate for the
People's Party.
Spock was the party's presi
dential nominee in 1972.
"I didn't choose to run for
president in '72. My arm was
twisted," he said.
"Since I started with the high
est office, there was no place to
go but down."
Spock also mentioned that the
latest campaign contribution re
forms actually work against in
dependent parties, since they
limit individual contributions to
$1000.
Brainwashed
"Another thing that the
American people are brain
washed" into thinking "by the
proteges of the capitalist system
. . . (is that) the only thing that
makes Americans work is boo
dle," Spock said.
"Our campaign platform calls
for a progressive income tax" so
that effectively no one could
make more than $50,000 per
year.
•Spock noted that when he
mentions this in a speech, "one
of the first questions is '$50,000!
Don't you realize there'd be no
incentive?' " Spock said that he
was astounded that so much

money was not considered an
incentive to work.
Spock said that most people
are more interested in his views
on child care than his politics.
When he was indicted, the
popular accusation was not that
he was an anarchist so much as
that he was responsible for the
raising of a generation of "brats,
undisciplined, irresponsible . . .
and unpatriotic — which meant
opposed to the war in Vietnam,"
he said.
He noted that during the first
22 years his book Baby and
Child C lare was out, he was never
accused of being permissive.
"Older people had no expla
nation for what had happened"
to their children. But their chil
dren opposed the war and
"Spock is also opposed to the
war, so the logical conclusion"
was that Spock was responsible
for their attitude, he said.
'Horrible letters'
"I believe there is no truth in it
at all. But that doesn't keep mill
ions of people from believing it. 1
still get horrible letters." Spock
said.
Since 1968, sales of his book
have been cut in half, from a
million to 400,000 copies per
year, he said.
"1 thought that with the war in
Vietnam receding" into the
past that criticism would stop,
Spock said. But in April. Mayor
Richard Daley of Chicago
blamed Spock for the bad shape
of the schools, and in Ontario the
premier said that Spock had
caused the low moral tone
among youth.
"I'm valuable as a scapegoat,"
said Spock.
But Spock said not to feel too
bad for him. His publisher will
be paying him royalties of 10
percent instead of six percent,
and he still has his monthly col
umn in Hedhook. Also, his
newly revised edition of Baby
and Child Care will be out in
April.
"I hope that the people who
say I was a corrupter (among
them former Vice President
Spiro Agnew) will remember
what happened to Agnew,"
said.

Political organizers have to get
people "hot" about local issues,
because people can't become
very concerned about general is
sues, Dr. Benjamin Spock, a
child care expert and
peace activist, said last Wednes
day night at a private reception.
For example, he said when the
police bloodied people in Har
vard Square during the 19605,
the Harvard faculty voted over
whelmingly that ROTC was
"out," completely reversing
themselves from their earlier
position.
