# Asian Americans should seek own identity, says playwright

### Bill Sing 
Asian Americans have helped to eradicate
their own culture, according to Frank Chin, an
Asian American author, playwright and educator.
Chin spoke to about 50 persons last Wednesday
night in Junipero House.
"By destroying our own history, we can destroy
ourselves as people and also destroy our iden
tity," Chin said. "The situation is much like the
ugly duckling who hates itself because it is cut off
from its true identity as a swan."
Chin's play "Year of the Dragon," which was
about a Chinese-American family, appeared on
nationwide educational television last year. He is
noted for his realistic portrayal of Asian Ameri
cans. He is among a group of writers trying to
change what they see as negative images and mis
conceptions of Asian Americans.
Chin said popular white American culture has
portrayed Asian Americans as a race of "passive
littie yellow people." Images such as Charlie
Chan and Shangri La have perpetrated this myth
even to the extent that Asian Americans them
selves have believed these images and fulfilled
them, according to Chin.
"Up until this century Asian Americans were
never passive and timid people," said Chin.
"Suddenly in the '40s came World War 11. Seeing
the Japanese Americans put into relocation
camps, made us cut out everything that we

thought would offend whites. We didn't want to
be bad yellows; we wanted to be good yellows."
Modern media stereotypes have helped keep
Asian Americans unduly passive, Chin com
mented.
"The first immigrants and their descendants
here were strongly independent and determined,
but never passive. Americans get the idea at pas
sivity from images like Caine in the television
show Kung Fu, images which simply are not
true," Chin remarked.
"Ours is not a history of humiliation and pas
sive endurance. But historically Asian Americans
have been made to feel inferior. History books
have ignored our accomplishments and our ex
periences. Not one name from the 10,000 Chinese
Americans who built the transcontinental rail
road survives in the history books."
Chin's works are characterized by the use of
what he calls "language unique to the Asian
American experience." Chin cited reasons of op
pression and self-contempt as accounting for the
general lack of expression and loss of identity
among Asian Americans today.
"People ask me, 'Why don't Asian Americans
speak up more in school?' "Chin said. "Well, one
reason is that every time we open our mouths they
correct our English. 'We've got to talk English the
way whites talk it because it is 'their language.'

reason is that every time we open our mouths they
correct our English. 'We've got to talk English the
way whites talk it because it is 'their language.'
Asian Americans have helped to eradicate
their own culture, according to Frank Chin, an
Asian American author, playwright and educator.
Chin spoke to about 50 persons last Wednesday
night in Junipero House.
"By destroying our own history, we can destroy
ourselves as people and also destroy our iden
tity," Chin said. "The situation is much like the
ugly duckling who hates itself because it is cut off
from its true identity as a swan."
Chin's play "Year of the Dragon," which was
about a Chinese-American family, appeared on
nationwide educational television last year. He is
noted for his realistic portrayal of Asian Ameri
cans. He is among a group of writers trying to
change what they see as negative images and mis
conceptions of Asian Americans.
Chin said popular white American culture has
portrayed Asian Americans as a race of "passive
littie yellow people." Images such as Charlie
Chan and Shangri La have perpetrated this myth
even to the extent that Asian Americans them
selves have believed these images and fulfilled
them, according to Chin.
"Up until this century Asian Americans were
never passive and timid people," said Chin.
"Suddenly in the '40s came World War 11. Seeing
the Japanese Americans put into relocation
camps, made us cut out everything that we

thought would offend whites. We didn't want to
be bad yellows; we wanted to be good yellows."
Modern media stereotypes have helped keep
Asian Americans unduly passive, Chin com
mented.
"The first immigrants and their descendants
here were strongly independent and determined,
but never passive. Americans get the idea at pas
sivity from images like Caine in the television
show Kung Fu, images which simply are not
true," Chin remarked.
"Ours is not a history of humiliation and pas
sive endurance. But historically Asian Americans
have been made to feel inferior. History books
have ignored our accomplishments and our ex
periences. Not one name from the 10,000 Chinese
Americans who built the transcontinental rail
road survives in the history books."
Chin's works are characterized by the use of
what he calls "language unique to the Asian
American experience." Chin cited reasons of op
pression and self-contempt as accounting for the
general lack of expression and loss of identity
among Asian Americans today.
"People ask me, 'Why don't Asian Americans
speak up more in school?' "Chin said. "Well, one
reason is that every time we open our mouths they
correct our English. 'We've got to talk English the
way whites talk it because it is 'their language.'
