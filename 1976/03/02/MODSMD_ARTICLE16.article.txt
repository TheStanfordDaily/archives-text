Can you recommend a book for enthusiastic hut inexperienced
lovers? We would like to learn more about our bodies and makeour
lovemuking more varied, more exciting and more fulfilling.
There are many books to choose from, most of which can be
found in any large bookstore. From a purely personal bias, 1 think
Alex Comfort's Joy of Sex is one of the best. The tone of the book is
more humane and humorous than most. It doesn't just concentrate
on dozens of positions, but explains some of the psychological and
physical factors involved. The drawings are a trifle bland, true, but
on the whole I'd recommend both Joy of Sex and its sequel More
|oy.
Could you please tell me what a "rim" job is? Some people claim
that it should be pronounced "reem" job. Please clarify this mutter
if you can.
As with most slang terms, there seems to be some disagreement
over the most correct usage of rim job and ream job. They both refer
to the same part of the body, but possibly to different acts per
formed thereon. Rim job means the oral copulation of the anus with
stimulation by the tongue, according to The Underground Dictio
nary (UD). A Dictionary of Contemporary and Colloquial Slang
(ADCCS) agrees. Rut ADCCS defines ream as "to ream out some
one's ass," apparently through anal intercourse. That is the usage 1
had always heard, and it seems to make sense, since the American
Heritage Dictionary defines ream as "to form, shape, taper, or
enlarge a hole."
Is it possible that a person can "wear out" their sexual organs, or
are they not subject to this no matter how much they are used?
The Under Covers special research team has been studying this
question intensively for several weeks. When last heard from, they
had not come up with the answer to your query, but they did report
many breakthroughs in the interests of sex research.
So 1 contacted Connie Starr, a nurse practitioner at Cowell, who
assures me that there is no danger of wearing out one's private parts
through overuse. (1 wonder if the repeated exercise wouldn't just
make them stronger.)
"Of course, you can wear yourself out, physically," she adds.
This applies equally to men and women.

Why does a woman stop menstrating when in water, i.e. swim
ming pool, bathtub, etc.?
"Women don't stop menstruating in water. The only thing that
stops it is the end of her period. Water has nothing to do with it. 1
wonder where they got that idea?" says Connie Starr. If you have
evidence that some women do stop menstruating while in pools or
tubs, medical science would like to hear from you, I'm sure.
The response to our plea for questions was gratifying. It's nice to
know a few people out there are still interested. But don't stop now.
The current backlog will only be good for three or four more
columns. Address your letters to "Under Covers," Stanford Daily,

Can you recommend a book for enthusiastic hut inexperienced
lovers? We would like to learn more about our bodies and makeour
lovemuking more varied, more exciting and more fulfilling.
There are many books to choose from, most of which can be
found in any large bookstore. From a purely personal bias, 1 think
Alex Comfort's Joy of Sex is one of the best. The tone of the book is
more humane and humorous than most. It doesn't just concentrate
on dozens of positions, but explains some of the psychological and
physical factors involved. The drawings are a trifle bland, true, but
on the whole I'd recommend both Joy of Sex and its sequel More
|oy.
Could you please tell me what a "rim" job is? Some people claim
that it should be pronounced "reem" job. Please clarify this mutter
if you can.
As with most slang terms, there seems to be some disagreement
over the most correct usage of rim job and ream job. They both refer
to the same part of the body, but possibly to different acts per
formed thereon. Rim job means the oral copulation of the anus with
stimulation by the tongue, according to The Underground Dictio
nary (UD). A Dictionary of Contemporary and Colloquial Slang
(ADCCS) agrees. Rut ADCCS defines ream as "to ream out some
one's ass," apparently through anal intercourse. That is the usage 1
had always heard, and it seems to make sense, since the American
Heritage Dictionary defines ream as "to form, shape, taper, or
enlarge a hole."
Is it possible that a person can "wear out" their sexual organs, or
are they not subject to this no matter how much they are used?
The Under Covers special research team has been studying this
question intensively for several weeks. When last heard from, they
had not come up with the answer to your query, but they did report
many breakthroughs in the interests of sex research.
So 1 contacted Connie Starr, a nurse practitioner at Cowell, who
assures me that there is no danger of wearing out one's private parts
through overuse. (1 wonder if the repeated exercise wouldn't just
make them stronger.)
"Of course, you can wear yourself out, physically," she adds.
This applies equally to men and women.

Why does a woman stop menstrating when in water, i.e. swim
ming pool, bathtub, etc.?
"Women don't stop menstruating in water. The only thing that
stops it is the end of her period. Water has nothing to do with it. 1
wonder where they got that idea?" says Connie Starr. If you have
evidence that some women do stop menstruating while in pools or
tubs, medical science would like to hear from you, I'm sure.
The response to our plea for questions was gratifying. It's nice to
know a few people out there are still interested. But don't stop now.
