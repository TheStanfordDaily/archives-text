## Chapin benefit was enchanting 
### Karen Caesar 
Oh Harry, you do it every time.
How any performer can be so
consistently entertaining, so
confoundedly charming, so in
credibly talented is beyond
human comprehension. 1 just
don't know how you do it.
For the benefit of the poor
souls who were not able to at
tend Harry Chapin's "benefit"
performance for the Bureau ot
Western Mythology (a new
theatre group consisting of a lot
of Stanford grads — they got the
name off a Firesign Theatre al
bum) at the Stanford Music Hall
last Wednesday night, a brief re
capitulation is the least 1 can
provide. But truly, truly, you
should have been there.
He sang for two hours, accom
panied only by his acoustic
guitar. His usual back-up band,
which he introduced anyway,
was not there. Yet through the
course of the evening, their ab
sence was hardly noticed. Harry
— with hoarse voice, inimitable
"story songs," and guitar —
were enough to fill the au
ditorium with some of the finest,
most story-telling music around
today.
He opened with "Any Old
King of, Day," a very pretty,
low-key cut from Heads and
Tules, one of his earliest albums.
He proceeded to tell us about his
story songs, and why. unfortu
nately. the great majority of them
don't receive much airplay,
especially on AM radio.
"I seem to have a congenital

inability to write a song under
five minutes long," said Harry.
Most top 40 stations like to play
songs three minutes long, or un
der. Consequently, the vast
majority of his involved, story
song-epics (which range in
length from three-and-a-half to
over nine minutes) go unheard
by most, with the exception of
the faithful fans who buy his al
bums.
This was a perfect lead-in to
his next song, "W*o*L*D",
which he described as being "on
the charts for about fifteen mi
nutes."
The music and lyrics in this
number conjure up the perfect
image of your average AM disc
jockey.
"I am the morning DJ at
W*o*L*D /playing all the hits
fur you wherever you maybe/the
bright good-morning voice
who's heard but never seen/feel
ing all of 45, going on 15."
Harry even provided a colorful
musical interpretation using
that rich, expressive voice and
melodious guitar to substitute
for the full orchestra that backed
him on the original recording.
The orchestra was hardly mis
sed.
He continued with his own
favorite song, "Better Place to
Be," another one of his earlier
more intricate songs and a real
soap opera, about nine minutes
in length.
"30,000 Pounds of Bananas"
provided a lot of comic-relief

and elicited lots of audience
participation. Based on a real
happening in Scranton, Pa.,
where a banana truck "smeared
for 400 yards down the hill that
leads into Scranton, Pa.," the
song was Harry's one half
hearted attempt at writing
"country" style. It still came out
victorious.
Many songs later, he per
formed" "Cat's in the Cradle,"
one of his few full-fledged AM
hits. When the audience knew
the chorus word-for-word, and
sang it without him, he called it
"the ultimate compliment for a
songwriter."
Attempting to conclude with
"Taxi," he unfortunately made a
mockery out of this beautiful,
sensitive song by turning it into
a sort of Ted Mack Amateur
Hour, getting people up onstage
where they either just stood and
hummed or made asses of them

selves.
It was a shame he had to do
this (he did something of this
sort with another moving song,
"Mr. Tanner"), but 1 suppose
that after performing it
thousands of times in the exact
same way, he would get very
bored with it unless he added
something, like a little
audience-participation.
Encores later, he finally ended
with "Crykle," a song that was a
hit with everyone who recorded
it except Harry. Yet he wrote it,
and he played and sang it as only
Harry Chapin could — exquis
itely.
Harry was preceded by two
excellent opening acts, talented
acoustic guitarist William Ac
kerman, who played interesting
songs with strange titles, and
Don and Pilar, who bill
themslves as "An Experience in
Music."

where a banana truck "smeared
for 400 yards down the hill that
leads into Scranton, Pa.," the
song was Harry's one half
hearted attempt at writing
"country" style. It still came out
victorious.
Many songs later, he per
formed" "Cat's in the Cradle,"
one of his few full-fledged AM
hits. When the audience knew
the chorus word-for-word, and
sang it without him, he called it
"the ultimate compliment for a
songwriter."
Attempting to conclude with
"Taxi," he unfortunately made a
mockery out of this beautiful,
sensitive song by turning it into
a sort of Ted Mack Amateur
Hour, getting people up onstage
where they either just stood and
hummed or made asses of them

selves.
It was a shame he had to do
this (he did something of this
sort with another moving song,
"Mr. Tanner"), but 1 suppose
that after performing it
thousands of times in the exact
same way, he would get very
bored with it unless he added
something, like a little
audience-participation.
Encores later, he finally ended
with "Crykle," a song that was a
hit with everyone who recorded
it except Harry. Yet he wrote it,
and he played and sang it as only
Harry Chapin could — exquis
itely.
Harry was preceded by two
excellent opening acts, talented
acoustic guitarist William Ac
kerman, who played interesting
songs with strange titles, and
Don and Pilar, who bill
themslves as "An Experience in
Music."

TAXl—Harry Chapin, recording artist known for his "story
songs,"performed in a benefit for the Bureau ot Western Mythol
ogy theater company, which is presenting the drama Dork of the
Moon at the Stanford Music Hall this month.
Oh Harry, you do it every time.
How any performer can be so
consistently entertaining, so
confoundedly charming, so in
credibly talented is beyond
human comprehension. 1 just
don't know how you do it.
For the benefit of the poor
souls who were not able to at
tend Harry Chapin's "benefit"
performance for the Bureau ot
Western Mythology (a new
theatre group consisting of a lot
of Stanford grads — they got the
name off a Firesign Theatre al
bum) at the Stanford Music Hall
last Wednesday night, a brief re
capitulation is the least 1 can
provide. But truly, truly, you
should have been there.
He sang for two hours, accom
panied only by his acoustic
guitar. His usual back-up band,
which he introduced anyway,
was not there. Yet through the
course of the evening, their ab
sence was hardly noticed. Harry
— with hoarse voice, inimitable
"story songs," and guitar —
were enough to fill the au
ditorium with some of the finest,
most story-telling music around
today.
He opened with "Any Old
King of, Day," a very pretty,
low-key cut from Heads and
Tules, one of his earliest albums.
He proceeded to tell us about his
story songs, and why. unfortu
nately. the great majority of them
don't receive much airplay,
especially on AM radio.
"I seem to have a congenital

inability to write a song under
five minutes long," said Harry.
Most top 40 stations like to play
songs three minutes long, or un
der. Consequently, the vast
majority of his involved, story
song-epics (which range in
length from three-and-a-half to
over nine minutes) go unheard
by most, with the exception of
the faithful fans who buy his al
bums.
This was a perfect lead-in to
his next song, "W*o*L*D",
which he described as being "on
the charts for about fifteen mi
nutes."
The music and lyrics in this
number conjure up the perfect
image of your average AM disc
jockey.
"I am the morning DJ at
W*o*L*D /playing all the hits
fur you wherever you maybe/the
bright good-morning voice
who's heard but never seen/feel
ing all of 45, going on 15."
Harry even provided a colorful
musical interpretation using
that rich, expressive voice and
melodious guitar to substitute
for the full orchestra that backed
him on the original recording.
The orchestra was hardly mis
sed.
He continued with his own
favorite song, "Better Place to
Be," another one of his earlier
more intricate songs and a real
soap opera, about nine minutes
in length.
"30,000 Pounds of Bananas"
provided a lot of comic-relief

and elicited lots of audience
participation. Based on a real
happening in Scranton, Pa.,
where a banana truck "smeared
for 400 yards down the hill that

low-key cut from Heads and
Tules, one of his earliest albums.
He proceeded to tell us about his
story songs, and why. unfortu
nately. the great majority of them
don't receive much airplay,
especially on AM radio.
"I seem to have a congenital

inability to write a song under
five minutes long," said Harry.
Most top 40 stations like to play
songs three minutes long, or un
der. Consequently, the vast
majority of his involved, story
song-epics (which range in
length from three-and-a-half to
over nine minutes) go unheard
by most, with the exception of
the faithful fans who buy his al
bums.
This was a perfect lead-in to
his next song, "W*o*L*D",
which he described as being "on
the charts for about fifteen mi
nutes."
The music and lyrics in this
number conjure up the perfect
image of your average AM disc
jockey.
"I am the morning DJ at
W*o*L*D /playing all the hits
fur you wherever you maybe/the
bright good-morning voice
who's heard but never seen/feel
ing all of 45, going on 15."
Harry even provided a colorful
musical interpretation using
that rich, expressive voice and
melodious guitar to substitute
for the full orchestra that backed
him on the original recording.
The orchestra was hardly mis
sed.
He continued with his own
favorite song, "Better Place to
Be," another one of his earlier
more intricate songs and a real
soap opera, about nine minutes
in length.
"30,000 Pounds of Bananas"
provided a lot of comic-relief

and elicited lots of audience
participation. Based on a real
happening in Scranton, Pa.,
where a banana truck "smeared
for 400 yards down the hill that
leads into Scranton, Pa.," the
song was Harry's one half
hearted attempt at writing
"country" style. It still came out
victorious.
Many songs later, he per
formed" "Cat's in the Cradle,"
one of his few full-fledged AM
hits. When the audience knew
the chorus word-for-word, and
sang it without him, he called it
"the ultimate compliment for a
songwriter."
Attempting to conclude with
"Taxi," he unfortunately made a
mockery out of this beautiful,
sensitive song by turning it into
a sort of Ted Mack Amateur
Hour, getting people up onstage
where they either just stood and
hummed or made asses of them

selves.
It was a shame he had to do
this (he did something of this
sort with another moving song,
"Mr. Tanner"), but 1 suppose
that after performing it
thousands of times in the exact
same way, he would get very
bored with it unless he added
something, like a little
audience-participation.
Encores later, he finally ended
with "Crykle," a song that was a
hit with everyone who recorded
it except Harry. Yet he wrote it,
and he played and sang it as only
Harry Chapin could — exquis
itely.
Harry was preceded by two
excellent opening acts, talented
acoustic guitarist William Ac
kerman, who played interesting
songs with strange titles, and
Don and Pilar, who bill
themslves as "An Experience in
Music."
