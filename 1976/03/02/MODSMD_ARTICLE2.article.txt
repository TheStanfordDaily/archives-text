# $200,000 loss follows computer conversion
## 
### Bert Bower 
A plan to use the University's new
IBM 370/168 computer to process stu
dent service data was rejected as un
feasible last week and has cost the
University an estimated $200,000, ac
cording to Vice Provost of Research
William Massy.
The Stanford Center for Information
Processing (SCIP) agreed in August
1974, to work with University ad
ministrators to convert the processes
of registration, admissions, financial
aid and student fee payments from a
smaller IBM 370/145 computer to the
larger IBM 370/168.
"It is apparent now that the im
plementation of the planned system is
not feasible by May IRegistrar Sally
Mahoney said. The decision will not
affect present student services, she ad
ded.
The primary problem that led to the
decision to abandon the conversion
project was an unexpected overload on
the IBM 370/168 and the apparent
"mismatch" of the student services
system with the new computer, SCIP
Director Charles Dickens said.
Recoverable loss
He said, however, that as much as 75
percent of the $200,000 loss could be
"recovered if we ultimately decide to
adopt a system that uses the IBM 370/
168."
Dickens stressed that the University
has not completely ruled out the pos
sibility of using the IBM 370/168 for
student services and may decide to use
it differently." If such a decision is
made, the University will be able to
salvage much of the developmental
costs.
If the University had developed a
"simpler mode of operation" to pro
cess student services data it is possible
"the costs would not have been as
great," Dickens said.
But, he added, "The University de

cided 18 months ago that it would in
crease the degree of sophistication of
the computer processing of student
services."
SCIP service questioned
When the development plan became
unfeasible, however, it raised serious
questions about SCIP service.
"I don't feel SCIP has, in all cases,
been sensitive enough to the needs of
its users," Assoc. Registrar Bob
Houghton said. "SCIP had claimed the
software was completed for operation
by the Registrar's Office, when in fact,
the work had not been completed, at
least not satisfactorily."
Houghton said he believes that SCIP
"undertook to do more than it was
capable of doing" when it tried to con
vert the old IBM 370/145 computer sys
tem to the new IBM 370/168 computer.
Massy admitted that there had been

"surprises and natural uncertainties"
during the development of the new
project.
'If we'd known . . . '
"In retrospect, if we'd known what
was going to happen, we would have
done something else," he said. "My
guess is that about one-half of the
program's cost is sunk." '
He noted that most of the Universi
ty's loss was for labor specially hired to
work on the project and "not for
people already working for the Uni
versity."
Massy predicted, however, that no
employes would be laid off because
the University still needs program
mers to solve the problem.
"As painful and disappointing as
the decision was for us and despite the
sunk costs, we are stil l here to serve the
community," Massy said.
Alternatives
He outlined some alternatives Uni
versity administrators are considering
as possible solutions to the problem of
student services computing:
—use a smaller computer such as an
IBM 370/135 or an IBM 370/145;
—convert to a batch system that can
adapt itself to the IBM 370/168, in
which data would be entered through
card readers;
—try to make the conversion plan
feasible, but push the deadline to the
spring of 1977 and use the present
method until then; or
—buy a newly developed mini
computer system that could handle
student services separately.
SCIP and the student services com
puting group will decide on an alter
native within the next two weeks, ac
cording to Massy.
Outside review

administrative computing here has
been proposed with immediate atten
