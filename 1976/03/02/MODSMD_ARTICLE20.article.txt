The birth of Justice: the vindication of a mat
ricide. The story of Orestes' vengeance for his
father's death, slain by his unfaithful mother, has
held'audiences enrapt for two and a half millenia.
Aischvlos' trilogy. The Agamemnon, The Liba
tion Bearers and The Eumenides, has been a re
past for all people, whether taken as a small tale ot
tragedy or. more deeply, as the projected com
plexities of personal and civil justice.
So, too. would the Oresteia have given birth to
reflection and dramatically entertained us, but tor
the hubris of the incompetent. Greek productions
were not austere, nor the sculpture of Praxiteles
unadorned. Painted or gilded, however, they were
never finger painted in so clumsy a dayglow. 1 he
Stanford Drama Department's production, di
rected by Yannis Chioles, is a classic lost in chaos.
The soul has been dissolved in a collection of
devices which vie for attention amidst mediocre
acting.
Of the trilogy, only the final two plays have
been produced with any finesse. The first play,
The Agamemnon, has become a parody ot theater.
Agamemnon himself (John Bracci) has become a
buffoon, scarcely credible as a man capable of

slaving his daughter, even in sacrifice. The
Agamemnon falls short of disaster only through
Kassandra's (Susan Ehrlich) ability as an actress.
She convincingly portrays both her angry proph
esying of violence and her resignation to fate.
Here at last is a clear note: a character whose
actions grow from her role as mantic slave.
As the Libation Bearers opens a breath of salva
tion enters, for the setting of the tomb, below the
twinned eyes of projected art, is stunning. Such a
setting deserves adroit acting and Orestes, played
with ease and excellence by Joseph Siravo. pro
vides such an element. As the energy climbs
throughout the remainder of the production,
Siravo is a focus. Never does he lose touch with
the emotions which storm the stage; never does he
falter from his consummate portrayal of a man
caught between gods. Delphi and Athene's tem
ple share the power and beauty of setting found at
Agamemnon's tomb, and again is Orestes the
powerful actor.
Although the final plays provide spectacle and
allow rein to a worthy actor, the production as a
whole is a disappointment. Fine orchestration
and eerily spectacular backdrops are not suffi
cient. Although there was, apparently, no effort
spared, effort alone is no substitute for excellence.
