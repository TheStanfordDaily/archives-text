# Campus film makes Oscar bid

ArthurundLilJie, a film produced in
the Communication Department, has
been nominated for an Academy
Award this year in the Documentary
Short category.
Produced by recent Stanford M.A.
graduates Jon Else and Kristine
Samuelson along with Asst. Com
munication Prof. Steven Kovacs, the
film is a portrait of 89-year-old Arthur
Mayer and his wife Lillie, 86, who visit
the University each winter. Mayer
teaches Communication 141, "History
of Film."
Although Kovacs was responsible
for most of the historical research and
Else and Samuelson for the actual pro
duction, all are quick to agree that the
film was a communal effort.
"The three of us worked together,"
noted Kovacs. "No one had a larger
role than the other and many of our

contributions overlapped."
The Oscar contender has two main
points, according to Kovacs. Frovidi ng
a history of Mayer's life in the motion
picture industry, the film also deals
with the problem of growing old, he
explained.
According to Samuelson, "the most
important thing to the Mayers was to
show that when you get old, you don't
have to be useless."
Traces career
The film traces Mayer's career from
his first job with Samuel Goldwyn to
his present work as a lecturer here as
well as at Dartmouth and University of
Southern California. Mayer is also the
author of several books about the
movies.
During his career Mayer was head of
publicity for Paramount, then became
an importer of foreign films and later
operated the famous Rialto Theater in

New York. His all-horror movie policy
at the Rialto earned him the title,
"merchant of menace."
"The Mayers are extraordinary
people," said Else. "They embody cer
tain values and truths that will disap
pear with them. We felt they should be
recorded."
Lack of money
According to Kovacs, the main prob
lem in making the film was lack of
money. Although awarded a $15,000
grant from the National Endowment
for the Arts, the producers still had to
"convince a lot of people to contribute
their time."
Don Rugoff, an importer of films and
personal friend of the Mayers, has pro
vided financial assistance by holding
movie benefits for the film.
German director Lina Wertmuller's
latest movie, Seven Beauties, will be
shown tonight at 7:30 and 9:45 in
Memorial Auditorium, with the pro
ceeds going to the documentary.
The film was shot here and on loca
tion at Dartmouth and in New York
City where the Mayers are seen with
close friend Pauline Kael, film critic
for The New Yorker. In this scene, the
Mayers leisurely talk with Kael about
contemporary movies and actors.
"The whole point behind this
scene," said Samuelson, "was to show
they're involved in current films, too."
Film premiere
The film's premiere was at the New
York Film Festival last October. Ac
cording to Kovacs, this was the film's
"prerequisite" for the Oscar nomina
tion since all 16mm films must first be
shown at a recognized film festival.

They then sent it in to a special
documentary committee consisting of
documentary film makers and writers
who picked five finalists, he
explained.
Calling the nomination the "best
part about the whole thing." Kovacs
predicts that the "chances for winning
are pretty good because of the subject
â€” it's about two great people and the
history of film. After all," he said,
"the people who vote have spent their
lives in the motion pictures."
Despite what they call the "hysteria
of excitement" surrounding the nomi
nation, Else and Samuelson are ex
cited about the possible Oscar.
"I get to wear a tuxedo for the first
time since my senior prom," joked
Else.
