ArthurundLilJie, a film produced in
the Communication Department, has
been nominated for an Academy
Award this year in the Documentary
Short category.
Produced by recent Stanford M.A.
graduates Jon Else and Kristine
Samuelson along with Asst. Com
munication Prof. Steven Kovacs, the
film is a portrait of 89-year-old Arthur
Mayer and his wife Lillie, 86, who visit
the University each winter. Mayer
teaches Communication 141, "History
of Film."
Although Kovacs was responsible
for most of the historical research and
Else and Samuelson for the actual pro
duction, all are quick to agree that the
film was a communal effort.
"The three of us worked together,"
noted Kovacs. "No one had a larger
role than the other and many of our

contributions overlapped."
The Oscar contender has two main
points, according to Kovacs. Frovidi ng
a history of Mayer's life in the motion
picture industry, the film also deals
with the problem of growing old, he
explained.
According to Samuelson, "the most
important thing to the Mayers was to
show that when you get old, you don't
have to be useless."
Traces career
The film traces Mayer's career from
his first job with Samuel Goldwyn to
his present work as a lecturer here as
well as at Dartmouth and University of
Southern California. Mayer is also the
author of several books about the
movies.
During his career Mayer was head of
publicity for Paramount, then became
an importer of foreign films and later
operated the famous Rialto Theater in

New York. His all-horror movie policy
at the Rialto earned him the title,
"merchant of menace."
"The Mayers are extraordinary
people," said Else. "They embody cer
tain values and truths that will disap
pear with them. We felt they should be
recorded."
Lack of money
According to Kovacs, the main prob
lem in making the film was lack of
money. Although awarded a $15,000
grant from the National Endowment
for the Arts, the producers still had to
"convince a lot of people to contribute
their time."
Don Rugoff, an importer of films and
personal friend of the Mayers, has pro
vided financial assistance by holding
movie benefits for the film.
