# Boyle blends Catholicism, activism
## 
### John Burner 
As Father John Duryea makes a controversial departure
from the Catholic ministry at Memorial Church, the con
troversial Father Eugene Boyle comes to take his place.
Duryea resigned as chaplain at Stanford and pastor of
St. Ann's Chapel, Palo Alto, in January, after he an
nounced his plans to be married.
Boyle brings with him a record of dedication and ser
vice to others. He has worked extensively with Martin
Luther King in the civil rights movement, with Caesar
Chavez in the farm worker cause and with Religious
Studies I'rof. Robert McAfee Brown in both the peace and
civil rights movements.
In addition, he came very close to being elected to the
California State Assembly. His involvement with social
and political issues has made this native San Franciscan
one of the most well-known, dedicated and controversial
priests in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Fran
cisco.
No reminiscing
But for Boyle this is no time for reminiscing on past
accomplishments. He is looking ahead and he knows
there is work to be done.
Rising quickly from behind his desk. Boyle sets down
his book and eagerly stretches out his hand to greet a
visitor. His friendly brown eyes extend a greeting from
behind his black-rimmed glasses as the corners of his
mouth curl into a toothy smile.
At r>4, Boyle retains a healthy, robust appearance. His
tanned face highlights lively eyes and a prominent nose.
His receding hairline has not robbed him of all his black
hair.
He recalls how he debated whether coming to the Uni
versity would be a retreat from his responsibilities in
"the struggle for justice, equality and liberation for
people."
'Frustrated intellectual'
But he confides that his friends consider him somewhat
of a "frustrated intellectual" and that he has enjoyed and
valued his contacts with young people. He says he has

finally decided that this position would enable him to
carry on his work in a new and perhaps more influential
way.
"This doesn't mean that my only reason for accepting
was to bring about the inclusion into the ministry of St.
Ann's and the Stanford Newman Center the whole matter
of social concern," he adds. "I consider that very impor
tant, but I also believe in the whole religious endeavor, the
whole matter of liturgy and worship."
He emphasizes that he will not force his social and
political viewpoints on others but, rather,by his witness
simply be a constant reminder "that integral to preaching
the gospel is working for justice and the transformation of
this world."
Social justice
Boyle's presence in many marches and picket lines tes
tifies to his concern for social justice. But he cautions
young people to distinguish between religious and non
religious social action.
"So many people get into this without any real depth
and understanding and they burn out," he says. "Believe
me, it's easy to stay in a movement when it's at its high
point, but it's at the rough times that it's tough to stay with
it. Then you need the spiritual strength and sustenance."
"The mindless social activist is a menace," he said. He
smiles, though, as he remembers his first protest march
experience as a young priest in San Francisco.
Embarrassment
"All we were doing was marching around the City
Hall . . . I'll never forget my feeling, I was really embarras
sed," he admits. "I didn't know if I was doing the right
thing or not because in the beginning of my involvement
in thisl had notheology toback meup . . . ultimately I had
to form my own."
He says that this nagging doubt about whether he was
really doing, "priestly work" stayed with him for some
time "like some kind of post-nasal drip." But after over
coming this uncertainty he went on to take part in many
effective marches and protests, such as the Selma,
Alabama march with King and the Delano. California

march with Chavez.
Brown, who is a close friend and fellow worker of Boyle
in these causes, calls Boyle "a splendid exemplar of the
Catholic tradition at its best" since he "manages to com
bine a genuine concern for the life of the spirit with a very
active personal engagement on the social and political
scene."
He's needed
Brown mentions but a few of the many areas in which
Boyle has provided leadership, such as the farm workers'
struggle, the protests against the Vietnam war and capital
punishment. He also points out the efforts Boyle has made
in "reaching out to rabbis and Protestant ministers, as well
as to his fellow Catholic clergymen."
Boyle emphasizes his desire for open dialogue on doc
trine with other Christian denominations and other relig
ions.
"I've been an ecumenist from the very beginning," he
says.
Church bureaucracy
He says he has had some struggles with his own
church's bureaucracy, but says they haven't dampened his
love for the Church, which he regards as "a very special
presence of the love of God on earth."
"For me to leave the Church would be spiritual
suicide," he says.
His narrow loss in the Assembly election did not
leave him completely frustrated and skeptical of the polit
ical process itself. Rather, he attributes the loss to the
apathy of some of his potential supporters.
Actually, the only thing which can possibly frustrate
Boyle is boredom, which he fights with a passion. When
he's not preaching the gospel from the pulpit or marching
in the streets, he's flying through the clouds. He is a
licensed private pilot, and took up flying 10 years ago
because he "couldn't stand the drive to Delano" and has
pursued it as a hobby ever since.
"1 feel I still have energy and I still want todo things,mil
that's not going to last forever," he says.

"I've been an ecumenist from the very beginning," he
says.
Church bureaucracy
He says he has had some struggles with his own
church's bureaucracy, but says they haven't dampened his
love for the Church, which he regards as "a very special
presence of the love of God on earth."
"For me to leave the Church would be spiritual
suicide," he says.
His narrow loss in the Assembly election did not
leave him completely frustrated and skeptical of the polit
ical process itself. Rather, he attributes the loss to the
apathy of some of his potential supporters.
Actually, the only thing which can possibly frustrate
Boyle is boredom, which he fights with a passion. When
he's not preaching the gospel from the pulpit or marching
in the streets, he's flying through the clouds. He is a
licensed private pilot, and took up flying 10 years ago
because he "couldn't stand the drive to Delano" and has
pursued it as a hobby ever since.
"1 feel I still have energy and I still want todo things,mil
that's not going to last forever," he says.


Eugene Boyte
As Father John Duryea makes a controversial departure
from the Catholic ministry at Memorial Church, the con
troversial Father Eugene Boyle comes to take his place.
Duryea resigned as chaplain at Stanford and pastor of
St. Ann's Chapel, Palo Alto, in January, after he an
nounced his plans to be married.
Boyle brings with him a record of dedication and ser
vice to others. He has worked extensively with Martin
Luther King in the civil rights movement, with Caesar
Chavez in the farm worker cause and with Religious
Studies I'rof. Robert McAfee Brown in both the peace and
civil rights movements.
In addition, he came very close to being elected to the
California State Assembly. His involvement with social
and political issues has made this native San Franciscan
one of the most well-known, dedicated and controversial
priests in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Fran
cisco.
No reminiscing
But for Boyle this is no time for reminiscing on past
accomplishments. He is looking ahead and he knows
there is work to be done.
Rising quickly from behind his desk. Boyle sets down
his book and eagerly stretches out his hand to greet a
visitor. His friendly brown eyes extend a greeting from
behind his black-rimmed glasses as the corners of his
mouth curl into a toothy smile.
At r>4, Boyle retains a healthy, robust appearance. His
tanned face highlights lively eyes and a prominent nose.
His receding hairline has not robbed him of all his black
hair.
He recalls how he debated whether coming to the Uni
versity would be a retreat from his responsibilities in
"the struggle for justice, equality and liberation for
people."
'Frustrated intellectual'
But he confides that his friends consider him somewhat
of a "frustrated intellectual" and that he has enjoyed and
valued his contacts with young people. He says he has

finally decided that this position would enable him to
carry on his work in a new and perhaps more influential
way.
"This doesn't mean that my only reason for accepting
was to bring about the inclusion into the ministry of St.
Ann's and the Stanford Newman Center the whole matter
of social concern," he adds. "I consider that very impor
tant, but I also believe in the whole religious endeavor, the
whole matter of liturgy and worship."
He emphasizes that he will not force his social and
political viewpoints on others but, rather,by his witness
simply be a constant reminder "that integral to preaching
the gospel is working for justice and the transformation of
this world."
Social justice
Boyle's presence in many marches and picket lines tes
tifies to his concern for social justice. But he cautions
young people to distinguish between religious and non
religious social action.
"So many people get into this without any real depth
and understanding and they burn out," he says. "Believe
me, it's easy to stay in a movement when it's at its high
point, but it's at the rough times that it's tough to stay with
it. Then you need the spiritual strength and sustenance."
"The mindless social activist is a menace," he said. He
smiles, though, as he remembers his first protest march
experience as a young priest in San Francisco.
Embarrassment
"All we were doing was marching around the City
Hall . . . I'll never forget my feeling, I was really embarras
sed," he admits. "I didn't know if I was doing the right
thing or not because in the beginning of my involvement
in thisl had notheology toback meup . . . ultimately I had
to form my own."
He says that this nagging doubt about whether he was
really doing, "priestly work" stayed with him for some
time "like some kind of post-nasal drip." But after over
coming this uncertainty he went on to take part in many
effective marches and protests, such as the Selma,
Alabama march with King and the Delano. California

march with Chavez.
Brown, who is a close friend and fellow worker of Boyle
in these causes, calls Boyle "a splendid exemplar of the
Catholic tradition at its best" since he "manages to com
bine a genuine concern for the life of the spirit with a very
active personal engagement on the social and political
scene."
He's needed
Brown mentions but a few of the many areas in which
Boyle has provided leadership, such as the farm workers'
struggle, the protests against the Vietnam war and capital
punishment. He also points out the efforts Boyle has made
in "reaching out to rabbis and Protestant ministers, as well
as to his fellow Catholic clergymen."
Boyle emphasizes his desire for open dialogue on doc
trine with other Christian denominations and other relig
ions.
"I've been an ecumenist from the very beginning," he
says.

in thisl had notheology toback meup . . . ultimately I had
to form my own."
He says that this nagging doubt about whether he was
really doing, "priestly work" stayed with him for some
time "like some kind of post-nasal drip." But after over
coming this uncertainty he went on to take part in many
effective marches and protests, such as the Selma,
Alabama march with King and the Delano. California

march with Chavez.
Brown, who is a close friend and fellow worker of Boyle
in these causes, calls Boyle "a splendid exemplar of the
Catholic tradition at its best" since he "manages to com
bine a genuine concern for the life of the spirit with a very
active personal engagement on the social and political
scene."
He's needed
Brown mentions but a few of the many areas in which
Boyle has provided leadership, such as the farm workers'
struggle, the protests against the Vietnam war and capital
punishment. He also points out the efforts Boyle has made
in "reaching out to rabbis and Protestant ministers, as well
as to his fellow Catholic clergymen."
Boyle emphasizes his desire for open dialogue on doc
trine with other Christian denominations and other relig
ions.
"I've been an ecumenist from the very beginning," he
says.
Church bureaucracy
He says he has had some struggles with his own
church's bureaucracy, but says they haven't dampened his
love for the Church, which he regards as "a very special
presence of the love of God on earth."
"For me to leave the Church would be spiritual
suicide," he says.
His narrow loss in the Assembly election did not
leave him completely frustrated and skeptical of the polit
ical process itself. Rather, he attributes the loss to the
apathy of some of his potential supporters.
Actually, the only thing which can possibly frustrate
Boyle is boredom, which he fights with a passion. When
he's not preaching the gospel from the pulpit or marching
in the streets, he's flying through the clouds. He is a
licensed private pilot, and took up flying 10 years ago
because he "couldn't stand the drive to Delano" and has
pursued it as a hobby ever since.
"1 feel I still have energy and I still want todo things,mil
that's not going to last forever," he says.

As Father John Duryea makes a controversial departure
from the Catholic ministry at Memorial Church, the con
troversial Father Eugene Boyle comes to take his place.
Duryea resigned as chaplain at Stanford and pastor of
St. Ann's Chapel, Palo Alto, in January, after he an
nounced his plans to be married.
Boyle brings with him a record of dedication and ser
vice to others. He has worked extensively with Martin
Luther King in the civil rights movement, with Caesar
Chavez in the farm worker cause and with Religious
Studies I'rof. Robert McAfee Brown in both the peace and
civil rights movements.
In addition, he came very close to being elected to the
California State Assembly. His involvement with social
and political issues has made this native San Franciscan
one of the most well-known, dedicated and controversial
priests in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Fran
cisco.
No reminiscing
But for Boyle this is no time for reminiscing on past
accomplishments. He is looking ahead and he knows
there is work to be done.
Rising quickly from behind his desk. Boyle sets down
his book and eagerly stretches out his hand to greet a
visitor. His friendly brown eyes extend a greeting from
behind his black-rimmed glasses as the corners of his
mouth curl into a toothy smile.
At r>4, Boyle retains a healthy, robust appearance. His
tanned face highlights lively eyes and a prominent nose.
His receding hairline has not robbed him of all his black
hair.
He recalls how he debated whether coming to the Uni
versity would be a retreat from his responsibilities in
"the struggle for justice, equality and liberation for
people."
'Frustrated intellectual'
But he confides that his friends consider him somewhat
of a "frustrated intellectual" and that he has enjoyed and
valued his contacts with young people. He says he has

finally decided that this position would enable him to
carry on his work in a new and perhaps more influential
way.
"This doesn't mean that my only reason for accepting
was to bring about the inclusion into the ministry of St.
Ann's and the Stanford Newman Center the whole matter
of social concern," he adds. "I consider that very impor
tant, but I also believe in the whole religious endeavor, the
whole matter of liturgy and worship."
He emphasizes that he will not force his social and
political viewpoints on others but, rather,by his witness
simply be a constant reminder "that integral to preaching
the gospel is working for justice and the transformation of
this world."
Social justice
Boyle's presence in many marches and picket lines tes
tifies to his concern for social justice. But he cautions
young people to distinguish between religious and non
religious social action.
"So many people get into this without any real depth
and understanding and they burn out," he says. "Believe
me, it's easy to stay in a movement when it's at its high
point, but it's at the rough times that it's tough to stay with
it. Then you need the spiritual strength and sustenance."
"The mindless social activist is a menace," he said. He
smiles, though, as he remembers his first protest march
experience as a young priest in San Francisco.
Embarrassment
"All we were doing was marching around the City
Hall . . . I'll never forget my feeling, I was really embarras
sed," he admits. "I didn't know if I was doing the right
thing or not because in the beginning of my involvement
in thisl had notheology toback meup . . . ultimately I had
to form my own."
