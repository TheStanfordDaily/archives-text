We applaud the shuttle-bus service instituted last
week.
Such service can be of inestimable use to students.
We urge everyone to ride the buses, both because they
are an efficient means of transportation and because
the bus-service presumably will be kept if people ride
the buses.
However, we find it unfortunate that the University
has decided to shut down the shuttle-buses after April
for evaluation of their effectiveness. The University
should arrange to evaluate the program while the
buses are still running, in order to prevent the program
from losing its momentum.
