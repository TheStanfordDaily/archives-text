## Outlaws 
### 
President Gerald Ford's recent denunciation of
Cuban Premier Fidel Castro as "an international out
law" ranks as one of the most gauche and hypocritical
statements ever uttered by an American leader.
Ford castigated Castro for sending soldiers to inter
vene in Angola's civil war, contending that the action
violates international law. Yet as House minority
leader. Ford for years supported U.S. intervention in
the Vietnam civil war.
More than 500,000 U.S. troops fought in Vietnam at
the height of U.S. participation in the war there, in
comparison to the 12,000 member Cuban contingent
now in Angola.
Furthermore, the United States has intervened in the
Angolan civil war by sending advisers and supplies to
one side.
We also fail to see how Cuba's action in Angola is
any more ill-advised than was the American attempt in
1961 to overthrow the Castro regime by invading Cuba
via the Bay of Pigs.
Ford's comments were particularly tactless in light
of recent revelations that the CIA during the 1960s
repeatedly plotted to assassinate Castro. If Ford
wanted to denounce international outlawry, these
plots would have been a more fitting target for criti
cism.
Certainly the remarks made by Ford are inconsistent
with his Administration's recent attempts to improve
relations with Cuba.
It is obvious that Ford, who delivered his diatribe to
a Cuban-American audience in Miami, was making a>
desperate appeal for the Cuban vote in Florida's up
coming presidential primary.
While we recognize that Ford faces a difficult race in
Florida against Ronald Reagan, we wish Ford would
act less like a ward heeler and more like a statesman, by
stopping his trifling with grave international concerns
in an effort to win a few votes.
