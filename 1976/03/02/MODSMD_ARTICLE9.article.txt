# Require employers to state gay policies
## 
### 
The debate over whether
employers who discriminate on
the basis of sexual preference
should be denied use of the
Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC) and whether
employers should be forced to
state their policies toward hiring
gays, has raged for several
months.
About a month ago, the Com
mittee on Services to Students
(COSS) by a vote of 3-3, with one
abstention, rejected a ban on
employers discriminating on the
basis of sexual preference, Dut
voted 6-1 to require employers to
state their policy toward gays.
President Richard Lyman is ex
pected to announce sometime
this week his decision on the
COSS recommendations.
Proponents of the ban have
cited the oppression many gays
feel, the value of banning
employers as a bellwether for
further action and legal statutes
(albeit incorrect ones) to support
their position. By examining ar
guments against the ban, it
should become obvious the posi
tions COSS took on the two
propositions are the best solu
tions.
Richard Thomas, public rela
tions spokesman for the Gay
People's Union, argues "that the
University community has an
obligation to all its members to
do all it can to insure that none
are the victims of arbitrary dis
crimination or unfair treat
ment."
Two problems
There are two problems with
this argument.
First, what is the morality of
the University community to
which Thomas refers? 1 doubt
whether Thomas really has con
crete data on how members of
the community feel on the issue.
Second, why does the fact that
a majority feels employers who
discriminate on the basis of sex
ual preference should be ban
ned, mandate imposing this
morality no others? Surely.
Thomas doesn't believe there is
one "right" morality, which he
and his supporters are going to
impart upon us benighted stu
dents.
I agree with Thomas that dis
crimination on the basis of sex
ual preference is wrong. But one

should not be so vain to impose
these views on others.
Fairer solution
A far fairer solution is to allow
these employers to recruit, but to
require them to state their
policies concerning hiring

homosexuals as COSS recom
mended, so that prospective
employes can make their own
choices. Employers should be
required io divulge their
employment practices because
students may have difficulty
finding out such information on
their own.
Some contend that such a plan
would not work because many
companies would not be willing
to honestly state their policies.
However, this same objection

would pertain to deciding which
firms would be banned.
Former Dean of the Law
School, Thomas Ehrlich, also
advanced a similar argument:
"University placement facilities
should be available as a service
to any students who wish to see
any employer. The only excep
tions that seem valid to me are
those based upon either sound
academic judgments or legal re
quirements."
Ehrlich is correct in asserting
that the University must respect
legal requirements. For al
though, in general, 1 am opposed
to banning employers who dis
criminate on the basis of any
thing, one must comply with the
legal stringencies which have
been instituted.
Not included
However, Thomas argues, re
garding these legal require
ments, that discrimination on
the basis of religion and sex are
not included in the law pertain
ing to the CPPC and con
sequently, precedent is estab
lished to go beyond the law and
ban employers for other forms of

discrimination.
Yet as Legal Advisor to the
President James Siena pointed
out in a Jan. 22 memorandum,
Thomas' argument fails because
Thomas and others have cited
the wrong legislation. Siena says
the laws pertaining to the CPPC
are under Title VII, not Title VI,
as Thomas claims.
Future legislation
If in the future, legislation is
passed making it unlawful to
discriminate against gays, the
University clearly will have to
change its policies. But for the
present, there is no reason to do
so.
Each individual should be free
to choose for himself whether a
prospective employer's policy
against hiring gay people is im
portant to him. That's why
employers should be forced to
state their policies regarding
gays, so that one has the informa
tion to make this choice.
