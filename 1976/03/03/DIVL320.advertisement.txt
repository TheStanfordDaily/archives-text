Educational Research Seed Grants for Young faculty
The Spencer Foundation has provided Stanford University
with funds to support research of young scholars working on
problems related to education. The grant is premised on the
assumptions that small start-up funds for research by young
faculty are hard to come by, that better decisions can be made
locally on where the best returns for such investments are likely,
and that encouraging young scholars across many disciplines to
address educational problems is a good way to increase knowledge
about learning processes and other matters of importance to policy
and practice in education.
Grants for 1976-77 can be made in amounts up to approximately
$5,000 for approximately a one-year period. Salary support for
the principal investigator should not be requested, although
stipends for a necessary graduate student research assistant may
be included. Preference will be given to investigators who are
assistant or associate professors and to competent proposals that
bring the social, behavioral or natural sciences to bear on
educational problems and that have a high likelihood of developing
into more extensive programs funded by other sources.
Those interested in applying for 1976-77 support should
file proposals before April 1, 1976 to Arthur Coladarci, Dean of
the School of Education. The proposal may be brief, but should
indicate the problem to be addressed, its significance, general
methodology, and proposed budget. Tt should be accompanied by a
one-page vi_ta, indicating the investigator's training and relevant
publications. Four (4) copies are required.
Dean Coladarci will be happy to answer any questions (7-2111).
