A taste of Carlo Rossi Chablis
is like kissing someone you love
Salute:
I am Carlo Rossi. Yes, I am a real person.
There is something special about Carlo Rossi California
Chablis you should know. The grapes used are like
people you care a lot about. They can cause you a lot
of trouble -- believe me, there are many varieties that I
are much easier to grow than those in the Carlo Rossi * -
wines -- but then comes that moment when it's all
worth it.
For me, that time is tasting the wine. The
Chablis is so clean and pure, right away you get the
aroma of those grapes in the glass, a promise of what
is to come. Then when you taste it . . . it's like
a kiss from someone you love.
Carlo Rossi Chablis is made for you to enjoy as
much as I do. Try it, and let me know -- if you're
willing to kiss and tell.
Ciao,
Carlo Rossi Vineyards. Modesto, Stanislaus County, California
