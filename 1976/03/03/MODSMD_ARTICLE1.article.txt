# University receives labor complaint
## 
### Bill Sing 
The National Labor Relations
Board's (NLRB) general counsel has
authorized the issuance of a complaint
against the University and Stanford
Hospital, alleging that Hospital offi
cials unlawfully assisted two minority
employe groups engaging in attempts
to increase minority hiring and
employe relations programs, accord
ing to NLRB attorney Moe Orenstein.
The allegation charges that the hos
pital acted unlawfully by providing
access to meeting rooms, time off to
attend meetings, materials and
supplies and occasional advice from
administrators.
The counsel alleges that the two
minority employe groups, the
Alianza Latina and the Black Advisory
Council, were in fact "labor organiza
tions," which cannot be supported by
employers under the National Labor
Relations Act.
The complaint is the result of
charges filed lat>t April by the United
Stanford Employees (USE) during a
labor election campaign at the hospi
tal.
Campaign agents
USE attorney Marty Eichner said the
union maintains that the hospital ad
ministration organized and controlled
the two groups and used them as
agents to campaign against union rep
resentation by USE.
In the election, hospital employes
overwhelmingly rejected USE rep
resentation'
Eichner said that he has "over
whelming evidence" proving that ad
ministrators set up meetings with the
two groups to actively assist them in
campaigning against the USE. He also
claims that the University itself cam
paigned against USE. using the two
groups as "alternatives" to union rep
resentation.
"We have documents that prove
hospital officials actually created

these organizations," Eichner added.
University counsel for Employe Re
lations Douglas Barton, representing
the University, said that both the
Alianza and the Black Advisory Coun
cil were organized to help hospital of
ficials in dealing only with minority
hiring goals and improving relations
with minority employes.
He contends neither group was con
sidered a "labor organization" in their
dealings with the hospital.
Widespread practice
"Neither group has thought of them
selves as labor organizations," said
Barton. "The practice of dealing with
such groups to improve affirmative ac
tion efforts is quite widespread among
responsible employers. Government
agencies encourage it.and it is the de
sirable thing to do."
Medical Center counsel John
Schwartz said that the Alianza and the
Black Advisory Council acted "on
their own" in the labor election. "They
did in fact urge their own constituen
cies to vote against USE representa
tion, but without hospital interven
tion," he said.
Schwartz affirmed that the hospital
provided assistance to the two groups,
but only in the process of "obtaining
advice about minority employe rela
tions and affirmative action goals."
Eichner said that USE supports ef
forts to improve affirmative action "if
they are indeed genuine." He said the
Black Advisory Council was involved
in employe grievance procedures,
"which traditionally is a role of labor
unions."
"Hospital officials told employes
they didn't need a union because of
those two groups," said Eichner. He
said NLRB has taken 10 months to au
thorize the issuance of the complaint
because thecase is such a "hot potato."
"Stanford has no choice but to settle
or go to trial," Eichner said. "We have
them cold."

but only in the process of "obtaining
advice about minority employe rela
tions and affirmative action goals."
Eichner said that USE supports ef
forts to improve affirmative action "if
they are indeed genuine." He said the
Black Advisory Council was involved
in employe grievance procedures,
"which traditionally is a role of labor
unions."
"Hospital officials told employes
they didn't need a union because of
those two groups," said Eichner. He
said NLRB has taken 10 months to au
thorize the issuance of the complaint
because thecase is such a "hot potato."
"Stanford has no choice but to settle
or go to trial," Eichner said. "We have
them cold."

The National Labor Relations
Board's (NLRB) general counsel has
authorized the issuance of a complaint
against the University and Stanford
Hospital, alleging that Hospital offi
cials unlawfully assisted two minority
employe groups engaging in attempts
to increase minority hiring and
employe relations programs, accord
ing to NLRB attorney Moe Orenstein.
The allegation charges that the hos
pital acted unlawfully by providing
access to meeting rooms, time off to
attend meetings, materials and
supplies and occasional advice from
administrators.
The counsel alleges that the two
minority employe groups, the
Alianza Latina and the Black Advisory
Council, were in fact "labor organiza
tions," which cannot be supported by
employers under the National Labor
Relations Act.
The complaint is the result of
charges filed lat>t April by the United
Stanford Employees (USE) during a
labor election campaign at the hospi
tal.
Campaign agents
USE attorney Marty Eichner said the
union maintains that the hospital ad
ministration organized and controlled
the two groups and used them as
agents to campaign against union rep
resentation by USE.
In the election, hospital employes
overwhelmingly rejected USE rep
resentation'
Eichner said that he has "over
whelming evidence" proving that ad
ministrators set up meetings with the
two groups to actively assist them in
campaigning against the USE. He also
claims that the University itself cam
paigned against USE. using the two
groups as "alternatives" to union rep
resentation.
"We have documents that prove
hospital officials actually created

these organizations," Eichner added.
University counsel for Employe Re
lations Douglas Barton, representing
the University, said that both the
Alianza and the Black Advisory Coun
cil were organized to help hospital of
ficials in dealing only with minority
hiring goals and improving relations
with minority employes.
He contends neither group was con
sidered a "labor organization" in their
dealings with the hospital.
Widespread practice
"Neither group has thought of them
selves as labor organizations," said
Barton. "The practice of dealing with
such groups to improve affirmative ac
tion efforts is quite widespread among
responsible employers. Government
agencies encourage it.and it is the de
sirable thing to do."
Medical Center counsel John
Schwartz said that the Alianza and the
Black Advisory Council acted "on
their own" in the labor election. "They
did in fact urge their own constituen
cies to vote against USE representa
tion, but without hospital interven
tion," he said.
Schwartz affirmed that the hospital
provided assistance to the two groups,
but only in the process of "obtaining
advice about minority employe rela
tions and affirmative action goals."
Eichner said that USE supports ef
forts to improve affirmative action "if
they are indeed genuine." He said the
