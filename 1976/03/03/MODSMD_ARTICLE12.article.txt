# Society makes life uncontrollable
## 
### 
In a time of unprcedented well being,
Americans are Jess confident of their in
stitutions than ever before. The reason for
this loss of confidence is that Americans are
losing control over their political and per
sonal destinies.
Of course, it is true that America is be
coming more democratic. The existence of
30-odd primaries in this year's presiden
tial race is proof enough of this.
But at the same time, politics is becoming
more centralized. No longer can a voter go
to a local caucus to choose delegates to the
national convention; he must cast his vote
along with the votes of millions of others in
a statewide primary.
Consequently, his vote becomes less sig
nificant, and he stays away from the polls,
believing that his vote "doesn't matter." As
the political process becomes farther re
moved from the local level, the coalitions
needed to procure change necessarily be
come larger, and the individual becomes
lost in the masses.
Use education
In addition to controlling his future
through voting, many argue that the Ameri
can can use his education to decide his fu
ture. Because the average American is well
educated, he is supposedly better able to
manage his life.
But this education is often specialized,
and the individual is forced to trust the wis

dom of others in many aspects of his every
day life. This lack of expertise means that
the individual loses his free will and, con
sequently. his control over many parts of his
life.
In each of these cases, the individual is

encouraged to allow others tp tell him what
he will do. He loses personal control over
the most important part of his life, his job.
In addition to having to receive his in
come from others, the typical American
must surrender it to others in increasing
amounts. He pays almost confiscatory taxes
to a growing army of government bureauc
rats, and another army of "liberal refor
mers" wants to level everyone to a state of
proletarian equality in the name of "social
justice."
Of course, a person can go into business
for himself and thereby break free of some of

these chains. But he must compete against a
cadre of semi-socialistic corporations
which can rally virtually unlimited re
sources in the form of specialized expertise
and market control to drive the little man
out of business.
Destroy autonomy
This effort to destroy the autonomy of the
individual is a manifestation of the collec
tivist dream of a planned society. Everyone
must take his predetermined place and
work together in a coordinated way.
In addition, society must have a common
purpose. If society is to change direction,
everyone must agree, and resisters must be
regulated into compliance.
Thus, an American feels unable to affect
change in a society which has grown large
and impersonal. He has surrendered control
over his life to a society which has taken on
a collectivist character and dynamic of its
own.
Americans live in a society which
preaches the American dream of individu
ality and independence, but practices the
collectivist dream of compliance and de
pendency. To restore confidence in the na
tion's institutions, these institutions must
give the average American a real voice in
shaping his future.
