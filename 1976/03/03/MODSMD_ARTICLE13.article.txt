# 'Brainwashing' is no defense for Hearst
## 
### 
Bob Rowen

The question of Patty Hearst's
responsibility for her crime is
not as banal as it seems.
The defense is presently argu
ing she was forced into joining
the Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA), and that she was
brainwashed into committing
her crime. With this the trial
gains considerable importance
as it embraces an issue much de
bated and vet never resolved: Is a
defendant liable for any act
committed while in an other
than-normal mental state?
Assuming Patty Hearst is not
politically sympathetic with the
SLA and would normally not
gunsling for its robberies, why
did she do precisely that?
Allegations
What about allegations that
Hearst was brainwashed? Let us
assume we are dealing with two
characters, Patty and Tania, re
siding in the same body but at
different times. Both characters
have a sense of right and wrong.
Tania's is what is oftened
termed a "radical" sense; the
Hibernia robbery is justified
under the circumstances. How
ever, this is not the law's right
and wrong, nor is it the same as
Patty's sense of right and wrong.
Therefore, the argument goes,
when Patty became Tania, Patty
was temporarily insane, and not
responsible for Tania's crimes.

It does not matter by what pro
cess Patty was transformed into
revolutinary Tania. In the past,
temporary insanity (and con
sequent absolution of liability)
has been argued in the case of
persons acting under the influ
ence of alcohol or drugs, such as
LSD.
Mind altered
The user, or victim, is never
fully aware of how the drug al
ters his mind; he cannot perceive
its actions through normal
senses but only through inferral
of how he generally "feels."
Turning to brainwashing, the
issue becomes increasingly
complex. Patty's transformation
to Tania could not have occurred
without the intervention of the
SLA.
The "brainwashing" had gone
through her senses — not been
injected into her veins. Tania
needed no drugs or other "invis
ible" agents to sustain her trans
formation.
A factor deeming considera
tion is the strength of the vic
tim's psyche, her self-as
independent-of-other.
By my definition, a person
with a stronger, more indepen
dent psyche would have resisted
Patty's brainwashing — a person
with a weaker psyche would
have sooner changed to Tania.
Now. should Hearst, or anvone.

'be responsible for the strength of
her psyche? I think not.
Innocence
Suppose we have two inno
cent, moral, law-abiding wo
men. One, Mary, has a strong
ego. Mark, the villain is attempt
ing to brainwash each to kill
another man.
To do so, he must beat, torture
and humilate Mary for a year, but
he need only argue with and ter
rify Jane for a week.
After each woman's treatment
she believes murdering the man
is both right and beautiful. Each
girl believes she is perfectly sane
in thinking this, and is aware of
the change she has undergone.
Each is simply on a new mental
plane.
Now, to what degree is each
responsible for her murder? Is
Jane any more guilty than Mary,
who suffered indescribable pain
before Mark could transform her
mental state?
What if Jane could be brain
washed in only a day, is she then
any jnore responsible? I do not
believe we can morally say she
is. The women are both respon
sible to the same degree.
Gross inequalities
We must accept inequalities of
character — even gross in
equalities — that some people
are inherently stubborn and
strong while others are kind and

weak.
So is Patty responsible for
Tania? It does not matter how
severe were the measures the
SLA employed to brainwash Pat
ty's mind. Either everyone who
has been brainwashed is respon
sible, or everyone is excused. If
we excuse Patty for Tania's acts,
we must also excuse the murder
ing, weak-ego Jane.
And once this excusing be
gins, where will it end? Haven't
we all been brainwashed by our
parents, by our schools, by ev
erything in our lives?
We are then fast approaching
the extreme behaviorist school
of psychology. Here no one is re
sponsible for his life, as
everyone's life is only the inevit
able product of his environment.
Men are no more than exceed
ingly complex and interesting
machines. Crimes do not exist.
Free will does not exist. Every
thing is merely the mechanical
outcome of the past.
Therefore I believe the excus
ing must never begin, for once
begun there are no limits to its
scope. Jane must be held respon
sible for her murder, and unless
the defense can prove she was
coerced Hearst must be held re
sponsible for her crime.

A factor deeming considera

tim's psyche, her self-as

with a weaker psyche would

her psyche? I think not.
Innocence
Suppose we have two inno
cent, moral, law-abiding wo
men. One, Mary, has a strong
ego. Mark, the villain is attempt
ing to brainwash each to kill
another man.
To do so, he must beat, torture
and humilate Mary for a year, but
he need only argue with and ter
rify Jane for a week.
After each woman's treatment
she believes murdering the man
is both right and beautiful. Each
girl believes she is perfectly sane
in thinking this, and is aware of
the change she has undergone.
Each is simply on a new mental
plane.
Now, to what degree is each
responsible for her murder? Is
Jane any more guilty than Mary,
who suffered indescribable pain
before Mark could transform her
mental state?
What if Jane could be brain
washed in only a day, is she then
any jnore responsible? I do not
believe we can morally say she
is. The women are both respon
sible to the same degree.
Gross inequalities
We must accept inequalities of
character — even gross in
equalities — that some people
are inherently stubborn and
strong while others are kind and

weak.
So is Patty responsible for
Tania? It does not matter how
severe were the measures the
SLA employed to brainwash Pat
ty's mind. Either everyone who
has been brainwashed is respon
sible, or everyone is excused. If
we excuse Patty for Tania's acts,
we must also excuse the murder
ing, weak-ego Jane.
And once this excusing be
gins, where will it end? Haven't
we all been brainwashed by our
parents, by our schools, by ev
erything in our lives?
We are then fast approaching
the extreme behaviorist school
of psychology. Here no one is re
sponsible for his life, as
everyone's life is only the inevit
able product of his environment.
Men are no more than exceed
ingly complex and interesting
machines. Crimes do not exist.
Free will does not exist. Every
thing is merely the mechanical
outcome of the past.
Therefore I believe the excus
ing must never begin, for once
begun there are no limits to its
scope. Jane must be held respon
sible for her murder, and unless
the defense can prove she was
coerced Hearst must be held re
sponsible for her crime.

The question of Patty Hearst's
responsibility for her crime is
not as banal as it seems.
The defense is presently argu
ing she was forced into joining
the Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA), and that she was
brainwashed into committing
her crime. With this the trial
gains considerable importance
as it embraces an issue much de
bated and vet never resolved: Is a
defendant liable for any act
committed while in an other
than-normal mental state?
Assuming Patty Hearst is not
politically sympathetic with the
SLA and would normally not
gunsling for its robberies, why
did she do precisely that?
Allegations
What about allegations that
Hearst was brainwashed? Let us
assume we are dealing with two
characters, Patty and Tania, re
siding in the same body but at
different times. Both characters
have a sense of right and wrong.
Tania's is what is oftened
termed a "radical" sense; the
Hibernia robbery is justified
under the circumstances. How
ever, this is not the law's right
and wrong, nor is it the same as
Patty's sense of right and wrong.
Therefore, the argument goes,
when Patty became Tania, Patty
was temporarily insane, and not
responsible for Tania's crimes.

It does not matter by what pro
cess Patty was transformed into
revolutinary Tania. In the past,
temporary insanity (and con
sequent absolution of liability)
has been argued in the case of
persons acting under the influ
ence of alcohol or drugs, such as
LSD.
Mind altered
The user, or victim, is never
fully aware of how the drug al
ters his mind; he cannot perceive
its actions through normal
senses but only through inferral
of how he generally "feels."
Turning to brainwashing, the
issue becomes increasingly
complex. Patty's transformation
to Tania could not have occurred
without the intervention of the
SLA.
The "brainwashing" had gone
through her senses — not been
injected into her veins. Tania
needed no drugs or other "invis

The question of Patty Hearst's
responsibility for her crime is
not as banal as it seems.
The defense is presently argu
ing she was forced into joining
the Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA), and that she was
brainwashed into committing
her crime. With this the trial
gains considerable importance
as it embraces an issue much de
bated and vet never resolved: Is a
defendant liable for any act
committed while in an other
than-normal mental state?
Assuming Patty Hearst is not
politically sympathetic with the
SLA and would normally not
gunsling for its robberies, why
did she do precisely that?
Allegations
What about allegations that
Hearst was brainwashed? Let us
assume we are dealing with two
characters, Patty and Tania, re
siding in the same body but at
different times. Both characters
have a sense of right and wrong.
Tania's is what is oftened
termed a "radical" sense; the
Hibernia robbery is justified
under the circumstances. How
ever, this is not the law's right
and wrong, nor is it the same as
Patty's sense of right and wrong.
Therefore, the argument goes,
when Patty became Tania, Patty
was temporarily insane, and not
responsible for Tania's crimes.

It does not matter by what pro
cess Patty was transformed into
revolutinary Tania. In the past,
temporary insanity (and con
sequent absolution of liability)
has been argued in the case of
persons acting under the influ
ence of alcohol or drugs, such as
LSD.
Mind altered
The user, or victim, is never
fully aware of how the drug al
ters his mind; he cannot perceive
its actions through normal
senses but only through inferral
of how he generally "feels."
Turning to brainwashing, the
issue becomes increasingly
complex. Patty's transformation
to Tania could not have occurred
without the intervention of the
SLA.
The "brainwashing" had gone
through her senses — not been
injected into her veins. Tania
needed no drugs or other "invis
ible" agents to sustain her trans
formation.
A factor deeming considera
tion is the strength of the vic
tim's psyche, her self-as
independent-of-other.
By my definition, a person
with a stronger, more indepen
dent psyche would have resisted
Patty's brainwashing — a person
with a weaker psyche would
have sooner changed to Tania.
Now. should Hearst, or anvone.

'be responsible for the strength of
her psyche? I think not.
Innocence
Suppose we have two inno
cent, moral, law-abiding wo
men. One, Mary, has a strong
ego. Mark, the villain is attempt
ing to brainwash each to kill
another man.
To do so, he must beat, torture
and humilate Mary for a year, but
he need only argue with and ter
rify Jane for a week.
After each woman's treatment
she believes murdering the man
is both right and beautiful. Each
girl believes she is perfectly sane
in thinking this, and is aware of
the change she has undergone.
Each is simply on a new mental
plane.
Now, to what degree is each
responsible for her murder? Is
Jane any more guilty than Mary,
who suffered indescribable pain
before Mark could transform her
mental state?
What if Jane could be brain
washed in only a day, is she then
any jnore responsible? I do not
believe we can morally say she
is. The women are both respon
sible to the same degree.
Gross inequalities
We must accept inequalities of
character — even gross in
equalities — that some people
are inherently stubborn and
strong while others are kind and

weak.
So is Patty responsible for
Tania? It does not matter how
severe were the measures the
SLA employed to brainwash Pat
ty's mind. Either everyone who
has been brainwashed is respon
sible, or everyone is excused. If
we excuse Patty for Tania's acts,
we must also excuse the murder
ing, weak-ego Jane.
And once this excusing be
gins, where will it end? Haven't
we all been brainwashed by our
parents, by our schools, by ev
erything in our lives?
We are then fast approaching
the extreme behaviorist school
of psychology. Here no one is re
sponsible for his life, as
everyone's life is only the inevit
able product of his environment.
Men are no more than exceed
ingly complex and interesting
