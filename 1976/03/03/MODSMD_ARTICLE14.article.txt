# Rent hikes aimed at tenants
## 
### 
Jerry Kuner

As one of the parties con
cerned, I would like to clarify
some of the points made in the
Feb. 26 Daily article concerning
the Hamilton Avenue tenants
who are resisting rent increases
imposed by Wells Fargo Hank,
the owner of the apartment com
plex.
The "entire episode" did not
in fact begin with a "simple rent
increase" as Mr. Lopas (not
Lopez) stated in your article, but
with an attempt in August 1975
to evict the tenants on the
grounds that the city had or
dered that the houses be brought
up to building code, and that
such improvements would be
"economically prohibitive" to
the bank which intended to de
molish the houses and build a
regional office on the site.
Those "economically prohibi
tive" improvements ordered by
the city turned out to be re
placement of a hall light bulb,
and repair of a bent heater flue
and a rusted drain pipe on a
laundry tub. When we tenants
learned of this, we resisted, and
the order was rescinded.
Exactly 64 days later (within
60 days such action could leg
ally be considered retaliatory)
we received notice that rents
would be increased starting in
February 1976. Despite the im
plication in the article that the
reasons for the rental increase
were economic, the bank refuses
to rent out any apartments as
they become vacant, even at the
new higher rents.
'Modest' increase
The "modest" rent increases
total to more than $5000 a year in
14 units. Many of the increases
were only $5 or $10 a month.
Others, however, were $40 to
$50 a month, and one increase
was $190 a month, more than
doubling the previous rent!
One elderly couple whose rent
was increased from $82.50 to
$135 a month has already been
forced to move out. judging from
our previous experiences, it ap
pears the bank has no intention
of making any substantial im
provements on the apartments.
Our attempts to negotiate the
rent increases were met with
adamant refusal by the agent for
the bank, William Brophy (of
Ames, Brophy and Cranston
Real Estate) and by the bank it
self.
Complete refusal
Since our attempts at negotia
tion have been met with com
plete refusal, we have been
forced to take our case to the
public. *
The reluctance of the Palo
Alto Times to cover a story con
cerning a prominent local bank,
even though it has devoted con
siderable space to the rental
housing issue in Los Altos,
makes us feel that the terms "vic
ious and underhanded" might
more appropriately be applied to
parties other than the tenants,
who would like to negotiate
openly and directly with the
bank.
Perhaps if enough people
write letters of protest and with
draw their funds from Wells
Fargo, the bank will realize, in
terms it can understand, that it
cannot play so arbitrarily with
people's lives,and we can bring
this matter to a mutually satifac
tory conclusion.
The larger issue of the con
tinuing demolition of low in
come housing in response to
business interests is one that
should concern both local citi
zens and students who hope to
preserve the residential charac
ter of Palo Alto.

in fact begin with a "simple rent
increase" as Mr. Lopas (not
Lopez) stated in your article, but
with an attempt in August 1975
to evict the tenants on the
grounds that the city had or
dered that the houses be brought
up to building code, and that
such improvements would be
"economically prohibitive" to
the bank which intended to de
molish the houses and build a
regional office on the site.
Those "economically prohibi
tive" improvements ordered by
the city turned out to be re
placement of a hall light bulb,
and repair of a bent heater flue
and a rusted drain pipe on a
laundry tub. When we tenants
learned of this, we resisted, and
the order was rescinded.
Exactly 64 days later (within
60 days such action could leg
ally be considered retaliatory)
we received notice that rents
would be increased starting in
February 1976. Despite the im
plication in the article that the
reasons for the rental increase
were economic, the bank refuses
to rent out any apartments as
they become vacant, even at the
new higher rents.
'Modest' increase
The "modest" rent increases
total to more than $5000 a year in
14 units. Many of the increases
were only $5 or $10 a month.
Others, however, were $40 to
$50 a month, and one increase
was $190 a month, more than
doubling the previous rent!
One elderly couple whose rent
was increased from $82.50 to
$135 a month has already been
forced to move out. judging from
our previous experiences, it ap
pears the bank has no intention
of making any substantial im
provements on the apartments.
Our attempts to negotiate the
rent increases were met with
adamant refusal by the agent for
the bank, William Brophy (of
Ames, Brophy and Cranston
Real Estate) and by the bank it
self.
Complete refusal
Since our attempts at negotia
tion have been met with com
plete refusal, we have been
forced to take our case to the
public. *
The reluctance of the Palo
Alto Times to cover a story con
cerning a prominent local bank,
even though it has devoted con
siderable space to the rental
housing issue in Los Altos,
makes us feel that the terms "vic
ious and underhanded" might
more appropriately be applied to
parties other than the tenants,
who would like to negotiate
openly and directly with the
bank.
Perhaps if enough people
write letters of protest and with
draw their funds from Wells
Fargo, the bank will realize, in
terms it can understand, that it
cannot play so arbitrarily with
people's lives,and we can bring
this matter to a mutually satifac
tory conclusion.
The larger issue of the con
tinuing demolition of low in
come housing in response to
business interests is one that
should concern both local citi
zens and students who hope to
preserve the residential charac
ter of Palo Alto.

As one of the parties con

some of the points made in the
Feb. 26 Daily article concerning
the Hamilton Avenue tenants
who are resisting rent increases
imposed by Wells Fargo Hank,
the owner of the apartment com
