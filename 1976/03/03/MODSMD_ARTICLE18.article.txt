Radiologists here foresee
wide-scale abdominal screening
of patients by means of high
speed "sound pictures."
Jason Birnholz, assistant pro
fessor of radiology, is working
closely with Stanford's birth de
fects clinic and tin; Department
of Obstetrics and Gynecology to
monitor fetal growth by means of
ultrasound. In recent examina
tions, Birnholz has recorded the
facial profile of a five-month-old
fetus and the pulsing profile of
;in eight-week-old heart.
Since the early 19605, obstet
ric uses of ultrasound have in
cluded early identification of
multiple pregnancies, fetal ab
normalities such as hyd
rocephalus brain damage caused
by fluid buildup, the estimation
of fetal maturity and visualiza
tion of the placenta. The prenatal
detection of fetal abnormalities
with ultrasound is particularly
valuable to families with a high
risk for genetic diseases or con
gen i tal ma 1 formations.
Routine uses
In a more routine application,
ultrasound equipment is being
used to examine women with in
trauterine devices, an exam that
can be done in a minute or two,
according to Birnholz. Ul
trasound can also be used as a
yearly gynecologic examination,
because it locates various tumors
more reliably than with tradi
tional physical exams.
"One of the benefits oft he new
equipment is that a thorough
study can be concluded quickly,
so that large numbers of patients
can be seen without delay," says
Birnholz. The high-speed
phased array system provides
detailed pictures which can be
recorded on videotape for future
reference.
William Beaver of the Applied

Electronics Laboratory de
scribes the "real time" ul
trasound machine being de
veloped there. The equipment
involves electronic movement of
a beam of high frequency sound
that is far beyond the range of
human perception. At these fre
quencies, sound acts much like
light waves. The beams bounce
off tissue interfaces, and echoes
are reflected back from inside
the body.
Echoes recorded
The diagnosis is obtained by
recording echoes from the inter
faces between tissues having dif
fering acoustic properties. A
cross-sectional image is built up
from individual picture
"frames," each 1/30 of a sec
ond in duration. By deter
mining the amount of time it
takes for a beam to be reflected,
doctors can also derive the exact
location of the particular tissue.
A similar scanner developed
by Varian Associates Electrical
Company is presently in use at
the Stanford Medical Center.
The history of ultrasound in
medical diagnosis dates back to
1942, when k. Dussik attempted
to demonstrate intracranial pro
cesses and locate brain tumors.
The method was of no clinical
value until the "echo-method"
was introduced during the
19505.
Early applications
In 1954 two Swedish physi
cians described a method for re
cording the movement pattern of
some of the heart's structures.
Moving echoes were either re
corded photographically, on
film which was fed in front of the
oscilloscope at constant speed,
or bv direct recording via an
electrocardiograph. The result
was called an "ultrasound car
diogram."

Lan Donald in Glasgow, Scot
land was the first to use ul
trasound as a method of investi
gation in obstetrics and
gynecology in 1958. HLs pioneer
work has resulted in a practical
method for the diagnosis of ab
dominal conditions.
The ultrasound method is
harmless to both the mother and
fetus, since it does not involve
exposure to ionizing radiation.
In a 1964 study, Bertil Sunden of
Sweden wrote that (the ul
trasound method's) "safety has
been demonstrated beyond
doubt."
The use of ultrasound is grow
ing throughout the United States
— most large medical centers
and hospitals are presently
using the diagnostic techniques.

SAY CHEESE—This profiled face of a fetus was "photographed"
about four months before birth using ultrasonic equipment. This
image was produced by a technique used by Jason Birnholz at the
Medical School.
