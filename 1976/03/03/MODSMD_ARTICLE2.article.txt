Microbiology Prof. Leonard Hay
flick of the Medical School resigned
last week after the University informed
him that it was not satisfied with the
way he had handled fees from culture
testing in University laboratories.
The University was concerned that
Hayflick had deposited approximately
$9500 in fees from mycoplasma testing
into personal bank accounts, accord
ing to John Schwartz, an assistant vice
president at the Medical Center.
The University was also concerned
that Hayflick allegedly used Stanford
laboratories to produce, store and sell
cell cultures in his own commercial
enterprises, Schwartz said.
Hayflick maintained that his handl
ing of the funds was the result of a
misunderstanding over University
policy. "It was done in all good con
science," he said. He resigned because
"the University impugned my mo
tives," he said.
He also said that his resignation was
purely voluntary.
Corroboration
Schwartz corroborated Hayflick on
this point. "His resignation was his
own idea." Schwartz said.
Asked about Dr. Hayflick's claim
that the University impugned his mo
tives, Schwartz replied, "Our position
as to motives is that the funds were
improperly deposited in his personal
account."
The University received the infor
mation last Spring leading to Hay
flick's resignation from an investiga
tion by the National Institutes of
Health (NIH). a government research
funding organization.
Schwartz said the NIH report stated
that Hayflick opened a private
savingsand loan account in November,
1972 and began depositing fees from
tests done in University laboratories
into it.
Personal deposits
The report then stated that on April
15, 1974, Hayflick closed that account
and deposited its funds into his per
sonal savings account.
The report said further that Hayflick

set up a corporation later that month,
listing himself and his wife as sole
shareholders, then deposited testing
tees into the corporation's account.
After receiving the NIH report.the
University conducted its own investi
gation and confronted Hayflick with
the results. "We had lots of meetings
with him," Schwartz said. "We were
very open with him. We told him of
our final conclusion five weeks ago."

Hayflick claimed he himself in
itiated the NIH investigation. "1 feel
that the information about the account
was in question." he time
had come when it should be cleared
up."
Money still available
Asked whether the money was still
available for recovery by the Univer
sity, Hayflick replied, "Oh. yes, it al
ways has been." The accounts in ques

tion still exist and all the money in
volved is still deposited in them, he
said.
Schwartz corroborated this account,
saying "He did in fact advise us that
we could get the money back." The
return of the money is being delayed
only because "we have not yet verified
the exact amount," he said. "We are
awaiting further documentation from
NIH."
