Please tell us the ansiver to the question the ivhoJe campus is
asking. IVhv ore the tivo shuttle buses named "Marguerite"?-
W.G.C.
That name is the result of careful historical research, according to
Assoc. Planner Stephen Schmidt. "Marguerite" was the name of a
large jitney which used to run from Stanford tu Palo Alto around
1910. For the un-transportatiunally minded, a jitney was an au
tomotive vehicle which, like a taxi cab, charged passengers accord
ing to distance rather than a flat fee.
Luckily, jitneys have now been outlawed in most areas to relieve
competition with local bus systems. Now the happy taxpayer can
subsidize your bus ride, and you are privileged to fork out the same
25 cents for a two-block or three-mile journey.
Having just received a new copy of "Regulations Governing Stu
dent Conduct," I am again puzzled by the discrepancy in regula
tions involving firearms (explosives, blackjacks, etc.). Why are just
students expressly forbidden to possess these on Stanford land?
Can Dick Lyman and David Packard tuck ..'JHs under their belts and
walk around campus? Is the shotgun in a janitor's or professor's car
okay? Can in fact any person who is not registered as a student (and
who isn't otherwise forbidden on Stanford land) bring such
weapons on campus?-D.E.
Lyman is technically allowed to pack a pistol, but he can't be
shooting rabbits with it. And he must have a ficense to carry the
gun. All clear?
Actually the legal questions here are somewhat cloudy, accord
ing to Police Chief Marvin 1 lerrington. Sometime in the 1800s the
University campus was declared a game preserve, which makes it
illegal to carry weapons for hunting purposes.However, unless the
police department can prove that the person was hunting (where
the rabbits come in), carrying a weapon is not illegal. In addition,
the gun-toter must comply with any outside legal regulations.
On the other hand, University policy forbids students to have
firearms on campus, whether or not they are legally qualified. (No
one is allowed to have firearms on the campuses of state-supported
colleges or universities.) The policy, established during the radical
era by the Student Conduct Legislative Council, was part of a
general movement to reduce violence on campus, and was pretty
much undisputed by the members of the council, according to Vice
President Robert Rosenzweig, a faculty member.
Herrington noted however, that a faculty-staff gun-toting fad
would probably result in a similar policy for Stanford faculty and
staff.
Correction: Even as the "Trumpet Voluntary" letters continue to
pour in, we are ashamed toadmit yet another error. Toaircon'dition
the new law school will cost $1000 per month, not per day. Ironi
cally, inflation has so benumbed people that not a single soul wrote
to question our previous figure. Only Robert McKnight, the origi
nal source, found anything strange about that price. J
