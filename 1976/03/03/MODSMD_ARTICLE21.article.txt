# Oglala Sioux tribe splits over election; terror reigns
## 
### 
FINE RIDGE. S.D. (FNS) —
Terror onceagain reigns over the
Oglala Sioux nation here just
one month before the newly
elected tribal president takes
charge.
In the week following the; de
feat Jan. 27 of incumbent
Richard Wilson by A 1 Trimble,
who was supported by the
American Indian Movement
(AIM), two members of AIM crit
ical of Wilson were murdered.
One was shot to death. The
other was found dead from a
brutal beating.
Since then, five other violent
deaths have occurred, all falling
into the gray area between mur
der and accident. The most in
tense violence so far erupted
within a 24-hour period at the
village of Wanblee (population

500), a Trimble stronghold.
The Saturday following the
election, 15 Wilson supporters
drove into Wanblee and opened
fire on the home of Guy Dull
Knife, a Trimble backer. Dull
Knife did not fire back. Fifteen
minutes later, reservation police
arrested Dull Knife for disor
derly conduct. Residents claim
police nade no attempt to ques
tion or disarm the instigators.
FBI impotent
Hours later, one witness to the
shooting was shotgunned to
death followi rig a high-speed car
chase. Four surviving occupants
of bis car identified the chase
vehicles to the FBI as those of the
intruders.
FBI agents said they lacked
"probable cause" to make ar
rests. Rapid City's agent-in

charge later explained "there
may not have been enough
agents to take action."
The federally supervised tri
bal elections, rather than resolv
ing the long disputed leadership
issue, have opened the door to a
new no-holds-barred struggle
for power. The result is near
anarchy. The key to power is not
holding office but control of the
reservation's inhabitants.
Dozens of residents claim that
Wilson's supporters — whom
they call "goon squads" — are
spreading fear by intimidation to
show that they are the only ones
who can run the reservation, not
the newly elected leadership.
Wilson retorts that the trouble
makers are AIM members.
At the heart of the power
struggle is the long-standing

patronage system under
the reservation head doles out
$24 million in federal grants and
900 jobs to a tribal population of
12,000 with 70 percent un
employment.
Until the elections. Wilson's
opponents charge, almost all
jobs and federal benefits went to
his relatives and supporters.
Cultural split
Fueling this tribal division has
been a cultural fault line that
sharply separates Wilson sup
porters from the rest of the popu
lation.
Like Wilson, they are largely
Americanized, often half white,
contemptuous of the old tribal
ways, materially better off and
geographically centered around
Fine Ridge village, the center of
the reservation. The bulk of the

population lives in outlying dis
tricts. earns less than $3000 per
year, clings to the old language
and religion, reveres the tribal
lands and shares a fierce pride in
their once-despised ancestry.
By law. newly elected Trimble
has the power to make drastic
changes in who gets federally
funded jobs and money. Wilson
supporters fear that an entirely
new corps of officials could take
over their jobs and put an end to
their long domination of tribal
government.
Interlock
But more is at stake than jobs
and grants. The Fine Ridge
struggle threatens a century-old
interlock between the Bureau of
Indian Affairs (BIA) and a reser
vation boss and patronage sys
tem. By treaty and tradition, re
servation native Americans
exercise self-rule. But at the
same time they are wards of the
federal government entitled to
economic assistance — "foreign
aid," since in theory many reser
vations are still supposed to
enjoy sovereign rights.
The bureaucratized BIA uses
the patronage privileges and
grants to shore up reservation
strongmen, like Wilson, who
would guarantee a no-trouble
situation.
On reservations throughout

the country, this interlock sys
tem — not just tribal chiefs like
Wilson — has been the real
target of attack by AIM and re
formers like Trimble (himself a
former BIA superintendent).
This reform movement sees tri
bal chiefs as little more than
tools of the BIA which, through
its control of money and reserva
tion police, holds final power
over the reservations.
This interlock, they claim, has
totally blocked any assault
against the real enemy of the na
tive American — poverty. Aver
age life expectancy on Fine Rige
is 42, according to statistics from
the Department of Health, Edu
cation and Welfare.
Wounded Knee
When AIM resorted to force in
the 1973 occupation of
Wounded Knee to dramatize
these conditions, the result was a
massive armed counterattack by
local BIA police, FBI and army
units resulting in bloodshed.
Now AIM and other Trimble
supporters fear any resort to
armed force even for self protec
tion would bring the same law
enforcement groups rushing
back in against them.
According to Trimble, "the
FBI has been obsessed with
tracking down AIM during the
current wave of violence, while
overlooking the needs of the
traditional Sioux for protection
against harassment by Wilson's
goon squads."
Trimble has advised his sup
porters not to retaliate with force
against the violence and ter
rorism. Trimble, along with Sen.
James Abourezkf D-S. Dak.), now
believe the only hope of guaran
teeing an effective transfer of
power in April (when Trimble is
scheduled to take office) is rapid
and decisive federal interven
tion — not by the BIA police or
the FBI, but by fellow native
Americans from the six Iroquois
nations in New York State.
So far, intervention by the
BIA, traditionally supportive of
Wilson, and the FBI, mainly in

terested in apprehending fugi
tive AIM members, has not
helped Trimble develop the
clout he will need when he faces
the task of tiring old office hol
ders and appointing new ones.
Federal intervention 4
In an emergency trip to
Washington Feb. 4 at Abourezk's
request. Trimble told officials of
the Interior Department (in
charge of the BIA) that
Washington now holds the key
to the outcome of the power
struggle. What he and Abourezk
say they want is a symbolicshow
of support from Washington for
the newly elected, yet-to-be
installed reform candidate. Hut
what they want eventually is a
whole shift in power relation
ships between Pine Ridge and
the federal government.
Interior Department officials
reportedly rejected Trimble's re
quests for help with words that
Abourezk's office described as
"bureaucratic hog wash."
Trimble, now back on the re
servation. is seen by many here
as a "marked man." Should any
thing happen to him, the man
who would succeed as tribal
chief would be the newly elected
tribal vice president Johnson
Holy Rock, a Wilson supporter.
Abourezk's son. meanwhile,
who has lived quietly on I'ine
Ridge for two years and was
compiling a report for his father
on the current situation, has
been ordered expelled by Wilson
as "an undesirable."
Observers now fear that if the
moderate center represented by
Trimble crumbles, then civil war
couljl erupt between the Wilson
supporters and desperate tradi
tional native Americans.
