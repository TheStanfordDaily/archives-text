Skiers fourth

The competitive season fi
nally began for the Stanford ski
team last weekend in the Pacific
Coast Championships held at
Squaw Valley. Poor snow condi
tions had forced postponement
of three earlier meets.
The team placed fourth be
hind winner Nevada-Reno,
which earned a trip to the Na
tionals in Maine. Sierra College
and California were second and
third, respectively.
Stanford's Don Dubain qual
ified for the NCAAs by taking a
third in the nordic jump. He also

added a tenth in the cross coun
try event. Dubain won't be going
to Maine, however, as the team
doesn't have the funds to send
him.
Dave Herbert turned in a good
overall performance. Herbert
was runner-up to Nevada's Rees
Palermo for the Skimeister
Award,emblematic of the meet's
best all-around skier.
The Stanford sophomore was
seventh in the giant slalom, 12th
in both the slalom and the nordic
jump, and 17th in the cross
country ski.
Herbert won the Skimeister

last year and according to coach
Skip Stritter "probably lost his
chance to repeat when he missed
a gate in the slalom and had to
walk, back up the hill to the
gate."
The Stanford women's team
finished sixth in a seven-team
field. Lori Gibson was a top ten
finisher in both the giant slalom
and the slalom.
Two field hockey playes, Dee
Gates and Alice Reed, took third
and fourth respectively in the
slalom. Their finishes gave Stan
ford a second place to Sierra in
that event.
Weather conditions hampered
the meet, with only one run of
the slalom being held instead of
the usual two. Stritter said "it
was rainy really windy and
cold."
Next competition for the skiers
is in two weeks at tht Northern
California Intercollegiate Invita
tional.

Women's golf
Stanford's women golfers, de
fending champions of the
Northern California Intercol

legiate Athletic Conference
(NCIAC), open their 1976 season
tomorrow in a conference meet
at San Jose's Almaden course.
San Jose State will host a
seven-team field including Stan
ford, Sacramento State, UC-
Davis, Pacific, USF and
Nevada-Reno.
Seniors Pat Cornett and Pam
Palmieri, both past champions of
the San Francisco City Open, are
the Cards' top golfers. Both were
named to the All-NCIAC team
last year and Cornett finished
third in the AIAW Collegiate Na
tionals.
"We have the best team in
Stanford history." says coach
Carroll Diaz. "We've had good
players at the top before, but
never have we enjoyed the depth
we will this spring."
Men's golf
Stanford's men golfers will
play California tomorrow,
weather permitting, at 12:30
p.m. on the Walnut Creek
Course. The Cards won the
Hayward Invitational last
weekend.
Skiers fourth

The competitive season fi
nally began for the Stanford ski
team last weekend in the Pacific
Coast Championships held at
Squaw Valley. Poor snow condi
tions had forced postponement
of three earlier meets.
The team placed fourth be
hind winner Nevada-Reno,
which earned a trip to the Na
tionals in Maine. Sierra College
and California were second and
third, respectively.
Stanford's Don Dubain qual
ified for the NCAAs by taking a
third in the nordic jump. He also

added a tenth in the cross coun
try event. Dubain won't be going
to Maine, however, as the team
doesn't have the funds to send
him.
Dave Herbert turned in a good
overall performance. Herbert
was runner-up to Nevada's Rees
Palermo for the Skimeister
Award,emblematic of the meet's
best all-around skier.
The Stanford sophomore was
seventh in the giant slalom, 12th
in both the slalom and the nordic
jump, and 17th in the cross
country ski.
Herbert won the Skimeister

last year and according to coach
Skip Stritter "probably lost his
chance to repeat when he missed
a gate in the slalom and had to
walk, back up the hill to the
gate."
The Stanford women's team
finished sixth in a seven-team
field. Lori Gibson was a top ten
finisher in both the giant slalom
and the slalom.
Two field hockey playes, Dee
Gates and Alice Reed, took third
and fourth respectively in the
slalom. Their finishes gave Stan
ford a second place to Sierra in
that event.
Weather conditions hampered
the meet, with only one run of
the slalom being held instead of
the usual two. Stritter said "it
was rainy really windy and
cold."
Next competition for the skiers
is in two weeks at tht Northern
California Intercollegiate Invita
tional.
