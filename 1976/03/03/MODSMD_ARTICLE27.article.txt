# USC to lose hold on another sport?
## 
### George Anders 
Those many baseball seasons
of seeing powerhouse USC edge
out Stanford in league play may
finally be over, according to
Card coach Ray Young.
Team standings in the newly
formed California Intercol
legiate Baseball Association
(CIBA) should be a "toss-up from
top to bottom," he predicted yes
terday.
The CIBA includes all the
teams from the old Pacific Eight
Southern Division (Stanford,
IJSC, UCLA and California) as
well as UC-Santa Barbara.
Young said, "USC's never
going to dominate a league again
the way they used to." He noted
"other teams are getting talented
players that USC used to get
without doing anything."
Scouting the teams in the
CIBA, Young said "most of them

are young, inexperienced ones,
except for UCLA, which has
most of last year's team back. But
it's only 5-5."
Kainout
The Cards were scheduled to
play a pre-league game yester
day afternoon here against UC-
Davis. but were rained out.
Reviewing his team's 9-6 re
cord so far. Young saw many
bright spots. "(Shortstop Steve)
Davis is our number one hitter,
with a.362average. I le also leads
the team in home runs, with
five," the coach said.
Davis had five home runs for
all of last season. Young re
marked "throughout the team,
we didn't expect much in the
way of power hitting. Yet we
have 15 home runs in 15 games."
Young added, however, that
"Davis has had some problems
with his fielding, which is usu
ally his strongest area."
Other top players include out
fielder Randy Wong, with a .3 53
average, and pitcher John Yan
dle with a 3-1 record. Overall,
Young said, the team has a .277
batting average, and a 2.59
earned run average.
One run losses
Five of the Cards' six losses
have been by one run, Young
noted. "We've made some costly
mistakes," he said, "but we're a
very young team, and you expect
some inconsistencies."
The seven freshmen pitchers
playing varsity "lend great
depth" to the squad. Young said.
"Right now, Bruce Fiala and
Rob Irwin are the top two," he
added. "They're continuing to
progress."
Yesterday's game might be
made up Sunday or Monday,
Young said, but he cautioned
that plans are not definite.
Young said he also expects to
day's game against Santa Clara,
there, to be rained out, leaving
his pitching rotation uncertain.
The Cards play a single game
against Gonzaga Friday, and a
doubleheader against Fresno
State Saturday, all at Sunken
Diamond. Young said Yandle
and Fiala "will probably start"
two of the games.
