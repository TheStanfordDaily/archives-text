# IM basketball: a game of intensity
## Soto, Broke B, Phi Delt B1, Jockobatsi in 'B' league semifinals 
### Marko Fong John Driscoll 
Balls squirt out of hands unpro
voked, layups bounce off the front of
the rim, jump shots hit other players
before they hit the net, passes hit the
top of the backboard and balls are
dribbled out of bounds.
What is it? No, it's not the IJSC bas
ketball team in action. It's the men's
"B" intramural basketball quarter fi
nals competition.
The forty players who stampede ac
ross the three side courts at Maples
Pavilion don't exactly have Dick Di-
Biaso drooling at the prospect of hav
ing found some closet David
Thompson, yet the games are exciting.
Watching the intramural playoffs, one
discovers that excitement in basketball
is less a function of the artistry exhi
bited than the intensity.
IM basketball is the biggest single
participation sport at Stanford, with
something like 1500 people playing.
Men's "B" basketball represents the
biggest of the big with about 200 teams
competing, HO of which make the
playoffs. Now only four remain:
twelfth-seeded Soto, the only seed left
in the tournament, Phi Delt 81, Joc
kobatsi and Broke B. The survivor of
the four gets a team picture which
hangs in the IM office, their names re
corded somewhere for posterity, a
trophy and 20 IM points.
More than a game
From the looks of it Monday night,
one would have thought the eight
teams were playing for med school ac
ceptances, even Crothers, Law School
team. The thirty or so spectators at
each game jumped up and down with
anxiety, whistled, hollered and
screamed at the refs. The twenty
players on the courts jumped up and
down, whistled, hollered and
screamedat the refs. The refs jumped
up and down . . . screaming at the
players. There probably hasn't been so
much dissonance at Maples since
Stephen Stills appeared there.
In one of the most dissonant games
ot the evening, Soto brought Derek
and the Dominos to their 41-38.
Soto came back from a 22-10 halftime
deficit by installing a double teaming
press which broke the Dominos'poise
in the last minutes of the game.
Actually, the game was the most in
teresting variation on basketball, as the
refs decided to invent a game with a
whole new set of rules combining the
most violent aspects of football, hoc
key and limited non-nuclear war
without telling any of the players. In
any case, Soto made the adjustment
taster. They also beat the Dominos at
the two essential basketball aspects
left in the game, rebounding and
shooting.
In this corner .. .
Freshmen Connie Woolridge and
Bill Maloney controlled the boards

and the shoving match. Maloney had
18 points in the game as he also helped
key the Soto press. Adlai Alexander hit
three long jumpers to close the gap for
the last time.
For the Dominos, Derek Daley did an
excellent imitation of Marques
Johnson with three acrobatic leaps to
the basket culminating in field goals
before being gang-tackled and hurting
his ankle. Chris Larkin and Lewis De
larosa managed to hit outside on occa
sion.
On the other court, ten huge men
rumbled from basket to basket, as Phi
Delt 131 upset second-seeded sixth
Ward, 34-32 in front of clusters of
people in double knit sweet suits and
down parkas.
In a Chekhov novella, Ward Six was
a Russian insane asylum. If you like to

live in the book setting, you probably
would have liked to see the basketball
team which had beaten one of its
playoff opponents 94-23.
The game was an explosion of col
liding bodies, loose ball scrambles,
court-length passes, air balls and
amazing athleticism. It looked as if the
two teams were trying to do their own
version of a Merrill Lynch commercial.
With footballers Ron Inge, Gerald Wil
son and Dave Strong playing for Sixth
Ward, and Jerry Waldvogel playing for
the Phi Delts, the character of the game
came as no surprise.
Came from behind
The real surprise came when the
dust cleared and the Phi Delts had
emerged victorious after being behind
16-12 at the half. Tim Wylder (eight
points), Chris kamel (six) and Tom

Mason (six) led the balanced Phi Delt
scoring. Waldvogel. et al. shut off the
Sixth Ward shooting by playing an
even more physical game than their
opponents.
The Crothers — Broke B game
matched two very similar teams. Both
featurd strong ball handling, good
quickness, occasional good outside
shooting and fast-breaking offenses.
Crothers definitely had the biggest
and noisiest cheering section of the
night. Broke probably had the loudest
bench.
The intensity of the goings-on Mon
day evening manifested itself most
clearly in this game. Broke's center
was cut earlier in the game and played
to the end with blood running down
from his eye. Broke's hirsute guards,
one in tennis shorts and sneakers with
no socks, harassed opponents as if they
were Popeye Doyle chasing dope deal
ers. Crother's Alan Epstein, who
scored 13 points, Michael Morris, with
eight and Joseph Mais were a frenzy of
squealing sneakers, gritting teeth and
waving, poking arms and hands.
Desperation tactics
Unfortunately for Crothers. the ex
cellent floor play of Broke guard Marty
Davis foiled Crothers' desperation
pressing tactics at the end of the game.
The final score: 42-35, Broke.
The jockobatsi — Arroyo game
was the closest of the evening and no
less intense. Even after Jockobatsi
won in overtime, 47-45, after regula
tion time had ended at 33-33, the ten
sion was not relieved. Arroyo alleged
that one of the Jockobatsi players had
played tor another team. A protest was
filed Tuesday afternoon.
Jockobatsi, which picked up its
fifth man by finding someone shooting
baskets on the next court five minutes
before the beginning of its first game,
made a succesful run at a six-point Ar
royo lead in the last five minutes of
regulation play.
Ex-JV players
Weston Press and Ken Baker, former
junior varsity players, led the way for
Jockobatsi. Press scored 18 points for
the night. Dave Gonzales, who missed
two open shots with five seconds left
in regulation, scored six in the over
time.
Kim Cater, with eight points, and
Dave Plager, with 14. led the Arroyo
scoring.
The semis, which match Joc
kobatsi, possibly Arroyo, against
Soto and Phi Delt Bl against Broke B
will be played tonight in Maples at
9:30 and 10:30.
At times, the games will be, aesthet
ically a forlorn parody of the way bas
ketball should look, despite a number
of excellent individual players. Still,
lrom a more cosmic perspective,
you're sure to see the kind o£ unre
lieved intensity which characterizes
basketball as it should be played.

and the Dominos to their 41-38.
Soto came back from a 22-10 halftime
deficit by installing a double teaming
press which broke the Dominos'poise
in the last minutes of the game.
Actually, the game was the most in
teresting variation on basketball, as the
refs decided to invent a game with a
whole new set of rules combining the
most violent aspects of football, hoc
key and limited non-nuclear war
without telling any of the players. In
any case, Soto made the adjustment
taster. They also beat the Dominos at
the two essential basketball aspects
left in the game, rebounding and
shooting.
In this corner .. .
Freshmen Connie Woolridge and
Bill Maloney controlled the boards

and the shoving match. Maloney had
18 points in the game as he also helped
key the Soto press. Adlai Alexander hit
three long jumpers to close the gap for
the last time.
For the Dominos, Derek Daley did an
excellent imitation of Marques
Johnson with three acrobatic leaps to
the basket culminating in field goals
before being gang-tackled and hurting
his ankle. Chris Larkin and Lewis De
larosa managed to hit outside on occa
sion.
On the other court, ten huge men
rumbled from basket to basket, as Phi
Delt 131 upset second-seeded sixth
Ward, 34-32 in front of clusters of
people in double knit sweet suits and
down parkas.
In a Chekhov novella, Ward Six was
a Russian insane asylum. If you like to

live in the book setting, you probably
would have liked to see the basketball
team which had beaten one of its
playoff opponents 94-23.
The game was an explosion of col
liding bodies, loose ball scrambles,
court-length passes, air balls and
amazing athleticism. It looked as if the
two teams were trying to do their own
version of a Merrill Lynch commercial.
With footballers Ron Inge, Gerald Wil
son and Dave Strong playing for Sixth
Ward, and Jerry Waldvogel playing for
the Phi Delts, the character of the game
came as no surprise.
Came from behind
The real surprise came when the
dust cleared and the Phi Delts had
emerged victorious after being behind
16-12 at the half. Tim Wylder (eight
points), Chris kamel (six) and Tom

Mason (six) led the balanced Phi Delt
scoring. Waldvogel. et al. shut off the
Sixth Ward shooting by playing an
even more physical game than their
opponents.
The Crothers — Broke B game
matched two very similar teams. Both
featurd strong ball handling, good
quickness, occasional good outside
shooting and fast-breaking offenses.
Crothers definitely had the biggest
and noisiest cheering section of the
night. Broke probably had the loudest
bench.
The intensity of the goings-on Mon
day evening manifested itself most
clearly in this game. Broke's center
was cut earlier in the game and played
to the end with blood running down
from his eye. Broke's hirsute guards,
one in tennis shorts and sneakers with
no socks, harassed opponents as if they
were Popeye Doyle chasing dope deal
ers. Crother's Alan Epstein, who
scored 13 points, Michael Morris, with
eight and Joseph Mais were a frenzy of
squealing sneakers, gritting teeth and
waving, poking arms and hands.
Desperation tactics
Unfortunately for Crothers. the ex
cellent floor play of Broke guard Marty
Davis foiled Crothers' desperation
pressing tactics at the end of the game.
The final score: 42-35, Broke.
The jockobatsi — Arroyo game
was the closest of the evening and no
less intense. Even after Jockobatsi
won in overtime, 47-45, after regula
tion time had ended at 33-33, the ten
sion was not relieved. Arroyo alleged
that one of the Jockobatsi players had
played tor another team. A protest was
filed Tuesday afternoon.
Jockobatsi, which picked up its
fifth man by finding someone shooting
baskets on the next court five minutes
before the beginning of its first game,
made a succesful run at a six-point Ar
royo lead in the last five minutes of
regulation play.
Ex-JV players
Weston Press and Ken Baker, former
junior varsity players, led the way for
Jockobatsi. Press scored 18 points for
the night. Dave Gonzales, who missed
two open shots with five seconds left
in regulation, scored six in the over
time.
Kim Cater, with eight points, and
Dave Plager, with 14. led the Arroyo
scoring.
The semis, which match Joc
kobatsi, possibly Arroyo, against
Soto and Phi Delt Bl against Broke B
will be played tonight in Maples at
9:30 and 10:30.
At times, the games will be, aesthet
ically a forlorn parody of the way bas
ketball should look, despite a number
of excellent individual players. Still,
lrom a more cosmic perspective,
you're sure to see the kind o£ unre
lieved intensity which characterizes
basketball as it should be played.

FAMILIAR FACES—Footballer Ron Inge of Sixth Ward shoots over Phi Delts'
Jerry Waldvogel, a quarterback on the football team, in an intramural li B" league
quarterfinal game Monday night. The Phi Delts defeated Sixth Ward to advance
to the semifinals tonight.
Balls squirt out of hands unpro
voked, layups bounce off the front of
the rim, jump shots hit other players
before they hit the net, passes hit the
top of the backboard and balls are
dribbled out of bounds.
What is it? No, it's not the IJSC bas
ketball team in action. It's the men's
"B" intramural basketball quarter fi
nals competition.
The forty players who stampede ac
ross the three side courts at Maples
Pavilion don't exactly have Dick Di-
Biaso drooling at the prospect of hav
ing found some closet David
Thompson, yet the games are exciting.
Watching the intramural playoffs, one
discovers that excitement in basketball
is less a function of the artistry exhi
bited than the intensity.
IM basketball is the biggest single
participation sport at Stanford, with
something like 1500 people playing.
Men's "B" basketball represents the
biggest of the big with about 200 teams
competing, HO of which make the
playoffs. Now only four remain:
twelfth-seeded Soto, the only seed left
in the tournament, Phi Delt 81, Joc
kobatsi and Broke B. The survivor of
the four gets a team picture which
hangs in the IM office, their names re
corded somewhere for posterity, a
trophy and 20 IM points.
More than a game
From the looks of it Monday night,
one would have thought the eight
teams were playing for med school ac
ceptances, even Crothers, Law School
team. The thirty or so spectators at
each game jumped up and down with
anxiety, whistled, hollered and
screamed at the refs. The twenty
players on the courts jumped up and
down, whistled, hollered and
screamedat the refs. The refs jumped
up and down . . . screaming at the
players. There probably hasn't been so
much dissonance at Maples since
Stephen Stills appeared there.

The real surprise came when the
dust cleared and the Phi Delts had
emerged victorious after being behind
16-12 at the half. Tim Wylder (eight
points), Chris kamel (six) and Tom

Mason (six) led the balanced Phi Delt
scoring. Waldvogel. et al. shut off the
Sixth Ward shooting by playing an
even more physical game than their
opponents.
The Crothers — Broke B game
matched two very similar teams. Both
featurd strong ball handling, good
quickness, occasional good outside
shooting and fast-breaking offenses.
Crothers definitely had the biggest
and noisiest cheering section of the
night. Broke probably had the loudest
bench.
The intensity of the goings-on Mon
day evening manifested itself most
clearly in this game. Broke's center
was cut earlier in the game and played
to the end with blood running down
from his eye. Broke's hirsute guards,
one in tennis shorts and sneakers with
no socks, harassed opponents as if they
were Popeye Doyle chasing dope deal
ers. Crother's Alan Epstein, who
scored 13 points, Michael Morris, with
eight and Joseph Mais were a frenzy of
squealing sneakers, gritting teeth and
waving, poking arms and hands.
Desperation tactics
Unfortunately for Crothers. the ex
cellent floor play of Broke guard Marty
Davis foiled Crothers' desperation
pressing tactics at the end of the game.
The final score: 42-35, Broke.
The jockobatsi — Arroyo game
was the closest of the evening and no
less intense. Even after Jockobatsi
won in overtime, 47-45, after regula
tion time had ended at 33-33, the ten
sion was not relieved. Arroyo alleged
that one of the Jockobatsi players had
played tor another team. A protest was
filed Tuesday afternoon.
Jockobatsi, which picked up its
fifth man by finding someone shooting
baskets on the next court five minutes
before the beginning of its first game,
made a succesful run at a six-point Ar
royo lead in the last five minutes of
regulation play.
Ex-JV players
Weston Press and Ken Baker, former
junior varsity players, led the way for
Jockobatsi. Press scored 18 points for
the night. Dave Gonzales, who missed
two open shots with five seconds left
in regulation, scored six in the over
time.
Kim Cater, with eight points, and
Dave Plager, with 14. led the Arroyo
scoring.
The semis, which match Joc
kobatsi, possibly Arroyo, against
Soto and Phi Delt Bl against Broke B
will be played tonight in Maples at
9:30 and 10:30.
At times, the games will be, aesthet
ically a forlorn parody of the way bas
ketball should look, despite a number
of excellent individual players. Still,
lrom a more cosmic perspective,
you're sure to see the kind o£ unre
lieved intensity which characterizes
basketball as it should be played.

FAMILIAR FACES—Footballer Ron Inge of Sixth Ward shoots over Phi Delts'
Jerry Waldvogel, a quarterback on the football team, in an intramural li B" league
quarterfinal game Monday night. The Phi Delts defeated Sixth Ward to advance
to the semifinals tonight.
Balls squirt out of hands unpro
voked, layups bounce off the front of
the rim, jump shots hit other players
before they hit the net, passes hit the
top of the backboard and balls are
dribbled out of bounds.
What is it? No, it's not the IJSC bas
ketball team in action. It's the men's
"B" intramural basketball quarter fi
nals competition.
The forty players who stampede ac
ross the three side courts at Maples
Pavilion don't exactly have Dick Di-
Biaso drooling at the prospect of hav
ing found some closet David
Thompson, yet the games are exciting.
Watching the intramural playoffs, one
discovers that excitement in basketball
is less a function of the artistry exhi
bited than the intensity.
IM basketball is the biggest single
participation sport at Stanford, with
something like 1500 people playing.
Men's "B" basketball represents the
biggest of the big with about 200 teams
competing, HO of which make the
playoffs. Now only four remain:
twelfth-seeded Soto, the only seed left
in the tournament, Phi Delt 81, Joc
kobatsi and Broke B. The survivor of
the four gets a team picture which
hangs in the IM office, their names re
corded somewhere for posterity, a
trophy and 20 IM points.
More than a game
From the looks of it Monday night,
one would have thought the eight
teams were playing for med school ac
ceptances, even Crothers, Law School
team. The thirty or so spectators at
each game jumped up and down with
anxiety, whistled, hollered and
screamed at the refs. The twenty
players on the courts jumped up and
down, whistled, hollered and
screamedat the refs. The refs jumped
up and down . . . screaming at the
players. There probably hasn't been so
much dissonance at Maples since
Stephen Stills appeared there.
In one of the most dissonant games
ot the evening, Soto brought Derek
and the Dominos to their 41-38.
Soto came back from a 22-10 halftime
deficit by installing a double teaming
press which broke the Dominos'poise
in the last minutes of the game.
Actually, the game was the most in
teresting variation on basketball, as the
refs decided to invent a game with a
whole new set of rules combining the
most violent aspects of football, hoc
key and limited non-nuclear war
without telling any of the players. In
any case, Soto made the adjustment
taster. They also beat the Dominos at
the two essential basketball aspects
left in the game, rebounding and
shooting.
In this corner .. .
Freshmen Connie Woolridge and
Bill Maloney controlled the boards

and the shoving match. Maloney had
18 points in the game as he also helped
key the Soto press. Adlai Alexander hit
three long jumpers to close the gap for
the last time.
For the Dominos, Derek Daley did an
excellent imitation of Marques
Johnson with three acrobatic leaps to
the basket culminating in field goals
before being gang-tackled and hurting
his ankle. Chris Larkin and Lewis De
larosa managed to hit outside on occa
sion.
On the other court, ten huge men
rumbled from basket to basket, as Phi
Delt 131 upset second-seeded sixth
Ward, 34-32 in front of clusters of
people in double knit sweet suits and
down parkas.
In a Chekhov novella, Ward Six was
a Russian insane asylum. If you like to

live in the book setting, you probably
would have liked to see the basketball
team which had beaten one of its
playoff opponents 94-23.
The game was an explosion of col
liding bodies, loose ball scrambles,
court-length passes, air balls and
amazing athleticism. It looked as if the
two teams were trying to do their own
version of a Merrill Lynch commercial.
With footballers Ron Inge, Gerald Wil
son and Dave Strong playing for Sixth
Ward, and Jerry Waldvogel playing for
the Phi Delts, the character of the game
came as no surprise.

Weston Press and Ken Baker, former
junior varsity players, led the way for
Jockobatsi. Press scored 18 points for
the night. Dave Gonzales, who missed
two open shots with five seconds left
in regulation, scored six in the over
time.
Kim Cater, with eight points, and
Dave Plager, with 14. led the Arroyo
scoring.
The semis, which match Joc
kobatsi, possibly Arroyo, against
Soto and Phi Delt Bl against Broke B
will be played tonight in Maples at
9:30 and 10:30.
At times, the games will be, aesthet
ically a forlorn parody of the way bas
ketball should look, despite a number
of excellent individual players. Still,
lrom a more cosmic perspective,
you're sure to see the kind o£ unre
lieved intensity which characterizes
basketball as it should be played.

FAMILIAR FACES—Footballer Ron Inge of Sixth Ward shoots over Phi Delts'
Jerry Waldvogel, a quarterback on the football team, in an intramural li B" league
quarterfinal game Monday night. The Phi Delts defeated Sixth Ward to advance
to the semifinals tonight.
Balls squirt out of hands unpro
voked, layups bounce off the front of
the rim, jump shots hit other players
before they hit the net, passes hit the
top of the backboard and balls are
dribbled out of bounds.
What is it? No, it's not the IJSC bas
ketball team in action. It's the men's
"B" intramural basketball quarter fi
nals competition.
The forty players who stampede ac
ross the three side courts at Maples
Pavilion don't exactly have Dick Di-
Biaso drooling at the prospect of hav
ing found some closet David
Thompson, yet the games are exciting.
Watching the intramural playoffs, one
discovers that excitement in basketball
is less a function of the artistry exhi
bited than the intensity.
IM basketball is the biggest single
participation sport at Stanford, with
something like 1500 people playing.
Men's "B" basketball represents the
biggest of the big with about 200 teams
competing, HO of which make the
playoffs. Now only four remain:
twelfth-seeded Soto, the only seed left
in the tournament, Phi Delt 81, Joc
kobatsi and Broke B. The survivor of
the four gets a team picture which
hangs in the IM office, their names re
corded somewhere for posterity, a
trophy and 20 IM points.
More than a game
From the looks of it Monday night,
one would have thought the eight
teams were playing for med school ac
ceptances, even Crothers, Law School
team. The thirty or so spectators at
each game jumped up and down with
anxiety, whistled, hollered and
screamed at the refs. The twenty
players on the courts jumped up and
down, whistled, hollered and
screamedat the refs. The refs jumped
up and down . . . screaming at the
players. There probably hasn't been so
much dissonance at Maples since
Stephen Stills appeared there.
In one of the most dissonant games
ot the evening, Soto brought Derek
and the Dominos to their 41-38.
Soto came back from a 22-10 halftime
deficit by installing a double teaming
press which broke the Dominos'poise
in the last minutes of the game.
Actually, the game was the most in
teresting variation on basketball, as the
refs decided to invent a game with a
whole new set of rules combining the
most violent aspects of football, hoc
key and limited non-nuclear war
without telling any of the players. In
any case, Soto made the adjustment
taster. They also beat the Dominos at
the two essential basketball aspects
left in the game, rebounding and
shooting.
In this corner .. .
Freshmen Connie Woolridge and
Bill Maloney controlled the boards

and the shoving match. Maloney had
18 points in the game as he also helped
key the Soto press. Adlai Alexander hit
three long jumpers to close the gap for
the last time.
For the Dominos, Derek Daley did an
excellent imitation of Marques
Johnson with three acrobatic leaps to
the basket culminating in field goals
before being gang-tackled and hurting
his ankle. Chris Larkin and Lewis De
larosa managed to hit outside on occa
sion.
On the other court, ten huge men
rumbled from basket to basket, as Phi
Delt 131 upset second-seeded sixth
Ward, 34-32 in front of clusters of
people in double knit sweet suits and
down parkas.
In a Chekhov novella, Ward Six was
a Russian insane asylum. If you like to

live in the book setting, you probably
would have liked to see the basketball
team which had beaten one of its
playoff opponents 94-23.
The game was an explosion of col
liding bodies, loose ball scrambles,
court-length passes, air balls and
amazing athleticism. It looked as if the
two teams were trying to do their own
version of a Merrill Lynch commercial.
With footballers Ron Inge, Gerald Wil
son and Dave Strong playing for Sixth
Ward, and Jerry Waldvogel playing for
the Phi Delts, the character of the game
came as no surprise.
Came from behind
The real surprise came when the
dust cleared and the Phi Delts had
emerged victorious after being behind
16-12 at the half. Tim Wylder (eight
points), Chris kamel (six) and Tom

Mason (six) led the balanced Phi Delt
scoring. Waldvogel. et al. shut off the
Sixth Ward shooting by playing an
even more physical game than their
opponents.
The Crothers — Broke B game
matched two very similar teams. Both
featurd strong ball handling, good
quickness, occasional good outside
shooting and fast-breaking offenses.
Crothers definitely had the biggest
and noisiest cheering section of the
night. Broke probably had the loudest
bench.
The intensity of the goings-on Mon
day evening manifested itself most
clearly in this game. Broke's center
was cut earlier in the game and played
to the end with blood running down
from his eye. Broke's hirsute guards,
one in tennis shorts and sneakers with
no socks, harassed opponents as if they
were Popeye Doyle chasing dope deal
ers. Crother's Alan Epstein, who
scored 13 points, Michael Morris, with
eight and Joseph Mais were a frenzy of
squealing sneakers, gritting teeth and
waving, poking arms and hands.
Desperation tactics
Unfortunately for Crothers. the ex
cellent floor play of Broke guard Marty
Davis foiled Crothers' desperation
pressing tactics at the end of the game.
The final score: 42-35, Broke.
The jockobatsi — Arroyo game
was the closest of the evening and no
less intense. Even after Jockobatsi
won in overtime, 47-45, after regula
tion time had ended at 33-33, the ten
sion was not relieved. Arroyo alleged
that one of the Jockobatsi players had
played tor another team. A protest was
filed Tuesday afternoon.
Jockobatsi, which picked up its
fifth man by finding someone shooting
baskets on the next court five minutes
before the beginning of its first game,
made a succesful run at a six-point Ar
royo lead in the last five minutes of
regulation play.
Ex-JV players
Weston Press and Ken Baker, former
junior varsity players, led the way for
Jockobatsi. Press scored 18 points for
the night. Dave Gonzales, who missed
two open shots with five seconds left
in regulation, scored six in the over
time.
Kim Cater, with eight points, and
Dave Plager, with 14. led the Arroyo
scoring.
The semis, which match Joc
kobatsi, possibly Arroyo, against
Soto and Phi Delt Bl against Broke B
will be played tonight in Maples at
9:30 and 10:30.
