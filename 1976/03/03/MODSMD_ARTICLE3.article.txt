# Raid evidence inadmissable?
## Hearst trial hits snag 
### Chris Baker 
SAN FRANCISCO—The bank rob
bery trial of Patricia Hearst hit another
roadblock late yesterday afternoon,
when chief defense attorney F. Lee
Bailey asked U.S. District Court Judge
Oliver Carter to suppress evidence
which the FBI seized at the San Fran
cisco hideout of William and Emily
Harris in a raid last Sept. 18.
With the jury outside the court,
Bailey asked Carter to keep the "Bak
ery Papers," a document containing
Symbionese Liberation Army con
tingency plans and allegedly authored
by Hearst, out of the trial.
Superior Court Judge Mark Bradler
ruled in Los Angeles Monday that
material seized in the raid could not be
introduced in the Harrises' kidnaping
and robbery trial.
Saying he first learned of Bradler's
decision Monday, Bailey moved that
the seized documents also be suppres
sed in the Hearst trial.
The documents also include the lay
out of a Marysville bank.
No 'frivolous motions'
"It is not my practice to bring frivol
ous motions before the court," said
Bailey. "But I just learned of the deci
sion last night."
Bradler ruled that the material could
not be introduced as evidence in the
Harrises' trial because it was illegally
obtained.

He said FBI agents did not have
search warrants when they entered the
Harrises' apartment, although the law
enforcement agency had the hideout
under surveillance for 30 hours.
U.S. Atty. James Browning, who had
planned to call the manager of the
Marysville bank to identify the layout
yesterday, opposed the motion, saying
Bailev should have made it when evi
dence was first presented before the
trial.
Prosecution cooperation
Browning agreed, however, to coop
erate with the defense in rounding up
the necessary witnesses so that Carter
can hear the motion when the trial re
convenes this morning.
Earlier, Browning had a surprise of
his own, calling a witness who tes
tified that Hearst was fully armed
when she participated in the Hibernia
bank robbery in April 1974.
Sigurd Berzins, a stereo-store owner
whose shop is across the street from
the bank, said he saw Hearst spill two
clips and another two rounds of am
munition onto the sidewalk in front of
the bank.
Hearst has testified that the only
ammunition she carried during the
robbery was a single clip loaded in the
gun she carried, and that she doubted
that her gun was in working order.
Despite some of the most vigorous
cross-examination of the trial, Berzins

stuck to his story. As Bailey tried to
rattle the Vietnam veteran with a bar
rage ot questions, Berzins protested,
"You're trying to twist what I'm say
ing."
Berzins recalled rushing into the
bank the morning of the robbery to
make a deposit, and as the door slam
med behind him. Berzins said that he
heard a"metallic noise" and turned
around.
"I saw a person on his knees and
there was a weapon on the knee," tes
tified Berzins. lie said he. "noticed
two clips of ammunition on the
sidewalk. I noticed her hand come out
and tryed to retrieve the clip."
Me added that when the person
dropped the clip she also dropped one
or two ammunition rounds.
Demonstration
With a packed courtroom looking
on, Berzins dropped to his knees, with
a carbine rifle slung over his shoulder,
and demonstrated how Hearst held the
gun as she picked up the ammunition.
Seizing on the fact that Berzins said
"his knees," Bailey sought to prove
that the person Berzins saw in the bank
might have been a man.
"The person I saw was a woman."
said Berzins, "there's no doubt about
it." The courtroom then was treated to
one of the most humorous sessions of
the trial.
"How do you tell a woman from a
man without a physical examina
tion?" asked Bailey. "Like we all do,"
said Berzins, as the spectators burst
into laughter. "If you ask me what I
saw, I saw a woman. The hands were
female. The hair was female."
Laughter
Questioning Berzins' ability to de
termine a person's sex by looking at
thp hair, Bailey asked, "How long have
you been in San Francisco?" The cour
troom burst into laughter and a woman
shouted "Right on."
Bailey then asked him how he could
distinguish a female body. "Did it have
the fulsome proportions of a voluptu
ous young lady?." asked Bailey. Carter
V v>w....w... ..
then warned him to stop using "ar
gumentative words."
After the witness said that he was
not looking at the person's breasts,
Bailey gave up trying to prove that the
person Berzins saw in the Hibernia
hank might have been a male and tried
to show that Berzins was unsure which
woman it was — that it could have
been either Nancy Ling Perry or Pat
ricia Soltysik, both SLA members.
Identifications
But the surprise witness stuck to his
story that the woman had "long wavy
hair." Looking at the film of the rob
bery. he identified all three of the
women correctly.
Berzins was followed to the witness
stand by San Mateo County Deputy
Sheriff Stephanie Marsh, who booked
Hearst into jail after the newspaper
heiress was arrested Sept. 18.
"1 asked Miss Hearst what her occu
pation was." said Marsh. "There was
no response. I then asked her if she was
a student or had ever had a job. And
she replied 'Urban guerrilla.'
March testified that when she asked
Hearst if she went by any other names
besides Patricia Campbell Hearst, she
said 'Tania,' and then spelled it for
me."
In cross-examination the defense
tried to establish the fact that Emily
Harris was standing nearby when
Hearst made her statements. It con
tends that Hearst made the statements
out of fear.
