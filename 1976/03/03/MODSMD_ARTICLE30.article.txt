# Pac-8 predictions
## 
### 
Last week our predictor got
off to almost as bad a start as
Stanford did against UCLA in
the second half Saturday.
Oregon had won nine
games in a row, and was host
ing eighth-ranked Washington
in McArthur Court, where it's
as hard for visiting teams to
win as it is for someone to
leave a whorehouse without
paying.
But, much to our prognos
ticator's chagrin, the Huskies
pulled it off. So our wizard
picked five of eight games
correctly last week. His record
going into the last week of the
season stands at 41 for 62, a
.661 mark.
Stanford has seventh place
all locked up with a 2-11
Pacific Eight mark going into
Friday's contest in California's
intimate Harmon Gym. The
Bears have a tight grip on
sixth place with a 4-9 record.
You might remember that
when Cat invaded the Farm
two months ago, the contest
resembled something out of a
daytime television drama, with
Stanford staging an incredible

14-point comeback to send
the contest into two overtimes.
The Cards muffed two
chances to win it, as last
second shots glazed the
backboard. The Bears finally
won it, 89-85. Cal has now
taken four games in a row from
Stanford.
That streak should end in
Harmon Gym Friday night.
The Bears had trouble beating
USC, finally winning 96-94 in
overtime last Saturday. Stan
ford, after being killed by
UCLA, has no place to go but
up.
UCLA should win its 10th
consecutive league crown at
USC's expense in the Pac-8
TV Game of the Week Satur
day.
Up in Corvallis, Ore., the
final battle of the Oregon civil
war will be the most important,
although the Ducks have al
ready won two of the three
previous meetings this sea
son, including the conference
game at Mac Court.'
Look for the Beavers to go
Duck hunting and beat Ore
gon.

Stanford over Cal by 4
UCLA over USC by 4
Oregon State over Oregon by 5
Washington over Washington State by 5
