Peace imperiled in Lebanon
HEIKIJT — Renegade soldiers in Lebanon's
snow-covered Bekaa Valley are refusing gov
ernment overtures to surrender, menacing the
cease-fire that ended 10 months of civil war.
The heavily armed Moslems demand a public
amnesty decree from Premier Rashid Karami as a
guarantee of his pledges of good treatment for
those who bolted for political reasons.
The most prominent breakaway, Lt. Ahmed
Al-Khatib, said he and his 70 men will hold out
until "the goals of the impoverished people" are
met and religious balance is imposed on the
Lebanese army. It has an officer corps that is
largely Christian and Western-trained and
oriented.
khatib made his declaration to a Beirut news
paper as a March 1 surrender deadline set by
Karami slipped by without any sign that the
embarrassing desertion problem was near solu
tion.
The government's inability to recover the de
serters dramatized its lack of authority over wide
stretches of the country.
Syrian cease-fire supervisors apparently have
not forced the issue for fear of upsetting delicate
political negotiations tor formation of a "na
tional union" government.
But C Christian leaders are reported insisting on
restoration of state; authority before a new gov
ernment is formed.
Japanese fear terrorist wave
SAI'PORC). Japan — A powerful explosion in a
state office building that killed two persons and
injured H5 touched off fears yesterday of a new
wave of radical bombings in Japan.
Police said they believed the blast in the entr
ance hall of the 12-story building which occur
red as people were going to work was caused by
<i time bomb.
Three hours after the explosion, an organiza
tion calling itself "East Asia Anti-Japanese
Armed front" said it had set the bomb to show
opposition to "Japanese imperialism."
It was the same name used by terrorists who
bombed the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries head
quarters in Tokyo in August 1974, killing eight
persons and injuring more than 300.
It also was the name used by those who in July
1 ( )74 bombed Hokkaido police headquarters,
next door to the Hokkaido state government

headquarters that was blasted yesterday.
National police ordered officers throughout
Japan to step up precautions against further ter
rorism possibly directed against big business
and government offices.
After the explosion, a local newspaper re
ceived a call saying a communique had been
placed in a subway station coin locker.
Authorities found a statement saying,
"We . . . have to crack down on Japanese im
perialism on behalf of the Ainu. Okinawan. Ko
rean. Taiwanese, Buraku Japanese social out
casts and other Asian people.
"The Hokkaido prefectural state government
■lias been trying to reclaim four northern islands,
but Hokkaido, Sakhalin and the Kurile Islands
are the sacred motherland of the Ainu and other
minority people," it added.
The statement denounced the Soviet Union
for holding the four northern islands, seized
after World War 11. It also castigated Japan for
trying to get them back and China for suppor
ting Japan's stand.
U.S. drops anti-trust suits
WASHINGTON — The Justice Department
yesterday dropped lawsuits intended to break
up the Goodyear and Firestone tire companies
after officials concluded they could not prove
charges of an attempted illegal monopoly.
The civil antitrust suits, filed in 1973 in the
U.S. District Court in Cleveland, were dropped
when the government and the companies sub
mitted a dismissal agreement to the court vestr
day.
Under the agreement, the department agreed
to drop the charges "without prejudice," mean
ing it could reopen the case it it wishes.
A department spokesman said the department
has spent about $1 million on the case since the
suits were filed.
"It has been with the greatest reluctance that I
have come to the conclusion that the complaints
in these cases should be dismissed . . . But at
this point I believe it irresponsible to proceed
further," Asst. Atty. Gen. Thomas Kauper said in
a memo to Atty. Gen. Edward Levi.
Kauper said he is convinced that the depart
ment doesn't have enough evidence to prove
that Goodyear and Firestone, the nation's two
largest tire manufacturers, illegally attempted to
monopolize the market.
The case dealt with the $2 billion annual mar

ket for tires sold to consumers. It did not concern
the smaller market for tires sold to automakers
for use as original equipment on new cars.
In the lawsuits, the government had sought
court orders to force Goodyear and Firestone to
divest themselves of certain assets in what
would have been a major restructuring of the tire
industry.
French resent U.S. advice
PARIS — American warnings to French
politicians against admitting Communists into a
future coalition government have caused a polit
ical uproar here and led to the cancellation of an
official visit to Marseille by U.S. Ambassador
Kenneth Rush.
Rush was to have met with Marseille Mayor
Gaston Deferre, one of the leaders of the Socialist
party and a former presidential candidate, dur
ing a March 4-5 visit to France's second largest
city.
An American Embassy spokesman said Rush
was suffering from influenza. But this did not
prevent his appearing at his office yesterday
morning.
Defferre, who has opposed Communists in
local Marseille elections, accused the U.S. Em
bassy Sunday of "an absolutely intolerable in
trusion" in French domestic affairs, after an
American diplomat warned him against permit
ting Communists into the government in the
future.
Panel rejects gun control law
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary
Committee sent a controversial gun control bill
back to a subcommittee yesterday, apparently
crippling efforts to enact stricter federal curbs on
firearms this year.
The bill would have prohibited the manufac
ture, importation and sale of so-called conceala
ble handguns. It also set higher license fees for
gun dealers and would have imposed a 28-day
waiting period before a handgun sale could be
completed.
The bill also set mandatory jail sentences for
using a firearm to commit such crimes as mur
der. robbery, assault, kidnaping, arson, ter

ronsm and air piracy.
Harlan Carter, chief lobbyist tor the National
Kitie Association, called the committee's deci
sion an example of "democracy in action."
Backers of the bill expressed disappointment.
Rep. Robert Drinan (I)-Mass.) said the "rifle
lobby intimidated these people."
The action came on a motion by Rep. Torn
Raisback (R-lll.) to return the bill to the sub
committee on crime the Judiciary Committee
panel that drafted the measure. The vote to re
commit was 17 to lb.
The Judiciary Committee has not sent a gun

jail, authorities said
Twelve other persons, including Sheriff Pete

Peace imperiled in Lebanon
HEIKIJT — Renegade soldiers in Lebanon's
snow-covered Bekaa Valley are refusing gov
ernment overtures to surrender, menacing the
cease-fire that ended 10 months of civil war.
The heavily armed Moslems demand a public
amnesty decree from Premier Rashid Karami as a
guarantee of his pledges of good treatment for
those who bolted for political reasons.
The most prominent breakaway, Lt. Ahmed
Al-Khatib, said he and his 70 men will hold out
until "the goals of the impoverished people" are
met and religious balance is imposed on the
Lebanese army. It has an officer corps that is
largely Christian and Western-trained and
oriented.
khatib made his declaration to a Beirut news
paper as a March 1 surrender deadline set by
Karami slipped by without any sign that the
embarrassing desertion problem was near solu
tion.
The government's inability to recover the de
serters dramatized its lack of authority over wide
stretches of the country.
Syrian cease-fire supervisors apparently have
not forced the issue for fear of upsetting delicate
political negotiations tor formation of a "na
tional union" government.
But C Christian leaders are reported insisting on
restoration of state; authority before a new gov

Japanese fear terrorist wave
SAI'PORC). Japan — A powerful explosion in a
state office building that killed two persons and
injured H5 touched off fears yesterday of a new
wave of radical bombings in Japan.
Police said they believed the blast in the entr
ance hall of the 12-story building which occur
red as people were going to work was caused by
<i time bomb.
Three hours after the explosion, an organiza
tion calling itself "East Asia Anti-Japanese
Armed front" said it had set the bomb to show
opposition to "Japanese imperialism."
It was the same name used by terrorists who
bombed the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries head
quarters in Tokyo in August 1974, killing eight
persons and injuring more than 300.
It also was the name used by those who in July
1 ( )74 bombed Hokkaido police headquarters,
next door to the Hokkaido state government

headquarters that was blasted yesterday.
National police ordered officers throughout
Japan to step up precautions against further ter
rorism possibly directed against big business
and government offices.
After the explosion, a local newspaper re
ceived a call saying a communique had been
placed in a subway station coin locker.
Authorities found a statement saying,
"We . . . have to crack down on Japanese im
perialism on behalf of the Ainu. Okinawan. Ko
rean. Taiwanese, Buraku Japanese social out
casts and other Asian people.
"The Hokkaido prefectural state government
■lias been trying to reclaim four northern islands,
but Hokkaido, Sakhalin and the Kurile Islands
are the sacred motherland of the Ainu and other
minority people," it added.
The statement denounced the Soviet Union
for holding the four northern islands, seized
after World War 11. It also castigated Japan for
trying to get them back and China for suppor
ting Japan's stand.
U.S. drops anti-trust suits
WASHINGTON — The Justice Department
yesterday dropped lawsuits intended to break
up the Goodyear and Firestone tire companies
after officials concluded they could not prove
charges of an attempted illegal monopoly.
The civil antitrust suits, filed in 1973 in the
U.S. District Court in Cleveland, were dropped
when the government and the companies sub
mitted a dismissal agreement to the court vestr
day.
Under the agreement, the department agreed
to drop the charges "without prejudice," mean
ing it could reopen the case it it wishes.
A department spokesman said the department
has spent about $1 million on the case since the
suits were filed.
"It has been with the greatest reluctance that I
have come to the conclusion that the complaints
in these cases should be dismissed . . . But at
this point I believe it irresponsible to proceed
further," Asst. Atty. Gen. Thomas Kauper said in
a memo to Atty. Gen. Edward Levi.
Kauper said he is convinced that the depart
ment doesn't have enough evidence to prove
that Goodyear and Firestone, the nation's two
largest tire manufacturers, illegally attempted to
monopolize the market.
The case dealt with the $2 billion annual mar

ket for tires sold to consumers. It did not concern
the smaller market for tires sold to automakers
for use as original equipment on new cars.
In the lawsuits, the government had sought
court orders to force Goodyear and Firestone to
divest themselves of certain assets in what
would have been a major restructuring of the tire
industry.
French resent U.S. advice
PARIS — American warnings to French
politicians against admitting Communists into a
future coalition government have caused a polit

Rush was to have met with Marseille Mayor
Gaston Deferre, one of the leaders of the Socialist
party and a former presidential candidate, dur
ing a March 4-5 visit to France's second largest

An American Embassy spokesman said Rush
was suffering from influenza. But this did not
prevent his appearing at his office yesterday

Panel rejects gun control law
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary
Committee sent a controversial gun control bill
back to a subcommittee yesterday, apparently
crippling efforts to enact stricter federal curbs on
firearms this year.
The bill would have prohibited the manufac
ture, importation and sale of so-called conceala
ble handguns. It also set higher license fees for
gun dealers and would have imposed a 28-day
waiting period before a handgun sale could be
completed.
The bill also set mandatory jail sentences for
using a firearm to commit such crimes as mur
der. robbery, assault, kidnaping, arson, ter

ronsm and air piracy.
Harlan Carter, chief lobbyist tor the National
Kitie Association, called the committee's deci
sion an example of "democracy in action."
Backers of the bill expressed disappointment.
Rep. Robert Drinan (I)-Mass.) said the "rifle
lobby intimidated these people."
The action came on a motion by Rep. Torn
Raisback (R-lll.) to return the bill to the sub

Peace imperiled in Lebanon
HEIKIJT — Renegade soldiers in Lebanon's
snow-covered Bekaa Valley are refusing gov

amnesty decree from Premier Rashid Karami as a

Japanese fear terrorist wave
SAI'PORC). Japan — A powerful explosion in a
state office building that killed two persons and
injured H5 touched off fears yesterday of a new
wave of radical bombings in Japan.
Police said they believed the blast in the entr
ance hall of the 12-story building which occur
red as people were going to work was caused by
<i time bomb.
Three hours after the explosion, an organiza
tion calling itself "East Asia Anti-Japanese
Armed front" said it had set the bomb to show
opposition to "Japanese imperialism."
It was the same name used by terrorists who
bombed the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries head
quarters in Tokyo in August 1974, killing eight
persons and injuring more than 300.
It also was the name used by those who in July
1 ( )74 bombed Hokkaido police headquarters,
next door to the Hokkaido state government

headquarters that was blasted yesterday.
National police ordered officers throughout
Japan to step up precautions against further ter
rorism possibly directed against big business
and government offices.
After the explosion, a local newspaper re
ceived a call saying a communique had been
placed in a subway station coin locker.
Authorities found a statement saying,
"We . . . have to crack down on Japanese im
perialism on behalf of the Ainu. Okinawan. Ko
rean. Taiwanese, Buraku Japanese social out
casts and other Asian people.
"The Hokkaido prefectural state government
■lias been trying to reclaim four northern islands,
but Hokkaido, Sakhalin and the Kurile Islands
are the sacred motherland of the Ainu and other
minority people," it added.
The statement denounced the Soviet Union
for holding the four northern islands, seized
after World War 11. It also castigated Japan for
trying to get them back and China for suppor
ting Japan's stand.
U.S. drops anti-trust suits
WASHINGTON — The Justice Department
yesterday dropped lawsuits intended to break
up the Goodyear and Firestone tire companies
after officials concluded they could not prove
charges of an attempted illegal monopoly.
The civil antitrust suits, filed in 1973 in the
U.S. District Court in Cleveland, were dropped
when the government and the companies sub
mitted a dismissal agreement to the court vestr
day.
Under the agreement, the department agreed
to drop the charges "without prejudice," mean
ing it could reopen the case it it wishes.
A department spokesman said the department
has spent about $1 million on the case since the
suits were filed.
"It has been with the greatest reluctance that I
have come to the conclusion that the complaints
in these cases should be dismissed . . . But at
this point I believe it irresponsible to proceed
further," Asst. Atty. Gen. Thomas Kauper said in
a memo to Atty. Gen. Edward Levi.
Kauper said he is convinced that the depart
ment doesn't have enough evidence to prove
that Goodyear and Firestone, the nation's two
largest tire manufacturers, illegally attempted to
monopolize the market.
The case dealt with the $2 billion annual mar

ket for tires sold to consumers. It did not concern
the smaller market for tires sold to automakers
for use as original equipment on new cars.
In the lawsuits, the government had sought
court orders to force Goodyear and Firestone to
divest themselves of certain assets in what
would have been a major restructuring of the tire
industry.
French resent U.S. advice
PARIS — American warnings to French
politicians against admitting Communists into a

Rush was to have met with Marseille Mayor
Gaston Deferre, one of the leaders of the Socialist

Panel rejects gun control law
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary
Committee sent a controversial gun control bill
back to a subcommittee yesterday, apparently
crippling efforts to enact stricter federal curbs on
firearms this year.
The bill would have prohibited the manufac
ture, importation and sale of so-called conceala
ble handguns. It also set higher license fees for
gun dealers and would have imposed a 28-day
waiting period before a handgun sale could be
completed.
The bill also set mandatory jail sentences for
using a firearm to commit such crimes as mur
der. robbery, assault, kidnaping, arson, ter

ronsm and air piracy.
Harlan Carter, chief lobbyist tor the National
Kitie Association, called the committee's deci
sion an example of "democracy in action."
Backers of the bill expressed disappointment.

elapsed between Sisk's appearance at the jail
and the blast.
The blast damaged jail cells and the sheriff's
offices above, a police spokesman said. State
police headquarters also are in the brick and

James Farley, administrator at Pleasant Valley

Peace imperiled in Lebanon
HEIKIJT — Renegade soldiers in Lebanon's
snow-covered Bekaa Valley are refusing gov
ernment overtures to surrender, menacing the
cease-fire that ended 10 months of civil war.
The heavily armed Moslems demand a public
amnesty decree from Premier Rashid Karami as a
guarantee of his pledges of good treatment for
those who bolted for political reasons.
The most prominent breakaway, Lt. Ahmed
Al-Khatib, said he and his 70 men will hold out
until "the goals of the impoverished people" are
met and religious balance is imposed on the
Lebanese army. It has an officer corps that is
largely Christian and Western-trained and
oriented.
khatib made his declaration to a Beirut news
paper as a March 1 surrender deadline set by
Karami slipped by without any sign that the
embarrassing desertion problem was near solu
tion.
The government's inability to recover the de
serters dramatized its lack of authority over wide
stretches of the country.
Syrian cease-fire supervisors apparently have
not forced the issue for fear of upsetting delicate
political negotiations tor formation of a "na
tional union" government.
But C Christian leaders are reported insisting on
restoration of state; authority before a new gov
ernment is formed.
Japanese fear terrorist wave
SAI'PORC). Japan — A powerful explosion in a
state office building that killed two persons and
injured H5 touched off fears yesterday of a new
wave of radical bombings in Japan.
Police said they believed the blast in the entr
ance hall of the 12-story building which occur
red as people were going to work was caused by
<i time bomb.
Three hours after the explosion, an organiza
tion calling itself "East Asia Anti-Japanese
Armed front" said it had set the bomb to show
opposition to "Japanese imperialism."
It was the same name used by terrorists who
bombed the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries head
quarters in Tokyo in August 1974, killing eight
persons and injuring more than 300.
It also was the name used by those who in July
1 ( )74 bombed Hokkaido police headquarters,
next door to the Hokkaido state government

headquarters that was blasted yesterday.
National police ordered officers throughout
Japan to step up precautions against further ter
rorism possibly directed against big business
and government offices.
After the explosion, a local newspaper re
ceived a call saying a communique had been
placed in a subway station coin locker.
Authorities found a statement saying,
"We . . . have to crack down on Japanese im
perialism on behalf of the Ainu. Okinawan. Ko
rean. Taiwanese, Buraku Japanese social out
casts and other Asian people.
"The Hokkaido prefectural state government
■lias been trying to reclaim four northern islands,
but Hokkaido, Sakhalin and the Kurile Islands
are the sacred motherland of the Ainu and other
minority people," it added.
The statement denounced the Soviet Union
for holding the four northern islands, seized
after World War 11. It also castigated Japan for
trying to get them back and China for suppor
ting Japan's stand.
U.S. drops anti-trust suits
WASHINGTON — The Justice Department
yesterday dropped lawsuits intended to break
up the Goodyear and Firestone tire companies
after officials concluded they could not prove
charges of an attempted illegal monopoly.
The civil antitrust suits, filed in 1973 in the
U.S. District Court in Cleveland, were dropped
when the government and the companies sub
mitted a dismissal agreement to the court vestr
day.
Under the agreement, the department agreed
to drop the charges "without prejudice," mean
ing it could reopen the case it it wishes.
A department spokesman said the department
has spent about $1 million on the case since the
suits were filed.
"It has been with the greatest reluctance that I
have come to the conclusion that the complaints
in these cases should be dismissed . . . But at
this point I believe it irresponsible to proceed
further," Asst. Atty. Gen. Thomas Kauper said in
a memo to Atty. Gen. Edward Levi.
Kauper said he is convinced that the depart
ment doesn't have enough evidence to prove
that Goodyear and Firestone, the nation's two
largest tire manufacturers, illegally attempted to
monopolize the market.
The case dealt with the $2 billion annual mar

ket for tires sold to consumers. It did not concern
the smaller market for tires sold to automakers
for use as original equipment on new cars.
In the lawsuits, the government had sought
court orders to force Goodyear and Firestone to
divest themselves of certain assets in what
would have been a major restructuring of the tire
industry.
French resent U.S. advice
PARIS — American warnings to French
politicians against admitting Communists into a
future coalition government have caused a polit
ical uproar here and led to the cancellation of an
official visit to Marseille by U.S. Ambassador
Kenneth Rush.
Rush was to have met with Marseille Mayor
Gaston Deferre, one of the leaders of the Socialist
party and a former presidential candidate, dur
ing a March 4-5 visit to France's second largest
city.
An American Embassy spokesman said Rush
was suffering from influenza. But this did not
prevent his appearing at his office yesterday
morning.
Defferre, who has opposed Communists in
local Marseille elections, accused the U.S. Em
bassy Sunday of "an absolutely intolerable in
trusion" in French domestic affairs, after an
American diplomat warned him against permit
ting Communists into the government in the
future.
Panel rejects gun control law
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary
Committee sent a controversial gun control bill
back to a subcommittee yesterday, apparently
crippling efforts to enact stricter federal curbs on
firearms this year.
The bill would have prohibited the manufac
ture, importation and sale of so-called conceala
ble handguns. It also set higher license fees for
gun dealers and would have imposed a 28-day
waiting period before a handgun sale could be
completed.
The bill also set mandatory jail sentences for
using a firearm to commit such crimes as mur
der. robbery, assault, kidnaping, arson, ter

ronsm and air piracy.
Harlan Carter, chief lobbyist tor the National
Kitie Association, called the committee's deci
sion an example of "democracy in action."
Backers of the bill expressed disappointment.
Rep. Robert Drinan (I)-Mass.) said the "rifle
lobby intimidated these people."
The action came on a motion by Rep. Torn
Raisback (R-lll.) to return the bill to the sub
committee on crime the Judiciary Committee
panel that drafted the measure. The vote to re
commit was 17 to lb.
The Judiciary Committee has not sent a gun
control hill to the floor since 1968,
