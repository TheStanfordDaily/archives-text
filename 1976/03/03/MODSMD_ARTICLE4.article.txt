## Jackson leads in Mass. 
### 
BOSTON (AP) — Sen. Henry
Jackson captured the lead in the
crowded Massachusetts presidential
primary last night and clipped the
frontrunner's wings of Georgia's
Jimmy Carter.
Carter won over two other entries in
the snowbound Vermont primary, but
was well back in the field in the Mas
sachusetts contest.
President Ford won the Republican
primary in Massachusetts, beating
former California Gov. Ronald Reagan
in a race in which neither man cam
paigned personally. Ford was alone on
the Vermont COP ballot, and snowed
under the Reagan write-in vote there.
Jackson, credited his considerable
labor support for the showing and pre
dicted even bigger things to come in
the April 6 New York primary.
"To get the Democratic nomination,
one must carry the industrial states,"
said the senator from Washington,

who came in seventh in Massachusetts
four years ago. "We're going to win
New York ... It could even be a land
slide — that's the meaning of Mas
sachusetts."
Wallace, running second to Jackson
in Massachusetts, said he considered it
a victory if he finished in the top three.
He told a rally in Miami: "Whether
they like it or not, I'm running second
and they thought I would run last."
Ford, speaking through his press
secretary, Ron Nessen said:
"Today's victories in Massachusetts
and Vermont and last week's victory in
New Hampshire indicate the momen
tum is swinging in the President's
favor. The President looks forward to
the Florida primary next week."
Massachusetts was the first Democ
ratic primary to match all the national
candidates, and the first outing for
Wallace, who made a major show of it.
Sen. Birch Bayh of Indiana appeared

to be the night's major casualty, gain
ing only five percent of the vote, and
talking like a candidate about to quit.
He thanked his supporters, and said
he would meet today with "some of
those who have been involved in this
campaign."
In local returns, Santa Clara County
voters approved Measure A, a one-half
cent sales tax increase to fund the
county transit district.
The measure's victory means that
the county will double its bus fleet and
begin construction of a light-rail
(streetcar) system in the West Valley. It
also means residents will soon by pay
ing a fiVi percent sales tax, up from the
present six percent.
County voters also approved Mea
sure B, which calls for advisory re
ferenda on the transit district every
five years.

BOSTON (AP) — Sen. Henry
Jackson captured the lead in the
crowded Massachusetts presidential
primary last night and clipped the
frontrunner's wings of Georgia's
Jimmy Carter.
Carter won over two other entries in
the snowbound Vermont primary, but
was well back in the field in the Mas
sachusetts contest.
President Ford won the Republican
primary in Massachusetts, beating
former California Gov. Ronald Reagan
in a race in which neither man cam
paigned personally. Ford was alone on
the Vermont COP ballot, and snowed
under the Reagan write-in vote there.
Jackson, credited his considerable
labor support for the showing and pre
dicted even bigger things to come in
the April 6 New York primary.
"To get the Democratic nomination,
one must carry the industrial states,"
said the senator from Washington,

who came in seventh in Massachusetts
four years ago. "We're going to win
New York ... It could even be a land
slide — that's the meaning of Mas
sachusetts."
Wallace, running second to Jackson
in Massachusetts, said he considered it
a victory if he finished in the top three.
He told a rally in Miami: "Whether
they like it or not, I'm running second
and they thought I would run last."
Ford, speaking through his press
secretary, Ron Nessen said:
"Today's victories in Massachusetts
and Vermont and last week's victory in
New Hampshire indicate the momen
tum is swinging in the President's
favor. The President looks forward to
the Florida primary next week."
Massachusetts was the first Democ
ratic primary to match all the national
candidates, and the first outing for
Wallace, who made a major show of it.
Sen. Birch Bayh of Indiana appeared

to be the night's major casualty, gain
ing only five percent of the vote, and
talking like a candidate about to quit.
He thanked his supporters, and said
he would meet today with "some of
those who have been involved in this
campaign."
