President Richard Lyman expressed
support last night for allocating Uni
versity fellowship* for graduate stu
dents on the basis of financial need.
Speaking on KZSIJ's Campus Con
ference Lyruan warned that many
technical problems would have to be
solved before such a change in the sys
tem of allocation could be made.
Stipends of $2310 per year are cur
rently offered to nearly all graduate
students in the School of Humanities
and Sciences.
According to Lyman, the University
would have to establish new adminis
trative procedures to determine need
criteria and make certain that it could
finance the new program before
changes could be made.
He added that the University hopes
to increase the size of stipends.
"The current level of graduate aid is
neither adequate nor competitive with
institutions similar to Stanford,"
Lyman said.
He added that it is "entirely con
ceivable" that a new program based on
student need would offer special ad
vantages to students with particularly
strong academic records in order to
encourage them to attend Stanford.
In other remarks. Lyman said that
the University's new plan to coordi
nate library services with UC-Berkeley
was given "a feeling of urgency" by
the University's present financial

crunch but probably would have been
implemented eventually anyway.
Lyman also noted that the Univer
sity has sought outside financial sup
port to help start the program.
If the program were implemented, it
probably would continue indefinitely,
Lyman added.
Lyman noted that the absence of cer
tain library materials here would not
inconvenience professors or students
because the books ordered from Ber
keley in the morning would arrive by
evening.
Although Lyman acknowledged
that implementation of the new prog
ram would involve considerable cost,
he said the lessened need for main
taining first-rate collections in every
major academic area here would even
tually enable the University to save a
large amount of money.
On another topic. Lyman noted that
Harvard University's insistence that
former United Nations Ambassador
Daniel Moynihan resign his U.N. post
or lose his tenure was consistent with
the leave of absence policies followed
by most universities.
Lyman noted that professors usually
are allowed only a two-year leave of
absence here.
He added that faculty members are
encouraged to take governmental posi
tions since these may contribute to bet
ter understanding of a field.

Speaking on KZSIJ's Campus Con
ference Lyruan warned that many
technical problems would have to be
solved before such a change in the sys
tem of allocation could be made.
Stipends of $2310 per year are cur
rently offered to nearly all graduate
students in the School of Humanities
and Sciences.
According to Lyman, the University
would have to establish new adminis
trative procedures to determine need
criteria and make certain that it could
finance the new program before
changes could be made.
He added that the University hopes
to increase the size of stipends.
"The current level of graduate aid is
neither adequate nor competitive with
institutions similar to Stanford,"
Lyman said.
He added that it is "entirely con
ceivable" that a new program based on
student need would offer special ad
vantages to students with particularly
strong academic records in order to
encourage them to attend Stanford.
In other remarks. Lyman said that
the University's new plan to coordi
nate library services with UC-Berkeley
was given "a feeling of urgency" by
the University's present financial

crunch but probably would have been
implemented eventually anyway.
Lyman also noted that the Univer
sity has sought outside financial sup
port to help start the program.
If the program were implemented, it
probably would continue indefinitely,
Lyman added.
Lyman noted that the absence of cer
tain library materials here would not
inconvenience professors or students
because the books ordered from Ber
keley in the morning would arrive by
evening.
Although Lyman acknowledged
that implementation of the new prog
ram would involve considerable cost,
he said the lessened need for main
taining first-rate collections in every
major academic area here would even
tually enable the University to save a
large amount of money.
On another topic. Lyman noted that
Harvard University's insistence that
former United Nations Ambassador
Daniel Moynihan resign his U.N. post
or lose his tenure was consistent with
the leave of absence policies followed
by most universities.
Lyman noted that professors usually
are allowed only a two-year leave of
absence here.
He added that faculty members are
encouraged to take governmental posi
tions since these may contribute to bet
ter understanding of a field.
