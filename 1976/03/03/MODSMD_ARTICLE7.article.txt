Belgian Trotskyist economist Ernest
Mandel may bean ASSU guest profes
sor spring quarter if he can get a visa,
according to Andrea Halliday, a
member of the ASSU Guest Professor
ship Board.
Halliday said last night that Provost
William Miller yesterday signed the
short term appointment for Mandel.
Mandel's short term appointment
must now go to the Board of Trustees
for final approval, "but by and large,
whatever the provost signs, they ap
prove," said Halliday.
Mandel had earlier told the board
that he could only teach from May 12-
June 9. However, last week, the board
received a letter from Mandel indicat
ing that he had been able to work out
his schedule so he could be here for the
entire spring quarter. Halliday said.
The board called Mandel im
mediately and confirmed that it was
possible for him to be here from March
30-June 9. Halliday said.
Mandel will be teaching two
courses:
Undergraduate Special (U.S.) 58,
"Post World War II Boom and Its End,"
5 units, Monday and Wednesday
2:15-4:05; and
U.S. 59, "West European Labor Pac
ing Depression and Fascism. 1929-
1939: France. Belgium, Spain and Eng
land." 5 units, Monday-Thursday 9
a.m.
Students may sign up for both
courses in Old Union starting today.
Halliday said the course outlines
were submitted to the economics de
partment yesterday to be considered
for department accreditation. She
added that it "may take a week or so"
before the board knows if the depart
ment will list the courses.
