## Better justice 
### 
The ASSU Council of Presidents (COP) is circulating
a petition to reconvene the Committee of 15 (C-15), a
group responsible for proposing changes in the cam
pus judicial system. We strongly support the efforts of
the COP and urge all students to sign these petitions.
There are two major problems with the current Stu
dent Judicial System (SJC), each of which indepen
dently justifies C-15 review.
As we have stated in the past, we favor a judicial
system with a student majority in all cases, not just
those involving the Honor Code, as is currently the
situation.
The Student Judicial System (SJC) should be just that
— a student alternative to judgment by University offi
cials.
Furthermore, we are opposed to the current method
of selecting student members from a randomly chosen
group of 20 students, while the faculty members are
selected by the Faculty Senate's Committee on Com
mittees.
At best, the selection method for the SJC represents a
double standard. At worst, there is serious injustice.
We feel that students and faculty members should be
chosen by similar methods.
These two major problems, student majority and
comparable selection methods for students and fa
culty, can not be amended away. Clearly, the structure
of'the SJC must be changed, and the C-15 is the duly
authorized body for proposing such changes.
At least two administrators have suggested that calls
for change in the SJC are premature. We disagree. The
system is unjust, and any further delay in change only
allows this injustice to continue.
As part of the review, we feel students should have a
chance to voice their opinions on the SJC.
Thus, we recommend that in addition to its peti
tions, the COP begin a drive to put a new SJC referen
dum on the April ballot, asking students whether they
approve of the system or not.
As we have stated before, the only student poll on
the SJC was last year's ambiguous referendum in
which more than 1000 students abstained. The SJC was
approved by a slim margin, 769 to 635.
A new indicator of student opinion, this time with a
clearly worded proposal, would provide the members
of the C-15 with helpful.guidelines to establish anew,
equitable student judicial system.
