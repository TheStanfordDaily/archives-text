# Book sharing

### 
We commend the University on its recent decision to
cooperate with UC-Berkeley in the acquisition of some
low-use library materials.
While an effective budget-cutting measure, the plan
should not seriously inconvenience most students.
But we do object to one important aspect of the plan:
the fact that only undergraduates involved in "bona
fide" research projects will be allowed full borrowing
and research privileges at both libraries.
This blatantly discriminates against undergraduates
for a number of reasons. It makes the tacit assumption
that graduate students using the library only work
within their own specific fields, whereas under
graduates might wander astray, using materials not
directly related to their majors.
Any person may have a specialized interest outside
of his own field of concentration. It is unfair for under
graduates to require special permission to look into
their interests, while others — faculty, academic staff
and graduate students — may do so freely.
We urge the University and UC-Berkeley to change
this drawback before the plan becomes operational
later this year.
