The gradual change in attitudes to
ward societal sex roles has been one of
the greatest effects of the women's
movement, according to Bernice San
dler, director of the Project on the Status
and Education of Women in
Washington, D C.
Sandler, brought here by the Center
for Research on Women (CROW),
spoke yesterday to about 75 persons,
mostly women.
"Sex discrimination is still an ac
cepted form of discrimination in this
country." However, she said "Great
progress has been made in the simple
acknowledgement that there is indeed a
problem."
Sandler said one of the most subtle
and pervasive types of sex discrimina
tion can be seen in the kinds of jobs

women continue to hold. She spoke
tongue-in-cheek of the ' Peter Principle"
— "men keep on being promoted until
they reach their highest level of incom
petence" — but said it is not applied
equally to women.
"Women are very seldom promoted
and tend quite often to be over-qualified
for the jobs they hold. They could reach
the same incompetence levels as men if
they were promoted at the same rate,"
she said.
Jobs still tend to be classified as
"male" and "female," Sandler said, and
the "female" jobs are generally routine,
low-paying and monotonous.
According to Sandler, women with col
lege educations cannot expect to en
counter less discrimination than their
uneducatedjgbubterparts.
"You're irrTdr a surprise if you think a

degree helps." she warned. Although
you will probably find a better job than an
uneducated woman could find, the me
dian income of women with B.A. de
grees is the same as that of male high
school graduates."
Women must continue to fight actively
for their rights, said Sandler. "The
changes will not come because they are
right, but because women fight for them.
Women are a new and powerful advo
cacy group, potentially the largest.
"Unlike blacks and other minorities,
who have always been aware of dis
crimination, it is fairly new for women in
large numbers to realize that they, too,
are being actively discriminated
against," she said.
Faced with discrimination, women
have four courses of action open tn

them, according to Sandler. ' They can
go elsewhere, though I don't think they
would avoid the discrimination; they can
become apathetic: they can have a real
revolution and hope something better
will emerge from the ashes; or they can
chip away bit by bit at all of the things that
need changing. - '
Sandler emphasized that the wo
men's movement is not a passing fad
Women, along with men who agree with
their goals, must work in full partnership
to change society s attitudes toward
women, she said.
' Women are now learning the politics
of change; they are learning the politics
of power," said Sandler. "Perhaps most
important, they are learning that t*
hand that rocks the cradle can indeed
rock the boat.''
