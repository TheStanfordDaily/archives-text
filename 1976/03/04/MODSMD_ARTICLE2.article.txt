# ASSU: political sandbox?
## 
### Mark Albertson Andrew Leuchter 
pring is coming. It's time for the sap to rise in trees, student
politicos to crawl out of the woodwork and the majority of
w--- students to ignore elections once again.
As elections for ASSU Council of Presidents (COP) approach,
the question arises of how much power and representation
students have in student government.
The COP and ASSU Senate are student elected, but low
turnouts in recent elections make their constituencies suspect.
"I don't think we represent any particular group,'' says COP
member Lee Rosenbaum. A similar feeling is expressed by Mike
Herman, ex-president of the ASSU, who feels that his council
represented all members of the university community, rather
than any particular group.
However, Larry Diamond, COP member in 1971, takes a
different view of student constituencies. While he was vice pres

ident, Diamond says he tried to act according to feelings he
picked up from students he talked to in dorms and classes.
Today, he sees many leaders in student government as "narrow
people interested in beefing up their credentials for graduate
school."
Sen. Bob Ottilie generally agrees with Diamond, but is much
more blunt in his criticism: "Most student representatives today
represent their own point of view, not the student bodys.
Diamond also feels that important changes have taken place
in the kinds of issues that student government is concerned with.
Issues such as university investments and women's rights have
now been replaced by "mascots and bonfires. We've got to be
more creative," says Diamond. He cites the quality of under
graduate education and student power in the University as
topics which the ASSU Senate and COP should deal with in
greater detail.
