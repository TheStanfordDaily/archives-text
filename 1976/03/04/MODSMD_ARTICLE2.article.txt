# ASSU: political sandbox?
## 
### Mark Albertson Andrew Leuchter 
pring is coming. It's time for the sap to rise in trees, student
politicos to crawl out of the woodwork and the majority of
w--- students to ignore elections once again.
As elections for ASSU Council of Presidents (COP) approach,
the question arises of how much power and representation
students have in student government.
The COP and ASSU Senate are student elected, but low
turnouts in recent elections make their constituencies suspect.
"I don't think we represent any particular group,'' says COP
member Lee Rosenbaum. A similar feeling is expressed by Mike
Herman, ex-president of the ASSU, who feels that his council
represented all members of the university community, rather
than any particular group.
However, Larry Diamond, COP member in 1971, takes a
different view of student constituencies. While he was vice pres

ident, Diamond says he tried to act according to feelings he
picked up from students he talked to in dorms and classes.
Today, he sees many leaders in student government as "narrow
people interested in beefing up their credentials for graduate
school."
Sen. Bob Ottilie generally agrees with Diamond, but is much
more blunt in his criticism: "Most student representatives today
represent their own point of view, not the student bodys.
Diamond also feels that important changes have taken place
in the kinds of issues that student government is concerned with.
Issues such as university investments and women's rights have
now been replaced by "mascots and bonfires. We've got to be
more creative," says Diamond. He cites the quality of under
graduate education and student power in the University as
topics which the ASSU Senate and COP should deal with in
greater detail.
Another big question is the
composition of student govern
ment and the seemingly endless
merry-go-round that goes on
among various politicos
According to Tom Price, a
member of last year s ASSU Se
nate. student government is
composed of a central cast of
characters who keep popping up
in key places. He points to a
small group of students who have
been involved with student gov
ernment since they were
freshmen or sophomores
These ASSU groupies,'' he
feels, travel from committees to
the senate to the COP and are
more concerned with their own
power interests than with the
wishes of the student community
However. COP member Char
lotte Germane disagrees. She
feels that this student core" is re
ally only a small minority citing
herself as an example for this be

lief Germane didn t become in
volved with student government
until her junior year.
Observers of ASSU politics
agree that the senate is the train
ing ground for ASSU politicians.
But the constant bickering that
has gone on among the senators
this year has caused many stu
dents to wonder if the senate
serves any purpose besides that
of training sandbox poiticians.
Herman thinks the senate is
largely useless.
"(I) would not be unalterably
opposed to seeing the senate
eliminated, he comments.
The senators themselves feel
that they do have a crucial role in
the University.
According to sophomore Sen
Carole Houck. the senate is sup
posed to "inject the students
voice into university decision
making." But. she complained,
for the most part we end up ap
proving decisions made either by

the financial manager or the vari
ous project managers."
Senators are almost unanim
ous in the belief that they are not
doing a good job The severest
critic from among the senate's
ranks is Ottilie
His major criticism of the senate
is what he calls its tendency to
legislate without thinking." He
claims that the senate has consis
tently debated, voted on and even
passed resolutions with little if any
research behind them.
One resolution which, to Ottilie.
demonstrates this "total lack of
preparation condemned the te
nure system.
It was incredible," according to
Ottilie Nine-tenths of the resolu
tion was spent condemning the
tenure system for all sorts of
reasons. Then it concluded that,
since we didn t know enough
about the system, we ought to
have Provost William Miller come
to the senate and explain the te

nure process to us."
Bill Tyndall. author of the resolu
tion, is the first to admit that it was
ill-founded.
"I really hadn't given it a great
deal of thought," Tyndall explains.
"It seemed like it needed to be
done."
The difficulties that he had in
drafting a cogent tenure state
ment. shed some light on the prob
lems any senator has in drafting
resolutions and legislation.
"I really didn't know where to go
(in the University administration)
to get more information. Also, I

was so busy keeping up with the
business of the senate in general
— and my research on the budget
in particular — that I didn't have
time to talk with much of anyone
about it. I only got feedback from
two or three senators before I in
troduced it."
Tyndall withdrew his resolution
shortly after the serate adopted it.
But this lack of research is only
one of several factors contributing
to the senate's impotence. A sec
ond problem is a lack of followup
work on resolutions which it
adopts.
"All we do now is pass a resolu
tion saying that we disagree with a
certain university policy,"' says
Houck.
"Our criticism is hardly ever
constructive — we offer the ad
ministration no alternatives. What
we need to do is somehow lobby
more for change.
Price agreed with this view,
summing up the senate s function
in university governance: "It pas
ses resolutions to send to Presi
dent (Richard) Lyman so he can
make paper airplanes out of
them.
A third cause for the senate's
foundering seems to be lack of
ieadership. Criticism in this area

focuses on Senate Chairman Bill
Hoke.
Ottilie, enthusiastic about
Hoke's overall performance, says
"I think he's doing a real good
job."
However, other senators were
lukewarm at best toward Hoke.
Kevin McDermott describes
Hoke's performance as
"adequate." Seth Foldy says that
Hoke "is very nice and tries hard.''
Many senators have specific
criticism of Hoke in his role as
chairman.
Tyndall contends that Hoke "is
not spending enough time outside
of the senate'' following up on its
action. Another senator claims
that Hoke "approaches the senate
with the attitude of a teacher" and
that "a lot of senators rankle under
that."
Hoke claims that at various

times this year, he has tried to
exercise a firmer leadership role in
the senate, but with no success.
"I had hoped we would make
moreprogressthis year, in making
the senate both more efficient and
more responsible. But the senate
did not want to be led in these
directions," he says.
Many senators say that fac
tionalism is another major prob
lem facing the senate. One former
senator goes so far as to say that
"factionalism is at the root of all
the senate's problems."
Senators agree that two fac
tions exist within the senate. One
apparently consists solely of Ot
ti'lie and McDermott, the second of
those six senators who were
elected to the senate as part of the
Students Taking A New Direction
(STAND) slate.
Both Foldy and Tyndall are
members of STAND. Tyndall
characterizes Ottilie and McDer
mott as "conservative," but has
tens to add that "there's really no
thing wrong with that."
Ottilie characterizes the
STAND contingent as "a bunch of
radicals."
Ottilie claims that the fac
tionalism in the Senate is quite se
vere. He contends that 90 to 95
percent of the time, the STAND
group votes together "on major
roll call votes." He also claims that
STAND senators frequently have
"conferences" before major
votes.
Tyndall denies that any collu
sion exists among the members of
STAND.
"Of course we vote together a
lot," responds Tyndall. "We have

a lot of the same views. But we
have split on many occasions."
Tyndall adds that 90 to 95 per
cent of the time, "an overwhelm
ing majority (of the 20 senators)
vote the same way," and that it is
only Ottilie and one or two other
senators who vote the other way.
McDermott claims the effects of
this factionalism are more subtle
than overt collusion. He contends
that the major effect of the fac
tionalism is that some senators
ignore a point of view simply be

cause of the senator that prop
osed it.
The senate has made a few at
tempts to solve its problems — the
latest being an informal meeting
sponsored by Houck. She says
that although no specific action
was taken, she feels that the dis
cussion among the senators did
succeed in pinpointing many of
the senate's problems.
Whether the gap between pin
pointing and solving problems will
be bridged remains to be seen.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION—ASSU Sen. Laura Best pauses for a glance through 'Campus Report'
during debate at a senate meeting. Many students complain that the senate spends most of its time
doing just that — pausing.
