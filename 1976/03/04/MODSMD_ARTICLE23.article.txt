Africans on war footing
MAPUTO, Mozambique — The re
volutionary Marxist government of Mozam
bique closed its 800-mile border with
white-ruled Rhodesia yesterday and put the
nation on a war footing.
President Samora Machel announced
the closure of the frontier in a radio broad
cast from the presidential palace and said
all Rhodesian property and assets here
would be seized
Machel, whose country provides
sanctuary to thousands of black Rhodesian
guerrillas fighting the regime of Prime
Minister lan Smith, said a "state of war"
exists with Rhodesia and urged the coun
try's 8.5 million people to begin building air
raid shelters.
The Ministry of Information later said
Machel had not declared war but simply put
the nation on a war footing. The move fol
lows a "hot pursuit" raid into Mozambique
last week by Rhodesian troops chasing
guerrillas. Machel called the raid "an act of
war."
Machel said communications with
Rhodesia would be cut and declared that
his country was applying full economic
sanctions to the landlocked former British
colony.
Well-placed sources here viewed the
move as a saber-rattling gesture rather
than a signal for all-out shooting war.
Lockheed payoffs 'rumor'
WASHINGTON — Lockheed Board
Chairman Robert Haack said yesterday the
firm has minimal conclusive information
identifying Japanese government officials
who received bribes to promote Lockheed

airplane sales in Japan.
Haack's testimony before a Senate Bank
ing Committee hearing raised doubts about
how responsive the U.S. government can
be to a Japanese request for information on
which Japanese officials received Loc
kheed payoffs.
Testifying before a standing-room crowd
that included about 50 Japanese corres
pondents, Haack described Lockheed's
documentation on the Japan payoffs with
words like "rumor," "hearsay," "gossip ' and
fragmentary information."
But he said that he personally would be
willing to provide relevant information to the
Japanese government as long as it is sub
ject to proper review, that all inconclusive
data is eliminated, that it is made available
on a government-to-government basis and
that "all safeguards can be assured."
Meanwhile in Tokyo, a big Japanese trad
ing firm trying to repair an image hurt by the
Lockheed payoffs scandal shuffled its top
executives yesterday and said it would not
do any new business with Lockheed.
Hiro Hiyama. board chairman of Maru
beni Corp., said he was resigning "to take
responsibility'' for Marubeni's coming under
public criticism, but Marubeni officials said
this did not mean the company was in
volved in alleged payoffs by Lockheed Air
craft Corp.

SLA evidence 'admissible'
SAN FRANCISCO — The prosecution
claimed yesterday that Patricia Hearst, by
her dramatic witness stand disavowal of
two fugitive companions, forfeited her right
to suppress evidence taken from their last
hideout.
U.S. District Judge Oliver Carter admit
ted the government had raised a perplexing
question, but said he would hear extensive
testimony at a hearing without the jury pre
sent before he ruled on Hearst's rights in
the matter.
At issue were the "Tania Interview" and
other incriminating documents seized in an
FBI raid of Symbionese Liberation Army
(SLA) members William and Emily Har
rises' house.
The most important document seized
was the manuscnpt for a book chapter ti
tled, "Tania Interview." Hearst has admit
ted writing parts of it but told jurors she was
forced. The government portrayed the writ
ings as proof of her allegiance to the SLA.
Meanwhile in Los Angeles, the judge in
the Harris' case ruled that evidence from
codefendant Patricia Hearst's hideout was
legally obtained and admissible.
Judge Mark Brandler ruled Monday that
evidence obtained from the Harrises' San
Francisco apartment could not be admitted
at their trial on kidnap, assault and robbery
charges because FBI agents did not have
search warrants when they seized it.

He noted yesterday, however, that
agents did have warrants when they ar
rested Hearst and Wendy Yoshimura in
their apartment Sept. 18.
Because there was a federal arms viola
tion warrant out against Hearst at the time
of her arrest, Brandler said there
were exigent circumstances that permitted
agents to go through the apartment without
a search warrant.
Secret accords denied
WASHINGTON — Despite White House
insistence that "nothing was kept secret" in
the Sinai accords, several members of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee said
yesterday they knew nothing of agree
ments described by Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat.
Sadat told a weekend news conference
there were three "secret agreements.' He
said the United States guaranteed that Is
rael would not attack Syria, pledged to do all
it could to see that the Palestinians would
have a role in any settlement, and vowed to
try to bring about another disengagement
agreement on the Syrian front.
Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield
(D-Mont.), a member of the Foreign Rela
tions Committee, said: "We were told there
were no secret agreements."
Mansfield said he thought the panel
ought to investigate the matter. He said the
committee staff ought to "make appropriate
inquiries at the State Department."
