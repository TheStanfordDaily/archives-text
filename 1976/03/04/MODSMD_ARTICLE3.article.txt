## Viewpoint 'Daily' class 
### 
In order to attempt to improve our services to the Univer
sity community, the Daily is undertaking a SCIRE research
project which will examine various editorial and business
aspects of the publication.
The course is open to all students (though class size will
be limited) for three units of credit spring quarter. Hopefully,
many people working on the project will be non-Daily per
sonnel.
Research will focus on three general areas:
—long-range financing prospects;
—short-range financial considerations;
—editorial content and community satisfaction.
The group examining long-range finances will primarily
focus on the possibility of implementing an endowment
fund, and alternative subscription methods to fee assess
ments.
Those working on short-range financial considerations
will determine advertiser sentiment toward special issues,
theme pages (such as restaurant reviews) and reaction to
possible rate increases. This group will also consider the
feasibility of an increased market and the effect of our
advertising policy.
A survey of student, faculty and staff opinion about the
quality and content of the Daily will be carried out by those
working on the third part of the project. This group will also
examine community satisfaction with Daily features such as
Thursday. comics, "Bug Me," book reviews, etc.
All class members will be responsible for a segment of a
final report, summarizing the data collected and making
recommendations to next year's staff.
There will be an informal meeting Tuesday, Mar. 9, 7:30
p.m. at the Daily office for those interested in the project.
Anyone who would like to take the course or has any ques
tions about it should contact Mark Simonian or me at 497-
4632.
