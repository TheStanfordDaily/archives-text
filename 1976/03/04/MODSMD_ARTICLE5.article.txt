Info on S.l
Few know exactly what S.l is
partly because it's hard to get a
copy. I've been on the waiting list
(of one California senator) for
months.
S.l could have more impact on
American political life than any law
since the adoption of the Bill of
Rights, moving initiative away
from grass roots and into official
backrooms. So crucial a choice
should be aired to public debate,
but S.l was quietly shepherded
for years and is almost impossible
for non-specialists to understand.

In the Feb. 24 Daily article on
environmental statistics, Tim
Greene, a graduate student in
statistics, was quoted as saying
there are no undergraduates
majoring in statistics. I wish to re
ctify this error.
Currently there are five under
graduates in the Statistics De
partment. Greene's mistake is
understandable, though, and it is
likely a majority of the statistics
professors would make the same
mistake considering the lack of at
tention paid to undergraduates in
the department.

Farcical trial
Before we get carried away with

the lurid press coverage of the
Patty Hearst adventure, we
should take a look at the likely re
sults of the trial.
I don't know whether Hearst is
guilty of anything, and I don't par
ticularly know if it matters. If
Hearst is acquitted, everyone will
be convinced she is guilty and got
off because she is rich and had the
most devious lawyer in the coun
try.
If she is convicted, then most
will be convinced that after all the

criminal justice works for rich
people as well, and hooray, the
great American system works for
everyone.
I think that the whole situation is
a farce, making millions for the F.
Lee Baileys, the Steven Weeds
and the media. It conceals the
ideology behind the entire func
tioning of the criminal ' justice"
system.
