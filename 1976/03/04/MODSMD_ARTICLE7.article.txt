Two slates yesterday declared
their candidacy for this spring's
ASSU Council of Presidents

The slate of Dan Howard, Keith
Archuleta, Liz Ryll and Bill Tyndall
declared early last night. The slate
of Vic Petroff,Carole Houck, Deric
Jennings and Al Tomaszczuk de
clared later last night.
Howard, a junior in biology,
leads his slate. He cited his work
on the ASSU Nominations Com
mittee and on the University
Committee on Public Events as
qualifications.
He also coauthored the "How
ard Report'' on University admis
sions and financial aid. released
last fall.
Archuleta, a junior in communi
cations and psychology, has
served as vice president of the
Black Students Union, managing
editor of the Real News, and has
worked at KZSU. He resigned
Tuesday from the chairmanship of
the Stanford Daily Board of Direc
tors.
He has also been a SWOPSI
course leader and a member of
the University Committee on Re
search.
Ryll, a first-year graduate stu
dent in economics, is an ASSU
senator and was involved in stu
dent government and faculty
committees at her undergraduate
alma mater, Smith College.
Qualifications
Tyndall, a junior in American
Studies,is also an ASSU senator,
and has served on the Guest Pro
fessorship Board and on the Uni
versity Budget Committee.
He presently is the student
coordinator for the David Harris
for Congress Committee.
The Howard slate members
said their slate's philosophy calls
for greater student involvement
and fostering a sense of "com
munity" among students. Student
involvement means "students
should have a lot more control
over the University," Tyndall said.
Student complacency
Howard said students have lost
control over University actions af
fecting them and blamed student
complacency for this loss of con
trol.
The Howard slate also em
phasized that is it realistic about
the COP s potential power. The
members realize that it is "really
hard'' to accomplish change and
that their plans may not work out.
Archuleta said.
He said the present COP falls
under this criticism, chiefly be

cause "they weren't realistic
about what they could accomplish
within a year."
Petroff slate
Petroff, a junior in economics, is
a former director of the ASSU Lec
ture Note Service and a past
ASSU senator. He is also a former
member of the University Commit
tee on Public Events.
Houck, a sophomore in art de
sign, is also an ASSU senator and
a member on both the senate's
Select Committee on the Budget
and the University Committee on
Public Events.
Jennings, who did his under
graduate work at Harvard, is a
graduate student in economics
and an ASSU senator. He is also
chairman of the Graduate Student
Council and the president of
Economic Graduate Students' A
ssociation.
Tomaszczuk, a junior ininterna
tional relations, is a Resident As
sociate in Madera House. He is a
former member of the University
Committee on Services to Stu
dents and was an ASSU alternate
senator last year.
Petroff said last night "our posi

tion in this campaign is that we re
in the middle road with a leaning to
the left of center "
Petroff had not yet heard of the
Howard slate's declaration, but
said he suspected there would be
one slate from the Alliance for
Radical Change and another from
the right wing of the ASSU Se
nate.
"We hope to accomplish more
than the other slates because our
tactics are different â€” pressure
campaigns and pressure tactics
don't work too well," Petroff said.
Petroff, discussing his slate's
qualifications, said "We're all ex
perienced in dealing with the ad
ministrators who make deci
sions."
