## Teaching a factor for tenure 
### William Ross 
Pespite recent denials of tenure
to teachers rated as outstanding,
teaching quality is still a major fac
tor in tenure decisions, Provost
William Miller said on KZSU last
night.
"This is an institution that tries
to provide a balance between re
search and teaching," Miller said.
"We believe that we are doing this
well."
Responding to questions from a
student panel and listeners who
phoned the station, Miller noted
that some professors have been
denied tenure because of in
adequate teaching ability.
According to Miller. Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Halsey
Royden is currently studying the
feasibility of establishing a for
malized system for evaluating
teachers.
Varying procedures
Meanwhile, teaching evaluation
is left to individual departments,
where procedures vary widely, he
said.
Miller noted that the ASSU
Course Guide could become an
aid in evaluating teaching, but that
many faculty members would ob
ject to using only one method of
evaluation.
The process is not as simple
as it's generally thought," Miller
said. "There is much inquiry when
there is a question about (a tenure
candidate's) teaching qualifica
tions."
Miller acknowledged that in
order to publish enough material
to merit tenure, junior faculty
members must limit the time they
spend with students.
But he contended that they still
have ample time to devote to
teaching and advising.

Miller contended that emphasis
on research eventually improves
teaching quality.
"There is a dichotomy between
the short-run benefits of teaching
and the long-run benefits of scho
larship," Miller said. "It is impor
tant to have students in both a re
search environment and a teach
ing environment. The advantages
of research do extend down to un
dergraduates."
A talented researcher is usually
able to bring more knowledge of
his subject area to the classroom
and is better able to guide a stu
dent's own research, he added.
"Scholarship is an investment
in the future." Miller said. "To neg
lect it is unfair to faculty members
and to future students."
Increased pressure
Miller suggested that tenure
pressure here might have in
creased in recent years because
of the decrease in available jobs
elsewhere and a decrease in new
tenured posts available here.
Although nearly 45 percent of
assistant professors received te
nure at the height of the Universi
ty's expansion several years ago.
only about 30 percent get tenure
now. he said.
But Miller said he does not be
lieve tenure pressure here is any
greater than it is at other major
universities.
Miller contended that the
growth in tenure pressure has not
discouraged outstanding young
scholars from seeking jobs here.
Appeal process
In instances where a professor
believes that a tenure denial was
unfair, he can enter an appeals
process and take his case all the
way to the president. Miller said.
Miller said that two tenure de

nials during the past five years
have been reversed by the upper
level administrators.
He noted that the adminis
trators do not hear the cases de
novo (from the very start), but
rather try to determine whether
certain pertinent information was
omitted from the original delibera
tions if there was a procedural ir
regularity.
No system is going to be error
free," Miller said. We should
work toward improvement. A sys
tem that relies on taste and judg

ment is going to have to be
critiqued continually
He said that in response to
complaints from some professors
denied tenure that persons who
deliberated on their case were un
informed about what constituted
superior scholarship in their field,
the University now is trying to bet
ter coordinate communication be
tween departments and the Ap
pointments and Promotions
Committee, which makes final de
cisions on tenure appealable to

Pespite recent denials of tenure
to teachers rated as outstanding,
teaching quality is still a major fac
tor in tenure decisions, Provost
William Miller said on KZSU last
night.
"This is an institution that tries
to provide a balance between re
search and teaching," Miller said.
"We believe that we are doing this
well."
Responding to questions from a
student panel and listeners who
phoned the station, Miller noted
that some professors have been
denied tenure because of in
adequate teaching ability.
According to Miller. Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Halsey
Royden is currently studying the
feasibility of establishing a for
malized system for evaluating
teachers.
Varying procedures
Meanwhile, teaching evaluation
is left to individual departments,
where procedures vary widely, he
said.
Miller noted that the ASSU
Course Guide could become an
aid in evaluating teaching, but that
many faculty members would ob
ject to using only one method of
evaluation.
The process is not as simple
as it's generally thought," Miller
said. "There is much inquiry when
there is a question about (a tenure
candidate's) teaching qualifica
tions."
Miller acknowledged that in
order to publish enough material
to merit tenure, junior faculty
members must limit the time they
spend with students.
But he contended that they still
have ample time to devote to
teaching and advising.

Miller contended that emphasis
on research eventually improves
teaching quality.
"There is a dichotomy between
the short-run benefits of teaching
and the long-run benefits of scho
larship," Miller said. "It is impor
tant to have students in both a re
search environment and a teach
ing environment. The advantages
of research do extend down to un
dergraduates."
A talented researcher is usually
able to bring more knowledge of
his subject area to the classroom
and is better able to guide a stu
dent's own research, he added.
"Scholarship is an investment
in the future." Miller said. "To neg
lect it is unfair to faculty members
and to future students."
Increased pressure
Miller suggested that tenure
pressure here might have in
creased in recent years because
of the decrease in available jobs
elsewhere and a decrease in new
tenured posts available here.
Although nearly 45 percent of
assistant professors received te
nure at the height of the Universi
ty's expansion several years ago.
only about 30 percent get tenure
now. he said.
But Miller said he does not be
lieve tenure pressure here is any
greater than it is at other major
universities.
Miller contended that the
growth in tenure pressure has not
discouraged outstanding young
scholars from seeking jobs here.
Appeal process
In instances where a professor
believes that a tenure denial was
unfair, he can enter an appeals
process and take his case all the
way to the president. Miller said.
Miller said that two tenure de

nials during the past five years
have been reversed by the upper
level administrators.
He noted that the adminis
trators do not hear the cases de
