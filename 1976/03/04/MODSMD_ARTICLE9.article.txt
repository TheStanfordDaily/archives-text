# Shaskey announces party primary bid
## 
### Roy S. Johnson 
Mountain View attorney Nor
man Shaskey yesterday an
nounced his candidacy for the
12th District congressional seat
held by Rep. Paul McCloskey. Jr.,
a Republican
Shaskey,a Democrat, said he
decided to run because he be
lieves "Congressman McCloskey
has shirked his responsibilities to
the people."
He reported that McCloskey's
attendance record on the House
floor has been four percent below
average, "which is inconsistent
with the fact that he voted in favor
of a pay raise bill for all con
gressmen that was hurried
through without a public hearing
In the primary electionShaskey
will face fellow Democrat and
former ASSU President David
Harris.
Shaskey said he believes, how
ever, that Harris does not have the

"broad support Shaskey has and
that Harris would make a very
weak showing against McCloskey
in the November general election
When I ran for membership to
the governing board ot Foothill-De
Anza Community College Dis
trict," Shaskey said, "I received
nearly 29.000 votes, the most
ever cast for a trustee of the col
leges."
Shaskey said his other qualifica
tions include membership in sev
eral national and local profes
sional and conservation groups
On national issues.Shaskeysaid
Congress must concentrate on
three key problems" in the next
few years: energy, unemploy
ment and food
Lobbying disclosure
He said he will push for disclo
sure of lobbyists expenditures and
for reforms of congressional cam
paign financing so that the
money raised in each district
would remain within that district."
Shaskey said he favors ending
the foreign tax credit presently
claimed by many corporations
paying taxes to other countries.
On unemployment, Shaskey
said he will promote job-sharing
and a "less-tax" incentive offering
tax breaks to companies which in
itiate programs to hire the un
employed.
He said he will propose a con
stitutional amendment creating
national referendums every four
years, in which "citizens could
enact legislation or repeal con
gressional actions" through ap
proving initiatives similar to those
presently used in California and
other states.
