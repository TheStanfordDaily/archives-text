# Preliminary frat plan distributed
## 
### Stephen Crolius 
A preliminary draft of next year's
regulations governing fraternities has
been given to fraternity house presi
dents, according to Asst. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Norm Robinson.
The new regulations are almost
identical to last year's rules.
Inter-Fraternity (IFC) President Bob
Ottilie charged that the new regula
tions "ignore many of the major prob
lems of fraternities."
He noted that fraternities have never
agreed to the section on accomodating
a greater number of people in a house
than its rated occupancy specifies,
contending that "this is something
that was never clarified originally
when we voluntarily agreed to this
plan a year ago."
"Now its been put in at the last mi
nute," he protested.
The new regulations state that over
crowding will be permitted next year
"to house all old members" — those
not covered by the Guaranteed Hous
ing Plan — but will be prohibited
hereafter.
Ottilie's other major objection was to
the lack of provision for fraternity sys
tem growth. "They (the University)
have made no provision to determine
an unmet demand ratio (although) the
actual demand for fraternities is much
greater than what the quota is" he said.
Includedintheregulationsis the cal
culation of the so-called fair share
quota — the total number of sopho
more equivalents that must be ac
comodated bythe fraternity system.
A sophomore equivalent is defined
by the preliminary draft of the new
regulations as "a student who is enti
tled to, but has yet to use, his two
guaranteed years of housing."
The fraternity quota for 1976-77 is
234 sophomore equivalents, down
from 262 last year. The decrease in the
quota is accounted for by this year's
smaller freshman class (1502 as com
pared with 1540 last year) and an in
crease from 10 to 11 percent in the
estimate of the number of non
freshman who want to live off campus.
A clause has been added providing
for the exclusion from the IFC of any
house which refuses to cooperate with
the IFC's Rush Committee, designed to
prevent more popular houses from
hurting smaller houses during the
spring rush.
Excluded houses "will be consi
dered as independent entities by the
University and must meet or exceed
their quotas or they will be put on
notice," according to the regulations.
A house may be put on notice — and
face the possibility of incorporation
into the housing system — if it misses
its quota by more than 10 percent for
three out of four consecutive years or if
it is the house with the greatest deficit
in the fraternity system if that system
misses its quota for two consecutive
years.

from 262 last year. The decrease in the
quota is accounted for by this year's
smaller freshman class (1502 as com
pared with 1540 last year) and an in
crease from 10 to 11 percent in the
estimate of the number of non
freshman who want to live off campus.
A clause has been added providing
for the exclusion from the IFC of any
house which refuses to cooperate with
the IFC's Rush Committee, designed to
prevent more popular houses from
hurting smaller houses during the
spring rush.
Excluded houses "will be consi
dered as independent entities by the
University and must meet or exceed
their quotas or they will be put on
notice," according to the regulations.
A house may be put on notice — and
face the possibility of incorporation
into the housing system — if it misses
its quota by more than 10 percent for
three out of four consecutive years or if
it is the house with the greatest deficit
in the fraternity system if that system
misses its quota for two consecutive
years.

A preliminary draft of next year's
regulations governing fraternities has
been given to fraternity house presi
dents, according to Asst. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Norm Robinson.
The new regulations are almost
identical to last year's rules.
Inter-Fraternity (IFC) President Bob
Ottilie charged that the new regula
tions "ignore many of the major prob
lems of fraternities."
He noted that fraternities have never
agreed to the section on accomodating
a greater number of people in a house
than its rated occupancy specifies,
contending that "this is something
that was never clarified originally
when we voluntarily agreed to this
plan a year ago."
"Now its been put in at the last mi
nute," he protested.
The new regulations state that over
crowding will be permitted next year
"to house all old members" — those
not covered by the Guaranteed Hous
ing Plan — but will be prohibited
hereafter.
Ottilie's other major objection was to
the lack of provision for fraternity sys
tem growth. "They (the University)
have made no provision to determine
an unmet demand ratio (although) the
actual demand for fraternities is much
greater than what the quota is" he said.
Includedintheregulationsis the cal
culation of the so-called fair share
quota — the total number of sopho
more equivalents that must be ac
comodated bythe fraternity system.
A sophomore equivalent is defined
by the preliminary draft of the new
regulations as "a student who is enti
tled to, but has yet to use, his two
guaranteed years of housing."
The fraternity quota for 1976-77 is
234 sophomore equivalents, down
from 262 last year. The decrease in the
quota is accounted for by this year's
smaller freshman class (1502 as com
pared with 1540 last year) and an in
crease from 10 to 11 percent in the
estimate of the number of non
freshman who want to live off campus.
