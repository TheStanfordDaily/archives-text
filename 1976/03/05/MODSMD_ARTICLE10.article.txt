# Letters: Dollies, Hearst

### 
Dollie tryouts
In regard to Kathryn Jane
Tucker's letter in the Mar. 2
Daily concerning "sexism at
Maples," we would like to
clarify the conflict in scheduling
and respond to the derogatory
characterization of Dollies pre
sented in her letter.
We contacted Physical Educa
tion Director Wesley Kuff of the
intramural office the week of Jan.
12 to reserve Maples Pavilion for
the annual Dolly tryouts. As bas
ketball intramurals filled the
schedule for the next month, the
only time block available was on
Wednesday, Feb. 25, from 6 p.m.
to 9 p.m. This was far from ideal;
among other conflicts it delayed
interviews until 1 a.m., but we
were forced to accept. This was
the only time allowed us.
We were also sorry that the
women's IMbasketball team suf
fered from the scheduling error.
However, Tucker's references to
Dollies as "made-up manikin
exhibitionists" and "cattle at a
county fair" were irrelevant to
her protest. They reflect an into
lerant attitude toward the free

dom of self-expression.
Women's interests and pur
suits will vary, but each deserves
mutual respect. We do not pin a
"jockette" image on those
women who enjoy playing bas
ketball (something we do also),
and it seems narrow-minded and
resentful to abuse those of us
who enjoy dancing and par
ticipating in Stanford sports
from the sidelines.
Tucker refers to Dollies as "the
stereotypical American dream."
P'or us, it is just one area of par
ticipation at Stanford. By con
tinuing to label and stereotype,
Tucker is only prolonging the
battle against sexism which she
claims to be fighting.

Ethical code
I read Bob Rowen's Mar. 2
Daily column on Patricia
Hearst's responsibility for her al
leged crimes (as it was her own
weak psyche that was
brainwashed?) with a great deal
of horror.
My own ethical code has its
roots in the peace movements of
the 1960s and places love and
understanding (which implies
forgiveness) among the higher
traits to which an individual can
strive to attain.
Rowen's own lack of insight
into the fallibility of human be
ings under incredible stress
leads me to hope that he will
never meet such a harsh judge of
human character should his own
ego ever be responsible for a
dreadful error.
His article indicates the total
inflexibility and spiritual inhibi
tion with which this society ap
proaches the concepts of love
and responsibility. These
shortcomings lead most people
to fail to really understand either
love or responsibility.
