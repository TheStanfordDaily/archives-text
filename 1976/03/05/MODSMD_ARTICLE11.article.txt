# Alcohol worse than marijuana
## 
### 
Stephen Taylor

In a surprising turn-around
and after five years of assuring us
otherwise, the government's top
official on drug abuse now con
cludes that marijuana isn't as
dangerous to one's health as
either alcohol or tobacco.
At a news conference last
week, Robert DuPont, head of
the National Institute on Drug
Abuse, admitted "there is no
question that alcohol and to
bacco are causing us far more
problems than marijuana does."
Whereas DuPont had previ-'
ously avoided such comparisons
in the past, he even went further
and stated, "Personally, my view
is that we do not need to threaten
young people with imprison
ment to discourage use of
marijuana."
This official realization has
evolved slowly to this point. It
began a few years ago when this
same group finally admitted
what most of us already knew —
that the fabled marijuana-heroin
link was "weak."
Eye to eye
Now they are finally coming
eye to eye with the public and
admitting what was obvious to
many young people in the first
place — a joint is nothing com
pared to a pint of bourbon; being
"stoned" isn't as bad as being
."drunk."
Of course, DuPont emphasizes
that neither of the three favorite
"recreational drugs" (as he re
fers to them) is safe. It is just that
marijuana lacks the "lethal ef
fects" of either booze or cigaret
teS' , r 4
But for many of us in our age'
group who grew up with the
"Reefer Madness"-type of prop
aganda in our elementary and
high school days, this admission
may be a little too late.
Discouraged by authority to
smoke marijuana, yet encour
aged by our peers to be "social,"
the majority of our generation
became involved to a greater de
gree in liquor than in grass.
The effect can be seen today in
a good friend of mine, whom I
shall refer to as "Bill."
Bill did just what his parents,
and teachers told him to do. He
stayed away from "dope" and
his "pot head" schoolmates.
Gin and vodka
I saw him recently at a party,
sucking on a glass rim and drunk
to the gills. His cup runneth over
with equal amounts of gin and
vodka, no ice.
In the course of our conversa
tion, I asked him if he had finally
relented and tried smoking
marijuana.
He looked at me with dead
seriousness and replied, "No. I
never have and I never will. I
don't wanna be no addict."
I have yet to meet a marijuana
addict.and I truly doubt I ever
will
But I have met Bill, who ended
up later that night face down on
the floor.
A revealing series in the San
Jose Mercury by Alton Blakeslee
and Brian Sullivan noted that
this contemporary opinion that
booze is safer still pervades in
our country, thanks to au
thorities backhanded blessing of
alcohol over marijuana.
With Dul'ont's admission that
liquor is more serious than the
dreaded devil weed, it is now up
to the government to begin en
lightening the populace.
Maybe then we can know of
fewer friends like Bill.

high school days, this admission
may be a little too late.
Discouraged by authority to
smoke marijuana, yet encour
aged by our peers to be "social,"
the majority of our generation
became involved to a greater de
gree in liquor than in grass.
The effect can be seen today in
a good friend of mine, whom I
shall refer to as "Bill."
Bill did just what his parents,
and teachers told him to do. He
stayed away from "dope" and
his "pot head" schoolmates.
Gin and vodka
I saw him recently at a party,
sucking on a glass rim and drunk
to the gills. His cup runneth over
with equal amounts of gin and
vodka, no ice.
In the course of our conversa
tion, I asked him if he had finally
relented and tried smoking
marijuana.
He looked at me with dead
seriousness and replied, "No. I
never have and I never will. I
don't wanna be no addict."
I have yet to meet a marijuana
addict.and I truly doubt I ever
will
But I have met Bill, who ended
up later that night face down on
the floor.
A revealing series in the San
Jose Mercury by Alton Blakeslee
and Brian Sullivan noted that
this contemporary opinion that
booze is safer still pervades in
our country, thanks to au
thorities backhanded blessing of
alcohol over marijuana.
With Dul'ont's admission that
liquor is more serious than the
dreaded devil weed, it is now up
to the government to begin en
lightening the populace.
Maybe then we can know of
fewer friends like Bill.

In a surprising turn-around
and after five years of assuring us
otherwise, the government's top
official on drug abuse now con
cludes that marijuana isn't as
dangerous to one's health as
either alcohol or tobacco.
At a news conference last
week, Robert DuPont, head of
the National Institute on Drug
Abuse, admitted "there is no
question that alcohol and to
bacco are causing us far more
problems than marijuana does."
Whereas DuPont had previ-'
ously avoided such comparisons
in the past, he even went further
and stated, "Personally, my view
is that we do not need to threaten
young people with imprison
ment to discourage use of
marijuana."
This official realization has
evolved slowly to this point. It
began a few years ago when this
same group finally admitted
what most of us already knew —
that the fabled marijuana-heroin
link was "weak."
Eye to eye
Now they are finally coming
eye to eye with the public and
admitting what was obvious to
many young people in the first
place — a joint is nothing com
pared to a pint of bourbon; being
"stoned" isn't as bad as being
."drunk."
Of course, DuPont emphasizes
that neither of the three favorite
"recreational drugs" (as he re
fers to them) is safe. It is just that
marijuana lacks the "lethal ef
fects" of either booze or cigaret

But for many of us in our age'
group who grew up with the
"Reefer Madness"-type of prop
aganda in our elementary and
high school days, this admission
may be a little too late.
