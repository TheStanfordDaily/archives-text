# Secretary sues professor
## Assault case not yet settled 
### Bert Bower 
The University's final decision to fine and
place on probation Psychiatry and Psychology
Prof. Karl Pribram for his alleged assault and
beating of his personal secretary has drawn
mixed reactions from parties close to the inci
dent.
Barbara Honegger, Pribram's former secret
ary, called theaction "nothing morethana slap
on the hand" and will continue with her four
count civil suit against Pribram in which she is
asking $25,000 in general damages, $25,000 in
punitive damages, $47.35 in medical costs and
the costs of the lawsuit.
"A cou rt date has not been set yet because we
/ill are in a process of collecting evidence,"
Honegger's lawyer, Jim VVolpman,said. He ad
ded, "1 suspect that later in the spring a trial
date will be set."
Meanwhile, Pribram's lawyer, Leon Shields,
has filed an affirmative defense which con
tends that Honegger provoked the attack. The
defense reads in part:
* "The defense alleges the conduct of the
plaintiff to have been so exasperatng as to con
stitute sufficient provocation tor any of the al
leged acts of the defendant."
Settling out of court?
Shields, however, said Pribram hopes the
issue won't proceed to a court hearing.
"Dr. Pribram continues to remain hopeful
Inat the mutual unpleasantness and misun
derstandings of the past between him and Bar
bara Honegger can be forgotten and that she
can begin to put the episode into a proper
perspective," Shields said. "Regretfully, she
seems unable to do this."
Shields also said that Pribram's settlement
• vith the University which placed him onatwo
year probation and cut his salary by $3,000 this
year was an attempt to give Pribram "some
peace of mind both with regard to the Univer
sity and to Honegger."
Uneasiness lingers
But neither Pribram norHoneggerseemstobe
enjoying much peace of mind over the con
'poversey.
Shields said Pribram is sorry Honegger be
lieved it ii.. essary to humiliate him publicly
and to cause him embarrassment over an inci
dent that could have been resolved privately.
Honegger, however, says the University's
settlement with Pribram did not go far enough
to protect others from possible future
abuses by Pribram.
"The president's decision addresses only a
single incident of assault and battery," she
said. "It completely ignores a history of as
sault."
She has reactivated her assault and battery
grievance with the University and hopes that a
hearing of her case wi 11 prove that further "cor
fective ations" against Pribram need to be im
plemented.
What Honegger wants
Her assault and battery grievance recom
mends such corrective measures as:
—not allowing Pribram sole supervision of
any employe;

—arranging his office so that employes
working under him don't have to interact alone
with him;
—informing all present, future or prospec
tive employes of Pribram about the alleged
beating and the incidents leading up to the
event.
Shields doesn't believe, however, that the
results of Honegger's second hearing should
affect his client.
"I would consider the imposition by the
University against Pribram of any so-called
corrective measures to be a direct violation of
the settlement which was reached with the
University," he said.
But Legal Adviser to the President James
Siena said that "corrective measures are not
ruled out by the settlement."
Doors still open
He said he did not want to "predict the out
come of Honegger's grievance hearing" but
added that the University's settlement "did not
rule out what Honegger is asking for" in her
assault and battery grievance.
In addition to conflicting opinions about
possible corrective measures, disagreement
exists over the meaning of the University's set
tlement with Pribram.
"I look at the settlement as if it were an ad
mission of guilt by Pribram," Honegger said.
She defended her position by noting that the
Statement on Faculty Discipline allowed Prib
ram the right to defend himself against her
charges,and he "chose not to defend himself."

But Shields contends the settlement was not
an admission of guilt.
"Dr. Pribram reached a settlement with Stan
ford in order to avoid a formal proceeding
which would have been disruptive of the lives
of a number of other people who would neces
sarily have been called as witnesses," Shields
said.
Whether or not the University's settlement
with Pribram can be considered an admission
of guilt, however, is a question that neither side
has the power to decide — the ultimate deci
sion will be made by the courts.
