# Student judicial changes may be imminent
## 
### Lori Matsukawa 
Relatively few students find themselves
faced with the prospect of judicial discipline
for breaking the University Honor Code or by
laws.
However, for the sake of the rare cases, when
students do face reviews before the Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC), Council of Presidents
Vice President Charlotte Germane is
spearheading a drive she hopes will insure fair
student representation with the judicial sys
tem.
Germane is circulating a petition calling for
the convening of the Committee of Fifteen
(C-15) to consider amending procedural and
selection processes of the SJC and the Student
Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC).
The Stanford judicial system can be roughly
divided between the SCLC.the body that makes
rules for student conduct, and the SJC which
tries those who break the rules. The SJC, ac
cording to Chairman Jonathan Casper, reviews
about 15 cases annually.
"This year the SJC has heard one case," said
Assoc. Prof. Jonathan Casper, chairman of the
SJC.
"Students have the option of going before
the SJC or before the Dean of Students (James
Lyons). If they go before the Dean, they are
required to plead guilty.

"He's seen maybe 10-15 cases," said Casper.
Casper indicated that most of them were prob
ably Honor Code violations.
"In Honor Code cases, I have noticed that
students choose not to go before the SJC where
there is a student majority. Students have the
option (to be judged by their peers) but they
don't choose to exercise it," said Casper.
Lyons agreed, noting that in all recent cases,
students have chosen to appear before him
rather than the SJC.
"The SCLC is a legislative body that sets the
laws," said William Stone, assistant to the
President, "and the SJC hears the cases and
determines if you're guilty or not."
The petition's first proposal recommends
that the three students on the SCLC be ap
pointed to their post by the ASSU Nominations
Committee instead of by a student body elec
tion as mandated in the Legislative and Judi
cial Charter of 1968.
Committee in a coma
"This year no one ran because many stu
dents were not aware of the positions,"
explained Germane. "And the SCLC hadn't
met in five years. No one knew what was going
on."
Germane added that special elections (for
such positions) cost about $200 each.
"It's just easier and more economic to select

students through the Nominations Commit
tee," Germane said.
The second proposal asks that there be a
majority of students present during case re
views of both Honor Code and "other" viola
tions.
The SJC consists of three student members,
three faculty members and two Chairpersons,
one a faculty member and the other a law
school student. The student chairperson cur
rently presides over the votes to break ties in
Honor Code hearings while the faculty chair
person presides over and votes to break ties in
all other cases.
Student crimes
"These 'other cases' are small internal prob
lems against the school like vandalism, theft,
maybe the misuse of a computer, anything that
could be taken to a downtown court (to be
tried)," Stone said.
"We feel that students should be allowed to
have a majority in both(kinds of) x:ases, not
only in Honor Code violations,"said Germane.
The last recommendation proposes to
equalize the selection procedure of student
and faculty members to the SJC.
As it is now, the three faculty members for
the SJC are selected by the Faculty Senate's
Committee on Committees while student
members are selected from a random,

computer-picked group of 24 students.
These students had previously indicated a
willingness to serve on the SJC if called, said
Germane. Three members and three alternates
are then selected by the Nominations Commit
tee.
Political dangers possible
"We don't think it's fair that (students) are
selected differently," said Germand. "The pos
sibility is there, although it has not been
abused yet, that faculty members will be
selected because of a certain political stand."
"For the faculty, it's a matter of choosing the
'right' person, while for students, it's a random
thing," added Germane.
Students will not be bringing detailed
suggestions for equalizing the selection pro
cess to C-15 meetings, according to Germane.
"We hope the C-15 will open this up to dis
cussion. Students will not be going in with
decisions made already. We want to discuss all
possibilities," Germane added.
Germane indicated the 600 signatures that
are needed to be gathered in order to convene
to the C-15 could be obtained by today.
"The committee may not meet this winter
because it will beDeadWeek,thenFinalsWeek,
however, we hope they convene as soon as
possible," Germane said.

maybe the misuse of a computer, anything that
could be taken to a downtown court (to be
tried)," Stone said.
"We feel that students should be allowed to
have a majority in both(kinds of) x:ases, not
only in Honor Code violations,"said Germane.
The last recommendation proposes to
equalize the selection procedure of student
and faculty members to the SJC.
As it is now, the three faculty members for
the SJC are selected by the Faculty Senate's
Committee on Committees while student
members are selected from a random,

computer-picked group of 24 students.
These students had previously indicated a
willingness to serve on the SJC if called, said
Germane. Three members and three alternates
are then selected by the Nominations Commit
tee.
Political dangers possible
"We don't think it's fair that (students) are
selected differently," said Germand. "The pos
sibility is there, although it has not been
abused yet, that faculty members will be
selected because of a certain political stand."
"For the faculty, it's a matter of choosing the
'right' person, while for students, it's a random
thing," added Germane.
Students will not be bringing detailed
suggestions for equalizing the selection pro
cess to C-15 meetings, according to Germane.
"We hope the C-15 will open this up to dis
cussion. Students will not be going in with
decisions made already. We want to discuss all
possibilities," Germane added.
Germane indicated the 600 signatures that
are needed to be gathered in order to convene
to the C-15 could be obtained by today.
"The committee may not meet this winter
because it will beDeadWeek,thenFinalsWeek,
however, we hope they convene as soon as
possible," Germane said.
Relatively few students find themselves
faced with the prospect of judicial discipline
for breaking the University Honor Code or by
laws.
However, for the sake of the rare cases, when
students do face reviews before the Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC), Council of Presidents
Vice President Charlotte Germane is
spearheading a drive she hopes will insure fair
student representation with the judicial sys
tem.
Germane is circulating a petition calling for
the convening of the Committee of Fifteen
(C-15) to consider amending procedural and
selection processes of the SJC and the Student
Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC).
The Stanford judicial system can be roughly
divided between the SCLC.the body that makes
rules for student conduct, and the SJC which
tries those who break the rules. The SJC, ac
cording to Chairman Jonathan Casper, reviews
about 15 cases annually.
"This year the SJC has heard one case," said
Assoc. Prof. Jonathan Casper, chairman of the
SJC.
"Students have the option of going before
the SJC or before the Dean of Students (James
Lyons). If they go before the Dean, they are
required to plead guilty.

"He's seen maybe 10-15 cases," said Casper.
Casper indicated that most of them were prob
ably Honor Code violations.
"In Honor Code cases, I have noticed that
students choose not to go before the SJC where
there is a student majority. Students have the
option (to be judged by their peers) but they
don't choose to exercise it," said Casper.
Lyons agreed, noting that in all recent cases,
students have chosen to appear before him
rather than the SJC.
"The SCLC is a legislative body that sets the
laws," said William Stone, assistant to the
President, "and the SJC hears the cases and
determines if you're guilty or not."
The petition's first proposal recommends
that the three students on the SCLC be ap
pointed to their post by the ASSU Nominations
Committee instead of by a student body elec
tion as mandated in the Legislative and Judi
cial Charter of 1968.
Committee in a coma
"This year no one ran because many stu
dents were not aware of the positions,"
explained Germane. "And the SCLC hadn't
met in five years. No one knew what was going
on."
Germane added that special elections (for
such positions) cost about $200 each.
"It's just easier and more economic to select

students through the Nominations Commit
tee," Germane said.
The second proposal asks that there be a
majority of students present during case re
views of both Honor Code and "other" viola
tions.
The SJC consists of three student members,
three faculty members and two Chairpersons,
one a faculty member and the other a law
school student. The student chairperson cur
rently presides over the votes to break ties in
Honor Code hearings while the faculty chair
person presides over and votes to break ties in
all other cases.

ably Honor Code violations.
"In Honor Code cases, I have noticed that
students choose not to go before the SJC where
there is a student majority. Students have the
option (to be judged by their peers) but they
don't choose to exercise it," said Casper.
Lyons agreed, noting that in all recent cases,
students have chosen to appear before him
rather than the SJC.
"The SCLC is a legislative body that sets the
laws," said William Stone, assistant to the
President, "and the SJC hears the cases and
determines if you're guilty or not."
The petition's first proposal recommends
that the three students on the SCLC be ap
pointed to their post by the ASSU Nominations
Committee instead of by a student body elec
tion as mandated in the Legislative and Judi
cial Charter of 1968.
Committee in a coma
"This year no one ran because many stu
dents were not aware of the positions,"
explained Germane. "And the SCLC hadn't
met in five years. No one knew what was going
on."
Germane added that special elections (for
such positions) cost about $200 each.
"It's just easier and more economic to select

students through the Nominations Commit
tee," Germane said.
The second proposal asks that there be a
majority of students present during case re
views of both Honor Code and "other" viola
tions.
The SJC consists of three student members,
three faculty members and two Chairpersons,
one a faculty member and the other a law
school student. The student chairperson cur
rently presides over the votes to break ties in
Honor Code hearings while the faculty chair
person presides over and votes to break ties in
all other cases.
Student crimes
"These 'other cases' are small internal prob
lems against the school like vandalism, theft,
maybe the misuse of a computer, anything that
could be taken to a downtown court (to be
tried)," Stone said.
"We feel that students should be allowed to
have a majority in both(kinds of) x:ases, not
only in Honor Code violations,"said Germane.
The last recommendation proposes to
equalize the selection procedure of student
and faculty members to the SJC.
As it is now, the three faculty members for
the SJC are selected by the Faculty Senate's
Committee on Committees while student
members are selected from a random,

computer-picked group of 24 students.
These students had previously indicated a
willingness to serve on the SJC if called, said
Germane. Three members and three alternates
are then selected by the Nominations Commit
tee.
Political dangers possible
"We don't think it's fair that (students) are
selected differently," said Germand. "The pos
sibility is there, although it has not been
abused yet, that faculty members will be
selected because of a certain political stand."
"For the faculty, it's a matter of choosing the
'right' person, while for students, it's a random
thing," added Germane.
Students will not be bringing detailed
suggestions for equalizing the selection pro
cess to C-15 meetings, according to Germane.
"We hope the C-15 will open this up to dis
cussion. Students will not be going in with
decisions made already. We want to discuss all
possibilities," Germane added.
Germane indicated the 600 signatures that
are needed to be gathered in order to convene
to the C-15 could be obtained by today.
"The committee may not meet this winter
because it will beDeadWeek,thenFinalsWeek,
however, we hope they convene as soon as
possible," Germane said.
