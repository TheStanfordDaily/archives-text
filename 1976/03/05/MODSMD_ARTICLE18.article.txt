Why are (he student directories 75 cents and the faculty /staff direc
tories $3. Are vve subsidizing free directories for University de
partments? -A.S.
No one seems to understand the great difference in price. They
are sold to the Bookstore for 60 cents and $2.75 respectively and
receive mark-ups.
Cathy I'mana, assistant publications supervisor, is in charge of
the student directories. She said that they use a "very economical
format" which involves sending computer print-outs directly to
the printer, after deleting by hand some student names.
However, Personnel Reports Supervisor Judy Andrews said that
her department, which publishes faculty/staff directories, also uses
computer print-outs and the same printer. The print-outs are sent to
all departments for verification, but this process could hardly raise
the price $2 a copy. And departments receive both directories free.
In conclusion, we really dort't know what is happening here.
Perhaps you should stop asking silly questions, and just let the
University bureaucracy lumber on.

Why do so inany University buildings have those double glass
doors with signs urging us to use only one of the doors? Were they
designed poorly, or is there some intelligent reason for wasting 50
percent of the doors? -DA.
Jason Mavis, director of Plant Services, suggests that you try
calling the Planning Office, although he doubts that there's much
of an answer to your question. "It's probably the architects," Mavis
said dejectedly. "The longer I'm in this job, the more frustrated I get
with architects."
