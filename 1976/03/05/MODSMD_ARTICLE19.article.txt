NIMOY: I am not Spock.
SPOCK: That statement is
superfluous, as it is clear that 1
am here and you are there. It is
illogical to assume that we
coexist.
NIMOY: I know that, and you
know that, but the public
doesn't.
SPOCK: Then it would seem
logical to tell them, not me.
NIMOY: I am trying.
SPOCK: How?
NIMOY: I wrote a book. I call
it, I am not SPOCK.
SPOCK: As I recall, you have
written two previous books be
fore, books of poetry, and not
outstanding poetry at that. Is this
poetry, too?
NIMOY: No, it isn't. It's my
protest against the public's ina
bility to separate us. I mean, ever
since Star Trek, when 1 played
you, 1 haven't been able to get
any serious acting roles.
SPOCK: Really? What have
you played?
NIMOY: A little Shakespeare,
Caligula the mad emperor,
Tevye in Fiddler on the Hoof,
McMurphy in Cuckoo's Nest.
SPOCK: These are not serious
roles?
NIMOY: No—of course, I used

to be a more serious actor.
SPOCK: And what were these
more serious roles?
NIMONY: Oh, I was in Queen
for a Day, Kid Monk Baroni, The
Lieutenant, Dr. Kildare, stuff like
that.
SHOCK: I am not familiar with
those roles. Are they highly re
garded on your planet?
NIMOY: You better believe it!
SPOCK: It is not logical to use
imperatives in the sense of be
lief, when that belief rests on
point of view.
NIMOY: Anyway, Spock,
you're missing the point.
SHOCK: I do not believe I have
been aiming at it.
NIMOY: Exactly.
SPOCK: I am not sure I under
stand.
NIMOY: The point is, no mat
ter what else I try to do, the pub
lic keeps calling me "Spock."
That's what I say in the book.
Everyone wants me to play crazy
people, outcasts, aliens, stuff
like that. That isn't me.
SPOCK: I understand that an
actor is never supposed to be
himself on stage.
NIMOY: No, I mean I've been
besieged with requests that I act
all these weird roles.
SPOCK: Before you played me
— that is, the fictitious version of
myself — on television, I do not
believe you were "besieged" at

all.
NIMOY: Uh — that's right.
SPOCK: Would you say your
career, such as it was, was in fact
in a state of decline?
NIMOY: Uh — well —
SPOCK: So in fact, your posi

tion in your chosen field has ap
parently been improved by play
ing Spock.
NIMOY: Well, 1 don't deny
that 1 have enjoyed playing the
role.
SPOCK: Enjoyment is an illog

ical basis for analyzing success
or lack thereof. Rational and ob
jective criteria should be
employed.
NIMOY: Let us change the
subject.
SHOCK: A subject, in and of
itself, is immutable—
NIMOY: Spock, will you shut
up? (Pause) Look, Spock, what 1
am trying to say in the book is
this. I had been acting for 16
years when the Star Trek offer
came up. 1 loved the role, too,
and 1 enjoyed the first season
immensely. But it started to go
sour — we all got more
stereotyped — and even though I
didn't threaten to quit, 1 proba
bly would have sooner or later.
SPOCK: 1 fail to seeyour point.
NIMOY: The point is, I felt
stifled. I'm an actor, not a Vul
can. It would be terrible — it is
terrible — to be a Vulcan all my
life.
SPOCK: I find no terrors in my
state.
NIMOY: But you are a Vulcan.
I'm not.
SPOCK: Then you cannot find
it terrible, as you put it.
NIMOY: Look, Spock, I just
want to do something different. I
want to smash the rumors. Star
Trek goes on and on — why
doesn't it die?
SPOCK: There are Star Trek

conventions, put on by its fans,
correct?
NIMOY: Yes
SPOCK: You receive a speak
ers' fee?
NIMOY: Well—
SPOCK: So despite your wish
that the show should "die," you
use it still to earn a living.
NIMOY: No — I also act.
SPOCK: We have established
three things: first, that you have
written a book, which you pre
sumably expect will sell, which
contains my name; second, that
your current acting offers, of
which there are many, come di
rectly as a result of your having
played me; and third, that you
receive cash for appearing at
conventions where you would
not be if not having played me.
NIMOY: . . .
SPOCK: In fact, are you not
trying to profit from the continu
ing human fascination with the
show?
NIMOY: . . .
SPOCK: However, Vulcans
hold no grudges. May your book
sell. I trust you will use tin;
money wisely.
NIMOY; Live long and
prosper. Spock.
SPOCK: That line was your
invention. The symbol is used by
certain orthodox rabbis in—
NIMOY: And let me count my
profits alone!
