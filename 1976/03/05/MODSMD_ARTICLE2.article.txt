# Student loans to increase
## 
### Anne Michelini 
As tuition continued to rise in years
to come, students should prepare to
accept the likelihood that loans will
make up a larger part of their financial
aid packages.
Director of Financial Aids Robert
Huff noted that "indebtedness is
bound to creep up" as the percentage
of students borrowing increases.
"There is a place for a loan in a stu
dent aid package," Huff said, "but
we're trying to control the extent a stu
dent goes into debt."
He estimated the debt incurred for
four full years here to average $2000
per student. Roughly half of the 3500
undergraduates receiving some form
of financial aid have a loan included in
their package, Huff said.
"Overall, resources for student aid,
at least here at Stanford, are generally
keeping pace with increased costs," he
commented.
Aid increasing
The budget for this year forecasts
$9.1 million in scholarships and
grants from all sources, Huff said. This
represents a nine percent increase over
last year's $8.4 million figure, of which
$5.3 million came from University en
dowments, general funds and gifts for
scholarships.
The remaining $3.1 million, Huff
said, came from federal and state
grants.
For the 1974-75 academic year, ap
proximately 1490 undergraduates bor
rowed a total of $1.5 million in loans.
This year about $2 million will proba
bly be borrowed, Huff said, with just
over half the loans coming under the
federal Guaranteed Student Loan
Program (GSLP).
Middle-income woes
The greatest burden of indebtedness
falls on middle-income students. Ac
cording to Tom Naylor, a senior in

economics and a student member of
the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare's Advisory Council on
Student Financial Aid, the middle
income student is "on the margin."
If anyone is going to be "cut off"
when federal, state and institutional
aid is used up, it will be the middle
income students, Naylor said.
The University considers a family
income of $17,000-27,000 to be in the
middle range, Naylor said. Since this
is some $10,000 higher than the na
tional family income average, fewer
students here would receive federal
and state aid earmarked for middle
income students, Naylor said.
Disappointment
He expressed disappointment with
the advisory council for "not really
having addressed the problem of the
middle-income situation."
Assuming that the split between the
cost of education and the students'
ability to pay will continue to grow,
bankers on the advisory council have
concluded that loan programs are the
"only growth area left," said Naylor.

ween the cost of education and the
student s ability to come up with the
payment, bankers on the advisory

programs are the "only growth area
left," said Naylor.
Overshadowing the prospect of
growing student dependence on loans
is the reluctance of lenders to grant
them. Tighter money in recent years
has made loans harder to get, even
from the middle-income oriented
GSLP Huff said.
The GSLP, he said, was originally
developed to help middle-income
families obtain loans in spite of dif
ficulties they often incur in valuing
their assets.

The government has also come out
with "a lot more red tape," according
to Huff, creating dissatisfaction with
the programs among bankers.
The high incidence of students de
faulting on GSLP loans does not help
the program's popularity with banks
or the government. Huff said. The na
tional default rate on these loans is
15-20 percent and as high as 50 per
cent in some states, he said.
The University does not collect on
GSLP loans and has no statistics for
default rates in that program among
students here, Huff said.
Technicalities
For the National Direct Student
Loan program, the delinquency rate
for loans appears to be between eight
iinxl nine percent, he said. However,
governmental technicalities in deter
mining delinquency include students
in the default category who should be
classified as "slow pay" only, Huff
said.
These students aren't following the
specified repayment terms of their
loan, but are making some contribu
tions to erase their debts, he said.
Naylor said the advisory council is
working on recommendations regar
ding the default problem. The recom
mendations wilj be included in the
council's final report in June.
Naylor said students are being un
justly maligned for a problem that's
"out of their control" in GSLP defaults.
"There are many areas where the
school, lenders and the federal Office
of Education must share the blame,"
stated an advisory council memo.
Loan amounts were not controlled,
school progress was not overseen, stu
dent responsibiliies were not clearly
defined at the time loan requests were
made and status reports were not
maintained, the memo said.

income students, Naylor said.
The University considers a family
income of $17,000-27,000 to be in the
middle range, Naylor said. Since this
is some $10,000 higher than the na
tional family income average, fewer
students here would receive federal
and state aid earmarked for middle
income students, Naylor said.
Disappointment
He expressed disappointment with
the advisory council for "not really
having addressed the problem of the
middle-income situation."
Assuming that the split between the
cost of education and the students'
ability to pay will continue to grow,
bankers on the advisory council have
concluded that loan programs are the
"only growth area left," said Naylor.
Assuming growing disparity bet
ween the cost of education and the
student s ability to come up with the
payment, bankers on the advisory

programs are the "only growth area

Overshadowing the prospect of
growing student dependence on loans
is the reluctance of lenders to grant
them. Tighter money in recent years
has made loans harder to get, even
from the middle-income oriented
GSLP Huff said.
The GSLP, he said, was originally
developed to help middle-income
families obtain loans in spite of dif
ficulties they often incur in valuing
their assets.

The government has also come out
with "a lot more red tape," according
to Huff, creating dissatisfaction with
the programs among bankers.
The high incidence of students de
faulting on GSLP loans does not help
the program's popularity with banks
or the government. Huff said. The na
tional default rate on these loans is
15-20 percent and as high as 50 per
cent in some states, he said.
The University does not collect on
GSLP loans and has no statistics for
default rates in that program among
students here, Huff said.
Technicalities
For the National Direct Student
Loan program, the delinquency rate
for loans appears to be between eight
iinxl nine percent, he said. However,
governmental technicalities in deter
mining delinquency include students
in the default category who should be
classified as "slow pay" only, Huff
said.
These students aren't following the
specified repayment terms of their
loan, but are making some contribu
tions to erase their debts, he said.
Naylor said the advisory council is
working on recommendations regar
ding the default problem. The recom
mendations wilj be included in the
council's final report in June.
Naylor said students are being un
justly maligned for a problem that's
"out of their control" in GSLP defaults.
"There are many areas where the
school, lenders and the federal Office
of Education must share the blame,"
stated an advisory council memo.
Loan amounts were not controlled,
school progress was not overseen, stu
dent responsibiliies were not clearly
defined at the time loan requests were
made and status reports were not
maintained, the memo said.
As tuition continued to rise in years
to come, students should prepare to
accept the likelihood that loans will
make up a larger part of their financial
aid packages.
Director of Financial Aids Robert
Huff noted that "indebtedness is
bound to creep up" as the percentage
of students borrowing increases.
"There is a place for a loan in a stu
dent aid package," Huff said, "but
we're trying to control the extent a stu
dent goes into debt."
He estimated the debt incurred for
four full years here to average $2000
per student. Roughly half of the 3500
undergraduates receiving some form
of financial aid have a loan included in
their package, Huff said.
"Overall, resources for student aid,
at least here at Stanford, are generally
keeping pace with increased costs," he
commented.
Aid increasing
The budget for this year forecasts
$9.1 million in scholarships and
grants from all sources, Huff said. This
represents a nine percent increase over
last year's $8.4 million figure, of which
$5.3 million came from University en
dowments, general funds and gifts for
scholarships.
The remaining $3.1 million, Huff
said, came from federal and state
grants.
For the 1974-75 academic year, ap
proximately 1490 undergraduates bor
rowed a total of $1.5 million in loans.
This year about $2 million will proba
bly be borrowed, Huff said, with just
over half the loans coming under the
federal Guaranteed Student Loan
Program (GSLP).
Middle-income woes
The greatest burden of indebtedness
falls on middle-income students. Ac
cording to Tom Naylor, a senior in

economics and a student member of
the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare's Advisory Council on
Student Financial Aid, the middle
income student is "on the margin."
If anyone is going to be "cut off"
when federal, state and institutional
aid is used up, it will be the middle
income students, Naylor said.

income of $17,000-27,000 to be in the

iinxl nine percent, he said. However,
governmental technicalities in deter
mining delinquency include students
in the default category who should be
classified as "slow pay" only, Huff
said.
These students aren't following the
specified repayment terms of their
loan, but are making some contribu
tions to erase their debts, he said.
Naylor said the advisory council is
working on recommendations regar
ding the default problem. The recom
mendations wilj be included in the
council's final report in June.
Naylor said students are being un
justly maligned for a problem that's
"out of their control" in GSLP defaults.
"There are many areas where the
school, lenders and the federal Office
of Education must share the blame,"
stated an advisory council memo.
Loan amounts were not controlled,
school progress was not overseen, stu
dent responsibiliies were not clearly
defined at the time loan requests were
made and status reports were not
maintained, the memo said.
As tuition continued to rise in years
to come, students should prepare to
accept the likelihood that loans will
make up a larger part of their financial
aid packages.
Director of Financial Aids Robert
Huff noted that "indebtedness is
bound to creep up" as the percentage
of students borrowing increases.
"There is a place for a loan in a stu
dent aid package," Huff said, "but
we're trying to control the extent a stu
dent goes into debt."
He estimated the debt incurred for
four full years here to average $2000
per student. Roughly half of the 3500
undergraduates receiving some form
of financial aid have a loan included in
their package, Huff said.
"Overall, resources for student aid,
at least here at Stanford, are generally
keeping pace with increased costs," he
commented.
Aid increasing
The budget for this year forecasts
$9.1 million in scholarships and
grants from all sources, Huff said. This
represents a nine percent increase over
last year's $8.4 million figure, of which
$5.3 million came from University en
dowments, general funds and gifts for
scholarships.
The remaining $3.1 million, Huff
said, came from federal and state
grants.
For the 1974-75 academic year, ap
proximately 1490 undergraduates bor
rowed a total of $1.5 million in loans.
This year about $2 million will proba
bly be borrowed, Huff said, with just
over half the loans coming under the
federal Guaranteed Student Loan
Program (GSLP).
Middle-income woes
The greatest burden of indebtedness
falls on middle-income students. Ac
cording to Tom Naylor, a senior in

economics and a student member of
the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare's Advisory Council on
Student Financial Aid, the middle
income student is "on the margin."
If anyone is going to be "cut off"
when federal, state and institutional
aid is used up, it will be the middle
income students, Naylor said.
The University considers a family
income of $17,000-27,000 to be in the
middle range, Naylor said. Since this
is some $10,000 higher than the na
tional family income average, fewer
students here would receive federal
and state aid earmarked for middle
income students, Naylor said.
Disappointment
He expressed disappointment with
the advisory council for "not really
having addressed the problem of the
middle-income situation."
Assuming that the split between the
cost of education and the students'
ability to pay will continue to grow,
bankers on the advisory council have
concluded that loan programs are the
"only growth area left," said Naylor.
Assuming growing disparity bet
ween the cost of education and the
student s ability to come up with the
payment, bankers on the advisory
council have concluded that loan
programs are the "only growth area
left," said Naylor.
Overshadowing the prospect of
growing student dependence on loans
is the reluctance of lenders to grant
them. Tighter money in recent years
has made loans harder to get, even
from the middle-income oriented
GSLP Huff said.
The GSLP, he said, was originally
developed to help middle-income
families obtain loans in spite of dif
ficulties they often incur in valuing
their assets.

The government has also come out
with "a lot more red tape," according
to Huff, creating dissatisfaction with
the programs among bankers.
The high incidence of students de
faulting on GSLP loans does not help
the program's popularity with banks
or the government. Huff said. The na
tional default rate on these loans is
15-20 percent and as high as 50 per
cent in some states, he said.
The University does not collect on
GSLP loans and has no statistics for
default rates in that program among
students here, Huff said.
Technicalities
For the National Direct Student
Loan program, the delinquency rate
for loans appears to be between eight
iinxl nine percent, he said. However,
governmental technicalities in deter
mining delinquency include students
in the default category who should be
classified as "slow pay" only, Huff
said.

specified repayment terms of their
loan, but are making some contribu
