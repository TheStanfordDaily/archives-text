After reading a review by thea
ter and film critic John Simon,
one may envision him as a frus
trated, misanthropic cynic.
Reading Singularities, the com
pilation of 35 of Simon's essays
on the theater from 1964-1974,
by sheer concentration of pro
duct, one envisions an acidic
fire-breathing dragon whose
mere exhalation chars anything
within the distance from his seat
to the stage.
Simon apparently hates every
thing, including the theater,
which he professes to love sin
cerely. He takes great pleasure in
slicing into ribbons anything his
gunnery sights happen to light
upon. This far-from-select group
includes the theater-going pub
lic. fellow critics, doctors, jour
nalists. Pulitzer prizes — and the
list goes on.
He writes his criticism the way
Michael Crichton writes his sci
ence fiction novels — on a lofty
plane from which he deigns to
inform the reader in extremely
condescending terms what is

going on in his mind, all the time
resenting bitterly having to exp
lain his superior intelligence in
more plebian terms.
Simon seems to enjoy talk
ing down to his reader. One
of his favorite exercises is show
ing off his excellence in foreign
languages, liberally sprinkling
Latin, Greek and French (mod
ern, as well as Old and Middle)
throughout, as if taunting the
reader to just try and scale to his
intellectual capabilities.
Simon's potshots at the theater
are so constant that one begins to
wonder just what kind of
masochist has been created here.
He claims that only someone
who loves the theater as much as
he does could sit through as
much dreck as he does, la
menting the lack of acting and
directing talent on Broadway to
day.
Yet his praises for the theater
are few and far between. He
claims to want to save it, but he
attacks it so mercilessly that one
wonders if he's schizoid.
Simon seems to see himself
and his passionate wrath against
the theater as the best thing that
has happened to it in years. Like

a strict parent, he goads his pro
digy, trying to make it perform
the best that it possibly can,
wanting the best for something
that he believes still has great po
tential.
Or does it? Is the theater on an
unstoppable decline? Or is it
only in a momentary downward
cycle? Simon bemoans its de
cline and desperately browbeats
it. His attempts to prod it back
into its pre-Depression bril
liance resembles beating a dead
horse.
Singularities is a sneering,
extra-realistic look at the theater
today, written by a man who
comes off as extremely snobbish
and condescending. Wading
through Simon's caustic re
marks one uncovers an extreme
and uncomfortable view of the
theater. He's entitled to his opin
ion, but it's less than fascinating
to subject oneself to it.
