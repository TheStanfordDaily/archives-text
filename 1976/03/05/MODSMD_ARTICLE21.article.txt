Reviewed by Dave Smith
When Donald Barthelme's lumpy first
novel, Snow White, appeared several years
ago, many critics were quick to predict a
great improvement once Barthelme became
comfortable with longer fiction.
Since then, Barthelme has firmly buttres
sed his position as the country's best and
most original writer of short stories and wry
essays. But The Dead Father, his second
novel, still finds Barthelme unable to make
a long work consistently interesting, consis
tently worth reading â€” consistently any
thing.
The Dead Father himself (itself?) is a typi
cally extravagant Barthelme creation:
neither precisely dead nor exactly alive,
3200 cubits long with a seven meter-high
foot and an artificial leg equipped with,
among other features, booths where guilt
ridden citizens can make confessions. The
Dead Father spends the course of the novel
being dragged toward his ultimate resting
place by a party of 19 cable-pullers.
Narrative problems
The obvious narrative problems brought
on by the presence of such a ponderous

central figure are only complicated by
Barthelme's use of a dreary, choppy prose
consisting mostly of sentence fragments to
describe the equally dreary landscape.
Most of the novel consists of dialogue,
with the other members of the party (espe
cially Thomas, the most prominent son
figure) attempting to cope with the Dead
Father's frequent tirades, listening respect
fully to his amusing tall tales and instilling
hope in him even though they intend to do
away with him for good.
Those who are not fond of bald allegories
may be a bit impatient with Barthelme's
Dead Father, who cannot resist rephrasing
the metaphysical problems of aging and the
paternity at every bump in the road he is
being dragged along.
Others may wonder why Barthelme chose
to include several passages of non
communicative dialogue, long strings of
one-liners that include garbled cliches,
rhetoric culled from business letters and
other such boring junk.
Cold pudding
The whole book would be something of a
cold pudding without the presence of "A
Manual for Sons," given to the Dead
Father's traveling companions by one Peter
Scatterpatter (incidentally, plays on "pat

ter" and "pop" are numerous) and repro
duced as a book within a novel.
This scatterbrained and entirely touching
document, divided with marvelous illogic
into chapters on "leaping fathers," "names
of fathers" and so forth, is really the knot of
the novel and is as witty and tender as the
best of Barthelme.
Barthelme seems highly uncomfortable
with fictional sex and female characters, so
that his love scenes (the male partner is not
infrequently an ape) come off as grotesque
and unpleasant. The insecurity and misery
of Snow White's seven suitors is present in
the males of the Dead Father's party and the
women are as bitchy and debased as any in
previous Barthelme works.
Finally, one can not help noticing Barth
elme's formidable debt to other, and better,
novelists, particularly Gertrude Stein. Her
Making of Americans begins:
Once an angry man dragged his father
across his own orchard. "Stop!" cried the
old man at last. "Stop!" I did not drag my
father beyond this tree."
After reading The Dead Father, one might
wish that Barthelme had left the dragging of
fathers over old ground to Stein and instead
confined his treatise on fatherhood to "A
Manual for Sons."
