## Young violinists deliver lively performances Hiroko Yajima: stirring, tender 
### Keith Calhoun 
I have never been known to spend my last
money on violin concerts but sometimes even 1
can be wrong. Hiroko Yajima is a case in point.
Yajima'sconcert Friday night was lively, tender,
stirring and powerful. That much was evident to
anyone sitting in the audience. But beneath that
was a very warm and personable young lady who
put herself fully into her music and found an
audience that was appreciative.
Throughout the entire concert one could not
help but be affected by the movement and expres
sion that accompanied her concise, clear playing.
It was felt by the audience, and this closeness
added to the performance. The combination of her
intensity and choice of works made it a truly
enjoyable evening.
1 felt, however, somewhat disappointed at the
staging arrangements. The closeness of the Tre
sidder Lounge lent a feeling of intimacy but the
audience did not have an adequate view from all
the seats and the lighting did not focus on the
performers.
These flaws detracted from what turned out to
be quite a visual performance.
Accompaniment
The performance was also greatly aided by the
accompaniment of Walter Ponce on piano. His
notes blended wel 1 to give a very pleasing effect as
they floated and danced around the strongly
played strings of Yajima.
At times it was difficult to separate the two
instruments. This was true throughout the night
but particularly in the first piece, Sonata in A
Major for Violin and Piano by Mozart. Yajima
played the adante section with genuine feeling
and seemed to be a part of her music.
This was followed by Bach's Sonata No. J in G
Minor, an unaccompanied performance during
which she played the Fugue-Allegro with an in
tensity that kept the audience attentive through
out. She was called back for three bows before the

break for intermission.
In the second half she began with a compelling
piece, written in 1942 by Roger Sessions entitled
Duo for Violin and Piano. It was here that the poor
lighting hurt the most.
The sometimes tranquil, sometimes darting,
urgent pace of the music could have been focused
on the performers instead of in some other direc
tion.
The last piece was a fitting end. Entitled Sonata
No. 1, Opus 75 for Violin and Piano by Saint
Saens, the piece allowed Yajima and Ponce to take
their listeners up and down in surges of power. It
was controlled force and it ended with a
dynamism that the audience fully loved.
RoSes
A young boy presented her with a box of roses
somewhere along the fourth or fifth ovation and
someone even shouted "More!" But unfortu
nately it did not come.
Yajima's concert was part of the Young Concert
Artists Series, and she herself has received
numerous awards including the Young Artists
Competition of the Hudson Valley Philharmonic
in 1967.
The Young Concert Artists is a professional or
ganization founded in 1961 to discover and
launch the careers of talented but little known
musicians from all over the world. After Yajima's
performance I can not help but think that this time
they truly hit the mark.

urgent pace of the music could have been focused
on the performers instead of in some other direc
tion.
The last piece was a fitting end. Entitled Sonata
No. 1, Opus 75 for Violin and Piano by Saint
Saens, the piece allowed Yajima and Ponce to take
their listeners up and down in surges of power. It
was controlled force and it ended with a
dynamism that the audience fully loved.

A young boy presented her with a box of roses
somewhere along the fourth or fifth ovation and
someone even shouted "More!" But unfortu
nately it did not come.
Yajima's concert was part of the Young Concert
Artists Series, and she herself has received
numerous awards including the Young Artists
Competition of the Hudson Valley Philharmonic
in 1967.
The Young Concert Artists is a professional or
ganization founded in 1961 to discover and
launch the careers of talented but little known
musicians from all over the world. After Yajima's
performance I can not help but think that this time
they truly hit the mark.
I have never been known to spend my last
money on violin concerts but sometimes even 1
can be wrong. Hiroko Yajima is a case in point.
Yajima'sconcert Friday night was lively, tender,
stirring and powerful. That much was evident to
anyone sitting in the audience. But beneath that
was a very warm and personable young lady who
put herself fully into her music and found an
audience that was appreciative.
Throughout the entire concert one could not
help but be affected by the movement and expres
sion that accompanied her concise, clear playing.
It was felt by the audience, and this closeness
added to the performance. The combination of her
intensity and choice of works made it a truly
enjoyable evening.
1 felt, however, somewhat disappointed at the
staging arrangements. The closeness of the Tre
sidder Lounge lent a feeling of intimacy but the
audience did not have an adequate view from all
the seats and the lighting did not focus on the
performers.
These flaws detracted from what turned out to
be quite a visual performance.
Accompaniment
The performance was also greatly aided by the
accompaniment of Walter Ponce on piano. His
notes blended wel 1 to give a very pleasing effect as
they floated and danced around the strongly
played strings of Yajima.
At times it was difficult to separate the two
instruments. This was true throughout the night
but particularly in the first piece, Sonata in A
Major for Violin and Piano by Mozart. Yajima
played the adante section with genuine feeling
and seemed to be a part of her music.
This was followed by Bach's Sonata No. J in G
Minor, an unaccompanied performance during
which she played the Fugue-Allegro with an in
tensity that kept the audience attentive through
out. She was called back for three bows before the

break for intermission.
In the second half she began with a compelling
piece, written in 1942 by Roger Sessions entitled
Duo for Violin and Piano. It was here that the poor
lighting hurt the most.
The sometimes tranquil, sometimes darting,
urgent pace of the music could have been focused
on the performers instead of in some other direc
tion.
