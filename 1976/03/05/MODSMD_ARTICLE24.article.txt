# Kyung—Wha Chang: a first class soloist
## 
### Thaddeus Carhart 
Nothing in the concert hall is quite as
exciting as the experience of hearing a first
class soloist interpret a great virtuoso con
certo, as the brilliant young violinist
Kyung-Wha Chung proved last Wednesday
when she played Prokofiev's Violin Con
certo No. 2 with the San Francisco Sym
phony.
The orchestra itself was in top form as
well, and the choice of program made the
concert one of those rare events when all
forces seen, to conspire to produce an ex
ceptional and memorable evening.
Principal Guest Conductor Edo de Waart
opened the concert by leading the orchestra
in a performance of Mi lhaud'sKentuckiana,
a 1948 piece commissioned by the Louis
ville Philharmonic. The eclecticism of this
popular French composer is everywhere ap
parent in this work, subtitled "a divertisse
ment on twenty Kentucky tunes." The
sound of familiar Ameican melodies inter
woven and orchestrated with a Gallic flair is
intriguing and, at times, downright fun.
("Sweet Betsy from Pike" never sounded so
complex!)
While the melodic themes are admittedly
"lightweight" for the symphonic repertoire,
the orchestra's spirited and precise playing
gave the requisite energy to this study of the
American idiom. One was reminded by
turns of early Copland with a classical gloss,
or of Offenbach "gone country."
This short piece is a fascinating example
of how a foreigner can bring a new perspec
tive to our most familiar folk tunes, and it
was just the right sort of "divertissement" to
prepare the audience for the virtuoso
pyrotechnics which followed.
Special performer
Fromthe moment Kvungbegan to play the
main theme of the Prokofiev's first move

ment, stated first by the unaccompanied
solo violin, it was apparent that a very spe
cial performer had taken the stage.
At all times she displayed the utter mas
tery and absolute self-confidence that set
apart the true virtuoso, producing with her
instrument an exquisitely resonant tone
that one would expect only of a Heifetz or an
Oistrakh.
Prokofiev is known for putting the soloist
to the ultimate test in terms of technical
ability with his fiendishly challenging
rhythms and complex technical figurations.
Few can give more than a passable reading
of his scores. Fewer still can surmount the
music's technical obstacles and bring a ma
ture, personal interpretation to Prokofiev's
conceptions, thereby expanding our ap
preciation of one of the most important of
20th century composers.
Beautifully phrased
The free tonal shifts and subtle modula
tions in the first two movements of this 1935
work were beautifully phrased and per
fectly controlled. In particular, the clarity
and restraint in the andante, where the vio
lin's singing melody emerges over a piz
zicato triplet figure in the strings, literally
held the audience breathless.
But it was in the harsh chordal superim
positions of the finale that the exceptional
nature of Kyung's talent was heard to best
advantage."To give but one illustration of
the devilish intricacy of this movement's
scoring, within three pages of music the
time signature changes abruptly from a 7/4
to a 3/4 to a 5/4 to a 2/2 to a 2/4 to a 3/2 — and
so it continues!
Kyung did not miss a beat; indeed, she
actually brought a headlong vigor to these
formidable rhythm shifts that dazzled the
listener with each attack. Such virtuosity is
nothing short of extraordinary, and it is to

be hoped that so exciting a performer will
not be long in returning to San Francisco.
Clear accompaniment
The orchestra was equal to the soloist's
efforts, providing a clear, well-phrased ac
companiment under De Waart's steady ba
ton. Nor did the orchestra's brilliance di
minish in Khung's absence, as evidenced by
the concert's second half, a lushly romantic
reading of Brahms' Symphony No. 2.
There is a marked contrast between
Brahms' First Symphony and his Second.
The heroic pathos of the earlier work gives
way to a lyric pastoralism which makes the
Second the most accessible of Brahms'
works in the symphonic medium.
De Waart brought just the right touch to
this wonderfully varied composition with
its bright and delicate instrumentation, and
the orchestra responded in kind. The prom
inent woodwinds were particularly lucid,
and the trombones and tubas brought
splendid power to the crescendi of the first
and last movements.
Worthy successor
De Waart once again demonstrated that
he would prove a worthy successor to Seiji
O/.awa. The orchestra has not sounded bet
ter this season than it has under his direc
tion, and the players seem genuinely to
enjoy his brand of musicianship.
What is more, he feels comfortable in the
American idiom,as he amply showed two
weeks ago with Ives'Symphony No. 3 and
Copland's Old American Songs. In short.
San Francisco would be hard put to find a
conductor preferable to so disciplined and
dynamic a young maestro.
This week's symphony program features
Haydn's Symphony No. 93, Bartok's Piano
Concerto No. 2 with guest soloist Joseph
Kalichstein.and Dvorak's Symphony No. 7.
De Waart will again conduct the orchestra.
