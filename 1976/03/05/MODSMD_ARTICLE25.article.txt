# Adele H. unsatisfying
## 
### Kautilya 
The movies are a peculiar art
form. They are always in a state
of flux.
New ways of story telling be
come old too soon. Ultra modern
techniques become hackneyed
long before their full potential is
realized. For every innovation of
a Fellini or a Resnais we have a
plethora of imitations from
pseudo-Fellinis and pseudo-
Resnaises.
Also, the cinema by its very
nature is rather transient in its
impact. Then again, young
people stil I constitute the bulk of
the viewing public. And youth is
so impatient. What does all his
lead up to? Premature mortality
amongst film-makers.
How often have we seen a
Polanski or a Welles react from a
fear of obsolescence and rush
into continuous and conspicu
ous experimentation. Regret
fully we witness a Malleor a Ray
abandon their personal styles for
the sake of something unviable
or simply unsuitable to their par
ticular genius.
Only the truly great can re
deem themselves. Bergman's
capacity for development seems
infinite. But not so with Truf
faut.
Values
The Story of Adele H. is a vis
ually exquisite film. However,
there is no controlling sense to
delineate human values; no dis
ciplined exposition of universal
emotions.
The entire film bears evidence
of Truffaut's overrated vision of
love that belongs to the ages.
Beyond this there seems to be no
other reason for making this
movie — except, of course, his
still more overrated vision of
Isabelle Adjani. But about that
later.
Adele has sequences that are

truly well-done; but they a un
able to comprise an organic
whole. Thus, despite the excel
lence of execution — in fact, be
cause of it — weencou ntera film
that is ultimately dissatifying.
At first it seem that every ele
ment needed for a masterpiece is
at hand. The script is based on a
diary kept by Adele, the younger
daughter of Victor I lugo. A vital
contributor to the success of
Rohmer's films has been the
cinematography of Nestor Al
mendros.
The music is by Maurice
(aubert, the greatest French
composer of the thirties. His bril
liant scores served to perfection
the poetic realism of Vigo, Clair,
Carne, Prevert and Duvivier. But
something is missing: charac
terization, for one; and the objec
tive humanity of Adele's de
velopment that led to her aberra
tion, for another.
One-person love
This one-person love story
with all its tragic overtones, and
all its psychological trappings,
fails in the end to stir our hearts.
One is confused in trying to
identify the focus of the movie. Is
it the eulogy to Hugo? Or, is it
the exaltation of unrequited
love?
Let it suffice to say that the
film deals with Adele's de
mented pursuit of a British sol
dier all the way to the New
World. To win him over she de
ceives, begs, connives, prays. It
is the height of sado-masochism.
In the end when all fails she is
reduced to complete madness.
One reason why the movie
fails is that there is not enough
material to maintain the feverish
tempo. But the chief cause is
Isabelle. With her youthful
beauty she brings an aura to the
role, but her histrionic talents
are sorely limited.

It is obvious that Truffaut did
not choose Adele as a vehicle for
Isabelle, hut rather Adjani as an
object for his adulation. Why
else should he employ a wispy
19-year old to portray a thirty
plus old maid Adele, when he is
so scrupulously honest in every
thing else?
A rather sorry fact emerges.
Truffaut has failed to live up to
the image formed after his first
films, and somewhat, kept alive
by a few recent ones. We want
more from a director whose work
was so innovative, so individual,
and so sensitive yet challenging.
There is a single lovely touch
in this film when we see a
close-up of Truffaut when Ad
jani hails him by mistake. But
that is all. Without such charac
teristic lighthearted improvisa
tion Adele reeks of unbearably
dull artistry.
And without a player like
Jeanne Moreau we find an Adele
who is merely contrived and cel
luloid. The Story of Adele H. is a
disappointing bore. And the
much heralded Adjani, more so.

the exaltation of unrequited
love?
Let it suffice to say that the
film deals with Adele's de
mented pursuit of a British sol
dier all the way to the New
World. To win him over she de
ceives, begs, connives, prays. It
is the height of sado-masochism.
In the end when all fails she is
reduced to complete madness.
One reason why the movie
fails is that there is not enough
material to maintain the feverish
tempo. But the chief cause is
Isabelle. With her youthful
beauty she brings an aura to the
role, but her histrionic talents
are sorely limited.

It is obvious that Truffaut did
not choose Adele as a vehicle for
Isabelle, hut rather Adjani as an
object for his adulation. Why
else should he employ a wispy
19-year old to portray a thirty
plus old maid Adele, when he is
so scrupulously honest in every
thing else?
A rather sorry fact emerges.
Truffaut has failed to live up to
the image formed after his first
films, and somewhat, kept alive
by a few recent ones. We want
more from a director whose work
was so innovative, so individual,
and so sensitive yet challenging.
There is a single lovely touch
in this film when we see a
close-up of Truffaut when Ad
jani hails him by mistake. But
that is all. Without such charac
teristic lighthearted improvisa
tion Adele reeks of unbearably
dull artistry.
And without a player like
Jeanne Moreau we find an Adele
who is merely contrived and cel
luloid. The Story of Adele H. is a
disappointing bore. And the
much heralded Adjani, more so.


LONELY NlCiHT—Daughter of Victor Hugo, the most famous man in the world, Adele Hugo

The movies are a peculiar art
form. They are always in a state
of flux.
New ways of story telling be
come old too soon. Ultra modern
techniques become hackneyed
long before their full potential is
realized. For every innovation of
a Fellini or a Resnais we have a
plethora of imitations from
pseudo-Fellinis and pseudo-
Resnaises.
Also, the cinema by its very
nature is rather transient in its
impact. Then again, young
people stil I constitute the bulk of
the viewing public. And youth is
so impatient. What does all his
lead up to? Premature mortality
amongst film-makers.
How often have we seen a
Polanski or a Welles react from a
fear of obsolescence and rush
into continuous and conspicu
ous experimentation. Regret
fully we witness a Malleor a Ray

the sake of something unviable
or simply unsuitable to their par

Only the truly great can re
deem themselves. Bergman's
capacity for development seems
infinite. But not so with Truf

Values
The Story of Adele H. is a vis
ually exquisite film. However,
there is no controlling sense to
delineate human values; no dis
ciplined exposition of universal
emotions.
The entire film bears evidence
of Truffaut's overrated vision of
love that belongs to the ages.
Beyond this there seems to be no
other reason for making this
movie — except, of course, his
still more overrated vision of
Isabelle Adjani. But about that
later.
Adele has sequences that are

truly well-done; but they a un
able to comprise an organic
whole. Thus, despite the excel
lence of execution — in fact, be
cause of it — weencou ntera film
that is ultimately dissatifying.
At first it seem that every ele
ment needed for a masterpiece is
at hand. The script is based on a
diary kept by Adele, the younger
daughter of Victor I lugo. A vital
contributor to the success of
Rohmer's films has been the
cinematography of Nestor Al
mendros.
The music is by Maurice
(aubert, the greatest French
composer of the thirties. His bril
liant scores served to perfection
the poetic realism of Vigo, Clair,
Carne, Prevert and Duvivier. But
something is missing: charac
terization, for one; and the objec
tive humanity of Adele's de
velopment that led to her aberra

into continuous and conspicu
ous experimentation. Regret
fully we witness a Malleor a Ray
abandon their personal styles for
the sake of something unviable
or simply unsuitable to their par
ticular genius.
Only the truly great can re
deem themselves. Bergman's
capacity for development seems
infinite. But not so with Truf
faut.
Values
The Story of Adele H. is a vis
ually exquisite film. However,
there is no controlling sense to
delineate human values; no dis
ciplined exposition of universal
emotions.
The entire film bears evidence
of Truffaut's overrated vision of
love that belongs to the ages.
Beyond this there seems to be no
other reason for making this
movie — except, of course, his
still more overrated vision of
Isabelle Adjani. But about that
later.
Adele has sequences that are

truly well-done; but they a un
able to comprise an organic
whole. Thus, despite the excel
lence of execution — in fact, be
cause of it — weencou ntera film
that is ultimately dissatifying.
At first it seem that every ele
ment needed for a masterpiece is
at hand. The script is based on a
diary kept by Adele, the younger
daughter of Victor I lugo. A vital
contributor to the success of
Rohmer's films has been the
cinematography of Nestor Al
mendros.
The music is by Maurice
(aubert, the greatest French
composer of the thirties. His bril
liant scores served to perfection
the poetic realism of Vigo, Clair,
Carne, Prevert and Duvivier. But
something is missing: charac
terization, for one; and the objec
tive humanity of Adele's de
velopment that led to her aberra
tion, for another.
One-person love
This one-person love story
with all its tragic overtones, and
all its psychological trappings,
fails in the end to stir our hearts.
One is confused in trying to
identify the focus of the movie. Is
it the eulogy to Hugo? Or, is it
the exaltation of unrequited
love?
Let it suffice to say that the
film deals with Adele's de
mented pursuit of a British sol
dier all the way to the New
World. To win him over she de
ceives, begs, connives, prays. It
is the height of sado-masochism.
In the end when all fails she is
reduced to complete madness.
One reason why the movie
fails is that there is not enough
material to maintain the feverish
tempo. But the chief cause is
Isabelle. With her youthful
beauty she brings an aura to the
role, but her histrionic talents
are sorely limited.

It is obvious that Truffaut did
not choose Adele as a vehicle for
Isabelle, hut rather Adjani as an
object for his adulation. Why
else should he employ a wispy
19-year old to portray a thirty
plus old maid Adele, when he is
so scrupulously honest in every
thing else?
A rather sorry fact emerges.
Truffaut has failed to live up to
the image formed after his first
films, and somewhat, kept alive
by a few recent ones. We want
more from a director whose work
was so innovative, so individual,
and so sensitive yet challenging.
There is a single lovely touch
in this film when we see a
close-up of Truffaut when Ad
jani hails him by mistake. But
that is all. Without such charac
teristic lighthearted improvisa
tion Adele reeks of unbearably
dull artistry.
And without a player like
Jeanne Moreau we find an Adele
who is merely contrived and cel
luloid. The Story of Adele H. is a
disappointing bore. And the
much heralded Adjani, more so.


LONELY NlCiHT—Daughter of Victor Hugo, the most famous man in the world, Adele Hugo
(portrayed by Isabelle Adjani) pours out her feelings about her unrequited love for an English
lieutenant in a coded journal. This scene is taken from the new film by Francois Truffaut, The Slorv
of A (lain I I.
