# 'Taxi Driver' takes a wrong turn
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
Watching Martin Scorsese's
Tcixi Driver is like driving to
ward l.os Angeles and finding
yourself in Seattle. It leads the
viewer on a less-than-joyful ex
cursion through the dregs ol
New York as seen by taxi driver
Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro).
While it is chillingly accurate
in its portrayal of New York and
its state of depravity, it leads the
audience to expect something
that never happens, leaving it
cheated and unfulfilled.
Taxi Driver resembles a
patchwork concoction from
Death Wish. Nashville and The
Pumllox View. Travis Bickle is a
frustrated nobody, almost a part
of his taxi. Scorsese accentuates
this idea by close-ups of parts ol
the taxi as meticulous as those of
Travis.
Travis roams the streets long
ing to be a "somebody," and his
intentions become apparent
when he starts following the
presidential campaign of
Charles Palantine. The audience
naively assumes Travis is fol
lowing the paths of Sirhan
Sirhan and James Karl Ray, for
who would have heard of them if
they hadn't. . .
Goddess
Travis becomes enamored of
Palantine aide Betsy, a role per
fectly suited for the actress who
plays her — Gybill Shepherd.
The part calls for a beautiful
goddess — right up her alley.
It is amazing that Shepherd
could botch a part in which she
is typecast. She half-heartedly
plays Betsy, as if there were
something more captivating
beyond the camera dividing her
attention. One can only hope she
becomes theTippi Hedrenofthe
19705.
Robert DeNiro, on the other
hand, can not be faulted. Even
though some of his movies have
been atrocious, he is always
superb. As the eccentric and
slightly dumb Travis, be turns in
a frighteningly realistic por
trayal.

The flaw of Taxi Driver is that
Scorsese not only lets us believe
that assassination is Travis' de
stination. but tricks us by em
phasizing the possibility. It's
hard to miss the implications
when Travis starts having target
practice in front of a "Palantine
for President" poster.
Misleading
All the suspense that Toxi
Driver generates, therefore, is
false and misleading. It is one
thing to surprise an audience,
but it is entirely another to
knowingly deceive one.
There is a reason, however
flimsy, for the film's construe

tion. Travis is portrayed as a
walking timebomb, designed by
his own crooked imagination to
clean up New York Gity. How
many like Travis are walking the
streets right now?
When Travis -xplodes finally,
it is strangely condoned, be
cause his victims are criminals.
But if he had exploded at a polit
ical rally, he would have been
shot on the spot.
With this Scorsese and
screenwriter Paul Schrader ;\re
showing how close society
comes to disaster each day, how
many people are so close to the
brink of insanity, how easily soc

i»!ty oppresses people into vio
lence. It is only sheer luck that
makes them criminals or heoes.
There was a ruckus about the
violence of Tuxi Driver. Some
said the film should have been
rated X, instead of K. because of
the graphic nature of the climac
tic shoot-out. It is post-
Peckinpah realism that drives
the '"'.iral home like a
sledge i.iminer. Somehow, it is
all strangely familiar.
In tiie end, Travis has
achieved what In; wanted. I le isa
somebody. Scorsese achieves his
goal, too. Unfortunately, he does
it at the expense of theaudience.
