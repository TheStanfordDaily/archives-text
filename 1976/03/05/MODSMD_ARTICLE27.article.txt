# Old blues pair still swings
## 
### Stacy Geiken 
Sonny Terry and Brownie
McGhee satisfied a large crowd
at The Great American Music
Hall in San I'ranciseo last Mon
day night, proving that they are
two of the finest country blues
artists alive today.
Sonny Terry is 65 years old
and almost totally blind, lie;
plays the blues harmonica with
more energy and precision than
most harmonica players half his
age. Brownie McGhee, also in
his 60s, plays a fine country
blues style guitar.
They complement one another
well, trading off backup and lead
with incredible ease. Their orig
inal style, coupled with their 36
years of playing together, has
won them international recogi
tion.
Whoop
Sonny Terry was the first on
stage. 1 le played a few riffs on his
harmonica then he let out a
whoop and asked, "How ya' all
doin'?" Theaudience responded
with a warm round of applause.
Then Brownie came on. He
took a slight bow and tipped his
floppy blue jean hat to the crowd
as he headed towards his seat.
Sonny sang and played some

energetic harmonica solos on
the first three songs, "Long Way
From I lome," "Don't Give Up on
Me Baby" and "Pretty Little
Girl."
Sonny told stories between
songs, mostly about the women
in his life. At one point hesmiled
and said, "I had me an old lady,
but 1 got rid of her and got me a
fine young thing."
Brownie played rhythm until
it was his turn to take over on a
song called, "Mean Woman
Blues." He sang and soloed on
guitar while Sonny sat motion
less until it was his turn to play.
Brownie continually teased the
audience by talking and chang
ing rhythms during his guitar
solos.
During Brownie's solo on
"I'm a Stranger Here" he played
so softly that all I could hear was
the toe tapping and finger snap
ping of the audience. Several
people thought that his solo was
over and started to applaud.
Brownie shook his head and
said, "Don't pat your hands. I'll
tell you when." At one point a
woman yelled to Brownie, "Do it
again." Brownie teased, "I'm 75
years old. I ain't gonna do it no
more."

Sonny and Urownie sang to
gether on the next to last numhei
entitled "The Sun's CJoniia
Shine in My Hack Door Some
Day." Uy the end of the songt hey
had the entire audience singing
the retrain.
The last song, "Sonny's
Squall," featured Sonny Terry
on an incredible harmonica solo.
In his solo, Sonny whooped and
played the harmonica in such
rapid succession that it was hard
â€¢to tell when lie was playing and
when lie was hollering.
Sonny and Urownie walked
off the stage to a standing ova
tion. The applause continued
until tin; manager came out. He
explained that they couldn't do
an encore because they needed
to rest before the next set. After
D() years of playing consistent,
high quality country blues,
Sonny Terry and Brownie
Mcdhee deserved the rest.
