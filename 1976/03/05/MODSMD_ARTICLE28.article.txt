## Golden Bears seek .500 season Cards travel to Cal 
### Chris Baker 
The End.
That's what tonight will be for
three Stanford seniors, Card
coach Dick Dißiaso and the rest
ot the Stanford basketball team,
when it travels to Berkeley to
face California tonight at 8 in
Harmon Cym.
Seniors Ed Schweitzer, Tim
Patterson and Mike Simons will
be wearing Stanford red for the
final time tonight. Patterson will
become the first four-year let
terman in Stanford basketball
history since Ron Tomsic in
1955.
Schweitzer enters tonight's
contest against the Bears as the
No. 1 all-time field goal percen
tage shooter in Stanford history.
He has made 462 of his 870 shots
for a .531 percentage to surpass
Rick Baker's mark of .523, set
over the 1964,65 and 67 seasons.
Simons, who has been on the
Farm for five years, saw his most
action this year, as he came off
the bench to spell guards Mike
Bratz and Wolfe Perry.
8-18 record
Dißiaso enters the final game
of his first year with an 8-18

mark overall. A win over Dick
Edwards' Golden Bears would
brighten his spirits considera
bly, as he jets around the country
trying to lure recruits here.
The Cards, with a 2-11 Pacific
Eight record, are locked into
seventh place even if they lose.
But a win might help erase the
memories of last Saturday's
"Maples Massacre" not to men
tion Cal's double-overtime,
89-85, win over Stanford in
January.
Surely you remember that
contest. The Cards were behind,
73-59, in one of the most lop
sided Pac-8 games NBC has ever
televised. But Stanford staged a
miraculous 14-point comeback
to tie the game at 73-all.
And can't you just see Mike
Bratz andPattersoir missing the
shots which would have given
Stanford a win?
Special occasion
Tonight will also be a very
special occasion in Harmon. Cal
will lose four seniors — forwards
Carl Bird (15.5 scoring avg.) and
Connie White (10.2 avg.); center
Jay Young (6.8 avg.) and guard
Rickie Hawthorne (13.1 avg.).
The four seniors are one of the
reasons Edwards is running up a
huge travel bill this year. They're

all starters, and three of them are
the team's leading scorers.
But they aren't leaving on a
happy note. After leading Cal to
a 14-11 season last year, the Gol
den Bears' best mark since their
NCAA runner-up team of 1900.
Cal has slipped to a 12-13 mark
(4-9 in the Pac-8).
So in a year in which Sports
Illustrated predicted that free
throws would replace free love
on Telegraph Avenue, the Bears
need a win to finish at the .500
mark.
'Haven't given up'
"1 really don't think the
players have given up," said
Edwards. "It's been a tough sea
son, this wasn't quite what we
expected in November."
kept USC in its place —
eighth — last Saturday, with a
96-5)4 win over the Trojans in
overtime. Hawthorne, who'll
probably make the all -
conference second team for the
fourth year in a row, scored a
career-high 37 points against
USC.
But the 6-foot-3 guard may not
be the only Bear who could go
wild in his final game. "Cal has
several players capable of explo
sive scoring," said Dißiaso.
The End.
