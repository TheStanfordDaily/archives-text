# Last hurrah for Card Seniors
## 
### 
Stanford seniors Ed Schweitzer, Tim Patterson and
Mike Simons will wear the Stanford red for the final
time tonight when the Cards travel to Berkeley for an 8
p.m. contest.
Schweitzer and Simons, who become three-year let
termen, have seen the Cards run up a 31-46 record.
Patterson, who will become the first Stanford four-year
Jetterman since Hon Tomsic, is 45-57.
But even last weekend's "Maples Debacle," a 46-point
loss to UCLA, can't take away their fond memories of the
"Maples Miracle," back-to-back wins over UCLA and
USC last year.
Schweitzer will finish as the third leading rebounder
and eighth leading scorer in Stanford history, He has
1114 career points and 683 rebounds.
"I can't say enough about what Ed has meant to our
team this year," said Coach Dick Dißiaso. "He's been a
consistently excellent player and a super team
leader . . . He's played to his maximum all year."
