# Dispatchers file suit over police 'harassment'
## 
### Jack Vaughn 
Two police-fire dispatchers have
filed a civil suit against the Santa Clara
County sheriff's office for alleged
harassment from Stanford police offi
cials. The dispatchers have also filed a
sex discrimination protest against
Stanford police Captain Raoul
Niemeyer.
The dispatchers, Stephanie Onufer
and Teresa Longworth, claim
Niemeyer threatened to arrest
Longworth during a dispute over mak
ing a police dispatch on Feb. 19.
Both dispatchers are members of the
United Stanford Employees (USE) and
have filed a grievance on the incident
with USE. Onufer said.
In turn, USE and the dispatchers
"have all filed grievances against Cap
tain Niemeyer" with Emil Sarpa direc
tor of personnel and employee rela
tions, according to Plant Services Di
rector Jason Mavis.
Onufer and Longworth work in the
police and fire building, but are

employes of the Department of Plant
Services.
Vehicle call
According to Onufer, the incident
began when William Starbuck, a desk
officer who screens police and fire
calls and orders dispatchers to assign
officers by radio, told her to send an
officer to a vehicle in the Cowell Clus
ter "with property damage only."
She said she made the dispatch, as
signing one of the two squad cars on
duty that night to the vehicle call at
Cowell.
The vehicle dispatch was "a minor
thing that could be taken care of at any
time," Onufer said. Because of this,
she said, she dispatched both the re
maining squad car and the car which
was originally dispatched to the vehi
cle to a burglar alarm at Encina Hall a
few minutes later.
"The procedure is that you always
direct both an officer and a back-up
unit to a burglary," Onufer said. Thus,
"the full force was out" when a third
call, this time a burglar alarm in the
men's gym, came in a few minutes la
ter, she said.
At that time, Onufer redispatched
the first police unit to the men's gym,
she said.
Starbuck's call
"I went out of the room to make a call
and while I was out, Officer Starbuck
phoned the other dispatcher
(Longworth) and asked what hap
pened to the vehicle," Onufer said.
Longworth said she checked the re
cord of dispatches and told Starbuck
an officer had already been sent and
and that she would not remake the
dispatch.
"You don't reassign officers" to calls
for which they already have assign
ments, Longworth said. "We assume
the officers are smart enough to know
that after they go to their higher
priority call, they have to go back to
their original assignment."
Longworth noted that the officer
originally assigned to the Cowell vehi
cle call radioed that "he had gotten
there (to the vehicle) when Starbuck
called me."
'Static'
Longworth said Niemeyer was "sit
ting up there waiting" at Starbuck's
desk during the phone call. Starbuck
"gave her (Longworth) some static"
about making the original dispatch,
Onufer said, and Niemeyer called the
two dispatchers' supervisor, Dola
West of Plant Services, asking her to
come to the police-fire building.
Onufer said that Niemeyer, Starbuck
and West came into the dispatching
room a few minutes later and con
fronted the two dispatchers.
She said Niemeyer asked Longworth
why she had not made the dispatch.
When Onufer attempted to show
Niemeyer cards which recorded the
original dispatch, "He said. 'Get away
from me — I don't even want to talk to
you,' " Onufer said.
Longworth then "asked for her
union representative" and Niemeyer
refused, "in direct violation of our

union contract." Onufer said.
Niemeyer also "threatened to arrest
Terri (Longworth) for P.C. (California
Penal Code section) 148 — interfering
with a peace officer in the performance
of his duty" if she did not make the
dispatch, said Onufer.
Both dispatchers said Niemeyer did
not arrest Longworth, but eventually
left the dispatching room with Star
buck and West. Onufer said Niemeyer
brought the others into the room as
"witnesses."
Longworth said she doesn't know
how either Niemeyer or Starbuck got
the idea that no dispatch had been
made to the vehicle call.
According to Mavis, Sarpa is setting
up a hearing on the dispatchers' grie
vance, and has "asked me to serve as
hearing officer." For that reason and
because he said he has "no personal
knowledge of the facts" in the inci
dent, Mavis said he could not com
ment on the matter.
USE Officer Roger Hardy said USE
has requested the tapes of radio con
versations from Feb. 19 to prove
Onufer made the original call, but
Mavis has refused to turn any tapes
over to USE.
'Pending litigation'
Niemeyer also declined to comment
on the incident. "I'd really like to
comment, but the matter is in pending

litigation and I just can't," he said.
Niemeyer did say that he has "abso
lutely not" been harassing the two
dispatchers and that he is "just trying
to afford the campus community the
best police service possible" as field
captain.
"When the facts come out, they are
going to blow this thing sky high,"
Niemeyer.
Neither Starbuck nor West could be
reached for comment, but Plant Ser
vices Supervisor Edna Barnes said
West would have to defer to Mavis for
public comment.
Strained relations
Niemeyer, Onufer and Longworth
all affirmed that relations between the
dispatchers as a group and the police
department have been strained for
some time.
Commenting that he has been "very
frustrated" in trying to improve police
services during his IV2 years here,
Niemeyer said "the communications
area" is not providing the best police
service possible.
He emphasized that he was referring
to the system and not to any particular
employes.
Niemeyer said he and Police Chief
Marvin Herrington "pioneered the
desk officer program because of the
problems with the whole system" of
having non-police persons to handle
police problems," Niemeyer said.
"There are problems in this jurisdic
tion that only those in the field know."
Longworth said she and Onufer
have passed the Santa Clara County
police dispatchers' exam, certifying
their ability to handle police and fire
emergency calls.
According to Onufer, police officials
"just don't like us here. They want to
take over our office. We've known this
for years."
'Infringement'
Onufer said putting a desk officer on
duty to screen calls is the "first in
fringement" in a program to "phase us
out."
Onufer and Longworth said they are
surveying the Santa Clara and San

Mateo County sheriff's offices to de
termine dispatching practices there.
Longworth said their research so far
indicates that "at no time" does a desk
officer "tell the dispatchers what to
do."
Onufer said it is "more common
than uncommon" for dispatchers to
work for a separate agency from the
police department.
She noted that she and Longworth
have repeatedly complained to their
supervisors about Niemeyer and other
police officials but that the supervisors
"don't even bother to interview our
witnesses."
Onufer added that complaints to
Mavis have been rerouted to Her
rington with no action taken.
Herrington refused to comment on
the matter.

The sex discrimination complaint,
filed with the federal Office of Equal
Employment Opportunity, charges
that Niemeyer has harassed both dis
patchers and that he has treated them
differently from male dispatchers.
Longworth said there are currently
three male and three female dispatch
ers. Five of the dispatchers are USE
members, she said.
In addition to the civil suit, dis
crimination protest and USE grie
vance, Longworth and Onufer have
filed a complaint with the Sheriff's In
ternal Affairs Division in San Jose,
Longworth said.
"We got a reply back from them re
ferring the matter to Herrington,"
Longworth said. "We're not satisfied
with the reply and we'll be filing a
counter-complaint."

surveying the Santa Clara and San

Mateo County sheriff's offices to de
termine dispatching practices there.
Longworth said their research so far
indicates that "at no time" does a desk
officer "tell the dispatchers what to
do."
Onufer said it is "more common
than uncommon" for dispatchers to
work for a separate agency from the
police department.
She noted that she and Longworth
have repeatedly complained to their
supervisors about Niemeyer and other
police officials but that the supervisors
"don't even bother to interview our
witnesses."
Onufer added that complaints to
Mavis have been rerouted to Her
rington with no action taken.
Herrington refused to comment on
the matter.

The sex discrimination complaint,
filed with the federal Office of Equal
Employment Opportunity, charges
that Niemeyer has harassed both dis
patchers and that he has treated them
differently from male dispatchers.
Longworth said there are currently
three male and three female dispatch
ers. Five of the dispatchers are USE
members, she said.
In addition to the civil suit, dis
crimination protest and USE grie
vance, Longworth and Onufer have
filed a complaint with the Sheriff's In
ternal Affairs Division in San Jose,
Longworth said.
"We got a reply back from them re
ferring the matter to Herrington,"
Longworth said. "We're not satisfied
with the reply and we'll be filing a
counter-complaint."
Two police-fire dispatchers have
filed a civil suit against the Santa Clara
County sheriff's office for alleged
harassment from Stanford police offi
cials. The dispatchers have also filed a
sex discrimination protest against
Stanford police Captain Raoul
Niemeyer.
The dispatchers, Stephanie Onufer
and Teresa Longworth, claim
Niemeyer threatened to arrest
Longworth during a dispute over mak
ing a police dispatch on Feb. 19.
Both dispatchers are members of the
United Stanford Employees (USE) and
have filed a grievance on the incident
with USE. Onufer said.
In turn, USE and the dispatchers
"have all filed grievances against Cap
tain Niemeyer" with Emil Sarpa direc
tor of personnel and employee rela
tions, according to Plant Services Di
rector Jason Mavis.
Onufer and Longworth work in the
police and fire building, but are

employes of the Department of Plant
Services.
Vehicle call
According to Onufer, the incident
began when William Starbuck, a desk
officer who screens police and fire
calls and orders dispatchers to assign
officers by radio, told her to send an
officer to a vehicle in the Cowell Clus
ter "with property damage only."
She said she made the dispatch, as
signing one of the two squad cars on
duty that night to the vehicle call at
Cowell.
The vehicle dispatch was "a minor
thing that could be taken care of at any
time," Onufer said. Because of this,
she said, she dispatched both the re
maining squad car and the car which
was originally dispatched to the vehi
cle to a burglar alarm at Encina Hall a
few minutes later.
"The procedure is that you always
direct both an officer and a back-up
unit to a burglary," Onufer said. Thus,
"the full force was out" when a third
call, this time a burglar alarm in the
men's gym, came in a few minutes la
ter, she said.
At that time, Onufer redispatched
the first police unit to the men's gym,
she said.
Starbuck's call
"I went out of the room to make a call
and while I was out, Officer Starbuck
phoned the other dispatcher
(Longworth) and asked what hap
pened to the vehicle," Onufer said.
Longworth said she checked the re
cord of dispatches and told Starbuck
an officer had already been sent and
and that she would not remake the
dispatch.
"You don't reassign officers" to calls
for which they already have assign
ments, Longworth said. "We assume
the officers are smart enough to know
that after they go to their higher
priority call, they have to go back to
their original assignment."
Longworth noted that the officer
originally assigned to the Cowell vehi
cle call radioed that "he had gotten
there (to the vehicle) when Starbuck
called me."
'Static'
Longworth said Niemeyer was "sit
ting up there waiting" at Starbuck's
desk during the phone call. Starbuck
"gave her (Longworth) some static"
about making the original dispatch,
Onufer said, and Niemeyer called the
two dispatchers' supervisor, Dola
West of Plant Services, asking her to
come to the police-fire building.
Onufer said that Niemeyer, Starbuck
and West came into the dispatching
room a few minutes later and con
fronted the two dispatchers.
She said Niemeyer asked Longworth
why she had not made the dispatch.
When Onufer attempted to show
Niemeyer cards which recorded the
original dispatch, "He said. 'Get away
from me — I don't even want to talk to
you,' " Onufer said.
Longworth then "asked for her
union representative" and Niemeyer
refused, "in direct violation of our

union contract." Onufer said.
Niemeyer also "threatened to arrest
Terri (Longworth) for P.C. (California
Penal Code section) 148 — interfering
with a peace officer in the performance
of his duty" if she did not make the
dispatch, said Onufer.
Both dispatchers said Niemeyer did
not arrest Longworth, but eventually
left the dispatching room with Star
buck and West. Onufer said Niemeyer
brought the others into the room as
"witnesses."
Longworth said she doesn't know
how either Niemeyer or Starbuck got
the idea that no dispatch had been
made to the vehicle call.
According to Mavis, Sarpa is setting
up a hearing on the dispatchers' grie
vance, and has "asked me to serve as
hearing officer." For that reason and
because he said he has "no personal
knowledge of the facts" in the inci
dent, Mavis said he could not com
ment on the matter.
USE Officer Roger Hardy said USE
has requested the tapes of radio con
versations from Feb. 19 to prove
Onufer made the original call, but
Mavis has refused to turn any tapes
over to USE.
'Pending litigation'
Niemeyer also declined to comment
on the incident. "I'd really like to
comment, but the matter is in pending

litigation and I just can't," he said.
Niemeyer did say that he has "abso
lutely not" been harassing the two
dispatchers and that he is "just trying
to afford the campus community the
best police service possible" as field
captain.
"When the facts come out, they are
going to blow this thing sky high,"
Niemeyer.
Neither Starbuck nor West could be
reached for comment, but Plant Ser
vices Supervisor Edna Barnes said
West would have to defer to Mavis for
public comment.
Strained relations
Niemeyer, Onufer and Longworth
all affirmed that relations between the
dispatchers as a group and the police
department have been strained for
some time.
Commenting that he has been "very
frustrated" in trying to improve police
services during his IV2 years here,
Niemeyer said "the communications
area" is not providing the best police
service possible.
He emphasized that he was referring
to the system and not to any particular
employes.
Niemeyer said he and Police Chief
Marvin Herrington "pioneered the
desk officer program because of the
problems with the whole system" of
having non-police persons to handle
police problems," Niemeyer said.
"There are problems in this jurisdic
tion that only those in the field know."
Longworth said she and Onufer
have passed the Santa Clara County
police dispatchers' exam, certifying
their ability to handle police and fire
emergency calls.
According to Onufer, police officials
"just don't like us here. They want to
take over our office. We've known this
for years."
'Infringement'
Onufer said putting a desk officer on
duty to screen calls is the "first in
fringement" in a program to "phase us
out."
Onufer and Longworth said they are
surveying the Santa Clara and San

Mateo County sheriff's offices to de
termine dispatching practices there.
Longworth said their research so far
indicates that "at no time" does a desk
officer "tell the dispatchers what to
do."
Onufer said it is "more common
than uncommon" for dispatchers to
work for a separate agency from the
police department.

Neither Starbuck nor West could be
reached for comment, but Plant Ser
vices Supervisor Edna Barnes said
West would have to defer to Mavis for
public comment.
Strained relations
Niemeyer, Onufer and Longworth
all affirmed that relations between the
dispatchers as a group and the police
department have been strained for
some time.
Commenting that he has been "very
frustrated" in trying to improve police
services during his IV2 years here,
Niemeyer said "the communications
area" is not providing the best police
service possible.
He emphasized that he was referring
to the system and not to any particular
employes.
Niemeyer said he and Police Chief
Marvin Herrington "pioneered the
desk officer program because of the
problems with the whole system" of
having non-police persons to handle
police problems," Niemeyer said.
"There are problems in this jurisdic
tion that only those in the field know."
Longworth said she and Onufer
have passed the Santa Clara County
police dispatchers' exam, certifying
their ability to handle police and fire
emergency calls.
According to Onufer, police officials
"just don't like us here. They want to
take over our office. We've known this
for years."
'Infringement'
Onufer said putting a desk officer on
duty to screen calls is the "first in
fringement" in a program to "phase us
out."
Onufer and Longworth said they are
surveying the Santa Clara and San

Mateo County sheriff's offices to de
termine dispatching practices there.
Longworth said their research so far
indicates that "at no time" does a desk
officer "tell the dispatchers what to
do."
Onufer said it is "more common
than uncommon" for dispatchers to
work for a separate agency from the
police department.
She noted that she and Longworth
have repeatedly complained to their
supervisors about Niemeyer and other
police officials but that the supervisors
"don't even bother to interview our
witnesses."
Onufer added that complaints to
Mavis have been rerouted to Her
rington with no action taken.
Herrington refused to comment on
the matter.

The sex discrimination complaint,
filed with the federal Office of Equal
Employment Opportunity, charges
that Niemeyer has harassed both dis
patchers and that he has treated them
differently from male dispatchers.
Longworth said there are currently
three male and three female dispatch
ers. Five of the dispatchers are USE
members, she said.
In addition to the civil suit, dis
crimination protest and USE grie
vance, Longworth and Onufer have
filed a complaint with the Sheriff's In
ternal Affairs Division in San Jose,
Longworth said.
"We got a reply back from them re
ferring the matter to Herrington,"
Longworth said. "We're not satisfied
with the reply and we'll be filing a
counter-complaint."
Two police-fire dispatchers have
filed a civil suit against the Santa Clara
County sheriff's office for alleged
harassment from Stanford police offi
cials. The dispatchers have also filed a
sex discrimination protest against
Stanford police Captain Raoul
Niemeyer.
The dispatchers, Stephanie Onufer
and Teresa Longworth, claim
Niemeyer threatened to arrest
Longworth during a dispute over mak
ing a police dispatch on Feb. 19.
Both dispatchers are members of the
United Stanford Employees (USE) and
have filed a grievance on the incident
with USE. Onufer said.
In turn, USE and the dispatchers
"have all filed grievances against Cap
tain Niemeyer" with Emil Sarpa direc
tor of personnel and employee rela
tions, according to Plant Services Di
rector Jason Mavis.
Onufer and Longworth work in the
police and fire building, but are

employes of the Department of Plant
Services.
Vehicle call
According to Onufer, the incident
began when William Starbuck, a desk
officer who screens police and fire
calls and orders dispatchers to assign
officers by radio, told her to send an
officer to a vehicle in the Cowell Clus
ter "with property damage only."
She said she made the dispatch, as
signing one of the two squad cars on
duty that night to the vehicle call at
Cowell.
The vehicle dispatch was "a minor
thing that could be taken care of at any
time," Onufer said. Because of this,
she said, she dispatched both the re
maining squad car and the car which
was originally dispatched to the vehi
cle to a burglar alarm at Encina Hall a
few minutes later.
"The procedure is that you always
direct both an officer and a back-up
unit to a burglary," Onufer said. Thus,
"the full force was out" when a third
call, this time a burglar alarm in the
men's gym, came in a few minutes la
ter, she said.
At that time, Onufer redispatched
the first police unit to the men's gym,
she said.
Starbuck's call
"I went out of the room to make a call
and while I was out, Officer Starbuck
phoned the other dispatcher
(Longworth) and asked what hap
pened to the vehicle," Onufer said.
Longworth said she checked the re
cord of dispatches and told Starbuck
an officer had already been sent and
and that she would not remake the
dispatch.
"You don't reassign officers" to calls
for which they already have assign
ments, Longworth said. "We assume
the officers are smart enough to know
that after they go to their higher
priority call, they have to go back to
their original assignment."
Longworth noted that the officer
originally assigned to the Cowell vehi
cle call radioed that "he had gotten
there (to the vehicle) when Starbuck
called me."
'Static'
Longworth said Niemeyer was "sit
ting up there waiting" at Starbuck's
desk during the phone call. Starbuck
"gave her (Longworth) some static"
about making the original dispatch,
Onufer said, and Niemeyer called the
two dispatchers' supervisor, Dola
West of Plant Services, asking her to
come to the police-fire building.
Onufer said that Niemeyer, Starbuck
and West came into the dispatching
room a few minutes later and con
fronted the two dispatchers.
She said Niemeyer asked Longworth
why she had not made the dispatch.
When Onufer attempted to show
Niemeyer cards which recorded the
original dispatch, "He said. 'Get away
from me — I don't even want to talk to
you,' " Onufer said.
Longworth then "asked for her
union representative" and Niemeyer
refused, "in direct violation of our

union contract." Onufer said.
Niemeyer also "threatened to arrest
Terri (Longworth) for P.C. (California
Penal Code section) 148 — interfering
with a peace officer in the performance
of his duty" if she did not make the
dispatch, said Onufer.
Both dispatchers said Niemeyer did
not arrest Longworth, but eventually
left the dispatching room with Star
buck and West. Onufer said Niemeyer
brought the others into the room as
"witnesses."
Longworth said she doesn't know
how either Niemeyer or Starbuck got
the idea that no dispatch had been
made to the vehicle call.
According to Mavis, Sarpa is setting
up a hearing on the dispatchers' grie
vance, and has "asked me to serve as
hearing officer." For that reason and
because he said he has "no personal
knowledge of the facts" in the inci
dent, Mavis said he could not com
ment on the matter.
USE Officer Roger Hardy said USE
has requested the tapes of radio con
versations from Feb. 19 to prove
Onufer made the original call, but
Mavis has refused to turn any tapes
over to USE.
'Pending litigation'
Niemeyer also declined to comment
on the incident. "I'd really like to
comment, but the matter is in pending

litigation and I just can't," he said.
Niemeyer did say that he has "abso
lutely not" been harassing the two
dispatchers and that he is "just trying
to afford the campus community the
best police service possible" as field
captain.
"When the facts come out, they are
going to blow this thing sky high,"
Niemeyer.
Neither Starbuck nor West could be
reached for comment, but Plant Ser
vices Supervisor Edna Barnes said
West would have to defer to Mavis for
public comment.

dispatch, said Onufer.
Both dispatchers said Niemeyer did
not arrest Longworth, but eventually
left the dispatching room with Star
buck and West. Onufer said Niemeyer
brought the others into the room as
"witnesses."
Longworth said she doesn't know
how either Niemeyer or Starbuck got
the idea that no dispatch had been
made to the vehicle call.
According to Mavis, Sarpa is setting
up a hearing on the dispatchers' grie
vance, and has "asked me to serve as
hearing officer." For that reason and
because he said he has "no personal
knowledge of the facts" in the inci
dent, Mavis said he could not com
ment on the matter.
USE Officer Roger Hardy said USE
has requested the tapes of radio con
versations from Feb. 19 to prove
Onufer made the original call, but
Mavis has refused to turn any tapes
over to USE.
'Pending litigation'
Niemeyer also declined to comment
on the incident. "I'd really like to
comment, but the matter is in pending

litigation and I just can't," he said.
Niemeyer did say that he has "abso
lutely not" been harassing the two
dispatchers and that he is "just trying
to afford the campus community the
best police service possible" as field
captain.
"When the facts come out, they are
going to blow this thing sky high,"
Niemeyer.
Neither Starbuck nor West could be
reached for comment, but Plant Ser
vices Supervisor Edna Barnes said
West would have to defer to Mavis for
public comment.
Strained relations
Niemeyer, Onufer and Longworth
all affirmed that relations between the
dispatchers as a group and the police
department have been strained for
some time.
Commenting that he has been "very
frustrated" in trying to improve police
services during his IV2 years here,
Niemeyer said "the communications
area" is not providing the best police
service possible.
He emphasized that he was referring
to the system and not to any particular
employes.
Niemeyer said he and Police Chief
Marvin Herrington "pioneered the
desk officer program because of the
problems with the whole system" of
having non-police persons to handle
police problems," Niemeyer said.
"There are problems in this jurisdic
tion that only those in the field know."
Longworth said she and Onufer
have passed the Santa Clara County
police dispatchers' exam, certifying
their ability to handle police and fire
emergency calls.
According to Onufer, police officials
"just don't like us here. They want to
take over our office. We've known this
for years."
'Infringement'
Onufer said putting a desk officer on
duty to screen calls is the "first in
fringement" in a program to "phase us
out."
Onufer and Longworth said they are
surveying the Santa Clara and San

Mateo County sheriff's offices to de
termine dispatching practices there.
Longworth said their research so far
indicates that "at no time" does a desk
officer "tell the dispatchers what to
do."
Onufer said it is "more common
than uncommon" for dispatchers to
work for a separate agency from the
police department.
She noted that she and Longworth
have repeatedly complained to their
supervisors about Niemeyer and other
police officials but that the supervisors
"don't even bother to interview our
witnesses."
Onufer added that complaints to
Mavis have been rerouted to Her
rington with no action taken.
Herrington refused to comment on
the matter.

The sex discrimination complaint,
filed with the federal Office of Equal
Employment Opportunity, charges
that Niemeyer has harassed both dis
patchers and that he has treated them
differently from male dispatchers.
Longworth said there are currently
three male and three female dispatch
ers. Five of the dispatchers are USE
members, she said.
In addition to the civil suit, dis
crimination protest and USE grie
vance, Longworth and Onufer have
filed a complaint with the Sheriff's In
ternal Affairs Division in San Jose,
Longworth said.
"We got a reply back from them re
ferring the matter to Herrington,"
Longworth said. "We're not satisfied
with the reply and we'll be filing a
counter-complaint."
Two police-fire dispatchers have
filed a civil suit against the Santa Clara
County sheriff's office for alleged
harassment from Stanford police offi
cials. The dispatchers have also filed a
sex discrimination protest against
Stanford police Captain Raoul
Niemeyer.
The dispatchers, Stephanie Onufer
and Teresa Longworth, claim
Niemeyer threatened to arrest
Longworth during a dispute over mak
ing a police dispatch on Feb. 19.
Both dispatchers are members of the
United Stanford Employees (USE) and
have filed a grievance on the incident
with USE. Onufer said.
In turn, USE and the dispatchers
"have all filed grievances against Cap
tain Niemeyer" with Emil Sarpa direc
tor of personnel and employee rela
tions, according to Plant Services Di
rector Jason Mavis.
Onufer and Longworth work in the
police and fire building, but are

employes of the Department of Plant
Services.
Vehicle call
According to Onufer, the incident
began when William Starbuck, a desk
officer who screens police and fire
calls and orders dispatchers to assign
officers by radio, told her to send an
officer to a vehicle in the Cowell Clus
ter "with property damage only."
She said she made the dispatch, as
signing one of the two squad cars on
duty that night to the vehicle call at
Cowell.
The vehicle dispatch was "a minor
thing that could be taken care of at any
time," Onufer said. Because of this,
she said, she dispatched both the re
maining squad car and the car which
was originally dispatched to the vehi
cle to a burglar alarm at Encina Hall a
few minutes later.
"The procedure is that you always
direct both an officer and a back-up
unit to a burglary," Onufer said. Thus,
"the full force was out" when a third
call, this time a burglar alarm in the
men's gym, came in a few minutes la
ter, she said.
At that time, Onufer redispatched
the first police unit to the men's gym,
she said.
Starbuck's call
"I went out of the room to make a call
and while I was out, Officer Starbuck
phoned the other dispatcher
(Longworth) and asked what hap
pened to the vehicle," Onufer said.
Longworth said she checked the re
cord of dispatches and told Starbuck
an officer had already been sent and
and that she would not remake the
dispatch.
"You don't reassign officers" to calls
for which they already have assign
ments, Longworth said. "We assume
the officers are smart enough to know
that after they go to their higher
priority call, they have to go back to
their original assignment."
Longworth noted that the officer
originally assigned to the Cowell vehi
cle call radioed that "he had gotten
there (to the vehicle) when Starbuck
called me."
'Static'
Longworth said Niemeyer was "sit
ting up there waiting" at Starbuck's
desk during the phone call. Starbuck
"gave her (Longworth) some static"
about making the original dispatch,
Onufer said, and Niemeyer called the
two dispatchers' supervisor, Dola
West of Plant Services, asking her to
come to the police-fire building.
Onufer said that Niemeyer, Starbuck
and West came into the dispatching
room a few minutes later and con
fronted the two dispatchers.
She said Niemeyer asked Longworth
why she had not made the dispatch.
When Onufer attempted to show
Niemeyer cards which recorded the
original dispatch, "He said. 'Get away
from me — I don't even want to talk to
you,' " Onufer said.
Longworth then "asked for her
union representative" and Niemeyer
refused, "in direct violation of our

union contract." Onufer said.
Niemeyer also "threatened to arrest
Terri (Longworth) for P.C. (California
Penal Code section) 148 — interfering
with a peace officer in the performance
of his duty" if she did not make the
dispatch, said Onufer.
Both dispatchers said Niemeyer did
not arrest Longworth, but eventually
left the dispatching room with Star
buck and West. Onufer said Niemeyer
brought the others into the room as
"witnesses."
Longworth said she doesn't know
how either Niemeyer or Starbuck got
