Stanford, the school that was
one of the last to release the
names of its recruits, has also
finished last in the Pacific Eight
recruiting war â€” at least in
numbers. But several top grid
prospects, reportedly, were re
jected by the Department of Ad
missions.
Football coach Jack Christian
sen has received the names of 13
high school football players and
two junior college transfers on
letters of intent to attend Stan
ford.
Included among the group are
four high school AU-American
lineman and no quarterbacks.
"From a quality standpoint, this
is as good a group as we've had,"
said Christiansen. "We feel
we've signed four or five of the
best high school linemen in the
country."
Stanford signed 20 recruits
last year, but 15 starters return
next fall.
The Cards lost four starters to
graduation in the offensive line,
so it's no surprise that seven of

the recruits are offensive line
men. High school All -
Americans Brent Saylor, a
6-foot-5 260-pound offensive
tackle from Albany, Ore., and
Tom Katsaros, a 6-4 240-pound
guard from Covina, head the
group of linemen.
USC supposedly won the re
cruiting war,signing eight prep
All-Americans, including all
three Los Angeles City players of
the year. TheTrojans also signed
Tony Munoz, a 6-6, 280-pound
prep Ail-American defensive
lineman.
California coach Mike White,
who with Christiansen is now
the senior coach in the confer
ence, signed 26 recruits.
Here is Stanford's list of re
cruits:
Cordon Banks 5-11 180 RB
Loyola High School, Los
Angeles
David Baum 6-2 185 WR
Alhambra High School, Mar
tinez
Pat Bowe 6-6 215 TE
