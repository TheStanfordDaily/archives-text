# Tracksters seek second win
## 
### 
Coming oil an impressive
season-opening win over
Hayward State and Santa
Clara last weekend, Stan
ford's track team can equal its
number of wins last year,
with a victory over Fresno
State tomorrow at 1:15 p.m. in
the Bulldogs' Radcliff
Stadium.
Coach Payton Jordan
opened his 20th year on the
Farm with style last weekend,
posting a 116-77-9 triangular
meet victory over Hayward
and Santa Clara.
Last year the (lards won just
two meets, including a 91-72
win over Fresno State. Stan
ford has a 27-1 lead over the
Bulldogs in the series.
"We expect the meet to be a
lot closer this year," said Jor
dan. "Fresno State is an im
proved team and they'd really
love to win this one."
Last week Stanford won 13
events, including both relays
and all the distance events.
And the distance events fi
gure to be even stronger this
week, as lung busters Tony
Sandoval and Roy Kissen
make their season debuts for
the Cards.
