Men netters win
The Stanford men's tennis
team upped its season dual
match record to 2-1 with an 8-1
victory over Southwest
Louisiana Wednesday on the
Varsity Courts.
The Cards, who cannot afford
to lose any more players after
surrendering Nick Saviano to
the pros last week, received a
scare in the match, when
freshman John Rast twisted his
ankle going for a wide ball.
It had been feared that Rast
broke the ankle, but x-rays re
vealed only a sprain. "It could
heal very quickly, but it could be
longer," cautioned coach Dick
Gould. "It looks menacing, but
it's OK. The doctor says he can
start spring practice Mar. 24."
Stanford does not have
another dual match until April 1
at USC.
Women netters win
The Stanford women's tennis

team annihilated Stanislaus
State 8-1, in its first dual match
of the season Wednesday on the
Varsity Courts.
Not counting No. 1 singles, in
which Stanford's Liza Pande lost
to Debbie Brink in three sets, the
Cards won 96 games and lost
two. Stanislaus State did not win
one single game in the three
doubles matches. About the only
thing Stanislaus State did not
lose was its sanity. And Stanford
didn't even use its top five sing
les players: Lele Forood, Barb
Jordan, Susie Hagey, Diane Mor
rison and Mercy O'Keefe.
The Cards' next dual match
will be April 1 against UC-Davis
at Stanford.
Women golfers win
The Stanford women's golf
team opened its season with a
first place finish in the NCIAC
tournament yesterday. The
Cards finished with a 317, 65
strokes ahead of second-place

finisher Santa Clara's 382.
