# Freshman plays football, baseball
## Reynolds: two sport star 
### David Georgette 
Galloping down the sidelines
last November. USC tailback
Ricky Bell seemed ready to put
the Trojans into the lead. Only
one Stanford defender had a
chance to catch the juggernaut
on his 64-yard jaunt.
At the last possible moment,
Larry Reynolds, a Card freshman
cornerback, lunged and tripped
up Bell. SC fumbled at the Stan
ford one-yard line on the next
play and theCards had survived.
During the winter and spring,
Reynolds doesn't pursue be
hemoth football running backs.
He spends his time patrolling
center field for coach Kay
Young's Stanford baseball team.
First love
Baseball is Reynolds' first
love. "I could play baseball all
year," said Reynolds. And that's
one of the reasons the Corvallis,
Ore., native chose Stanford, in
stead of following in his
brother's footsteps to the Uni
versity of Oregon. Don. his older
brother, is now playing profes
sional baseball, after starting in
football and baseball for the
Ducks.
With all the rain in Eugene,
Ore., the baseball season is just
too short for his liking, "i had to
play baseball wherever 1 went to
college," said Reynolds. Here,
unlike some other schools, the
weather and football coaches
allow him to follow his wishes.

Reynolds' goal is stated with
out boast, "1 want to play profes
sional baseball." The Minnesota
Twins offered him as2o,oo(k:on
tract while he was still a prep.
But the youngster decided to opt
for the red and white of Stanford.
"I was excited about it (the

contract). But they didn't offer
me enough for a high school
player," said Reynolds. "You
have to prove yourself in the
minor leagues.so vvhv not do it
in college, where you have other
alternatives open to vou?"
Low-key approach
Reynolds' performance on the
football field illustrates one such
option. He takes a very low-key
approach to his football ac

complishments. "I came here
with the attitude of just making
the varsity squad. I'm glad I had
the opportunity. I was lucky."
said Reynolds.
Defensive backlield coach
Willie Shaw is a bit more
explicit, "harry turned out to he
one ot the best prospects we've
had hen ; in a long time. 1 le's just
the kind of player who has a
great mental attitude and physi
cal ability," said Shaw.
"The coaches around the
league felt In; was one of the best
freshman cornerbacks in the
l'ac-8," added Shaw.
Wide receiver Tony Hill, who
perfects his pass routes against
Reynolds in football practice
every day, concurs. "He's got ex
cellent speed and a lot of abil
ity."
I'unt returner
Punt returning is another
phase of football in which
Reynolds excel Is. "There's a lot
of pressure on catching the punt
the team's depending on
you," lie said. "But I like it. be
cause it gives me a chance to
play some offense."
Reynolds last year returned
10 punts for <>3 yards, a (».3 aver
age. He had 2:i tackles and one
interception, which he returned
36 yards.
But why does such a promis
ing football player seek his for
tune in baseball? "I'm more
baseball oriented," said
Reynolds. "1 like football a lot,
but I've played baseball since 1
was real young. I sort of grew up
with it."
Reynolds was aninfielder
until lie came to Stanford. But
with all of the infield slots filled,
he's moved to the outfield, he
cause Stanford needs his offen
sive spark in the line-up.
New position
I le sees his new position as an
advantage. "1 like playing the
outfield. It gives me an oppor
tunity to concern myself with
hitting, because I don't have to
worry so much about fielding."
As the lead-off hitter in the
Card line-up, he tries to "get on
base any way 1 can." Young says
that Reynolds' speed, "gives us a
chance to set the tone of the
game, which in our program is a
running game."
Young adds, "He's an excel
lent hitter, and does a great job
defensively. We expect him to be
an excellent performer. He gives
100 percent all the time, just like
the rest of the team."
Reynolds is happy with the
coaching philosophy at Stan
ford. "One of the reasons I like
both sports so much is because
the coaches don't put pressure
on you. That way it's easier to
reach your potential."

the team's depending on
you," lie said. "But I like it. be
cause it gives me a chance to
play some offense."
Reynolds last year returned
10 punts for <>3 yards, a (».3 aver
age. He had 2:i tackles and one
interception, which he returned
36 yards.
But why does such a promis
ing football player seek his for
tune in baseball? "I'm more
baseball oriented," said
Reynolds. "1 like football a lot,
but I've played baseball since 1
was real young. I sort of grew up
with it."
Reynolds was aninfielder
until lie came to Stanford. But
with all of the infield slots filled,
he's moved to the outfield, he
cause Stanford needs his offen
sive spark in the line-up.
New position
I le sees his new position as an
advantage. "1 like playing the
outfield. It gives me an oppor
tunity to concern myself with
hitting, because I don't have to
worry so much about fielding."
As the lead-off hitter in the
Card line-up, he tries to "get on
base any way 1 can." Young says
that Reynolds' speed, "gives us a
chance to set the tone of the
game, which in our program is a
running game."
Young adds, "He's an excel
lent hitter, and does a great job
defensively. We expect him to be
an excellent performer. He gives
100 percent all the time, just like
the rest of the team."
Reynolds is happy with the
coaching philosophy at Stan
ford. "One of the reasons I like
both sports so much is because
the coaches don't put pressure
on you. That way it's easier to
reach your potential."

Larry Reynolds
Galloping down the sidelines
last November. USC tailback
Ricky Bell seemed ready to put
the Trojans into the lead. Only
one Stanford defender had a
chance to catch the juggernaut
on his 64-yard jaunt.
At the last possible moment,
Larry Reynolds, a Card freshman
cornerback, lunged and tripped
up Bell. SC fumbled at the Stan
ford one-yard line on the next
play and theCards had survived.
During the winter and spring,
Reynolds doesn't pursue be
hemoth football running backs.
He spends his time patrolling
center field for coach Kay
Young's Stanford baseball team.
First love
Baseball is Reynolds' first
love. "I could play baseball all
year," said Reynolds. And that's
one of the reasons the Corvallis,
Ore., native chose Stanford, in
stead of following in his
brother's footsteps to the Uni
versity of Oregon. Don. his older
brother, is now playing profes
sional baseball, after starting in
football and baseball for the
Ducks.
With all the rain in Eugene,
Ore., the baseball season is just
too short for his liking, "i had to
play baseball wherever 1 went to
college," said Reynolds. Here,
unlike some other schools, the
weather and football coaches
allow him to follow his wishes.

Reynolds' goal is stated with
out boast, "1 want to play profes
sional baseball." The Minnesota
Twins offered him as2o,oo(k:on
tract while he was still a prep.
But the youngster decided to opt
for the red and white of Stanford.
"I was excited about it (the

contract). But they didn't offer
me enough for a high school
player," said Reynolds. "You
have to prove yourself in the
minor leagues.so vvhv not do it
in college, where you have other
alternatives open to vou?"
Low-key approach
Reynolds' performance on the
football field illustrates one such
option. He takes a very low-key
approach to his football ac

complishments. "I came here
with the attitude of just making
the varsity squad. I'm glad I had
the opportunity. I was lucky."
said Reynolds.
Defensive backlield coach
Willie Shaw is a bit more
explicit, "harry turned out to he
one ot the best prospects we've
had hen ; in a long time. 1 le's just
the kind of player who has a
great mental attitude and physi
cal ability," said Shaw.
"The coaches around the
league felt In; was one of the best
freshman cornerbacks in the
l'ac-8," added Shaw.
Wide receiver Tony Hill, who
perfects his pass routes against
Reynolds in football practice
every day, concurs. "He's got ex
cellent speed and a lot of abil
ity."
I'unt returner
Punt returning is another
phase of football in which
Reynolds excel Is. "There's a lot
of pressure on catching the punt
the team's depending on
you," lie said. "But I like it. be
cause it gives me a chance to

too short for his liking, "i had to
play baseball wherever 1 went to
college," said Reynolds. Here,
unlike some other schools, the
weather and football coaches
allow him to follow his wishes.

Reynolds' goal is stated with
out boast, "1 want to play profes
sional baseball." The Minnesota
Twins offered him as2o,oo(k:on
tract while he was still a prep.
But the youngster decided to opt
for the red and white of Stanford.
"I was excited about it (the

contract). But they didn't offer
me enough for a high school
player," said Reynolds. "You
have to prove yourself in the
minor leagues.so vvhv not do it
in college, where you have other
alternatives open to vou?"
Low-key approach
Reynolds' performance on the
football field illustrates one such
option. He takes a very low-key
approach to his football ac

complishments. "I came here
with the attitude of just making
the varsity squad. I'm glad I had
the opportunity. I was lucky."
said Reynolds.
Defensive backlield coach
Willie Shaw is a bit more
explicit, "harry turned out to he
one ot the best prospects we've
had hen ; in a long time. 1 le's just
the kind of player who has a
great mental attitude and physi
cal ability," said Shaw.
"The coaches around the
league felt In; was one of the best
freshman cornerbacks in the
l'ac-8," added Shaw.
Wide receiver Tony Hill, who
perfects his pass routes against
Reynolds in football practice
every day, concurs. "He's got ex
cellent speed and a lot of abil
ity."
I'unt returner
Punt returning is another
phase of football in which
Reynolds excel Is. "There's a lot
of pressure on catching the punt
the team's depending on
you," lie said. "But I like it. be
cause it gives me a chance to
play some offense."
Reynolds last year returned
10 punts for <>3 yards, a (».3 aver
age. He had 2:i tackles and one
interception, which he returned
36 yards.
But why does such a promis
ing football player seek his for
tune in baseball? "I'm more
baseball oriented," said
Reynolds. "1 like football a lot,
but I've played baseball since 1
was real young. I sort of grew up
with it."
Reynolds was aninfielder
until lie came to Stanford. But
with all of the infield slots filled,
he's moved to the outfield, he
cause Stanford needs his offen
sive spark in the line-up.
New position
I le sees his new position as an
advantage. "1 like playing the
outfield. It gives me an oppor
tunity to concern myself with
hitting, because I don't have to
worry so much about fielding."
As the lead-off hitter in the
Card line-up, he tries to "get on
base any way 1 can." Young says
that Reynolds' speed, "gives us a
chance to set the tone of the
game, which in our program is a
running game."
Young adds, "He's an excel
lent hitter, and does a great job
defensively. We expect him to be
an excellent performer. He gives
100 percent all the time, just like
the rest of the team."
Reynolds is happy with the
coaching philosophy at Stan
ford. "One of the reasons I like
both sports so much is because
the coaches don't put pressure
on you. That way it's easier to
reach your potential."
