Blockade stirs trouble in Rhodesia
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Landlocked
Rhodesia faced potential shortages and economic hard
ship yesterday from Mozambique's "state of war" border
blockade cutting off half its outlets to the sea.
The white-ruled former British colony won no promise
of extra help from South Africa, now the only county
whose harbors it can use.
South African Prime Minister John Vorster said in
Capetown that Mozambique's border closure could esca
late into something "much more serious" because of
Cuban troops and Soviet arms in nearby Angola.
In Washington, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
warned Cuba against intervention in the new African dis
pute.
But Kissinger said the United States favors black major
ity rule in Rhodesia and added that time is running out for
the white minority regime.
Judge rules for and against Hearst
SAN FRANCISCO — Patricia Hearst's defense chalked
up one victory and one defeat yesterday in a battle over
documents which might link the heiress to a Sacramento
area bank robbery in which a woman was killed.
Chief defense attorney F. Lee Bailey failed in an effort to
throw out all documents seized from the last hideout of
Miss Hearst's fugitive traveling companions, William and
Emily Harris.
But Bailey won a ruling that barred the government
from admitting any items which might remind jurors of a
bank robbery in the Sacramento suburb of Carmichael, in
which a pregnant mother of four was slain.
More Palestinians enter Lebanon
BEIRUT, — Another 2000 Palestine Liberation Army
troops have entered Lebanon from Syria and have taken
up positions in the southern and eastern mountains, reli
able sources said yesterday.
Informants cited two possible reasons for arrival of
the additional PLA soldiers, who brought to 8500 the
number of regular Palestinian troops in this war-ravaged
country:
—Because Palestinian officials fear that Israel might be
planning a large attack on southern Lebanon to express
displeasure at the growing Palestinian military presence,
and

—To aid the 18,000-man Lebanese army in patrolling
Beirut's commercial center and other sensitive areas still
subject to kidnapings and holdups in the tough atmos
phere following 10 months of civil war.
Bayh pulls out, Mansfield to retire
WASHINGTON, D.C. — Birch Bayh all but left the
crowded Democratic presidential field yesterday and Sar
gent Shriver said he was considering it. Both said their
money, the crucial commodity that fuels all campaigns,
had begun to run out.
There was one other political dropout yesterday — Se
nate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, who announced in
Washington that he is retiring from politics after 34 years
in Congress.
Mansfield's Republican counterpart, Senate Minority
Leader Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, already has an
nounced he would retire when his current term expires in
January.
Meanwhile, four Democrats and Republicans Ronald
Reagan continued to stump for votes in Tuesday's Florida
primary, the next contest in the weekly political caravan.
Unions allowed on the farms
SAN FRANCISCO — Farm labor unions have a right to
go on growers' property to organize workers, the Califor
nia Supreme Court ruled yesterday.
The 4-3 decision upheld the validity of the state Ag
ricultural Labor Relations Board's regulation granting li
mited access to organizers. It reversed Fresno and Tulare
County Superior Court orders which had prohibited use of
the regulation.
Cesar Chavez, head of the United Farm Workers, praised
the decision, but said "what remains to be seen is whether
growers, sheriff's departments and rural vigilantes will
obey the law."
