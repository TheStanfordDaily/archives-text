# Former war correspondent runs grass roots campaign
## 
### Marc Zasada 
Richard Boyle, the last American
war correspondent to leave Cam
bodia and the last Democrat to file in
the race for San Francisco's sth state
senatorial district seat, talked with
students here about his years as a
journalist and his future as a politi
cian Feb. 25.
Born in 1942 to a federal labor or
ganizer in the City's Mission District,
Boyle became interested in jour
nalism in his high school years and
went on after graduation to modest
success working on various local
newspapers.
His sedate life might have con
tinued indefinitely if not for his in
volvement in Robert Kennedy's 1968
presidential campaign.
Kennedy's death affected him
deeply. Out of disillusionment,
boredom and curiosity he accepted a
war correspondent's position with
the Overseas Weekly and left for
Vietnam.
Surrealistic
There was a surrealistic quality
about those days in Saigon for Boyle,
and he remembers them fondly.
"1 liked Saigon a lot. We stayed in a
luxurious hotel, with a pool and ev
erything. Each day we would dress in
fatigues and drive out to the war after
lunch for a few hours, take some pic
turesand then return to the hotel fora
swim."
In 1969, Boyle went to My Lai to
investigate the reports of a massacre,

and the horrors he witnessed there
led him to grave doubts about Ameri
can involvement in Vietnam and his
own role as a newspaperman. He left
his job with the Weekly to work with
the Long Hoa, an underground
pacifist movement in South Vietnam.
Tiger cages
In December of that year, he set out
with the Long Hoa on a voyage up the
Mekong river to free prisoners from
the "tiger cages" of Con Son Island.
They were turned back by the South
Vietnamese army. After a Christmas
Eve peace demonstration in Saigon's
Kennedy Square, leaders of the Long
Hoa were arrested, and Boyle was
expelled from Vietnam by President
Nguyen Van Thieu.
In 1972 he made headlines by re
turning illegally to South Vietnam to
check out rumors of a mutiny by the
U.S. Infantry Company at Firebase
Pace, near the Cambodian border.
The rumors, he proved to the im
mense consternation of the Penta
gon, were true.
Between 1972 and 1975, he free
lanced as a war-correspondent in Is
rael, Cambodia, Beirut and Northern
Ireland. In Israel, during the Yom
Kippur war, he traveled with a con
tingent of the Israeli army, and again
he found war reporting rather unreal.
Tour guide
"The Israelis would pack all the
newsmen in an air conditioned bus
and drive us out to the front — a guy
would stand with a microphone and

act like a tour guide while the tanks
rolled past."
In March, 1975, he returned to In
dochina to witness the Khmer United
Front victory in Cambodia.
"For weeks we had watched the
battle-map shrinking and the sound
of artillery approaching. Then one
day the army came into the telegraph
office and said that a helicopter was
leaving in 15 minutes, and that that
was our last chance to get out (of
Phnom Penh).

"They also said that the Khmer
Rouge had vowed to cut off the heads
of any Americans they found. I de
cided to stay. I wanted to see how the
story would end. To leave would
have been like walking out before the
last act of a play." Of the 17 jour
nalists who elected to remain, Boyle
was the only American.
Drama ends
The drama ended at the French
Embassy in Phnom Penh, where the
few remaining foreigners had
gathered. "There wasn't any water or

toilet facilities, and hardly any food.
Just about the only thing we had was
cases of Jack Daniels and Vichy wa
ter. Have you ever tried to brush your
teeth with Vichy?"
Boyle was the last American to
cross the Thai-Cambodian border to
safety. Since that time, he has re
turned to San Francisco, where he is
embarking on a fledgling political
career.
The years of battling blind
bureaucracy, of pacifism and
idealism show plainly in the political
stance of Boyle, which is fundamen
tally liberal and anti-federalistic.
Grass roots
"There are too many bureaus and
bureaucrats" he complains, and says
that when he gets to Sacramento, the
first thing he will try to do is "get rid
of some of these agencies."
His basic appeal is to the so-called
"grass roots" public, who he says are
tired of professional politicians, and
who might be receptive to someone
unstained by political ties.
"Politics is too important to leave
to politicians," he says, lamenting
the apathy of the general public. "If
we don't get involved in politics, in
society, and something bad happens,
we're the only ones to blame."
Meager budget
Part of his "grass roots" appeal
will be the non-Madison Avenue ap
proach of his campaign. "I don't like
giving speeches that have been re
hearsed down to the last detail. I'm

going to come on as I am."
"Coming on as he is" will not be
too easy for Boyle on his meager
campaign budget of around $60,000
(one quarter of that available to his
opponents), but he is hopeful.
"My opponents haveall contracted
advertising agencies to sell them
selves — I haven't. I don't think the
slick agency approach is going to
work though; 1 think people are sick
of it . . . this will be a kind of test, to
see if you can win a campaign my
way."
He is hoping to debate his oppo
nents on the issue of campaign
spending, and possibly get them to
agree on a spending limit. He puts his
case as follows:
"When a candidate has a large
campaign fund and is elected, he will
probably owe a tremendous debt to
his contributors, and he has been ef
fectively bought by them."
Boyle's stand on the issues is emo
tionally "pro-people." As he expres
ses it on one campaign brochure: "In
flation is wiping out the laboring
man and woman's earnings. Un
employment is soaring. When we
need free medical care, better
schools, more child care centers and
jobs for people, the politicians are
voting themselves fat expense ac
counts, raises and free mailings of
their campaign literature."
At age 35, Boyle has apparently
seen enough of the world to want to
change it.

(one quarter of that available to his
opponents), but he is hopeful.
"My opponents haveall contracted
advertising agencies to sell them
selves — I haven't. I don't think the
slick agency approach is going to
work though; 1 think people are sick
of it . . . this will be a kind of test, to
see if you can win a campaign my
way."
He is hoping to debate his oppo
nents on the issue of campaign
spending, and possibly get them to
agree on a spending limit. He puts his
case as follows:
"When a candidate has a large
campaign fund and is elected, he will
probably owe a tremendous debt to
his contributors, and he has been ef
fectively bought by them."
Boyle's stand on the issues is emo
tionally "pro-people." As he expres
ses it on one campaign brochure: "In
flation is wiping out the laboring
man and woman's earnings. Un
employment is soaring. When we
need free medical care, better
schools, more child care centers and
jobs for people, the politicians are
voting themselves fat expense ac
counts, raises and free mailings of
their campaign literature."
At age 35, Boyle has apparently
seen enough of the world to want to
change it.

Richard Boyle
Richard Boyle, the last American
war correspondent to leave Cam
bodia and the last Democrat to file in
the race for San Francisco's sth state
senatorial district seat, talked with
students here about his years as a
journalist and his future as a politi
cian Feb. 25.
Born in 1942 to a federal labor or
ganizer in the City's Mission District,
Boyle became interested in jour
nalism in his high school years and
went on after graduation to modest
success working on various local
newspapers.
His sedate life might have con
tinued indefinitely if not for his in
volvement in Robert Kennedy's 1968
presidential campaign.
Kennedy's death affected him
deeply. Out of disillusionment,
boredom and curiosity he accepted a
war correspondent's position with
the Overseas Weekly and left for
Vietnam.
Surrealistic
There was a surrealistic quality
about those days in Saigon for Boyle,
and he remembers them fondly.
"1 liked Saigon a lot. We stayed in a
luxurious hotel, with a pool and ev
erything. Each day we would dress in
fatigues and drive out to the war after
lunch for a few hours, take some pic
turesand then return to the hotel fora
swim."
In 1969, Boyle went to My Lai to
investigate the reports of a massacre,

and the horrors he witnessed there
led him to grave doubts about Ameri
can involvement in Vietnam and his
own role as a newspaperman. He left
his job with the Weekly to work with
the Long Hoa, an underground
pacifist movement in South Vietnam.
Tiger cages
In December of that year, he set out
with the Long Hoa on a voyage up the
Mekong river to free prisoners from
the "tiger cages" of Con Son Island.
They were turned back by the South
Vietnamese army. After a Christmas
Eve peace demonstration in Saigon's
Kennedy Square, leaders of the Long
Hoa were arrested, and Boyle was
expelled from Vietnam by President
Nguyen Van Thieu.
In 1972 he made headlines by re
turning illegally to South Vietnam to
check out rumors of a mutiny by the
U.S. Infantry Company at Firebase
Pace, near the Cambodian border.
The rumors, he proved to the im
mense consternation of the Penta
gon, were true.
Between 1972 and 1975, he free
lanced as a war-correspondent in Is
rael, Cambodia, Beirut and Northern
Ireland. In Israel, during the Yom
Kippur war, he traveled with a con
tingent of the Israeli army, and again
he found war reporting rather unreal.
Tour guide
"The Israelis would pack all the
newsmen in an air conditioned bus
and drive us out to the front — a guy
would stand with a microphone and

act like a tour guide while the tanks
rolled past."
In March, 1975, he returned to In
dochina to witness the Khmer United
Front victory in Cambodia.
"For weeks we had watched the
battle-map shrinking and the sound
of artillery approaching. Then one
day the army came into the telegraph
office and said that a helicopter was
leaving in 15 minutes, and that that
was our last chance to get out (of
Phnom Penh).

"They also said that the Khmer
Rouge had vowed to cut off the heads
of any Americans they found. I de
cided to stay. I wanted to see how the
story would end. To leave would
have been like walking out before the
last act of a play." Of the 17 jour
nalists who elected to remain, Boyle
was the only American.
Drama ends
The drama ended at the French
Embassy in Phnom Penh, where the
few remaining foreigners had
gathered. "There wasn't any water or

toilet facilities, and hardly any food.
Just about the only thing we had was
cases of Jack Daniels and Vichy wa
ter. Have you ever tried to brush your
teeth with Vichy?"
Boyle was the last American to
cross the Thai-Cambodian border to
safety. Since that time, he has re
turned to San Francisco, where he is
embarking on a fledgling political
career.
The years of battling blind
bureaucracy, of pacifism and
idealism show plainly in the political
stance of Boyle, which is fundamen
tally liberal and anti-federalistic.
Grass roots
"There are too many bureaus and
bureaucrats" he complains, and says
that when he gets to Sacramento, the
first thing he will try to do is "get rid
of some of these agencies."
His basic appeal is to the so-called
"grass roots" public, who he says are
tired of professional politicians, and
who might be receptive to someone
unstained by political ties.
"Politics is too important to leave
to politicians," he says, lamenting
the apathy of the general public. "If
we don't get involved in politics, in
society, and something bad happens,
we're the only ones to blame."
Meager budget
Part of his "grass roots" appeal
will be the non-Madison Avenue ap
proach of his campaign. "I don't like
giving speeches that have been re
hearsed down to the last detail. I'm

going to come on as I am."
"Coming on as he is" will not be
too easy for Boyle on his meager
campaign budget of around $60,000
(one quarter of that available to his
opponents), but he is hopeful.
"My opponents haveall contracted
advertising agencies to sell them
selves — I haven't. I don't think the

safety. Since that time, he has re
turned to San Francisco, where he is
embarking on a fledgling political
career.
The years of battling blind
bureaucracy, of pacifism and
idealism show plainly in the political
stance of Boyle, which is fundamen
tally liberal and anti-federalistic.
Grass roots
"There are too many bureaus and
bureaucrats" he complains, and says
that when he gets to Sacramento, the
first thing he will try to do is "get rid
of some of these agencies."
His basic appeal is to the so-called
"grass roots" public, who he says are
tired of professional politicians, and
who might be receptive to someone
unstained by political ties.
"Politics is too important to leave
to politicians," he says, lamenting
the apathy of the general public. "If
we don't get involved in politics, in
society, and something bad happens,
we're the only ones to blame."
Meager budget
Part of his "grass roots" appeal
will be the non-Madison Avenue ap
proach of his campaign. "I don't like
giving speeches that have been re
hearsed down to the last detail. I'm

going to come on as I am."
"Coming on as he is" will not be
too easy for Boyle on his meager
campaign budget of around $60,000
(one quarter of that available to his
opponents), but he is hopeful.
"My opponents haveall contracted
advertising agencies to sell them
selves — I haven't. I don't think the
slick agency approach is going to
work though; 1 think people are sick
of it . . . this will be a kind of test, to
see if you can win a campaign my
way."
He is hoping to debate his oppo
nents on the issue of campaign
spending, and possibly get them to
agree on a spending limit. He puts his
case as follows:
"When a candidate has a large
campaign fund and is elected, he will
probably owe a tremendous debt to
his contributors, and he has been ef
fectively bought by them."
Boyle's stand on the issues is emo
tionally "pro-people." As he expres
ses it on one campaign brochure: "In
flation is wiping out the laboring
man and woman's earnings. Un
employment is soaring. When we
need free medical care, better
schools, more child care centers and
jobs for people, the politicians are
voting themselves fat expense ac
counts, raises and free mailings of
their campaign literature."
At age 35, Boyle has apparently
seen enough of the world to want to
change it.

Richard Boyle
Richard Boyle, the last American
war correspondent to leave Cam
bodia and the last Democrat to file in
the race for San Francisco's sth state
senatorial district seat, talked with
students here about his years as a
journalist and his future as a politi
cian Feb. 25.
Born in 1942 to a federal labor or
ganizer in the City's Mission District,
Boyle became interested in jour
nalism in his high school years and
went on after graduation to modest
success working on various local
newspapers.
His sedate life might have con
tinued indefinitely if not for his in
volvement in Robert Kennedy's 1968
presidential campaign.
Kennedy's death affected him
deeply. Out of disillusionment,
boredom and curiosity he accepted a
war correspondent's position with
the Overseas Weekly and left for
Vietnam.
Surrealistic
There was a surrealistic quality
about those days in Saigon for Boyle,
and he remembers them fondly.
"1 liked Saigon a lot. We stayed in a
luxurious hotel, with a pool and ev
erything. Each day we would dress in
fatigues and drive out to the war after
lunch for a few hours, take some pic
turesand then return to the hotel fora
swim."
In 1969, Boyle went to My Lai to
investigate the reports of a massacre,

and the horrors he witnessed there
led him to grave doubts about Ameri
can involvement in Vietnam and his
own role as a newspaperman. He left
his job with the Weekly to work with
the Long Hoa, an underground
pacifist movement in South Vietnam.
Tiger cages
In December of that year, he set out
with the Long Hoa on a voyage up the
Mekong river to free prisoners from
the "tiger cages" of Con Son Island.
They were turned back by the South
Vietnamese army. After a Christmas
Eve peace demonstration in Saigon's
Kennedy Square, leaders of the Long
Hoa were arrested, and Boyle was
expelled from Vietnam by President
Nguyen Van Thieu.
In 1972 he made headlines by re
turning illegally to South Vietnam to
check out rumors of a mutiny by the
U.S. Infantry Company at Firebase
Pace, near the Cambodian border.
The rumors, he proved to the im
mense consternation of the Penta
gon, were true.
Between 1972 and 1975, he free
lanced as a war-correspondent in Is
rael, Cambodia, Beirut and Northern
Ireland. In Israel, during the Yom
Kippur war, he traveled with a con
tingent of the Israeli army, and again
he found war reporting rather unreal.
Tour guide
"The Israelis would pack all the
newsmen in an air conditioned bus
and drive us out to the front — a guy
would stand with a microphone and

act like a tour guide while the tanks
rolled past."
In March, 1975, he returned to In
dochina to witness the Khmer United
Front victory in Cambodia.
"For weeks we had watched the
battle-map shrinking and the sound
of artillery approaching. Then one
day the army came into the telegraph
office and said that a helicopter was
leaving in 15 minutes, and that that
was our last chance to get out (of
Phnom Penh).

"They also said that the Khmer
Rouge had vowed to cut off the heads
of any Americans they found. I de
cided to stay. I wanted to see how the
story would end. To leave would
have been like walking out before the
last act of a play." Of the 17 jour
nalists who elected to remain, Boyle
was the only American.
Drama ends
The drama ended at the French
Embassy in Phnom Penh, where the
few remaining foreigners had
gathered. "There wasn't any water or

toilet facilities, and hardly any food.
Just about the only thing we had was
cases of Jack Daniels and Vichy wa
ter. Have you ever tried to brush your
teeth with Vichy?"
Boyle was the last American to
