# How to teach dissident ideas
## 
### 
Bruce Blakely

President Richard Lyman, in
his address to the student body
on Nov. 12, 1975, stated that
. . we should judge a student
body somewhat less on its me
dian SAT score, and more on the
quality of its discontents."
However, a quote from Lyman
in the Feb. 18 Daily would seem
to indicate Lyman feels poten
tially concerned students ought
to be robbed of the very seed of
their discontentment — that
they should only be able to dis
sent from within the confines ot
ignorance.
A concern for change from the
status quo originates in an un
derstanding of the inherent
problems of an extant institu
tion. Once the problems are
realized — and only then — can
a beneficial deviation take place.
Without adequate under
standing of the present system,
any attempts to renovate will be
a resounding failure, victimized
by the same flaws which previ
ously plagued the established
system.
Lyman's quote
Lyman's quote of Feb. 18 ran,
"It would be a gross error if Stan
ford students did not have an
opportunity to learn about
Maxism. But there is a widely
prevalent view that the only
people who can teach about cer
tain problems are those who
agree with particular view
points. This is palpable non
sense."
This statement seems to advo
cate a position that will impede
Stanford students from objec
tively appraising the credibility
of an institution which forms
one of the basic tenents of
American society. In an age of
rising welfare-state socialism, it
is essential to evaluate the
capitalistic structure which the
United States possesses, without
the damper of pro-capitalist
biases.
Most of us students here are
native citizens of the United
States. From before we can re
member, parental, pedagogical
and media-induced socializing
processes have imbued us with
the foundations of our socio
economic structure.
It has been ingrained in us that
capitalism is good, communism
is evil. Only by bringing the sub
ject into our consciousness can
we evaluate it objectively.
Question capitalism
However, is it enough simply
to question capitalism, or any

given social institution, without
deliberately seeking its faults?
It does not appear to be suffi
cient merely to study the subject;
rather one has to deliberate over
its credibility, and this entails
one's being exposed to an advo
cate of the alternative. It is im
possible to develop an educated
viewpoint from a single-minded
framework.
If our minds have been prop
erly prepared, we ought to be
capable of making the best deci
sions from a position of know
ledge, rather than having the
University make our decisions
for us, and in doing so, deprive
us of the chance to disagree.
A university is supposed to be
a hub of learning, evaluation and
discernment. Yet the University
will fail to meet this obligation if
we are deprived of the perspec
tives contrary to those advocated
by the ruling faction.
Everyone's interest
Instead of seeking to expound
those theories we support, it is in
everyone's interest to expose
both those doctrines promul
gated in our community and
those which are not. Only by un
derstanding groups who disag
ree with our fundamental con
structs can we honestly turn ar
bitrary acceptance into rational
advocacy.
I am not a Marxist. I merely
wish to ensure education will
provide us with more than an
explanation. It is equally, if not
more important, to illustrate
those possibilities which are not
realized in our society.
Lyman's Feb. 18 comment
seems to be an intolerant attack
on diversity of opinion. It repre
sents an ideology which does
not nurture enlightened educa
tion; instead he promotes an
anti-intellectual attempt to in
fuse the University with gullible
non-individuals.
As far as the University is a
place to learn, to grow, to re
search and to explore, we should
deliberately seek out people who
will present opinions contrary to
our own. The devil's advocate, at
worst, provides a basis for for
mulating our own body of truths.
At best, he provides impetus
for a change that could lead to a
structure superior to that which
a society now possesses. To
Lyman I put the question, "How
can we say they are wrong if you
won't let us learn what they have
to say?"

Lyman's quote
Lyman's quote of Feb. 18 ran,
"It would be a gross error if Stan
ford students did not have an
opportunity to learn about
Maxism. But there is a widely
prevalent view that the only
people who can teach about cer
tain problems are those who
agree with particular view
points. This is palpable non
sense."
This statement seems to advo
cate a position that will impede
Stanford students from objec
tively appraising the credibility
of an institution which forms
one of the basic tenents of
American society. In an age of
rising welfare-state socialism, it
is essential to evaluate the
capitalistic structure which the
United States possesses, without
the damper of pro-capitalist
biases.
Most of us students here are
native citizens of the United
States. From before we can re
member, parental, pedagogical
and media-induced socializing
processes have imbued us with
the foundations of our socio
economic structure.
It has been ingrained in us that
capitalism is good, communism
is evil. Only by bringing the sub
ject into our consciousness can
we evaluate it objectively.
Question capitalism
However, is it enough simply
to question capitalism, or any

given social institution, without
deliberately seeking its faults?
It does not appear to be suffi
cient merely to study the subject;
rather one has to deliberate over
its credibility, and this entails
one's being exposed to an advo
cate of the alternative. It is im
possible to develop an educated
viewpoint from a single-minded
framework.
If our minds have been prop
erly prepared, we ought to be
capable of making the best deci
sions from a position of know
ledge, rather than having the
University make our decisions
for us, and in doing so, deprive
us of the chance to disagree.
A university is supposed to be
a hub of learning, evaluation and
discernment. Yet the University
will fail to meet this obligation if
we are deprived of the perspec
tives contrary to those advocated
by the ruling faction.
Everyone's interest
Instead of seeking to expound
those theories we support, it is in
everyone's interest to expose
both those doctrines promul
gated in our community and
those which are not. Only by un
derstanding groups who disag
ree with our fundamental con
structs can we honestly turn ar
bitrary acceptance into rational
advocacy.
I am not a Marxist. I merely
wish to ensure education will
provide us with more than an
explanation. It is equally, if not
more important, to illustrate
those possibilities which are not
realized in our society.
Lyman's Feb. 18 comment
seems to be an intolerant attack
on diversity of opinion. It repre
sents an ideology which does
not nurture enlightened educa
tion; instead he promotes an
anti-intellectual attempt to in
fuse the University with gullible
non-individuals.
As far as the University is a
place to learn, to grow, to re
search and to explore, we should
deliberately seek out people who
will present opinions contrary to
our own. The devil's advocate, at
worst, provides a basis for for
mulating our own body of truths.
At best, he provides impetus
for a change that could lead to a
structure superior to that which
a society now possesses. To
Lyman I put the question, "How
can we say they are wrong if you
won't let us learn what they have
to say?"
