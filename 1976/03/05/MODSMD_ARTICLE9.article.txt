# Crises inspire only feeble reforms
## 
### 
Within the last 10 years, the
American government has been
rocked by a succession of crises
more threatening to the basic
legitimacy of the "system" than
any event since the Great Depre
ssion.
The impact of the Vietnam
war, Watergate and the CLA-FBI
scandals has deeply shaken pub
lic confidence in the openness,
honesty and responsiveness of
political institutions in the Un
ited States. Numerous public
opinion polls confirm that the
number of Americans confident
of the basic integrity of our gov
ernment fell by half since the
mid-19605.
The crisis of confidence re
flects not only the magnitude of
the scandals but also the funda
mental lack of reform that fol
lowed them. The feeble, superfi
cial efforts at reform by Congress
and the President have failed to

restore the system's legitimacy.
After over a decade of gov
ernmental deception and
monumental human waste, the
Vietnam war finally ground ig
nominiously to an end despite

the Ford administration's fruit
less efforts to continue the strug
gle.
Congress not only failed to de
cisively end the war by cutting
off military aid to South Viet
nam's President Nguyen Van
Thieu following American troop
disengagement, it just as impor

tantly failed to insure that future
presidents would be unable to
lead the country into new Viet
nams.
Effective legislation is essen
tial to prevent future genera
tions, with no memory of the
Vietnam war (how many Ameri
cans even remember the 1965
invasion of the Dominican Re
public?), from credulously fol
lowing their leaders into another
disastrous and immoral war.
Yet Congress gave us only the
War Powers Act, which gives the
president the right— not granted
by the Constitution — to under
take military action unilaterally
for up to three months (after
which he will no doubt claim
that American lives will be "en
dangered" by "hasty" with
drawal).
Ford has already invoked this
act several times, as when he
bombed Cambodia in retaliation

for its temporary seizure of the
Mayaguez. More recently, with
regard to Angola, the CIA argued
that its forces need not comply
even with the loose provisions of
the War Powers act, since the
forces were not in uniform!
No more reform came out of
the greatest American political
scandal of all time, Watergate.
Last July, Sen. Lowell
Weicker (R-Conn.) denounced
Congress for its almost complete
failure to pass any of the nearly
100 Watergate-related bills in
troduced on its floor.
Out of 71 Ervin committee re
commendations, not one was
enacted — except for a watered
down presidential campaign fi
nance law (recently gutted by
tjie Supreme Court), which re
duced the statute of limitations
from five years to three for mem
bers of Congress who violate the
corrupt practices act. With blat
ant cooperation from the Justice
Department, 1972 campaign vio
lators escaped all possibility of
prosecution one year ago.
The latest scandal to under
mine public confidence sur
rounds the illegal activities of
the CIA and FBI killing people
and subverting organizations at
home and abroad. Both agencies,
nearly from the outset, strove to
determine the limits of the inves
tigation by controlling the flow
of documents.
Few politicians speak any
more of significant reform for the
"intelligence community." No
major presidential candidate
calls for the abolition of the CIA
or even of its covert action
branch.
At best, we may get yet
another ineffective "oversight"
committee, whose many failures
will no doubt be lamented long
after the fact.
CBS newsman Daniel Schorr
is right when he says there is a
pendulum in this country that
swings between secrecy and lib
erty — and he got hit by the back
swing. The question in the
minds of many Americans, con
sidering the resistance of our in
stitutions to meaningful reform,
is whether the pendulum will
ever swing forward again.

Within the last 10 years, the
American government has been
rocked by a succession of crises
more threatening to the basic
legitimacy of the "system" than
any event since the Great Depre
ssion.
The impact of the Vietnam
war, Watergate and the CLA-FBI
scandals has deeply shaken pub
lic confidence in the openness,
honesty and responsiveness of
political institutions in the Un
ited States. Numerous public
opinion polls confirm that the
number of Americans confident
of the basic integrity of our gov
ernment fell by half since the
mid-19605.
The crisis of confidence re
flects not only the magnitude of
the scandals but also the funda
mental lack of reform that fol
lowed them. The feeble, superfi
cial efforts at reform by Congress
and the President have failed to

restore the system's legitimacy.
After over a decade of gov
ernmental deception and
monumental human waste, the
Vietnam war finally ground ig
nominiously to an end despite

the Ford administration's fruit
less efforts to continue the strug
gle.
Congress not only failed to de
cisively end the war by cutting
off military aid to South Viet
nam's President Nguyen Van
Thieu following American troop
disengagement, it just as impor

tantly failed to insure that future
presidents would be unable to
lead the country into new Viet
nams.
Effective legislation is essen
tial to prevent future genera
tions, with no memory of the
Vietnam war (how many Ameri
cans even remember the 1965
invasion of the Dominican Re
public?), from credulously fol
lowing their leaders into another
disastrous and immoral war.
Yet Congress gave us only the
War Powers Act, which gives the
president the right— not granted
by the Constitution — to under
take military action unilaterally
for up to three months (after
which he will no doubt claim
that American lives will be "en
dangered" by "hasty" with
drawal).
Ford has already invoked this
act several times, as when he
bombed Cambodia in retaliation

for its temporary seizure of the
Mayaguez. More recently, with
regard to Angola, the CIA argued
that its forces need not comply
even with the loose provisions of
the War Powers act, since the
forces were not in uniform!
No more reform came out of
the greatest American political
scandal of all time, Watergate.
Last July, Sen. Lowell
Weicker (R-Conn.) denounced
Congress for its almost complete
failure to pass any of the nearly
100 Watergate-related bills in
troduced on its floor.
Out of 71 Ervin committee re
commendations, not one was
enacted — except for a watered
down presidential campaign fi
nance law (recently gutted by
tjie Supreme Court), which re
duced the statute of limitations
from five years to three for mem
bers of Congress who violate the
corrupt practices act. With blat
