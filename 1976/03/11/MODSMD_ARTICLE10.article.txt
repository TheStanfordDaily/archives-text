# Capitalism's lovely feature
## Tibor Machan 
### 
There are many discouraging
features of our times, but not ev
erything is heading for doom. A
small group of individuals ac
counts for a rejuvenation in our
cultural mental life. I am speak
ing of the neo-conservatives,
represented recently in News
week by New York University
Prof. Irving Kristol.
Somewhat loosely speaking,
neo-conservatives like relatively
free political institutions, a seri
ous, culture-wide concern for
traditional (mostly religious)
values, a bit of unabashed
nationalism, a relatively free and
unbureaucratized market place
and ample welfare for both the
economically and spiritually
needy.
Their ranks include Daniel
Moynihan, Daniel Bell and other
very well known academic fi
gures.

The theme many neo
conservatives have stressed in
foreign affairs is that America
need not apologize for its exis
tence, wealth, power and goals
when compared to other nations.
Moynihan, Peter Bauer and
others have put some of these
points in intelligent as well as
inspiring language.
On the domestic front, neo
conservatives have focused
mainly on what they see as seri
ous shortcomings of capitalism.
For example, Bell complains (in
The Cultural Contradictions of
Capitalism that "American
capitalism . . . has lost its tradi
tional legitimacy which was
based on a moral system of re
ward, rooted in a Protestant
sanctification of work ..."
Eric Fromm, aneo-Marxist.has
for years been telling us that
capitalism is unable to sustain
the stable institutions that shel
ter people.
Fromm went so far as to ex
press his preference of feudalism
over industrial capitalism.
Simple charge
But the best known critic
among neo-conservatives is
Kristol himself. His charge is
simple: both practically and
theoretically, capitalism is a so
cial system in which liberty is
prized above justice.
As the title of Kristol essays
puts it, capitalism is where "vir
tue loses all her loveliness."
In the face of this heavy and
sustained criticism a couple of
defensive points have to be al
lowed.
Granted, Kristol's charge fits
the best-known defenders of
libertarianism, F. A. Hayek, re
cent Nobel Prize winner in
economics, and economist Mil
ton Friedman. Both rest their
case for liberty on our alleged
ignorance of what justice is, so
that we owe it to everyone to ab
stain from enforcing
some idea of justice.
This is the essence of the free
society of which capitalism is
the economic manifestation, or
so Hayek and Friedman explain.
Kristol, as well as Bell, notes
that capitalism was not always
defended on such barren

grounds but used to have a good
deal of puritan moral theory giv
ing it intellectual or spiritual
support.
Yet in this Kristol and Bell are
slightly off base — starting with
Thomas Hobbes, most analysts
of the liberal society de
emphasized morality and stres
sed the political value of liberty.
But it would be wrong to leave
it at this. Capitalism ma> not
have had a very sound moral de
fense, but then, neliher have
monarchy, feudalism or the fas
cist, socialist sod communist
systems. In short, the entire mat
ter of morality has been in disar
ray for centuries.
Ask for more
When we listen to the com
plaints of the neo-conservatives
it behooves us to ask for more
than we have been getting thus
far. Why not teach us an alterna
tive instead of issuing eloquent
complaints?
Perhaps a positive parting
note is due here.
Capitalism in its radical form,
is the economic system of a soci
ety in which liberty is the prime
political value worthy of full
protection. But this does not
mean that capitalism isn't also
on the side of justice when com
pared with alternatives.
One can easily suppose that
the following idea makes the
capitalist system lovelier than
all others: in a pure capitalist
system each individual, in vol
untary company with others,
must choose and can choose, to
pursue excellence in life.
Because morality requires
freedom to choose — slaves can
not choose to do right or wrong
— the political efforts of a soci
ety must be directed toward
making the moral life of each
citizen possible. But the political
system itself cannot guarantee
moral quality to a culture.
Each of us must begin to up
grade the culture, for there is no
way to do this without liberty or
by political directives.
So then what i3 lovelier than
capitalism? Only some idle
wish, perhaps.

— the political efforts of a soci
ety must be directed toward
making the moral life of each
citizen possible. But the political
system itself cannot guarantee
moral quality to a culture.
Each of us must begin to up
grade the culture, for there is no
way to do this without liberty or
by political directives.
So then what i3 lovelier than
capitalism? Only some idle
wish, perhaps.
(Tibor Machan is a national
fellow at the Hoover Institution.)
There are many discouraging
features of our times, but not ev
erything is heading for doom. A
small group of individuals ac
counts for a rejuvenation in our
cultural mental life. I am speak
ing of the neo-conservatives,
represented recently in News
week by New York University
Prof. Irving Kristol.
Somewhat loosely speaking,
neo-conservatives like relatively
free political institutions, a seri
ous, culture-wide concern for
traditional (mostly religious)
values, a bit of unabashed
nationalism, a relatively free and
unbureaucratized market place
and ample welfare for both the
economically and spiritually
needy.
Their ranks include Daniel
Moynihan, Daniel Bell and other
very well known academic fi
gures.

The theme many neo
conservatives have stressed in
foreign affairs is that America
need not apologize for its exis
tence, wealth, power and goals
when compared to other nations.
Moynihan, Peter Bauer and
others have put some of these
points in intelligent as well as
inspiring language.
On the domestic front, neo
conservatives have focused
mainly on what they see as seri
ous shortcomings of capitalism.
For example, Bell complains (in
The Cultural Contradictions of
Capitalism that "American
capitalism . . . has lost its tradi
tional legitimacy which was
based on a moral system of re
ward, rooted in a Protestant
sanctification of work ..."
Eric Fromm, aneo-Marxist.has
for years been telling us that
capitalism is unable to sustain
the stable institutions that shel
ter people.
Fromm went so far as to ex
press his preference of feudalism
over industrial capitalism.
Simple charge
But the best known critic
among neo-conservatives is
Kristol himself. His charge is
simple: both practically and
theoretically, capitalism is a so
cial system in which liberty is
prized above justice.
As the title of Kristol essays
puts it, capitalism is where "vir
tue loses all her loveliness."
In the face of this heavy and
sustained criticism a couple of
defensive points have to be al
lowed.
Granted, Kristol's charge fits
the best-known defenders of
libertarianism, F. A. Hayek, re
cent Nobel Prize winner in
economics, and economist Mil
ton Friedman. Both rest their
case for liberty on our alleged
ignorance of what justice is, so
that we owe it to everyone to ab
stain from enforcing
some idea of justice.
This is the essence of the free
society of which capitalism is
the economic manifestation, or
so Hayek and Friedman explain.
Kristol, as well as Bell, notes
that capitalism was not always
defended on such barren

grounds but used to have a good
deal of puritan moral theory giv
ing it intellectual or spiritual
support.
Yet in this Kristol and Bell are
slightly off base — starting with
Thomas Hobbes, most analysts
of the liberal society de
emphasized morality and stres
sed the political value of liberty.
But it would be wrong to leave
it at this. Capitalism ma> not
have had a very sound moral de
fense, but then, neliher have
monarchy, feudalism or the fas
cist, socialist sod communist
systems. In short, the entire mat
ter of morality has been in disar
ray for centuries.
Ask for more
When we listen to the com
plaints of the neo-conservatives
it behooves us to ask for more
than we have been getting thus
far. Why not teach us an alterna
tive instead of issuing eloquent
complaints?
Perhaps a positive parting
note is due here.
Capitalism in its radical form,
is the economic system of a soci
ety in which liberty is the prime
political value worthy of full
protection. But this does not
mean that capitalism isn't also
on the side of justice when com
pared with alternatives.
One can easily suppose that
the following idea makes the
capitalist system lovelier than
all others: in a pure capitalist
system each individual, in vol
untary company with others,
must choose and can choose, to
pursue excellence in life.
Because morality requires
freedom to choose — slaves can
not choose to do right or wrong
— the political efforts of a soci
ety must be directed toward
making the moral life of each
citizen possible. But the political
system itself cannot guarantee
moral quality to a culture.

protection. But this does not
mean that capitalism isn't also
on the side of justice when com
pared with alternatives.
One can easily suppose that
the following idea makes the
capitalist system lovelier than
all others: in a pure capitalist
system each individual, in vol
untary company with others,
must choose and can choose, to
pursue excellence in life.
Because morality requires
freedom to choose — slaves can
not choose to do right or wrong
— the political efforts of a soci
ety must be directed toward
making the moral life of each
citizen possible. But the political
system itself cannot guarantee
moral quality to a culture.
Each of us must begin to up
grade the culture, for there is no
way to do this without liberty or
by political directives.
So then what i3 lovelier than
capitalism? Only some idle
wish, perhaps.
