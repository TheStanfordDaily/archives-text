# Library cooperates with Berkeley
## 
### Bob Fikso 
The Stanford Libraries will soon become
part of the nation's largest research library, but
might have to forfeit some of their indepen
dence in order to do it.
The Faculty Senate last week approved a
plan for a large-scale research library coopera
tive program with the University of California
at Berkeley.
The plan was developed out of a desire of
officials here and at Berkeley to maintain high
quality research facilities in a period when
budgets are tight and costs of scholarly publi
cations are soaring.
When fully implemented — the plan sets
September 1977 as a target date — the program
will include:
—a coordinated book selection system
whereby Stanford and Berkeley would share
expensive low-use books, journals and other
research materials.
—specialization of research collections. In a
hypothetical situation, Stanford would con
centrate on its Austrian collection, and leave
Berkeley to collect Scandinavian materials.
—reciprocal borrowing and library use
privileges for faculty, academic staff and
graduate students. Undergraduates are not
mentioned in the plan, but organizers say un
dergraduates involved in honors theses and
other research projects will probably be able to
acquire research privileges.
—daily transportation of books and users be
tween campuses. Book delivery will be much
faster than under the present Interlibrary Loan
program; books ordered early in the day will
arrive later that same day, organizers say.
The cooperative program will create com
bined holdings of about 8.7 million volumes,
second only to Harvard in the nation.
No turning back
The Faculty Senate's approval of the prog
ram is a commitment to a long-range program
that, once begun, will be nearly impossible to
stop.
Religious Studies Prof. William Clebsch,
chairman of the Academic Council Committee
on Libraries, explained that because of the
huge amount of research material published
yearly, a library that had neglected a certain
area of its collection in a cooperative program
would find itself hopelessly behind if it at
tempted to resume acquisitions in that area.
Clebsch and other organizers stress that the
program will not cut costs, but is merely an
attempt to stem projected cost increases.
One argument skeptical of the program
doubts the long-run economics of library
cooperation. If cooperation is a national trend,
as proponents say it is, demand for scholarly
publications will be severely reduced, driving
the costs of printing up. In this process, the
argument goes, any savings achieved in re
duced purchases of volumes will be eaten up
by higher costs of all volumes.
The cooperative will be financed by a
$50,000 startup allocation from each library's
book fund. Once the plan is implemented, its
financing will be part of the libraries' operating
budgets.
Will plan hurt scholars?
Concern was also expressed that opening up
the University's libraries to use by large num
bers of Berkeley scholars will strain facilities
here and reduce the availability, of research
materials.
Clebsch and others answer that the planned
step-by-step implementation of the program
will allow library officials to monitor use
closely. If it is discovered that facilities are
being strained by the program, implementa
tion would stop at an earlier stage, limiting the

number of participants in the program.
A new main library here would presumably
ease the facility strain considerably. Although
complete blueprints have been drawn for the
library's construction, the project is in limbo
while University fundraisers search for a
multi-million dollar gift to provide a funding
base for the building.
Nation-wide trend cited
The cooperative plan's proponents say that
cooperation with Berkeley has been inevitable
for a long time, and is part of a national trend
toward library cooperative networks.
Duke University and the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill have had a cooperative
program since the 50s. Several Ivy League
schools have a loose library cooperative, as do

Columbia and huge New York Public Library
system.
The Stanford-Berkeley system will be the
most extensive in acquisitions coordination
and collection specialization, however.
Clebsch also says the plan is distinguished by
the distance between Berkeley and Stanford —
short enough for convenient access to facilities
and delivery of materials but long enough to
help prevent overuse of the program.
Berkeley's library system currently holds
4.65 million volumes, sixth in the nation. Stan
ford has 4.1 million volumes, eighth in the
nation. Harvard, Yale, Illinois, Michigan and
Columbia occupy the top spots, and Cornell is
ranked seventh.
