# USE contract expires this spring
## Campus union prepares for possible strike 
### Bill Sing 
Representatives of the United States
Employees (USE) union and the University
administration are gearing up for what most
certainly promises to be a long and intense
struggle when the two groups get together for
the spring's contract negotiations.
Both sides have intensified their differences
over the past few months. A strike this spring
seems quite possible. USE President Jim Berk
has predicted that a strike "would be inevita
ble" should the University fail to respond to
union demands.
The current contract, settled in June 1974
after a three-week long strike, will expire at the
end of August.
Friction between the union and the Univer
sity was intensified largely through the lay-off
of Assistant USE President William Reynolds
from his machinist job at Hansen Laboratories
in January. Douglas Barton, University counsel
for employe relations, explained that Reynolds
was laid off in a belt-tightening effort, since he
had less seniority than his fellow workers.
Political motives charged
But Berk and the union countered Barton by
calling the layoff "ridiculous," contending
that the University laid off Reynolds because of
his union organizing activities.
"Reynolds was a thorn in their side, and they
wanted to get rid of him," Berk charged.
In protest of Reynold's dismissal, several
USE members demonstrated in front of Encina
Hall and the Old Pavilion. Barton and the Uni
versity reprimanded the union members for
the demonstration, contending that it violated
an anti-picketing clause in the union's 1974
contract, and threatened to discharge the de
monstrators from their jobs.
Berk denied that the protest violated the con

tract, maintaining that the USE was attempting
"to inform the public about the situation, not to
stop work or cause slowdowns."
Subsequently, the University refused
Reynold's attempt to replace an employe at the
Electronics Lab with less seniority, after de
termining that Reynolds didn't have sufficient
skill to perform at the new job without addi
tional training. USE members again de
monstrated in front of Encina and the Pavilion
and increased their allegations that the Uni
versity was in fact engaging in "union
busting" activities.

USE currently considers Reynolds' case
"Top priority," and maintains it will pursue it
with considerable effort. The case has yet to go
into arbitration.
Another confrontation of magnitude bet
ween the union and the University is expected
to arise over the National Labor Relations
Board's recent authorization of issuance of a
complaint that USE filed against the Univer
sity last April. The complaint charges that the
University and Stanford Hospital officials or
ganized and controlled two minority employe
groups the Alianza Latina and the Black Ad
visory Council, and used them to campaign
against USE representation in a labor election
at the hospital. Hospital employes rejected
USE representation in the election.
Barton and the University contended that
the two groups were in fact not labor organiza
tions, and that they acted "on their own" in the
labor election.
USE officials say they hope that a favorable
resolution will force the University to call
another labor election at the hospital. Union
officials say they have the University "cold" on
tfils issue.
Dress rehearsal for spring
Regardless of the outcome of these two dis
putes, momentum has built up for the critical
stretch of contract negotiations upcoming.
Both sides expect to give little ground before
the major stages of the negotiations begin.
Berk commented last fall that "a strike is
very likely." He complained that the Universi
ty's attitude is "if anything, more obdurant "
than during the 1974 negotiations.
A central issue in the contract discussions
could be determining the size of the employe
force USE will represent. Berk claimed that the
University cut USE's bargaining unit from

1600 employes to 1350 by reclassifying some
workers as either professional employes or
supervisors, neither of which are subject to
union representation.
In addition, of course, the USE will demand
increases in its workers wage and benefit base.
USE believes it has succeeded in gaining
more respect and recognition by the University
through the resent conflicts. "The University
now fears us," said Berk, "whereas before they
were merely annoyed."
Whether Barton and his team of University
negotiators will go to the bargaining table
"afraid" remains to be seen.

busting" activities.

USE currently considers Reynolds' case
"Top priority," and maintains it will pursue it
with considerable effort. The case has yet to go
into arbitration.
Another confrontation of magnitude bet
ween the union and the University is expected
to arise over the National Labor Relations
Board's recent authorization of issuance of a
complaint that USE filed against the Univer
sity last April. The complaint charges that the
University and Stanford Hospital officials or
ganized and controlled two minority employe
groups the Alianza Latina and the Black Ad
visory Council, and used them to campaign
against USE representation in a labor election
at the hospital. Hospital employes rejected
USE representation in the election.
Barton and the University contended that
the two groups were in fact not labor organiza
tions, and that they acted "on their own" in the
labor election.
USE officials say they hope that a favorable
resolution will force the University to call
another labor election at the hospital. Union
officials say they have the University "cold" on
tfils issue.
Dress rehearsal for spring
Regardless of the outcome of these two dis
putes, momentum has built up for the critical
stretch of contract negotiations upcoming.
Both sides expect to give little ground before
the major stages of the negotiations begin.
Berk commented last fall that "a strike is
very likely." He complained that the Universi
ty's attitude is "if anything, more obdurant "
than during the 1974 negotiations.
A central issue in the contract discussions
could be determining the size of the employe
force USE will represent. Berk claimed that the
University cut USE's bargaining unit from

1600 employes to 1350 by reclassifying some
workers as either professional employes or
supervisors, neither of which are subject to
union representation.
In addition, of course, the USE will demand
increases in its workers wage and benefit base.
USE believes it has succeeded in gaining
more respect and recognition by the University
through the resent conflicts. "The University
now fears us," said Berk, "whereas before they
were merely annoyed."

Representatives of the United States
Employees (USE) union and the University
administration are gearing up for what most
certainly promises to be a long and intense
struggle when the two groups get together for
the spring's contract negotiations.
Both sides have intensified their differences
over the past few months. A strike this spring
seems quite possible. USE President Jim Berk
has predicted that a strike "would be inevita
ble" should the University fail to respond to
union demands.
The current contract, settled in June 1974
after a three-week long strike, will expire at the
end of August.
Friction between the union and the Univer
sity was intensified largely through the lay-off
of Assistant USE President William Reynolds
from his machinist job at Hansen Laboratories
in January. Douglas Barton, University counsel
for employe relations, explained that Reynolds
was laid off in a belt-tightening effort, since he
had less seniority than his fellow workers.
Political motives charged
But Berk and the union countered Barton by
calling the layoff "ridiculous," contending
that the University laid off Reynolds because of
his union organizing activities.
"Reynolds was a thorn in their side, and they
wanted to get rid of him," Berk charged.
In protest of Reynold's dismissal, several
USE members demonstrated in front of Encina
Hall and the Old Pavilion. Barton and the Uni
versity reprimanded the union members for
the demonstration, contending that it violated
an anti-picketing clause in the union's 1974
contract, and threatened to discharge the de
monstrators from their jobs.
Berk denied that the protest violated the con

tract, maintaining that the USE was attempting
"to inform the public about the situation, not to
stop work or cause slowdowns."
Subsequently, the University refused
Reynold's attempt to replace an employe at the
Electronics Lab with less seniority, after de
termining that Reynolds didn't have sufficient
skill to perform at the new job without addi
tional training. USE members again de
monstrated in front of Encina and the Pavilion
and increased their allegations that the Uni
versity was in fact engaging in "union
busting" activities.

USE currently considers Reynolds' case
"Top priority," and maintains it will pursue it
with considerable effort. The case has yet to go
