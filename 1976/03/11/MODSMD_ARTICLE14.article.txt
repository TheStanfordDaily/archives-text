# Pattern finally emerges from primary contests

Florida's presidential primaries could turn
out to be the turning point in this year's elec
tion; winners Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford
would certainly like to think so.
Both surprised political observers by outpol
ling conservative challengers who at one time
were considered as sure to win as the sun was
to shine. It rained on Florida Tuesday, and it
poured on George Wallace and Ronald Reagan.
Carter won the southern governor's show
down, proving that last week's fourth-place
finish in Massachusetts was not the beginning

of the end of his compaign.
Although Wallace finished a strong third in
Massachusetts and second in Florida (a state he
won in 1970), his chances of winning the
Democratic nomination are virtually nil.
However, Wallace is still interested in ac
cumulating delegates to assure a strong influ
ence in the decision-making at the summer's
convention.
Thus Wallace's loss is a major setback as he
battles with Carter and Washington Sen. Henry
Jackson to capture the conservative wing of the

party.
Jackson finished third in Florida, but his
capturing of 20 percent of the vote on the heels
of his Massachusetts victory indicates that he
will provide a stiff challenge to Carter.
His Florida campaign was called six days of
the "condo" because he successfully concen
trated on garnering the retired and Jewish con
dominium dwellers' votes.
However, he lacked the broad-based
support that helped Carter upset Wallace.
Ford's victory in a southern state indicated

that Reagan does not have the strength to de
feat an incumbent President.
It's doubtful that the former California gov
ernor will be able to pull together his forces for
Illinois or any other northern state, where the
voters are likely to be less conservative — and
hence more pro-Ford — than in Florida.
Reagan however, has not given up, and his
efforts will probably drive Ford to the right so
much that any candidate the Democrats end up
with will have a good chance to win in
November.
It's the vote that counts
Reagan held a lead in early Florida surveys
but the Ford victory was not totally unexpected
as polls showed voters switched their loyalty
as election day approached.
How many convention delegate votes did
the winners and runners-up in Florida pick
up? Forget it. Sixty-six Republican and 81
Democratic national convention delegates
were at stake, but the distribution process was
more complicated than voting in last year's
ASSU elections.
With Ford apparently on his way to victory,
attention will focus on the upcoming Democra
tic primaries, particularly Illinois and New
York, in early April.
Arizona Rep. Morris Udall has already
forced Indiana Sen. Birch Bayh out of the race
and 1972 vice-presidential candidate Sargent
Shriver won't be able to last much longer
either.
Udall still faces Carter
Udall should fare increasingly well among
liberal voters, but whether he'll be able to suc
cessfully challenge Carter is questionable.
It's likely that no one will be able to garner a
majority of the convention votes, indicating
that a struggle between the conservative and
liberal wings of the party may loom ahead.
Currently, Carter and Udall appear to be
leading their respective unofficial camps, but
unless either can accumulate a large block of
delegates (more than 35 percent) it is likely
they will be passed up for well-known names
of the past like Hubert Humphrey or Edmund
Muskie.
While the Republicans are more strongly in
dicating every day that Ford has a better idea
than Reagan, the Democrats are still attempt
ing to determine who can come up with an idea
better than Ford's.
