# Senate stumbles to end of quarter
## 
### Lori Matsukawa 
The final ASSU Senate meeting of the 1975-
76 winter quarter limped to its close on Mon
day with only nine members (less than an 11-
member quorum) present. The sparse atten
dance seemed to symbolize the senate's dearth
of accomplishments during the quarter.
The senate has spent much of the quarter
trying, without notable success, to go beyond
the regular procedural matters of senate busi
ness and make significant University policy.
As a feather in its cap, the senate has in
itiated two night-time shuttle buses that ser
vice all major residences and libraries between
the hours of 6 p.m. and 12:15 a.m.
Three guest professorships were approved
by the senate after hearing a detailed report by
members of the Guest Professorship Board.
The presence next spring of Angela Davis, Er
nest Mandel and Claude Steiner, who have
been described as "radical" thinkers, will, in
the view of some senators, balance the predo
minantly conservative or liberal political
views among Stanford's faculty.
The senate still spent much energy on inter
nal matters, particularly on ASSU finances,
approving committee appointments and set
ting senate goals.
Finances go big time
Considerable time was spent discussing
possible ways to increase ASSU income for the
upcoming year to offset a predicted $42,000
budget cut from the Dean of Student Affairs

Office. The most talked-of suggestion has been
the hiring of a professional investing firm to
buy bond portfolios for the ASSU.
The issue was settled this quarter when the
senate acquiesced in allowing Financial Man
ager Chris Cline to form a committee to inves
tigate all profit-generating options activities
and come up with possible recommendations.
ASSU projects, except for the Travel Service
and Special Events, showed end-of-quarter
profits with the Sunday Flicks having a re
markable $3785.36 profit. Cline announced
that while the 75-cent admission will not be

reduced next quarter, season ticket prices will
be reduced from $7.50 to $5 for 10 shows.
While busying itself with approving Nomi
nations Committee appointments, approving
the Finance Committee's proposed program
fee assessments and listening to Council of
Presidents (COP) reports, the senate also tus
sled with the problem of establishing viable
goals.
Groping for goals
Some senators' private concern for the se
nate's "image" led eventually to a private
meeting in February where senators sup
posedly discussed and defined the senate's
goals for the remainder of the quarter and year.
Students have questioned the utility of the
senate as an active representative body. Recent
criticisms of the senate imply that the senate
serves merely as a training ground for future
COP candidates.
What is frustrating, said one senator, is that
although students decry the use of the senate as
a way to gain "experience" in student govern
ment matters, they still expect COP candidates
to have some experience with student politics.
Putting its house in order
The winter quarter also appeared to be a nur
turing quarter for pet projects, such as the
budget committee's attempts to see if students
may be allowed to participate in future Univer
sity budget decisions at the departmental level
and the formation of the committee to investi

gate revenue-generating options for the next
school year. These issues promise to come to
full bloom next quarter after this winter's in
vestigation and research period ends.
Spring quarter will be a final test for this
senate's ability to initiate programs and resolu
tions that will enhance student life at Stanford.
The senators are running short of time to take
actions which go beyond simple household
duties. All this may be done during the COP
election season. Three senators have declared
their candidacy. How this may affect the senate
remains to be seen.

ager Chris Cline to form a committee to inves
tigate all profit-generating options activities
and come up with possible recommendations.
ASSU projects, except for the Travel Service
and Special Events, showed end-of-quarter
profits with the Sunday Flicks having a re
markable $3785.36 profit. Cline announced
that while the 75-cent admission will not be

reduced next quarter, season ticket prices will
be reduced from $7.50 to $5 for 10 shows.
While busying itself with approving Nomi
nations Committee appointments, approving
the Finance Committee's proposed program
fee assessments and listening to Council of
Presidents (COP) reports, the senate also tus
sled with the problem of establishing viable
goals.
Groping for goals
Some senators' private concern for the se
nate's "image" led eventually to a private
meeting in February where senators sup
posedly discussed and defined the senate's
goals for the remainder of the quarter and year.
Students have questioned the utility of the
senate as an active representative body. Recent
criticisms of the senate imply that the senate
serves merely as a training ground for future
COP candidates.
What is frustrating, said one senator, is that
although students decry the use of the senate as
a way to gain "experience" in student govern
ment matters, they still expect COP candidates
to have some experience with student politics.
Putting its house in order
The winter quarter also appeared to be a nur
turing quarter for pet projects, such as the
budget committee's attempts to see if students
may be allowed to participate in future Univer
sity budget decisions at the departmental level
and the formation of the committee to investi

gate revenue-generating options for the next
school year. These issues promise to come to
full bloom next quarter after this winter's in
vestigation and research period ends.
Spring quarter will be a final test for this
senate's ability to initiate programs and resolu
tions that will enhance student life at Stanford.
The senators are running short of time to take
actions which go beyond simple household
duties. All this may be done during the COP
election season. Three senators have declared
their candidacy. How this may affect the senate
remains to be seen.

The final ASSU Senate meeting of the 1975-
76 winter quarter limped to its close on Mon
day with only nine members (less than an 11-
member quorum) present. The sparse atten
dance seemed to symbolize the senate's dearth
of accomplishments during the quarter.
The senate has spent much of the quarter
trying, without notable success, to go beyond
the regular procedural matters of senate busi
ness and make significant University policy.
As a feather in its cap, the senate has in
itiated two night-time shuttle buses that ser
vice all major residences and libraries between
the hours of 6 p.m. and 12:15 a.m.
Three guest professorships were approved
by the senate after hearing a detailed report by
members of the Guest Professorship Board.
The presence next spring of Angela Davis, Er
nest Mandel and Claude Steiner, who have
been described as "radical" thinkers, will, in
the view of some senators, balance the predo
minantly conservative or liberal political
views among Stanford's faculty.
The senate still spent much energy on inter
nal matters, particularly on ASSU finances,
approving committee appointments and set
ting senate goals.
Finances go big time
Considerable time was spent discussing
possible ways to increase ASSU income for the
upcoming year to offset a predicted $42,000
budget cut from the Dean of Student Affairs

Office. The most talked-of suggestion has been
the hiring of a professional investing firm to
buy bond portfolios for the ASSU.
The issue was settled this quarter when the
senate acquiesced in allowing Financial Man
ager Chris Cline to form a committee to inves
tigate all profit-generating options activities
and come up with possible recommendations.
