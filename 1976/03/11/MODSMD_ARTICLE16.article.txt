# Faculty Senate reviews budget

### Geoffrey Samuels 
After listening to the presenta
tion of the 1976-77 budget
guidelines before the Faculty
Senate last Thursday, Electrical
Engineering Prof. Frederick
Crawford said, "In effect it's a
fait accompli when we hear
about it."
Crawford suggested that
either the Senate's Committee on
Committees or the Steering
Committee search for a
"mechanism" with which the
senate could participate in the
creation of the budget at an ear
lier stage.
"It would seem," he said,
"that somewhere along the line
the senate ought to have some
thing to say, some input as a se
nate which would be very use

ful."
Provost William Miller said
Crawford's perception of the li
mited role of the senate in the
formation of the budget was "es
sentially correct." He added that
the same applied for the
Trustees.
Miller agreed with Crawford
in the importance of earlier dis
cussions. "The greatest effect is
felt," he said, "when people
point toward questions in the
long-range forecast."
He noted that both with the
board and the senate, "we
started presenting discussions
on the long-range forecast and
the parameters therein early in
the fall."
On the development of the
budget in the future, Miller said
that he had had a "very brief dis
cussion" with the Budget
Priorities Commission in which
he indicated his intent to
examine "how the budget pro
cess itself may need some re
structuring."
Although he said the Senate

had not played a leadership role
in the formation of the budget,
Miller said the "local decision
making is the most important."
He added that "the biggest im
pact comes from the bottom up,
in plans from departments and
schools."
On different matters,the sen
ate passed a proposal to estab
lish a joint library program
which establishes co-ordinated
research collections with UC-

Berkeley. The intent of the plan
is to avoid duplication in the
procurement of lesser-used re
search materials and to concen
trate resources at both campuses
on most-needed materials.
A transportation system is to
be devised to convey books and
researchers between the two
campuses, along with a direct
borrowing program for faculty
and graduate students of both
universities.
