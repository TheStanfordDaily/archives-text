# Northwestern students begin protest
## 
### Jeff Parietti 
An estimated 1000 students
massed at the Northwestern
University administration build
ing last week demanding an exp
lanation for a substantial tuition
hike, increased representation
on tenure committees and a
mandatory course and professor
evaluation program.
The protest was organized by a
group called Student Voice,

which was recently formed by
several student council mem
bers. According to sources,
membership in the rapidly
growing group now totals about
150 students.
The group calls itself a "non
organization" because of the be
lief that students' voices are not
being heard by the university
administration.
As for the three demands, the
first concerns a $425 tuition
raise effective next fall.
The university's budget re
sources and advisory council,
composed of administration, fa
culty and students, recently

examined the budget and pub
lished a report. However, the
council did not include actual
monetary figures in the docu
ment.
A spokesman for Student
Voice told the Daily that "we
want to see the actual financial
figures on where our tuition
money is going."
The second demand by
Northwestern students involves
more student input on tenure
procedures. The Student Voice
group wants a 25 percent stu
dent representation on tenure
committees at the university.
"We figure if we're going to
pay the high tuition we should at

least get some good professors
for our money," the spokesman
said. He added that "students
here have had professors who do
good research but who can't
teach."
The final demand concerns
course and professor evalua
tions. In the past, these evalua
tions have been on a voluntary
basis but the students want the
evaluations made mandatory.
The students concluded the
peaceful gathering by setting a
March 31 deadline for their de
mands to be met. If the deadline
is not met, leaders of Student
Voice say there will be another
protest held at the university.
