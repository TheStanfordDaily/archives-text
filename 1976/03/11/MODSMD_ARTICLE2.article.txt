# U.S. denies visa to guest professor
## 
### Bert Bower 
Belgian economist Ernest Mandel
last week was denied a visa to enter the
United States as a visiting professor
here, ASSU Guest Professorship Board
member Andrea Halliday, a senior,
said yesterday.
Mandel informed the board on Feb.

24 that he would be available to teach
two economics courses here from
March 30 to June 9, Halliday said.
But in a letter from the U.S. Embassy
in Brussels to Mandel dated March 3,
Mandel was told he had been found
ineligible to enter the country under a
section of the Immigration and Na

tionality Act which "prohibits the is
suance of a visa to anyone who is or has
been a member of the Communist
party or a Communist controlled or
ganization."
Denies membership
Mandel, author of a two-volume
work entitled Marxist Economic
Theory and editor of the Belgian Left
Socialist Party weekly La Gauche, de
nied he is a member of the Belgian
Communist Party. He has described
himself as "a revolutionary Marxist."
"A waiver of the denial must come
from the State or Justice departments if
there is any chance of the decision
being reversed," said James Siena,
legal adviser to President Richard Ly
man. "The University will do what
ever it can to get the waiver through."
"The Belgian consulate said Tt was
sympathetic with Mandel's request,
but that he was on a list of names that
were not to be let into the country,"
Halliday said.
In addition to the U.S. Embassy's ob
jection to Mandel's possible Com
munist party affiliations, Halliday
noted that there was a problem be
cause he didn't have an official Uni
versity sponsorship form at the time he
applied for his visa.
Eorm sent
The form was sent last Friday, and
arrived just after Mandel initiated his
visa request, according to Coordinator
of Undergraduate Specials Programs
Laura Selznick.
"The University didn't drag its feet
on this matter," Selznick said. "They
have been extremely responsive."
She said the University moved
quickly to approve Mandel's courses
after learned in late February that he
was available to teach during spring
quarter.
Mandel was slated to teach two Un
dergraduates Special courses, "Post
World War II Boom and Its End" and
"West Europe Facing Depression and
Fascism 1929-1939: France, Belgium,

Spain and England."
Mandel was also denied a visa seven
years ago to attend a conference here
on "Technology and the Third
World."
Negative recommendation
Then-Atty.Cen. Richard Kleindienst
recommended to the State Department
that Mandel be kept from entering the
country for the conference.
"A group of East Coast academians
whom Mandel was going to meet with
decided to sue Kleindienst for violat
ing their First Amendment rights,"
Halliday said.
The suit went to the Supreme Court
after a New York District Court upheld
the professors' right to hear Mandel.
The Supreme Court upheld Klein
diepst's decision not to grant Mandel a
visa."
"If the University had told me about
the Supreme Court's decision it would
have helped us a lot in trying to get
Mandel here." Halliday said.
But Siena said he was not aware of
the Supreme Court's action until this
week.
