I'm sure that there are a large number of people here who enjoy
nude sunbathing, and as spring quarter and warmer weather are
approaching, my girlfriend and I would like to know if there are
any places on campus where coed nude sunbathing is permitted.
It's not a matter of the University permitting you to sunbathe in
the nude. It's a matter of finding a place where you won't be
arrested for it. Stanford has no officially established area, unless
you count the roof of the women's gym, which isn't coed. You'll
have to try and find a place on your own.
According to Stanford Police Capt. William Wullschleger, as
long as you aren't in a public place and aren't offending or annoy
ing anybody, you're safe from the law. But if you're catching the
rays in White Plaza or your neighbors don't like what they're
watching through their binoculars, Santa Clara County Sheriffs can
arrest you for violation of a state penal code statute which considers
such activity to be indecent exposure, a misdemeanor. A second
conviction is considered a felony.
According to James Siena, legal adviser to President Richard
Lymdn, the only indecent exposure arrest in recent years was
during the streaking craze, when a man was being driven
around, standing up nude, in the back of an open jeep.

My girlfriend and I cannot find her clitoris. Where exactly is it? We
are not exactly sure where it is found in the vagina.
This question might be one of the usual joke questions I receive
regularly (usually they deal with cows, dogs and sheep), but if it's
legit I'd better try to help right away. First, the clitoris is not
actually located inside the vagina. Nor is it located in the throat, as
Linda Lovelace thought. I hope you're not poking around her belly
button by mistake.
Have you found her minor lips yet? Those two pinkish hairless
folds of skin surrounding her vagina? The upper portions form
folds of skin above and below the clitoris. Sometimes it can be a bit
frustrating trying to locate it amongst all the wrinkles — it doesn't
always look much different from the surrounding countryside —
but that general area is usually very sensitive.
I must admit that sometimes the only way to know you've found
the clitoris is that she jumps more when it'stouchedthan when any
other part of her body is touched. But it should be there. If you're
still lost, better have a gynecologist point it out to her.

According to Stanford Police Capt. William Wullschleger, as
long as you aren't in a public place and aren't offending or annoy
ing anybody, you're safe from the law. But if you're catching the
rays in White Plaza or your neighbors don't like what they're
watching through their binoculars, Santa Clara County Sheriffs can
arrest you for violation of a state penal code statute which considers
such activity to be indecent exposure, a misdemeanor. A second
conviction is considered a felony.
According to James Siena, legal adviser to President Richard
Lymdn, the only indecent exposure arrest in recent years was
during the streaking craze, when a man was being driven
around, standing up nude, in the back of an open jeep.

My girlfriend and I cannot find her clitoris. Where exactly is it? We
are not exactly sure where it is found in the vagina.
This question might be one of the usual joke questions I receive
regularly (usually they deal with cows, dogs and sheep), but if it's
legit I'd better try to help right away. First, the clitoris is not
actually located inside the vagina. Nor is it located in the throat, as
Linda Lovelace thought. I hope you're not poking around her belly
button by mistake.
Have you found her minor lips yet? Those two pinkish hairless
folds of skin surrounding her vagina? The upper portions form
folds of skin above and below the clitoris. Sometimes it can be a bit
frustrating trying to locate it amongst all the wrinkles — it doesn't
always look much different from the surrounding countryside —
but that general area is usually very sensitive.
I must admit that sometimes the only way to know you've found
the clitoris is that she jumps more when it'stouchedthan when any
other part of her body is touched. But it should be there. If you're
still lost, better have a gynecologist point it out to her.
