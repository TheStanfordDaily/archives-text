## Hayden steps up campaign 
### Scott Wakefield 
Democratic U.S. Senate can
didate Tom Hayden said he
plans to "step up the speaking
and visible action" of his prim
ary campaign against fellow
Democrat Sen. John Tunney.
Hayden, in remarks here
March 3, said he and his wife,
actress Jane Fonda, "want to be
all over this state for the next
hundred days in a blitz from one
end of the state and back."
Hayden spoke at the opening
of his Palo Alto campaign head
quarters.
"We're going to have to try to
raise money through concerts
and whatever means to do im
mediate campaigning," he said.
"I think we can draw the crowds
and create the excitement."
Hayden called for a debate
with Tunney, but cautioned that
"what we're proposing is not a
debate in Sacramento at mid
night on one radio station."
He proposed that a 12-person
"jury of our citizen peers" be
chosen by a selected member of
the press to study the candi
dates' positions and then ask the
candidates questions.
"Then we'll have to answer
the questions without knowing
who's asking them," Hayden
said.
"That's what politicians get
most upset about. They don't
like to go into a group cold. They
like to be warmed up. They like
to know that ethnic group this is
and how to ring their bell,"
Hayden said.
Hayden summed up his main
opponent, saying "Tunney's key
argument is that he can win."

Hayden reacted to his en
dorsement last Sunday from the
California Democratic Council,
saying he has the legitimate
support and consent of the ac
tivist and progressive Democrats
in the state.
"It's not quite the equivalent
of (Senator George) McGovern's
(D-S.D.) New Hampshire victory
in 1972.1 think it's less than that.
But it does represent something
like that."
Hayden warned his campaign
workers that "a lot of people at
the last minute will hear some
very bad or negative things
about me that you're going to
have to counteract, that we're all
going to have to counteract early
rather than at the last moment."

Hayden commented on some
irony he had seen in his cam
paign. "You know, the other
night we opened our office in
Orange County . . . There was a
bomb threat and they had
policemen on all the rooftops
because people were supposed
to shoot at me, and blow up the
office.
"The guy who was doing sec
urity was a private detective
who's a friend of people in our
organization. In 1968, this pri
vate detective was a member of
the Red Squad of the Chicago
Police Department. Big change."
The Red Squad was a police
spy agency which, among other
things, investigated antiwar ac
tivists such as Hayden.
