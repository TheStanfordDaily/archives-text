A comrade and I discovered recently that we were once both
deputy members of Marshall J, the Bay Area television star (KPIX,
channelsJ. However, we cannot recall the words to his theme song.
Were there any? Also, what became of our erstwhile mentor?â€”
S.T.G. and B.K.
Frankly, we don't know any of the answers. This is just one of
many questions which we have spent hours researching, only to
emerge with nothing. It is printed in the hopes of consoling those
people who have periodic paranoid delusions that their questions
are being ignored by our staff.
We began our quest for the elusive Marshall J by calling KPIX.
The promotion staff there informed us that his real name was Jay
Alexander and that he had left KPIX several years ago to work at
Marine World.
Unfortunately, Jay Alexander left Marine World two years ago.
In despair, we phoned previous Daily entertainment editor
George Powell. He suggested that we talk to the KPIX weatherman
Leon Hunsaker, who had worked at KPIX with Jay Alexander. And
so we called Hunsaker. He admitted having known Marshall J but
had no idea of his present whereabouts.
At this point we rested. Then, in one frantic, last-ditch effort we
contacted AFTRA (American Federation of Television and Radio
Artists). The union's last records of Jay Alexander said that he was
living in Novato.
Our hearts in our mouths, we called Novato information. There
was no listing for that name.
And so we reach the end of our fruitless query. Anyone out there
with news of Jay Alexander, please drop us a line. Now we're
having paranoid delusions!
