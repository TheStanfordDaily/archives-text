Galvez Street, between Cam
pus Drive and Serra Street,will
be closed until May 1, beginning
late this week or early next week,
according to the Facilities Plan
ning Department.
The street improvement will
eliminate parking along both
sides of Galvez Street. Some off
street parking will be provided
for the Band Shack.
Construction of underground
utilities for the Herbert Hoover
Federal Memorial Library and
the Main Library Annex will also
eliminate staff and reserve park
ing areas between the library pay
lot and the Lou Henry Hoover
Building.
The University Committee on
Parking and Transportation will
make recommendations to the
University regarding parking al
ternatives resulting from the loss
of parking areas due to Univer
sity construction, according to
Donald Winbigler, committee
chairman.
The committee will also make
recommendations spring quar
ter on the University's parking

system, based on a series of pub
lic hearings held last week.
"We are in the process of
evaluating the (parking) system
and we will make our recom
mendations on the basis of the
hearings, suggestions to the
committee and our own observa
tions," said Winbigler.
He said about 40 to 50 persons
attended the series of three hear
ings. "There weren't a great
many people (at the hearings)
but there were a wide variety of
opinions expressed," he
explained.
Winbigler listed some of the
ideas discussed at the hearings,
including an increase in the
shuttle bus program, opening up
general parking zones to stu
dents who live on campus and
gearing parking fees to indi
viduals' incomes.
"We will sift through all of
these ideas as a part of our evalu
ation of the existing program.
We won't have a report until
after we have evaluated every
thing,which should be sometime
during spring quarter,"
Wingbigler said.
