Reagan finished in '76?
WASHINGTON — While President Gerald
Ford's followers were counting Ronald Reagan out
of the race for the Republican presidential nomina
tion yesterday, a top Reagan official was saying the
challenger's campaign was still "alive and well."
Meanwhile, Reagan, who lost a head-to-head
showdown with Ford in Tuesday's Florida pri
mary, and George Wallace, who finished second to
Jimmy Carter in the Democratic voting, were al
ready in Illinois trying to build some momentum
for the primary there next Tuesday.
Reagan, the initial front-runner in Florida's Re
publican primary, did not get tough soon enough to
offset the advantages of an incumbent president,
Reagan's state campaign chairman said yesterday.
"If he had taken off the gloves a few days earlier,
it might have made some difference," said L.E.
"Tommy" Thomas. "The only thing we see that
Ford had going for him was the incumbency."
In Washington, the Ford camp was saying with
one breath that Reagan has no chance now of being
nominated but that the President was going to con
tinue campaigning at full steam — indicating
they're not ready yet to believe their own exuber
ance.
Nixon: Kissinger initiated taps
WASHINGTON — Former President Richard
Nixon said under oath that it was Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger who selected the list of persons
who were wire-tapped without court order early in
his presidency.
Nixon's statement, made in a sworn deposition
filed yesterday in U.S. District Court, appears to
contradict Kissinger, who said Nixon made the ini
tial decision on whose phones would be tapped in
an attempt to stop new leaks.
"I of course did not select the names myself be
cause I did not know the individuals," Nixon said
in the deposition taken at his San Clemente home
on Jan. 15. "I told Dr. Kissinger that he should
inform Mr. Hoover of any names that he considered
to be prime suspects." J. Edgar Hoover then was
director of the FBI.
During the 6V2-hour deposition. Nixon re
peatedly shunned any responsibility for the
specifics on the wiretap program, except to

acknowledge giving his general approval. He was
occasionally sarcastic and at one point the ques
tioning was halted.
"We are getting quarrelsome for no reason at all,"
Nixon said then.
'Detente' still alive: Soviets
MOSCOW — A Soviet magazine, in the first Rus
sian comment on President Gerald Ford's dropping
of the word "detente," said yesterday, "No one can
strike 'detente' out of the dictionary of world poli
tics, not even a president."
However, "turning away from a word is not the
same as turning away from political course," the
political weekly New Times declared.
Ford said in an interview in Miami on March 1
that he dislikes the word "detente" as a label for
U.S.-Soviet relations but expressed continued be
lief in the concept.
Ford said that it would be better to describe the
effort as a process of negotiating with all major
powers and negotiating from strength.
Mao fuels anti-Teng fire
TOKYO — Mao Tse-tung has issued a statement
to the Chinese people intensifying the battle
against Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping, target of a
nationwide poster and propaganda campaign.
A broadcast yesterday by China's official news
agency Hsinhua reported the Communist party
chairman's call to all Chinese "to take a still more
active part in the current struggle" in which Teng is
depicted as a "capitalist roader" — a follower of
capitalist principles.
Teng was not named, but Hsinhua said Mao had
"exposed the reactionary nature of the unrepentant
capitalist-roader (Teng) in the party who goes
against the trend of history."
Teng has been emphasizing such things as the
economy and stability rather than Mao's demand
for continuous revolution to eliminate all
bourgeois influences from China.

Gasoline prices tumble
WASHINGTON —Gasoline prices have tumbled
at pumps across the country, providing bargains for
consumers and problems for some service station
owners who say they can't afford the cuts.
Scattered price wars were reported yesterday,
particularly in the West and Midwest with
motorists switching stations at the drop of a penny.
Most dealers said the price cuts were due to de
creases at the wholesale level. Industry and gov
ernment experts attribute the drop to an abundant
supply of gasoline resulting from conservation ef
forts, economic conditions and a generally mild
winter that enabled companies to cut production of
heating oil.
Afew servicestation managers said they felt the
oil companies were deliberately trying to hurt
franchised operators. They said the companies
want to run the stations themselves, turning them
into the increasingly popular self-service opera
tions.
