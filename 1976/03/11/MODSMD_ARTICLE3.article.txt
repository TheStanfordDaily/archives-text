SAN FRANCISCO — F. Lee Bailey
tried for the third consecutive day yes
terday to discredit the testimony of
Joel Fort, a psychiatric and behavioral
expert who has described Patricia
Hearst as the "queen" of the Sym
bionese Liberation Army (SLA).
Bailey introduced a report critical of
Fort written by some of Fort's co
workers in 1958. When asked about his
colleagues' criticism of him, Fort con
ceded he lacked experience then.
"1 needed improvement in
psychoanalysis, 1 worked too hard,
had too much interest in my patients
and wasn't positive about shock
therapy," he said.
Then, as he has done throughout
cross-examination, Fort utilized a
Bailey question to make a point in his
behalf.
"What else did your colleagues tell
you," Bailey probed.
"They said I had made remarkable
improvement," Fort answered trium
phantly.
Bailey also attempted to reveal an
inconsistency in Fort's views on the
effects of brainwashing. Under ques
tioning by U.S. Atty. James Browning
on Monday, Fort contended that
brainwashing can only play a minor
role in the field of attitude change.

But Bailey claimed that Fort himself
contradicted that view in the Los
Angeles trial of convicted mass
murderer Charles Manson.
Manson had used brainwashing to
"produce a new form of thinking,"
Fort had testified in that trial.
The testimony pertained to Leslie
Van Houten, one of the Manson fol
lowers accused in the murder of ac
tress Sharon Tate.
"Did you testify that she had been
brainwashed?" Bailey asked.
"Through a combination of isolation
of family members from other human
contacts, through massive use of LSD,
through exposure to a wide range of
sexual depravity, the attitudes of the
women in the family had been af
fected," Fort replied.
During his prosecution testimony
earlier in the week. Fort said he had
not studied brainwashing intensively.
He also testified that he believed
Hearst was a willing participant in the
SLA and in the Hibernia Bank robbery.
Fort described Hearst as "extremely
independent, strong-willed, rebelli
ous, well-educated, intelligent,but not
particularly intellectually inclined."
He said Hearst was sexually promis
cuous at 15 and had often lied to pa
rents and teachers to overcome bur
densome situations.
