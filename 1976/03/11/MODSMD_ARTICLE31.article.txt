Employes of the Hewlett-Packard
research and development plant in the
Stanford Industrial Park returned to
work as usual Monday after a Friday
morning bomb blast caused $75,000
worth of damage there.
The Red Guerilla Army has taken
responsibility for the blast, which
came at 6:15 a.m. A young woman,
who identified herslelf as a member of
the Red Guerilla Army, telephoned the
Hewlett-Packard building at 3 500 Deer
Creek Road twice to warn of the com
ing explosion.
After the second call at about 6:05
a.m., the four employes then in the
building were evacuated to a parking
lot. The blast came 10 minutes later
near the area where they had been
working.
No one was injured in the blast that
damaged both a liquid oxygen and a
liquid nitrogen tank. It also damaged
the walls, ceiling and sucked out the
glass in the windows of the building
next to the tanks.
Besides the chemical contents of the
tanks, fine asbestos in the wall insula
tion also covered the blast area.
Later that morning, the Hewlett-
Packard offices at 1501 Page Mill Road
received two more phone calls warn
ing that another bombing was set to
occur that night. No such blast occur
red.
The persons who phoned after the
blast did not identify themselves with
the Red Guerillas, according to Palo
Alto Police Capt. Gary Tatum.
The Palo Alto Police Department
and the FBI are conducting a joint in
vestigation into the case, Tatum said.
He also said police plan to step up pat
rols in the area of the blast.
Hewlett-Packard has been occupy
ing the building since last March.
This was the second bombing on
Stanford land this year. The first was
on Jan. 19, when a pipe bomb exploded
in an outhouse on the Stanford Golf
Course.
Only employes needed for repair
work were called in to work on Friday.
