# Observer claims:
## Chinese anticipate decline of the West 
### Anne Michelini 
The "larger, longer perspective" of
China's worldview foresees not only
the declining power of Western cul
ture but the growing threat of the
Soviet Union, said Felix Greene, visit
ing chairman of the Society for
Anglo-China Understanding in Bri
tain, at Memorial Church last Saturday
night.
Greene, describing the Chinese from
"hunches" he picked up during exten
sive traveling writing and film mak
ing in China, said "They see a Western
capitalist imperialistic system on the
decline."
According to the Chinese analysis of
the situation, Greene said this declin
ing system is being challenged in one
way by the Third World. No longer
satisfied with the distribution of the
world's wealth, the underdeveloped
countries are beginning to hold back
on the cheap labor and natural re
sources that are vital to keeping con
sumptive Western society "operable."
A much more immediate challenge,
however, comes from the "new kind of
imperialism" of the Soviet Union.
Greene said the Chinese feel Ameri
cans "haven't begun to wake up to this
and haven't understood it."
Main enemy
Greene said that China has already
identified the Soviet Union as its
main enemy. With a military budget
described by Greene as "almost wholly
defensive," the Soviets to the Chinese
are "a nation that is moving ahead
with offensive weaponry i on a scale

like we've never seen before."
For the Chinese, Greene said Soviet
manifestation of military strength be
comes all the more threatening when
viewed as a part of deceptive Soviet
practices.
The Chinese see the actual nature of
the Soviet Union as "socialist in name,
in formal economic structure, but act
ing like an expensive imperialistic
country," said Greene.
Part of strategy
China wants to come to agreeable
terms with the United States "not be
cause they agree with us," he said, but
as part of a strategy that stresses mak
ing all necessary alliances "to over
come the main enemy."
The effect of the wheat deals with
the U.S.S.R., the refusal of the U.S. to
stand up to Soviet intervention in An
gola and the failure to reach conclu
sive SALT agreements seems to have
lead the Chinese to a rather cynical
view of American foreign policy. Ac
cording to Greene, they said "when the
U.S. talks about detente, they should
use the word appeasement."
China's own foreign policy appears
"confused" at times unless their
perspective is understood, Green said.
He admitted that he thought former
President Nixon's first visit was a mis
take.
"I was wrong, the Chinese were
right," Greene conceded. He said he
saw that Nixon's visit "broke China's
isolation," enabling it to open rela
tions with many other countries, in
cluding Japan.
