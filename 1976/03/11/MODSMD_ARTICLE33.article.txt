# Economist says governments deprive individuals of freedom
## 
### George Anders 
Governments throughout the world
are encroaching on their citizens' free
dom, University of Chicago economist
Milton Friedman declared last Friday
evening.
Speaking in a packed Kresge Au
ditorium, Friedman said "in every
case, government's desire to do good
has led towards a perversion of the
public will."
Friedman cited Chile, Great Britain
and New York City as examples of
places where excessive government
spending has led to a loss of freedom.
He said former Chilean President
Salvador Allende financed spending
"by turning to the printing presses and
the hidden tax of inflation. The result
was to polarize the nation, leaving

only two alternatives, a left-wing
takeover destroying the'government,
or a right wing takeover."
Britain, Friedman declared, "is
nearing the tipping point with gov
ernment spending making up 60 per
cent of the national income."
Same trail
New York City, he added, "is pro
ceeding down the exact same trail. The
result is that New York City is no
longer governed by the citizens of New
York. It is governed by caretakers."
The right of citizens to spend their
own money is just one of many rights
the U.S. government is abridging,
Friedman asserted.
"You may think you own yourself,
but you don't. Everyone should go
around with a stamp on his back say
ing 'You are the property of the United
States government.' "
Most Americans do not have free
dom of speech, he declared. Friedman
referred to medical school professors
who will not give speeches on
socialized medicine for fear of losing
federal grants, and to students con
cerned about what will appear on their
dossiers.
Free man
"About the only people in univer
sities who do have freedom of speech,"
he declared, "are persons like myself,
tenured professors at major univer
sities on the verge of retirement."
For others, Friedman said, problems
arise because of the inadequacies of
the political marketplace. "Economic
mechanisms provide for more true
freedom."
" 'One person, one vote' is rhetoric.

The political system has highly weigh
ted voting. There is very little relation
between what people vote for, and
what they get.
"The fundamental defect of the
political system," he maintained "is
that it overweights visible effects, and
underweights invisible ones."

In contrast, he asserted, "the key
characteristic of the marketplace is
that you get what you pay for."
Friedman urged that the political
marketplace be used only for decisions
that must apply yes or no to all people,
while the economic marketplace be

was amazing."
He disputed the view that without
Nixon in jail, justice has not been
done. He called accountability the key
to justice. As in the Agnew affair, "the
highest interest that the state had was
to get him out of office, not to get him
into jail," Stern noted.
"When it says 'equal justice under
law,' it doesn't say 'equal justice under
sentencing,' " he said. "If all criminals
did get the same sentences for the same
offense, human situations would not
bn taken into account and it wouldn't
be a system of justice."
Stern completed law school in Ohio
while planting himself in the field of
broadcast journalism. Recently due to
the vast number of lawyers unable to
find work, there has been a great influx
of lawyers into the area of journalism.
In comparing the two fields, he noted
that "if a person's passion is not jour
nalism first then he is heading for the
wrong profession."
He said the field of news is 95 per
cent journalism and five percent law.
A reporter does not have the resources
available to the lawyer. Therefore,
Stern said, "if one is out to change the
world, use the legal system and the
courts, not the press. It just can't be
done (otherwise)."
Stern feels his stay in San Francisco
at the trial will last a little over another
week, after which he should be back in
Washington.

He disputed the view that without
Nixon in jail, justice has not been
done. He called accountability the key
to justice. As in the Agnew affair, "the
highest interest that the state had was
to get him out of office, not to get him
into jail," Stern noted.
"When it says 'equal justice under
law,' it doesn't say 'equal justice under
sentencing,' " he said. "If all criminals
did get the same sentences for the same
offense, human situations would not
bn taken into account and it wouldn't
be a system of justice."
Stern completed law school in Ohio
while planting himself in the field of
broadcast journalism. Recently due to
the vast number of lawyers unable to
find work, there has been a great influx
of lawyers into the area of journalism.
In comparing the two fields, he noted
that "if a person's passion is not jour
nalism first then he is heading for the
wrong profession."
He said the field of news is 95 per
cent journalism and five percent law.
A reporter does not have the resources
available to the lawyer. Therefore,
Stern said, "if one is out to change the
world, use the legal system and the
courts, not the press. It just can't be

Stern feels his stay in San Francisco

Governments throughout the world
are encroaching on their citizens' free
dom, University of Chicago economist
Milton Friedman declared last Friday
evening.
Speaking in a packed Kresge Au
ditorium, Friedman said "in every
case, government's desire to do good
has led towards a perversion of the
public will."
Friedman cited Chile, Great Britain
and New York City as examples of
places where excessive government
spending has led to a loss of freedom.
He said former Chilean President
Salvador Allende financed spending
"by turning to the printing presses and
the hidden tax of inflation. The result
was to polarize the nation, leaving

only two alternatives, a left-wing
takeover destroying the'government,
or a right wing takeover."
Britain, Friedman declared, "is
nearing the tipping point with gov
ernment spending making up 60 per
cent of the national income."
Same trail
New York City, he added, "is pro
ceeding down the exact same trail. The
result is that New York City is no
longer governed by the citizens of New
York. It is governed by caretakers."
The right of citizens to spend their
own money is just one of many rights
the U.S. government is abridging,
Friedman asserted.
"You may think you own yourself,
but you don't. Everyone should go
around with a stamp on his back say
ing 'You are the property of the United
States government.' "
Most Americans do not have free
dom of speech, he declared. Friedman
referred to medical school professors
who will not give speeches on
socialized medicine for fear of losing
federal grants, and to students con
cerned about what will appear on their
dossiers.
Free man
"About the only people in univer
sities who do have freedom of speech,"
he declared, "are persons like myself,
tenured professors at major univer
sities on the verge of retirement."
For others, Friedman said, problems
arise because of the inadequacies of
the political marketplace. "Economic
mechanisms provide for more true
freedom."
