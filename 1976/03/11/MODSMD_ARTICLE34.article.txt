# Berlin campus will close; financial reasons cited

The study center in Berlin now
housing about 30 students will close
at the end of spring quarter 1977 for
financial reasons the Overseas Studies
Office announced Monday.
"Alternative funding is the only
possibility for diverting the closing of
the Berlin campus, and as of now, un
less new developments occur, Berlin
will close," said Asst. Director of
Overseas Studies Corb Smith.
"The government in Berlin has ex
pressed an official interest in keeping
the Berlin program alive," said Smith.
"Correspondence with History Prof.
Gordon Craig (presently in Berlin) has
indicated that some sort of negotiation
is taking place with the city govern
ment."
Despite this interest, however, no
definite source for alternative funding

has been found,according to Smith.
Austerity program
The closing of the Berlin campus is
another step in the austerity program
intended to meet an imposed 50 per
cent budget cut by Sept. 1, 1978.
"The closing of the campus will save
$70,000 in general funds and char
ters," said Smith, adding that this es
timate does not include costs for room
and board which at the moment are not
estimable.
The Berlin program was Stanford's
newest foreign studies center and fea
tured an advanced language program.
Closings
In December, the Overseas Studies
Office announced the permanent clos
ing of the program in Beutelsbach,
Germany, as of this spring, as well as

the temporary closing of the Berlin and
Tours programs this summer.
The fate of the Bonn and Vienna
programs are uncertain-according to
Smith. These two campuses make up
the centers in the German language
culture region.
"The Bonn program is an anomaly
right now," said Smith, "as it is a very
small program and the budget cost is
low."
Smith had no comment on the popu
lar Tours and Paris programs noting
that the committee on Foreign Study
Programs has taken no action to de
termine the fate of these programs.
New policy
The new policy for overseas studies
imposed by the Committee on Foreign
Study Programs in December of last
year also included the provision that
the University maintain one major

study program in each of the five
language-culture areas in which a
center now exists. Another provision
was that a study center be opened in a
Third World country by Sept. 1,1978.
Although overseas programs have
been organized in Lima and Mexico
City, Smith stated that the committee
has yet to make a decision on a country
for a Third World study center.
Research is now being made into al
ternative programs to Cliveden; the
committee is looking into programs in
either Oxford, London or Reading. It is
financially more feasible, according to
Smith, to maintain a homestay and
dormitory program modeled after the
Tours campus rather than a large resi
dential center as is presently main
tained in Cliveden.
"Whether we decide to keep it or
not, will be the decision of the commit
tee on Foreign Study Programs."
