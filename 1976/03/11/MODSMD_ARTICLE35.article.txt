# Miller reveals budget to ASSU senators
## 
### Lori Matsukawa 
Provost William Miller gave a two
hour presentation on the University
Proposed Operating Budget for the
school year 1976-77 to the ASSU Se
nate Monday night saying the Univer
sity plans to "fill a $10 million gap
between income and expenditures
within the next three years" through a
budget equilibrium program.
Miller said 78 percent of the gap will
be filled through expenditure reduc
tions while 22 percent will be filled
through income increases.
"We are a labor intensive institu
tion," said Miller, and indicated most
of the cutbacks will be in direct
salaries and hired services.
The budget for hired services, such
as outside printing, will be reduced by
$1,303,000. A projected $3,245,000
cutback in salaried positions would af
fect all faculty positions.
"If a senior faculty member died, re
tired or left, the (department) head
would determine if he could be re
placed by a junior faculty member,"
said Miller. He described this as a "re
duced rank-reduced cost" situation.
Miller also provided statistics that
showed a decrease in engineering pro
fessors from 142 to 136 and an increase
in humanities and sciences faculty
from 415 to 445 since the school year
1969-70.
Unfounded fear
Miller said he used the figures
merely to show that the fear that
budget cuts have "decimated" the
number of faculty on campus is un
founded.
"The worst fears have not
materialized," said Miller.
Senators questioned Miller on tui
tion and tenure issues. ASSU Sen. Bill
Tyndall asked Miller whether the tui
tion rate increase will exceed the na
tional wage (increase) rate.
Beyond national rate
"For three years, the tuition will be
beyond the national wage rate. Much
of the actual dollar amount depends on

the inflation rate, however," said Mil
ler.
The tuition for 1976-77 will be
$4275, 12.2 percent more than this
year's tuition.
Commenting on the tenure issue,
Miller said that research should be re
garded as "a long term investment as
compared to teaching which is a short
term investment. It would be an
abomination of trust not to provide for
the future students."
Tenure selection
Sen. Bruce Reznick questioned te
nure selection procedures saying
"world-class researchers and indiffe
rent teachers" usually were given te
nure preference.
"Some math students I know are get
ting together to nominate a professor
for the Gores Award so that they can
get rid of him," said Reznick.
When Miller finished his presenta
tion, only nine of the original 13
senators present at the meeting re
mained to hear ASSU Vice President
Charlotte Germane give notice of two
ASSU constitutional amendments.
Fee Assessments
The first of the two proposed
amendments will change Article V,
Section 2 of the ASSU constitution to
read that the levying of an ASSU prog
ram fee, or a special fee assessment, is
unauthorized unless it is endorsed by
at least 10 percent of the student body,
as well as a majority of the students
voting in the election.
Currently, an assessment fee can be
levied on students if it receives a
majority of the vote in an election,
even if less than 10 percent of the stu
dent body votes for the assessment.
The second amendment proposes
changing all "sexisf'wording in the
constitution and to insert he/she,
him/her and his/her in all instances
where reference to one sex occurs.
Legal counseling
ASSU Vice President Josie Jaramillo
submitted a resolution asking for a fee
assessment of one dollar for Autumn
and Winter quarters of 1976-77 to sup
port the Legal Counseling Office (LCO)
located in the Old Firehouse. The re
solution was referred to the Finance
Committee for investigation into
LCO's actual need for funding.
Finance Committee Chairman Kevin
McDermott said the committee should
determine the LCO's actual need. "We

are trustees. We are to put what is best
for the student on the ballot."
The ASSU Course Guide manager.
Lance Friedmann announced that the
Course Guide will be printed in tabloid
form (like the Daily Thursday issue)
and distributed free to students next
year. It was also announced that the
Course Guide manager will receive a
$500 increase in salary this year to
$1500.

school year 1976-77 to the ASSU Se
nate Monday night saying the Univer
sity plans to "fill a $10 million gap
between income and expenditures
within the next three years" through a
budget equilibrium program.
Miller said 78 percent of the gap will
be filled through expenditure reduc
tions while 22 percent will be filled
through income increases.
"We are a labor intensive institu
tion," said Miller, and indicated most
of the cutbacks will be in direct
salaries and hired services.
The budget for hired services, such
as outside printing, will be reduced by
$1,303,000. A projected $3,245,000
cutback in salaried positions would af
fect all faculty positions.
"If a senior faculty member died, re
tired or left, the (department) head
would determine if he could be re
placed by a junior faculty member,"
said Miller. He described this as a "re
duced rank-reduced cost" situation.
Miller also provided statistics that
showed a decrease in engineering pro
fessors from 142 to 136 and an increase
in humanities and sciences faculty
from 415 to 445 since the school year
1969-70.
Unfounded fear
Miller said he used the figures
merely to show that the fear that
budget cuts have "decimated" the
number of faculty on campus is un
founded.
"The worst fears have not
materialized," said Miller.
Senators questioned Miller on tui
tion and tenure issues. ASSU Sen. Bill
Tyndall asked Miller whether the tui
tion rate increase will exceed the na
tional wage (increase) rate.
Beyond national rate
"For three years, the tuition will be
beyond the national wage rate. Much
of the actual dollar amount depends on

the inflation rate, however," said Mil
ler.
The tuition for 1976-77 will be
$4275, 12.2 percent more than this
year's tuition.
Commenting on the tenure issue,
Miller said that research should be re
garded as "a long term investment as
compared to teaching which is a short
term investment. It would be an
abomination of trust not to provide for
the future students."
Tenure selection
Sen. Bruce Reznick questioned te
nure selection procedures saying
"world-class researchers and indiffe
rent teachers" usually were given te
nure preference.
"Some math students I know are get
ting together to nominate a professor
for the Gores Award so that they can
get rid of him," said Reznick.
When Miller finished his presenta
tion, only nine of the original 13
senators present at the meeting re
mained to hear ASSU Vice President
Charlotte Germane give notice of two
ASSU constitutional amendments.
Fee Assessments
The first of the two proposed
amendments will change Article V,
Section 2 of the ASSU constitution to
read that the levying of an ASSU prog
ram fee, or a special fee assessment, is
unauthorized unless it is endorsed by
at least 10 percent of the student body,
as well as a majority of the students
voting in the election.
Currently, an assessment fee can be
levied on students if it receives a
majority of the vote in an election,
even if less than 10 percent of the stu
dent body votes for the assessment.
The second amendment proposes
changing all "sexisf'wording in the
constitution and to insert he/she,
him/her and his/her in all instances
where reference to one sex occurs.
Legal counseling
ASSU Vice President Josie Jaramillo
submitted a resolution asking for a fee
assessment of one dollar for Autumn
and Winter quarters of 1976-77 to sup
port the Legal Counseling Office (LCO)
located in the Old Firehouse. The re
solution was referred to the Finance
Committee for investigation into
LCO's actual need for funding.
Finance Committee Chairman Kevin
McDermott said the committee should
determine the LCO's actual need. "We

are trustees. We are to put what is best
for the student on the ballot."
The ASSU Course Guide manager.
Lance Friedmann announced that the
Course Guide will be printed in tabloid
form (like the Daily Thursday issue)
and distributed free to students next
year. It was also announced that the
Course Guide manager will receive a

$1500.
