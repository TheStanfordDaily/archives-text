# Correspondent claims broadcast news fulfills its responsibilities
## 
### Roy S. Johnson 
Despite the relatively small em
phasis which broadcast journalists
place on news, NBC correspondent
Carl Stern says he believes that the two
or three hours of news on television
daily allow the industry to fulfill "its
obligation to the American public."
In an informal talk given at the Law
School Lounge Monday night. Stern
touched on subjects ranging from the
role of the broadcast industry to the
Hearst trial in San Francisco, which he
is presently covering for NBC.

Stern said he bargains daily with his
bosses in New York for his time allot
ment. On the average, he receives
about one minute and forty-five sec
onds (or about eight sentences) to sum
up the day's events. But he said he
usually considers this sufficient.
"There are always those who want
more from news*" Stern noted. "For
them, there is Newsweek, Time, or
even the Chronicle.
"There is a vast market out there and
broadcasting is just one of many
sources of news."
Inevitable questioning
Before the inevitable questioning
about the Hearst trial began, Stern at
tempted to sum up what he felt would
be the main criteria in the final verdict
and what overall effect it would have
on precedents in law.
"I'm satisfied in my own mind that
Miss Hearst was forceably abducted by
the SLA," Stern said. "I also believe
that somewhere along the line she
might have become a revolutionary."
Hebelieves that the point of movement
is the crucial element in her defense.
Last week, defense attorney F. Lee
Bailey spoke here and noted that the
defendant was a "very good witness."
Stern said, "I didn't feel she was all
that convincing." He emphasized that
Patty wept and trembled on the stand.
He called her actions entirely under
standable, but said they were inconsis
tent. "I couldn't quite equate the Patty
on the stand with the Patty on the tapes
and in the film," he said.
At this stage of Hearst's trial, Stern
said he considers her acquittal likely.
"But the law will take a beating in any
case," he said. "There are a certain
number of special cases that can't be

proven either way. This is one of them.
"No one knows what went on in Pat
ty's mind during her captivity," he ad
ded, "and there is no way the law is
going to change that."
The audience included both law and
journalism students, so the questions
tipped back and forth between those
areas.
'Hard to talk'
Stem said he found it "hard to talk
about" events surrounding the sus
pension of CBS correspondent Daniel
Schorr because the case surrounded a
matter of "personal ethics."
CBS suspended Schorr after he ad
mitted leaking the final report of the
House Intelligence Committee to the
Village Voice. The network said
Schorr was in an "adversary position,"
because he was under investigation.
Stern said he felt Schorr's judge
ment as a journalist was wrong. He
said an employe of one news organiza
tion should not take information to
other outlets, "because then you are
becoming champion for an issue, and
stepping out of bounds of the role of
objective journalism."
Stern was in Washington at the time
of the Watergate hearings and gave his
account of the most stirring part of the
entire investigations. When Judge
John Sirica ordered the entire grand
jury to come out one-by-one and give
testimony affirming their belief in the
order for the President to turn over
subpoeaned tapes. Stern said, "I had
visions of King John and the Magna
Carta,"
"Here were ordinary poor people
from the D.C. area issuing orders to the
highest officer in the land, and that

used for all other decisions.
"The problem of modern society,"
Friedman said, "is to get everyone to
cooperate. This can be done by com
mand, or voluntary cooperation.
Command doesn't work, it breaks
down. Voluntary cooperation is the
most effective way to do good. The
19th century saw the closest thing to a
free market. It also saw the greatest
amount of eleemosynary (charitable)
activity."

Returning to his opening theme,
Friedman concluded that the success
of establishing voluntary cooperation
depends on whether people realize
that government attempts to do good
invariably have bad consequences.
Taxpayers revolt
In a question period after the speech.
Friedman offered a plan to reduce gov
ernment's infringement on the free
dom to spend. He called for a "tax
payer's revolt across the country, seek
ing a constitutional amendment that
would set a limit to the fraction of in
come that can be taxed away."
Friedman also said he saw little
reason to be concerned about natural
resource exhaustion, which he termed
"an artificial, false" problem or about
pollution, asserting that "the world is
far less polluted today than it was 200
years ago."
Friedman's speech was briefly inter
rupted when a dog walked across the
stage. As the hound passed by, Fried
man quipped "I knew Stanford was
loose and lax in its admission stan
dards."

Carl Stern says he believes that the two
or three hours of news on television
daily allow the industry to fulfill "its
obligation to the American public."
In an informal talk given at the Law
School Lounge Monday night. Stern
touched on subjects ranging from the
role of the broadcast industry to the
Hearst trial in San Francisco, which he
is presently covering for NBC.

Stern said he bargains daily with his
bosses in New York for his time allot
ment. On the average, he receives
about one minute and forty-five sec
onds (or about eight sentences) to sum
up the day's events. But he said he
usually considers this sufficient.
"There are always those who want
more from news*" Stern noted. "For
them, there is Newsweek, Time, or
even the Chronicle.
"There is a vast market out there and
broadcasting is just one of many
sources of news."
Inevitable questioning
Before the inevitable questioning
about the Hearst trial began, Stern at
tempted to sum up what he felt would
be the main criteria in the final verdict
and what overall effect it would have
on precedents in law.
"I'm satisfied in my own mind that
Miss Hearst was forceably abducted by
the SLA," Stern said. "I also believe
that somewhere along the line she
might have become a revolutionary."
Hebelieves that the point of movement
is the crucial element in her defense.
Last week, defense attorney F. Lee
Bailey spoke here and noted that the
defendant was a "very good witness."
Stern said, "I didn't feel she was all
that convincing." He emphasized that
Patty wept and trembled on the stand.
He called her actions entirely under
standable, but said they were inconsis
tent. "I couldn't quite equate the Patty
on the stand with the Patty on the tapes
and in the film," he said.
At this stage of Hearst's trial, Stern
said he considers her acquittal likely.
"But the law will take a beating in any
case," he said. "There are a certain
number of special cases that can't be

proven either way. This is one of them.
"No one knows what went on in Pat
ty's mind during her captivity," he ad
ded, "and there is no way the law is
going to change that."
The audience included both law and
journalism students, so the questions
tipped back and forth between those
areas.
'Hard to talk'
Stem said he found it "hard to talk
about" events surrounding the sus
pension of CBS correspondent Daniel
Schorr because the case surrounded a
matter of "personal ethics."
CBS suspended Schorr after he ad
mitted leaking the final report of the
House Intelligence Committee to the
Village Voice. The network said
Schorr was in an "adversary position,"
because he was under investigation.
Stern said he felt Schorr's judge
ment as a journalist was wrong. He
said an employe of one news organiza
tion should not take information to
other outlets, "because then you are
becoming champion for an issue, and
stepping out of bounds of the role of
objective journalism."
Stern was in Washington at the time
of the Watergate hearings and gave his
account of the most stirring part of the
entire investigations. When Judge
John Sirica ordered the entire grand
jury to come out one-by-one and give
testimony affirming their belief in the
order for the President to turn over
subpoeaned tapes. Stern said, "I had
visions of King John and the Magna
Carta,"
"Here were ordinary poor people
from the D.C. area issuing orders to the
highest officer in the land, and that

used for all other decisions.
"The problem of modern society,"
Friedman said, "is to get everyone to
cooperate. This can be done by com
mand, or voluntary cooperation.
Command doesn't work, it breaks
down. Voluntary cooperation is the
most effective way to do good. The
19th century saw the closest thing to a
free market. It also saw the greatest
amount of eleemosynary (charitable)
activity."

Returning to his opening theme,
Friedman concluded that the success
of establishing voluntary cooperation
depends on whether people realize
that government attempts to do good
invariably have bad consequences.
Taxpayers revolt
In a question period after the speech.
Friedman offered a plan to reduce gov
ernment's infringement on the free
dom to spend. He called for a "tax
payer's revolt across the country, seek
ing a constitutional amendment that
would set a limit to the fraction of in
come that can be taxed away."
Friedman also said he saw little
reason to be concerned about natural
resource exhaustion, which he termed
"an artificial, false" problem or about
pollution, asserting that "the world is
far less polluted today than it was 200
years ago."
Friedman's speech was briefly inter
rupted when a dog walked across the
stage. As the hound passed by, Fried
man quipped "I knew Stanford was
loose and lax in its admission stan
dards."

School Lounge Monday night. Stern
touched on subjects ranging from the
role of the broadcast industry to the
Hearst trial in San Francisco, which he
is presently covering for NBC.

Stern said he bargains daily with his
bosses in New York for his time allot
ment. On the average, he receives
about one minute and forty-five sec
onds (or about eight sentences) to sum
up the day's events. But he said he
usually considers this sufficient.
"There are always those who want
more from news*" Stern noted. "For
them, there is Newsweek, Time, or
even the Chronicle.
"There is a vast market out there and
broadcasting is just one of many
sources of news."
Inevitable questioning
Before the inevitable questioning
about the Hearst trial began, Stern at
tempted to sum up what he felt would
be the main criteria in the final verdict
and what overall effect it would have
on precedents in law.
"I'm satisfied in my own mind that
Miss Hearst was forceably abducted by
the SLA," Stern said. "I also believe
that somewhere along the line she
might have become a revolutionary."
Hebelieves that the point of movement
is the crucial element in her defense.
Last week, defense attorney F. Lee
Bailey spoke here and noted that the
defendant was a "very good witness."
Stern said, "I didn't feel she was all
that convincing." He emphasized that
Patty wept and trembled on the stand.
He called her actions entirely under
standable, but said they were inconsis
tent. "I couldn't quite equate the Patty
on the stand with the Patty on the tapes
and in the film," he said.
At this stage of Hearst's trial, Stern
said he considers her acquittal likely.
"But the law will take a beating in any
case," he said. "There are a certain
number of special cases that can't be

proven either way. This is one of them.
"No one knows what went on in Pat
ty's mind during her captivity," he ad
ded, "and there is no way the law is
going to change that."
The audience included both law and
journalism students, so the questions
tipped back and forth between those
areas.
'Hard to talk'
Stem said he found it "hard to talk
about" events surrounding the sus
pension of CBS correspondent Daniel
Schorr because the case surrounded a
matter of "personal ethics."
CBS suspended Schorr after he ad
mitted leaking the final report of the
House Intelligence Committee to the
Village Voice. The network said
Schorr was in an "adversary position,"
because he was under investigation.
Stern said he felt Schorr's judge
ment as a journalist was wrong. He
said an employe of one news organiza
tion should not take information to
other outlets, "because then you are
becoming champion for an issue, and
stepping out of bounds of the role of
objective journalism."
Stern was in Washington at the time
of the Watergate hearings and gave his
account of the most stirring part of the
entire investigations. When Judge
John Sirica ordered the entire grand
jury to come out one-by-one and give
testimony affirming their belief in the
order for the President to turn over
subpoeaned tapes. Stern said, "I had
visions of King John and the Magna
Carta,"
"Here were ordinary poor people
from the D.C. area issuing orders to the
highest officer in the land, and that

used for all other decisions.
"The problem of modern society,"
Friedman said, "is to get everyone to
cooperate. This can be done by com
mand, or voluntary cooperation.
Command doesn't work, it breaks
down. Voluntary cooperation is the
most effective way to do good. The
19th century saw the closest thing to a
free market. It also saw the greatest
amount of eleemosynary (charitable)
activity."

Returning to his opening theme,
Friedman concluded that the success
of establishing voluntary cooperation
depends on whether people realize
that government attempts to do good
invariably have bad consequences.
Taxpayers revolt
In a question period after the speech.
Friedman offered a plan to reduce gov
ernment's infringement on the free
dom to spend. He called for a "tax
payer's revolt across the country, seek
ing a constitutional amendment that
would set a limit to the fraction of in
come that can be taxed away."
Friedman also said he saw little
reason to be concerned about natural
resource exhaustion, which he termed
"an artificial, false" problem or about
pollution, asserting that "the world is
far less polluted today than it was 200
years ago."
Friedman's speech was briefly inter
rupted when a dog walked across the
stage. As the hound passed by, Fried
man quipped "I knew Stanford was
loose and lax in its admission stan
dards."
Despite the relatively small em
phasis which broadcast journalists
place on news, NBC correspondent
Carl Stern says he believes that the two
or three hours of news on television
daily allow the industry to fulfill "its
obligation to the American public."
