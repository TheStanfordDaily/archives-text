# Lunde says murder rate high

### Kathy Ellison 
A child born in the U.S. today
has a one in 200 chance of being
murdered, and in some parts of
the country, that figure may be as
high as one in 150, Psychiatry
Prof. Donald Lunde told an au
dience of 50 in Tresidder Union
last Thursday.
"Last year jn the United
States, some 20,000 citizens
were murdered. In all of the 10
years of the Vietnam war, how
ever, a total of 50,000 Americans
were killed," Lunde added.
Author of the Portable Stan
ford book Murder and Madness,
Lunde repeatedly stressed that
the United States has a dispro
portionate number of murders.
"While our murder rate for last
year numbered over 20,000, Eng
land had only 50 murders in that
time," he said.
.Lunde also expressed alarm
over the recent marked increase
in the U.S. murder rate.
Murders frequent
"The people who die in this
country due to murder number
more than those who die from
leukemia, muscular dystrophy,
or many other serious diseases,"
Lunde pointed out, refuting the
notion that murder is a compara
tively rare cause of death in
America.
Another common fallacy, ac
cording to Lunde, is that most

murders are committed by luna
tics or as part of another crime.
The truth is that the most
common type of murder takes
place within the home and in
volves either husbands killing
their wives or wives killing their
husbands, Lunde said. Most
wives will kill their husbands in
the kitchen, while husbands
usually tend to kill their wives in
the bedroom, he added.
And, while husbands most
often use guns, their spouses use
knives, according to Lunde.
Lunde became involved with

the study of murder in 1970, the
year of three mass murders in
Santa Cruz. Then a frequenter of
federal and state courts in the
capacity of examining psychiat
rist, Lunde examined the men
responsible and testified before
the court.
It was at that time that he
began to feel an interest "to
explore law, society and the way
the American legal system deals
with people like this," Lunde
explained.
Lunde was also involved in
the trial of Herbert Mullen, the
schizophrenic murderer who be
lieved he had to kill his innocent
victims in order to prevent
California from falling into thf
sea. During the question and
answer period following his
talk, Lunde played a tape of Mul
len elaborating on this theme.
Hearst trials
Most recently, Lunde has been
a part of the Patty Hearst trials,
which he declined to speak ofl
during his lecture.
Lunde's speech centered on
the main trends of murder in
America, and what he feels can
be done to stem the rapidly in
creasing rate. Lunde said he feels
gun controls "wouldn't have ef
fect, due to the high number o!
guns loose. Short of a house-to
house search, there's no way
you're going to disarm this coun
try."
However, Lunde said that in
stead, the government should
control ammunition, because
unlike guns, ammunition "goes
bad" after years of storage.
While there is no single major
cause of murder in the United
States today, Lunde suggested
that part of the blame may be as
signed to the "socially
sanctioned" violence viewed b;^ !
millions everyday on television.
Another cause, he said, might
be the American cultural em
phasis on external conditions
being responsible for personal
unhappiness.

It was at that time that he
began to feel an interest "to
explore law, society and the way
the American legal system deals
with people like this," Lunde
explained.
Lunde was also involved in
the trial of Herbert Mullen, the
schizophrenic murderer who be
lieved he had to kill his innocent
victims in order to prevent
California from falling into thf
sea. During the question and
answer period following his
talk, Lunde played a tape of Mul
len elaborating on this theme.
Hearst trials
Most recently, Lunde has been
a part of the Patty Hearst trials,
which he declined to speak ofl
during his lecture.
Lunde's speech centered on
the main trends of murder in
America, and what he feels can
be done to stem the rapidly in
creasing rate. Lunde said he feels
gun controls "wouldn't have ef
fect, due to the high number o!
guns loose. Short of a house-to
house search, there's no way
you're going to disarm this coun
try."
However, Lunde said that in
stead, the government should
control ammunition, because
unlike guns, ammunition "goes
bad" after years of storage.
While there is no single major
cause of murder in the United
States today, Lunde suggested
that part of the blame may be as
signed to the "socially
sanctioned" violence viewed b;^ !
millions everyday on television.
Another cause, he said, might
be the American cultural em
phasis on external conditions
being responsible for personal
unhappiness.


Donald Lunde
A child born in the U.S. today
has a one in 200 chance of being
murdered, and in some parts of
the country, that figure may be as
high as one in 150, Psychiatry
Prof. Donald Lunde told an au
dience of 50 in Tresidder Union
last Thursday.
"Last year jn the United
States, some 20,000 citizens
were murdered. In all of the 10
years of the Vietnam war, how
ever, a total of 50,000 Americans
were killed," Lunde added.
Author of the Portable Stan
ford book Murder and Madness,
Lunde repeatedly stressed that
the United States has a dispro
portionate number of murders.
"While our murder rate for last
year numbered over 20,000, Eng
land had only 50 murders in that
time," he said.
.Lunde also expressed alarm
over the recent marked increase
in the U.S. murder rate.
Murders frequent
"The people who die in this
country due to murder number
more than those who die from
leukemia, muscular dystrophy,
or many other serious diseases,"
Lunde pointed out, refuting the
notion that murder is a compara
tively rare cause of death in
America.
Another common fallacy, ac
cording to Lunde, is that most

murders are committed by luna
tics or as part of another crime.
The truth is that the most
common type of murder takes
place within the home and in
volves either husbands killing
their wives or wives killing their
husbands, Lunde said. Most
wives will kill their husbands in
the kitchen, while husbands
usually tend to kill their wives in
the bedroom, he added.
And, while husbands most
often use guns, their spouses use
knives, according to Lunde.
Lunde became involved with

the study of murder in 1970, the
year of three mass murders in
Santa Cruz. Then a frequenter of
federal and state courts in the
capacity of examining psychiat
rist, Lunde examined the men
responsible and testified before
the court.
It was at that time that he
began to feel an interest "to
explore law, society and the way
the American legal system deals

explained.
