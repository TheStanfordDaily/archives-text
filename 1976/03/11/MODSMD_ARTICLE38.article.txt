# For foreign grad students
## English ability developed

Adjusting to rigorous univer
sity classes is difficult for most
students, but lack of working
knowledge of English can seri
ously hinder academic perfor
mance.
The Stanford program in En
glish for Foreign Students(EFS),
under the auspices of the Lin
guistics Department, provides
foreign graduate students with a
structured program for im
provement in aural comprehen
sion, speaking and writing.
According to Senior Linguis
tics Lecturer Freida Politzer,

"We've expanded to include a
variety of classes geared to fit
specific needs." In addition to
basic English skills, the program
includes courses in academic
orientation, vocabulary expan
sion, note-taking, and the pre
sentation of theses and term
papers.
Each foreign student, prior to
acceptance into a graduate prog
ram, is required to take the Test
of English as a Foreign Language
(TOEFL), administered by the
Educational Testing Service.
The composite score deter
mines whether the student will
be exempted from the Stanford
English Placement Test or will
be required to take English clas
ses before enrolling in his degree
program.
Proficiency level
"On the basis of the Placement
Test, which includes an inter
view, we decide how many units
of English classes each student
should take," explained
Politzer. "We have a responsibil

ity to the student and his
academic department to help
him attain a level of proficiency
in English adequate for his
academic needs."
Many of the students in the
EFS program are graduates in
engineering, earth sciences,
education, or related fields. "We
have to arrange our schedule
around student's schedules,"
said Politzer. "We also offer an
intensive program in summer
which helps prepare in-coming
students for the next academic
year."
Funding for the program
comes from the School of
Humanities and Sciences. Lin
guistics lecturer Beverley
McChesney commented, "We
make up just a small part of the
Linguistics department budget."
'English the tool'
"English is the tool," said
Politzer, "not the result. We
want their pronunciation to be
good enough for them to speak
in a seminar or class. Getting

their degree is their goal ... and
ours too."
McChesney noted that, "We
see some amazing results." Kat
sumi Muraki, a graduate student
in statistics, has taken several of
the EFS courses and has gone on
to audit a class in methods of
teaching English to foreign stu
dents. "He's one of our most in
terested students," said Politzer.
Both McChesney and Politzer
agree that for the students, the
value of getting to know other
foreign students is a very impor
tant aspect of the program.
Politzer stressed the fact that
though the program was willing
to help undergraduates with par
ticularly serious pronunciation
difficulties, "Bechtel Interna
tional Center offers specific
courses for the other non-native
speakers on campus."
Politzer added that Lingusi
tics offers introductory courses
in teaching English for Volun
teers in Asia.
