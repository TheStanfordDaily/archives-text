# 'Military should get tough'
## Zumwalt criticizes detente 
### Kathy Batts 
"I would prefer that we be in a pos
ition of mutual terror, rather than let
ting the United States stand in terror of
the Soviet Union," retired Admiral
Elmo Zumwalt told a crowd of 200 in
Kresge Auditorium Tuesday.
The former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff spoke on "Detente: The
Basic Questions" as part of a speakers
series sponsored by the Conservative
Forum. Zumwalt served as chief of
naval operations from 1970-74.
An outspoken critic of detente, he is
currently seeking the Democratic
nomination for U.S. Senate from Vir
ginia, a seat now held by Robert Byrd.
According to Zumwalt, there is no
fdetente between the U.S. and the
U.S.S.R., but there is not much chance
of nuclear war between the two super
powers either. "Each side respects too
much the dangers of a nuclear
holocaust," he said.
Calculations
Instead, Zumwalt noted, each side
will calculate the other's strength and
decide who is superior. The inferior
country will then simply accom
modate the other.
Zumwalt said the U.S. has already
been put in the position of accom
modating the Soviets. He cited the Oc
tober 1973 Yom Kip pur war in the
Mideast as a decisive turning point in
the positions of the Americans and the
Soviets.
"The Soviets gave the United States
an ultimatum," Zumwalt said, "that
unless we forced Israel to release the

Egyptian Third Army, their military
forces would come in and do the job
themselves. And we just backed
down."
The U.S. had no choice but to back
down, he claimed.
"We didn't have the military capa
bility to call their bluff," he said, ad
ding that as of 1971, the Soviets had
outspent the United States by 60 per
cent in strategic defense and by 25 per
cent in conventional defense.
Defense spending
Defense spending takes up 12 per
cent of the U.S.S.R. gross national pro
duct but only five percent of the U.S.
GNF, Zumwalt said. However, he
claimed, the U.S. could alleviate the
discrepancy by increasing defense
spending to six percent of the GNP.
"At the time of the Cuban missile
crisis, the National Security Council
calculated that 10 times as many
Soviet citizens would have died as
Americans, had we entered into war
with the Soviet Union," he said. "To
day that simply isn't so."
Zumwalt claimed the Soviets hold a
four-fold megatonnage advantage over
the U.S. and nearly three times as
many warheads in their nuclear arse
nal.
"These are the same advantages the
U.S. held in 1962," he said.
The admiral claimed the U.S. had
accepted a "non-negotiated inferior
ity" at the first Strategic Arms Limita
tion Talks (SALT). "And this leaves
out the problem of Soviet violations of
SALT," he added.

He claimed there were clear viola
tions of the SALT agreements by the
Soviet Union, "but we went right
ahead and signed the Vladivostok ac
cord in 1974."
Zumwalt predicted that the U.S.
would continue to accommodate the
Soviet Union in the future.
"They violate the crop forecast ag
reement while procuring our wheat;
they are helping Hanoi to violate the
Vietnam truce. Soon they'll step up
their involvement in Rhodesia and
South Africa, before moving on to
Zaire, where Africa's wealth is.
"The Soviets are bragging about
their victories," he said. "Soon they'll

be aiming for the Finlandization of
Europe."
Zumwalt said Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger had told him pri
vately that he fears the way of the fu
ture will be the Soviet way. However,
Kissinger refuses to make that state
ment publicly, Zumwalt said.
The admiral called for U.S. leaders
to start reporting Soviet misconduct to
the American people; to measure the
promise and performance of SALT I
along with U.S. military strength of
yesterday, today and the future; and
for the U.S. to take a tough negotiating
stance, using American wheat,
technology and trade as bargaining
chips.
Adjunct Political Science Prof.
Lawrence Weiler, a former member of

the SALT negotiating team, disagreed
with Zumwalt, saying, "We are not a
besieged state."
Weiler said the Soviets may surpass
the U.S. in some military areas, but
they do not yet possess the technology
for a war-winning capability.
Weiler and Zumwalt also clashed on
the importance of civil defense in both
the Soviet Union and the United
States. Zumwalt insisted it should be
the United States' number one prior
ity, whereas Weiler said it only aggra
vated the hostage relationship bet
ween the two powers, escalating the
arms race.
Weiler defended detente, saying,
"Ninety percent of detente is to reduce
the danger of nuclear war. There is no
alternative to that and therefore no al
ternative to detente."

U.S.S.R., but there is not much chance
of nuclear war between the two super
powers either. "Each side respects too
much the dangers of a nuclear
holocaust," he said.
Calculations
Instead, Zumwalt noted, each side
will calculate the other's strength and
decide who is superior. The inferior
country will then simply accom
modate the other.
Zumwalt said the U.S. has already
been put in the position of accom
modating the Soviets. He cited the Oc
tober 1973 Yom Kip pur war in the
Mideast as a decisive turning point in
the positions of the Americans and the
Soviets.
"The Soviets gave the United States
an ultimatum," Zumwalt said, "that
unless we forced Israel to release the

Egyptian Third Army, their military
forces would come in and do the job
themselves. And we just backed
down."
The U.S. had no choice but to back
down, he claimed.
"We didn't have the military capa
bility to call their bluff," he said, ad
ding that as of 1971, the Soviets had
outspent the United States by 60 per
cent in strategic defense and by 25 per
cent in conventional defense.
Defense spending
Defense spending takes up 12 per
cent of the U.S.S.R. gross national pro
duct but only five percent of the U.S.
GNF, Zumwalt said. However, he
claimed, the U.S. could alleviate the
discrepancy by increasing defense
spending to six percent of the GNP.
"At the time of the Cuban missile
crisis, the National Security Council
calculated that 10 times as many
Soviet citizens would have died as
Americans, had we entered into war
with the Soviet Union," he said. "To
day that simply isn't so."
Zumwalt claimed the Soviets hold a
four-fold megatonnage advantage over
the U.S. and nearly three times as
many warheads in their nuclear arse
nal.
"These are the same advantages the
U.S. held in 1962," he said.
The admiral claimed the U.S. had
accepted a "non-negotiated inferior
ity" at the first Strategic Arms Limita
tion Talks (SALT). "And this leaves
out the problem of Soviet violations of
SALT," he added.

He claimed there were clear viola
tions of the SALT agreements by the
Soviet Union, "but we went right
ahead and signed the Vladivostok ac
cord in 1974."
Zumwalt predicted that the U.S.
would continue to accommodate the
Soviet Union in the future.
"They violate the crop forecast ag
reement while procuring our wheat;
they are helping Hanoi to violate the
Vietnam truce. Soon they'll step up
their involvement in Rhodesia and
South Africa, before moving on to
Zaire, where Africa's wealth is.
"The Soviets are bragging about
their victories," he said. "Soon they'll

be aiming for the Finlandization of
Europe."
Zumwalt said Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger had told him pri
vately that he fears the way of the fu
ture will be the Soviet way. However,
Kissinger refuses to make that state
ment publicly, Zumwalt said.
The admiral called for U.S. leaders
to start reporting Soviet misconduct to
the American people; to measure the
promise and performance of SALT I
along with U.S. military strength of
yesterday, today and the future; and
for the U.S. to take a tough negotiating
stance, using American wheat,
technology and trade as bargaining
chips.
Adjunct Political Science Prof.
Lawrence Weiler, a former member of

the SALT negotiating team, disagreed
with Zumwalt, saying, "We are not a
besieged state."
Weiler said the Soviets may surpass
the U.S. in some military areas, but
they do not yet possess the technology
for a war-winning capability.
Weiler and Zumwalt also clashed on
the importance of civil defense in both
the Soviet Union and the United
States. Zumwalt insisted it should be
the United States' number one prior
ity, whereas Weiler said it only aggra
vated the hostage relationship bet
ween the two powers, escalating the
arms race.
Weiler defended detente, saying,
"Ninety percent of detente is to reduce
the danger of nuclear war. There is no
alternative to that and therefore no al
ternative to detente."
"I would prefer that we be in a pos
ition of mutual terror, rather than let
ting the United States stand in terror of
the Soviet Union," retired Admiral
Elmo Zumwalt told a crowd of 200 in
Kresge Auditorium Tuesday.
The former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff spoke on "Detente: The
Basic Questions" as part of a speakers
series sponsored by the Conservative
Forum. Zumwalt served as chief of
naval operations from 1970-74.
An outspoken critic of detente, he is
currently seeking the Democratic
nomination for U.S. Senate from Vir
ginia, a seat now held by Robert Byrd.

unless we forced Israel to release the

Egyptian Third Army, their military
forces would come in and do the job
themselves. And we just backed
down."
The U.S. had no choice but to back
down, he claimed.
"We didn't have the military capa
bility to call their bluff," he said, ad
ding that as of 1971, the Soviets had
outspent the United States by 60 per
cent in strategic defense and by 25 per
cent in conventional defense.
Defense spending
Defense spending takes up 12 per
cent of the U.S.S.R. gross national pro
duct but only five percent of the U.S.
GNF, Zumwalt said. However, he
claimed, the U.S. could alleviate the
discrepancy by increasing defense
spending to six percent of the GNP.
"At the time of the Cuban missile
crisis, the National Security Council
calculated that 10 times as many
Soviet citizens would have died as
Americans, had we entered into war
with the Soviet Union," he said. "To
day that simply isn't so."
Zumwalt claimed the Soviets hold a
four-fold megatonnage advantage over
the U.S. and nearly three times as
many warheads in their nuclear arse
nal.
"These are the same advantages the
U.S. held in 1962," he said.
The admiral claimed the U.S. had
accepted a "non-negotiated inferior
ity" at the first Strategic Arms Limita
tion Talks (SALT). "And this leaves
out the problem of Soviet violations of
SALT," he added.

He claimed there were clear viola
tions of the SALT agreements by the
Soviet Union, "but we went right
ahead and signed the Vladivostok ac
cord in 1974."
Zumwalt predicted that the U.S.
would continue to accommodate the
Soviet Union in the future.
"They violate the crop forecast ag
reement while procuring our wheat;
they are helping Hanoi to violate the
Vietnam truce. Soon they'll step up
their involvement in Rhodesia and
South Africa, before moving on to
Zaire, where Africa's wealth is.
"The Soviets are bragging about
their victories," he said. "Soon they'll

be aiming for the Finlandization of
Europe."
Zumwalt said Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger had told him pri
vately that he fears the way of the fu
ture will be the Soviet way. However,
Kissinger refuses to make that state
ment publicly, Zumwalt said.
The admiral called for U.S. leaders
to start reporting Soviet misconduct to
the American people; to measure the
promise and performance of SALT I
along with U.S. military strength of
yesterday, today and the future; and
for the U.S. to take a tough negotiating
stance, using American wheat,
technology and trade as bargaining
chips.
Adjunct Political Science Prof.
Lawrence Weiler, a former member of

the SALT negotiating team, disagreed
with Zumwalt, saying, "We are not a
besieged state."
Weiler said the Soviets may surpass
the U.S. in some military areas, but
they do not yet possess the technology
for a war-winning capability.
Weiler and Zumwalt also clashed on
the importance of civil defense in both
the Soviet Union and the United
States. Zumwalt insisted it should be
the United States' number one prior
ity, whereas Weiler said it only aggra
vated the hostage relationship bet
ween the two powers, escalating the
arms race.
Weiler defended detente, saying,
"Ninety percent of detente is to reduce
the danger of nuclear war. There is no
alternative to that and therefore no al
ternative to detente."
"I would prefer that we be in a pos
ition of mutual terror, rather than let
ting the United States stand in terror of
the Soviet Union," retired Admiral
Elmo Zumwalt told a crowd of 200 in
Kresge Auditorium Tuesday.
The former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff spoke on "Detente: The
Basic Questions" as part of a speakers
series sponsored by the Conservative
Forum. Zumwalt served as chief of
naval operations from 1970-74.
An outspoken critic of detente, he is
currently seeking the Democratic
nomination for U.S. Senate from Vir
ginia, a seat now held by Robert Byrd.
According to Zumwalt, there is no
fdetente between the U.S. and the
U.S.S.R., but there is not much chance
of nuclear war between the two super
powers either. "Each side respects too
much the dangers of a nuclear
holocaust," he said.
Calculations
Instead, Zumwalt noted, each side
will calculate the other's strength and
decide who is superior. The inferior
country will then simply accom
modate the other.
Zumwalt said the U.S. has already
been put in the position of accom
modating the Soviets. He cited the Oc
tober 1973 Yom Kip pur war in the
Mideast as a decisive turning point in
the positions of the Americans and the
Soviets.
"The Soviets gave the United States
an ultimatum," Zumwalt said, "that

Egyptian Third Army, their military
