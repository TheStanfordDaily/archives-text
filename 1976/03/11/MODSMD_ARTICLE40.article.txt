# Brezhnev stresses commitment to detente policy
## 
### 
In his speech to the 25th Party Congress, Leonid
Brezhnev reemphasized his commitment to a pol
icy of detente. The London Times reported,
"promising that the Soviet Union would shortly
produce some proposals in the spirit of Helsinki,
Mr. Brezhnev said that the Kremlin had given the
greatest attention to ways of improving relations
with the United States in line with the directives
of the 24th Party Congress."
Brezhnev reiterated his desire for a worldwide
conference on disarmament as well as a global
agreement precluding the use of force in the set
tlement of disputes. The London Times dismissed
the familiar litany of peace proposals as a "prop
aganda exercise."

With reference to the Soviet Union the London
Times observed, "no country shows fewer signs of
being willing to renounce force."
During his speech, Brezhnev also offered a new
proposal for breaking the deadlock at the force
reduction talks in Vienna. The Soviet Party chief
proposed that the United States and the Soviet
Union be the first to cut force levels. These cuts
are to be followed by similar reductions in Euro
pean troop concentrations.
While Brezhnev praised detente by saying, "De
tente has become the leading trend; that is the
main outcome of the party's international policy,
and the Soviet people can be proud of it,"he had
stern words for those who hope to use detente as a

lever to influence Soviet domestic policy.
Criticizing foreign efforts to intervene in Soviet
internal affairs, he noted that "this is not the lan
guage to use when speaking to the Soviet Union."
Brezhnev also stated that detente does not
freeze the world into the status quo. Brezhnev
declared continued Soviet support for national
liberation movements such as those in Angola
andVietnam. Brezhnev further contended that de
tente offers the Soviet Union a productive envi
ronment for advancing communism.
'Communist construction'
"We make no secret of the fact that we see de
tente as the way to create more favorable condi
tions for peaceful socialist and Communist con

struction," said Brezhnev.
It appears that the policy of detente will
reemerge from the Congress as guiding principle
in Soviet relations with the West. Brezhnev is a
strong proponent of detente and it seems likely
that he will leave the Congress with his powers
intact, if not enhanced.
The New York Times reported that some obser
vers believe that the accolades recently accorded
Brezhnev are only exceeded by those offered Sta
lin.
