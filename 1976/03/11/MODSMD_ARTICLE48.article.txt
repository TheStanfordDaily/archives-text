## Dark of the Moon' Local drama brilliant 
### Elizabeth Kelley 
Watch out Palo Alto. Someone with imagina
tion and ability has finally come to town. Some
one has come who will shield us from the pathe
ticly produced Mammy's Town and Orestiea of
days gone by.
His name is Richard Walter and through the
Bureau of Western Mythology (an affiliate of the
Council for the Arts, Palo Alto) he has brought the
screen-play version of Dark of the Moon to the
stage of the Stanford Music Hall. It is a sight to
behold. Walter has his faults, but his brilliance
more than compensates.
Dark of the Moon, written by Howard
Richardson and Frances Goforth, harks back to an
old Appalachian legend about the love of a witch
boy for a girl named Barbara Allen and how he
assumes human form to stay by her side until the
prejudice and fear of the townfolk cause the forfei
ture of his dreams and her life.
This basic story should revive old memories of
high school and college thespians alike, for it has
become one of the 10 most produced plays of the
last 20 years. Those of us who have been in it
know it is not an easy show to bring off well.
Conjur
Now, however, comes Walter's multimedia
stage adaptation of the screenplay. His creative
hand as a director coupled with some (if you will
pardon the pun) dramatic script changes have
given the play a new completeness and a new
credibility. Using the multimedia format, Walter
has exposed more of the town's life and personal
ity than has heretofore been seen.
There were, however, several instances of tech
nical heavy handedness that hopefully might be
toned down, if not eliminated, during the show's
run. The set, though impressive by itself, is too
ostentatious and sophisticated to fit the nature of
the play.
Likewise overly sophisticated (and unneces
sary) is the cinematography depicting the sexual
interludes of Barbara and John. The graphic na
ture of the film detracted from the play and, as
with the set, stood out as an entity in and of itself
rather than blending with the whole work.

The most disappointing moment in the show
came at the end, after Barbara had died and John
had returned to the witches. The stage had
cleared, the tragedy was complete. There was si
lence. And then the audience was blasted by the
simulation of the eagle's cry. It was disruptive,
insensitive and a lapse of artistic judgement. In
this one moment, all the effort of a good, energetic
and quite dedicated cast seemed for nought.
Energy
The cast seemed quite beyond this technical
falderal. At times their pacing was off, but the
spirit was willing. They are to be congratulated
for their energy and persistence, if not always for
good acting.
Perhaps the most delightful character in the
production was one found in this screenplay
adaptation but not in the original Broadway
script. This was the mountain troubador; a bal
ladeer to sing the story with the help of his guitar
and a deadpan banjo picker. A touch of Deliver
ance and a touch of reality, he became the thread
that bound the players to the play and gave Dark
of the Moon the consistency it has always lacked.
Special kudos, then, to Jesse Miller for his adroit,
low keyed handling of the part.
Sammi Gavich turned in a strong performance
as the loose and flirtatious Barbara Allen, but had
trouble with the transition from tease to the
woman who loves her man.
The townspeople, on the other hand, were de
lightful. In particular, Miss Metcalf (Joan Sims-
Putnam) gives one pause for smiling again and
again as she fervently directs the townfolk in their
Southern Baptist like hymns. Her voice is strong
and commanding; her no-nonsense attitude
makes Miss Metcalf a memorable personage.
Likewise, Pat D'Alessandro turned in a joyful,
Godfearing performance as Mrs. Sumney.
Overall, this show is worth seeing. It has imagi
nation, energy, talent, and dedication going for it.
And the few flaws that exist — well, those are just
things for reviewers to carp about.
Dark of the Moon will continue at the Stanford
Music Hall until March 21.
