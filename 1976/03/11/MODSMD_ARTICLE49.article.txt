Hurry, this gorgeous combina
tion of talents will only be
around until the beginning of
March. The Spring Opera
Theatre has brought together
young and developing artists to
produce an imaginative and ex
citing opera in the small and in
timate setting of the Curran
Theatre in San Francisco. What a
pleasure to have them sing in
English so that the audience can
appreciate and enjoy all facets of
the performance.
A reverant and stylishly
staged Bach's St. Matthew Pas
sion is being repeated after its

widely acclaimed production in
1973. The audience was emo
tionally involved in the Mass —
in the slow pantomine and de
lightful staging and musicality.
Director Gerald Freedman,
who incidentally staged the first
production of Hair in the Ken
nedy Center, created a produc
tion that grows out of Bach's un
ique conception of a mystery
play.
The production occurs at three
temporal levels: The Passion
plays who act and sing their
parts from a central area, the two
choruses in gold vestments of
the. 17th century, and the com

municants from our time who
are drawn into the action as wor
shippers.
The singing of the two
choruses which included the
San Francisco Boys Chorus of
fers Bach at its finest. The or
chestra was conducted by the
first woman conductor for the
San Francisco Opera Company,
Fiora Contino.
