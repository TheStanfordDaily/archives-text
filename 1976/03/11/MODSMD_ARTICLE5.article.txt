# University to pay U.S. on prof overcharges
## 
### William Ross 
The University has agreed to reim
burse about $128,000 to the federal
government after a federal
audit showed that many faculty mem
bers, engaged in federally funded re
search, were overcharging the gov
ernment for outside consulting pro
jects.
Federal and University officials as
sume that the overcharging was unin
tentional and occurred because the
University's guidelines on consulting
were ambiguous, according to Robert
Simmons, manager of the Sponsored
Projects Office.
"The professors made honest mis
takes," Simmons said. "No one was
trying to defraud the government. The
mistakes were not made for the sake of

personal aggrandizement."
University guidelines state that a
professor can spend one day a week
consulting for private firms or gov
ernment agencies outside the Univer
sity, Simmons explained.
Although this means a professor
will be paid for working no more than
one day in seven, some professors as
sumed that it meant one day in five,
Simmons said. The government paid
the professors without checking the
number of days they had worked.
Guidelines
The guidelines were established as
part of the University personnel pol
icy, but are subject to review by the
federal Defense Contract Audit
Agency (DCAA), he added.
Three cases of overcharging were
uncovered last summer during a
DCAA audit of University research ex
penses, according to Simmons.
The University reimbursed the gov
ernment for about $25,000 and agreed
to cooperate with the DCAA in a ran
dom sample survey of outside consult
ing conducted with the DCAA.
15 in survey
Some 15 faculty members were
selected for the survey, which covered
a 30-month period ending June 30,
1975. One person was found to have
exceeded the one-day-in-seven limit.
The University then extrapolated
the amount overcharged in this case to
1/15 of the approximately 500
faculty members engaged in federally
funded research and agreed to pay the
government an extra $100,000.
Earl Cilley, director of the Sponsord
Projects Office, explained that the
University audited only 15 of the 500
faculty members engaged in federally
funded research because it would have
been too costly to audit all 500.
"The cost would have been as
tronomical," Cilley said."By conduct
ing a sample we avoided investing
umpteen hours of manpower in a pro
ject that probably wouldn't have
yielded different results."
He said that the random sample was
scientifically selected and provides a

reasonable basis for assuming that
roughly one professor in 15 was over
charging the government.
William Massy, vice provost for re
search, emphasized that the total
amount overcharged represented less
than one percent of the total amount of
government research expense here
during the past 30 months.
"The sample indicated that this is
not a widespread problem," Massy
said.
Reimbursement payments will be
drawn from a special account within
University general funds that has been
set aside to pay for accounting errors,
Cilley said.
Names not revealed
The University did not reveal the
names of the professors involved be
cause it did not want to embarrass pro
fessors for what were believed to be
honest mistakes. Cilley said.
"Since we had an ambiguous policy
that could be read several ways, and
there is no indication that the govern
ment did not get its money's worth, we
don't see that there is any reason at all
to embarrass anyone," Cilley said.
Cilley noted that until the audit, no
University administrators ever had
guessed that some professors might be
misinterpreting the research statement
issued by the Provost's Office and pub
lished in the Faculty Handbook.
"The problem was rooted in his
tory," Massy said. "The original draft
ing of the guidelines go back a long
way. In the absence of any visible prob
lem, the matter was not focused upon
until the time of the audit."
The University has recently clarified
its guidelines to make explicit that
"one day a week" means "one day in
seven."
The new guidelines explain that
fulltime professors may spend up to 13
days every three months in consulta
tion.
They must receive special permis
sion to exceed this limit.

Some 15 faculty members were
selected for the survey, which covered
a 30-month period ending June 30,
1975. One person was found to have
exceeded the one-day-in-seven limit.
The University then extrapolated
the amount overcharged in this case to
1/15 of the approximately 500
faculty members engaged in federally
funded research and agreed to pay the
government an extra $100,000.
Earl Cilley, director of the Sponsord
Projects Office, explained that the
University audited only 15 of the 500
faculty members engaged in federally
funded research because it would have
been too costly to audit all 500.
"The cost would have been as
tronomical," Cilley said."By conduct
ing a sample we avoided investing
umpteen hours of manpower in a pro
ject that probably wouldn't have
yielded different results."
He said that the random sample was
scientifically selected and provides a

reasonable basis for assuming that
roughly one professor in 15 was over
charging the government.
William Massy, vice provost for re
search, emphasized that the total
amount overcharged represented less
than one percent of the total amount of
government research expense here
during the past 30 months.
"The sample indicated that this is
not a widespread problem," Massy
said.
Reimbursement payments will be
drawn from a special account within
University general funds that has been
set aside to pay for accounting errors,
Cilley said.
Names not revealed
The University did not reveal the
names of the professors involved be
cause it did not want to embarrass pro
fessors for what were believed to be
honest mistakes. Cilley said.
"Since we had an ambiguous policy
that could be read several ways, and
there is no indication that the govern
ment did not get its money's worth, we
don't see that there is any reason at all
to embarrass anyone," Cilley said.
Cilley noted that until the audit, no
University administrators ever had
guessed that some professors might be
misinterpreting the research statement
issued by the Provost's Office and pub
lished in the Faculty Handbook.
"The problem was rooted in his
tory," Massy said. "The original draft
ing of the guidelines go back a long
way. In the absence of any visible prob
lem, the matter was not focused upon
until the time of the audit."
The University has recently clarified
its guidelines to make explicit that
"one day a week" means "one day in
seven."
The new guidelines explain that
fulltime professors may spend up to 13
days every three months in consulta
tion.
They must receive special permis
sion to exceed this limit.
The University has agreed to reim
burse about $128,000 to the federal
government after a federal
audit showed that many faculty mem
bers, engaged in federally funded re
search, were overcharging the gov
ernment for outside consulting pro
jects.
Federal and University officials as
sume that the overcharging was unin
tentional and occurred because the
University's guidelines on consulting
were ambiguous, according to Robert
Simmons, manager of the Sponsored
Projects Office.
"The professors made honest mis
takes," Simmons said. "No one was
trying to defraud the government. The
mistakes were not made for the sake of

personal aggrandizement."
University guidelines state that a
professor can spend one day a week
consulting for private firms or gov
ernment agencies outside the Univer
sity, Simmons explained.
Although this means a professor
will be paid for working no more than
one day in seven, some professors as
sumed that it meant one day in five,
Simmons said. The government paid
the professors without checking the
number of days they had worked.
Guidelines
The guidelines were established as
part of the University personnel pol
icy, but are subject to review by the
federal Defense Contract Audit
Agency (DCAA), he added.
Three cases of overcharging were
uncovered last summer during a
DCAA audit of University research ex
penses, according to Simmons.
The University reimbursed the gov
ernment for about $25,000 and agreed
to cooperate with the DCAA in a ran
dom sample survey of outside consult
ing conducted with the DCAA.
