# Ballet: polished pastiche
## 
### Mark Winkler 
Ballet is an art form demand
ing artistry, strength, precision,
timing and grace.
The San Francisco Ballet dis
played all of the following to
perfection in its second produc
tion, consisting of four pieces:
Variations De Ballet, The Eter
nal Idol, Don Juan and
Souvenirs.
Variations De Ballet dramati
cally opened the show. It was a
light and gay piece, though rela
tively classical.
It brought out various styles of
ballet, high-lighting not only the
dazzling skill of the individual
dancers but also the magnificent
choreography of George Balan
chine.
His use of the corps de ballet
with the otherwise empty stage,
was strikingly combined with
the precision of the large body of
dancers, all movements per
fectly executed.
Appropriate
The second piece, The Eternal
Idol, a tribute to Rodin, was an
appropriate follow up to Varia
tions De Ballet. There was a con
trast between the brightness and
gaiety of the first to the quiet,
subdued, introspective atmos
phere of the second.
This piece featured two dan
cers in a very sensuous dance
portraying Rodin's embodiment
of ideal and perfect love.
They danced around a copy of
a famous statue by Rodin while
wearing flesh colored tights, giv
ing the appearance of nudity,
which with the soft diffused
lighting helped to highlight the
sensuousness and purity of this
garden of Eden scene.
The third piece, Don Juan, was
an example of character ballet. It
was the classic story of the in
famous lover Don Juan, who
would rather live dangerously,
seducing the beautiful women of
Spain, than give up these
amorous affairs.
Seducing
It opens with Don Juan seduc
ing the lovely young wife of a

noble Castilian, who, upon dis
covering the two, fights Don
Juan for his honor. Don Juan, an
adept swordsman (probably be
cause of many previous such ex
periences), manages to kill his
opponent, and flees from the
scene, leaving a'grieving widow
behind.
This bit of action sets the stage
for the remainder of the piece.
Don Juan and his faithful servant
are chased and hounded from
place to place by the local
Federales.
In between fights with these
agents, Don Juan has time for a
few more love affairs on the side.
He does not die by the sword
but is carried directly into the
underworld by a spirit, which
has appeared from out of a tomb

during a fight with the federales
in a cemetary.
This piece displayed imagina
tive use of dance in the
swordfights. Incorporated into
this ballet, as well, was a lively
mixture of comedy and melod
rama.
The grand finale, Souvenirs,
demonstrated the versatility of
ballet. It was the highlight of the
show, which was an amazing ac
complishment given the excel
lence of the preceeding pieces.

cers in a very sensuous dance
portraying Rodin's embodiment
of ideal and perfect love.
They danced around a copy of
a famous statue by Rodin while
wearing flesh colored tights, giv
ing the appearance of nudity,
which with the soft diffused
lighting helped to highlight the
sensuousness and purity of this
garden of Eden scene.
The third piece, Don Juan, was
an example of character ballet. It
was the classic story of the in
famous lover Don Juan, who
would rather live dangerously,
seducing the beautiful women of
Spain, than give up these
amorous affairs.
Seducing
It opens with Don Juan seduc
ing the lovely young wife of a

noble Castilian, who, upon dis
covering the two, fights Don
Juan for his honor. Don Juan, an
adept swordsman (probably be
cause of many previous such ex
periences), manages to kill his
opponent, and flees from the
scene, leaving a'grieving widow
behind.
This bit of action sets the stage
for the remainder of the piece.
Don Juan and his faithful servant
are chased and hounded from
place to place by the local
Federales.
In between fights with these
agents, Don Juan has time for a
few more love affairs on the side.
He does not die by the sword
but is carried directly into the
underworld by a spirit, which
has appeared from out of a tomb

during a fight with the federales
in a cemetary.
This piece displayed imagina
tive use of dance in the
swordfights. Incorporated into
this ballet, as well, was a lively
mixture of comedy and melod
rama.
The grand finale, Souvenirs,
demonstrated the versatility of
ballet. It was the highlight of the
show, which was an amazing ac
complishment given the excel
lence of the preceeding pieces.

open the shows at Winterland. All three concerts promise to be
solid evenings of top-notch rock entertainment. Montrose is one of
the top contemporary proponents of the heavy-metal form of

Ballet is an art form demand
ing artistry, strength, precision,
timing and grace.
The San Francisco Ballet dis
played all of the following to
perfection in its second produc
tion, consisting of four pieces:
Variations De Ballet, The Eter
nal Idol, Don Juan and
Souvenirs.
Variations De Ballet dramati
cally opened the show. It was a
light and gay piece, though rela
tively classical.
It brought out various styles of
ballet, high-lighting not only the
dazzling skill of the individual
dancers but also the magnificent
choreography of George Balan
chine.
His use of the corps de ballet
with the otherwise empty stage,
was strikingly combined with
the precision of the large body of
dancers, all movements per
fectly executed.
Appropriate
The second piece, The Eternal
Idol, a tribute to Rodin, was an
appropriate follow up to Varia
tions De Ballet. There was a con
trast between the brightness and
gaiety of the first to the quiet,
subdued, introspective atmos
phere of the second.
This piece featured two dan
cers in a very sensuous dance
portraying Rodin's embodiment
of ideal and perfect love.
