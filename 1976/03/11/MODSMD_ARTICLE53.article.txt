## Quiet development Bowers: underrated 
### 
Living Together, by Edgar Bow
ers. David Godine, $3.95.
Reviewed by Dana Gioia
Living Together is a small
volume which contains all the
work of one of America's most
underrated poets, Edgar Bowers.
For the last thirty years Bowers,
who attended Stanford a quarter
of a century ago, has been writ
ing poems in a distinctly per
sonal style.
His career thus far has been
both quiet and unaggressive.
Bowers has never tried to cash in
on literary crazes, and predicta
bly his work has never caught
the attention of these critics who
follow the literary stock market
and workship instant success.
A reader could easily study
this collected volume, which
goes from the mid 1940s to the
early 19705, and be completely
unaware of all the poetic fash
ions of those decades. He has al
ways spoken in his own voice
and in his own way.
Bowers would not deny that
his poetry has been consciously
out of tune with the prevailing
choruses of fashion. In his short
and witty epigram "To the Con
temporary Muse" Bowers de
rides his age:
Honesty, little slut, must you in
sist
On hearing every dirty word I
know
And all my worst affairs? A re
impotence,
Insanity, and lying what you lust
for?
Your hands are cold, feeling me
in the dark.
Major poets
The major poets in the genera
tion after Eliot and Stevens have
usually defined themselves
against their historical epoch.
Although they have led the in
tense contemplative lives of
their predecessors, they have
found it morally and artistically
necessary to interact with their
political environments. The
works of a Robert Lowell of W.H.
Auden often seem like intellec
tual barometers of their age.
Matched against major figures
like Lowell and Auden the indi
vidual quality of Bowers'
achievement becomes apparent.
He is a minor poet but a consis
tently honest one. Bowers is a
poet not entirely happy with his
time but comfortable enough in
it to turn his attention to time in
general.
Since Bowers does not try to
find his major theme in the pro
cess of discovering his own age,
he must discuss it as an abstrac
tion. This preference probably
accounts for the quiet quality in
Bowers' poetry. Time as an
abstraction never changes, only
our perception of it as we grow
older. And this change is a slow
and undramatic process.
Living Together contains
many fine poems. It is hard to
think of many American poems
from the 1940s or 1950s that are
any better than Bowers' "The

Stoic" or "Two Poems on the
Catholic Bavarians." Indeed
there are few poems in Living
Together which do not have
considerable merit.
Hidden dangers
Bowers' consistent excellence
has its hidden dangers. Twenty
years after its first publication
The Form of Loss is still an
amazingly accomplished debut
for a young poet. But Bowers has
never matured into the major
poet this volume promised.
His work since then has been
equally excellent, but it has
neither significantly developed
or changed. His poetry in the
1970s is slightly less dogmatic
and more personal, but other
wise it is nearly identical to his
earlier work. Its only major
change is one of ommission. Un
fortunately Bowers' work has
grown smaller and less ambi
tious as of late.
What is Bowers' distinctive
poetic voice? The opening lines
from his first poem on the
Catholic Bavarians will give an
eloquent example:
The fierce and brooding
holocause of faith
This people conquered, which
do edict could,
And wave its spirit stiff and rich
like cloth
That many years ago was soaked
with blood.
Bowers writes simply because
he feels the seriousness of his
message. His themes are almost
always dark and introspective.
His steady handling of the for
mal rhythmic pattern does not
distract the reader from his mes
sage. Nor do the subtle rhymes.
Like this passage his poetry is
full of abstractions whicy bring
out the general importance of
each individual event.
A pleasure
It is a true pleasure to read an
accomplishment contemporary
poet who writes as if William
Carlos Williams never existed.
Bowers is not afraid to make
ideas the focus of his poetry, and
this conscious choice gives
Bowers an intellectual depth
and complexity missing in much
recent American poetry.
Although the poems present
no superficial difficulties, they
are far from simple. Bowers is a
very intelligent and intellectual
poet, and his imagination runs
towads complex treatment of
grand themes. Occasionally his
poems break under the weight of
ideas too vast for their modest
means, but when he succeeds
the poems display a depth that
rewards repeated readings.
The stylistic complexity of too
many contemporary poets hides
the embarassingly simplistic in
tellect of their work. They copy
William CarlosWilliams' dictum
"no ideas but in things" but
without his charm or ease. Every
day poets produce new and tor
turous testaments to their own
intellectual incapacities with
stultifying effects to their tiny

audiences.
Unfortunately, while Bowers
is not afraid to work with ideas,
he is hesitant to experiment with
language. He can handle words
successfully in a formal and
slightly artificial way, but he
still writes in the same voice he
did 25 years ago and often with
out either the earlier energy or
conviction.
His poems are often immobile
as if they had been carved care
fully out of stone by some tre
mendous act of will. They are
inevitably perfect but lack the
natural energy of more daring
poetry.

equally excellent, but it has
neither significantly developed

earlier work. Its only major
change is one of ommission. Un
fortunately Bowers' work has
grown smaller and less ambi
tious as of late.
What is Bowers' distinctive
poetic voice? The opening lines
from his first poem on the
Catholic Bavarians will give an
eloquent example:
The fierce and brooding
holocause of faith
This people conquered, which
do edict could,
And wave its spirit stiff and rich
like cloth
That many years ago was soaked
with blood.
Bowers writes simply because
he feels the seriousness of his
message. His themes are almost
always dark and introspective.
His steady handling of the for
mal rhythmic pattern does not
distract the reader from his mes
sage. Nor do the subtle rhymes.
Like this passage his poetry is
full of abstractions whicy bring
out the general importance of
each individual event.
A pleasure
It is a true pleasure to read an
accomplishment contemporary
poet who writes as if William
Carlos Williams never existed.
Bowers is not afraid to make
ideas the focus of his poetry, and
this conscious choice gives
Bowers an intellectual depth
and complexity missing in much
recent American poetry.
Although the poems present
no superficial difficulties, they
are far from simple. Bowers is a
very intelligent and intellectual
poet, and his imagination runs
towads complex treatment of
grand themes. Occasionally his
poems break under the weight of
ideas too vast for their modest
means, but when he succeeds
the poems display a depth that
rewards repeated readings.
The stylistic complexity of too
many contemporary poets hides
the embarassingly simplistic in
tellect of their work. They copy
William CarlosWilliams' dictum
"no ideas but in things" but
without his charm or ease. Every
day poets produce new and tor
turous testaments to their own
intellectual incapacities with
stultifying effects to their tiny

audiences.
Unfortunately, while Bowers
is not afraid to work with ideas,
he is hesitant to experiment with
language. He can handle words
successfully in a formal and
slightly artificial way, but he
still writes in the same voice he
did 25 years ago and often with
out either the earlier energy or
conviction.
His poems are often immobile
as if they had been carved care
fully out of stone by some tre
mendous act of will. They are
inevitably perfect but lack the
natural energy of more daring
poetry.

Living Together, by Edgar Bow
ers. David Godine, $3.95.
Reviewed by Dana Gioia
Living Together is a small
volume which contains all the
work of one of America's most
underrated poets, Edgar Bowers.
For the last thirty years Bowers,
who attended Stanford a quarter
of a century ago, has been writ
ing poems in a distinctly per
sonal style.
His career thus far has been
both quiet and unaggressive.
Bowers has never tried to cash in
on literary crazes, and predicta
bly his work has never caught
the attention of these critics who
follow the literary stock market
and workship instant success.
A reader could easily study
this collected volume, which
goes from the mid 1940s to the
early 19705, and be completely
unaware of all the poetic fash
ions of those decades. He has al
ways spoken in his own voice
and in his own way.
Bowers would not deny that
his poetry has been consciously
out of tune with the prevailing
choruses of fashion. In his short
and witty epigram "To the Con
temporary Muse" Bowers de
rides his age:
Honesty, little slut, must you in
sist
On hearing every dirty word I
know
And all my worst affairs? A re
impotence,
Insanity, and lying what you lust
for?
Your hands are cold, feeling me
in the dark.
Major poets
The major poets in the genera
tion after Eliot and Stevens have
usually defined themselves
against their historical epoch.
Although they have led the in
tense contemplative lives of
their predecessors, they have
found it morally and artistically
necessary to interact with their
political environments. The
works of a Robert Lowell of W.H.
Auden often seem like intellec
tual barometers of their age.
Matched against major figures
like Lowell and Auden the indi
vidual quality of Bowers'
achievement becomes apparent.
He is a minor poet but a consis
tently honest one. Bowers is a
poet not entirely happy with his
time but comfortable enough in
it to turn his attention to time in
general.
Since Bowers does not try to
find his major theme in the pro
cess of discovering his own age,
he must discuss it as an abstrac
tion. This preference probably
accounts for the quiet quality in
Bowers' poetry. Time as an
abstraction never changes, only
our perception of it as we grow
older. And this change is a slow
and undramatic process.
Living Together contains
many fine poems. It is hard to
think of many American poems
from the 1940s or 1950s that are
any better than Bowers' "The

Stoic" or "Two Poems on the
Catholic Bavarians." Indeed
there are few poems in Living
Together which do not have
considerable merit.
Hidden dangers
Bowers' consistent excellence
has its hidden dangers. Twenty
years after its first publication
The Form of Loss is still an
amazingly accomplished debut
for a young poet. But Bowers has
never matured into the major
poet this volume promised.
His work since then has been
equally excellent, but it has
neither significantly developed
or changed. His poetry in the
1970s is slightly less dogmatic
and more personal, but other
wise it is nearly identical to his

on literary crazes, and predicta
bly his work has never caught
the attention of these critics who
follow the literary stock market
and workship instant success.
A reader could easily study
this collected volume, which
goes from the mid 1940s to the
early 19705, and be completely
unaware of all the poetic fash
ions of those decades. He has al
ways spoken in his own voice
and in his own way.
Bowers would not deny that
his poetry has been consciously
out of tune with the prevailing
choruses of fashion. In his short
and witty epigram "To the Con
temporary Muse" Bowers de
rides his age:
Honesty, little slut, must you in
sist
On hearing every dirty word I
know
And all my worst affairs? A re
impotence,
Insanity, and lying what you lust
for?
Your hands are cold, feeling me
in the dark.
Major poets
The major poets in the genera
tion after Eliot and Stevens have
usually defined themselves
against their historical epoch.
Although they have led the in
tense contemplative lives of
their predecessors, they have
found it morally and artistically
necessary to interact with their
political environments. The
works of a Robert Lowell of W.H.
Auden often seem like intellec
tual barometers of their age.
Matched against major figures
like Lowell and Auden the indi
vidual quality of Bowers'
achievement becomes apparent.
He is a minor poet but a consis
tently honest one. Bowers is a
poet not entirely happy with his
time but comfortable enough in
it to turn his attention to time in
general.
Since Bowers does not try to
find his major theme in the pro
cess of discovering his own age,
he must discuss it as an abstrac
tion. This preference probably
accounts for the quiet quality in
Bowers' poetry. Time as an
abstraction never changes, only
our perception of it as we grow
older. And this change is a slow
and undramatic process.
Living Together contains
many fine poems. It is hard to
think of many American poems
from the 1940s or 1950s that are
any better than Bowers' "The

Stoic" or "Two Poems on the
Catholic Bavarians." Indeed
there are few poems in Living
Together which do not have
considerable merit.
Hidden dangers
Bowers' consistent excellence
has its hidden dangers. Twenty
years after its first publication
The Form of Loss is still an
amazingly accomplished debut
for a young poet. But Bowers has
never matured into the major
poet this volume promised.
His work since then has been
equally excellent, but it has
neither significantly developed
or changed. His poetry in the
1970s is slightly less dogmatic
and more personal, but other
wise it is nearly identical to his
earlier work. Its only major
change is one of ommission. Un
fortunately Bowers' work has
grown smaller and less ambi
tious as of late.
What is Bowers' distinctive
poetic voice? The opening lines
from his first poem on the
Catholic Bavarians will give an
eloquent example:
The fierce and brooding
holocause of faith
This people conquered, which
do edict could,
And wave its spirit stiff and rich
like cloth
That many years ago was soaked
with blood.
Bowers writes simply because
he feels the seriousness of his
message. His themes are almost
always dark and introspective.
His steady handling of the for
mal rhythmic pattern does not
distract the reader from his mes
sage. Nor do the subtle rhymes.
Like this passage his poetry is
full of abstractions whicy bring
out the general importance of
each individual event.
A pleasure
It is a true pleasure to read an
accomplishment contemporary
poet who writes as if William
Carlos Williams never existed.
Bowers is not afraid to make
ideas the focus of his poetry, and
this conscious choice gives
Bowers an intellectual depth
and complexity missing in much
recent American poetry.
Although the poems present
no superficial difficulties, they
are far from simple. Bowers is a
very intelligent and intellectual
poet, and his imagination runs
towads complex treatment of
grand themes. Occasionally his
poems break under the weight of
ideas too vast for their modest
means, but when he succeeds
the poems display a depth that
rewards repeated readings.
The stylistic complexity of too
many contemporary poets hides
the embarassingly simplistic in
tellect of their work. They copy
William CarlosWilliams' dictum
"no ideas but in things" but
without his charm or ease. Every
day poets produce new and tor
turous testaments to their own
intellectual incapacities with
stultifying effects to their tiny

audiences.
Unfortunately, while Bowers
is not afraid to work with ideas,
he is hesitant to experiment with
language. He can handle words
successfully in a formal and
slightly artificial way, but he
still writes in the same voice he
did 25 years ago and often with
out either the earlier energy or
conviction.
His poems are often immobile
as if they had been carved care
fully out of stone by some tre
mendous act of will. They are
inevitably perfect but lack the
natural energy of more daring
poetry.
