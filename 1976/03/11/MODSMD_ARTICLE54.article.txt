Steve Weed, Patty Hearst's
fiance when she was kidnaped
by the Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA), was the least color
ful figure of all those associated
with the drama. As the saga un
folded, Patty and the SLA were
joined by Randolph and
Catherine Hearst, and Charles
Bates of the FBI on the front
pages of nearly every news
paper.
Weed, however, remained the
pathetic beaten and deserted
boyfriend. The Hearsts first
him out of their Hills
borough home in full view of
the national media, and then
Patty (Tania) called him a
"clown" on an SLA tape.
To the media covering the
case, Weed was indeed a clown.
He constantly embarasssed him
self when confronted by repor
ters, even to the point of yelling
at reporter Marilyn Baker during
a televised interview.
More recently, Patty's defense
team declared that Weed was an
idiot. New Times magazine ran
an article describing him as a
bumbling idiot, and a law suit
against Weed resulted from an

ill-fated connection with the
New Times reporter.
In short, the Menlo Park
raised Princeton graduate was
taken out of his private life by the
most unusual of circumstances
and thrust into the public light
where he was made out to be a
fool.
Weed hadn't responded to his
critics until the publication of
this book, and still leaves out any
direct answers to anyone's criti
cisms.
But the book is better because
he didn't write it to protect his
public image. Complaints of
exploitation of his private life
with and knowledge of Patty are
barely justified when his history
of the last two years is consi
dered. There are a few topics that
may have been unnecessary to
add, but Weed lucidly describes
the events surrounding the kid
naping and the abortive attempts
to rescue Patty without pleading
his own case.
Particularly interesting is
Weed's account of the People In
Need (PIN) food program set up
by the Hearsts in a futile attempt
to comply with the SLA's initial
ransom ctemands.
He explains the inner work
ings of the program, including

the Black Muslim's $90,000
swindle and Sara Jane Moore's
expert handling of the program
after it's initial failure.
Weed interweaves accounts of
his private life with Patty among
details of the rescue attempts.
The mix is well done, and pro
vides necessary background for
understanding the public im
ages that both Patty and Weed
have earned.
As of now, Weed writes, his
opinion of Patty is undecided.

He isn't sure whether or not he
still loves her, but seems certain
that they will never become
close again.
Lost in the excitement of the
whole event, Weed's frustration
and hopelessness over losing
Patty was probably as traumatic
as that of the Hearst family. And
his attempts to find her and talk
to her led into the hands of repor
ters and radicals whose only in
terests were in using him for a
story or for a cause.
