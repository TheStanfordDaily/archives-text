Can a local feminist magazine
with a limited circulation serve
any purpose beyond that now
served by a national magazine
like Ms.? The staff of S/HE, a new
student-initiated publication
sponsored by the Center for Re
search on Women (CROW),
would undoubtedly maintain
that it can and must.
Judging from its first issue, it
would appear that S/HE intends
to devote itself to a continuing
critical assessment of both
feminism and the condition of
women — the two being neither
identical nor necessarily paral
lel. As the current issue of S/HE
makes clear, and as its title re
minds the reader, the problem of
how both women and men can
best be served by the feminist
movement is S/HE's guiding
concern.
The phenomenon of rapidly
changing sex roles is the ex
tremely important and unques
tionably exciting substance of
S/HE's inquiries. S/HE ap
proaches its subject in a mature
and unabashedly intelligent
manner. Its staff is firmly com
mitted to aiding the cause of
women's rights — but only in a
way that will lead to freer and
more productive roles for both
sexes.
In this month's issue a female

reviewer takes a careful look at
Susan Brownmiller's Against
Our Will: Men, Women and
Rape. The reviewer finds
Brownmiller's book excessively
emotional and consequently, ir
responsible.
Against Our Will does not
carry the punch that it should
and could have. The reviewer
welcomes Brownmiller's book
for the impetus it provides to
ward "long-awaited attention
and reform," but she chastises it
for the lack of structure or prin
ciples at the bottom of its haran
guing.
The review epitomizes the
tone of S/HE. This month there
are also interviews with both
local public figures and
Stanford-affiliated individuals.
The specifically local nature of
S/HE's journalism allows it to in
form its readers of the changing
lots of women and feminism in
the thorough and concrete way
necessary to make sense out of
nation-wide issues such as the
prevention and punishment of
rape (not to mention the ques
tion of its meaning within
American society), the proposed
Equal Rights Amendment, etc.
As long as it is so enthusiastic
and judicious in the way it seeks
out and evaluates these prob
lems, S/HE will make a signific
ant contribution to the future of
women's rights in the San Fran

WPA 1, $.25.
Reviewed by Dana Gioia
WPA 1 is one of the best poetry magazines to
appear for a long time in the Bay Area. It is a small
pamphlet which contains one poem each by 13
local poets.
The quality of the contents is surprisingly high
and the cover price astoundingly low. This un
precedented combination of features makes WPA
1 nearly unique among small magazines.
Palo Alto has been especially enlightened to
support WPA. City governments usually support
every type of artistic endeavor except the literary.
Yet in a political sense literature is certainly the
most important force among the arts.
And literature's cultivation and protection of
language is centrally important for the health of
any democratic form of government.
Doug McDavid's poem, which opens the issue,
is an excellent example of double meaning. While
the poet begins talking directly about one thing —
splitting logs—thesingle-mindednessof his con
centration makes the reader wonder if he isn't
talking about much more.
Most remarkable
Frank Cady's "How to Sleep Well" is the most
remarkable poem in the issue. Although the title
sounds uncomfortably reminiscent of the Robert
Benchley farce, the poem itself is surprisingly
true to its title.
In its elusive and modest way it is a didactic
poem. Cady has written a simple poem about ac
cepting life. He speaks in a self-consciously direct
manner:
Wake slowly Make
sure What you know
Walls Windows Doors
Rhythm of your breath

The long weight of your body
growing out of your dreams.
The idiosyncratic grammar which are so com
mon in third-rate contemporary poetry really
work in this poem. The unexpected capitaliza
tion, the strange spacing and the lack of punctua
tion all add to the verbal effect of this poem.
Cady's simple set of instructions add up to a
subtly marvelous poem.
VVPA 1 also contains poems by many well
known local poets. A 1 Young, whose first novel
Snakes brought him national attention has a
strong poem in the issue entitled "Rediscovered
Diary Entry."
Lee Perron has contributed a comic piece entic
ingly called "Cannabilism in Mid-America."
There are also fine poems by Leonard Breger and
Joan Yeager.
Restrictions
The poets writing in WPA, like so many con
temporary poets suffer from a certain stylistic re
striction. They seem to feel comfortable expres
sing themselves only in two ways, either direct
statement or impersonal imagery. They either
write "I am mad" or "the unkept fire flares out in
the night." Both of these methods are certainly
valid, but they have forgotten the whole range of
possibilities between.
There is a certain looseness to most of the
poems. One often feels that another poet could
add or subtract lines from each of the poems with
out significantly damaging them.
This looseness does not mean that they are bad
poems by any means. Rather it implies that they
lack that deeper level of organization that is essen
tial to poetry that intends to be more than simply
good. The poems more often show talent and sen
sibility than a rigorous poetic imagination in
strict control.

Benchley farce, the poem itself is surprisingly
true to its title.
In its elusive and modest way it is a didactic
poem. Cady has written a simple poem about ac
cepting life. He speaks in a self-consciously direct
manner:
Wake slowly Make
sure What you know
Walls Windows Doors
Rhythm of your breath

The long weight of your body
growing out of your dreams.
The idiosyncratic grammar which are so com
mon in third-rate contemporary poetry really
work in this poem. The unexpected capitaliza
tion, the strange spacing and the lack of punctua
tion all add to the verbal effect of this poem.
Cady's simple set of instructions add up to a
subtly marvelous poem.
VVPA 1 also contains poems by many well
known local poets. A 1 Young, whose first novel
Snakes brought him national attention has a
strong poem in the issue entitled "Rediscovered
Diary Entry."
Lee Perron has contributed a comic piece entic
ingly called "Cannabilism in Mid-America."
There are also fine poems by Leonard Breger and
Joan Yeager.
Restrictions
The poets writing in WPA, like so many con
temporary poets suffer from a certain stylistic re
striction. They seem to feel comfortable expres
sing themselves only in two ways, either direct
statement or impersonal imagery. They either
write "I am mad" or "the unkept fire flares out in
the night." Both of these methods are certainly
valid, but they have forgotten the whole range of
possibilities between.
There is a certain looseness to most of the
poems. One often feels that another poet could
add or subtract lines from each of the poems with
out significantly damaging them.
This looseness does not mean that they are bad
poems by any means. Rather it implies that they
lack that deeper level of organization that is essen
tial to poetry that intends to be more than simply
good. The poems more often show talent and sen
sibility than a rigorous poetic imagination in
strict control.

WPA 1 is one of the best poetry magazines to

Palo Alto has been especially enlightened to

any democratic form of government.
Doug McDavid's poem, which opens the issue,

are also interviews with both
local public figures and
Stanford-affiliated individuals.
The specifically local nature of
S/HE's journalism allows it to in

the thorough and concrete way

nation-wide issues such as the
prevention and punishment of
rape (not to mention the ques

American society), the proposed

WPA 1 is one of the best poetry magazines to
appear for a long time in the Bay Area. It is a small
pamphlet which contains one poem each by 13
local poets.
The quality of the contents is surprisingly high
and the cover price astoundingly low. This un
precedented combination of features makes WPA
1 nearly unique among small magazines.
Palo Alto has been especially enlightened to
support WPA. City governments usually support
every type of artistic endeavor except the literary.
Yet in a political sense literature is certainly the
most important force among the arts.
And literature's cultivation and protection of
language is centrally important for the health of
any democratic form of government.
Doug McDavid's poem, which opens the issue,
is an excellent example of double meaning. While
the poet begins talking directly about one thing —
splitting logs—thesingle-mindednessof his con
centration makes the reader wonder if he isn't
talking about much more.
Most remarkable
Frank Cady's "How to Sleep Well" is the most
remarkable poem in the issue. Although the title
sounds uncomfortably reminiscent of the Robert
Benchley farce, the poem itself is surprisingly
true to its title.
In its elusive and modest way it is a didactic
poem. Cady has written a simple poem about ac
cepting life. He speaks in a self-consciously direct
manner:
Wake slowly Make
sure What you know
Walls Windows Doors
Rhythm of your breath

The long weight of your body
growing out of your dreams.
The idiosyncratic grammar which are so com
mon in third-rate contemporary poetry really
work in this poem. The unexpected capitaliza
tion, the strange spacing and the lack of punctua
tion all add to the verbal effect of this poem.
Cady's simple set of instructions add up to a
subtly marvelous poem.
VVPA 1 also contains poems by many well
known local poets. A 1 Young, whose first novel
Snakes brought him national attention has a
strong poem in the issue entitled "Rediscovered
Diary Entry."
Lee Perron has contributed a comic piece entic
ingly called "Cannabilism in Mid-America."
There are also fine poems by Leonard Breger and
Joan Yeager.
Restrictions
The poets writing in WPA, like so many con
temporary poets suffer from a certain stylistic re
striction. They seem to feel comfortable expres
sing themselves only in two ways, either direct
statement or impersonal imagery. They either
write "I am mad" or "the unkept fire flares out in
the night." Both of these methods are certainly
valid, but they have forgotten the whole range of
possibilities between.
There is a certain looseness to most of the
poems. One often feels that another poet could
add or subtract lines from each of the poems with
out significantly damaging them.
This looseness does not mean that they are bad
poems by any means. Rather it implies that they
lack that deeper level of organization that is essen
tial to poetry that intends to be more than simply
good. The poems more often show talent and sen
sibility than a rigorous poetic imagination in
strict control.
