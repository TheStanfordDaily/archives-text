## Schweitzer breaks rebounding record Cards beat Cal in basketball satire 
### Paul Bauman 
BERKELEY—After looking at
California's decrepit Harmon
Gymnasium, you'd think Cal
couldn't give a damn about its
basketball program.
And after looking at the Bears'
performance Friday night
against Stanford, you'd probably
come to the same conclusion.
The Cards, for that matter,
didn't look all that keyed either.
They did manage to play decent
basketball for about 20 out of 40
minutes, which exceeded Cal's
total by about 15 minutes. Only
in isolated instances, did the
Bears interrupt their lackluster
play with Pacific Eight quality
basketball.
The result was Stanford 73,
Cal 65. The win gave the Cards a
3-11 final Pac-8 record and a
9-18 mark overall in coach Dick
Dißiaso's first vear at Stanford.
Cal finished sixth in the Pac-8,
one game above seventh-place
Stanford, at 4-10 in the confer
ence and 12-14 overall.
Bad start
The first few minutes of the
game gave the 4915 fans some
idea of the basketball "wizar
dry" they would witness the rest
of the night. It had to be seen to
be believed.

In the first four and one-half
minutes, pseudo-stud Rickie
Hawthorne,forward Card Bird of
Cal and Stanford's Ed
Schweitzer were all called for
traveling, Mike Bratz and Tim
Patterson each chipped in tur

novers on bad passes, Haw
thorne missed the entire urn on a
breakaway layup and Patterson
hit the side of the backbofrd on a
10-foot baseline jumper.
Players on both teams}Jid ev
erything but score. Thf game
was scoreless for the 2:04
before Cal's Connie While com
pleted a three-point plar. Stan
ford didn't score until jiy Car
ter hit a fade shot from (nx feet
out with 3:31 gone.
Little scoring
The score remained a
baseball-like 3-2 until tve and
one-half minutes had elipsed in
the half, and neither tgim was
stalling. Stanford scored only
three baskets total in (he first
8:40.
Dißiaso was asked ifter the
game if he had ever s<en any
thing like it.
"Yes," he said. "I wjis at In
diana once and we onl// scored
13 points in the first halj . . . and
we were hot."
By halftime, Cal had .accumu
lated 11 turnovers and Stanford
10. The Bears finished the game
with 18 turnovers, nol exactly
indicative of slick ballhandling,
while the Cards tottled 16.
Schweitzer led all plajers with
four traveling violations.
Poor shooting
Cal shot a feeble 35 percent
from the field; Stanford shot
only 38 percent. Only one player
on either team shot ov<r 50 per
cent from the floor — Cal's Rock
Lee, who hit three of four shots
in 14 minutes of playing time.

Hawthorne made up for his
career-high 37 points against
USC last week with a truly mis
erable game against Stanford.
The Cal senior hit one of seven
shots from the field (and that was
a layup), was called for traveling
twice and palming the ball once.
And all in the first half yet.
Hawthorne was four of 15 from
the field for the game and added
three traveling calls.
Bratz wasn't far behind. The
Stanford guard missed all of his
five first-half shots from the
field, and finished just four of 14.
Bird grounded
Bird, who scored 26 points in
Cal's 89-85 double-overtime win
over Stanford at Maples Pavilion
last month, hit only three of his
15 shots, but did grab nine re
bounds.
The quality of play was no bet
ter than the game's setting. Har
mon Gym is not only a blight
on the Cal campus, but probably
on the state of California too. It's
really that bad.
The place is actually an over
sized high school gym and gives
a new dimension to the word
"dingy." Cal must have hired
Count Dracula as the interior de
corator. The dominant color is
sort of a battleship gray and the
criss-cross steel rafters resemble
the siding of the Bay Bridge.
Harmon has all the atmosphere
of a wholesale hardware store.
__ Bright spots
Several positive achievements
did shine through all the nega
tive aspects of the game.

Schweitzer set a record for op
posing players in Harmon by
collecting a career-high 21 re
bounds. Schweitzer said a goal
of his all season has been to top
20 rebounds in one game, and
the senior forward did it in his
final game for Stanford.
Schweitzer's performance
also assured him the Pac-8 re
bounding championship. Di-
Biaso guessed that the 21 re
bounds were the highlight of the
Card captain's Stanford career.
Two other high points in
volved one Stanford player
whose career ended Friday and
another whose career is really
just beginning.

Simons big factor
The Cards would not have
won the game without Mike Si
mons, one of the few players
who scored consistently. The
senior guard played 29 minutes
and scored 14 points on seven of
14 from the field, mostly from far
outside.
Finally, Stanford freshman
Wolfe Perry played the entire

game and led the Cards with 15
points. Ferry averaged 15.0
points in Stanford's last three
games, against USC, UCLA and
Cal. andappears ready to make a
fantastic contribution to next
year's team.
Card forward Ceorge Schader,
still suffering from a stress frac
ture and a strained achilles ten
don, watched the game in street
clothes from the bench. Trainer
Dave Blanchard decided that
Schader's leg had taken all the
punishment it could over the last
month, and held him out of the
game.
Seniors speak
After the game Schweitzer
talked about the future of Stan
ford basketball, while Simons
looked back on his Stanford
career.
"Dißiaso is a helluva coach,"
Schweitzer said. "If he gets the
kids he's going after, they're
going to have some great teams
in the future."
"I'm just glad 1 finally got a
chance to play," said Simons,
who stuck it out for four years to
get some playing time. "I sup
pose I could sit back and have a
lot of regrets about being on the
bench. But just to get this chance
to play meant a lot to me. I have
to be satisfied."
Simons added: "I think I did
OK."
The same could probably be
said of the 1975-76 Cards, de
spite their 3-11 Pac-8 record.
Cardinal Notes: Schweitzer's
21 rebounds gave him 704 for his
career, third best in Stanford his
tory. . . Schweitzer is Stanford's
all-time leader in career field
goal percentage (.528). . . Tim
Patterson finished his career as
the No. 4 all-time percentage
shooter in Stanford history with
a .497 mark.

BERKELEY—After looking at
California's decrepit Harmon
Gymnasium, you'd think Cal
couldn't give a damn about its
basketball program.
And after looking at the Bears'
performance Friday night
against Stanford, you'd probably
come to the same conclusion.
The Cards, for that matter,
didn't look all that keyed either.
They did manage to play decent
basketball for about 20 out of 40
minutes, which exceeded Cal's
total by about 15 minutes. Only
in isolated instances, did the
Bears interrupt their lackluster
play with Pacific Eight quality
basketball.
The result was Stanford 73,
Cal 65. The win gave the Cards a
3-11 final Pac-8 record and a
9-18 mark overall in coach Dick
Dißiaso's first vear at Stanford.
Cal finished sixth in the Pac-8,
one game above seventh-place
Stanford, at 4-10 in the confer
ence and 12-14 overall.
Bad start
The first few minutes of the
game gave the 4915 fans some
idea of the basketball "wizar
dry" they would witness the rest
of the night. It had to be seen to
be believed.

In the first four and one-half
minutes, pseudo-stud Rickie
Hawthorne,forward Card Bird of
Cal and Stanford's Ed
Schweitzer were all called for
traveling, Mike Bratz and Tim
Patterson each chipped in tur

novers on bad passes, Haw
thorne missed the entire urn on a
breakaway layup and Patterson
hit the side of the backbofrd on a
10-foot baseline jumper.
Players on both teams}Jid ev
erything but score. Thf game
was scoreless for the 2:04
before Cal's Connie While com
pleted a three-point plar. Stan
ford didn't score until jiy Car
ter hit a fade shot from (nx feet
out with 3:31 gone.
Little scoring
The score remained a
baseball-like 3-2 until tve and
one-half minutes had elipsed in
the half, and neither tgim was
stalling. Stanford scored only
three baskets total in (he first
8:40.
Dißiaso was asked ifter the
game if he had ever s<en any
thing like it.
"Yes," he said. "I wjis at In
diana once and we onl// scored
13 points in the first halj . . . and
we were hot."
By halftime, Cal had .accumu
lated 11 turnovers and Stanford
10. The Bears finished the game
with 18 turnovers, nol exactly
indicative of slick ballhandling,
while the Cards tottled 16.
Schweitzer led all plajers with
four traveling violations.
Poor shooting
Cal shot a feeble 35 percent
from the field; Stanford shot
only 38 percent. Only one player
on either team shot ov<r 50 per
cent from the floor — Cal's Rock
Lee, who hit three of four shots
in 14 minutes of playing time.

Hawthorne made up for his
career-high 37 points against
USC last week with a truly mis
erable game against Stanford.
The Cal senior hit one of seven
shots from the field (and that was
a layup), was called for traveling
twice and palming the ball once.
And all in the first half yet.
Hawthorne was four of 15 from
the field for the game and added
three traveling calls.
Bratz wasn't far behind. The
Stanford guard missed all of his
five first-half shots from the
field, and finished just four of 14.
Bird grounded
Bird, who scored 26 points in
Cal's 89-85 double-overtime win
over Stanford at Maples Pavilion
last month, hit only three of his
15 shots, but did grab nine re
bounds.
The quality of play was no bet
ter than the game's setting. Har
mon Gym is not only a blight
on the Cal campus, but probably
on the state of California too. It's
really that bad.
The place is actually an over
sized high school gym and gives
a new dimension to the word
"dingy." Cal must have hired
Count Dracula as the interior de
corator. The dominant color is
sort of a battleship gray and the
criss-cross steel rafters resemble
the siding of the Bay Bridge.
Harmon has all the atmosphere
of a wholesale hardware store.
__ Bright spots
Several positive achievements
did shine through all the nega
tive aspects of the game.

Schweitzer set a record for op
posing players in Harmon by
collecting a career-high 21 re
bounds. Schweitzer said a goal
of his all season has been to top
20 rebounds in one game, and
the senior forward did it in his
final game for Stanford.
Schweitzer's performance
also assured him the Pac-8 re
bounding championship. Di-
Biaso guessed that the 21 re
bounds were the highlight of the
Card captain's Stanford career.
Two other high points in
volved one Stanford player
whose career ended Friday and
another whose career is really
just beginning.

Simons big factor
The Cards would not have
won the game without Mike Si
mons, one of the few players
who scored consistently. The
senior guard played 29 minutes
and scored 14 points on seven of
14 from the field, mostly from far
outside.
Finally, Stanford freshman
Wolfe Perry played the entire

game and led the Cards with 15
points. Ferry averaged 15.0
points in Stanford's last three
games, against USC, UCLA and
Cal. andappears ready to make a
fantastic contribution to next
year's team.
Card forward Ceorge Schader,
still suffering from a stress frac
ture and a strained achilles ten
don, watched the game in street
clothes from the bench. Trainer
Dave Blanchard decided that
Schader's leg had taken all the
punishment it could over the last
month, and held him out of the
game.
Seniors speak
After the game Schweitzer
talked about the future of Stan
ford basketball, while Simons
looked back on his Stanford
career.
"Dißiaso is a helluva coach,"
Schweitzer said. "If he gets the
kids he's going after, they're
going to have some great teams
in the future."
"I'm just glad 1 finally got a
chance to play," said Simons,
who stuck it out for four years to
get some playing time. "I sup
pose I could sit back and have a
lot of regrets about being on the
bench. But just to get this chance
to play meant a lot to me. I have
to be satisfied."
Simons added: "I think I did
OK."
The same could probably be
said of the 1975-76 Cards, de
spite their 3-11 Pac-8 record.
Cardinal Notes: Schweitzer's
21 rebounds gave him 704 for his
career, third best in Stanford his
tory. . . Schweitzer is Stanford's
all-time leader in career field
goal percentage (.528). . . Tim
Patterson finished his career as
the No. 4 all-time percentage
shooter in Stanford history with
a .497 mark.

BERKELEY—After looking at
California's decrepit Harmon
Gymnasium, you'd think Cal
couldn't give a damn about its
basketball program.
And after looking at the Bears'
performance Friday night
against Stanford, you'd probably
come to the same conclusion.
The Cards, for that matter,
didn't look all that keyed either.
They did manage to play decent
basketball for about 20 out of 40
minutes, which exceeded Cal's
total by about 15 minutes. Only
in isolated instances, did the
Bears interrupt their lackluster
play with Pacific Eight quality
basketball.
The result was Stanford 73,
Cal 65. The win gave the Cards a
3-11 final Pac-8 record and a
9-18 mark overall in coach Dick
Dißiaso's first vear at Stanford.
Cal finished sixth in the Pac-8,
one game above seventh-place
Stanford, at 4-10 in the confer
ence and 12-14 overall.
Bad start
The first few minutes of the
game gave the 4915 fans some
idea of the basketball "wizar
dry" they would witness the rest
of the night. It had to be seen to
be believed.

In the first four and one-half
minutes, pseudo-stud Rickie
Hawthorne,forward Card Bird of
Cal and Stanford's Ed
Schweitzer were all called for
traveling, Mike Bratz and Tim
Patterson each chipped in tur

novers on bad passes, Haw
thorne missed the entire urn on a
breakaway layup and Patterson
hit the side of the backbofrd on a
10-foot baseline jumper.
Players on both teams}Jid ev
erything but score. Thf game
was scoreless for the 2:04
before Cal's Connie While com
pleted a three-point plar. Stan
ford didn't score until jiy Car
ter hit a fade shot from (nx feet
out with 3:31 gone.
Little scoring
The score remained a
baseball-like 3-2 until tve and
one-half minutes had elipsed in
the half, and neither tgim was
stalling. Stanford scored only
three baskets total in (he first
8:40.
Dißiaso was asked ifter the
game if he had ever s<en any
thing like it.
"Yes," he said. "I wjis at In
diana once and we onl// scored
13 points in the first halj . . . and
we were hot."
By halftime, Cal had .accumu
lated 11 turnovers and Stanford
10. The Bears finished the game
with 18 turnovers, nol exactly
indicative of slick ballhandling,
while the Cards tottled 16.
Schweitzer led all plajers with
four traveling violations.
Poor shooting
Cal shot a feeble 35 percent
from the field; Stanford shot
only 38 percent. Only one player
on either team shot ov<r 50 per
cent from the floor — Cal's Rock
Lee, who hit three of four shots
in 14 minutes of playing time.

Hawthorne made up for his
career-high 37 points against
USC last week with a truly mis
erable game against Stanford.
The Cal senior hit one of seven
shots from the field (and that was
a layup), was called for traveling
twice and palming the ball once.
And all in the first half yet.
Hawthorne was four of 15 from
the field for the game and added
three traveling calls.
Bratz wasn't far behind. The
Stanford guard missed all of his
five first-half shots from the
field, and finished just four of 14.
Bird grounded
Bird, who scored 26 points in
Cal's 89-85 double-overtime win
over Stanford at Maples Pavilion
last month, hit only three of his
15 shots, but did grab nine re
bounds.
The quality of play was no bet
ter than the game's setting. Har
mon Gym is not only a blight
on the Cal campus, but probably
on the state of California too. It's
really that bad.
The place is actually an over
sized high school gym and gives
a new dimension to the word
"dingy." Cal must have hired
Count Dracula as the interior de
corator. The dominant color is
sort of a battleship gray and the
criss-cross steel rafters resemble
the siding of the Bay Bridge.
Harmon has all the atmosphere
of a wholesale hardware store.
__ Bright spots
Several positive achievements
did shine through all the nega
tive aspects of the game.

Schweitzer set a record for op
posing players in Harmon by
collecting a career-high 21 re
bounds. Schweitzer said a goal
of his all season has been to top
20 rebounds in one game, and
the senior forward did it in his
final game for Stanford.
Schweitzer's performance
also assured him the Pac-8 re
bounding championship. Di-
Biaso guessed that the 21 re
bounds were the highlight of the
Card captain's Stanford career.
Two other high points in
volved one Stanford player
whose career ended Friday and
another whose career is really
just beginning.

Simons big factor
The Cards would not have
won the game without Mike Si
mons, one of the few players
who scored consistently. The
senior guard played 29 minutes
and scored 14 points on seven of
14 from the field, mostly from far
outside.
Finally, Stanford freshman
Wolfe Perry played the entire

game and led the Cards with 15
points. Ferry averaged 15.0
points in Stanford's last three
games, against USC, UCLA and
Cal. andappears ready to make a
fantastic contribution to next
year's team.
Card forward Ceorge Schader,
still suffering from a stress frac
ture and a strained achilles ten
don, watched the game in street
clothes from the bench. Trainer
Dave Blanchard decided that
Schader's leg had taken all the
punishment it could over the last
month, and held him out of the
game.
Seniors speak
After the game Schweitzer
talked about the future of Stan
ford basketball, while Simons
looked back on his Stanford
career.
"Dißiaso is a helluva coach,"
Schweitzer said. "If he gets the
kids he's going after, they're
going to have some great teams
in the future."
"I'm just glad 1 finally got a
chance to play," said Simons,
who stuck it out for four years to
get some playing time. "I sup
pose I could sit back and have a
lot of regrets about being on the
bench. But just to get this chance
to play meant a lot to me. I have
to be satisfied."

month, and held him out of the
game.
Seniors speak
After the game Schweitzer
talked about the future of Stan
ford basketball, while Simons
looked back on his Stanford
career.
"Dißiaso is a helluva coach,"
Schweitzer said. "If he gets the
kids he's going after, they're
going to have some great teams
in the future."
"I'm just glad 1 finally got a
chance to play," said Simons,
who stuck it out for four years to
get some playing time. "I sup
pose I could sit back and have a
lot of regrets about being on the
bench. But just to get this chance
to play meant a lot to me. I have
to be satisfied."
Simons added: "I think I did
OK."
The same could probably be
said of the 1975-76 Cards, de
spite their 3-11 Pac-8 record.
Cardinal Notes: Schweitzer's
21 rebounds gave him 704 for his
career, third best in Stanford his
tory. . . Schweitzer is Stanford's
all-time leader in career field
goal percentage (.528). . . Tim
Patterson finished his career as
the No. 4 all-time percentage
shooter in Stanford history with
a .497 mark.

BERKELEY—After looking at
California's decrepit Harmon
Gymnasium, you'd think Cal
couldn't give a damn about its
basketball program.
And after looking at the Bears'
performance Friday night
against Stanford, you'd probably
come to the same conclusion.
The Cards, for that matter,
didn't look all that keyed either.
They did manage to play decent
basketball for about 20 out of 40
minutes, which exceeded Cal's
total by about 15 minutes. Only
in isolated instances, did the
Bears interrupt their lackluster
play with Pacific Eight quality
basketball.
The result was Stanford 73,
Cal 65. The win gave the Cards a
3-11 final Pac-8 record and a
9-18 mark overall in coach Dick
Dißiaso's first vear at Stanford.
Cal finished sixth in the Pac-8,
one game above seventh-place
Stanford, at 4-10 in the confer
ence and 12-14 overall.
Bad start
The first few minutes of the
game gave the 4915 fans some
idea of the basketball "wizar
dry" they would witness the rest
of the night. It had to be seen to
be believed.

In the first four and one-half
minutes, pseudo-stud Rickie
Hawthorne,forward Card Bird of
Cal and Stanford's Ed
Schweitzer were all called for
traveling, Mike Bratz and Tim
Patterson each chipped in tur

novers on bad passes, Haw
thorne missed the entire urn on a
breakaway layup and Patterson
hit the side of the backbofrd on a
10-foot baseline jumper.
Players on both teams}Jid ev
erything but score. Thf game
was scoreless for the 2:04
before Cal's Connie While com
pleted a three-point plar. Stan
ford didn't score until jiy Car
ter hit a fade shot from (nx feet
out with 3:31 gone.
Little scoring
The score remained a
baseball-like 3-2 until tve and
one-half minutes had elipsed in
the half, and neither tgim was
stalling. Stanford scored only
three baskets total in (he first
8:40.
Dißiaso was asked ifter the
game if he had ever s<en any
thing like it.
"Yes," he said. "I wjis at In
diana once and we onl// scored
13 points in the first halj . . . and
we were hot."
By halftime, Cal had .accumu
lated 11 turnovers and Stanford
10. The Bears finished the game
with 18 turnovers, nol exactly
indicative of slick ballhandling,
while the Cards tottled 16.
Schweitzer led all plajers with
four traveling violations.
Poor shooting
Cal shot a feeble 35 percent
from the field; Stanford shot
only 38 percent. Only one player
on either team shot ov<r 50 per
cent from the floor — Cal's Rock
Lee, who hit three of four shots
in 14 minutes of playing time.

Hawthorne made up for his
career-high 37 points against
USC last week with a truly mis
erable game against Stanford.
The Cal senior hit one of seven
shots from the field (and that was
a layup), was called for traveling
twice and palming the ball once.
And all in the first half yet.
Hawthorne was four of 15 from
the field for the game and added
three traveling calls.
Bratz wasn't far behind. The
Stanford guard missed all of his
five first-half shots from the
field, and finished just four of 14.
Bird grounded
Bird, who scored 26 points in
Cal's 89-85 double-overtime win
over Stanford at Maples Pavilion
last month, hit only three of his
15 shots, but did grab nine re
bounds.
The quality of play was no bet
ter than the game's setting. Har
mon Gym is not only a blight
on the Cal campus, but probably
on the state of California too. It's
really that bad.
The place is actually an over
sized high school gym and gives
a new dimension to the word
"dingy." Cal must have hired
Count Dracula as the interior de
corator. The dominant color is
sort of a battleship gray and the
criss-cross steel rafters resemble
the siding of the Bay Bridge.
Harmon has all the atmosphere
of a wholesale hardware store.
__ Bright spots
Several positive achievements
did shine through all the nega
tive aspects of the game.

Schweitzer set a record for op
posing players in Harmon by
collecting a career-high 21 re
bounds. Schweitzer said a goal
of his all season has been to top
20 rebounds in one game, and
the senior forward did it in his
final game for Stanford.
Schweitzer's performance
also assured him the Pac-8 re
bounding championship. Di-
Biaso guessed that the 21 re
bounds were the highlight of the
Card captain's Stanford career.
Two other high points in
volved one Stanford player
whose career ended Friday and
another whose career is really
just beginning.

Simons big factor
The Cards would not have
won the game without Mike Si
mons, one of the few players
who scored consistently. The
senior guard played 29 minutes
and scored 14 points on seven of
14 from the field, mostly from far
outside.
Finally, Stanford freshman
Wolfe Perry played the entire

game and led the Cards with 15
points. Ferry averaged 15.0
points in Stanford's last three
games, against USC, UCLA and
Cal. andappears ready to make a
fantastic contribution to next
year's team.
Card forward Ceorge Schader,
still suffering from a stress frac
ture and a strained achilles ten
don, watched the game in street
clothes from the bench. Trainer
Dave Blanchard decided that
Schader's leg had taken all the
punishment it could over the last
month, and held him out of the
game.
