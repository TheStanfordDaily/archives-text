# Ombudsman aide reviews current Dead Week policy
## 
### Kim Hatamiya 
According to the University's In
formation Bulletin, Dead Week is a
time when "no quizzes or examina
tions should be given, and no musical,
dramatic, and athletic events involv
ing compulsory student participation
should be scheduled."
However, in response to the widely
shared opinion that Dead Week in
practice falls short of this ideal, stu
dent Assistant to the Ombudsman
Margie Weisz has inquired into the
week's original intent.
"Several very frustrated students
came to me during Dead Week last
quarter," said Weisz. They "felt their
rights and privileges were being sorely
abused."
In a sampling of student opinion,
Weisz said she found students com
plaining that Dead Week's only dis
tinction was the increased demand
made on students.
"For example, major assignments
such as papers, projects and take-home
exams are often assigned or due during
Dead Week." she said.
According to Weisz, faculty mem
bers were asked by the Executive
Committee of the Academic Council to
refrain from handing out take-home
examinations during the week, to
make an effort to be available during

the week and to assign term papers
early in each quarter.
The committee, however, said regu
lar classes may continue and custom
ary weekly assignments may be given
during the week.
In practice, Weisz said, "The
amount of new work presented and as
signed may be stepped up on the final
week of classes if lectures are behind
schedule."

She said students complained that
in addition to the increased work load,
finals scheduled late in finals week
have sometimes been moved up a
week after a student vote.
A majority of students polled by
Weisz preferred professors' devoting
Dead Week to "summing up and re
view," Weisz said, adding that "either
Dean (of Student Affairs James) Lyons
or Ombudsman John Goheen will send
out some kind of interdepartmental
memo as a reminder to the faculty" of
the week's original intent.
"Dead Week should be a time set
aside when there is nothing prevent
ing a student from choosing to be a
student," Lyons said.
Although thereis no policy forcing a
student to participate, Lyons said he
felt that peer or faculty pressure upon a
key member of a committee or athletic
team is often exercised.
"Allowing a majority of a class to
decide whether or not their final exam
should be scheduled earlier is unfair."
he said. "People should not be coerced
into having their rights infringed
upon," he added.

plaining that Dead Week's only dis
tinction was the increased demand
made on students.
"For example, major assignments
such as papers, projects and take-home
exams are often assigned or due during
Dead Week." she said.
According to Weisz, faculty mem
bers were asked by the Executive
Committee of the Academic Council to
refrain from handing out take-home
examinations during the week, to
make an effort to be available during

the week and to assign term papers
early in each quarter.
The committee, however, said regu
lar classes may continue and custom
ary weekly assignments may be given
during the week.
In practice, Weisz said, "The
amount of new work presented and as
signed may be stepped up on the final
week of classes if lectures are behind
schedule."

She said students complained that
in addition to the increased work load,
finals scheduled late in finals week
have sometimes been moved up a
week after a student vote.
A majority of students polled by
Weisz preferred professors' devoting
Dead Week to "summing up and re
view," Weisz said, adding that "either
Dean (of Student Affairs James) Lyons
or Ombudsman John Goheen will send
out some kind of interdepartmental
memo as a reminder to the faculty" of
the week's original intent.
"Dead Week should be a time set
aside when there is nothing prevent
ing a student from choosing to be a
student," Lyons said.
Although thereis no policy forcing a
student to participate, Lyons said he
felt that peer or faculty pressure upon a
key member of a committee or athletic
team is often exercised.
"Allowing a majority of a class to
decide whether or not their final exam
should be scheduled earlier is unfair."
he said. "People should not be coerced
into having their rights infringed
upon," he added.


ANYTHING BUT DEAD—Margie Weisz (left), one of two student assistants to
the ombudsman, confers with ner boss, John Goheen, emeritus professor of
philosophy, and the other assistant Marsha Wilkes. Weisz. after hearing many
student complaints, inouired into the original intent of Dead Week, including
the principles behind tne week and the actual purpose of classes during this
time.
According to the University's In
formation Bulletin, Dead Week is a
time when "no quizzes or examina
tions should be given, and no musical,
dramatic, and athletic events involv
ing compulsory student participation
should be scheduled."
However, in response to the widely
shared opinion that Dead Week in
practice falls short of this ideal, stu
dent Assistant to the Ombudsman
Margie Weisz has inquired into the
week's original intent.
"Several very frustrated students
came to me during Dead Week last
quarter," said Weisz. They "felt their
rights and privileges were being sorely
abused."
In a sampling of student opinion,
Weisz said she found students com
plaining that Dead Week's only dis
tinction was the increased demand
made on students.
