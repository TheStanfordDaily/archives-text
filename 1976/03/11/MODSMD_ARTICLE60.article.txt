# Admissions: athletes receive little preference
## 
### Ron Beck Analysis 
Since the inception of the Pacific Eight
athletic conference in 1959, student
athletes at Stanford have been matched
against semi-professional athletes from
other schools.
Yet Stanford, known more for its Nobel
Prize winners than its Heisman Trophy
winners, has done exceptionally well in
competition against Pac-8 schools that stake
their entire reputation on the success of
their athletic program.
Running a scholastic system that calls for
both academic and athletic excellence is the
responsibility of the University's Admis
sions Office and the Athletic Department,
and both see a trade-off occurring.
The athletic program can be the best in
the nation, both departments agree, but only
if athletes are admitted who are unqualified
to compete in the academic side of the
school. Or the athletic program can be
scaled down, but only with a resulting fall
in alumni donations, fan interest, publicity
and innumerable other benefits to the Uni
versity.
Compromise course
Fred Hargadon, dean of admissions, has
the final say on who is accepted here. Ac
cording to Hargadon, Stanford's policy in
the last decade has been to follow a com
promise course.
"Obviously, athletics is an integialoart of
the University's
"and it's unreasonable for us not to act ac
cordingly. We have always had an admis
sions policy which recognizes diverse ta
lents, and, clearly for some, athletics is their
strongest point.
"But we don't admit people who we don't
think can make it through academically,"

he added.
Of all Stanford sports, football is the most
visible to the public, puts the most pressure
on participants and coaches, and is the most

expensive. Traditionally, however, those
who have excelled in athletics have been
poor academic prospects and have little
chance of attending Stanford.
No way, O.J.
Even though the team is forced to bypass
players such as O.J. Simpson and Anthony
Davis, head football coach Jack Christian
sen said that Stanford can still get enough
talent to compete on a major scale.
"We can get our share of student-athletes
and compete at a high-level in our confer
ence and nationally," he said. "We may
have to pass up a lot of good players, but the
first thing we're looking for is an athlete that
can play for us and graduate in four years.
"We have disappointments because there
are people who could help our program, but
the admissions people don't think they can
do the work."
Because of the necessary trade-off bet
ween academics and athletics, Christiansen
is obligated to lobby for candidates that

"It's the coach's job to pressure," Harga
don said. "It's healthy pressure. If I were a
coach I'd want the Admissions Office to
know who we wanted.
"And it's the same pressure all over the
University. Every department has candi
dates who it would like to see get in."

Christiansen and the other coaches,
"have been very good at recognizing that
the decisions rest with us," Hargadon said.
According to Christiansen, Stanford
coaches are well aware of the problems po
tential recruits incur when applying and the
coaches learn to work by it.
"It's not our position to say who gets in,"
he said. "We, as coaches, can only go by the
guidelines in going out and attempting .to
find the most qualified studeht-athletes.
"We only encourage them to apply. Ad
missions are determined by people in the
Admissions Office."
Sports Information Director Gary Cavalli
recognizes the pressure that the Athletic
Department exerts, and says that it's jus
tified.
"Mistakes have been made in admitting
some athletes," he said, "but the mistakes
are probably not as large as in other depart
ments of the University, because the Ad
missions Office knows that the focus and
publicity will be on the athletes.
Ruetz: I think all the students here have
to think about the academics.
"Certain marginal candidates get in
through the influence of coaches — saying
the kid is a must for the program —but there
are marginal admits in every department."
Cavalli added. However, an athlete, unlike a
journalist, or an artist or a musician does his
thing before thousands of people and often
brings in a great deal of money.
"For those reasons, maybe his skills
should be weighed heavily."
Separate entities
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz agrees.
"The Admissions Office is separated from

us so that their decisions are independent of
our desires," he said. "But the coaches are
in the best position to judge an applicant's
potential athletic contribution.
"The Admissions Office doesn't always
take their advice, but (Hargadon) has to
measure the athletic admissions in the regu
lar process."
Hargadon: Stanford will be known
whether we win or lose in football.
Despite the obvious benefits to
theUniversity resulting from athletic excel
lence, those who think Stanford should be
purely academically-oriented believe that it
compromises its scholastic integrity in
order to admit some athletes.
Cavalli said that although some athletes
don't seem to fit in well with the student
side of Stanford, the Athletic Department
isn't always responsible.
"There are a variety of reasons why un
qualified athletes have sometimes made it
into Stanford," he said. "Maybe an athlete
was having an easy time in high school —
the teachers gave him high marks just be
cause of his athletic excellence.
"There are some admitted who turn out to
be mistakes, but the graduation record of
our athletes and the percentage that go on to
grad school proves that thp overwhelming
amoung of athletes accepted were good
risks." Cavalli said.
Both Athletic Department and Admis
sions Office officials say that students rarely
enter Stanford solely for athletics.
"Even if a kid is coming primarily to play
football, the education has to be of some
influence on him," Cavalli said.
"We do have a lot of players in pro foot

ball, and we do have a strong athletic prog
ram, but that doesn't mean academics have
been sacrificed."
Christiansen says that all the students
who show an interest in playing football at
Stanford have at least a strong secondary
interest in education.
Ruetz agrees that few students attend
Stanford merely for sports.
"Some of the students may come here as a
means to play in the pros," Ruetz said,"and
some of them may decide against playing
pro ball in mid-stream. But I think all the
students here have to think about the
academics."
Hard application process
Besides being scholastically tougher once
admitted, Stanford's application process for
athletes is the hardest in the conference. At
UCLA, for example, an Admissions Com
mittee for Athletes composed of the faculty
athletic representative, the dean of students
and an assistant dean of one of the colleges
can admit athletes without going through
the ordinary application process.
Athletes applying to Stanford, however,
e required to go through the ordinary ad
missions process.
Ilargadon amplified Stanford's applica
tion problem:
"No other school asks the kids to take
tests and to fill out applications," he said.
"That's something they don't have to do
anywhere else, and it seems as if Stanford is
making them jump through a lot of hurdles.
But it's not something we don't make any
one else do."
The glaring difference between Stanford
and other Pac-8 schools in its attitude to
ward athletic admissions is summed up by
Hargadon: "Stanford will be known
whether we win or lose in football."
