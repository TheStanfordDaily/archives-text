# Senior takes fourth Pac-8 crown
## Marcy wins side horse 
### Jeff Parietti 
The Stanford gymnastics squad trailed the field
in the Pacific Eight meet held last weekend in
Eugene, Ore. California captured its ninth confer
ence crown and will probably be the favorite to
repeat as NCAA gymnastics champion next
month.
Although the Robber Barons didn't fare well,
senior Ted Marcy won his fourth consecutive
Pac-8 title in the pommel side horse. Marcy, a two
time NCAA champion in the same event, will
defend his national crown at the
NCAA championships in Philadelphia April
1-3.
Stanford sophomore Bob Farb, expected to
place high in the all-around competition, was
hampered by a wrist injury received earlier in the
season and ended up in seventh position.
'Tough meet'
According to Baron coach Sadao Hamada, the
injury prevented Farb from doing strenuous
workouts for the past six weeks. "It was a tough
meet for him, his wrist is still very painful," said
Hamada.
But Hamada believes that in the long run the rest
may have been good for Farb. "I think he needed a
little rest for both his mind and his body. Now,
maybe he can get his mind set for the Olympic
trials." The trials will be held May 28-29.
Farb, who recently competed on the U.S. men's
gymnastics team in a meet against Romania,
needs to place among the top six in the Trials to
make the U.S. Olympic squad.
As for Marcy's performance, which earned him
Athlete of the Meet honors, Hamada said, "his
(Marcy's) peformance was very mature. As a
freshman he was a litle unstable in his routines,

but he did a real good job this year."
Marcy was happy to get the award. "It was a real
nice honor and it's really appreciated" he said.
Pressure
He commented on his final Pac-8 meet over
his first. "There was the same amount of pressure
and the pressure will always be thee, but I can just
cope with it much better now," Marcy said.
Marcy added that he's looking forwad to de
fending his NCAA title, although he said, "I'm a
little sad that it'll be my last collegiate competi
tion. But I'll be able to see a lot of people at the
(NCAA) meet that I haven't seen for awhile."
There will be no possibility of an Olympic berth
for the Oak Brook, 111. native however. Olympic
gymnastic competition is conducted only in the
all-around, while Marcy is a specialist. Hamada
believes that if speciality competition was held in
the Games, "Marcy would probably win a gold
medal."
Different priorities
Marcy isn't sure if he'll be competing in the
sport next year, as he will be a first-year medical
student at Yale."The priority of gymnastics in my
life will change," he said. "My studies will be first
and any time beyond that I'd like to spend in the
gym because I enjoy the sport."
As for the rest of the team, Hamada said, "most
of the others did their best routine of the season. I
feel proud of my guys in that they did their best."
Hamada singled out the efforts of freshman
Chris Takimoto, who performed, "three very good
routines."
Like some other Stanford athletic teams, gym
nastics is hindered by a lack of scholarships.
Gymnastics is allowed only one and this fact
showed in the final team results.
