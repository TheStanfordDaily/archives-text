# Swimmers last in Championships
## 
### Chris Kamel 
For Stanford,last weekend was
one in which 25 swimmers
achieved personal best times.
But even a performance like this
could not help the Cardinal
men's swimming team from
finishing fourth out of as many
teams in the Pacific Eight
Championships in Los Angeles.
The Cards, whom coach Jim
Gaughran expected to finish in
the cellar spot, had only a chance
to beat out Cal, but a strong per
formance from the Golden Bears
avenged an earlier 58-55 loss to
Stanford. Cal finished ahead of
the Cards, 328-284, as (JSC took
it all with 559 points.
Stanford traveled to the
Championships without the aid
of freestyler Mike Bruner, who
has been gone this year prepar
ing for the Olympic trials.
Cards Scott O'Connor and Jon
Powell managed to fill that hole
somewhat and joined teammate
Dave Fairbanks who earlier won

the 100-yard freestyle in 45.3, as
qualifiers in the NCAA Champ
ionships at Brown University in
three weeks. O'Connor qualified
with a 21.5 50-free while Pow
ell's 50-free time of 21.08 puts
him under consideration to
compete in the NCAAs.
'Super job'
It was not to be the last time
Powell was to be heard from that
day, however.
"Jon had probably one of the
most successful meets of the
swimmers," Gaughran said. "He
did a super job in all events we
entered him in, especially con
sidering he is still unshaved."
The sophomore from San
Mateo also qualified in the 100-
yard freestyle with a 45.5 clock
ing while anchoring the 400-
yard freestyle relay. According
to Gaughran, Powell's 44.8 an
chor leg accounted for thp mlav
squad's best time of the season.
Backstroke boost
Stanford got a boost from its
backstroke contingent which
Gaughran felt was compara
tively weaker than those of other
opponents. The Card
backstrokes dropped their 100-
yard and 200-yard times. Indi
vidually, Jack Connelly qual
ified for the two events, while
Cliff Lowell beat the NCAA
"consideration" time for 100-
yard backstroke.
The breaststroke events pro
vided little surprise as NCAA
champion John Hencken easily
breezed by all his competitors in
the 100-yard breaststroke in
56.88, while Stuart Corliss' "un
shaven" time of 59.1 in that
event constituted his best time
and earned him a spot in the
NCAA's
Rounding out Stanford's per
formance, the Cards' 400-yard
medley relay team qualified in
3:25.7.
Last chance
Stanford swimmers have one
more chance to qualify for the
Nationals. The Japanese champ
ion swim team from Nihon Uni
versity will compete at Stanford
this Saturday at 1 p.m.
"We will have time trials for
individuals," Gaughran
explained. "It will be the last
time because the deadline is this
Monday. In this light, the meet
will be very important for Brian
Roux, Sam Fanklin, Jim Belardi
and Kevin Reel. Roux and
Franklin are under considera
tion for qualifying while Belardi
is still a couple of hundredths
under the consideration time.
"I hope that Sam will be able
to drop down this weekend as
well as Jim," said Gaughran. "It
should be an important weekend
for our backstrokers."
It also should be an important
weekend as far as Stanford's
NCAA chances are concerned.
Gaughran hopes to hold on to
last year's sixth-place finish, but
some teams are getting quite
strong. The Cards will have a
strong challenge from North
Carolina State, Auburn and
California.
The women's squad competes
a week from today in the Associ
ation of Intercollegiate Athletics
for Women Championships at
the University of Miami. Ac
cording to Gaughran, Stanford
should place in the top four.
