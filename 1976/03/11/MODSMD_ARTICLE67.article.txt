## Card nine travels to L.A. 
### Chris Baker 
The Stanford baseball team
may find it a little hard to con
centrate on final examinations
this weekend.
The Cards travel to Los
Angeles to open their California
Intercollegiate Baseball Associa
tion (CIBA) season against
UCLA tomorrow afternoon at
2:30 p.m. A doubleheader is on
tap for Saturday at noon.
The CIBA was revived this
year to replace the Pacific Eight
Southern Division which was
disolved, in baseball, golf and
tennis, by a vote of the confer
ence athletic directors last year.
UCLA,IO-7on the year,opened
its CIBA season last weekend,
dropping two out of three games
to defending Pac-8 Southern Di

vision Champion USC. Califor
nia was also in league action,
taking two of three game's from
IJC —Santa Barbara, the newest
entry in the loop.
'No dominant teams'
"At this point," said Stanford
coach Ray Young, "I don't see
any one dominant force in the
conference. The league looks
wide open among evenly
matched teams."
UCLA's Sawtelle Field was
dubbed the "Fenway Park of the
Pac-8 " by KZSU sports caster
Mob Dean last year. It's a good
nickname. Sacramento's infam
ous Hughes Stadium is a joy to
pitch in compared to Sawtelle.
Just ask Stanford hurler John
Yandle.
Yandle, who is slated to start

the first game of the series to
morrow, allowed three home
runs in just six innings of work at
Sawtelle last year, as the Bruins
took a 4-3 decision.
Play our game
"We've got to go down there
with the idea that we're going to
play our game," said Young.
"Our pitching will just have to
come through," he added.
Yandle is coming off one of his
best performances.The junior
left-hander pitched a four-hit
shutout against Fresno State, as
the Cards took a 7-0 game last
weekend. Yandle struck out
eight men and needed only 119
pitches to go the full nine in
nings.
In the second game of the
Sunken Diamond double heder
against the Bulldogs, it was
Stanford hitting a 12-1 contest.
Senior short stop Steve Davis hit
for the cycle. The two-time All
- short stop had a home run
in the first inning of the second
game against Fresno, then fol
lowed with a triple, double and
single.
Leading hitter
Davis is the leading Stanford
hitter with a .402 average. With
seven home runs this season, he
needs only six more to tie the
Stanford single season mark of
13, set by catcher Bruce Robin
son last year.
"If we play like we played on
Saturday against Fresno State,
no one can beat us," said Young.
But Young, Stanford's win
ningest baseball coach (294
wins), added, "We still have a
tendency to be up and down
overall. Our particular weakness
continues to be inconsistent in
field play.
Must start fast
"When we start fast and gain
momentum, we play extremely
well," said Young. "That's how
we hope to open the conference
season."
Young said that junior Jerry
Argust (1-0, 3.00 ERA) and
freshmen righthanders Bruce
Fiala (2-1, 1.69 ERA) and Brian
Harrison (1-0) will see action on
the mound this weekend.
Stanford will head back to
southern California for the
Riverside Tournament, Mar.
22-27.
