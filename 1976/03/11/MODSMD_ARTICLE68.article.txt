Golfers lose
In golf's answer to football's
Big Game, Stanford's men's golf
team lost to Cal last Thursday at
Walnut Creek, 15-12.
Glenn Goethals' team-leading
round of 74 along with his indi
vidual match win was not
enough against a Cal squad
which coach Hud Finger terms
"probably the strongest in Cal's
history." Cal seemed more at
ease with the course as only two
other Stanford match wins were
turned in by Jay Johnston, 75,
and Wade Nonnenberg, 80.
It did not take long for the
Cards to get back on track, how
ever, as they took their aggres
sions out on the Stanford Golf
Club three days later, 21V2-5V2.
Nonnenberg led Stanford with a
match-winning 74 while Bruce
McDonald (79). freshmen Kim
Cater (75) and Doug Rice (79)
also tallied match wins.
Men's tennis
Stanford sent three men's
doubles teams to the Pacific
Coast Doubles Tournament in La
Jolla last weekend, and all were
knocked out by the third round.
The Bill Maze-Craig Johnson
and Mark Mitchell-Matt Mitch
ell teams lost in the third round,
while Perry Wright and Alex
Cortes were eliminated in round
two.

Peter Fleming and Brian
Teacher of UCLA, the top seeded
team, won the tournament.
Dißiaso unhurt
Stanford Head Basketball
Coach Dick Dißiaso has had a
tough year, even disregarding
the Cards' 3-11 Pacific Eight re
cord.
First he broke his nose in a
pre-season faculty game. Then
his car got stuck in a car wash.
And Tuesday the Los Angeles
hotel in which he was staying
caught on fire.
The blaze claimed one life and
destroyed 72 rooms, but Dißiaso
escaped uninjured by descend
ing from his second story room
on a ladder.
The coach did lose all his per
sonal belongings, including his
recruiting book.
