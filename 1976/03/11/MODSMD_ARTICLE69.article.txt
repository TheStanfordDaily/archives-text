with my development in tennis.
I couldn't put as much time in it
and put time in academics tak
ing the courses 1 wanted."
Explaining his decision of
tennis over school, Saviano con
tinued, "Tennis has got me
where I am today. It's meant a lot
to me since I was 12."
I've thought about turning pro
since the first day of high school

the National Indoors in Salis

Saviano said he felt that the
time was right to go pro. "It was
the best thing for my game and
for the Stanford team."
Although Saviano said he had
a difficult time "motivating my
self to play tennis at Stanford
and go to school," he left the

Leaving the team at the begin
ning of the season, Saviano con

motivated to play college tennis,
and as far as the team goes, it's
better to have the young, eager
players fill in the spots."
Saviano is optimistic at the
onset of his professional career.
Having played in professional
tournaments without financial

year, Saviano says he knows
what pro life is like.
Played with pros
Playing on the Associated
Tennis Professionals (ATP)
Asian Circuit last fall, Saviano
"proved to myself and others I
could break in and play with
others on the circuit." He
traveled with the circuit for eight
weeks, qualifying in four out of

seven tournaments.
Competition on the circuit in
cluded most of the top-ranked
professionals. Although he
could not accept money as an
amateur in such tournaments,
prizes reached $50,000 in the
Hawaii tourney and $100,000 in
Sidney.
From here, Saviano has three
prospective routes, "I may play
on a circuit in Europe in a couple
of weeks, or a circuit in Mexico,
or 1 may play tournaments in
California."
Praises Gould
Looking back at his Stanford
career, Saviano said, "1 can't
thank Gould enough. He's an ex
cellent coach and a very, very
close friend. I've known him
throughout my tennis career."
The team was surprised when
they heard," Saviano continued,
"though I've often made indica
tions that I might turn pro for a

number of personal reasons."
Saviano evaluated the team he
left behind. "It's a good team.
Bill Maze is playing well. Gene
Mayer is one of the top players in
college tennis. They're all capa
ble of beating anyone in college
tennis. PatDuPre is playing real
well. Saviano sees these three
veterans as Stanford's "key to
success."
Career highlight
"Winning the NCAA Team
Championship when I was a
freshman," was the highlight of
Saviano's Stanford career.
"Mayer had quit, DuPre was
hurt. We'd lost two of our top
four, and we still won by a large
margin." Saviano was one of two
freshman tennis players to be
named Ail-American that year.
Saviano's sophomore year was
hampered by injuries, stemming
from a fractured ankle sustained
in an intramural basketball

game. Nevertheless, Saviano
was again ranked All-American.

From here, Saviano has three
prospective routes, "I may play
on a circuit in Europe in a couple
of weeks, or a circuit in Mexico,
or 1 may play tournaments in
California."
Praises Gould
Looking back at his Stanford
career, Saviano said, "1 can't
thank Gould enough. He's an ex
cellent coach and a very, very
close friend. I've known him
throughout my tennis career."
The team was surprised when
they heard," Saviano continued,
"though I've often made indica
tions that I might turn pro for a

number of personal reasons."
Saviano evaluated the team he
left behind. "It's a good team.
Bill Maze is playing well. Gene
Mayer is one of the top players in
college tennis. They're all capa
ble of beating anyone in college
tennis. PatDuPre is playing real
well. Saviano sees these three
veterans as Stanford's "key to
success."

"Winning the NCAA Team
Championship when I was a
freshman," was the highlight of
Saviano's Stanford career.
"Mayer had quit, DuPre was
hurt. We'd lost two of our top
four, and we still won by a large
margin." Saviano was one of two
freshman tennis players to be
named Ail-American that year.
Saviano's sophomore year was
hampered by injuries, stemming
from a fractured ankle sustained

a difficult time "motivating my
