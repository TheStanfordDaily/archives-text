With California's presidential prim
ary still three months away, students
here have organized four campaign
committees supporting various Demo
cratic. candidates.
Croups backing former Ceorgia Cov.
Jimmy Carter, Sen. Frank Church ID-
Idaho), former Oklahoma Sen. Fred
Harris and Rep. Morris Udall (D-Ariz.)
said they intend to provide informa
tion about the 1976 presidential con
test and influence delegate selection
for the Democratic National Conven
tion in July.
About 10 strong supporters form the
core of each committee.
Shea Dixon, a senior majoring in his
tory and coordinator of the group back
ing Carter, said he is promoting a

series of "dorm debates" between re
sidents of the various committees
planned for spring quarter.
Debate hosts
"Twelve of the 14 major student re
sidence complexes" are tentatively
scheduled to host debates. Dixon said.
He added that a larger debate plan
ned for May 18 in Cubberley Au
ditorium will conclude the series.
Heidi Zukoski, a senior majoring in
sociology and Udell's northern
California campaign chairman, pre
dicted that support for Udall here will
pick up rapidly as other states hold
their primary contests.
She said I Jdall is "the second choice
of the other liberal contenders" and
that "as other liberals drop out of the
race they will probably throw their
support behind Udall."
Sophomore drama major Jack
Trujillo, a member of Harris' commit
tee, said student workers for Harris
"have been doing a lot of work in San
Francisco" and intend to bring their
campaign to campus during spring
quarter.
Similar ideologies
Church's committee, the most re
cently formed group, is headed by An
nette Lantos, a graduate student

in communication. She acknow
ledged that support for Church and
Udall is based on similar political
ideologies, but asserted that Church's
individual character sets him apart
from the Arizona congressman.
Sophomore Brad Krevoy said the
Stanford Democratic Committee,
which has yet to declare support for a
cadidate, has grown to about 60 mem
bers, most of whom are individually
supporting one of the contenders.
He said the committee's function
now in the campaign is to serve as a
"clearinghouse" for information.
