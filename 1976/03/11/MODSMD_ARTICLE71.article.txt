# Icemen close out season
## 
### David Georgette 
The Stanford ice hockey club has come of age.
Coming off a 2-0 shutout of the Nor. Cal. All-Stars
Mar. 3, the skaters ended a banner 9-1 season last
weekend, downing San Diego State twice, 4-1 and
9-5.
"This is the best team in the eight-year history
of Stanford hockey," said club president Danny
Schley. "I know we have the best record in
California, and probably on the West Coast."
In the first game against the Aztecs, Stanford
showed why it is much improved, barraging the
San Diego nets with 43 shots, and skating off with
a 4-1 victory. Jay Johnston and player-coach Pat
Baldwin accounted for three of Stanford's goals.
Things didn't go as smoothly in the second
game though. San Diego State erased an early
deficit with four second period goals to even the
game at 5-5.
â€” Card rally
Dan Fleming's latesecond period goal gave the
Card icemen a 6-5 lead. In the final stanza, Stan
ford blitzed San Diego with three goals for a 9-5
triumph.
Johnston and Baldwin again led the Stanford
scoring parade. Johnston scored twice and
Baldwin had two tallies and three assists.
Throughout the season, the pair have been the
principal cogs in Stanford's attack. "Pat's the

leader of the team," said defenseman John Harris
"and Jay has the best knack on the club for putting
the puck in the net." Baldwin ended the season
with 19 goals and Johnston beat the goalie 2
times.
But there's more than just offense to hockey.
Card goalkeeper Gervin Peters finished the year
with a 2.(3 goals-against-average, a figure many
NHL goalies wouldn't sneer at.
'Gained respect'
The single most important accomplishment ol
the season is the new stature of the Stanford hoc
key program. "We gained a lot of respect from the
other teams in California," said Schley. We beat
every semi-professional team we played, despite
the vindicative attitude of the teams toward col
lege hockey players," he added.
With only five returning lettermen.a 9-1 sensor
is even more amazing. "We built this team out ol
nothing," said Schley. "Next season we'll only
lose two players."
"We're looking forward to beating the puck ou
of some teams and making hockey an established
sport at Stanford," said Schley.
"We want to get more fan support," adds I larris
They just might. After all, winners bring out tin
fans, and when was the last time a Stanford team
had a 9-1 season?
