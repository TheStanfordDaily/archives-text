						Casa Italians: attractive addition to new row houses

### Rick Christian 
When the Italian theme house makes
its debut on the Row next fall, in one of
the three new Robert Moore houses,
the other five Row houses can expect a
run for their money, according to Prof.
Alphonse Juilland, chairman of the
Department of French and Italian.
He predicts that the competition
will be greatest between the Italian
house, Lu Casa Italiana, and the
French house, La Maison Francaise.
As with the French house, meal
times in La Casa are expected to be the
focal point of interest.
"We have found the consummate
chef; a true Italian Italian. She is abso
lutely amazing with the cuisine," Juil

land said.
Lu Casa Italiana will also provide its
44 residents with special TV cassettes
on the provinces and culture of Italy.
Special 24-hour Italian radio prog
ramming is also being planned. The
music would come from Naples and
Rome and would be piped into the in
dividual rooms, Juilland reported.
Numerous cultural activities and op
tional seminars will also be offered, he
said.
He was quick to emphasize, how
ever, that the new house will not exist
solely for the Italian community at the
University.
"The house will not be devoted only
to Italian specialists, but also to those

who are interested in the culture. We
are not looking solely for the experts
and Italian majors," Juilland said.
"We've profited from our experi
ence with the French house,!' Asst.
Dean of Student Affairs Norm Robin
son said. The lessons learned from es
tablishing La Muison Franca ise have
been useful in organizing the Italian
Theme House he added.
"It (La Casa) should be an exciting
place to live if it's as successful as the
French house has been," Robinson
said.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton said the American Studies
theme house will also occupy one of
the new row houses.
