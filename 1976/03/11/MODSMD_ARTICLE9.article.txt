# Establish courts for scientific disputes
## 
### 
V As debate on the Nuclear Safeguards
Initiative continues, it is becoming obvi
ous that present processes are wholly in
adequate to decide issues such as this
one.
For the past several months, we have
heard some scientists with impressive
credentials tell us that unless steps are
taken to curb the unchecked growth of
nuclear power, we may be blown up, ter
rorized and/or contaminated.
A second group of scientists, with
equally impressive credentials, tell us
. this is nonsense, and that the other scien
tists are predicting doom with no evi
-0 dence.
Voters, with no real knowledge except
the conflicting claims, get to decide
which group is right.
The initiative will likely be decided as
follows: Liberals will vote yes, conserva
tives will vote no. The outcome depends
on the mood of the voters this year, and
whether the June primary ballot interests
more liberal Democrats or conservative
Republicans.
Rational way?
Is this a rational way to decide one of
the most important issues of our time?
The Nuclear Safeguards Initiative is not
the only case in which important public
# issues are being decided without the

majority of people having any idea what
the facts are.
For example, a bill to ban aerosols is
already halfway through the state legisla
ture; and it seems very likely the issue
will be decided one way or the other
within the next few months.

Yet once again, the scientific data is
muddy. Proponents and opponents of the
ban each have batteries of "experts" tes
tifying. The legislators who will decide
the issue do not really know whether
aerosols will destroy the ozone layer, or
what that would mean. An important
issue will be decided by political wim.
These examples point out two major
problems. First non-experts cannot make
intelligent decisions on scientific matters
because they lack knowledge as to the

consequences of specific policy deci
sions. As a result, public policy is often
based on scientific misinformation.
Pontification
Second, the hitherto faultless reputa
tion of science in our society is becoming
tarnished by the use of scientific experts
to pontificate on all sides of a given issue,
without, apparently, any scientific search
for truth.
Scientists are in danger of becoming
discounted as paid expert witnesses, no
different from psychiatrists in a trial, who
are paid to explain why the defendant
is/is not guilty.
It is not difficult to understand why
scientists come to different conclusions.
Current theories say that the conclusions
reached on complex scientific questions
depend nearly entirely on how the prob
lem is defined.
It is also quite conceivable that scien
tists working for giant corporations, as
well as those with strong political
ideologies, unconsciously allow them
selves to become prostitutes, and reach
their conclusions before beginning a
study.
Scientific courts
Perhaps what is needed is a system of
scientific courts which could be con
vened at occasional intervals to ascertain

the facts of scientific disputes. Members
of the courts would be chosen by scien
tific organizations, and would be
specialists in aspects of the problem at
hand.
The courts, financed by the govern
ment, would hear all witnesses, conduct
necessary studies, and finally issue a re
port indicating the likely results of vari
ous policy alternatives.
The courts would not actually decide
whether to restrict nuclear power plants,
ban the use of aerosols, the Concorde,
synthetic dyes, legalize all drugs or con
vict a criminal pleading insanity.
Those decisions involve factors other
than purely scientific ones, and ulti
mately rest with the people and their rep
resentatives. ~~
But the scientific courts could give us
reasonably accurate data on which to base
decisions. If such data currently exists, it
is lost in a sea of conflicting pontifica
tions.
Whether or not scientific courts are in
deed established, one thing is cleanscien
tific prostitution must end, or we risk
turning all debate over technologies into
mere politics.

heard some scientists with impressive
credentials tell us that unless steps are
taken to curb the unchecked growth of
nuclear power, we may be blown up, ter
rorized and/or contaminated.
A second group of scientists, with
equally impressive credentials, tell us
. this is nonsense, and that the other scien
tists are predicting doom with no evi
-0 dence.
Voters, with no real knowledge except
the conflicting claims, get to decide
which group is right.
The initiative will likely be decided as
follows: Liberals will vote yes, conserva
tives will vote no. The outcome depends
on the mood of the voters this year, and
whether the June primary ballot interests
more liberal Democrats or conservative
Republicans.
Rational way?
Is this a rational way to decide one of
the most important issues of our time?
The Nuclear Safeguards Initiative is not
the only case in which important public
# issues are being decided without the

majority of people having any idea what
the facts are.
For example, a bill to ban aerosols is
already halfway through the state legisla
ture; and it seems very likely the issue
will be decided one way or the other
within the next few months.

Yet once again, the scientific data is
muddy. Proponents and opponents of the
ban each have batteries of "experts" tes
tifying. The legislators who will decide
the issue do not really know whether
aerosols will destroy the ozone layer, or
what that would mean. An important
issue will be decided by political wim.
These examples point out two major
problems. First non-experts cannot make
intelligent decisions on scientific matters
because they lack knowledge as to the

consequences of specific policy deci
sions. As a result, public policy is often
based on scientific misinformation.
Pontification
Second, the hitherto faultless reputa
tion of science in our society is becoming
tarnished by the use of scientific experts
to pontificate on all sides of a given issue,
without, apparently, any scientific search
for truth.
Scientists are in danger of becoming
discounted as paid expert witnesses, no
different from psychiatrists in a trial, who
are paid to explain why the defendant
is/is not guilty.
It is not difficult to understand why
scientists come to different conclusions.
Current theories say that the conclusions
reached on complex scientific questions
depend nearly entirely on how the prob
lem is defined.
It is also quite conceivable that scien
tists working for giant corporations, as
well as those with strong political
ideologies, unconsciously allow them
selves to become prostitutes, and reach
their conclusions before beginning a
study.
Scientific courts
Perhaps what is needed is a system of
scientific courts which could be con
vened at occasional intervals to ascertain

the facts of scientific disputes. Members
of the courts would be chosen by scien
tific organizations, and would be
specialists in aspects of the problem at
hand.
The courts, financed by the govern
ment, would hear all witnesses, conduct
necessary studies, and finally issue a re
port indicating the likely results of vari
ous policy alternatives.
The courts would not actually decide
whether to restrict nuclear power plants,
ban the use of aerosols, the Concorde,
synthetic dyes, legalize all drugs or con
vict a criminal pleading insanity.
Those decisions involve factors other
than purely scientific ones, and ulti
mately rest with the people and their rep
resentatives. ~~
But the scientific courts could give us
reasonably accurate data on which to base
decisions. If such data currently exists, it
is lost in a sea of conflicting pontifica
tions.
Whether or not scientific courts are in
deed established, one thing is cleanscien
tific prostitution must end, or we risk
turning all debate over technologies into
mere politics.
