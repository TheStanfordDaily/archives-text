# Press printing plant may close by Sept. 30
## 
### Mark Simonian 
The University will probably close
the printing division of the Stanford
University Press by Sept. 30, putting
about 40 press workers out of jobs.
The press will continue to publish
scholarly works, according to Press
Director Leon Seltzer, but the books
will be typeset and printed elsewhere,
if the plan to close the printing divi
sion is finally approved.
The 40 persons subject to layoffs
currently serve in proofreading, com
position. camera and platemaking,
printing and binding, clerical and
administrative positions.
The majority of those employes will
face layoffs in late summer or early
fall, but a few could lose their jobs as
early as next month, said Doug Bar
ton, the University's chief counsel for

employe relations.
Barton said the University's deci
sion to close the printing operation is
almost certain, but the "University felt
obliged to leave the door open" for the
unions involved to propose alterna
tives.
Five union locals are involved in the
layoffs, including United Stanford
Employees (USE). The other four are
Western Graphic Arts Union No. 14,
Graphic Arts International Union
Locals 2HO and 313 and Bay Area
Typographical Union No. 21.
Barton said he scheduled to meet
with union representatives Wednes
day morning, to discuss severance
pay arrangements if nothing else.
The University will make efforts to
relocate employes in the University
and private firms, Barton added.
Barton said the University will
make a final decision on the press op
erations no later than April 5. Seltzer
notified press employes last Tuesday.
No action planned
USE President Jim Berk said the
union was "not planning any action"
and would probably hold the Univer
sity to a four-month notice clause for
the union's proofreaders. Other union
officials were unavailable for com
ment.
The principal reason for the print
ing shutdown is a decline in the de
mand for the press' printing coupled
with a need to sink a good deal of
money into new typographical
equipment, according to Vice Presi
dent for Business and Finance Robert

Augsburger.
"We're talking about an investment
ot $750,000 to $1 million over three
years in new equipment." Augsburger
said, "and the University is not pre
pared to make that kind of invest
ment."
The printing division of the press
had a sales volume last year of almost
$2 million.
The press currently typesets and
prints not only scholarly works but
also some University forms and such
mundane publications as Courses and
Degrees and the quarterly Time
Schedule. The press utilizes a linotype
or "hot type" system which uses lead
to produce castings for each line of
type.
'Cold type' needed
To become a modern, efficient op
eration, the press would have to lease
or purchase computer-operated
phototypesetting or "cold type" units,
Augsburger said.
lierk charged that the University
will run a less efficient operation by
not purchasing the equipment and
contracting the printing out instead.
"Contracting out is less efficient
and costs more." he said adding that
the higher costs will be "hidden" in
University budgets. "There'll be a lot
more superstructure and overhead
and a lot less quality control,"hesaid.
"This is just an implementation of
policy," Berk claimed. "Augsburger's
contracting out as much as he can."
Berk cited the contracting of the Tre-

Herk also charged that the Univer
sity will lire lower level press workers
while retaining "upper level adminis
trators" to act as liaison officers bet
ween the press and contracted prin
ters.
Augsburger responded that the
University has no set policy on con
tracting out work. "We look at how
best we can do things." he said.
Augsburger also accused Herk of at
tempting to set up a "political con
frontation" over the printing shut
down.
"I suspect that there are going to be
reductions all across the board," in
cluding administrative personnel, he
said of the staff reductions.
As a final note. Seltzer pointed out
that "very few university presses have
their own printing plants." as few as
tour or live. The Stanford Press was
established in H)25, but the "begin
nings of the printing plant antedates
that," Seltzer said.

Augsburger also accused Herk of at
tempting to set up a "political con
frontation" over the printing shut
down.
"I suspect that there are going to be
reductions all across the board," in
cluding administrative personnel, he
said of the staff reductions.
As a final note. Seltzer pointed out
that "very few university presses have
their own printing plants." as few as
tour or live. The Stanford Press was
established in H)25, but the "begin
nings of the printing plant antedates
that," Seltzer said.
The University will probably close
the printing division of the Stanford
University Press by Sept. 30, putting
about 40 press workers out of jobs.
The press will continue to publish
scholarly works, according to Press
Director Leon Seltzer, but the books
will be typeset and printed elsewhere,
if the plan to close the printing divi
sion is finally approved.
The 40 persons subject to layoffs
currently serve in proofreading, com
position. camera and platemaking,
printing and binding, clerical and
administrative positions.
The majority of those employes will
face layoffs in late summer or early
fall, but a few could lose their jobs as
early as next month, said Doug Bar
ton, the University's chief counsel for

employe relations.
Barton said the University's deci
sion to close the printing operation is
almost certain, but the "University felt
obliged to leave the door open" for the
unions involved to propose alterna
tives.
Five union locals are involved in the
layoffs, including United Stanford
Employees (USE). The other four are
Western Graphic Arts Union No. 14,
Graphic Arts International Union
Locals 2HO and 313 and Bay Area
Typographical Union No. 21.
Barton said he scheduled to meet
with union representatives Wednes
day morning, to discuss severance
pay arrangements if nothing else.
The University will make efforts to
relocate employes in the University
and private firms, Barton added.
Barton said the University will
make a final decision on the press op
erations no later than April 5. Seltzer
notified press employes last Tuesday.
No action planned
USE President Jim Berk said the
union was "not planning any action"
and would probably hold the Univer
sity to a four-month notice clause for
the union's proofreaders. Other union
officials were unavailable for com
ment.
The principal reason for the print
ing shutdown is a decline in the de
mand for the press' printing coupled
with a need to sink a good deal of
money into new typographical
equipment, according to Vice Presi
dent for Business and Finance Robert

Augsburger.
"We're talking about an investment
ot $750,000 to $1 million over three
years in new equipment." Augsburger
said, "and the University is not pre
pared to make that kind of invest
ment."
The printing division of the press
had a sales volume last year of almost
$2 million.
The press currently typesets and
prints not only scholarly works but
also some University forms and such
mundane publications as Courses and
Degrees and the quarterly Time
Schedule. The press utilizes a linotype
or "hot type" system which uses lead
to produce castings for each line of
type.
'Cold type' needed
To become a modern, efficient op
eration, the press would have to lease
or purchase computer-operated
phototypesetting or "cold type" units,
Augsburger said.
lierk charged that the University
will run a less efficient operation by
not purchasing the equipment and
contracting the printing out instead.
"Contracting out is less efficient
and costs more." he said adding that
the higher costs will be "hidden" in
University budgets. "There'll be a lot
more superstructure and overhead
and a lot less quality control,"hesaid.
"This is just an implementation of
policy," Berk claimed. "Augsburger's
contracting out as much as he can."
