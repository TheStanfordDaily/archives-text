# Oil company denies jobs to Jews
## 
### 
Smith and Bernhard

We are greatly disturbed by
the half-page advertisements
run in the Daily last quarter by
the Arabian American Oil Com
pany (Aramco). The ads, stat
ing, "Industrial Engineers,
Aramco has plans for you in
Saudi Arabia," neglected to
mention the company's dis
criminatory hiring policies for
work in Saudi Arabia.
Aramco, one of the world's
largest petroleum production
companies, is headquartered in
Houston, Tex., and operates in
Saudi Arabia. Its employment
application states that a condi
tion precedent to employment is
the "ability to obtain a visa from
the Saudi Arabian Govern
ment."
Under Saudi law, applicants
for visas to enter Saudi Arabia
must state their religion and
must product a certificate of
baptism. A Saudi consulate
must receive explicit authoriza
tion from the foreign ministry
before a Jew is issued a visa.
By use of this practice, Jews
have been almost totally barred
from entering the country since
1948. The only exceptions
which have been made have

been for some members of con
gressional committee staffs,
some American journalists, and
persons who have expressed
views sympathetic to the Arabs.
Violates act
Aramco, by stating that the
"ability to obtain a visa" is a
condition for employment, is
aware of Saudi Arabia's dis
criminatory practices.
Its hiring policy in the United
States therefore violates Title
VII, 62000e-2, of the 1964 Civil
Rights Aet, which states: "(a) It
shall be an unlawful employ
ment practice for an employer
— to fail or refuse to hire or to
discharge any individual, or
otherwise to discriminate
against any individual with re
spect to his compensation,
terms, conditions, or privileges
of employment, because of such
individual's color, relig
ion, sex, or national origin;
—to limit, segregate, or clas
sify his employees or applicants
for employment in any way
which would deprive or tend to
deprive any individual of
employment opportunities or
otherwise adversely affect his
status as an employee, because

of such individual's race, color,
religion, sex, or national ori
gin."
Documentation
Below are just a few
documented instances of Saudi
discriminatory entrance prac
tices:
From the New York Times
May 11, 1975; "Negotiations
toward a technical assistance
contract between the Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy (MIT) and Saudi Arabia
have broken down in a disag
reement over a guarantee for the
entry of Jews to work on the pro
ject."
From the Washington Post,
July 2, 1975: "Five Midwestern
universities have suspended
work on a project for Saudi
Arabia's University of Riyadh
after a Michigan State Univer
sity dean, who is Jewish, was
told he wouldn't get a visa from
the Saudi Government."
McGraw Associates, a Florida
firm with contracts for construc
tion work in Saudi Arabia,
placed a newspaper want ad for
skilled workers which
explicitly states: "We trust you
are aware of the discrimination
policies of the Arab world be
fore replying to this ad."
Complaint filed
A discriminatory practices
complaint against the Hospital
Corporation of America has
been filed with the Federal
Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission.
The corporation, by asking
for religious identification, sc
reens out Jewish applicants for
jobs in a Saudi Arabian hospital
with which it has a contract to
recruit personnel.
The U.S. Army Corps of En
gineers has not assigned Jewish
military personnel or Jewish
civilians to work in Saudi
Arabia. The Defense Depart
ment now claims that it no
longer directly screens out Jews
for the Saudi Government.
However, the department
concedes that Saudi Arabia still
refuses to grant visas to Jews.
Evidence exists that the Corps
requires religious identification
certificates from personnel
going to Saudi Arabia, which it

then submits to the Saudi Gov
ernment.
From the New York Times,
May 11, 1975: "The oil com
panies that form part of the Ara
bian American Oil Com
pany . . . and major contractors
in defense work (in Saudi
Arabia) such as Raytheon,
Lockheed, Northrop Aviation
and others do not recruit
American Jews for work in this
Moslem country."
Concern has not only been ex
pressed regarding Saudi Arabia
practices toward Jews, but also
against women and blacks. The
MIT spokesman, in announcing
the talks breakdown discussed
above, said, "We were con
cerned not only about religion,
but also sex."
Moreover, California Gov.
Edmund Brown, Jr., announced
last November that he had or
dered suspension of contract
negotiations between the
California Department of
Transportation and Saudi
Arabia due to evidence of a
Saudi ban against blacks, wo
men and Jews who would be
working on the proposed pro
ject.
We are certain no member of
the Stanford community would
want to be part of an agreement
which discriminates against
any American, for reason of re
ligion, race or sex.
We therefore urge the Daily
not to accept future ads from
Aramco or any other company
whose hiring practices are so
blatantly discriminatory. We
also recommend that, if such
ads are run, members of the
Stanford community not re
spond to them.

We are greatly disturbed by
the half-page advertisements
run in the Daily last quarter by
the Arabian American Oil Com
pany (Aramco). The ads, stat
ing, "Industrial Engineers,
Aramco has plans for you in
Saudi Arabia," neglected to
mention the company's dis
criminatory hiring policies for
work in Saudi Arabia.
Aramco, one of the world's
largest petroleum production
companies, is headquartered in
Houston, Tex., and operates in
Saudi Arabia. Its employment
application states that a condi
tion precedent to employment is
the "ability to obtain a visa from
the Saudi Arabian Govern
ment."
Under Saudi law, applicants
for visas to enter Saudi Arabia
must state their religion and
must product a certificate of
baptism. A Saudi consulate
must receive explicit authoriza
tion from the foreign ministry
before a Jew is issued a visa.
By use of this practice, Jews
have been almost totally barred
from entering the country since
1948. The only exceptions
which have been made have

been for some members of con
gressional committee staffs,
some American journalists, and
persons who have expressed
views sympathetic to the Arabs.
Violates act
Aramco, by stating that the
"ability to obtain a visa" is a
condition for employment, is
aware of Saudi Arabia's dis
criminatory practices.
Its hiring policy in the United
States therefore violates Title
VII, 62000e-2, of the 1964 Civil
Rights Aet, which states: "(a) It
shall be an unlawful employ
ment practice for an employer
— to fail or refuse to hire or to
discharge any individual, or
otherwise to discriminate
against any individual with re
spect to his compensation,
terms, conditions, or privileges
of employment, because of such
individual's color, relig
ion, sex, or national origin;
—to limit, segregate, or clas
sify his employees or applicants
for employment in any way
which would deprive or tend to
deprive any individual of
employment opportunities or
otherwise adversely affect his
status as an employee, because

of such individual's race, color,
religion, sex, or national ori
gin."
Documentation
Below are just a few
documented instances of Saudi
discriminatory entrance prac
tices:
From the New York Times
May 11, 1975; "Negotiations
toward a technical assistance
contract between the Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy (MIT) and Saudi Arabia
have broken down in a disag
reement over a guarantee for the
entry of Jews to work on the pro
ject."
From the Washington Post,
July 2, 1975: "Five Midwestern
universities have suspended
work on a project for Saudi
Arabia's University of Riyadh
after a Michigan State Univer
sity dean, who is Jewish, was
told he wouldn't get a visa from
the Saudi Government."
McGraw Associates, a Florida
firm with contracts for construc
tion work in Saudi Arabia,
placed a newspaper want ad for
skilled workers which
explicitly states: "We trust you
are aware of the discrimination
policies of the Arab world be
fore replying to this ad."
Complaint filed
A discriminatory practices
complaint against the Hospital
Corporation of America has
been filed with the Federal
Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission.
The corporation, by asking
for religious identification, sc
reens out Jewish applicants for
jobs in a Saudi Arabian hospital
with which it has a contract to
recruit personnel.
The U.S. Army Corps of En
gineers has not assigned Jewish
military personnel or Jewish
civilians to work in Saudi
Arabia. The Defense Depart
ment now claims that it no
longer directly screens out Jews
for the Saudi Government.
However, the department
concedes that Saudi Arabia still
refuses to grant visas to Jews.
Evidence exists that the Corps
requires religious identification
certificates from personnel
going to Saudi Arabia, which it

then submits to the Saudi Gov
ernment.
From the New York Times,
May 11, 1975: "The oil com
panies that form part of the Ara
bian American Oil Com
pany . . . and major contractors
in defense work (in Saudi
Arabia) such as Raytheon,
Lockheed, Northrop Aviation
and others do not recruit
American Jews for work in this

Corporation of America has
been filed with the Federal
Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission.
The corporation, by asking
for religious identification, sc
reens out Jewish applicants for
jobs in a Saudi Arabian hospital
with which it has a contract to
recruit personnel.
The U.S. Army Corps of En
gineers has not assigned Jewish
military personnel or Jewish
civilians to work in Saudi
Arabia. The Defense Depart
ment now claims that it no
longer directly screens out Jews
for the Saudi Government.
However, the department
concedes that Saudi Arabia still
refuses to grant visas to Jews.
Evidence exists that the Corps
requires religious identification
certificates from personnel
going to Saudi Arabia, which it

then submits to the Saudi Gov
ernment.
From the New York Times,
May 11, 1975: "The oil com
panies that form part of the Ara
bian American Oil Com
pany . . . and major contractors
in defense work (in Saudi
Arabia) such as Raytheon,
Lockheed, Northrop Aviation
and others do not recruit
American Jews for work in this
Moslem country."
Concern has not only been ex
pressed regarding Saudi Arabia
practices toward Jews, but also
against women and blacks. The
MIT spokesman, in announcing
the talks breakdown discussed
above, said, "We were con
cerned not only about religion,
but also sex."
Moreover, California Gov.
Edmund Brown, Jr., announced
last November that he had or
dered suspension of contract
negotiations between the
California Department of
Transportation and Saudi
Arabia due to evidence of a
Saudi ban against blacks, wo
men and Jews who would be
working on the proposed pro
ject.
We are certain no member of
the Stanford community would
want to be part of an agreement
which discriminates against
any American, for reason of re
ligion, race or sex.
We therefore urge the Daily
not to accept future ads from
Aramco or any other company
whose hiring practices are so
blatantly discriminatory. We
also recommend that, if such
ads are run, members of the
Stanford community not re
spond to them.

We are greatly disturbed by
the half-page advertisements
run in the Daily last quarter by
the Arabian American Oil Com
pany (Aramco). The ads, stat
ing, "Industrial Engineers,
Aramco has plans for you in
Saudi Arabia," neglected to
mention the company's dis
criminatory hiring policies for
work in Saudi Arabia.
Aramco, one of the world's
largest petroleum production
companies, is headquartered in
Houston, Tex., and operates in
Saudi Arabia. Its employment
application states that a condi
tion precedent to employment is
the "ability to obtain a visa from
the Saudi Arabian Govern
ment."
Under Saudi law, applicants
for visas to enter Saudi Arabia
must state their religion and
must product a certificate of
baptism. A Saudi consulate
must receive explicit authoriza
tion from the foreign ministry
before a Jew is issued a visa.
By use of this practice, Jews
have been almost totally barred
from entering the country since
1948. The only exceptions
which have been made have

been for some members of con
gressional committee staffs,
some American journalists, and
persons who have expressed
views sympathetic to the Arabs.
Violates act
Aramco, by stating that the
"ability to obtain a visa" is a
condition for employment, is
aware of Saudi Arabia's dis
criminatory practices.
Its hiring policy in the United
States therefore violates Title
VII, 62000e-2, of the 1964 Civil
Rights Aet, which states: "(a) It
shall be an unlawful employ
ment practice for an employer
— to fail or refuse to hire or to
discharge any individual, or
otherwise to discriminate
against any individual with re
spect to his compensation,
terms, conditions, or privileges
of employment, because of such
individual's color, relig
ion, sex, or national origin;
—to limit, segregate, or clas
sify his employees or applicants
for employment in any way
which would deprive or tend to
deprive any individual of
employment opportunities or
otherwise adversely affect his
status as an employee, because

of such individual's race, color,
religion, sex, or national ori
gin."
Documentation
Below are just a few
documented instances of Saudi
discriminatory entrance prac
tices:
From the New York Times
May 11, 1975; "Negotiations
toward a technical assistance
contract between the Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy (MIT) and Saudi Arabia
have broken down in a disag
reement over a guarantee for the
entry of Jews to work on the pro
ject."
From the Washington Post,
July 2, 1975: "Five Midwestern
universities have suspended
work on a project for Saudi
Arabia's University of Riyadh
after a Michigan State Univer
sity dean, who is Jewish, was
told he wouldn't get a visa from
the Saudi Government."
McGraw Associates, a Florida
firm with contracts for construc
tion work in Saudi Arabia,
placed a newspaper want ad for
skilled workers which
explicitly states: "We trust you
are aware of the discrimination
policies of the Arab world be
fore replying to this ad."
