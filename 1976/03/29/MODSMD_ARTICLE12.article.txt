Save the trees
Some of us are so deeply con
cerned about the apparent suic
idal race to mutual destruction
by the big powers that we may
overlook circumstances nearer
home that affect the quality of
our lives.
An example is the Palo Alto
City Council's approval of a
plan to widen the western end of
Willow Road and make an exit
at El Camino.
Those of us who live in Menlo
Park just across San Francis
quito Creek from the Stanford
Shopping Center are partially
shielded from the stores by the
grove of trees on the Stanford
side.
This grove was part of the old
Leland Stanford home and
along its central winding (now
deteriorating) roadway Gov.
and Mrs. Stanford rode in their
fine horse-drawn carriages.
Today it is used as a park by
people who enjoy walking or
just sitting on the ground under
a tree listening to the birds sing
ing and the squirrels chattering.
Present plans call for cutting
down some of the beautiful his
toric trees. Granted that the pre
sent western section of Willow
Road is a bottleneck in rush
hours, cannot some other way
be found than cutting the trees?
Take the space from the park
ing lots. Follow the Palo Alto
Planning Commission's re
commendation of exiting at
Quarry Road, slanting north
ward sufficiently to avoid the
underpass. Stagger work and
office hours. Encourage car
pools, more bus and bicycle rid
ing.
"Only God can make a tree."
Can't man make anything but
pavements and gasoline fueled,
smog producing autos?

Hearst defense
The major premise of Bob
Rowen's column in the Mar. 3
Daily was factually inaccurate.
Rowen wrote that the Hearst de
fense was brainwashing when
before an audience of 500 at
Stanford, attorney F. Lee Bailey
carefully explained that he was
defending on the basic of coer
cive persuasion, a defense ac
cepted in military jurispru
dence.
Furthermore Rowen showed
a remarkable tenacity in ignor
ing some major tenets of Ameri
can criminal law. First, a guilty
state of mind is a prerequisite to
criminality, and it is entirely
possible and probable that two
persons commiting similar
crimes would have different de
grees of criminality attached to
their conduct.
Also, reasonableness stan
dards of conduct are interwoven
in the system to screen out the
abuses that Rowen foresees in
brainwashing logic.
