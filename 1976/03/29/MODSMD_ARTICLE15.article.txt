# Wanted: ideas to manage
## 
### Randy Block 
The Office of Technology
Licensing (OTL) here helps de
velop the ideas of Stanford's in
ventors into useful concepts and
products.
The office, under the di rection
ot Niels Reimers, receives the
results of scientific and
technological research by both
professors and students. It ar
ranges patent applications for
some of the inventions.
OTL also performs marketing
surveys to determine which in
ventions might be produced
commercially and licenses in
dustrial ti rms to manufacture
them.
Reimers has managed OTL
since its inception in 1970. Be
fore then, patent and license
management was done by Re
search Corporation of New
York, a non-profit foundation.
The arrangement was neither
useful nor profitable to Stan
lord. Few proposals were sub
mitted, and the proceeds were
negligible.
Since 1970, OTL has earned
$746,000 in gross revenues for
the I Jniversity. This year's earn
ings alone will be about
$2H0,000, and Reimers expects
the office to receive about
$350,000 next year.
The office has been successful
in spite of the fact that none of
the inventions it has processed
has shown great commercial po
tential.
Examples of such "big hits"
scored by other schools are
stannous fluoride, developed at
Indiana University; OatorAde,
invented at Florida State; a
method of producing penicillin
perfected at MIT; and the to

mato harvester developed by the
University of California. Reim
ers anticipates a "big hit" at
Stanford in the near future —
although he would not specu
late on what it will be.
Legally, all inventions by
University faculty using the
University's facilities and done
on University time could be
claimed by the University as its

own property. Under such an
arrangement it would receive
all royalties from the invention.
Stanford has chosen not to fol
low this strategy. Scientists here
are free of University controls
on their inventions and may do
as they please with them. This
policy has attracted many scien
tists, such as Felix Bloch, Carl
Djerassi and William Johnson.

ventors into useful concepts and
products.
The office, under the di rection
ot Niels Reimers, receives the
results of scientific and
technological research by both
professors and students. It ar
ranges patent applications for
some of the inventions.
OTL also performs marketing
surveys to determine which in
ventions might be produced
commercially and licenses in
dustrial ti rms to manufacture
them.
Reimers has managed OTL
since its inception in 1970. Be
fore then, patent and license
management was done by Re
search Corporation of New
York, a non-profit foundation.
The arrangement was neither
useful nor profitable to Stan
lord. Few proposals were sub
mitted, and the proceeds were
negligible.
Since 1970, OTL has earned
$746,000 in gross revenues for
the I Jniversity. This year's earn
ings alone will be about
$2H0,000, and Reimers expects
the office to receive about
$350,000 next year.
The office has been successful
in spite of the fact that none of
the inventions it has processed
has shown great commercial po
tential.
Examples of such "big hits"
scored by other schools are
stannous fluoride, developed at
Indiana University; OatorAde,
invented at Florida State; a
method of producing penicillin
perfected at MIT; and the to

mato harvester developed by the
University of California. Reim
ers anticipates a "big hit" at
Stanford in the near future —
although he would not specu
late on what it will be.
Legally, all inventions by
University faculty using the
University's facilities and done
on University time could be
claimed by the University as its

own property. Under such an
arrangement it would receive
all royalties from the invention.
Stanford has chosen not to fol
low this strategy. Scientists here
are free of University controls
on their inventions and may do
as they please with them. This
policy has attracted many scien
tists, such as Felix Bloch, Carl
Djerassi and William Johnson.

MAKE IT HAPPEN — Niels Reimers, director of the Office of Technology Licensing, points out his
motto posted on his office door. His division has helped "make it happen" for ideas for nearly six
years.
