# Profs develop plan to make nuclear power generating safer

Many of the problems as
sociated with nuclear electrical
generation may be solved by a
new process developed here.
Robert Anderson and Nor
man Parlee of the Applied Earth
Sciences Department devised
the process, which involves the
use of liquid metal (such as tin)
for the treatment of radioactive
waste materials produced by
uranium-235 fission.
Anderson said his method is
superior to the usual water
based treatment procedure be
cause:
—it more efficiently separates
reusable plutonium from waste;
—it avoids the problem of
water used for treatment break
ing down into hydrogen and
oxygen;
—it provides for on-site waste
treatment and disposal, remov
ing waste products while fuel
rods are still in place generating
energy; and
—it is less vulnerable to
sabotage, because an explosive

device dropped in a liquid metal
pool containing dissolved
plutonium will produce a
shower of quickly cooled and
solidified metal droplets far less
likely to scatter in the wind than
would droplets produced by a
similar occurence in a tank of
water containing plutonium.
Until now, the process has
only been employed on a small
scale with depleted, non
radioactive surrogate waste
materials, Anderson said. He
now must find government or
corporate funding for large
scale testing, but has had little
success, he added.
"Industry says it's the respon
sibility of government and gov
ernment says it's the responsi
bility ol industry," Anderson
lamented.
Terry Lash, a staff scientist at
the Natural Resources Defense
Council in Palo Alto, said he
thinks "Anderson has an in
teresting proposal which, if
proved out, will be superior to

the purex (water-based
techniques now used)."
Lash emphasized, however,
that Anderson's work so far has
"only been done on a laboratory
scale with non-radioactive
materials, and so it's far from
being proven."
