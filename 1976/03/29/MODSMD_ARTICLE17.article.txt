# Infant 'symbolizes' AIM struggle
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (PNS) — A
10-week-old native American
infant has become, for many, the
latest and most moving symbol
of the continuing struggles and
frustrations of her people. She is
the daughter of American In
dian Movement (AIM) leader
Dennis Banks, a Chippewa, and
his wife Ka-mook, an Oglala
Sioux.
The child's name, bestowed
by a medicine man before her
birth, is Iron Door Woman.
In a recent speech to the
People's Temple Christian
Church here, Banks, 42, said he
prefers to be known as the father
of Iron Door Woman rather than
as the leader of AIM and a vete
ran of Wounded Knee. His
daughter's name, he said, sym
bolizes more powerfully than
anything else the current plight
of his people.
Banks spoke of the baby's
birth while her mother was in a
Kansas prison awaiting trial on
a charge of firearms possession.
I le told how a lack of bail money
for Ka-mook had forced the sep
aration of mother and infant just
days after the birth.
Nonviolent leader
The congregation, led by Jim
Jones, was visibly moved. Al
most equally divided between
whites and non-whites, many of
them regard Banks as akin to
Martin I.uther King and Cesar

Chavez — another nonviolent
voice for the rights of oppressed
people.
So, at a meeting following the
speech, the congregation voted
unanimously to put up $19,000
of its education fund — which is
helping 100 members through
school — as bond for Ka-mook.
A week later, Banks was reun
ited with his wife and new
daughter.
In an interview, Ka-mook, 21,
told how she awaited the baby's
birth in solitary confinement in
Wichita. Her diet consisted of
the standard jail fare of cold
cereal, goulash, balogna
sandwiches and fruit drinks.
A cup of milk
A physician had advised lots
of milk, she said, but only half a
pint a day was shoved through a
small window in her iron door.
She saw no sunlight, breathed
no fresh air.
She explained that it is cus
tomary among Pine Ridge res
idents to have a medicine man
name a baby shortly after birth
during a ceremony that includes
a feast and give-away. Ka-mook
knew that would be impossible
for her, so she asked her grand
mother to hold the ceremony be
fore the birth.
"They had it Christmas Eve,"
she said. "They knew she'd be a
girl. So when she was born, she
had her name already."
The baby was born by Caesa
rian section at Wesley Memorial
Hospital in Wichita. "I still
thought I might get out on bail,"
recalled Ka-mook, "so I started
to nurse her. But after two days I
gave it up because I knew I
wasn't going anywhere."
Back to jail
An aunt from Oklahoma ar
rived to take the infant, to care
for her along with the Banks'
18-month old daughter,
Tashina. Ka-mook returned to
her jail cell.
Now, finally reunited in San

Francisco, Dennis Banks hold
his daughter Iron Door Woman
high over the pulpit at the
People's Temple and told the
late night assembly, "Your love
has moved the iron doors."
But tor the 10-week-old child,
other barred doors loom in the
near future. Her mother faces
trial in Kansas and in Oregon on
charges of possession of
firearms. Iler father is wanted
for sentencing in South Dakota
on a conviction of being armed
with a dangerous weapon dur
ing a riot. (He had picked up <i
police club from the ground dur
ing a demonstration in Custer in

I It: is <dso charged in the
firearms case in Oregon with
Ka-mook.
Despite the charges, both pa
rents say they're optimistic. "I
think it will turn out all right,
thecaseand all,"saysKa-mook.
It so, she said, she and her
husband and the children may
one day return fo a place they
discovered very far north,
"where the Northern Lights are
south of you." There, in <i com
munity where the men and
women live off caribou, make
clothing from hides and have no
electricity or telephones, Iron
Door Woman may £>row up.
