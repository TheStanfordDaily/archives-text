# USE, University meet today to break ground for contract talks
## 
### Mark Simonian 
University representatives and United Stanford
Employees (USE) union officials will meet today at
3 p.m. for preliminary contract talks.
USE represents approximately 1400 technical,
maintenance and service personnel. The union's
current contract expires August 31. Union mem
bers walked off their jobs in May 1974, for three
weeks before the current contract was adopted.
Chief University negotiator Doug Barton and
USE President Jim Berk both said in interviews
yesterday they expected today's meeting would be
the first in a series of informal, groundbreaking
sessions. No substantive decisions are expected.
Berk said the union will seek information on
changes in the union's benefit plans. University
layoff procedures and supervisor arrangements.
'Major changes'
"There have got to be major changes (in the new
contract)," Berk said, adding that he wants to "get

the negotiations going right away," possibly as
soon as late April.
Barton said the University is waiting to receive
formal written proposals from the union. He
suggested June as the earliest the negotiations
could begin.
"Late April is news to me," he responded, ad
ding that the University would need time to "con
sider carefully" the union's contract proposals
after receiving them.
Declining to speculate on what the union would
propose, Barton singled out the area of grievance
procedures as one he expected discussion on dur
ing the preliminary meetings.
"It's no secret that the procedure has not been
successful in resolving the disputes amicably short
of arbitration," he said.
Gaining information
Berk said he would concentrate on gaining in
formation on the University's contractural rela

tions with outside firms providing benefit plans,
including University worker pension plans and
life insurance, medical and automobile insurance
plans.
The USE negotiating team includes Berk, USE
Vice President William Reynolds, USE employe
Beverly Loyo, Plant Services operator Roger
Hardy, laboratory technician Sandra Scaling,
maintenance electrician Jeannot Lauer and SLAC
technician Damir Ibrisimovic.
The University team includes Barton, SLAC per
sonnel director Dougjas Dupen, employe relations
manager Robert Parker, employe relations rep

The University has also established a negotia
tions policy committee headed by Robert Au

ness and finance.
