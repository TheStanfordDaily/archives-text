# Thais to vote Sunday
## 
### 
BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) —
Thailand goes into general elec
tions next Sunday amid grow
ing tensions between the left and
right, talk of a resurgence of the
military which ran the nation
before and uncertainty on how
to deal with communist gov
ernments in neighboring In
dochina.
Newspaper editors. Western
diplomats, foreign businessmen
and Thai officials themselves

predict that the elections will
bring in a relatively conserva
tive but a not very stable gov
ernment.
The National Institute for the
Development of Public Ad
ministration took a sampling
last month of 2200 voters and
found that the present caretaker
premier. Kukrit Pramoj, was fa
vored by them to retain his job.
The government will almost
inevitably be made up of a coali
tion of several parties, as was
the previous one. Politicians are
speculating whether Kukrit or
anyone else will be able to hold
such factions together while
moving ahead with social and
economic reforms and better de
fined foreign policy.
Meanwhile, one of the most
violent and candidate-filled
election campaigns in Thai his
tory is being waged.
About 25 persons related to
the campaign have been killed,
with clear indications that at
least some of the violence was a
product of the clash of rightist
and leftist forces.
The race features 39 of 56
political parties fielding 2370
candidates — more than eight
for each of the 269 seats in the
House of Representatives of the
National Assembly from which
the future government will be
chosen.
Candidates include profes
sors, village chiefs, entertain
ment celebrities, former gener

als, veteran politicians and mil
lionai res.
One issue in the elections —
the second in 14 months — is the
recent government decision to
have all but 270 U.S. military
personnel withdrawn from the
country.
Other issues are the com
munist insurgency, which has
recently led the government to
extend a state of emergency in
28 of the country's 71 provinces,
and continued criticism from
North Vietnam and Laos.
kukrit has urged Thailand's
21 million eligible voters to cast
their votes for a party and not a
personality in order to create a
more stable government than
the one he led until Jan. 12.
when he dissolved the House of
Representatives and called for
new elections in an effort to
eliminate growing political
fragmentation.
In the last general elections,
no single party gained a clear
majority. Seni Pramoj, Kukrit's
older brother, whose Democrat
party ran first with 62 seats,
formed a government which
lasted only eight days. Kukrit.
whose Social Action party ran
fifth, was called on to form a
17-party coalition.
Political observers say a coali
tion of Kukrit's party, the right
ist, military-backed Thai Nation
party and several other conser
vative groups might result from
Sunday's balloting.

the second in 14 months — is the
recent government decision to
have all but 270 U.S. military
personnel withdrawn from the
country.
Other issues are the com
munist insurgency, which has
recently led the government to
extend a state of emergency in
28 of the country's 71 provinces,
and continued criticism from
North Vietnam and Laos.
kukrit has urged Thailand's
21 million eligible voters to cast
their votes for a party and not a
personality in order to create a
more stable government than
the one he led until Jan. 12.
when he dissolved the House of
Representatives and called for
new elections in an effort to
eliminate growing political
fragmentation.
In the last general elections,
no single party gained a clear
majority. Seni Pramoj, Kukrit's
older brother, whose Democrat
party ran first with 62 seats,
formed a government which
lasted only eight days. Kukrit.
whose Social Action party ran
fifth, was called on to form a
17-party coalition.
Political observers say a coali
tion of Kukrit's party, the right
ist, military-backed Thai Nation
party and several other conser
vative groups might result from
Sunday's balloting.
BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) —
Thailand goes into general elec
tions next Sunday amid grow
ing tensions between the left and
right, talk of a resurgence of the
military which ran the nation
before and uncertainty on how
to deal with communist gov
ernments in neighboring In
dochina.
Newspaper editors. Western
diplomats, foreign businessmen
and Thai officials themselves

predict that the elections will
bring in a relatively conserva
tive but a not very stable gov
ernment.
The National Institute for the
Development of Public Ad
ministration took a sampling
last month of 2200 voters and
found that the present caretaker
premier. Kukrit Pramoj, was fa
vored by them to retain his job.
The government will almost
inevitably be made up of a coali
tion of several parties, as was
the previous one. Politicians are
speculating whether Kukrit or
anyone else will be able to hold
such factions together while
moving ahead with social and
economic reforms and better de
fined foreign policy.
Meanwhile, one of the most
violent and candidate-filled
election campaigns in Thai his
tory is being waged.
About 25 persons related to
the campaign have been killed,
with clear indications that at
least some of the violence was a
product of the clash of rightist
and leftist forces.
The race features 39 of 56
political parties fielding 2370
candidates — more than eight
for each of the 269 seats in the
House of Representatives of the
National Assembly from which
the future government will be
chosen.
Candidates include profes
sors, village chiefs, entertain
ment celebrities, former gener

als, veteran politicians and mil
lionai res.
