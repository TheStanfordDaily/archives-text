CAIRO (AP) â€” Betting heav
ily on the West after turning his
back on the Soviet Union, Egyp
tian President Anwar Sadat be
gins a European tour today in
search of money, arms and
political support.
Before departing on a 15-day
swing through West Germany,
France, Italy, Austria and
Yugoslavia, the Egyptian leader
confirmed in an interview that
the Soviet fleet no longer would
be able to use the Alexandria
naval base for refitting and re
creation stops.
This was the last remaining
naval support facility open to
the Soviets on Egypt's Mediter
ranean coast.
He also described the prop
osed American sale to Egypt of
six Cl3O transport planes as a
"very small thing" and said he
had "the right to ask for defen
sive weapons" such as jet fight
ers, antitank weapons and other
equipment now that supplies
from the Soviets have dried up.
Diplomatic observers believe
that Sadat's clarification of the
status of Soviet naval facilities
after his March 14 abrogation of
a 15-year treaty of cooperation
and friendship with the Rus
sians and his expressed interest
in additional U.S. weapons
were clear signals he n"w ex
pects much from the Wesi.
The sources added that Sadat
was likely to be disappointed
because the United States was
preoccupied by an election
campaign.
