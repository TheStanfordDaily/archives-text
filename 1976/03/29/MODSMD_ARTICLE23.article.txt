## Women third, men 10th in swimming nationals Women's relay betters mark 
### Jill Lieber 
The Stanford swim team
placed third in the Association
of Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women Swimming and Diving
Championships held March
18-20 at the University of Miami
in Coral Cables, Fla. The Uni
versity of Miami took the team
championship with 435 points.
UCLA was second with 381,
while Stanford was close behind
with 377.
Stanford did not have any
women who placed first, but the
team's depth in winning other
places that earned points added
to the total team score and car
ried them to within four points
of pre-meet favorite UCLA.
The top finisher for Stanford
was the 200 medley relay team,
which was second in 1:48.6,
thus bettering the American re
cord for the event. The team was
comprised of Vicki Hays, Leslie
Crozier, Barb Bacon and Rose
Storm.
'Swam their minds out'
Coach Jim Caughran was
very excited about the team's
performance. "The girls just
swam their minds out," he said.
"We have nine freshmen and a
lot of people that no one knows,
but we almost beat UCLA with
all their Olympic swimmers."
Junior Vicki Hays, whom
Caughran described as an "iron
woman performer," led the
Cards by placing in seven
events. Of those seven, Hays
placed in five individual events
(the 50, 100 and 200
breaststrokes and the 100 and
200 IMs) plus two team events
(the 200 and 400 freestyle re
lays).

Margot Hagstette, a freshman
competing in her first national
collegiate championship,
placed in three individual
events and one relay.
Edged out
Rose Storm, also a freshman,
came the closest of any Card
swimmer to capturing a first
place, but was touched out in the
50 free by one one-hundredth of
a second.
Middle distance swimmers
Anne Brodell and Jo Harsh
barger both placed in the 200
and 500 free. Harshbarger, a
1972 Olympian and 1650 free
American record holder, is pre
dicted to outclass her com
petitors next year when the 1650
free is installed as one of the
women's collegiate events.
In diving competition,
freshman Ann Carey placed
33rd in a field of 90 divers in the
one-meter event and finished
47th of 90 in the three-meter
competition.
Missed cut
Carey missed the cut for the
one-meter finals by one-tenth of
a point as only the top 32 divers
qualified for further diving
competition.
Rick Schavone, an assistant
diving coach, remarked that
Carey was poised. "She dove
tremendously," he said. "She
beat a lot of good divers."
All the women swimmers who
earned points at the champion
ships will return next year,
therefore Caughran is both op
timistic and excited about the
women's future. "We're a very
young team so we're going to get
better and better."

events. Of those seven, Hays
placed in five individual events
(the 50, 100 and 200
breaststrokes and the 100 and
200 IMs) plus two team events
(the 200 and 400 freestyle re
lays).

Margot Hagstette, a freshman
competing in her first national
collegiate championship,
placed in three individual
events and one relay.
Edged out
Rose Storm, also a freshman,
came the closest of any Card
swimmer to capturing a first
place, but was touched out in the
50 free by one one-hundredth of
a second.
Middle distance swimmers
Anne Brodell and Jo Harsh
barger both placed in the 200
and 500 free. Harshbarger, a
1972 Olympian and 1650 free
American record holder, is pre
dicted to outclass her com
petitors next year when the 1650
free is installed as one of the
women's collegiate events.
In diving competition,
freshman Ann Carey placed
33rd in a field of 90 divers in the
one-meter event and finished
47th of 90 in the three-meter
competition.
Missed cut
Carey missed the cut for the
one-meter finals by one-tenth of
a point as only the top 32 divers
qualified for further diving
competition.
Rick Schavone, an assistant
diving coach, remarked that
Carey was poised. "She dove
tremendously," he said. "She
beat a lot of good divers."
All the women swimmers who
earned points at the champion
ships will return next year,
therefore Caughran is both op
timistic and excited about the
women's future. "We're a very
young team so we're going to get
better and better."

THRILL OF VICTORY OR AGONY OF DEFEAT? — Three-time All-American John Hencken placed
first in the 100-yard breaststroke but came in second in the 200-yard breast in the NCAA Champion
ships last weekend. Hencken, a senior, finished his collegiate swimming career with five individual
NCAA gold medals.
The Stanford swim team
placed third in the Association
of Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women Swimming and Diving
Championships held March
18-20 at the University of Miami
in Coral Cables, Fla. The Uni
versity of Miami took the team
championship with 435 points.
UCLA was second with 381,
while Stanford was close behind
with 377.
Stanford did not have any
women who placed first, but the
team's depth in winning other
places that earned points added
to the total team score and car
ried them to within four points
of pre-meet favorite UCLA.
The top finisher for Stanford
was the 200 medley relay team,
which was second in 1:48.6,
thus bettering the American re
cord for the event. The team was
comprised of Vicki Hays, Leslie
Crozier, Barb Bacon and Rose
Storm.
'Swam their minds out'
Coach Jim Caughran was
very excited about the team's
performance. "The girls just
swam their minds out," he said.
"We have nine freshmen and a
lot of people that no one knows,
but we almost beat UCLA with
all their Olympic swimmers."
Junior Vicki Hays, whom
Caughran described as an "iron
woman performer," led the
Cards by placing in seven
events. Of those seven, Hays
placed in five individual events
