# Hencken strokes to fifth title

Stanford's varsity swimming
squad could only amass indi
vidual victories en route to its 64
point total and 10th place finish
at the NCAA Swimming and Di
ving championships last
weekend at Brown University.
USC took its third straight team
title as a powerful Trojan team
totaled 398 points, a 161 point
margin over Tennessee, its
nearest competitor.
It didn't take long for coach
|im Gaughran to realize that the
Cards might not improve upon
their sixth place finish of a year
ago.
One of the many surprises
that the championships were to
hold in store for Stanford came
on the second day of competi
tion as John Hencken, defending
champion in the 100 and 200-
yard hreaststroke events, was
edged by Syracuse's Jeff Noury
in a 100-hreast heat and was
upset by David YVilkie of Miami
in the 200-breast final.
Bounces hack
The senior Ail-American did
come back, however, with a
blazing 56.04 in the finals of the
100-breast to repeat as champ
ion. Teammate Stu Corliss
finished 11th in the 100-yard
breaststroke consolation in
58.4.
Without the aid of Mike
Bruner, who is training for the
Olympics, the Cards did not
score well in the freestyle
events.
Dave Fairbank matched his
last year's second place perfor
mance in the 50-yard freestyle
as his 20.47 placed him behind
USC's Joe Bottom, who won in
20.08.
Freestyle worries
The Cardinals freestyle wor
ries were then compounded by
an ailing Craig Van Zandt,
whom Gaughran was relying on
for team points. Van Zandt did
come through, however, with
24th place in the 200-yard frees
tyle with a 1:40.96 clocking.

In the remaining events, Stan
ford could only augment its ear
lier performances little by little.
In what might appear to be a
rather uneventful 64 points, the
Cards did have some«xcitement
from backstroker John Con
nelly.
According to Gaughran, very
little was expected from the
backstroke contingent, espe
cially with the power of the USC
backstrokers. Connelly did
manage, however, to finish
22nd in the 100-yard backstroke
in 53.61.
Butterfliers fly
The butterfliers turned in a
significant performance as both
Sam Franklin and Brian Roux
finished in the top 22 in the
100-yard butterfly. Franklin's
50.47 earned him 20th place in
the 100-fly while Roux was close
behind in 22nd in 50.66.
The Cardinals' 800-yard;
freestyle relay squad was the
only one to finish in a point
worthy place as Stanford
finished 26th with a time of
6:55.6.
Next year
For the Cardinals, the NCAA
championships proved to coach
Gaughran that, if nothing!
else, Stanford has a lot of fine
individuals such as backstroker
Connelly to build upon for next
year.
Even though the season is now
over for Stanford, many Card
swimmers will be continuing to
push themselves this coming
week. The AAU championships
next weekend at Belmont Fools
in Long Beach marks the last
chance for many Stanford
swimmers. The meet is the final
opportunity to qualify for the
1976 Olympics.
