"They just keep amazing me,"
said coach Ray Young after his

out eight.

mance," said Young. "This was
his first complete game since he
beat Southern Methodist last
year in the Tournament."
BYU scored both of its runs in
the fourth inning on a single and
a wild pitch.

rally with a double to left to
open the 10th frame. Davis
moved to third on Cuardino's
ground out and scored when
Pepe Hinojosa cracked a double.

run later in the inning, when
