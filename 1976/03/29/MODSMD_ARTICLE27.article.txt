# Card mile relay highlights meet
## Spikers shine in Stanford Relays 
### Bruce Anderson 
Like a classic fairy tale, the
best part of the Stanford Relays
Saturday, March 20 was the en
ding.
Concluding a meet
punctuated by new records and
Coppertone weather, the last
event, the mile relay, brought
the congregation of track and
field fans to its feet and left them

talking in superlatives as they
left Stanford Stadium having
witnessed an outstanding meet
in all respects.
Although California set a
meet record and Stanford re
corded its third fastest time ever
in the mile relay, it was the blis
tering last lap of Stanford's
James Lofton and Berkeley's

lames Robinson that those pre
sent will remember most.
Strong leg
Lofton came from way back to
draw even with Robinson for a
short while before the Cal sprint
star pulled away to cross the
tape at 3:09.9, nearly three sec
onds better than the meet record
set by the Colder. l Bears last
year.
Lofton finished with a 46.8
anchor lap to give the team of
Scott Wingo, Alan Sheats, Matt
Hogsett and Lofton a time of
3:10.8. Their clocking was just
shy of the Stanford mile relay
record of 3:10.5, held jointly by
the teams of Shaw, Williamson,
Clark and Jeffrey (1940) and
Fredrickson, Rubin, Mclntyre
and Fraser (1965).
Lofton and Robinson were
named Northern California
University Division Track and
Field performers of the week for
their showings at the relays.
And Lofton's efforts were not
limited to his quarter of the mile
relay.
Long jump victory
The sophomore from Los
Angeles began the day by win
ning the long jump,breaking his
own meet record with a leap of
24 feet, H :, /» inches. He later ran
the second leg for the Cardinals
in the 400-meter relay, guiding
Stanford to a dead heat finish
with San Jose State. The sprint
crew of Marvin Holmes, John
Foster. Sheats and Lofton will
share the meet mark 0f40.7 with
San Jose.
Before finishing the day in the
mile relay, Lofton also managed
to turn in an outstanding leg in
the 880-yard relay before the
Cardinals dropped the baton
and were disqualified.
The relays, which Stanford
had sponsored annually for a
long period before they were
discontinued, were reinstituted
last year. Last spring they were
marred by rainy weather, which
hampered both performances
and attendance.
But this year the weather was
ideal. Excellent marks
flourished throughout the day
and roughly 8500 sports fans
left the televised NCAA regional
basketball finals at home to
come to the meet.
'Bright light'
Stanford track coach Payton
Jordan was "very pleased" with
the whole track meet. He was
also pleased with Lofton, whom
the coach saw as "the bright
light" of the meet.
But there were many other
noteworthy efforts and Jordan
pointed out that "there was no
race today which was not com
petitive." He could as easily
have said the same about the
field events in which new meet
records were set in each event.
San Jose State made the
weight events a display case for
Spartans RonSemkiw and Mi ke

Weeks. Semkiw broke Weeks'
meet record in the shot put by
nearly nine feet with a toss of
64-s'/2, while Weeks settled for
runner-up with a 62-9 put.
Turns the tables
Hut Weeks turned the tables in
the discus when he hurled it
182-4, more than 20 feet better
than the previous meet record.
This time Semkiw took the back
seat as his toss of 167-5 was good
for second place. Stanford's
Mark Hill took third with a per
sonal best of 166-2.
San lose showed strength in
the other field events as well,
Don Finley winning the tripple
jump, 49-6'/2, and Dave Krough
capturing the javelin with a
throw of 217-7. The Cardinals'
John Macrorie placed second in
the javelin with a 212-1 fling.
Hayward State captured the
remaining field events as Dave
Haber high jumped 6-10, Darrel
Robinson vaulted 16-0 and Don
Dyer threw the hammer 177-9.
Although Lofton was Stan
ford's only winner in the field
events, the Cardinals thrived in
the open running events.
Long distance winner
Stanford senior Jack Bellah
bested the 10,000 moter field
with a time of 30:41.2 while
freshman teammate Roy Kissin
was second in 30:55.8.
Junior Marvin Holmes edged
Berkeley's Paul Wallace and
Hayward State's Ray Clark to
win the 100 meter dash in 10.8.
Stanford's Anthony Sandoval
won the Bowden/Cunliffe Mile,
in 4:11.9 and beat the former
meet record holder, Rusty
Nahirney of San Jose State, with
a kick that took Nahirney com
pletely by surprise. In a 2-mile
relay, Sandoval turned in a 1:52
split the best half-mile of any
Cardinal this season.
Palo Alto's Carl Florant, late
of Berkeley, smoked the 110
meter high hurdle field with a
13.8 time. Stanford's John Fos
ter finished second in 14.1.
Double dual meet
The Cards travel to Southern
California this weekend for a
double dual meet which pits
Stanford against powerhouse
USC, while Cal faces UCLA.
Coach Jordan says that the
Cards will be "scrambling for
points and making the best with
what we've got. We will go
down with the idea of being
competitive."
That's about all Stanford can
hope to do. be competitive. The
Trojans have won 25 NCAA
track and field championships
and have won the last 39 dual
meets with Stanford.
Track Notes: The Cards will
vie against UCLA on April 17 in
a double dual meet at Stanford
Stadium. California will take on
USC. The double dual is the only
remaining home meet on this
season's schedule for the Stan
ford spikers.
