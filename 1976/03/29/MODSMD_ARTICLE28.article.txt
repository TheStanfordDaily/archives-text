### 
PALM SPRINGS. Calif. (AP)
â€”jimmy Connors defeated
Stanford grad Roscoe Tanner
6-4, 6-4 yesterday to capture
first prize money of $35,000 in
the $200,000 Tennis Games at
Mission Hills Country Club.
Tanner had defeated Arthur
Ashe, the world's top-ranked
player, to advance to the finals
against Connors.
The match was played in
winds gusting up to4o miles per
hour, which caused both Con
nors and Tanner to play cauti
ously and also made it difficult
for the linesmen to make their
calls.
Several times during the
match the players questioned
the judgment of a service lines
man until Referee Charles Hare
of Chicago and chair umpire
Harry Maiden of Los Angeles
conferred in the second set and
ruled the linesman be allowed to
stay.

The situation seemed to dis
til rb Tanner more than Connors,
who came from behind after
trailing 4-1 in both sets to break
his opponent.
Tanner, notorious for his
booming serve, did come up
with four aces in each set, yet
also had trouble getting in his
first serve. That gave Connors
an advantage since his game re
lies on long baseline rallies.
Afterwards Connors said:
"When 1 was down 4-1 in each
set, I thought 1 had lost the set
anyway, so 1 just let the wind do
a dance for me. I stayed back
and let the ball do a stutter step.
"The wind is a great
equalizer. Roscoe couldn't get
his rhythm. He tried to serve and
volley and switched to staying
at the baseline. Hut I figured I
came up with two good games to
break Roscoe and get back in
the match."
In each set Tanner led 4-1

when Connors whipped back to
reel off five gomes in a row for
victory.
Tanner broke Connors in the
second game of the first set
when Connors double faulted,
and Tanner broke the first
seeded Connors in the third
game of the second set after
reaching deuce.
Hut Connors came back each
time to break Tanner twice.
Tanner, who lost to Connors
last week 6-4, 6-4 in the semifi
nals at La Costa, said: "He's
tough to beat, and he's harder to
beat when he's behind."
Connors broke Tanner in the
first set on a love-10 game with a
cross-court volley and then
broke him the second time when
Tanner tried a slow drop shot
over the net. Hut the quick
footed Connors raced in and hit
a passing shot. It gave Connors a
5-4 lead and the 6-4 set when he
held serve.
Tanner said: "The drop shot
was dumb, I told myself later.
But Connors was so far back that
1 thought it might work."
It was in the second set that
Connors started to out-psych
Tanner. Trailing 4-1 in the sec
ond set and love-40 on his own
serve, Connors complained
about the service linesman.
When a double fault was cal
led on his serve, he said to
Maiden: "We need two seeing
eye dogs."
Colin Dibley and Sandy
Meyer, another ex-
Stanford player, defeated Ray
Moore and Erik Van Dillen 6-4,
6-7, 7-6 in the doubles finals.
