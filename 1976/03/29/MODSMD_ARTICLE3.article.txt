# Lyman appeals on behalf of Mandel; Davis, Steiner to teach as scheduled
## 
### Marc Strassman 
President Richard Lyman has writ
ten to Secretary of State Henry Kis
singer and Attorney General Edward
Levi, urging them to allow Belgian
Marxist economist Ernest Mandel to
come here and teach courses this
spring as an ASSU guest professor.
"It is vital to the academic enter
prise that all points of view on matters
of serious intellectual concern be
aired in the university community.
Indeed, the Helsinki Accords amount
to a broad international affirmation of
that notion," Lyman wrote in his
March 11 letter to the two cabinet of
ficers.
"Whether or not they are observed
in spirit by all the nations who signed
them," Lyman continued, "it would
seem particularly unseemly if the U.S.

were to take a position in violation of
the spirit of these Accords, as well as
in violation of our own traditions of
free speech and academic freedom."
Mandel's visa has been denied
under the provisions of the McCarran
Act, which forbids individuals who
espouse Marxist ideas to enter the Un
ited States.
Anthropology Prof. Robert Textor,
president of the Stanford chapter of
the American Association of Univer
sity Professors (AAUP), has wired
both Kissinger and Levi, asking that
they act to reverse the denial of Man
del's visa.
'Honor American freedom'
"In this Bicentennial year, we see
no better way to honor American
freedom than to take just such practi
cal steps as waiving the freedom

stifling provisions of the McCarran
Act in the case of Professor Mandel,"
Textor wired on behalf of the AAUP's
executive committee.
Both the State Department and the
Justice Department would have to ap
prove any waiver for Mandel. As of
last Friday, the University had re
ceived no response to Lyman's letter.
According to Andrea Halliday, a
member of the ASSU Guest Professor
ship Board which originally recom
mended Mandel for the position,
ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum has
also written a letter to the State De
partment, urging prompt action on
the radical economist's visa applica
tion.
"We haven't given up yet on a
waiver for Mandel," Halliday said. "If
the State and Justice Department de

cide to make an exemption to the
McCarran Act in Mandel's case and
he is able to obtain a visa by Friday,
April 2, then he will still teach his
course this spring.
"We don't feel that it would be too
much of a problem for his classes to
start a week late."
Other courses
Claude Steiner and Angela Davis,
the other two guest professors, will be
teaching their courses on radical
psychiatry and feminism as
scheduled.
There are still spaces open in all
classes to be taught by Steiner, Davis
and Mandel. Students may enroll in
the courses by signing lists in Maples
Pavilion today.

both Kissinger and Levi, asking that
they act to reverse the denial of Man
del's visa.
'Honor American freedom'
"In this Bicentennial year, we see
no better way to honor American
freedom than to take just such practi
cal steps as waiving the freedom

stifling provisions of the McCarran
Act in the case of Professor Mandel,"
Textor wired on behalf of the AAUP's
executive committee.
Both the State Department and the
Justice Department would have to ap
prove any waiver for Mandel. As of
last Friday, the University had re
ceived no response to Lyman's letter.
According to Andrea Halliday, a
member of the ASSU Guest Professor
ship Board which originally recom
mended Mandel for the position,
ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum has
also written a letter to the State De
partment, urging prompt action on
the radical economist's visa applica
tion.
"We haven't given up yet on a
waiver for Mandel," Halliday said. "If
the State and Justice Department de

cide to make an exemption to the
McCarran Act in Mandel's case and
he is able to obtain a visa by Friday,
April 2, then he will still teach his
course this spring.
"We don't feel that it would be too
much of a problem for his classes to
start a week late."
Other courses
Claude Steiner and Angela Davis,
the other two guest professors, will be
teaching their courses on radical
psychiatry and feminism as
scheduled.
There are still spaces open in all
classes to be taught by Steiner, Davis
and Mandel. Students may enroll in
the courses by signing lists in Maples
Pavilion today.
President Richard Lyman has writ
ten to Secretary of State Henry Kis
singer and Attorney General Edward
Levi, urging them to allow Belgian
Marxist economist Ernest Mandel to
come here and teach courses this
spring as an ASSU guest professor.
"It is vital to the academic enter
prise that all points of view on matters
of serious intellectual concern be
aired in the university community.
Indeed, the Helsinki Accords amount
to a broad international affirmation of
that notion," Lyman wrote in his
March 11 letter to the two cabinet of
ficers.
"Whether or not they are observed
in spirit by all the nations who signed
them," Lyman continued, "it would
seem particularly unseemly if the U.S.

were to take a position in violation of
the spirit of these Accords, as well as
in violation of our own traditions of
free speech and academic freedom."
Mandel's visa has been denied
under the provisions of the McCarran
Act, which forbids individuals who
espouse Marxist ideas to enter the Un
ited States.
