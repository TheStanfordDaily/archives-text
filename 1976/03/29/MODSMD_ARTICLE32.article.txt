# Johnston aims at goal, hole

Jay Johnston plays two sports
on the Farm that seem to be a
highly unusual combination. He
is a member of the Stanford
men's varsity golf team and is a
left winger on the ice hockey
squad. But according to the
junior from New Canaan, Conn.,
the combination is not so un
usual.
"There's a lot of National
Hockey League players that are
very good golfers," he says.
Johnston believes the connec
tion is partly due to the fact that
"a slap shot and a golf swing are
very similar."
Johnston, a sophomore politi
cal science major, has been
playing ice hockey since he was
four. His father got him started
in golf two years later.
He attended St. George's High
School in Newport, R. 1., where
he captained the ice hockey
team his senior season and was
the top scorer for three years.
The school didn't have a golf
team until his senior year, so he
spent three seasons on the var
sity tennis team.

Johnston applied mainly to
eastern colleges and was offered
an ice hockey scholarship to
Brown, but chose to come west.
He turned it down because he
wanted to concentrate on golf
where he believes his future lies.
Johnson attended Menlo
Junior College for a year before
transferring to Stanford. He was
able to play on the Stanford ice
hockey team while attending
the JG, since hockey is in a club
sport. Johnston also had success
on the links while at Menlo,
winning the state J.C. golf
championship.
Unlike some two-sport
athletes, he doesn't think the
two sports conflict. "I don't
think my playing hockey hurts
me at all on the golf course." he
says.
Johnston spends more time on
his golf game, shooting about
five rounds a week while prac
ticing about two hours each
week on the ice.
Each sport satisfies a different
urge. "I enjoy hockey because
it's a rough contact sport where

a lot of the action is based on
instinct. I like golf because it's
more of a thinking game where
you need to maintain your con
centration," he says.
Johnston has had success in
both sports. He is one of the lead
ing scorers on the ice, with 10
goals and eight assists in six
games. On the fairways, he has
played as high as second man
this season.
He has goals for each sport.
"I'd like to have the hockey
team go undefeated this sea
son." he says.(The team is cur
rently undefeated in six con
tests.)
As forgolf hesays simply, "I'd
like to win a major tourna
ment."
After he graduates, Johnston
wants to continue on in golf,
perhaps on the professional
tour. "I think 1 have a chance to
make it,"he says.
This summer he hopes to at
tend Stanford-in-Britain and
"play some golf over there." If
he doesn't go, he says "I'll stay
here and play in the summer
tournaments around here."

Johnston believes the connec
tion is partly due to the fact that
"a slap shot and a golf swing are
very similar."
Johnston, a sophomore politi
cal science major, has been
playing ice hockey since he was
four. His father got him started
in golf two years later.
He attended St. George's High
School in Newport, R. 1., where
he captained the ice hockey
team his senior season and was
the top scorer for three years.
The school didn't have a golf
team until his senior year, so he
spent three seasons on the var
sity tennis team.

Johnston applied mainly to
eastern colleges and was offered
an ice hockey scholarship to
Brown, but chose to come west.
He turned it down because he
wanted to concentrate on golf
where he believes his future lies.
Johnson attended Menlo
Junior College for a year before
transferring to Stanford. He was
able to play on the Stanford ice
hockey team while attending
the JG, since hockey is in a club
sport. Johnston also had success
on the links while at Menlo,
winning the state J.C. golf
championship.
Unlike some two-sport
athletes, he doesn't think the
two sports conflict. "I don't
think my playing hockey hurts
me at all on the golf course." he
says.
Johnston spends more time on
his golf game, shooting about
five rounds a week while prac
ticing about two hours each
week on the ice.
Each sport satisfies a different
urge. "I enjoy hockey because
it's a rough contact sport where

a lot of the action is based on
instinct. I like golf because it's
more of a thinking game where
you need to maintain your con
centration," he says.
Johnston has had success in
both sports. He is one of the lead
ing scorers on the ice, with 10
goals and eight assists in six
games. On the fairways, he has
played as high as second man
this season.
He has goals for each sport.
"I'd like to have the hockey
team go undefeated this sea
son." he says.(The team is cur
rently undefeated in six con
tests.)
As forgolf hesays simply, "I'd
like to win a major tourna
ment."
After he graduates, Johnston
wants to continue on in golf,
perhaps on the professional
tour. "I think 1 have a chance to
make it,"he says.
This summer he hopes to at
tend Stanford-in-Britain and
"play some golf over there." If
he doesn't go, he says "I'll stay
here and play in the summer
tournaments around here."

Jay Johnston plays two sports
on the Farm that seem to be a
highly unusual combination. He
is a member of the Stanford
men's varsity golf team and is a
left winger on the ice hockey
squad. But according to the
junior from New Canaan, Conn.,
the combination is not so un
usual.
"There's a lot of National
Hockey League players that are
very good golfers," he says.
