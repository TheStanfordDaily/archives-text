Wallace: 'Last contest'
WASHINGTON — Alabama Gov. George C.
Wallace indicated yesterday that this year's
presidential race may be his last political con
test.
Wallace, appearing on NBC's "Meet the
Press," said recent primary election def eats will
make it harder to win the Democratic presiden
tial nomination hut not impossible.
The primaries are not over, he said, and he
added that he will remain in the race. He pre
dicted that he will do well in next week's Wis
consin primary.
Asked if he would accept a draft by a third
party if he failed to win the Democratic nod, he
responded: "I see no circumstances under
which I would accept a draft."
Wallace was also asked what he sees in the
future if he should fail to get the nomination this
year. He responded that he will be governor of
Alabama for three more years and then "my
political career would probably be over."
Pressed on this point, Wallace said he has no
plans to run for office again in the future. He
added he doesn't know if his wife would be
interested in any political candidacy, but he
said he didn't think she would.
Wallace's first wife, Lurleen, was once
elected governor of Alabama when Wallace
was prohibited from succeeding himself.
Wallace said he felt he has accomplished a
philosophical victory this year in that many
other candidates are campaigning against big
government as he has done in the past. And he
attributed some of his defeats to this, saying that
the public has more of a choice of candidates
taking this position.
I le disagreed with a statement of Sen. Hubert
11. Humphrey (D-Minn.) that attacks on
Washington are indirect racism because they
.ire attacks on programs for the poor and

minorities.
And Wallace said segregation has become a
moot question because integration is now the
law of the land.
FBI raided Socialists
WASHINGTON — The FBI burglarized of
fices of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and
its youth affiliate as often as twice a month for a
total of 92 post-midnight raids in the early
19605, according to newly disclosed FBI docu
ments.
Two other FBI burglaries were listed as hav
ing been conducted at the homes of persons
identified in the documents as members of the
SWP in Hamden, Conn., and Los Angeles.
However, the Hamden, Conn., couple named
in the documents denied ever having been
members of the party and said their home had
not been burglarized to their knowledge.
The documents show that FBI agents photo
graphed at least 8700 pages of party files, in
cluding financial records and personal letters,
during the break-ins. It was not clear from the
FBI files whether agents only photographed
material or whether they physically removed
some papers.
Complying with a court order, the FBI gave
the party 354 pages of files describing
burglaries at the party's New York offices and
the Young Socialist Alliance and two reported
housebreaking incidents.
The party is suing the FBI and other govern
ment agencies for $27 million in damages for
allegedly unconstitutional harassment of legal
political activities. The Political Rights Defense
Fund, financing the lawsuit, made the docu
ments available.
FBI Director Clarence M. Kelley, meanwhile,
said recent allegations against the FBI have
damaged but not destroyed public confidence
in it.
"We know there has been a loss of credibility,
but we're now at the turn of the road and we're
coming back," Kelley said in an interview in
U.S. News fr World Heport.
The material suggests burglaries were con
ducted far more often than FBI officials previ
ously have acknowledged.
The FBI told the Senate Intelligence Commit
tee in September it conducted 238 burglaries
against 14 domestic organizations in a 26-year
period ending in April 1968. The figures indi
cate that, on the average, the FBI was burglariz
ing each organization once every 18 months.
IRA bombing injures 85
LONDON — Teams of surgeons performed
emergency surgery yesterday on the victims of
an IRA bombing that injured 85 persons, in
cluding at least eight children at a crowded
home products exhibition.
"We worked all through the night," a weary
doctor at St. Stephen's hospital in the west Lon
don district of Fulham, said.
"Nurses who'd been on duty all day stayed
with it until dawn. We conducted 13 emergency

operations here alone."
One middle-aged woman and another victim
were reported in critical condition. Police said
at least four persons who lost limbs in the
Saturday blast were still in intensive care units
and several other persons were considered in
serious condition.
Extra teams of surgeons and nurses were cal
led to St. Stephen's and Charing Cross for the
emergency operations which continued until 6
a.m., hospital authorities reported.
The bomb, containing an estimated two
pounds of explosives, went off in a trash can at
the "Ideal Home Exhibition" in the huge Olvm
pia center in west London. The show's or
ganizer said the exhibit would go on "despite
this insanity."
Most of the casualties were hit by shards of
glass and metal.
"Most of the injuries were to legs," a hospital
spokesman reported. Exhibition organizers
said there were at least 15,000 persons in the
center when the bomb detonated.
After the Olympia blast, a man with an Irish
accent telephoned a British newspaper and said
the bombing was the work of the Provisional
IRA's "Irish Brigade."
Scotland Yard also said the Provisionals
were responsible for the bombing.
The Provisionals have been blamed for most
of the 287 bombs planted in English cities in the
last four years. Sixty persons have been killed
and nearly 1000 wounded in the wave ot bomb
ings.
Saturday's bomb was the 14th in the latest
blitz, which began in mid-February following
the death of IRA hunger-striker Frank Stagg,
34, in an English prison.
India pushes sterilization
NEW DELHI, India — Indian officials, inten
sifying their drive to curb the birth rate in the
nation's capital, are sending teachers and
mobile medical units into this city's poorest
areas to encourage sterilization.
The sterilization drive, part of a national ef
fort to prevent India's population of 600 million
from growing to one billion by 1990, is a fol
lowup to last month's announcement of a plan
to penalize residents of the capital and govern
ment employes who do not limit their families
to two children.
To stimulate the drive, thousands of teachers
have been told to convince at least five married
persons to voluntarily undergo sterilization op
erations during the month of March, according
to B.S. Nakra, deputy family planning director
for the capital's administration.
"The focus of the campaign is the walled city
of Old Delhi," Nakra said in an interview.
"I should call Old Delhi a big slum. It is
over-populated, over-congested, the lowest
socioeconomic group," he said.
"They are most in need of this service."
The sterilization campaign of the Delhi ad
ministration, which governs the federally
controlled territories of both Old and New De
lhi, has received wide attention in the Indian

press.
Hut neither the focus of the drive nor the di
rective issued to teachers has been reported.
Nakra said that in the past three months
10,000 of the city's nearly five million residents
have undergone either vasectomies or tubec
tomies, matching the total recorded for the pre
vious nine months.
Nakra refused to specify the targets for the
richer areas of the city, where the mobile units
visit less frequently, but he acknowledged that
the target of five in Old Delhi was the highest.
For those teachers who do not meet their goal
there will be no penalty, Nakra said.
For each person he persuades to accept a
sterilization operation, a "motivator" receives
10 rupees, about $1.2.5. Each "acceptor" re
ceives 40 rupees, about $5, and perhaps bonus
of a blanket or a bush shirt, Delhi officials said.
Hearst to fly to Los Angeles
REDWOOD CITY — Patricia Hearst, con
victed on a federal bank robbery charge, will
make a quick trip to Los Angeles today for ar
raignment on state charges of kidnap, robbery
and assault, a source close to the family said
yesterday.
Hearst's one-day trip south was wrapped in
secrecy for security reasons, but federal mar
shals said she would be returned the same day
to her San Mateo County jail cell here.
The exact departure time was not available.
One of Hearst's lawyers. A 1 Johnson, indi
cated last week he would ask for a delay before
any state trial is held. Johnson said the massive
publicity which accompanied Hearst's two
month-long federal trial for bank robbery made
it impossible to secure a fair jury now "any
where in the country."
Hearst, 22, was convicted March 20 of wil
lingly participating in an armed bank robbery
with Symbionese Liberation Army "soldiers"
slightly more than two months after they kid
naped her on Feb. 4, 1974. She testified that she
was forced to participate or be killed.
Her jury also heard of the May 16,1974, inci
dent at Mel's Sporting Goods in Inglewood in
which Hearst sprayed the store with gunfire to
rescue two underground companions from ar
rest after a bungled shoplifting attempt.
Hearst said she rescued William and Emily
Harris because her SLA captors had drilled into
her the belief that she must help them whenever
possible or be executed.
Once freed she and the Harrises allegedly
escaped by taking a youth, Thomas Dean
Mathews, andhis vanon an all-nighttriponthe
streets of Los Angeles.
Matthews was released unharmed the next
morning, only hours before six SLA members
were killed in a fiery shootout with police.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Warmer today. Lows
tonight in the upper 30s and 40s. Highs today
and tomorrow in the 60s and mid 70s.

its youth affiliate as often as twice a month for a
total of 92 post-midnight raids in the early
19605, according to newly disclosed FBI docu
ments.
Two other FBI burglaries were listed as hav
ing been conducted at the homes of persons
identified in the documents as members of the
SWP in Hamden, Conn., and Los Angeles.
However, the Hamden, Conn., couple named
in the documents denied ever having been
members of the party and said their home had
not been burglarized to their knowledge.
The documents show that FBI agents photo
graphed at least 8700 pages of party files, in
cluding financial records and personal letters,
during the break-ins. It was not clear from the
FBI files whether agents only photographed
material or whether they physically removed
some papers.
Complying with a court order, the FBI gave
the party 354 pages of files describing
burglaries at the party's New York offices and
the Young Socialist Alliance and two reported
housebreaking incidents.
The party is suing the FBI and other govern
ment agencies for $27 million in damages for
allegedly unconstitutional harassment of legal
political activities. The Political Rights Defense
Fund, financing the lawsuit, made the docu
ments available.
FBI Director Clarence M. Kelley, meanwhile,
said recent allegations against the FBI have
damaged but not destroyed public confidence
in it.
"We know there has been a loss of credibility,
but we're now at the turn of the road and we're
coming back," Kelley said in an interview in
U.S. News fr World Heport.
The material suggests burglaries were con
ducted far more often than FBI officials previ
ously have acknowledged.
The FBI told the Senate Intelligence Commit
tee in September it conducted 238 burglaries
against 14 domestic organizations in a 26-year
period ending in April 1968. The figures indi
cate that, on the average, the FBI was burglariz
ing each organization once every 18 months.
IRA bombing injures 85
LONDON — Teams of surgeons performed
emergency surgery yesterday on the victims of
an IRA bombing that injured 85 persons, in
cluding at least eight children at a crowded
home products exhibition.
"We worked all through the night," a weary
doctor at St. Stephen's hospital in the west Lon
don district of Fulham, said.
"Nurses who'd been on duty all day stayed
with it until dawn. We conducted 13 emergency

operations here alone."
One middle-aged woman and another victim
were reported in critical condition. Police said
at least four persons who lost limbs in the
Saturday blast were still in intensive care units
and several other persons were considered in
serious condition.
Extra teams of surgeons and nurses were cal
led to St. Stephen's and Charing Cross for the
emergency operations which continued until 6
a.m., hospital authorities reported.
The bomb, containing an estimated two
pounds of explosives, went off in a trash can at
the "Ideal Home Exhibition" in the huge Olvm
pia center in west London. The show's or
ganizer said the exhibit would go on "despite
this insanity."
Most of the casualties were hit by shards of
glass and metal.
"Most of the injuries were to legs," a hospital
spokesman reported. Exhibition organizers
said there were at least 15,000 persons in the
center when the bomb detonated.
After the Olympia blast, a man with an Irish
accent telephoned a British newspaper and said
the bombing was the work of the Provisional
IRA's "Irish Brigade."
Scotland Yard also said the Provisionals
were responsible for the bombing.
The Provisionals have been blamed for most
of the 287 bombs planted in English cities in the
last four years. Sixty persons have been killed
and nearly 1000 wounded in the wave ot bomb
ings.
Saturday's bomb was the 14th in the latest
blitz, which began in mid-February following
the death of IRA hunger-striker Frank Stagg,
34, in an English prison.
India pushes sterilization
NEW DELHI, India — Indian officials, inten
sifying their drive to curb the birth rate in the
nation's capital, are sending teachers and
mobile medical units into this city's poorest
areas to encourage sterilization.
The sterilization drive, part of a national ef
fort to prevent India's population of 600 million
from growing to one billion by 1990, is a fol
lowup to last month's announcement of a plan
to penalize residents of the capital and govern
ment employes who do not limit their families
to two children.
To stimulate the drive, thousands of teachers
have been told to convince at least five married
persons to voluntarily undergo sterilization op
erations during the month of March, according
to B.S. Nakra, deputy family planning director
for the capital's administration.
"The focus of the campaign is the walled city
of Old Delhi," Nakra said in an interview.
"I should call Old Delhi a big slum. It is
over-populated, over-congested, the lowest
socioeconomic group," he said.
"They are most in need of this service."
The sterilization campaign of the Delhi ad
ministration, which governs the federally
controlled territories of both Old and New De
lhi, has received wide attention in the Indian

press.
Hut neither the focus of the drive nor the di
rective issued to teachers has been reported.
Nakra said that in the past three months
10,000 of the city's nearly five million residents
have undergone either vasectomies or tubec
tomies, matching the total recorded for the pre
vious nine months.
Nakra refused to specify the targets for the
richer areas of the city, where the mobile units
visit less frequently, but he acknowledged that
the target of five in Old Delhi was the highest.
For those teachers who do not meet their goal
there will be no penalty, Nakra said.
For each person he persuades to accept a
sterilization operation, a "motivator" receives
10 rupees, about $1.2.5. Each "acceptor" re
ceives 40 rupees, about $5, and perhaps bonus
of a blanket or a bush shirt, Delhi officials said.
Hearst to fly to Los Angeles
REDWOOD CITY — Patricia Hearst, con
victed on a federal bank robbery charge, will
make a quick trip to Los Angeles today for ar
raignment on state charges of kidnap, robbery
and assault, a source close to the family said
yesterday.
Hearst's one-day trip south was wrapped in
secrecy for security reasons, but federal mar
shals said she would be returned the same day
to her San Mateo County jail cell here.
The exact departure time was not available.
One of Hearst's lawyers. A 1 Johnson, indi
cated last week he would ask for a delay before
any state trial is held. Johnson said the massive
publicity which accompanied Hearst's two
month-long federal trial for bank robbery made
it impossible to secure a fair jury now "any
where in the country."
Hearst, 22, was convicted March 20 of wil
lingly participating in an armed bank robbery
with Symbionese Liberation Army "soldiers"
slightly more than two months after they kid
naped her on Feb. 4, 1974. She testified that she
was forced to participate or be killed.
Her jury also heard of the May 16,1974, inci
dent at Mel's Sporting Goods in Inglewood in
which Hearst sprayed the store with gunfire to
rescue two underground companions from ar
rest after a bungled shoplifting attempt.
Hearst said she rescued William and Emily
Harris because her SLA captors had drilled into
her the belief that she must help them whenever
possible or be executed.
Once freed she and the Harrises allegedly
escaped by taking a youth, Thomas Dean
Mathews, andhis vanon an all-nighttriponthe
streets of Los Angeles.
Matthews was released unharmed the next
morning, only hours before six SLA members
were killed in a fiery shootout with police.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Warmer today. Lows
tonight in the upper 30s and 40s. Highs today
and tomorrow in the 60s and mid 70s.
Wallace: 'Last contest'
WASHINGTON — Alabama Gov. George C.
Wallace indicated yesterday that this year's
presidential race may be his last political con
test.
Wallace, appearing on NBC's "Meet the
Press," said recent primary election def eats will
make it harder to win the Democratic presiden
tial nomination hut not impossible.
The primaries are not over, he said, and he
added that he will remain in the race. He pre
dicted that he will do well in next week's Wis
consin primary.
Asked if he would accept a draft by a third
party if he failed to win the Democratic nod, he
responded: "I see no circumstances under
which I would accept a draft."
Wallace was also asked what he sees in the
future if he should fail to get the nomination this
year. He responded that he will be governor of
Alabama for three more years and then "my
political career would probably be over."
Pressed on this point, Wallace said he has no
plans to run for office again in the future. He
added he doesn't know if his wife would be
interested in any political candidacy, but he
said he didn't think she would.
Wallace's first wife, Lurleen, was once
elected governor of Alabama when Wallace
was prohibited from succeeding himself.
Wallace said he felt he has accomplished a
philosophical victory this year in that many
other candidates are campaigning against big
government as he has done in the past. And he
attributed some of his defeats to this, saying that
the public has more of a choice of candidates
taking this position.
I le disagreed with a statement of Sen. Hubert
11. Humphrey (D-Minn.) that attacks on
Washington are indirect racism because they
.ire attacks on programs for the poor and

minorities.
And Wallace said segregation has become a
moot question because integration is now the
law of the land.

IRA bombing injures 85
LONDON — Teams of surgeons performed
emergency surgery yesterday on the victims of
an IRA bombing that injured 85 persons, in
cluding at least eight children at a crowded
home products exhibition.
"We worked all through the night," a weary
doctor at St. Stephen's hospital in the west Lon
don district of Fulham, said.
"Nurses who'd been on duty all day stayed
with it until dawn. We conducted 13 emergency

operations here alone."
One middle-aged woman and another victim
were reported in critical condition. Police said
at least four persons who lost limbs in the
Saturday blast were still in intensive care units
and several other persons were considered in
serious condition.
Extra teams of surgeons and nurses were cal
led to St. Stephen's and Charing Cross for the
emergency operations which continued until 6
a.m., hospital authorities reported.
The bomb, containing an estimated two
pounds of explosives, went off in a trash can at
the "Ideal Home Exhibition" in the huge Olvm
pia center in west London. The show's or
ganizer said the exhibit would go on "despite
this insanity."
Most of the casualties were hit by shards of
glass and metal.
"Most of the injuries were to legs," a hospital
spokesman reported. Exhibition organizers
said there were at least 15,000 persons in the
center when the bomb detonated.
After the Olympia blast, a man with an Irish
accent telephoned a British newspaper and said
the bombing was the work of the Provisional
IRA's "Irish Brigade."
Scotland Yard also said the Provisionals
were responsible for the bombing.
The Provisionals have been blamed for most
of the 287 bombs planted in English cities in the
last four years. Sixty persons have been killed
and nearly 1000 wounded in the wave ot bomb
ings.
Saturday's bomb was the 14th in the latest
blitz, which began in mid-February following
the death of IRA hunger-striker Frank Stagg,
34, in an English prison.
India pushes sterilization
NEW DELHI, India — Indian officials, inten
sifying their drive to curb the birth rate in the
nation's capital, are sending teachers and
mobile medical units into this city's poorest
areas to encourage sterilization.
The sterilization drive, part of a national ef
fort to prevent India's population of 600 million
from growing to one billion by 1990, is a fol
lowup to last month's announcement of a plan
to penalize residents of the capital and govern
ment employes who do not limit their families
to two children.
To stimulate the drive, thousands of teachers
have been told to convince at least five married
persons to voluntarily undergo sterilization op
erations during the month of March, according
to B.S. Nakra, deputy family planning director
for the capital's administration.
"The focus of the campaign is the walled city
of Old Delhi," Nakra said in an interview.
"I should call Old Delhi a big slum. It is
over-populated, over-congested, the lowest
socioeconomic group," he said.
"They are most in need of this service."
The sterilization campaign of the Delhi ad
ministration, which governs the federally
controlled territories of both Old and New De
lhi, has received wide attention in the Indian

press.
Hut neither the focus of the drive nor the di
rective issued to teachers has been reported.
Nakra said that in the past three months
10,000 of the city's nearly five million residents
have undergone either vasectomies or tubec
tomies, matching the total recorded for the pre
vious nine months.
Nakra refused to specify the targets for the
richer areas of the city, where the mobile units
visit less frequently, but he acknowledged that
the target of five in Old Delhi was the highest.
For those teachers who do not meet their goal
there will be no penalty, Nakra said.
For each person he persuades to accept a
sterilization operation, a "motivator" receives
10 rupees, about $1.2.5. Each "acceptor" re
ceives 40 rupees, about $5, and perhaps bonus
of a blanket or a bush shirt, Delhi officials said.
Hearst to fly to Los Angeles
REDWOOD CITY — Patricia Hearst, con
victed on a federal bank robbery charge, will
make a quick trip to Los Angeles today for ar
raignment on state charges of kidnap, robbery
and assault, a source close to the family said
yesterday.
Hearst's one-day trip south was wrapped in
secrecy for security reasons, but federal mar
shals said she would be returned the same day
to her San Mateo County jail cell here.
The exact departure time was not available.
One of Hearst's lawyers. A 1 Johnson, indi
cated last week he would ask for a delay before
any state trial is held. Johnson said the massive
publicity which accompanied Hearst's two
month-long federal trial for bank robbery made
it impossible to secure a fair jury now "any
where in the country."
Hearst, 22, was convicted March 20 of wil
lingly participating in an armed bank robbery
with Symbionese Liberation Army "soldiers"
slightly more than two months after they kid
naped her on Feb. 4, 1974. She testified that she
was forced to participate or be killed.
Her jury also heard of the May 16,1974, inci
dent at Mel's Sporting Goods in Inglewood in
which Hearst sprayed the store with gunfire to
rescue two underground companions from ar
rest after a bungled shoplifting attempt.
Hearst said she rescued William and Emily
Harris because her SLA captors had drilled into
her the belief that she must help them whenever
possible or be executed.
Once freed she and the Harrises allegedly
escaped by taking a youth, Thomas Dean
Mathews, andhis vanon an all-nighttriponthe
streets of Los Angeles.
Matthews was released unharmed the next
morning, only hours before six SLA members
were killed in a fiery shootout with police.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Warmer today. Lows
tonight in the upper 30s and 40s. Highs today
and tomorrow in the 60s and mid 70s.
Wallace: 'Last contest'
WASHINGTON — Alabama Gov. George C.
Wallace indicated yesterday that this year's
presidential race may be his last political con
test.
Wallace, appearing on NBC's "Meet the
Press," said recent primary election def eats will
make it harder to win the Democratic presiden
tial nomination hut not impossible.
The primaries are not over, he said, and he
added that he will remain in the race. He pre
dicted that he will do well in next week's Wis
consin primary.
Asked if he would accept a draft by a third
party if he failed to win the Democratic nod, he
responded: "I see no circumstances under
which I would accept a draft."
Wallace was also asked what he sees in the
future if he should fail to get the nomination this
year. He responded that he will be governor of
Alabama for three more years and then "my
political career would probably be over."
Pressed on this point, Wallace said he has no
plans to run for office again in the future. He
added he doesn't know if his wife would be
interested in any political candidacy, but he
said he didn't think she would.
Wallace's first wife, Lurleen, was once
elected governor of Alabama when Wallace
was prohibited from succeeding himself.
Wallace said he felt he has accomplished a
philosophical victory this year in that many
other candidates are campaigning against big
government as he has done in the past. And he
attributed some of his defeats to this, saying that
the public has more of a choice of candidates
taking this position.
I le disagreed with a statement of Sen. Hubert
11. Humphrey (D-Minn.) that attacks on
Washington are indirect racism because they
.ire attacks on programs for the poor and

minorities.
And Wallace said segregation has become a
moot question because integration is now the
law of the land.
FBI raided Socialists
WASHINGTON — The FBI burglarized of
fices of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and
its youth affiliate as often as twice a month for a
total of 92 post-midnight raids in the early
19605, according to newly disclosed FBI docu
ments.
Two other FBI burglaries were listed as hav
ing been conducted at the homes of persons
identified in the documents as members of the
SWP in Hamden, Conn., and Los Angeles.
However, the Hamden, Conn., couple named
in the documents denied ever having been
members of the party and said their home had
not been burglarized to their knowledge.
The documents show that FBI agents photo
graphed at least 8700 pages of party files, in
cluding financial records and personal letters,
during the break-ins. It was not clear from the
FBI files whether agents only photographed
material or whether they physically removed
some papers.
Complying with a court order, the FBI gave
the party 354 pages of files describing
burglaries at the party's New York offices and
the Young Socialist Alliance and two reported
housebreaking incidents.
The party is suing the FBI and other govern
ment agencies for $27 million in damages for
allegedly unconstitutional harassment of legal
political activities. The Political Rights Defense
Fund, financing the lawsuit, made the docu
ments available.
FBI Director Clarence M. Kelley, meanwhile,
said recent allegations against the FBI have
damaged but not destroyed public confidence
in it.
"We know there has been a loss of credibility,
but we're now at the turn of the road and we're
coming back," Kelley said in an interview in
U.S. News fr World Heport.
The material suggests burglaries were con
ducted far more often than FBI officials previ
ously have acknowledged.
The FBI told the Senate Intelligence Commit
tee in September it conducted 238 burglaries
against 14 domestic organizations in a 26-year
period ending in April 1968. The figures indi
cate that, on the average, the FBI was burglariz
ing each organization once every 18 months.

India pushes sterilization
NEW DELHI, India — Indian officials, inten
sifying their drive to curb the birth rate in the
nation's capital, are sending teachers and
mobile medical units into this city's poorest
areas to encourage sterilization.
The sterilization drive, part of a national ef
fort to prevent India's population of 600 million
from growing to one billion by 1990, is a fol
lowup to last month's announcement of a plan
to penalize residents of the capital and govern
ment employes who do not limit their families
to two children.
To stimulate the drive, thousands of teachers
have been told to convince at least five married
persons to voluntarily undergo sterilization op
erations during the month of March, according
to B.S. Nakra, deputy family planning director
for the capital's administration.
"The focus of the campaign is the walled city
of Old Delhi," Nakra said in an interview.
"I should call Old Delhi a big slum. It is
over-populated, over-congested, the lowest
socioeconomic group," he said.
"They are most in need of this service."
The sterilization campaign of the Delhi ad
ministration, which governs the federally
controlled territories of both Old and New De
lhi, has received wide attention in the Indian

press.
Hut neither the focus of the drive nor the di
rective issued to teachers has been reported.
Nakra said that in the past three months
10,000 of the city's nearly five million residents
have undergone either vasectomies or tubec
tomies, matching the total recorded for the pre
vious nine months.
Nakra refused to specify the targets for the
richer areas of the city, where the mobile units
visit less frequently, but he acknowledged that
the target of five in Old Delhi was the highest.
For those teachers who do not meet their goal
there will be no penalty, Nakra said.
For each person he persuades to accept a
sterilization operation, a "motivator" receives
10 rupees, about $1.2.5. Each "acceptor" re
ceives 40 rupees, about $5, and perhaps bonus
of a blanket or a bush shirt, Delhi officials said.
Hearst to fly to Los Angeles
REDWOOD CITY — Patricia Hearst, con
victed on a federal bank robbery charge, will
make a quick trip to Los Angeles today for ar
raignment on state charges of kidnap, robbery
and assault, a source close to the family said
yesterday.
Hearst's one-day trip south was wrapped in
secrecy for security reasons, but federal mar
shals said she would be returned the same day
to her San Mateo County jail cell here.
The exact departure time was not available.
One of Hearst's lawyers. A 1 Johnson, indi
cated last week he would ask for a delay before
any state trial is held. Johnson said the massive
publicity which accompanied Hearst's two
month-long federal trial for bank robbery made
it impossible to secure a fair jury now "any
where in the country."
Hearst, 22, was convicted March 20 of wil
lingly participating in an armed bank robbery
with Symbionese Liberation Army "soldiers"
slightly more than two months after they kid
naped her on Feb. 4, 1974. She testified that she
was forced to participate or be killed.
Her jury also heard of the May 16,1974, inci
dent at Mel's Sporting Goods in Inglewood in
which Hearst sprayed the store with gunfire to
rescue two underground companions from ar
rest after a bungled shoplifting attempt.
Hearst said she rescued William and Emily
Harris because her SLA captors had drilled into
her the belief that she must help them whenever
possible or be executed.
Once freed she and the Harrises allegedly
escaped by taking a youth, Thomas Dean
Mathews, andhis vanon an all-nighttriponthe
streets of Los Angeles.
Matthews was released unharmed the next
morning, only hours before six SLA members
were killed in a fiery shootout with police.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Warmer today. Lows
tonight in the upper 30s and 40s. Highs today
and tomorrow in the 60s and mid 70s.
Wallace: 'Last contest'
WASHINGTON — Alabama Gov. George C.
Wallace indicated yesterday that this year's
presidential race may be his last political con
test.
Wallace, appearing on NBC's "Meet the
Press," said recent primary election def eats will
make it harder to win the Democratic presiden
tial nomination hut not impossible.
The primaries are not over, he said, and he
added that he will remain in the race. He pre
dicted that he will do well in next week's Wis
consin primary.
Asked if he would accept a draft by a third
party if he failed to win the Democratic nod, he
responded: "I see no circumstances under
which I would accept a draft."
Wallace was also asked what he sees in the
future if he should fail to get the nomination this
year. He responded that he will be governor of
Alabama for three more years and then "my
political career would probably be over."
Pressed on this point, Wallace said he has no
plans to run for office again in the future. He
added he doesn't know if his wife would be
interested in any political candidacy, but he
said he didn't think she would.
Wallace's first wife, Lurleen, was once
elected governor of Alabama when Wallace
was prohibited from succeeding himself.
Wallace said he felt he has accomplished a
philosophical victory this year in that many
other candidates are campaigning against big
government as he has done in the past. And he
attributed some of his defeats to this, saying that
the public has more of a choice of candidates
taking this position.
I le disagreed with a statement of Sen. Hubert
11. Humphrey (D-Minn.) that attacks on
Washington are indirect racism because they
.ire attacks on programs for the poor and

minorities.
And Wallace said segregation has become a
moot question because integration is now the
law of the land.
FBI raided Socialists
WASHINGTON — The FBI burglarized of
fices of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and
its youth affiliate as often as twice a month for a
total of 92 post-midnight raids in the early
19605, according to newly disclosed FBI docu
ments.
Two other FBI burglaries were listed as hav
ing been conducted at the homes of persons
identified in the documents as members of the
SWP in Hamden, Conn., and Los Angeles.
However, the Hamden, Conn., couple named
in the documents denied ever having been
members of the party and said their home had
not been burglarized to their knowledge.
The documents show that FBI agents photo
graphed at least 8700 pages of party files, in
cluding financial records and personal letters,
during the break-ins. It was not clear from the
FBI files whether agents only photographed
material or whether they physically removed
some papers.
Complying with a court order, the FBI gave
the party 354 pages of files describing
burglaries at the party's New York offices and
the Young Socialist Alliance and two reported
housebreaking incidents.
The party is suing the FBI and other govern
ment agencies for $27 million in damages for
allegedly unconstitutional harassment of legal
political activities. The Political Rights Defense
Fund, financing the lawsuit, made the docu
ments available.
FBI Director Clarence M. Kelley, meanwhile,
said recent allegations against the FBI have
damaged but not destroyed public confidence
in it.
"We know there has been a loss of credibility,
but we're now at the turn of the road and we're
coming back," Kelley said in an interview in
U.S. News fr World Heport.
The material suggests burglaries were con
ducted far more often than FBI officials previ
ously have acknowledged.
The FBI told the Senate Intelligence Commit
tee in September it conducted 238 burglaries
against 14 domestic organizations in a 26-year
period ending in April 1968. The figures indi
cate that, on the average, the FBI was burglariz
ing each organization once every 18 months.
IRA bombing injures 85
LONDON — Teams of surgeons performed
emergency surgery yesterday on the victims of
an IRA bombing that injured 85 persons, in
cluding at least eight children at a crowded
home products exhibition.
"We worked all through the night," a weary
doctor at St. Stephen's hospital in the west Lon
don district of Fulham, said.
"Nurses who'd been on duty all day stayed
with it until dawn. We conducted 13 emergency

operations here alone."
One middle-aged woman and another victim
were reported in critical condition. Police said
at least four persons who lost limbs in the
Saturday blast were still in intensive care units
and several other persons were considered in
serious condition.
Extra teams of surgeons and nurses were cal
led to St. Stephen's and Charing Cross for the
emergency operations which continued until 6
a.m., hospital authorities reported.
The bomb, containing an estimated two
pounds of explosives, went off in a trash can at
the "Ideal Home Exhibition" in the huge Olvm
pia center in west London. The show's or
ganizer said the exhibit would go on "despite
this insanity."
Most of the casualties were hit by shards of
glass and metal.
"Most of the injuries were to legs," a hospital
spokesman reported. Exhibition organizers
said there were at least 15,000 persons in the
center when the bomb detonated.
After the Olympia blast, a man with an Irish
accent telephoned a British newspaper and said
the bombing was the work of the Provisional
IRA's "Irish Brigade."
Scotland Yard also said the Provisionals
were responsible for the bombing.
The Provisionals have been blamed for most
of the 287 bombs planted in English cities in the
last four years. Sixty persons have been killed
and nearly 1000 wounded in the wave ot bomb
ings.
Saturday's bomb was the 14th in the latest
blitz, which began in mid-February following

the target of five in Old Delhi was the highest.
For those teachers who do not meet their goal
there will be no penalty, Nakra said.
For each person he persuades to accept a
sterilization operation, a "motivator" receives
10 rupees, about $1.2.5. Each "acceptor" re
ceives 40 rupees, about $5, and perhaps bonus
of a blanket or a bush shirt, Delhi officials said.
Hearst to fly to Los Angeles
REDWOOD CITY — Patricia Hearst, con
victed on a federal bank robbery charge, will
make a quick trip to Los Angeles today for ar
raignment on state charges of kidnap, robbery
and assault, a source close to the family said
yesterday.
Hearst's one-day trip south was wrapped in
secrecy for security reasons, but federal mar
shals said she would be returned the same day
to her San Mateo County jail cell here.
The exact departure time was not available.
One of Hearst's lawyers. A 1 Johnson, indi
cated last week he would ask for a delay before
any state trial is held. Johnson said the massive
publicity which accompanied Hearst's two
month-long federal trial for bank robbery made
it impossible to secure a fair jury now "any
where in the country."
Hearst, 22, was convicted March 20 of wil
lingly participating in an armed bank robbery
with Symbionese Liberation Army "soldiers"
slightly more than two months after they kid
naped her on Feb. 4, 1974. She testified that she
was forced to participate or be killed.
Her jury also heard of the May 16,1974, inci
dent at Mel's Sporting Goods in Inglewood in
which Hearst sprayed the store with gunfire to
rescue two underground companions from ar
rest after a bungled shoplifting attempt.
Hearst said she rescued William and Emily
Harris because her SLA captors had drilled into
her the belief that she must help them whenever
possible or be executed.
Once freed she and the Harrises allegedly
escaped by taking a youth, Thomas Dean
Mathews, andhis vanon an all-nighttriponthe
streets of Los Angeles.
Matthews was released unharmed the next
morning, only hours before six SLA members
were killed in a fiery shootout with police.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Warmer today. Lows
tonight in the upper 30s and 40s. Highs today
and tomorrow in the 60s and mid 70s.
Wallace: 'Last contest'
WASHINGTON — Alabama Gov. George C.
Wallace indicated yesterday that this year's
presidential race may be his last political con
test.
Wallace, appearing on NBC's "Meet the
Press," said recent primary election def eats will
make it harder to win the Democratic presiden
tial nomination hut not impossible.
The primaries are not over, he said, and he
added that he will remain in the race. He pre
dicted that he will do well in next week's Wis
consin primary.
Asked if he would accept a draft by a third
party if he failed to win the Democratic nod, he
responded: "I see no circumstances under
which I would accept a draft."
Wallace was also asked what he sees in the
future if he should fail to get the nomination this
year. He responded that he will be governor of
Alabama for three more years and then "my
political career would probably be over."
Pressed on this point, Wallace said he has no
plans to run for office again in the future. He
added he doesn't know if his wife would be
interested in any political candidacy, but he
said he didn't think she would.
Wallace's first wife, Lurleen, was once
elected governor of Alabama when Wallace
was prohibited from succeeding himself.
Wallace said he felt he has accomplished a
philosophical victory this year in that many
other candidates are campaigning against big
government as he has done in the past. And he
attributed some of his defeats to this, saying that
the public has more of a choice of candidates
taking this position.
I le disagreed with a statement of Sen. Hubert
11. Humphrey (D-Minn.) that attacks on
Washington are indirect racism because they
.ire attacks on programs for the poor and

minorities.
And Wallace said segregation has become a
moot question because integration is now the
law of the land.
FBI raided Socialists
WASHINGTON — The FBI burglarized of
fices of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and
its youth affiliate as often as twice a month for a
total of 92 post-midnight raids in the early
19605, according to newly disclosed FBI docu
ments.
Two other FBI burglaries were listed as hav
ing been conducted at the homes of persons
identified in the documents as members of the
SWP in Hamden, Conn., and Los Angeles.
However, the Hamden, Conn., couple named
in the documents denied ever having been
members of the party and said their home had
not been burglarized to their knowledge.
The documents show that FBI agents photo
graphed at least 8700 pages of party files, in
cluding financial records and personal letters,
during the break-ins. It was not clear from the
FBI files whether agents only photographed
material or whether they physically removed
some papers.
Complying with a court order, the FBI gave
the party 354 pages of files describing
burglaries at the party's New York offices and
the Young Socialist Alliance and two reported
housebreaking incidents.
The party is suing the FBI and other govern
ment agencies for $27 million in damages for
allegedly unconstitutional harassment of legal
political activities. The Political Rights Defense
Fund, financing the lawsuit, made the docu
ments available.
FBI Director Clarence M. Kelley, meanwhile,
said recent allegations against the FBI have
damaged but not destroyed public confidence
in it.
"We know there has been a loss of credibility,
but we're now at the turn of the road and we're
coming back," Kelley said in an interview in
U.S. News fr World Heport.
The material suggests burglaries were con
ducted far more often than FBI officials previ
ously have acknowledged.
The FBI told the Senate Intelligence Commit
tee in September it conducted 238 burglaries
against 14 domestic organizations in a 26-year
period ending in April 1968. The figures indi
cate that, on the average, the FBI was burglariz
ing each organization once every 18 months.
IRA bombing injures 85
LONDON — Teams of surgeons performed
emergency surgery yesterday on the victims of
an IRA bombing that injured 85 persons, in
cluding at least eight children at a crowded
home products exhibition.
"We worked all through the night," a weary
doctor at St. Stephen's hospital in the west Lon
don district of Fulham, said.
"Nurses who'd been on duty all day stayed
with it until dawn. We conducted 13 emergency

operations here alone."
One middle-aged woman and another victim
were reported in critical condition. Police said
at least four persons who lost limbs in the
Saturday blast were still in intensive care units
and several other persons were considered in
serious condition.
Extra teams of surgeons and nurses were cal
led to St. Stephen's and Charing Cross for the
emergency operations which continued until 6
a.m., hospital authorities reported.
The bomb, containing an estimated two
pounds of explosives, went off in a trash can at
the "Ideal Home Exhibition" in the huge Olvm
pia center in west London. The show's or
ganizer said the exhibit would go on "despite
this insanity."
Most of the casualties were hit by shards of
glass and metal.
"Most of the injuries were to legs," a hospital
spokesman reported. Exhibition organizers
said there were at least 15,000 persons in the
center when the bomb detonated.
After the Olympia blast, a man with an Irish
accent telephoned a British newspaper and said
the bombing was the work of the Provisional
IRA's "Irish Brigade."
Scotland Yard also said the Provisionals
were responsible for the bombing.
The Provisionals have been blamed for most
of the 287 bombs planted in English cities in the
last four years. Sixty persons have been killed
and nearly 1000 wounded in the wave ot bomb
ings.
Saturday's bomb was the 14th in the latest
blitz, which began in mid-February following
the death of IRA hunger-striker Frank Stagg,
34, in an English prison.
India pushes sterilization
NEW DELHI, India — Indian officials, inten
sifying their drive to curb the birth rate in the
nation's capital, are sending teachers and
mobile medical units into this city's poorest
areas to encourage sterilization.
The sterilization drive, part of a national ef
fort to prevent India's population of 600 million
from growing to one billion by 1990, is a fol
lowup to last month's announcement of a plan
to penalize residents of the capital and govern
ment employes who do not limit their families
to two children.
To stimulate the drive, thousands of teachers
have been told to convince at least five married
persons to voluntarily undergo sterilization op
erations during the month of March, according
to B.S. Nakra, deputy family planning director
for the capital's administration.
"The focus of the campaign is the walled city
of Old Delhi," Nakra said in an interview.
"I should call Old Delhi a big slum. It is
over-populated, over-congested, the lowest
socioeconomic group," he said.
"They are most in need of this service."
The sterilization campaign of the Delhi ad
ministration, which governs the federally
controlled territories of both Old and New De
lhi, has received wide attention in the Indian

press.
Hut neither the focus of the drive nor the di
rective issued to teachers has been reported.
Nakra said that in the past three months
10,000 of the city's nearly five million residents
have undergone either vasectomies or tubec
tomies, matching the total recorded for the pre
vious nine months.
Nakra refused to specify the targets for the
richer areas of the city, where the mobile units
visit less frequently, but he acknowledged that
the target of five in Old Delhi was the highest.
For those teachers who do not meet their goal
there will be no penalty, Nakra said.
For each person he persuades to accept a
sterilization operation, a "motivator" receives
10 rupees, about $1.2.5. Each "acceptor" re
ceives 40 rupees, about $5, and perhaps bonus
of a blanket or a bush shirt, Delhi officials said.
