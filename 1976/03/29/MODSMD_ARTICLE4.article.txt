A RLINC;TON HEIGHTS, 111. (AP) â€”
Early results of weekend voting by
400,000 Teamsters indicated over
whelming authorization for a strike
that could bring the nation's trucks to
a halt, union officials said yesterday.
Bargaining in the trucking talks
was suspended late last week until to
day, but both industry and union
sou rces were hopeful of settlement be
fore midnight Wednesday when the
current National Master Freight Ag
reement expires.
The pact covers drivers that move
nearly 00 percent of the country's
manufactured goods.
Rank-and-file truckers meeting at
union halls across the country, how
ever, were expected to turn down
what they consider a meager industry
offer of 85 cents more an hour and an
$11-a-week hike in fringe benefits
over 39 months.
Salary disagreement
Industry and union negotiating
teams, headed by Teamster's Presi
dent Frank E. Fitzsimmons and
Trucking Employers, Inc. President
William C.. Mclntyre, currently differ
by 00 cents an hour on salary, sources
say.
Theemployers' package amounts to

a 20 percent increase in wages and
benefits over 39 months, but
Teamsters, demanding $1.75 hike in
wages and $17 more in pension and
health-welfare benefits, want an in
crease of at least 30 percent over three
years.
Wages for truckers now vary from
$7.18 to $7.33 an hour. Also at issue
are additional mileage pay for long
haul drivers and cost-of-living ad
justments.
In Detroit, where members of Local
299's cartage division voted 898-24,
and steel hauling division members
voted 160-18 to authorize a strike,
truckers predicted almost unanimous
rejection nationally.
Offer rejected
Long-haul drivers of Local 337, also
in Detroit, spurned the offer 99-1,
while construction site Teamsters of
Local 247 voted 38-5 against the offer
and for a strike. Members of St. Louis
Local 000 followed suit, turning down
the offer by a margin of more than 9-1,
union officials said.
Although the government is certain
to seek a Taft-Hartley injunction for
an 80-day cooling off period in event
of a walkout, some Teamsters said
wildcat actions were possible.
