# LAC: 'It seems to work'

At Stanford, where the average high school CPA of
entering freshmen is 3.8, it is ironic that the one course
taken by more than 50 percent of the freshman class is
"Effective Reading Skills," a study techniques booster
offered by the Learning Assistance Center (LAC).
The center, which opened in 1972, offers courses in
reading rate improvement, library usage, and how to
budget study time, as well as methods of tackling theses
and term papers.
According to LAC director Michael McHargue, "Stan
ford students are so bright they haven't had to develop
effective learning skills. They have achieved high marks
without such instruction."
He explains that the lack of learning skills stems from
the fact that most of the students have had no formal
instruction in reading since elementary school. The chal
lenges present in the environment here — peer pressure,
competition for admission to graduate and professional
schools and personal expectations formed in high school
— have led students to realize that efficiency will be what
distinguishes them from others of equal intelligence.
Tutoring programs
Besides offering the reading skills improvement clas
ses. LAC was instrumental in establishing departmental
tutoring programs such as the physics Reference Frame,
and the chemistry Information Room. Individual tutor
ing is handled by undergraduates who enroll in a tutor
training course and earn credit for their training as well
as for their tutoring services.
In 1974, LAC received a grant of $6000 from the Exxon
Education Foundation to plan, develop and evaluate a
peer counseling program aimed at improving study
skills.
The peer counselors must themselves take the LAC-10
"Reading Efficiency Skills" class, so as to reinforce their
knowledge of learning skills. As a result of the success of

the LAC peer counseling. Undergraduate Studies Dean
James Gibbs let LAC become the accrediting agency for
all campus peer counseling programs.
Clearinghouse
LAC also serves as the clearinghouse for the Llnder
graduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP),
which was designed to encou rage students to participate
in research projects, either as paid assistants or for
academic credit.
Funding for LACprograms comes from Undergraduate
Studies. The LAC budget took a 20 percent cut from
University funds in 1975-76, although the Exxon grant
managed to keep the program on a par with the previous
year.
"I don't see facilities expanding, mostly because of
budget requirements; we would like to develop more
self-management and self-learning programs, however,"
says McHargue. "We could fill twice as many reading
courses as we have now . . . but it depends a lot on
budget."
HEW grant?
McHargue is applying for a grant from the Department
of Health. Education and Welfare. "If we get it, it will
provide us with enough funds for all of next year," he
says.
He stresses the importance of informing the public of
methods of improving reading and learning efficiency.
The LAC program was written up in the Feb. 2 issue of
Time and labeled a "remedial program for the bright."
McHargue says that the stigma of "remedial" must be
eliminated, commenting that "a lot of the staff thought we
should change the name of the program. They thought
that 'assistance' was a demeaning term."
Time is quick to point out, however, that "LAC has
become one of the most popular institutions at Stanford."
The reason for its overwhelming success? — "It seems to
work."
