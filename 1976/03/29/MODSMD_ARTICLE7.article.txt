# Recycling bill meets needs
## 
### 
The "Bottle Bill" recently de
feated by the California Legisla
ture offered a unique opportun
ity to solve several pressing en
vironmental problems simul
taneously.
Patterned after similar
legislation adopted by Oregon
in 1972, it would require that
all beer and soft drink contain
ers sold in this state after Jan. 1,
1977 carry a minimum deposit.
In view of the nation's current
ecological status, it is tragic and
unfortunate that comparable ac
tion has not been initiated at the
federal level. The container in
dustry is responsible for 0.6 per
cent of total U.S. energy con
sumption.
According to the Environ
mental Protection Agency
(EPA), 57 percent of that figure,
the equivalent of 42 million bar
rels of oil per year, could be
saved by a total conversion to a
returnable-refillable system.
According to other EPA calcu
lations, our dwindling natural
resources would also be con
served by such legislation. A re
cycling of 80 percent of all cans
and a refilling of 90 percent of
all bottles would have saved 1.3
million tons of steel, 350,000
tons of aluminum and up to 4.6
million tons of glass in 1972.
Beautification
Nation-wide beautification
would also result from the de
creased littering induced by a
mandatory deposit law. Beer
and soft drink containers ac
count for 62 percent of roadside
litter by volume. Oregon and
Vermont witnessed container
litter decreases of 66 percent
and 67 percent in the year fol
lowing passage of their bottle
bills.
Other impressive results of
the Oregon legislation are clear
incentive for similar action on a
national scale. The Oregon En
vironmental Council calculated
a 1.3 trillion British thermal
unit energy savings in the state
due to the bill.
Before its enactment, 436
million soft drink and beer con
tainers contributed to Oregon's
solid waste per year; this de
plorable figure was reduced by
88 percent to only 51 million

passage.
Any proposed mandatory de
posit law, at the state or federal
level, faces its greatest opposi
tion from labor unions, con
tainer manufacturers, and
bottlers, who contend that se
vere economic harm would re
sult from such action.
Sales drop?
Reduced sales and un
employment are among the
specific claims made against
the Mottle Bill.
However, turning once more
to Oregon, clear refutation of
these arguments is found. An
Oregon State University study
concluded that the 1973 sales
increase was well above nor
mal. Malt brewers and soft
drink bottlers incurred substan
tial savings due to the change to
refillable bottles.
Losses due to washing, handl
ing, shipping, and sterilizing
were more than offset by the fact
that each returnable container
is used an average of 24 times.
Because soft drinks in return
able bottles cost less than they
do in one-way containers, sales
revenues did decrease by about
$1.7 million. But the soft drink
bottler profited through a
$4.4 million decrease in operat
ing costs.
Operating revenue
Similarly, an almost $4 mill
ion increase in operating re
venue was experienced by the
state beer industry.
Total' employment also in
creased as a result of the bill.
While 350 jobs were lost in pro
duction labor for bottles and
cans, 715 new jobs werecreated,
giving a balance of 365 addi
tional jobs for an estimated an
nual payroll increase of $1.6
million.
Clearly, the nation has no
thing to lose and everything to
gain from a mandatory con
tainer deposit law. In the in
terest of future environmental
integrity, the consumer must be
willing to give up his careless
and convenient habits in favor
of a more sensible system.
