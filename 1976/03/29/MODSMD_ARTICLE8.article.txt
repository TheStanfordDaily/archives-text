# Has 'liberal' become a dirty word?

About 10 years ago (when I
was blissfully unaware of the
convoluted nature of American
politics), 1 can recall a friend
asking his mother what a "lib
eral" was. Without hesitation,
she replied, "Oh, they're bad
people. They were the ones who
took prayers out oftheschools."
In the wake of the "collapse"
of the Great Society, "liberal"
has once again emerged as an
epithet. After all, we are told, it
was the liberals who created all
these grandiose social programs
that eat up our tax dollars. And
those programs don't even ac
complish anything.
Worse yet, the federal gov
ernment has run up a deficit
financing these nonproductive
agencies, thereby precipitating

inflation (not to mention that
this same deficit causes interest
rates to rise, thus inhibiting in
vestment and causing un
employment).
Lest we forget, the liberals
were also chiefly responsible for
America's collapse as a military
power. They blocked the arms
shipments to Angola, resulting
in the emergence of a Soviet
equipped faction there.
Vietnam's fall
Vietnam wouldn't have fallen
without the liberals' efforts to
cut off military aid, nor would
Cambodia have succumbed to
the Communists.
Now liberals want to cut the
Defense budget at a time when
American military prestige is at
an all-time low, and the spectre

of Russian expansionism looms
over Africa.
These are the major objections
of the anti-liberals. Now let's
look at their remedies.
"We need to cut back the huge
bureaucracy in Washington."
But where do we start? Regulat
ory agencies, such as the In
terstate Commerce Commission
(ICC), should they go first?
It won't be the liberals howl
ing at ICC's demise. It'll be your
old-line conservatives in the
trucking industry screaming
chaos although they know
damned well that it would mean
real competition for a change.
Fatcats
This phenomenon is not li
mited to corporate fatcats,
either. Everyone knows that the
small town is a bastion of rug
ged individualism.
Recently, the Postal Service
decided (and not out of caprici
ous whim), that fourth-class
(small town) Post Offices were
unprofitable and that they
would gradually phased out
and merged into larger units. A
welcome infusion of common
sense cost-cutting, no?
And the towns are reacting as
if they'd been nuked. It seems
that mail delivery is a public
service, and shouldn't be subject
to the whims of profit-seeking
business types. You're destroy
ing the integrity of small towns!!
Another suggested remedy is
to get rid of subsidized lunches
in public schools and food
stamps. Sounds reasonable
enough. There are much more
efficient and less bureaucrat
intensive mechanisms that can
be created to feed the poor.
Agribusiness
Now we get agribusiness les
son number one: What helps
keep farmers' returns for pro
duce high? Give yourself a gold
star if you answered food
stamps. And who's going to
come rushing to the aid of the
poor man if you try to take his

food stamps away?
As to, the military: Which of
you young bucks would like to
hop aboard the boat for Angola
(and not at the going mercenary
rate, either)? We Americans
learned our lesson about milit
ary intervention in Vietnam.
The Russians should've
learned theirs in Egypt (and 18
Cuban soldiers learned their
last lesson about respecting the
civilian population of Angola).
Gulf Oil still has our "Marxist"
friend, Angola's Pres. Agos
tinho Neto by the short hairs.
And the budget? These same
wonderful people who decry
"wasteful spending" by the fed
eral government look the other
way as corporate rip-off artists
hand in their bills, complete
with massive cost-overruns, to
the Defense Department.
Bailout
Remember the C-SA? How
about the bailout of Lockheed
Aircraft Corporation? No doubt
Lockheed used most of the take
to bribe foreign politicians.
Admittedly, the federal gov
ernment could use a few effi
ciency experts to clean up its
act. But massive social prog
rams can't be reverted to local
control.
State governments can't and
won't finance them ("Watch as
the tax base moves to Kansas,"
California Gov. )erry Brown
once remarked.) Indeed, there is
a call for federal control of wel
fare on the grounds that state
administration has been too
haphazard and irregular.
But should the federal gov
ernment give aid to the un
employed? Should we have na
tional health insurance? Ask the
man who was laid off and has
three mouths to feed at home.
Ask the person who's hos
pitalized for three months at $89
a day. These are the people that
the liberal looks out for.
