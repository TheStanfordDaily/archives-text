"It you are tired of reading I
women's novels (or biogra- I
phies) which end in mad
houses. gas ovens, car
crashes, leaps from open win
dows—then read Colette.
She will not present a re
touched picture of the world
or pretend that life is pain
less. But she will show you :
the pure and the impure,
the earthly paradise which
flourishes in an imperfect
world, the pleasures to be
snatched from the jaws of
i mortality."
