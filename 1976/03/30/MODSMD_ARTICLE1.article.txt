# H-bomb scientist raps nuclear safeguard ballot

"Positive action to eliminate the
causes of war is more helpful than
negative actions to eliminate the in
struments of war," says Edward Tel
ler, senior research fellow at the
Hoover Institution.
For this reason — and more — Tel
ler opposes Proposition 15, the Nuc
lear Safeguards Initiative, which will
appear on the California ballot in
|une. According to Teller, the initia

tive is supported "by elitists who
forget about the real problems of the
world and substitute imaginary
fears."
If Proposition 15 passes, it will be "a
very unreasonable thing with bad ef
fects on California, the United States
and even wider circles," says Teller.
Teller is often called "the father of
the hydrogen bomb."
He argues that a policy of withhold
ing nuclear technology from poor

countries makes war more rather than
less likely because it keeps those na
tions in poverty.
He says their underdevelopment
can only be eliminated by introducing
nuclear power plants, but that pas
sage of Proposition 15 would seri
ously hinder the development of nuc
lear plants.
"It is absolutely necessary to do ev
erything possible to eliminate the
enormous disparities between the
three billion people who are unim
aginably poor — almost none of whom
live in the United States — and the one
billion who are moderately well-off —
of whom many living at the higher
levels are found in the U.S.
"We should do this instead of pay
ing too much attention trying to en
force taboos (against nuclear prolifer
ation) that are not enforceable." he
says.
"I believe that nuclear pro
liferation is inevitable," hecomments,
pointing to Iran, Japan, Germany and
Brazil as countries likely to develop
nuclear capabilities.
"The hunger for energy is such that
we can't stop it,"he says. However,
"We can drop out and deny the world
our experience — especially in the
area of safety — and also lose our in
fluence to moderate the dangers in
volved."
Regarding the possibility of nuclear
accidents, Teller says,"I think we
have established a tradition of great
safety."
Fears that plutonium may remain
dangerous for its entire half-life of
25,000 years or longer are groundless,
Teller says.
"It can be burned up, used to gener
ate energy in the following few years
or decades. It can be turned into fis
sion products with much shorte*-
half-lives, and these products can be
disposed of easily," Teller avers.
