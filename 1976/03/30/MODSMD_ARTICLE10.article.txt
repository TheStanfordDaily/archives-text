# Hearst trial lost by Bailey's mistakes
##

Clark Norton

Lawyers may debate the legal
merits of the Patty Hearst case,
but to this courtroom observer
— a layman like the jury mem
bers — F. Lee Bailey lost a case
he should have won.
Hearst's overriding claim for
acquittal was that she was a
kidnap victim. She was charged
solely with voluntarily par
ticipating in an armed bank
robbery just two months after
her brutal, terrorizing abduc
tion; she had been out of her
closet prison only two weeks.
Hearst was convicted not for
the bank robbery itself, as the
comments of the jurors them
selves attest, but for her sub
sequent 17 months as a fugitive.
Proof of her intent prior to and
during the robbery was not con
clusive. Rather the government
won its case on Hearst's ac
tivities after the robbery —
which the defense tried to ans
wer with a convoluted theory of
fear and "brainwashing."
Fight hard
Bailey did fight hard to keep
such ex post facto evidence out
of the trial. But in a go-for-broke
hearing out of the jury's pre
sence he may have made a fatal
error.
Bailey put Hearst on the stand
to try to convince Judge Oliver
Carter that her post-bank rob
bery actions were involuntarily
coerced — and thus legally in
admissable as evidence. But
Carter didn't buy her story.
Once Carter allowed the Los
Angeles evidence, Bailey felt
compelled to put Hearst 011 the
stand before the jury to counter
thedamaging testimdny that she
had shot up Mel's Sporting
Coods Store. Having told Carter
in the hearing that she had acted
solely from fear during her 17
months as a fugitive, be had to
stick with that story.
By calling his client to testify,
Bailey opened up even more
damaging territory to prosecu
tion questions. One searing re
sult was that Bailey had to ad
vise his client to take the Fifth
Amendment 42 times, against
the judge's orders, to avoid in
criminating herself for alleged
crimes in Sacramento.
And the same story that had
tailed to convince Carter ulti
mately proved to be, in Pro

secutor James Browning's
words, "just too big a pill to
Extraordinary tale
Hearst asked the jury to be
lieve she had robbed, fired
weapons and kidnaped all out
of fear of the SLA — especially
William and Emily Harris, to
whom she ascribed almost mys
tical powers of control.
Hearst's testimony left no
middle ground. Everything she
had written or spoken during
her fugitive life, she claimed,
had been influenced by fear of
the Harrises.
Had Bailey been able to limit
trial evidence to the bank rob
bery itself, Hearst's tale of
duress might have held up.
Bank photos were unclear on
whether SLA guns were trained
on her.
But the legal concept of duress
applies only to fear of im
mediate bodily injury or death,
without chance of escape. Her
later actions as a fugitive could
not convincingly be explained
that way. She had many appa
rent opportunities to escape; she
was alone in a car when she
sprayed the sporting goods store
with bullets.
Boxed in
Bailey found himself boxed
in. Committed to 1 learst's tale of
duress, which left too many
questions unanswered, he
brought in three eminent
psychiatrists to depict Hearst's
fugitive life in terms of "coer
cive persuasion" and "thought
reform" (popularly known as
"brainwashing"), casting the
Harrises as villains.
Hearst had not known why
she acted as she did, the experts
said. And they compared her to
American POWs in the Korean
War.
But no matter how texfbook
perfect the psychiatrists' argu
ments. they were not enough to
overcome the doubts raised by
Hearst's own story. While not
entirely at odds, Hearst's tale of
duress and the experts' tale of
brainwashing weren't com
pletely complementary: There
are inherent contradictions be
tween the two defenses.
Duress signifies the subject
freely chooses to act because of
fear; brainwashing implies

there is no free will.
Instead of bolstering a clear,
consistent defense version of
events — centered on Hearst's
own testimony and role as vic
tim — Bailey's experts actually
muddied the issues. By bogging
the trial down in a lengthy de
bate over Hearst's months as a
fugitive, they shifted the jury's
attention from the all-important
liibernia bank robbery.
Not only was Hearst's story
hard to swallow, but she left the
jury little room to sympathize
with her if they disbelieved it.
She incriminated many of her
former associates. She re
pudiated her previous avowals
of love for slain SLA member
Willie Wolfe by branding him a
"rapist" whom she "couldn't
stand." Yet at her arrest she still
carried a Mexican figurine he
had given her over a year before.
Bailey's requests for sym
pathy toward his client had a
bo I low ring of their own. His re
lentless cross-examination of
witnesses —though technically
brilliant — may have alienated
more than dazzled the jury.
Scathing attacks
Bailey reserved his most sca
thing attacks for the prosecution

psychiatrists. Rather than ques
tioning the substance of their
testimony, he unleashed vit
riolic character assaults on
Harry Ko/.0l and Joel Fort,
whom he called a "psychopath"
and "habitual liar."
In his growing fury, Bailey
seemed ignorant of how to deal
with a San Francisco Bay Area
jury; Bailey betrayed himself as
a rude out-of-towner in this
most tolerant of American
cities.
No one can say for certain
whether the jury would have
been swayed by another de
fense. But one thing is clear:
Bailey should never have put
Hearst on the stand if she
couldn't tell a credible story.
A consistent defense em
phasizing her terror at the time
of the kidnaping, and for weeks
afterward, could have provided
a good case for diminished re
sponsibility for her later ac
tions. Hearst would have had to
blame herself more and others
less, but she would more likely
have evoked sympathy from the
jury.

Lawyers may debate the legal
merits of the Patty Hearst case,
but to this courtroom observer
— a layman like the jury mem
bers — F. Lee Bailey lost a case
he should have won.
Hearst's overriding claim for
acquittal was that she was a
kidnap victim. She was charged
solely with voluntarily par
ticipating in an armed bank
robbery just two months after
her brutal, terrorizing abduc
tion; she had been out of her
closet prison only two weeks.
Hearst was convicted not for
the bank robbery itself, as the
comments of the jurors them
selves attest, but for her sub
sequent 17 months as a fugitive.
Proof of her intent prior to and
during the robbery was not con
clusive. Rather the government
won its case on Hearst's ac
tivities after the robbery —
which the defense tried to ans
wer with a convoluted theory of
fear and "brainwashing."
Fight hard
Bailey did fight hard to keep
such ex post facto evidence out
of the trial. But in a go-for-broke
hearing out of the jury's pre
sence he may have made a fatal
error.
Bailey put Hearst on the stand
to try to convince Judge Oliver
Carter that her post-bank rob
bery actions were involuntarily
coerced — and thus legally in
admissable as evidence. But
Carter didn't buy her story.
Once Carter allowed the Los
Angeles evidence, Bailey felt
compelled to put Hearst 011 the
stand before the jury to counter
thedamaging testimdny that she
had shot up Mel's Sporting
Coods Store. Having told Carter
in the hearing that she had acted
solely from fear during her 17
months as a fugitive, be had to
stick with that story.
By calling his client to testify,
Bailey opened up even more
damaging territory to prosecu
tion questions. One searing re
sult was that Bailey had to ad
vise his client to take the Fifth
Amendment 42 times, against
the judge's orders, to avoid in
criminating herself for alleged
crimes in Sacramento.
And the same story that had
tailed to convince Carter ulti
mately proved to be, in Pro

words, "just too big a pill to
Extraordinary tale
Hearst asked the jury to be
lieve she had robbed, fired
weapons and kidnaped all out
of fear of the SLA — especially
William and Emily Harris, to
whom she ascribed almost mys
tical powers of control.
Hearst's testimony left no
middle ground. Everything she
had written or spoken during
her fugitive life, she claimed,
had been influenced by fear of
the Harrises.
Had Bailey been able to limit
trial evidence to the bank rob
bery itself, Hearst's tale of
duress might have held up.
Bank photos were unclear on
whether SLA guns were trained
on her.
But the legal concept of duress
applies only to fear of im
mediate bodily injury or death,
without chance of escape. Her
later actions as a fugitive could
not convincingly be explained
that way. She had many appa
rent opportunities to escape; she
was alone in a car when she
sprayed the sporting goods store
with bullets.
Boxed in
Bailey found himself boxed
in. Committed to 1 learst's tale of
duress, which left too many
questions unanswered, he
brought in three eminent
psychiatrists to depict Hearst's
fugitive life in terms of "coer
cive persuasion" and "thought
reform" (popularly known as
"brainwashing"), casting the
Harrises as villains.
Hearst had not known why
she acted as she did, the experts
said. And they compared her to
American POWs in the Korean
War.
But no matter how texfbook
perfect the psychiatrists' argu
ments. they were not enough to
overcome the doubts raised by
Hearst's own story. While not
entirely at odds, Hearst's tale of
duress and the experts' tale of
brainwashing weren't com
pletely complementary: There
are inherent contradictions be
tween the two defenses.
Duress signifies the subject
freely chooses to act because of
fear; brainwashing implies

there is no free will.
Instead of bolstering a clear,
consistent defense version of
events — centered on Hearst's
own testimony and role as vic
tim — Bailey's experts actually
muddied the issues. By bogging
the trial down in a lengthy de
bate over Hearst's months as a
fugitive, they shifted the jury's
attention from the all-important
liibernia bank robbery.
Not only was Hearst's story
hard to swallow, but she left the
jury little room to sympathize
with her if they disbelieved it.
She incriminated many of her
former associates. She re
pudiated her previous avowals
of love for slain SLA member
Willie Wolfe by branding him a
"rapist" whom she "couldn't
stand." Yet at her arrest she still
carried a Mexican figurine he
had given her over a year before.
Bailey's requests for sym
pathy toward his client had a
bo I low ring of their own. His re
lentless cross-examination of
witnesses —though technically
brilliant — may have alienated
more than dazzled the jury.
Scathing attacks
Bailey reserved his most sca
thing attacks for the prosecution

psychiatrists. Rather than ques
tioning the substance of their
testimony, he unleashed vit
riolic character assaults on
Harry Ko/.0l and Joel Fort,
whom he called a "psychopath"
and "habitual liar."
In his growing fury, Bailey
seemed ignorant of how to deal
with a San Francisco Bay Area
jury; Bailey betrayed himself as
a rude out-of-towner in this
most tolerant of American
cities.
No one can say for certain
whether the jury would have
been swayed by another de
fense. But one thing is clear:
Bailey should never have put
Hearst on the stand if she
couldn't tell a credible story.

Lawyers may debate the legal
merits of the Patty Hearst case,
but to this courtroom observer
— a layman like the jury mem
bers — F. Lee Bailey lost a case
he should have won.
Hearst's overriding claim for
acquittal was that she was a
kidnap victim. She was charged
solely with voluntarily par
ticipating in an armed bank
robbery just two months after
her brutal, terrorizing abduc
tion; she had been out of her
closet prison only two weeks.
Hearst was convicted not for
the bank robbery itself, as the
comments of the jurors them
selves attest, but for her sub
sequent 17 months as a fugitive.
Proof of her intent prior to and
during the robbery was not con
clusive. Rather the government
won its case on Hearst's ac
tivities after the robbery —
which the defense tried to ans
wer with a convoluted theory of
fear and "brainwashing."
Fight hard
Bailey did fight hard to keep
such ex post facto evidence out
of the trial. But in a go-for-broke
hearing out of the jury's pre
sence he may have made a fatal
error.
Bailey put Hearst on the stand
to try to convince Judge Oliver
Carter that her post-bank rob
bery actions were involuntarily
coerced — and thus legally in
admissable as evidence. But
Carter didn't buy her story.
Once Carter allowed the Los
Angeles evidence, Bailey felt
compelled to put Hearst 011 the
stand before the jury to counter
thedamaging testimdny that she
had shot up Mel's Sporting
Coods Store. Having told Carter
in the hearing that she had acted
solely from fear during her 17
months as a fugitive, be had to
stick with that story.
By calling his client to testify,
Bailey opened up even more
damaging territory to prosecu
tion questions. One searing re
sult was that Bailey had to ad
vise his client to take the Fifth
Amendment 42 times, against
the judge's orders, to avoid in
criminating herself for alleged
crimes in Sacramento.
And the same story that had
tailed to convince Carter ulti
mately proved to be, in Pro

secutor James Browning's
words, "just too big a pill to
Extraordinary tale
Hearst asked the jury to be
lieve she had robbed, fired
weapons and kidnaped all out
of fear of the SLA — especially
William and Emily Harris, to
whom she ascribed almost mys
tical powers of control.
Hearst's testimony left no
middle ground. Everything she
had written or spoken during
her fugitive life, she claimed,
had been influenced by fear of
the Harrises.
Had Bailey been able to limit
trial evidence to the bank rob
bery itself, Hearst's tale of
duress might have held up.
Bank photos were unclear on
whether SLA guns were trained
on her.
But the legal concept of duress
applies only to fear of im
mediate bodily injury or death,
without chance of escape. Her
later actions as a fugitive could
not convincingly be explained
that way. She had many appa
rent opportunities to escape; she
was alone in a car when she
sprayed the sporting goods store
with bullets.
Boxed in
Bailey found himself boxed
in. Committed to 1 learst's tale of
duress, which left too many
questions unanswered, he
brought in three eminent
psychiatrists to depict Hearst's
fugitive life in terms of "coer
cive persuasion" and "thought
reform" (popularly known as
"brainwashing"), casting the
Harrises as villains.
Hearst had not known why
she acted as she did, the experts
said. And they compared her to
American POWs in the Korean
War.
But no matter how texfbook
perfect the psychiatrists' argu
ments. they were not enough to
overcome the doubts raised by
Hearst's own story. While not
entirely at odds, Hearst's tale of
duress and the experts' tale of
brainwashing weren't com
pletely complementary: There
are inherent contradictions be
tween the two defenses.
Duress signifies the subject
freely chooses to act because of
fear; brainwashing implies

there is no free will.
Instead of bolstering a clear,
consistent defense version of
events — centered on Hearst's
own testimony and role as vic
tim — Bailey's experts actually
muddied the issues. By bogging
the trial down in a lengthy de
bate over Hearst's months as a
fugitive, they shifted the jury's
attention from the all-important
liibernia bank robbery.
Not only was Hearst's story
hard to swallow, but she left the
jury little room to sympathize
with her if they disbelieved it.
She incriminated many of her
former associates. She re
pudiated her previous avowals
of love for slain SLA member
Willie Wolfe by branding him a
"rapist" whom she "couldn't
stand." Yet at her arrest she still
carried a Mexican figurine he
had given her over a year before.
Bailey's requests for sym
pathy toward his client had a
bo I low ring of their own. His re
lentless cross-examination of
witnesses —though technically
brilliant — may have alienated
more than dazzled the jury.
Scathing attacks
Bailey reserved his most sca
thing attacks for the prosecution

psychiatrists. Rather than ques
tioning the substance of their
testimony, he unleashed vit
riolic character assaults on
Harry Ko/.0l and Joel Fort,
whom he called a "psychopath"
and "habitual liar."
In his growing fury, Bailey
seemed ignorant of how to deal
with a San Francisco Bay Area
jury; Bailey betrayed himself as
a rude out-of-towner in this
most tolerant of American
cities.
No one can say for certain
whether the jury would have
been swayed by another de

Bailey should never have put
