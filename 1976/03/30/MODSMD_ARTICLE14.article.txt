# Two studies show birth control acceptance, risk
## Predictor method okayed 
### Dave Sartoris 
According to a recent survey
ol students here, use of a reliable
ovulation predictor would be
widely accepted as a method of
birth control. The questionnaire
was designed by a group of stu
dents in the course "Biosocial
Aspects of Birth Control,"
taught by Chemistry Prof. Carl
Djerassi.
The sample population con
sisted of undergraduates, fire
men and Escondido Village re
sidents, and a total of 240 re
sponses was obtained from 700
questionnaires. Seventy-five
percent ol those surveyed indi
cated that they would use an
ovulation predictor in place of
their currently preferred
method, including 81 percent of
the males and 71 percent of the
females.
This figure rose toHH percent
after a brief description of the
advantages of such a method.
Fifty percent of the sample felt
that ovulation prediction
should be used as a birth control
method only by couples in stable
relatinships.
Survey results
According to senior Robert
bersin. the results indicate a de
sire for <m effective birth control
method which lacks the side
eflects of I he pill and the HID.

"A recent Daily article on the
rising prgnancy rate at Stanford
attributed the trend to a decreas
ing reliance on the pill. Clearly,
women have reached the point
where they not only want to con
trol their fertility, but want todo
so without jeopardizing their
health," he commented.
As a part of their investiga
tion, the student task force is
presently conducting clinical
trials on an ovulation predictor
at Synergy House. Twelve
female volunteers take daily
measurements of the glucose
concentration in their cervical
mucous, which has been found
to rise markedly just prior to
ovulation. A chemically-treated
paper known as Tes-Tape,
which changes from yellow to
dark blue-green in response to
elevated glucose levels, is
utilized in the test.
Body temperature
In addition, each subject takes
her basal body temperature just
prior to rising each morning.
According to junior Allison
Brown it is hoped that a correla
tion will be found between high
levels of glucose in the cervical
mucous and elevated body
temperature, which is known to
rise at ovulation.
"The present problem with
the basal body temperature

method is that it does not predict
ovulation but merely confirms
it," she commented.
Unsafe period
"Any method of ovulation
prediction necessarily includes
five days of a known unsafe
period," said senior Sue Sper
lich. She described the future
feasibility of detecting the
change in blood volume in the
cervix due to the rise in proges
terone just prior to ovulation,
using a device known as an
oximeter.
The group's ultimate goal was
to demonstrate that implemen
tation of a birth control program
based on ovulation prediction is
not only feasible, but also highly
desirable from-the standpoint of
the woman.
"Present methods allow
women to lead liberated lives by
controlling their fertility, but
only at the expense ol their
physical well-being. A reliable
method free ol side-effects is
imperative to successful separa
tion of their reproductive role
from their productive role and
psychological identity," said
Bersin.
The student survey turned up
several other trends concerning
birth control at Stanford.
Seventy-three percent of the
sample had used the pill at some

time, while the condom was the
second most widely used
method, fifty pecent indicated
the pill as the preferred method,
while 27 percent considered the
diaphragm most desirable.
Eighty-two percent of the
sample felt that birth control
should be the responsibility ol
both partners, while l(i percent
indicated that it should be the
female's concern and only 2
percent felt that it should be the
male's.
