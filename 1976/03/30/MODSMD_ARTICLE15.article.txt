# Heart disease risked

### Dave Sartoris 
Women who use oral contraceptives or older
women who take estrogen-only compounds are
at greater risk for heart disease than those who
do not, according to a recent Stanford study pub
lished in the current issue of the Journal of the
American Medical Association.
The study, which is based on 986 randomly
selected women aged 35 to 59 in the northern
California communities of Tracy, Gilroy and
Watsonville, is part of a three-year investigation
of heart risk factors in those communities.
Women taking birth control pills containing a
combination of estrogen and progestagen hor
mones were found to have elevated blood pres
sure as well as increased levels of serum tri
glycerides, both of which have been implicated in
heart disease risk.
Estrogen-only pills, generally taken by post
menopausal women, were shown to cause a rise
in plasma triglycerides, but had little effect on
blood pressure.
The report was co-authored by Dr. Byron W.
Hrown, Dr. John W. Farquhar, Dr. William L.
Haskell, Dr. Michael P. Stern, and Dr. Peter D.S.
Wood, all professors at the Stanford School of
Medicine and of the Stanford Heart Disease Pre
vention Program, and Dr. Clara L. Wehrle, also of
the Heart Disease Prevention Program.
According to Stern, although the results
suggest that effects are greater with oral con
traceptives than with pure estrogens, it is incor
rect to conclude that estrogen-only medications
are "safer" than combination pills.
"Estrogen-only pills are generally taken by
women in the older age range who may be more

vulnerable to heart attacks. This fact, along with
the serious lack of information about the effects
of pure estrogen, indicate a clear need for more
studies in this area." he commented.
Women taking part in the study were divided
into chicana and "other white"
categories to investigate possible ethnic differ
ences in risk factors. The report noted an appa
rently greater susceptability of chicana
women to the blood pressure effects of
oral contraceptives use. which Stern attributed to
the generally higher weight levels associated
with this group.
Systolic blood pressure was 19.9 mm higher
and diastolic pressure 9.4 mm higher in oral con
traceptive users than in non-users among these
women.
The Stanford researchers termed it "paradoxi
cal" that female hormones should increase heart
attack risk when women generally have a lower
heart attack rate than men.
"Yet undiscovered differences in metabolic ef
fects between the natural female hormonal cycle
and the artificial one produced by hormone ad
ministration may be responsible for this find
ing." commented Stern.
"The project did not try to detect actual heart
disease, but rather changes in factors, specifi
cally blood pressure and triglycerides, that are
thought to increase the risk of heart disease," he
continued.
The reports supports an early widely
publicized study by the Royal College of General
Practitioners in London, conducted in 1974.
Women taking oral contraceptives were found to
be two to two-and-a-half times more likely to
develop hypertension than those who did not
take the medication.

rect to conclude that estrogen-only medications
are "safer" than combination pills.
"Estrogen-only pills are generally taken by
women in the older age range who may be more

vulnerable to heart attacks. This fact, along with
the serious lack of information about the effects
of pure estrogen, indicate a clear need for more
studies in this area." he commented.
Women taking part in the study were divided
into chicana and "other white"
categories to investigate possible ethnic differ
ences in risk factors. The report noted an appa
rently greater susceptability of chicana
women to the blood pressure effects of
oral contraceptives use. which Stern attributed to
the generally higher weight levels associated
with this group.
Systolic blood pressure was 19.9 mm higher
and diastolic pressure 9.4 mm higher in oral con
traceptive users than in non-users among these
women.
The Stanford researchers termed it "paradoxi
cal" that female hormones should increase heart
attack risk when women generally have a lower
heart attack rate than men.
"Yet undiscovered differences in metabolic ef
fects between the natural female hormonal cycle
and the artificial one produced by hormone ad
ministration may be responsible for this find
ing." commented Stern.
"The project did not try to detect actual heart
disease, but rather changes in factors, specifi
cally blood pressure and triglycerides, that are
thought to increase the risk of heart disease," he
continued.
The reports supports an early widely
publicized study by the Royal College of General
Practitioners in London, conducted in 1974.
Women taking oral contraceptives were found to
be two to two-and-a-half times more likely to
develop hypertension than those who did not
take the medication.
Women who use oral contraceptives or older
women who take estrogen-only compounds are
at greater risk for heart disease than those who
do not, according to a recent Stanford study pub
lished in the current issue of the Journal of the
American Medical Association.
The study, which is based on 986 randomly
selected women aged 35 to 59 in the northern
California communities of Tracy, Gilroy and
Watsonville, is part of a three-year investigation
of heart risk factors in those communities.
Women taking birth control pills containing a
combination of estrogen and progestagen hor
mones were found to have elevated blood pres
sure as well as increased levels of serum tri
glycerides, both of which have been implicated in
heart disease risk.
Estrogen-only pills, generally taken by post
menopausal women, were shown to cause a rise
in plasma triglycerides, but had little effect on
blood pressure.
The report was co-authored by Dr. Byron W.
Hrown, Dr. John W. Farquhar, Dr. William L.
Haskell, Dr. Michael P. Stern, and Dr. Peter D.S.
Wood, all professors at the Stanford School of
Medicine and of the Stanford Heart Disease Pre
vention Program, and Dr. Clara L. Wehrle, also of
the Heart Disease Prevention Program.
According to Stern, although the results
suggest that effects are greater with oral con
traceptives than with pure estrogens, it is incor
rect to conclude that estrogen-only medications
are "safer" than combination pills.
