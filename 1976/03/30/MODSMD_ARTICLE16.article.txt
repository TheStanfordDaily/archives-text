# ASSU Travel begins advisory service
## 
### Kit Warfield 
If you are desperate to know
how to travel from Istanbul to
Katmandu 011 your next South
Asian trip and plan to have only
$50, then junior Susan Duggan,
the new ASSU travel adviser,
has a brochure that will tell you
how.
For those travelers concerned
about the airline regulations for
carrying bicycles among island
in Hawaii, or wondering what
Mexico's seasons are like, ASSU
Travel's new "promotional ac
tivities" coordinator, Nary
Seraichick, has initiated a series
of programs featuring slides
and speakers to help answer
these questions.
Both are part of the ASSU
Travel Service's newly ex
panded advisory program, ac
cording to Travel Service Man
ager Jay Farr. While there was
previously only one travel ad
visor, Farr hired both Duggan
and Seraichick when the job
opened up in January so ASSU
Travel could offer live programs
on the "uniqueness" of Hawaii
or the Crossroads tours to Af
rica, as well as pamphlets and
pointers on charter flights to Is
rael, buying or leasing a Volvo
in Europe, working in Germany
and one-way package tours to
Tokyo.

Seraichick. a graduate stu
dent in Russian, has already
produced "evening seminars"
on Africa and Hawaii with the
help of students and others with
a special expertise in those parts
of the world.
"People come to me with their
own slides and ideas." she exp
lains, "or they suggest that I
contact someone they heard
speak for another organization.
Then once I have an idea 1 work
on it until it's ready." with pre
sentations so far averaging once
every other week.
The program on Hawaii fea
tured Andie Gill, whose uncle
sent slides from Hawaii, with
other students answering ques
tions about their home state
after the main presentation.
Seraichick had also obtained
maps, brochures and inter
island flight schedules for those
who might need them.
Direction
"1 was very pleased with the
program," she says.."It served
its purpose well and gave
people a lot of direction for their
stay in the islands. Andie told
them about places they could
visit — and ones they couldn't
visit."
Serachick says she is excited
about future programs, such a
seminars on Czechoslovakia

and France. She says she is not
sure whether a program on
Mexico to tie in with the ASSU
charters will be possible, with
"potential speakers so busy
with papers and linals."
Even so. Farr asserts that bet
ween the to of them, the Travel
Service's new advisers can help
with any "bizarre, tar out. un
usual" trip anyone dreams up.
If one of the travel programs
doesn't answer your questions,
there is probably a resource in
Duggan's drawers — full of tour
brochures, two shelves of books,
bulging charter notebook or her
own background that will help.
"1 emphasize to people that
this is a resource center, not a
travel agency," says Duggan.
She does not deal with commer
cial flights, and cannot write out
tickets, but has information on

all kinds of ch arte rs —as wel las
the Polish Ocean Lines and
French National Railroads —
and sells International Student
ID Cards, Eurail passes, and
books ranging from the Whole
World Handbook to l.atin
American For The Hitchhiker.
Have a plan
Having spent six months
traveling and working on a farm
in France after a quarter at the
Stanford campus at Tours, Dug
gan says she thinks people
should begin any trip with some
sort of plan in mind.
Thus, she says she tries to
"pose the right questions to
stimulate their thinking" — and
hers. "1 don't know everything
about the charters or about
Europe, but if 1 know the cir
cumstances in one case I can let
that person know what his par

ticular options are and help
steer them in the right direc
tion."
If someone plans to work in
Europe, for instance. "I can tell
them what jobs they can get —
and what jobs they ain't K«t."
she says. Her advice for anpoiu 1
going to Rome is to "get oft the
train, walk straight ahead for
two blocks, then turn left and go
into the tourist office."
To provide herself more (inn
to deal with each person's travel
plan "instead of giving the same
spiel on charters 10 times .i
day," Duggan holds a weekly
"Charter Forum" to explain tlit
advantages and disadvantage
of different types of charters
That way, "when people comt
up to the office they already
have a basic idea of their alter
natives."
