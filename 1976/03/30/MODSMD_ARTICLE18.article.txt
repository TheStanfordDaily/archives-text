## Beach Blanket goes over well 
### Kathy Ellison 
You wanna talk about enter
tainment? Take, if you will, the
eyes of Marty Feldman (and rev
them up to about 450 miles per
hour). Add the smile of Carmen
Miranda. Sprinkle liberally
with a variety of stirring ac
cents. Serve with a medley of
outrageous costumes and in
genious hats . . . and you've got,
more or less, Nancy Bleiweiss,
the very eminent star of Beach
Blanket Babylon Goes Bananas.
Flank Bleiweiss with a
crowd of very talented indi
viduals. provide them with a
band of musical, black-tied
poodles, give them the direction
of Steve Silver, and you've got
your entertainment.
BBBGB has been around, in
various forms, for about two
years. It began as a group of
street musicians and singers on
Union Street, in the summer of
1973, and has now blossomed
into a superb demonstration of
talent, energy and enthusiasm
on weekends at the Club Fugazi
(678 Green St.) in San Fran
cisco.
The show is a collection of
songs ranging from "Lilac
Time" to "Tiko Tiko" to Italian
opera to "Surfin' Safari" to
"Stand By Your Man." Al
though, as one can easily see,
these songs are bound together
by no coherent theme, the
background (literally expressed
by sets like beach-scene post
cards and Sunkist Oranges) de
picts a California-pop motif.
Glinda
Bleiweiss minces across
the stage, periodically through
the show, in breath-taking per
formances of, alternately
Glinda the Good, Carmen
Miranda and a pistol-packing,
sequined Connie Stevens. She is,
almost needlessly, supported by
an operatic Mr. Peanut, three
tumbleweeds, two M&M's, one
woeful Santa Claus (who "talks
to the trees") and a crowd of sur
fers and wranglers.
In addition to these perfor
mances there are mini-skits in

which each member of the ver
satile cast demonstrates his or
her particular talent,
Thebest thing about this show
if its unexpectedness. The rec
ognition and amusement which
comes through its deliverance of
skillful parodies of California
culture is very much worth ex
periencing. And it's hard to find
such clever wit in a musical
show anywhere. The worst
thing, which is perhaps due, in
part, to the best thing, is that the
talent in the show is too uneven.
Much of the time can't help
but be spent in waiting for
Nancy Bleiweiss, or one of the
two others, to make appear
ances,when they are not on stage
at that moment. The rarity of
their talent strongly defies com
petition, so the fault becomes
forgiveable.
Ritz
Tony Michaels is one member
of the cast who comes closest to
making the show more ba
lanced, by his lively rendition of
a tap-dancing Ratzo Ritzo (who
sings, of course, "Putting on the
Ritz"), his professional singing
voice, and his pervasive charm.
One other is Glenda Glayzer,
whose talent is particularly evi
dent in her moving song, "Am I
Blue."
Themeless and uneven as it is,
Beach Blanket Babylon is still
much, much more than street art
at its best. It is a performance
that reverberates with unique
style â€” a memorable demonst
ration of clever parody and in
dividuality.
Each showing is packed,
mostly, it seems, by people who
have seen the musical several
times before. These devotees
line up in front of the Club
Fugazi each night one hour be
fore the show is scheduled; their
line extends long down the San
Francisco sidewalk as they wait
patiently in the cold night air.
If you haven't seen the show
yet, the experience as a whole is
certainly worth it. And the first
time is always the best.
