# Bookie drags on
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
Without knowing that The
Killing Of A Chinese Rookie is a
John Cassavetes film, anyone
who has seen one of his movies
can identify it as such. It has all
the trademarks, good and bad,
that he is famous for.
On the positive side, Chinese
Bookie is imitative of real life in
a truthful, depressing way, just
as A Woman Under The Influ
ence was. Its actors never seem
to be playing a role, but rather a
life that the audience is seeing
for a while.
The question that this evokes
is — do we see a film to see life or
fiction? It is, I suppose, a matter
of personal taste.
Chinese Bookie is true in de
picting life in that it is some
times exciting and sometimes
mundane, often colorful and
often only shaded in black,
white and gray. The sets reflect
the latter attitude perfectly.
However, characters and
their situations theoretically
should have some attraction for
a viewer. Why should anyonego
out of their way to see someone
whose life is no more interesting

than their own?
Further on the negative side,
Cassavetes' movies are readily
identifiable because they usu
ally continue for about 45 mi
nutes alter they've ended.
Hen Gazzara, a favorite of
Cassavetes, plays Cosmo Vitelli,
the owner of the Crazy Horse
West Saloon on the strip in Los
Angeles. The bar, with show
girls choreographed by Vitelli
himself, is his source of energy,
and his dedication to it is
foremost in his life.
The story details Vitelli's last
payment on the saloon to a loan
shark, only to go out gambling
that evening and become even
deeper in debt than before. He is
offered an alternative to the debt
— murder a mobster called the
Chinese Bookie.
Cassavetes' theme is fascinat
ing — that one can never get
ahead in life. And if one is lucky
enough to do so, fate only beats
one down further than they
were before. Unfortunately, his
situating this theme in a seamy
world of nightclubs and
gangsters in this post-Godfather
era makes it far from riveting.
