# University calls USE talks 'productive'
## 
### Jacob Young 
Officials of United Stanford
Employees (USE) and a team of Uni
versity representatives met yesterday
afternoon in what was described as a
"productive" meeting by SI.AC Direc
tor of Personnel Douglas Dupen.
According to Dupen, a University
representative to the meeting which
was requested by union officials, it
was primarily a discussion of ground
rules and suggestions for procedure
once formal contract negotiations
begin between USE and the Univer
sity.
"We spent about half the time set
ting up the ground rules and the rest
giving the union some data that they
had requested. The data concerned
the details of benefit plans and some
other details," Dupen commented.
Apparently, union officials were
seeking to clarify University policy on
several issues, among them the status
of union benefit plans sponsored by
the University, which, according to
Dupen, "benefit everyone."
Whether or not these preliminary

meetings would continue was un
clear. but Dupen called yesterday's
meeting "a one time thing."
Dupen added that USE had made it
clear to the University representatives
that the union members at the meeting
did not represent their final negotiat
ing panel. They informed the Univer
sity group that the final panel will be
chosen from USE's membership at a
later date, once the union has decided
upon its final proposals and de
mands.
Dupen also stressed that these were
only preliminary meetings and not
contract negotiations.
Apparently the date to begin formal
negotiations has not yet been deter
mined. The current USE contract ex
pires on August 31.
In May 1974, USE employes went on
strike for about three weeks. Dupen
explained that the general tone of yes
terday's meeting was good and that
there was no mention of a strike.
No comment was available yester
day from any members of the USE
group who were at the meeting.
