# 'Seven Beauties'
## Tragicomedy too strident 
### Ann Hoffman 
Italian director Lina
Wertmuller's latest film, Tlio
Seven Beauties, is riding the
wave of success from her recent
Sivept Away, a work rightly
praised for its compelling
energy and abrasive comedy.
While the social-political ideol
ogy became pleasantly garbled
and eventually subsumed by the
romantic theme in Swept A way,
Wertmuller's politics, still
somewhat garbled, dominate
The Seven Beauties, transform
ing energy into unchanneled
frenzy and comedy into strident
humor.
Hailed by many critics as a
"tragicomic" masterpiece, the
film contains some unquestion
ably brilliant moments of high
farce. Yet, as Wertmuller takes
us further into a sterile
panorama where characters are
not people but "types," poten
tial tragicomedy becomes facile
grotesquerie.
The film traces the life of Pas
qualino "Seven Beauties" from
his days as a small time big shot
in Naples to his imprisonment
in a German concentration
camp. Fixed by Giancarlo
(Jiannini, Wertmuller's peren
nial leading man, Pasqualino is
the embodiment of a perverse
will to survive at any cost,
moral or ideological.
Before the war Pasqualino
spent his time swaggering
through the streets of Naples
with a carnation in his lapel, de
fending the supposed honor of
his seven obese sisters, the "se
ven beauties." One night he
shoots the pimp, Totonno. who
has turned one of his all-too
willing sisters into a prostitute.
Forced to dispose of Totonno
"imaginatively," Pasqualino
cuts the body into pieces, and
sends it north in three different
suitcases. He is arrested, how
ever, and gains instant fame as
the "monster of Naples."
Though Pasqualino has commit
ted his heinous crime in the
name of "honor," he is easily

persuaded to plead insanity in
order to avoid the death penalty.
Mental
I lere begins Pasqualino's suc
cessful career as an opportunist
and a survivor. Confined to a
mental institution, he seizes a
seemingly auspicious opportun
ity, raping one of the woman pa
tients as she lies tied to her bed.
Punished for this act, Pasquilino
volunteers for the army, feeling
certain that the war is bound to
be an improvement over the in
stitution.
As a soldier, Pasqualino is
captured by the Germans and
taken to a concentration camp,
the horror of which shocks even
the former "monster of Naples."
Pasqualino, the victimizer, has
suddenly become the victim.
Reaching a point where he is
more dead than alive, Pas
qualino makes one last audaci
ous move to survive, attempting
to seduce the camp's leviathan
woman commandant (played by
Shirley Stoler). After forcing
him to carry out his intention,
the commandant offers to save
Pasqualino if he participates in
the slaughter of his fellow pris
oners.
As the film closes, a hardened
Pasqualino returns to Naples
only to find all seven of his sis
ters, as well as the girl he loves,
have become whores. He prop
oses to the girl, stating that they
should have many children in
order to "defend" themselves
against the rest of the world.
Worm
This ending leaves us uncer
tain — has Pasqualino been
changed for the better by his ex
periences, or is he merely with
drawing from them? Wertmul
ler herself does not seem to
know. Though Pasqualino is
clearly a despicable worm, we
are invited nonetheless to ad
mire him for his endurance.
Despite the often shrill quality
of the film, Giannini manages
his difficult role well, playing
the gamut from the intolerably

vain man-about-Naples to the
whimpering emaciated pris
oner of the concentration camp.
The film has received widat-l
spread and disconcerting criti-,
cal acclaim as a highly "origi-}
nal" work. While Swept Away'
used many old themes, the
stereotyped situations were
never allowed to crystallize be
cause they were always being
inverted and parodied. In The
Seven Beauties, however,
Wertmuller merely adds the
dimension of the grotesque and
the surreal tothecliched and the
stereotyped, hardly an original
feat.
Responding to the charge that
her politics detract from her
films, Wertmuller said in a re
cent interview that "ideology
must not devour, but illuminate,
art." Fortunately ideology has
not wholly devoured The Seven
Beauties, for the film displays
several masterful, cinematic
scenes. As the film reveals its
final shape, however, one
wishes for more illumination
and less heat.

are invited nonetheless to ad

vain man-about-Naples to the

spread and disconcerting criti-,
cal acclaim as a highly "origi-}

used many old themes, the
stereotyped situations were
never allowed to crystallize be
cause they were always being
inverted and parodied. In The
Seven Beauties, however,
Wertmuller merely adds the
dimension of the grotesque and
the surreal tothecliched and the
stereotyped, hardly an original
feat.
Responding to the charge that
her politics detract from her
films, Wertmuller said in a re
cent interview that "ideology
must not devour, but illuminate,
art." Fortunately ideology has
not wholly devoured The Seven
Beauties, for the film displays
several masterful, cinematic
scenes. As the film reveals its
final shape, however, one
wishes for more illumination

FAT — Shirley Stoler as the Commandant in Lina Wertmuller's
Seven Beauties makes it with sexy sloe-eyed Giancarlo Giannini in
this poignant politico-comedy.
Italian director Lina
Wertmuller's latest film, Tlio
Seven Beauties, is riding the
wave of success from her recent
Sivept Away, a work rightly
praised for its compelling
energy and abrasive comedy.
While the social-political ideol
ogy became pleasantly garbled
and eventually subsumed by the
romantic theme in Swept A way,
Wertmuller's politics, still
somewhat garbled, dominate
The Seven Beauties, transform
ing energy into unchanneled
frenzy and comedy into strident
humor.
Hailed by many critics as a
"tragicomic" masterpiece, the
film contains some unquestion
ably brilliant moments of high
farce. Yet, as Wertmuller takes
us further into a sterile
panorama where characters are
not people but "types," poten
tial tragicomedy becomes facile
grotesquerie.
The film traces the life of Pas
qualino "Seven Beauties" from
his days as a small time big shot
in Naples to his imprisonment
in a German concentration
camp. Fixed by Giancarlo
(Jiannini, Wertmuller's peren
nial leading man, Pasqualino is
the embodiment of a perverse
will to survive at any cost,
moral or ideological.
Before the war Pasqualino
spent his time swaggering
through the streets of Naples
with a carnation in his lapel, de
fending the supposed honor of
his seven obese sisters, the "se
ven beauties." One night he
shoots the pimp, Totonno. who
has turned one of his all-too
willing sisters into a prostitute.
Forced to dispose of Totonno
"imaginatively," Pasqualino
cuts the body into pieces, and
sends it north in three different
suitcases. He is arrested, how
ever, and gains instant fame as
the "monster of Naples."
Though Pasqualino has commit
ted his heinous crime in the
name of "honor," he is easily

persuaded to plead insanity in
order to avoid the death penalty.

Italian director Lina
Wertmuller's latest film, Tlio
Seven Beauties, is riding the
wave of success from her recent
Sivept Away, a work rightly
praised for its compelling
energy and abrasive comedy.
While the social-political ideol
ogy became pleasantly garbled
and eventually subsumed by the
romantic theme in Swept A way,
Wertmuller's politics, still
somewhat garbled, dominate
The Seven Beauties, transform
ing energy into unchanneled
frenzy and comedy into strident
humor.
Hailed by many critics as a
"tragicomic" masterpiece, the
film contains some unquestion
ably brilliant moments of high
farce. Yet, as Wertmuller takes
us further into a sterile
panorama where characters are
not people but "types," poten
tial tragicomedy becomes facile
grotesquerie.
The film traces the life of Pas
qualino "Seven Beauties" from
his days as a small time big shot
in Naples to his imprisonment
in a German concentration
camp. Fixed by Giancarlo
(Jiannini, Wertmuller's peren
nial leading man, Pasqualino is
the embodiment of a perverse
will to survive at any cost,
moral or ideological.
Before the war Pasqualino
spent his time swaggering
through the streets of Naples
with a carnation in his lapel, de
fending the supposed honor of
his seven obese sisters, the "se
ven beauties." One night he
shoots the pimp, Totonno. who
has turned one of his all-too
willing sisters into a prostitute.
Forced to dispose of Totonno
"imaginatively," Pasqualino
cuts the body into pieces, and
sends it north in three different
suitcases. He is arrested, how
ever, and gains instant fame as
the "monster of Naples."
Though Pasqualino has commit
ted his heinous crime in the
name of "honor," he is easily

persuaded to plead insanity in
order to avoid the death penalty.
Mental
I lere begins Pasqualino's suc
cessful career as an opportunist
and a survivor. Confined to a
mental institution, he seizes a
seemingly auspicious opportun
ity, raping one of the woman pa
tients as she lies tied to her bed.
Punished for this act, Pasquilino
volunteers for the army, feeling
certain that the war is bound to
be an improvement over the in
stitution.
As a soldier, Pasqualino is
captured by the Germans and
taken to a concentration camp,
the horror of which shocks even
the former "monster of Naples."
Pasqualino, the victimizer, has
suddenly become the victim.
Reaching a point where he is
more dead than alive, Pas
qualino makes one last audaci
ous move to survive, attempting
to seduce the camp's leviathan
woman commandant (played by
Shirley Stoler). After forcing
him to carry out his intention,
the commandant offers to save
Pasqualino if he participates in
the slaughter of his fellow pris
oners.
As the film closes, a hardened
Pasqualino returns to Naples
only to find all seven of his sis
ters, as well as the girl he loves,
have become whores. He prop
oses to the girl, stating that they
should have many children in
order to "defend" themselves
against the rest of the world.
Worm
This ending leaves us uncer
tain — has Pasqualino been
changed for the better by his ex
periences, or is he merely with
drawing from them? Wertmul
ler herself does not seem to
know. Though Pasqualino is
clearly a despicable worm, we
are invited nonetheless to ad
mire him for his endurance.
Despite the often shrill quality
of the film, Giannini manages
his difficult role well, playing
the gamut from the intolerably

vain man-about-Naples to the
whimpering emaciated pris
oner of the concentration camp.
