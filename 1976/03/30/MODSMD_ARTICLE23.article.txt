John Denver will not be giving a
concert early this summer at Stanford
Stadium, according to Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president for uni
versity relations, because Denver's
contract with rock promoter Bill
Graham for an appearance in the Hay
Area specified a weekday, when the
stadium would not be available.
The stadium, which seats over
HO.000 persons, has never been used
for a rock concert since it was built
and was being considered for
such use in the case of folksinger De
nver because he is, according to Tom
Bacchetti, director of Public Events,
"as safe an act as anyone can conceive
of."
In order for the stadium to be used
for a rock concert, a whole array of
persons have to be persuaded that
problems of security and crowd con
trol will be kept to manageable pro

portions, he said.
Bacchetti said he felt Denver would
satisfy these individual hit th.it any
other performer or group now availa
ble would not. "Denver," he said, "is
the only act we are ready to consider
now." He would not divulge the
names of other groups suggested,hut
said they are not considered suffi
ciently safe.
There are no current plans to
negotiate contracts to appear at the
stadium with any other acts, said Bac
chetti.
The persons who have to he con
vinced that stadium concerts will re
main peaceful "include the president
of the University, for one," said Bac
chetti. First of all, he added he himself
would have to be convinced. After
that, loe Kuetz, director of physical
education and athletics, would have
to approve, as would the Director of
Public Safety Marvin Herrington.


(iIANT RlPOFF—lmprovements began last week on Cial
vez St. between Campus Drive and Serra St., when
Freeman-Sondgroth paving contractors tore up the old
paving. The east side of the street will be turned into
landscaping and bicycle-pedestrian |)ath, while the west

side will become a new two-lane road. Traffic was con
gested yesterday as students returned to campus and will
probably remain that way until construction is completed
around May 1.
