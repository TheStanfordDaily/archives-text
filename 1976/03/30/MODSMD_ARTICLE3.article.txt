## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Jack Nicholson, the rebel
ring-leader of a mental hospital, and Louise
Fletcher, his flint-hearted antagonist, won best
actor and actress Oscars last night fortheir roles in
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."
A tale of life inside a state mental hospital,
"Cuckoo's Nest" also won as best picture of 1975
and for best direction by Milos Forman and for
writers Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman.
It was the first time since "It Happened One
Night" in 1934 that one picture swept all the major
awards.
Supporting awards
The awards for best supporting performers went
to Lee Grant, the adulterous Hollywood wife in
"Shampoo" and George Burns, the vaudevillian
comic brought out of retirement in "The Sunshine
Boys."
"Well, 1 guess this proves there are as many nuts
in the Academy as there are anywhere else," grin
ned Nicholson as he claimed his award. The New
Jersey-born actor won in his fifth nomination.
In one of the most sensitive moments in Oscar's
48-year history, Fletcher ended her speech by
tal king and using sign language at the same time.

Her parents are both deaf mutes.
Burns, 80, said, "I've been in show business all
my life.and I've.loved every moment of it. It proves
one thing — stay in the business long enough and
get to be old enough, you get to be new again."
For Burns it was the height of a long and distin
guished career as a funnyman and a sentimental
moment for him. I le won the role in "The Sunshine
Boys," after it fell vacant with the death of his best
friend, Jack Benny.
Grant, wearing what she said was a "second
hand wedding dress," won her Oscar 25 years
after being nominated for the best supporting role
in "Detective Story."
After that, her career fell into an eclipse because,
she has said, she was blacklisted for her political
views.
Gazing at her Oscar on the Music Center stage,
shesaid:"l think wehad a fight 20years ago,but he
has changed."
Other awards
"Su Uzala," Russian film, won the best foreign
language film award.
The awards telecast got off to a refreshing start
with a production number starring Ray Bolger,

"Hollywood Honors Its Own."
The 72-year-old hoofer pranced outside and on
the stage of the Music Center with as much vigor as
he displayed when he was the scarecrow in "The
Wizard of Oz."
The academy presented a previously announced
award to the miracle makers of "The Hindenburg"
for special visual effects.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Jack Nicholson, the rebel
ring-leader of a mental hospital, and Louise
Fletcher, his flint-hearted antagonist, won best
actor and actress Oscars last night fortheir roles in
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."
A tale of life inside a state mental hospital,
"Cuckoo's Nest" also won as best picture of 1975
and for best direction by Milos Forman and for
writers Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman.
It was the first time since "It Happened One
Night" in 1934 that one picture swept all the major
awards.
Supporting awards
The awards for best supporting performers went
to Lee Grant, the adulterous Hollywood wife in
"Shampoo" and George Burns, the vaudevillian
comic brought out of retirement in "The Sunshine
Boys."
"Well, 1 guess this proves there are as many nuts
in the Academy as there are anywhere else," grin
ned Nicholson as he claimed his award. The New
Jersey-born actor won in his fifth nomination.
In one of the most sensitive moments in Oscar's
48-year history, Fletcher ended her speech by
tal king and using sign language at the same time.

Her parents are both deaf mutes.
Burns, 80, said, "I've been in show business all
my life.and I've.loved every moment of it. It proves
one thing — stay in the business long enough and
get to be old enough, you get to be new again."
For Burns it was the height of a long and distin
guished career as a funnyman and a sentimental
moment for him. I le won the role in "The Sunshine
Boys," after it fell vacant with the death of his best
friend, Jack Benny.
Grant, wearing what she said was a "second
hand wedding dress," won her Oscar 25 years
after being nominated for the best supporting role
in "Detective Story."
After that, her career fell into an eclipse because,
she has said, she was blacklisted for her political
views.
Gazing at her Oscar on the Music Center stage,
shesaid:"l think wehad a fight 20years ago,but he
has changed."
Other awards
"Su Uzala," Russian film, won the best foreign
language film award.
The awards telecast got off to a refreshing start
with a production number starring Ray Bolger,

"Hollywood Honors Its Own."
