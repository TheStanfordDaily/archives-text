# Dead Week action cited
## UGLY disrupters warned 
### Lori Matsukawa 
Students who took part in the dis
turbances in Meyer Undergraduate
Library during Dead Week last quar
ter will not be prosecuted by the Uni
versity for violating the Campus Dis
ruption Policy, University legal ad
viser to the president James Siena
said yesterday.
The reasonfor lack of legal action at
this time is not due to lack of evidence,
rather that students were unaware
their disruptive actions are punisha
ble under the policy on campus dis
ruptions,he said,
"It would be unfair to start off giv
ing notice (to students) by prosecuting
them," said Siena.

As a result, notices dated March 13,
1976, have been posted at Meyer Lib
rary warning that students who inter
fere with library services and
facilities by making excessively dis
turbing sounds or physical behavior
will be prosecuted by the University
through the Stanford Judicial Coun
cil (SJC).
The SJC is a body composed of fa
culty and students. Student majorities
are present only in Honor Code viola
tion cases and not in campus disrup
tion cases. Students may also choose
to appear before Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons.

Meyer Chief Librarian Elizabeth
Salzar said although she did not wit
ness the disruptions herself, library
supervisors noted in the library logs
that on Thursday, March 11, a student
did a take-off of George C. Scott play
ing Ceneral Patton, a Guys and Dolls
routine was performed and some
water balloons were thrown.
On Friday, March 12, there was no
staged demonstration, but papers,
toilet paper, rotten apples, lettuce arid
popcorn were thrown over the third
and fourth level balconies onto the
second floor.
On the next day, no garbage
but a few books were thrown over the
balconies and an Oriental dance
routine was performed on the re
served books desk by several students.

On Sunday, March 14, objects were
again thrown over the balconies and
the "William Tell Overture" was
played loudly on a stereo.
"I don't know how they got the
stereo in here," said Salzar.
'Study breaks'
"Some of the students 1 have talked
to said they enjoyed these activities as
study breaks," said Salzar, "but year
by year the disruptions vary and some
of them have been upsetting to those
who work here and to students who
want to study. This is the first year
that garbage was thrown."
"The problem is how to control and
limit the 'breaks' to 10-15 minutes.
Because of the architecture (of the lib
rary) and the cheers and jeers of the
students watching, the disruptions
can last up to two hours," she said.
A survey taken last spring by the
library system to evaluate library
books and services indicated that
most users of Meyer Library found
two major problems with the library,
said Salzar.
"First, the facility is too quiet. There
are no noises like air conditioning or
other natural noises to cover up the
tapping of pencils and footsteps. The
other problem is the occasional dis
ruption in the library," she said.
Siena said if such disturbances
occur during Dead Week this quarter,
prosecution will be imminent.

"It would be unfair to start off giv

them," said Siena.

As a result, notices dated March 13,
1976, have been posted at Meyer Lib
rary warning that students who inter
fere with library services and
facilities by making excessively dis
turbing sounds or physical behavior
will be prosecuted by the University
through the Stanford Judicial Coun
cil (SJC).
The SJC is a body composed of fa
culty and students. Student majorities
are present only in Honor Code viola
tion cases and not in campus disrup
tion cases. Students may also choose
to appear before Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons.

Meyer Chief Librarian Elizabeth
Salzar said although she did not wit
ness the disruptions herself, library
supervisors noted in the library logs
that on Thursday, March 11, a student
did a take-off of George C. Scott play
ing Ceneral Patton, a Guys and Dolls
routine was performed and some
water balloons were thrown.
On Friday, March 12, there was no
staged demonstration, but papers,
toilet paper, rotten apples, lettuce arid
popcorn were thrown over the third
and fourth level balconies onto the
second floor.
On the next day, no garbage
but a few books were thrown over the
balconies and an Oriental dance
routine was performed on the re
served books desk by several students.

On Sunday, March 14, objects were
again thrown over the balconies and
the "William Tell Overture" was
played loudly on a stereo.
"I don't know how they got the
stereo in here," said Salzar.
'Study breaks'
"Some of the students 1 have talked
to said they enjoyed these activities as
study breaks," said Salzar, "but year
by year the disruptions vary and some
of them have been upsetting to those
who work here and to students who
want to study. This is the first year
that garbage was thrown."
"The problem is how to control and
limit the 'breaks' to 10-15 minutes.
Because of the architecture (of the lib
rary) and the cheers and jeers of the
students watching, the disruptions
can last up to two hours," she said.
A survey taken last spring by the
library system to evaluate library
books and services indicated that
most users of Meyer Library found
two major problems with the library,
said Salzar.
"First, the facility is too quiet. There
are no noises like air conditioning or
other natural noises to cover up the
tapping of pencils and footsteps. The
other problem is the occasional dis
ruption in the library," she said.
Siena said if such disturbances
occur during Dead Week this quarter,
prosecution will be imminent.

Students who took part in the dis
turbances in Meyer Undergraduate
Library during Dead Week last quar

versity for violating the Campus Dis
ruption Policy, University legal ad
viser to the president James Siena
said yesterday.
The reasonfor lack of legal action at
this time is not due to lack of evidence,
rather that students were unaware
