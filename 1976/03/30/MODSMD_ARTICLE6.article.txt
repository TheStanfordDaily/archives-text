# Faculty Senate may act on AAUP proposals
## 
### William Ross 
The Faculty Senate is expected to
act this spring on recommendations to
establish fixed terms for deans of
schools and chairpersons of depart
ments and the publication of more
explicit faculty salary information,ac
cording to Robert Textor, professor of
education and anthropology.
Textor, who is also chairman of the
Stanford chapter of the American As
sociation of University Professors
(AAUP),said the association adopted
a resolution last month calling for the
establishment of a five-year term for
deans of schools and three-year terms
for heads of departments. He added
both terms would be renewable once.
"It is a recognized principle of
democratic administration that such
an academic administrator should
serve for a term long enough to permit
effectiveness but not so long as to risk
abuse of his or her powers," the AAUP
recommendation said. "It is generally
recognized that an academic adminis
trator can, through long service, be
come out oftouch with the needs ofthe
faculty he or she is charged to serve."
The AAUP also recommended mak
ing a consultation with each member
of the Academic Council in a depart
ment or school mandatory prior to
every such appointment or renewal.
The recommendations were refer
red to the Advisory Board by the Fa
culty Senate Steering Committee. Tex
tor said.
Already published
Although average salaries in each
school already are published, the
AAUP contends that such data is not
meaningful because it is not broken
down according to department and
rank. Textor said.
The AAUP recommended publish
ing both median and mean salaries for
.ill faculty groups for each rank, de
partment. division and school, except

when the number of faculty members
is so few that such publication would
"come too close to revealing indi
vidual salaries."
The AAUP also called for publica
tion of salary information for various
administrative categories, except for
those categories in which there are
fewer than four administrators and
such publication would thus tend to
reveal individual salaries.
'Essential information'
"We think this information (about
faculty salaries) is essential to achieve
equity and understanding in the mat
ter of salaries at all times, but espe
cially in a period of inflated cost of
living and tight money within the
University," the AAUP recommenda
tion said.
"Such information would enable
members of the faculty who are in fact
underpaid to seek a fair adjustment
from their chairpersons or deans. It
would also enable those who worry
that they are underpaid but are in fact
not — a phenomemon possibly more
widespread than actual inequity — to
dispense with a worry that can easily
weaken morale," the recommenda
tion said.
It also contended that if salaries are
to be used to motivate and reward
meritorious achievement, faculty
members must know how their
achievement is evaluated by their
chairpersons or deans as reflected in
salaries.
At a sparsely attended AAUP meet
ing earlier this month, several associ
ation members argued that the re
commendation did not go far enough.
They contended that the University
should publish information about in
dividual faculty salaries.
Other AAUP members at the meet
ing said that such publication is un
necessary since any professor who
wishes to do so may reveal his salary.

act this spring on recommendations to
establish fixed terms for deans of
schools and chairpersons of depart
ments and the publication of more
explicit faculty salary information,ac
cording to Robert Textor, professor of
education and anthropology.
Textor, who is also chairman of the
Stanford chapter of the American As
sociation of University Professors
(AAUP),said the association adopted
a resolution last month calling for the
establishment of a five-year term for
deans of schools and three-year terms
for heads of departments. He added
both terms would be renewable once.
"It is a recognized principle of
democratic administration that such
an academic administrator should
serve for a term long enough to permit
effectiveness but not so long as to risk
abuse of his or her powers," the AAUP
recommendation said. "It is generally
recognized that an academic adminis
trator can, through long service, be
come out oftouch with the needs ofthe
faculty he or she is charged to serve."
The AAUP also recommended mak
ing a consultation with each member
of the Academic Council in a depart
ment or school mandatory prior to
every such appointment or renewal.
The recommendations were refer
red to the Advisory Board by the Fa
culty Senate Steering Committee. Tex
tor said.
Already published
Although average salaries in each
school already are published, the
AAUP contends that such data is not
meaningful because it is not broken
down according to department and
rank. Textor said.
The AAUP recommended publish
ing both median and mean salaries for
.ill faculty groups for each rank, de
partment. division and school, except

when the number of faculty members
is so few that such publication would
"come too close to revealing indi
vidual salaries."
The AAUP also called for publica
tion of salary information for various
administrative categories, except for
those categories in which there are
fewer than four administrators and
such publication would thus tend to
reveal individual salaries.
'Essential information'
"We think this information (about
faculty salaries) is essential to achieve
equity and understanding in the mat
ter of salaries at all times, but espe
cially in a period of inflated cost of
living and tight money within the
University," the AAUP recommenda
tion said.
"Such information would enable
members of the faculty who are in fact
underpaid to seek a fair adjustment
from their chairpersons or deans. It
would also enable those who worry
that they are underpaid but are in fact
not — a phenomemon possibly more
widespread than actual inequity — to
dispense with a worry that can easily
weaken morale," the recommenda
tion said.
It also contended that if salaries are
to be used to motivate and reward
meritorious achievement, faculty
members must know how their
achievement is evaluated by their
chairpersons or deans as reflected in
salaries.
At a sparsely attended AAUP meet
ing earlier this month, several associ
ation members argued that the re
commendation did not go far enough.
They contended that the University
should publish information about in
dividual faculty salaries.
Other AAUP members at the meet
ing said that such publication is un
necessary since any professor who
wishes to do so may reveal his salary.
