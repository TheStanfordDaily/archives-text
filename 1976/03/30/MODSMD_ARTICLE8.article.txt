# Letters: Kissinger, Hills

Kissinger's folly
I sen that Henry Kissinger, in
His infinite wisdom, has de
cideci lli.it it would In; in the in
terest of the United States to
help prop up an illegal regime
in Zimbabwe, a regime recog
nized by something like two
countries in the entire world.
Supporters of his decision
explain either that (a) since the
Soviet Union is against the
white minority elite govern
ment. the United Stiites should
be for it: or (b) the Africans .ire
not yet ready for self
government.
Apparently, Henry is per
fectly prepared to pick up the
white man's burden again.
Perhaps i te is right.
The United States can send
clergymen to civilize these sav
ages and ships to continue help
ing the government by import
ing Khodesian chrome in viola
tion of mandatory United Na
tions sanctions. I cannot recall
the last time the United States
government demonstrated such
concern for .1 third world na
tion.
That's why this decision is so
heartwarming. It brings back
fond memories of other United
States interests in the smaller
nations of the world.
The good old days when the
U.S. government overthrew the
legally elected government of
Chile. The fun times when the
Marines invaded the Dominican
Republic. The nostalgic assas
sination attempts on Fidel Cas
tro. And who could forget the
exciting decision to intervene in
Angola?
I take it all back. I lenry is only
acting in the best tradition of
\merican diplomacy, and is
demonstrating once again that

not only does the United States
know best for the rest of the
world, but this nation is not af
raid to do something about it.
And <11 this r.ite, who knows?
•Vlaybe Henry will one day (are
you ready for this?) actually
\ isi( one of those third world
nations. Hut, no, that would be
unwise: All bis fans there, made
so happy by U.S.intervention in
their countries, might tear him
apart in their pro-United States
fervor. The head of state must
not be exposed to the rabble.

History
Hills for president
A recent Callup Foil found
that 7'.i pecent of adults ques
tioned would be willing to vote
lor a qualified woman for presi
dent.
Would a person worthy of a
seat on the United States Sup
reme Court be so qualified?
The resplendence of the na
tional political party who would
forget petty politics and patron
age would outshine the Taj
Mahal. Foreign and domestic
policies would prosper under
the direction of the most qual
ified of all potential candidates
of both major national parties.
Carl a Hills, secretary of
housing and urban develop
ment, is so qualified. It has
never been made public if she
declined a seat on the U.S. Sup
reme Cou rt, but she was the first
woman considered to replace
retiring Supreme Court Justice
William O. Douglas — certainly
the height of qualification.
Our country and its people
today need more than a profes
sional politician as president.
President Cerald Ford is in no

sense an incumbent, a direct
choice of the people.
It can't be denied that Ford
was picked by both major par
ties on a nice guy status to mind
the store until the next general
election. Were Ford presidential
calibre it would have surfaced
long before Watergate.
Ronald Reagan has played
many roles, but if it's a good
actor we're looking for, what
about John Wayne. Reagan's
ability to govern must take a
back seat to the present gover
nor of California, Jerry Brown.
The widely respected Field poll
gives an 84 percent rating to
lirown — better ever than to
Ronald Reagan. And in the cur
rent fiscal year, the state is run
ning a $4 00 million surplus,
with no increase in taxes.
The innate ability and
charisma of Sen. Howard Baker
(R-Tenn.) would also enhance
the calm jurisprudence of Hills.
The country needs them and as a
team, if they'd run, they would
have won: by a landslide.
The probable joining of Ford
and Reagan offers no plus to the
country, the people or the party.
The people must have a choice
not an ultimatum.

Shuttle buses
There are several points about
the Marguerite evening
shuttle-bus service which need
to be clarified.
Although these buses do con
tribute to the safety of both men
and women on campus at night,
this is a very small step, leaving
many problems unsolved. For
instance, people needing to
travel after midnight, and
people living in Escondido or
off-campus, benefit little from
the service.
It is important to work for
other improvements, such as
better lighting on campus.
Second, it is important to
realize that the buses are only
assigned to the evening route on
a trial basis, until the end of Ap
ril. Although it is difficult to
change our patterns of transpor
tation, especially in the middle
of the year, we should make an
effort to use the buses whenever
they are convenient — other
wise, this service will no longer
be available at times when we
want it.
We're especially pleased with
the idea that's been catching 011,
ot having study breaks or meet
ing friends on the buses — this is
an excellent way for people to
become more familiar with the
bus service and feel more com
fortable about using it.
