# USE blasts University's 'hard line'
## 
### Jacob Young 
United Stanford Employees (USE)
Public Relations Officer Roger Hardy
yesterday sharply criticized several
positions taken by the University in
Monday's pre-negotiation contract
meeting.
Commenting on the meeting, Hardy
said, "The meeting was useful in the
sense that it gave us a view of the Uni
versity's hard line."
USE and the University met to dis
cuss ground rules for formal negotia
tion of the next union contract with
the University and for the University
to provide the union with data to be
used in making their contract de
mands. The present USE contract ex
pires on August 31.
SLAC Director of Personnel and
University representative to the meet
ing Douglas Dupen said Monday night
thatthetoneofthe talks was good and
labeled them "productive."
University Staff Counsel for
Employe Relations Douglas Barton
•said last night, "In terms of the resolu
tion of questions, it was not produc
tive. But in terms of an exchange of
views, it was a very productive meet
ing."
"USE disagrees pretty vehemently
with the University's assessment of
the meeting as 'productive.' We feel it
was almost totally non-productive.
About one half the time was spent
with Barton not giving us the informa
tion we requested," Hardy said.
According to Hardy, the pre
negotiation meeting "established the
tenor of the talks" and was less than
friendly. Hardy felt that the Universi
ty's position was "not that much diffe
rent from the last time," referring to
talks of two years ago.
If the situation between the two
groups doesn't improve, the union
has not ruled out a strike. Hardy said
of the University's apparent reluc
tance to give them information,
"The University's tactic is not to give
an inch and then act shocked when we
go out on strike. If the University's
position is non-negotiable (not giving
USE requested information, but wait
ing for the union to make demands),
the chances are that our position is
(also) non-negotiable."
USE has been concerned over sev
eral issues, among them the Univer
sity benefit program. These include
three basic medical plans, a major
medical plan and life insurance
coverage.
The major source of controversy has
been the union pension plan. The
University takes a percentage of each
worker's salary each year, which
changes from year to year, depending
on the average age of the union
employes.
USE wants a unit-cost breakdown
for this plan. Hardy said he wanted a
percentage breakdown of the deduc
tions, adding, "If they're paying 10
percent of the worker's salary to buy
this, we would rather go out and get a
plan of our own. We would rather
have the money in cash."

talks of two years ago.
If the situation between the two
groups doesn't improve, the union
has not ruled out a strike. Hardy said
of the University's apparent reluc
tance to give them information,
"The University's tactic is not to give
an inch and then act shocked when we
go out on strike. If the University's
position is non-negotiable (not giving
USE requested information, but wait
ing for the union to make demands),
the chances are that our position is
(also) non-negotiable."
USE has been concerned over sev
eral issues, among them the Univer
sity benefit program. These include
three basic medical plans, a major
medical plan and life insurance
coverage.
The major source of controversy has
been the union pension plan. The
University takes a percentage of each
worker's salary each year, which
changes from year to year, depending
on the average age of the union
employes.
USE wants a unit-cost breakdown
for this plan. Hardy said he wanted a
percentage breakdown of the deduc
tions, adding, "If they're paying 10
percent of the worker's salary to buy
this, we would rather go out and get a
plan of our own. We would rather
have the money in cash."
United Stanford Employees (USE)
Public Relations Officer Roger Hardy
yesterday sharply criticized several
positions taken by the University in
Monday's pre-negotiation contract
meeting.
Commenting on the meeting, Hardy
said, "The meeting was useful in the
sense that it gave us a view of the Uni
versity's hard line."
USE and the University met to dis
cuss ground rules for formal negotia
tion of the next union contract with
the University and for the University
to provide the union with data to be
used in making their contract de
mands. The present USE contract ex
pires on August 31.
SLAC Director of Personnel and
University representative to the meet
ing Douglas Dupen said Monday night
thatthetoneofthe talks was good and
labeled them "productive."
University Staff Counsel for
Employe Relations Douglas Barton
•said last night, "In terms of the resolu
tion of questions, it was not produc
tive. But in terms of an exchange of
views, it was a very productive meet
ing."
"USE disagrees pretty vehemently
with the University's assessment of
the meeting as 'productive.' We feel it
was almost totally non-productive.
About one half the time was spent
with Barton not giving us the informa
tion we requested," Hardy said.
According to Hardy, the pre
negotiation meeting "established the
tenor of the talks" and was less than
friendly. Hardy felt that the Universi
ty's position was "not that much diffe
rent from the last time," referring to
talks of two years ago.
