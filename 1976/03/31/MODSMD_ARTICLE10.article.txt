# Political balance

Lewis Gann

Moral and political obliga
tions depend on reciprocity. I
should therefore be delighted to
support the appointment of
Marxist-Leninists like Angela
Davis and Ernest Mandel as
ASSU guest professors, pro
vided Davis and Mandel were
willing to extend reciprocal
treatment to me, as an opponent
of Marxism-Leninism.
(Perhaps, Davis for instance,
might use her connections with
the academic authorities of the
German Democratic Republic to
facilitate reciprocal treatment
for opponents of the Marxist-
Leninist position in. say, the
Humboldt Universitat in East

Berlin or the Karl-Marx-
Universitat in Leipzig.)
I warmly agree, moreover,
that all political and
philosophical viewpoints
should be heard in an American
university.
I am, however, concerned that
the liberal-left wing points of
view are heavily over
represented. and conservative
viewpoints are heavily under
represented in relation to their
numbers in the country at large.
This imbalance cannot help but
exert a debilitating influence on
the academe.
