# Fraternity life worth considering
##

Stanford fraternities begin
their annual "rush" next week,
and it would behoove eligible
males to give ample considera
tion to each of the system's 13
distinct houses.
The rushing process is one in
which the onus is on fraternity
houses to seek out new mem
bers, not the other way around.
First impressions to the con
trary, the fraternity members
are the rushers,while interested
men are the rushees.
The distinction is an impor
tant one; those interested should
feel free to sample what any of
the houses have to offer, without
feeling any sense of intrusion.
Events such as open houses offer
an enjoyable means for judging
the merits of respective houses
without obligation.
At the conclusion of four
weeks of activities, houses will
offer "bids," or invitations to
membership, to those rushees
which the members believe have
the most to offer to diversified
life in the fraternity. Rushees
are then able to choose, from
among their bids, the house
which best suits them.
Fraternities thus provide a
quality missing in other on
campus residences: mutual
selection. Members livetogether
by choice, not by the random as
signment of a lottery. The poten
tiality for individual growth, en
joyment and lifelong friendship
inherent in such mutual choice
is obvious.
If the prospect of a per
sonalized selection process
amidst an often impersonal uni
versity is appealingtoyou. don't
let any negative stereotypes you
may hold of fraternities stand in
your way.
A survey the Inter-Fraternity
Council took this fall showed
that a vast majority of fraternity
members were not initially in
clined to such a lifestyle when
they arrived at Stanford â€” yet
an even greater number are
satisfied with the choice they
made.
Together these men form 13
houses of unique character.
Each deserves your attention
during the next few weeks.
