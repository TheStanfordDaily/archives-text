I've read that Miss Teenage America might attend Stanford next
year. What courses would she take? -A.S.
We can't predict what the 1976 MTA will be taking (if she gets
in) hut we can tell you what the 1974 titleholder, a Daily staffer,
enrolled in last quarter. A sophomore, she took Bernstein's "So
cial 1 iistory of the U. 5.," Manley's "American Government," Zim
bardo's "Psychology 1," and Gillespie's "Humanities 62." At this
time these courses may be dubbed the official "Miss Teenage
American schedule" at Stanford.

Why does Stanford have hells ringat the beginningand end of each
class hour during the regular academic year? It makes this place
sound like a high school or worse. Can you imagine Oxford or the
Sorbonne with bells? If they were turned off, it would save energy
too. -J.D.H.
Our staff doesn't know who you are, but we sure would like to
know what your major is. Any student who has dabbled in the less
stimulating courses (no titles, of course) here knows well the flood
of relief that the bell can produce. And the mere thought of no
signal with which to startle a verbose professor into silence sends
a shudder up the back of the most stalwart academician.
Assoc. Registrar Bob Houghton said that in the 13 years he
has served in that office, no student has ever requested that the
bells be turned off. *****
NOTE: Further info on the "Marguerite" jitney has been pouring
into our office. Apparently, it was a 32-passenger horse-drawn
wagon which belonged to Jasper Paulsen, who owned a Palo Alto
livery stable, and named the wagon altera favorite horse. B eforean
"away" game, students would load the wagon beyond capacity
and drive to the railroad depot to see the team off.
