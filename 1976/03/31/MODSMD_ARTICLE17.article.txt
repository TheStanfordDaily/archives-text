Can a woman be circumcised?
Dr. Reuben says that women can also be circumcised. I say lie's full
of shit on that information. What is the definition of circumcision,
and do women have a foreskin?
Not only is this the first question to be asked twice of this
column, but both letters arrived in the same week. It may be a
conspiracy. Female circumcision does exist, footnotes Fundamen
tals of Human Sexuality, but the term is a tad bit misleading. The
clitoris doesn't have a foreskin, but it does have a fold of skin
covering part of it, which is called the prepuce. Du ring the higher
stages of excitement in intercourse, the clitoris actually retracts
underneath the prepuce.
Female circumcision, or clitoridectomy, sometimes means
trimming off the prepuce. But usually it refers to amputating the
clitoris, an undoubtedly ticklish situation, which has been prac
ticed in the Middle East and by certain tribes in Africa and Latin
America.

My female roommate has Herpes simplex, a disgusting little dis
ease which involves tiny blisters in uncomfortableareas. Naturally
1 am loath to contract the disease, but unfortunately we share many
apartment facilities. Is there any possibility that I could catch this
malady from a dirty bathtub or toilet seat?
Herpes simplex is a general term, one of the diseases under it
being Herpes genitalis, which 1 assume is what your roomie has,
since you mention uncomfortable areas. The research seems to
indicate that this form is transmitted by sexual contact, according
to Connie Starr at Cowell, but not by contact until things li ke toilet
seats, bathtubs or even bed linen.
