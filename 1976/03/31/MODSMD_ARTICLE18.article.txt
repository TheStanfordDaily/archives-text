## Gene Mayer doubtful for matches Netters face tough USC, UCLA 
### Paul Bauman 
Stanford tennis coach Dick
Gould could probably find a
silver lining in an earthquake.
Or a bright side to double-digit
inflation.
Gould and his Gardinals will
be going into tomorrow's match
against USC and Friday's con
test against defending national
champion UCLA, both in Los
Angeles, without four top
players off a team that finished a
disappointing fourth in the
NCAA net championships last
year.

Four-time All-American Jim
Delaney and two-time Ail-
Americans JohnVVhitlinger and
Nick Saviano have turned pro.
On top of that, Gene Mayer, a
junior and the third-ranked
amateur in the country, has a
pulled muscle in his back and
probably won't play against
USC or UCLA.
Still, Gould smiles, laughs
and winks as much as ever. The
Stanford coach's mood usually
varies from a high unrestrained
elation to a low of mere con
tentment.

Gould remains optimistic
about the "new look" Cards and
cited several reasons the other
day in the tennis office. Among
them were the improvement of
sophomore Bill Maze, who has
moved up from No. 6 on the
team last year to No. 1 this year,
and senior Pat UuPre's recovery
from surgery to alleviate ten
donitis in his right wrist.
Gould's happy because:
—"Maze is coming along just
beautifully," Gould said. "He
has improved infinitely over
last year. He has a great future
in pro tennis.
—"Pat has a healthy wrist for
the first time in three years. He
has been playing on a pro circuit
and he's had a very successful
circuit. To give you an example,
he beat George Hardie
(runner-up in the NCAA finals
to Billy Martin last June) in
straight sets.
—Stanford won the National
Team Indoor Tournament in
Madison, Wis. in February, sur
viving a field including all the
nation's top teams except UCLA.
—Stanford won the NorCal
Intercollegiate, also in Feb
ruary, with a perfect score.
"We've never done that before,"
Gould said, "and I've had some
good teams.
—"We've always had guys
who could come out of relative
obscurity to pull us through.
And Bill and Pat aren't obscure
to begin with. They're damn
good players."
"I don't want to sound like
we're the (NCAA) favorites,"

Gould cautioned. "We're not. By
the same token, I don't want to
sell my guys short. I have a tre
mendous amount of confidence
in this team, and more so every
day."
That confidence will be tested
in the matches down south,
which feature the top three col
legiate teams in the country.
UCLA is ranked first by the In
tercollegiate Tennis Coaches
Association, Stanford second
and USC third.
Stanford's singles lineup
against USC and UCLA will be,
in order, Maze, DuPre, Matt
Mitchell, Mark Mitchell, John
Rast and Perry Wright. In dou
bles, the Cards will go with
Maze-DuPre, Mitchell-Mitchell
and Rast-Wright.
Maze won the NorCal Inter
collegiate singles title and has
what Gould calls "the most de
vastating serve on the team."
Maze had an 18-1 record as a
freshman starter a year ago.
DuPre, the hardest working
player on the varsity,according
to Gould, has a career dual meet
record of 31-6. The Alabaman
was the country's top ranked
junior 18-year-old and under in
singles and doubles in 1972.
Matt Mitchell was a prep
Ail-American at Gunn High in
Palo Alto and reached the semi
finals of the National Hardcourt
Championships singles last
summer. Mitchell teamed with
his brother to win the NorCal
doubles title this year.
Mark Mitchell, a junior, has
28-3 varsity career singles re

cord and was elected the Cards'
1976 captain.
"I've never had anyone I've
respected more as a player or
person," Gould said. "He's a
good example for our team in
terms of character, moral fiber
and desire. He's always been in
the shadow of the bigger
names."
Rast was Florida's top junior,
and the eighth-ranked junior
nationally last year. Wright, a
better doubles than singles
player, was ranked first in Un
ited States Tennis Association
14, 16 and 18 doubles.
USC is led by Ail-American
Butch Walts and Bruce Manson,
who collaborated to win the
NCAA doubles championship
last year. Walts is the fourth
ranked amateur in the U.S. and
has beaten touring pros such as
Cliff Richey.
Stanford will have difficulty
beating the Trojans at home, but
it could happen. Beating UCLA,
however, will be next to impos
sible. Gould said it best when he
called the 1976 Bruins "one of
the greatest college teams of all
time."
UCLA has lost NCAA singles
champ Billy Martin to the pros,
but it has gained Peter P'leming,
a transfer from Michigan. UCLA
has the best two amateurs in he
U.S. in Fleming and senior
Brian Teacher. Teacher is
ranked first, but Fleming plays
No. 1 singles for the Bruins.
To give you an idea of Flem

Angeles tomorrow.
ing's ability, he defeated
Mexico's Raul Ramirez, ranked
No. 14 in the world, in San
Francisco's Firemen's Fund In
ternational last fall.
In back of Fleming and
Teacher are All-American Ferdi
Taygan, freshman John Austin,
Bruce Nichols and former All-
American Steve Mott. Mott was
UCLA's second best player two
years ago, but he missed all of
last season due to injuries suf
fered in a car accident.
"They're loaded," Could said
about the Bruins. "They're so
good that a guy who was No. 2
two years ago (Mott) may not
even play in the top six."
Now where's the bright side to
all that?
