# Cards scrap to win
## 
### George Anders 
Flaying a husding, scrappy game, theStanford
baseball team beatCal State-Hayward yesterday,
8-2, at Sunken Diamond.
Card coach Ray Young said after the gamethat
he was worried his team would slack off after
finishing second in the Riverside National Inter
collegiate Baseball Tournament, held last
weekend.
But instead. Young noted, "we did things like
squeezing in two runs, and stealing six bases."
The Cards were aided by seven Hayward er
rors, as half of Stanford's runs were unearned.
Most of those runs came in the fifth inning, when
doubles by Larry Reynolds and Randy Wong ig
nited a Big Red rally that featured 10 batters and
six runs.
No-hit ball
Stanford's starting pitcher, Mike Williamson,
pitched three innings of no-hit ball but weakened
in the fourth and was replaced by freshman Brian
Harrison.
"Williamson was a little stiff at thebeginning,"
Young remarked. "He said he felt good as the
game went on, but he just didn't have his usual
'pop' today."
Harrison shut out Hayward, pitching his way
out of a bases loaded jam in the eighth inning.
"Harrison's improving every time out," Young
declared. "He's going to be a fine pitcher."
The Cards set the tempo in the first frame. After
lead-off man Reynolds walked, Young recalled,
"we ran him on the first pitch, even though we
knew there was going to be a pitchout."
Rolls for hit
Reynolds took second, and scored soon after
wards on an error and a Steve Davis bunt that

rolled for a hit.
Overall, Young said, "we executed well. That's
the kind of game I feel we have to play."
Hayward revealed a play for bunting situa
tions, sending infielders scurrying before the
pitch. But, Young explained, in that case the bunt
sign is "automatically removed."
Card third baseman Gary Fitchford cashed in
on one such situation, punching a single through
where the shortstop would normally stand.
Stanford played without freshman regular
Mike Codiroli, out with a pulled hamstring.
Young said he hoped Codiroli would be back by
next weekend.
Three game series
This weekend the Cards play a three game
series against USC, another member of Stan
ford's new league, the California Intercollegiate
Baseball Association.
TheTrojans, only 14-13, "don't have the power
they used to, and their pitching's very young,"
according to Young. "That doesn't mean they're
not a good ball club,"he cautioned.
Young had no reservations about Arizona
State, which won the Riverside tournament by
beating Stanford in the championship game,
13-0, last Saturday night.
"On Saturday night, they were as fine a college
baseball team as I've ever seen," Young asserted,
"and I saw USC during the five years they were
NCAA champions."
Looking over his team, now 21-13, Young said
"we've got a set lineup now." First baseman Tom
"Guardino came out of a slump against River
side.

SUICIDE SQUEEZE —Stanford first baseman Tom Guardino squeezes in a run in the Cards' big fourth
inning rally against Hay ward State yesterday. Stanford rebounded from a 13-0 loss, to second-ranked
Arizona State last Saturday, to beat the Pioneers 8-2.
Flaying a husding, scrappy game, theStanford
baseball team beatCal State-Hayward yesterday,
8-2, at Sunken Diamond.
Card coach Ray Young said after the gamethat
he was worried his team would slack off after
finishing second in the Riverside National Inter
collegiate Baseball Tournament, held last
weekend.
But instead. Young noted, "we did things like
squeezing in two runs, and stealing six bases."
The Cards were aided by seven Hayward er
rors, as half of Stanford's runs were unearned.
Most of those runs came in the fifth inning, when
doubles by Larry Reynolds and Randy Wong ig
nited a Big Red rally that featured 10 batters and
six runs.
No-hit ball
Stanford's starting pitcher, Mike Williamson,
pitched three innings of no-hit ball but weakened
in the fourth and was replaced by freshman Brian
Harrison.
"Williamson was a little stiff at thebeginning,"
Young remarked. "He said he felt good as the
game went on, but he just didn't have his usual
'pop' today."
Harrison shut out Hayward, pitching his way
out of a bases loaded jam in the eighth inning.
"Harrison's improving every time out," Young
declared. "He's going to be a fine pitcher."
The Cards set the tempo in the first frame. After
lead-off man Reynolds walked, Young recalled,
"we ran him on the first pitch, even though we
knew there was going to be a pitchout."
Rolls for hit
Reynolds took second, and scored soon after
wards on an error and a Steve Davis bunt that

rolled for a hit.
Overall, Young said, "we executed well. That's
the kind of game I feel we have to play."
Hayward revealed a play for bunting situa
tions, sending infielders scurrying before the
pitch. But, Young explained, in that case the bunt
sign is "automatically removed."
Card third baseman Gary Fitchford cashed in
on one such situation, punching a single through
where the shortstop would normally stand.
Stanford played without freshman regular
Mike Codiroli, out with a pulled hamstring.
Young said he hoped Codiroli would be back by
next weekend.
Three game series
This weekend the Cards play a three game
series against USC, another member of Stan
ford's new league, the California Intercollegiate
Baseball Association.
TheTrojans, only 14-13, "don't have the power
they used to, and their pitching's very young,"
according to Young. "That doesn't mean they're
not a good ball club,"he cautioned.
Young had no reservations about Arizona
State, which won the Riverside tournament by
beating Stanford in the championship game,
13-0, last Saturday night.
"On Saturday night, they were as fine a college
baseball team as I've ever seen," Young asserted,
"and I saw USC during the five years they were
NCAA champions."
Looking over his team, now 21-13, Young said
"we've got a set lineup now." First baseman Tom
"Guardino came out of a slump against River
side.
