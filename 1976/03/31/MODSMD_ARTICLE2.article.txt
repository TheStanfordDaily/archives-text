# Urges Marxist approach to equality
## Davis begins feminism class 
### Vlae Kershner 
ASSU Guest Prof. Angela Davis said
last night that while the liberation of
women can first be envisioned under
capitalism, true equality of the sexes
can only take place in a socialist soci
ety.
Davis addressed about 1100 per
sons in Memorial Auditorium last
night in the opening lecture of her
class "The Female Condition: A
Search for a Marxist Approach."
She said her course would be, as the
title indicates, a search. Noting that
Marx never directly dealt with the
condition of women, Davis said "our
aim will be to forge a Marxist interpre
tation of the oppression and emanci
pation of women."
Speaking in classic professorial
style to a generally sympathetic audi
ence, Davis presented a hypothesis
designed to explain the condition of
women in various stages of society.
In much of pre-colonial Africa,
Davis said, women controlled the
production of food, and thus "had a
certain measure of prestige." This pat
tern was altered when colonial invad
ers forced men to farm.
Not truly equal
Nevertheless, the sexes were not
truly equal in pre-capitalist societies,
because men and women were limited
to prescribed roles, she said.
In capitalism, Davis said, equality
can be envisioned because "it doesn't
matter who produces the commodity
— the only thing that matters is that
the work is done, the machine is oper
ated and finally the commodity is
produced."
But Davis said that women are not
equal under capitalism because that

system inherently forces women to do
unpaid housework.
'Extreme contradiction 1
"The proletarian woman is at the
center of an extreme contradiction.
On the one hand, capitalism needs the
production of women as wage labor
ers, but at the same time, capitalism is
not prepared to assume the responsi
bility for domestic work," Davis said.
The reason for this exclusion of
household work from the mar
ketplace, Davis said, is that "such ser
vices do not generate surplus value;
such services do not generate profit."
She urged free "industrial" domes
tic service performed by paid men and
women. In response to a question on
why the Soviet Union has not done
this, Davis said that the U.S.S.R. and
Cuba are not as technologically ad
vanced as the United States.
Here, she said, "it would be the
easiest thing to develop industrial
housework."
ERA opposition
Another questioner challenged the
opposition of the Communist Party
USA—of which Davis is a member —
to the Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA). She said the party opposes the
ERA because "it does not create the
basis for an extension to equal rights,"
but did not go into specifics.
In her opening remarks, Davis said
"the significance of the women's
movement is distorted by images pro
jected through the media." She said
the "advances" reported — such as
naming a woman a bank president or
letting girls play little league baseball
— are not real advances.
Davis said that the "myth-makers
seek to channel the struggle into nar

row corners, to camouflage the
realities of the female condition, by
ridiculing and co-opting " the wo
men's movement.
Speech broadcast
Davis' speech was broadcast on
KZSU, which will rebroadcast all her
lectures Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8
p.m.
Prior to Davis' speech, Andrea Hal
liday, a member of the ASSU Guest
Professorship Board, said she was
"fairly optimistic" that Belgian
economist Ernest Mandel would be al
lowed to come to the U.S. to lecture
here, beginning next week.
