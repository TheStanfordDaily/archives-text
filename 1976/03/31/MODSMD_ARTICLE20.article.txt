Women's tennis
Stanford's women's tennis
team resumes action tomorrow
when it vies against UC-Davis at
the varsity courts, starting at
2:30 p.m.
The netters are led by Lele
Forood, who was a gold
medalist in the Pan Am games
last fall in Mexico City. Coach
Anne Hill says Forood "is a de
finite threat for the collegiate
singles title this year."
The squad also can count on a
trio of top freshmen, Sue Hagey,
Barb Jordan and Diane Morri
son.

Both Hagey and Jordan
reached the quarterfinals in the
1975 Junior Wimbledon Tour
nament, while Morrison won
the American Tennis Associa
tion Nationals last summer.
Rounding out the squad are
junior Marcy O'Keefe, senior
Liza Fande and sophomore
Nancy Rudd.
Oarsmen top St. Mary's
The Stanford varsity crew
team opened its 1976 racing
season with a victory over a
much-improved St. Mary's
squad at San Pablo last Satur

day.
The windy weather condi
tions caused problems for both
crews, but the Card strokers
rowed well and were never in
any real danger.
After fighting its way through
the first 1000 meters, Stanford
put it together leaving St.
Mary's a full two boat lengths
behind at the finish.
The frosh oarsmen raced the
Redwood high school crew,
which placed second nationally
in the prep ranks last year. The
freshman eight won a hard
fought victory, finishing two
seconds ahead of Redwood.
Coach Dick Dreissigacker
was generally pleased with the

results and felt the crews rowed
well for an early season meet.
The first big test for the Cards
will be this weekend when the
team makes its initial appear
ance in the prestigious San
Diego Crew Classic, which
brings together the top teams in
the nation. Included in the field
are defending national champ
ion Harvard, West Coach champ
Washington, Wisconsin and
Navy.
