Ford's campaign chief quits
WASHINGTON — Howard "Bo" Callaway officially
stepped down yesterday as President Ford's campaign
manager and was immediately replaced by Rogers Mor
ton, the former secretary of the interior who had been on
the White House staff as a political consultant.
Callaway's resignation, announced personally by
Ford, came two weeks after he was suspended at his own
request following disclosures about his role in promoting
a Colorado ski resort he owns.
The resignation was the major development on the first
Tuesday since Feb. 24 without a primary. Most of the
day's activities centered around Wisconsin and New
York, sites of next week's contests.
Arabs riot in Israel
NAZARETH, Israel —Security forces shot and killed
five rioting Israeli Arabs yesterday as violent clashes
shattered years of calm between Israel's three million
Jews and 500,000 Arabs.
The Arabs were killed by police and army gunfire,
Police Minister Shlomo Hillel said, in skirmishes ignited
by a Communist-led general strike to protest the takeover
of 1600 acres of Arab-Israeli land by the government.
Most of the violence flared in the biblical Galilee dis
trict, where rioters fought troops and police with stones
and flaming kerosene bombs.
Police reports said 38 policemen were injured and 31
Arabs hospitalized. Police arrested 285 demonstrators.
Death toll rises in Argentina
BUENOS A IRES — Troops and police killed nine leftist
guerrillas in gun battles as Argentina's new military
president, Gen. Jorge Videla, took office.
Videla was sworn in Monday, five days after his milit
ary junta ousted President Isabel Peron because her ad
ministration was unable to cope with political terrorism
or the nation's grave economic situation.
The killings brought the toll to 20 since Peron's ouster.
At least 211 persons have been killed since Jan. 1, and the
toll during Peron's tenure was more than 1700.
Death penalty unconstitutional?
WASHINGTON — A Stanford University law profes

sor argued yesterday that all death penalty laws enacted
since the Supreme Court abolished capital punishment in
1972 are unconstitutional.
In urging the Supreme Court not to reinstate capital
punishment, Anthony Amsterdam said all 34 new laws
violate the Constitution because:
—The new laws are so indistinguishable from the old
ones that they are invalid under the reasoning adopted by
the majority of the justices in the 1972 decision.
—The death penalty under any circumstances is a
cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Constitu-r
tion.
Amsterdam, representing the NAACP Legal Defense
Fund, made his arguments as the justices heard cases
about two men condemned to death in Texas and
Louisiana.
Soliah jurors chosen
SACRAMENTO — Eight women and four men were
chosen yesterday as jurors in the bank robbery trial of
Steven Soliah, the house painter who was a companion of
Patricia Hearst before her arrest.
It took a little less than an hour to select the jury, which
is made up largely of persons in their 20s or 60s.
U.S. District Court Judge Philip Wilkins said testimony
would begin today after attorneys make their opening
statements. The trial is expected to last about a month.
Soliah, 27, is charged with taking part in the $15,000
robbery of a Crocker National Bank branch in suburban
Carmichael last April 21.
In related developments, the FBI recently found a sta
tion wagon linked to the Symbionese Liberation Army,
reportedly with Soliah's fingerprints inside, a Sac
ramento radio station reported yesterday.
FBI spokesman Tom Griffin said it was a 1966 Chev
rolet, but refused to confirm, deny or comment further on
the report.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except partly cloudy north to
day. Lows tonight in the 40s. Highs today and tomorrow
mid 60s to mid 70s. Light winds except northwesterly 10
to 20 mph afternoons and evenings north.
