# Former GE engineer warns of nuclear power dangers

### Marc Strassman 
There are very real dangers from
using fission reactors to generate elec
tricity, said Dale Bridenbaugh, former
General Electric engineer and now a
fulltime worker with Project Survi
val,' a Palo Alto-based organization
seeking passage of Proposition 15, the
Nuclear Safeguards Initiative, in the
June 8 election.
Interviewed earlier this month,
Bridenbaugh discussed the dangers
from radioactive plutonium waste
and the economics of the nuclear in
dustry.
"Even assuming 99V2 percent effec
tiveness in separating out the
plutonium from the spent fuel, by the
year 2000, 200,000 kilograms (22
tons) of waste plutonium will have
been created. Effectively distributed,
this is enough to kill seven trillion
people," said Bridenbaugh.
He pointed out that "not many
people are making money from nuc
lear power development. The reactor
vendors have not made money. Gen
eral Atomic went out of business, after
losing a billion dollars. General Elec
tric has in fact lost extensive amounts
of money in the field. Westinghouse is
being sued for non-delivery of some
uranium and could be bankrupted by
the suit."
Some individuals and groups do
stand to profit from the construction
of nuclear plants, however, said
Bridenbaugh. "The only people who
are making anything are those sup
plying the construction materials,
Bechtel Corporation, Stone and Webs
ter, firms that work on a cost-plus
basis."
Utilities benefit
Bridenbaugh pointed out "The
utilities are allowed to make money as
a percentage of their capital invest
ment. Nuclear power, as a highly cap

ital intensive form of energy produc
tion, allows them to make a lot of
money."
Bridenbaugh also discussed the
need to consider and develop alterna
tive, non-nuclear sou rces of energy for
the future. He was particularly impre
ssed with the possibilities of solar
energy, generating power directly
from the sun.
"We have to move towards solar
energy," he said. "We are going to run
out of coal and oil eventually. It's es
sential that we invest more money in
solar energy. It's a race against time —
before the depletion of existing re
sources."
Emphasized practicality
He emphasized the practicality of
solar energy. "It's a much less compli

cated technology; we should be able to
pull it off. It's too bad we haven't been
working on it for the last 20 years,"
said Bridenbaugh.
Bridenbaugh pointed out the larger
implications of the Nuclear Initiative.
"If Proposition 15 passes in Califor
nia, it'll have a big national impact."
As a result of this, he said, a lot of
effort is going into the attempt to de
feat the measure by individuals and
groups organized as "Citizens for Jobs
and Energy," now known as the "No
on 15 Committee—Californians
against the Nuclear Shutdown."
"I'll be working full time for the
next several months," Bridenbaugh
said, "talking to people to convince
them that it is not a one-sided issue, as
some have claimed."
