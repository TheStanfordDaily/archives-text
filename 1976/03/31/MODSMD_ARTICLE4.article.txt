# U.S. charges ex-prof with cell culture sale
## 
### William Ross 
The National Institutes of Health
(NIH) has accused former Microbiol
ogy Prof. Leonard Hayflick of selling
cell specimens that were the property
of the federal government.
Charges by the University that
Hayflick deposited funds from fees
derived from research with the cells in
a personal, rather than University,
bank account led to his resignation
last month.
In a report released last week, the
NIH stated that Hayflick agreed in
1968 to give all but 20 of the specimens
he developed while employed by the
Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biol
ogy to the National Cancer Institute,
an NIH agency.
Hayflick agreed to keep only 10
specimens himself and to give 10 to he
Wistar Institute.
But the NIH report said that Hayf
lick took 379 ampules of the cells to
the University when he was hired here
in 1968 and that 207 ampules are now
unaccounted for.
The missing ampules allegedly are

worth $67,482.
In a public statement issued last
week, Hayflick announced that he has
filed suit in the U.S. District Court in
San Francisco against the Department
of Health, Education and Welfare
and its agency, NIH, seeking
injunctive relief against the NIH re
port's recommendation that the
agency attempt to recover the $67,482.
Hayflick noted that he has depo
sited that sum with the District Court
in order to demonstrate good faith.
Hayflick also said he is suing HEW
and the NIH for damages to his profes
sional reputation.
'Erroneous and incomplete'
Hayflick charged that the NIH re
port was "erroneous and incom
plete."
He said that although the NIH last
month requested that he file a written
defense by tomorrow, it issued the re
port before he had an opportunity to
file the statement.
"I have been denied due process by
the NIH, and therefore I am seeking
due process in the courts," Hayflick
explained.
"It was my belief that if any report
was released by NIH, it would attempt
to accurately reflect the facts not only
because that is the moral and ethical
thing to do, but was also their affirma
tive legal obligation under the Privacy
Act of 1974," Hayflick stated.
Denies wrongdoing
"I absolutely deny any wrongdoing
in the performance of my duties under
any NIH contract or in the course of
my employment by Stanford and I
urge my scientific collegues around
the world who have long relied on my
integrity and that of my work to re
gard with great caution the statements
in the report."
Hayflick, 48, has gained an interna
tional reputation for his work in
gerontology, the study of aging, and
other research in microbiology.
He helped develop a human cell
strain in the early 1960s and disco

vered that cultured human cells sub
divide 50 times before dying.
Hayflick in Maryland
Hayflick's wife said yesterday that
Hayflick currently is in Maryland and
had told her that he would not give out
any comments beyond those of his
written statement.
In a interview two weeks ago, Hayf
lick chided the Daily for mentioning
the circumstances surrounding his
resignation even though the facts
were made public by the University
News Service.
"The ordeal to which I have been
subjected has caused my family and
myself terrible anguish," Hayflick
said. "Please do not mention my name
ever again in the Daily. I don't want to
be humiliated any more than I already
have been."
Hayflick contended that the Uni
versity should never have revealed
that it reprimanded him for his al
leged use of $9500 in research funds
since it never proved that he intended
to misuse them.

injunctive relief against the NIH re
port's recommendation that the
agency attempt to recover the $67,482.
Hayflick noted that he has depo
sited that sum with the District Court
in order to demonstrate good faith.
Hayflick also said he is suing HEW
and the NIH for damages to his profes
sional reputation.
'Erroneous and incomplete'
Hayflick charged that the NIH re
port was "erroneous and incom
plete."
He said that although the NIH last
month requested that he file a written
defense by tomorrow, it issued the re
port before he had an opportunity to
file the statement.
"I have been denied due process by
the NIH, and therefore I am seeking
due process in the courts," Hayflick
explained.
"It was my belief that if any report
was released by NIH, it would attempt
to accurately reflect the facts not only
because that is the moral and ethical
thing to do, but was also their affirma
tive legal obligation under the Privacy
Act of 1974," Hayflick stated.
Denies wrongdoing
"I absolutely deny any wrongdoing
in the performance of my duties under
any NIH contract or in the course of
my employment by Stanford and I
urge my scientific collegues around
the world who have long relied on my
integrity and that of my work to re
gard with great caution the statements
in the report."
Hayflick, 48, has gained an interna
tional reputation for his work in
gerontology, the study of aging, and
other research in microbiology.
He helped develop a human cell
strain in the early 1960s and disco

vered that cultured human cells sub
divide 50 times before dying.
Hayflick in Maryland
Hayflick's wife said yesterday that
Hayflick currently is in Maryland and
had told her that he would not give out
any comments beyond those of his
written statement.
In a interview two weeks ago, Hayf
lick chided the Daily for mentioning
the circumstances surrounding his
resignation even though the facts
were made public by the University
News Service.
"The ordeal to which I have been
subjected has caused my family and
myself terrible anguish," Hayflick
said. "Please do not mention my name
ever again in the Daily. I don't want to
be humiliated any more than I already
have been."
Hayflick contended that the Uni
versity should never have revealed
that it reprimanded him for his al
leged use of $9500 in research funds
since it never proved that he intended
to misuse them.

The National Institutes of Health
(NIH) has accused former Microbiol
ogy Prof. Leonard Hayflick of selling
cell specimens that were the property
of the federal government.
Charges by the University that
Hayflick deposited funds from fees
derived from research with the cells in
a personal, rather than University,
bank account led to his resignation
last month.
In a report released last week, the
NIH stated that Hayflick agreed in
1968 to give all but 20 of the specimens
he developed while employed by the
Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biol
ogy to the National Cancer Institute,
an NIH agency.
Hayflick agreed to keep only 10
specimens himself and to give 10 to he
Wistar Institute.
But the NIH report said that Hayf
lick took 379 ampules of the cells to
the University when he was hired here
in 1968 and that 207 ampules are now
unaccounted for.
The missing ampules allegedly are

worth $67,482.
In a public statement issued last
week, Hayflick announced that he has
filed suit in the U.S. District Court in
San Francisco against the Department
of Health, Education and Welfare
and its agency, NIH, seeking
injunctive relief against the NIH re
port's recommendation that the
agency attempt to recover the $67,482.
