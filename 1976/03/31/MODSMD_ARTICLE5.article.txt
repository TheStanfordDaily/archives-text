# Senate approves ad funds for tenure education program
## 
### Lori Matsukawa 
The ASSU Senate voted last night to
appropriate $100 for advertising costs
of a public education program on te
nure here despite the confusion which
occurred when Senators Kevin
McDermott and Bob Ottilie walked
out of the meeting.
The senate, lacking a quorum, was
unable to vote on the advertising bill
until McDermott and Ottilie returned.
The senate meeting had started 30 mi
nutes late because a 12-member
quorum did not appear until 8 p.m.
The program on tenure, according
to sponsoring Sen. Bill Tyndall, will
be similar to a panel debate intended
to inform the public of University te
nure procedures and to allow minor
ity viewpoints to be expressed on
these procedures.
"Faculty, administrators and stu
dents have planned this ever since
Asst. Sociology Prof. Anne McMahon
was denied tenure," said Tyndall. The
program, which is scheduled for April
6 in the Tresidder Large Lounge, is

sponsored by the Extra-Departmental
Program and the Graduate Student
Council.
The Finance Committee, however,
questioning the timing of the prop
osal, said it was submitted "in the
middle of COP (Council of Presidents)
elections," according to committee
chairman McDermott.
'Aids campaign'
"If the program could have waited
until after the elections we would
have passed it immediately. I see this
as aiding his (Tyndall's) campaign,"
said McDermott. Tyndall is a candi
date for the COP.
McDermott also said the committee
was split on the decision to support
Tyndall's bill because the program
was allegedly planned without the aid
of certain students who were working
on the tenure problem long before the
program's inception.
Tyndall denied that the program
was a political move on his part.
"To say I organized (the program) is
ridiculous. I won't even be present at

the program," said Tyndall, who
maintained that he was merely bring
ing the bill to the senate for considera
tion.
"This thing is being turned into a
political potato," said Tyndall.
At that point, McDermott and Ot
tilie walked out of the meeting, to re
turn five minutes later to continue the
debate. The bill was passed 10-2, with
one abstention.
In other senate action, $200 was ap
propriated to match a COP contribu
tion of $200 for the fourth annual Kent
State-Jackson State Memorial Lecture
to be held here May 1. The funds will
be combined with $500 from Memo
rial Church and an expected $200
from the ASSU Speakers Bureau to
pay the honorarium for guest speaker
Elie Wiesel.
Fee assessments
Last night was the final night for the
senate to approve fee assessments to
be placed on the ballot April 14 and
15.
Assessment resolutions passed by
the senate included a fee assessment
of $1 for autumn and winter quarters
to be used by the Stanford Band solely
for out-of-state trips, and a $1 fee as
sessment for winter and spring quar
ters to finance the operations of the
Legal Counseling Office.
Also appearing on the ballot will be
the program fee assessment, which
supports smaller organizations on
campus, approved by the
senate at a meeting on Feb. 23. A fee
assessment of $1 for autumn, winter
and spring quarters to fund opera
tions of KZSU will also appear on the
ballot.
'Daily' assessment
Considerable time was spent debat
ing whether the Daily should be al
lowed to have its fee assessment
placed on the April 14 and 15 ballot.
The senate fi nally voted to place the
Daily assessment on the ballot provid
ing for a $1 charge per student for only
three quarters instead of the four
quarters originally requested by the
Daily.
Senate Chairman Bill Hoke an
nounced that Senators Chris Suczek,
Seth Foldy and Paul Espinosa had res
igned. There is now an opening for a
graduate senator. Any graduate stu
dent interested in the position is wel
come to come to the ASSU office to
pick up a nomination petition. Hoke
said. Theterm will last through spring
quarter.

pay the honorarium for guest speaker
Elie Wiesel.
Fee assessments
Last night was the final night for the
senate to approve fee assessments to
be placed on the ballot April 14 and
15.
Assessment resolutions passed by
the senate included a fee assessment
of $1 for autumn and winter quarters
to be used by the Stanford Band solely
for out-of-state trips, and a $1 fee as
sessment for winter and spring quar
ters to finance the operations of the
Legal Counseling Office.
Also appearing on the ballot will be
the program fee assessment, which
supports smaller organizations on
campus, approved by the
senate at a meeting on Feb. 23. A fee
assessment of $1 for autumn, winter
and spring quarters to fund opera
tions of KZSU will also appear on the
ballot.
'Daily' assessment
Considerable time was spent debat
ing whether the Daily should be al
lowed to have its fee assessment
placed on the April 14 and 15 ballot.
The senate fi nally voted to place the
Daily assessment on the ballot provid
ing for a $1 charge per student for only
three quarters instead of the four
quarters originally requested by the
Daily.
Senate Chairman Bill Hoke an
nounced that Senators Chris Suczek,
Seth Foldy and Paul Espinosa had res
igned. There is now an opening for a
graduate senator. Any graduate stu
dent interested in the position is wel
come to come to the ASSU office to
pick up a nomination petition. Hoke
said. Theterm will last through spring
quarter.
The ASSU Senate voted last night to
appropriate $100 for advertising costs
of a public education program on te
nure here despite the confusion which
occurred when Senators Kevin
McDermott and Bob Ottilie walked
out of the meeting.
The senate, lacking a quorum, was
unable to vote on the advertising bill
until McDermott and Ottilie returned.
The senate meeting had started 30 mi
nutes late because a 12-member
quorum did not appear until 8 p.m.
The program on tenure, according
to sponsoring Sen. Bill Tyndall, will
be similar to a panel debate intended
to inform the public of University te
nure procedures and to allow minor
ity viewpoints to be expressed on
these procedures.
"Faculty, administrators and stu
dents have planned this ever since
Asst. Sociology Prof. Anne McMahon
was denied tenure," said Tyndall. The
program, which is scheduled for April
6 in the Tresidder Large Lounge, is

sponsored by the Extra-Departmental
Program and the Graduate Student
Council.
The Finance Committee, however,
questioning the timing of the prop
osal, said it was submitted "in the
middle of COP (Council of Presidents)
elections," according to committee
chairman McDermott.
'Aids campaign'
"If the program could have waited
until after the elections we would
have passed it immediately. I see this
as aiding his (Tyndall's) campaign,"
said McDermott. Tyndall is a candi
date for the COP.
McDermott also said the committee
was split on the decision to support
Tyndall's bill because the program
was allegedly planned without the aid
of certain students who were working
on the tenure problem long before the
program's inception.
Tyndall denied that the program
was a political move on his part.
"To say I organized (the program) is
ridiculous. I won't even be present at

the program," said Tyndall, who
maintained that he was merely bring
ing the bill to the senate for considera
tion.
"This thing is being turned into a
political potato," said Tyndall.
At that point, McDermott and Ot
tilie walked out of the meeting, to re
turn five minutes later to continue the
debate. The bill was passed 10-2, with
one abstention.
In other senate action, $200 was ap
propriated to match a COP contribu
tion of $200 for the fourth annual Kent
State-Jackson State Memorial Lecture
to be held here May 1. The funds will
be combined with $500 from Memo
rial Church and an expected $200
from the ASSU Speakers Bureau to
pay the honorarium for guest speaker
Elie Wiesel.
