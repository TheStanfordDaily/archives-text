# U.S., Soviets 'reach' nuclear inspection pact
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Soviet and
American negotiators, meeting in
Moscow, have reached basic agree
ment on the need for on-site inspection
of each country's nuclear test sites, a
high administration official said yes
terday.
The accord would, for the first time,
allow American inspectors to check
Soviet nuclear facilities to see that
treaty provisions are not being viol
ated. Soviet officials could do the
same in the United States.
Some technical details remain un
resolved, and negotiators will be un
able to complete a treaty setting limits
on peaceful nuclear explosions in
time to meet their deadline, said the
U.S. official.
The United States had hoped to
complete the treaty by today when a
companion agreement limiting nuc
lear weapons test explosions to a
magnitude of 150 kilotons — the equi
valent of 150,000 tons of dynamite —
is to go into effect.
The negotiations to set limits on
peaceful nuclear explosions began
after the weapons test treaty was con

cluded on a visit by former President
Richard Nixon to Moscow in 1974.
The high administration official,
who has been following developments
closely and asked that his name not be
divulged, stressed that the differences
are basically technical and failure to
complete the accord is not expected to
have a negative impact on U.S.-Soviet
relations.
The administration, meanwhile,
will not submit the weapons treaty for
ratification by the Senate, but U.S. of
ficials said weapons tests will not be
conducted above that size in any
event.
In another, and more difficult,
category is the lagging effort to
negotiate a treaty limiting offensive
nuclear weapons development until
1985. The Soviets have not responded
to the latest American proposals for
resolving differences conveyed to the
Kremlin more than a month ago.
Prospects for a weapons limitation
agreement have dimmed with recent
strains between Washington and
Moscow.
