# Give students a tenure veto
##

John D. Black

A score or more times in the
last 25 years concerned Stan
ford students have become upset
because some junior faculty
member with a gift for under
graduate teaching and/or un
usual concern for students as
individuals is denied tenure.
Such events stimulate edito
rials, letters, petitions, resolu
tions, speeches — sometimes
even rallies or protest marches
— all directed toward the prop
osition that great teaching
should provide an alternative to
brilliant scholarship as a route
to tenure, or put another way,
teaching and research/
scholarship should receive
equal weight in tenure deci
sions.
I dare say that on most of these
occasions I, too, have been sad
dened or angered by the tenure
denials, but I am now convinced
that the uproar they generate is
just so much tilting at
windmills, an exercise in futil
ity.
Without confronting the ques
tion of whether it should be so, I
think we ought to acknowledge
once and for all that tenure deci
sions at prestigious universities
will always be based essentially
on the evaluations of a profes
sor's research and scholarly
contributions in his own discip
line, made by his colleagues,
both within the university and
at other universities.
Jones' chances
Such evaluations are, in ef
fect, translated into probability
statements about the chances
that young Mr. Jones will de
velop a national (or interna
tional) reputation as a leader in
some specialized area of study.
Great centers of learning have
operated on this basis for cen
turies,and nothing is in sight to
replace the critical, cold, peer
judgments, which are usually
made with a sincere effort at
dispassionate objectivity (albeit
not always successfully) and
which are often made with re
luctance and genuine sadness.
Once a department or tenure
committee is convinced of the
candidate's unique research
gifts, it may then make a quick
check to insure that he isn't a
budding alcoholic, hasn't been
convicted of contributing to the
delinquency of minors, and
hasn't acquired a notoriously
unsavory reputation for his
teaching or treatment of stu
dents.
When a dean says, "We do
consider teaching ability in te
nure decisions," it is basically
this kind of consideration that
he is referring to.
Hopeless quest
Is the student's quest for good
teachers therefore hopeless? Not

necessarily.
What students and others
concerned with the quality of
undergraduate education must
seek is something approaching
a veto power over the granting
of tenure to anyone who has
shown a deficiency or disin
terest in undergraduate teach
ing or a lack of responsiveness
to the needs of individual stu
dents.
Undergraduates are probably
not qualified to judge a profes
sor's potential contribution to
the body of knowledge in his
discipline and should not serve
on committees for that purpose.
They can judge a professor's
contributions to their educa
tions and can do so fairly. They
are not misled by the fact that he
wears mod clothes, tells funny
stories or grades leniently.
Second-hand
Conversely, faculty members
do not like to evaluate each
other's teaching (they must usu
ally rely on second-hand infor
mation to make such judgments)
and for a single committee to
weigh teaching and research in
its decision-making is too much
like comparing apples and
oranges.
The goal, then, should be two
parallel but separate and equal
processes for the granting of te
nure; a candidate would have to
pass both hurdles to qualify.
One evaluation would be con
trolled by faculty peers, the
other by a student-dominated
committee.
Under such a system we might
occasionally lose a future Nobel
laureate,and we would still lose
some good teachers, but we
would retain a faculty of out
standing calibre which is also
dedicated to teaching.

A score or more times in the
last 25 years concerned Stan
ford students have become upset
because some junior faculty
member with a gift for under
graduate teaching and/or un
usual concern for students as
individuals is denied tenure.
Such events stimulate edito
rials, letters, petitions, resolu
tions, speeches — sometimes
even rallies or protest marches
— all directed toward the prop
osition that great teaching
should provide an alternative to
brilliant scholarship as a route
to tenure, or put another way,
teaching and research/
scholarship should receive
equal weight in tenure deci
sions.
I dare say that on most of these
occasions I, too, have been sad
dened or angered by the tenure
denials, but I am now convinced
that the uproar they generate is
just so much tilting at
windmills, an exercise in futil
ity.
Without confronting the ques
tion of whether it should be so, I
think we ought to acknowledge
once and for all that tenure deci
sions at prestigious universities
will always be based essentially
on the evaluations of a profes
sor's research and scholarly
contributions in his own discip
line, made by his colleagues,
both within the university and
at other universities.
Jones' chances
Such evaluations are, in ef
fect, translated into probability
statements about the chances
that young Mr. Jones will de
velop a national (or interna
tional) reputation as a leader in
some specialized area of study.
Great centers of learning have
operated on this basis for cen
turies,and nothing is in sight to
replace the critical, cold, peer
judgments, which are usually
made with a sincere effort at
dispassionate objectivity (albeit
not always successfully) and
which are often made with re
luctance and genuine sadness.
Once a department or tenure
committee is convinced of the
candidate's unique research
gifts, it may then make a quick
check to insure that he isn't a
budding alcoholic, hasn't been
convicted of contributing to the
delinquency of minors, and
hasn't acquired a notoriously
unsavory reputation for his
teaching or treatment of stu
dents.
When a dean says, "We do
consider teaching ability in te
nure decisions," it is basically
this kind of consideration that
he is referring to.
Hopeless quest
Is the student's quest for good
teachers therefore hopeless? Not

necessarily.
What students and others
concerned with the quality of
undergraduate education must
seek is something approaching
a veto power over the granting
of tenure to anyone who has
shown a deficiency or disin
terest in undergraduate teach
ing or a lack of responsiveness
to the needs of individual stu
dents.
Undergraduates are probably
not qualified to judge a profes
sor's potential contribution to
the body of knowledge in his
discipline and should not serve
on committees for that purpose.
They can judge a professor's
contributions to their educa
tions and can do so fairly. They
are not misled by the fact that he
wears mod clothes, tells funny
stories or grades leniently.
Second-hand
Conversely, faculty members
do not like to evaluate each
other's teaching (they must usu
ally rely on second-hand infor
mation to make such judgments)
and for a single committee to
weigh teaching and research in
its decision-making is too much
like comparing apples and
oranges.
The goal, then, should be two
parallel but separate and equal
processes for the granting of te
nure; a candidate would have to
pass both hurdles to qualify.
One evaluation would be con
trolled by faculty peers, the
other by a student-dominated
committee.
Under such a system we might
occasionally lose a future Nobel
laureate,and we would still lose
some good teachers, but we
would retain a faculty of out
standing calibre which is also
dedicated to teaching.
