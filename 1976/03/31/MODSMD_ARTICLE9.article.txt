# Watergate reforms are misdirected
## 
### 
The Watergate scandal may
appear to be dead and buried,
but its causes still exist. The
basic cause of the Watergate
scandal was the excessive con
centration of power in the hands
of the federal government.
That is not to say that Richard
Nixon was not an important fac
tor. Nixon's personality was a
major factor in determining
what shape the scandal would
ultimately take.
But a far more important fac
tor. and the factor at which most
of the reform efforts are aimed,
was the avalanche of illegal con
tributions which pou red into the

Nixon re-election campaign
prior to 1972.
Quotas bought
It will be recalled that in 1970,
the dairy industry was prepared
to contribute $2 million to Nix
on's re-election in return for
Nixon's support of import
quotas on milk. The quotas were
imposed two weeks after the
offer was made.
And nearly everyone remem
bers the 1971 ITT antitrust set
tlement which left ITT with the
profitable Hartford Fire Insur
ance Company in return for
ITT's support in the Nixon cam
paign.
There were, in addition,
scandals involving Gulf Oil,
Ashland Oil, Phillips Pet
roleum, Braniff Airlines and
others.
Why did these companies
take such actions? The answer
to this question holds the key to
the Watergate scandal and to its
prevention in the future.
Perhaps a clue lies in the fact
that many business interests felt
that a man such as George
McGovern would use the pow
ers of the federal government to
make conditions intolerable for
them.
This realization, combined
with the realization that con
tributions could be used to
"buy" policies favorable to the
business community, was the

reason businesses were willing
to flout the law in the name of
their cause.
Thus, the cause of the Water
gate scandal was too much, not
too little, federal power.
Businesses can no longer deal in
the open marketplace; rather,
they must deal behind the
scenes with federal bureaucrats.
This concentration of power
can only lead to dirty tricks. It is

much easier to bribe a federal
official than to go through the
legal process of trying to get a
bad law changed.
Unfortunately, the Watergate
reformers don't realize this.
They prefer to concentrate more
power in the hands of bribable
federal officials. For example,
the Watergate-generated Fed
eral Elections Commission is a
sitting duck for scandal.
Problem worsens
Thus, the problem grows
worse as the federal government
becomes more powerful.

America can expect more
Watergates as businessmen find
it increasingly more difficult to
make an honest profit.
The solution lies not in more
governmental power, but less. It
would be impossible for
businesses to use bribery to get
favorable regulations if the fed
eral government could not issue
them in the first place.
Besides, most regulations do
little good. It is almost a cliche
that most regulatory agencies
protect rather than regulate
special interest.
It is clear that the ultimate
cause of Watergate has not been
eliminated. If the American
people want to keep large cor
porations honest, they should
trim governmental regulatory
power and seek to create an en
vironment in which honesty is
possible.

ultimately take.
But a far more important fac
tor. and the factor at which most
of the reform efforts are aimed,
was the avalanche of illegal con
tributions which pou red into the

Nixon re-election campaign
prior to 1972.
Quotas bought
It will be recalled that in 1970,
the dairy industry was prepared
to contribute $2 million to Nix
on's re-election in return for
Nixon's support of import
quotas on milk. The quotas were
imposed two weeks after the
offer was made.
And nearly everyone remem
bers the 1971 ITT antitrust set
tlement which left ITT with the
profitable Hartford Fire Insur
ance Company in return for
ITT's support in the Nixon cam
paign.
There were, in addition,
scandals involving Gulf Oil,
Ashland Oil, Phillips Pet
roleum, Braniff Airlines and
others.
Why did these companies
take such actions? The answer
to this question holds the key to
the Watergate scandal and to its
prevention in the future.
Perhaps a clue lies in the fact
that many business interests felt
that a man such as George
McGovern would use the pow
ers of the federal government to
make conditions intolerable for
them.
This realization, combined
with the realization that con
tributions could be used to
"buy" policies favorable to the
business community, was the

reason businesses were willing
to flout the law in the name of
their cause.
Thus, the cause of the Water
gate scandal was too much, not
too little, federal power.
Businesses can no longer deal in
the open marketplace; rather,
they must deal behind the
scenes with federal bureaucrats.
This concentration of power
can only lead to dirty tricks. It is

much easier to bribe a federal
official than to go through the
legal process of trying to get a
bad law changed.
Unfortunately, the Watergate
reformers don't realize this.
They prefer to concentrate more
power in the hands of bribable
federal officials. For example,
the Watergate-generated Fed
eral Elections Commission is a
sitting duck for scandal.
Problem worsens
Thus, the problem grows
worse as the federal government
becomes more powerful.

America can expect more
Watergates as businessmen find
it increasingly more difficult to
make an honest profit.
The solution lies not in more
governmental power, but less. It
would be impossible for
businesses to use bribery to get
favorable regulations if the fed
eral government could not issue
them in the first place.
Besides, most regulations do
little good. It is almost a cliche
that most regulatory agencies
protect rather than regulate
special interest.
It is clear that the ultimate
cause of Watergate has not been
eliminated. If the American
people want to keep large cor
porations honest, they should
trim governmental regulatory
power and seek to create an en
vironment in which honesty is
possible.

The Watergate scandal may
appear to be dead and buried,
but its causes still exist. The
basic cause of the Watergate
scandal was the excessive con
centration of power in the hands
of the federal government.
That is not to say that Richard
Nixon was not an important fac
tor. Nixon's personality was a
major factor in determining
what shape the scandal would
ultimately take.
