Thinking
About
Peace
Corps?
It's not too early to inquire
about June and July open
ings.
And Stanford grads - or
those who will graduate in
time to begin training in
June or July - can get
current information soon.
A team of Peace Corps re
cruiters will be on campus
April 13, 14 & 15. If you
want an individual inter
view while they're here,
sign up in advance at the
Career Planning and
Placement Center. The
first sign-up sheets will be
posted today.
Peace Corps opportunities
this summer are in a wide ran
range of disciplines: chemical
civil, electrical, industrial
and mechanical engineering;
elementary education; and
secondary education in
many different majors.
(English, math/science majors
in greatest demand)
Think about it.
