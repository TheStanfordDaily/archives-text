## Terman: nuclear reactor site 
### 
Copyright 1976, The Stanford Daily
onstruction of a massive nuclear reactor may cur
rently be underway at the Frederick E. Terman En
gineering Center construction site, the Daily has
learned.
The publisher of a national magazine, a Stanford alum
nus, told the Daily on March 21 that his staff had obtained a
copy of an Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP)
document which showed that Stanford was one of 15
secret reactor sites.
The 500-megawatt reactors are to be used, the pub
lisher said, to generate power for evacuation centers in
case of thermonuclear war. Time magazine recently dis
closed the existence of the 15 sites, but did not mention
their whereabouts.
Since learning of the OEP document, the Daily has
obtained further evidence.
A Daily reporter evaded the site's complex alarm system

last Saturday night and discovered camouflaged electric
eyes, large sealed unmarked crates which could hold elec
tronic equipment and massive concrete slabs which could
be used as shielding in power plants.
A professor at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) who refused to be named in the Daily said he knew
of a "small reactor" not more than 100 megawatts being
built "within 10 kilometers" of SLAC to provide the high
energy research facility with additional power.
"I was told that the reactor could not be installed at SLAC
because it is too near the San Andreas Fault, the profes
sor said. "But 500 megawatts. . . God. I had no idea it was
that big.''
A member of the Board of Trustees, who also asked to
remain anonymous, said. "Something of the sort may have
been discussed. I would rather not go into detail.

Reynaldo Gonzalez, a
spokesman for the Office of In
spection and Enforcement of the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) in Walnut Creek, refused to
confirm or deny the construction.
The NRC must approve and
monitor all use of nuclear power in
the United States
"There are many unconfirmed
rumors of this sort," Gonzalez
said There must, of course, be
some classified construction. We
cannot let potentially hostile
foreign powers know all our
sources of power. But... we can
not discuss this."
Officially, only three reactors —
Humboldt Bay, Rancho Seco and
San Onofre — are operating in
California. Four others are under
construction.
The SLAC professor said he
had heard that the reactor is
largely incomplete, although
much of the complex electronic
monitoring gear is ready to be in
stalled.
'Heavy stuff'
"I don t think they're planning to
bnng in the heavy stuff for some
while." he said. He added that as
much as $2 million in equipment at
the site is currently in the open.
Several large crates do sit un
guarded at the site. A construction
worker admitted that there were
"unmarked crates and boxes''
which he had been told "to keep
away from."'
But he indicated that such prac
tice was fairly standard. "I don't
have to do everything, he said. *l
just worry about my job

The Terman construction has
been a center of controversy and
suspicion on campus since its in
ception.
When a worker injured himself
in a fall last quarter, DaHy repor
ters were at first denied access to
the site When two did enter, they
were ordered to leave by a un
iformed sheriff s deputy. Several
workers threatened the reporters.
At that time, several
plainclothes detectives were im
mediately in evidence, although
they left shortly thereafter.
A second worker said "lots of
civilians" often are at the site. "I
don t know who they are, and they
don t talk to us," he said. "But if I
had to guess, I would call them
security guards or inspectors."
Suspension
According to the employe, the
University and the firm construct
ing the building covered up the
suspension last fall of eight
employes who protested the site's
extraordinary security precau
tions and "obtrusive" observers.
Workers said they were warned
not to talk to the press.
A spokesman for F.P. Lathrop
Construction Company, the
Emeryville firm which is building
the Terman Center, admitted that
some workers had temporarily
lost their jobs.
Layoffs'
"I prefer to call them layoffs,'
not suspensions," he said.
Everybody else in the world does
it." He denied that protests had
hastened the suspensions.
None of the suspended workers
could be reached for comment. A
third worker at the site, who de
clined to be identified by name,
said he had never seen "so much
security" at a construction site. He
claimed that in addition to an
armed guard posted each even
ing, an elaborate security system
warns of trespassers.

Stanford Director of Public
Safety Marvin Herrington last
night denied any knowledge of
such a system.
False alarms
The worker, however, claimed,
"A lot of the false alarms' you hear
around campus are really police
going to investigate that alarm."
He said he has heard that dogs
and birds often trip the system,
which involves electric eyes and
pressure-sensitive devices.
The first construction worker
confirmed that the Stanford De

partment of Public Safety, the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's of
fice and "someone at Moffett
Field," a U.S. naval base in Sun
nyvale, all monitor the system.
University plans calling for the
remodeling of Lake Lagunita into
a year-round facility could also
make the lake available to hold
water for the nuclear power plant.
The water would be used to cool
turbines.
Lake conversion
Conversion of the lake was
proposed last fall by Edward

Shaw, executive assistant to Pro
vost William Miller. But the Uni
versity had reportedly shelved the
plan by the end of fall quarter after
surveys showed that the project
would cost approximately
5300.000.
A source close to Miller con
firmed for the Daily late last night
that the plans to revamp Lake Lag
were "off the shelf" and that Miller
had planned to announce the re
modeling "before the end of the
year."

AFTER THE FALL—When a construction worker fell from a scaffolding last quarter, "Daily" reporters
were first denied access to the Terman building site. The "Daily" photographer quickly entered the
construction area to take this shot, but was ordered out by a sheriff's deputy within minutes. The
worker was not injured critically.
We've been wanting to rebuild
the lake area for some time." the
spokesperson said. Miller could
not be reached for comment.
May approval
The source on the Board of
Trustees said that some sort of
reactor proposal was finalized by
the board last May."
He said the idea of a reactor on
Stanford land was first proposed
by former trustee David Packard
in 1970, while he was undersec
retary of defense.
At that time, one reactor was
located on the campus. The small
sub-critical reactor was main
tained by the Nuclear Engineering
Department in Building 520 be
hind Memorial Church. However,
when funding for the department
was terminated five years ago, the
relatively harmless reactor was
dismantled.
'Critical'
The new reactor, incomparably
larger, will be allowed to go "criti
cal" to facilitate power generation.
A critical reactor could cause an
atomic explosion in case of acci
dent, and supporters of the Nuc
lear Safeguards Initiative (Propos
ition 15) say that such an explo
sion is possible.
According to a trustee, an ad
hoc committee of the board ap
proved the installation, but the
issue was not mentioned in the
public agenda. Ironically, the
same trustee meeting evoked
massive student protest and tem
porary occupation of the Old
Union May 13, 1975,0ver another
issue.
Four board members reached
by the Daily denied the reports of
the trustee action. Two other trus
tees, including Board President
Robert Minge Brown, refused to
comment.
Campus reaction to the reac
tor's existence was mixed.

Computer Science Prof. John
McCarthy, head of SENSE, a sci
entists' organization which sup
ports nuclear power development,
expressed disbelief. "That's the
craziest thing I've ever heard," he
said. "I can't believe it."
But he added, "If it's true, I'm
sure they consulted the right
people. I'm sure they've taken
every precaution."
'Insane'
Jim Burch, head of Project Sur
vival, which supports the Nuclear
Safeguards Initiative, echoed
McCarthy's disbelief, but not his
assurance. "I can't believe they'd
do that," Burch said. "That's in
sane."

He said he considered it unsafe.
"If it's true, it could be a disaster. It
will be a disaster," he said. "This is
typical, though."
Burch warned of possible
threats by terrorist organizations.
"Look at the H-P bombing," he
said. "What if they bombed the
reactor?"
The March 5 bombing of the
Hewlett-Packard building in the
Stanford Industrial Park caused
$75,000 damage. Hewlett-
Packard has also provided some
funds for the Terman center.
'Saddened'
Nan Ginsberg, another Project
Survival member, said the reports
"saddened" her.

"Just when we're campaigning
against this sort of thing, they do
this without a word." she sighed. "I
just don't believe it."
A professor who asked to re
main anonymous charged that the
reactor's reported installation
marked "the return of classified
research to Stanford."
"We fought hard to eliminate
classified research," he said.
"Now the administration is build
ing a classified project in our bac
kyard. It's just incredible."
Denials
But University officials, who had
denied the reports of the reactor,
also denied that classified re

search had returned to Stanford.
Vice Provost for Research Wil
liam Massy said, ' Such a device,
if any, would be for research pur
poses only. We wouldn't allow
anything here for classified work
He added. "Of course, this is
not to say there is such a device.
The whole thing is just specula
tion."
Robert Rosenzweig, vice presi
dent for public affairs, com
mented, "I just don't know where
you guys get this dirt. And every
year, you publish something like
this right around the beginning of
spring quarter. Is there something
special about April 1 ?"


ELECTRONIC SNOOP—The nuclear reactor construction at the
Terman Engineering Center site is guarded by concealed electric
eyes, such as the one concealed in this elevated box (center). The

crates in the background hold electronic monitoring gear, accord
ing to informed sources. The Durand Building stands in the
background.

ELECTRONIC SNOOP—The nuclear reactor construction at the
Terman Engineering Center site is guarded by concealed electric

crates in the background hold electronic monitoring gear, accord

onstruction of a massive nuclear reactor may cur
rently be underway at the Frederick E. Terman En
gineering Center construction site, the Daily has
learned.
The publisher of a national magazine, a Stanford alum
nus, told the Daily on March 21 that his staff had obtained a
copy of an Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP)
document which showed that Stanford was one of 15
secret reactor sites.
The 500-megawatt reactors are to be used, the pub
lisher said, to generate power for evacuation centers in
case of thermonuclear war. Time magazine recently dis
closed the existence of the 15 sites, but did not mention
their whereabouts.
Since learning of the OEP document, the Daily has
obtained further evidence.
A Daily reporter evaded the site's complex alarm system

last Saturday night and discovered camouflaged electric
eyes, large sealed unmarked crates which could hold elec
tronic equipment and massive concrete slabs which could
be used as shielding in power plants.
A professor at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) who refused to be named in the Daily said he knew
of a "small reactor" not more than 100 megawatts being
built "within 10 kilometers" of SLAC to provide the high
energy research facility with additional power.
"I was told that the reactor could not be installed at SLAC
because it is too near the San Andreas Fault, the profes
sor said. "But 500 megawatts. . . God. I had no idea it was
that big.''
A member of the Board of Trustees, who also asked to
remain anonymous, said. "Something of the sort may have
been discussed. I would rather not go into detail.

Reynaldo Gonzalez, a
spokesman for the Office of In
spection and Enforcement of the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) in Walnut Creek, refused to
confirm or deny the construction.
The NRC must approve and
monitor all use of nuclear power in
the United States
"There are many unconfirmed
rumors of this sort," Gonzalez
said There must, of course, be
some classified construction. We
cannot let potentially hostile
foreign powers know all our
sources of power. But... we can
not discuss this."
Officially, only three reactors —
Humboldt Bay, Rancho Seco and
San Onofre — are operating in
California. Four others are under
construction.
The SLAC professor said he
had heard that the reactor is
largely incomplete, although
much of the complex electronic
monitoring gear is ready to be in
stalled.
'Heavy stuff'
"I don t think they're planning to
bnng in the heavy stuff for some
while." he said. He added that as
much as $2 million in equipment at
the site is currently in the open.
Several large crates do sit un
guarded at the site. A construction
worker admitted that there were
"unmarked crates and boxes''
which he had been told "to keep
away from."'
But he indicated that such prac
tice was fairly standard. "I don't
have to do everything, he said. *l
just worry about my job

The Terman construction has
been a center of controversy and
suspicion on campus since its in
ception.
When a worker injured himself
in a fall last quarter, DaHy repor
ters were at first denied access to
the site When two did enter, they
were ordered to leave by a un
iformed sheriff s deputy. Several
workers threatened the reporters.
At that time, several
plainclothes detectives were im
mediately in evidence, although
they left shortly thereafter.
A second worker said "lots of
civilians" often are at the site. "I
don t know who they are, and they
don t talk to us," he said. "But if I
had to guess, I would call them
security guards or inspectors."
Suspension
According to the employe, the
University and the firm construct
ing the building covered up the
suspension last fall of eight
employes who protested the site's
extraordinary security precau
tions and "obtrusive" observers.
Workers said they were warned
not to talk to the press.
A spokesman for F.P. Lathrop
Construction Company, the
Emeryville firm which is building
the Terman Center, admitted that
some workers had temporarily
lost their jobs.
Layoffs'
"I prefer to call them layoffs,'
not suspensions," he said.
Everybody else in the world does
it." He denied that protests had
hastened the suspensions.
None of the suspended workers
could be reached for comment. A
third worker at the site, who de
clined to be identified by name,
said he had never seen "so much
security" at a construction site. He
claimed that in addition to an
armed guard posted each even
ing, an elaborate security system
warns of trespassers.

Stanford Director of Public
Safety Marvin Herrington last
night denied any knowledge of
such a system.
False alarms
The worker, however, claimed,
"A lot of the false alarms' you hear
around campus are really police
going to investigate that alarm."
He said he has heard that dogs
and birds often trip the system,
which involves electric eyes and
pressure-sensitive devices.
The first construction worker
confirmed that the Stanford De

partment of Public Safety, the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's of
fice and "someone at Moffett
Field," a U.S. naval base in Sun
nyvale, all monitor the system.
University plans calling for the
remodeling of Lake Lagunita into
a year-round facility could also
make the lake available to hold
water for the nuclear power plant.
The water would be used to cool
turbines.
Lake conversion
Conversion of the lake was
proposed last fall by Edward

Shaw, executive assistant to Pro
vost William Miller. But the Uni
versity had reportedly shelved the
plan by the end of fall quarter after
surveys showed that the project
would cost approximately
5300.000.
A source close to Miller con
firmed for the Daily late last night
that the plans to revamp Lake Lag
were "off the shelf" and that Miller
had planned to announce the re
modeling "before the end of the
year."

AFTER THE FALL—When a construction worker fell from a scaffolding last quarter, "Daily" reporters
were first denied access to the Terman building site. The "Daily" photographer quickly entered the
construction area to take this shot, but was ordered out by a sheriff's deputy within minutes. The
worker was not injured critically.
We've been wanting to rebuild
the lake area for some time." the
spokesperson said. Miller could
not be reached for comment.
May approval
The source on the Board of
Trustees said that some sort of
reactor proposal was finalized by
the board last May."
He said the idea of a reactor on
Stanford land was first proposed
by former trustee David Packard
in 1970, while he was undersec
retary of defense.
At that time, one reactor was
located on the campus. The small
sub-critical reactor was main
tained by the Nuclear Engineering
Department in Building 520 be
hind Memorial Church. However,
when funding for the department
was terminated five years ago, the
relatively harmless reactor was
dismantled.
'Critical'
The new reactor, incomparably
larger, will be allowed to go "criti
cal" to facilitate power generation.
A critical reactor could cause an
atomic explosion in case of acci
dent, and supporters of the Nuc
lear Safeguards Initiative (Propos
ition 15) say that such an explo
sion is possible.
According to a trustee, an ad
hoc committee of the board ap
proved the installation, but the
issue was not mentioned in the
public agenda. Ironically, the
same trustee meeting evoked
massive student protest and tem
porary occupation of the Old
Union May 13, 1975,0ver another
issue.
Four board members reached
by the Daily denied the reports of
the trustee action. Two other trus
tees, including Board President
Robert Minge Brown, refused to
comment.
Campus reaction to the reac
tor's existence was mixed.

Computer Science Prof. John
McCarthy, head of SENSE, a sci
entists' organization which sup
ports nuclear power development,
expressed disbelief. "That's the
craziest thing I've ever heard," he
said. "I can't believe it."
But he added, "If it's true, I'm
sure they consulted the right
people. I'm sure they've taken
every precaution."
'Insane'
Jim Burch, head of Project Sur
vival, which supports the Nuclear
Safeguards Initiative, echoed
McCarthy's disbelief, but not his
assurance. "I can't believe they'd
do that," Burch said. "That's in
sane."

He said he considered it unsafe.
"If it's true, it could be a disaster. It
will be a disaster," he said. "This is
typical, though."
Burch warned of possible
threats by terrorist organizations.
"Look at the H-P bombing," he
said. "What if they bombed the
reactor?"
The March 5 bombing of the
Hewlett-Packard building in the
Stanford Industrial Park caused
$75,000 damage. Hewlett-
Packard has also provided some
funds for the Terman center.
'Saddened'
Nan Ginsberg, another Project
Survival member, said the reports
"saddened" her.

"Just when we're campaigning
against this sort of thing, they do
this without a word." she sighed. "I
just don't believe it."
A professor who asked to re
main anonymous charged that the
reactor's reported installation
marked "the return of classified
research to Stanford."
"We fought hard to eliminate
classified research," he said.
"Now the administration is build
ing a classified project in our bac
kyard. It's just incredible."
Denials
But University officials, who had
denied the reports of the reactor,
also denied that classified re

search had returned to Stanford.

onstruction of a massive nuclear reactor may cur
rently be underway at the Frederick E. Terman En
gineering Center construction site, the Daily has
learned.
The publisher of a national magazine, a Stanford alum
nus, told the Daily on March 21 that his staff had obtained a
copy of an Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP)
document which showed that Stanford was one of 15
secret reactor sites.
The 500-megawatt reactors are to be used, the pub
lisher said, to generate power for evacuation centers in
case of thermonuclear war. Time magazine recently dis
closed the existence of the 15 sites, but did not mention
their whereabouts.
Since learning of the OEP document, the Daily has
obtained further evidence.
A Daily reporter evaded the site's complex alarm system

last Saturday night and discovered camouflaged electric
eyes, large sealed unmarked crates which could hold elec
tronic equipment and massive concrete slabs which could
be used as shielding in power plants.
A professor at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) who refused to be named in the Daily said he knew
of a "small reactor" not more than 100 megawatts being
built "within 10 kilometers" of SLAC to provide the high
energy research facility with additional power.
"I was told that the reactor could not be installed at SLAC
because it is too near the San Andreas Fault, the profes
sor said. "But 500 megawatts. . . God. I had no idea it was
that big.''
A member of the Board of Trustees, who also asked to
remain anonymous, said. "Something of the sort may have
been discussed. I would rather not go into detail.

Reynaldo Gonzalez, a
spokesman for the Office of In
spection and Enforcement of the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) in Walnut Creek, refused to
confirm or deny the construction.
The NRC must approve and
monitor all use of nuclear power in
the United States
"There are many unconfirmed
rumors of this sort," Gonzalez
said There must, of course, be
some classified construction. We
cannot let potentially hostile
foreign powers know all our
sources of power. But... we can
not discuss this."
Officially, only three reactors —
Humboldt Bay, Rancho Seco and
San Onofre — are operating in
California. Four others are under
construction.
The SLAC professor said he
had heard that the reactor is
largely incomplete, although
much of the complex electronic
monitoring gear is ready to be in
stalled.
'Heavy stuff'
"I don t think they're planning to
bnng in the heavy stuff for some
while." he said. He added that as
much as $2 million in equipment at
the site is currently in the open.
Several large crates do sit un
guarded at the site. A construction
worker admitted that there were
"unmarked crates and boxes''
which he had been told "to keep
away from."'
But he indicated that such prac
tice was fairly standard. "I don't
have to do everything, he said. *l
just worry about my job

The Terman construction has
been a center of controversy and
suspicion on campus since its in
ception.
When a worker injured himself
in a fall last quarter, DaHy repor
ters were at first denied access to
the site When two did enter, they
were ordered to leave by a un
iformed sheriff s deputy. Several
workers threatened the reporters.
At that time, several
plainclothes detectives were im
mediately in evidence, although
they left shortly thereafter.
A second worker said "lots of
civilians" often are at the site. "I
don t know who they are, and they
don t talk to us," he said. "But if I
had to guess, I would call them
security guards or inspectors."
Suspension
According to the employe, the
University and the firm construct
ing the building covered up the
suspension last fall of eight
employes who protested the site's
extraordinary security precau
tions and "obtrusive" observers.
Workers said they were warned
not to talk to the press.
A spokesman for F.P. Lathrop
Construction Company, the
Emeryville firm which is building
the Terman Center, admitted that
some workers had temporarily
lost their jobs.
Layoffs'
"I prefer to call them layoffs,'
not suspensions," he said.
Everybody else in the world does
it." He denied that protests had
hastened the suspensions.
None of the suspended workers
could be reached for comment. A
third worker at the site, who de
clined to be identified by name,
said he had never seen "so much
security" at a construction site. He
claimed that in addition to an
armed guard posted each even
ing, an elaborate security system
warns of trespassers.

Stanford Director of Public
Safety Marvin Herrington last
night denied any knowledge of
such a system.
False alarms
The worker, however, claimed,
"A lot of the false alarms' you hear
around campus are really police
going to investigate that alarm."
He said he has heard that dogs
and birds often trip the system,
which involves electric eyes and
pressure-sensitive devices.
The first construction worker
confirmed that the Stanford De

partment of Public Safety, the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's of
fice and "someone at Moffett
Field," a U.S. naval base in Sun
nyvale, all monitor the system.
University plans calling for the
remodeling of Lake Lagunita into
a year-round facility could also
make the lake available to hold
water for the nuclear power plant.
The water would be used to cool
turbines.
Lake conversion
Conversion of the lake was
proposed last fall by Edward

Shaw, executive assistant to Pro
vost William Miller. But the Uni
versity had reportedly shelved the
plan by the end of fall quarter after
surveys showed that the project
would cost approximately
5300.000.
A source close to Miller con
firmed for the Daily late last night
that the plans to revamp Lake Lag
were "off the shelf" and that Miller
had planned to announce the re
modeling "before the end of the
year."

AFTER THE FALL—When a construction worker fell from a scaffolding last quarter, "Daily" reporters
were first denied access to the Terman building site. The "Daily" photographer quickly entered the
construction area to take this shot, but was ordered out by a sheriff's deputy within minutes. The
worker was not injured critically.
We've been wanting to rebuild
the lake area for some time." the
spokesperson said. Miller could
not be reached for comment.
May approval
The source on the Board of
Trustees said that some sort of
reactor proposal was finalized by
the board last May."
He said the idea of a reactor on
Stanford land was first proposed
by former trustee David Packard
in 1970, while he was undersec
retary of defense.
At that time, one reactor was
located on the campus. The small
sub-critical reactor was main
tained by the Nuclear Engineering
Department in Building 520 be
hind Memorial Church. However,
when funding for the department
was terminated five years ago, the
relatively harmless reactor was
dismantled.
'Critical'
The new reactor, incomparably
larger, will be allowed to go "criti
cal" to facilitate power generation.
A critical reactor could cause an
atomic explosion in case of acci
dent, and supporters of the Nuc
lear Safeguards Initiative (Propos
ition 15) say that such an explo
sion is possible.
According to a trustee, an ad
hoc committee of the board ap
proved the installation, but the
issue was not mentioned in the
public agenda. Ironically, the
same trustee meeting evoked
massive student protest and tem
porary occupation of the Old
Union May 13, 1975,0ver another
issue.
Four board members reached
by the Daily denied the reports of
the trustee action. Two other trus
tees, including Board President
Robert Minge Brown, refused to
comment.
Campus reaction to the reac
tor's existence was mixed.

Computer Science Prof. John
McCarthy, head of SENSE, a sci
entists' organization which sup
ports nuclear power development,
expressed disbelief. "That's the
craziest thing I've ever heard," he
said. "I can't believe it."
But he added, "If it's true, I'm
sure they consulted the right
people. I'm sure they've taken
every precaution."
'Insane'
Jim Burch, head of Project Sur
vival, which supports the Nuclear
Safeguards Initiative, echoed
McCarthy's disbelief, but not his
assurance. "I can't believe they'd
do that," Burch said. "That's in
sane."

He said he considered it unsafe.
"If it's true, it could be a disaster. It
will be a disaster," he said. "This is
typical, though."
Burch warned of possible
threats by terrorist organizations.
"Look at the H-P bombing," he
said. "What if they bombed the
reactor?"
The March 5 bombing of the
Hewlett-Packard building in the
Stanford Industrial Park caused
$75,000 damage. Hewlett-
Packard has also provided some

He said he considered it unsafe.

Burch warned of possible
threats by terrorist organizations.
"Look at the H-P bombing," he

A professor who asked to re

reactor's reported installation
marked "the return of classified

"We fought hard to eliminate
classified research," he said.
"Now the administration is build

denied the reports of the reactor,
also denied that classified re

ELECTRONIC SNOOP—The nuclear reactor construction at the
Terman Engineering Center site is guarded by concealed electric

crates in the background hold electronic monitoring gear, accord

onstruction of a massive nuclear reactor may cur
rently be underway at the Frederick E. Terman En
gineering Center construction site, the Daily has
learned.
The publisher of a national magazine, a Stanford alum
nus, told the Daily on March 21 that his staff had obtained a
copy of an Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP)
document which showed that Stanford was one of 15
secret reactor sites.
The 500-megawatt reactors are to be used, the pub
lisher said, to generate power for evacuation centers in
case of thermonuclear war. Time magazine recently dis
closed the existence of the 15 sites, but did not mention
their whereabouts.
Since learning of the OEP document, the Daily has
obtained further evidence.
A Daily reporter evaded the site's complex alarm system

last Saturday night and discovered camouflaged electric
eyes, large sealed unmarked crates which could hold elec
tronic equipment and massive concrete slabs which could
be used as shielding in power plants.
A professor at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) who refused to be named in the Daily said he knew
of a "small reactor" not more than 100 megawatts being
built "within 10 kilometers" of SLAC to provide the high
energy research facility with additional power.
"I was told that the reactor could not be installed at SLAC
because it is too near the San Andreas Fault, the profes
sor said. "But 500 megawatts. . . God. I had no idea it was
that big.''
A member of the Board of Trustees, who also asked to
remain anonymous, said. "Something of the sort may have
been discussed. I would rather not go into detail.

Reynaldo Gonzalez, a
spokesman for the Office of In
spection and Enforcement of the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) in Walnut Creek, refused to
confirm or deny the construction.
The NRC must approve and
monitor all use of nuclear power in
the United States
"There are many unconfirmed
rumors of this sort," Gonzalez
said There must, of course, be
some classified construction. We
cannot let potentially hostile
foreign powers know all our
sources of power. But... we can
not discuss this."
Officially, only three reactors —
Humboldt Bay, Rancho Seco and
San Onofre — are operating in
California. Four others are under
construction.
The SLAC professor said he
had heard that the reactor is
largely incomplete, although
much of the complex electronic
monitoring gear is ready to be in
stalled.
'Heavy stuff'
"I don t think they're planning to
bnng in the heavy stuff for some
while." he said. He added that as
much as $2 million in equipment at
the site is currently in the open.
Several large crates do sit un
guarded at the site. A construction
worker admitted that there were
"unmarked crates and boxes''
which he had been told "to keep
away from."'
But he indicated that such prac
tice was fairly standard. "I don't
have to do everything, he said. *l
just worry about my job

The Terman construction has
been a center of controversy and
suspicion on campus since its in
ception.
When a worker injured himself
in a fall last quarter, DaHy repor
ters were at first denied access to
the site When two did enter, they
were ordered to leave by a un
iformed sheriff s deputy. Several
workers threatened the reporters.
At that time, several
plainclothes detectives were im
mediately in evidence, although
they left shortly thereafter.
A second worker said "lots of
civilians" often are at the site. "I
don t know who they are, and they
don t talk to us," he said. "But if I
had to guess, I would call them
security guards or inspectors."
Suspension
According to the employe, the
University and the firm construct
ing the building covered up the
suspension last fall of eight
employes who protested the site's
extraordinary security precau
tions and "obtrusive" observers.
Workers said they were warned
not to talk to the press.
A spokesman for F.P. Lathrop
Construction Company, the
Emeryville firm which is building
the Terman Center, admitted that
some workers had temporarily
lost their jobs.
Layoffs'
"I prefer to call them layoffs,'
not suspensions," he said.
Everybody else in the world does
it." He denied that protests had
hastened the suspensions.
None of the suspended workers
could be reached for comment. A
third worker at the site, who de
clined to be identified by name,
said he had never seen "so much
security" at a construction site. He
claimed that in addition to an
armed guard posted each even
ing, an elaborate security system
warns of trespassers.

Stanford Director of Public
Safety Marvin Herrington last
night denied any knowledge of
such a system.
False alarms
The worker, however, claimed,
"A lot of the false alarms' you hear
around campus are really police
going to investigate that alarm."
He said he has heard that dogs
and birds often trip the system,
which involves electric eyes and
pressure-sensitive devices.
The first construction worker
confirmed that the Stanford De

partment of Public Safety, the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's of
fice and "someone at Moffett
Field," a U.S. naval base in Sun
nyvale, all monitor the system.
University plans calling for the
remodeling of Lake Lagunita into
a year-round facility could also
make the lake available to hold
water for the nuclear power plant.
The water would be used to cool
turbines.
Lake conversion
Conversion of the lake was
proposed last fall by Edward

Shaw, executive assistant to Pro
vost William Miller. But the Uni
versity had reportedly shelved the
plan by the end of fall quarter after
surveys showed that the project
would cost approximately
5300.000.
A source close to Miller con
firmed for the Daily late last night
that the plans to revamp Lake Lag
were "off the shelf" and that Miller
had planned to announce the re
modeling "before the end of the
year."

AFTER THE FALL—When a construction worker fell from a scaffolding last quarter, "Daily" reporters
were first denied access to the Terman building site. The "Daily" photographer quickly entered the
construction area to take this shot, but was ordered out by a sheriff's deputy within minutes. The
worker was not injured critically.
We've been wanting to rebuild
the lake area for some time." the
spokesperson said. Miller could
not be reached for comment.
May approval
The source on the Board of
Trustees said that some sort of
reactor proposal was finalized by
the board last May."
He said the idea of a reactor on
Stanford land was first proposed
by former trustee David Packard
in 1970, while he was undersec
retary of defense.
At that time, one reactor was
located on the campus. The small
sub-critical reactor was main
tained by the Nuclear Engineering
Department in Building 520 be
hind Memorial Church. However,
when funding for the department
was terminated five years ago, the
relatively harmless reactor was
dismantled.
'Critical'
The new reactor, incomparably
larger, will be allowed to go "criti
cal" to facilitate power generation.
A critical reactor could cause an
atomic explosion in case of acci
dent, and supporters of the Nuc
lear Safeguards Initiative (Propos
ition 15) say that such an explo
sion is possible.
According to a trustee, an ad
hoc committee of the board ap
proved the installation, but the
issue was not mentioned in the
public agenda. Ironically, the
same trustee meeting evoked
massive student protest and tem
porary occupation of the Old
Union May 13, 1975,0ver another
issue.
Four board members reached
by the Daily denied the reports of
the trustee action. Two other trus
tees, including Board President
Robert Minge Brown, refused to
comment.
Campus reaction to the reac
tor's existence was mixed.

Computer Science Prof. John
McCarthy, head of SENSE, a sci
entists' organization which sup
ports nuclear power development,
expressed disbelief. "That's the
craziest thing I've ever heard," he
said. "I can't believe it."
But he added, "If it's true, I'm

Four board members reached
by the Daily denied the reports of
the trustee action. Two other trus

comment.
Campus reaction to the reac

Computer Science Prof. John
McCarthy, head of SENSE, a sci
entists' organization which sup
ports nuclear power development,
expressed disbelief. "That's the
craziest thing I've ever heard," he
said. "I can't believe it."

'Insane'
Jim Burch, head of Project Sur
vival, which supports the Nuclear
Safeguards Initiative, echoed
McCarthy's disbelief, but not his
assurance. "I can't believe they'd
do that," Burch said. "That's in
sane."

He said he considered it unsafe.
"If it's true, it could be a disaster. It
will be a disaster," he said. "This is
typical, though."
Burch warned of possible
threats by terrorist organizations.
"Look at the H-P bombing," he
said. "What if they bombed the
reactor?"
The March 5 bombing of the
Hewlett-Packard building in the
Stanford Industrial Park caused
$75,000 damage. Hewlett-
Packard has also provided some
funds for the Terman center.
'Saddened'
Nan Ginsberg, another Project
Survival member, said the reports
"saddened" her.

"Just when we're campaigning
against this sort of thing, they do
this without a word." she sighed. "I
just don't believe it."
A professor who asked to re
main anonymous charged that the
reactor's reported installation
marked "the return of classified
research to Stanford."
"We fought hard to eliminate
classified research," he said.
"Now the administration is build
ing a classified project in our bac
kyard. It's just incredible."
Denials
But University officials, who had
denied the reports of the reactor,
also denied that classified re

search had returned to Stanford.
Vice Provost for Research Wil

if any, would be for research pur
poses only. We wouldn't allow
anything here for classified work
He added. "Of course, this is

ELECTRONIC SNOOP—The nuclear reactor construction at the
Terman Engineering Center site is guarded by concealed electric
eyes, such as the one concealed in this elevated box (center). The

crates in the background hold electronic monitoring gear, accord
ing to informed sources. The Durand Building stands in the

onstruction of a massive nuclear reactor may cur
rently be underway at the Frederick E. Terman En
gineering Center construction site, the Daily has
learned.
The publisher of a national magazine, a Stanford alum
nus, told the Daily on March 21 that his staff had obtained a
copy of an Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP)
document which showed that Stanford was one of 15
secret reactor sites.
The 500-megawatt reactors are to be used, the pub
lisher said, to generate power for evacuation centers in
case of thermonuclear war. Time magazine recently dis
closed the existence of the 15 sites, but did not mention
their whereabouts.
Since learning of the OEP document, the Daily has
obtained further evidence.
A Daily reporter evaded the site's complex alarm system

last Saturday night and discovered camouflaged electric
eyes, large sealed unmarked crates which could hold elec
tronic equipment and massive concrete slabs which could
be used as shielding in power plants.
A professor at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) who refused to be named in the Daily said he knew
of a "small reactor" not more than 100 megawatts being
built "within 10 kilometers" of SLAC to provide the high
energy research facility with additional power.
"I was told that the reactor could not be installed at SLAC
because it is too near the San Andreas Fault, the profes
sor said. "But 500 megawatts. . . God. I had no idea it was
that big.''
A member of the Board of Trustees, who also asked to
remain anonymous, said. "Something of the sort may have
been discussed. I would rather not go into detail.

Reynaldo Gonzalez, a
spokesman for the Office of In
spection and Enforcement of the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) in Walnut Creek, refused to
confirm or deny the construction.
The NRC must approve and
monitor all use of nuclear power in
the United States
"There are many unconfirmed
rumors of this sort," Gonzalez
said There must, of course, be
some classified construction. We
cannot let potentially hostile
foreign powers know all our
sources of power. But... we can
not discuss this."
Officially, only three reactors —
Humboldt Bay, Rancho Seco and
San Onofre — are operating in
California. Four others are under
construction.
The SLAC professor said he
had heard that the reactor is
largely incomplete, although
much of the complex electronic
monitoring gear is ready to be in
stalled.
'Heavy stuff'
"I don t think they're planning to
bnng in the heavy stuff for some
while." he said. He added that as
much as $2 million in equipment at
the site is currently in the open.
Several large crates do sit un
guarded at the site. A construction
worker admitted that there were
"unmarked crates and boxes''
which he had been told "to keep
away from."'
But he indicated that such prac
tice was fairly standard. "I don't
have to do everything, he said. *l
just worry about my job

The Terman construction has
been a center of controversy and
suspicion on campus since its in
ception.
When a worker injured himself
in a fall last quarter, DaHy repor
ters were at first denied access to
the site When two did enter, they
were ordered to leave by a un
iformed sheriff s deputy. Several
workers threatened the reporters.
At that time, several
plainclothes detectives were im
mediately in evidence, although
they left shortly thereafter.
A second worker said "lots of
civilians" often are at the site. "I
don t know who they are, and they
don t talk to us," he said. "But if I
had to guess, I would call them
security guards or inspectors."
Suspension
According to the employe, the
University and the firm construct
ing the building covered up the
suspension last fall of eight
employes who protested the site's
extraordinary security precau
tions and "obtrusive" observers.
Workers said they were warned
not to talk to the press.
A spokesman for F.P. Lathrop
Construction Company, the
Emeryville firm which is building
the Terman Center, admitted that
some workers had temporarily
lost their jobs.
Layoffs'
"I prefer to call them layoffs,'
not suspensions," he said.
Everybody else in the world does
it." He denied that protests had
hastened the suspensions.
None of the suspended workers
could be reached for comment. A
third worker at the site, who de
clined to be identified by name,
said he had never seen "so much
security" at a construction site. He
claimed that in addition to an
armed guard posted each even
ing, an elaborate security system
warns of trespassers.

Stanford Director of Public
Safety Marvin Herrington last
night denied any knowledge of
such a system.
False alarms
The worker, however, claimed,
"A lot of the false alarms' you hear
around campus are really police
going to investigate that alarm."
He said he has heard that dogs
and birds often trip the system,
which involves electric eyes and
pressure-sensitive devices.
The first construction worker
confirmed that the Stanford De

partment of Public Safety, the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's of
fice and "someone at Moffett
Field," a U.S. naval base in Sun
nyvale, all monitor the system.
University plans calling for the
remodeling of Lake Lagunita into
a year-round facility could also
make the lake available to hold
water for the nuclear power plant.
The water would be used to cool
turbines.
Lake conversion
Conversion of the lake was
proposed last fall by Edward

Shaw, executive assistant to Pro
vost William Miller. But the Uni
versity had reportedly shelved the
plan by the end of fall quarter after
surveys showed that the project
would cost approximately
5300.000.
A source close to Miller con
firmed for the Daily late last night
that the plans to revamp Lake Lag
were "off the shelf" and that Miller
had planned to announce the re
modeling "before the end of the
year."

AFTER THE FALL—When a construction worker fell from a scaffolding last quarter, "Daily" reporters
were first denied access to the Terman building site. The "Daily" photographer quickly entered the
construction area to take this shot, but was ordered out by a sheriff's deputy within minutes. The
worker was not injured critically.
We've been wanting to rebuild
the lake area for some time." the
spokesperson said. Miller could
not be reached for comment.
May approval
The source on the Board of
Trustees said that some sort of
reactor proposal was finalized by
the board last May."
He said the idea of a reactor on
Stanford land was first proposed
by former trustee David Packard
in 1970, while he was undersec
retary of defense.
At that time, one reactor was
located on the campus. The small
sub-critical reactor was main
tained by the Nuclear Engineering
Department in Building 520 be
hind Memorial Church. However,
when funding for the department
was terminated five years ago, the
relatively harmless reactor was
dismantled.
'Critical'
The new reactor, incomparably
larger, will be allowed to go "criti
cal" to facilitate power generation.
A critical reactor could cause an
atomic explosion in case of acci
dent, and supporters of the Nuc
lear Safeguards Initiative (Propos
ition 15) say that such an explo
sion is possible.

hoc committee of the board ap
