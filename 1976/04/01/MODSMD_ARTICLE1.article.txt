## Terman: nuclear reactor site

Copyright 1976, The Stanford Daily
onstruction of a massive nuclear reactor may cur
rently be underway at the Frederick E. Terman En
gineering Center construction site, the Daily has
learned.
The publisher of a national magazine, a Stanford alum
nus, told the Daily on March 21 that his staff had obtained a
copy of an Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP)
document which showed that Stanford was one of 15
secret reactor sites.
The 500-megawatt reactors are to be used, the pub
lisher said, to generate power for evacuation centers in
case of thermonuclear war. Time magazine recently dis
closed the existence of the 15 sites, but did not mention
their whereabouts.
Since learning of the OEP document, the Daily has
obtained further evidence.
A Daily reporter evaded the site's complex alarm system

last Saturday night and discovered camouflaged electric
eyes, large sealed unmarked crates which could hold elec
tronic equipment and massive concrete slabs which could
be used as shielding in power plants.
A professor at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) who refused to be named in the Daily said he knew
of a "small reactor" not more than 100 megawatts being
built "within 10 kilometers" of SLAC to provide the high
energy research facility with additional power.
"I was told that the reactor could not be installed at SLAC
because it is too near the San Andreas Fault, the profes
sor said. "But 500 megawatts. . . God. I had no idea it was
that big.''
A member of the Board of Trustees, who also asked to
remain anonymous, said. "Something of the sort may have
been discussed. I would rather not go into detail.
