# Soda sales sink but revenues rise
## 
### Geoffrey Samuels 
The recent price increase for
vending machine goods has not
affected sales, according to fi
gures released by Edward Scoles,
director of University housing.
The price hike, which was put
into effect on Jan. 1 by the Can
teen Corporation, did not reduce
sales for the succeeding period
Gross sales for the period from
Jan. 18 to Feb 14. 1976 were
539.096 Comparison with an
identical period in 1975 reveals
that current sales are slightly grea
ter than the earlier period s sales
of 538,300.
A slight drop in the purchase of
canned beverages was noted, al
though revenue from canned be
verages increased Soda con
sumption. which accounts for ap

proximately 40 percent of the
sales, fell by 5290 cans in relation
to demand in the 1975 period.
Soda revenue increased by
$1481, however.
Scoles discounted the possibil
ity of a future price reduction. "I
wouldn't look for a price de
crease," he said.
The current contract with Can
teen vending expires on Nov. 1,
1976, and the University is con
sidering alternatives, Scoles said.
Aside from allowing for competi
tive bidding, he indicated there is a
possibility of a University
operated vending service, saying,
We might even want to do it our
selves."
An advantage of a University
vending service is the possibility
of a broader selection. 'Right
now, Scoles noted, "to a certain
extent we're captive of Canteen in
what kind of products they can get
the best price on, or what they re
willing to go out and seek."
However, if the vending service
was University-operated, "we
could be more selective about the
kind of products we offered," he
said.
The decision as to the possible
future operation of the service by
the University will be made during
the summer

VENDING RAGE—Following the January 1 vending machine price increase many old customers were
moved to violent demonstrations of their displeasure. Such displays created more thirst than they
quenched, however, as soda revenues are up from 1975.
