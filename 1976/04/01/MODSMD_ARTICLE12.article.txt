## 
### Kim Hatamiya 
"Lava Bed Ghost Dance," a
play depicting the plight of the
California Modoc Indians and their
confrontation with the United
States Army in 1873. will be pre
sented outdoors during two weeks
in May by the Stanford American
Indian Organization (SAIO) in con
junction with the Drama Depart
ment.
The production is the focus of a
new spring quarter SCIRE prog
ram directed by Jael Wiseman, an
instructor at the University of San
Francisco and Steven Most, au
thor of "Lava Bed."
Wiseman and Most chose Stan
ford as the most appropriate
showcase for such a production
because of the Indian mascot con
troversy and the University's Na
tive American enrollment, which is
larger than that of any Califor
man university.
The SAIO feel that this is a co
gent way of expressing their point
of view on the plight of Native
Americans continuing today,"
said Wiseman.
Wounded Knee
With the aid of Most, previously
a reporter at Wounded Knee, stu
dents involved in the SCIRE
course will write sections revolv
ing around present Wounded
Knee incidents to incorporate be
tween acts of the play.
The Modoc war is still continu
ing in its most current form
through Wounded Knee," said
Wiseman. "The students will give
the Modoc experience more im
pact and relevancy for present

day audiences by paralleling it
with injustices occurring today."
According to Wiseman, who is
also a director with the San Fran
cisco Mime Troupe and Julian
Theater, the idea of the play is
somewhat a Hollywood film in re
verse.
"The world of the play is seen
through the eyes of Native Ameri
cans, and some white characters
are cast with Native American ac
tors. Seven Stanford students and
others from the San Francisco Na
tive American organization have
already been cast."
The story of "Lava Bed" cen
ters around the ordeal of Captain
Jack, the betrayed chief of the
Modoc Indians. After a period of
confinement in a reservation,
Captain Jack led his tribe back to
its original homeland in northern
California. Major railroad com
panies of the time desired the
Modoc property, and plotted to re
locate the tribe.
A series of conflicts between
the Modoc and the U.S. Army es
calated into a major war. After the
army's slaughter of Modoc
women and children, Captain Jack
and his warriors retaliated by
murdering an army general and
his peace commission, an occurr
ence which received immense
media coverage because of the
death of a general in a skirmish.
Captain Jack was defeated
when a council of his own men
sold out to the army. He was bet
rayed by the very men who had
urged him to kill the army peace
commission.

tors. Seven Stanford students and
others from the San Francisco Na
tive American organization have
already been cast."
The story of "Lava Bed" cen
ters around the ordeal of Captain
Jack, the betrayed chief of the
Modoc Indians. After a period of
confinement in a reservation,
Captain Jack led his tribe back to
its original homeland in northern
California. Major railroad com
panies of the time desired the
Modoc property, and plotted to re
locate the tribe.
A series of conflicts between
the Modoc and the U.S. Army es
calated into a major war. After the
army's slaughter of Modoc
women and children, Captain Jack
and his warriors retaliated by
murdering an army general and
his peace commission, an occurr
ence which received immense
media coverage because of the
death of a general in a skirmish.
Captain Jack was defeated
when a council of his own men
sold out to the army. He was bet
rayed by the very men who had
urged him to kill the army peace
commission.
"Lava Bed Ghost Dance," a
play depicting the plight of the
California Modoc Indians and their
confrontation with the United
States Army in 1873. will be pre
sented outdoors during two weeks
in May by the Stanford American
Indian Organization (SAIO) in con
junction with the Drama Depart
ment.
The production is the focus of a
new spring quarter SCIRE prog
ram directed by Jael Wiseman, an
instructor at the University of San
Francisco and Steven Most, au
thor of "Lava Bed."
Wiseman and Most chose Stan
ford as the most appropriate
showcase for such a production
because of the Indian mascot con
troversy and the University's Na
tive American enrollment, which is
larger than that of any Califor
man university.
The SAIO feel that this is a co
gent way of expressing their point
of view on the plight of Native
Americans continuing today,"
said Wiseman.
Wounded Knee
With the aid of Most, previously
a reporter at Wounded Knee, stu
dents involved in the SCIRE
course will write sections revolv
ing around present Wounded
Knee incidents to incorporate be
tween acts of the play.
The Modoc war is still continu
ing in its most current form
through Wounded Knee," said
Wiseman. "The students will give
the Modoc experience more im
pact and relevancy for present

day audiences by paralleling it
with injustices occurring today."
According to Wiseman, who is
also a director with the San Fran
cisco Mime Troupe and Julian
Theater, the idea of the play is
somewhat a Hollywood film in re
verse.
"The world of the play is seen
through the eyes of Native Ameri
cans, and some white characters
are cast with Native American ac
tors. Seven Stanford students and
others from the San Francisco Na
tive American organization have
already been cast."
