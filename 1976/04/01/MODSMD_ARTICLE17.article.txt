# Investigator confirms Warren report

### 
CORONADA, Calif. (AP) — An independent med
ical investigator, confirming the findings of the War
ren Commission, says only two bullets were fired at
Pres. John Kennedy and both came from the gun of
Lee Harvey Oswald.
Lattimore, an expert on medical ballistics, is pres
ident of the American Urological Association and
chairman of the Urology Department at Columbia
University School of Medicine in New York.
In a recent interview, Lattimore said that "if you
look at the evidence, both bullets were recovered
and both came out of Oswald's gun to the exclusion
of all other guns."
He discounted the claim by some investigators
that a third bullet was fired, causing then-Gov. John
Connally of Texas to flinch as he sat in the Kennedy
car.
"What Connally actually did, as I interpret it, was

that he was stunned by the first bullet that tore open
his chest and went through his wrist and buried itself
in his leg." Lattimore said.
"When he tried to take a first breath, he was
agonized so he clamped his arm over this big hole in
his side and that is what they see in the pictures."
Before striking Connally, the first bullet passed
through Kennedy's neck, severing his spinal cord at
the "C 6 segment" near the base of the skull, said
Lattimore, explaining what he described as the
reason Warren Report critics think the president
was making a defensive gesture.
"His arms fly up and that is typical of a wound in
the C 6 segment," Lattimore said. "No one has men
tioned this. He would have been a quadriplegic after
that if he had survived, but it becomes academic
because the second bullet took the whole right side
of his brain right off."
