## Minority hiring 
### 
Henry Organ

On Feb. 9. 1976. I authored an
article in the* Daily entitled Con
struction hirings biased In that
articie I expressed general dis
satisfaction with the number of
minorities working on construction
contracts at Stanford.
On Feb 24 my friend John Lerry
in the University s Planning Office
responded in the Daily with an op
posing view m an article entitled
Minority construction hiring.
Lerry s response is significant in
that he is manager of Construction
and Engineering, the office having
responsibility for affirmative action
on construction contracts.
Lerry s article is centered
around data showing the number
of minorities on Stanford construc
tion projects His data show that if
laborers are excluded there would
be an increase in minority workers
between the first quarter of 1974
and the fourth quarter of 1975,
and this is only a meager 0.3 per
cent
It's difficult to understand why
Lerry wants to exclude laborers
when there are so many minorities
in this classification. If all working
classes are included, using Ler
ry s own data, the number of
minority workers on construction
contracts at Stanford dropped a
staggering ten percent between
the first quarter of 1972 and the
last quarter of 1975!
Beyond his numerical report
there are several factors reflecting
no firm University commitment in
the area of affirmative action.

First, as the cognizant manager
of Construction and Engineering
in the Planning Office, Lerry s arti
cle reflects a bias toward explain
ing why contractors and unions
performance in affirmative action
is poor.
Second, note that the criterion
for assessing affirmative action is
best effort. It is questionable
whether the University would ac
cept such a flimsy criterion for as
sessing other contractor and
union performance, for example,
in safety, or in construction integ
rity.
Third, Lerry misquoted me in
discussing the monitoring of affir
mative action. I said that manning
is not sufficient to ensure effi
ciency in affirmative action, and I
shall continue to say that until con
tractor performance improves
Fourth, in an office having re
sponsibility for affirmative action
on construction contracts. I doubt
whether I have seen more than
one professional staff member
(out of approximately 30 in that
office in almost nine years) who is
of a racial minority.
As long as Stanford is aware of
these problems I shall continue to
state that the University is wilfully
financing racism in its construc
tion contracts — phrasing which is
apparently offensive to some
people, but which is based upon
facts.

As long as Stanford is aware of
these problems I shall continue to
state that the University is wilfully
financing racism in its construc

apparently offensive to some
people, but which is based upon
facts.

On Feb. 9. 1976. I authored an
article in the* Daily entitled Con
struction hirings biased In that
articie I expressed general dis
satisfaction with the number of
minorities working on construction
contracts at Stanford.
On Feb 24 my friend John Lerry
in the University s Planning Office
responded in the Daily with an op
posing view m an article entitled
Minority construction hiring.
Lerry s response is significant in
that he is manager of Construction
and Engineering, the office having
responsibility for affirmative action
on construction contracts.
Lerry s article is centered
around data showing the number
of minorities on Stanford construc
tion projects His data show that if
laborers are excluded there would
be an increase in minority workers
between the first quarter of 1974
and the fourth quarter of 1975,
and this is only a meager 0.3 per
cent
It's difficult to understand why
Lerry wants to exclude laborers
when there are so many minorities
in this classification. If all working
classes are included, using Ler
ry s own data, the number of
minority workers on construction
contracts at Stanford dropped a
staggering ten percent between
the first quarter of 1972 and the
last quarter of 1975!
Beyond his numerical report
there are several factors reflecting
no firm University commitment in
the area of affirmative action.

First, as the cognizant manager
of Construction and Engineering
in the Planning Office, Lerry s arti
cle reflects a bias toward explain
ing why contractors and unions
performance in affirmative action
is poor.
Second, note that the criterion
for assessing affirmative action is
best effort. It is questionable
whether the University would ac
cept such a flimsy criterion for as
sessing other contractor and
union performance, for example,
in safety, or in construction integ
rity.
Third, Lerry misquoted me in
discussing the monitoring of affir
mative action. I said that manning
is not sufficient to ensure effi
ciency in affirmative action, and I
shall continue to say that until con
tractor performance improves
Fourth, in an office having re
sponsibility for affirmative action
on construction contracts. I doubt
whether I have seen more than
one professional staff member
(out of approximately 30 in that
office in almost nine years) who is
of a racial minority.
As long as Stanford is aware of
these problems I shall continue to
state that the University is wilfully
financing racism in its construc
tion contracts — phrasing which is
apparently offensive to some
people, but which is based upon
facts.
