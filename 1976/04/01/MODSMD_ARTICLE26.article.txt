## What's behind 'Snoopy' 
### Lynnie Shemanski Shinji Eshima 
Snoopy!!! which world
premiered Dec. 9. 1975, at San
Francisco s Little Fox Theater
continues to be a smash produc
tion. The characters of Charlie
Brown. Linus. Lucy. Sally, Pep
permint Patty, Woodstock and. of
course. Snoopy take part in the
songs and dances that express
the philosophy of Charles Schultz
as found in the comic strip
Peanuts.
Not surprisingly. Snoopy!!! has
been compared to You re a Good
Man Charlie Brown. Actually,
Snoopy!!! is more like a sequel
than an imitation. The Peanuts
characters have matured in this
production. For example. Linus is
no longer inseparable from his
blanket, in fact he is seldom seen
with it.
Schultz himself was responsi
ble for this change. During a re
hearsal, he advised Jimmy
Dodge, the actor who plays Linus,
that contrary to what Dodge was
doing. Linus has grown up and no
longer was so dependent upon his
blanket
Snoopy!!! also involves the rela
tively new character of
Woodstock, who is delightfully

played by 85-pound Cathy Cahn
Cahn, a regular participant in
the Renaissance and Dickens
Faires in the area, was given two
dance steps to incorporate into
her portrayal of Woodstock. The
rest of her movements are simply
her own improvisations, and add a
marvelous touch to the musical.
Dog-bone
Don Potter also adds to the en
joyment by his brilliantly convinc
ing portrayal of Snoopy which he
accomplishes through delightfully
expressive facial expressions,
limber actions and his costume of
dog-bone" white.
The format of Snoopy!!! differs
from that of You're a Good
Man in that it is done in comic
strip-like sequences. Potter points
out that the comic strip format is
much more sophisticated" in that
the action must be extremely con
cise in order to completely ex
press the underlying theme —
much like poetry is in relation to a
full novel.
Potter finds the play "very
fulfilling. Although performing
almost daily for over two months.
Don never seems to lose his
energy, claiming that the "audi
ence response is very self
satisfymg He goes on to say that

"the audience is prepared through
the comic strip and comes already
identifying with many of the
characters. Kids also identify with
the musical in this manner."
No doubt the intimacy of the
small theater which seats no more
than 300 is very conducive to
wards providing this personal
identification which Potter claims
to be the "most important attrac
tion of this play."
Don continues that after estab
lishing this personal intimacy with
the audience the company pre
sents Snoopy!!!'s underlying
theme of finding oneself and
then completely fulfilling one's
own potential.
Delight
The real appeal of this produc
tion. however, is due to the diffe
rent ways in which children and
adults can react to it. Whereas
children simply delight in the vis
ual impact of seeing Snoopy and
Charlie Brown,ef a/.,dancing and
singing about their problems on a
stage, adults can react to the adult
humor that the dialogue uses, as
well as the mature ideas it leaves
us with.
Musically speaking, Snoopy!!!
is equally charming. All the music
is provided by two very sensitive

pianists using two uprights, an oc
casional electric keyboard for
sparkle and a small variety of per
cussion for added effects — used
especially well in Snoopy's
"bow-wow" scene.
The music written by well
known Larry Grossman with lyrics
by Hal Hackady blends well with
this production providing a full
spectrum of emotions, adding
again to the total intimacy of this
production.

Overall, if you've got the time
and a little extra moolah (tickets
are priced from $5.50 to $8.50)
GO SEE IT!!! As James Gleason
who plays Charlie Brown says,
"Everyone, at some time in their
lives can identify with good ol'
Charlie Brown."
Snoopy!!! continues at the Lit
tle Fox Theater with a perfor
mance every evening and a Sun
day matinee. Student rush tickets
are available.
