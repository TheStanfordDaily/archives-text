RENDER UNTO . . . —Students walking through White Plaza
yesterday had an opportunity to receive free green-covered
copies of the New Testament from a group handing them out.
However, about three-quarters of the students approached
chose not to accept. Those who did, discovered such fascinat
ing tidbits as that this particular version was copyrighted in 1945
by Gerrit Verkuyl.
