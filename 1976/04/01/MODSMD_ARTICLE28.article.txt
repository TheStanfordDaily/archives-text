## 'Who' make spectacular return ROCK 
### Jeff Ehrlich 
Need it be said anymore that
The Who are incredible to watch?
Probably not, but we may as well.
The "greatest fucking rock'n'roll
band in the world," as Bill Graham
accurately described them,
played two concerts last weekend
at San Francisco's Winterland —
the smallest American concert
hall they've played in years.
Saturday night they warmed up
and merely gave one of the best
San Francisco rock concerts in a
long time; Sunday night they
started hot and gave one of the
truly amazing performances in
rock history.
It seems almost redundant to
describe what The Who do on
stage that makes them the
already-legend that they are, but
it's very gratifying to report and
they're still going at it with full force
after ten years.
John Entwistle still stands like a
cement pillar on the left, playing
unbelievable riffs on his bass
guitar. Keith Moon, easily one of
the best drummers in all of rock,
still flails away at his unusually
multi-pieced drum set. In front of
this best-rhythm-section-in-all
rock'n'roll remains singer Roger
Daltrey, always moving with un

pretentious energy (as opposed to
the contrived moves of an un
coordinated monkey practiced by
the singer of a certain other major
British rock band), swinging the
microphone into space, and never
failing to catch it back on cue.
Rubber man
Then there's Pete Townshend,
rock'n'roll's all-time natural athlete
and rubber man. He didn't leap
quite as high as he's done in years
past, but his body still hits the air
(and then the floor) with as intense
passion as ever, and his arm still
windmills his guitar. Very few
moments went by when
Townshend wasn't moving his
feet in strange little dances or oc
casionally kicking high at the mic
rophone stand — when he wasn't
in the air, that is.
The show stressed Who
freakdom's favorite two albums,
Tommy and Who's Next, as well
as the four classic oldies that
they'll hopefully be playing
forever, "I Can't Explain," "Substi
tute," "Summertime Blues," and
"My Generation." From Who's
Next came John Entwistle's "My
Wife," "Behind Blue Eyes," "Baba
O'Riley," and the show-closing
"Won't Get Fooled Again," the lat
ter two songs played with the ac

companiment of taped synth
esizer tracks.
Tommy
The unified segment of Tommy
was the biggest such on-stage set
since they stopped performing the
"opera" as a whole over five years
ago: "Amazing Journey/Sparks,"
"The Acid Queen." "Fiddle About"
(a John Entwistle song featuring
Keith Moon on vocals as Uncle
Ernie), "Pinball Wizard," "I'm
Free," "Tommy's Holiday Camp"
(once again featuring Moon sing
ing his own composition), and
"We're Not Gonna Take It," featur
ing the guaranteed crowd
pleasing "See Me Feel Me/
Listening to you .. finale.
It was during this latter segment
that The Who presented their
most creative use of lights; red,
green and blue lasers projected
from behind them and went over
their heads, and up and down the
Winterland ceiling and walls.
The latest Who album, The Who
by Numbers, was all but ignored,
the only concert inclusions being
"Dreaming from the Waist," and
the accidental novelty hit
"Squeeze Box," easily the most
expendable number of the prog
ram.
Attendants of the Saturday

night concert were treated to
some rare classic bits of Who
anger, the kind of thing that domi
nated many at their shows before
they become big. Firstly,
Townshend seemed fairly moody
at the start and it took him a while
to get into playing. And just before
"My Generation." Daltrey twice
swung his microphone at a photo
grapher near the front of the
stage, chucked the mike across
the stage when he discovered it
didn't work, threw a spare mike
stand at a speaker cabinet, and
then quickly picked up a spare
mike and delivered a very strong
vocal for the song.
Then it was Townshend's turn
again; during "Won't Get Fooled
Again" he kept telling the sound
man to turn up the volume, which
the latter didn't do until
Townshend abruptly stopped
playing guitar and spelled the
word "up" with his finger in the air
(don't get the wrong idea; there's

little change in The Who son-stage
sound if Townshend stops, as En
twistle s bass carries the bulk of
it).
Sunday night's audience didn t
get to see any anger, but they got
a much better show. It took but the
first four chords of the opening
song. "I Can't Explain," to get
Townshend in the air and non
stop all over the stage, and
throughout the show Daltrey and
Townshend were smiling and
seeming quite pleased with each
other's moves.
The two have never become
real friends on a personal level, so
you could tell how great a show
they did when Townshend hug
ged Daltrey as they all took their
bows at the end.
Those who missed out on see
ing The Who last weekend will
probably have the chance to catch
them this summer at a "Day On
The Green' concert at the Oak
land Coliseum.
