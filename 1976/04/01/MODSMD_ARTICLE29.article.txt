# 'Yeoman' is sparkling
## 
### Perry Simon 
In one of the most delightful en
tertainment treats offered in San
Francisco. the venerable
Lamplighters, who have been
producing Gilbert and Sullivan
operettas locally for the past 25
years, have once again
triumphed
The Yeomen of the Guard, the
Lamplighters most recent offer
ing, is the only Gilbert and Sullivan
work with a realistic plot. Set in
16th century England, with many
English folktune themes. Sullivan
successfully created a haunting
atmosphere with beautiful music:
combined with Gilbert's poignant
libretto, it is a highly satisfying
piece of musical theatre.
This ope etta had its world pre

mtere October 3,1888, in London,
and it was last performed by the
Lamplighters in the fall of 1972.
Their present production is
characterized by bright, clean
choreography that is delightfully
integrated into the spirit of the
music and the dramatic progress
of the plot. It is colorfully staged in
a manner that accents the subtle
twists of gaiety, poignancy, and
irony that run throughout the
show.
The many facets of love consti
tute the major theme of The
Yeoman of the Guard. The story
concerns a handsome young Col
onel condemned to death, to the
chagrin of two amorous maids.
Baker Peeples. as Colonel Fair
fax, possessed a crystal clear

tenor voice and an ingratiating
stage presence that caused his
warm personality to sweep the
theatre His two female admirers,
portrayed by Ellen Kerrigan as
Phoebe and Rosemary Bock as
Elsie, were both endearing ac
tresses with strong, melodic sing
ing voices.
The ill-fated Jack Point (a jester
in love with Elsie) and Wilfred (a
jailer in love with Phoebe) were
perfect companions in misery,
and their tightly choreographed
duet midway in Act II was one of
the high points.
The Yeoman of the Guard will
have its final two performances
this Friday and Saturday evenings
at the Presentation Theatre in San
Francisco.
