# Flu virus may plague nation

WASHINGTON— Bubonic
plague is a dreaded killer, while flu
is a common nuisance, in most
people's minds.
The first evokes visions of the
fearsome Black Death of the Mid
dle Ages; the last is an irksome
affliction that makes sufferers
miss a few days from work.
But this is a misconception. In
fluenza actually is the last of the
great plagues that still threatens
man. Throughout history it has
caused more deaths than bubonic
plague.
In recent years, less than 200
deaths annually have been attri
buted to bubonic plague. But last
October a flu epidemic claimed
600 lives on New Guinea alone.
Global cycles
Every 10 or 11 years the world
is swept by an influenza pandemic
that kills thousands and makes
millions feel miserable.
So when an 18-year-old victim
died in February of flu at Fort Dix,
N.J., nearly 100 private and gov
ernment experts in the disease
met in Washington with drug firm
representatives. Federal medical

officials asked the manufacturers
to speed production of a new vac
cine to combat this latest type of
flu.
"The sentiment of the group
was that we'd better be prepared."
explained Paul Parkman, deputy
director of biologies of the Food
and Drug Administration.
The scientists aren't expecting
any widespread outbreak of the
new strain of the disease at this
time because the flu season is
nearly over. They want to be sure
adequate supplies of vaccine are
available to check a possible out
break next winter.
They took this precaution in part
because the unusual flu virus at
Fort Dix could prove similar to the
one thought to have been respon
sible for the great influenza pan
demic of 1918-19.
Origin uncertain
Flu viruses weren't discovered
until the 19305, so no one can be
certain which strain took such a
deadly toll in the winter of 1918.
There are indications, however,
that it was a form of the flu that
afflicts pigs and hogs. And the
cases in New Jersey apparently
were caused by an unusual hybrid

of this swine virus.
The 1918-19 pandemic struck
roughly one out of every 10 per
sons then living and proved fatal
to some 20 million, including
about 500,000 in the United
States.
Probably many of the so-called
flu victims died of other causes.
Weakened by influenza, they suc
cumbed to infections that would
be cleared up today with antibio
tics.
Vaccines needed
But antibiotics, effective against
bacteria, cannot stop the viruses
that cause flu. Instead, vaccines
are needed.
Although some people question
the value of "flu shots," physicians
say the vaccines are effective.
The problem is that influenza dis
plays an astonishing versatility.
Almost as fast as a vaccine is
developed to fight one form of the
disease, the virus modifies its
chemical makeup and strikes in a
new form — requiring a new vac
cine.
That's why next year's innocula
tions are being prepared in
laboratories now.
