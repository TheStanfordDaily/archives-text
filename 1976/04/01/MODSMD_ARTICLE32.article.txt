Reagan airs views
LOS ANGELES — Ronald Reagan, in a
nationwide television speech designed to
redefine primary campaign issues, said
yesterday the nation is wandering without
aim in its foreign policy and dangerously
inferior in military strength.
In the half-hour address, which cost him

$86,000, the former California governor co
vered familiar grou nd but sought to take the
offensive against President Gerald Ford in
a national forum.
I believe in the peace of which Mr. Ford
spoke — as much as any man. But peace
does not come from weakness or from re
treat It comes from the restoration of
American militar" superiority." Reagan
said.
He canceled a number of personal ap
pearances following his March 23 primary
election victory over Ford in North Carolina
to prepare for the taping.
Earlier in the campaign, the former gov
ernor had been put on the defense by his
statements on government spending cuts
and Social Security reform that came under
sharp questioning.
S.F. hit by strike
SAN FRANCISCO — Municipal workers
struck San Francisco yesterday in a wage
dispute that shut down cable cars, street
cars and buses, sharply reduced city ser
vices, and threatened to spread to hospi
tals.
Most of San Francisco's 677,000 resi
dents, stung nearly two years ago by a
nine-day massive citywide strike, feared
the current walkout might escalate despite
a court order banning it.
John Crowley, secretary of the San Fran
cisco labor council, said picket lines would

go up at the hospitals within hours if the
Board of Supervisors failed to resume
negotiations.
Members of the Service Employes Inter
national Union representing hospital work
ers settled with the city on a contract last
week. However, they scheduled a meeting
later yesterday to decide whether to honor
picket lines.
City attorneys secured a temporary rest
raining order against the strike from
Superior Court Judge Henry Rolph but op
posing lawyers wrangled most of the day on
how it will be served.
A spokesman in the city attorney's office
said the serving process was expected to
take until tomorrow and a hearing was
scheduled for Monday.
Quinlan allowed to die
TRENTON, N.J. — Karen Anne Quin
lan's father won the right in New Jersey
Supreme Court yesterday to allow his com
atose daughter to die, climaxing a legal bat
tle he began almost a year ago.
The court, in a 7-0 ruling, appointed
Joseph Quinlan legal guardian of his 22-
year-old daughter and said he could let her
die if he can find competent medical au
thorities who agree with him that there is no
reasonable possibility of her recovery.
The New Jersey attorney general said
there would be no immediate decision on
whether the state would appeal the deci

sion. Joseph and Julia Quinlan said they
would not ask to have their daughter's re
spirator disconnected until the state has
time to decide on a possible appeal.
Arms deadline missed
WASHINGTON — Despite progress to
ward on-site inspection of underground
nuclear test sites, U.S. and Soviet
negotiators have failed to meet their dead
line for completing a treaty limiting peaceful
nuclear explosions, the U.S. disarmament
chief said yesterday.
Fred C. Ikle, director of the Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency, said, however,
that "just a few issues" remain unresolved
and that completion of the treaty could
come within 60 days.
U.S. officials report progress on all
points, particularly on-site inspection, but
say technical difficulties remain.
However. Ikle emphasized that "we can
now clearly see the end of the road'' and
"negotiations have moved ahead and
made real progress, particularly in recent
weeks."
A top Ford administration official said
Tuesday that American and Soviet
negotiators meeting in Moscow reached
basic agreement on the on-site inspections,
which the Russians traditionally have op
posed. But he. too. said some details re
main to be hammered out.
Today's weather
Fair today and tomorrow. Continued
cool. Lows tonight in the 40s. Highs today
and tomorrow mainly in the 60s. North
westerly winds 15 to 20 mph diminishing
tonight.
