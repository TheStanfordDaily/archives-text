# Present COP a failure

The Council of Presidents
(COP) presides over offices in
Tresidder Union, a sizeable
budget, an impressive array of
student services (and the poten
tial for more) and the best base
for student advocacy by students
in the University.
The COP currently leaving of
fice proposed a great deal just one
year ago. They have ac
complished little — and, perhaps
more importantly, have been
more silent and inactive as stu
dent advocates than any COP in
recent years.
Contributing to growth and
change in important areas of stu
dent interest is difficult work,
sometimes taking years to ac
complish. The visibility of the
COP. year after year advocating
student services, affirmative ac
tion, undergraduate education
and graduate student concerns, is
essential to the accomplishment
of important goals in these areas.
The end of this council's year in
office leaves much unfinished
business — and the need to recall,
after a year of COP invisibility, just
what that business is.
Women's groups
This COP proposed "the estab
lishment of a women's building, to
house the various women's or
ganizations currently scattered
around campus.' Instead, the
Women's Center was moved out
of center campus, while the Wo
men s Coordinating Committee, a
network of those scattered or
ganizations. was allowed to lapse.
There has been no COP atten
tion to the absence of an on-line
woman staff member in the Office
of Student Activities: their support
for Center for Research on
Women (CROW), the immensely
popular Women's Day of other
years, and the issues of child care
and single parents, has been neg
ligible.
The present council promised
attention to graduate student is
sues. a task force on graduate
students, and attention to Escon

dido Village. They've done no
thing.
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) has stepped into the vac
uum with effectiveness — but both
the GSC and the ASSU as a whole
would have much to gain from
COP/GSC cooperation and coor
dination. There's also the small
but significant failure of the current
COP. despite campaign promises
a year ago, to work for a polling
place in Escondido Village for
ASSU elections.
This COP emphasized in their
campaign last year the impor
tance of the committee staff assis
tant to students on committees,
and to the ASSU as a whole.
Though they added an additional
position to the one established by
a previous COP. the current COP.
in response to complaints from the
ASSU Senate, disclaimed all re
sponsibility for the performance of
the staff assistants.
Student trustee
The COP also proposed a stu
dent trustee for Stanford, saying,
"we are confident we can do it."
They haven't.
A report on undergraduate ad
missions and financial aid was
supported by this COP—but it has
gone nowhere. Long on rhetoric,
short on substantive data and
feasible proposals (in sharp con
trast to a similar study by the
GSC), the report has ac
complished nothing but the pub
licizing of its authors' names.
Meanwhile, minority and low in
come recruitment and support in
this time of budget crisis are under
severe pressure at both under
graduate and graduate levels.
This year's disappointing COP
has contributed a great deal to
disaffection with the ASSU. (At
considerable cost, they redeco
rated the ASSU offices, moving
out of the accessible lobby and up
to the loft, a significant symbolic
statement)
The fact that barely half the un
dergraduate and virtually no
graduate students voted in the fa!!

ASSU senate elections is a vote of
no confidence — well deserved,
unfortunately, by the COP.
Great deal
However — the Council of Pres
idents can do a great deal. Prom
ises that were explicit and found to
be feasible before they were
made, and proposals based on
data rather than rhetoric were
realized with a great deal of hard
work by previous councils.
The COP currently leaving of
fice ran on a platform of things
they couldn't do — and got
nowhere. To merely state, as one
candidate already has in the cur
rent election campaign, that "stu
dents should have a lot more con
trol over the University," ac
complishes nothing either.
All this is platform rhetoric,
aimed at winning elections — but
no further. As the Daily warned
last year at this time, "candidates
have a responsibility to consider
how much can reasonably be ac
complished and how it can be
done."
If we elect such responsible
candidates in the current elec
tions, the COP can serve us well in
the coming year and accomplish a
great deal for us and those who
follow us at Stanford.
