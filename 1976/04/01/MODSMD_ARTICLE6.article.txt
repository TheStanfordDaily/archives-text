## Teamsters strike in some cities 
### 
ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, 111.
(AP) â€” The Teamsters union and
the trucking industry failed to
reach agreement on a new na
tional contract by early this morn
ing as a strike deadline passed,
the chief negotiator for the truck
ing industry said.
William Mclntyre, the industry's
negotiator, said negotiations con
tinued. But thousands of drivers
across the country set up picket
lines and went on strike.
Mclntyre made his announce

ment more than two hours after
the old National Master Freight
Agreement between the
Teamsters and the truckers had
expired at 12:01 p.m. PST yester
day.
"I regret to say that as of this
hour we have been unable to
reach a settlement," Mclntyre
said. "As it stands from other re
ports, the industry is on strike in
substantial portions of the coun
try. We are going to continue the

bargaining process. Hopefully
sometime we can produce a con
tract that will stabilize the trans
portation system of the country."
Meanwhile, some Teamsters
along the East Coast and in De
troit started picketing.
The Teamsters Union repre
sents 400,000 drivers who handle
60 percent of the nation s man
ufactured goods. A nationwide
strike would be the first since the
union started negotiating master
contracts in 1964.
Teamsters Local 299, the
biggest in the Detroit area, said
pickets were out around the city. A
spokesman said 500 Detroit firms
are under contract and a majority
were unofficially on strike, while
16 firms had signed interim ag
reements and were being permit
ted by Teamsters to operate.
