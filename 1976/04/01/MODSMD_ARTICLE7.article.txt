# 'Great Society' underway
## 
### Jacob Young 
John Seidl, a lecturer in public
management at the Graduate
School of Business, discussed the
aura of confusion which sur
rounds the relative success and
effectiveness of the massive so
cial reforms undertaken in the Un
ited States from 1965 to 1969 at
Cubberly Auditorium last night.
This lecture was the first in a
series dealing with the Great Soc
iety, which Seidl defined as a so
cial and political concept of federal
intervention in social reform as re
flected in the social programs of
1965 to 1969 such as the Medi
care and Model Cities programs.
The series forms the basis of a
class called "How Great Was the
Great Society?" The class is listed
in both the Business School and
the Program on Urban Studies
schedules and will consist of de
bates and lectures by representa
tives of several fields.
Among the guests for the quar
ter are former Treasury Secretary
George Schultz, former Health,
Education and Welfare Secretary
Caspar Weinberger and
Economics Prof. George Bach.
Topics for discussion include
health care programs, education
and manpower and welfare re
form.
Funded by the Fairleigh Dickin
son Symposium Fund in the form
of honorariums and travel ex
penses for the speakers, the class
meets on Wednesdays at 7 p.m. in
Cubberley e2.
The course was designed by
Seidl, Asst. Business Prof. John
Mollenkopf and Arthur Hauptman,
who is on leave from the Brook
ings Institute.
In selecting the speakers, the
organizers tried to create a ba
lance between radical, liberal and

conservative opinion, Seidl said.
Commenting on the structure of
the class, Seidl said the intention
was to create "a real clash of
ideas on the issues ... a kind of
head to head debate by the
speakers."
He urged students and visitors
from the community to consider
carefully the history of social re
form through governmental
means in thinking about the fu
ture.
"The social programs of the 70s
and 80s will reflect many facets of
the Great Society ... No matter
who is making the decisions, they
will take cases from the 60s and
early 705," he said.
