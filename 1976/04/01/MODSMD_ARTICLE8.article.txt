# Unions criticize plant closure

Officials of four labor unions have voiced discon
tent over the possible layoffs of their members which
would result from the probable closure of the Uni
versity Press' printing operation.
The University is not interested in any alterna
tives," said Morris Goldman, first vice president of
the Bay Area Typographical Union Local 21. "We
think the real reason for the proposed closure is to
get rid of us."
About 40 press workers from five union locals
would lose their jobs through a closure. A meeting
was called yesterday morning by Douglas Barton,
University counsel for employe relations, to discuss
severance pay arrangements with union officials.
"We asked Barton about possible alternatives,
but he had no proposals," said Rich Hanford, presi
dent of Graphic Arts International Union Local 3-B.
'No dialogue'
"There was no dialogue at all about the pos
sibilities of workers keeping their jobs. The meeting
was clearly a one way street."
"We are not happy at all about the situation,"
added Hanford.
Barton said a final decision will be reached Mon
day.
Both Goldman and Hanford claim that their unions
offered to help the University update its printing
equipment and to explain more efficient procedures.
However, the University ignored input from any
printing union in its tentative decision to close print
ing operations, Goldman claimed.
But according to Barton, the real issue involves
neither the efficiency of the machinery nor the vari
ety of technological innovations available.
Realistically possible?
"The crux of the decision lies in whether it is
realistically possible for the University to make a
significant capital investment in a facility when there
is uncertainty in the facility's ability to utilize its ex
panded plant capacity," said Barton.
He said in effect that the expected low usage
volume of the press cannot justify the huge invest
ment in its renovation. The other alternative is com
plete closure of the facility.
Barton noted that such an investment would in
volve around $1 million.
In addition, Barton said that the solicitation of
outside non-University business for the printing ser
vices would jeopardize the University's tax-exempt
status.
Notice of intentions
"The University should have given us notice
about its intentions to shut down the press long
before now." said Vincent Passanisi, recording and

financial secretary for Graphic Arts International
Local 280.
Passanisi said after the meeting yesterday that
his union had been informed of the tentative closure
"only three days ago."
Passanisi said that Barton wanted a formal prop
osal from the printing unions on severance pay ar
rangements by tomorrow
He noted that the unions will try to get their laid off
workers "as much as they ve got coming" in sever
ance pay. pensions and other benefits, but that it
would be "pretty hard" to make any definite propos
als on such short notice.
"We didn't know enough about the situation until
(yesterday's) meeting anyway," added Passanisi
Hanford also said his union will do "anything pos
sible" to hold the jobs of the press workers, but that it
would be "very difficult."
Should the University decide to go ahead with the
