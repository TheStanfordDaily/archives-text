# Music: relaxing with the glee club
## 
### Robin Mirov 
At rehearsals Stanford Glee Club members
lean forward in their seats, concentrating to
weave their voices together to create the
mood of the songs. They then break for club
announcements and to sing "Happy Birthday'
to deserving members.
The philosophy of the Glee Club is to blend
musical quality with social interaction, accord
ing to club publicity manager Darian Morray.
"It's more than just a singing group, - ' says
Morray. "It's a group of people with similar
interests who can go out and have a good
time."
The group, composed of 30 male and 30
female voices, produces a diverse program of
classical and popular music. A typical perfor
mance begins with such formal classical
pieces as Bach and Beethoven. A 21-piece
orchestra accompanies show tunes and
novelty numbers during the second half.
Theatre lighting dramatizes the acts to form a
musical variety show emceed by Glee Club

Director Robert MacKinnon.
MacKinnon, who has directed the group
since 1963, is a trained singer, clarinetist, ar
ranger and conductor. He is responsible for
the unorthodox use of widely contrasting
styles and media in the clubs choral music.
Founded in 1895, the Stanford Glee Club
was patterned after the existing groups at
Harvard and Yale. The first club was all-male
and composed of 13 singers and two accom
panists.
By 1923 there were 62 members in the
group. That year, the club received an invita
tion from the Mexican President to tour that
country at the expense of the Mexican gov
ernment. Director Warren Allen refused the
offer due to demands on the time of his stu
dents. Instead, he took the group on atour Df
southern California which included a perfor
mance at the Coconut Grove at the Ambas
sador Hotel in Lob Angeles.
The tradition of important performances
and tours has continued today. In the past ten

years, the Glee Club and Orchestra have un
dertaken six tours.
During the most recent spring break, the
group toured central and southern California,
performing in Stockton, Merced, Visalia,
Bakersfield, Long Beach, San Diego and Ven
tura.
The club was sponsored at each of these
stops by alumni members. "The trip thus pro
vides not only a musical opportunity for the
members,but also an opportunity to meet and
share experiences with alumni, says Morray
"Onr of the club's main goals is to work as a
good will ambassador for the University,
says MacKinnon, explaining that the group
works to create a good public relations image
in its performances.
The Glee Club opened its membership to
women in 1969. according to Morray The
group has had to change with the times.' he
says."I don't think men would be as in
terested in participating in all-men as coed
At least twice as many men and women as
can be accepted audition each year for the
places in the club, according to MacKinnon.
And because he has a large selection of
people to choose from, the qualty of singing
rises each year, he says.
The club generally enjoys a relaxed atmos
phere. according to Morray. However, "In a
tour year things do get more serious," he
says. "This year, especially, we're working to
perfect the show."
There are three rehearsals a week,with an
occasional performance taking the place of a
practice.
Members receive one unit of credit.
Throughout the year the Glee Club also
tries to organize social events for members
outside of rehearsals. Morray says. "That's
what keeps the club going when the rehear
sals are grueling."
"Off campus performances make members
feel more a part of the Palo Alto community
rather than just the Stanford community," ag
rees senior Anita Meister. "People forget all
their anxieties and hang-ups about school
work and just go to have a really fun time."

Founded in 1895, the Stanford Glee Club
was patterned after the existing groups at
Harvard and Yale. The first club was all-male
and composed of 13 singers and two accom
panists.
By 1923 there were 62 members in the
group. That year, the club received an invita
tion from the Mexican President to tour that
country at the expense of the Mexican gov
ernment. Director Warren Allen refused the
offer due to demands on the time of his stu
dents. Instead, he took the group on atour Df
southern California which included a perfor
mance at the Coconut Grove at the Ambas
sador Hotel in Lob Angeles.
The tradition of important performances
and tours has continued today. In the past ten

years, the Glee Club and Orchestra have un
dertaken six tours.
During the most recent spring break, the
group toured central and southern California,
performing in Stockton, Merced, Visalia,
Bakersfield, Long Beach, San Diego and Ven

The club was sponsored at each of these
stops by alumni members. "The trip thus pro
vides not only a musical opportunity for the
members,but also an opportunity to meet and
share experiences with alumni, says Morray

At least twice as many men and women as
can be accepted audition each year for the
places in the club, according to MacKinnon.
And because he has a large selection of
people to choose from, the qualty of singing
rises each year, he says.
The club generally enjoys a relaxed atmos
phere. according to Morray. However, "In a
tour year things do get more serious," he
says. "This year, especially, we're working to
perfect the show."
There are three rehearsals a week,with an
occasional performance taking the place of a
practice.
Members receive one unit of credit.
Throughout the year the Glee Club also
tries to organize social events for members
outside of rehearsals. Morray says. "That's
what keeps the club going when the rehear
sals are grueling."
"Off campus performances make members
feel more a part of the Palo Alto community
rather than just the Stanford community," ag
rees senior Anita Meister. "People forget all
their anxieties and hang-ups about school
work and just go to have a really fun time."
