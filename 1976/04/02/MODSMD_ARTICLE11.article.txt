# Bonhoeffer's writings still relevant
## 
### 
I o/fer here a eulogy for a man 1 have
come to respect and admire.
Exactly one week hence will mark the
31st anniversary of his death. On April 9,
1945 Dietrich Bonhoeffer was hanged by
the Nazis.
Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a German
Lutheran theologian possessed of an ex
traordinarily keen insight. Active in the re
sistance to the Nazis from the beginning, he
was eventually executed for his complicity
in the "officer's plot" to kill Hitler.
Bonhoeffer was introduced to me in a
course taught by Religious Studies Prof.
Robert McAfee Brown, a man of mettle
similar to Bonhoeffer's own. Out of
gratitude toward Brown this column has
been written.
Contemporary relevance
Bonhoeffer's life and writings are worthy
of our attention by virtue of their contem
porary, summary relevance. Bonhoeffer,
reflecting on his own situation, consistently
transcended it by laying bare the universal
tensions of which it was composed.
As a result, he, to borrow a phrase from
the theologians, continues to speak directly
to us where we are now.
The richness of Bonhoeffer's thought
presents many examples of such "im
mediateness." Perhaps best are those con
tained within the prologue to the posthum
ously edited Letters and Papers from Prison.
Written just prior to his arrest, "After
Ten Years: A Reckoning made at New Year
1943" is a series of "conclusions related to
the business of human life, put down one
after the other, the only connection bet
ween them buing that of concrete experi
ence."
One conclusion
One of the conclusions reached in the
essay is that sometimes we are "compelled

to grapple seriously with the ethical prob
lem of success." Does the success of a given
enterprise endow it with goodness?
After all, success does make history, as
Kissinger continually reminds us.
Yet, as Bonhoeffer writes elsewhere, "if
success in the measure of all things, it
makes no essential difference whether it is
so in a positive or in a negative sense."

As we read about a U.S. foreign
policy recognizing another military dic
tatorship in Argentina, sig.iing a friend
ship pact with thugs in Brazil or loaning
$30 million to murderers in Chile, surely
we should begin to wonder if such success is
not sick.
All the recent examples of splendid cor
porate success (in Italy or Japan for in
stance) should give further causefor won
der.
Problem of success
Bonhoeffer warns that the problem of
success achieved by evil means "cannot be
adequately dealt with either by arm-chair
criticism, which means a refusal to face
facts, or by opportunism, which means giv
ing up the struggle and surrendering to suc
cess. "Each of us shares in the moulding of
history.
Abstract principle must yield to "con
crete responsibility" — a responsibility not

to ourselves but to the coming generatiork.
There are no facile answers.
In his New Year's reckoning Bonhoeffer
also writes of the danger of folly. As we
watch the balloons and confetti this sum
mer, much of what he says should be kept in
mind.
Folly Bonhoeffer identifies as the means
by which men lose their independent
judgment. As a result, "the fool will be cap
able of any evil and at the same time incap
able of seeing that it is evil."
Folly stands as a defect of one's moral
rather than intellectual character.
Dealing with slogans
In talking to the fool Bonhoeffer fimjjs
that "one feels that one is dealing, not witn
the man himself, but with slogans, catch
words, and the like, which have taken hold
of him."
Let us hope we elect someone who ex
pects more from people's independence of
mind than from their folly. Let us hope we
elect a man and not a fool this time.
It is a testament to Bonhoeffer's enduring
quality that in the midst of German folly
and Nazi success he did not lose hope. He
retained his optimism, his "will for the fu
ture" by recognizing that "the essence of
optimism is not its view of the present, but
the fact that it is the inspiration of life and
hope when others give in."
With such an attitude Bonhoeffer was
able to write for the future, for the coming
generation.
We are part of that future for which he
wrote; his words are directed toward us. I
have the feeling that it is our responsibility
to read them; it would be folly not to do so.-$

I o/fer here a eulogy for a man 1 have
come to respect and admire.
Exactly one week hence will mark the
31st anniversary of his death. On April 9,
1945 Dietrich Bonhoeffer was hanged by
the Nazis.
Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a German
Lutheran theologian possessed of an ex
traordinarily keen insight. Active in the re
sistance to the Nazis from the beginning, he
was eventually executed for his complicity
in the "officer's plot" to kill Hitler.
Bonhoeffer was introduced to me in a
course taught by Religious Studies Prof.
Robert McAfee Brown, a man of mettle
similar to Bonhoeffer's own. Out of
gratitude toward Brown this column has
been written.
Contemporary relevance
Bonhoeffer's life and writings are worthy
of our attention by virtue of their contem
porary, summary relevance. Bonhoeffer,
reflecting on his own situation, consistently
transcended it by laying bare the universal
tensions of which it was composed.
As a result, he, to borrow a phrase from
the theologians, continues to speak directly
to us where we are now.
The richness of Bonhoeffer's thought
presents many examples of such "im
mediateness." Perhaps best are those con
tained within the prologue to the posthum
ously edited Letters and Papers from Prison.
Written just prior to his arrest, "After
Ten Years: A Reckoning made at New Year
1943" is a series of "conclusions related to
the business of human life, put down one
after the other, the only connection bet
ween them buing that of concrete experi
ence."
One conclusion
One of the conclusions reached in the
essay is that sometimes we are "compelled

to grapple seriously with the ethical prob
lem of success." Does the success of a given
enterprise endow it with goodness?
After all, success does make history, as
Kissinger continually reminds us.
Yet, as Bonhoeffer writes elsewhere, "if
success in the measure of all things, it
makes no essential difference whether it is
so in a positive or in a negative sense."

As we read about a U.S. foreign
policy recognizing another military dic
tatorship in Argentina, sig.iing a friend
ship pact with thugs in Brazil or loaning
$30 million to murderers in Chile, surely
we should begin to wonder if such success is
not sick.
All the recent examples of splendid cor
porate success (in Italy or Japan for in
stance) should give further causefor won
der.
Problem of success
Bonhoeffer warns that the problem of
success achieved by evil means "cannot be
adequately dealt with either by arm-chair
criticism, which means a refusal to face
facts, or by opportunism, which means giv
ing up the struggle and surrendering to suc
cess. "Each of us shares in the moulding of
history.
Abstract principle must yield to "con
crete responsibility" — a responsibility not

to ourselves but to the coming generatiork.
There are no facile answers.
In his New Year's reckoning Bonhoeffer
also writes of the danger of folly. As we
watch the balloons and confetti this sum
mer, much of what he says should be kept in
mind.
Folly Bonhoeffer identifies as the means
by which men lose their independent
judgment. As a result, "the fool will be cap
able of any evil and at the same time incap
able of seeing that it is evil."
Folly stands as a defect of one's moral
rather than intellectual character.
Dealing with slogans
In talking to the fool Bonhoeffer fimjjs
that "one feels that one is dealing, not witn
the man himself, but with slogans, catch
words, and the like, which have taken hold
of him."
Let us hope we elect someone who ex
pects more from people's independence of
mind than from their folly. Let us hope we
elect a man and not a fool this time.
It is a testament to Bonhoeffer's enduring
quality that in the midst of German folly
and Nazi success he did not lose hope. He
retained his optimism, his "will for the fu
ture" by recognizing that "the essence of
optimism is not its view of the present, but
the fact that it is the inspiration of life and
hope when others give in."
With such an attitude Bonhoeffer was

that "one feels that one is dealing, not witn
the man himself, but with slogans, catch
words, and the like, which have taken hold
of him."
Let us hope we elect someone who ex
pects more from people's independence of
mind than from their folly. Let us hope we
elect a man and not a fool this time.
It is a testament to Bonhoeffer's enduring
quality that in the midst of German folly
and Nazi success he did not lose hope. He
retained his optimism, his "will for the fu
ture" by recognizing that "the essence of
optimism is not its view of the present, but
the fact that it is the inspiration of life and
hope when others give in."
With such an attitude Bonhoeffer was
able to write for the future, for the coming
generation.
We are part of that future for which he
wrote; his words are directed toward us. I
have the feeling that it is our responsibility
to read them; it would be folly not to do so.-$
