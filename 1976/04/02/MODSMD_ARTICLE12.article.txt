# All drugs should be legalized
##

Marc Strassman

Would anything really bad, or
worse than what is happening
now, happen if all currently il
legal drugs were made legal
overnight?
For one, organized crime
would be deprived of extensive
earnings from its trade in he
roin. Marijuana importers who
make private fortunes flying
and boating tons of grass into
the United States would no
longer reap outrageous profits.
Police now employed track
ing down and busting drug
users and distributors would
have to find something else to
do, as would courts and prisons
who process and cage drug
users and distributors. A world
without these things might be a
better place.
Some benefits might appear,
too, with drugs legal, and at last
operating within the dynamics
of an open market, and not a
black one.
Prices would drop sharply. In
the case of heroin, this would

mean that users could afford to
support their habits without
constantly resorting to theft and
mugging.
A free market in heroin would
also improve the quality of drug
consumed, with a resulting low
ering of deaths from impure
preparations. With heroin
prices lower, and enormous
profits no longer possible, pres
sure from organized crime en
couraging use of this drug
would fall off, and so might use
of the drug itself.
With legalization of
marijuana the resulting lower
prices would probably mean
more widespread and frequent
use of the drug. Individuals who
are now deterred from smoking
or eating grass because of re
sidual reluctance tobreak a law,
or who don't want to pay $20 or
more an ounce for the stuff,
would no longer have to over
come these objections and im
pediments.
More stoned people wander
ing around would slow down
the pace of things, increase con
templative modes of behavior,
increase aesthetic appreciation
of music, landscapes and other
people, and make a lot of folks
feel good. People would fight
less, eat more ice cream and
laugh more.
Less energy
Marijuana makes less seem
like more, and a well-toasted
community or nation could
maintain itself at a level of
material and psychological
well-being with the expenditure
of far less energy, an important
consideration in an age of im
pending scarcity.
This is not to mention all the
good marijuana can do by get
ting people off of alcohol, which
costs more, causes liver and
brain damage and encourages
more violent behavior than
grass does.
On the global scale legaliza
tion of grass and hash would do
important and beneficial things
for the economies of underde
veloped countries and the
livelihood of the poor people
who live in them. With a legal
market operating free of un

derworld and governmental
constraints, the peasants who
now grow the products and re
ceive extremely low wages for
their work in the hot sun oftheir
tropical countries would be able
to get higher prices for their
plants.
They could probably get even
higher prices if they get together
into a producer's cartel, an Or
ganization of Marijuana Export
ing Countries.
Making psychedelics legal
would eliminate current prob
lems of impurities, indetermi
nate dosages and gross unav
ailability of such potentially be
neficial substances as mes
caline, psilosybin and LSD.
Cocaine's effect
It's harder to say what might
happen to cocaine use if this
popular treat were legalized.
Probablya lot more Andean hill
sides would be planted in coca
bushes, and a lot more people
would energize, euphoricize
and eulogize on account of this
drug.
With drugs legal and there-

fore more acceptable, it would
at least he possible to open drug
emporiums offering extensive
selections of marijuana, hash
ish, psycheledics and
euphoriants from all over the
world.
A tasting room, a restaurant
and juice bar serving fruit
drinks, pancakes, omelettes,
soups and other delicacies all
laced with cannabis and can
nabis derivatives would provide
an enjoyable retreat for world
weary students. workers,
housewives, executives, hippies
and whatever other categories
of people are now current.
One could, of course, try out
the drug of one's choice in the
restaurant or music listening
room, then buy a quantity to
take home.
Everything considered, a
world where drugs were legal
would be a happier, saner place
and the people in it just might be
somewhat happierthan they am
today.

Would anything really bad, or
worse than what is happening
now, happen if all currently il
legal drugs were made legal
overnight?
For one, organized crime
would be deprived of extensive
earnings from its trade in he
roin. Marijuana importers who
make private fortunes flying
and boating tons of grass into
the United States would no
longer reap outrageous profits.
Police now employed track
ing down and busting drug
users and distributors would
have to find something else to
do, as would courts and prisons
who process and cage drug
users and distributors. A world
without these things might be a
better place.
Some benefits might appear,
too, with drugs legal, and at last
operating within the dynamics
of an open market, and not a
black one.
Prices would drop sharply. In
the case of heroin, this would

mean that users could afford to
support their habits without
constantly resorting to theft and
mugging.
A free market in heroin would
also improve the quality of drug
consumed, with a resulting low
ering of deaths from impure
preparations. With heroin
prices lower, and enormous
profits no longer possible, pres
sure from organized crime en
couraging use of this drug
would fall off, and so might use
of the drug itself.
With legalization of
marijuana the resulting lower
prices would probably mean
more widespread and frequent
use of the drug. Individuals who
are now deterred from smoking
or eating grass because of re
sidual reluctance tobreak a law,
or who don't want to pay $20 or
more an ounce for the stuff,
would no longer have to over
come these objections and im
pediments.
More stoned people wander
ing around would slow down
the pace of things, increase con
templative modes of behavior,
increase aesthetic appreciation
of music, landscapes and other
people, and make a lot of folks
feel good. People would fight
less, eat more ice cream and
laugh more.
Less energy
Marijuana makes less seem
like more, and a well-toasted
community or nation could
maintain itself at a level of
material and psychological
well-being with the expenditure
of far less energy, an important
consideration in an age of im
pending scarcity.
This is not to mention all the
good marijuana can do by get
ting people off of alcohol, which
costs more, causes liver and
brain damage and encourages
more violent behavior than
grass does.
On the global scale legaliza
tion of grass and hash would do
important and beneficial things
for the economies of underde
veloped countries and the
livelihood of the poor people
who live in them. With a legal
market operating free of un

derworld and governmental
constraints, the peasants who
now grow the products and re
ceive extremely low wages for
their work in the hot sun oftheir
tropical countries would be able
to get higher prices for their
plants.
They could probably get even
higher prices if they get together
into a producer's cartel, an Or
ganization of Marijuana Export
ing Countries.
Making psychedelics legal
would eliminate current prob
lems of impurities, indetermi
nate dosages and gross unav
ailability of such potentially be
neficial substances as mes
caline, psilosybin and LSD.
Cocaine's effect
It's harder to say what might
happen to cocaine use if this
popular treat were legalized.
Probablya lot more Andean hill
sides would be planted in coca
bushes, and a lot more people
would energize, euphoricize
and eulogize on account of this
drug.
With drugs legal and there-

fore more acceptable, it would
at least he possible to open drug
emporiums offering extensive
selections of marijuana, hash
ish, psycheledics and
euphoriants from all over the
world.
A tasting room, a restaurant
and juice bar serving fruit
drinks, pancakes, omelettes,
soups and other delicacies all
laced with cannabis and can
nabis derivatives would provide
an enjoyable retreat for world
weary students. workers,
housewives, executives, hippies
and whatever other categories
of people are now current.
One could, of course, try out
the drug of one's choice in the
restaurant or music listening
room, then buy a quantity to
take home.
Everything considered, a
world where drugs were legal
would be a happier, saner place
and the people in it just might be
somewhat happierthan they am
today.
