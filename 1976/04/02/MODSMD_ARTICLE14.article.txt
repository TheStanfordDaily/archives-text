Much as I hate to admit it, I always loved reading Daily columnist
Glenn Garvin's articles. He had a fine sense of humor (slightly
warped, but still fine) and that's something the Daily could use
more often. So what is he doing in Greenville, Miss.? Does he
like it there? And why doesn't the Daily get him to write u regular
column?-D.Z.
Fearing charges of partialty, we normally ref use to answer ques
tions regarding former or present Daily staffers. However, we
figured that anyone foolish enough to waste 13 cents mailing this
letter (from another state, yet) deserved an answer. So here it is —
straight from the horse's mouth, so to speak. Carvin smuggled this
reply out of the deep South:
"I'm hard at work here in Creenville, covering such crucial
stories as whether the river is rising faster or slower this year, who
won the annual basketball game between the firemen and the
police, and the little boys who thought they saw a deer in the
woods. I have rapidly become one of the most trusted reporters on
the Delta Democrat-Times, and last week even got to interview
some Hoy Scouts who visited foreign lands like Kansas.
"I'm also the film critic, and I'm eagerly awaiting the arrival of
Citizen Kane, which some folks think mayget hereby theend ofthe
year. Loyal fans of my old 'Pro Prognosis' column will be happy to
learn what I have continued in the same vein in Mississippi, and in
just six short months I have been banned from Creenville's only bar
and one of its two theaters.
"Aside from that,things are fine,and I am happily awaiting the
onset of old age; and Medicare benefits. 1 spend my spare time
watching the.soybeans grow and negotiating with a fierce colony of
cockroaches for daytime control of my kitchen. (We are making
progress; I have agreed to abandon my pathetic efforts at chemical
warfare, and they, in turn have promised not to rip off my leg as I
sleep.)
"I don't write a regular column for the Daily because the Daily
management,in a surprising show of good taste, has never invited
me to. However, those who miss my deathless prose can get an
overdose of it by writing to me at 743 Penn Lane, Greenville, MS
38701. Mail comes down from Tennessee by mule and it shouldn't
tak<! more than a couple of weeks to get to me."

Is it true that the official University motto is the German phrase
"Die Lull der h'reiheit weht," meaning "The wind of freedom
blows'":' Where does it come from and why is it Stanford's motto?-
h.k.
According to Maren Pedersen, at the University archives, the
quote is from a letter by Ulrich von Hutten, a vocal German who
protested the religious persecution of Martin Luther. David Starr
Jordan, Stanford's first president, mentioned it in his Founder's
Addn !ss, and the phrase was so popular with the faculty that they
adopted it to use on the faculty seal.
The first mention ofthe quote is in the March 1917 edition of the
St a nl ord Alumnus magazine. Ironically, only one year later, Jordan
responded to widespread anti-German sentiment by asserting,
"This is not the motto ofthe University as it has never been offi
cially adopted and does not appear on the University official seal."
During the WWI period, all Bookstore paraphernalia bearing the
seal with the quote disappeared.
The motto has never become part ofthe official University seal, a
Palo Alto tree. However, the President's seal is that same Palo Alto
tree, encircled by the quote.
COHHHC'riON: A quotation in the March 3 "Bug Me" concerning
the gun control issue 011 campus was incorrectly attributed to
Robert Rosen/.weig, vice president for University relations. The
statement was actually made by Legal Adviser to the President
James Siena.

Much as I hate to admit it, I always loved reading Daily columnist
Glenn Garvin's articles. He had a fine sense of humor (slightly
warped, but still fine) and that's something the Daily could use
more often. So what is he doing in Greenville, Miss.? Does he
like it there? And why doesn't the Daily get him to write u regular
column?-D.Z.
Fearing charges of partialty, we normally ref use to answer ques
tions regarding former or present Daily staffers. However, we
figured that anyone foolish enough to waste 13 cents mailing this
letter (from another state, yet) deserved an answer. So here it is —
straight from the horse's mouth, so to speak. Carvin smuggled this
reply out of the deep South:
"I'm hard at work here in Creenville, covering such crucial
stories as whether the river is rising faster or slower this year, who
won the annual basketball game between the firemen and the
police, and the little boys who thought they saw a deer in the
woods. I have rapidly become one of the most trusted reporters on
the Delta Democrat-Times, and last week even got to interview
some Hoy Scouts who visited foreign lands like Kansas.
"I'm also the film critic, and I'm eagerly awaiting the arrival of
Citizen Kane, which some folks think mayget hereby theend ofthe
year. Loyal fans of my old 'Pro Prognosis' column will be happy to
learn what I have continued in the same vein in Mississippi, and in
just six short months I have been banned from Creenville's only bar
and one of its two theaters.
"Aside from that,things are fine,and I am happily awaiting the
onset of old age; and Medicare benefits. 1 spend my spare time
watching the.soybeans grow and negotiating with a fierce colony of
cockroaches for daytime control of my kitchen. (We are making
progress; I have agreed to abandon my pathetic efforts at chemical
warfare, and they, in turn have promised not to rip off my leg as I
sleep.)
"I don't write a regular column for the Daily because the Daily
management,in a surprising show of good taste, has never invited
me to. However, those who miss my deathless prose can get an
overdose of it by writing to me at 743 Penn Lane, Greenville, MS
38701. Mail comes down from Tennessee by mule and it shouldn't
tak<! more than a couple of weeks to get to me."

Is it true that the official University motto is the German phrase
"Die Lull der h'reiheit weht," meaning "The wind of freedom
blows'":' Where does it come from and why is it Stanford's motto?-
h.k.
According to Maren Pedersen, at the University archives, the
quote is from a letter by Ulrich von Hutten, a vocal German who
protested the religious persecution of Martin Luther. David Starr
Jordan, Stanford's first president, mentioned it in his Founder's
Addn !ss, and the phrase was so popular with the faculty that they
adopted it to use on the faculty seal.
The first mention ofthe quote is in the March 1917 edition of the
St a nl ord Alumnus magazine. Ironically, only one year later, Jordan
responded to widespread anti-German sentiment by asserting,
"This is not the motto ofthe University as it has never been offi
cially adopted and does not appear on the University official seal."
During the WWI period, all Bookstore paraphernalia bearing the
seal with the quote disappeared.
The motto has never become part ofthe official University seal, a
Palo Alto tree. However, the President's seal is that same Palo Alto
tree, encircled by the quote.
COHHHC'riON: A quotation in the March 3 "Bug Me" concerning
the gun control issue 011 campus was incorrectly attributed to
Robert Rosen/.weig, vice president for University relations. The
statement was actually made by Legal Adviser to the President
James Siena.
