# Thais fear rightist coup

BANGKOK (PNS) — Thai
land. the last U.S. ally on the In
dochinese peninsula, is teeter
ing on the hrink of an uncertain
and possibly explosive future.
With U.S.-Thai relations serv
ing as the local point lor confron
tations between left and right,
some observers here fear a milit
ary coup before or soon after
general elections Sunday.
Prime Minister Kukrit Pramoj
announced the end of all U.S.
military operations in Thailand
March 20, although final with
drawal of U.S. troops — except
for 270 advisers — was post
poned to July 20.
A March 20 deadline had been
set last summer after Thai-based
U.S. planes bombed Cambodia
in the Muyuguez incident.
Rightist coup?
Mounting violence here, in
cluding 20 assassinations in the
last year and four new deaths
when a bomb was thrown at a
student march, has fueled specu
lation that right-wing military
factions might now step in.
Anger over continued leftist agi
tation and Kukrit's decision to
remove U.S. bases runs deep in
the Thai military.
(A military government ruled
Thailand until October 107,'i
when mass demonstrations
brought it down.)
Rumors of a pending takeover
have been fanned by two milit
ary alerts in the last six weeks,
one reportedly to forestall a coup
by disaffected officers.
Capital is tense
Bangkok is now tense and un
certain. Even candidates for the
April 4 elections art; hardly visi
ble, apparently fearing for their
personal safety. Boonsanong
Punyodyana, the leader of the
small Socialist Party, was gun
ned down in front of a Bangkok
hotel several weeks ago.
One newspaper recently noted
that the atmosphere of turmoil,

bombings, alleged killings by
rightists and military allegations
of communist infiltration re
sembles that in tht! Philippines
in 15)72, just before martial law
was declared there.
While the explosive issue of
the U.S. presence in Thailand
remains in the spotlight, the
Thai government also faces labor
unrest and rural insurgents.
After two years of strikes, a
general strike in January by
Bangkok's labor unions
triggered Kukrit's decision to
dissolve the National Assembly
and call for new elections.
Moslems protest
In the south, a separatist Mos
lem movement has clashed with
Buddhists and Thai government
security forces. In January sev
eral thousand Moslems de
monstrated against security
forces whom they accused of
throwing a grenade into a Mos
lem crowd, killing 13.
And in the northeast, the Thai
army is fighting a jungle war
against an estimated 1 (),()()()
communist insurgents.
With such tension on the
domestic scene, military leaders
are wary of Thailand's com
munist neighbors. II the coming
elections strengthen the milit
ary, they could invite the U.S. to
retain its Thai bases — a possi
bility which has sparked student
demands that the bases be dis
mantled immediately.
Military murmurs
But if the left makes gains, the
military may decide parliamen
tary government must go. Sup
reme Commander Admiral San
gard Chalawyoo told a recent
Supreme Command Headquar
ters party that the military "will
play the role if the leftists start
moving."
The largest, Navapol. claims
two million members and is di
rected by a group of senior army

officers.
"It is the responsibility of
Navapol to prevent a communist
takeover in Thailand," says one
leader. "But how we're going to
do that remains a secret, which
the world will know soon
enough."
A smaller paramilitary group
of about 25,000 — many of them
former Thai mercenaries in Laos
is led by the chief of one divi
sion of the Thai International
Security Operations Command
(ISC)C), which commands
counter-insurgency effo r t s
against communist guerrillas.
"We believe in our king and
our religion and are proud of our
nation," he says. "If any group
creates trouble or unrest in the
country, we will get rid of it."
And he adds, "We make our
own plastic explosives."
K»;d Gaurs
This group, the Red Gaurs
(named after a species of fierce
water buffalo), is believed to be
behind many of the recent assas
sinations. In February, one
member was blown up when a
bomb he was allegedly planting
in a centrist party headquarters*
exploded.
Despite the formal ending of
U.S. military operations in Thai
land, U.S. miliary aid continues.
Opponents of the U.S. presence
predict the sophisticated U.S.
electronic co m muni cations
facilities will remain intact.
(The Ford Administration re
quested $132.7 million this year
in military aid to Thailand —
more than the war years of 1973
and 1974.)
These outposts, including a
new $20 million radar station
atop Thailand's highest moun
tain, are linked with overhead
reconnaissance satellites to
monitor troop movements in
Vietnam, radio communications
in China and Indochina, and
Chinese atomic and missile
tests. Together with the growing
. U.S. Navy base on Diego Garcia,
they are part of a worldwide U.S.
communications system.
The communications bases of
ficially ceased operations March
20. No government observers or
reporters have been allowed to
visit the installations, and the
Thais have no plans to monitor
the withdrawal. Kukrit has
stated that efforts to supervise
the withdrawal would damage
U.S.-Thai relations.
