# Hilton claims Soviet conspiracy
## 
### Philip Feder 
A leading specialist in United
States-Soviet relations said last night
that there exists "an international
Communist conspiracy aimed al
weakening the United States."
Romanic Languages Prof. Ronald
Hilton, executive director of the
California Institute of International
Studies, told a crowd of about 60
people that "Moscow says they are
fated to rule the world. There is no
thing to stop Brezhnev and nothing to
stop Castro. 1 want to know more about
their intrigues."
Speaking in a panel discussion as
part of the Dickinson Symposia on
"U.S.-Soviet relations in a World
Perspective," Hilton said, "Not many
of the younger generation knows how
the Communists took over Czechos
lovakia and then Cuba. It was the same
pattern in Angola. I don't trust the
Communists."
Several distinguished Soviet watch
ers joined Hilton on the introductory
panel of a quarter-long sequence of
weekly discussions.
Mutual interests
Stanford Linear Accelerator Director
Wolfgang Panofsky, an expert on arms
control and disarmament, said both
countries have mutual interests in
securing an end to the arms buildup.
Panofsky said the United States and
the Soviet Union have 30,000 atomic
warheads between them— and each
warhead is more powerful than the in
dividual bombs dropped on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
"Those warheads amount to the
power of 20 tons of TNT per person" in
the two countries, Panofsky said.
"Haggling about who is ahead and
who is behind, or what is the correct
index of strength has given these
numbers (of warheads)an importance
politically." but they aren't practically
important, he said, when the huge
power of the bombs is accounted for.

To Panofsky and other panel mem
bers, the paradox of arms control con
cerned the moves of both countries to
enter the Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks (SALT) in a position of strength.
This results, Panofsky contended, in
an escalation of arms build-up while
each side is trying to limit that build
up.
However, Roman Kolkowicz, a pro
fessor at UCLA, was optimistic that the
SALT talks would result in "peace or
something very close to it."
But, Kolkowicz said, the talks may
be threatened by the conflicting "pres
sures of deterrence, detente and dis
armament" which make the relation
ship between the two countries "un
stable."
Another speaker, Milorad
Drachkovitch. a senior fellow at the

Hoover Institution, traced the de
velopment of Soviet foreign policy di
rectly from the behavior of Lenin in
1922.
Dual policy
Lenin, then leader of the fledgling
Bolshevik government in Russia, di
rected the Soviet delegation to a world
conference in Genoa to argue a dual
policy of assertiveness and concilia
tion with the capitalist West.
"That duality," Drachkovitch said,
"emerges today with the Soviet policy
of detente and with their activities in
Angola. It is derived from Lenin's
moves in 1922."
The final speaker, Gale Lapidus, a
former fellow at the Hoover Institution
and now teaching at Berkeley, agreed
with Drachkovitch that a duality exists
in Soviet policy.

However, Lapidus contended that
there are degrees of assertive and con
ciliatory behavior on the part of the
Soviets.
"Discussions of detente are con
fused because we see the Soviets on
two poles," Lapidus said. "Soviet pol
icy is not an either-or proposition, just
as LI.S.-Soviet relations are not a
zero-sum game. There is room for
mutual agreement."
Several other leading Soviet
specialists are expected to attend fu
ture discussions this quarter. They in
clude: former U.S. Treasury Secretary
George Shultz, Business School Prof.
Henry Rovven, Assoc. Hoover Institu
tion Director Richard Staar and Dixie
Lee Ray, former chairwoman of the
Atomic Energy Commission.
