# New war sweeps across Western Sahara
## 
### 
From the Pacific News StTMo
Another African giMffrilla war
— threatening like Angola to in
volve the U.S. and the Soviet
Union as backers of the rival
forces — is raging in the
phosphate-rich Western Sahara.
Only months ago this 103,000
square miles of desert belonged
to Spain. Today it is under milit
ary occupation by its neighbors
Morocco and Mauritania. And
the 70,000 primarily nomadic
inhabitants — led by an eight
year-old independence move
ment called the Polisario Front
— are waging a bloody hit-and
run campaign against their new
foreign rulers.
Half of them have fled to re
fugee camps organized by the
front, which charges the Moroc
cans are using napalm against
civilians and have slit the throats
more than 100 women.
Pressure tactics
The military occupation itself
followed months of pressure tac
tics by Morocco on Spain,
climaxed by a widely publicized
invasion of Sahara last
November by 350,000 Moroccan
peasants.
Mauritania, which had earlier
provided a guerrilla base for the

Polisario Front, joined forces
with Morocco to gain control of
the southernmost third of West
ern Sahara and its phosphate
deposits.
Behind the burgeoning con
flict lies the threat of a full-scale
war between Morocco
(Mauritania has little armed
strength) and the front's major
supplier, Algeria.
Previous tights
Long-time rivals, the two
neighbors fought a border war in
1963 and have already clashed at
least once in the Sahara. In late
January. Moroccan troops at
tacked an Algerian force escort
ing a Red Cross supply convoy
heading for the front's refugee
camps.
Again like Angola, theconflict
also threatens to bring the U.S.
and the Soviet Union face-to
face on the African continent.
Morocco is supplied by and
closely tied to Washington, host
ing two American naval bases.
On Feb. 21, the U.S. announced
the sale of 24 new F-5E jet fight
ers to Morocco. Algeria is
supplied by the Soviet Union
and is a leader of the radical
third world bloc which has
clashed frequently with U.S. in-

terests in the United Nations.
The Polisario Front — little
noted in the Western press —
began in 1968 armed with little
more than a mimeograph
machine. It moved from prop
aganda to guerrilla war five
years later.
From then on. Polisario fight
ers — armed with ancient mus
kets — carried on a running bat
tle with troops Spain sent to
guard the colony's rich phos
phate mines.
Blue-robed, turbaned guerril
las would charge up to a remote
Spanish fortress on camelback.
capture the surprised soldiers
and their store of arms and vehi
cles and send a captive back to
Spanish headquarters with a
demand for the territory's free
dom.
Moroccan land?
But Morocco's King Hassan II
had different ideas. The Moroc
cans have long felt Western Sah
ara belongs to their kingdom —
as a former part of the royal
realm stolen by the Spanish.
By annexing the Sahara, Has
san could also add to Morocco's
phosphate production and
eliminate its neighbor as a com
petitor. Phosphates are Moroc
co's most important export.
Annexation also has helped
Hassan handle his domestic
•problems, channeling national
concern into anti-Spanish col
onialism and Moroccan
nationalism.
Hassan, an authoritarian
monarch, has narrowly escaped
several attempts to overthrow
him and is said to rely increas
ingly on a special internal sec
urity force to battle internal sub
version. The Saharan issue has
caused him to renege once again
on his promise to re-establish the
parliament he dissolved four
years ago.
November march
Faced with Spain's decision to
hold a referendum in the Sahara,
Hassan launched the November
"March of the People." This set

the stage for Spain to cede the
territory to Morocco and
Mauritania. Spain, in return,
was given 35 percent of the luc
rative Fos-Bucraa phosphate de
posits.
What all three parties had
failed to gauge was the depth ot
Saharan independence senti
ment.
In early December, the local
assembly created by Spain to
administer the colony dissolved
itself, as a majority of its mem
bers joined the front. Mean
while. refugees began leaving
towns in the face of advancing
Moroccan and Mauritanian
troops.
II.N. investigation
Earlier, a three-member U.N.
fact-finding mission visiting the
Western Sahara had reported the
widespread desire for indepen
dence. manifested in frequent
and wild demonstrations oppos
ing Morocco. Spain and
Mauritania.
But despite this indigenous
support. I'olisario is gradually
being driven out of its strong
holds by the heavily armed
Moroccan forces.
Its victories to date have
primarily been in clashes with
the weaker Mauritanian troops.

So tar. Algeria has shown a de
sire to avoid being dragged into
all-out war. Though it lost as
many as 201) men in its first clash
with Morocco, it made an appa
rently political decision not to
call up reinforcements. On Feb.
10. it announced it was keeping
its troops out of Western Sahara.
But Algeria's moderate
socialist government clearly
feels threatened by King Has
san's right-wing and expan
sionist regime. It may also desire
.m outlet to the Atlantic through
a sympathetic government in the
Western Sahara.
Diplomatic warfare
Diplomatic sources in
Morocco indicate both countries
want to beat their opponent
through diplomacy rather than
open combat. And several Arab
nations have sent negotiating
envoys to try to avert an inter-
Arab war.
Morocco has already carved
its new land into two provinces.
In the capital. El Aiun. the new
rulers have moved into villas
evacuated by the Spanish .
The Polisario front, mean
while. though worried that a
lack of international attention
will leave it isolated, vows it will
fight a continuing guerrilla war.
