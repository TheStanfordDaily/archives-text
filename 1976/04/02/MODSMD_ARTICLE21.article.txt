# Nation moves to electronic banking

WASHINGTON (AP) — Parents may find
it more difficult to control spending by
their children. Home burglaries could in
crease while armed robberies decline. In
dividual and hi siness privacy could be
threatened.
Those are some of the problems likely to
arise as the nation moves toward a system
of electronic banking and payments, ac
cording to a study by the National Science
Foundation.
Electronic Funds Transfer, as it is com
ing to be known, already is being de
veloped. It will ht; computer operated and
involve such things as the automatic de
posits of a worker's paycheck directly in
his bank account by his employer.
Payments for purchases at supermarkets
or other retail stores could be ac

complished with a credit-card type docu
ment inserted in a computer terminal. This
would automatically and instanty transfer
money from the bank account of the purch
aser to that of the seller.
The study, done by Arthur I). Little, Inc.
of Gambridge, Mass., said the system is
being developed even though most Ameri
cans are satisfied paying bills with cash
and checks.
The study said that eventually 70 percent
of the current volume of check payments
will be handled by "electronic substi
tutes." The advantage for the banking sys
tem will be lower costs. The study esti
mates that each check transaction now
costs about 30 cents and a credit card trans
action costs about 50 cents. The study said
a "significant fraction of these costs could

be eliminated."
But as the nation moves toward this sys
tem, the study said the following kinds of
problems will arise and should be dealt
with in advance:
—Parents may find it more difficult to
keep watch over spending by children
once a child has gained access to the
system through a family credit card or a
like item.
—Since Americans would he carrying
less cash, armed holdups may become less
attractive, but home burglaries might in
crease.
—There will be the creation of large
quantities of information on financial
transactions of individuals and organiza
tions "in a way that may threaten indi
vidual and business privacy."
