## L'Auberge: magnifique 
### 
Reviews by Nancy Wilson
There are places to go when you're tired of
dorm food. And there are places to go when you
want to dine someplace a little special. Then
there's the place to go when you want to be
spoiled, when you want elegance and class and
when you want very fine cuisine. L'Auberge
French Restaurant on HI Camino says elegance
all around.
The interior is small to maintain a personal
setting. The white tablecloths, the breadsticks as
well as loaf bread, and tin; silver shell-shaped
butter disk with ice keeping the butter chilled are
touches few restaurants bother with. Then the
hand-written menu, which admittedly needs at
tention to be fully legible, presents choices of
French cuisine to suit every gourmet's desire.
To start off the meal one can choose an ap
petizer and/or salad. The appetizers include es
cargots. salmon, lobsters, shrimp and others.
Among the salads are Caesar, fresh mushroom
and spinach with bacon. The latter was our
choice, which the waiter cooked at a small stove
just a few feet away from our table. The bacon is
still crisp and hot in the pan when the spinach
and dressing are added. When your plates are
served thespi nach is stil I crisp, but hot. A tasteful
flavor combination.
Entrees choice
The choice of entrees is extensive, with dishes
ranging from steak Diane, to several varieties of
chicken, fish, and filet of beef. We chose the Veal
Cordon Bleu and Le Tournados de Boeuf. The
Cordon Bleu was a very well-blended combina
tion of veal, ham and cheese — a real palate
pleaser. A serving of.spinach souffle and sliced
potatoes accompanied the Cordon Bleu.

Le Tournados de Boeuf gets its name from the
manner of cooking used. A healthy portion of
beef is cooked over a hot flame, just long enough
for a "turn of the back." The meat is then placed
on a round of bread and topped with a Bernaise
sauce. The beef is tender and most flavorful. A
tomato stuffed with spinach and topped with
cheese and potato sticks shared the plate with
the Tonrnados.
To go with dinner or before. L'Auberge offers a
full bar and an extensive choice of foreign and
domestic wines. Bottles run from $1.50 for a half
bottle to as high as $125 for a full bottle of aged
French wine.
Desserts
After dinner, one can choose a dessert of crepe
suzette, or a light souffle (for two or more). The
souffle is brought for your inspection before cut
ting, then served with a brandy flavored flan. The
flavor is smooth and not too rich. Excellent with
some coffee, or accompanied by brandy or
another after-dinner liquer.
The excellence of the cuisine is only part of the
restaurant. The carnation on each table, the
candlelight, the individual preparation of the
dishes for your entertainment, the warming of
the brandy snifter over a flame right at your table
— this is the mystique of L'Auberge. The price,
including two entrees, salad for two,dessert and
tip will run upwards of $30; wine and drinks, of
course, can considerably raise that estimate. And
unless you plan to go on a week night, try to make
reservations for early in the evening, as waiting
area is minimal. But, if you have out of town
guests who want to be extravagant, or you can
afford to enjoy a splurge, L'Auberge will eleg
antly fill your evening.

hand-written menu, which admittedly needs at
tention to be fully legible, presents choices of
French cuisine to suit every gourmet's desire.
To start off the meal one can choose an ap
petizer and/or salad. The appetizers include es
cargots. salmon, lobsters, shrimp and others.
Among the salads are Caesar, fresh mushroom
and spinach with bacon. The latter was our
choice, which the waiter cooked at a small stove
just a few feet away from our table. The bacon is
still crisp and hot in the pan when the spinach
and dressing are added. When your plates are
served thespi nach is stil I crisp, but hot. A tasteful
flavor combination.
Entrees choice
The choice of entrees is extensive, with dishes
ranging from steak Diane, to several varieties of
chicken, fish, and filet of beef. We chose the Veal
Cordon Bleu and Le Tournados de Boeuf. The
Cordon Bleu was a very well-blended combina
tion of veal, ham and cheese — a real palate
pleaser. A serving of.spinach souffle and sliced
potatoes accompanied the Cordon Bleu.

Le Tournados de Boeuf gets its name from the
manner of cooking used. A healthy portion of
beef is cooked over a hot flame, just long enough
for a "turn of the back." The meat is then placed
on a round of bread and topped with a Bernaise
sauce. The beef is tender and most flavorful. A
tomato stuffed with spinach and topped with
cheese and potato sticks shared the plate with
the Tonrnados.
To go with dinner or before. L'Auberge offers a
full bar and an extensive choice of foreign and
domestic wines. Bottles run from $1.50 for a half
bottle to as high as $125 for a full bottle of aged
French wine.
Desserts
After dinner, one can choose a dessert of crepe
suzette, or a light souffle (for two or more). The
souffle is brought for your inspection before cut
ting, then served with a brandy flavored flan. The
flavor is smooth and not too rich. Excellent with
some coffee, or accompanied by brandy or
another after-dinner liquer.
The excellence of the cuisine is only part of the
restaurant. The carnation on each table, the
candlelight, the individual preparation of the
dishes for your entertainment, the warming of
the brandy snifter over a flame right at your table
— this is the mystique of L'Auberge. The price,
including two entrees, salad for two,dessert and
tip will run upwards of $30; wine and drinks, of
course, can considerably raise that estimate. And
unless you plan to go on a week night, try to make
reservations for early in the evening, as waiting
area is minimal. But, if you have out of town
guests who want to be extravagant, or you can
afford to enjoy a splurge, L'Auberge will eleg
antly fill your evening.

There are places to go when you're tired of
dorm food. And there are places to go when you
want to dine someplace a little special. Then
there's the place to go when you want to be
spoiled, when you want elegance and class and
when you want very fine cuisine. L'Auberge
French Restaurant on HI Camino says elegance
all around.
The interior is small to maintain a personal
setting. The white tablecloths, the breadsticks as
well as loaf bread, and tin; silver shell-shaped
butter disk with ice keeping the butter chilled are
touches few restaurants bother with. Then the
