# 'It does a fine job'
## 
### 
The aim is to allow one to choose a fine wine and enjoy it fully,
with a meal meant primarily to be eaten between tastes of your
wine.
If you know little about vvi nes, or want to talk with someone who
knows as much as you do, ask to speak with theowner. He can tell
you about each wine, recommend one to sample and clue you in on
the truth about the popular California wines we blindly consume.
The wine selection offers a great way to enjoy fine wines at a
reasonable cost. But don't expect much more from Cafe Meursault;
it has a specific purpose, and to that end it does a fine job.
