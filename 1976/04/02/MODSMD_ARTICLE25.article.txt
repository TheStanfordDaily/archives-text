# El Pescador needs time to grow up
## 
### 
A new kid on the block, El Pescador, just
opened and still needs time to get all its
kinks worked out. Essentially a seafood re
staurant with continental style cooking, its
decor attempts to recreate a seaside setting
with hurricane lanterns and knotted ropes
hanging between dock pilings. The bar re
sembles a rustic New England barn, with
iron work of an old Midwest variety. So,
though somewhat disorganized, the trend
is toward the seascape.
The cuisine is of varied quality. Erom red
snapper, halibut, tuna, lobster, abaloneand
prawns, we chose the fresh mountain trout
stuffed with shrimp and crab and the frog
legs. The trout comes with head and tail
attached and is definitely good fare. The

tender meat separates easily from the
bones, and the stuffing makes a tasty com
bination of salt and fresh water flavors.
The frog legs are cooked with a tomato
sauce, served with diced tomatoes and
mushroomsâ€”for the inexperienced, a
flavorful way of trying frog legs.
Also available are steaks, roast beef, veal
and chicken. Recommended are the fish
dishes cooked in simple butter sauces. The
non-seafood entrees tend to be less interest
ing and the fancy sauces a bit overwhelm
ing. All are priced in the $6 to $8 range.
Before dinner El Pescador hosts several
appetizers, each for $2.50. We tried the av
ocado dip with clams and the Escargots de
Bourguignon. The clams have an in

teresting tang to them and were good. And
the escargots are tasty, though the appear
ance takes some getting used to. There is
also a choice of soups or a cold buffet.
Aside from serving a full lunch and din
ner menu, El Pescador offers the "Moon
light Pescador," a sort of midnight snack
served late at night in the bar or dining
area.
The timing between courses was very
slow and seemingly disorganized. With a
7:30 reservation, we weren't finished until
almost 10:30. The prices are not cheap, and
only with a vast improvement in service, a.s
well as consistently better food quality,will
El Pescador be worth its salt.
