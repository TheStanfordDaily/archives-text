## Three-game CIBA series SC hosts Card nine 
### Chris Baker 
The University of Southern California made a
shambles of tin; l'acific-8 baseball race for the
past six seasons. As with the UCLA Bruins in
basketball, you never had to ask whether the
Trojans would take the league crown, the real
question was il Troy would ransack the College
World Series.
Hut the major league baseball draft made a
shambles ol SC coach Rod Dedeaux' Trojans. De
deaux, now in his .'lsth season at the I JSC helm,
saw six underclassmen — all key men off a squad
which won 42 games, while losing only 14 and
tying one — give up their remaining years of
eligibility to sign with pro clubs.
All-American first baseman Steve Kemp (hit
with 1 home runs and (>7 KM Is), was the first
player selected in the regular phase of the draft.
I'itcher I'ete Redlern (0-:{, 1.24 ERA, 120 strike
outs in 108-2/.'l innings) and catcher Dennis
Littlejohn |.27. r ). l() homers) went one-two in the
secondary phase of the draft.
With that kind of talent drain, you might ex
pect to set; the Trojans at the bottom of the new
five-team California Intercollegiate Baseball As
sociation (CIBA) standings.
Same old storv
But it's the same old story. IJSC, with a 4-2
league mark (14-1 .'i overall), is on top of the
CIBA standings with a one-game lead over I JCI,A
and California. And Stanford (21-13) is coming
into this weekend's three-game series with the
Trojans, in I,os Angeles, a game and a half behind
the league-leading Trojans.
The first contest is set for tonight at 7, with
Saturday's double-header getting underway at 1
p.m. and again at 7 under the lights.
"As far as we can see." said Stanford coach
Kay Young, "IJSC has a young hasebal I tea m with
new players, very similar to on r club. It won't be
a pushover by any means."

Leading Deadeaux' Trojans are first baseman
Tim Toleman. hitting .360 and outfielder/
designated hitter Chris Smith, with a .3(if> aver
age. The Trojans' top hurler is sophomore right
hander Ernie Mauritson. a junior college trans
fer, with a 1.39 KRA.
"IJSC doesn't have the power they used to. and
their pitching's very young," said Young. "That
doesn't mean they're not a good ball club."
Riverside relaxation
TheCiants havetheir June swoon and Stanford
has its Riverside relaxation — the Cards usually
go into a slump right after the Riverside tourna
ment.
But if Stanford, coming off a 111-0 loss to
second-ranked Arizona State in the champion
ship game of last week's Riverside tournament. is
in a slump, then you might as well go out to Lake
Lagunita for the Aquafollies this weekend.
The Cards tuned up for the IJSC series with an
H-2 win over Cal State-Hayward Tuesday after
noon at Sunken Diamond. After the win over
Hayward Young said, "Weexecuted well. That's
the kind of game I feel we have to play.
"Our hitting did pick up last week," said
Young of the Cards, now averaging .283 as a
team. "Pitchford (Tom) has been hitting well and
both Walters (Bruce) and Cuardino (Tom) came
on strong for us."
Young expects to use junior lefthander John
Yandle (4-3, 2.58 ERA), freshman righthander
Bruce I'iala (4-1, 2.40 ERA), freshman lefty Rob
Irwin (2-1, 2.20 ERA) or freshman righthander
Bruce Harrison (1 -1, 6.26 ERA) onthe moundthis
weekend.
But outfielder Mi ke Cordiroli, the Cards' lead
ing hitter, with a ~'165 average, is doubtful for the
three-game series. Cordiroli is suffering from a
pulled hamstring.
Big Red notes: This weekend's series wil I not be
broadcast over the KZSIJ "Sports Network."

steal of second base. Davis, an All-American candidate and a .300
hitter for three straight seasons, leads the Cards in this weekend's
three-game series against IJSC.
The University of Southern California made a
shambles of tin; l'acific-8 baseball race for the
past six seasons. As with the UCLA Bruins in
basketball, you never had to ask whether the
Trojans would take the league crown, the real
question was il Troy would ransack the College
World Series.
Hut the major league baseball draft made a
shambles ol SC coach Rod Dedeaux' Trojans. De
deaux, now in his .'lsth season at the I JSC helm,
saw six underclassmen — all key men off a squad
which won 42 games, while losing only 14 and
tying one — give up their remaining years of
eligibility to sign with pro clubs.
All-American first baseman Steve Kemp (hit
with 1 home runs and (>7 KM Is), was the first
player selected in the regular phase of the draft.
I'itcher I'ete Redlern (0-:{, 1.24 ERA, 120 strike
outs in 108-2/.'l innings) and catcher Dennis
Littlejohn |.27. r ). l() homers) went one-two in the
secondary phase of the draft.
With that kind of talent drain, you might ex
pect to set; the Trojans at the bottom of the new
five-team California Intercollegiate Baseball As
sociation (CIBA) standings.
Same old storv
But it's the same old story. IJSC, with a 4-2
league mark (14-1 .'i overall), is on top of the
CIBA standings with a one-game lead over I JCI,A
and California. And Stanford (21-13) is coming
into this weekend's three-game series with the
Trojans, in I,os Angeles, a game and a half behind
the league-leading Trojans.
The first contest is set for tonight at 7, with
Saturday's double-header getting underway at 1
p.m. and again at 7 under the lights.
"As far as we can see." said Stanford coach
Kay Young, "IJSC has a young hasebal I tea m with
new players, very similar to on r club. It won't be
a pushover by any means."

Leading Deadeaux' Trojans are first baseman
Tim Toleman. hitting .360 and outfielder/
designated hitter Chris Smith, with a .3(if> aver
age. The Trojans' top hurler is sophomore right
hander Ernie Mauritson. a junior college trans
fer, with a 1.39 KRA.
"IJSC doesn't have the power they used to. and
their pitching's very young," said Young. "That
doesn't mean they're not a good ball club."
Riverside relaxation
TheCiants havetheir June swoon and Stanford
has its Riverside relaxation — the Cards usually
go into a slump right after the Riverside tourna
ment.
But if Stanford, coming off a 111-0 loss to
second-ranked Arizona State in the champion
ship game of last week's Riverside tournament. is
in a slump, then you might as well go out to Lake
Lagunita for the Aquafollies this weekend.
The Cards tuned up for the IJSC series with an
H-2 win over Cal State-Hayward Tuesday after
noon at Sunken Diamond. After the win over
Hayward Young said, "Weexecuted well. That's
the kind of game I feel we have to play.
"Our hitting did pick up last week," said
Young of the Cards, now averaging .283 as a
team. "Pitchford (Tom) has been hitting well and
both Walters (Bruce) and Cuardino (Tom) came
on strong for us."
Young expects to use junior lefthander John
Yandle (4-3, 2.58 ERA), freshman righthander
Bruce I'iala (4-1, 2.40 ERA), freshman lefty Rob
Irwin (2-1, 2.20 ERA) or freshman righthander
Bruce Harrison (1 -1, 6.26 ERA) onthe moundthis
weekend.
But outfielder Mi ke Cordiroli, the Cards' lead
ing hitter, with a ~'165 average, is doubtful for the
three-game series. Cordiroli is suffering from a
pulled hamstring.
