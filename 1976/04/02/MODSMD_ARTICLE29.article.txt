LOS ANGELESâ€”Led by im
pressive performances toward

terred by losing efforts at the top.

little over an hour. 7-5. 0-4, and

Dul're, 0-:i, 7-5, to Manson and
Ghris Lewis.
SC loses Walts
IJSG's top-ranked player,
Butch Walts, did not play after
being declared academically in
eligible. The problem stems
from one grade, and the All -
American is trying tostaighten it
out with his professor. If he suc
ceeds, he could play against
lIGLA tomorrow.
Maze had his hands full with
Manson, the Trojans'

No. 2 player and currently
NGAA doubles champion with
Walts.
The Stanford sophomore
needed to play up to his poten
tial to beat Manson. but he
didn't. Maze's game relies on his
serve and confidence. He was
missing the first against Man
son, and therefore lost the sec
ond.
Maze got in a low percentage
of his tirst serves and the prob
lem spread to his other strokes.
Whereas Manson made 10 un
forced errors on his backhand
<ind seven on volleys. Maze
made 22 and 10 respectively.
No confidence
"When I'm not serving well,"
Maze said, "my confidence
goes down the drain basically."
Stanford won four of the six
singles matches behind Wright.
Dul're, Mark Mitchell and John
Hast and needed to win just one
of the three doubles matches to
assure victory
It almost didn't come.
