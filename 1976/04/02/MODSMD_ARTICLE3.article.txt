# No relief in sight'
## Energy costs soar 
### Pan Demetrakakes 
Energy consumption this winter
was up from last year's levels, accord
ing to Director of Plant Services Jason
Mavis.
Mavis announced that the Univer
sity consumed 38,052,000 kilowatt
hours (KWH) of electricity from Sept.
1975 to Feb. 1976. This is 229,000
KYVH more than was used in the same
period a year ago. This electricity cost
$701,300. up $150,800 from last year.
l!se of energy for heating and chil
ling water also went up this winter,
according to Mavis. The cost of this
energy was $811,700, up $404,200
from last year.
In a press release, Mavis was quoted
as saying there is "no relief in sight."
Need to conserve
"I'd put it more emphatically than
that," Utilities Manager Robert
Mcknight said. "One of our biggest
problems is convincing people of the
need to still conserve energy."
Mcknight said that Plant Services'
goal for next year is a 10 percent reduc
tion in energy consumption levels.
Two of thebiggest obstacles will bethe
energy needs of buildings due to open
and the inefficiency of the heating sys
tems in several existing buildings, he
said.
In this connection he specifically

mentioned the "expansive windows"
and skylight of the Stanford Center for
Research and Development in Teach
ing building and the air circulation
systems of tbe Graduate School of bus
iness (GSB) and the new law school.
Spokesmen for the business and law
schools confirmed Mcknight's as
sessment of their heating systems and
added some complaints of their own.
'Design problem'
"There is a design problem in
the building." said Paul Johnson, assis
tant dean for administration at the
GSB. "I just think the whole system
was poorly designed and that is the
cause of inefficiency rather than lack
of effort on our part."
Johnson said that often there is a
temperature difference of a dozen de
grees or more between the first floor
and the upper floors.
"There have been problems with our
system. It has never been properly ad
justed," said Assoc. Law School Dean
Joseph Leininger.
Leininger pointed out that the law
school was designed before the energy
crisis. Because many of its classrooms
have no windows, "we are wholly de
pendent on air conditioning."
As an example of poor energy de
sign. Leininger noted that although
second and third floor offices sur
rounding the Crown Library have
windows that can be opened but of
fices on the first floor or in the base
ment do not.
"If we shut off the air conditioning,
the people on the two bottom floors
would suffocate," he said.
Both Johnson and Leininger said
they are taking routine steps to con
serve energy. "We're always after
people to turn off lights and close
doors," Johnson said.
"The first thing is to get our system
working properly," Leininger said.
"The final story of the law school's use
of energy is not yet in."
Asked how the increased energy
costs will affect the budget, Vice Pro
vost for Budget and Planning
Raymond Bacchetti said. "It's an ex
pense that we have known about and
are planning for, and an expense that
we wish we could reduce."
He noted, "One of the difficulties
about energy consumption is that it's a
free good. You can't charge someone
for walking in and turning on a light."
