# Lofton leaps toward lofty goals
## Looks for NCAA long jump title, Rose Bowl appearance 
### Bruce Anderson 
The man raking the long
jump pit at the Stanford-
Hayward State track meet
looked at his sidekick in dis
belief. "That brother took off
like a jumping jack," he said
with obvious amazement
after w;itc:hing James Lofton
land a foot or two further
down the pit than his closest
rival.
The next time Lofton stood
iit the end of the runway
gathering his concentration,
the man with the rake warned
his friend, "I'SA now board
ing gate 12." I le made sure no
one around him missed Lof
ton's next take off.
Last year the sophomore
from Los Angeles placed sec
ond in the long jump against
the Russian junior team and
finished ninth in the NCAA
track and field champion
ships with a leap of 25-3V4.
Hut despite these impres
sive credentials, the former
California prep long jump
champion is attending Stan
ford on a football scholarship.
Recruiting battle
When Lofton signed his let
ter of intent to come to the
Farm in 15)74, he ended a
heated recruiting battle
which included such peren
nial track powerhouses as
UCLA, IJSC and Tennessee.
Reflecting now, the 6-foot-.'}
industrial engineering major
said he would probably have
done things differently.
"If I had it to do over. I
would go to every campus
and do a lot more traveling,"
said Lofton, who by signing a
football letter of intent in Feb
ruary, eliminated the possi
bility of visiting campuses
where Ik; was being recruited
for track and field.
He came to Stanford
primarily because the football
coaches said he could run
Jt irk in the spring. And while

the grid coaches wonlfl be
happy to have Lofton at
spring football practice, they
know that many of I he talents
he brings to the gridiron are
due to his work in track.
Doesn't lose much
"He doesn't lose that
much," said football
coach Pete Kettela of Lofton's
absence at spring practice.
"We send our kids over to
work a week or two each
spring with the track team on
speed, starts, stances and ba
lance because they are the ex
perts on these things."
Kettela said that Lofton's
track work has made these
things second nature to him.
Hut Lofton, who won Iron
Man honors and the Jack
Weierhauser Award (for the
outstanding freshman on the
track team) last year, must
spend added time working on
his moves and catching the
ball.
Prep quarterback
Indeed, Lofton says,"I was
a quarterback in high school
and couldn't catch to save my
life." Hut Lofton has over
come this problem. Lofton
and Hill Kellar are the two
most likely to replace Hill
Singler in next fall's starting
football lineup.
"One tiling bad was last
season, when we were way
ahead the coaches wanted to
rack up tin; rushing, so the
third and fourth string backs
ran all day," Lofton recalled.
"When we were ahead of
Army we should have
bombed them. The second
and third string receivers
need to catch the ball. That's
our game here, and the re
ceivers only learn by doing
it."
'Big play receiver'
Kettela added, "James was
our big play receiver, we sent
him in on the? big play situa
tions." He compared Lofton

to Cardinal All-American
candidate Tony Mill, also a
liigli school quarterhack.
"James will blossom like
Tony did this season."
And when Kettela called
Lofton gifted, he wasn't
exaggerating. Besides his
long jumping prowess, Lof
ton is Stanford's top quarter
miler and triple jumper this
season.
11e also runs a leg for the
Cards in the 400-meter relay
and said that in his junior
year in high school he was
high jumping (>-4 before an
injury halted his brief fling at
the flop.
Lotion has set breaking the
Stanford records in the long

jump, 220 and 440 as Ins
goals.
Card track coach Payton
Jordan believes Lofton has a
good shot at hreaki ng t he long
jump and 440 marks in the
immediate future. "James'
speed is such that it carries
over better in the 440 than in
the 220."
But Jordan was reluctant at
the beginning of the season to
use Lofton in anything other
than the jumps. However,the
good-humored sophomore is
the type that likes to compete
in everything.
Physically matured
Now Jordan feels that Lof
ton has physical Iv matured
enough so that he can use him

on the track, as well <is pro
vide; Stanford's strength in
the jumps.
"The better he runs, the bet
ter lit! jumps," Jordan says,
explaining that gre;it long
jumpers must he gro;it sprin
ters as well.
This weekend Lofton will
anchor the Stanford mile
relay team, against IJSC in
I.os Angeles, which two
weeks ;igo came within
three-tenths of it second of
breaking a Hfj-year old Stan
ford record of U:10.5.
48.H leg
In that r.n e, Lofton turned
in it 4IUI leg which helped
earn him Northern California
