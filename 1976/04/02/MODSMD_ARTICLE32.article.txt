Track
Stanford will journey south
today to compete in tomorrow's
double meet in Los Angeles
where the Cards will meet USC
and California will vie with
UCLA.
While Stanford in its role as
David has no idea of slaying the
giant Goliath, the Card cinder
men have set as their goal to
maximize individual perfor
mances. The competition pre
sent in every event should draw
the best out of everyone.
Stanford coach Payton Jordan
describes the Trojans as "awe
some" and Southern Cal should
have no trouble winning its 40th
consecutive dual meet with the
Cards. But Jordan offers this
warning to the Trojans:
"They had better best their
previous marks in the relays or
we're going to beat them." The
Stanford mile relay team of Scott
VVingo, Alan Sheats, Matt Hog
sett and James Lofton should
come home with the Stanford re
cord which barely evaded them
two weeks ago at the Stanford
Relays.

partment this year. The pair has been nominated as Ail-
Americans. Coach Jack Christiansen will welcome over 80 foot
ball players to spring practice which gets underway Monday.
McColl is attending Stanford-in-Germany and will miss the
month-long sessions.
Track
Stanford will journey south
today to compete in tomorrow's
double meet in Los Angeles
where the Cards will meet USC
and California will vie with
UCLA.
While Stanford in its role as
David has no idea of slaying the
giant Goliath, the Card cinder
men have set as their goal to
maximize individual perfor
mances. The competition pre
sent in every event should draw
the best out of everyone.
Stanford coach Payton Jordan
describes the Trojans as "awe
some" and Southern Cal should
have no trouble winning its 40th
consecutive dual meet with the
Cards. But Jordan offers this
warning to the Trojans:
"They had better best their
previous marks in the relays or
we're going to beat them." The
Stanford mile relay team of Scott
VVingo, Alan Sheats, Matt Hog
sett and James Lofton should
come home with the Stanford re
cord which barely evaded them
two weeks ago at the Stanford
Relays.
