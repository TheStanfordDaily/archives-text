# Students organize athletic committee
## 
### David Georgette 
Like almost all things, athletics involve money.
And when there aren't enough dollars to provide
the sporting facilities and programs to keep
everyone happy, decisions have to be made as to
where the funds will go and who will receive
them.
The responsibility for deciding policy and
funding at Stanford rests with the Department of
Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation
(DAPER), and more specifically, its director, Joe
Ruetz.
Some members of the Stanford community feel
that a few of the recent decisions by Ruetz and
DAPER, have been made without sufficient com
munication with the students or the community.
Students heard?
George Pegelow. a member of Stanford's Social
Thought and Institutions Department, shares this
belief. "In the past, students felt their opinions
were not listened to," he said.
In an effort to permit student opinion to be
voiced, Pegelow and others have formed the Stu
dent Athletics Committee (SAC).
"Our primary goal is to open up channels of
communication and to get students involved in
decision-making processes," said Pegelow.
"Some of the decisions have been made in a vac
uum. SAC hopes to provide student input."
Such a committee is not without precedent. Ac
cording to Pegelow, UC-Berkeley has initiated
such a program. Representing the student body
are two student interns who haveaccesstoall files
of California's Athletic Department.
These students play an important part in the
decisions made by the department and the prog
ram has met with some success. "Dave Maggard
(Cal's athletic director) is in full support of it,"
said Pegelow.
SAC support
As for SAC, Pegelow said "there are already 15
people involved." Pegelow added that there is
"fairly wide support" throughout the community
for SAC, including "support from members of the
Buck Club."
"We'll set up task forces and let things follow
their course," he.said. "Hopefully there will be a
dialogue between the students and the depart-

merit.'
The task forces will comprise one "of the out
standing strengths of the SAC organization."
Pegelow said. "Rather than overloading one cent
ral body with many diversified issues, SAC will
instead help organize task forces of those students
and community members with strong interest in
each particular issue."
SAC plans to present its findings to DAPER to
allow foi feedback and discussion before a deci
sion is reached.
In this way. members of SAC hope such DAPER
decisions as those of last year, which threatened
the stability of wrestling, gymnastics and club
sports, can be avoided.
Different view
Ruetz takes a little different view of the situa
tion. "Everybody wants to be involved in the
decision-making process," Ruetz said. "One of
the problems can be too many committees."
Ruetz believes that CAPER (Committee on Ath
letics, Physical Education and Recreation), which
contains some student representatives appointed
by President Richard Lyman, can handle the job of
presenting student views adequately.
But Pegelow disagrees. "CAPER has too narrow
a base in representation."
Ruetz is not opposed to SAC. though he said, "1
really don't think it's necessary" because it "dup
licates" CAPER. He added "I'm not opposed to
communication. SAC could bring forward some
proposals to the attention of CAPER."
Ruetz went on to say, however, "I don't think
any organization can have the overview of the
director. II people don't agree, they can bring it to
the attention of the department or the president."
Guy Benjamin, a member of SAC, concedes this
point. "We realize only one person can make the
decisions, but we hope the administration is re
sponsive."
Benjamin believes that the ultimate success or
failure of SAC will depend on "student en
thusiasm and the openness of the administra
tion."
Pegelow believes that this "openness" will
work to the benefit of all. "We're not trying to stir
up trouble," he said. "We want everyone to work
together as a team."
