# Stanford sports flashback

### 
One of the greatest football
players in Stanford history,
and also one of the school's
finest all-around athletes
ever, was Ernie Nevers.
Not only was Nevers an
Ail-American fullback, but he
also was a member of the bas
ketball, baseball and track
teams during his stay on the
Farm in the mid-19205.
"Dig Dog," as he was affec
tionately called by his team
mates, was a basketball for
ward, a baseball pitcher and a
discus thrower.
Nevers was so tough that he
played with two broken ank
les in the 1925 Rose Bowl
game against Notre Dame and
its famous Four Horsemen.
His legs were said to have
been taped so tightly that he
didn't have any feeling from
his knees down.
In the game. Nevers carried
34 times to set a new Rose
Bowl record, and gained 114
yards.
In the days of single pla
toon football, Nevers made 75
percent of the tackles for the
Cards and even intercepted
an errant Irish pass. Notre
Dame prevailed, however,
27-10.
In the spring of 1925, Nev
ers was the starting pitcher in
all three games of the baseball
Big Series between Stanford
and California.
Nevers was shellacked in
the first contest, but came
back to register wins by 4-3
and 8-4 margins. Besides
being the winning pitcher in
both games, Nevers blasted a
home run in each of the vic
tories.
And that's today's Stanford
sports flashback.
