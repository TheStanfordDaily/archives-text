Usery works to end strike
ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, 111. — President Ford's
top labor troubleshooter worked yesterday to bring
a quick end to a coast-to-coast truckers' strike that
could paralyze the nation's commerce.
Auto industry officials feared plant shutdowns
and layoffs within a matter of days if a national
agreement were not worked out soon between the
Teamsters union and Trucking Employers Inc.,
bargaining agent for If), 000 trucking firms. Con
sumers could start feeling considerable difficulties
after about two weeks, federal officials said.
The U.S. Transportation Department said a
week-long strike could idle one million workers
and mean the loss of $300 million to the nation's
economy, which only recently has shown an up
turn.
In other labor news, at least 85 percent of the
truck freight industry in California was reported
shut down yesterday as striking Teamsters pic
keted terminals throughout the state.
President Ford was in close contact with Labor
Secretary W.J. Usery )r.. who has been trying since
Sunday to shepherd the continuing Teamsters talks
in a suburban Chicago hotel.
As talks recessed for a dinner break, aides to
Usery said the secretary had canceled tentative
plans to return to Washington last night and de
cided to remain at the bargaining site. Earlier.
Usery said he had talked to Ford by telephone be
fore negotiations resumed yesterday morning. The
talks stretched past the midnight strike deadline
Wednesday but failed to bring agreement.
Lebanon cease-fire reached
BEIRI IT. Lebanon — Moslems and Christians ag
reed yesterday to a 10-day cease-fire in Lebanon's
civil war, with gunmen from both sides to remain in
place throughout the country.
The truce, to begin at noon today — 2 a.m. PST —
was announced after intense international pres
sure. mainly from Syria and the Palestinian guerril
las, but with help from Jordan and the United
States.
If it actually takes place, the cease-fire will be the
20th in the war, which has claimed about 14,000
lives since it broke out last April 14. Another 125
died yesterday before the truce was announced.
All previous cease-fires broke down because
there was no basic agreement satisfying demands
by the Moslem majority for more power in the
Christian-dominated Lebanese political system.
The latest truce was offered by leftist Moslem
leader Kamal Junblatt to permit election of a new
president. A spokesman for the right-wing
Phalange party, the Christians' main fighting arm,
said it would observe the cease-fire.
However, there was no immediate word from
Christian President Suleiman Franjieh's office on
whether he would agree to resign.
The cease-fire was designed to give him a 10-dav
period to step down but was not contingent on his

immediate resignation.
The truce in Beirut would be enforced by local
garrison troops. They are commanded by Brig. Aziz
Ahdab, leader of a March 11 coup declared to force
Franjieh's resignation.
The peacekeeping force persumably also will in
clude elements of the Palestinian guerrilla's milit
ary police and troops from the regular Palestine
Liberation Army (PLA).
In the last 10 days. Moslem leftist gunmen have
scored key military victories that gave them a posi
tion of strength in any negotiations. But even
should the truce bring Franjieh's resignation, the
two sides remain separated by a chasm of political
differences.
Franjieh. 05. has stubbornly clung to office
throughout three weeks of intensive leftist pressure
during which his departure has become a Moslem
condition for any political solution.
There have been unofficial reports that he is pre
pared to step down if this can be done constitution
ally.
Agreement has become even more difficult as
Moslem forces neared apparent victory and
Junblatt escalated his demands to include abolish
ing the traditional allocation of government posts
according to religion.
S.F. settlement prospects dim
SAN FRANCISCO — Prospects for rapid settle
ment of San Francisco's city workers strike ap
peared remote yesterday when picketing escalated
and cable cars and buses failed to roll for the second
day.
Mayor George Moscone said labor leaders and
the Board of Supervisors were talking among them
selves but no formal negotiations had been called to
seek an end to the walkout — the third by city
employes in two years.
About 2000 carpenters, electricians and other
craft workers struck early Wednesday when the
supervisors refused to reconsider a salary cut.
Other unions honoring the picket lines shut down
all public transportation and curtailed recreation
and other services.
"If the board doesn't come to a sense of reason,
it's going to get worse." vowed John Crowley,
executive secretary of the San Francisco Labor
Council.
The strike spread to two major hospitals yester
day as picket signs went up but disruption was
reported as minimal.
Superior Court Judge Henry Rolph had ordered
the strikers back to work on Wednesday. Most
union leaders evaded deputies serving a court in
junction ordering them back to work.
Crowley said the strike was in full force as the
Service Employes International Union represent
ing 9000 hospital, custodial and clerical workers,
voted to honor picket lines.
About a half-dozen pickets were seen at city
owned San Francisco' General Hospital and Lagijna
Honda Hospital but administrators said both

facilities were functioning normally. However,
emergency plans were made in case the picket lines
intensify.
The mayor, staying around-the-clock at a City
Hall that has no hot water, said the city was operat
ing "nearly normally although there are some
minor inconveniences."
Demos face panel of mayors
NEW YORK — Sen. Henry Jackson and Rep. Mor
ris Udall called for a federal takeover of all welfare
costs yesterday while former Ceorgia Cov. Jinuny
Carter opposed such a move as the three leading
Democratic presidential candidates reviewed their
positions on urban issues before a panel of 10
mayors.
Responding to queries from the panel, the candi
dates also gave differing views on questions of de
fense versus domestic spending, how to handle
revenue-sharing and the redevelopment of poor
inner city areas
Meanwhile, Sen. Hubert Humphrey of Min
nesota. who has said he will not seek the Democra
tic nomination but would accept a draft, said in a
luncheon address to the mayors' meeting at the
Waldorf Astoria Hotel that the federal government
should assume the "primary responsibility" for
welfare. He did no) say what that would mean.
As Jackson, Udall and Carter pressed their cam
paigns for important primary tests next Tuesday in
New York and Wisconsin. Humphrey stood by his
intentions not to enter the primaries. But in a 25-
minute address, he attacked the urban policies of
President Ford and said "to govern America you
have to know how to govern a city." He is a former
mayor of Minneapolis.
On the Republican side yesterday, former
California Gov. Ronald Reagan remained in Los
Angeles after his Wednesday night television
speech in which he attacked President Ford's
foreign policy as leaving the nation dangerously
inferior in military strength.
March wholesale prices rise
WASHINGTON — Wholesale prices in March
increased for the first time in three months, rising
two-tenths of one percent, the Labor Department
reported yesterday.
The increase came as a rise in prices for industrial
goods and processed foods and feeds offset another
sharp drop in farm prices.
White House Press Secretary Ron Nessen said
President Ford's economic advisers feel the March
shift was so slight that "it adds up to a continuation
of t he stability in the wholesale price index that has
been going on for four or five months."

place throughout the country.
The truce, to begin at noon today — 2 a.m. PST —
was announced after intense international pres
sure. mainly from Syria and the Palestinian guerril
las, but with help from Jordan and the United
States.
If it actually takes place, the cease-fire will be the
20th in the war, which has claimed about 14,000
lives since it broke out last April 14. Another 125
died yesterday before the truce was announced.
All previous cease-fires broke down because
there was no basic agreement satisfying demands
by the Moslem majority for more power in the
Christian-dominated Lebanese political system.
The latest truce was offered by leftist Moslem
leader Kamal Junblatt to permit election of a new
president. A spokesman for the right-wing
Phalange party, the Christians' main fighting arm,
said it would observe the cease-fire.
However, there was no immediate word from
Christian President Suleiman Franjieh's office on
whether he would agree to resign.
The cease-fire was designed to give him a 10-dav
period to step down but was not contingent on his

immediate resignation.
The truce in Beirut would be enforced by local
garrison troops. They are commanded by Brig. Aziz
Ahdab, leader of a March 11 coup declared to force
Franjieh's resignation.
The peacekeeping force persumably also will in
clude elements of the Palestinian guerrilla's milit
ary police and troops from the regular Palestine
Liberation Army (PLA).
In the last 10 days. Moslem leftist gunmen have
scored key military victories that gave them a posi
tion of strength in any negotiations. But even
should the truce bring Franjieh's resignation, the
two sides remain separated by a chasm of political
differences.
Franjieh. 05. has stubbornly clung to office
throughout three weeks of intensive leftist pressure
during which his departure has become a Moslem
condition for any political solution.
There have been unofficial reports that he is pre
pared to step down if this can be done constitution
ally.
Agreement has become even more difficult as
Moslem forces neared apparent victory and
Junblatt escalated his demands to include abolish
ing the traditional allocation of government posts
according to religion.
S.F. settlement prospects dim
SAN FRANCISCO — Prospects for rapid settle
ment of San Francisco's city workers strike ap
peared remote yesterday when picketing escalated
and cable cars and buses failed to roll for the second
day.
Mayor George Moscone said labor leaders and
the Board of Supervisors were talking among them
selves but no formal negotiations had been called to
seek an end to the walkout — the third by city
employes in two years.
About 2000 carpenters, electricians and other
craft workers struck early Wednesday when the
supervisors refused to reconsider a salary cut.
Other unions honoring the picket lines shut down
all public transportation and curtailed recreation
and other services.
"If the board doesn't come to a sense of reason,
it's going to get worse." vowed John Crowley,
executive secretary of the San Francisco Labor
Council.
The strike spread to two major hospitals yester
day as picket signs went up but disruption was
reported as minimal.
Superior Court Judge Henry Rolph had ordered
the strikers back to work on Wednesday. Most
union leaders evaded deputies serving a court in
junction ordering them back to work.
Crowley said the strike was in full force as the
Service Employes International Union represent
ing 9000 hospital, custodial and clerical workers,
voted to honor picket lines.
About a half-dozen pickets were seen at city
owned San Francisco' General Hospital and Lagijna
Honda Hospital but administrators said both

facilities were functioning normally. However,
emergency plans were made in case the picket lines
intensify.
The mayor, staying around-the-clock at a City
Hall that has no hot water, said the city was operat
ing "nearly normally although there are some
minor inconveniences."
Demos face panel of mayors
NEW YORK — Sen. Henry Jackson and Rep. Mor
ris Udall called for a federal takeover of all welfare
costs yesterday while former Ceorgia Cov. Jinuny
Carter opposed such a move as the three leading
Democratic presidential candidates reviewed their
positions on urban issues before a panel of 10
mayors.
Responding to queries from the panel, the candi
dates also gave differing views on questions of de
fense versus domestic spending, how to handle
revenue-sharing and the redevelopment of poor
inner city areas
Meanwhile, Sen. Hubert Humphrey of Min
nesota. who has said he will not seek the Democra
tic nomination but would accept a draft, said in a
luncheon address to the mayors' meeting at the
Waldorf Astoria Hotel that the federal government
should assume the "primary responsibility" for
welfare. He did no) say what that would mean.
As Jackson, Udall and Carter pressed their cam
paigns for important primary tests next Tuesday in
New York and Wisconsin. Humphrey stood by his
intentions not to enter the primaries. But in a 25-
minute address, he attacked the urban policies of
President Ford and said "to govern America you
have to know how to govern a city." He is a former
mayor of Minneapolis.
On the Republican side yesterday, former
California Gov. Ronald Reagan remained in Los
Angeles after his Wednesday night television
speech in which he attacked President Ford's
foreign policy as leaving the nation dangerously
inferior in military strength.
March wholesale prices rise
WASHINGTON — Wholesale prices in March
increased for the first time in three months, rising
two-tenths of one percent, the Labor Department
reported yesterday.
The increase came as a rise in prices for industrial
goods and processed foods and feeds offset another
sharp drop in farm prices.
White House Press Secretary Ron Nessen said
President Ford's economic advisers feel the March
shift was so slight that "it adds up to a continuation
of t he stability in the wholesale price index that has
been going on for four or five months."

Usery works to end strike
ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, 111. — President Ford's
top labor troubleshooter worked yesterday to bring
a quick end to a coast-to-coast truckers' strike that
could paralyze the nation's commerce.
Auto industry officials feared plant shutdowns
and layoffs within a matter of days if a national
agreement were not worked out soon between the
Teamsters union and Trucking Employers Inc.,
bargaining agent for If), 000 trucking firms. Con
sumers could start feeling considerable difficulties
after about two weeks, federal officials said.
The U.S. Transportation Department said a
week-long strike could idle one million workers
and mean the loss of $300 million to the nation's
economy, which only recently has shown an up
turn.
In other labor news, at least 85 percent of the
truck freight industry in California was reported
shut down yesterday as striking Teamsters pic
keted terminals throughout the state.
President Ford was in close contact with Labor
Secretary W.J. Usery )r.. who has been trying since
Sunday to shepherd the continuing Teamsters talks
in a suburban Chicago hotel.
As talks recessed for a dinner break, aides to
Usery said the secretary had canceled tentative
plans to return to Washington last night and de

Usery said he had talked to Ford by telephone be
fore negotiations resumed yesterday morning. The
talks stretched past the midnight strike deadline

S.F. settlement prospects dim
SAN FRANCISCO — Prospects for rapid settle
ment of San Francisco's city workers strike ap
peared remote yesterday when picketing escalated
and cable cars and buses failed to roll for the second
day.
Mayor George Moscone said labor leaders and
the Board of Supervisors were talking among them
selves but no formal negotiations had been called to
seek an end to the walkout — the third by city
employes in two years.
About 2000 carpenters, electricians and other
craft workers struck early Wednesday when the
supervisors refused to reconsider a salary cut.
Other unions honoring the picket lines shut down
all public transportation and curtailed recreation
and other services.
"If the board doesn't come to a sense of reason,
it's going to get worse." vowed John Crowley,
executive secretary of the San Francisco Labor
Council.
The strike spread to two major hospitals yester
day as picket signs went up but disruption was
reported as minimal.
Superior Court Judge Henry Rolph had ordered
the strikers back to work on Wednesday. Most
union leaders evaded deputies serving a court in
junction ordering them back to work.
Crowley said the strike was in full force as the
Service Employes International Union represent
ing 9000 hospital, custodial and clerical workers,
voted to honor picket lines.
About a half-dozen pickets were seen at city
owned San Francisco' General Hospital and Lagijna
Honda Hospital but administrators said both

facilities were functioning normally. However,
emergency plans were made in case the picket lines
intensify.
The mayor, staying around-the-clock at a City
Hall that has no hot water, said the city was operat
ing "nearly normally although there are some
minor inconveniences."
Demos face panel of mayors
NEW YORK — Sen. Henry Jackson and Rep. Mor
ris Udall called for a federal takeover of all welfare
costs yesterday while former Ceorgia Cov. Jinuny
Carter opposed such a move as the three leading
Democratic presidential candidates reviewed their
positions on urban issues before a panel of 10
mayors.
Responding to queries from the panel, the candi
dates also gave differing views on questions of de
fense versus domestic spending, how to handle
revenue-sharing and the redevelopment of poor
inner city areas
Meanwhile, Sen. Hubert Humphrey of Min
nesota. who has said he will not seek the Democra
tic nomination but would accept a draft, said in a
luncheon address to the mayors' meeting at the
Waldorf Astoria Hotel that the federal government
should assume the "primary responsibility" for
welfare. He did no) say what that would mean.
As Jackson, Udall and Carter pressed their cam
paigns for important primary tests next Tuesday in
New York and Wisconsin. Humphrey stood by his
intentions not to enter the primaries. But in a 25-
minute address, he attacked the urban policies of
President Ford and said "to govern America you
have to know how to govern a city." He is a former
mayor of Minneapolis.
On the Republican side yesterday, former
California Gov. Ronald Reagan remained in Los
Angeles after his Wednesday night television
speech in which he attacked President Ford's
foreign policy as leaving the nation dangerously
inferior in military strength.
March wholesale prices rise
WASHINGTON — Wholesale prices in March
increased for the first time in three months, rising
two-tenths of one percent, the Labor Department
reported yesterday.
The increase came as a rise in prices for industrial
goods and processed foods and feeds offset another
sharp drop in farm prices.
White House Press Secretary Ron Nessen said
President Ford's economic advisers feel the March
shift was so slight that "it adds up to a continuation
of t he stability in the wholesale price index that has
been going on for four or five months."
Today's weather
Fair through today with a warming trend. Patchy
low clouds tonight. Partly cloudy tomorrow. Lows

Usery works to end strike
ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, 111. — President Ford's
top labor troubleshooter worked yesterday to bring
a quick end to a coast-to-coast truckers' strike that
could paralyze the nation's commerce.
Auto industry officials feared plant shutdowns
and layoffs within a matter of days if a national
agreement were not worked out soon between the
Teamsters union and Trucking Employers Inc.,
bargaining agent for If), 000 trucking firms. Con
sumers could start feeling considerable difficulties
after about two weeks, federal officials said.
The U.S. Transportation Department said a
week-long strike could idle one million workers
and mean the loss of $300 million to the nation's
economy, which only recently has shown an up
turn.
In other labor news, at least 85 percent of the
truck freight industry in California was reported
shut down yesterday as striking Teamsters pic
keted terminals throughout the state.
President Ford was in close contact with Labor
Secretary W.J. Usery )r.. who has been trying since
Sunday to shepherd the continuing Teamsters talks
in a suburban Chicago hotel.
As talks recessed for a dinner break, aides to
Usery said the secretary had canceled tentative
plans to return to Washington last night and de
cided to remain at the bargaining site. Earlier.
Usery said he had talked to Ford by telephone be
fore negotiations resumed yesterday morning. The
talks stretched past the midnight strike deadline
Wednesday but failed to bring agreement.
Lebanon cease-fire reached
BEIRI IT. Lebanon — Moslems and Christians ag
reed yesterday to a 10-day cease-fire in Lebanon's
civil war, with gunmen from both sides to remain in
place throughout the country.
The truce, to begin at noon today — 2 a.m. PST —
was announced after intense international pres
sure. mainly from Syria and the Palestinian guerril
las, but with help from Jordan and the United
States.
If it actually takes place, the cease-fire will be the
20th in the war, which has claimed about 14,000
lives since it broke out last April 14. Another 125
died yesterday before the truce was announced.
All previous cease-fires broke down because
there was no basic agreement satisfying demands
by the Moslem majority for more power in the
Christian-dominated Lebanese political system.
The latest truce was offered by leftist Moslem
leader Kamal Junblatt to permit election of a new
president. A spokesman for the right-wing
Phalange party, the Christians' main fighting arm,
said it would observe the cease-fire.
However, there was no immediate word from
Christian President Suleiman Franjieh's office on
whether he would agree to resign.
The cease-fire was designed to give him a 10-dav
period to step down but was not contingent on his

immediate resignation.
The truce in Beirut would be enforced by local
garrison troops. They are commanded by Brig. Aziz
Ahdab, leader of a March 11 coup declared to force
Franjieh's resignation.
The peacekeeping force persumably also will in
clude elements of the Palestinian guerrilla's milit
ary police and troops from the regular Palestine

March wholesale prices rise
WASHINGTON — Wholesale prices in March
increased for the first time in three months, rising
two-tenths of one percent, the Labor Department
reported yesterday.
The increase came as a rise in prices for industrial
goods and processed foods and feeds offset another
sharp drop in farm prices.
White House Press Secretary Ron Nessen said
President Ford's economic advisers feel the March
shift was so slight that "it adds up to a continuation
of t he stability in the wholesale price index that has
been going on for four or five months."

Usery works to end strike
ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, 111. — President Ford's
top labor troubleshooter worked yesterday to bring
a quick end to a coast-to-coast truckers' strike that
could paralyze the nation's commerce.
Auto industry officials feared plant shutdowns
and layoffs within a matter of days if a national
agreement were not worked out soon between the
Teamsters union and Trucking Employers Inc.,
bargaining agent for If), 000 trucking firms. Con
sumers could start feeling considerable difficulties
after about two weeks, federal officials said.
The U.S. Transportation Department said a
week-long strike could idle one million workers
and mean the loss of $300 million to the nation's
economy, which only recently has shown an up
turn.
In other labor news, at least 85 percent of the
truck freight industry in California was reported
shut down yesterday as striking Teamsters pic
keted terminals throughout the state.
President Ford was in close contact with Labor
Secretary W.J. Usery )r.. who has been trying since
Sunday to shepherd the continuing Teamsters talks
in a suburban Chicago hotel.
As talks recessed for a dinner break, aides to
Usery said the secretary had canceled tentative
plans to return to Washington last night and de
cided to remain at the bargaining site. Earlier.
Usery said he had talked to Ford by telephone be
fore negotiations resumed yesterday morning. The
talks stretched past the midnight strike deadline
Wednesday but failed to bring agreement.
Lebanon cease-fire reached
BEIRI IT. Lebanon — Moslems and Christians ag
reed yesterday to a 10-day cease-fire in Lebanon's
civil war, with gunmen from both sides to remain in
place throughout the country.
The truce, to begin at noon today — 2 a.m. PST —
was announced after intense international pres
sure. mainly from Syria and the Palestinian guerril
las, but with help from Jordan and the United
States.
If it actually takes place, the cease-fire will be the
20th in the war, which has claimed about 14,000
lives since it broke out last April 14. Another 125
died yesterday before the truce was announced.
All previous cease-fires broke down because
there was no basic agreement satisfying demands
by the Moslem majority for more power in the
Christian-dominated Lebanese political system.
The latest truce was offered by leftist Moslem
leader Kamal Junblatt to permit election of a new
president. A spokesman for the right-wing
Phalange party, the Christians' main fighting arm,
said it would observe the cease-fire.
However, there was no immediate word from
Christian President Suleiman Franjieh's office on
whether he would agree to resign.
The cease-fire was designed to give him a 10-dav
period to step down but was not contingent on his

immediate resignation.
The truce in Beirut would be enforced by local
garrison troops. They are commanded by Brig. Aziz
Ahdab, leader of a March 11 coup declared to force
Franjieh's resignation.
The peacekeeping force persumably also will in
clude elements of the Palestinian guerrilla's milit
ary police and troops from the regular Palestine
Liberation Army (PLA).
In the last 10 days. Moslem leftist gunmen have
scored key military victories that gave them a posi
tion of strength in any negotiations. But even
should the truce bring Franjieh's resignation, the
two sides remain separated by a chasm of political
differences.
Franjieh. 05. has stubbornly clung to office
throughout three weeks of intensive leftist pressure
during which his departure has become a Moslem
condition for any political solution.
There have been unofficial reports that he is pre
pared to step down if this can be done constitution
ally.
Agreement has become even more difficult as
Moslem forces neared apparent victory and
Junblatt escalated his demands to include abolish
ing the traditional allocation of government posts
according to religion.
S.F. settlement prospects dim
SAN FRANCISCO — Prospects for rapid settle
ment of San Francisco's city workers strike ap
peared remote yesterday when picketing escalated
and cable cars and buses failed to roll for the second
day.
Mayor George Moscone said labor leaders and
the Board of Supervisors were talking among them
selves but no formal negotiations had been called to
seek an end to the walkout — the third by city
employes in two years.
About 2000 carpenters, electricians and other
craft workers struck early Wednesday when the
supervisors refused to reconsider a salary cut.
Other unions honoring the picket lines shut down
all public transportation and curtailed recreation
and other services.
"If the board doesn't come to a sense of reason,
it's going to get worse." vowed John Crowley,
executive secretary of the San Francisco Labor
Council.
The strike spread to two major hospitals yester
day as picket signs went up but disruption was
reported as minimal.
Superior Court Judge Henry Rolph had ordered
the strikers back to work on Wednesday. Most
union leaders evaded deputies serving a court in
junction ordering them back to work.
