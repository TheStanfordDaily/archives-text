# April fools react to hoax

### Bruce Kadden 
"It must be real. The Daily wouldn't do something like
that," one student commented about yesterday's front
page story which reported that a massive nuclear reactor
was being constructed at the Frederick E. Terman En
gineering Center construction site.
But when Daily reporters were questioned about the
truth of the article, they staidly replied, "Look at the
calendar."
Some were not fooled by the bogus article which re
ported that a 500-megawatt reactor was to be installed in
order to generate power for evacuation centers in case of
thermonuclear war.
Asst. to the President William Stone and Vice President
for Public Affairs Robert Rosenzweig both said they were
prepared for a hoax. Stone reported that Presi
dent Richard Lyman got two paragraphs into the story
before laughing it off.
Duped
Stone also said that Executive Asst. to the Provost Ed
ward Shaw, who was mentioned in the story, was duped
further into the story than he would probably like to ad
mit.
Shaw could not be reached for comment, but his secret
ary said that he laughed when he first saw it.

'On guard'
University News Service Director Robert Beyers said
that hi 1 was "on guard against a Daily high jinks, "because
he had remembered other Dailv exploits at this time of

year.
Beyers said that at least four University staff members
were initially fooled. They were not alone, as many stu
dents believed the report, even after reading the last
paragraph which reminded the reader about the date.
But skeptics raised objections. One student asked:
'Whoever heard of the Office of Emergency Prepared
ness?" (The office actually exists.) Another didn't think a
Daily photographer could outwit the multimillion dollar
security system that was reported to surround the site.
Some upset
Others complained the Terman site is too small to con
tain so large a reactor.
While most persons were amused by the bogus story, a
number were upset. One supporter of the California Nuc
lear Safeguard Initiative didn't think the idea was funny.
No media outside the University picked up the story,
although a stringer for a local newspaper who is also a
Daily reporter, initially believed the contents of the arti
cle. In 1969, when the Daily reported that a Minuteman
missile system had been constructed in the Stanford
foothills, one Los Angeles television station sent a crew to
northern California after hearing about the story.
The Daily was not the only campus publication attempt
ing to fool its readers. The Law School Journal devoted
two pages to fake stories, reporting that Law Prof. John
Kaplan was arrested in Singapore, where he isnowvisit
ing, on a number of criminal charges.
The Journal also reported that former Law School Dean
Thomas Ehrlich had replaced F. Lee Bailey as head of the
Patricia Hearst defense team. The story said that although
Ehrlich had never handled a criminal case, he kept up
with developments in the field by watching the Petrocelli
television program.

Some upset
Others complained the Terman site is too small to con
tain so large a reactor.
While most persons were amused by the bogus story, a
number were upset. One supporter of the California Nuc
lear Safeguard Initiative didn't think the idea was funny.
No media outside the University picked up the story,
although a stringer for a local newspaper who is also a
Daily reporter, initially believed the contents of the arti
cle. In 1969, when the Daily reported that a Minuteman
missile system had been constructed in the Stanford
foothills, one Los Angeles television station sent a crew to
northern California after hearing about the story.
The Daily was not the only campus publication attempt
ing to fool its readers. The Law School Journal devoted
two pages to fake stories, reporting that Law Prof. John
Kaplan was arrested in Singapore, where he isnowvisit
ing, on a number of criminal charges.
The Journal also reported that former Law School Dean
Thomas Ehrlich had replaced F. Lee Bailey as head of the
Patricia Hearst defense team. The story said that although
Ehrlich had never handled a criminal case, he kept up
with developments in the field by watching the Petrocelli
television program.
"It must be real. The Daily wouldn't do something like
that," one student commented about yesterday's front
page story which reported that a massive nuclear reactor
was being constructed at the Frederick E. Terman En
gineering Center construction site.
But when Daily reporters were questioned about the
truth of the article, they staidly replied, "Look at the
calendar."
Some were not fooled by the bogus article which re
ported that a 500-megawatt reactor was to be installed in
order to generate power for evacuation centers in case of
thermonuclear war.
Asst. to the President William Stone and Vice President
for Public Affairs Robert Rosenzweig both said they were
prepared for a hoax. Stone reported that Presi
dent Richard Lyman got two paragraphs into the story
before laughing it off.
Duped
Stone also said that Executive Asst. to the Provost Ed
ward Shaw, who was mentioned in the story, was duped
further into the story than he would probably like to ad
mit.
Shaw could not be reached for comment, but his secret
ary said that he laughed when he first saw it.
One hoaxster submitted the following item to Once
Around the Quad as a response:

'On guard'
University News Service Director Robert Beyers said
that hi 1 was "on guard against a Daily high jinks, "because
he had remembered other Dailv exploits at this time of

year.
Beyers said that at least four University staff members
were initially fooled. They were not alone, as many stu
dents believed the report, even after reading the last
paragraph which reminded the reader about the date.
But skeptics raised objections. One student asked:
'Whoever heard of the Office of Emergency Prepared
ness?" (The office actually exists.) Another didn't think a
Daily photographer could outwit the multimillion dollar
security system that was reported to surround the site.
