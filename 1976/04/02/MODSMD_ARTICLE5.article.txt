# Dispatcher suspended; USE files grievance
## 
### Jack Vaughn 
A police-fire dispatcher who tiled a
civil suit and a sex discrimination
complaint against her police superiors
in February has been suspended by her
Plant Services Department supervisor
tor failing to dispatch an officer to a
police call.
Terri Longworth, who is a dis
patcher for the Department of Public
Safety, but is employed by Plant Ser
vices, was given a two-dav suspension
by Dola West, who supervises both
telecommunications operators and
emergency dispatchers.
In response, Longworth and her
United Stanford Employees (USE)
steward, John Leung have filed a grie
vance against both the Public Safety
and Plant Services departments,
claiming that the suspension is part of
a continuing effort to find grounds for
firing Longworth, Leung said.
Longworth could not be reached for
comment last night.
Longworth and Stephanie Onufer,
another dispatcher, filed a civil suit

charging harassment from officers
against the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Office in February. The
sheriff's office deputizes public safety
officers here.
The two also filed grievances alleg
ing police harassment with the Uni
versity, and a sex discrimination com
plaint against Police Captain Raoul
Niemeyer with the federal Employ
ment Opportunity Council.
Neither West, Leung nor Plant Ser
vices Director Jason Mavis, who said
he read West's suspension order Wed
nesday, would comment on the cir
cumstances of Longworth's alleged
failure to make the dispatch.
"She (Longworth) has a right under
her union contract and as a human
being to contest this suspension and
she has a right to keep private her rela
tions with her employers,"Mavis said
Over 90 complaints
Niemeyer, who said he did not know
the precise reason for the suspension,
said his department's file of com
plaints against police-fire dispatchers
"reads like a Russian novel."He said
there were over 90 complaints against
the dispatching crew in his file.
"Unprofessionalism on the radio"
has been"the last stumbling block in
developing a first-rate police depart
ment here," Niemeyer said.
Leung called the suspension a "very
clear discriminatory act" against
Longworth. "This sort of thing has
been happening for a long, long time.
They want to get rid of Terri
(Longworth) and Stephanie (Onufer),
too, and they've been waiting for
something like this to come up.
"The mistake Terri made is nothing
unusual," he said.
'Complete report'
Niemeyer said police personnel
"had written a complete report" for
West's investigation. "In addition,
they (Plant Services investigators) had
access to the (nightly) reports and to
the tapes of dispatches," he said.

Although Niemeyer denied "sys
tematically trying to weed out"
Longworth and Onufer, he said he was
"damned sick and tired "of harassment
charges by the two dispatchers.
"The facts will show that we (police
officers) were clearly in the right" in
the continuing dispute between police
and dispatchers, Niemeyer said.
Commenting that dispatcher "in
competence" has given the police
"a very, very bad reputation in the
county." Niemeyer said he supports
a Stanford Research Institute recom
mendation that "all the emergency
communications in this county should
be merged," phasing out the dispatch
ers here.
Center in Palo Alto
"Palo Alto would be the host de
partment" and have the dispatching
center for Mountain View and the
campus as well as its own police,
Niemeyer said.
Longworth and Onufer said last
month that Niemeyer's support for this
proposal, coupled with "a personalty
conflict," has been the cause for bad
feelings among the dispatchers. The
two claimed police personnel want to
take over their jobs, with or without a
merger.
Niemeyer indicated he was dissatis
fied with having dispatchers who are
not police employes.
"We (the police) are the 85 percent
user of the dispatchers and at the pre
sent time we have very little input,
very little control" over the dispatch
ers, he said.
Attitude blamed
Leung said Niemeyer's attitude to
ward Longworth and Onufer is the
principal cause for the dispute.
"It is quite clear that Niemeyer has a
personality conflict based on the sexist
outlook toward the dispatchers," said
Leung.
