# Committee urges shuttle extension

### Rosario Delatorre 
The University Committee on Park
ing and Transportation will recom
mend today that the evening shuttle
bus experiment be continued until
April 30. according to Assoc. Planner
Stephen Schmidt.
The committee met yesterday after
noon to review the shuttle and decided
to make the recommendation to Vice
President for Business and Finance
Robert Augsburger.
"I think theridership has shown that
there is a demand for the service and
justifies going further (with the exper
iment)", said Schmidt.
This decision will not affect the day
time service, which will also expire
April 30, when the lease of the "Mar
guerite" buses expires. "We attempted
to extend the lease but that wasn't pos
sible," Schmidt said.
According to Schmidt, ridership on

the evening shuttle averages around
50 persons per night.
"The number of riders a night has
ranged from a low of about 30 persons
to a high of about 110 persons but the
average has remained unchanged
since February (when the experiment
began)," he said.
Donald Winbigler, chairman of the
committee, said, "The ridership was
low, but our decision was not made on
that basis. It is merely that we feel we
should give it more time ... we need
more information."
Winbigler said he did not wish to
speculate on what Augsburger's re
sponse to the recommendation would
be.
Surveys
Schmidt explained that the plan
ning office has been conducting sur
veys on the buses to collect informa
tion so the committee can make its
final recommendation in mid-May.
The committee will decide whether
to recommend that the University es
tablish a permanent shuttle-bus ser
vice, operating during the day as well
as the evening.
"The decision will have to be made
by June 1 because the committee does
not meet over the summer," Schmidt
said.
If a recommendation to establish a
shuttle bus is approved, buses could
begin running in September, he ad
ded.
Encouraging response
"The response to the shuttle bus is
encouraging enough for the University
to consider a permanent service,"
Schmidt added.
Results of the shuttle-bus surveys
indicate that HO percent of the riders on
the evening shuttle are students. In
addition, persons using the bus are
those who would otherwise have
walked or ridden a bike.
Most persons use the bus between
6:30 and 7:30 p.m. and the shuttle is
used very little after 10 p.m. Destina
tions of those using the evening shut
tle are scattered but there are concen
trations at Tresidder, Memorial Au
ditorium and along the Row.
Schmidt explained that use of the
daytime shuttle differs from that of the
evening shuttle. About 60 percent of
the riders are students and most of the
destinations are concentrated in Es
condido Village and the Medical
Center. Survey results indicate that 20
percent of the riders used the shuttle
instead of usinu their cars.
"The first two weeks the (daytime)
shuttle was operating with two buses
there were around 1000 rides each day.
Now there are between 500 and 700
riders per day." Schmidt said.
He said the reason for the drop was
that two weeks into the experiment
one of the buses broke down and
riders had to wait 20 minutes for the
bus.
"People didn't want to wait that
long so ridership fell off and we reco
vered very slowly after we got the
other bus running. We can avoid this
problem if a permanent shuttle is es
tablished by having a third bus to use
when one is not running," said
Schmidt.
Schmidt said the experiment has
cost $55,000 for the daytime shuttle
and about $4500 for the nighttime ser
vice. "The (Stanford) Shopping Center
initially contributed $18,000 which
makes the University's share about
$40,000." he said.

ing and Transportation will recom
mend today that the evening shuttle
bus experiment be continued until
April 30. according to Assoc. Planner
Stephen Schmidt.
The committee met yesterday after
noon to review the shuttle and decided
to make the recommendation to Vice
President for Business and Finance
Robert Augsburger.
"I think theridership has shown that
there is a demand for the service and
justifies going further (with the exper
iment)", said Schmidt.
This decision will not affect the day
time service, which will also expire
April 30, when the lease of the "Mar
guerite" buses expires. "We attempted
to extend the lease but that wasn't pos
sible," Schmidt said.
According to Schmidt, ridership on

the evening shuttle averages around
50 persons per night.
"The number of riders a night has
ranged from a low of about 30 persons
to a high of about 110 persons but the
average has remained unchanged
since February (when the experiment
began)," he said.
Donald Winbigler, chairman of the
committee, said, "The ridership was
low, but our decision was not made on
that basis. It is merely that we feel we
should give it more time ... we need
more information."
Winbigler said he did not wish to
speculate on what Augsburger's re
sponse to the recommendation would
be.
Surveys
Schmidt explained that the plan
ning office has been conducting sur
veys on the buses to collect informa
tion so the committee can make its
final recommendation in mid-May.
The committee will decide whether
to recommend that the University es
tablish a permanent shuttle-bus ser
vice, operating during the day as well
as the evening.
"The decision will have to be made
by June 1 because the committee does
not meet over the summer," Schmidt
said.
If a recommendation to establish a
shuttle bus is approved, buses could
begin running in September, he ad
ded.
Encouraging response
"The response to the shuttle bus is
encouraging enough for the University
to consider a permanent service,"
Schmidt added.
Results of the shuttle-bus surveys
indicate that HO percent of the riders on
the evening shuttle are students. In
addition, persons using the bus are
those who would otherwise have
walked or ridden a bike.
Most persons use the bus between
6:30 and 7:30 p.m. and the shuttle is
used very little after 10 p.m. Destina
tions of those using the evening shut
tle are scattered but there are concen
trations at Tresidder, Memorial Au
ditorium and along the Row.
Schmidt explained that use of the
daytime shuttle differs from that of the
evening shuttle. About 60 percent of
the riders are students and most of the
destinations are concentrated in Es
condido Village and the Medical
Center. Survey results indicate that 20
percent of the riders used the shuttle
instead of usinu their cars.
"The first two weeks the (daytime)
shuttle was operating with two buses
there were around 1000 rides each day.
Now there are between 500 and 700
riders per day." Schmidt said.
He said the reason for the drop was
that two weeks into the experiment
one of the buses broke down and
riders had to wait 20 minutes for the
bus.
"People didn't want to wait that
long so ridership fell off and we reco
vered very slowly after we got the
other bus running. We can avoid this
problem if a permanent shuttle is es
tablished by having a third bus to use
when one is not running," said
Schmidt.
Schmidt said the experiment has
cost $55,000 for the daytime shuttle
and about $4500 for the nighttime ser
vice. "The (Stanford) Shopping Center
initially contributed $18,000 which
makes the University's share about
$40,000." he said.
