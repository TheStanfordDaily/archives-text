Howard, et al.
Stanford is a community in which students
have a genuine concern with the structure and
policies of the University, a concern no less
valid than that of the administration and fa
culty. Accordingly, students must play an ac
tive role in the continuing development of the
University in order to insure a fair and open
community, attuned and responsive to all of
its members.
The Council of Presidents (COP) can be ef
fective in educating the student community on
issues and aspects of University life, allowing
them to assume a more informed and active
role. By fostering increased communication
among the various segments of the commun
ity, it is possible to coordinate existing chan
nels of student participation.
As spokespersons for student opinion and
liaisons between students and administrators,
the COP can lobby for greater student influ
ence in decisions shaping students' educa
tional environment.
Given this view of the COP and its role in the
University, these are some of the projects we
will undertake in the coming year.
—Introduction of continuity and long term
planning into student government structure.
—Establishment of undergraduate de
partmental organizations.
—Greater integration of the ASSU and
graduate student organizations.
— Retention of the University Budget
Priorities Advisory Commission.
—Increased third world input and rep
resentation in University and student gov
ernments.
—More aggressive and effective affirmative
action.
—Transformation of Tresidder into a more
viable community center.
While working on these concerns, we shall
not losesight of thefact that basic assumptions
of the University, such as those surrounding
its tenure policy, underlie many of the prob
lems that students face. We shall challenge
these assumptions when they run counter to
the interest of students, for any other strategy
is merely a symptomatic treatment of the prob
lems.

Petroff, et al.
In April, along with other evidence of
spring, candidates for the Council of Presi
dents emerge in an attempt to win a generally
unappreciated election.
Skepticism directed toward the electoral
process is justified, particularly in light of the
disappointing record of our predecessors. We
ask your help in correcting this situation.
In an era of campus-wide budgetary cut
backs, intelligent management of the ASSU
projects is imperative for the continuation ot
benefits which students gain from such pro
jects.
As the first director of Lecture Notes, Vic
Petroff not only produced a net profit over
initial costs in the first quarter of the service's
existence, he was instrumental in the de
velopment of a project that has received fa
culty and student praise for academic value to
the University.
One of the areas of student government most
often criticized is the ASSU Senate, a body
ridiculously divided into unproductive fac
tions.
Carole Houck, an undergraduate senator,
has been in the forefront of an attempt to re
concile these factions, sponsoring an infor
mal, unofficial meeting of the senate to iron
out differences and bring that body back to the
issues for which you elected its members.
As phairperson of the Graduate Student
Council, Deric Jennings has worked success
fully to increase the influence of informed
graduate opinion on graduate policy deci
sions. Issues such as financial aid for graduate
students on a need basis have benefited from
Jennings' leadership on the council.
Finally, Al Tomaszczuk, as chairperson of
the subcommittee on residences last year,
coauthored the proposal which temporarily
resolved the critical inequities of the housing
draw system.
This was a classic case of well-informed
students working with other University au
thorities to alleviate student needs.
This is not time for rhetoric. We have de
monstrated, in ou r experience, qualities of fi
nancial knowledge, reconciliation of conflict
ing groups, leadership and initiative.
