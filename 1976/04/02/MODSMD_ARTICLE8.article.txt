# Letters: Proposition 15

Nuclear energy
1 hope the Daily plans to fea
ture an article which is pro-
Proposition 15 in the very near
future. The March 30 Daily arti
cle on Edward Teller by Marc
Strassman is so slanted that the
Daily ought to feel compelled to
exercise journalistic responsi
bility and offer some sort of a
rebuttal. How else but disfavor
ably could "the father of the
hydrogen bomb" look at Propos
ition 15?
Specifically. I found Teller's
reasoning unsound.
How can he argue that prolif
eration of nuclear energy, in
whatever form, is a "positive ac
tion to eliminate the causes of
war?" He also says Proposition
15 is supported bv "elitists who
forget about the real problems of
the world and substitute im
aginary fears."
Yet Teller is the one who
wishes away the very real and
documented problems of
radioactive waste storage and
rising levels of radioactivity in
the genetic pool, which, con
trary to his assertion, still re
main unsolved, and are admit
ted to be such by top scientists
on both sides of the fence.
Furthermore, the notion that
underdevelopment in poorer

countries can only be elimi
nated by "introducing nuclear
power plants" is ridiculous. If
we have learned anything from
our past failures in this area it is
that underdeveloped countries
do not need highly capital
intensive industries which be
nefit only a very small percent of
the urban population and actu
ally create more under
development by neglecting the
rest of the country.
Proposition 15 offers the pub
lic a chance to reflect on a com
mittment to the future, and it de
serves a full and fair discussion.
Teller's thinking is only one
more example of science with
out a conscience, of a scientist
who sees only an engineering
problem and ignores the deeper
moral one.
Perhaps he would do well to
listen to the words of another
great scientist, Albert Einstein,
who, distressed over nuclear
proliferation, repeated
hopelessly on his deathbed,
"Why won't they listen, why
won't they listen?"

(Editor's note: The> Daily article
on Teller was written in re
sponse to criticism that the
paper had given little coverage

to opinion against Proposition
15. Thearticle wasan attempt to
balance the paper's coverage.)
Edward Teller's argument in
the March 29 Daily that the de
velopment of nuclear power
plants is necessary to eliminate
the disparity of wealth between
the rich nations and the poor,
tugs at the heartstringsbut is not
convincing.
Since World War 11, technol
ogy has made rapid advances
and energy has been cheap and
plentiful, yet the disparity bet
ween the rich and poor people of
the world has only increased.
Reducing this gap depends on
who controls the resources —
including energy — available
to underdeveloped countries
and on whether those resources
are used for the profit of a few or
to benefit the many.
Peasants driven off the land,
living under corrupt military
regimes that profit from collab
oration with multi-national
corporations, will not benefit
from the defeat of the Nuclear
Safeguards Initiative. Nor will
those Americans whose utility
bills have steadily increased
along with utility company pro
fits.
