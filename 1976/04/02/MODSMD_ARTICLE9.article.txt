# Learning at Stanford: memorization
## 
### 
Scott Rutherford

I spent my first year at Stanford under
the naive impression that higher learning
and creative thinking had a direct correla
tion.
I mistakenly believed that my admit
tance to Stanford would lead to the end of
rote memorization and regurgitation. I also
held the false impression that Stanford pro
fessors actually sought individuality in
thinking and creativity in problem solving.
Like most freshmen. I sought not merely
to memorize facts, but to assimilate them,
rework them and derive new theories from
the old. 1 looked upon tests and term papers
not merely as proof of my ability to
memorize, but as opportunities for the free
expression of new ideas.
And. like most freshmen. I was dissatis
fied with my grade point average (GPA).
Outgrown attitudes
1 am happy to say that I have now out
grown those foolish attitudes.
1 no longer attempt to go beyond the facts.
I seek only to memorize the words of
teacher and text.

My examinations offer no new insights,
no originality, no intelligence — they are
perfect examples of feeding back to the pro
fessor exactly what he shoveled out in the
first place. And. 1 am happy to say. as my
ability to regurgitate improved, my ability
to think declined almost as rapidly as my
GPA increased.
I am especially ingratiated to the Politi
cal Science Department for its wondrous
help in turning me away from the naive
notion that one's own opinions and ideas
are valuable. It took but one introductory
course to prove that the important thing is
to learn what others say. to capsulize their
thoughts, to isolate their ideas from the rest
of the world, to reword their beliefs and to
fill one's test pages not with anything new
or brilliant, but with quotes from John Ken
neth Galbraith or Paul Sweezy.
After all, the old idea of liberal thought as
open mindedness is fully antiquated. Lib
eral thought, of course, entails only agree
ment with those who are known tobelilwr

als. Or, to he more specific, "liberal" means
"registered Democrat."
Better grades
I am also happy to say that I have man
aged to turn the subjective grading system
into a device for obtaining better grades.
One need not try to act intelligent or
learn any new material to obtain "A"
grades. It is much simple to find out one's
grader's personal beliefs, to summarize
his/her ideas and to write them on one's test
pages.
After all, one need not prove those views
which agree with the professor — one need
only prove anything new and different.
Thank God learning at Stanford has be
come so cut and dry. Thank C»od there is no
longer any room nor need for debate.
Thank God there is no longer any need to
think at Stanford.
Perhaps someday 1 shall achieve the ul
timate goal of many a Stanford student —
the maintaining of a 4.0 while learning no
thing and memorizing everything.
