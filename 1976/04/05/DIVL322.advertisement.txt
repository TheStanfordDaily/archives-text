This program is designed for advanced students with a special interest in German Studies
or in related aspects of their field of study in the humanities and the sciences. The
program provides the opportunity for such students to maintain normal progress toward
their degrees at Stanford while pursuing their academic interests at a major German
university; at the same time, participants will be able to perfect their proficiency in the
language and to experience German life intensively and comprehensively in West
Germany's major metropolitan area in the heart of the Rhineland.
Eligibility-Qualified juniors, seniors, and graduate students are eligible, provided they
have the necessary competence in German, usually two years of college level study or the
equivalent. Previous participation in overseas programs in Germany or Austria is welcome,
but not required.
Costsâ€”Participants pay regular Stanford tuition for two quarters plus the overseas fee,
which is expected to be about $635 per quarter.
Application for participation in the 1976-77 program should be made not later than April
15, 1976; applications arc available in the German Studies office and in the Stanford
Overseas Studies office.
