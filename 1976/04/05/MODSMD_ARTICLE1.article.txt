# Native Americans cite FBI 'injustice'
## 
### Ann Amioka 
The FBI and other government
agencies are engaged in an effort to
destroy the American Indian Move
ment (AIM), an AIM supporter said in
a press conference here Friday.
AIM supporters have been arrested
on trumped-up charges, subjected to
excessively harsh treatment and lied to
by law enforcement officials, accord
ing to Russ Redner, a 29-year-old
Western Shoshone.
Redner and two other AIM support
ers, Ken Loudhawk and KaMook
Banks, will goon trial May 12 in Fort
land, Ore., for possession and in
terstate transport of unregistered ex
plosives and firearms.
Redner cited the treatment of him
self and his fellow defendants as an
example of the "double standard of
justice" which native Americans face.
No rights
He said the defendants were not read
their rights until three days after their
Nov. 14, 1975 arrest and that he and
Loudhawk were not allowed
visits for 60 days after the arrest, al
though they had not been charged
with a capital offense.
Redner also blamed the FBI for the
death of Anna Mae Aquash, a 30-
year-old Micmac Indian from Nova
Scotia who was also arrested on Nov.
14.
Aquash was illegally moved from
Oregon to South Dakota, where she
was wanted on a firearms violation
charge, Redner said. She disappeared
there, and her body was found near
Wanblee on the Pine Ridge Reserva
tion.
Autopsies disagree
A local medical examiner declared
Aquash had died of exposure. How
ever, in a second autopsy, a St. Paul
pathologist hired by Oglala leaders
found that she had been shot in the
back of the head, an AIM pamphlet
reported.
"I say the FBI did that," said Redner.
The FBI encourages white citizens
to treat native Americans unjustly and
commits injustices itself, Redner said.
"They're taking other people and
they're putting the gun in their hand
and they're putting the ideas in their
head and they're putting the money in
their pocket," he said.
Pull trigger
"The only thing they're not doing is
pulling the trigger."
According to Redner, the federal
government in 1973 "used Wounded
Knee as a test site for developing a
countednsurgency plan to put down
any future revolutionary groups or ac
tivities." The plan is called "Cable
Splicer," he said.
Besides illegally moving on the re
servation in an "armed fashion," the
government also violated the Geneva

Accords at Wounded Knee by con
ducting siege warfare there, said Red
ner.
Free reservations
Redner said he views the reserva
tions as sovereign entities and that he
would like to see "a complete inde
pendence for the red people."
Once the land is obtained, AIM
wants to ensure that it is not en
croached upon by making the borders
"solid" and "well known to the
people," he explained.
AIM also seeks to gain "jurisdiction
over our lands," so that "we can have
the power to arrest someone who has
committed a crime against our
people," Redner said.
Redner's brother, Frank, a senior in
political science here, stated that
government treaties stipulate
sovereignty for native Americans.
"We're not asking for land that
people are living on right now," said
Steve Kane, a member of the Stanford
American Indian Organization
(SAIO). The land AIM wants is "un
used federal property . . . land that has
been taken from us surrounding reser
vations," he explained.
"We're not going to stand by, as
Stanford students, and let this hap
pen," he added. "We're trying to get an
education, supposedly to go back and
help our people. There won't be any
thing left by the time we get an educa
tion."
