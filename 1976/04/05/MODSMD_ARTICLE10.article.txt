# Great Sioux's fight for survival
## 
### 
David Corkery

The near civil war raging on
Pine Ridge Reservation —at the
cost of an estimated 70 lives
since the Wounded Knee con
frontation three years ago — has
gone far beyond a struggle over
land and power. The traditional
Oglala Sioux are fighting to se
cede from the United States.
They never legally joined. The
1868 treaty ending the wars bet
ween the Great Sioux Nation and
the United States was an agree
ment between two sovereign na
tions.
Today the traditional Oglala
people see sovereignty as their
only hope for survival. Leaving
the reservation for the cities
means an isolated existence in a
foreign culture for which they
are unprepared — a form of
psychological suicide. Al
coholism and suicide are com
mon results.
The staying on the reservation
under the power of the federal
Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)
means, for most, dying at the age
of 42. BIA policies, in the words
of traditional leader Louis Bad
Wound, are "an attempt to de
stroy the Indian completely —
not only his culture, his religion,
his language, but the totality."
Mixed bloods
Largely as a result of BIA pol
icy, 90 percent of Oglala lands
are now controlled by ranchers
with little or no Indian blood.
With unemployment at 70 per
cent, the reservation's 900
federally-funded jobs are
monopolized by mixed bloods
who share the white culture.
Recognition of Sioux
sovereignty — secession —
means gaining control over tri
bal lands and government.
The BIA itself, in its original
June 1975 Pine Ridge Commis
sion Report, agreed that the key
issue underlying the ongoing
crisis was recognition of the
sovereignty granted by the
1868 treaty. But the White
House, according to a BIA
source, forced omission of this
portion from the final published
version.
To the traditionals. the treaty
issue is not just a bargaining
chip to gain reform of the BIA or
financial compensation for
Sioux lands taken. The tradi
tional Oglala people have been
taught from birth that they are a
sovereign nation — their sacred
lands illegally occupied by
white America.

They have organized their
own government — made up of
their 33 traditional chiefs and
headmen,and separate from the
tribal council — called the
Lakota Treaty Council.
The treaty council has al
ready met with President Ford
and other government officials
in Washington, out of which
came a Presidential Treaty Re
view Commission. The council
has opened an office in New
York to press its case before the
United Nations and is appealing
for legal recognition of its
sovereign rights from the World
Court in Geneva.
Meanwhile, at Pine Ridge, the
council has been recognized by
newly elected President Al
Trimble as his principal advis
ory body.
The power of the sovereignty
issue has grown as a direct result
of the increasingly bloody
polarization on the reservation
between the traditionals, on one
side, and the mixed bloods who
share the white culture and
monopolize the reservation's
land and jobs, on the other.
At one time, the traditionals
asked for federal intervention to
stem the reign of terror they
claimed former tribal President
Richard Wilson and his suppor
ters waged to preserve that
monopoly. After repeated futile
efforts, they are now convinced
that the U.S. government is ac
tively siding with Wilson's
forces as a way of preserving
white control over the reserva
tion.
Total separation
As a result, they are pushing
for total separation from the fed
eral government and white
America. With sovereignty, the
traditionals believe, they would
be able to begin erasing the im
pact of white America on their
land and culture.
They plan to discard the rep
resentative system of tribal gov
ernment — with its elected
council and president — im
posed on them in 1934 by the
BIA and legally ratified in an
election held only in English,
halting, the participation of
many traditionals. In its place
they would put the old form of
tribal government, with a coun
cil of chiefs and headmen who
consult with their people on
every issue and do not act until
tribal consensus has been
reached.

Less tangible but perhaps
more important, they would re
build their traditional culture
and religion — the system of
values that binds them together
and has been severely
threatened by the white culture
brought to the reservation by the
federal BIA.
The man who will play a key
mediation role between the fed
eral bureaucracy and the tradi
tionals as they press for recogni
tion of sovereignty is Trimble.
People's suffering
After the 1973 Wounded Knee
occupation he was named BIA
superintendent at Pine Ridge —
and during his 16 months in that
post he says he learned first
hand the suffering of the tradi
tional people under Wilson and
the BIA.
As he began to work to bring
back control over jobs, land and
the police to the traditional
Sioux, he became a thorn in Wil
son's and the BlA's sides. And

Wilson freely admits putting
pressure on the BIA, success
fully, to remove Trimble.
Beyond the treaty issue, Trim
ble and his supporters will be
working to neutralize the Wilson
power structure — in Trimble's
words, "to diminish fear and an
xiety on the reservation by get
ting rid of Wilson's goon squad."
They will also attempt to decen
tralize control of police, educa
tion and other services on the re
servation — putting them in the
hands of local citizens in each
community.
If the Oglalas' fight for recog
nition of sovereignty fails no one
here knows what will happen.
They have a deep religious faith
that their God — whom they call
Great Mystery — will never let
the Sioux nation die. If it should,
they are sure revenge will be vis
ited on those responsible.

Recognition of Sioux
sovereignty — secession —
means gaining control over tri

The BIA itself, in its original
June 1975 Pine Ridge Commis

issue underlying the ongoing
crisis was recognition of the
sovereignty granted by the
1868 treaty. But the White
House, according to a BIA
source, forced omission of this
portion from the final published
version.
To the traditionals. the treaty
issue is not just a bargaining
chip to gain reform of the BIA or
financial compensation for
Sioux lands taken. The tradi
tional Oglala people have been
taught from birth that they are a
sovereign nation — their sacred
lands illegally occupied by
white America.

They have organized their
own government — made up of
their 33 traditional chiefs and
headmen,and separate from the
tribal council — called the
Lakota Treaty Council.
The treaty council has al
ready met with President Ford
and other government officials
in Washington, out of which
came a Presidential Treaty Re
view Commission. The council
has opened an office in New
York to press its case before the
United Nations and is appealing
for legal recognition of its
sovereign rights from the World
Court in Geneva.
Meanwhile, at Pine Ridge, the
council has been recognized by
newly elected President Al
Trimble as his principal advis
ory body.
The power of the sovereignty
issue has grown as a direct result
of the increasingly bloody
polarization on the reservation
between the traditionals, on one
side, and the mixed bloods who
share the white culture and
monopolize the reservation's
land and jobs, on the other.
At one time, the traditionals
asked for federal intervention to
stem the reign of terror they
claimed former tribal President
Richard Wilson and his suppor
ters waged to preserve that
monopoly. After repeated futile
efforts, they are now convinced
that the U.S. government is ac
tively siding with Wilson's
forces as a way of preserving
white control over the reserva
tion.
Total separation
As a result, they are pushing
for total separation from the fed
eral government and white
America. With sovereignty, the
traditionals believe, they would
be able to begin erasing the im
pact of white America on their
land and culture.
They plan to discard the rep
resentative system of tribal gov
ernment — with its elected
council and president — im
posed on them in 1934 by the
BIA and legally ratified in an
election held only in English,
halting, the participation of
many traditionals. In its place
they would put the old form of
tribal government, with a coun
cil of chiefs and headmen who
consult with their people on
every issue and do not act until
tribal consensus has been
reached.

Less tangible but perhaps
more important, they would re
build their traditional culture
and religion — the system of
values that binds them together
and has been severely
threatened by the white culture
brought to the reservation by the
federal BIA.
The man who will play a key
mediation role between the fed
eral bureaucracy and the tradi
tionals as they press for recogni
tion of sovereignty is Trimble.
People's suffering
After the 1973 Wounded Knee
occupation he was named BIA
superintendent at Pine Ridge —
and during his 16 months in that
post he says he learned first
hand the suffering of the tradi
tional people under Wilson and
the BIA.
As he began to work to bring
back control over jobs, land and
the police to the traditional
Sioux, he became a thorn in Wil
son's and the BlA's sides. And

Wilson freely admits putting
pressure on the BIA, success
fully, to remove Trimble.
Beyond the treaty issue, Trim
ble and his supporters will be
working to neutralize the Wilson
power structure — in Trimble's
words, "to diminish fear and an
xiety on the reservation by get
ting rid of Wilson's goon squad."
They will also attempt to decen
tralize control of police, educa

servation — putting them in the
hands of local citizens in each
community.
If the Oglalas' fight for recog
nition of sovereignty fails no one
here knows what will happen.

The near civil war raging on
Pine Ridge Reservation —at the
cost of an estimated 70 lives
since the Wounded Knee con
frontation three years ago — has
gone far beyond a struggle over
land and power. The traditional
Oglala Sioux are fighting to se
cede from the United States.
They never legally joined. The
1868 treaty ending the wars bet
ween the Great Sioux Nation and
the United States was an agree
ment between two sovereign na
tions.
Today the traditional Oglala
people see sovereignty as their
only hope for survival. Leaving
the reservation for the cities
means an isolated existence in a
foreign culture for which they
are unprepared — a form of
psychological suicide. Al
coholism and suicide are com
mon results.
The staying on the reservation
under the power of the federal
Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)
means, for most, dying at the age
of 42. BIA policies, in the words
of traditional leader Louis Bad
Wound, are "an attempt to de
stroy the Indian completely —
not only his culture, his religion,
his language, but the totality."
Mixed bloods
Largely as a result of BIA pol
icy, 90 percent of Oglala lands
are now controlled by ranchers
with little or no Indian blood.

Meanwhile, at Pine Ridge, the
council has been recognized by
newly elected President Al
Trimble as his principal advis
ory body.
The power of the sovereignty
issue has grown as a direct result
of the increasingly bloody
polarization on the reservation
between the traditionals, on one
side, and the mixed bloods who
share the white culture and
monopolize the reservation's
land and jobs, on the other.
At one time, the traditionals
asked for federal intervention to
stem the reign of terror they
claimed former tribal President
Richard Wilson and his suppor
ters waged to preserve that
monopoly. After repeated futile
efforts, they are now convinced
that the U.S. government is ac
tively siding with Wilson's
forces as a way of preserving
white control over the reserva
tion.
Total separation
As a result, they are pushing
for total separation from the fed
eral government and white
America. With sovereignty, the
traditionals believe, they would
be able to begin erasing the im
pact of white America on their
land and culture.
They plan to discard the rep
resentative system of tribal gov
ernment — with its elected
council and president — im
posed on them in 1934 by the
BIA and legally ratified in an
election held only in English,
halting, the participation of
many traditionals. In its place
they would put the old form of
tribal government, with a coun
cil of chiefs and headmen who
consult with their people on
every issue and do not act until
tribal consensus has been
reached.

Less tangible but perhaps
more important, they would re
build their traditional culture
and religion — the system of
values that binds them together
and has been severely
threatened by the white culture
brought to the reservation by the
federal BIA.
The man who will play a key
mediation role between the fed
eral bureaucracy and the tradi
tionals as they press for recogni
tion of sovereignty is Trimble.
People's suffering
After the 1973 Wounded Knee
occupation he was named BIA
superintendent at Pine Ridge —
and during his 16 months in that
post he says he learned first
hand the suffering of the tradi
tional people under Wilson and
the BIA.
As he began to work to bring
back control over jobs, land and
the police to the traditional
Sioux, he became a thorn in Wil
son's and the BlA's sides. And

Wilson freely admits putting
pressure on the BIA, success
fully, to remove Trimble.
Beyond the treaty issue, Trim
ble and his supporters will be
working to neutralize the Wilson
power structure — in Trimble's
words, "to diminish fear and an
xiety on the reservation by get
ting rid of Wilson's goon squad."
They will also attempt to decen
tralize control of police, educa
tion and other services on the re
servation — putting them in the
hands of local citizens in each
community.
If the Oglalas' fight for recog
nition of sovereignty fails no one
here knows what will happen.
They have a deep religious faith
that their God — whom they call
Great Mystery — will never let
the Sioux nation die. If it should,
they are sure revenge will be vis
ited on those responsible.

The near civil war raging on
Pine Ridge Reservation —at the
cost of an estimated 70 lives
since the Wounded Knee con
frontation three years ago — has
gone far beyond a struggle over
land and power. The traditional
Oglala Sioux are fighting to se
cede from the United States.
They never legally joined. The
1868 treaty ending the wars bet
ween the Great Sioux Nation and
the United States was an agree
ment between two sovereign na
tions.
Today the traditional Oglala
people see sovereignty as their
only hope for survival. Leaving
the reservation for the cities
means an isolated existence in a
foreign culture for which they
are unprepared — a form of
psychological suicide. Al
coholism and suicide are com
mon results.
The staying on the reservation
under the power of the federal
Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)
means, for most, dying at the age
of 42. BIA policies, in the words
of traditional leader Louis Bad
Wound, are "an attempt to de
stroy the Indian completely —
not only his culture, his religion,
his language, but the totality."
Mixed bloods
Largely as a result of BIA pol
icy, 90 percent of Oglala lands
are now controlled by ranchers
with little or no Indian blood.
With unemployment at 70 per
cent, the reservation's 900
federally-funded jobs are
monopolized by mixed bloods
who share the white culture.
Recognition of Sioux
sovereignty — secession —
means gaining control over tri
bal lands and government.
The BIA itself, in its original
June 1975 Pine Ridge Commis
sion Report, agreed that the key
issue underlying the ongoing
crisis was recognition of the
sovereignty granted by the
1868 treaty. But the White
House, according to a BIA
source, forced omission of this
portion from the final published
version.
To the traditionals. the treaty
issue is not just a bargaining
chip to gain reform of the BIA or
financial compensation for
Sioux lands taken. The tradi
tional Oglala people have been
taught from birth that they are a
sovereign nation — their sacred
lands illegally occupied by
white America.

They have organized their
own government — made up of
their 33 traditional chiefs and
headmen,and separate from the
tribal council — called the
Lakota Treaty Council.
The treaty council has al
ready met with President Ford
and other government officials
in Washington, out of which
came a Presidential Treaty Re
view Commission. The council
has opened an office in New
York to press its case before the
United Nations and is appealing
for legal recognition of its
sovereign rights from the World
Court in Geneva.
Meanwhile, at Pine Ridge, the
council has been recognized by
newly elected President Al
Trimble as his principal advis
ory body.
The power of the sovereignty
issue has grown as a direct result
