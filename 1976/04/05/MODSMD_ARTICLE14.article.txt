# Djibouti: Africa's next Angola?
## 
### 
LONDON — Somewhere in the Penta
gon and the Kremlin, dossiers on an
obscure French colony at the mouth of the
Red Sea are moving quietly to the top of
the pile. Called Djibouti, this tiny enclave
of 130,000 could be Africa's next Angola.
After a century of colonial rule, France
announced December 31 that it would
grant independence to Djibouti — for
mally called the French Territory of the
Afars and Issas. But the prospects for a
peaceful transfer of power look bad — and
conflict could easily escalate into super
power confrontation.
At root is possible civil strife between
Djibouti's two nationalities — the Afars
and the Issas — that would likely trigger
intervention by neighboring Somalia
(with a population of Issas) and Ethiopia
(which contains 200,000 nomadic Afars).
Behind Somalia stands the Soviet
Union, which trains and equips the
20,000-man Somali army and has a mis
sile facility in Berbera, on the Somali
coast. Behind Ethiopia is the U.S., sup
plying the military hardware for its war
against rebel Eritreans and using its ports
for naval purposes.
France in middle
And in the middle — keeping 6000
troops in Djibouti to conduct aerial sur
veillance of Somalia and radical South
Yemen for her Western allies — stands
France.
Add to this the strategic importance of
Djibouti, commanding the narrow mouth
of the Red Sea — the Suez Canal's south
ern gate — and all the ingredients emerge
for a decolonization dispute rivaling
those in the Congo, the Spanish Sahara
and now Angola.

Tension is already high. December
alone saw an assassination attempt on the
colony s premier, a border clash between
the French Foreign Legion and troops of
neighboring Somalia and a diplomatic
flare-up between Somalia and Ethiopia
following an attack by 1000 dem
onstrators on the Ethiopian embassy in
Somalia.

1 he I* rench decision to grant Djibouti
independence — if the Afars and Issas
vote for it in a referendum — followed
pressure both from the military junta that
took over Ethiopia in 1974 and from the
U.N., which voted December 9 to ask
Prance to give up her colony.
But Paris wants to retain a military pres
ence in Djibouti to continue its aerial
surveillance operations. It thus plans to
turn the reins of power over to its hand
groomed candidate, the colony's present
premier, Ali Aref.
But Aref is an Afar, the minority tribe
by some 20,000. The French have relied
upon the Afars for local administration
since annexing the territory in 1862, rig
ging electoral rolls to give the Afars a
majority in the colonial assembly.
Garrison city
Most of the Afars live in the capital city
of Djibouti, which is surrounded by 10
miles of barbed wire and mines and
guarded by the French Foreign Legion.
The barrier was erected to keep out "un
desirables" after anti-French riots in
1966. The "undesirables" are the Issas,
dozens of whom have been killed or
maimed on the line since.
Aref himself came to power on an anti-
Issa platform, calling for continued adhe

sion to France and the expulsion of all
Issas without proper identity cards or
who voted for independence in a 1967 re
ferendum.
In 1973, in the most recent colonial as
sembly elections, Aref was accused of
bringing in extra Afar voters from
Ethiopia and preventing Issas from stand
ing for election.
Today Aref and his supporters have
changed the name of their party from
Union and Progress Within the French
Whole to the National Unity Party for
Independence, but they still call for
French economic and military presence
after independence.
Opposition
The main opposition party, the Popular
African League for Independence, is led
by Hassan Goulded (an Issa) and Ahmed
Dini (an Afar). They advocate "genuine
independence," including an end to the
French military presence. When Aref
launched his new party last December an
estimated 2000 attended his rally, while
20,000 showed up for a simultaneous
rally of the African League.
If tension erupts into violence, Somalia
and Ethiopia — already watching each
other closely for moves toward annexa
tion of Djibouti after the French depart —
will almost surely become involved.
The Somalis still call Djibouti "French
Somaliland," its name until 1967. Their
president, Siad Barre, has written to
French President Giscard d'Estaing op
posing what he calls "fake decoloniza
tion" and demanding that France remove
its troops, take down the fence around
Djibouti town, dissolve the existing
Afar-dominated assembly and convene a

meeting of all political forces in the col
ony.
Asmallguerrilla group is already active
from Somalia, calling itself the Front for
the Liberation of the Somali Coast. Last
May they kidnaped the French ambas
sador to Somalia and released him in re
turn for two Issas imprisoned in France
for attempting to kill Aref in 1968.
The Ethiopians, on the other hand, are
allied with Aref, depend heavily on the
port of Djibouti for their trade — espe
cially when the roads to Ethiopian ports
are cut by Eritreans and Ethiopian rebels
— and cater to Afar tourists from Djib
outi. Though militarily preoccupied by
the Eritrean revolt, the Ethiopians are
likely to give Aref all the backing he
needs for fear he might ally with rebelli
ous Afars in Ethiopia and create an inde
pendent Afari state if they refuse.
Any clash between Somalia and
Ethiopia along their lengthy border
would threaten to involve both the U.S.
and the Soviets — especially given Djib
outi's strategic position at the mouth of
the Red Sea. Whether the stakes are as
high as those in Angola remains to be
seen.

ence in Djibouti to continue its aerial
surveillance operations. It thus plans to
turn the reins of power over to its hand
groomed candidate, the colony's present
premier, Ali Aref.
But Aref is an Afar, the minority tribe
by some 20,000. The French have relied
upon the Afars for local administration
since annexing the territory in 1862, rig
ging electoral rolls to give the Afars a
majority in the colonial assembly.
Garrison city
Most of the Afars live in the capital city
of Djibouti, which is surrounded by 10
miles of barbed wire and mines and
guarded by the French Foreign Legion.
The barrier was erected to keep out "un
desirables" after anti-French riots in
1966. The "undesirables" are the Issas,
dozens of whom have been killed or
maimed on the line since.
Aref himself came to power on an anti-
Issa platform, calling for continued adhe

sion to France and the expulsion of all
Issas without proper identity cards or
who voted for independence in a 1967 re
ferendum.
In 1973, in the most recent colonial as
sembly elections, Aref was accused of
bringing in extra Afar voters from
Ethiopia and preventing Issas from stand
ing for election.
Today Aref and his supporters have
changed the name of their party from
Union and Progress Within the French
Whole to the National Unity Party for
Independence, but they still call for
French economic and military presence
after independence.
Opposition
The main opposition party, the Popular
African League for Independence, is led
by Hassan Goulded (an Issa) and Ahmed
Dini (an Afar). They advocate "genuine
independence," including an end to the
French military presence. When Aref
launched his new party last December an
estimated 2000 attended his rally, while
20,000 showed up for a simultaneous
rally of the African League.
If tension erupts into violence, Somalia
and Ethiopia — already watching each
other closely for moves toward annexa

will almost surely become involved.
The Somalis still call Djibouti "French
Somaliland," its name until 1967. Their
president, Siad Barre, has written to
French President Giscard d'Estaing op
posing what he calls "fake decoloniza

its troops, take down the fence around
Djibouti town, dissolve the existing
Afar-dominated assembly and convene a

meeting of all political forces in the col

Asmallguerrilla group is already active
from Somalia, calling itself the Front for
the Liberation of the Somali Coast. Last
May they kidnaped the French ambas
sador to Somalia and released him in re
turn for two Issas imprisoned in France
for attempting to kill Aref in 1968.
The Ethiopians, on the other hand, are
allied with Aref, depend heavily on the
port of Djibouti for their trade — espe
cially when the roads to Ethiopian ports
are cut by Eritreans and Ethiopian rebels
— and cater to Afar tourists from Djib
outi. Though militarily preoccupied by
the Eritrean revolt, the Ethiopians are
likely to give Aref all the backing he
needs for fear he might ally with rebelli
ous Afars in Ethiopia and create an inde
pendent Afari state if they refuse.
Any clash between Somalia and
Ethiopia along their lengthy border
would threaten to involve both the U.S.
and the Soviets — especially given Djib

the Red Sea. Whether the stakes are as
high as those in Angola remains to be

LONDON — Somewhere in the Penta
gon and the Kremlin, dossiers on an
obscure French colony at the mouth of the
Red Sea are moving quietly to the top of
the pile. Called Djibouti, this tiny enclave
of 130,000 could be Africa's next Angola.
After a century of colonial rule, France
announced December 31 that it would
grant independence to Djibouti — for
mally called the French Territory of the
Afars and Issas. But the prospects for a
peaceful transfer of power look bad — and
conflict could easily escalate into super
power confrontation.
At root is possible civil strife between
Djibouti's two nationalities — the Afars
and the Issas — that would likely trigger
intervention by neighboring Somalia
(with a population of Issas) and Ethiopia
(which contains 200,000 nomadic Afars).
Behind Somalia stands the Soviet
Union, which trains and equips the
20,000-man Somali army and has a mis
sile facility in Berbera, on the Somali
coast. Behind Ethiopia is the U.S., sup
plying the military hardware for its war
against rebel Eritreans and using its ports
for naval purposes.

And in the middle — keeping 6000
troops in Djibouti to conduct aerial sur

Yemen for her Western allies — stands
France.
Add to this the strategic importance of
Djibouti, commanding the narrow mouth
of the Red Sea — the Suez Canal's south

for a decolonization dispute rivaling
those in the Congo, the Spanish Sahara
and now Angola.

Tension is already high. December
alone saw an assassination attempt on the

posing what he calls "fake decoloniza

its troops, take down the fence around
Djibouti town, dissolve the existing
Afar-dominated assembly and convene a

meeting of all political forces in the col
ony.
Asmallguerrilla group is already active
from Somalia, calling itself the Front for
the Liberation of the Somali Coast. Last
May they kidnaped the French ambas
sador to Somalia and released him in re
turn for two Issas imprisoned in France
for attempting to kill Aref in 1968.
The Ethiopians, on the other hand, are
allied with Aref, depend heavily on the
port of Djibouti for their trade — espe
cially when the roads to Ethiopian ports
are cut by Eritreans and Ethiopian rebels
— and cater to Afar tourists from Djib
outi. Though militarily preoccupied by
the Eritrean revolt, the Ethiopians are
likely to give Aref all the backing he
needs for fear he might ally with rebelli
ous Afars in Ethiopia and create an inde
pendent Afari state if they refuse.
Any clash between Somalia and
Ethiopia along their lengthy border
would threaten to involve both the U.S.
and the Soviets — especially given Djib

the Red Sea. Whether the stakes are as
high as those in Angola remains to be

LONDON — Somewhere in the Penta
gon and the Kremlin, dossiers on an
obscure French colony at the mouth of the
Red Sea are moving quietly to the top of
the pile. Called Djibouti, this tiny enclave
of 130,000 could be Africa's next Angola.
After a century of colonial rule, France
announced December 31 that it would
grant independence to Djibouti — for
mally called the French Territory of the
Afars and Issas. But the prospects for a
peaceful transfer of power look bad — and
conflict could easily escalate into super
power confrontation.
At root is possible civil strife between
Djibouti's two nationalities — the Afars
and the Issas — that would likely trigger
intervention by neighboring Somalia
(with a population of Issas) and Ethiopia
(which contains 200,000 nomadic Afars).
Behind Somalia stands the Soviet
Union, which trains and equips the
20,000-man Somali army and has a mis
sile facility in Berbera, on the Somali
coast. Behind Ethiopia is the U.S., sup
plying the military hardware for its war
against rebel Eritreans and using its ports
for naval purposes.
France in middle
And in the middle — keeping 6000
troops in Djibouti to conduct aerial sur
veillance of Somalia and radical South
Yemen for her Western allies — stands
France.
Add to this the strategic importance of
Djibouti, commanding the narrow mouth
of the Red Sea — the Suez Canal's south
ern gate — and all the ingredients emerge
for a decolonization dispute rivaling
those in the Congo, the Spanish Sahara
and now Angola.

Tension is already high. December
alone saw an assassination attempt on the
colony s premier, a border clash between
the French Foreign Legion and troops of
neighboring Somalia and a diplomatic
flare-up between Somalia and Ethiopia
following an attack by 1000 dem
onstrators on the Ethiopian embassy in
Somalia.
Hand-groomed candidate
1 he I* rench decision to grant Djibouti
independence — if the Afars and Issas
vote for it in a referendum — followed
pressure both from the military junta that
took over Ethiopia in 1974 and from the
U.N., which voted December 9 to ask
Prance to give up her colony.
But Paris wants to retain a military pres
ence in Djibouti to continue its aerial
surveillance operations. It thus plans to
turn the reins of power over to its hand
groomed candidate, the colony's present
premier, Ali Aref.
But Aref is an Afar, the minority tribe
by some 20,000. The French have relied
upon the Afars for local administration
since annexing the territory in 1862, rig
ging electoral rolls to give the Afars a
majority in the colonial assembly.
Garrison city
Most of the Afars live in the capital city
of Djibouti, which is surrounded by 10
miles of barbed wire and mines and
guarded by the French Foreign Legion.
The barrier was erected to keep out "un
desirables" after anti-French riots in
1966. The "undesirables" are the Issas,
dozens of whom have been killed or
maimed on the line since.
Aref himself came to power on an anti-
Issa platform, calling for continued adhe

sion to France and the expulsion of all
Issas without proper identity cards or
who voted for independence in a 1967 re
ferendum.
In 1973, in the most recent colonial as
sembly elections, Aref was accused of
bringing in extra Afar voters from
Ethiopia and preventing Issas from stand
ing for election.
Today Aref and his supporters have
changed the name of their party from
Union and Progress Within the French
Whole to the National Unity Party for
Independence, but they still call for
French economic and military presence
after independence.
Opposition
The main opposition party, the Popular
African League for Independence, is led
by Hassan Goulded (an Issa) and Ahmed
Dini (an Afar). They advocate "genuine
independence," including an end to the
French military presence. When Aref
launched his new party last December an
estimated 2000 attended his rally, while
20,000 showed up for a simultaneous
rally of the African League.
If tension erupts into violence, Somalia
and Ethiopia — already watching each
other closely for moves toward annexa
tion of Djibouti after the French depart —
will almost surely become involved.
The Somalis still call Djibouti "French
Somaliland," its name until 1967. Their
president, Siad Barre, has written to
French President Giscard d'Estaing op

its troops, take down the fence around
