# Energy 'crisis' will fizzle out by 2000, SRI scientist says

There may be marked amelio
ration of the present world
energy-shortage "crisis," ac
cording to John I'. Henry, direc
tor for the Stanford Research In
stitute (SRI) Center for Energy
Economics.
In a March 31 presentation to
the Third Energy Conference in
Washington, D.C., Henry said
that although the world energy
consumption rate will have
nearly doubled by the year 2000,
there will be an excess of "pro

ducible energy" available to
meet such demands.
Furthermore, persistently
high oil prices have dampened
world energy usage consider
ably, he said. SRI researchers re
calculated 1973 estimates for
U.S. energy consumption by the
turn of the century to be 70 mil
lion barrels of oil-equivalent per
day, down 20 percent from orig
inal predictions, Henry re
ported,
The world energy demand, al

though also economically re
stricted, will continue its 4.5
percent annual increase trend,
he added.
The world's growing energy
demand will be offset by the de
velopment of alternative
energy-producing technology
such as the use of solar, nuclear
and fossil fuels, Henry said.
In fact, SRI expects nuclear
energy to comprise 20 percent of
the total world energy consump
tion by the end of the century,
despite its current socio
political complications.
Such widespread usage of
nuclear power is especially
economically favorable for small
countries with minimal natural
fuel reserves, said Henry.
He noted, however, that pe
troleum will continue to be the
most used form of energy pro
duction at that time, with 70 per
cent of the world's oil reserves
still remaining.
Africa, the Soviet Union and
communist Asia will become
the principal world supplies of
oil while the Middle East will be
demand-limited by a lower qual
ity, high-sulfur content crude oil
product, he commented.
Henry said he feels that the
"energy crisis" may in fact have
initially been an economic ploy
to boost petroleum price levels.
The current demand decrease,
coupled with time/cost consid
erations of alternative techno
logy research and development,
will stabilize oil prices by the
1980 s, he predicted.
