# Minority enrollment steady despite aid cuts

The introduction of self-help
into the financial aid packages
for black, chicano and native
American students did not have
a significantly adverse effect on
the minority groups' fall enroll
ment, according to a report pre
sented to the Academic Senate.
The report, from the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aids (C
-UAFA) and presented by Dean of
Admissions Fred Hargadon and
Assoc. English Prof. William
Chace, detailed the effects of the
altered financial aid packages on
minority freshman enrollment.
"Even with the introduction of
some portion of self-help, the
quality of the (University's) fi

nancial aid awards to blacks,
chicanos and native Americans
would continue to be considera
bly better than the awards they
might expect from most, if not
all, other institutions," the re
port states.
C-UAFA found evidence to
"suggest that all such (minoi 'y)
students who, in the past, 1 id
turned down Stanford in favor of
another institution often did -;o
despite having received qualita
tively poorer aid awards where

they enrolled."
In a study of 35 minority stu
dents who declined admission
here to attend Harvard,
Radcliffe, Yale and Princeton,
the committee found that in 28 of
the cases, the actual cost of en
rolling here was less, "and in
many cases substantially less,"
than the cost of attending the
other institutions.
"Despite propaganda to the
contrary, first-rate minority stu

dents (and their families) seek a
first-rate education no less, and
perhaps even more, than their
non-minority peers (and their
families) and are obviously wil
ling to make sacrifices to obtain
one."
The C-UAFA report did not
concern itself with the possible
effect on self-help on academic
performance here, an area of
study outside the committee's
charge.
