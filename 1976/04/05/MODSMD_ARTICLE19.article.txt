# School plans 3 'R's program

PHILADELPHIA (AP) —Thecityschool district
has an elementary school in the works that de
mands daily homework and strict discipline,
stresses the three "R"s and discourages wearing
sneakers and jeans.
It would cost $657,000 a year to operate the
school, which would be a separate facility, but
Doris Oberhaltzer, the school board vice presi
dent, is wondering why it has to cost anything at
all.
"What is it going to cost to say children have to
come to school properly attired and teachers have
to make students do homework?" Oberhaltzer
asks. "I can't imagine why we're implementing it
in only one school."
The school, which will begin next September if
it gets school board approval, would house 470

students in kindergarten through grade six. En
rollment would be voluntary and students who
misbehave would be kicked out.
The back-to-basics philosophy calls for:
—Students passing minimum requirement
examinations before passing into the next grade.
—A dress code of trousers and shirts with Col
lars for boys: blouses, skirts, slacks or dresses for
girls. Jeans and sneakers would be discouraged
because "play clothes . . . result in play at
titudes."
—Emphasis on mathematics drills, reading
with stress on phonics, daily homework, letter
grades and numerous parent conferences.
—Report cards six times a year instead of the
district's usual three.
