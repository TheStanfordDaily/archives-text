# Nuclear Initiative provisions meet industry opposition

The latest bouts in the Nuclear Safeguards Initiative
fight have crowded the headlines in recent weeks
while public concern over the measure, the nation's
first referendum aimed at regulating the development
of nuclear power plants, has spread rapidly in the state
and across the country.
Designated as Proposition 15, the initiative is not a
moratorium on nuclear reactors, as some opponents
have charged. It could, however, severely curtail de
velopment and operation of reactors and result in a
gradual phaseout of nuclear power, if its provisions are
not met.
The two main provisions are:
—The nuclear industry must prove that its safety
systems and waste disposal methods are adequate to
the satisfaction of two thirds of the state legislature.
—Limits on the nuclear industry's liability for reac
tor accidents, now set by a federal lawat $560,000.mu5t
be waived or removed and the public must be guaran
teed full compensation for any nuclear accident.
'Nuclear shutdown'?
Opponents have labeled the measure "The Nuclear
Shutdown Initiative," insisting that its requirements
cannot be met, but supporters stress that the measure is
intended only to insure safeguards.
Craig Ritchy, a Palo Alto attorney and volunteer at
National Resources Defense Council, an environmental
law firm, said Proposition 15 is "a set of very reasona
ble safety measures which, given the risks, one would
think would have been required long ago."
Terry Trumbull, attorney for General Electric's nuc
lear division in Sunnyvale, disagreed, calling the in
itiative's provisions "unreasonable" and "impossible
for any form of electricity generation to comply with."
Passage of Proposition 15, he said, would mean a
shut-down of nuclear power in the state.
California now has three operating nuclear power
plants, one of which is in Sacramento. Together they
contribute only four percent of the state's generating
capacity.
Hut if utilities proceed with their current plans, 10 to
12 more plants, housing a total of 30 nuclear generating

units, will be built in the next 20 years, said Fritz
Draeger, public information officer for Pacific Gas and
Electric Co. (PG&E).
"According to the projections of the California
utilities, by 1995 nuclear energy could be furnishing
one half of the state's electricity needs," Draeger re
ported.
The California initiative will have reverberations far
beyond the state boundaries. At least a dozen other
states are considering similar measures, and all are
watching California as a sign of where the public
stands.
"If the California initiative passes it will give a great
boost to the chances of the one in Oregon, being voted
on in November, as well as to similar initiatives being
started or voted on across the country," said Nikki Parr,
a housewife who spends several hours a week cam
paigning for Proposition 15.
Parr, like most of the supporters of the initiative in
this area, is a member of Project Survival, a Palo Alto
based group that has been a prime force in the
statewide pro-initiative campaign.
Storage problem
Supporters of the initiative argue that nuclear po\#er
plants have not yet been proven safe, that there is now
no known method of storing radioactive wastes for the
thousands of years they remain toxic and that the
utilities have overestimated U.S. energy needs.
Opposition to the initiative comes mostly from
utilities, such as PC.&E, reactor manufacturers, such as
General Electric, and other energy companies. One of
the few groups of private citizens opposing the initia
tive is Scientists for the Enlightenment of Nuclear
Sources of Energy (SENSE), made up of Stanford scien
tists and engineers.
Those who oppose Proposition 15 maintain that
without nuclear power the country will face a crippling
energy shortage and that the chances of a nuclear acci
dent are minimal.
But in the case of a major reactor accident, massive
amounts of radiation could be released which could
result in "tens of thousands of deaths from radiation
sickness and thousands more from radiation-induced
