# U.S. divorce rate tops one million
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AF) — More than a mill
ion couples in the United States were di
vorced last year, the highest number in
American history, a new government study
shows. During the same period, the number
of marriages dropped to the lowest level
since 1969.
The report, a profile of the economic and
social conditions of the American people
during 1975, was released Thursday by the
Census Bureau. It shows that the number of
divorces increased by six percent to
1,026,000 between 1974 and 1975, while
the number of marriages decreased by four
percent to 2.1 million.
The profile also shows:
—By 1976, the total U.S. population
reached 214.5 million, an increase of less
than one percent over the previous year.
—The number of households with a
female head increased by 30 percent be
tween 1970 and 1975.
—During the same period, the number of
persons under age 35 maintaining a house
hold entirely alone doubled from 1.5 mill
ion to 3 million.
—Wives under age 25 showed a strong
preference for having two children.

—Average income in 1974 was $12,840 —
four percent lower than in 1973 when ad
justed for inflation.
The report shows that the population rose
by about 1.7 million people during 1975, an
increase of less than one percent. However,
it was slightly higher than in the previous
three years.
The report shows that although it will be
many years before the country reaches zero
population growth, the current fertility rate
of 1.8 is well below the 2.1 level required for
natural replacement of the population.
The total fertility rate is the average
number of births per woman according to
the current rate of child bearing.
The government figures show that in
1975 there were 2.5 million men and four
million women in the United States who
were currently divorced or who had not re
married by the time the survey was taken.
Two million ofthese people had divorced in
1975 alone, bringing the divorce rate t04.8,
which means that 4.8 out of every 1000
people were divorced.
The census material on family size shows
that younger married women prefer smaller

families than do older ones.
The report shows that 60 percent of mar
ried women aged 18 to 24 expect to have
only two children per woman. The average
for women ages 35 to 39 is 3.1.
In terms of where people choose to live,
the report shows that the growth rate of
large metropolitan areas has fallen below
that of smaller, more rural areas of the coun
try.
Also, the South and West, which each
grew more than eight percent over the last
five years, have both expanded more than
the North, which has lost population. The
most rapid growth has occured in the moun
tain states, which have grown by 16.3 per
cent in the same period of time.
College enrollment among people in their
late 20s and early 30s continued to increase
during 1975. Since 1970, the number of
people between the ages of 25 and 29 enrol
led in college rose by 72 percent — and by
108 percent for those aged 30 to 34.
The government figures show that more
than 92 million people were in the labor
force in 1975,10 million more than in 1970.
The labor force includes both people with
jobs and those seeking jobs.

families than do older ones.

ried women aged 18 to 24 expect to have
only two children per woman. The average
for women ages 35 to 39 is 3.1.
In terms of where people choose to live,
the report shows that the growth rate of
large metropolitan areas has fallen below
that of smaller, more rural areas of the coun
try.
Also, the South and West, which each
grew more than eight percent over the last
five years, have both expanded more than
the North, which has lost population. The
most rapid growth has occured in the moun
tain states, which have grown by 16.3 per
cent in the same period of time.
College enrollment among people in their

WASHINGTON (AF) — More than a mill
ion couples in the United States were di
vorced last year, the highest number in
American history, a new government study
shows. During the same period, the number
of marriages dropped to the lowest level
since 1969.
The report, a profile of the economic and
social conditions of the American people
during 1975, was released Thursday by the
Census Bureau. It shows that the number of
divorces increased by six percent to
1,026,000 between 1974 and 1975, while
the number of marriages decreased by four
percent to 2.1 million.
The profile also shows:
—By 1976, the total U.S. population
reached 214.5 million, an increase of less
than one percent over the previous year.
—The number of households with a
female head increased by 30 percent be
tween 1970 and 1975.
—During the same period, the number of
persons under age 35 maintaining a house
hold entirely alone doubled from 1.5 mill
ion to 3 million.
—Wives under age 25 showed a strong
preference for having two children.

—Average income in 1974 was $12,840 —
four percent lower than in 1973 when ad
justed for inflation.
The report shows that the population rose
by about 1.7 million people during 1975, an
increase of less than one percent. However,
it was slightly higher than in the previous
three years.
The report shows that although it will be
many years before the country reaches zero
population growth, the current fertility rate
of 1.8 is well below the 2.1 level required for
natural replacement of the population.
The total fertility rate is the average
number of births per woman according to
the current rate of child bearing.
The government figures show that in
1975 there were 2.5 million men and four
million women in the United States who
were currently divorced or who had not re
married by the time the survey was taken.
Two million ofthese people had divorced in
1975 alone, bringing the divorce rate t04.8,
which means that 4.8 out of every 1000
people were divorced.
