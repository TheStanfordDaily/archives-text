## Marcy wins third NCAA crown 
### George Anders 
By George Anders

For the third year in a row,
Stanford gymnast Ted Marcy
has taken first place in the
NCAA pommel horse com
petition.
Marcy had a composite
score of 19.325 out of a possi
ble 20 in the weekend meet
held at Temple University in
Philadelphia. His score was
the highest for any event.
During the preliminary
competition on Friday, Marcy
recalled, "There were six
people performing at once.
But when 1 went up, they
stopped the other five. It was
quite an honor. I was touched,
to say the least."
Marcy scored 9.H on the
compulsory section of the
preliminaries and 9.75 on the
optional section for a pre
liminary average of 9.775.
He went on to score 9.55 in
the finals, to achieve the final
score.
"1 thought my pre
liminaries were better than

last year," Marcy said. "On
the finals, though, 1 rushed
my dismount a bit, which
caused me to break form.
"1 really can't complain,
though," he added. "It would
have been a fairy tale to ex
pect my last routine to be my
best one."
Marcy said that, except for
a minor meet later this month
at Pasadena, he is finished
with gymnastics.
"I'm going to be much too
busy next year," at medical
school, he explained. "Gym
nastics is a sport you 're either
in or out. And I know I'll
never be able to do the
sidehorse as well as I do now,
unless 1 put even more time
into it. If not, I'd just be frus
trated at not doing as well as I
used to."
Last week, Marcy was
nominated for the Nissen
Award, given to the top male
collegiate gymnast in the
country.
