# Golfers can't match San Jose State
## 
### Chris Kamel 
A young Stanford men's golf
team could not withstand a
strong San Jose State squad as
the Spartans beat the Cards,
18-9, in a match at the Stanford
golf course Friday.
With three sophomores and
one freshman on the six man
team, Stanford could only take
two match victories. Stanford
was paced by rounds of 72 by
both Glenn Goethals and Mike
Peck. Goethals took a 2-1 match
win over Spartan Scott Little,
while Peck's match-up with Don
Levine ended up in a 2V2-V2 win
by the Stanford sophomore.
San Jose's victory still gave the
Cards a 3-2 edge in their encoun
ters, but both Stanford losses
have come in match play.
"All our victories against San
Jose State have come in tourna
ments," said coach Bud Finger.
"In fact, if this had been a tour
nament we would have tied at
294."

According to Finger, San Jose
State does have a couple of fine
players in Scott Hoyt and Don
Thames. Hoyt was declared
Amateur of the Year by the
Northern California Golf Associ
ation last season.
Hoyt and Thames more than
offset the play of Feck and
Goethals as they took 3-0 match
wins over Ray Navis, 77, and Jay
Johnston, 73.
Finger took nothing away
from Navis, however. According
to the head coach, Navis is a
hard-nosed player who ought to
provide a lot for the Cards.
Stanford hosts Hawaii Wed
nesday. Finger has not seen
Hawaii play, but he said it has a
couple of good junior college
golfers from the Stanford area.
"Right now, we just have a
problem getting the ball into the
hole," he said. "If we just im
prove on our putting and chip
ping games, the wins will fol
low."
