# Cards, SC trade baseball routs
## 
### Chris Baker 
"My God," said one observer
at the third and final game of the
Stanford-USC baseball series
Saturday night at the Trojans'
Deadeaux Field, "all three
games have been routs."
The Cards lost the opening
game of the California Intercol
legiate Baseball Association
(CIBA) series Friday night, 10-1,
and lost the first game of Satur
day's day-night double header
by an equally horrendous 9-1
margin. But they came back to
take the nightcap, 8-0, behind
Brian Harrison's one hitter.
The loss dropped the Trojans,
now 6-3 in the conference, into
second place a half-game behind
UCLA, which swept a double
header from UC-Santa Barbara
over the weekend. The Bruins
have an 8-4 league mark.
Changed attitude
"We got away from the field
between games," said Stanford
coach Ray Young. "We didn't
take batting practice and we
came back with a totally diffe
rent attitude.
"We had to get off the spot,"
Young added, "I think we had
lost five games in this thing,"
Young said, referring to the road
uniform he was peeling off.
Harrison, who was bombed in
the finals of the Riverside tour
nament by second-ranked
Arizona State, 13-0, allowed the
Trojans only one hit, a 4hird
inning single by Rob Hertel, and
struck out 10. The game was
called after eight innings be
cause of rain.
Young played some mind
games with the freshman
pitcher's head this past week. In
stead of taking him out in the
championship game at River
side, he left him in to get at
tacked by the powerful Sun
Devils.
And Tuesday, intheCards'B-2
win over Hayward State, he used
the freshman in relief. "Brian
did a hell of a job tonight," said
Young. "The experiment of leav
ing him in against Arizona State
and using him in relief paid off.
'Strongest arm'
"There's no question that he
has the strongest arm on the
team. He's got to be our stopper,"
added Young.
And stop the Trojans is what
Harrison did. After being given a
3-0 lead in the first inning, the
freshman thwarted the Trojans
with one of the best curves this
side of the fast lane of the
Pasadena Freeway. He was never
really in trouble.
The Cardhitters, led by Randy
Wong, got 10 hits to back him
up. Wong drove in five runs with
a home run and a single.

"We came out and played our
type of game from the start," said
Young. "Although we didn't
have any stolen bases we played
aggressively. We just had to get
off that five game thing."
Cards lose first game
In the first game of the twin
bill. Saturday afternoon, Trojan
left-hander Charlie Phillips
pitched a six-hitter and issued
just one walk to earn his seventh
victory.
Card starter Bruce Fiala gave
up three runs in the first inning
and two in thethird.and the Tro
jans didn't need any more gifts.
On Friday evening, Stanford
starter John Yandle lasted only
four innings, giving up three
runs. USC freshman designated
hitter Chris Smith drove in three
runs and junior left
fielder Tom Ricks had tliree hits
and two RBI s to lead USC to a
10-1 series opening win.
Young said the Cards, now 2-4
in the CIBA, are anything but out
of the league race. "1 don't think
we're out of the race. We had
some injuries; Larry Reynolds
may have tendonitis and he can't
throw; Mike Codiroli has a
pulled hamstring muscle and on
Friday Bruce Walters was in
jured," said Young.
"Those are some pretty good
people. Until tonight it just
seemed like everything was slid
ing down.
Strict rotation
"And we looked at Yandle as
our stopper and he isn't." Young
said he will have a strict rotation
from here on.
"We'll go with Irwin on Tues
day, Yandle on Wednesday and
Fiala and Irwin this weekend."
He'll use Harrison as his stopper.
Harrison said that after pitch
ing against Arizona State "my
confidence has been a lot better. 1
really don't think I'm doing a
whole lot physically different,
it's just mental.
"Being a freshman I didn't
know too much about it but I
know that there's a big SC
rivalry," Harrison added.
Over in the USC dressing
room, Trojan coach Rod
Deadeaux, who has won the
Pacific-8 Southern Division title
for the last six years, finds him
self in the unusual position of
being in second place.
