## Bruins smash netters 
### Paul Bauman 
I-OS ANGELES — The top two
college tennis teams in the coun
try, UCLA and Stanford, met
here Friday, and the event re
ceived about as much attention
as a smog alert.
Only 1 B.'J7 fans witnessed the
first college matches ever played
in Pauley Pavilion Friday night.
The outdoor matches, played
that afternoon, drew about 15')
people. True, UCLA is on its
spring break, but would that stop
its students, 105 percent of
whom live in Los Angeles, from
attending a Bruin basketball
game?
UCLA beat the Cards easily,
8-1, and the Los Angeles Times
donated a whole four inches, in
cluding the boxscore, on page
five of its sports section story.
The Santa Monica Evening Out
look ran only a boxscore in a
type size nobody over the age of
:H) could possibly read.
It's ironic that UCLA basket
ball gets so much more recogni
tion than tennis because the lat
ter team is better. The defending
NCAA champion Bruin netters
are 14-U this season and have
won straight dual matches.
One-two punch
UCLA has the top two
amateurs in the U.S., A11 -
American Brian Teacher and
All-American-to-be Peter Flem
ing. With Ail-American Ferdi
Taygan and former All-
American Steve Mott, who can't
even break into the Bruins' start
ing singles lineup, UCLA would
be a great entry for World Team
Tennis.
It's probably just as well for
Stanford that the match was
under-publicized. The Cards
didn't accomplish a heck of a lot.
The dual match was over even
before the teams moved indoors
as UCLA defeated Stanford five
times out of six outdoors.
Freshman John Rust, playing
at fifth singles, registered Stan
ford's only win when he de
feated 6-foot-4 John Austin after
losing the first set, 6-2. The final
score was 2-6, 6-1, 6-2.
Exploits weakness
Explaining his comeback, Rast
said, "He (Austin) started over-

hitting the ball every time. I tried
moving him around. He's so big
— he doesn't move around too
well.
"I was staying back. I didn't
come to the net at all. I was let
ting him put the pressure on and
he lost his patience."
Stanford's Mark Mitchell
found himself in a similar match
at fourth singles against Bruce
Nichols, but the result was dif
ferent. Mitchell lost the first set
6-1, but then "changed the pace"
of the match by staying back on
his serve, anil took the second
set, 6-1. Nichols regained con
trol again in the deciding set
with a consistent first serve and
shut Mitchell out 6-0 to win the
match.
Near upset
In what seemed to be an im
portant match at the time, Matt
Mitchell nearly upset Taygan,
but eventually lost 6-7, 6-4, 6-2.
Had Mitchell won, Stanford and
UCI.A would have been tied at
two matches apiece. As it was,
the Bruins went up 3-1.
The Cards did no better in the
two outdoor doubles matches.
After the Mitchell-Mitchell and
Gene Mayer-Ferry Wright teams
both lost in straight sets, UCLA
had an insurmountable 5-1 mar
gin.
Stanford coach Dick Could
said the key to the Cards' losses
were the three-all points. (The
matches were played under a
no-add system, with the fourth
point deciding the game.) UCLA
won 31 of 40 three-all points to
win games outdoors.
Empty seats
The matches in Pauley failed
to come off as well as they could
have. Maybe it was that the out
come had already been decided.
Or maybe it was the abundance
of empty seats. As exciting as
Pauley is with a full house, it's
equally depressing with nobody
there.
UCLA showed off its new
prize, Fleming, in the No. 1 sing
les and doubles matches. The 6-5
junior transfer from Michigan
plays at the top of the Bruin lad
der although he is ranked just
behind Teacher nationally. The
addition of Fleming, who has al-

ready told UCLA coach Glenn
Bassett that he will turn pro after
this season, has-compensated for
the loss of NCAA singles cham
pion Billy Martin to the pros.
Fleming breezed past Bill
"Willie" Maze in No. 1 singles,
6-3, 6-4, combining a great
return-of-serve, amazing re
flexes and a serve that turns the
ball into a projectile.
Looking back on all of the
day's matches, Could said, "I'm
disappointed we lost, but 1 don't
think we played badly. We can
play better. We'll have to to beat
a team like this."
