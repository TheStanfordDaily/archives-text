Swimmers slip
After peaking at the NCAA
Championships Mar. 25-29 and
the Association for Intercol
legiate Athletics for Women
(AIAW) Championships Mar.
18-20, Stanford men and women
swimmers found last weekend's
AAU Indoor Long Course
Swimming Championships to be
a psychological letdown.
Stanford breaststroker Stuart
Corliss remarked, "It's just like
any other sport. You aim for that
'big one' one week and do well,
and then the next week do
poorly when you're not sup
posed to."
The swimmers also had to
compete in a long course (50-
yard) pool, instead of the short
course (25-yard) type of pool
used for most college swim
ming.
The AAU bong Course
Championships are usually held
in the summer, but this year's
meet was moved up to April as a
qualifying meet for the Olympic
Trials.
The abrupt change in swim
ming habits was especially
noticeable to Stanford's John
Mencken. Mencken, a 1972
Olympic gold medalist in the
200 meter breaststroke and
world record holder in both the
100 and 200 breast, was beaten
twice by Britain's David Wilkie.
Just one week earlier at the
NCAAs in Providence, R. 1., Wil
kie upset Hencken by taking a
first in the 200 breast. At the
AAIJ meet Wilkie made it a clean
sweep by defeating a tired and
sunburned Mencken in both the
100 and 200 breast.
Mike Bruner, who swam for
the Cards last year but is taking
this school year off to train for
the Olympics, won the 200 but
terfly.
Vicki Mays placed the highest
among Stanford women, qual
ifying as an Olympic alternate in
the 200 breast.

Bruins seek hardship?
UCLA basketball coach Gene
Bartow believes two of his star
players may be considering
seeking eligibility for the pro
draft as hardship cases, the Los
Angeles Times reported yester
day.
Junior forwards Marques

Johnson and Richard
Washington, according to the
Times, have been rumored to be
seeking hardship status.
But, the Times noted, Sam
Gilbert, who has been close to
UCLA players for years, said that
Johnson and Washington have
not yet signed letters of intent as
hardship cases.
"Marques and Richard are
very knowledgeable young men,
and they've been listening to pro
general managers," Gilbert was
quoted as saying. "But at this
point, they haven't made any de
cision as to what they'll do. And
I don't want to influence them."
