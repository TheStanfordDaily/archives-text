# Sandoval sets track record

LOS ANGELES — Diminutive
Stanford distance man Tony
Sandoval was in a class by him
self Saturday afternoon at UC
LA's Drake Track Stadium, run
ning away from the field to win
the 5000-meter run in a meet
record time of 13:53.2.
But if Sandy was in another
class, USC was in another world.
The Trojans, who only hours be
fore had returned from a week
long trip to Hawaii, scored 105
points to win their fifth meet of
the year and their 40th straight
over the Robber Barons, 105-35.
In the other half of the
double-dual track meet, UCLA,
which had not held a full team
workout for over three weeks,
looked a bit woozy, but still had
enough to score its 40th straight
dual meet victory, a 79-65 win
over California.
Separate heats
UCLA Athletic Director J.D.
Morgan tried to avoid any direct
competition between the Tro
jans and Bruins, the nation's top
two dual meet track powers in
the country, by running the
events in each meet in separate
heats. But the sporting media
still used the meet to see who'll
win the May 1 showdown be
tween UCLA and USC in
Westwood.
And based on the results of
Saturday's meet, the Trojans
should capture their first dual
meet win over the Bruins since
1971. If the two teams had been
competing against each other
this weekend, USC would have
scored a 75V2-CIHV2 win.
But that doesn't mean a thing.
The Trojans' top sprinter
James Gilkes didn't run either
sprint. Neither USC's Ken Rail
die nor UCLA's Bennis Myles
ran the 400-meters.
Jet lag
And USC stepped off the plane
from Hawaii at 9 a.m. Saturday.
"USC was really tired today,"
said a worried UCLA track coach
Jim Bush. "Hell, they just got
back from Hawaii this morning
and look what they're doing to
Stanford. But if they can perform
like that with no rest . . ."
For Stanford, the double dual
offered a chance for some to im
prove their marks against some
of the top track men in the coun

try. And a host of Barons equal
led or set new season's bests.
As has been the case all sea
son. sophomore James Lofton
was Stanford's iron man, win
ning the long jump, the Barons'
only other winning mark, com
peting in the 200 and anchoring
the mile relay squad.
Stanford's biggest moment
But Stanford's biggest mo
ment. 011 a cold windy day that
the Trojans made even colder,
came in the 5000-meter run.
"I think Sandoval's perfor
mance has to be the performance
of the day for Stanford," Jordan
said.
The 5-foot-H senior lung bus
ter had to pace himself on the
windy back straightaway, leav
ing the crowded field — the
5000-meter run was the only
combined event of the meet —
almost a league behind. But
Sandoval had enough self
discipline to pace himself and
break teammate Jack Bellah's
meet record time of 13:56.4 set
last year.
"It was one of my better
races," Sandoval said. "It's too
bad I didn't have someone be
hind ITU 1 a few more laps."
Most track buffs use the long
race as a chance to make a trip to
the restrooms, but few left dur
ing Sandy's performance.
Montreal trip
Sandoval, who has already
qualified for the U.S. Olympic
team trials in the marathon, said
that making the trip to Montreal
is his biggest goal.
Although the Barons took only
two scoring events, there were
other good performances turned
in for the red and white.
Stacy Geiken won the steep
lechase (a non-scoring event)
and appeared on the front page
of the Los Angeles Times.
Geiken splashed to a win in
9:16.8. Teammate Jerry Emory
finished third with a season best
9:41.0.
Sprinter Marvin Holmes had a
busy day, losing the 100-meter
dash to USC's Randle by a lean,
taking third place in the 200-
meter dash in 21.3, a tenth of a
second faster than his previous
best this year, and running the
opening leg for the Card 400-
meter relay squad, which turned
in its best mark of the season, a
40.6.
In the 1500-meter run, junior
Jeff Parietti apparently had his
own event locked up when the
Trojans Gregg Beaton caught
him. Parietti still ran a season
best of 3:52.6 to finish second.
