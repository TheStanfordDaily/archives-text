# Prof upset over circulation of memo
## 
### Geoffrey Samuels 
Asst. Industrial Engineering Prof.
Douglas Daetz has discovered copies
of a memo questioning University te
nure policy that he sent to Vice Provost
for Faculty Affairs Arthur Bienenstock
in his departmental personnel file,
along with the indications that the
memo was forwarded without his
knowledge to top administrators.
In remarks before Friday's meeting
of the Academic Council, Daetz re
vealed that he found in his file the orig
inal copy of the memo he sent
Bienenstock and a blind carbon copy
of Bienenstock's response.
Daetz's memo* questioned the
criteria for tenure decisions and the
conflict those criteria created for fa
culty members active in student af
fairs.
"I was commenting," he said in a
telephone interview, "on the fact that
scholarship was so narrowly defined
as publication."
No carbons sent
Daetz, who was recently denied te
nure, said that he had sent no carbon
copies with his memo and had re
ceived no indication from the vice

provost's reply that carbon copies had
been distributed.
Through examination of the memo
copies in his file, Daetz said he learned
that Bienenstock had sent blind carbon
copies to President Richard Lyman,
Provost William Miller, then-Chair
man of the Committee on the Profes
soriate Colin Pittendrigh and En
gineering School Dean William Kays.
"My dean forwarded it,"he said, "if
I can tell by the names of the faculty
scribbled on the copy, to my depart
ment chairman. My department
chairman forwarded it to all the senior
members of my department."
Criticism
Daetz criticized Bienenstock's ac
tion, saying, "If every time someone
opens their mouth about a campus is
sue, there are blind carbon copies cir
culated by administrators, then cer
tainly this is going to discourage de
bate."
Bienenstock said later that, although
he could not recall, "it did seem
likely" that he attached Daetz's memo
to his response, which he forwarded to
the administrators Daetz named.
He noted that Daetz's memo "raised

very substantial questions about the
criteria which this institution was
using for tenure decisions."
Bienenstock said that his response
to Daetz's memo was of a potentially
controversial nature.
"It was not apparent that the ad
ministration or any of its members had
spoken out very directly on those
criteria," he said, adding he had to
forward his reply to those members of
the administration "who would have
to face the noise" if it became public.
In a telephone interview,

Bienenstock added that it was due to
the "very frank" nature of his reply
that he had to send his response to
other administrators.
"If Daetz had marked his memoran
dum confidential or personal, it
would have rested in my office,"
Bienenstock said.
He said that he decided not to inform
Daetz of his contact with other ad
ministrators because "I didn't want to
intimidate him by putting the names of
all the other people on my reply."
