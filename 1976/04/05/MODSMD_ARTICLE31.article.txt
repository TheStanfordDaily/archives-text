became the international spokesman tor the Khmer Rouge
insurgents. They restored him to figurehead leadership

supplanted him during his five-year exile in Peking.

factions of the splintered Lebanese army in the rocky hills
east of Beirut yesterday despite the latest truce, while
politicians bickered over ways to end the civil war.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat issued an appeal for
President Suleiman Franjieh, a Christian, to comply with
leftist Moslem demands to resign.

S.F. strike negotiations continue
SAN FRANCISCO — Marathon negotiations resumed
yesterday in hopes of hammering out an agreement end
ing San Francisco's five-day city strike and getting cable
cars and buses rolling again.
The first face-to-face negotiations in the pay disputes
lasted nine hours Saturday with former mayor George
Christopher serving as a neutral witness.
Labor leaders and city negotiator Patrick Mahler cau
cused separately yesterday at a downtown hotel before
sitting down together again at 11 a.m.
A supervisor, who asked not to be quoted by name,
predicted the walkout "will last for days, because we're so
far apart on the [jay issues."
Kissinger resignation rumored
SAN )OSE — Rogers Morton, President Ford's cam
paign manager, has told a group of Republicans privately
that he did not expect Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
to stay in office "beyond this year," participants in the
meeting said yesterday.

A month ago Kissinger said that if he became a political
liability and threatened President Ford's effectiveness
there would be "no problem" to his resigning his Cabinet
post.
Reagan has made Kissinger's foreign policy a campaign
issue.
Morton aide Larry Peck said Morton expressed only his
personal opinion. Peck said he made a tape recording of
the meeting and quoted Morton as saying:
"He (Kissinger) realizes that any secretary of state who
has been in as long as that has enough scars to worry
about. I'm sure Mr. Kissinger is getting toward the end of a
long political career. It would be bad politics to throw him
out bodily. But I would anticipate — and I'm sure I'm right
on this — that he would not go on beyond this year."
Wisconsin, N.Y. primaries next
NFW YORK — Rep. Morris Udall, facing primaries cru
cial to his presidential hopes, flatly predicted yesterday
that he would win in Wisconsin and run a strong race in
New York.
The New York and Wisconsin primaries are especially
crucial to Udall and Sen. Henry Jackson of Washington,
who are trying to break Jimmy Carter's string of five wins
in the first six contests for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
There is little interest in the Republican contest in New
York, which President Ford is expected to dominate.
Meanwhile yesterday Ronald Reagan won the over
whelming endorsement of the California Republican As
sembly.
Police, leftists clash in Madrid
MADRID, Spain — Police battered leftist demonstrators
with rifle butts, tear gas and rubber bullets in a bloody,
two-hour clash in Barcelona yesterday and arrested more
than 200 persons in Madrid in a crackdown on growing
unrest against Spain's new government.
The police swoop in Madrid appeared centred on fi
gures of a new opposition front that has called for a vote
on Spain's form of government and for a provisional gov
ernment to serve in the meantime.
