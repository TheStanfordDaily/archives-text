# Mandel's visa status remains unresolved
## 
### 
The ASSU Guest Professorship
Board has not yet received notice
whether Belgian Marxist economist
Ernest Mandel has been granted a visa
by the U.S. government, board
member Blythe Mickelson said yester
day.
The board had been expecting a
telegram from Mandel last weekend
but did not receive it.
Mandel must arrive within the next
few days if he is to teach his two five
unit courses, Mickelson said.

"If he arrives by next week it's defi
nitely all right for our purposes," said
Mickelson.
According to Mickelson, the board
is discussing other contingency plans
if Mandel should arrive later than next
week.
"However, we would have to go
back to the (ASSU) Senate with those
plans," said Mickelson.
If people can suggest auspices other
than the board for bringing Mandel
here, they should get in touch with the
board, Mickelson said.
