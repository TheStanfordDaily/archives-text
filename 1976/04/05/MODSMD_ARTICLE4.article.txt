The industry shifted into second

400,QU0 drivers and warehousemen
represented by the union.
But effects of the three-day strike

auto manufacturing industry.
Terms of the strike-ending contract
were worked out with the help of Sec

and Aerospace Workers Union and the
Truck Operators League, which repre
sents the employers.
Negotiators were reported to be
close to a settlement.
Teamsters were ordered back to
work after their three-day, nationwide
strike ended Saturday, but they were
also told to respect machinists' picket
lines.
Between 1200 and 1400 mechanics
have been on strike in the 11 Western
states since their master contract ex
pired at midnight Wednesday.
The settlement was reached Satur

largest trucking group involved in the
negotiations, agreed to terms which
union sources said were "almost iden
tical" to those agreed upon F>iday by
two smaller employer bargaining
groups, the Motor Carriers Labor Ad
visory Council and Irregular Route
Carriers.
General Motors Corp. said Sunday it

coach assembly operations in Pontiac,
Mich., closed today, due to a shor
tage of parts caused by the strike. The

closed Friday.
