# Sonnenfeldt on Soviet relations
## U.S. goal: 'a web of relationships' 
### Marc Strassman 
Present U.S. foreign policy seeks to
restrain disruptive international be
havior on the part of the Soviet Union
by drawing the Soviets into a "web of
relationships" that will make them
dependent upon the West for impor
tant items, such as grain and sophisti
cated technology, according to Helmut
Sonnenfeldt, counselor in the U.S.
State Department.
The purpose of this policy is to dis
courage behavior disruptive of the
world balance of power by the Soviets
by being able to threaten withdrawal of
these benefits. By disruptive interna
tional behavior, Sonnenfeldt was re
ferring to such recent activities as the
Soviet support of the Cuban forces
fighting on the side of the MPLA in
Angola.
Sonnenfeldt explained and de
fended American foreign policy to
ward the Soviet Union before an au
dience of 150 persons in the Forum
Room at Meyer Library Friday night.
Sonnenfeldt explained that the pur
suit of America's primary foreign pol
icy goals, avoiding a nuclear war of
"devastating consequences" while at
the same time maintaining a stable ba
lance of power among the world's na
tions, requires a dual policy of con
frontation and cooperation in an era
when "the Soviet Union has . . .
emerged as a global power."
'Complement resistance'
"The policies of what used to be
known as detente," said Sonnenfeldt
to scattered laughter, "seek to com
plement resistance by force to Soviet
expansionism wilh positive efforts to
draw them into interactions that will
tie them economically, scientifically,
and technologically to the West."
It is inherent in a foreign policy of
this type that il must operate "on a
long-term basis." U.S.-Soviet rela
tions, stressed Sonnenfeldt, do not
constitute a problem that can be resol
ved "conclusively."
The American tendency in foreign
policy has always been to seek total
and immediate solutions that com
pletely dispose of a problem, accord
ing to Sonnenfeldt. This will not be
possible in the case of relations with
the Soviet Union.
In light of the long-term necessity of
this policy, he said, it is misleading to
approach the question of U.S.-Soviet
relations as a "scorecard." or to ask
"Who yets more?" or "Is it a one-wav

street? Is it a two-way street?"
"While these are, of course, impor
tant and interesting questions," said
Sonnenfeldt. "they divert us from the
more important one of whether the re
lationship is a happy or unhappy rela
tionship."
Sonnenfeldt denied that there exists
a "Sonnenfeldt Doctrine" which
tacitly promises non-interference on
the part of the West and cedes control
of Eastern Europe to the Soviet Union,
as an appropriate application of the
"spheres of influence" principle.
Collusion denied
Sonnenfeldt also denied that there
was any collusion between the U.S.
and the Soviet Union to oppose "the
historic compromise" by which West
ern European communist parties
would share power in their own na
tional governments.

During the question period that fol
lowed his speech, Sonnenfeldt was
asked to comment on a recent alleged
statement by Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger that "the day of the U.S. is
past — today is the day of the Soviet
Union." Sonnenfeldt replied that to
the best of his knowledge, Kissinger
"never said it and doesn't believe it."
Asked about recent American pro
nouncements regarding the inadvisa
bility of Cuban-Soviet intervention in
Rhodesia, Sonnenfeldt said that de
spite the American government's
committmept to "majority rule and
minority rights" in the breakaway
British colony, such intervention, by
Cuban troops using Soviet weapons,
would have "a serious destabilizing"
effect on the balance of power in Africa
and therefore "we simply cannot be
uninvolved."
