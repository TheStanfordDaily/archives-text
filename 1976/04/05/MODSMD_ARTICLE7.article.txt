## Opinions Grad students' concerns 
### 
Mueller, et al.

This month attention on the Stanford campus
turns once again to the annual election of the
Council of Presidents (COP). Despite the fact that
graduate students comprise fully half the students
at Stanford, and despite the size and vitality of
Escondido Village, there has been in recent years
no married student/graduate student onCOP.and
there should be.
Attention to Escondido Village concerns about
housing and parking issues was greatly enhanced
by the work of the Escondido Village graduate
student slate election to the ASSU Senate in
1974-75 and the work of Escondido Village resi
dent and graduate student Bill Hoke as ASSU
Senate chairperson in 1975-76.
But the members of the COP, more than any
other students on campus, are in a position to
voice student concerns, facilitate and initiate stu
dent services, and push for solutions to student
problems. Without a graduae student/married
student on the COP, we have given up an impor
tant and effective base from which to work for our
interests.
Therefore, we — as residents of Escondido Vil
lage, student parents, graduate students — are
very pleased that Deric Jennings — 30, married, a
second-year graduate student in economics and
the present chairperson of the Graduate Student
Council (GSC) — is running for the COP. He has

demonstrated his concern while chairperson of
the GSC with the all-important issue of financial
aid, and with the problems of child care and the
other support services so important to us.
The slate of which he is a member — Vic Petroff,
Carole Houck and Al Tomaszczuk — is intent on
putting the ASSU offices at the service of all stu
dents. Their urging Jennings, with his experience
and demonstrated competence, to join them,
shows their awareness of the past neglect of
graduate student/married student concerns.
Few graduate students and Escondido Village
students voted in the last ASSU election. Despite
the concern of the Escondido Village Council and
despite promises made last year by the current
COP, no polling place is yet established in the
village.
Our low vote total is often cited as an excuse for
the lack of attention to graduate student and vil
lage concerns — our indifference to ASSU elec
tions is understandable, since they have done so
little for us!
This year, however, we welcome Jennings'
candidacy on the Petroff, Houck, Jennings, To
maszczuk slate as a promise with some substance
to it — a chance for real representation for us.
