Nuclear power
Edward Teller is undoubtedly
an expert on the manufacture of
nuclear weapons. However, his
opinions on the role that the Un
ited States can play in influenc
ing their spread aiound the
world (Daily, March 30) have to
be seen as just that â€” personal
opinions.
Many disagree with his views
that the United States cannot in
fluence worldwide weapons
proliferation by banning nuclear
exports. For example, David Li
lienthal, the first chairman of the
U.S. Atomic Energy Commis
sion (AEC), this year called on
Congress to issue "a ringing de
claration against exporting a
single additional gram of
plutonium or enriched uranium,
or a single additional nuclear
reactor of any kind by anyone
from this country to any other
country."
The main flaw in Teller's ar
gument, however, is that "(the
poor countries') underdevelop
ment can only be eliminated by
introducing nuclear power
plants .. . ." That this is fallaci
ous has been pointed out re
cently in a lengthy report from

the U.S. Energy Research and
Development Administration
(the successor to the AEC).
The report notes first that the
energy needs of the underde
veloped countries will be far less
than predicted by the West be
cause of their shift away from an
energy-intensive pattern of de
velopment. Second, nuclear
power plants are just too large to
accommodate into the transmis
sion systems of the majority of
the poor countries, and third, the
capital cost of nuclear plants
(over $1 billion each) is prohibi
tive.
Teller is right in one aspect:
We must do absolutely every
thing to eliminate the enormous
disparity between the rich and
the poor nations. However, in
terms of helping poorer nations
develop their energy sysems,
Philip Abelson's editorial in the
current issue of Science on
energy from biomass is closer to
the mark:
"The United States has so
many possible energy sources
and so much wealth that it can
perhaps afford long controver
sies about what to do. Other na
tions cannot equivocate. They

will adopt nuclear energy unless
alternatives quickly become av
ailable. This will be true ulti
mately even in the tropical, less
developed countries that have
abundant renewable resources.
Where will those countries find
the billion or so dollars to buy a
nuclear power plant? Where wi 11
they find the skilled technicians
to operate the plants safely?
Would the world not be better off
and safer if such countries were
obtaining their energy from
biomass?"

Bike ramp
The genius that removed the
bike ramp from in front of Wil
bur Hall must be the same guy
that designed the traffic light
system of Palo Alto for maximal
inefficiency. The ramp was re
moved because (as I understand
it) a girl rode down it and into a
truck, thereby breaking her nose.
The situation caused by bike
traffic on the sidewalks is con
siderably more hazardous than
that of running into trucks down
a ramp. Besides which, similar
ramps are all over campus.

girls Ihan Branner.
P.S. If I ride my bike into the
side of UGLY, will the building
be removed?
