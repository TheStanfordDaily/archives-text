SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Quar
terback Jim Plunkett became a San
Francisco 49er Monday, after five
seasons with the New England Pat
riots, and said, "I'm glad to be
back."
Plunkett was a Heisman Trophy
winner here in 1970 when he led
Stanford to a Rose Howl champion
ship.
The 49ers gave New England
23-year-old quarterback Tom Owen
plus their two first-round draft
choices this year and their first and
second round choices in the 1977
NFL draft of college players.
"It was the price we felt it was
necessary to pay to get a quarter
back of Jim's quality," said Monte
(-lark, San Francisco's new coach.
Plunkett, who signed a three-year
contract with the 49ers Monday
morning, said, "I'm glad things
worked out."
