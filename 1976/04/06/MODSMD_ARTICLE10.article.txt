# Education: hinder or liberate?

Congratulations to Scott
Rutherford who, as he related in
his April 2 Daily column, was
"naive" enough to recognize the
contradictions of the educa
tional process here at Stanford.
Given the criteria for success in
academe, it is indeed remarkable
that any originality is generated
at all.
The recent controversies
about grades, curriculum and
admission requirements reflect
our insecurity and paranoia
about what it is we learn (or
"should" learn) and how best to
evaluate that. As much as we
may want — or even need — to
display our accomplishments to
the world, that which is of ongo
ing value and meaning lies out
side the scope of quantification.
The dilemma that his column
illustrates is the nil too common
occurrence of seeing the creative
and engaging parts of one's ex
perience being thwartedfor ren
dered irrelevant) by the
exigencies of a system that
coerces our efforts into quantifi
able patterns for proper
categorization. The dynamics of
people critically and imagina
tively exploring the worlds of

knowledge is not available to
visual inspection.
And contrary to what many of
our venerable profesors and ad
ministrators seem to think, more
requirements and forced feed
ings are about as appropriate a
response to academic dis-ease as
attempting to extinguish a fire
with flame throwers.
Problems deeper
The problems are perhaps
deeper than most of us are wil
ling to admit — or accept. Wil
liam Thompson observes, in
"The Edge of History," that uni
versity training "fits its students
for their futures like beggars who
maim their children so they can
become good beggars."
By negating education and
knowledge as processes of crea
tive inquiry, we become im
mersed in a pedagogy of oppres
sion. Paulo Fraire, in his book
Pedagogy of the Oppressed,
shows how the fundamentally
narrative character of the
student-teacher relationship
creates a "banking" idea of
learning. Education becomes an
act of depositing where students
are the depositories for filling by

) their depositors (or teachers).
Objects (students) listen and
112 absorb; subjects (teachers) nar
- rate or teach. Knowledge tends
; to become "lifeless and pet
■ rified" as it is isolated from the
i processes that engender it and
; give it significance.
: "Words are emptied of their
concreteness, and become hol
low, alienated and alienating
i verbosity," Fraire writes.
Depending on how com
pletely they accept the role, stu
-1 dents adapt to the world "as it
is" and are filed away as they
become more successful and just
plain full . . . and less creative
and responsible. As Fraire says,
"the solution is not to integrate
I them into the structure of op
pression, but to transform that
structure so they can become be
ings for themselves."
Activity precludes
To our dismay, thinking itself
is authenticated by the very
: communication that ourclass
-1 room activity precludes.
' "Liberating education consists
1 in acts of cognition, not transfer
' rals of information," Fraire
states.
When people are jointly re
sponsible for a process in which
all grow, action and reflection
can harmonize to awaken people
to the limitless, though dormant,
possibilities within themselves.
Dignity and integrity are thus
vindicated; meaningful interac
tion and creative pursuit thus
humanize reality.
The more searching our un
derstanding of the world, based
on the wholeness of the human
personality, the more we can
transform its influences. Other
wise. we have a world of afflu
ence, Heethoven, marvelous
museums and wonderful
machines, to be sure, but also
one full of the agonizingly per
sistent reality of Auschwitz,
Vietnam. Hiroshima and inhu
man poverty and starvation.
The world can be humanized
as we liberate ourselves from its
dehumanization. Education can
nurture that struggle or shackle
the insight needed for its suste
nance.

Congratulations to Scott
Rutherford who, as he related in
his April 2 Daily column, was
"naive" enough to recognize the
contradictions of the educa
tional process here at Stanford.
Given the criteria for success in
academe, it is indeed remarkable
that any originality is generated
at all.
The recent controversies
about grades, curriculum and
admission requirements reflect
our insecurity and paranoia
about what it is we learn (or
"should" learn) and how best to
evaluate that. As much as we
may want — or even need — to
display our accomplishments to
the world, that which is of ongo
ing value and meaning lies out
side the scope of quantification.
The dilemma that his column
illustrates is the nil too common
occurrence of seeing the creative
and engaging parts of one's ex
perience being thwartedfor ren
dered irrelevant) by the
exigencies of a system that
coerces our efforts into quantifi
able patterns for proper
categorization. The dynamics of
people critically and imagina
tively exploring the worlds of

knowledge is not available to
visual inspection.
And contrary to what many of
our venerable profesors and ad
ministrators seem to think, more
requirements and forced feed
ings are about as appropriate a
response to academic dis-ease as
attempting to extinguish a fire
with flame throwers.
Problems deeper
The problems are perhaps
deeper than most of us are wil
ling to admit — or accept. Wil
liam Thompson observes, in
"The Edge of History," that uni
versity training "fits its students
for their futures like beggars who
maim their children so they can
become good beggars."
By negating education and
knowledge as processes of crea
tive inquiry, we become im
mersed in a pedagogy of oppres
sion. Paulo Fraire, in his book
Pedagogy of the Oppressed,
shows how the fundamentally
narrative character of the
student-teacher relationship
creates a "banking" idea of
learning. Education becomes an
act of depositing where students
are the depositories for filling by

) their depositors (or teachers).
Objects (students) listen and
112 absorb; subjects (teachers) nar
- rate or teach. Knowledge tends
; to become "lifeless and pet
■ rified" as it is isolated from the
i processes that engender it and
; give it significance.
: "Words are emptied of their
concreteness, and become hol
low, alienated and alienating
i verbosity," Fraire writes.
Depending on how com
pletely they accept the role, stu
-1 dents adapt to the world "as it
is" and are filed away as they
become more successful and just
plain full . . . and less creative
and responsible. As Fraire says,
"the solution is not to integrate
I them into the structure of op
pression, but to transform that
structure so they can become be
ings for themselves."

To our dismay, thinking itself
is authenticated by the very
: communication that ourclass
