# Artist's right to integrity of his work
## 
### 
The recent suit brought against ABC by
the British comedy troupe Monty Python
illuminates an interesting issue — What are
the rights of an "artist" to his finished pro
duct?
After the airing of three programs from
the series Monty Python's Fly in g Circus,
spliced together for ABC's 90-minute The
VVor/d of Entertainment, the British comedy
team sued ABC to restrain the network from
showing a second Python special. Python
was unsuccessful in gaining the restraining
order and ABC aired the second special on
Dec. 26, 1975.
The Pythons' objections to the two spe
cials dealt with the integrity of their work.
For ABC, in order to fit the 30 minutes of
each show into a 90-minute slot that in
cluded had to slice ap
proximately 22 minutes off the combined
three shows.
But ABC had not just cut out block parts
from the shows. Instead, to tighten them up
or to make them funnier, it had carefully
removed material which it termed "offen
sive."
Detracted from message
No longer was the semi-avant garde
banter of the show to be found, something
the Pythons felt strongly detracted from the
humor and message of their work. But even
worse, from their viewpoint, was the loss of
continuity created by the cuts.
In fact, one of the Pythons, after seeing a
tape of the October 3 show, wrote that the
show looked as if they "had written and
performed a short, pointless, and not par
ticularly funny sketch."
Arguing before U.S. District Court Judge
Morris Lasker, the Pythons claimed that
each of their shows is a tightly-knit unit,
dependent to a large extent on themes de
veloped throughout a program. And they
pointed out the expurgated version shown
on ABC often made little sense because cer
tain referents had been cut out.
The Pythons also contended that they

would lose money because of the ABC
showing, claiming that the poor quality of
the programs would discourage people
from buying Python record albums and
from attending Python movies. However
this was merely a peripheral issue to the
Pythons, who termed these "crass financial
matters."

When the decision was eventually made,
Lasker ruled in favor of ABC on the grounds
that ABC] stood to lose what it claimed was
nearly half a million dollars, while the
Pythons argument that they would suffer a
monetary loss was thought to be shaky. (The
reason the judge chose this monetary loss
distinction as grounds for his decision was
because each side had produced valid con
tracts supporting its stance.)
But the case brings up an interesting con
troversy:Shouldthe integrity of artists' pro
ducts be protected?
Statutes protect
In many European countries, statutes for
bid destroying or altering paintings and
sculptures. Yet, if one examines the
rationale for these laws, he finds them to be
inconsistent and ill-defined.
Two questions should be posed to those
who defend laws protecting an artist's
work: First, what makes an artist's work so
special that it alone of society's products
should be protected by law? And second,
who is to decide what is art?
Even if one can scrounge together an ar
gument for the protection of an artist's pro

duct, he will find answering the second
question insuperably difficult.
For isn't a car made hy the skilled hands
of the employees of General Motors just as
much a piece of art as a painting by Jackson
Pollock?And if this is so, should't we forbid
people to customize their cars, because to
do so would be to defame the work of the
artists at GM?
Absurd position
One can readily see the absurd position in
which such laws place him. Society, as a
whole, does not agree on what constitutes
art: what may be art to one may simply be an
eyesore to another.
Many argue (including some professors
here) that laws to protect art are necessary to
preserve works that can be enjoyed by man
kind throughout the ages. But as a practical
matter, a painting owned by an individual
collector is unlikely to be seen by many
others.
Private owners rarely display their collec
tions. prefering to keep them safe under
lock and key. And museums which own
important works rarely (if ever) sell their
pieces to private collectors.
One must admit that works which many
in later generations might havecalled "mas
terpieces" could be mutilated under a sys
tem which lacks laws to protect them. How
ever, it makes far more sense to risk losing
these works than to force people to preserve
all products made by society.
To keep its programs intact, Monty
Python should have secured ABC's promise
that the network would not alter them; as
Python received no promise, the verdict in
its case was justified.
So-called "works ofarf'should be treated
just like any other product of society — once
one gains possession of them, he should
have license to do with them as he pleases,
even if he decides to destroy them.
