Vote for Howard
This letter is primarily addres
sed to the graduate community.
Several claims of the Vic Fetroff
slate in their Daily blurb deserve
refutation.
As officers of Stanford Teach
ing and Research Employees'
Union, we organized grad stu
dent teachers assistants and re
sident assistants, who had not
received pay adjustments de
spite the 50 percent inflation be
tween 1969and 1975. Our efforts
were severely undercut by the
sudden materialization of a
Graduate Student Council
(GSC), instigated by then-Dean
of Graduate Studies Lincoln
Moses.
The GSC has since meekly ac
cepted administration con
straints and contented itself
with endlessly discussing redis
tribution of the shamefully in
adequate graduate support.
For five quarters. Deric Jen
nings has had a personal
pipeline to the dean of graduate
studies (the last two as head of
the GSC), and he has ac
complished nothing.
He has been completely inef
fective in presenting ideas to the
administration that represent
the true needs of the graduate
students he is rumored to repre
sent. In essence, he has been a
convenient rubber stamp.
Carole Houck made an earnest
effort to reconcile disparate
people in the ASSU Senate. The
effort failed.
And. despite her vigorous
balloon-bouncing campaign of
last fall, she has contributed lit
tle else, in substance or style, to

this year's senate.
The Dan Howard slate does
not view the Council of Presi
dents as being another branch of
the University administration.
They will be advocates for the
particularly student point of
view.
They deserve your support.
They have ours.

Petroff unqualified
It is curiously ironic that the
Vic Petroff slate should stress the
"disappointing record" of their
"predecessors" in Petroff's April
2 Daily column entitled "Ex
perience." As an ASSU senator
last year I recall that Petroff had
nearly the worst attendance re
cord in the senate, attending
only every third meeting so that
he would not be disqualified.
This was in contradiction to
his senate campaign literature,
when he promised "to attend
every meeting." It seems even
more absurd that his column
criticized "unproductive fac
tions" as he was among the most
seriously offensive members, at
times leaving meetings in order
to lose the quorum while discus
sing issues he was opposed to.
Given his rude and unproduc
tive way of dealing with other
senators and his poor record in
the senate, I find it incredible
that Petroff attempts to stand on
his past experience.

Electoral process
Perhaps more than in any pre
vious election year, the 1976
presidential campaign de
monstrates a major flaw in the
United States political system.
The plethora of candidates in
volved in the current race, many
of whom presently hold public
office, has made the individual
commitment of time and money
required for a campaign en
deavor particularly apparent.
With so many of our elected
officials out raising funds and
gathering primary votes, a
legitimate question is: Who's
mi tiding the store?
The fact that our present sys
tem of choosing a president is
outdated and in need of revision
is undeniable. In order to gain
adequate public exposure, a
candidate must have two essen
tial entities: 1) time to make
numerous personal appear
ances, and 2) sufficient funds to
finance these as well as other as
pects of the campaign.
If already an office holder, the
former certainly impinges upon
his ability to perform the duties
for which he was elected.
Meanwhile, the second re
quirement, which achieves its
greatest support from lavish
fund-raising dinners and similar
affairs, could obviously be spent
on more worthwhile endeavors.
By the time November arrives,
campaign expenditures will
have undoubtedly exceeded the
amount of money required to al
leviate many of the problems
about which the candidates have
argued.
That our current system is able

to raise funds for talking about
rather than solving domestic is
sues indicates a clear need for
reform.
Numerous minor flaws af
forded by the present situation
accompany these two major ab
surdities. For example, en
vironmental quality and the
energy situation are two of the
main topics of debate in the 1976
presidential race.
In order to talk about these is
sues, candidates frantically fly
and drive from one primary state
to the next, not to mention the
tons of paper used to produce
campaign posters and similar
items which ultimately become
litter. Air Force One and Presi
dent Gerald Ford paraphernalia
are certainly not exceptions to
this point.
In view of these problems, a
future candidate might be wise
to base his campaign on a prom
ise; of four years of service, rather
than the three and one-half
which we currently obtain from
our chief executive.
This criticism of the present
electoral system does not at
tempt to provide a suitable alter
native, for even if one were
found, its implementation
would be difficult — if not im
possible. The antiquity and inef
ficiency with which our nation
chooses a President are so
übiquitous in our goverment
that radical reforms of any kind
are unlikely.
Nevertheless, it is clear that
improvement is warranted re
garding the fate of our nation's
highest office.

Petroff unqualified
It is curiously ironic that the
Vic Petroff slate should stress the
"disappointing record" of their
"predecessors" in Petroff's April
2 Daily column entitled "Ex
perience." As an ASSU senator
last year I recall that Petroff had
nearly the worst attendance re
cord in the senate, attending
only every third meeting so that
he would not be disqualified.
This was in contradiction to
his senate campaign literature,
when he promised "to attend
every meeting." It seems even
more absurd that his column
criticized "unproductive fac
tions" as he was among the most
seriously offensive members, at
times leaving meetings in order
to lose the quorum while discus
sing issues he was opposed to.
Given his rude and unproduc
tive way of dealing with other
senators and his poor record in
the senate, I find it incredible
that Petroff attempts to stand on
his past experience.

Electoral process
Perhaps more than in any pre
vious election year, the 1976
presidential campaign de
monstrates a major flaw in the
United States political system.
The plethora of candidates in
volved in the current race, many
of whom presently hold public
office, has made the individual
commitment of time and money
required for a campaign en
deavor particularly apparent.
With so many of our elected
officials out raising funds and
gathering primary votes, a
legitimate question is: Who's
mi tiding the store?
The fact that our present sys
tem of choosing a president is
outdated and in need of revision
is undeniable. In order to gain
adequate public exposure, a
candidate must have two essen
tial entities: 1) time to make
numerous personal appear
ances, and 2) sufficient funds to
finance these as well as other as
pects of the campaign.
If already an office holder, the
former certainly impinges upon
his ability to perform the duties
for which he was elected.
Meanwhile, the second re
quirement, which achieves its
greatest support from lavish
fund-raising dinners and similar
affairs, could obviously be spent
on more worthwhile endeavors.
By the time November arrives,
campaign expenditures will
have undoubtedly exceeded the
amount of money required to al
leviate many of the problems
about which the candidates have
argued.

Perhaps more than in any pre
vious election year, the 1976
presidential campaign de
monstrates a major flaw in the
United States political system.
The plethora of candidates in
volved in the current race, many
of whom presently hold public
office, has made the individual
commitment of time and money
required for a campaign en
deavor particularly apparent.
With so many of our elected
officials out raising funds and
gathering primary votes, a
legitimate question is: Who's
mi tiding the store?
The fact that our present sys
tem of choosing a president is
outdated and in need of revision
is undeniable. In order to gain
adequate public exposure, a
candidate must have two essen
tial entities: 1) time to make
numerous personal appear
ances, and 2) sufficient funds to
finance these as well as other as
pects of the campaign.
If already an office holder, the
former certainly impinges upon
his ability to perform the duties
for which he was elected.
Meanwhile, the second re
quirement, which achieves its
greatest support from lavish
fund-raising dinners and similar
affairs, could obviously be spent
on more worthwhile endeavors.
By the time November arrives,
campaign expenditures will
have undoubtedly exceeded the
amount of money required to al
leviate many of the problems
about which the candidates have
argued.
That our current system is able

to raise funds for talking about
rather than solving domestic is
sues indicates a clear need for
reform.
Numerous minor flaws af
forded by the present situation
accompany these two major ab
surdities. For example, en
vironmental quality and the
energy situation are two of the
main topics of debate in the 1976
presidential race.
In order to talk about these is
sues, candidates frantically fly
and drive from one primary state
to the next, not to mention the
tons of paper used to produce
campaign posters and similar
items which ultimately become
litter. Air Force One and Presi
dent Gerald Ford paraphernalia
are certainly not exceptions to
this point.
In view of these problems, a
future candidate might be wise
to base his campaign on a prom
ise; of four years of service, rather
than the three and one-half
which we currently obtain from
our chief executive.
This criticism of the present
electoral system does not at
tempt to provide a suitable alter
native, for even if one were
found, its implementation
would be difficult — if not im
possible. The antiquity and inef
ficiency with which our nation
chooses a President are so
übiquitous in our goverment
that radical reforms of any kind
are unlikely.
Nevertheless, it is clear that
improvement is warranted re
garding the fate of our nation's
highest office.

Several claims of the Vic Fetroff
slate in their Daily blurb deserve
refutation.
As officers of Stanford Teach

Union, we organized grad stu

received pay adjustments de

were severely undercut by the
sudden materialization of a
Graduate Student Council
(GSC), instigated by then-Dean
of Graduate Studies Lincoln
Moses.
The GSC has since meekly ac
cepted administration con
straints and contented itself
with endlessly discussing redis
tribution of the shamefully in
adequate graduate support.
For five quarters. Deric Jen

pipeline to the dean of graduate
studies (the last two as head of
the GSC), and he has ac
complished nothing.
He has been completely inef
fective in presenting ideas to the
administration that represent
the true needs of the graduate
students he is rumored to repre

convenient rubber stamp.
Carole Houck made an earnest
effort to reconcile disparate
people in the ASSU Senate. The
effort failed.
And. despite her vigorous
balloon-bouncing campaign of
last fall, she has contributed lit

this year's senate.
The Dan Howard slate does
not view the Council of Presi

the University administration.
They will be advocates for the
particularly student point of
view.
They deserve your support.

Petroff unqualified
It is curiously ironic that the
Vic Petroff slate should stress the
"disappointing record" of their
"predecessors" in Petroff's April
2 Daily column entitled "Ex
perience." As an ASSU senator
last year I recall that Petroff had
nearly the worst attendance re
cord in the senate, attending
only every third meeting so that
he would not be disqualified.
This was in contradiction to
his senate campaign literature,
when he promised "to attend
every meeting." It seems even
more absurd that his column
criticized "unproductive fac
tions" as he was among the most
seriously offensive members, at
times leaving meetings in order
to lose the quorum while discus
sing issues he was opposed to.
Given his rude and unproduc
tive way of dealing with other
senators and his poor record in
the senate, I find it incredible
that Petroff attempts to stand on
his past experience.
