# Israeli 'dove' says Israel should bargain with Arabs
## 
### Bruce Kadden 
Israel's leading "dove" said
here Sunday that the Israeli gov
ernment should issuea "declara
tion of intent" stating that the
country's leaders will negotiate
with representatives of the Arab
Palestinians wit! "the goal of re
turning to 1967 borders," in ex
change for a sign'd treaty recog
nizing Israel's ri ht to exist.
Arie Lova Eliav, a member of
thi! Knesset (Israel's parliament)
since 1965 and a former secret
ary general of the Labor party,
said that a Jewish Israel and an
Arab Palestini n state could
exist side-by-si though such
an occurence " not forthcom
ing tomorrow.'
Eliav explfi d the less
publicized po jn of Israeli
"doves" to mc han 100 per
sons inTresidd large lounge.
Because "wat always a vital
interest of Isr there is no
comparison be en the doves
of the United S es during the
Vietnam war arid Israeli doves,
who are also called "moderates"
or "realists," according to Eliav.
Need strong army
Doves believe that "Israel will
have to keep a strong army for a
long time" (Eliav was a
lieutenant-colonel during the Is
rael War of Independence), but
differ from a majority of their
countrymen in the road to peace
they think the government
should follow.
Doves. Eliav explained, accept
that tbi! territory under question
in the Middle East is "the land of
our (Israelis') fathers and the
land of their (Arab Palestinians')
fathers too." The "source of the
Mideast conflict" is the struggle
of two national movements for
one land.
He therefore proposed "halving
the loaf" and returning the ter
ritory taken after 1967 if a peace
treaty guaranteeing mutual rec
ognition is signed.

Eliav points out that by mak
ing such a declaration, the Is
raelis would "start breaking the
vicious circle" in which the two
sides currently find themselves
chained.
He speculated that such a
move "will win back the minds
and hearts" of Europeans and
Americans who currently view
Israel as intransigent.
He also pointed out that a de
claration of intent would "put
the onus on the other side."
rather than letting "America put
us on our knees" in a defensive
position that no Israelis want.
Eliav explained that the decla
ration should be directed to all
the Arab contingencies whose
pre-1967 land Israel now oc
cupies.
Consider Syria
Israel can give up the Golan
and the Sinai in exchange for
recognition by Syria and Egypt,
respectively, he said. But,
warned Eliav, just concluding a
full peace settlement with Egypt,
as currently seems possible, will
not solve the problem.
He added that the Western
Bank of the Jordan River, the
Gaza strip and perhaps part of
eastern Jordan should be turned
over for the formation of an Arab
Palestinian state, if a similar set
tlement could be reached with
their representatives, including
the Palestinian Liberation Or
ganization.
However, Eliav stated that
Jerusalem, the eastern part of
which was captured by the Is
raelis in 1967, "should be dealt
with in a unique fashion" be
cause it is an "emotional prob
lem."
Divide Jerusalem
He suggested the creation of
two "boroughs" or self
governing towns for the Jewish
and Arab sections, but insisted
that Jews, Christians and Mos
lems have access to their holy
places situated in a one-half

square mile area. Jerusalem
should remain Israel's capital,
he insisted.
Asked about the condition of
Arabs currently living in Israel.
Eliav claimed that their
"economic and social situation
is five-fold as good as it was be
fore the liberation of Israel. On
the whole our record is good,"
he insisted.
Questioned about the recent
confrontation between Arab Is
raelis and government militia,
Eliav said that he had previously
written to Israel's prime minister
opposing the expropriation of
land in the Galilee which
triggered the trouble.
'Closet' doves
Eliav explained that doves are
found in virtually all parties in
Israel, though those in the
right-wing groups he classified
as "closet doves." He admitted
that it was an "uphill struggle
for doves" in Israel, one in which
"Arabs are not helping us any."
He pointed out that the Arab
Israelis have been "psychologi
cally pressed," because of their
"schizophrenic" or "ambivalent
loyalties." For this reason they
are not allowed to fight in Is
rael's army, he said.
