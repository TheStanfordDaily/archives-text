# Soviets 'harrass' scientists
## 
### Bruce Kadden 
A former Soviet physicist
who spent a year in a labor
camp said here Friday that
Western scientists are "au
tomatically involved in the
process of politicalization of
science" if they do nothing on
behalf of "their harrassed col
leagues" in (he IJ.S.S.R.
Evgeny Levich, touring the
United States to meet with
academicians and explain
the situation of Soviet dissi
dent scientists, charged that
Soviet authorities "use the
possibility of going abroad as
some kind of blackmail of
their scientists."
In an exclusive Daily inter
view, Levich stated that sci
entists "are forced to com
promise their principles" in
order to leave the Soviet
Union and tour the United
States.
Levich said that scientists
wishing to participate in ex
change programs with the
United States were forced to
"join the Communist party,
sign a letter condemning
Aleksandr Sakharov" and
support expelling Levich's
father from the prestigious
Soviet Academy of Science.
Levich stated that U.S.
State Department officials
told him that two thirds of all
scientific exchange programs
between the two countries is
run by the State Department,
with the rest being organized
by the National Academy of
Science.
"Only if United States sci
entists will take this problem
into their own hands, can the
scientific community and ex
change of information be
pure from political considera
tions."
He outlined two alterna
tives he would find accepta
ble for Western scientists:
"not communicating with the
Soviet Union at all, or to force
theauthorities tochange their

attitude toward this prob
lem."
Levich also said that of the
more than 1000 Soviet scien
tists who have come to the
United States in the last few
years, a majority "were semi
scientists and semi-officials,
people who belonged to the
ruling elite in the Soviet Un
ion."
While on campus Levich
met with a group of scientists,
including Physics Prof.
Robert Hofstadter, Applied
Physics and Electrical En
gineering Prof. Marvin
Chodorow and Computer
Science Prof. John McCarthy.
Of his contacts with

American scientists, Levich
said he was "pleased" be
cause he saw that "they
realized the importance of
their pressure on both Soviet
authorities and the American
administration in order to re
store purity of science."
Levich was taken under
"administrative arrest and
sentenced without a trial" to a
Soviet labor camp about 18
months ago.
When his term was up, he
received a visa to leave the
country, part of a program to
let the "children of Jewish
academicians who applied to
leave" out of the Soviet Un
ion.

States.
Levich said that scientists
wishing to participate in ex
change programs with the
United States were forced to
"join the Communist party,
sign a letter condemning
Aleksandr Sakharov" and
support expelling Levich's
father from the prestigious
Soviet Academy of Science.
Levich stated that U.S.
State Department officials
told him that two thirds of all
scientific exchange programs
between the two countries is
run by the State Department,
with the rest being organized
by the National Academy of
Science.
"Only if United States sci
entists will take this problem
into their own hands, can the
scientific community and ex
change of information be
pure from political considera
tions."
He outlined two alterna
tives he would find accepta
ble for Western scientists:
"not communicating with the
Soviet Union at all, or to force
theauthorities tochange their

attitude toward this prob
lem."
Levich also said that of the
more than 1000 Soviet scien
tists who have come to the
United States in the last few
years, a majority "were semi
scientists and semi-officials,
people who belonged to the
ruling elite in the Soviet Un
ion."
While on campus Levich
met with a group of scientists,
including Physics Prof.
Robert Hofstadter, Applied
Physics and Electrical En
gineering Prof. Marvin
Chodorow and Computer
Science Prof. John McCarthy.
Of his contacts with

American scientists, Levich
said he was "pleased" be
cause he saw that "they
realized the importance of
their pressure on both Soviet
authorities and the American
administration in order to re
store purity of science."
Levich was taken under
"administrative arrest and
sentenced without a trial" to a
Soviet labor camp about 18
months ago.
When his term was up, he
received a visa to leave the
country, part of a program to
let the "children of Jewish
academicians who applied to
leave" out of the Soviet Un
ion.
