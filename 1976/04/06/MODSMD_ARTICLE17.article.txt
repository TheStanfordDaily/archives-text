# Police nationwide have spy squads
## 
### 
CHICAGO (PNS) — While public atten
tion focuses on congressional investiga
tions ot FBI and CIA abuses, illegal ac
tivities by what may be the nation's largest
army ol political spies — local police "Red
Squads" — have gone virtually unnoticed at
the national level.
These 200 political intelligence units,
from almost every major American city, be
long to the federally funded Law Enforce
ment Intelligence Unit, through which they
exchange files and other information.
Where investigations of Red Squads have
taken place, violations of the law have been
routinely documented.
In Chicago last fall a special grand jury
charged the Chicago Red Squad with illegal
burglaries and wiretapping, infiltration of
groups engaged in no criminal activity, in
citement to violence and aid to a right-wing
terrorist organization engaged in harass
ment of the left.
Police state?
The grand jury said the activity had "all
the earmarks of a police state."
Several weeks after the report was re
leased, a class action lawsuit produced
documents proving the police department
had established a "neutralization" program
to "expose, cause to cease or change in di
rection. . . anti-social groups," among them
the National Lawyers Guild.
The San Diego City Council is beginning
hearings this month to investigate its Red
Squad, following press mention of its role in
helping the FBI fund a right-wing organiza
tion which terrorized the left in the early
70s.
The publicity resulted largely from a re
port submitted to the Senate's Select
Committee on Intelligence last summer by
the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU),
based on evidence gathered for a lawsuit.
Break-ins, bombs
According to the ACLU report, the San
Diego Red Squad worked closely with the
Secret Army Organization in a campaign of
break-ins and bombings, culminating in a
nighttime shooting raid which left a victim
permanently without the use of one arm.
The Red Squad then moved to prevent a
full investigation of the incident. Later, two
Red Squad members planned unsuccess
fully to assassinate another leading San
Diego radical, as one of the agents later ad
mitted to the target and a local newspaper
reporter.
In Houston a recent grand jury investiga
tion found extensive police surveillance
from within the local telephone company —

resulting in tiles on more than 1000 citizens
with no criminal records, including city
council and school board members.
'Unconstitutional*
And in Michigan a circuit court judge
recently discovered the Michigan State
Police Red Squad had files on over 200.000
citizens. He declared the squad unconstitu
tional and ordered the files destroyed.
Red Squads have also been investigated
during the last year by state legislatures in
Maryland and New York; by city councils in
Detroit, New York and Washington, D.C.;
and by county grand juries in Indianapolis
and Baltimore.
Class action lawsuits have been filed in
Los Angeles, Philadelphia, New York.
Chicago, Kansas City. Houston and Detroit.
FBI aid
In most cases extensive cooperation bet
ween local Red Squads and federal agencies
— particularly the FBI — has been
documented. Files have been freely ex
changed and agencies have often worked
together in disruption tactics.
The Rockefeller report on the CIA. and
recent documents obtained by the
Washington Star-News show the CIA has
also held special seminars for police offi
cials and trained domestic police depart
ments in clandestine operations such as
burglary and safe-cracking.
Local investigations demonstrated a con
sistent pattern of Red Squad activity across
the country, including infiltration, elec
tronic surveillance, disruption and tin; oc
casional use of right-wing terrorists. Few of
the Red Squad targets have been engaged in
criminal activity.
Infiltration
In Chicago the Red Squad infiltrated civil
rights groups like Jesse Jackson's Operation
PUSH, community groups like the Organi
zation for a Better Austin and civic watch
dogs like the Alliance to End Repression.
The grand jury, pointing out that all "at
one time or another were critical of the
policies of the Mayor of Chicago," con
cluded that "the true motivation for spying
on community groups was political."
Infiltrators not only submitted reports on
membership, leadership and financial
sources, but in several cases were instructed
to assume leadership roles in the groups
they penetrated.
Wiretaps
Electronic surveillance has been disco
vered with equal frequency. Manufacturers
of electronic surveillance equipment tes
tified recently before the National Wiretap

Commission that half their sales are to
police departments in jurisdictions where
wiretapping is illegal.
The total number of Ked Squad files re
sulting from intelligence operations is sec
ret, but recent announcements of file purges
suggest staggering numbers. Last April the
Los Angeles Public Disorder Intelligence
Division destroyed nearly two million
"outdated and irrelevant" index cards; in
1973. after being sued, the New York City
Red Squad purged roughly one million
cards.
Disruption
Disruption of community and political
organizations has also surfaced repeatedly.
The Chicago grand jury report denounces
the use of agents provocateurs — one of
whom even urged members of the organiza
tion he had infiltrated and risen to preside
over to shoot police officers, demonstrating
the most strategic place for snipers in
downtown Chicago.
In Detroit several people are suing the
Red Squad for allegedlv giving their
employers information about their political
activities, leading to their dismissal.
The San Diego Red Squad, according to
the ACLIJ report, carried on a continuing
campaign of disruption against anti-war lef
tists, including pressure on landlords and
employers and the use of informers.
The most serious disruption — both in
San Diego and Chicago — was carried on by
right-wing terrorist organizations working
with Red Squads.
Burglaries
In Chicago the grand jury found evidence
that Red Squad members had aided the
right-wing Legion of Justice in several
burglaries against left groups, watched as
legion members assaulted people in those
groups and gave legion members tear gas
grenades which were exploded at perfor
mances of the Russian Moiseyev Dancers
and the Chinese Shenyang Acrobatic
Troupe.
Lawyers in the ACLU case think San
Diego's Red Squad — and perhaps others —
was being used in a national effort, coordi
nated first by the FBI and later by the White
House, to make war on the left.
Pointing to a "striking resemblance" be
tween events in San Diego and Nixon ad
ministration proposals to heighten anti-left
intelligence and disruption, they hope to
subpoena high officials in the Nixon ad
ministration to discover whether the San
Diego Red Squad was part of a centralized
network of intimidation and harassment.
