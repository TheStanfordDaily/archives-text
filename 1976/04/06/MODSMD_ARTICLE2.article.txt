# KZSU, LCO seek ASSU-funding
## 
### Mary Anderson First of two parts 
The Legal Counseling Office (LCO)
and KZSU will be requesting fee as
sessment approval on the April 14 and
15 ballot.
Also on the ballot will be a one
quarter assessment of $1 for the prog
ram fee, which is used to fund various
campus organizations. Money from
the fee is distributed by the ASSU Se
nate.
The LCO, located in the Old
Firehouse, is requesting $1 assess
ments for both winter and spring quar
ters.
Nancy Doum, secretary for the LCO,
explained that the office has received
no other funding in its three-year his
tory besides the previous fee assess
ments. The assessments cover the
LCO's average monthly expenses of
$1600.
Consultations
During the past three years, the of
fice has rendered consultations on
students' legal problems concerning
employment, consumer, administra
tive, housing, family, tort and criminal
matters.
LCO statistics reveal that the office,
open four hours ii day. five days a
week, services an average of 5.4 stu
dents per day. This figure has re
mained steady over the past three
years, indicating a continuing need for
its on-campus legal services, accord
ing to the LCO staff.

The office in the past has functioned
to answer any sort of legal question. Its
attorneys have not yet gone to court in
a fee-generating capacity, but inci
dents of petty theft, most often occur
ring in the Stanford Bookstore, have
involved court appearances by one of
the office's attorneys.
Fundamentally, however, the LCO
is a consultation service. As part of its
policy the office does not represent
students against other students, or
against the University.
KZSU
KZSU is asking for a continued fee
assessment of $1 in autumn, winter
and spring quarters.
"The $3 fee assessment is really vital
to keeping us on the air," said station
manager Bill Ledeen.
Under Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) regulations, KZSU
maintains a non-commercial educa
tional status prohibiting the station
from receiving advertising. Ledeen
explained.
This status severely limits KZSU's
possible funding sources, although its
staff feels the station enjoys a more un
ique sound and freedom in production
than does a commercial station, he
said.
Cory Boyan of KZSU's engineering
staff noted that KZSU operations were
funded by a fixed, yearly ASSU as
sessment until the assessment was
abolished in 1970.
Moreover, within an increasingly

tight budget, the University cannot
appropriate substantial funds to the
station as a part of the Communication
Department, Ledeen said.
No underwriting
The University also prohibits KZSIJ
from underwriting expenses by appe
aling to outside organizations, he said.
"Because the University is in a
budget crunch situation, they want to
approach everybody. . . . They don't
want any other Stanford organizations
involving themselves with trying to
get any type of non-profit funding,"
said Ledeen.
Presently, KZSU may only under
write through outside sources if the
donations are unsolicited and are
specifically designated for KZSU
through the University, he added.
Theoretically. KZSU can advertise
on the AM portion of its broadcast,
which is transmitted to the dorms. Ad
vertising on AM has not proven suc
cessful, however, because of the ex
tremely limited AM audience, Ledeen
said.
KZSU, thus feels caught in a bind
between FCC regulations — which
demand maintenance of a high quality
facility without advertising revenues
— and University restrictions against
FM underwriting, he said. The station,
said Ledeen, sees the fee assessment as
being the only viable means of funding
at this time.
The projected budget for the 1977
fiscal year which Ledeen has submit

ted to KZSU's executive committee, is
contingent on a continued $1 per quar
ter fee assessment. Projected expendi
tures totalling $28,500 are similar to
expenditures of $28,015 for the 1976
fiscal year.
According to the budget, about
$27,500 of KZSU's income is expected
to come from an approved fee assess
ment, taking intoaccount a certain loss
from students reclaiming all or part of
their individually paid assessments.
About one third of KZSU's total ex
penses arise from "fixed expenses" —
such as telephones, teletype and two
essential salaried posts — without
which the station could not operate,
Ledeen said.
Besides additional programming
and department expenses. KZSU ex
pects FCC approval soon for a power
increase — from the present 10 watts to
500 watts — which will create more
expenses for the equipment and pro
duction systems renovations that will
be required by the FCC for a station of
such increased capacity, Ledeen said.

aling to outside organizations, he said.
"Because the University is in a
budget crunch situation, they want to
approach everybody. . . . They don't
want any other Stanford organizations
involving themselves with trying to
get any type of non-profit funding,"
said Ledeen.
Presently, KZSU may only under
write through outside sources if the
donations are unsolicited and are
specifically designated for KZSU
through the University, he added.
Theoretically. KZSU can advertise
on the AM portion of its broadcast,
which is transmitted to the dorms. Ad
vertising on AM has not proven suc
cessful, however, because of the ex
tremely limited AM audience, Ledeen
said.
KZSU, thus feels caught in a bind
between FCC regulations — which
demand maintenance of a high quality
facility without advertising revenues
— and University restrictions against
FM underwriting, he said. The station,
said Ledeen, sees the fee assessment as
being the only viable means of funding
at this time.
The projected budget for the 1977
fiscal year which Ledeen has submit

ted to KZSU's executive committee, is
contingent on a continued $1 per quar
ter fee assessment. Projected expendi
tures totalling $28,500 are similar to
expenditures of $28,015 for the 1976
fiscal year.
According to the budget, about
$27,500 of KZSU's income is expected
to come from an approved fee assess
ment, taking intoaccount a certain loss
from students reclaiming all or part of
their individually paid assessments.
About one third of KZSU's total ex
penses arise from "fixed expenses" —
such as telephones, teletype and two
essential salaried posts — without
which the station could not operate,
Ledeen said.
Besides additional programming
and department expenses. KZSU ex
pects FCC approval soon for a power
increase — from the present 10 watts to
500 watts — which will create more
expenses for the equipment and pro
duction systems renovations that will
be required by the FCC for a station of
such increased capacity, Ledeen said.
The Legal Counseling Office (LCO)
and KZSU will be requesting fee as
sessment approval on the April 14 and
15 ballot.
Also on the ballot will be a one
quarter assessment of $1 for the prog
ram fee, which is used to fund various
campus organizations. Money from
the fee is distributed by the ASSU Se
nate.
The LCO, located in the Old
Firehouse, is requesting $1 assess
ments for both winter and spring quar
ters.
Nancy Doum, secretary for the LCO,
explained that the office has received
no other funding in its three-year his
tory besides the previous fee assess
ments. The assessments cover the
LCO's average monthly expenses of
$1600.
Consultations
During the past three years, the of
fice has rendered consultations on
students' legal problems concerning
employment, consumer, administra
tive, housing, family, tort and criminal
matters.
LCO statistics reveal that the office,
open four hours ii day. five days a
week, services an average of 5.4 stu
dents per day. This figure has re
mained steady over the past three
years, indicating a continuing need for
its on-campus legal services, accord
ing to the LCO staff.

The office in the past has functioned
to answer any sort of legal question. Its
attorneys have not yet gone to court in
a fee-generating capacity, but inci
dents of petty theft, most often occur
ring in the Stanford Bookstore, have
involved court appearances by one of
the office's attorneys.
Fundamentally, however, the LCO
is a consultation service. As part of its
policy the office does not represent
students against other students, or
against the University.
KZSU
KZSU is asking for a continued fee
assessment of $1 in autumn, winter
and spring quarters.
"The $3 fee assessment is really vital
to keeping us on the air," said station
manager Bill Ledeen.
Under Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) regulations, KZSU
maintains a non-commercial educa
tional status prohibiting the station
from receiving advertising. Ledeen
explained.
This status severely limits KZSU's
possible funding sources, although its
staff feels the station enjoys a more un
ique sound and freedom in production
than does a commercial station, he
said.
Cory Boyan of KZSU's engineering
staff noted that KZSU operations were
funded by a fixed, yearly ASSU as
sessment until the assessment was
abolished in 1970.
Moreover, within an increasingly

tight budget, the University cannot
appropriate substantial funds to the
station as a part of the Communication
Department, Ledeen said.

LCO's average monthly expenses of
$1600.
Consultations
During the past three years, the of
fice has rendered consultations on
students' legal problems concerning
employment, consumer, administra
tive, housing, family, tort and criminal
matters.
LCO statistics reveal that the office,
open four hours ii day. five days a
week, services an average of 5.4 stu
dents per day. This figure has re
mained steady over the past three
years, indicating a continuing need for
its on-campus legal services, accord
ing to the LCO staff.

The office in the past has functioned
to answer any sort of legal question. Its
attorneys have not yet gone to court in
a fee-generating capacity, but inci
dents of petty theft, most often occur
ring in the Stanford Bookstore, have
involved court appearances by one of
the office's attorneys.
Fundamentally, however, the LCO
is a consultation service. As part of its
policy the office does not represent
students against other students, or
against the University.
KZSU
KZSU is asking for a continued fee
assessment of $1 in autumn, winter
and spring quarters.
"The $3 fee assessment is really vital
to keeping us on the air," said station
manager Bill Ledeen.
Under Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) regulations, KZSU
maintains a non-commercial educa
tional status prohibiting the station
from receiving advertising. Ledeen
explained.
This status severely limits KZSU's
possible funding sources, although its
staff feels the station enjoys a more un
ique sound and freedom in production
than does a commercial station, he
said.
Cory Boyan of KZSU's engineering
staff noted that KZSU operations were
funded by a fixed, yearly ASSU as
sessment until the assessment was
abolished in 1970.
Moreover, within an increasingly

tight budget, the University cannot
appropriate substantial funds to the
station as a part of the Communication
Department, Ledeen said.
No underwriting
The University also prohibits KZSIJ
from underwriting expenses by appe
aling to outside organizations, he said.
"Because the University is in a
budget crunch situation, they want to
approach everybody. . . . They don't
want any other Stanford organizations
involving themselves with trying to
get any type of non-profit funding,"
said Ledeen.
Presently, KZSU may only under
write through outside sources if the
donations are unsolicited and are
specifically designated for KZSU
through the University, he added.
Theoretically. KZSU can advertise
on the AM portion of its broadcast,
which is transmitted to the dorms. Ad
vertising on AM has not proven suc
cessful, however, because of the ex
tremely limited AM audience, Ledeen
said.
KZSU, thus feels caught in a bind
between FCC regulations — which
demand maintenance of a high quality
facility without advertising revenues
— and University restrictions against
FM underwriting, he said. The station,
said Ledeen, sees the fee assessment as
being the only viable means of funding
at this time.
The projected budget for the 1977
fiscal year which Ledeen has submit

ted to KZSU's executive committee, is
contingent on a continued $1 per quar
ter fee assessment. Projected expendi
tures totalling $28,500 are similar to
expenditures of $28,015 for the 1976
fiscal year.
According to the budget, about
$27,500 of KZSU's income is expected
to come from an approved fee assess
ment, taking intoaccount a certain loss
from students reclaiming all or part of
their individually paid assessments.
About one third of KZSU's total ex
penses arise from "fixed expenses" —
such as telephones, teletype and two
essential salaried posts — without
which the station could not operate,
Ledeen said.
Besides additional programming
and department expenses. KZSU ex
pects FCC approval soon for a power
increase — from the present 10 watts to
500 watts — which will create more
expenses for the equipment and pro
duction systems renovations that will
be required by the FCC for a station of
such increased capacity, Ledeen said.
