# Economist criticizes Simon's policies
## 
### Alan Shapiro 
Brooking Institute economist Arthur Okun
criticized fiscal methods developed by Secret
ary of the Treasury William Simon in an
economics seminar Wednesday at the
Graduate School of Business.
Dividing Nixon Administration advisers
into two camps, "hawks" and "doves," Okun
categorized Simon as a "hawk."
The "hawks," Okun said, talk like the Na
tion.il Security Council did during the '(iOs re
garding what position to take with Hanoi.
"Their (hawks') hard line is: 'We're in this
mess over tfit; long haul,' and 'We're going to
give it everything and beat inflation,' " Okun
said,.
He described the hawk view as "sheer self
delusion," saying that "it would take about
($5OO billion) to restore economic stability — a
sum that no electorate would buy."
The "doves," on the other hand, "believe
that there will lie only one OPEC (Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries) crisis," in
which the cartel of oil-producing and export
ing countries jack-up prices, thereby upsetting
the economy and throwing many out of work,
Okun said.
The "dove" motto is: "If we concentrate on
the amelioration of unemployment, the infla
tion rate will subside," he said.
According to Okun, " 'stagflation' is a gim
mick. and the only way to beat a gimmick is

with more gimmicks." He proposed a moder
ate package of economic adjustment but av
oided any structural critique of current
economic instability.
Okun also suggested a "Wage Maintenance
Insurance" that would provide income tax re
bates on the first $15,000 earned if the cost of
living exceeded a certain percentage, provid
ing workers signed noninflationary contracts.
Management would receive tax relief if it
maintained noninflationary pricing policies,
he said.
Instead of the value-added tax favored by
Europeans and proposed in the United States
by economist and Newsweek columnist Henry
Wallich as a revenue measure taxing business
transactions, Okun said he would reverse the
procedure, granting value-added subsidies to
businesses.
He said this would stimulate production
levels up to capacity and optimize resource
allocation, thereby insuring that profit price
margins would remain noninflationarv.
Besides supporting the temporary need for a
system of wage control, Okun advocated for
mation of a governmental marketing board for
coordinating agricultural exports modeled
after agencies in Canada and Australia.
"These wheat-exporting countries have'seen
the importance of maintaining a two-tiered
price structure of low national prices and
higher prices pegged for export," Okun said.

sum that no electorate would buy."
The "doves," on the other hand, "believe
that there will lie only one OPEC (Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries) crisis," in
which the cartel of oil-producing and export
ing countries jack-up prices, thereby upsetting
the economy and throwing many out of work,
Okun said.
The "dove" motto is: "If we concentrate on
the amelioration of unemployment, the infla
tion rate will subside," he said.
According to Okun, " 'stagflation' is a gim
mick. and the only way to beat a gimmick is

with more gimmicks." He proposed a moder
ate package of economic adjustment but av
oided any structural critique of current
economic instability.
Okun also suggested a "Wage Maintenance
Insurance" that would provide income tax re
bates on the first $15,000 earned if the cost of
living exceeded a certain percentage, provid
ing workers signed noninflationary contracts.
Management would receive tax relief if it
maintained noninflationary pricing policies,
he said.
Instead of the value-added tax favored by
Europeans and proposed in the United States
by economist and Newsweek columnist Henry
Wallich as a revenue measure taxing business
transactions, Okun said he would reverse the
procedure, granting value-added subsidies to
businesses.
He said this would stimulate production
levels up to capacity and optimize resource
allocation, thereby insuring that profit price
margins would remain noninflationarv.
Besides supporting the temporary need for a
system of wage control, Okun advocated for
mation of a governmental marketing board for
coordinating agricultural exports modeled
after agencies in Canada and Australia.
"These wheat-exporting countries have'seen
the importance of maintaining a two-tiered
price structure of low national prices and
higher prices pegged for export," Okun said.

Brooking Institute economist Arthur Okun
criticized fiscal methods developed by Secret
ary of the Treasury William Simon in an
economics seminar Wednesday at the
Graduate School of Business.
Dividing Nixon Administration advisers
into two camps, "hawks" and "doves," Okun
categorized Simon as a "hawk."
The "hawks," Okun said, talk like the Na
tion.il Security Council did during the '(iOs re
garding what position to take with Hanoi.
"Their (hawks') hard line is: 'We're in this
mess over tfit; long haul,' and 'We're going to
give it everything and beat inflation,' " Okun
said,.
He described the hawk view as "sheer self
delusion," saying that "it would take about
($5OO billion) to restore economic stability — a
sum that no electorate would buy."
The "doves," on the other hand, "believe
that there will lie only one OPEC (Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries) crisis," in
which the cartel of oil-producing and export
ing countries jack-up prices, thereby upsetting
the economy and throwing many out of work,
Okun said.

tion rate will subside," he said.
