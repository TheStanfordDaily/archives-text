BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) â€”
Conservative forces made strong
gains Sunday in Thailand's sec
ond postdictatorship election of
a new National Assembly.
Observers attributed the re
sults to dissatisfaction with
former Prime Minister Kukrit
Pramoj's failure to quell leftist
violence and his decision to
force the withdrawal of most
U.S. troops from the country.
Kukrit, 65, lost his own seat in
the assembly. It appeared that
his older brother, Seni Pramoj,
would be the next prime minis
ter.
With 80 percent of the votes
counted, Seni's rightist Democ
rat party had won 101 of the 179
assembly seats. The rightist,
military-backed Thai Nation
party was second with 47.
There were strong indications
that the two parties would forma
coalition government.
Seni, 70. said he would as
sume the prime minister's post
and seek a coalition with one or
two other parties, i le did not rule
out new negotiations with the
United States to increase the
270-man force of American

military advisers that is to re
main in the country after July,
but he said it was a delicate is
sue.
Military leaders have been
lobbying for a 4000-man Ameri
can force because of the com
munist governments in
neighboring Cambodia and
Laos.
Seni told reporters his

priorities would be to reduce
unemployment, help the farmers
and restore law and order. He
said his foreign policy would be
based on neutrality but with em
phasis on "close relations with
the United States."
Seni, a pre-World War II am
bassador to the United States,
was prime minister for 4V2
months shortly after the war.
