| How often are the sperm replaced, or are they only replaced after
ejaculation?
New sperm are constantly being formed, according to Funda
mentals of Human Sexuality. Atter maturing in the seminiferous
tubules of the testes, they are stored in the epididymis, awaiting
ejaculation. Ejaculation uses up to 600 million sperm at one time,
so the seminiferous tubules are kept busy. If ejaculation does not
occur within 30 to 60 days, the sperm degenerate and are replaced
by new ones.

| Are my birth control pills that 1 bought 2V 2 years ago likely to have
| "gone bad"? Please don't make a mistake on this.
According to the Peer Counseling people, they aren't likely to,
I but don t take chances. At least one brand is g< d for four years, but
| pills probably vary, and the best thing tu do hey say, is to ask a
doctor, preferably the one who prescribed them, or to write the
I company that made them.

Is there really such a thing as a pussy fart? If so, what exactly is it?
I I'm not sure if that's the scientifically accepted term for it, but it is
| true that curious noises do occasionally emanate from the vagina.
They are caused by air that has been trapped inside during foreplay
I or "pumped in' during intercourse, which escapes with a rude
| sound when the women changes position or contracts her vaginal
| muscles.
It is possible to train the muscles of the vagina to do this on
| purpose. One woman has even developed the talent to the point
1 where she can blow out candles from several feet away.
