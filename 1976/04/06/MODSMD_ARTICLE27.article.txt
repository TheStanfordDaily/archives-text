## Exclusive 'Daily' interview Giancarlo Giannini: a cinematic enigma 
### Ann Hoffman 
Italian film actor Giancarlo
Giannini derives a certain
melancholy satisfaction in not
ing that, "for an actor, the capac
ity to communicate is best on the
stage and on the screen, not in
real life."
Cigarette in hand, Giannini
sits in a plush Stanford Court
Hotel suite and attempts, with a
patience that verges on bore
dom, to conduct interviews
through a translator. Wearing
snugly-fitting jeans and a ma
roon sweater, Giannini struggles
to understand questions as they
are asked in English, con
templates them thoughtfully
and resorts occasionally to a
pocket-sized Colliers Italian-
English Dictionary.
As he answers, the famous San
Francisco trolley cars clang re
peatedly on the street below,
partially drowning his words.
Holding his head in his hands,
Giannini mutters, "There is
something about those trolley
cars that could make anybody go
crazy."
Winding up his tour of the Un
ited States, Giannini spent sev
eral days last month in the Bay
Area, promoting Lina Wertmul
ler's latest film, The Seven
Beauties, in which he plays the
leading character. Best known
for his major roles in Wertmul
ler's films (Love and Anarchy,
The Seduction of Mirni and
Swept Away), Giannini plays
characters most notable for their
virility and egotism.
Chauvinism
He may, in fact, succeed in
doing for male chauvinism what
Marilyn Monroe did for the
dumb blonde. While director
Wertmuller, an outspoken polit
ical leftist and a feminist, per
sists in asserting that she creates
chauvinistic male characters in
order to criticize them, the sad
eyed Giannini grows ever more
popular as a romantic lead.
Called on to defend the politi
cal content of The Seven
Beauties, Giannini states that it
is a "perfect" realization of
Wertmuller's ideas. He claims
that like her other films, this
latest work is "problematic" and
does not propose one easy solu
tion to the issues raised. "What
is important for us," he says, "is
that the picture create a discus
sion."
According to Giannini The
Seven Beauties is a film against

war, one "that says perhaps to
live in such a way is not worth
living." He counters'charges that
the film deals in blatant and even
offensive stereotypes by stating
that "cinema is a work of fan
tasy," not a representation of re
ality.
Pasqualino
The story of the main charac
ter. Pasqualino, is based on the
World War II experiences of one
of Lina Wertmuller's crewmen.
Giannini states that the "reality
of this person was so incredible
that no one would believe it."
Therefore, he argues, the film
utilizes exaggeration and the
grotesque to convey the proper
"idea." Although Pasqualino is
"very Italian," Giannini feels
that he represents a kind of
"general" man.
The role of Pasqualino
climaxes over 13 years of stage
and film acting for the 33-year
old G : annini, who received his
degree in electrical engineering
only to enroll directly into the
Academy of Dramatic Art in
Rome. On the stage Giannini has
played various Shakespearean
roles, including the lead in the
award-winning Franco Zeffirelli
production of Romeo and Juliet.
It was through stage acting that
he became acquainted with
Wertmuller.
AlthoughGiannini insists that
he is unlike the characters he has
played in film, he says that he
identifies with them. "They
exist in the moment in which I
attempt to represent them," he
says."It is a game of fantasy
which is only part of my search,
my mind."
Danger
He feels that the characters he
portrays are "more interesting"
than he is. Giannini admits that
the danger of losing himself in
his characters is one of his
"biggest problems" as an actor,
adding that "perhaps my life is a
mixture of all my characters."
On his particular method of
acting, Giannini says, "Gener
ally when a person reads a script
he tries to live with the charac
ter. I leave this part for later. I
like to start from the exterior.
When I read the script I try to
lose my personality.';
He focuses first on the "way in
which the character walks, the
way in which he looks, the way
he combs his hair and the way he
deals with other people. Little by
little, from these rhythms come

the thought."
In talking about the wide
range of emotional nuances he is
able to convey solely through his
eyes, Giannini explains. "Each
of us has a function of the body
which is most expressive in front
of the camera. Chaplin acts with
all his body, from feet to head.
Each actor has to find the right
dimension."
Giannini feels that when we
watch a film, "what acts on our
brain is 82 percent image and
only eight percent voice." The
other 10 percent, he says, is sim
ply lost in transmission.
Giannini believes con
sequently that many film mas
terpieces have been silent.
"Someone said that the eyes are
the mirror of the soul." Insists

Giannini. "It is our ignorance
that makes us talk."
Geniuses
Though he describes both
Charlie Chaplin and Buster
Keaton as "geniuses," Giannini
finds Keaton the more interest
ing of the two for his use of fan
tasy and abstraction. Says Gian
nini, "Keaton always imposes
himself upon a reality which is
not part of his own dimension."
Giannini's own efforts to in
troduce himself into a reality
radically different from his own
is best exemplified, he feels, in
his portrayal of the peasant To
nino of Love and Anarchy, his
favorite role to date. In order to
transform himself for the part,
Giannini wore freckle-like
make-up and put lead in his
shoes to achieve the proper
walk.
"The character (of Tonino)

was something that was created
every day."he says."I like to
play with the public, to make
them aware that I am creating a
fiction. I want the public to play
as I play."
American actors
Giannini follows with interest
the work of what he calls the
"new generation" of American
actors, particularly Dustin
Hoffman and Jack Nicholson.
Such actors, he feels, sustain a
powerful level of communica
tion with the audience.
"It is not difficult for a good
actor to create a good character,
for Dustin Hoffman to play his
role in Midnight Cowboy," he
says."It is more difficult for Dus
tin Hoffman to play the character
of Lenny, because in Lenny there
is a search for something more,

an anguished search."
He adds that "the search for
character has become very diffe
rent in the past few years. It is a
search for force, like delivering a
punch to the camera lens."
Progression
Maintaining that he has not
become a "type" character (cap
able of playing only virile Ita
lians), Giannini says he has
made a slight progression in his
roles toward the type of interpre
tation done by Hoffman and
Nicholson.
His latest role as the lead in
Luchino Visconti's as yet unre
leased film The Innocents re
quires that he play a character
"entirely filled with anguish."
SaysGiannini, "Only in this way
is the character interesting for
me to play."
"This is a story about a mons
ter, like Pasqualino, a man who

kills a newborn child and then
kills himself." While he has been
requested many times to play a
serious character such as Vis
conti's Tullio Hegmil, Giannini
says that he prefers to play
characters who are both tragic
and comic.
"Life is neither tragic nor
comic but a blend." he states. "I
don't like pictures in which no
one ever laughs. 1 love films
which express life completely."
Directing
Giannini himself plans to di
rect a film, possibly within the
next several months, and says he
will not consider acting in an
American film for at least
another two years.
Giannini claims to be ambiva
lent about his rapidly ascending
career. Presently married to
former actress Livia Giampalmo
who lives in Koine with their two
sons, Giannini says he is uncer
tain about his future, but feels
that "the beauty of life is never
knowing what will happen."
As for what he wants from life,
Giannini admits, "1 would like
someone to tell me." But, he
adds, "When someone says he
wants something out of life it is
just a pretext that keeps him
alive."
Skepticism
For all his skepticism, the
burdens of success do not weigh
onGiannini all the time. Appear
ing at Stanford the evening after
the interview, Giannini seems to
shake off his subdued demeanor
upon recovering his medium of
communication — the stage.
Accompanied by actress
girlfriend Marissa Berenson (the
striking and silent Lady Lyndon
of Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyn
don), Giannini addresses a full
audience at Cubberley Au
ditorium. With a gesture that re
calls a moment in The Seven
Beauties, Giannini debonairly
places a red flower in his lapel.
He then proceeds to field ques
tions from the audience.
Asked how it feels to be a "sex
symbol," Giannini says the
term has never been applied to
him in Italy. He muses, "Perhaps
I should live in America."
Dream
When questioned about his
"dream" as an actor, he has a
ready response. If he could begin
again, Giannini saysas a child he
would playGhrist. as an adult he
would act as Hamlet and as an
old man he would evolve into
Santa Glaus. Though it is too late
for the first role, Giannini, al
ready a star of considerable in
ternational stature, will undoub
tedly have sufficient opportun
ity to prove whether he is indeed
an actor for all seasons.

partially drowning his words.
Holding his head in his hands,
Giannini mutters, "There is
something about those trolley
cars that could make anybody go
crazy."
Winding up his tour of the Un
ited States, Giannini spent sev
eral days last month in the Bay
Area, promoting Lina Wertmul
ler's latest film, The Seven
Beauties, in which he plays the
leading character. Best known
for his major roles in Wertmul
ler's films (Love and Anarchy,
The Seduction of Mirni and
Swept Away), Giannini plays
characters most notable for their
virility and egotism.
Chauvinism
He may, in fact, succeed in
doing for male chauvinism what
Marilyn Monroe did for the
dumb blonde. While director
Wertmuller, an outspoken polit
ical leftist and a feminist, per
sists in asserting that she creates
chauvinistic male characters in
order to criticize them, the sad
eyed Giannini grows ever more
popular as a romantic lead.
Called on to defend the politi
cal content of The Seven
Beauties, Giannini states that it
is a "perfect" realization of
Wertmuller's ideas. He claims
that like her other films, this
latest work is "problematic" and
does not propose one easy solu
tion to the issues raised. "What
is important for us," he says, "is
that the picture create a discus
sion."
According to Giannini The
Seven Beauties is a film against

war, one "that says perhaps to
live in such a way is not worth
living." He counters'charges that
the film deals in blatant and even
offensive stereotypes by stating
that "cinema is a work of fan
tasy," not a representation of re
ality.
Pasqualino
The story of the main charac
ter. Pasqualino, is based on the
World War II experiences of one
of Lina Wertmuller's crewmen.
Giannini states that the "reality
of this person was so incredible
that no one would believe it."
Therefore, he argues, the film
utilizes exaggeration and the
grotesque to convey the proper
"idea." Although Pasqualino is
"very Italian," Giannini feels
that he represents a kind of
"general" man.
The role of Pasqualino
climaxes over 13 years of stage
and film acting for the 33-year
old G : annini, who received his
degree in electrical engineering
only to enroll directly into the
Academy of Dramatic Art in
Rome. On the stage Giannini has
played various Shakespearean
roles, including the lead in the
award-winning Franco Zeffirelli
production of Romeo and Juliet.
It was through stage acting that
he became acquainted with
Wertmuller.
AlthoughGiannini insists that
he is unlike the characters he has
played in film, he says that he
identifies with them. "They
exist in the moment in which I
attempt to represent them," he
says."It is a game of fantasy
which is only part of my search,
my mind."
Danger
He feels that the characters he
portrays are "more interesting"
than he is. Giannini admits that
the danger of losing himself in
his characters is one of his
"biggest problems" as an actor,
adding that "perhaps my life is a
mixture of all my characters."
On his particular method of
acting, Giannini says, "Gener
ally when a person reads a script
he tries to live with the charac
ter. I leave this part for later. I
like to start from the exterior.
When I read the script I try to
lose my personality.';
He focuses first on the "way in
which the character walks, the
way in which he looks, the way
he combs his hair and the way he
deals with other people. Little by
little, from these rhythms come

the thought."
In talking about the wide
range of emotional nuances he is
able to convey solely through his
eyes, Giannini explains. "Each
of us has a function of the body
which is most expressive in front
of the camera. Chaplin acts with
all his body, from feet to head.
Each actor has to find the right
dimension."
Giannini feels that when we
watch a film, "what acts on our
brain is 82 percent image and
only eight percent voice." The
other 10 percent, he says, is sim
ply lost in transmission.
Giannini believes con
sequently that many film mas
terpieces have been silent.
"Someone said that the eyes are
the mirror of the soul." Insists

Giannini. "It is our ignorance
that makes us talk."
Geniuses
Though he describes both
Charlie Chaplin and Buster
Keaton as "geniuses," Giannini
finds Keaton the more interest
ing of the two for his use of fan
tasy and abstraction. Says Gian
nini, "Keaton always imposes
himself upon a reality which is
not part of his own dimension."
Giannini's own efforts to in
troduce himself into a reality
radically different from his own
is best exemplified, he feels, in
his portrayal of the peasant To
nino of Love and Anarchy, his
favorite role to date. In order to
transform himself for the part,
Giannini wore freckle-like
make-up and put lead in his
shoes to achieve the proper
walk.
"The character (of Tonino)

was something that was created
every day."he says."I like to
play with the public, to make
them aware that I am creating a
fiction. I want the public to play
as I play."
American actors
Giannini follows with interest
the work of what he calls the
"new generation" of American
actors, particularly Dustin
Hoffman and Jack Nicholson.
Such actors, he feels, sustain a
powerful level of communica
tion with the audience.
"It is not difficult for a good
actor to create a good character,
for Dustin Hoffman to play his
role in Midnight Cowboy," he
says."It is more difficult for Dus
tin Hoffman to play the character
of Lenny, because in Lenny there
is a search for something more,

an anguished search."
He adds that "the search for
character has become very diffe
rent in the past few years. It is a
search for force, like delivering a
punch to the camera lens."
Progression
Maintaining that he has not
become a "type" character (cap
able of playing only virile Ita
lians), Giannini says he has
made a slight progression in his
roles toward the type of interpre
tation done by Hoffman and
Nicholson.
His latest role as the lead in
Luchino Visconti's as yet unre
leased film The Innocents re
quires that he play a character
"entirely filled with anguish."
SaysGiannini, "Only in this way
is the character interesting for
me to play."
"This is a story about a mons
ter, like Pasqualino, a man who

kills a newborn child and then
kills himself." While he has been
requested many times to play a
serious character such as Vis
conti's Tullio Hegmil, Giannini
says that he prefers to play
characters who are both tragic
and comic.
"Life is neither tragic nor
comic but a blend." he states. "I
don't like pictures in which no
one ever laughs. 1 love films
which express life completely."
Directing
Giannini himself plans to di
rect a film, possibly within the
next several months, and says he
will not consider acting in an
American film for at least
another two years.
Giannini claims to be ambiva
lent about his rapidly ascending
career. Presently married to
former actress Livia Giampalmo
who lives in Koine with their two
sons, Giannini says he is uncer
tain about his future, but feels
that "the beauty of life is never
knowing what will happen."
As for what he wants from life,
Giannini admits, "1 would like
someone to tell me." But, he
adds, "When someone says he
wants something out of life it is
just a pretext that keeps him
alive."
Skepticism
For all his skepticism, the
burdens of success do not weigh
onGiannini all the time. Appear
ing at Stanford the evening after
the interview, Giannini seems to
shake off his subdued demeanor
upon recovering his medium of
communication — the stage.
Accompanied by actress
girlfriend Marissa Berenson (the
striking and silent Lady Lyndon
of Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyn
don), Giannini addresses a full
audience at Cubberley Au
ditorium. With a gesture that re
calls a moment in The Seven
Beauties, Giannini debonairly
places a red flower in his lapel.
He then proceeds to field ques
tions from the audience.
Asked how it feels to be a "sex
symbol," Giannini says the
term has never been applied to
him in Italy. He muses, "Perhaps
I should live in America."
Dream
When questioned about his
"dream" as an actor, he has a
ready response. If he could begin
again, Giannini saysas a child he
would playGhrist. as an adult he
would act as Hamlet and as an
old man he would evolve into
Santa Glaus. Though it is too late
for the first role, Giannini, al
ready a star of considerable in
ternational stature, will undoub
tedly have sufficient opportun
ity to prove whether he is indeed
an actor for all seasons.

dumb blonde. While director
Wertmuller, an outspoken polit
ical leftist and a feminist, per
sists in asserting that she creates
chauvinistic male characters in
order to criticize them, the sad
eyed Giannini grows ever more
popular as a romantic lead.
Called on to defend the politi
cal content of The Seven
Beauties, Giannini states that it
is a "perfect" realization of
Wertmuller's ideas. He claims
that like her other films, this
latest work is "problematic" and
does not propose one easy solu
tion to the issues raised. "What
is important for us," he says, "is
that the picture create a discus
sion."
According to Giannini The
Seven Beauties is a film against

war, one "that says perhaps to
live in such a way is not worth
living." He counters'charges that
the film deals in blatant and even
offensive stereotypes by stating
that "cinema is a work of fan
tasy," not a representation of re
ality.
Pasqualino
The story of the main charac
ter. Pasqualino, is based on the
World War II experiences of one
of Lina Wertmuller's crewmen.
Giannini states that the "reality
of this person was so incredible
that no one would believe it."
Therefore, he argues, the film
utilizes exaggeration and the
grotesque to convey the proper
"idea." Although Pasqualino is
"very Italian," Giannini feels
that he represents a kind of
"general" man.
The role of Pasqualino
climaxes over 13 years of stage
and film acting for the 33-year
old G : annini, who received his
degree in electrical engineering
only to enroll directly into the
Academy of Dramatic Art in
Rome. On the stage Giannini has
played various Shakespearean
roles, including the lead in the
award-winning Franco Zeffirelli
production of Romeo and Juliet.
It was through stage acting that
he became acquainted with
Wertmuller.
AlthoughGiannini insists that
he is unlike the characters he has
played in film, he says that he
identifies with them. "They
exist in the moment in which I
attempt to represent them," he
says."It is a game of fantasy
which is only part of my search,
my mind."
Danger
He feels that the characters he
portrays are "more interesting"
than he is. Giannini admits that
the danger of losing himself in
his characters is one of his
"biggest problems" as an actor,
adding that "perhaps my life is a
mixture of all my characters."
On his particular method of
acting, Giannini says, "Gener
ally when a person reads a script
he tries to live with the charac
ter. I leave this part for later. I
like to start from the exterior.
When I read the script I try to
lose my personality.';
He focuses first on the "way in
which the character walks, the
way in which he looks, the way
he combs his hair and the way he
deals with other people. Little by
little, from these rhythms come

the thought."
In talking about the wide
range of emotional nuances he is
able to convey solely through his
eyes, Giannini explains. "Each
of us has a function of the body
which is most expressive in front
of the camera. Chaplin acts with
all his body, from feet to head.
Each actor has to find the right
dimension."
Giannini feels that when we
watch a film, "what acts on our
brain is 82 percent image and
only eight percent voice." The
other 10 percent, he says, is sim
ply lost in transmission.
Giannini believes con
sequently that many film mas
terpieces have been silent.
"Someone said that the eyes are
the mirror of the soul." Insists

Giannini. "It is our ignorance
that makes us talk."
Geniuses
Though he describes both
Charlie Chaplin and Buster
Keaton as "geniuses," Giannini
finds Keaton the more interest
ing of the two for his use of fan
tasy and abstraction. Says Gian
nini, "Keaton always imposes
himself upon a reality which is
not part of his own dimension."
Giannini's own efforts to in
troduce himself into a reality
radically different from his own
is best exemplified, he feels, in
his portrayal of the peasant To
nino of Love and Anarchy, his
favorite role to date. In order to
transform himself for the part,
Giannini wore freckle-like
make-up and put lead in his
shoes to achieve the proper
walk.
"The character (of Tonino)

was something that was created
every day."he says."I like to
play with the public, to make
them aware that I am creating a
fiction. I want the public to play
as I play."
American actors
Giannini follows with interest
the work of what he calls the
"new generation" of American
actors, particularly Dustin
Hoffman and Jack Nicholson.
Such actors, he feels, sustain a
powerful level of communica
tion with the audience.
"It is not difficult for a good
actor to create a good character,
for Dustin Hoffman to play his
role in Midnight Cowboy," he
says."It is more difficult for Dus
tin Hoffman to play the character
of Lenny, because in Lenny there
is a search for something more,

an anguished search."
He adds that "the search for
character has become very diffe
rent in the past few years. It is a
search for force, like delivering a
punch to the camera lens."
Progression
Maintaining that he has not
become a "type" character (cap
able of playing only virile Ita
lians), Giannini says he has
made a slight progression in his
roles toward the type of interpre
tation done by Hoffman and
Nicholson.
His latest role as the lead in
Luchino Visconti's as yet unre
leased film The Innocents re
quires that he play a character
"entirely filled with anguish."
SaysGiannini, "Only in this way
is the character interesting for
me to play."
"This is a story about a mons
ter, like Pasqualino, a man who

kills a newborn child and then
kills himself." While he has been
requested many times to play a
serious character such as Vis
conti's Tullio Hegmil, Giannini
says that he prefers to play
characters who are both tragic
and comic.
"Life is neither tragic nor
comic but a blend." he states. "I
don't like pictures in which no
one ever laughs. 1 love films
which express life completely."
Directing
Giannini himself plans to di
rect a film, possibly within the
next several months, and says he
will not consider acting in an
American film for at least
another two years.
Giannini claims to be ambiva
lent about his rapidly ascending
career. Presently married to
former actress Livia Giampalmo
who lives in Koine with their two
sons, Giannini says he is uncer
tain about his future, but feels
that "the beauty of life is never
knowing what will happen."
As for what he wants from life,
Giannini admits, "1 would like
someone to tell me." But, he
adds, "When someone says he
wants something out of life it is
just a pretext that keeps him
alive."
Skepticism
For all his skepticism, the
burdens of success do not weigh
onGiannini all the time. Appear
ing at Stanford the evening after
the interview, Giannini seems to
shake off his subdued demeanor
upon recovering his medium of
communication — the stage.
Accompanied by actress
girlfriend Marissa Berenson (the
striking and silent Lady Lyndon
of Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyn
don), Giannini addresses a full
audience at Cubberley Au
ditorium. With a gesture that re
calls a moment in The Seven
Beauties, Giannini debonairly
places a red flower in his lapel.
He then proceeds to field ques
tions from the audience.
Asked how it feels to be a "sex
symbol," Giannini says the
term has never been applied to
him in Italy. He muses, "Perhaps
I should live in America."
Dream
When questioned about his
"dream" as an actor, he has a
ready response. If he could begin
again, Giannini saysas a child he
would playGhrist. as an adult he
would act as Hamlet and as an
old man he would evolve into
Santa Glaus. Though it is too late
for the first role, Giannini, al
ready a star of considerable in
ternational stature, will undoub
tedly have sufficient opportun
ity to prove whether he is indeed
an actor for all seasons.

exhibits the suave stare that has melted many a young lass' heart.
Italian film actor Giancarlo
Giannini derives a certain
melancholy satisfaction in not
ing that, "for an actor, the capac
ity to communicate is best on the
stage and on the screen, not in
real life."
Cigarette in hand, Giannini
sits in a plush Stanford Court
Hotel suite and attempts, with a
patience that verges on bore
dom, to conduct interviews
through a translator. Wearing
snugly-fitting jeans and a ma
roon sweater, Giannini struggles
to understand questions as they
are asked in English, con
templates them thoughtfully
and resorts occasionally to a
pocket-sized Colliers Italian-
English Dictionary.
As he answers, the famous San
Francisco trolley cars clang re
peatedly on the street below,
partially drowning his words.
Holding his head in his hands,
Giannini mutters, "There is
something about those trolley
cars that could make anybody go
crazy."
Winding up his tour of the Un
ited States, Giannini spent sev
eral days last month in the Bay
Area, promoting Lina Wertmul
ler's latest film, The Seven
Beauties, in which he plays the
leading character. Best known
for his major roles in Wertmul
ler's films (Love and Anarchy,
The Seduction of Mirni and
Swept Away), Giannini plays
characters most notable for their
virility and egotism.

live in such a way is not worth
living." He counters'charges that
the film deals in blatant and even
offensive stereotypes by stating
that "cinema is a work of fan
tasy," not a representation of re
ality.
Pasqualino
The story of the main charac
ter. Pasqualino, is based on the
World War II experiences of one
of Lina Wertmuller's crewmen.
Giannini states that the "reality
of this person was so incredible
that no one would believe it."
Therefore, he argues, the film
utilizes exaggeration and the
grotesque to convey the proper
"idea." Although Pasqualino is
"very Italian," Giannini feels
that he represents a kind of
"general" man.
The role of Pasqualino
climaxes over 13 years of stage
and film acting for the 33-year
old G : annini, who received his
degree in electrical engineering
only to enroll directly into the
Academy of Dramatic Art in
Rome. On the stage Giannini has
played various Shakespearean
roles, including the lead in the
award-winning Franco Zeffirelli
production of Romeo and Juliet.
It was through stage acting that
he became acquainted with
Wertmuller.
AlthoughGiannini insists that
he is unlike the characters he has
played in film, he says that he
identifies with them. "They
exist in the moment in which I
attempt to represent them," he
says."It is a game of fantasy
which is only part of my search,
my mind."
Danger
He feels that the characters he
portrays are "more interesting"
than he is. Giannini admits that
the danger of losing himself in
his characters is one of his
"biggest problems" as an actor,
adding that "perhaps my life is a
mixture of all my characters."
On his particular method of
acting, Giannini says, "Gener
ally when a person reads a script
he tries to live with the charac
ter. I leave this part for later. I
like to start from the exterior.
When I read the script I try to
lose my personality.';
He focuses first on the "way in
which the character walks, the
way in which he looks, the way
he combs his hair and the way he
deals with other people. Little by
little, from these rhythms come

the thought."
In talking about the wide
range of emotional nuances he is
able to convey solely through his
eyes, Giannini explains. "Each
of us has a function of the body
which is most expressive in front
of the camera. Chaplin acts with
all his body, from feet to head.
Each actor has to find the right
dimension."
Giannini feels that when we
watch a film, "what acts on our
brain is 82 percent image and
only eight percent voice." The
other 10 percent, he says, is sim
ply lost in transmission.
Giannini believes con
sequently that many film mas
terpieces have been silent.
"Someone said that the eyes are
the mirror of the soul." Insists

Giannini. "It is our ignorance
that makes us talk."
Geniuses
Though he describes both
Charlie Chaplin and Buster
Keaton as "geniuses," Giannini
finds Keaton the more interest
ing of the two for his use of fan
tasy and abstraction. Says Gian
nini, "Keaton always imposes
himself upon a reality which is
not part of his own dimension."
Giannini's own efforts to in
troduce himself into a reality
radically different from his own
is best exemplified, he feels, in
his portrayal of the peasant To
nino of Love and Anarchy, his
favorite role to date. In order to
transform himself for the part,
Giannini wore freckle-like
make-up and put lead in his
shoes to achieve the proper
walk.
"The character (of Tonino)

was something that was created
every day."he says."I like to
play with the public, to make
them aware that I am creating a
fiction. I want the public to play
as I play."
American actors
Giannini follows with interest
the work of what he calls the
"new generation" of American
actors, particularly Dustin
Hoffman and Jack Nicholson.
Such actors, he feels, sustain a
powerful level of communica
tion with the audience.
"It is not difficult for a good
actor to create a good character,
for Dustin Hoffman to play his
role in Midnight Cowboy," he
says."It is more difficult for Dus
tin Hoffman to play the character
of Lenny, because in Lenny there
is a search for something more,

an anguished search."
He adds that "the search for
character has become very diffe
rent in the past few years. It is a
search for force, like delivering a
punch to the camera lens."
Progression
Maintaining that he has not
become a "type" character (cap
able of playing only virile Ita
lians), Giannini says he has
made a slight progression in his
roles toward the type of interpre
tation done by Hoffman and
Nicholson.
His latest role as the lead in
Luchino Visconti's as yet unre
leased film The Innocents re
quires that he play a character
"entirely filled with anguish."
SaysGiannini, "Only in this way
is the character interesting for
me to play."
"This is a story about a mons
ter, like Pasqualino, a man who

kills a newborn child and then
kills himself." While he has been
requested many times to play a
serious character such as Vis
conti's Tullio Hegmil, Giannini
says that he prefers to play
characters who are both tragic
and comic.
"Life is neither tragic nor
comic but a blend." he states. "I
don't like pictures in which no
one ever laughs. 1 love films
which express life completely."
Directing
Giannini himself plans to di
rect a film, possibly within the
next several months, and says he
will not consider acting in an
American film for at least
another two years.
Giannini claims to be ambiva
lent about his rapidly ascending
career. Presently married to
former actress Livia Giampalmo
who lives in Koine with their two
sons, Giannini says he is uncer
tain about his future, but feels
that "the beauty of life is never
knowing what will happen."
As for what he wants from life,
Giannini admits, "1 would like
someone to tell me." But, he
adds, "When someone says he
wants something out of life it is
just a pretext that keeps him
alive."
Skepticism
For all his skepticism, the
burdens of success do not weigh
onGiannini all the time. Appear
ing at Stanford the evening after
the interview, Giannini seems to
shake off his subdued demeanor
upon recovering his medium of
communication — the stage.
Accompanied by actress
girlfriend Marissa Berenson (the
striking and silent Lady Lyndon
of Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyn
don), Giannini addresses a full
audience at Cubberley Au
ditorium. With a gesture that re
calls a moment in The Seven
Beauties, Giannini debonairly
places a red flower in his lapel.
He then proceeds to field ques
tions from the audience.
Asked how it feels to be a "sex
symbol," Giannini says the
term has never been applied to
him in Italy. He muses, "Perhaps
I should live in America."
Dream
When questioned about his
"dream" as an actor, he has a
ready response. If he could begin
again, Giannini saysas a child he
would playGhrist. as an adult he
would act as Hamlet and as an
old man he would evolve into
Santa Glaus. Though it is too late
for the first role, Giannini, al
ready a star of considerable in
ternational stature, will undoub
tedly have sufficient opportun
ity to prove whether he is indeed
an actor for all seasons.

STUD BARES ALL — Italv's super-slick Giancarlo Giannini
exhibits the suave stare that has melted many a young lass' heart.
Italian film actor Giancarlo
Giannini derives a certain
melancholy satisfaction in not
ing that, "for an actor, the capac
ity to communicate is best on the
stage and on the screen, not in
real life."
Cigarette in hand, Giannini
sits in a plush Stanford Court
Hotel suite and attempts, with a
patience that verges on bore
dom, to conduct interviews
through a translator. Wearing
snugly-fitting jeans and a ma
roon sweater, Giannini struggles
to understand questions as they
are asked in English, con
templates them thoughtfully
and resorts occasionally to a
pocket-sized Colliers Italian-
English Dictionary.
As he answers, the famous San
Francisco trolley cars clang re
peatedly on the street below,
partially drowning his words.
Holding his head in his hands,
Giannini mutters, "There is
something about those trolley
cars that could make anybody go
crazy."
Winding up his tour of the Un
ited States, Giannini spent sev
eral days last month in the Bay
Area, promoting Lina Wertmul
ler's latest film, The Seven
Beauties, in which he plays the
leading character. Best known
for his major roles in Wertmul
ler's films (Love and Anarchy,
The Seduction of Mirni and
Swept Away), Giannini plays
characters most notable for their
virility and egotism.
Chauvinism
He may, in fact, succeed in
doing for male chauvinism what
Marilyn Monroe did for the
dumb blonde. While director
Wertmuller, an outspoken polit
ical leftist and a feminist, per
sists in asserting that she creates
chauvinistic male characters in
order to criticize them, the sad
eyed Giannini grows ever more
popular as a romantic lead.
Called on to defend the politi
cal content of The Seven
Beauties, Giannini states that it
is a "perfect" realization of
Wertmuller's ideas. He claims
that like her other films, this
latest work is "problematic" and
does not propose one easy solu
tion to the issues raised. "What
is important for us," he says, "is
that the picture create a discus
sion."
According to Giannini The
Seven Beauties is a film against

war, one "that says perhaps to

climaxes over 13 years of stage
and film acting for the 33-year
old G : annini, who received his
degree in electrical engineering
only to enroll directly into the
Academy of Dramatic Art in
Rome. On the stage Giannini has
played various Shakespearean
roles, including the lead in the
award-winning Franco Zeffirelli
production of Romeo and Juliet.
It was through stage acting that
he became acquainted with
Wertmuller.
AlthoughGiannini insists that
he is unlike the characters he has
played in film, he says that he
identifies with them. "They
exist in the moment in which I
attempt to represent them," he
says."It is a game of fantasy
which is only part of my search,
my mind."
Danger
He feels that the characters he
portrays are "more interesting"
than he is. Giannini admits that
the danger of losing himself in
his characters is one of his
"biggest problems" as an actor,
adding that "perhaps my life is a
mixture of all my characters."
On his particular method of
acting, Giannini says, "Gener
ally when a person reads a script
he tries to live with the charac
ter. I leave this part for later. I
like to start from the exterior.
When I read the script I try to
lose my personality.';
He focuses first on the "way in
which the character walks, the
way in which he looks, the way
he combs his hair and the way he
deals with other people. Little by
little, from these rhythms come

the thought."
In talking about the wide
range of emotional nuances he is
able to convey solely through his
eyes, Giannini explains. "Each
of us has a function of the body
which is most expressive in front
of the camera. Chaplin acts with
all his body, from feet to head.
Each actor has to find the right
dimension."
Giannini feels that when we
watch a film, "what acts on our
brain is 82 percent image and
only eight percent voice." The
other 10 percent, he says, is sim
ply lost in transmission.
Giannini believes con
sequently that many film mas
terpieces have been silent.
"Someone said that the eyes are
the mirror of the soul." Insists

Giannini. "It is our ignorance
that makes us talk."
Geniuses
Though he describes both
Charlie Chaplin and Buster
Keaton as "geniuses," Giannini
finds Keaton the more interest
ing of the two for his use of fan
tasy and abstraction. Says Gian
nini, "Keaton always imposes
himself upon a reality which is
not part of his own dimension."
Giannini's own efforts to in
troduce himself into a reality
radically different from his own
is best exemplified, he feels, in
his portrayal of the peasant To
nino of Love and Anarchy, his
favorite role to date. In order to
transform himself for the part,
Giannini wore freckle-like
make-up and put lead in his
shoes to achieve the proper
walk.
"The character (of Tonino)

was something that was created
every day."he says."I like to
play with the public, to make
them aware that I am creating a
fiction. I want the public to play
as I play."
American actors
Giannini follows with interest
the work of what he calls the
"new generation" of American
actors, particularly Dustin
Hoffman and Jack Nicholson.
Such actors, he feels, sustain a
powerful level of communica
tion with the audience.
"It is not difficult for a good
actor to create a good character,
for Dustin Hoffman to play his
role in Midnight Cowboy," he
says."It is more difficult for Dus
tin Hoffman to play the character
of Lenny, because in Lenny there
is a search for something more,

an anguished search."
He adds that "the search for
character has become very diffe
rent in the past few years. It is a
search for force, like delivering a
punch to the camera lens."
Progression
Maintaining that he has not
become a "type" character (cap
able of playing only virile Ita
lians), Giannini says he has
made a slight progression in his
roles toward the type of interpre
tation done by Hoffman and
Nicholson.
His latest role as the lead in
Luchino Visconti's as yet unre
leased film The Innocents re
quires that he play a character
"entirely filled with anguish."
SaysGiannini, "Only in this way
is the character interesting for
me to play."
"This is a story about a mons
ter, like Pasqualino, a man who

kills a newborn child and then
kills himself." While he has been
requested many times to play a
serious character such as Vis
conti's Tullio Hegmil, Giannini
says that he prefers to play
characters who are both tragic
and comic.
"Life is neither tragic nor
comic but a blend." he states. "I
don't like pictures in which no
one ever laughs. 1 love films
which express life completely."
Directing
Giannini himself plans to di
rect a film, possibly within the
next several months, and says he
will not consider acting in an
American film for at least
another two years.
Giannini claims to be ambiva
lent about his rapidly ascending
career. Presently married to
former actress Livia Giampalmo
who lives in Koine with their two
sons, Giannini says he is uncer
tain about his future, but feels
that "the beauty of life is never
knowing what will happen."
As for what he wants from life,
Giannini admits, "1 would like
someone to tell me." But, he
adds, "When someone says he
wants something out of life it is
just a pretext that keeps him
alive."
Skepticism
For all his skepticism, the
burdens of success do not weigh
onGiannini all the time. Appear
ing at Stanford the evening after
the interview, Giannini seems to
shake off his subdued demeanor
upon recovering his medium of
communication — the stage.
Accompanied by actress
girlfriend Marissa Berenson (the
striking and silent Lady Lyndon
of Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyn
don), Giannini addresses a full
audience at Cubberley Au
ditorium. With a gesture that re
calls a moment in The Seven
Beauties, Giannini debonairly
places a red flower in his lapel.
He then proceeds to field ques
tions from the audience.
Asked how it feels to be a "sex
symbol," Giannini says the
term has never been applied to
him in Italy. He muses, "Perhaps
I should live in America."
Dream
When questioned about his
"dream" as an actor, he has a
ready response. If he could begin
again, Giannini saysas a child he
would playGhrist. as an adult he
would act as Hamlet and as an
old man he would evolve into
Santa Glaus. Though it is too late
for the first role, Giannini, al
ready a star of considerable in
ternational stature, will undoub
tedly have sufficient opportun
ity to prove whether he is indeed
an actor for all seasons.

STUD BARES ALL — Italv's super-slick Giancarlo Giannini
exhibits the suave stare that has melted many a young lass' heart.
Italian film actor Giancarlo
Giannini derives a certain
melancholy satisfaction in not
ing that, "for an actor, the capac
ity to communicate is best on the
stage and on the screen, not in
real life."
Cigarette in hand, Giannini
sits in a plush Stanford Court
Hotel suite and attempts, with a
patience that verges on bore
dom, to conduct interviews
through a translator. Wearing
snugly-fitting jeans and a ma
roon sweater, Giannini struggles
to understand questions as they
are asked in English, con
templates them thoughtfully
and resorts occasionally to a
pocket-sized Colliers Italian-
English Dictionary.
As he answers, the famous San
Francisco trolley cars clang re
peatedly on the street below,
partially drowning his words.
Holding his head in his hands,
Giannini mutters, "There is
something about those trolley
cars that could make anybody go
crazy."
Winding up his tour of the Un
ited States, Giannini spent sev
eral days last month in the Bay
Area, promoting Lina Wertmul
ler's latest film, The Seven
Beauties, in which he plays the
leading character. Best known
for his major roles in Wertmul
ler's films (Love and Anarchy,
The Seduction of Mirni and
Swept Away), Giannini plays
characters most notable for their
virility and egotism.
Chauvinism
He may, in fact, succeed in
doing for male chauvinism what
Marilyn Monroe did for the
dumb blonde. While director
Wertmuller, an outspoken polit
ical leftist and a feminist, per
sists in asserting that she creates
chauvinistic male characters in
order to criticize them, the sad
eyed Giannini grows ever more
popular as a romantic lead.
Called on to defend the politi
cal content of The Seven
Beauties, Giannini states that it
is a "perfect" realization of
Wertmuller's ideas. He claims
that like her other films, this
latest work is "problematic" and
does not propose one easy solu
tion to the issues raised. "What
is important for us," he says, "is
that the picture create a discus
sion."
According to Giannini The
Seven Beauties is a film against

war, one "that says perhaps to
live in such a way is not worth
living." He counters'charges that
the film deals in blatant and even
offensive stereotypes by stating
that "cinema is a work of fan
tasy," not a representation of re
ality.
Pasqualino
The story of the main charac
ter. Pasqualino, is based on the
World War II experiences of one
of Lina Wertmuller's crewmen.
Giannini states that the "reality
of this person was so incredible
that no one would believe it."
Therefore, he argues, the film
utilizes exaggeration and the
grotesque to convey the proper
"idea." Although Pasqualino is
"very Italian," Giannini feels
that he represents a kind of
"general" man.
The role of Pasqualino
climaxes over 13 years of stage
and film acting for the 33-year
old G : annini, who received his
degree in electrical engineering
only to enroll directly into the
Academy of Dramatic Art in
Rome. On the stage Giannini has
