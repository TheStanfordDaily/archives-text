# Picks of the flicks: 'Inserts' disappointing
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
At first glance, Inserts looks
like a fascinating movie, the story
of Boy Wonder, a has-been Hol
lywood director in 1930 reduced
to making pornographic movies
— albeit brilliant pornographic
movies. Inserts fails miserably
its initial promise.
It is a long and static piece of
philosophic drivel. Taking place
solely in the mansion of Boy
Wonder (Richard Dreyfuss in a
flashy yet ultimately shallow in
terpretation), it most closely re
sembles the first act of a play that
never allows itself to develop
into anything solid or interest
ing.
It might be pointed out that
/)og Duy Afternoon also takes
place in virtually one place, but
that film had action to propel it.
Inserts has nothing of its com
pelling force.
There are five characters —
besides Boy Wonder, there are
Harlene and Rex, stars of the
porno films shot on a bed in a
corner of Boy Wonder's living
room. Harlene is on her way
down, and Rex is on his way up.
Big Mac is the producer whose

great entrepreneurial dreams in
clude gas stations and. ironi
cally, hamburger stands
alongside the freeways that are
sprouting in Los Angeles. Cathy
Cake is Big Mac's girlfriend, a
mysteriously profound child
woman who takes the film down
to its depths of depravity and ul
timate confusion.
Empty
Outside the mansion there is
Clark Cable, who is dying to
have Boy Wonder direct him in a
film. There is also an empty
block of mansions, everyone
having moved .out of the
neighborhood.
The mechanical clicking
noises that occasionally float
onto the soundtrack are one of
two things. They are either
bulldozers destroying the man
sions tor a freeway, thus sym
bolizing the destruction sur
lounding Boy Wonder's life, or
they are the clickings of a film
camera or projector, emphasiz
ing how much Boy Wonder's life
is tied up in film.
The fact that the noise can't
really be distinguished as any
thing definite is indicative of the

entire movie's outlook — it can't
really be pinned down as any
thing definitive.
The characters spend the bet
ter part of two hours talking at
each other, trading extremely
heavy remarks. They are so
heavy, and so profound, and so
plentiful, that after a while they
begin to tumble over each other,
until none of them has any sig
nificance at all.
One keeps expecting someone
to say something that will tie all
the loose ends together, but it
never comes. Especially when
Miss Cake says, "But what are
inserts?" one hopes B.W. will
explain the whole mess. Unfor
tunately, his answer is both un
satifsying and simplistic.
Stanford
Keeping track of each charac
ter's philosophy and the various
profundities they intermittently
spout is as simple as going four
years at Stanford without study
ing. Since the characters never
do anything besides talk, we
never get to see them putting
their philosophy into action.
Attempts to synthesize every
thing we have learned are fruit

less because we never get to
measure the character's words
against their actions and thus
understand them most com
pletely.
Boy Wonder talks at Harlene,
Cathy Cake talks at Boy Wonder,
but no connections are ever
made. While the first half of the
film is carefully constructed, all
the work goes to naught because
the second half ambles along so
carelessly.
Inserts is a film peculiarly de
void of a climax, or, in the end,
any real fascination for its
characters who simply seem

created to talk, like tape recor
ders which only know how to
say what has been fed into them.
Camera
Writer-director John Byrum
(who wrote Mahogany, which is
as different from Inserts as black
is from white) is adept at keeping
his camera in motion on a con
fined set. but has sacrificed an
important aspect of translating
Boy Wonder's life by confining
him to his mansion.
Richard Dreyfuss combines all
the charming features of Curt
Hendricks, Duddv kravitz and
Matt Hooper to come up with an
unimpressive, unemotional car

bon copy of everything he's done
before.
Jessica Harper plays Cathy
with a listless relaxation,
saddled with too many words
that make too little sense. Ver
onica Cartwright captures the
image of the fallen glamour girl
Harlene rather well, but not per
fectly. Regrettably, the best ac
tors in the film are in it the least.
Bob Hoskins as Big Mac and
Stephen Davies as Rex turn in
the most captivating perfor
mances. both charming and
comedic, far above the quality of
the screenplay.
