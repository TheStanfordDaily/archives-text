Answers:
1. C. Clark Gable won theOscarfor It Happened
One Night in 1935, at which time he was already a
big star at MGM. It became apparent from this
scene, though, that he had not yet become a major
success, which means the scene could not have
taken place any later than 1932, at least.
2. B. How clairvoyant of Carole Lombard to refer
to John Wayne as the Duke when he hadn't even
scored his major success. By now you should have
gotten the message thatGob/e and Lombard isn't
reeking with accuracy.
3. B. According to the movie, Lombard snuck
onto the set of Gone With The Wind to see Gable's
love scene with Vivien Leigh. Brolin is wearing a
suit: in the original, Gable has discarded his coat.
This sloppiness is inexcuseable since prints of
Gone With The Wind are readily available to
check the accuracy of this scene. The R rating
referred to in (D) comes from Lombard's horny
nature.
4. A. Why anyone as big as Gable would hang
around with a mousy publicist who seems to have
nothing better to do than play pool is beyond me.
5. D. When the shadows hit Brolin correctly he
is the spitting image of Clark Gable. For most of
the film he is believable but never really convinc
ing. He is too scrawny to have a true physical
resemblance, but his make-up could have
changed that. He is probably the only person who
could tackle the role, considering its impossibil
ity.
Brolin had to try and perfect one of the most
familiar and best-loved personalities of the last
40 years. Sometimes he pulls it off. Other times
he's got all the grace Paul Lynde would have in.
the role. He's not Gable, but neither is anybody
else.
6. C. Korshak and Furie also made Lady Sings
The Blues with Diana Ross and Billy Dee Williams
with as much accuracy. Also on their record is the
infamous Sheila Levine Is Dead And Living In
New York, with Roy Scheiderand Jeannie Berlin.
