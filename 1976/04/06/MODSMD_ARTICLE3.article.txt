# Libertarian speaks out

Have you ever heard of a candidate
for (he U.S. Senate who agrees with
Barry Goldwater on Social Security
and with Tom Hayden on foreign pol
icy?
If you have, you're probably familiar
with the California Libertarian Party or
have otherwise heard of their candi
date. Lynn Kinsky, who announced
that she was running for the U.S. Se
nate in a San Francisco press confer
ence yesterday afternoon.
The thread that runs through Kins
kv's political philosophy, and that of
Libertarians generally, is opposition to
government interference in any sphere
of life whatever.
"People are deciding that there's a

lot of government they don't need and
can't afford," Kinsky said in a meeting
of the Stanford chapter of the Young
Libertarian Alliance last night.
This attitude determines her stand
on taxes ("Ultimately I'd like to see
them all eliminated."), welfare ("I'd
like to stop mandating programs onto
the states and cities."), and drug use
("People have the right to eat shit if
they want.").
Schizophrenic
Taken from the traditional liberal
conservative standpoint, these stands
are almost schizophrenic, and Kinsky
is well aware of this: "I can make pacts
with either liberals or conservatives,
depending on what the issue is." she
said.

One tiling Kinsky won't do is com
promise her Libertarian principles.
"I've taken a policy of coming on
strong, taking extreme stands on is
sues," she said. "I find that sometimes
works better than blandness."
As an example of this strategy, she
cited the campaign she ran last year for
a seat on the Santa Barbara County
school board. One of her proposals was
elimination of compulsory attendance
for school children.
"People asked me, 'Won't the kids
grow up illiterate that way?' and I
answered, 'They're not too well off
now. under the present system.' "
She received approximately 3500
votes; even though Kinsky lost, she did
