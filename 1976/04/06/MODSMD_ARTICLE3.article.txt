# Libertarian speaks out

Have you ever heard of a candidate
for (he U.S. Senate who agrees with
Barry Goldwater on Social Security
and with Tom Hayden on foreign pol
icy?
If you have, you're probably familiar
with the California Libertarian Party or
have otherwise heard of their candi
date. Lynn Kinsky, who announced
that she was running for the U.S. Se
nate in a San Francisco press confer
ence yesterday afternoon.
The thread that runs through Kins
kv's political philosophy, and that of
Libertarians generally, is opposition to
government interference in any sphere
of life whatever.
"People are deciding that there's a

lot of government they don't need and
can't afford," Kinsky said in a meeting
of the Stanford chapter of the Young
Libertarian Alliance last night.
This attitude determines her stand
on taxes ("Ultimately I'd like to see
them all eliminated."), welfare ("I'd
like to stop mandating programs onto
the states and cities."), and drug use
("People have the right to eat shit if
they want.").
Schizophrenic
Taken from the traditional liberal
conservative standpoint, these stands
are almost schizophrenic, and Kinsky
is well aware of this: "I can make pacts
with either liberals or conservatives,
depending on what the issue is." she
said.

One tiling Kinsky won't do is com
promise her Libertarian principles.
"I've taken a policy of coming on
strong, taking extreme stands on is
sues," she said. "I find that sometimes
works better than blandness."
As an example of this strategy, she
cited the campaign she ran last year for
a seat on the Santa Barbara County
school board. One of her proposals was
elimination of compulsory attendance
for school children.
"People asked me, 'Won't the kids
grow up illiterate that way?' and I
answered, 'They're not too well off
now. under the present system.' "
She received approximately 3500
votes; even though Kinsky lost, she did
a .11 >
much better than she had been ex
pected to, she said.
Tax strike organizer
The school board race wasn't the
end of Kinsky in Santa Barbara poli
tics. She next made herself felt as a
leading organizer of the "property tax
strike" there.
"The tax strike started with a group
of older people whose houses were
reassessed," she said.
"These were people living on fixed
incomes,and most of them couldn't af
ford the increase. They got very mad
about it and tried to complain to the
party officials, and the county gave
them the old runaround," said Kinskv.

The disgruntled citizens, about 1000
of them, went on a tax strike and en
listed Kinsky's aid.
"They got me to walk around Santa
Barbara wearing an anti-tax sign. It
was a gas. 1 got to meet a lot of people.
Lots of times young kids, who didn't
even own homes, would give me the
clenched-fist sign as they walked past.
It really amazed me," she said.
Kinsky said she expects to get "up to
five percent" of the vote but noted,
"There are some people who are not
Libertarians who think I can win."
She commented, "It would be fun to
go to Washington. I would like to go to
the Senate and generally raise hell."
