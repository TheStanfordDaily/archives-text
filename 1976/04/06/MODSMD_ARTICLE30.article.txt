# BTO blasts virgin ears
## 
### Mark Simonian 
The answer is 16.
The question: "What was the
average age of the Bachman
Turner Overdrive fans at Winter
land last Friday night?"
Yep, it was a teeny-bopper af
fair — and the music, most
of it loud, heavy metal trash,
wasn't worth the over-inflated
price of the Winterland refresh
ments.
But the crowd loved Bachman
Turner Overdrive (BTO). And 1
have to admit that I've rarely
seen such an enthusiastic, total
response in an audience.
Rockin' crowd
It seemed like absolutely
everyone on the nearly packed
Winterland floor was up, rockin'
and clapping to the beat.
Everyone except me, I guess.
BTO's music is unsophisti
cated, with droning guitars, a
heavy rhythm and not much
else. The group has two
guitarists, a bassist and a drum
mer.
The group has had several
top-40 hits, gold singles and the
like. Songs like "You Ain't Seen
Nothin' Yet" and "Takin' Care of
Business" came off well in con
cert, but the lack of vocal har
monies and of varied instrumen
tation (like keyboard parts) was
disappointing.
Exciting encore
BTO's encore was particularly
exciting. They began with "Four
Wheel Drive" (title cut from
their second album) and then the
three instrumentalists left the
stage, leaving the drummer to
his flashy solo.
The three guitarists rejoined
their drummer for arockin'ren
dition of the group's biggest
single hit, "Takin' Care of Busi
ness."
BTO's hits were the highlights
of a show that began with two
competent, yet totally opposite
opening acts.
Styx began the concert with
loud, throbbing, glitter music
that almost turned me off.
Beautiful rendition
But a beautiful vocal and in
strumental rendition of their
top-40 hit "Lady" changed my
initial impression, and by the
end of their performance. I was

into their energetic style.
It was still too loud, though,
probably a feature of the bar-like
acoustics that Winterland is
famous for.
Styx got the audience to its
feet several times, but their en
core, "Light Up" brought the
teeny-boppers into a rhythmical,
almost gospel clapping that was
magic. Even 1 joined in.
Contrast
Wishbone Ash provided a per
fect contrast to the jumping

super-glitter act that they fol
lowed. Laid-back, mellow, yet
thoroughly competent and tight.
Wishbone Ash's performance
was pleasant and artistic.
1 had to resist the temptation to
nod off during a few of their
numbers, however. Most of the
band's songs were twice as long
as they needed to be.
Even though the songs were
lengthy, the audience relaxed
during the group's performance
and generally enjoyed their part
of the show.

magic. Even 1 joined in.
Contrast
Wishbone Ash provided a per
fect contrast to the jumping

super-glitter act that they fol
lowed. Laid-back, mellow, yet
thoroughly competent and tight.
Wishbone Ash's performance
was pleasant and artistic.
1 had to resist the temptation to
nod off during a few of their
numbers, however. Most of the
band's songs were twice as long
as they needed to be.
Even though the songs were
lengthy, the audience relaxed
during the group's performance
and generally enjoyed their part
of the show.

The question: "What was the
average age of the Bachman
Turner Overdrive fans at Winter
land last Friday night?"
Yep, it was a teeny-bopper af
fair — and the music, most
of it loud, heavy metal trash,
wasn't worth the over-inflated
price of the Winterland refresh
ments.
But the crowd loved Bachman
Turner Overdrive (BTO). And 1
have to admit that I've rarely
seen such an enthusiastic, total
response in an audience.
Rockin' crowd
It seemed like absolutely
everyone on the nearly packed
Winterland floor was up, rockin'
and clapping to the beat.
Everyone except me, I guess.
BTO's music is unsophisti
cated, with droning guitars, a
heavy rhythm and not much
else. The group has two
guitarists, a bassist and a drum
mer.
The group has had several
top-40 hits, gold singles and the
like. Songs like "You Ain't Seen
Nothin' Yet" and "Takin' Care of
Business" came off well in con
cert, but the lack of vocal har
monies and of varied instrumen
tation (like keyboard parts) was
disappointing.
Exciting encore
BTO's encore was particularly
exciting. They began with "Four
Wheel Drive" (title cut from
their second album) and then the
three instrumentalists left the
stage, leaving the drummer to
his flashy solo.
The three guitarists rejoined
their drummer for arockin'ren
dition of the group's biggest
single hit, "Takin' Care of Busi
ness."
BTO's hits were the highlights
of a show that began with two
competent, yet totally opposite
opening acts.
Styx began the concert with
loud, throbbing, glitter music
that almost turned me off.
Beautiful rendition
But a beautiful vocal and in
strumental rendition of their
top-40 hit "Lady" changed my
initial impression, and by the
end of their performance. I was

into their energetic style.
It was still too loud, though,
probably a feature of the bar-like
acoustics that Winterland is
famous for.
Styx got the audience to its
feet several times, but their en
core, "Light Up" brought the
teeny-boppers into a rhythmical,
almost gospel clapping that was
magic. Even 1 joined in.
