# Graham troupe offers polished performance
## 
### John Roos 
The legendary Martha Graham
visited San Francisco last week
and bedazzled four full houses at
the Curran Theatre.
Graham, who revolutionized
modern dance as dramatically as
Picasso altered art. introduced
her troupe on opening night. She
sat on-stage as gracefully as a
bird and as elegantly as a
duchess, as she discussed her
half-century career in dance.
Born in Allegheny, Fa.,
Graham moved at an early age to
Santa Barbara where she began
to teach herself about the art
form that she would soon re
volutionize as dramatically as
the Beatles altered the art-form
of rock 'n' roll.
Graham was always a controv
ersial figure. At one time she in
itiated a scandal by announcing
that she never allowed any vir
gins in her dance troupe.
But in her later years, Graham
has been praised as a true genius,
and last year, at a gala affair in
her honor, an entire Broadway
audience rose to their feet led by
Graham's former student Betty
Ford.
The audience at the Curran
was just as enthusiastic, as
Graham's small but powerful
company presented a number of
her original pieces.
The show opened with
"Seraphic Dialogue," a dramatic
choreographic interpretation of
the legend of Saint Joan. The
piece used three dancers to play
the part of Joan, as the dance di
vided her life into three distinct
parts: young girl, warrior, and
martyr.
The choreography, although it
did not appear to be as earth
sflattering as it did many years
ago, still is emotional as ever.
The highlight of the evening
was one of Graham's earliest
pieces, "Lamentation." A dance
about grief, a feeling which
Martha Graham termed "the
most universal of all emotions,"
"Lamentation" was danced by a
single solitary dancer sitting on
a bench on a stark stage.
The dancer was wrapped in a
long and clinging shroud and
her limbs pushed against the
sheer and elastic material as she
moved.
