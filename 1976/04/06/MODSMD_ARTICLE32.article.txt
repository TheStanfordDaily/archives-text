demonstrated in Peking's main square yesterday to protest
the removal of wreaths honoring the late Premier Chou

under criticism as a "capitalist-roader."

WASHINGTON — Former Army Lt. William L. Calley,
convicted of murdering at least 22 Vietnamese villagers at

Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans reinstating Gal
ley's 1971 court-martial conviction.
Calley, 32, who has been free on bail in Columbus, Ga.
was reported en route to Spokane, Wash, to make a
speech.
His lawyer, ).J. Houston Gordon of Covingtonn, Tenn.,
said in a telephone interview that the Army had assured
him Calley "will be placed upon parole and will continue
to live the life that he is presently living."
There was no immediate comment from the Pentagon
but the Army has said previously it does not plan to return
Calley to prison.
Calley has been free since his conviction was over
turned on Sept. 25. 1974, by U.S. District Judge J, Robert
Elliott of Columbus, Ga., in a decision later reversed by
the Circuit Court.
Soliah mistrial motion rejected
SACRAMENTO — A federal judge in the Steven Soliah
bank robbery trial rejected a defense mistrial motion
yesterday which stemmed from the display of three guns
seized when Patricia Hearst was arrested.
Defense attorney Sheldon Otis angrily told U.S. District
Court Judge Philip Wilkins it was "the court's duty to
prevent the prosecution from flagrantly" displaying the
two carbines and sawed-off shotgun before the jury.
But Wilkins said the shotgun was admissible because a
witness had earlier stated that one of the robbers in a
$15,000 heist here had used a sawed-off shotgun.
