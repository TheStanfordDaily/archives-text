# Guest prof denied visa
## 
### 
Trotskyite Belgian economist Ernest
Mandel, scheduled to be an ASSIJ
guest professor this quarter, was de
nied a visa by the State Department
yesterday.
The action, taken under provisions
of the McCarren-Walter Immigration
and Nationalization Act which per
mits persons labeled as "Com
munists" to be excluded from the Un
ited States, was taken despite appeals
from President Richard Lyman and the
local chapter of the American Associa
tion of University Professors (AAUP)
that Mandel be allowed to enter.
Lyman's legal adviser, James
Siena, who said the University's attor
ney in Washington, D.C., "was not
given any reason" for the denial aside
from earlier objections to Mandel's
left-wing views, said the University is
not contemplating any appeal.
ASSU Guest Professorship Board
member Andrea Halliday, who attri
buted the decision to Leonard Walen
tynowicz, the State Department's ad
ministrator of the Bureau of Security
and Consular Affairs, said the action
was "a reflection of an election-year
hardening of the.Ford Administra
tion" in keeping leftists from entering
the country.
Education Prof. Robert Textor, pres
ident of the local AAUP chapter, called
the decision "a travesty on academic
and civil freedom" adding that "if the
ASSU wants to contest this, they might
want to spread this invitation over to
next fall" and continue to "make an
issue of this."
llalliday cautioned that "the energy
is burning out" of the Guest Professor
ship Board, but said there was "a dis
tinct possibility that the board will go
to the ASSU Senate and try to extend
the invitation."
