# 'Tuition' yet to pay for hay
## 
### Kathy Batts 
Seven students are in financial
straits because of "Our Tuition" — and
they're selling T-shirts to help them
selves out.
"Save The Horse — Our Tuition" is
emblazoned across the front of the
shirts which went on sale in White
Plaza Registration Day. The shirts sell
for $3 apiece, gleaning about a $1 pro
fit for the entrepreneurs.
Our Tuition is the name of a
racehorse. Six Stanfordites and a Uni
versity of Santa Clara student bought
the two-year-old filly last fall, in hopes
that purse winnings would help put
them through school.
The owners have yet to see any pro
fit. but they've been spending a lot of
money on hay. Our Tuition's debut
was scheduled for mid-March at Gol
den Gate Fields, but a strike there
spoiled any hopes for an early return.
The filly, out of training for over a
month, won't be ready to race again
until June.
Finals week starter
"She should start racing right
around finals week," says junior

Chuck Harding, one of the co-owners.
The horse is slated to run once a week
through June and July on the county
fair circuit.
Meanwhile, bills have to be paid.
Our Tuition was running up a tab of
$20 a day for room and board at the
Oak Tree Farm in Livermore Valley.
She has since been moved back to Gol
den Gate Fields, where sympathetic
trainer Jack Evenson is charging only
$l!i per day.
Only 30 T-shirts have been sold so
far. The vendors caught the flu after
only one day of business, forcing them
to deal out of their home office in Man
zanita 31-W. They hope to sell at least
100 shirts.
Other Stanford owners of Our Tui
tion include juniors Scooter
Townsend, Charles Masch, John Rus
sell, A 1 Nicoraand senior Gary Malka
sian. Mike Adza, a junior at Santa
Clara, is also part of the business ven
ture, which operates under the stable
name of "Seven-Card Studs."
Favorable reaction
Harding says student reaction to the
shirt-selling has been favorable. "It's

kind of like giving to your favorite
charity, only people will get to see the
return on the horse," he says.
Parental reaction has been some
thing else. "Right now my mom is just
kind of saying i told you so,' " Hard
ing says. "She keeps tugging at my
shirtsleeve and telling me I'm going to
lose it."
Townsend has been avoiding the
issue as much as possible with his pa
rents. "They were pretty upset when
we first bought her. I keep assuring
them that everything will be okay and
she's going to win when she starts rac
ing."
Malkasian. who's been going to the
races since he was 16, said his parents
kind of laughed when he first told
them about the plan to buy the horse.
"But then they said okay," he said.
"They've even offered to help us out."
Footing the hill
The owners have been footing the
bill for the horse so far. The original
purchase price of $1500 has not yet
been paid.
"We bought the horse on consign-
