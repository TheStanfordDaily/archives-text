# Slate emphasizes reform
## 
### Lori Matsukawa First of four parts 
Emphasizing tenure, restructuring the ASSU Senate
and reforming committee selection procedures of the
nominations committee, members of the Council of Presi
dents (COP) slate headed by Vic Petroff say Ihey do not
believe in classifying themselves as either student advo
cates or student delegates.
"We don't want to be classified," said Petroff, a junior in
economics. "I think it is wrong to classify ourselves. Being
advocates and delegates are both part of the job. There is
no conflict between them."
The slate, which also includes Carole Houck. Deric Jen
nings and A 1 Tomaszczuk. emphasizes working within
established university structures to achieve reforms, par
ticularly on the tenure issue.
"What we specifically propose is to get information to
undergraduate associations and all other concerned stu
dent groups as to who's coming up for tenure. This way.
students can have input into teaching decisions early, and
not after the fact." said Tomaszczuk. a junior in interna
tional relations.
The slate also emphasizes the important role of under
graduate associations as links between the students, se
nate and COP.
"We don't want to establish undergraduate associations
just to establish them," said Houck. a sophomore in art
design. "We have to overcome the apathy problem by

telling students, 'yes — they will have input (into de
partmental matters).' "
To restructure the ASSU Senate the slate recommends
having candidates run as senators associated with certain
University committees.
"For example, you could run as a senator under the
Committee on Services to Students (COSS)." explained
Houck, a current ASSI 1 senator. "This is going to strike up
a closer relationship between the committee and the se
nate."
Pointing out that "the committees have more than one
opening for student members," Houck said, "We don't
feel (having a senator on the committee) limits student
input,"
Tomaszczuk said having senators involved with
specific committees would "beef up the quality of senate
debate."
To de-politicize committee elections by the nomina
tions committee, Jennings, a graduate student in
economics and a current ASSU senator, said, "We would
like to publicize criteria that the committee on nomina
tions can use to justify their appointments."
The criteria "would also provide some methods of
reevaluating the people who currently serve on the com
mittees." said Tomaszczuk, former COSS member and
1974-75 chairperson of the COSS subcommittee on resi
dences.

design. "We have to overcome the apathy problem by

telling students, 'yes — they will have input (into de
partmental matters).' "
To restructure the ASSU Senate the slate recommends
having candidates run as senators associated with certain
University committees.
"For example, you could run as a senator under the
Committee on Services to Students (COSS)." explained
Houck, a current ASSI 1 senator. "This is going to strike up
a closer relationship between the committee and the se
nate."
Pointing out that "the committees have more than one
opening for student members," Houck said, "We don't
feel (having a senator on the committee) limits student
input,"
Tomaszczuk said having senators involved with
specific committees would "beef up the quality of senate
debate."
To de-politicize committee elections by the nomina
tions committee, Jennings, a graduate student in
economics and a current ASSU senator, said, "We would
like to publicize criteria that the committee on nomina
tions can use to justify their appointments."
The criteria "would also provide some methods of
reevaluating the people who currently serve on the com
mittees." said Tomaszczuk, former COSS member and
1974-75 chairperson of the COSS subcommittee on resi
dences.

Emphasizing tenure, restructuring the ASSU Senate
and reforming committee selection procedures of the
nominations committee, members of the Council of Presi
dents (COP) slate headed by Vic Petroff say Ihey do not
believe in classifying themselves as either student advo
cates or student delegates.
"We don't want to be classified," said Petroff, a junior in
economics. "I think it is wrong to classify ourselves. Being
advocates and delegates are both part of the job. There is
no conflict between them."
The slate, which also includes Carole Houck. Deric Jen
nings and A 1 Tomaszczuk. emphasizes working within
established university structures to achieve reforms, par
ticularly on the tenure issue.
"What we specifically propose is to get information to
undergraduate associations and all other concerned stu
dent groups as to who's coming up for tenure. This way.
students can have input into teaching decisions early, and
not after the fact." said Tomaszczuk. a junior in interna
tional relations.
The slate also emphasizes the important role of under
graduate associations as links between the students, se
nate and COP.
"We don't want to establish undergraduate associations
just to establish them," said Houck. a sophomore in art
design. "We have to overcome the apathy problem by
