## Kissinger's threats 
### 
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's
recent warnings of United States "retali
ation" in the event that Cuban troops
should intervene in Zimbabwe
(Rhodesia) represent a step in the wrong
direction for United States foreign pol
icy.
This is true for a number of reasons.
First, it is typical of the "communists are
always wrong" theory which was so evi
dent in the covert and pointless assis
tance which the United States govern
ment rendered in Angola. Few people
would argue that lan Smith's minority
white regime deserves to govern Zim
babwe's black majority; the United
States has gone on record in support of
"majority rule" in that nation.
Yet Kissinger, and the entire Ford ad
ministration, seem more interested in
opposing Cuban forces than in fighting
for what the United States ostensibly be
lieves. So although the Secretary of State
has not spelled out what "retaliation"
the United States would undertake

against Cuba if that state chose to fight
for liberation in Zimbabwe, such retalia
tion misses the point entirely.
Since the early 19605, Africa has been
something of a showcase of young na
tions throwing off fetters of
neocolonialism. Few nations have de
feated Western capitalism without out
side assistance; if powerful Western na
tions take one side in a conflict, this is
naturally to be expected.
The United States has traditionally
taken the wrong side in these conflicts,
often apparently supporting military
dictatorships after a nation finally has
become independent. The U.S. line on
Zimbabwe — which Kissinger insists on
calling Rhodesia — reflects this trend.
The government of the United States
should be working for peace and free
dom. Neither cause will be served by
threatening a much smaller nation
which, while not always peaceful, is at
least fighting on the right side.
