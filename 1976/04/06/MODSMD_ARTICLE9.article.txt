# Unions threaten society

While at home over the recent
quarter break, I took some time to
watch thecyclops. 1 was amused
to observe during the plethora of
advertisements one which was
an obvious public relations ef
fort by the Ladies Garment Mak
ers Union (LGMU), an AFL-CIO
affiliate.
To think the unions havecome
to the point where they, like bus
iness, must indulge in public re
lations to maintain a favorable
image in the minds of the
populace! Upon reflection I was
encouraged to think that
perhaps labor leaders were com
ing out of their self-centered
"more for us and to hell with the
rest of 'em" point of view.
My hopes seem premature
however. This week there are
three major strikes being con
ducted around the country.
I do not purport to know the
details involved in these dis
putes. but I do see a common ef
fect of the actions taken by these
people. San Francisco's crafts'
pay dispute serves as an exam
ple.
.25 percent
Here some 1900-2000 people,
representing about .25 percent of
the city's population, asssuming

they do live in the city, are on
strike. I question whether such
an obvious minority should be
allowed to disrupt the lives of
the majority for personal mo
tives!
This case is particularly well
defined because the voters by a
2-to-l majority mandated the
issue be settled in a specific
manner. The unions now
suggest that these feelings be
forgotten if the citizens know
what is good for them.
A second example is the
Teamsters' strike.
It is a fact that the majority of
freight traffic in this country is
moved by truck. The strike will,
among other things, halt a good
portion of this movment, thereby
causing delay and perhaps shut
down in industries dependent
on delivery of material.
The automotive industry
began such shutdowns last Fri
day, with concurrent layoffs. In
this case about .2 percent of this
nation's population can disrupt
the lives of the overwhelming
majority by striking.
'Us versus them'
The question I ask is, when
will organized labor realize that
they can no longer view the

world in an "us versus them"
manner? Put another way, when
will they stop being self
centered and demonstrate re
sponsibility to the society which
allows them to exist?
Heretofore, organized labor
has failed to recognize that they
make a contribution to the
ever-mounting payments, prices
and taxes which we all must pay
for goods and services. This is
why I take some encouragement
from the public relations effort of
the LGMU mentioned earlier.
They begin by saying that
union members are people
whose problems in life are simi
lar to the viewers', but they then
revert, implying that the viewer
should therefore understand the
union's obviously self-centered
actions. Because of similar
examples before the public eye
in the past few years fewer
people are placing confidence in
such contradictory behaviors.
If labor is to truly win the con
fidence of the people of this
land, they must begin by acting
in a responsible manner to all of
society and not just their mem
berships.
