# Horton sees no priority problem
## 
### Stephen Crolius 
An apparent conflict between the
Guaranteed Housing Flan and the
present residence priority system
will not be "a problem," according
to Assoc. Dean of Students Larry
Horton.
In an interview yesterday, Horton
said the Guaranteed Housing Plan,
which assures upperclassmen
space in an on-campus residence
for two out of their three non
freshman years, has been running
smoothly this year.
The conflict between the plan, in
itiated with the Class of '78, and
present residence priority seemed
to lie in the possibility that too
many students would have priority
for the same house in the same year.
This could happen if a great
number of students returned from
their non-guaranteed year with
priority for the residence they had
left one year before, but not enough
space was created in that residence
by current residents either choos
ing to take their off-cainpus year or
leaving the house for other reasons.
No conflict
"There is not a conflict (between
guaranteed housing and residence

priority),'' said Horton. The
"Guaranteed Housing Plan merely
pertains to one's right to live on
campus," he explained, while the
present residence priority "is only a
priority and not a guarantee."
"There are certain situations that
can arise where you have more
people who have a priority than are
spaces in a house," he admitted, but
added that he did not anticipate this
happening on a significant scale.
Horton said that he has not made
a final decision on the recommen
dation that the present residence
priority be abolished for all stu
dents entering the University in
September 1976 and later.
However, he called the recom
mendation "sound" and said he
thinks it should be adopted. The re
commendation was made to Horton
on Dec. 1, 1975 by the Committee
on Student Services (COSS) sub
committee on residential educa
tion.
Feminist theme house
Horton also said that a location
for the proposed coed feminist
theme house has not been found,
but that the house's sponsors are
still looking. "The initiative (to lo

cate a site for the house) rests with
its proponents," he said«
Horton pointed out that the
1976-77 residence draw books are
being distributed in the residences
this week. The draw book has been
completely rewritten this year and
gives full explanations of the
Guaranteed Housing Plan, the
fraternity rush and room and board
requirements.
Descriptions of each under
graduate housing option and an
explanation of the 1976 spring
housing draw are also included in
the book.

leaving the house for other reasons.
No conflict
"There is not a conflict (between
guaranteed housing and residence

priority),'' said Horton. The
"Guaranteed Housing Plan merely
pertains to one's right to live on
campus," he explained, while the
present residence priority "is only a
priority and not a guarantee."
"There are certain situations that
can arise where you have more
people who have a priority than are
spaces in a house," he admitted, but
added that he did not anticipate this
happening on a significant scale.
Horton said that he has not made
a final decision on the recommen
dation that the present residence
priority be abolished for all stu
dents entering the University in
September 1976 and later.
However, he called the recom
mendation "sound" and said he
thinks it should be adopted. The re
commendation was made to Horton
on Dec. 1, 1975 by the Committee
on Student Services (COSS) sub
committee on residential educa
tion.
Feminist theme house
Horton also said that a location
for the proposed coed feminist
theme house has not been found,
but that the house's sponsors are
still looking. "The initiative (to lo

cate a site for the house) rests with
its proponents," he said«
Horton pointed out that the
1976-77 residence draw books are
being distributed in the residences
this week. The draw book has been
completely rewritten this year and
gives full explanations of the
Guaranteed Housing Plan, the

An apparent conflict between the
Guaranteed Housing Flan and the
present residence priority system
will not be "a problem," according
to Assoc. Dean of Students Larry
Horton.
In an interview yesterday, Horton
said the Guaranteed Housing Plan,
which assures upperclassmen
space in an on-campus residence
for two out of their three non
freshman years, has been running
smoothly this year.
The conflict between the plan, in
itiated with the Class of '78, and
present residence priority seemed
to lie in the possibility that too
many students would have priority
for the same house in the same year.
This could happen if a great
number of students returned from
their non-guaranteed year with
priority for the residence they had
left one year before, but not enough
space was created in that residence
by current residents either choos
ing to take their off-cainpus year or
leaving the house for other reasons.
No conflict
"There is not a conflict (between
guaranteed housing and residence

priority),'' said Horton. The
"Guaranteed Housing Plan merely
