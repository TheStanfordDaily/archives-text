# Solution to housing shortage
## 
### 
President Richard Lyman sat
at his desk, practicing hand ges
tures for an upcoming speech.
He cleared his throat.
"And so, illustrious alumni,
that is why your dear old alma
mater needs more contributions
from you. Furthermore, "
Suddenly, Lyman's office
door shot open. "All right boys,
bring that bed in here," said a
voice from the hall. Two Stan
ford workmen puffed through
the doorway, carrying a bed.
Lyman jumped up from his
desk. "Wait a minute. What's
going on here? You can't barge
in here like that. And what's
with the bed?"
Housing dean Larry Horton,
the voice from the hall, strolled
into the office. "Hey, hey, cool
your jets, Dick. We're only im
plementing the new student
housing policy."
Lyman looked puzzled. "I
don't remember hearing about
any new student housing pol
icy," he said.
'Inspiration'
Horton sat down on top of Ly
man's mahogany desk. "One
night," Horton said, "I got an in
spiration. I figured out how to
solve the whole housing prob
lem. It was so brilliant, I decided
to implement it on my own."
Horton walked over to Lyman's
crystal brandy decanter and
poured himself a drink. He con

tinued.
"Stanford does not have
enough dorm space to house all
of its students. I started to think,
though, that Stanford has many
buildings that are used only a
few hours a day during the week
and remain empty the rest of the
time.
"Think of all the space availa
ble in classrooms, labs, au
ditoriums and offices. So, I
thought, 'why not move some
students into the classrooms and
offices and use these rooms as
dorms in their off hours.' During
the day, when the rooms would
be used for their original pur
pose, all the students would be
off at class. It's a foolproof sys
tem."
Lyman stroked his chin and
looked more perplexed than
ever. "Well, your plan sounds
very nice. Now, explain to me
why you're in my office."
'Had a draw'
"Very simple," answered the
housing dean, "we had a draw,
and some student picked your
office as his living area. You'll
just have to share with him."
Lyman walked over to Horton
and put his arm around his
shoulder. "Now, Larryâ€”l may
call you Larry? Isn't there some
other solution to the housing
shortage? I'm your friend, and
you don't want to see you r friend
lose his office, do you? Do you

have any other ideas, Larry?"
"Yes, I do," replied Horton.
"Students want to live closer to
campus. Most of Stanford's un
developed land is pretty far
away from the center of campus.
So, 1 thought, why not build un
derground dorms?

"I got the idea riding on MART
a few weeks ago. Think of it. A
subterranean system of dorms. It
would revolutionize land use. I
even thought of some names for
the new underground dorms:
Flo Mole, Wilbury and Paloama.
"But then," said Horton, "the
simplest solution would be to
build more dorms, on the sur
face, that is."
Lyman leaped from his seat.
"What, are you crazy? Stanford
is an institute of higher educa
tion, and that costs money.
Dorms don't bring in govern
ment contracts or research en
dowments. Libraries and labs
do. Besides, do you think Presi
dent Ford would fly all the wav

to Stanford to dedicate a new
dorm?"
Lyman pleaded. "But, can't 1
get an office for myself? I am
president of this university.
What about the three new Row
Mo houses?"
"Are you interested in Ameri
can Studies?"
"Not really," replied Lyman.
"What about Italy? Are you in
terested in Italy?"
"I'm allergic to pepperoni."
"Sorry, but you'll have to fight
it out with everyone else for a
place in the third house.
"Hey, things aren't that bad,"
H-orton shrugged. "Just today, I
received a great offer for some
off-campus housing. Listen:
'Retired railroad m;ign;ite seeks
roommate to share modest stone
cottage. 1 don't move around too
much and am a great listener.
Roommate must like sphinxes; 1
have two of them. Call me and
ask for Leland.' "
"No, I don't want to live
there," said Lyman.
"Well, that's all I can do for
you," sighed Horton.
"I understand Larry. Maybe I
can put a desk in my Mercedes."
"That would be fine," said
1 lorton, "but make sure you have
a parking permit."
