Unfair labels
I was mildly surprised by the
March 30 front-page Daily inter
view with Edward Teller, and
somewhat encouraged that the
Stanford community might after
all get the other view on nuclear
power in this newspaper. How
ever, that encouragement faded
when the followups included a
nuclear plant caricature, an in
terview with Dale Bridenbaugh
and two anti-Teller letters.
As for the letters from Mike
Robb and Rachelle Marshall, I
really take exception to charges
of immorality and lack of social
conscience on the part of en
gineers.
Engineers are not baby-killers
and in fact are sensitive to the
social effect of their work. After
all, the ultimate purpose of en
gineering is to help cope with
societal problems arising from
the development of humanity,
and engineers have a right to be
proud of their accomplishments.
The thousands of men and
women who continue to work
for the development of peaceful
uses of nuclear energy have no
thing to gain by destroying a
world they have helped to build.
On the contrary, they believe

that nuclear energy is one of the
least environmentally harmful
and cheapest alternatives avail
able right now.
A great lesson we learned from
the days of McCarthyism is that
dangerously inaccurate, sensa
tional statements can be uttered
in a matter of seconds which can
take hours of careful argument to
refute.
Particularly on the nuclear
question, the engineer faces the
problem of countering effective
fear phrases, like "radioactive
waste" and "genetic pool dam
age." Often, his technical argu
ments simply fall on unin
terested ears because, in an era of
fear-mongers and shouters, a
calm voice is easily ignored.

Rachelle Marshall and Walter
Robb made some curious argu
ments in their letters to the Daily
April 2 regarding Proposition 15.
Even admitting that a cheap,
abundant supply of energy may
not be a sufficient condition to
insure the elimination of pov
erty, it must surely be a neces
sary condition.
One can turn Marshall's ar
gument around: The defeat of
Proposition 15 may or may not
improve the lot of the poor; its
passage will certainly not help
them.
As for us Americans with our
"steadily increased" utility bills,
how does Marshall expect to re
duce those bills if nuclear power

is forbidden?
I don't know how many times
one must repeat that there are no
important technical problems
associated with waste storage,
and that the potential genetic
dangers from nuclear power are
small, and probably no worse
than from realistic alternative
sources such as coal.
On the other hand, there are
problems we incur if we ban
nuclear power; these are much
more real, much more severe
and much more immediate.
Robb should carefully ponder
these matters before making glib
moral accusations.
Finally, why is Robb so upset
over the appearance of an anti
initiative article in the Daily?
The next day the Daily carried a
similar interview, by the same
reporter, with one of the General
Electric "defectors"; the two in
terviews together were an in
teresting and informative mini
debate.
I congratulate the Daily
reporter for a fine job. and I
trust the Daily will continue to
cover both sides of this issue.

On liberalism
loe Galgano, in his column in
the Daily March 29, has mis
understood the confusion sur
rounding the term liberalism .
He seems to feel that real
liberalism consists in compas
sion and concern for the "little
man." But this is onlv one, and

far from the most important re
cent meaning of the term.
To begin with, Galgano's re
marks on the Vietnam war were
especially forgetful It was not a
conservative administration that
committed American troops in
Vietnam. It was the same ad
ministration that promised an
end to poverty anjt} injustice.
The two commitments were
conceived as part of the same
general policy. Hubert Hum
phrey in 1967 described ,the Viet
nam war as an effort to "bring
the Great Society to Asia."
And the Vietnam war was not
an isolated incident. Even today,
the same confidence in the om
nipotence of federal govern
ment is displayed both in
domestic and foreign affairs.
In a recent Meet the Press
television program, columnist
Joseph Kraft asked Sen.
Henry Jackson whether he had
ever voted against a large gov
ernment program — of any kind.
After the inevitable song and
dance, Jackson had to admit that
he had not.
In short, the primary effective
meaning of the term "liberalism"
in recent times is statism. The
sooner we learn that, the sooner
we will escape the bewitching
allure of nice-sounding words,
and the sooner we will be able to
understand the nature of the di
lemmas, sacrifices and trade-offs
that are an essential part of the
current political situation.

Rachelle Marshall and Walter
Robb made some curious argu
ments in their letters to the Daily
April 2 regarding Proposition 15.
Even admitting that a cheap,
abundant supply of energy may
not be a sufficient condition to
insure the elimination of pov
erty, it must surely be a neces
sary condition.
One can turn Marshall's ar
gument around: The defeat of
Proposition 15 may or may not
improve the lot of the poor; its
passage will certainly not help
them.
As for us Americans with our
"steadily increased" utility bills,
how does Marshall expect to re
duce those bills if nuclear power

is forbidden?
I don't know how many times
one must repeat that there are no
important technical problems
associated with waste storage,
and that the potential genetic
dangers from nuclear power are
small, and probably no worse
than from realistic alternative
sources such as coal.
On the other hand, there are
problems we incur if we ban
nuclear power; these are much
more real, much more severe
and much more immediate.
Robb should carefully ponder
these matters before making glib
moral accusations.
Finally, why is Robb so upset
over the appearance of an anti
initiative article in the Daily?
The next day the Daily carried a
similar interview, by the same
reporter, with one of the General
Electric "defectors"; the two in
terviews together were an in
teresting and informative mini
debate.
I congratulate the Daily
reporter for a fine job. and I
trust the Daily will continue to
cover both sides of this issue.

On liberalism
loe Galgano, in his column in
the Daily March 29, has mis
understood the confusion sur
rounding the term liberalism .
He seems to feel that real
liberalism consists in compas
sion and concern for the "little
man." But this is onlv one, and

far from the most important re
cent meaning of the term.
To begin with, Galgano's re
marks on the Vietnam war were
especially forgetful It was not a
conservative administration that
committed American troops in
Vietnam. It was the same ad
ministration that promised an
end to poverty anjt} injustice.
The two commitments were
conceived as part of the same
general policy. Hubert Hum
phrey in 1967 described ,the Viet
nam war as an effort to "bring
the Great Society to Asia."
And the Vietnam war was not
an isolated incident. Even today,
the same confidence in the om
nipotence of federal govern
ment is displayed both in
domestic and foreign affairs.
In a recent Meet the Press
television program, columnist
Joseph Kraft asked Sen.
Henry Jackson whether he had
ever voted against a large gov
ernment program — of any kind.
After the inevitable song and
dance, Jackson had to admit that
he had not.
In short, the primary effective
meaning of the term "liberalism"
in recent times is statism. The
sooner we learn that, the sooner
we will escape the bewitching
allure of nice-sounding words,
and the sooner we will be able to
understand the nature of the di
lemmas, sacrifices and trade-offs
that are an essential part of the
current political situation.

I was mildly surprised by the
March 30 front-page Daily inter
view with Edward Teller, and
somewhat encouraged that the
Stanford community might after
all get the other view on nuclear
power in this newspaper. How
ever, that encouragement faded
when the followups included a
nuclear plant caricature, an in
terview with Dale Bridenbaugh
and two anti-Teller letters.
As for the letters from Mike
Robb and Rachelle Marshall, I
really take exception to charges
of immorality and lack of social
conscience on the part of en
gineers.
Engineers are not baby-killers
and in fact are sensitive to the
social effect of their work. After
all, the ultimate purpose of en
gineering is to help cope with
societal problems arising from
the development of humanity,
and engineers have a right to be
proud of their accomplishments.
The thousands of men and
women who continue to work
for the development of peaceful
uses of nuclear energy have no
thing to gain by destroying a
world they have helped to build.
On the contrary, they believe

that nuclear energy is one of the
least environmentally harmful
and cheapest alternatives avail
able right now.
A great lesson we learned from
the days of McCarthyism is that
dangerously inaccurate, sensa
tional statements can be uttered
in a matter of seconds which can
take hours of careful argument to
refute.

these matters before making glib
moral accusations.
Finally, why is Robb so upset
over the appearance of an anti
initiative article in the Daily?
The next day the Daily carried a
similar interview, by the same
reporter, with one of the General
Electric "defectors"; the two in
terviews together were an in
teresting and informative mini
debate.
I congratulate the Daily
reporter for a fine job. and I
trust the Daily will continue to
cover both sides of this issue.

On liberalism
loe Galgano, in his column in
the Daily March 29, has mis
understood the confusion sur
rounding the term liberalism .
He seems to feel that real
liberalism consists in compas
sion and concern for the "little
man." But this is onlv one, and

far from the most important re
cent meaning of the term.
To begin with, Galgano's re
marks on the Vietnam war were
especially forgetful It was not a
conservative administration that
committed American troops in
Vietnam. It was the same ad
ministration that promised an
end to poverty anjt} injustice.
The two commitments were
conceived as part of the same
general policy. Hubert Hum
phrey in 1967 described ,the Viet
nam war as an effort to "bring
the Great Society to Asia."
And the Vietnam war was not
an isolated incident. Even today,
the same confidence in the om
nipotence of federal govern
ment is displayed both in
domestic and foreign affairs.
In a recent Meet the Press
television program, columnist
Joseph Kraft asked Sen.
Henry Jackson whether he had
ever voted against a large gov
ernment program — of any kind.
After the inevitable song and
dance, Jackson had to admit that
he had not.
In short, the primary effective
meaning of the term "liberalism"
in recent times is statism. The
sooner we learn that, the sooner
we will escape the bewitching
allure of nice-sounding words,
and the sooner we will be able to
understand the nature of the di
lemmas, sacrifices and trade-offs
that are an essential part of the
current political situation.

Unfair labels
I was mildly surprised by the
March 30 front-page Daily inter
view with Edward Teller, and
somewhat encouraged that the
Stanford community might after
all get the other view on nuclear
power in this newspaper. How
ever, that encouragement faded
when the followups included a
nuclear plant caricature, an in
terview with Dale Bridenbaugh
and two anti-Teller letters.
As for the letters from Mike
Robb and Rachelle Marshall, I
really take exception to charges
of immorality and lack of social
conscience on the part of en
gineers.
Engineers are not baby-killers
and in fact are sensitive to the
social effect of their work. After
all, the ultimate purpose of en
gineering is to help cope with
societal problems arising from
the development of humanity,
and engineers have a right to be
proud of their accomplishments.
The thousands of men and
women who continue to work
for the development of peaceful
uses of nuclear energy have no
thing to gain by destroying a
world they have helped to build.
On the contrary, they believe

that nuclear energy is one of the
least environmentally harmful
and cheapest alternatives avail
able right now.
A great lesson we learned from
the days of McCarthyism is that
dangerously inaccurate, sensa
tional statements can be uttered
in a matter of seconds which can
take hours of careful argument to
refute.
Particularly on the nuclear
question, the engineer faces the
problem of countering effective
fear phrases, like "radioactive
waste" and "genetic pool dam
age." Often, his technical argu
ments simply fall on unin
terested ears because, in an era of
fear-mongers and shouters, a
calm voice is easily ignored.

Rachelle Marshall and Walter
Robb made some curious argu
ments in their letters to the Daily
April 2 regarding Proposition 15.
Even admitting that a cheap,
abundant supply of energy may
not be a sufficient condition to
insure the elimination of pov
erty, it must surely be a neces
sary condition.
One can turn Marshall's ar
gument around: The defeat of
Proposition 15 may or may not
improve the lot of the poor; its
passage will certainly not help
them.
As for us Americans with our
"steadily increased" utility bills,
how does Marshall expect to re
duce those bills if nuclear power

is forbidden?
I don't know how many times
one must repeat that there are no
important technical problems
associated with waste storage,
and that the potential genetic
dangers from nuclear power are
small, and probably no worse
than from realistic alternative
sources such as coal.
On the other hand, there are
problems we incur if we ban
nuclear power; these are much
more real, much more severe
and much more immediate.
Robb should carefully ponder
these matters before making glib
moral accusations.
Finally, why is Robb so upset
over the appearance of an anti
initiative article in the Daily?
