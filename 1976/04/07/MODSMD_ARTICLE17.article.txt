# Experts argue pros, cons of Proposition 15
## 'Nuclear plants are unsafe' 
### Kyra Subbotin 
"I think it's time we insist that
safety testing on nuclear power
plants be completed," Dale
Bridenbaugh, former perfor
mance evaluation manager with
the Nuclear Energy Division of
General Electric (GE) said yes
terday.
Bridenbaugh, who spoke in
support of Proposition 15, res
igned from GE Feb. 6, citing his
"deep concern" over the techni

cal safety o;f the 25 power plants
which had been under his
supervision.
"Tech nica lly, nuclear power
is impl eme ntable, but as it
stands, t he p»lants are not safe.
You have • to evaluate the risk in
volved; we have to achieve
near-perfect s.afety."
Bridenb. *ugh cited unresolved
technical i:om:erns, ineffectual
regulatory pr ocesses and the
"tremendo us potential for

sabotage" as the three funda
mental reasons for alleged un
safe conditions.
Technical problems, accord
ing to Bridenbaugh, include
finding a feasible method of dis
posing of plant waste.
"The amount of radioactive
waste is almost impossible to
conceive of," he said. "The ex
perts have not done their en
gineering homework.
"Though the probability of an
accident is low, a study of each
system goes on while the system
is in implementation."
He cited studies which indi
cate that a uranium leak from the
core system of a Mark I power
plant would cause the walls of
the plant to jump five inches off
the foundation. Suggestions to
close down or restrict these
plants' outputs were rejected by
the Nuclear Regulatory Com
mission (NRG), Bridenbaugh
said.
NRC officials determined that
a shutdown would cost between
$200,000 and $500,000 a day,
then concluded that the plants'
owners could not afford a shut
down, Bridenbaugh complained.
"We're getting deeper and
deeper and deeper into the di
lemma," he said.
Craig Ritchey, an attorney for
National Resources Defense,
joined Bridenbaugh in his sup
port of Proposition 15." He com
mended the public on its recog
nition of seismic and environ
mental problems but added,
"Many problems never reach the
light of the public debate."
He claims that there exists a
"serious disagreement between
the experts," and that "what we
are left with is government/
industry and the independent
scientists. Most decisions have
been kept within government
and industry."
Both Bridenbaugh and
Ritchey agree that a "yes" vote
on Proposition 15 is essential.
"It is not a 'back-door' attempt
to shut down nuclear power
plants, as some claim," said
Ritchey.
Bridenbaugh added, "It's the
only way to get the questions
answered."
The symposium was spon
sored by the Business School's
Committee for Corporate Re
sponsibility.

Craig Ritchey, an attorney for
National Resources Defense,
joined Bridenbaugh in his sup
port of Proposition 15." He com
mended the public on its recog
nition of seismic and environ
mental problems but added,
"Many problems never reach the
light of the public debate."
He claims that there exists a
"serious disagreement between
the experts," and that "what we
are left with is government/
industry and the independent
scientists. Most decisions have
been kept within government
and industry."
Both Bridenbaugh and
Ritchey agree that a "yes" vote
on Proposition 15 is essential.
"It is not a 'back-door' attempt
to shut down nuclear power
plants, as some claim," said
Ritchey.
Bridenbaugh added, "It's the
only way to get the questions
answered."
The symposium was spon
sored by the Business School's
Committee for Corporate Re
sponsibility.
"I think it's time we insist that
safety testing on nuclear power
plants be completed," Dale
Bridenbaugh, former perfor
mance evaluation manager with
the Nuclear Energy Division of
General Electric (GE) said yes
terday.
Bridenbaugh, who spoke in
support of Proposition 15, res
igned from GE Feb. 6, citing his
"deep concern" over the techni

cal safety o;f the 25 power plants
which had been under his
supervision.
"Tech nica lly, nuclear power
is impl eme ntable, but as it
stands, t he p»lants are not safe.
You have • to evaluate the risk in
volved; we have to achieve
near-perfect s.afety."
Bridenb. *ugh cited unresolved
technical i:om:erns, ineffectual
regulatory pr ocesses and the
"tremendo us potential for

sabotage" as the three funda
mental reasons for alleged un
safe conditions.
Technical problems, accord
ing to Bridenbaugh, include
finding a feasible method of dis
posing of plant waste.
"The amount of radioactive
waste is almost impossible to
conceive of," he said. "The ex
perts have not done their en
gineering homework.
"Though the probability of an
accident is low, a study of each
system goes on while the system
is in implementation."
He cited studies which indi
cate that a uranium leak from the
core system of a Mark I power
plant would cause the walls of
the plant to jump five inches off
the foundation. Suggestions to
close down or restrict these
plants' outputs were rejected by
the Nuclear Regulatory Com
mission (NRG), Bridenbaugh
said.
NRC officials determined that
a shutdown would cost between
$200,000 and $500,000 a day,
then concluded that the plants'
owners could not afford a shut
down, Bridenbaugh complained.
"We're getting deeper and
deeper and deeper into the di
lemma," he said.
