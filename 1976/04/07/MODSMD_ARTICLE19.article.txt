# 'Nuclear power will alleviate energy crisis'
## 
### Marc Strassman 
"The viability of the nation
and the world are threatened by
an energy shortage. Proposition
15 is not an answer to the energy
problem; it just takes away one of
the solutions. I urge you to work
against Proposition 15," says
Bertram Wolfe.
Wolfe, general manager of the
Fuel Recovery and Irradiation
Processing Department of Gen
eral Electric (GE), spoke Monday
at noon to an audience of 100
persons in Bishop Auditorium
on "The Nuclear Dilemma," as
part of a debate on Proposition
15 — the Nuclear Initiative —
sponsored by the Business
School's Committee on Corpo
rate Responsibility.
Wolfe emphasized that, "GE
doesn't speak for me, morally or
politically, and I don't speak for
them."
Wolfe argued against the in
itiative on the grounds that it al
lows people to vote on the risks
associated with nuclear power
but not on the benefits.
Wolfe said that "no alternative
energy sources will impact be
fore the end of the century," and
that therefore "we must rely on
coal, nuclear power and conser
vation" to get us through as oil
reserves diminish.
Referring to a graph which
showed the direct correlation of
energy consumption and the
Gross National Product, Wolfe
argued that the only alternative to
maintaining and increasing
energy production is a reduction

in the standard of living.
He said he disagrees with "the
idea that conservation will be
fun, like taking a Boy Scout out
ing in the woods."
Wolfe attacked what he said
was the position of the Creative
Initiative Foundation that living
at a lower material standard
could be a welcome challenge,
since material prosperity often
leads to "boredom or meaning
less pleasure.
"The Teamsters aren't looking
for that challenge," he said, "and
neither are those on strike in San
Francisco."
There are even some people,
he added, who think that "a re
duced standard of living would
make life not worth living."
Wolfe also said that improved
conditions for Jews, Japanese,
blacks and women over the last
50 years had occurred in part be
cause "the standard of living has
reached a point where we can
help our fellows.
"Those who believe in the
Golden Rule," he said, "should
think twice about anything that
affects our standard of living."
The need for more energy in
the future, even under condi
tions of increased conservation
and more efficient*technology, is
in large part the result of popula
tion curves, he indicated.
"Increased energy consump
tion,"said Wolfe, "is due largely
to people like you, young
people."
He dismissed the possibility
of energy rationing.

"There is no fair way to allo
cate a scarce resource, or at least
no way to do it so that people
will think it fair."
Wolfe cited a number of omin
ous possibilities associated with
the generation of electricity by
means other than nuclear.
Saying that a "yes" vote on
Proposition 15 would result in
greater use of coal, Wolfe noted
that burning coal increases the
concentration of atmospheric
carbon dioxide, which encour
ages the greenhouse effect. This,
he said, creates the possibility of
melting the polar ice cap with
resultant flooding of "the Santa
Clara Valley and New York City
to a depth of 200 feet."
This possibility was met with
nervous laughter from the audi
ence.
Wolfe found fault with hyd
roelectric generation of power as
well, saying that dams increase
the possibility of earthquakes,
and that the Aswan High Dam
was "an environmental disaster.
"Contrary to what you may
have thought," said Wolfe, "all
of us live in a sea of radioactiv
ity," citing 130 units as the aver
age level of background radia
tion present in the environment.
"We don't know,"he said,
"whether this is healthy or
harmful. It might be healthy."
Drawing an analogy, Wolfe
continued, "If you get too much
sunlight, you can get skin
cancer; with not enough, you get
rickets. It may be the same with
background radiation."
The scattered derisive laugher
from the audience seemed to say
that not everyone there was con
vinced that radiation, even in

small amounts, was good fo\
them.
Citing marginal differences in
background radiation between
Palo Alto and Saratoga, where
his home is, the GE executive
said, "if you 're worried about the
30 units, move up to where I
am." (
Wolfe said that the question
often raised by proponents of the
initiative of leaving a dangerous
legacy of radioactive plutonium to
future generations was "a mean
ingless point."
Wolfe painted a picture of an
archeologist circa 2576 wh|i
might dig up some glass
encased plutonium from a salt
cave, "put it in his mouth to de
termine its texture, put it in his
pocket and take it home and
keep it on his desk as a paper
weight."
Asking himself when such
person might be expected to die,
Wolfe said, "we don't know."
Asked what the economic ef
fect would be on General Electric
if the initiative succeeded, Wolfe
said that if there were a "nuclear
moratorium nationwide" that it
would have "a net beneficial ef
fect" on General Electric and
Westinghouse, the other major
corporation in the field.
"We've made unprofitable
commitments that will cost us to
get out of," said Wolfe. "The
field will not be profitable for u -
until 1985," he added.
Asked why GE continues to
work in an unprofitable area,
Wolfe said that his company
feels a certain responsibility to
the country and that not to do so
would be contrary to the com
petitive principles of business.

affects our standard of living."
The need for more energy in
the future, even under condi
tions of increased conservation
and more efficient*technology, is
in large part the result of popula
tion curves, he indicated.
"Increased energy consump
tion,"said Wolfe, "is due largely
to people like you, young
people."
He dismissed the possibility
of energy rationing.

"There is no fair way to allo
cate a scarce resource, or at least
no way to do it so that people
will think it fair."
Wolfe cited a number of omin
ous possibilities associated with
the generation of electricity by
means other than nuclear.
Saying that a "yes" vote on
Proposition 15 would result in
greater use of coal, Wolfe noted
that burning coal increases the
concentration of atmospheric
carbon dioxide, which encour
ages the greenhouse effect. This,
he said, creates the possibility of
melting the polar ice cap with
resultant flooding of "the Santa
Clara Valley and New York City
to a depth of 200 feet."
This possibility was met with
nervous laughter from the audi
ence.
Wolfe found fault with hyd
roelectric generation of power as
well, saying that dams increase
the possibility of earthquakes,
and that the Aswan High Dam
was "an environmental disaster.
"Contrary to what you may
have thought," said Wolfe, "all
of us live in a sea of radioactiv
ity," citing 130 units as the aver
age level of background radia
tion present in the environment.
"We don't know,"he said,
"whether this is healthy or
harmful. It might be healthy."
Drawing an analogy, Wolfe
continued, "If you get too much
sunlight, you can get skin
cancer; with not enough, you get
rickets. It may be the same with
background radiation."
The scattered derisive laugher
from the audience seemed to say
that not everyone there was con
vinced that radiation, even in

small amounts, was good fo\
them.
Citing marginal differences in
background radiation between
Palo Alto and Saratoga, where
his home is, the GE executive
said, "if you 're worried about the
30 units, move up to where I
am." (
Wolfe said that the question
often raised by proponents of the
initiative of leaving a dangerous
legacy of radioactive plutonium to
future generations was "a mean
ingless point."
Wolfe painted a picture of an
archeologist circa 2576 wh|i
might dig up some glass
encased plutonium from a salt
cave, "put it in his mouth to de
termine its texture, put it in his
pocket and take it home and
keep it on his desk as a paper
weight."
Asking himself when such
person might be expected to die,
Wolfe said, "we don't know."
Asked what the economic ef
fect would be on General Electric
if the initiative succeeded, Wolfe
said that if there were a "nuclear
moratorium nationwide" that it
would have "a net beneficial ef
fect" on General Electric and
Westinghouse, the other major
corporation in the field.
"We've made unprofitable
commitments that will cost us to
get out of," said Wolfe. "The
field will not be profitable for u -
until 1985," he added.
Asked why GE continues to
work in an unprofitable area,
Wolfe said that his company
feels a certain responsibility to
the country and that not to do so
would be contrary to the com
petitive principles of business.

"The viability of the nation
and the world are threatened by
an energy shortage. Proposition
15 is not an answer to the energy
problem; it just takes away one of
the solutions. I urge you to work
against Proposition 15," says
Bertram Wolfe.
Wolfe, general manager of the
Fuel Recovery and Irradiation
Processing Department of Gen
eral Electric (GE), spoke Monday
at noon to an audience of 100
persons in Bishop Auditorium
on "The Nuclear Dilemma," as
part of a debate on Proposition
15 — the Nuclear Initiative —
sponsored by the Business
School's Committee on Corpo
rate Responsibility.
Wolfe emphasized that, "GE
doesn't speak for me, morally or
politically, and I don't speak for
them."
Wolfe argued against the in
itiative on the grounds that it al
lows people to vote on the risks
associated with nuclear power
but not on the benefits.
Wolfe said that "no alternative
energy sources will impact be
fore the end of the century," and
that therefore "we must rely on
coal, nuclear power and conser
vation" to get us through as oil
reserves diminish.
Referring to a graph which
showed the direct correlation of
energy consumption and the
Gross National Product, Wolfe
argued that the only alternative to
maintaining and increasing
energy production is a reduction

in the standard of living.
He said he disagrees with "the
idea that conservation will be
fun, like taking a Boy Scout out
ing in the woods."
Wolfe attacked what he said
was the position of the Creative
Initiative Foundation that living
at a lower material standard
could be a welcome challenge,
since material prosperity often
leads to "boredom or meaning
less pleasure.
"The Teamsters aren't looking
for that challenge," he said, "and
neither are those on strike in San
Francisco."
There are even some people,
he added, who think that "a re
duced standard of living would
make life not worth living."
Wolfe also said that improved
conditions for Jews, Japanese,
blacks and women over the last
50 years had occurred in part be
cause "the standard of living has
reached a point where we can
help our fellows.
"Those who believe in the
Golden Rule," he said, "should

future generations was "a mean
ingless point."
Wolfe painted a picture of an
archeologist circa 2576 wh|i
might dig up some glass
encased plutonium from a salt
cave, "put it in his mouth to de
termine its texture, put it in his
pocket and take it home and
keep it on his desk as a paper
weight."
Asking himself when such
person might be expected to die,
Wolfe said, "we don't know."
Asked what the economic ef
fect would be on General Electric
if the initiative succeeded, Wolfe
said that if there were a "nuclear
moratorium nationwide" that it
would have "a net beneficial ef
fect" on General Electric and
Westinghouse, the other major
corporation in the field.
"We've made unprofitable
commitments that will cost us to
get out of," said Wolfe. "The
field will not be profitable for u -
until 1985," he added.
Asked why GE continues to
work in an unprofitable area,
Wolfe said that his company
feels a certain responsibility to
the country and that not to do so
would be contrary to the com
petitive principles of business.

"The viability of the nation
and the world are threatened by
an energy shortage. Proposition
15 is not an answer to the energy
problem; it just takes away one of
the solutions. I urge you to work
against Proposition 15," says
Bertram Wolfe.
Wolfe, general manager of the
Fuel Recovery and Irradiation
Processing Department of Gen
eral Electric (GE), spoke Monday
at noon to an audience of 100
persons in Bishop Auditorium
on "The Nuclear Dilemma," as
part of a debate on Proposition
15 — the Nuclear Initiative —
sponsored by the Business
School's Committee on Corpo
rate Responsibility.
Wolfe emphasized that, "GE
doesn't speak for me, morally or
politically, and I don't speak for
them."
Wolfe argued against the in
itiative on the grounds that it al
lows people to vote on the risks
associated with nuclear power
but not on the benefits.
Wolfe said that "no alternative
energy sources will impact be
fore the end of the century," and
that therefore "we must rely on
coal, nuclear power and conser
vation" to get us through as oil
reserves diminish.
Referring to a graph which
showed the direct correlation of
energy consumption and the
Gross National Product, Wolfe
argued that the only alternative to
maintaining and increasing
energy production is a reduction

in the standard of living.
He said he disagrees with "the
idea that conservation will be
fun, like taking a Boy Scout out
ing in the woods."
Wolfe attacked what he said
was the position of the Creative
Initiative Foundation that living
at a lower material standard
could be a welcome challenge,
since material prosperity often
leads to "boredom or meaning
less pleasure.
"The Teamsters aren't looking
for that challenge," he said, "and
neither are those on strike in San
Francisco."
There are even some people,
he added, who think that "a re
duced standard of living would
make life not worth living."
Wolfe also said that improved
conditions for Jews, Japanese,
blacks and women over the last
50 years had occurred in part be
cause "the standard of living has
reached a point where we can
help our fellows.
"Those who believe in the
Golden Rule," he said, "should
think twice about anything that
affects our standard of living."
The need for more energy in
the future, even under condi
tions of increased conservation
and more efficient*technology, is
in large part the result of popula
tion curves, he indicated.
"Increased energy consump
tion,"said Wolfe, "is due largely
to people like you, young
people."
He dismissed the possibility
of energy rationing.

"There is no fair way to allo
cate a scarce resource, or at least
no way to do it so that people
will think it fair."
Wolfe cited a number of omin
ous possibilities associated with
the generation of electricity by
means other than nuclear.
Saying that a "yes" vote on
Proposition 15 would result in
greater use of coal, Wolfe noted
that burning coal increases the
concentration of atmospheric
carbon dioxide, which encour
ages the greenhouse effect. This,
he said, creates the possibility of
melting the polar ice cap with
resultant flooding of "the Santa
Clara Valley and New York City
to a depth of 200 feet."
This possibility was met with
nervous laughter from the audi
ence.
Wolfe found fault with hyd
roelectric generation of power as
well, saying that dams increase
the possibility of earthquakes,
and that the Aswan High Dam
was "an environmental disaster.
"Contrary to what you may
have thought," said Wolfe, "all
of us live in a sea of radioactiv
ity," citing 130 units as the aver
age level of background radia
tion present in the environment.
"We don't know,"he said,
"whether this is healthy or
harmful. It might be healthy."
Drawing an analogy, Wolfe
continued, "If you get too much
sunlight, you can get skin
cancer; with not enough, you get
rickets. It may be the same with
background radiation."
The scattered derisive laugher
from the audience seemed to say
that not everyone there was con
vinced that radiation, even in

small amounts, was good fo\
them.
Citing marginal differences in
background radiation between
Palo Alto and Saratoga, where
his home is, the GE executive
said, "if you 're worried about the
30 units, move up to where I
am." (
Wolfe said that the question
often raised by proponents of the
initiative of leaving a dangerous
legacy of radioactive plutonium to
future generations was "a mean
ingless point."
Wolfe painted a picture of an
archeologist circa 2576 wh|i
might dig up some glass

termine its texture, put it in his
