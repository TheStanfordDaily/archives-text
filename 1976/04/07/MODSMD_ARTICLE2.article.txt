# Award winner for Charlie Brown
## Producer returns as guest lecturer 
### Dave Ansley 
Lee Mendelson, an award-winning television
film producer, graduated from Stanford in 1954.
This quarter he has returned as a guest lecturer in
the subject he knows best.
Probably most famous for the 15 Charlie Brown
television programs he has produced, Mendelson is
teaching "Commercial Television Production."He
hopes to impart some of the skills and knowledge
that have helped him win two Emmvs and three
Peabody Awards.
Mendelson's production company, located in
Burlingame, has put together some 50 network spe
cials in the past 13 years. It has worked with such
stars as Paul Newman, Henry Fonda, Lucille Ball,
Peter Falk and Joanne Woodward.
His latest special, The Olympic Champions and
Challengers, will be televised April 17. Hosted by
Telly Savalas, it will serve as ABC's kickoff prog
ram for the summer Olympics. It will feature 22

U.S. and Soviet world record holders and Olympic
gold medalists. It is just one of eight programs they
have made in the last year.
An early start
Mendelson got his start early- "There were only
two or three students interested in Stanford's radio
and television classes in the early '50s. I had always
been interested in communication. I was a year
book editor in high school, and I wanted to go into
radio news.
"1 spent some time in the Air Force after gradua
tion. In the late 1950s I saw some television
documentaries and said. 'I can do better than
that!' "
So he went to work at San Francisco's KPIX,
writing, producing and directing for two years.
"We were doing a series of California historical
programs, and one of them turned out to be a big hit.
It was a program about the building of the Golden
Gate Bridge. We only spent about $800 making it,
but it is still being shown across the country.
"Good reviews and positive viewer reaction to
ward the bridge show led into other things. Be
cause of the success, we decided to form our own
company."
Started on speculation
They "started on speculation," filming
documentaries on Willie Mays and Charles Schulz.
The Schulz program led to Coca-Cola asking for an
animated Charlie Brown Christmas special, "and
we've been doing one or two new Peanuts specials
every year since. We're beginning work on the 16th
one right now.
"We're best known for those shows. But our suc
cess with those has enabled us to make documen
taries, something I enjoy equally well. Among these
35 'live' programs have been two films on John
Steinbeck's works; an Encyclopaedia Britannica
special called The Unexplained; It Couldn't Be
Done, starring Lee Marvin; and From Yellowstone
to Tomorrow, with George C. Scott."
Who originally creates these programs?
"Ninety percent of the non-Charlie Brown ideas
come from me. They just come along one or two at a
time. Part of the excitement is not knowing what's
around the corner.
"I do lots of reading,and it's like panning for gold.
A new program can be prompted by an image, a
book or a sentence," he says.

Once he finds a new concept, he has to find a
sponsor. "We're always calling ad agencies and the
networks trying to sell an idea. But there's never
been any content control exerted by the sponsors or
the networks, no censorsh ip by anybody. They trust
us and our track record.
"Every one is a separate sale. It can take two
weeks, twoye&rs or sometimes never happen at all.
But eight out of 10 ideas do work out."
Mendelson's success can be measured by more
than just the awards he has won. His programs
consistently draw a 40 percent share of the national
audience. The Charlie Brown specials have an av
erage of 45 percent.
In fact, Charlie Brown specials have been broad
cast and rebroadcast a total of 52 times. "We've
been first in the ratings all but twice. Once was the
night of the Munich disaster. The second time were
were beat out by 'The Fonz.' "
Not a bohemian
The reason for this record, he feels, is a conscious
attempt to appeal to the general public. "I'm not a
bohemian artisticindividual. I consider myself part
of the mass audience, and I leave my ears open for
what the family wants. I watch a lot of television
and put myself as a viewer first, producer second."
This doesn't mean Mendelson has no goals of his
own. "I still maintain most of the idealism. I want to
move an audience at least half an inch in a positive
direction while entertaining them."
Lee Mendelson Productions will be taking things
easier for a few months while the boss.is devoting
his time to teaching. "We'll just be editing a
Christmas special, preparing a full-length Charlie
Brown movie, and branching out into Charlie
Brown career-education filmstrips."
After that. Mendelson plans to gradually turn
from movies to full-length films, although he has
no plans to discontinue with the Charlie Brown
specials. Somewhere deep down inside, he says, he
feels he might someday make a "major niovie."
But for a while he will be in the classroom. "I've
had a unique experience, at both the creative and
business ends of production, so I think I can give
students a well-rounded view of the situation.
"It's very important for me to get the views of a
younger generation. So I'll be learning from them at
the same time I'm teaching about 13 years at the
height of the profession."

night of the Munich disaster. The second time were
were beat out by 'The Fonz.' "
Not a bohemian
The reason for this record, he feels, is a conscious
attempt to appeal to the general public. "I'm not a
bohemian artisticindividual. I consider myself part
of the mass audience, and I leave my ears open for
what the family wants. I watch a lot of television
and put myself as a viewer first, producer second."
This doesn't mean Mendelson has no goals of his
own. "I still maintain most of the idealism. I want to
move an audience at least half an inch in a positive
direction while entertaining them."
Lee Mendelson Productions will be taking things
easier for a few months while the boss.is devoting
his time to teaching. "We'll just be editing a
Christmas special, preparing a full-length Charlie
Brown movie, and branching out into Charlie
Brown career-education filmstrips."
After that. Mendelson plans to gradually turn
from movies to full-length films, although he has
no plans to discontinue with the Charlie Brown
specials. Somewhere deep down inside, he says, he
feels he might someday make a "major niovie."
But for a while he will be in the classroom. "I've
had a unique experience, at both the creative and
business ends of production, so I think I can give
students a well-rounded view of the situation.
"It's very important for me to get the views of a
younger generation. So I'll be learning from them at
the same time I'm teaching about 13 years at the
height of the profession."

Lee Mendelson
Lee Mendelson, an award-winning television
film producer, graduated from Stanford in 1954.
This quarter he has returned as a guest lecturer in
the subject he knows best.
Probably most famous for the 15 Charlie Brown
television programs he has produced, Mendelson is
teaching "Commercial Television Production."He
hopes to impart some of the skills and knowledge
that have helped him win two Emmvs and three
Peabody Awards.
Mendelson's production company, located in
Burlingame, has put together some 50 network spe
cials in the past 13 years. It has worked with such
stars as Paul Newman, Henry Fonda, Lucille Ball,
Peter Falk and Joanne Woodward.
His latest special, The Olympic Champions and
Challengers, will be televised April 17. Hosted by
Telly Savalas, it will serve as ABC's kickoff prog
ram for the summer Olympics. It will feature 22

U.S. and Soviet world record holders and Olympic
gold medalists. It is just one of eight programs they
have made in the last year.
An early start
Mendelson got his start early- "There were only
two or three students interested in Stanford's radio
and television classes in the early '50s. I had always
been interested in communication. I was a year
book editor in high school, and I wanted to go into
radio news.
"1 spent some time in the Air Force after gradua
tion. In the late 1950s I saw some television
documentaries and said. 'I can do better than
that!' "
So he went to work at San Francisco's KPIX,
writing, producing and directing for two years.
"We were doing a series of California historical
programs, and one of them turned out to be a big hit.
It was a program about the building of the Golden
Gate Bridge. We only spent about $800 making it,
but it is still being shown across the country.
"Good reviews and positive viewer reaction to
ward the bridge show led into other things. Be
cause of the success, we decided to form our own
company."
Started on speculation
They "started on speculation," filming
documentaries on Willie Mays and Charles Schulz.
The Schulz program led to Coca-Cola asking for an
animated Charlie Brown Christmas special, "and
we've been doing one or two new Peanuts specials
every year since. We're beginning work on the 16th
one right now.
"We're best known for those shows. But our suc
cess with those has enabled us to make documen
taries, something I enjoy equally well. Among these
35 'live' programs have been two films on John
Steinbeck's works; an Encyclopaedia Britannica
special called The Unexplained; It Couldn't Be
Done, starring Lee Marvin; and From Yellowstone
to Tomorrow, with George C. Scott."
Who originally creates these programs?
"Ninety percent of the non-Charlie Brown ideas
come from me. They just come along one or two at a
time. Part of the excitement is not knowing what's
around the corner.
"I do lots of reading,and it's like panning for gold.
A new program can be prompted by an image, a
book or a sentence," he says.

Once he finds a new concept, he has to find a
sponsor. "We're always calling ad agencies and the
networks trying to sell an idea. But there's never
been any content control exerted by the sponsors or
the networks, no censorsh ip by anybody. They trust
us and our track record.
"Every one is a separate sale. It can take two
weeks, twoye&rs or sometimes never happen at all.
But eight out of 10 ideas do work out."
Mendelson's success can be measured by more
than just the awards he has won. His programs
consistently draw a 40 percent share of the national
audience. The Charlie Brown specials have an av
erage of 45 percent.
In fact, Charlie Brown specials have been broad
cast and rebroadcast a total of 52 times. "We've
been first in the ratings all but twice. Once was the
night of the Munich disaster. The second time were
were beat out by 'The Fonz.' "

"We're best known for those shows. But our suc
cess with those has enabled us to make documen
taries, something I enjoy equally well. Among these
35 'live' programs have been two films on John
Steinbeck's works; an Encyclopaedia Britannica
special called The Unexplained; It Couldn't Be
Done, starring Lee Marvin; and From Yellowstone
to Tomorrow, with George C. Scott."
Who originally creates these programs?
"Ninety percent of the non-Charlie Brown ideas
come from me. They just come along one or two at a
time. Part of the excitement is not knowing what's
around the corner.
"I do lots of reading,and it's like panning for gold.
A new program can be prompted by an image, a
book or a sentence," he says.

Once he finds a new concept, he has to find a
sponsor. "We're always calling ad agencies and the
networks trying to sell an idea. But there's never
been any content control exerted by the sponsors or
the networks, no censorsh ip by anybody. They trust
us and our track record.
"Every one is a separate sale. It can take two
weeks, twoye&rs or sometimes never happen at all.
But eight out of 10 ideas do work out."
Mendelson's success can be measured by more
than just the awards he has won. His programs
consistently draw a 40 percent share of the national
audience. The Charlie Brown specials have an av
erage of 45 percent.
In fact, Charlie Brown specials have been broad
cast and rebroadcast a total of 52 times. "We've
been first in the ratings all but twice. Once was the
night of the Munich disaster. The second time were
were beat out by 'The Fonz.' "
Not a bohemian
The reason for this record, he feels, is a conscious
attempt to appeal to the general public. "I'm not a
bohemian artisticindividual. I consider myself part
of the mass audience, and I leave my ears open for
what the family wants. I watch a lot of television
and put myself as a viewer first, producer second."
This doesn't mean Mendelson has no goals of his
own. "I still maintain most of the idealism. I want to
move an audience at least half an inch in a positive
direction while entertaining them."
Lee Mendelson Productions will be taking things
easier for a few months while the boss.is devoting
his time to teaching. "We'll just be editing a
Christmas special, preparing a full-length Charlie
Brown movie, and branching out into Charlie
Brown career-education filmstrips."
After that. Mendelson plans to gradually turn
from movies to full-length films, although he has
no plans to discontinue with the Charlie Brown
specials. Somewhere deep down inside, he says, he
feels he might someday make a "major niovie."
But for a while he will be in the classroom. "I've
had a unique experience, at both the creative and
business ends of production, so I think I can give
students a well-rounded view of the situation.
"It's very important for me to get the views of a
younger generation. So I'll be learning from them at
the same time I'm teaching about 13 years at the
height of the profession."

Lee Mendelson, an award-winning television
film producer, graduated from Stanford in 1954.
This quarter he has returned as a guest lecturer in
the subject he knows best.
Probably most famous for the 15 Charlie Brown
television programs he has produced, Mendelson is
teaching "Commercial Television Production."He
hopes to impart some of the skills and knowledge
that have helped him win two Emmvs and three
Peabody Awards.
Mendelson's production company, located in
Burlingame, has put together some 50 network spe
cials in the past 13 years. It has worked with such
stars as Paul Newman, Henry Fonda, Lucille Ball,
Peter Falk and Joanne Woodward.
His latest special, The Olympic Champions and
Challengers, will be televised April 17. Hosted by
Telly Savalas, it will serve as ABC's kickoff prog
ram for the summer Olympics. It will feature 22

U.S. and Soviet world record holders and Olympic
gold medalists. It is just one of eight programs they
have made in the last year.
An early start
Mendelson got his start early- "There were only
two or three students interested in Stanford's radio
and television classes in the early '50s. I had always
been interested in communication. I was a year
book editor in high school, and I wanted to go into
radio news.
"1 spent some time in the Air Force after gradua
tion. In the late 1950s I saw some television
documentaries and said. 'I can do better than
that!' "
So he went to work at San Francisco's KPIX,
writing, producing and directing for two years.
"We were doing a series of California historical
programs, and one of them turned out to be a big hit.
It was a program about the building of the Golden
Gate Bridge. We only spent about $800 making it,
but it is still being shown across the country.
"Good reviews and positive viewer reaction to
ward the bridge show led into other things. Be
cause of the success, we decided to form our own
company."
Started on speculation
They "started on speculation," filming
documentaries on Willie Mays and Charles Schulz.
The Schulz program led to Coca-Cola asking for an
animated Charlie Brown Christmas special, "and
we've been doing one or two new Peanuts specials
every year since. We're beginning work on the 16th
one right now.
"We're best known for those shows. But our suc
cess with those has enabled us to make documen
