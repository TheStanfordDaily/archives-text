# Youngest death row con fights for life
## 
### 
NEW ORLEANS (PNS) — A
major scandal involving Ameri
ca's youngest death row convict,
17-year-old Gary Tyler, has
erupted here.
Tyler's lawyer has obtained af
fidavits from two of the state's
three key witnesses against the
black youth charging that they
were coerced by local police and
government prosecutors into
giving false testimony.
As a result, Tyler's May 5
execution date has been sus
pended pending a hearing in
District Court here April 21 in
which Tyler's lawyer will argue
for a new trial.
Tyler was convicted by an
all-white jury in the shooting
death of a 13-year-old white
youth, Timothy Weber, during a
racial melee in Destrehan, La. —
40 miles north of New Orleans —
on Oct. 7, 1974.
Demonstration
The shooting incident occur
red during an anti-busing de
monstration, when a crowd of
white students and parents sur
rounded a school bus containing
60 to 70 black students. A shot
rang out and Weber, standing
among the white demonstrators,
fell dead.
Local police immediately
searched the school bus and all
black students but produced no
weapon. Tyler, who h a d been
aboard the bus, was arrested dur
ing the search for obstructing
justice when heallegedly argued
with an officer. That night the
charge was changed to first de
gree murder.
Police had produced a .45 au
tomatic after impounding the
bus and obtained a signed state
ment from a witness, 15-year-old
Natalie Blanks, stating she had
been sitting near Tyler on the
bus and saw him lean out a win
dow and fire the weapon.
Damning evidence
Blanks stuck to her statement
before a grand jury and through
out the trial. The other prosecu
tion witnesses who had been

aboard the bus also testified they
had seen the alleged murder
weapon passed around the bus
and handled by Tyler.
The .45 automatic was never
conclusively identified as the
murder weapon, however, be
cause the bullet that killed
young Weber was never reco
vered. Nor were Tyler's finger
prints found on the weapon.
Police said he had been wearing
gloves.
But the weapon had been re
ported stolen from the nearby
Kenner police firing range after
• t was discovered on the bus.
Tyler was convicted and sen
tenced to die in the electric chair
at Louisiana State Prison at An
gola. He has been on death row
there since Dec. 15, 1975.
Witness recants
On March 9, Tyler's new at
torney, Jack Peebles of New Or
leans, filed motions for a new
trial. He also released a 31-page
affidavit in which Blanks, the
key state witness, declared that
her prior statement and trial tes
timony were false and had been
prepared for her by police and
prosecutors.
In the affidavit, Blanks states
that Louisiana Asst. Atty. Gen.
L.I. Hymel and St. Charles Parish
Asst. District Atty. Norman Pitre
threatened to charge her with
accessory to murder and perjury
if she recanted her testimony.
According to the affidavit,
Blanks said the- prosecutors
"asked me, 'How old is your
baby?' and 'Do you want to be in
jail? Don't you want to see your
baby? Don't you want to be here
to raise your baby?'
Blanks states that on the night
of the shooting she was brought
to police headquarters and
strip-searched by policewomen.
She contends that while she was
naked two St. Charles Parish
male deputies grabbed her and
shouted, "You know Gary shot
him."
That night, she says, the same
two deputies gave her a prepared

statement identifying Tyler as
the murderer and told her to sign
it.
Attorney Peebles says that be
fore Blanks testified in the trial
she met in the judge's chambers
with her attorney, Sylvia Taylor,
Judge Ruche Marino, and the as
sistant district attorney and as
sistant attorney general.
Taylor informed the judge and
prosecutors that in view of her
client's psychiatric instability
she would advise her to take the
Fifth Amendment if questioned
on the statement implicating
Tyler. The prosecutors then ag
reed to grant Blanks "oral im
munity" from accessory or per
jury in return for her testimony.
Peebles claims the jury was
never told of the immunity, nor
of Blanks' "extensive psychiat
ric background." If either had
been known, her reliability as a
witness could have been dam
aged.
Hymel and Pitre have de
clined to comment on any aspect
of the case.
Other witnesses
On March 24 Peebles filed ad
ditional motions to obtain tape
recordings of police interviews
with the two other witnesses
who claimed during the trial
they had seen Tyler handling a
gun while on the bus.
One of those witnesses,
Loretta London Thomas, has
since signed an affidavit stating
that she, too, was coerced to give
false testimony.
Thomas states that she was
questioned on three separate oc
casions the day of the shooting.
The third time, she states, a
sheriff's deputy told her he was
"going to send her to jail for 99

years" if she didn't sign a state
ment indicating that a gun had
been passed around the bus.
Peebles believes the other pro
secution witness was similarly
coerced.
Peebles said he is investigat
ing the possibility that the fatal
shot on Oct. 7,1974, was fired by
someone among or behind the
crowd of white demonstrators —
possibly at the bus.
"There is some information,"
he said, "that it (the shot) came
from outside the bus."
During the trial, bus driver Er
nest Cojoe, an Army combat vet
eran, testified he was certain the
shot couldn't have come from a

.45 automatic inside the bus.
Other students on the bus had
also testified that the shot
sounded more like a "fire
cracker" than a gunshot.
Peebles said he will appeal if
his April 21 motion for a new
trial is unsuccessful. If that ap
peal is rejected "there is a very
definite" chance that Tyler will
go to the electric chair, he said.
Lolis Elie, Tyler's family at
torney, though not directly in
volved in the case, said, "In my
17 years as a civil rights lawyer
this is the most outrageous thing
I've seen in my life. There are
lots of funny things about this
case."

with the two other witnesses
who claimed during the trial
they had seen Tyler handling a
gun while on the bus.
One of those witnesses,
Loretta London Thomas, has
since signed an affidavit stating
that she, too, was coerced to give
false testimony.
Thomas states that she was
questioned on three separate oc
casions the day of the shooting.
The third time, she states, a
sheriff's deputy told her he was
"going to send her to jail for 99

years" if she didn't sign a state
ment indicating that a gun had
been passed around the bus.
Peebles believes the other pro
secution witness was similarly
coerced.
Peebles said he is investigat
ing the possibility that the fatal
shot on Oct. 7,1974, was fired by
someone among or behind the
crowd of white demonstrators —
possibly at the bus.
"There is some information,"
he said, "that it (the shot) came
from outside the bus."
During the trial, bus driver Er
nest Cojoe, an Army combat vet
eran, testified he was certain the
shot couldn't have come from a

.45 automatic inside the bus.
Other students on the bus had
also testified that the shot
sounded more like a "fire
cracker" than a gunshot.
Peebles said he will appeal if
his April 21 motion for a new
trial is unsuccessful. If that ap
peal is rejected "there is a very
definite" chance that Tyler will
go to the electric chair, he said.
Lolis Elie, Tyler's family at
torney, though not directly in
volved in the case, said, "In my
17 years as a civil rights lawyer
this is the most outrageous thing
I've seen in my life. There are
lots of funny things about this
case."
NEW ORLEANS (PNS) — A
major scandal involving Ameri
ca's youngest death row convict,
17-year-old Gary Tyler, has
erupted here.
Tyler's lawyer has obtained af
fidavits from two of the state's
three key witnesses against the
black youth charging that they
were coerced by local police and
government prosecutors into
giving false testimony.
As a result, Tyler's May 5
execution date has been sus
pended pending a hearing in
District Court here April 21 in
which Tyler's lawyer will argue
for a new trial.
Tyler was convicted by an
all-white jury in the shooting
death of a 13-year-old white
youth, Timothy Weber, during a
racial melee in Destrehan, La. —
40 miles north of New Orleans —
on Oct. 7, 1974.
Demonstration
The shooting incident occur
red during an anti-busing de
monstration, when a crowd of
white students and parents sur
rounded a school bus containing
60 to 70 black students. A shot
rang out and Weber, standing
among the white demonstrators,
fell dead.
Local police immediately
searched the school bus and all
black students but produced no
weapon. Tyler, who h a d been
aboard the bus, was arrested dur
ing the search for obstructing
justice when heallegedly argued
with an officer. That night the
charge was changed to first de
gree murder.
Police had produced a .45 au
tomatic after impounding the
bus and obtained a signed state
ment from a witness, 15-year-old
Natalie Blanks, stating she had
been sitting near Tyler on the
bus and saw him lean out a win
dow and fire the weapon.
Damning evidence
Blanks stuck to her statement
before a grand jury and through
out the trial. The other prosecu
tion witnesses who had been

aboard the bus also testified they
had seen the alleged murder
weapon passed around the bus
and handled by Tyler.
The .45 automatic was never
conclusively identified as the
murder weapon, however, be
cause the bullet that killed
young Weber was never reco
vered. Nor were Tyler's finger
prints found on the weapon.
Police said he had been wearing
gloves.
But the weapon had been re
ported stolen from the nearby
Kenner police firing range after
• t was discovered on the bus.
Tyler was convicted and sen
tenced to die in the electric chair
at Louisiana State Prison at An
gola. He has been on death row
there since Dec. 15, 1975.
Witness recants
On March 9, Tyler's new at
torney, Jack Peebles of New Or
leans, filed motions for a new
trial. He also released a 31-page
affidavit in which Blanks, the
key state witness, declared that
her prior statement and trial tes
timony were false and had been
prepared for her by police and
prosecutors.
In the affidavit, Blanks states
that Louisiana Asst. Atty. Gen.
L.I. Hymel and St. Charles Parish
Asst. District Atty. Norman Pitre
threatened to charge her with
accessory to murder and perjury
if she recanted her testimony.
According to the affidavit,
Blanks said the- prosecutors
"asked me, 'How old is your
baby?' and 'Do you want to be in
jail? Don't you want to see your
baby? Don't you want to be here
to raise your baby?'
Blanks states that on the night
of the shooting she was brought
to police headquarters and
strip-searched by policewomen.
She contends that while she was
naked two St. Charles Parish
male deputies grabbed her and
shouted, "You know Gary shot
him."
That night, she says, the same
two deputies gave her a prepared

statement identifying Tyler as
the murderer and told her to sign
it.
Attorney Peebles says that be
fore Blanks testified in the trial
she met in the judge's chambers
with her attorney, Sylvia Taylor,
Judge Ruche Marino, and the as
sistant district attorney and as
sistant attorney general.
Taylor informed the judge and
prosecutors that in view of her
client's psychiatric instability
she would advise her to take the
Fifth Amendment if questioned
on the statement implicating
Tyler. The prosecutors then ag
reed to grant Blanks "oral im
munity" from accessory or per
jury in return for her testimony.
Peebles claims the jury was
never told of the immunity, nor
of Blanks' "extensive psychiat
ric background." If either had
been known, her reliability as a
witness could have been dam
aged.
Hymel and Pitre have de
clined to comment on any aspect
of the case.

L.I. Hymel and St. Charles Parish
Asst. District Atty. Norman Pitre
threatened to charge her with
accessory to murder and perjury
if she recanted her testimony.
According to the affidavit,
Blanks said the- prosecutors
"asked me, 'How old is your
baby?' and 'Do you want to be in
jail? Don't you want to see your
baby? Don't you want to be here
to raise your baby?'
Blanks states that on the night
of the shooting she was brought
to police headquarters and
strip-searched by policewomen.
She contends that while she was
naked two St. Charles Parish
male deputies grabbed her and
shouted, "You know Gary shot
him."
That night, she says, the same
two deputies gave her a prepared

statement identifying Tyler as
the murderer and told her to sign
it.
Attorney Peebles says that be
fore Blanks testified in the trial
she met in the judge's chambers
with her attorney, Sylvia Taylor,
Judge Ruche Marino, and the as
sistant district attorney and as
sistant attorney general.
Taylor informed the judge and
prosecutors that in view of her
client's psychiatric instability
she would advise her to take the
Fifth Amendment if questioned
on the statement implicating
Tyler. The prosecutors then ag
reed to grant Blanks "oral im
munity" from accessory or per
jury in return for her testimony.
Peebles claims the jury was
never told of the immunity, nor
of Blanks' "extensive psychiat
ric background." If either had
been known, her reliability as a
witness could have been dam
aged.
Hymel and Pitre have de
clined to comment on any aspect
of the case.
Other witnesses
On March 24 Peebles filed ad
ditional motions to obtain tape
recordings of police interviews
with the two other witnesses
who claimed during the trial
they had seen Tyler handling a
gun while on the bus.
One of those witnesses,
Loretta London Thomas, has
since signed an affidavit stating
that she, too, was coerced to give
false testimony.
Thomas states that she was
questioned on three separate oc
casions the day of the shooting.
The third time, she states, a
sheriff's deputy told her he was
"going to send her to jail for 99

years" if she didn't sign a state
ment indicating that a gun had
been passed around the bus.
Peebles believes the other pro
secution witness was similarly
coerced.
Peebles said he is investigat
ing the possibility that the fatal
shot on Oct. 7,1974, was fired by
someone among or behind the
crowd of white demonstrators —
possibly at the bus.
"There is some information,"
he said, "that it (the shot) came
from outside the bus."
During the trial, bus driver Er
nest Cojoe, an Army combat vet
eran, testified he was certain the
shot couldn't have come from a

.45 automatic inside the bus.
Other students on the bus had
also testified that the shot
sounded more like a "fire
cracker" than a gunshot.
Peebles said he will appeal if
his April 21 motion for a new
trial is unsuccessful. If that ap
peal is rejected "there is a very
definite" chance that Tyler will
go to the electric chair, he said.
Lolis Elie, Tyler's family at
torney, though not directly in
volved in the case, said, "In my
17 years as a civil rights lawyer
this is the most outrageous thing
I've seen in my life. There are
lots of funny things about this
case."
NEW ORLEANS (PNS) — A
major scandal involving Ameri
ca's youngest death row convict,
17-year-old Gary Tyler, has
erupted here.
Tyler's lawyer has obtained af
fidavits from two of the state's
three key witnesses against the
black youth charging that they
were coerced by local police and
government prosecutors into
giving false testimony.
As a result, Tyler's May 5
execution date has been sus
pended pending a hearing in
District Court here April 21 in
which Tyler's lawyer will argue
for a new trial.
Tyler was convicted by an
all-white jury in the shooting
death of a 13-year-old white
youth, Timothy Weber, during a
racial melee in Destrehan, La. —
40 miles north of New Orleans —
on Oct. 7, 1974.
Demonstration
The shooting incident occur
red during an anti-busing de
monstration, when a crowd of
white students and parents sur
rounded a school bus containing
60 to 70 black students. A shot
rang out and Weber, standing
among the white demonstrators,
fell dead.
Local police immediately
searched the school bus and all
black students but produced no
weapon. Tyler, who h a d been
aboard the bus, was arrested dur
ing the search for obstructing
justice when heallegedly argued
with an officer. That night the
charge was changed to first de
gree murder.
Police had produced a .45 au
tomatic after impounding the
bus and obtained a signed state
ment from a witness, 15-year-old
Natalie Blanks, stating she had
been sitting near Tyler on the
bus and saw him lean out a win
dow and fire the weapon.
Damning evidence
Blanks stuck to her statement
before a grand jury and through
out the trial. The other prosecu
tion witnesses who had been

aboard the bus also testified they
had seen the alleged murder
weapon passed around the bus
and handled by Tyler.
The .45 automatic was never
conclusively identified as the
murder weapon, however, be
cause the bullet that killed
young Weber was never reco
vered. Nor were Tyler's finger
prints found on the weapon.
Police said he had been wearing
gloves.
But the weapon had been re
ported stolen from the nearby
Kenner police firing range after
• t was discovered on the bus.
Tyler was convicted and sen
tenced to die in the electric chair
at Louisiana State Prison at An
gola. He has been on death row
there since Dec. 15, 1975.
Witness recants
On March 9, Tyler's new at
torney, Jack Peebles of New Or
leans, filed motions for a new
trial. He also released a 31-page
affidavit in which Blanks, the
key state witness, declared that
her prior statement and trial tes
timony were false and had been
prepared for her by police and
prosecutors.
