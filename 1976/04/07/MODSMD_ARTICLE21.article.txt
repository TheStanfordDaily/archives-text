Why are the squash court floors varnished? Although this is ac
ceptable/or the larger British courts, American courts should have
their floors painted white. -C.D.
Jeff Hammett, manager of de(iuerre complex, agrees with you:
"There's a lot of things screwed up with that court," Hammett
said. (For example, there's only one bathroom â€” labeled MEN.)
Unfortunately, the athletic staff discovered that the courts should
be white (and that women play squash) after the court was already
built.
Apparently, the mixup occurred because the hundbuJl courts at
deGuerre were varnished. Hammett said that the squash courts may
be painted white when they are next varnished if there is enough
student interest in the change. So express yours.
