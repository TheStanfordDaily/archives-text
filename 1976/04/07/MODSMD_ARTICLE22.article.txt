## As spring football begins Chris views 'explosive' team 
### Chris Baker 
It could have been late November.
Kain clouds hung ominously overhead as
Guy Benjamin lofted a pass to flanker Tony
Hill on the Stanford varsity football practice
field.
But it was last Monday, the first of 20
spring practices. There are exactly 147 days
left until the Cards journey to Penn State to
open their 1976 football season.
And there are 23 days remaining until
Stanford closes its spring workouts with the
second annual Alumni Game May 1 at 10:30
a.m. in the stadium.
At the moment, at least on paper, it looks
like the nation's bicentennial year may be
coach Jack Christiansen's best season since
taking over in 1972.
Forty lettermen
Among the 80 players Chris greeted on
Monday are 15 returning starters and 40
lettermen, from last year's 6-4-1 squad,
which won five of its last six games.
Christiansen, who with Cal coach Mike
White, is now the senior mentor in the
Pacific-8, feels that 1976 might be the Cards'
year but is hesitant to make any brash pre
dictions.
"This could be a good year for us. But
about the time you say it's going to be super
then you have injuries," said Christiansen.
"But we're definitely more of a known
quantity than we were last season, when we
had to play so many underclassmen."
With four new head coaches, the Pac-8
will have a very different look. "The confer
ence will be more wide open this year than
it's ever been before," said Christiansen.
"All four California teams could win the
championship. The four teams up north are
more unknown, but one of them could eas
ily become a contender."
30 points per game
Last year Stanford averaged 30 points per
game, and with the entire backfield return
ing, quarterbacks and all, and Ail-American
candidate Hill heading a fine corps of re
ceivers, the Cards may put on some offen
sive fireworks this year.
"This could be as explosive a team as
we've had in some time," said Christiansen.
"We have all the people back in the skill
positions, and I like to think we're pretty
solid everywhere.
"We'll have a great receiver in Tony Hill,
a strong and experienced line and all our
top runners from last year."
And two quarterbacks.
"We have the same two quarterbacks and

the same two will fight it out this spring to
see who has the job," said Christiansen. "It's
great to have those two guys," he added.
Combination
Last year the quarterbacks, Guy Benjamin
and Mike Cordova, combined for 21
touchdowns and 2357 passing yards. Hill,
who should be an All-American this year,
hauled down 55 passes for 916 yards and
seven touchdowns to rank seventh nation
ally in receiving.
The rushing attack, which added a new
dimension to Stanford's game plan last
year, should be even stronger this year. The
Cards' top four rushers return, led by
Academic All-American fullback Donny
Stevenson and tailback Ron Inge.
Christiansen plans to stay with the
1-formation he installed last year, and the
Cards will also install the option play in the
playbook this spring.
A couple of years ago, when the wishbone
was making Stanford's defense look silly,
the coaches put in the "50" or 3-4-4 de
fense. But this year the Cards will use a
multiple-front defense.
Different looks
"We're not going to stick to one defense
this season," said Christiansen, "We plan to
use both the odd and even front at different
times and give people a lot of different
looks. We feel we have the people capable of
doing a good job."
One of the people is second-team All-
American defensive end Duncan McColl,
who led Stanford in six defensive categories
last year.
Eight lettermen, including John Harris,
Geoff Kieburtz and Mike Wilkerson, return
to help McColl anchor the defense. And
Andy Kolesnikow, who missed last year
with a knee injury, made his presence felt in
a hurry on the practice field Monday.
The secondary, maligned by fans for its
early season lapses last year, such as the San
Jose State debacle, may be one of the
steadiest parts of the team this year. All-
Coast safety Rich Waters will be joined by
cornerback Larry Reynolds and Savann
Thompson, who both started as freshmen
last year. The weakest position may be
strong safety where the Cards must replace
Gerald Wilson.
Six lettermen
The Cards return six lettermen at the
linebacking spot, but this was the hardest
hit area of the team. Filling in for team lead
ers like Geb Church may not be easy, but

Chris says he has the people to do it.
Mike Michel should step in to take over
the kicking spot this year. He will also
handle the punting chores again.
The past two years Stanford has gotten off
to an awful start by losing its first three
games. This year's schedule demands that
Stanford play three of its first four games
away from home.
"We've got to see if we can't get off to a
better start this year. Maybe we've got to
make it a bigger challenge," Christiansen
said.
"It looks like we could be pretty good. I'm
just trying not to put myself out on a limb."

a strong and experienced line and all our
top runners from last year."
And two quarterbacks.
"We have the same two quarterbacks and

the same two will fight it out this spring to
see who has the job," said Christiansen. "It's
great to have those two guys," he added.
Combination
Last year the quarterbacks, Guy Benjamin
and Mike Cordova, combined for 21
touchdowns and 2357 passing yards. Hill,
who should be an All-American this year,
hauled down 55 passes for 916 yards and
seven touchdowns to rank seventh nation
ally in receiving.
The rushing attack, which added a new
dimension to Stanford's game plan last
year, should be even stronger this year. The
Cards' top four rushers return, led by
Academic All-American fullback Donny
Stevenson and tailback Ron Inge.
Christiansen plans to stay with the
1-formation he installed last year, and the
Cards will also install the option play in the
playbook this spring.
A couple of years ago, when the wishbone
was making Stanford's defense look silly,
the coaches put in the "50" or 3-4-4 de
fense. But this year the Cards will use a
multiple-front defense.
Different looks
"We're not going to stick to one defense
this season," said Christiansen, "We plan to
use both the odd and even front at different
times and give people a lot of different
looks. We feel we have the people capable of
doing a good job."
One of the people is second-team All-
American defensive end Duncan McColl,
who led Stanford in six defensive categories
last year.
Eight lettermen, including John Harris,
Geoff Kieburtz and Mike Wilkerson, return
to help McColl anchor the defense. And
Andy Kolesnikow, who missed last year
with a knee injury, made his presence felt in
a hurry on the practice field Monday.
The secondary, maligned by fans for its
early season lapses last year, such as the San
Jose State debacle, may be one of the
steadiest parts of the team this year. All-
Coast safety Rich Waters will be joined by
cornerback Larry Reynolds and Savann
Thompson, who both started as freshmen
last year. The weakest position may be
strong safety where the Cards must replace
Gerald Wilson.
Six lettermen
The Cards return six lettermen at the
linebacking spot, but this was the hardest
hit area of the team. Filling in for team lead
ers like Geb Church may not be easy, but

Chris says he has the people to do it.
Mike Michel should step in to take over
the kicking spot this year. He will also
handle the punting chores again.
The past two years Stanford has gotten off
to an awful start by losing its first three
games. This year's schedule demands that
Stanford play three of its first four games
away from home.
"We've got to see if we can't get off to a
better start this year. Maybe we've got to
make it a bigger challenge," Christiansen
said.
"It looks like we could be pretty good. I'm
just trying not to put myself out on a limb."

'Will miss spring football — track

3 Will miss spring football — overseas
It could have been late November.
Kain clouds hung ominously overhead as
Guy Benjamin lofted a pass to flanker Tony
Hill on the Stanford varsity football practice
field.
But it was last Monday, the first of 20
spring practices. There are exactly 147 days
left until the Cards journey to Penn State to
open their 1976 football season.
And there are 23 days remaining until
Stanford closes its spring workouts with the
second annual Alumni Game May 1 at 10:30
a.m. in the stadium.
At the moment, at least on paper, it looks
like the nation's bicentennial year may be
coach Jack Christiansen's best season since
taking over in 1972.
Forty lettermen
Among the 80 players Chris greeted on
Monday are 15 returning starters and 40
lettermen, from last year's 6-4-1 squad,
which won five of its last six games.
Christiansen, who with Cal coach Mike
White, is now the senior mentor in the
Pacific-8, feels that 1976 might be the Cards'
year but is hesitant to make any brash pre
dictions.
"This could be a good year for us. But
about the time you say it's going to be super
then you have injuries," said Christiansen.
"But we're definitely more of a known
quantity than we were last season, when we
had to play so many underclassmen."
With four new head coaches, the Pac-8
will have a very different look. "The confer
ence will be more wide open this year than
it's ever been before," said Christiansen.
"All four California teams could win the
championship. The four teams up north are
more unknown, but one of them could eas
ily become a contender."
30 points per game
Last year Stanford averaged 30 points per
game, and with the entire backfield return
ing, quarterbacks and all, and Ail-American
candidate Hill heading a fine corps of re
ceivers, the Cards may put on some offen
sive fireworks this year.
"This could be as explosive a team as
we've had in some time," said Christiansen.
"We have all the people back in the skill
positions, and I like to think we're pretty
solid everywhere.
"We'll have a great receiver in Tony Hill,
a strong and experienced line and all our
top runners from last year."

linebacking spot, but this was the hardest
hit area of the team. Filling in for team lead
ers like Geb Church may not be easy, but

Chris says he has the people to do it.
Mike Michel should step in to take over
the kicking spot this year. He will also
handle the punting chores again.
The past two years Stanford has gotten off
to an awful start by losing its first three
games. This year's schedule demands that
Stanford play three of its first four games
away from home.
"We've got to see if we can't get off to a
better start this year. Maybe we've got to
make it a bigger challenge," Christiansen
said.
"It looks like we could be pretty good. I'm
just trying not to put myself out on a limb."

'Will miss spring football — track
2 Will miss spring football — baseball
3 Will miss spring football — overseas
It could have been late November.
Kain clouds hung ominously overhead as
Guy Benjamin lofted a pass to flanker Tony
Hill on the Stanford varsity football practice
field.
But it was last Monday, the first of 20
spring practices. There are exactly 147 days
left until the Cards journey to Penn State to
open their 1976 football season.
And there are 23 days remaining until
Stanford closes its spring workouts with the
second annual Alumni Game May 1 at 10:30
a.m. in the stadium.
At the moment, at least on paper, it looks
like the nation's bicentennial year may be
coach Jack Christiansen's best season since
taking over in 1972.
Forty lettermen
Among the 80 players Chris greeted on
Monday are 15 returning starters and 40
lettermen, from last year's 6-4-1 squad,
which won five of its last six games.
Christiansen, who with Cal coach Mike
White, is now the senior mentor in the
Pacific-8, feels that 1976 might be the Cards'
year but is hesitant to make any brash pre
dictions.
"This could be a good year for us. But
about the time you say it's going to be super
then you have injuries," said Christiansen.
"But we're definitely more of a known
quantity than we were last season, when we
had to play so many underclassmen."
With four new head coaches, the Pac-8
will have a very different look. "The confer
ence will be more wide open this year than
it's ever been before," said Christiansen.
"All four California teams could win the
championship. The four teams up north are
more unknown, but one of them could eas
ily become a contender."
30 points per game
Last year Stanford averaged 30 points per
game, and with the entire backfield return
ing, quarterbacks and all, and Ail-American
candidate Hill heading a fine corps of re
ceivers, the Cards may put on some offen
sive fireworks this year.
"This could be as explosive a team as
we've had in some time," said Christiansen.
"We have all the people back in the skill
positions, and I like to think we're pretty
solid everywhere.
"We'll have a great receiver in Tony Hill,
a strong and experienced line and all our
top runners from last year."
And two quarterbacks.
"We have the same two quarterbacks and

the same two will fight it out this spring to
see who has the job," said Christiansen. "It's
great to have those two guys," he added.
Combination
Last year the quarterbacks, Guy Benjamin
and Mike Cordova, combined for 21
touchdowns and 2357 passing yards. Hill,
who should be an All-American this year,
hauled down 55 passes for 916 yards and
seven touchdowns to rank seventh nation
ally in receiving.
The rushing attack, which added a new
dimension to Stanford's game plan last
year, should be even stronger this year. The
Cards' top four rushers return, led by
Academic All-American fullback Donny
Stevenson and tailback Ron Inge.
Christiansen plans to stay with the
1-formation he installed last year, and the
Cards will also install the option play in the
playbook this spring.
A couple of years ago, when the wishbone
was making Stanford's defense look silly,
the coaches put in the "50" or 3-4-4 de
fense. But this year the Cards will use a
multiple-front defense.
Different looks
"We're not going to stick to one defense
this season," said Christiansen, "We plan to
use both the odd and even front at different
times and give people a lot of different
looks. We feel we have the people capable of
doing a good job."
One of the people is second-team All-
American defensive end Duncan McColl,
who led Stanford in six defensive categories
last year.
Eight lettermen, including John Harris,
Geoff Kieburtz and Mike Wilkerson, return
to help McColl anchor the defense. And
Andy Kolesnikow, who missed last year
with a knee injury, made his presence felt in
a hurry on the practice field Monday.
The secondary, maligned by fans for its
early season lapses last year, such as the San
Jose State debacle, may be one of the
steadiest parts of the team this year. All-
Coast safety Rich Waters will be joined by
cornerback Larry Reynolds and Savann
Thompson, who both started as freshmen
last year. The weakest position may be
strong safety where the Cards must replace
Gerald Wilson.

It could have been late November.
Kain clouds hung ominously overhead as
Guy Benjamin lofted a pass to flanker Tony
Hill on the Stanford varsity football practice
field.
But it was last Monday, the first of 20
spring practices. There are exactly 147 days
left until the Cards journey to Penn State to
open their 1976 football season.
And there are 23 days remaining until
Stanford closes its spring workouts with the
second annual Alumni Game May 1 at 10:30
a.m. in the stadium.
At the moment, at least on paper, it looks
like the nation's bicentennial year may be
coach Jack Christiansen's best season since
taking over in 1972.
Forty lettermen
Among the 80 players Chris greeted on
Monday are 15 returning starters and 40
lettermen, from last year's 6-4-1 squad,
which won five of its last six games.
Christiansen, who with Cal coach Mike
White, is now the senior mentor in the
Pacific-8, feels that 1976 might be the Cards'
year but is hesitant to make any brash pre
dictions.
"This could be a good year for us. But
about the time you say it's going to be super
then you have injuries," said Christiansen.
"But we're definitely more of a known
quantity than we were last season, when we
had to play so many underclassmen."
With four new head coaches, the Pac-8
will have a very different look. "The confer
ence will be more wide open this year than
it's ever been before," said Christiansen.
"All four California teams could win the
championship. The four teams up north are
more unknown, but one of them could eas
ily become a contender."
30 points per game
Last year Stanford averaged 30 points per
game, and with the entire backfield return
ing, quarterbacks and all, and Ail-American
candidate Hill heading a fine corps of re
ceivers, the Cards may put on some offen
sive fireworks this year.
"This could be as explosive a team as
we've had in some time," said Christiansen.
"We have all the people back in the skill
positions, and I like to think we're pretty
solid everywhere.
"We'll have a great receiver in Tony Hill,
a strong and experienced line and all our
top runners from last year."
And two quarterbacks.
"We have the same two quarterbacks and

the same two will fight it out this spring to
see who has the job," said Christiansen. "It's
great to have those two guys," he added.
Combination
Last year the quarterbacks, Guy Benjamin
and Mike Cordova, combined for 21
touchdowns and 2357 passing yards. Hill,
who should be an All-American this year,
hauled down 55 passes for 916 yards and
seven touchdowns to rank seventh nation
ally in receiving.
The rushing attack, which added a new
dimension to Stanford's game plan last
year, should be even stronger this year. The
Cards' top four rushers return, led by
Academic All-American fullback Donny
Stevenson and tailback Ron Inge.
Christiansen plans to stay with the
1-formation he installed last year, and the
Cards will also install the option play in the
playbook this spring.
A couple of years ago, when the wishbone
was making Stanford's defense look silly,
the coaches put in the "50" or 3-4-4 de
fense. But this year the Cards will use a
multiple-front defense.
Different looks
"We're not going to stick to one defense
this season," said Christiansen, "We plan to
use both the odd and even front at different
times and give people a lot of different
looks. We feel we have the people capable of
doing a good job."
One of the people is second-team All-
American defensive end Duncan McColl,
who led Stanford in six defensive categories
last year.
Eight lettermen, including John Harris,
Geoff Kieburtz and Mike Wilkerson, return
to help McColl anchor the defense. And
Andy Kolesnikow, who missed last year
with a knee injury, made his presence felt in
a hurry on the practice field Monday.
The secondary, maligned by fans for its
early season lapses last year, such as the San
Jose State debacle, may be one of the
steadiest parts of the team this year. All-
Coast safety Rich Waters will be joined by
cornerback Larry Reynolds and Savann
Thompson, who both started as freshmen
last year. The weakest position may be
strong safety where the Cards must replace
Gerald Wilson.
Six lettermen
The Cards return six lettermen at the
linebacking spot, but this was the hardest
hit area of the team. Filling in for team lead
ers like Geb Church may not be easy, but

Chris says he has the people to do it.
Mike Michel should step in to take over
the kicking spot this year. He will also
handle the punting chores again.
The past two years Stanford has gotten off
to an awful start by losing its first three
games. This year's schedule demands that
Stanford play three of its first four games
away from home.
"We've got to see if we can't get off to a
better start this year. Maybe we've got to
make it a bigger challenge," Christiansen
said.
"It looks like we could be pretty good. I'm
just trying not to put myself out on a limb."
