# Stanford sports flashback
## 
### 
With this weekend's big
tennis match against Trinity
rapidly approaching, the
Stanford sports flashback re
members two outstanding
tennis players of the past, Ted
Schroeder and Janie Albert.
Schroeder was one of the
best right-handers to play on
the Farm. In 1942, he won the
NCAA singles title and
teamed with Larry Dee to take
the doubles crown.
The same year, Schroeder
won the United States Lawn
Tennis Association (USLTA)
national championship in
men's singles. Previous win
ners included Bill Tilden,
l Don Budge, Bobby Riggs and

Jack Kramer.
Schroeder, a top Davis Cup
netter, also paired with
Kramer to take three USLTA
doubles titles.
Schroeder's illustrious
career reached a climax in
1949 when he added the pre
stigious Wimbledon men's
singles championship to his
list of achievements.
Janie Albert, recently in
ducted into the Stanford
sports Hall of Fame, was one
of the school's top women
netters.
Albert, the daughter of
former Stanford All-
American quarterback Fran
kie Albert, took the national

collegiate singles title in 1964
in an all-Stanford final.
Albert fought back from
near defeat to win 8-10, 7-5,
6-3, over doubles partner
Julie Heldman, a top player in
her own right.
The pair made it to the
doubles final, but, tired from
their marathon struggle, lost
in straight sets, 7-9, 4-6.
The national collegiates
were held on the Farm in
1967, and Albert again made
both finals, this time losing
the singles, but teaming with
a new partner, Julie Anthony,
to win the doubles champ
ionship. .
