# Cornett paces golfers to win

### David Georgette 
The Stanford women's golf
team upped its record to 2-0 yes
terday by beating five Northern
California Intercollegiate Athle
tic Conference (NCIAC) teams in
a tournament at the San Jose
Municipal Golf Course.
The Cards, defending NCIAC
champions, tallied a 323, 24
strokes ahead of host and
runner-up Santa Clara.
Senior Pat Cornett led Stan
ford to victory with the day's
best score of 74. Pam Palmieri,
who combines with Cornett to
form possibly the best duo in col
legiate golf, carded a 78 to take
third. Margaret Leonard of Santa
Clara recorded a 77 for second.
Windy weather
Severe wind conditions ham
pered the golfers all day. The
blustery gusts affected Cornett's
performance. "It was misera
ble." Cornett declared. "The
greens were in really bad shape,
too."
Her round of 74 was two over
par, but she said, "Under the
conditions, I was pleased with
my performance."
Palmieri, one of the longest
hitters in the women's amateur
circle, said, "I hit the ball pretty
well, especially considering the
wind." She said she could be
doing better. "I'm just not scor
ing as well as I should. I haven't
put 18 good holes together in
awhile."
Other rounds
In NCIAC] tournaments, the
best four individual scores are
totalled to give the team score.
Sally Voss and Ellen Sale contri
buted rounds of 84 and 87 to
yield Stanford's winning tally of
323.
Though Voss' 84 was good
enough for fifth, she wasn't satis
fied. "1 didn't play very well."
Sale downplayed her con
tribution to the team, choosing
instead to credit the team's two
outstanding veterans, Cornett

and Palmieri.
Cornett, Palmieri, Voss and
Sale were all selected to compete
for the all-star squad from the
NCIAC. The seven-member team
will take on the challenging all
stars from southern California in
a tournament at Alisal Ranch in
Solvang at the end of this month.
Prior to that engagement,
though, the Stanford team will
travel to the Sun Devil Invita
tional at Phoenix, April 22-23.
Coach Carroll Diaz sees that
tournament as being crucial in
acquiring confidence needed to
perform well in June at the As
sociation for Intercollegiate Ath
letics for Women Nationals at
Michigan State.
Stiff competition should be
encountered in Phoenix, Diaz
maintains. "Arizona State is al
ways a strong contender. Tulsa's
a top-ranked team, and they
should be there, too." San Diego
State and UCLA will also par
ticipate in the match.
Important role
Libby Docker, presently the
fifth golfer on the Stanford
squad, will have an important
role in Phoenix. Scoring in the
Arizona tournament is based on
the best four out of five scores,
and should one of the top four
falter, Docker's effort could be
decisive.
Diaz sums up Stanford's
chances simply. "The key will
be if all five play as well as they
have been so far this year."
Cornett and Palmieri, the
team's leaders, have high hopes
for the remainder of the season.
Says Palmieri, "I'm sure we'll
win the NCIAC. I'm looking for
ward to doing real well in
Arizona, and getting in the top
five in the nationals."
Cornett, a three-time varsity
letter winner, adds, "We're aim
ing to finish at the top in Arizona
and in the top five in the nation
als."

Cornett, Palmieri, Voss and
Sale were all selected to compete
for the all-star squad from the
NCIAC. The seven-member team
will take on the challenging all
stars from southern California in
a tournament at Alisal Ranch in
Solvang at the end of this month.
Prior to that engagement,
though, the Stanford team will
travel to the Sun Devil Invita

Coach Carroll Diaz sees that
tournament as being crucial in
acquiring confidence needed to
perform well in June at the As

Michigan State.
Stiff competition should be
encountered in Phoenix, Diaz
maintains. "Arizona State is al
ways a strong contender. Tulsa's
a top-ranked team, and they
should be there, too." San Diego
State and UCLA will also par
ticipate in the match.
Important role
Libby Docker, presently the
fifth golfer on the Stanford
squad, will have an important
role in Phoenix. Scoring in the
Arizona tournament is based on
the best four out of five scores,
and should one of the top four
falter, Docker's effort could be
decisive.
Diaz sums up Stanford's
chances simply. "The key will
be if all five play as well as they
have been so far this year."
Cornett and Palmieri, the
team's leaders, have high hopes
for the remainder of the season.
Says Palmieri, "I'm sure we'll

Cornett, a three-time varsity
letter winner, adds, "We're aim

a shot with his baseline backhand. Maze leads Stanford into this weekend's matches against Trinity.
The Stanford women's golf
team upped its record to 2-0 yes
terday by beating five Northern
California Intercollegiate Athle
tic Conference (NCIAC) teams in
a tournament at the San Jose
Municipal Golf Course.
The Cards, defending NCIAC
champions, tallied a 323, 24
strokes ahead of host and
runner-up Santa Clara.
Senior Pat Cornett led Stan
ford to victory with the day's
best score of 74. Pam Palmieri,
who combines with Cornett to
form possibly the best duo in col
legiate golf, carded a 78 to take
third. Margaret Leonard of Santa
Clara recorded a 77 for second.
Windy weather
Severe wind conditions ham
pered the golfers all day. The
blustery gusts affected Cornett's
performance. "It was misera
ble." Cornett declared. "The
greens were in really bad shape,
too."
Her round of 74 was two over
par, but she said, "Under the
conditions, I was pleased with
my performance."
Palmieri, one of the longest
hitters in the women's amateur
circle, said, "I hit the ball pretty
well, especially considering the
wind." She said she could be
doing better. "I'm just not scor
ing as well as I should. I haven't
put 18 good holes together in
awhile."
Other rounds
In NCIAC] tournaments, the
best four individual scores are
totalled to give the team score.
Sally Voss and Ellen Sale contri
buted rounds of 84 and 87 to
yield Stanford's winning tally of
323.
Though Voss' 84 was good
enough for fifth, she wasn't satis
fied. "1 didn't play very well."
Sale downplayed her con
tribution to the team, choosing
instead to credit the team's two
outstanding veterans, Cornett

and Palmieri.
Cornett, Palmieri, Voss and
