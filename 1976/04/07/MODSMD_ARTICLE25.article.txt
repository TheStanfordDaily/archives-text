# Guardino homer leads Card rout
## 
### George Anders 
Sparked by a three run home
run from first baseman Tom
Guardino, the Stanford baseball
team beat San Jose State 10-2 in a
game played at San Jose yester
day afternoon.
Freshman pitcher Rob Irwin
took the win, striking out four
and giving up two runs in six
innings. He raised his won-loss
record to 3-1.
Guardino's sixth inning shot
was his seventh home run this
year, and made him the club
leader in RBIs with 36.
"It was quite questionable,"
Guardino recalled after the
game. "1 hit a fastball off the end
of the bat, but it had a good
trajectory. 1 saw the guy running
back for it, and he went up at the
wall.
Scraped over wall
"It must have just scraped over
the end of the wall. At first, I
thought maybe the outfielder
even caught it. I didn't know it
was out until I rounded second."
"Tom's a line-drive hitter,"
Card coach Ray Young observed.
"But he's probably the most
powerful hitter on the team.
With his home runs, it's a matter
of whether he gets the ball up in
the air. A lot of them end up
being doubles."
A double by Card third base
man Gary Pitchford brought in
three runs in the fifth. Overall,
the Cards got 12 hits, including
three from catcher Bruce Wal
ters.
"Just about everyone got at
least one hit," Young said.
For Irwin, yesterday's appear
ance was his first in 10 days. "He
was warming up some Saturday
night," Young recalled, "but he
didn't get in. Today he got his
chance. He was a little rusty at
the start today, but he loosened
up."
Another start
Young said that on the basis of
Irwin's performance the
freshman will get a start next
week.
Reviewing the game, Young

noted that "it was very windy
today. The conditions were
hardly ideal. We only stole two
bases, but we were running the
whole game."
Senior Bernie Hittner pitched
the last three innings for Stan
ford, shutting out the Spartans

and picking up a save.
Young said he is trying to
work with the team "to develop a
pattern where we can play all of
our games the same and not
point to weekends."
The Cards play Sacramento
State today at 2:30 p.m. in Sun

ken Diamond. Junior John Yan
dle will be the starting pitcher
for Stanford, according to
Young.
