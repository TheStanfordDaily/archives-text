Sailors take 10th
Competing against most of the
top college sailing teams, the
Stanford sailing team took 10th
place in a field of 14 at the Yacht
Racing Invitational, held Sun
day at Kings Point, N.Y.
The regatta, won by Rhode Is
land, featured 11 of the top 15
college teams, as ranked by
Yacht Racing.
"We didn't sail all that well,"
Robber Baron team member
Alan Andrews asserted. "We
were sailing classes of boats we
had never sailed before. Also, we
weren't able to practice much be
fore the races."
The regatta, scheduled to con
sist of 14 races, was originally to
be run Saturday, but was post
poned because of excessive
winds. On Sunday, overly light
winds "had us sitting around
until 3:30" waiting for wind,
Andrews noted.
Because of the delays, only six
races were run. In those races,
Hugh Cullman, sailing alone in
the Laser division, had a third
and a fourth, and Andrews, sail
ing with Russell Winslow, cap
tured a fourth.
Most of the other schools at the
invitational had large sailing
programs, which, Andrews
stated, "put us at a slight disad
vantage.
"We learned a fair amount
from the races," Andrews said,
"because we were competing
against so many good teams. I'd
say there were 13 good teams in

the water at a time, instead of
about four in most of our races."
The Robber Barons also com
peted in two West Coast regattas
over the weekend. With the top
six team members at King's
Point, the Barons took third in a
Northern California Intercol
legiate Sailing Association (N
-CISA) regatta Saturday, and
fourth in a NCISA regatta Sun
day.
As a result, Andrews said, the
Barons slipped to second place
in the NCISA, one point behind
Sonoma State.
"If our best members had been
on the West Coast, we would still
be in first place," Andrews as
serted. "But then, if we didn't
take our best members east, we
wouldn't have done as well
there."
The Barons have one NCISA
regatta remaining, on Apr. 24 at
Santa Cruz. Andrews said,
"We'll have a tough time" re
gaining first, "but I think we
have a very good chance."

coach of the year by the Northern
California Aquatics Federation.
Lambert last year led the Cards
to a 22-5 record, a share of the
Pacific-8 title and a fourth place
in the NCAA tounrnament.

Sailors take 10th
Competing against most of the
top college sailing teams, the
Stanford sailing team took 10th
place in a field of 14 at the Yacht
Racing Invitational, held Sun
day at Kings Point, N.Y.
The regatta, won by Rhode Is
land, featured 11 of the top 15
college teams, as ranked by
Yacht Racing.
"We didn't sail all that well,"
Robber Baron team member
Alan Andrews asserted. "We
were sailing classes of boats we
had never sailed before. Also, we
weren't able to practice much be
fore the races."
The regatta, scheduled to con
sist of 14 races, was originally to
be run Saturday, but was post
poned because of excessive
winds. On Sunday, overly light
winds "had us sitting around
until 3:30" waiting for wind,
Andrews noted.
Because of the delays, only six
races were run. In those races,
Hugh Cullman, sailing alone in
the Laser division, had a third
and a fourth, and Andrews, sail
ing with Russell Winslow, cap
tured a fourth.
Most of the other schools at the
invitational had large sailing
programs, which, Andrews
stated, "put us at a slight disad
vantage.
"We learned a fair amount
from the races," Andrews said,
"because we were competing
against so many good teams. I'd
say there were 13 good teams in

the water at a time, instead of
about four in most of our races."
The Robber Barons also com
peted in two West Coast regattas
over the weekend. With the top
six team members at King's
Point, the Barons took third in a
Northern California Intercol
legiate Sailing Association (N
-CISA) regatta Saturday, and
fourth in a NCISA regatta Sun
day.
As a result, Andrews said, the
Barons slipped to second place
in the NCISA, one point behind
Sonoma State.
"If our best members had been
on the West Coast, we would still
be in first place," Andrews as
serted. "But then, if we didn't
take our best members east, we
wouldn't have done as well
there."
The Barons have one NCISA
regatta remaining, on Apr. 24 at
Santa Cruz. Andrews said,
"We'll have a tough time" re
gaining first, "but I think we
have a very good chance."
