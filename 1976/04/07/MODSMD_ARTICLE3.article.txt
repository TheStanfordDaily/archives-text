# Carter squeaks by Udall; Jackson takes New York
## 
### 
MILWAUKEE, Wis. (AP) — Jimmy
Carter captured the Wisconsin Democ
ratic presidential primary election
early this morning, winning on ballots
that were tallied after Rep. Morris
Udall staged a premature victory rally.
Sen. Henry Jackson won New York's
contest for Democratic delegates.
President Gerald Ford easily won
the Republican primary in Wisconsin,
sweeping past challenger Ronald
Reagan and saying he was pleased
with a 55 percent victory that ex
ceeded expectations.
But last night's drama was reserved
for the Democrats. Carter went to bed
apparently convinced he was a narrow
loser to Udall, although he never con
ceded. The Arizona congressman said
he had "a very, very good win" in a
state he had made a major campaign
target.
"Oh, how sweet it is," Udall told
cheering supporters last night. It
wasn't sweet for long.
Slender margin
The vote counting showed Carter
gaining steadily and ultimately made
him the victor by a slender margin.
With 95 percent of Wisconsin's pre
cincts reporting, Carter had 37 percent
of the vote, Udall 36 percent. That
translated to 26 Democratic conven
tion votes for Carter, 25 for Udall.
It was a close one, but it was a win

where Udall had made a heavy in
vestment of time and money.
While Jackson was in clear com
mand in the New York primary, his
delegate margin was short of the clear
majority he had forecast. With 96 per
cent of the precincts counted, Jackson
won or led for 104 of the state's 274
delegates. Udall was second, with 72
of his delegates leading.
The New York delegates were
elected in separate contests in each of
the state's 39 congressional districts.
Udall projected
Udall's early Wisconsin lead —
which led ABC and NBC to project a
narrow victory for him — was built on
votes from the Madison area, site of the
University of Wisconsin. He won big

there, by a margin of about 22,000. But
it wasn't enough to withstand Carter.
And Carter wound up with his sixth
victory in seven primary elections.
The close race in Wisconsin, and his
third place standing in the New York
delegate competition, where 33 of his
supporters led for convention seats,
did not seem likely to add to Carter's
campaign momentum. But Carter al
ready is the frontrunning candidate,
and so he remained.
The future for Udall is unclear. He
badly needed the Wisconsin win to
fuel his campaign with money and
psychological headway.
There was one major casualty:
former Oklahoma Sen. Fred Harris ran
far back in both states and called a
news conference for tomorrow amid
indications he would curtail, if not
drop, his primary campaign.
Three-man race
Now, the Democratic contest ap
pears to be a three-man race again,
with Carter, Jackson and Udall due to
square off next in Pennsylvania on
April 27.
Sen. Hubert Humphrey of Min
nesota could be a beneficiary of yes
terday's primary verdicts. Anything
that tends to open the race and divide
delegate support could provide run
ning room later for the 1968 nominee,
who has said he may become a candi
date after the primaries are over.
In Washington, a Ford spokesman
said the president was pleased with a
Wisconsin victory that exceeded his
expectations. It was Ford's sixth prim
ary victory, against one Reagan win.
Furthermore, most of the uncommit
ted Republican delegates from New
York are considered likely to wind up
for Ford.

In Washington, a Ford spokesman

MILWAUKEE, Wis. (AP) — Jimmy
Carter captured the Wisconsin Democ
ratic presidential primary election
early this morning, winning on ballots
that were tallied after Rep. Morris
Udall staged a premature victory rally.
Sen. Henry Jackson won New York's
contest for Democratic delegates.
President Gerald Ford easily won
the Republican primary in Wisconsin,
sweeping past challenger Ronald
Reagan and saying he was pleased
with a 55 percent victory that ex
ceeded expectations.
But last night's drama was reserved
for the Democrats. Carter went to bed
apparently convinced he was a narrow
loser to Udall, although he never con
ceded. The Arizona congressman said
he had "a very, very good win" in a
state he had made a major campaign
target.
"Oh, how sweet it is," Udall told
cheering supporters last night. It
wasn't sweet for long.
Slender margin
The vote counting showed Carter
gaining steadily and ultimately made
him the victor by a slender margin.
With 95 percent of Wisconsin's pre
cincts reporting, Carter had 37 percent
of the vote, Udall 36 percent. That
translated to 26 Democratic conven
tion votes for Carter, 25 for Udall.
It was a close one, but it was a win

where Udall had made a heavy in
vestment of time and money.
While Jackson was in clear com
mand in the New York primary, his
delegate margin was short of the clear
majority he had forecast. With 96 per
cent of the precincts counted, Jackson
won or led for 104 of the state's 274
delegates. Udall was second, with 72
of his delegates leading.
The New York delegates were
elected in separate contests in each of
the state's 39 congressional districts.
Udall projected
Udall's early Wisconsin lead —
which led ABC and NBC to project a
narrow victory for him — was built on
votes from the Madison area, site of the
University of Wisconsin. He won big

there, by a margin of about 22,000. But
it wasn't enough to withstand Carter.
And Carter wound up with his sixth
victory in seven primary elections.
The close race in Wisconsin, and his
third place standing in the New York
delegate competition, where 33 of his
supporters led for convention seats,
did not seem likely to add to Carter's
campaign momentum. But Carter al
ready is the frontrunning candidate,
and so he remained.
The future for Udall is unclear. He
badly needed the Wisconsin win to
fuel his campaign with money and
psychological headway.
There was one major casualty:
former Oklahoma Sen. Fred Harris ran
far back in both states and called a
news conference for tomorrow amid
indications he would curtail, if not
drop, his primary campaign.
Three-man race
Now, the Democratic contest ap
pears to be a three-man race again,
with Carter, Jackson and Udall due to
square off next in Pennsylvania on
April 27.
