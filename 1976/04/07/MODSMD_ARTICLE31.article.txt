Labor leaders offer plan
SAN FRANCISCO — Labor leaders late last
night handed the city a four-point plan for negotia
tions, calling for immediate agreement on a con
troversial money issue to end the week-long strike
by some municipal employes.
The proposal also called for mediation if the
Hoard of Supervisors would not agree to the prop
osed bargaining guidelines.
The meeting between city and labor representa
tives recessed while supervisors caucused to con
sider the proposal.
Karlier yesterday, labor leaders called for a gen
eral strike in support of the walkout which has shut
down public transportation in the city.
The head of the San Francisco Labor Council said
a date has been set for a "total shutdown of tin;
community," but negotiations could change the
plans.
Mayor Ceorge Moscone said the city had made
preparations for a general strike, though he asserted
he did not believe there would be one.
The main impact of the pay dispute has been felt
by the 250,000 persons who normally rely on pub
lic transit and by school children whose buses were
halted by pickets.
The transportation situation was further tangled
when 500 of the city's 850 taxis were [lulled off the
street in an unrelated labor dispute.
The executive committee of the San Francisco
Labor Council unanimously approved a motion
yesterday morning that vowed "escalation, cooper
ation and information to the end of complete sup
port by all AFL-CIO unions to the workers presently
on strike."
Leaders of 1000 striking trades union workers
have repeatedly threatened to launch a general
strike for the first time since 1934, but yesterday's
action was the first formal step in that direction.
John Crowley, executive secretary of the Labor
Council, said such a strike would be aimed at clos
ing theColden Gate Bridge, Bay Bridge, San Fran
cisco International Airport, other public facilities
and hotels and restaurants.
The Labor Council motion called for "coordina
tion with all sectors of the labor movement of San
Francisco for a general strike."
Crowley said rank-and-file union members
would vote on such an a» Hon,out he did not say
when.
Moscone said it would take at least a week for a
general strike to begin. He said police and firemen
had promised to stay on the job.
Hughes' death: 'ordinary'
HOUSTON — Doctors discovered yesterday that
Howard Hughes had died "an ordinary death" due
to kidney failure, while government agents
checked fingerprints to make positive identifica
tion of the billionaire recluse.
The Internal Revenue Service also said that il
Hughes left his fortune to medical research, which
his lawyer says he may have done, it will escape
taxes.
Otherwise, the maximum estate tax of 77 percent
could apply against much of Hughes' money, esti

mated at between $1.5 billion and $2 billion.
"As far as I'm concerned it's an ordinary death."
said Dr. Joseph Jachimczyk, Harris County medical
examiner. "It's just that it was not an ordinary per
son."
Hughes died Monday at age 70 while en route by
plane from the Mexican resort of Acapulco for med
ical treatment here.
Jachimczyk said Hughes' relatives, whom he did
not name, granted a request for the autopsy. A
spokesman for Hughes'company had initially said
the billionaire had died of a stroke.
Protestors rally in Peking
TOKYO — China's official People's Daily
warned yesterday against "rabid resistance and
trouble making from class enemies at home and
abroad" in an apparent criticism of mass demonst
rations in Peking's main square.
Dp tu 100,000 Chinese surged angrily through
Tien An Men Square Monday to protest the removal
of memorial wreaths honoring the late Premier
Chou En-lai. Small, scattered protests continued
yesterday.
A Peking resident reached by telephone from
Tokyo said youths made a brief assault on a public
building but were easily repulsed by soldiers.
Neither the official Chinese news agency,
Hsinhua, nor Peking radio reported specifically on
the movement to honor Chou, nor the sometimes
violent demonstrations.
The editorial in People's Daily, broadcast here by
Hsinhua, said:
"It is necessary to stop the class enemies from
spreading rumors, creating disturbances, stirring
up the masses to fight one another, sabotaging the
revolution and disrupting production."
Italy faces government crisis
ROMK - Socialists threatened yesterday to top
ple the fragile 55-day-old Christian-Democrat
cabinet over the explosive issue of abortion and
possibly pave the way for a Communist role in
governing Italy.
The United States has consistently opposed any
such role for the Communists because of Italy's
strategic position in the North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization. Some U.S. officials hinted that there
would be economic reprisals if the Communists are
let into the government.
The Socialists, the third largest party, have the
power to bring down the government and force a
general election.
Calling for an immediate meeting with Christian
Democrat leaders, the Socialists said the only alter
native to early elections would be a national
emergency government with a policy-making role
for the Communists.
Premier Aldo Moro, a Christian Democrat, has
been operating with a mi nority government only by
the good will of the Socialists, who left the ruling
coalition but have abstai ned on votes of confidence.
That attitude is now threatened by the dispute
over abortion
The Christian Democrats, spurred by the Vatican,
joined the right-wing Italian Social Movement

party last week to pass an amendment restricting
abortions to rape and therapeutic cases. This led to
a weekend demonstration by more than 50.000
feminists attacking Moro and the Vatican.
Abortions are illegal in Italy under a 1930 Fascist
law, and the Vatican recently called abortions "a
regression to barbarity."
Soliah trial continues
SACRAMENTO — The prosecution in theSteven
Soliah bank robbery trial began yesterday to try to
link ammunition and a weapon found at Patricia
Hearst's San Francisco house to the robbery scene
here.
U.S. Atty. Dwayne keyes said evidence would
show th.it ammunition found at the Crocker Na
tional Bank robbery scene came from the same
machine that stamped out ammunition found at
Hearst's house.
During a courtroom argument outside of the
jury's presence, Keyes made that comment and said
an FBI expert from Washington would testify to
that effect later.
Soliah, a 27-year-old house painter who became
I fearst's < ompanion during her fugitive days, is the
only one charged in the April 21, 1975, robbery in
which a woman customer was shot to death.
