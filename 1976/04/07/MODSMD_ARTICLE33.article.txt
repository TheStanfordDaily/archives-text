President Richard Lyman said last
night that he accepted a recommenda
tion from Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons that the University not
require employers to indicate whether
they discriminate on the basis of sex
ual orientation.
Interviewed on kZSU's Campus
Conference, Lyman referred to a letter
in which Lyons advired him, "It sim
ply is not our business to be requiring
others to do such things — unless of
course the law commands us to do so."
Lyman said he had asked Lyons to
consider the reactions of all the deans
of the schools and James Siena, legal
adviser to the President, toward the
recent recommendations of the Com
mittee on Services to Students (COSS)
concerning policies at the Career
Planning and Placement Center
(CP PC).
However, Lyman added that Lyons
found substantial agreement among
COSS members and others he con-

suited that it was "highly desirable"
for recruiters to provide, as tully as
possible, information as to the per
sonal characteristics which they re
gard as job-related.
"What we're trying toget at," Lyman
said, "is the notion that employers
should provide as lull a set of informa
tion as they can about what it is they
are looking for and what it is they are
treating as irrelevant."
Lyman reported that Lyons will ask
the CPPC to experiment with various
methods for getting employers to pro
vide information regarding job-related
characteristics.
A general letter of inquiry directed
at recruiters was suggested by Lyons as
one possible method.
"I think what he has in mind," said
Lyman, "is directing a letter to all re
cruiters that urges upon them the de
sirability of their making clear what it
is they take into account, particularly
in the way of personal characteristics."
