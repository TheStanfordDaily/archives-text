## Groups seek funding

Last of two parts
The Stanford Band and the Daily
will be requesting fee assessment ap
proval on the April 14 and 15 ASSU
ballot.
The ASSU Speakers Bureau, whose
petition was turned in early yesterday,
will also request a fee assessment on
the upcoming ballot.
The Stanford Band is requesting a $1
assessment per student for both au
tumn and winter quarters.
According to Kent Blumberg, the
band's business manager, the fee as
sessment would provide the only
source of income for the band's three
annual out-of-state trips.
"Our previous out-of-state trips,
especially the one to Washington, D.C.
this fall before school began, have been
excellent publicity for Stanford," said
Blumberg.
Two major trips
During next year's football season,
the band plans two major trips, one to
Pennsylvania State University and
another to the University of Michigan.
"The trip to Michigan will be particu
larly important if the game is tele
vised," said Blumberg.
Another trip to theNorthwest during
the basketball season, either to one of
the Oregon universities or the Univer
sity of Washington, is also scheduled
for the "Red Vest Band," a limited
number of band members, for the com
ing year, he said.
"The trips can be crucial to main
taining the over-all spirit of the band

for the entire year," said Blumberg.
"Successful trips can make the differ
ence between an exciting year of per
formances or a dull one."
Through the $2 fee assessment,
ASSU will provide the band with ap
proximately $20,000 for autumn and
winter quarters to cover gas, food and
incidental expenses for the out-of-state
trips.
'Massive earning schemes'
"If we are not allocated the fee as
sessment, we would still make the
tripsback East,"stated Blumberg, "but
it would involve massive earning
schemes and the possible cancellation
of the basketball season trip."
According to Blumberg, the possi
bility of contributions for trip funding
from Stanford alumni are small.
"Our style of entertainment is first of
all geared toward students," said
Blumberg. "We do admit that we can
be pretty irreverent â€” we have re
ceived some nasty letters from
alumni," he commented.
The Daily is requesting a fee assess
ment of $1 in autumn, winter and
spring quarters.
'Cut back'
"If we don't receive the assessment
we'll have to cut back operations dras
tically, and the Daily may only appear
once or twice a week and with fewer
pages," said Daily Editor Mark Simo
nian.
"We would not stop printing," he
added.
At only 2.5 cents per issue for each
