## Groups seek funding

Last of two parts
The Stanford Band and the Daily
will be requesting fee assessment ap
proval on the April 14 and 15 ASSU
ballot.
The ASSU Speakers Bureau, whose
petition was turned in early yesterday,
will also request a fee assessment on
the upcoming ballot.
The Stanford Band is requesting a $1
assessment per student for both au
tumn and winter quarters.
According to Kent Blumberg, the
band's business manager, the fee as
sessment would provide the only
source of income for the band's three
annual out-of-state trips.
"Our previous out-of-state trips,
especially the one to Washington, D.C.
this fall before school began, have been
excellent publicity for Stanford," said
Blumberg.
Two major trips
During next year's football season,
the band plans two major trips, one to
Pennsylvania State University and
another to the University of Michigan.
"The trip to Michigan will be particu
larly important if the game is tele
vised," said Blumberg.
Another trip to theNorthwest during
the basketball season, either to one of
the Oregon universities or the Univer
sity of Washington, is also scheduled
for the "Red Vest Band," a limited
number of band members, for the com
ing year, he said.
"The trips can be crucial to main
taining the over-all spirit of the band

for the entire year," said Blumberg.
"Successful trips can make the differ
ence between an exciting year of per
formances or a dull one."
Through the $2 fee assessment,
ASSU will provide the band with ap
proximately $20,000 for autumn and
winter quarters to cover gas, food and
incidental expenses for the out-of-state
trips.
'Massive earning schemes'
"If we are not allocated the fee as
sessment, we would still make the
tripsback East,"stated Blumberg, "but
it would involve massive earning
schemes and the possible cancellation
of the basketball season trip."
According to Blumberg, the possi
bility of contributions for trip funding
from Stanford alumni are small.
"Our style of entertainment is first of
all geared toward students," said
Blumberg. "We do admit that we can
be pretty irreverent â€” we have re
ceived some nasty letters from
alumni," he commented.
The Daily is requesting a fee assess
ment of $1 in autumn, winter and
spring quarters.
'Cut back'
"If we don't receive the assessment
we'll have to cut back operations dras
tically, and the Daily may only appear
once or twice a week and with fewer
pages," said Daily Editor Mark Simo
nian.
"We would not stop printing," he
added.
At only 2.5 cents per issue for each
student, members of the Daily staff
said they felt this a "very small price to
pay to keep production going."
In 1 975, the Daily suffered a $40,295
loss due to inadequate investment in
management as well as the region's
depressed economy and the resulting
small advertising budgets for firms,
according to an evaluation of the
paper's operation prepared by Daily
Business Manager Jim Baer.
The evaluation notes that the publi
cation has become a more efficient fi
nancial operation during tin; present
year, but that "funds to help develop
programs and to assure competent
management" are still necessary.
"This year we have tightened up our
operations in every area where we
exercise control over our financial
situation," Baer reported, pointing out
that the Daily has cut down expenses
by $14,652 this year.
The establishment of an accounting
system, increased control of accounts
receivable and long-range financial
planning through an improved com
puter system are responsible for the
lowering of over-all costs, Baer said.
"But production costs, an area
which we do not control, rise an in
credibleamount every year," he noted.
The Daily staff foresees an increase
of approximately $18,000 in produc
tion costs as compared to last year,
Baer said.
"Ad rates are up over 30 percent
from last year," said Simonian, "but

we just can't make it on ads alone even
with our ad rates now raised to the
maximu m."
In an effort to obtain student and
community input regarding the func
tions oft he Daily, a special SCIRE class
has been established to evaluate the
paper's performance, Simonian said.
"We're also looking into endow
ment alternatives and a system of paid
subscriptions for distribution in Palo
Alto." he reported. "But we still need
the moral and financial support of stu
dents above all."
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is re
questing a $1 assessment for autumn
quarter only.
According to Ted Mitchell, current
acting director of the Speakers Bureau
and next year's director, "The func
tions of the bureau are represented in
actuality."
The Speakers Bureau assessment
will provide funds for transportation
of guest speakers and honorariums.
Because of its special capacity, Mitch
till maintains that the "bureau com
plements all other programs on cam
pus" by providing the University
community with exposure to numer
ous personalities.
If the assessment is not granted,
there would either be no official
speakers'bureau inviting speakers on
campus, or "we would have to charge
admission to events, which defeats the
purpose of the speakers' appearances
by limiting our audience," Mitchell
said.
