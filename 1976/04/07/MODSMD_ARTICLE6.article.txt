"There is nothing that makes me proud to say I am a
student here at Stanford. This place is boring as hell,
there is no feeling of student unity," said Warren
height, a Synergy resident.
Leight, Tom Galligan, Thomas "Hoosier" Hinkamp
and E. Morgan Entrekin form the D. Leight slate and
claim to be counterculture Council of Presidents (COP)
candidates.
"You might say we're cut from a different cloth,"
said Leight, a junior in communication.
"We view the University through dissatisfied eyes,
through crepe colored glasses," added junior Galligan.
a political science major.
Leight emphasized that his slate was offering an al
ternative to the "run of the mill" COP candidates.
"We're the anti-experience candidates. All the
people running (for the COP) who have 'experience'
haven't done anything," said Leight. "Student gov
ernment is out of touch with the mainstream of the
student body."
"We're interested in the typical, apathetic student
instead of the bureaucratic groupies," said Entrekin, a

is the head Hoover," said Leight.
The slate refused to make promises because "we
don't know if anything can be done," according to
Leight.
"What we're offering is a new attitude and no more
bullshit," he said. "If we're elected, maybe we'll make
government fun so students won't be apathetic."
The slate has suggested not giving the Daily a fee
assessment and using the money to re-sod the Quad so
students will have a place to "hang out."
"There's something wrong when the main hang out
is Meyer Library," said Leight.
Fntrekin added that the University was too profes
sionally geared. "Why don't we teach students how to
fill in income tax forms?"
When asked how such a program would be funded,
Galligan, a Roble resident suggested, "Have a car
wash."
"We're opening up government to the students. Uni
versity committees form another bureaucratic layer
and do not get things accomplished," said Hinkamp.
"And you're still working with a small, select group
of people," added Leight.
Students may view the slate as a joke, but the slate
insists that the "other ruvs are a joke."
