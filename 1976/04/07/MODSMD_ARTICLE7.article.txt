## Opinions editorial COP endorsement 
### 
In recent years, the ASSU Council of
Presidents (COP) has been too weak to
effectively challenge the University.
Things don't look much better for next
year.
None of this year's COP slates seems
strong enough to significantly alter the
University's policy toward students. But
of the four tickets, the slate of Dan How
ard, Keith Archuleta, Liz Ryll and Bill
Tyndall offers the most hope. Thus, with
some reservations, we endorse the How
ard ticket.
Judging from past performance, the
Howard slate knows how to effect
change. Howard showed evidence of
leadership in his co-authorship of the
"Howard Report" on minority financial
aids. While never followed up, the How
ard Report at least created a basis for
change by critically examining current
policies and suggesting alternatives to a
system which is slowly transforming
Stanford into a school for the rich.
.Similarly, Archuleta has de
monstrated leadership by putting the
Real News back on its feet as a finan
cially viable publication, and by helping
to promote the resurgence of a nearly
defunct Black Student Union.
In its platform, the Howard slate
shows it would try to move Stanford in
the proper direction, though it often
doesn't quite know how to do it.
The Howard slate is on record as say
ing it will lobby to put a student on the
Board of Trustees, to bar employers who
discriminate against gays from the
Career Planning and Placement Service
and to see that Asian-Americans are
given "minority" status by the Financial
Aids Office.
We agree with these planks, but fear
that the technique of lobbying will not be
enough. Model programs, petitions and
protest are also necessary weapons.
The Howard slate has come up with an

excellent proposal to reinstate the Club
Sports program, by fee assessment if
necessary, to show the University that
students want these activities. We only
wish it had come up with more propos
als which spelled out a method for ac
tion.
While supporting Howard, we do take
strong exception to the ticket's plan to
move ASSU Senate elections back to the
spring. As we pointed out two years ago
before students defeated a constitutional
amendment to do just that, spring elec
tions disenfranchise incoming
freshmen, and lead to an even more con
fusing clutter of electioneering at this
time of year than we now must bear.
The proposals of the Howard slate are
not all that different from those of the
rival group of Vic Petroff, Carole Houck,
Deric Jennings and A 1 Tomaszczuk. But
the Petroff slate's record shows little
evidence it will challenge the University
in any way. While the slate members are
sincere, they are deeply rooted in stan
dard student politics, and offer few new
ideas in their platform.
The Petroff slate also fails to realize the
financial constraints the ASSU now
faces, with its University funding being
halved and its "big bucks" projects slip
ping into the red.
Petroff proposals such as drawing
from ASSU reserves to maintain the COP
discretionary fund at its current level,
and to launch a "full-scale concerted ef
fort to recruit minority student candi
dates for admission" may prove fiscally
disastrous.
The other two tickets, comprised
mainly of members of the Chaparral and
residents of Synergy House, are basically
anti-student-government "joke" slates.
We think the ASSU is too much of a
joke as it is. We hope it will change its
ways and effectively challenge the Uni
versity. But don't bet on it.

ard ticket.
Judging from past performance, the
Howard slate knows how to effect
change. Howard showed evidence of
leadership in his co-authorship of the
"Howard Report" on minority financial
aids. While never followed up, the How
ard Report at least created a basis for
change by critically examining current
policies and suggesting alternatives to a
system which is slowly transforming
Stanford into a school for the rich.
.Similarly, Archuleta has de
monstrated leadership by putting the
Real News back on its feet as a finan
cially viable publication, and by helping
to promote the resurgence of a nearly
defunct Black Student Union.
In its platform, the Howard slate
shows it would try to move Stanford in
the proper direction, though it often
doesn't quite know how to do it.
The Howard slate is on record as say
ing it will lobby to put a student on the
Board of Trustees, to bar employers who
discriminate against gays from the
Career Planning and Placement Service
and to see that Asian-Americans are
given "minority" status by the Financial
Aids Office.
We agree with these planks, but fear
that the technique of lobbying will not be
enough. Model programs, petitions and
protest are also necessary weapons.
The Howard slate has come up with an

excellent proposal to reinstate the Club
Sports program, by fee assessment if
necessary, to show the University that
students want these activities. We only
wish it had come up with more propos
als which spelled out a method for ac
tion.
While supporting Howard, we do take
strong exception to the ticket's plan to
move ASSU Senate elections back to the
spring. As we pointed out two years ago
before students defeated a constitutional
amendment to do just that, spring elec
tions disenfranchise incoming
freshmen, and lead to an even more con
fusing clutter of electioneering at this
time of year than we now must bear.
The proposals of the Howard slate are
not all that different from those of the
rival group of Vic Petroff, Carole Houck,
Deric Jennings and A 1 Tomaszczuk. But
the Petroff slate's record shows little
evidence it will challenge the University
in any way. While the slate members are
sincere, they are deeply rooted in stan
dard student politics, and offer few new
ideas in their platform.
The Petroff slate also fails to realize the
financial constraints the ASSU now
faces, with its University funding being
halved and its "big bucks" projects slip
ping into the red.
Petroff proposals such as drawing
from ASSU reserves to maintain the COP
discretionary fund at its current level,
and to launch a "full-scale concerted ef
fort to recruit minority student candi
dates for admission" may prove fiscally
disastrous.
The other two tickets, comprised
mainly of members of the Chaparral and
residents of Synergy House, are basically
anti-student-government "joke" slates.
We think the ASSU is too much of a
joke as it is. We hope it will change its
ways and effectively challenge the Uni
versity. But don't bet on it.
In recent years, the ASSU Council of
Presidents (COP) has been too weak to
effectively challenge the University.
Things don't look much better for next
year.
None of this year's COP slates seems
strong enough to significantly alter the
University's policy toward students. But
of the four tickets, the slate of Dan How
ard, Keith Archuleta, Liz Ryll and Bill
Tyndall offers the most hope. Thus, with
some reservations, we endorse the How
ard ticket.
