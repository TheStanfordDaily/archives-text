Bier, Alfadl

The Stanford's Women's
Center would like to clarify some
of the points made by Barbara
Glenn in her column in the Daily
April 1.
Contrary to her allegations,
the failure to establish a wo
men's building was not due to
lack of effort on the part of this
year's COP.
In particular, Charlotte Ger
mane actively pressured the ad
ministration last spring for the
creation of a women's building,
and when this demand was
turned down, she helped the
Women's Center (at our request)

to relocate to the Bridge. Al
though this location is less cent
ral than our previous office in
the Women's Clubhouse, it is
easier to find and is at least
twice as large.
As for Glenn's comments on
the Women's Day Fair, there are
several points of clarification
needed. First, both Charlotte
Germane and Dave Galligan
were active in helping to organize
last year's event, indicating their
commitment to feminism and
women's issues.
Second, the fair has always

been initiated and organized by
interested students through the
Women's Center and has never
been a responsibility of the COP.
Finally, the Women's Center
made a conscious decision not to
hold a fair this year for two
reasons: a shortage of students
interested in working with the
center, insufficient to cope with
the enormous work load such an
event entails, and a feeling that
we could best serve the Stanford
community through ongoing
projects, rather than a flashy
one-shot event.
In line with this view, we have
started a feminist library, have
coordinated both women's and
coed CR groups all year, and
will be offering numerous work
shops for women (beginning
April 26) in such areas as
gynecological self-help,
feminist politics and theory,
personal growth, arts and crafts,
etc.
In general, the Women's
Center is quite satisfied with the
support we have received from
this year's COP. If we are to be
more active than we have been
this year, it will be due to in
creased support from students
and administrators.
