## When the quake hits... 
### J. Kelly Button 
STANFORD - At least 150 students were killed and
500 injured in the catastrophic earthquake that
struck the Stanford campus yesterday, April 18 -
70 years to the day after the disasterous 1906
tremor. Damage was extensive but school officials
hope to reopen classes in the fall.. ..
Will we be reading that story next week? Next year? Or
never?
Living, studying and building in an earthquake-prone
area naturally leads to speculation about the effects of an
earthquake on Stanford. Unfortunately, it is just that —
speculation — because of the uncertainty of earthquake
and earthquake damage prediction.
One thing that is predictable is that a major quake will hit
Stanford — eventually. According to Asst. Geophysics
Prof. David Boore, however, there is "not a great chance'
that the quake will be in the near future.

Boore said that the San Andreas Fault, which passes
within a couple miles of campus, is "essentially locked'' so
that when the quake occurs, the movement and force
released will be massive. Boore foresees a tremor of equal
or greater magnitude than the 06 quake — 8.3 on the
Richter scale. A quake of that size would, in turn, cause
lateral — side-to-side — forces on Stanford buildings of
five- to six-tenths the force of gravity (g). The present
California Building Code is designed to withstand approx
imately one-tenth g with little or no damage.
Another possibility is a quake emanating from the Hay
ward or Calaveras faults on the east side of the Bay. A
quake there would probably exert forces of about two
tenths g on the buildings here. Boore said the chances of a
quake from those faults were "slightly better'' than from the
San Andreas.

although not all. thte buildings had
each tile individually wired down.
Kershner stated that on all the
buildings repaired during his 18
years at Stanford the tiles had
been wired, but no one on campus
knows exactly what buildings ha
ven't been done.
Students who had been up the
fire escape on History corner or on
the roof at Toyon stated that in
neither of those buildings were the
tiles all secured. Kershner con
firmed that possibility, saying that
neither had been worked on re
cently.
Other highlights of possible
damage:
—most newer buildings (post
1955) do not pose serious dan
gers, except for falling objects.
Exceptions, from the Wells report,
are Storke Publications building,
Meyer Library, the post office, and
the bookstore. Kershner claimed
the bookstore was one of the most
stable on campus, built to sway in
one direction as a unit to avoid
undue stress. Wells said he was
"wary of the pre-cast concrete
elements" in all four cases. Shah,
too, stated his unease about such
elements and the means used to
tie them together.
—Hoover Tower, despite student
speculation to the contrary, will
not fall or even be seriously dam
aged.
—Encina Hall would sustain
heavy damage in the east and
south wings since neither have
been renovated.

—Stanford Linear Acceoerator is
not in danger of breaking in half,
despite being built over a branch
of the fault. It is on solid bedrock
unlikely to shift in any quake.
—Escondido Village — both highl
and low-rise. Manzanita trailer
park, Mirielees Apartments and
fraternities would not be seriously
damaged. Low. wood-frame build
ings are highly earthquake
resistant.
It must be remembered, accord
ing to Kershner, that because of
the cost of renovation, priorities
must be set in making Stanford
safe from earthquakes. He stated
that after the Quad renovation
was complete he would "rest
easier about the possibility of
major fatalities and that reduction
of the possibility of fatalities is a
major goal.
Money can be better spent than
trying to make Stanford absolutely
safe from such a rare occurance
as a major quake, both Kershner
and Beth said. Rather, money
should be used to reduce pos
sibilities of major damage and
saved to repair damage when,
and if, it occurs.
For that reason, Stanford drop
ped its earthquake insurance in
1970, as it was getting too expen
sive. Beth said it cost $500,000 for
adequate insurance then and
would be more now. He stated
that there was no justification for
paying that when an insurance
policy might be canceled at any
time.

ARCADES CRUMBLE — A free-standing series of arches crumbled
in the quake, leaving the pile of rubble in the foreground behind
Memorial Church. Most arches were damaged but have been com
pletely rebuilt with reinforced concrete backing the original
sandstone.
STANFORD - At least 150 students were killed and
500 injured in the catastrophic earthquake that
struck the Stanford campus yesterday, April 18 -
70 years to the day after the disasterous 1906
tremor. Damage was extensive but school officials
hope to reopen classes in the fall.. ..
Will we be reading that story next week? Next year? Or
never?
Living, studying and building in an earthquake-prone
area naturally leads to speculation about the effects of an
earthquake on Stanford. Unfortunately, it is just that —
speculation — because of the uncertainty of earthquake
and earthquake damage prediction.
One thing that is predictable is that a major quake will hit
Stanford — eventually. According to Asst. Geophysics
Prof. David Boore, however, there is "not a great chance'
that the quake will be in the near future.

Boore said that the San Andreas Fault, which passes
within a couple miles of campus, is "essentially locked'' so
that when the quake occurs, the movement and force
released will be massive. Boore foresees a tremor of equal
or greater magnitude than the 06 quake — 8.3 on the
Richter scale. A quake of that size would, in turn, cause
lateral — side-to-side — forces on Stanford buildings of
five- to six-tenths the force of gravity (g). The present
California Building Code is designed to withstand approx
imately one-tenth g with little or no damage.
Another possibility is a quake emanating from the Hay
ward or Calaveras faults on the east side of the Bay. A
quake there would probably exert forces of about two
tenths g on the buildings here. Boore said the chances of a
quake from those faults were "slightly better'' than from the
San Andreas.

although not all. thte buildings had
each tile individually wired down.
Kershner stated that on all the
buildings repaired during his 18
years at Stanford the tiles had
been wired, but no one on campus
knows exactly what buildings ha
ven't been done.
Students who had been up the
fire escape on History corner or on
the roof at Toyon stated that in
neither of those buildings were the
tiles all secured. Kershner con
firmed that possibility, saying that
neither had been worked on re
cently.
Other highlights of possible
damage:
—most newer buildings (post
1955) do not pose serious dan
gers, except for falling objects.
Exceptions, from the Wells report,
are Storke Publications building,
Meyer Library, the post office, and
the bookstore. Kershner claimed
the bookstore was one of the most
stable on campus, built to sway in
one direction as a unit to avoid
undue stress. Wells said he was
"wary of the pre-cast concrete
elements" in all four cases. Shah,
too, stated his unease about such
elements and the means used to
tie them together.
—Hoover Tower, despite student
speculation to the contrary, will
not fall or even be seriously dam
aged.
—Encina Hall would sustain
heavy damage in the east and
south wings since neither have
been renovated.

—Stanford Linear Acceoerator is
not in danger of breaking in half,
despite being built over a branch
of the fault. It is on solid bedrock
unlikely to shift in any quake.
—Escondido Village — both highl
and low-rise. Manzanita trailer
park, Mirielees Apartments and
fraternities would not be seriously
damaged. Low. wood-frame build
ings are highly earthquake
resistant.
It must be remembered, accord
ing to Kershner, that because of
the cost of renovation, priorities
must be set in making Stanford
safe from earthquakes. He stated
that after the Quad renovation
was complete he would "rest
easier about the possibility of
major fatalities and that reduction

too, stated his unease about such
elements and the means used to
tie them together.
—Hoover Tower, despite student
speculation to the contrary, will
not fall or even be seriously dam
aged.
—Encina Hall would sustain
heavy damage in the east and
south wings since neither have
been renovated.

—Stanford Linear Acceoerator is
not in danger of breaking in half,
despite being built over a branch
of the fault. It is on solid bedrock
unlikely to shift in any quake.
—Escondido Village — both highl
and low-rise. Manzanita trailer
park, Mirielees Apartments and
fraternities would not be seriously
damaged. Low. wood-frame build
ings are highly earthquake
resistant.
It must be remembered, accord
ing to Kershner, that because of
the cost of renovation, priorities
must be set in making Stanford
safe from earthquakes. He stated
that after the Quad renovation
was complete he would "rest
easier about the possibility of
major fatalities and that reduction
of the possibility of fatalities is a
major goal.
Money can be better spent than
trying to make Stanford absolutely
safe from such a rare occurance
as a major quake, both Kershner
and Beth said. Rather, money
should be used to reduce pos
sibilities of major damage and
saved to repair damage when,
and if, it occurs.
For that reason, Stanford drop
ped its earthquake insurance in
1970, as it was getting too expen
sive. Beth said it cost $500,000 for
adequate insurance then and
would be more now. He stated
that there was no justification for
paying that when an insurance
policy might be canceled at any
time.

ARCADES CRUMBLE — A free-standing series of arches crumbled
in the quake, leaving the pile of rubble in the foreground behind
Memorial Church. Most arches were damaged but have been com
pletely rebuilt with reinforced concrete backing the original
sandstone.
