## When the quake hits...

STANFORD - At least 150 students were killed and
500 injured in the catastrophic earthquake that
struck the Stanford campus yesterday, April 18 -
70 years to the day after the disasterous 1906
tremor. Damage was extensive but school officials
hope to reopen classes in the fall.. ..
Will we be reading that story next week? Next year? Or
never?
Living, studying and building in an earthquake-prone
area naturally leads to speculation about the effects of an
earthquake on Stanford. Unfortunately, it is just that —
speculation — because of the uncertainty of earthquake
and earthquake damage prediction.
One thing that is predictable is that a major quake will hit
Stanford — eventually. According to Asst. Geophysics
Prof. David Boore, however, there is "not a great chance'
that the quake will be in the near future.

Boore said that the San Andreas Fault, which passes
within a couple miles of campus, is "essentially locked'' so
that when the quake occurs, the movement and force
released will be massive. Boore foresees a tremor of equal
or greater magnitude than the 06 quake — 8.3 on the
Richter scale. A quake of that size would, in turn, cause
lateral — side-to-side — forces on Stanford buildings of
five- to six-tenths the force of gravity (g). The present
California Building Code is designed to withstand approx
imately one-tenth g with little or no damage.
Another possibility is a quake emanating from the Hay
ward or Calaveras faults on the east side of the Bay. A
quake there would probably exert forces of about two
tenths g on the buildings here. Boore said the chances of a
quake from those faults were "slightly better'' than from the
San Andreas.
