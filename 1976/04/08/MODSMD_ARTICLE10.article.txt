### Kathryn Ma 
"Growth for growth's sake" is
no longer a viable political
framework within which to discuss
domestic and international issues,
Republican U.S. Senate candi
date Robert Finch told a group of
students gathered in Branner
lounge yesterday.
The former California Lieuten
ant Governor and Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare
(HEW) was invited to campus by
the Stanford chapter of California
College Republicans.
Finch pointed out the tough
competition he faces in a field
crowded by nine Democrats and
eight Republicans, but expressed
confidence that his local support
will help carry him to victory.
"A win is a hairbreadth away,"
he claimed, noting that "we're
farther ahead in the Bay Area than
statewide." His confidence stems
partly from the fact that he feels
Californian voters have a poor
opinion of his incumbent oppo
nent, Sen. John Tunney.
Tunney called 'lightweight'
"Tunney's a lightweight,''
shrugged Finch. "He has no
cohesive political philosophy. The
people don't feel he has any
views," he said, because of his
"windshield-wiper'' attitude.
Finch's opening remarks dealt
with his general philosophy of re
examining the context of public
policy and the contemporary
decision-making process.
The institutional stress of the
1960s and '70s flows out of the
fact that we went through a go-go
decade.' explained Finch. "The
basic assumption was that we
would be a growth society."
Viewpoints altered
"There has been a tremendous
altering of viewpoint and value
structures," he continued. "All the
assumptions that we made in the
'60s have been questioned, and
many justifiably so.
The challenge a U.S. Senator
musl face is in determining "how

we can make institutions more re
sponsive to individual citizens,"
said Finch.
He then fielded questions from
the audience.
The issue of Proposition 15 was
quickly brought up. As an oppo
nent of the nuclear safety initia
tive, Finch first cited his experi
ence as Chairman of the Radia
tion Council on the Nixon cabinet.
He contended that nuclear energy
must be kept "as an alternate
source (of energy)," adding that
"the proposed method (of nuclear
energy regulation under Proposi
tion 15) is ludicrous."
He pointed out that California
has no coal, is depleting its
sources of natural gas, and that
offshore drilling and strip-mining
are ecologically damaging.
Strip-mining bil
However he later commented
that he would have voted to sus
tain President Ford's veto of the
strip-mining bill put before Con
gress, as it was "unrealistic to im
plement."
Views on welfare
As former Secretary of HEW,
Finch has definite views on the
welfare system.
He stated that he felt "the na
tional government should put
block sums of aid in the hands of
the state." and that "the control of
health care should be left to the
states."
When questioned on his foreign
policy views, Finch stated that the
U.S. "ought to be aiding all under
developed countries with respect
to technical systems, so that they
can become more self-sufficient.''
"Would you vote for giving U.S.
aid to a country like Rhodesia or
South Africa that is anti
communist but known to be ra
cist?' asked one student.
Finch replied he would not be in
favor of sending in U.S. troops, but
that "we can't pull back the for
tress of America. We must earn
their respect and work with them."

shrugged Finch. "He has no
cohesive political philosophy. The
people don't feel he has any
views," he said, because of his
"windshield-wiper'' attitude.
Finch's opening remarks dealt
with his general philosophy of re
examining the context of public
policy and the contemporary
decision-making process.
The institutional stress of the
1960s and '70s flows out of the
fact that we went through a go-go
decade.' explained Finch. "The
basic assumption was that we
would be a growth society."
Viewpoints altered
"There has been a tremendous
altering of viewpoint and value
structures," he continued. "All the
assumptions that we made in the
'60s have been questioned, and
many justifiably so.
The challenge a U.S. Senator

He contended that nuclear energy
must be kept "as an alternate
source (of energy)," adding that
"the proposed method (of nuclear

However he later commented
that he would have voted to sus

strip-mining bill put before Con

Views on welfare
As former Secretary of HEW,
Finch has definite views on the
welfare system.
He stated that he felt "the na
tional government should put
block sums of aid in the hands of
the state." and that "the control of
health care should be left to the
states."
When questioned on his foreign
policy views, Finch stated that the
U.S. "ought to be aiding all under
developed countries with respect
to technical systems, so that they
can become more self-sufficient.''
"Would you vote for giving U.S.
aid to a country like Rhodesia or
South Africa that is anti
communist but known to be ra
cist?' asked one student.
Finch replied he would not be in
favor of sending in U.S. troops, but
that "we can't pull back the for
tress of America. We must earn
their respect and work with them."

FINCH NOT FLINCHING — Former California Lt. Gov. Bob Finch held
up under questions by Stanford students in Branner lounge yes
terday. Finch is challenging California Sen. John Tunney for his
seat.
"Growth for growth's sake" is
no longer a viable political
framework within which to discuss
domestic and international issues,
Republican U.S. Senate candi
date Robert Finch told a group of
students gathered in Branner
lounge yesterday.
The former California Lieuten
ant Governor and Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare
(HEW) was invited to campus by
the Stanford chapter of California
College Republicans.
Finch pointed out the tough
competition he faces in a field
crowded by nine Democrats and
eight Republicans, but expressed
confidence that his local support
will help carry him to victory.
"A win is a hairbreadth away,"
he claimed, noting that "we're
farther ahead in the Bay Area than
statewide." His confidence stems
partly from the fact that he feels
Californian voters have a poor
opinion of his incumbent oppo
nent, Sen. John Tunney.
Tunney called 'lightweight'
"Tunney's a lightweight,''
shrugged Finch. "He has no
cohesive political philosophy. The
people don't feel he has any

"windshield-wiper'' attitude.
