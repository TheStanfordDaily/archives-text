"There is gripping fear on this campus' because of
tenure pressure, according to Anthropology and Edu
cation Prof. Robert Textor, president of the Stanford
Chapter of the American Association of University
Professors (AAUP).
Speaking in an open meeting on tenure policy
Tuesday evening in Tresidder Union, Textor charac
terized the fear felt by junior faculty as excessive
and warned that the University is "in danger of losing
its traditional generosity of spirit."
Textor made a number of suggestions for a new
tenure policy including the possibility of department
chairmen giving their junior professors an open,
honest, annual briefing," and giving those denied te
nure access to their files.
Arthur Bienenstock. vice provost for faculty affairs,
explained that department chairmen are ordered by
University policy "to offer to review the progress of
junior faculty each year and that his office is actively
reminding department heads of this policy.
Faculty rights
Religious Studies Prof. Robert Brown listed a
series of tenure issues including the right "to clearer

delineation of tenure policy, the right "to know how
serious the University is about the quality of teach
ing" and the nght to know the amount of input from
outside Stanford in a negative decision.
Brown also questioned the "present viability of the
institution of tenure " He urged senior faculty to either
retire early or cut back to half teaching loads to open
up their departments to new personnel and ideas
Bienenstock conceded that alternative forms of te
nure were not being considered, but defended tenure
for its protection of full professors who take unor
thodox views or who make discoveries or do research
threatening to powerful interests
Pressures
Asst. Dean of Undergraduate Studies B
Michael Closson, who also questions the value of
tenure, said that the pressure on junior faculty is to be
"cautious, obedient, non-controversial and unin
volved due to tenure pressure.
The problem, Closson said, lies "in the values of the
institution" and he questioned whether Stanford
should improve the quality of its faculty beyond the
present level with the accompanying increase in fa
culty tension.
