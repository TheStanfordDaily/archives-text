# Kloefkorn slate knocks nerds
## Chappie runs for COP 
### Rick Fearon 
' We advocate militant, sen
selessly violent student advo
cacy," says Jon Barth, a sopho
more with advanced placement.
Barth, Walt Kloefkorn, Roy
Skogstrom and Mamie Hag
mann are Council of Presidents
(COP) candidates, representing
the Hammer & Coffin (H&C) soc
iety which publishes the Chapar
ral.
The H&C slate sees control of
the campus by nerds as the first
problem it must solve. "We
would move to overcome this
stranglehold on campus by the
nerds," says Kloefkorn, titular
head of the slate.
Kloefkorn says he feels the
majority of students are not
nerds, but have merely been
tricked into acting like nerds.

And he says the H&C intends to
offer an "alternate influence" to
combat "this menace."
Nerd badges
In order to identify nerds, the
H&C slate advocates forming an
ASSU Select Committee on
Nerd Identification, composed
entirely of anti-nerds. This com
mittee would pick out the nerds
and make them wear badges
while on campus.
"If you know where this influ
ence is coming from, it won't hurt
you that much," Kloefkorn exp
lains.
Another measure to break the
nerd menace is tenure for
dents, Kloefkorn says. Nerds
would not be given tenure and
consequently, would be forced
off-campus, says Kloefkorn.

projects would be provided by an
ASSU Goon Squad. Barth says
He says this squad would have
responsibility for hammering out
differences — literally.
"If someone gets in the stu
dents way, we'll waste him,
says Barth And he adds that
Kloefkorn and Skogstrom are
"well over six feet tall and don't
mind mixing it up a little."
Barth lists wasting Randy
Philips" as the Goon Squad s
first project
"It's not a personal thing, it's
just necessary," Barth explains
Randy hasn't brought too much
quality music to campus."
He adds, "Anybody could
bring better concerts to campus
than Philips' has."

NERD FIGHTERS — Roy Skogstrom, Marnie Hagmann, Jon Barth and slate head Walt Kloefkorn
are Chaparral' candidates tor the Council ot Presidents race.
Skogstrom advocates the
wonderful idea" of instituting a
campus-wide recycling project.
Our high school ecology club
supported itself in lavish deca
dence for several years on the
revenues of recycling alone," he
says
And Skogstrom says he has a
good fnend at UC Santa Cruz
who is an expert on recycling,
and so Skogstrom bills himself
as a secondary expert."
Hagmann s special project is
to give ice cream and candy to
students at registration, and to
give out toys during finals week,
so that those periods can be fun
weeks for each and every stu
dent, she says.
On a more serious note, last
year's H&C proposal for an
ASSU Massage Parlor is still

alive, says Kloefkorn. "We're
always ready for that," he says.
Girls for the massive opera
tion could be recruited from the
girls volleyball team, explains
Kloefkorn.
The H&C slate has nothing but
scorn for its opponent slates. But
Barth says that it "has little criti
cal to say about the other slates
for none have said anything."
However, Barth says he feels
students should be aware that
Carole Houck, a member of the
Vic Petroff slate, is actually COP
President Lee Rosenbaum in
drag. Rosenbaum is trying to get
around ASSU by-laws prohibit
ing one from serving two terms
as COP president, Barth exp
lains.
And he says that Rosenbaum
also hopes to capitalize on the
gay vote.
