## Food Day 1976 
### 
Dan Caldwell

In 1961 President Kennedy an
nounced two important tasks for
this nation to achieve during the
decade of the 60s to land a
man on the moon and to eradicate
hunger from this nation and the
rest of the world We have obvi
ously succeeded in the first task
and failed in the second.
Of the four billion people of the
world, approximately one half bill
ion are classified as permanently
hungry by the United Nations
Food and Agricultural Organiza
tion Another billion people suffer
from malnutrition Faced with the
enormity of the world food crisis
what can we as individuals and a
nation do to combat hunger Snd
starvation?
We must become better in
formed about the causes, con
sequences and possible solu
tions to national and international
food shortages An information
table will be on White Plaza today.
Food Day. to provide information
for those interested in learning
more about the global food situa
tion.
Faced with the abundance of
this country and the absolute de
privation of many other countries,
you might choose to reassess
your own style of life. You may
wish to analyze your diet, to re
duce your consumption of non
nutritious foods (potato chips,
candy, soft drinks, etc.) or occa
sionally to fast.
One direct way to respond to
the food problem is to donate

money to hunger relief agencies
such as CARE. CROP. OXFAN
or RAINS. A little bit of money
goes a long way.
For instance, $1 will
provide a supplementary high pro
tein diet for a child for two weeks.
Ten dollars will provide a glass of
milk every day for an entire year
for a child. One hundred dollars
will provide 250 pounds of veget
able protein for a family of four for
a year.
Another way to respond to the
food issue is to become a citizen
advocate by watching the prog
ress of food related issues within
the government.
A number of organizations
issue monthly newsletters that
describe political action that can
be taken by individuals.
That there are hungry people in
this country and the rest of the
world is now self evident. But how
can we respond? When C P
Snow was asked whether he
feared a violent revolution of the
hungry poor against the rich in
dustrialized nations, he re
sponded that his real fear was
something quite different: that we
would watch them starve on the
evening news while eating our
dinners.
Neglect of world food shortages
is not benign; it is catastrophic for
those who suffer from malnutrition
and starvation.
