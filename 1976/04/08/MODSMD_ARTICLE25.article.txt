# Do local authors suffer as 'Sequoia' gains
## 
### Ted Gioia 
The Sequoia, the literary
magazine here, is rapidly becom
ing one of the most talked about
publications on campus. Not all of
the talk however, is favorable. Is
the Sequoia becoming, as many
claim, nationally known at the ex
pense of its home turf?
Embarking on its 20th year, the
Sequoia seems to be escaping
the obscunty which often plagues
campus literary publications.
Terry Ames, editor of an East Bay
literary magazine, has said that
the Sequoia consistently pub

lishes the best short stories on the
West Coast.
Also furthering its reputation is
the fact that it is one of the few, if
not the only. West Coast campus
literary magazine being sold in
bookstores in New York and Bos
ton.
It would seem tnat amid this na
tional growth there would be little
criticism of the Sequoia here.
Surprisingly the opposite has
been true; many have charged the
magazine with elitism as it relies
less and less on the work of Stan
ford undergraduates.

In a review of an old issue of
Sequoia. Assoc. English Prof.
Nancy Packer claimed that very
few poems and stories published
were written by undergraduates,
and some were penned by staff
members. This criticism, which is
several years old, is still true now,
if not more so.
"In recent issues about 35 per
cent of the material used was writ
ten by undergraduates," com
ments Sequoia editor Michael
Smith "About 40 percent was
written by graduate students,
while the rest was contributed by

faculty members and outsiders.
"We would print more under
graduate material if we received
more high quality submissions,"
adds Smith. "It seems that any
time an undergraduate here at
Stanford writes a poem or story
which he feels is really good he
wants to save it for the New
Yorker."
"There are hundreds of junkie
undergraduate literary magazines
which print everything which is
submitted," remarks another staff
member. "The result is that no
one, not even the university stu
dents, takes the magazine seri
ously. Here, trying to make a qual
ity publication, we have to go
elsewhere if we are faced with a
lack of quality submissions from
undergraduates."
Recent efforts by both black
and chicano student groups to
publish their own literary
magazines are perhaps another
indication that there is dissatisfac
tio with the Sequoia on campus. A
former Sequoia editor comments
"the quality of these magazines'
material was at best uneven, yet
we always have welcomed com
petition on campus. It usually
serves to improve both publica
tions."
Retrospective issue
Being planned at present by the
Sequoia is a retrospective issue
which would be composed of the
best poetry published by the
magazine during its first 20 years.
"Several poets who are now
quite well known had works pub
lished originally in Sequoia," re
marks Smith. Included in the an

thology will be poems by
Marianne Moore, Thorn Gunn,
Edgar Bowers and Donald Davie.
"The retrospective issue will
serve a dual purpose for us,"
comments Smith. "In addition to
giving us a perspective to view our
past, it will also be an opportunity
for Stanford students, and
larily undergraduates, to see that
first-class poetry has been and is
published in the Sequoia. Hope
fully this will encourage more
submissions."
Tentative plans are being made
for a similar issue which would
look back on the best fiction which
the Sequoia has published during
its first 20 years.
"We considered, at first, cover
ing both poetry and fiction in one
issue," adds Smith, "but we felt
that we could not do justice'to the
large amount of excellent material
that we have in one issue. Also
this past year an anthology of
Stanford short stories was pub
lished. By waiting to publish our
own we felt we would reach a
wider audience, even though the
contents would be completely dif
ferent."
Also scheduled for the future
are several theme issues. Among
the subjects being considered for
theme treatment are children's
poetry, translations and minority
writing.
"Theme issues allow us to
cover a subject more thoroughly"
remarks staff member, Judy
Staschover, "thus giving readers
a chance to appreciate types of
writting to which they might not
have been previously exposed."
