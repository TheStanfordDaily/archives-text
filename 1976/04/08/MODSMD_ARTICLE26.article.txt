# Venetian Room appearance
## Ginger Rogers makes a dynamic return 
### Don Shimamoto 
At the end of the film Follow the
Fleet, Fred Astaire serenades
Ginger Rogers, singing There
may be trouble ahead/ But while
there s moonlight and music And
love and romance/ Let s face the
music and dance."
And so they dance, and soon
after. Astaire asks Rogers to pro
pose marriage to him. which she
does This kind of action typifies
the screwball romantic dance
musicals that Fred and Ginger"
made in the 30s. For these two
stars, no problem was so great
that it couldn't be overcome
through dance.
In their movies, all the rivalry
and revelry of romance was re
vealed through the rat-a-tat-tat of
their taps and through the lyrical
elegance of their ballroom
scenes Astaire and Rogers didn t

kiss — they danced, and consid
ering how things turned out on the
screen, who can blame them?
The point here is that one half of
this most famous of all popular
dance teams recently appeared at
the Fairmont Hotel s lavish and
elegant Venetian Room in San
Francisco. In an hour of concen
trated energy. Ginger Rogers
proved that she is alive and kick
ing and leaping and spinning and
crooning once more. And judging
from the response, audiences are
reacting to her as excitedly and
affectionately as they must have
done 40 years ago.
Nostalgia
Rogers act was played for
maximum nostalgia. She ran
through many of the tunes from
her films, so many in fact that she
often ended up quoting the first
couple of verses instead of going

through the entire song. Her de
livery. though not particularly ex
pressive. was surprisingly power
ful.
The songs themselves were
bright and witty, both in the
melodies and in the lyrics. The
Astaire-Rogers films had the good
fortune of being scored by some of
the top songwriters of the period,
and Rogers capitalized on this in
her act. Included in the show were
tunes by Jerome Kern ("A Fine
Romance"). George and Ira Ger
shwin ( They All Laughed.'' "They
Can t Take That Away From Me")
and Irving Berlin ("Isn't This a
Lovely Day? ', "Let Yourself Go").
Of course the packed house in
the Venetian Room came expect
ing to see Ginger Rogers dance,
and Rogers never showed any re
luctance to please her fans. Again
the Astaire-Rogers flicks were re

lied on. this time to provide the
music for the dance numbers
("the Carioca," "The Continen
tal." "Top Hat, White Tie and
Tails" to name a few).
Elevated leg
In fact, some of the dance steps
were taken directly from the films
(for example, in the "Carioca"
number, Rogers kicked into a
spinning leap over her partner's
elevated leg, a step identical to
one she did with Astaire in "The
Yam in Carefree.
It was through her dancing that
Rogers most clearly won the
crowd over to her side. She
plunged into the numbers
wholeheartedly, eager to give the
crowd their money's worth. Tech
nically, the dances weren't all that
demanding, but Rogers compen
sated by infusing them with her
professionalism and dynamism.
Rogers received competent
support from several sources. Her
four "chorus boys" smiled a lot
and were given chances to show
off their dancing abilities in a few
solo spots. Hal Borne, the rehear
sal pianist for Astaire and Rogers
in their movie-making days, con

ducted the Ernie Hecksher house
orchestra superbly, keeping the
instruments in excellent balance
with Rogers' voice.
Dark comedian
Also appearing was a comedian
Johnny Dark. Dark is an impre
ssionist who is handicapped by an
inability to get the voices quite
right. His material was not bad, but
he undoubtedly suffered from
being forced to play the role of
filler.
Ginger Roger's exuberance
and dancing skill came across
forcefully in this exclusive ap
pearance. Her love for performing
(why else would she be doing this
at this point in her life?) motivated
her to put everything she has into
her act.
Her enthusiasm and spirited
ness are catching, and the audi
ence came to have a good time
just watching her enjoy herself.
The standing ovation she re
ceived in the Venetian Room,
though partly a tribute to a re
membrance of times past, was
well deserved.

the Fairmont Hotel s lavish and
elegant Venetian Room in San
Francisco. In an hour of concen
trated energy. Ginger Rogers
proved that she is alive and kick
ing and leaping and spinning and
crooning once more. And judging
from the response, audiences are
reacting to her as excitedly and
affectionately as they must have
done 40 years ago.
Nostalgia
Rogers act was played for
maximum nostalgia. She ran
through many of the tunes from
her films, so many in fact that she
often ended up quoting the first
couple of verses instead of going

through the entire song. Her de
livery. though not particularly ex
pressive. was surprisingly power
ful.
The songs themselves were
bright and witty, both in the
melodies and in the lyrics. The
Astaire-Rogers films had the good
fortune of being scored by some of
the top songwriters of the period,
and Rogers capitalized on this in
her act. Included in the show were
tunes by Jerome Kern ("A Fine
Romance"). George and Ira Ger
shwin ( They All Laughed.'' "They
Can t Take That Away From Me")
and Irving Berlin ("Isn't This a
Lovely Day? ', "Let Yourself Go").
Of course the packed house in
the Venetian Room came expect
ing to see Ginger Rogers dance,
and Rogers never showed any re
luctance to please her fans. Again
the Astaire-Rogers flicks were re

lied on. this time to provide the
music for the dance numbers
("the Carioca," "The Continen
tal." "Top Hat, White Tie and
Tails" to name a few).
Elevated leg
In fact, some of the dance steps
were taken directly from the films
(for example, in the "Carioca"
number, Rogers kicked into a
spinning leap over her partner's
elevated leg, a step identical to
one she did with Astaire in "The
Yam in Carefree.
It was through her dancing that
Rogers most clearly won the
crowd over to her side. She
plunged into the numbers
wholeheartedly, eager to give the
crowd their money's worth. Tech
nically, the dances weren't all that
demanding, but Rogers compen
sated by infusing them with her
professionalism and dynamism.
Rogers received competent
support from several sources. Her
four "chorus boys" smiled a lot
and were given chances to show
off their dancing abilities in a few
solo spots. Hal Borne, the rehear
sal pianist for Astaire and Rogers
in their movie-making days, con

ducted the Ernie Hecksher house
orchestra superbly, keeping the
instruments in excellent balance
with Rogers' voice.
Dark comedian
Also appearing was a comedian
Johnny Dark. Dark is an impre
ssionist who is handicapped by an
inability to get the voices quite
right. His material was not bad, but
he undoubtedly suffered from
being forced to play the role of
filler.
Ginger Roger's exuberance
and dancing skill came across
forcefully in this exclusive ap
pearance. Her love for performing
(why else would she be doing this
at this point in her life?) motivated
her to put everything she has into
her act.
Her enthusiasm and spirited
ness are catching, and the audi
ence came to have a good time
just watching her enjoy herself.
The standing ovation she re
ceived in the Venetian Room,
though partly a tribute to a re
membrance of times past, was
well deserved.
At the end of the film Follow the
Fleet, Fred Astaire serenades
Ginger Rogers, singing There
may be trouble ahead/ But while
there s moonlight and music And
love and romance/ Let s face the
music and dance."
And so they dance, and soon
after. Astaire asks Rogers to pro
pose marriage to him. which she
does This kind of action typifies
the screwball romantic dance
musicals that Fred and Ginger"
made in the 30s. For these two
stars, no problem was so great
that it couldn't be overcome
through dance.
In their movies, all the rivalry
and revelry of romance was re
vealed through the rat-a-tat-tat of
their taps and through the lyrical
elegance of their ballroom
scenes Astaire and Rogers didn t

kiss — they danced, and consid
ering how things turned out on the
screen, who can blame them?
The point here is that one half of
this most famous of all popular
dance teams recently appeared at
the Fairmont Hotel s lavish and
elegant Venetian Room in San
Francisco. In an hour of concen
trated energy. Ginger Rogers
proved that she is alive and kick
