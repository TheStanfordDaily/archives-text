# Good news, bad news
## Ritchie's flick falls short 
### Howard Baldwin 
The Bad News Bears is a divert
ing little comedy full of sure-fire
anachronisms like foul-mouthed
adult children and foul-mouthed
childish adults. Walter Matthau
plays Morris Buttermaker, an al
coholic ex-minor league baseball
player whose one claim to fame is
having struck out Ted Williams in
batting practice.
He now makes his living clean
ing pools. He is paid by an over
zealous father to coach a Little
League team of misfits, much to
the chagrin of the other coaches,
one of whom is Joe Turner (Vic
Morrow).
The Bad News Bears fails for
two reasons. Its focus is diffuse
and indiscernible, and its director
is Michael Ritchie. Anyone who

has seen Ritchie's The Candidate
or Smile knows that he is one of
the most talented young directors
today. He seems to have a sixth
sense about satire and what is
wrong with America.
Ritchie's Smile — the story of a
teen-age beauty pageant — was
metaphoric like Shampoo and
Nashville but a far, far superior
film. Had it been released first in
stead of last, it might have gotten
the recognition it deserved.
Trying to surpass the excel
lence of Smile for Ritchie, there
fore, is somewhat like David O.
Selznick trying to surpass Gone
With The Wind. And it shows.
Competition
Ritchie once again returns to
the territory of competition, again
involving himself in a national

pasttime whose time has come
and gone. The material is ready
for Ritchie's deft touch, but one
senses restraint in every scene. If
he had been more daring, he
could have broken loose into bril
liance.
It is as if the critical and financial
destruction Ritchie received for
Smile made him compromise his
artistic ability. Therein lies the piti
ful failure of The Bad News Bears
— in restraining his bitter satire at
which he has proven himself so
perfect, Ritchie has produced a
bland shadow of something that
could have been great.
Screenplay
Secondarily, one wonders just
what The Bad News Bears is a
bout. Bill (son of Burt) Lancaster's
screenplay treats us to a cast of
interesting characters, some of
whom were never introduced but
nevertheless seem to have some
connection with the team.
The importance of each scene
decreases as the story bounces
around mercilessly, without any
real direction. One is never sure
whether it is the story of Butter
maker's relationship with female
ace pitcher Amanda Whurlizer
(Tatum O Neal); his relationship

with the team; of Amanda's rela
tionship to the team: of Amanda s
relationship to stud and j.d. Kelly
Leak (Jackie Earle Haley); of Kel
ly's relationship to the team.
Bothersome
Most of the characters are far
from fully developed. The clumsy
team manages to rise to the
league playoffs without ever
seeming to increase its skill.
Slight lapses of logic and
explanatory sequences begin to

be bothersome.
Sometimes panoramic diffuse
ness is acceptable. But from
Michael Ritchie, this is not ac
ceptable. He is too good a direc
tor.

HANDSOME DISAPPOINTMENT—MichaeI Ritchie was not up to par
in his latest effort, The Bad News Bears Ritchie's past screen cre
dits include The Candidate and Smile.
The Bad News Bears is a divert
ing little comedy full of sure-fire
anachronisms like foul-mouthed
adult children and foul-mouthed
childish adults. Walter Matthau
plays Morris Buttermaker, an al
coholic ex-minor league baseball
player whose one claim to fame is
having struck out Ted Williams in
batting practice.
He now makes his living clean
ing pools. He is paid by an over
zealous father to coach a Little
League team of misfits, much to
the chagrin of the other coaches,
one of whom is Joe Turner (Vic
Morrow).
The Bad News Bears fails for
two reasons. Its focus is diffuse
and indiscernible, and its director
is Michael Ritchie. Anyone who

has seen Ritchie's The Candidate
or Smile knows that he is one of
the most talented young directors
today. He seems to have a sixth
sense about satire and what is
wrong with America.
Ritchie's Smile — the story of a
teen-age beauty pageant — was
metaphoric like Shampoo and
Nashville but a far, far superior
film. Had it been released first in
stead of last, it might have gotten
the recognition it deserved.
Trying to surpass the excel
lence of Smile for Ritchie, there
fore, is somewhat like David O.
Selznick trying to surpass Gone
With The Wind. And it shows.
Competition
Ritchie once again returns to
the territory of competition, again
involving himself in a national

pasttime whose time has come
and gone. The material is ready
for Ritchie's deft touch, but one
senses restraint in every scene. If
he had been more daring, he
could have broken loose into bril
liance.
It is as if the critical and financial
destruction Ritchie received for
Smile made him compromise his
artistic ability. Therein lies the piti
ful failure of The Bad News Bears
— in restraining his bitter satire at
which he has proven himself so
perfect, Ritchie has produced a
bland shadow of something that
could have been great.
Screenplay
Secondarily, one wonders just
what The Bad News Bears is a
bout. Bill (son of Burt) Lancaster's
screenplay treats us to a cast of
interesting characters, some of
whom were never introduced but
nevertheless seem to have some
connection with the team.
The importance of each scene
decreases as the story bounces
around mercilessly, without any
real direction. One is never sure
whether it is the story of Butter
maker's relationship with female
ace pitcher Amanda Whurlizer
(Tatum O Neal); his relationship

with the team; of Amanda's rela
tionship to the team: of Amanda s
relationship to stud and j.d. Kelly
Leak (Jackie Earle Haley); of Kel
ly's relationship to the team.
Bothersome
Most of the characters are far
from fully developed. The clumsy
team manages to rise to the
league playoffs without ever
seeming to increase its skill.
Slight lapses of logic and
explanatory sequences begin to

be bothersome.
Sometimes panoramic diffuse
ness is acceptable. But from
Michael Ritchie, this is not ac
ceptable. He is too good a direc
tor.
