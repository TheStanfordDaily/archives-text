# Some older buildings might collapse in quake

When the quake finally comes,
what kind of damage to University
buildings is expected 7 Gene Ker
shner of the Planning Office said
that Stanford will fare no worse
than anywhere else." But what
exactly does that mean?
Again, there is a problem with
predicting earthquake effects.
Prediction is an art, not a sci
ence, said Civil Engineering Prof.
Haresh Shah. A lot of assump
tions have to be made and actual

predictions can be wildly diver
gent. Everyone agrees, though,
that there will be extensive dam
age in a major (8.0-8.5 Richter)
quake.
In 1965, Civil Engineering Prof.
James Wells conducted a
University-wide survey on the
possible monetary damages from
a 1906-type quake. Meant to in
vestigate the adequacy of the
University's earthquake insur
ance, the report predicted a 10
percent loss in strictly monetary

terms. That figure masks differ
ences in possible damage among
the buildings, however, and is
somewhat deceptive in terms of
physical damage. Also, according
to Shah, Wells' figures could be off
by "a factor of three,'' meaning 10
percent could just as easily be 30
percent.
Still, the Wells report is useful,
according to Kershner, in prioritiz
ing reconstruction of older build
ings. Thus, those buildings clas
sified as sustaining 20 to 40 per

cent possible damage are higher
on repair lists than those listed at
five to 10 percent.
Another, later, Wells report
(1969), although less extensive,
also lists high-risk buildings.
Seven structures were mentioned
in that report, only one of which
has since been renovated.
History problem
The Wells report and Shah both
focused attention on the older
buildings on campus as the most
dangerous, especially as causes
of possible fatalities. Three cor
ners of the outer Quad seriously
damaged in the 1906 quake —
History, Engineering and Geology
— were major concerns.
(The fourth corner, Math, has
been extensively rebuilt, with what
Kershner terms a "new building
inside the old skin" and does not
pose a major threat.)
Those three stand a "serious
chance of collapse," said Shah.
History corner has been vacated
for renovation similar to that done
in Math corner. Future plans are
for work on the other two, also, but
no timetable has been set. Wells
lists all three as subject to 20 per
cent damage, with Math at 10 per
cent.
Another major headache is the
Chemistry building. Shah again
stated there would be danger of
collapse and Wells' 1969 report
listed it as first priority. No plans
are forthcoming for renovation,
but the new Seely G. Mudd build
ing is supposed to take some of
the load off the older building and
allow the closing of the third floor.
According to Kershner, classes

may still be held in the old Chemis
try building, however.
Furthermore, several of the en
gineering buildings on the south
side of the Quad are considered
very dangerous. Shah pointed to
the building around him, 610, and
smiled. "This will be one of the first
to go," he said.
inner Quad safe
The inner Quad is in much less
danger, since most of the build
ings are lower and already rein
forced. Wells forsaw eight to 10
percent damage to most of those
buildings and archways — one
major casualty in the 1906 quake
and since greatly strengthened.
The one exception was the arcade
in front of Memorial Church, listed
at 40 percent. Kershner said fu
ture plans are to reinforce that ar
cade.
Wells and Shah disagreed
somewhat over the safety of the
older dorms on campus. Shah
said that he believed dorms such
as Toyon, Branner, Roble and
Lagunita would be in danger of
collapse. This, he said, was one of
the greatest life-endagering prob
lems on campus. Wells listed all
four at 10 percent, but Shah said
that even 10 percent damage
would pose serious possibilities of
major fatalities. Kershner's opin
ion was that all the dorms, includ
ing the four oldest, were of high
structural integrity and had little
chance of collapse or fatalities.
Shah stated that besides the
problem in the four dorms, the
major threat of fatalities in an ear
thquake came from falling objects.
He said that the adage in civil en
gineering circles is "never walk
near a building at Stanford."
In his mind, the greatest threats
were the tile roofs and "non-load
carrying" architectural pieces
used for aesthetic value. The lat
ter include concrete overhangs at
the Mitchell building and the
glass-and-concrete walls at
Meyer Library.
Director of Risk Management
Robert Beth stated that he thought
Stanford had done a "pretty good
job" in getting rid of ornamental
pieces subject to falling. He said
he could not, however, refute the
two specific claims by Shah with
out further information.
Tile roofs
As to the tile roofs, Kershner
and Beth both stated that many,

TOTAL LOSS — The new gymnasium, nearing completion in 1906 was damaged beyond repair and
was later razed. Numerous major quakes have struck the Stanford area since the first recorded one in
1828 There has not been one in over 50 years, however, leading many to believe that this incredible
streak of luck cannot hold for much longer. If a new quake strikes, many outer Quad buddings may look
like the new gym shown here.

major casualty in the 1906 quake
and since greatly strengthened.
The one exception was the arcade
in front of Memorial Church, listed
at 40 percent. Kershner said fu
ture plans are to reinforce that ar
cade.
Wells and Shah disagreed
somewhat over the safety of the
older dorms on campus. Shah
said that he believed dorms such
as Toyon, Branner, Roble and
Lagunita would be in danger of
collapse. This, he said, was one of
the greatest life-endagering prob
lems on campus. Wells listed all
four at 10 percent, but Shah said
that even 10 percent damage
would pose serious possibilities of
major fatalities. Kershner's opin
ion was that all the dorms, includ
ing the four oldest, were of high
structural integrity and had little
chance of collapse or fatalities.
Shah stated that besides the
problem in the four dorms, the
major threat of fatalities in an ear
thquake came from falling objects.
He said that the adage in civil en
gineering circles is "never walk
near a building at Stanford."
In his mind, the greatest threats
were the tile roofs and "non-load
carrying" architectural pieces
used for aesthetic value. The lat
ter include concrete overhangs at
the Mitchell building and the
glass-and-concrete walls at
Meyer Library.
Director of Risk Management
Robert Beth stated that he thought
Stanford had done a "pretty good
job" in getting rid of ornamental
pieces subject to falling. He said
he could not, however, refute the
two specific claims by Shah with
out further information.

TOTAL LOSS — The new gymnasium, nearing completion in 1906 was damaged beyond repair and
was later razed. Numerous major quakes have struck the Stanford area since the first recorded one in
1828 There has not been one in over 50 years, however, leading many to believe that this incredible
streak of luck cannot hold for much longer. If a new quake strikes, many outer Quad buddings may look
like the new gym shown here.
(Continued from front page)

When the quake finally comes,
what kind of damage to University
buildings is expected 7 Gene Ker
shner of the Planning Office said
that Stanford will fare no worse
than anywhere else." But what
exactly does that mean?
Again, there is a problem with
predicting earthquake effects.
Prediction is an art, not a sci
ence, said Civil Engineering Prof.
Haresh Shah. A lot of assump
tions have to be made and actual

predictions can be wildly diver
gent. Everyone agrees, though,
that there will be extensive dam
age in a major (8.0-8.5 Richter)
quake.
In 1965, Civil Engineering Prof.
James Wells conducted a
University-wide survey on the
possible monetary damages from
a 1906-type quake. Meant to in
vestigate the adequacy of the
University's earthquake insur
ance, the report predicted a 10
percent loss in strictly monetary

terms. That figure masks differ
ences in possible damage among
the buildings, however, and is
somewhat deceptive in terms of
physical damage. Also, according
to Shah, Wells' figures could be off
by "a factor of three,'' meaning 10
percent could just as easily be 30
percent.
Still, the Wells report is useful,
according to Kershner, in prioritiz
ing reconstruction of older build
ings. Thus, those buildings clas
sified as sustaining 20 to 40 per

cent possible damage are higher
on repair lists than those listed at
five to 10 percent.
Another, later, Wells report
(1969), although less extensive,
also lists high-risk buildings.
Seven structures were mentioned
in that report, only one of which
has since been renovated.
History problem
The Wells report and Shah both
focused attention on the older
buildings on campus as the most
dangerous, especially as causes
of possible fatalities. Three cor
ners of the outer Quad seriously
damaged in the 1906 quake —
History, Engineering and Geology
— were major concerns.
(The fourth corner, Math, has
been extensively rebuilt, with what
Kershner terms a "new building
inside the old skin" and does not
pose a major threat.)
Those three stand a "serious
chance of collapse," said Shah.
History corner has been vacated
for renovation similar to that done
in Math corner. Future plans are
for work on the other two, also, but
no timetable has been set. Wells
lists all three as subject to 20 per
cent damage, with Math at 10 per
cent.
Another major headache is the
Chemistry building. Shah again
stated there would be danger of
collapse and Wells' 1969 report
listed it as first priority. No plans
are forthcoming for renovation,
but the new Seely G. Mudd build
ing is supposed to take some of
the load off the older building and
allow the closing of the third floor.
According to Kershner, classes

may still be held in the old Chemis
try building, however.
Furthermore, several of the en
gineering buildings on the south
side of the Quad are considered
very dangerous. Shah pointed to
the building around him, 610, and
smiled. "This will be one of the first
to go," he said.
inner Quad safe
The inner Quad is in much less
danger, since most of the build
ings are lower and already rein
forced. Wells forsaw eight to 10
percent damage to most of those
buildings and archways — one
major casualty in the 1906 quake
and since greatly strengthened.
The one exception was the arcade
in front of Memorial Church, listed
at 40 percent. Kershner said fu

ings. Thus, those buildings clas
sified as sustaining 20 to 40 per

cent possible damage are higher
on repair lists than those listed at
five to 10 percent.
Another, later, Wells report
(1969), although less extensive,
also lists high-risk buildings.
Seven structures were mentioned
in that report, only one of which
has since been renovated.
History problem
The Wells report and Shah both
focused attention on the older
buildings on campus as the most
dangerous, especially as causes
of possible fatalities. Three cor
ners of the outer Quad seriously
damaged in the 1906 quake —
History, Engineering and Geology
— were major concerns.
(The fourth corner, Math, has
been extensively rebuilt, with what
Kershner terms a "new building
inside the old skin" and does not
pose a major threat.)
Those three stand a "serious
chance of collapse," said Shah.
History corner has been vacated
for renovation similar to that done
in Math corner. Future plans are
for work on the other two, also, but
no timetable has been set. Wells
lists all three as subject to 20 per
cent damage, with Math at 10 per
cent.
Another major headache is the
Chemistry building. Shah again
stated there would be danger of
collapse and Wells' 1969 report
listed it as first priority. No plans
are forthcoming for renovation,
but the new Seely G. Mudd build
ing is supposed to take some of
the load off the older building and
allow the closing of the third floor.
According to Kershner, classes

may still be held in the old Chemis
try building, however.
Furthermore, several of the en
gineering buildings on the south
side of the Quad are considered
very dangerous. Shah pointed to
the building around him, 610, and
smiled. "This will be one of the first
to go," he said.
inner Quad safe
The inner Quad is in much less
danger, since most of the build
ings are lower and already rein
forced. Wells forsaw eight to 10
percent damage to most of those
buildings and archways — one
major casualty in the 1906 quake
and since greatly strengthened.
The one exception was the arcade
in front of Memorial Church, listed
at 40 percent. Kershner said fu
ture plans are to reinforce that ar
cade.
Wells and Shah disagreed
somewhat over the safety of the
older dorms on campus. Shah
said that he believed dorms such
as Toyon, Branner, Roble and
Lagunita would be in danger of
collapse. This, he said, was one of
the greatest life-endagering prob
lems on campus. Wells listed all
four at 10 percent, but Shah said
that even 10 percent damage
would pose serious possibilities of
major fatalities. Kershner's opin
ion was that all the dorms, includ
ing the four oldest, were of high
structural integrity and had little
chance of collapse or fatalities.
Shah stated that besides the
problem in the four dorms, the
major threat of fatalities in an ear
thquake came from falling objects.
He said that the adage in civil en
gineering circles is "never walk
near a building at Stanford."
In his mind, the greatest threats
were the tile roofs and "non-load
carrying" architectural pieces
used for aesthetic value. The lat
ter include concrete overhangs at
the Mitchell building and the
glass-and-concrete walls at
Meyer Library.
Director of Risk Management
Robert Beth stated that he thought
Stanford had done a "pretty good
job" in getting rid of ornamental
pieces subject to falling. He said
he could not, however, refute the
two specific claims by Shah with
out further information.
Tile roofs
As to the tile roofs, Kershner
and Beth both stated that many,

TOTAL LOSS — The new gymnasium, nearing completion in 1906 was damaged beyond repair and
was later razed. Numerous major quakes have struck the Stanford area since the first recorded one in
1828 There has not been one in over 50 years, however, leading many to believe that this incredible
streak of luck cannot hold for much longer. If a new quake strikes, many outer Quad buddings may look
like the new gym shown here.

When the quake finally comes,
what kind of damage to University
buildings is expected 7 Gene Ker
shner of the Planning Office said
that Stanford will fare no worse
than anywhere else." But what
exactly does that mean?
Again, there is a problem with
predicting earthquake effects.
Prediction is an art, not a sci
ence, said Civil Engineering Prof.
Haresh Shah. A lot of assump
tions have to be made and actual

predictions can be wildly diver
gent. Everyone agrees, though,
that there will be extensive dam
age in a major (8.0-8.5 Richter)
quake.
In 1965, Civil Engineering Prof.
James Wells conducted a
University-wide survey on the
possible monetary damages from
a 1906-type quake. Meant to in
vestigate the adequacy of the
University's earthquake insur
ance, the report predicted a 10
percent loss in strictly monetary

terms. That figure masks differ
ences in possible damage among
the buildings, however, and is
somewhat deceptive in terms of
physical damage. Also, according
to Shah, Wells' figures could be off
by "a factor of three,'' meaning 10
percent could just as easily be 30
percent.
Still, the Wells report is useful,
according to Kershner, in prioritiz
ing reconstruction of older build
ings. Thus, those buildings clas
sified as sustaining 20 to 40 per

cent possible damage are higher
on repair lists than those listed at
