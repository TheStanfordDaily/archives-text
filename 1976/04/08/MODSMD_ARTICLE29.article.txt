# Many parts of campus inaccessible to physically handicapped students
## 
### Becky Trounson 
A study by three engineering
students has shown that many
parts of the campus are inacces
sible to the physically handicap
ped.
The project conducted by
Theresa Rhyne, Charles
Lockwood and Paisal Shusang,
was a senior report for Civil En
gineering 197 — Engineering
Synthesis. In the past, students of
this class have studied topics
such as the parking problem here,
but these three students decided
to "try to make people at Stanford
aware of the problems of the phys
ically handicapped."*
"For example, an able-bodied
person doesn't think that a curb or
a step might be an insurmounta
ble barrier to a person in a wheel
chair or of the problem a blind per
son must go through in order to
register," said Rhyne.
"Our major objective was to
open some eyes — if nothing else,
we wanted to make people at
Stanford aware of the problem.
Then, maybe we can hope for
some solutions," she said. "If you
look around," Shusang added,
"you see how much there is to
improve in this area."

In the 50-page report submitted
by the students, they list many
buildings at Stanford which are
either totally or partially inacces
sible to the disabled. For example,
several buildings in the Quad are
inaccessible because they have
steps at their entrances which
block wheelchair users. These
buildings include the Classics,
Comparative Literature and
Human Biology Departments, as
well as Memorial Church.
In the inner Quad, none of the
buildings have accessible second
floors. "This means that any clas
ses scheduled in those rooms
would have to be rescheduled for
a disabled person to take them,"
Rhyne said.
In the outer Quad, only the
Psychology and Math Depart
ments have elevators. However,
even in these buildings, the doors
at the entrances are heavy and
cumbersome for individuals in
wheelchairs, the report states.
There are also very few Univer

sity residences which are acces
sible to the disabled. The Stern
and Wilbur Houses are among the
few which are accessible, and
even then it is only the first floors
of these buildings which can be
reached by the disabled.
"It's really a question of being
aware of the problems of the hand
icapped students during the con
struction of campus buildings,"
Rhyne said.
BuHdings just recently com
pleted. like the bottom level of the
Florence Moore Houses have
bathrooms, drinking fountains,
and dormitory rooms which take
the needs of handicapped stu
dents into consideration.
Buildings now under construc
tion, like the three new row
houses, and those which will soon
begin construction, like the new
Hoover building, will also be ac
cessible to handicapped students,
the report states.

Gto JUMBLE — The 1906 earthquake severely damaged Geology corner on the outer Quad,
especially the second floor. Despite its reconstruction after the quake, it remains one of the more
dangerous buidings on campus. Future plans call for its complete renovation, but no timetable has
been set.
