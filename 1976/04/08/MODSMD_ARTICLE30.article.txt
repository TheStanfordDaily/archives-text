Sources: Harris quitting
WASHINGTON — Sources here said
yesterday former Oklahoma Sen. Fred Har
ris, whose campaign has been dogged by a
lack of funds, has decided to end active
campaigning, though he will still try to get
the nomination at the national convention.
Harns got only one percent of the vote in
Wisconsin's primary Tuesday.
Jimmy Carter won that presidential pre
ference vote with 37 percent of the ballots,
edging out Morris Udall, who held a prema
ture victory celebration election night.
Early yesterday, late-counted ballots
turned things around.
Meanwhile. Carter, Udall and Henry
Jackson plunged without pause yesterday
into the campaign for Pennsylvania s presi
dential primary, a contest that could be their
Democratic showdown
There are other candidates waiting to test
them later, and there is Minnesota Sen.
Hubert Humphrey, biding his time and look
ing for running room after the primaries are
over.
But it is evident now that the Pennsyl
vania balloting April 27 will sort things out
among the current crop of primary conten
ders
President Ford is entered in Pennsyl
vania, which will have 103 Republican de
legate votes, but challenger Ronald
Reagan is not running again until the May 1
Texas primary, which now looms as his
make or break test.
Texas Sen. John G. Tower, who heads
the Ford campaign there, said Reagan
would have to score a sweep in that contest
to keep his campaign alive. Tower said he
thinks Ford will win in a close Texas race

Ford threatens aid veto
WASHINGTON — The continuing con
flict between the Ford administration and
Congress over U.S. policy in the Middle
East flared anew yesterday when Ford said
he would veto a foreign aid bill if it contains
extra funds for Israel.
At issue is an additional $550 million for
Israel that the Senate included in a $5.6
billion foreign aid package. The funds for
Israel are part of $772 million that the Se
nate added for the Middle East.
Ford said the extra funds "are not needed
to meet the essential needs of the reci
pients."
In the case of Israel, he said, his fiscal
1976 and 1977 budget requests "provide
sufficient levels of assistance to meet that
nation s needs."
Ford said if he receives from Congress a
bill that includes the additional funds, "I will
be forced to exercise my veto."
An effort is expected in the House to add
the extra funds to the foreign aid bill. Senate
supporters have said they are essential to
support Israel's already strained economy.
S.F. talks continue
SAN FRANCISCO — With effects of the
week-old municipal workers' strike spread
ing. union leaders returned to the bargain-

ing table late yesterday afternoon to hear a
new proposal from the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors.
A leader of a coalition of unions that has
called for a potentially crippling general
strike and several other labor chieftains met
for about half an hour with the city's
negotiator. Then both sides held caucuses,
with strike leaders meeting in one room and
supervisors conferring in another.
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. said that he has
no plans to intervene in the strike, but he
confirmed state contingency plans were
being prepared as a routine matter.
He said the state should get involved in
the strike only as "a last resort in only the
most extreme circumstances. And as yet I
see no indication of that kind of emergency.
Nor have I received any request from the
Board of Supervisors or the mayor."
Meanwhile, San Francisco Mayor
George Moscone yesterday predicted a
gloomy future, a day after the executive
committee of the AFL-CIO San Francisco
Labor Council issued a call for a general
strike.
However, spokesmen for two powerful
unions — the Longshoremen and
Teamsters — said they were not involved in
any efforts now to call a general strike.
Those unions are not in the AFL-CIO

Earthquake hits Iran
BERKELEY — A powerful earthquake hit
southwestern Iran yesterday, the University
of California Seismographic station re
ported.
The quake registered 6.25 on the Richter
scale, strong enough to cause severe dam
age in a populated area.
There was no immediate indication from
Iran of whether the quake hit an inhabited
area.
Nuclear plant may crack
SAN FRANCISCO — A geologist's claim
that an active earthquake fault lies beside
or beneath the Humboldt Bay nuclear
power plant was discussed here yesterday
by state and federal energy officials.
At issue was whether the 12-year-old
nuclear plant should be shut down.
An official of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, one of the agencies at the
meeting, said the purpose of the meeting
was to compare notes from visits to the site.
He said a decision on closing the plant
would be made by the NRC in Washington,
D C., no sooner than two weeks from now.
