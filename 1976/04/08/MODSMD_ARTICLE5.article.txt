						return to politics as usual
## 
### 
Some of us really took heart
back in 1974 when eligible voters
stayed away from the polls in
droves. At last, it appeared, we
were witnessing a genuine revul
sion to the sham and deceit of
modern American politics — traits
which saw their fruition in the
scandals of that year.
Those hopes have proved vain.
The record of the 1976 campaign
thus far has been one of politics as
usual. Not only are voters return
ing to the fold in traditional num
bers, but they are buying the same
old lines.
Political iconoclasts like Mo
Udall and Henry Jackson are
leaders in Democratic balloting.
Gerald Ford buys GOP primary
victories with the gifts of incum
bency. Mayor Daley's machine
mows down Dan Walker for gov
ernor of Illinois.
Indeed, the best 1976 can offer
as the new wave of American poli
tics is a smiling Southerner named
Jimmy Carter, who bubbles over
with sincerity — or so it seems to
all but those who know him well.
And this can hardly be a year for
clearly defined issues, when the
Demo frontrunner is Carter, the
issue-less candidate.
HHH
Lest we worry what would hap
pen if Carter's teeth should yellow,
old-hand Democratic pols have
made it clear that their real favorite
is Hubert Humphrey — the ghost
of presidencies past. Imagine:
Hubert Humphrey against Gerald
Ford in reform year 1976!
Of Ford's nomination we can
have little doubt. The mollifying of
the American public doused the
spark which lit under Ronald
Reagan six months ago.
After all, seven percent un
employment's certainly not as bad
as it was. and double-digit inflation
is gone (at least until next year),
and with good ol Jerry we needn't
fear any changes in that cherished
American institution. Social Sec
urity — oh my God no!
Minus the pulling power of his
economic conservatism, Reagan

has decided to aim for the jugular
with one of the most tired issues of
this quarter century: national de
fense. or who's got what on whom.
Little game
Politics is a pretty base little
game, and simple fear of the milit
ary might of the "enemy" is at
once more comprehensible to the
mass electorate than the complex
danger that continued, rapid in-

creases in the government
monopolized money supply pose
to the medium of exchange so
vital to a free market economy.
So Reagan plays a few old Cold
war tunes, featuring a new beat
courtesy of folk hero Aleksandr
Solzhenitsyn. Democrats con
tinue to see goverment as the cure
for social ills. And union bosses
use the tribute from members to
seek the advantages union bos
ses have always sought.
This is all so very old. There are
a few fresh approaches on the
fringes: the Libertarian Party
members who oppose what gov
ernment does and then want to
run it, the Eugene McCarthy
nomads of the Left who've been
shut out of campaign financing by
the campaign finance "reform"
law, and Jerry Brown.
Jerry Brown. The guru of a new
political age, the naysayer whom
everyone (well, 85 percent) loved.
Now he too has entered the race.
Soon he may send forth an epistle
on the issues.
Declinng chic
Actually, Brown has spoken,
and anyone who reads his April
Playboy interview can only watch
Brown descend from his chic peak
as the chat progresses. Nothing
stands out so much as his ordinar-

Then again, perhaps we owe
Brown a favor for the disillusion
ment. It can only serve as a re
minder of the mediocrity that poli
tics spawns and of the creative
possibilities which lie in enteprises
outside the coercive rat race of
government.
The hope for a bettered world
must assuredly rest with a rejec
tion of the political system and a
return to voluntary dealings bet
ween people here and everwhere.
In that regard, the return to politics
as usual in 1976 portends a long
cold winter ahead.
