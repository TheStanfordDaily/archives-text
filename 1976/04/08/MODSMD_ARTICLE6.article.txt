At this point in time, it appears
as if the choice in the June 8
California Democratic primary will
be between front-runner Jimmy
Carter and our own governor Jerry
Brown.
We urge Stanford Democrats to
play an active role in trying to in
fluence their party's choice for the
next presidential nominee. For
those who are unsatisfied with the
present front-runner, we urge
them to consider Jerry Brown.
He is a strong leader who has
shown fiscal responsibility and
moral vision. A victory for him in
California would, at the very least,
keep the convention open, and it
could lead to a Brown nomination.
For those who want to find out
more we urge them to come to the
district-wide caucus for Jerry
Brown. There, they can find out
how they can participate in the
election process and can vote for
Stanford representation at the
convention in New York.
