## Physicist urges Prop. 15 defeat 
### Marc Strassman 
"It is my guess that we will not
suceed in stopping Proposition
15," Edward Teller, senior Hoover
Institution research fellow, said
during a talk sponsored by Scien
tists for Enlightenment on Nuclear
Sources of Energy (SENSE).
He then presented a detailed
argument explaining why Proposi
tion 15 ought to be defeated to the
crowd of about 300 in Annenberg
Auditorium.
He also criticized three bills
passed by the state assembly and
sent to the Senate Monday that
would prohibit construction of ad
ditional nuclear reactors until
problems of waste disposal and
fuel reprocessing can be solved,
and studies can be conducted on
underground siting of reactors.
"If either of these bills become
law," said Teller, "it would be
equivalent to passage of Proposi
tion 15.
"This set of bills constitutes part
of the drive to shut down nuclear
reactors now," he continued, "a
drive that extends over the United
States, that will not be decided in
California but where the vote on
June Bth will make a very big dif
ference, in one direction or
another."
Nuclear background
Teller pointed out that his own
experience in the field of nuclear
safety goes back to 1948, when
he was what he called, "a mini-
Nader" on a national committee
on nuclear safety that seemed to
some people so strict in its stan
dards that it was referred to as the
"Committee for Reactor Preven
tion."
Saying that the "only really
serious" objection that can be
raised against nuclear reactors is
the danger from nuclear acci
dents, Teller claimed for industrial
reactors "an incredible and un
broken safety record."
Teller referred to the Rasmus
sen Report on Nuclear Safety,
saying he agreed with its conclu
sion that "it is more probable to be
killed by a meteorite than by a nuc
lear reactor accident."
Other objections
Other objections, said Teller,
are "numerous and without sub
stance." He said he would deal
with them anyway because they
may nevertheless influence votes.
Included in this category was
the threat of increased cancer and
genetic damage from radiation
generated by nuclear power
plants.
Teller said that this criticism is in
error both in that it over-estimates

the radioactivity that would be
produced by nuclear power plants
and in that it incorrectly postulates
an increase in cancer and genetic
damage as being directly propor
tional to an increase in radiation.
He also discounted objections
that recycling and storage of nuc
lear wastes are major problems.

"There are several very good
methods to dispose of nuclear
waste products," he said.
Teller mentioned that he is part
of a committee that will be report
ing to President Ford in less than
three weeks on the question of
waste recycling and that the
committee will recommend the
acceleration of the decision
making process in this area.
"Finally," Teller said, "there is
the grave, non-technical problem
of sabotage, the problem of mis
use." He dismissed this problem
by saying, "if even airplanes can
be protected from hijacking, cer
tainly the smaller number of nuc
lear power plants can also be pro
tected."
Teller said he favored efforts "to
find a cheap and effective way to
put nuclear reactors at a safe and
appropriate level underground."

damage as being directly propor
tional to an increase in radiation.
He also discounted objections
that recycling and storage of nuc
lear wastes are major problems.

"There are several very good
methods to dispose of nuclear
waste products," he said.
Teller mentioned that he is part
of a committee that will be report
ing to President Ford in less than
three weeks on the question of
waste recycling and that the
committee will recommend the
acceleration of the decision
making process in this area.
"Finally," Teller said, "there is
the grave, non-technical problem
of sabotage, the problem of mis
use." He dismissed this problem
by saying, "if even airplanes can
be protected from hijacking, cer
tainly the smaller number of nuc
lear power plants can also be pro
tected."
Teller said he favored efforts "to
find a cheap and effective way to
put nuclear reactors at a safe and
appropriate level underground."
"It is my guess that we will not
suceed in stopping Proposition
15," Edward Teller, senior Hoover
Institution research fellow, said
during a talk sponsored by Scien
tists for Enlightenment on Nuclear
Sources of Energy (SENSE).
He then presented a detailed
argument explaining why Proposi
tion 15 ought to be defeated to the
crowd of about 300 in Annenberg
Auditorium.
He also criticized three bills
passed by the state assembly and
sent to the Senate Monday that
would prohibit construction of ad
ditional nuclear reactors until
problems of waste disposal and
fuel reprocessing can be solved,
and studies can be conducted on
underground siting of reactors.
"If either of these bills become
law," said Teller, "it would be
equivalent to passage of Proposi
tion 15.
"This set of bills constitutes part
of the drive to shut down nuclear
reactors now," he continued, "a
drive that extends over the United
States, that will not be decided in
California but where the vote on
June Bth will make a very big dif
ference, in one direction or
another."
Nuclear background
Teller pointed out that his own
experience in the field of nuclear
safety goes back to 1948, when
he was what he called, "a mini-
Nader" on a national committee
on nuclear safety that seemed to
some people so strict in its stan
dards that it was referred to as the
"Committee for Reactor Preven
tion."
Saying that the "only really
serious" objection that can be
raised against nuclear reactors is
the danger from nuclear acci
dents, Teller claimed for industrial
reactors "an incredible and un
broken safety record."
Teller referred to the Rasmus
sen Report on Nuclear Safety,
saying he agreed with its conclu
sion that "it is more probable to be
killed by a meteorite than by a nuc
lear reactor accident."
Other objections
Other objections, said Teller,
are "numerous and without sub
stance." He said he would deal
with them anyway because they
may nevertheless influence votes.
Included in this category was
the threat of increased cancer and
genetic damage from radiation
generated by nuclear power
plants.
Teller said that this criticism is in
error both in that it over-estimates

the radioactivity that would be
produced by nuclear power plants
and in that it incorrectly postulates
an increase in cancer and genetic
damage as being directly propor
tional to an increase in radiation.
