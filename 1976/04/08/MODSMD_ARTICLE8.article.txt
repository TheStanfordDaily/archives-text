# Mao designates Hua premier; shuns Teng

### 
TOKYO (AP) — Mao Tse-tung raised Hua Kuo
feng, unknown outside China two months ago, to the
posts of premier and party first vice chairman yester
day — making clear Hua is his personal choice to be
the next leader of the People's Republic of China. At
the same time, Mao cut down an old foe. Teng
Hsiao-ping.
The 56-year-old Hua, a Mao protege from his own
Hunan Province, steps into the premiership that the
late ChouEn-laihad hoped would go to Teng.
Premier Chou died on Jan. 8, and Hua, then sec
urity chief, was named acting premier in mid-
February. His latest promotions make him, in effect,
No. 2 man in China.
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported that
Peking s Tien An Men Square, where supporters of
Teng demonstrated and battled with militiamen on
Monday, was filled last night with drums, music and
people shouting slogans in celebration of Hua's
promotion.
'Capitalist-roader'
Teng, 72, and under official criticism as a
"capitalist-roader" since Chou's death, was stripped
of powerful positions as first vice premier, vice chair

man of the party and chief of the army general staff.
Brief communiques of the party Politburo, distri
buted by Hsinhua news agency monitored here,
made it plain that the ouster of Teng and the promo
tion of Hua were at the personal instigation of the
82-year-old Mao.
The leadership changes were a victory for the radi
cal forces epitomized by Mao's wife Chiang Ching
over the moderate realist side represented by Chou
and Teng. The radicals believe that class struggle
must continue to dominate life in China while the
moderates favor setting aside such differences to
make economic progress.
Compromises
Whether Hua survives or not may well depend on
how successful he can bring about compromises be
tween these two forces. The key may rest in the hands
of the 2.5 million-man armed forces.
Though the communiques did not say so in so
many words, it was clear that the action — unexpec
tedly swift and dramatic — resulted from the pro-Teng
demonstrations in Tien An Men Square involving up
to 100,000 persons.
