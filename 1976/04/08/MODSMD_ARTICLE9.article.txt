# Vucinich: history's product

Wayne Vucinich leans back in
his wooden chair and holds one of
his smooth, white hands up to the
light. Frowning, he chooses a
finger nail and falls to work on it,
then another, with a silver
penknife.
Sitting across from him as he
meticulously relates his experi
ences during World War 11, I
realize that I have lost control of
the interview.
The aristocratic, white haired
man dictates slowly, consider
ately inserting "new paragraph"
and "comma" when needed. I
have been stripped of my role as
interviewer and eased into that of
a recorder of memoirs.
"Oh, have you been to Rus
sia?" I say, congratulating myself
on slyly pushing my interviewee
on the subject of his extensive
travels. But he is not to be so
lightly distracted.
"Yes," he replies in a slightly
peeved tone. "I am getting to that.
Then, in 1944
I sigh and resignedly return to
my dictation pad. Wayne Vuc
inich, professor of history here, is
conducting an interview.
In his early sixties, he is not an
imposing man in stature, being
around 6-foot tall, but the intelli
gent and often haughty focus of
his hawklike features invest him
with an impressive dignity.
Dark eyes stare out at the world
from behind heavy black specta
cles, and his tanned face is
crowned by a thinning expanse of
white hair.
His movements are unhurried
and careful; stylistic partners of
the words which fall from his
mouth only after deliberate con
sideration.
"I witnessed life under the
democratic Czechoslovak gov
ernment, the death and funeral
procession, no . .. the magnifi
cent funeral procession of T.G.
Masaryk — father of modern
Czechoslovakia and a great

statesman — and daily provoca
tions by German Nazis which ul
timately led to the dreadful events
of September, 1938."
Ah, the mention of Masaryk's
name rekindles my interest. I think
back fondly on my days in Vuc
inich's Eastern European history
class last year.
Experiences in Europe
Vucinich did not seem so for
bidding in the context of a clas
sroom, perhaps because his lec
tures, delivered in an impersonal
monotone, were frequently inter
rupted by anecdotes of his experi

ences in Europe.
His stern face would soften as
he related stories such as the one
about his family's Christmas cus
toms, and for a moment the dis
tant countries portrayed on the
blackboard map assumed a vital
reality for the 20 students who had
put down their pens to listen in
tently.
"He's a real spellbinder," says
his secretary of four years, Elise
Johnson. "People are always so
interested when he talks about the
old country."
With that sentence, Johnson

revealed the secret of Vucinich's
fascination: he is interesting pre
cisely because he has lived such a
diverse, action-filled life.
Although he was born in Butte.
Mont on June 23, 1913, Vucinich
and two younger siblings were
sent to Yugoslavia when their pa
rents and one brother died in 1918
of Spanish flu. They were wel
comed into their extended Euro
pean family (zadruga) where he
remained until 1929. He landed in
New York with borrowed money
on the same day as Herbert
Hoover's presidential inaugura
tion.
Vucinich attended the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley
where he began his career as a
historian and received his
Bachelor's and Master s Degree
from the University of California at
Berkeley before he returned to
Europe in 1937 to study Slavic his
tory and culture at Charles Uni
versity in Prague, Czechos
lovakia. _
In 1941 he received his Ph D
from Berkeley.
As he told me about his
academic experiences, I inter
rupted to ask exactly how many
languages he spoke. Here he de
monstrated his penchant for mak
ing his history seem spontaneous,
as he affected a flippant laugh
"Oh, I've never counted them.
Let me see..he said as he
proceeded to count his linguistic
accomplishments on his fingers.
"Ah, yes, I speak about five and
can read about eight or 10 Put
down eight to sound modest.
Invited to Washington
In 1941 he was invited to
Washington to join the Office of
Strategic Services (OSS).
He belonged to the latter until
1946 From 1943 to 1946 he was a
lieutenant in the U.S. Naval Re
serve. For service in Bulgaria, he
was awarded the Bronze Star
Vucinich began his historical
career here soon after the war as
