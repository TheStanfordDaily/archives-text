# Students to help head SWOPSI
## 
### Arlene Warmack 
A search for two "energetic" under
graduates to codirect two innovative
special undergraduate programs here
next year is underway.
The two students will be paid to
help supervise the Stanford Work
shops on Political and Social Issues
(SWOPSI) and the Student Center for
Innovation in Research and Education
(SCIRE), according to SWOPSI
Codirector Andy Parnes and SCIRE Di
rector Alice Supton.
The new positions will be geared to
"a return to student involvement,"
Parnes said.
Parnes and Supton said they hoped
that information about SWOPSI and
SCIRE can be readily disseminated to
the students by the student codirec
tors. At the same time, the two said
they believe that student ideas and in
novations can be channeled into the
programs.
The concept of student codirectors
centers around the task of making both
SWOPSI and SCIRE more responsive
to Stanford students, Parnes said. Both
programs were student initiated, and
the directors see student involvement
in the day-to-day workings as a reaf
firmation of student input into their
own education, said Supton.
"We are looking for people who are
enthusiastic," Parnes said. There is a
great deal of work involved but the
rewards will be well worth the effort,
he added.
Both Parnes and Supton stated that
the two student codirectors will work
in conjunction with half-time profes
sional directors who will have primary
responsibility for the academic por
tion of SWOPSI and SCIRE.
Both positions will involve 10-
month commitments beginning at the
end of August and continuing until the
end of the school year.
There will be a certain amount of
flexibility in the hours, but the stu
dents will be expected to devote 20
hours per week to their respective
programs. Supton said.
For each position there is a search
committee composed of students, fa
culty members and the Dean of Under
graduate Studies, Parnes and Supton

reported. The search committee will
be responsible for recommending the
two students to the Dean of Under
graduate Studies for confirmation.
According to Parnes, Supton said
the responsibilities of SWOPSI
codirector include:
(1) being chief organizer and coor
dinator of SWOPSI workshops and ac
tivities;
(2) acting as liaison for the SWOPSI
Policy Board with students, the Uni
versity and outside people and organi
zations;
(3) administering the program; and
(4) functioning as a liaison to the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies.
Parnes and Supton agree that the
SCIRE student codirector will have the
responsibilities of:
(1) administering SCIRE's Innova
tion Fund ($4OOO awarded in grants
twice a year to students who have
ideas for projects to improve student
life at Stanford);
(2) acting as liaison for the program
with the University community;
(3) organizing task forces to investi
gate problems of undergraduate edu
cation.
