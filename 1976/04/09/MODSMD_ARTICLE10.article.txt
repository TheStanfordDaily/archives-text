# Kissinger lauds dictatorship
## 
### 
Last February, Secretary of
State Kissinger took his first offi
cial tour through Latin America.
Although declining to visit
Chile, to avoid offending public
opinion, Kissinger reaffirmed
the United States' special rela
tionship with that other bastion
of democracy, Brazil.
What made his Brazilian stop
especially noteworthy was his
declaration, while signing a
"memorandum of understand
ing" with the generals, that
"There are no two people whose
concern for human dignity and
for the basic values of man is
more profound in day-to-day life
than Brazil and the United
States."
Kissinger demonstrated his
own concern for human dignity
when he rebuked Ambassador to
Chile David Popper for raising
the issue of torture by the Chi
lean junta during discussions of
military aid programs. As head
of the "40 Committee," Kis
singer masterminded the CIA
program to overthrow Allende
from 1970 to 1973.
President Ford's record is
hardly better. He publicly de
fends the ClA's Chilean program
and fights all attempts by Con
gress to reduce aid to repressive
dictatorships in Chile. South
Korea, the Philippines and
elsewhere.
Current actions
At a speech in San Francisco
last September, according to the
New York Times, Ford said in
the same breath that the United
States would continue CIA
covert actions against other
countries, but would "not inter
fere with allied governments
that torture their citizens be
cause the United States could
not act as a 'policeman' of the
world."
Civen these Administration
attitudes, it is not surprising that
Kissinger should find admirable
the Brazilian military's record
on human rights.
Amnesty International, the In
ternational Commission of
Jurists and other respected in
ternatioal organizations disag
ree. For years they, and the
world press, have documented
literally thousands of cases of

arbitrary imprisonment, torture,
and assassination carried out by
Brazil's military government to
suppress all resistance or dis
sent. As in Chile, torture is an
institutionalized tool of military
rule.
Victims
No one is exempt. Catholic
priests, lawyers and even milit
ary police have become victims.
A year and a half ago, Brazilian
torturers even subjected an

American Methodist mission
ary, Fred Morris, to repeated
shock treatment and beatings.
He was lucky to escape alive.
A recent Brazilian Lawyers
Association report lists a total of
300 deaths by torture in Brazil
since 1969. The association's
vice president calls the army in
telligence center "a house of
horrors."
There are some indications
that the current president, Er
nesto Geisel, wants to liberalize
the regime slightly. After the
death of two suspects at the
hands of the army's internal op
erations department, Geisel re
lieved the commander of Brazil's
second army from duty. Later he
ousted two top army intelligence
officers.
'Rigorous combat'
But Geisel's regime is hardly
innocent. He vowed, on taking
office in 1974, to continue "the
rigorous combat to safeguard
public order and institutions."
According to the archbishop of
Sao Paulo, "People are getting
arrested all over the place."
Geisel has several times in
voked the notorious Institu
tional Act No. 5 against oppo
nents (this decree, first promul
gated in 1968, suspends all civil
rights), and last September ar
rested 30 members of the
legal opposition party. In the last

year alone, the government's
anti-subversion drive has led to
the arrest of over 1000 students,
workers, journalists and other
professionals.
Public demonstrations
C3nly massive public demonst
rations against the torture deaths
of political prisoners, and the
agitation of the Catholic Church,
press and bar associations,
forced Ceisel to act against
members of the military hierar
chy. But the bureaucratic
momentum of the police state
still favors torture. Last January
the "Death Squad," a vigilante
group of off-duty military police,
tortured and assassinated
another 11 citizens — bringing
to nearly 3000 its total number
of victims.
Whatever Ceisel's own incli
nations may be, the right-wing
military, and their industrialist
allies, will undoubtedly work to
maintain the system of repres
sion. Only such a system, which
bars truly independent political
activity and forbids all strikes,
can keep in line the working

population — which has lost 30
percent of its income since 1964.
Kissinger may applaud the
Brazilian military's record on
human rights, just as he pri
vately supports the Chilean jun
ta's repression. But in this bicen
tennial year, when we should be
thinking about what freedom
means in light of this nation's
history, his remarks should re
pulse all decent Americans.
