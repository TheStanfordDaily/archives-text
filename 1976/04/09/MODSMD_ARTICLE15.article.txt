If things are so tight financially around here, why doesn't the
University charge for parking at athletic events? It's idiotic that we
the students have to pay through the nose for everything - tele
phones, parking, etc. - while the rich Palo Altans, Athertonians,
and Menlo Parkers receive free a service that is charged for almost
everywhere e/se. -J.T.
You should have learned by now that any time the University
doesn't charge for a service that it probably can't be charged for.
And parking is no exception.
In fact, the Athletics Department has commissioned professional
surveys to study the feasibility of charging for parking at football
games. According to Robert Young, associate director of athletics,
these surveys have revealed problems.
First, and most important, Young said, is the traffic backup on
Highways 101 and 280, and on El Cami no before football games. As
the University continues to close off roads to campus, the Palo Alto
traffic problem has become acute, according to Young. And a
charging system would back it up further.
Another snag is that hiring people to collect fees, or building
parking meters, might end up costing more than the revenue.
Young did say that the south end of the stadium could be effec
tively closed off. Unfortunately, that area is now reserved for Buck
Club members, who make the largest monetary contribution to the
sports program.
