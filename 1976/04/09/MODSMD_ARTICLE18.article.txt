# Two slates vie for senior class office
## Dorsey, et al. 
### Jeff Tanji 
The slate headed by Mike Dor
sey in the race for Senior Class
officers advocates a balance be
tween "good times" and a con
cern for what happens beyond
graduation for members of next
year's graduating class.
Other members of the slate, all
juniors this year, include Jamie
Grodskv, Dave Treinis and Risa
Shimoda.
Only students who will be
seniors next year will be eligible
to vote in the Senior Class elec
tions April 14-15.
Commencement speaker
"A major concern of our group
will be the idea of student par
ticipation in the choice of next
year's commencement speaker,"
said Dorsey, a history and
humanities major, and a former
ASSU senator.
During fall quarter registra
tion week, the group hopes to
survey seniors and gather possi
ble names for commencement
speaker. By a computer process,
several possibilities will arise,
said Dorsey, and these will be
given to the administration for
consideration.
"It is important also to note

that we will suggest that the ad
ministration's choice of speaker
should be subject to student
veto," said Grodsky, a human
biology and history major. "We
plan to confer with the admini
stration so that the choice of the
students will be known to
them."
The slate expressed a strong
concern for what well happen to
students upon graduation. The
group promised an increase in
publicizing of Career Planning
and Placement Center events.
Alumni Contact Service
"Another program still in its
infancy is the Alumni Contact
Service," said Dorsey. "We hope
to develop this program so that
seniors will have some expo
sure, or an idea, at least, of what
their future careers might be by
discussing careers with alumni
in similar fields."
"We don't want to leave out
the idea that we are in favor of
good times for the Senior Class,"
said Treinis, a chemical en
gineering major and lifeguard at
deCuerre pools. The group is
currently planning for one major
social event for each quarter.
