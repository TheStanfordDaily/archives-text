"The most important thing
that 1 can stress is that our cam
paign is an non-political one,
and our members are service
oriented to the nature of the posi
tion," said Scott Jones, heading
one of two groups vying for
Senior Class officers.
Jones is accompanied by three
other juniors in his slate, Ahmed
Calvo, Christine Gutierrez and
Shelly Williams.
Non-political
"In the spirit of our non
political campaign, we will be
only putting up one poster per
house, with the exception of the
large living facilities, like Mir
rielees," said Jones, an electrical
engineering major. "Many of my
friends bugged me about my
non-political views while still
running for office, but we are all
service-oriented people, and the
only way to get into office is to
run."
"It is the working with people
and getting to know new people
that gave me the reason for run
ning," said Gutierrez, a
humanities and renaissance

studies major and an RA atCavi
lan.
The group is in favor of col
lecting suggestions for a com
mencement speaker by means of
a mail survey, which will allow
input to the administration by
the seniors.
Alumni contact
"Contact with the alumni is an
important consideration," said
Ahmed Calvo, a humanities and
biology major and an active
member of the Stanford Christ
ian Fellowship, "for this reason
we are setting up a series of
student-alumni sherry hours
and dinners."
"One of our major events will
be a giant senior tailgate party."
added Shelly Williams, a junior
in mechanical engineering.
"Our group has definite plans
for social events and outings that
will enable old friends to meet
before graduation and new
friends to get together."
"We realize that we can't
realistically promise the seniors
jobs when we leave the Farm, but
realistically we can plan for a lot
of good times next year, and that
is a promise," said Jones.
