"They were one step from beating
him up," said Patrolman Ernest
Brooks.

had been forced to commit the theft.

Two of the three youths arrested
were sons of Stanford graduate stu

roof of Whitman House by students.

near the Faculty Club.
"The whole thing got started," said

Brooks, when one of the boys blurted
out, "Oh. 1 guess I have to give back
that stereo."
"F,rom that, one thing led to
another," said Brooks, including the
arrest of the third boy.
Police say they believe the boys were
responsible for approximately 35
