The Stanford police have arrested
six people who they say are responsi
ble for nearly 100 local burglaries
since mid-January.
Approximately $5000 worth of sto
len goods has been recovered, accord
ing to Patrolman Don Lillie.
Of the six arrested, three are teenage
boys, apprehended together on March
28. The other three men, arrested in
separate incidents, are Thomas Kocol,
33; Robert Augmon, 23; and Charles
Washington. 27.
Washington, of East Palo Alto, was
taken into custody on March 30, after
allegedly stealing three Wilbur Hall
Food Service cash boxes containing
$66. He was captured by kitchen staff

members and a large group of students
in front of Branner Hall. Washington
was rescued by police from the crowd.
"They were one step from beating
him up," said Patrolman Ernest
Brooks.
Brooks said Washington claimed he
had been forced to commit the theft.
In jail
Washington is now lodged in the
North County )ail in Palo Alto, Lillie
said.
Two of the three youths arrested
were sons of Stanford graduate stu
dents. The youths were spotted on the
roof of Whitman House by students.
Police later caught up with the youths
near the Faculty Club.
"The whole thing got started," said

Brooks, when one of the boys blurted
out, "Oh. 1 guess I have to give back
that stereo."
"F,rom that, one thing led to
another," said Brooks, including the
arrest of the third boy.
Police say they believe the boys were
responsible for approximately 35
burglaries, totaling from $3000-3500.
About $2500 in merchandise has been
recovered.
Mainly electrical equipment, such
r.s stereos, clock radios and televi
sions, was stolen, according to Lillie.
He said the boys used stolen office
keys and picked locks to gain entry.
Routine footcheck
Kocol was discovered on Feb. 13 by
a police officer during a routine
footcheck in the Mirrielees apart
ments. Kocol had in his possession
three or four keys, including a Mir
rielees master key, police said.
An acquaintance of Kocol's later
told police that Kocol had been living
in a car behind the apartment building.
Upon searching the car, police found
some stolen property and 200-300
Stanford keys.
Kocol, who has a previous record of
burglary convictions, has been bound
over to Superior Court for trial. Lillie
estimates he is responsible for 40
burglaries involving property totaling
$3500-4000. Approximately $2500
worth of goods was recovered.
Augmon was arrested in a stakeout
at the Stanford Medical Center, where
he was spotted entering a BMW au
tomobile by hospital security officers.
Augmon, of East Palo Alto, allegedly
specialized in stealing AM/FM stereo
radios from BMWs. After matching
his fingerprints with those taken at
other similar burglaries, police said
they believe Augmon is responsible
for about 20 such thefts. None of the
radios were recovered.
Augmon is now in the Santa Clara
County jail charged with five counts of
auto burglary, police report.
Brooks said that Stanford commun
ity members have recently been more
observant and are calling police more
often.
"It's getting to the point," he said,
"where people who live here and work
here are just sick and tired (of thefts)."
Brooks stressed the importance of
student participation in solving
burglaries. "The burglaries have to be
reported in order to enable us to do our
job," he said.
Currently, about 20 percent of the
burglaries on campus are solved, he
estimated.
