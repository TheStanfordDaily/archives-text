On May 5, 1945 two ex-fascist,
Italian convicts knocked with
gun butts at the door of Ezra
Pound's home in Rapallo, Italy.
They took the 59-year-old poet to
the Allied Forces, who had just
reached that part of Italy, and
collected a ransom. Later Pound
was driven through Rapallo in
an open jeep handcuffed to a
rapist killer and eventually
taken to a military concentration
camp near Pisa.
Imprisoned in an outdoor wire
cage on the death row of the
camp, Pound was literally
housed and treated like an ani
mal. During several weeks of sol
itary confinement, Pound be
came very ill from exposure and
eye infections. The military au
thorities eventually moved him
to a tent. Here Pound wrote some
of our century's most famous
poems. The Pisan Cantos. A few
weeks later he was flown to the
States where he became one of
the few Americans since Aaron
Burr ever indicted for treason.
The few facts hint at one of the
great riddles of modern Ameri
can intellectual history. No one
has ever satisfactorily explained
what the Americans did to Ezra
Pound or more importantly what
Pound did to America. He has
been accused of treason, praised
as an unorthodox patriot, ex
cused as an eccentric and ig
nored as a brilliant lunatic.
Influential poet
There is no doubt that Ezra
Pound is the most influential
American poet of the 20th cen
tury. There is also little doubt
that he has been the most con
troversial in both his poetics and
his politics. Gradually the poetic
issues have been resolved,
overwhelmingly in Pound's
favor. But the political questions
still confound his readers.
Most critics refuse to discuss
Pound's (or any poet's) politics.
They try to maintain a distance
between a poet's art and his poli
tics. But Pound himself refused
to make this distinction in his
work, and even his early work
before the Cantos has a keen
edge of social criticism.
Pound asked for his work to be
judged politically, not as a final
judgment perhaps but as a
necessary step toward it. Yet
except for a few perfunctory (and
usually uninformed) comments,
the academic critics, who have
flocked to Pound's work in re
cent years after a half century of
neglect, have ignored this side of
his work.
Stanford's own William Chace
has written the only intelligent

full-length study of Pound's
politics. His book, The Political
Identities of Ezra Pound and
T.S. Eliot examines the ques
tions with intelligenceand accu
racy. Chace took the time to read
everything he wrote about with
care, and his book avoids the un
believably bad scholarship of
some earlier books.
Yet Professor Chace's radical
orientation hardly makes him
sympathetic to the direction of
Pound's political activities. He
has done the best possible job of
illuminating Pound from one
political perspective. A com
plementary book from another
angle is still needed. Perhaps a
more political version of Hugh
Kenner's monumenta 1 The
Pound Era would be the nature
of this book.
Mary deßachewiltz's memoir
goes a long way in filling this
gap. It presents an inside view of
the poet and his position within
fascist Italy. While de-
Rachewiltz never explicitly de
fends her father's politics, she
does present a credible and
sympathetic view of the intellec
tual milieu in which he lived.
Impressive defense
Most Americans have been
unable to distinguish Musso
lini's Italy from Hitler's Ger
many. The causes, effects and
manifestations of fascism were
drastically different in both
countries. In an unobtrusive way
Discretions captures the flavor
of Pound's emigre existence in
Venice and Rapallo during Mus
solini's regime. By neither de
fending nor commenting on the
scene, deßachewiltz has written
an impressive defense of her
father.
A sympathetic personal por
trait of Pound is long overdue.
Most versions of Pound are
grotesque caricatures: the cereb
ral polyglot translating Chinese,
the poetic entrepreneur taking
literary London by storm, the
jew-baiting fascist broadcasting
for Mussolini. Hundreds of
people have left us snapshots of
the poet, but few of them give us
much idea about the whole man.
Discretions is an invaluable
book because it gives us a fas
cinating portrait of Pound as a
man. Until now there has been
very little trustworthy informa
tion available in English about
Pound's years in Italy. Pound
spent the 20 most productive
years of his life in Italy, the
longest amount of time he spent
in any one country during his
adult life. Until now most of the
crucial events of these years
have remained vague and dis
torted.
Discretions also provides
genuine insights into The Can
tos, Pound's most ambitious

literary work. His daughter
never discusses the book as
such, but she continually
weaves in passages from the
Cantos into her text. These
quotes are passages Pound wrote
in his poem that reflect incidents
in his daughter's life. Many
puzzling passages in the poem
become absolutely lucid
through deßachewiltz's skillful
juxtaposition.
Deßachewiltz's memoir is an
amazing book. She tells her story

in a quiet, sympathetic way and
never preaches or propagan
dizes. The human story she re
lates takes precedence over a
political apologia for her father.
Her calm recollections will cer
tainly defend Pound's
humanism more eloquently than
any frenetic tirade. While in Pisa
Pound wrote "filial, fraternal af
fection is the root of humaness/
the root of the process." His
daughter has certainly proven
her filial affection in the best
possible way.

POUND THE POET — Most would agree that Ezra Pound is one of
the most talented and influential poets of the 20th century. But
disagreement lies in his political beliefs; was he a traitor or a
patriot? Pound refused to make a distinction between his art and
Eolitics, a factor that most critics try to overlook when discussing
is work. Pound asked that his work be judged politically as most
of his writings are distinctly social critiques.

On May 5, 1945 two ex-fascist,
Italian convicts knocked with
gun butts at the door of Ezra
Pound's home in Rapallo, Italy.
They took the 59-year-old poet to
the Allied Forces, who had just
reached that part of Italy, and
collected a ransom. Later Pound
was driven through Rapallo in
an open jeep handcuffed to a
rapist killer and eventually
taken to a military concentration
camp near Pisa.
Imprisoned in an outdoor wire
cage on the death row of the
camp, Pound was literally
housed and treated like an ani
mal. During several weeks of sol
itary confinement, Pound be
came very ill from exposure and
eye infections. The military au
thorities eventually moved him
to a tent. Here Pound wrote some
of our century's most famous
poems. The Pisan Cantos. A few
weeks later he was flown to the
States where he became one of
the few Americans since Aaron
Burr ever indicted for treason.
The few facts hint at one of the
great riddles of modern Ameri
can intellectual history. No one
has ever satisfactorily explained
what the Americans did to Ezra
Pound or more importantly what
Pound did to America. He has
been accused of treason, praised
as an unorthodox patriot, ex
cused as an eccentric and ig
nored as a brilliant lunatic.
Influential poet
There is no doubt that Ezra
Pound is the most influential
American poet of the 20th cen
tury. There is also little doubt
that he has been the most con
troversial in both his poetics and
his politics. Gradually the poetic
issues have been resolved,
overwhelmingly in Pound's
favor. But the political questions
still confound his readers.
Most critics refuse to discuss
Pound's (or any poet's) politics.
They try to maintain a distance
between a poet's art and his poli
tics. But Pound himself refused
to make this distinction in his
work, and even his early work
before the Cantos has a keen
edge of social criticism.
Pound asked for his work to be
judged politically, not as a final
judgment perhaps but as a
necessary step toward it. Yet
except for a few perfunctory (and
usually uninformed) comments,
the academic critics, who have
flocked to Pound's work in re
cent years after a half century of
neglect, have ignored this side of
his work.
Stanford's own William Chace
has written the only intelligent

full-length study of Pound's
politics. His book, The Political
Identities of Ezra Pound and
T.S. Eliot examines the ques
tions with intelligenceand accu
racy. Chace took the time to read
everything he wrote about with
care, and his book avoids the un
believably bad scholarship of
some earlier books.
Yet Professor Chace's radical
orientation hardly makes him
sympathetic to the direction of
Pound's political activities. He
has done the best possible job of
illuminating Pound from one
political perspective. A com
plementary book from another
angle is still needed. Perhaps a
more political version of Hugh
Kenner's monumenta 1 The
Pound Era would be the nature
of this book.
Mary deßachewiltz's memoir
goes a long way in filling this
gap. It presents an inside view of
the poet and his position within
fascist Italy. While de-
Rachewiltz never explicitly de
fends her father's politics, she
does present a credible and
sympathetic view of the intellec
tual milieu in which he lived.
Impressive defense
Most Americans have been
unable to distinguish Musso
lini's Italy from Hitler's Ger
many. The causes, effects and
manifestations of fascism were
drastically different in both
countries. In an unobtrusive way
Discretions captures the flavor
of Pound's emigre existence in
Venice and Rapallo during Mus
solini's regime. By neither de
fending nor commenting on the
scene, deßachewiltz has written
an impressive defense of her
father.
A sympathetic personal por
trait of Pound is long overdue.
Most versions of Pound are
grotesque caricatures: the cereb
ral polyglot translating Chinese,
the poetic entrepreneur taking
literary London by storm, the
jew-baiting fascist broadcasting
for Mussolini. Hundreds of
people have left us snapshots of
the poet, but few of them give us
much idea about the whole man.
Discretions is an invaluable
book because it gives us a fas
cinating portrait of Pound as a
man. Until now there has been
very little trustworthy informa
tion available in English about
Pound's years in Italy. Pound
spent the 20 most productive
years of his life in Italy, the
longest amount of time he spent
in any one country during his
adult life. Until now most of the
crucial events of these years
have remained vague and dis
torted.
Discretions also provides
genuine insights into The Can
tos, Pound's most ambitious

literary work. His daughter
never discusses the book as
such, but she continually
weaves in passages from the
Cantos into her text. These
quotes are passages Pound wrote
in his poem that reflect incidents
in his daughter's life. Many
puzzling passages in the poem
become absolutely lucid
through deßachewiltz's skillful
juxtaposition.
Deßachewiltz's memoir is an
amazing book. She tells her story

in a quiet, sympathetic way and
never preaches or propagan
dizes. The human story she re
lates takes precedence over a
political apologia for her father.
Her calm recollections will cer

POUND THE POET — Most would agree that Ezra Pound is one of
the most talented and influential poets of the 20th century. But
disagreement lies in his political beliefs; was he a traitor or a
patriot? Pound refused to make a distinction between his art and
Eolitics, a factor that most critics try to overlook when discussing
is work. Pound asked that his work be judged politically as most
of his writings are distinctly social critiques.

On May 5, 1945 two ex-fascist,
Italian convicts knocked with
gun butts at the door of Ezra
Pound's home in Rapallo, Italy.
They took the 59-year-old poet to
the Allied Forces, who had just
reached that part of Italy, and
collected a ransom. Later Pound
was driven through Rapallo in
an open jeep handcuffed to a
rapist killer and eventually
taken to a military concentration
camp near Pisa.
Imprisoned in an outdoor wire
cage on the death row of the
camp, Pound was literally
housed and treated like an ani
mal. During several weeks of sol
itary confinement, Pound be
came very ill from exposure and
eye infections. The military au
thorities eventually moved him
to a tent. Here Pound wrote some
of our century's most famous
poems. The Pisan Cantos. A few
weeks later he was flown to the
States where he became one of
the few Americans since Aaron
Burr ever indicted for treason.
The few facts hint at one of the
great riddles of modern Ameri
can intellectual history. No one
has ever satisfactorily explained
what the Americans did to Ezra
Pound or more importantly what
Pound did to America. He has
been accused of treason, praised
as an unorthodox patriot, ex
cused as an eccentric and ig
nored as a brilliant lunatic.
Influential poet
There is no doubt that Ezra
Pound is the most influential
American poet of the 20th cen
tury. There is also little doubt
that he has been the most con
troversial in both his poetics and
his politics. Gradually the poetic
issues have been resolved,
overwhelmingly in Pound's
favor. But the political questions
still confound his readers.
Most critics refuse to discuss
Pound's (or any poet's) politics.
They try to maintain a distance
between a poet's art and his poli
tics. But Pound himself refused
to make this distinction in his
work, and even his early work
before the Cantos has a keen
edge of social criticism.
Pound asked for his work to be
judged politically, not as a final
judgment perhaps but as a
necessary step toward it. Yet
except for a few perfunctory (and
usually uninformed) comments,
the academic critics, who have
flocked to Pound's work in re
cent years after a half century of
neglect, have ignored this side of
his work.
Stanford's own William Chace
has written the only intelligent

full-length study of Pound's
politics. His book, The Political
Identities of Ezra Pound and
T.S. Eliot examines the ques
tions with intelligenceand accu
racy. Chace took the time to read
everything he wrote about with
care, and his book avoids the un
believably bad scholarship of
some earlier books.
Yet Professor Chace's radical
orientation hardly makes him
sympathetic to the direction of
Pound's political activities. He
has done the best possible job of
illuminating Pound from one
political perspective. A com
plementary book from another
angle is still needed. Perhaps a
more political version of Hugh
Kenner's monumenta 1 The
Pound Era would be the nature
of this book.
Mary deßachewiltz's memoir
goes a long way in filling this
gap. It presents an inside view of
the poet and his position within
fascist Italy. While de-
Rachewiltz never explicitly de
fends her father's politics, she
does present a credible and
sympathetic view of the intellec
tual milieu in which he lived.
Impressive defense
Most Americans have been
unable to distinguish Musso
lini's Italy from Hitler's Ger
many. The causes, effects and
manifestations of fascism were
drastically different in both
countries. In an unobtrusive way
Discretions captures the flavor
of Pound's emigre existence in
Venice and Rapallo during Mus
solini's regime. By neither de
fending nor commenting on the
scene, deßachewiltz has written
an impressive defense of her
father.
A sympathetic personal por
trait of Pound is long overdue.
Most versions of Pound are
grotesque caricatures: the cereb
ral polyglot translating Chinese,
the poetic entrepreneur taking
literary London by storm, the
jew-baiting fascist broadcasting
for Mussolini. Hundreds of
people have left us snapshots of
the poet, but few of them give us
much idea about the whole man.
Discretions is an invaluable
book because it gives us a fas
cinating portrait of Pound as a
man. Until now there has been
very little trustworthy informa
tion available in English about
Pound's years in Italy. Pound
spent the 20 most productive
years of his life in Italy, the
longest amount of time he spent
in any one country during his
adult life. Until now most of the
crucial events of these years
have remained vague and dis
torted.
Discretions also provides
genuine insights into The Can
tos, Pound's most ambitious

literary work. His daughter

weaves in passages from the
