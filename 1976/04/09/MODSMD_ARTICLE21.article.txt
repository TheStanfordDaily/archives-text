# The 						daughter
## From peasant to princess 
### Dana Gioia 
The Princess Mary de-
Rachewiltz is tin: only daughter
ol Ezra Pound. Russian by title,
Italian by birth, American by
parentage. deßachewiltz's cos
mopolitan identity reflects the
mobility of her parents, the great
American poet and his mistress,
t he famous violinist and
musicologist, Olga Rudge.
In Italy Mary deßachewiltz is
widely known as a poet and
translator. Three books of her
own poetry have appeared in lta

lian. She has translated most of
her father's work into Italian (in
cluding most of the formidable
Cantos)as well .is the works of
E.E. Cummings, Robinson Jef
fers, Denise Levertov and
Marianne Moore.
In the English-speaking world
Mary deßachewiltz is becoming
widely-known for her important
book of memoirs. Discretions:
Ezra Pound, Father and
Teacher. Enough books have
been published on Pound to fi 11 a
large bookcase, but this volume
is the first full-length memoir of
Pound written by someone who
knew him intimately.
Deßachewiltz has a childhood
reminiscent of a fairy tale. Left
by her parents as an infant in the
hands of a Tyrolean peasant fam
ily, she was raised speaking a
German dialect in the Italian
Alps. She joined the family in
chores and tended her own flock
of sheep. Gradually she was in
troduced to her parents' world in
Venice. Although both of her pa
rents were American, they spoke
to her in Italian, since this was
the country in which they in
tended to stay.
In the Tyrols she received her
education in Italian, the lan
guage made mandatory by the
new fascist regime. After she
had joined her parents in Italy
she was tutored in English and
Greek by her father and in
French and Latin by Desmond
Shute, an Englishman living in
Italy. To perfect her knowledge
of Italian she was sent to a con
vent school in Florence.
As a girl deßachewiltz held
both of her parents in considera
ble awe. Almost like her Tyro
lean foster parents she consi
dered them in a class above her.
Pound gradually broke through
these barriers. His frankness and
affection spoke to the girl in a
paternal way. Mary's mother, the
temperamental virtuoso, did not

have Pound's gift. Until the war
and Pound's imprisonment Olga
Rudge seemed cold and aloof to
her daughter.
The difference between her
parents is captured in one inci
dent deßachewiltz recalls in her
memoirs. After seeing a (linger
Rogers-Fred Astaire film in Ven
ice Pound tap-danced his way
home, encouraging his daughter
to do likewise. Once home
Pound went to his room, took off
his coat and proceeded to do a
deafening Fred Astaire imita
tion. His wife entered the room
and quickly put an end to
Pound's spontaneous antics. I ler
scolding the poet for his lack of
propriety was typical of her
proper and reserved demeanor.
The war and its aftermath left
deßachewiltz like so many other
Europeans in a state of desperate
confusion. Her troubles were in
creased when her father was
taken to the United States to
stand trial for treason and then
confined to St. Elizabeth's Hos
pital. Yet like so many of her
contemporaries she survived
and did so brilliantly.
Soon after the war she married
an exiled Russian prince, Boris
deßachewiltz. Together they
took over a dilapidated castle
near her childhood village and
slowly renovated it. While
working for her father's release,
she gradually joined interna
tional literary circles and began
publishing verse and transla
tions of her father's work.
Now an established author in
two languages Mary de-
Rachewiltz guards her father's
memory quite literally. She has
become the curator of the Ezra
Pound archive at Yale Univer
sity. Occasinally she lectures on
her father's work. She is keeping
his memory alive with a per
sonal touch. Few poets are that
lucky.
