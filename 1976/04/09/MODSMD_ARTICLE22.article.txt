## Women, men meet in Maples Tennis teams to take on Trinity 
### Paul Bauman 
It hardly seems as if a year has
passed.
Last spring, a few hardy souls
ventured into the open air to
watch Stanford men's tennis
team clobber Trinity, that
obscure tennis power in Texas,
8-1, on the Varsity Courts.
The women's team didn't play
Trinity at all last year.
It will be all different this time
around.
Not only will both the Card
men and women play Trinity
this weekend, but they'll com

pete as one team. Stanford and
Trinity will play a total of 18
matches — six men's singles and
six women's singles, two men's
doubles, two women's^douhies
and two mixed doubles. All scor
ing of matches will be combined
with one school emerging as the
overall winner, an innovation in
collegiate tennis.
Furthermore, top men's and
women's matches will be played
in Maples Pavilion.
The 18 matches will be spread
over today and tomorrow. Six
contests will be played today on

the Varsity Courts, at 1 p.m. and
2:30 p.m., while tirst women's
doubles, first men's singles and
mixed doubles are scheduled in
that order for Maples Pavilion,
starting at 6:30 p.m.
Six more matches
Six more matches will be
played tomorrow on the Varsity
Courts at 1 p.m. and 2:30 p.m., to
be followed by first men's dou
bles, first women's singles, and
mixed doubles in Maples Pavil
ion beginning again at 6:30 p.m.
When and if you get the logis
tics figured out, the match could

be pretty interesting.
TheTrinity women are ranked
first in the nation with Stan
ford's women right behind at No.
2. The Card men are also ranked
second, while Trinity's males
are fourth.
One of the best matchups
should be the No. 1 women's
singles Saturday night, in which
Stanford's Lele Forood meets
Stephanie Tolleson. Tolleson
defeated Forood in the finals of
the women's collegiate nationals
last year. In other words, Forood
and Tolleson are probably the
two best amateur women in the
U.S.
About time
Stanford women's coach Anne
Hill said it's about time Forood, a
double gold-medalist in the Pan
American Games last fall, had
the opportunity to play in front
of a large crowd in Maples.
"Definitely. She deserves it.
She's one of the very top
amateurs in the country. It's in
teresting that she came to Stan
ford without a tennis scholar
ship, and she wasn't recruited.
So I'm really glad she's getting
the recognition. Before the
merger (of the men's and wo
men's athletic departments),
she probably wouldn't have."
Trinity's top men's player is
All-American Bill Scanlon. The
sophomore reached the quarter
finals of the NCAA Champion
ships last year.
The Stanford men (10-2) pre
pared for Trinity this week with
wins over California, 9-0 Tues
day in Berkeley, and San Jose
State, 5-1 in a rain-shortened
match Wednesday on the Varsity
Courts.
Only 1000
The Cards' only loss came in
first singles as Joe Meyers of San
Jose State defeated Bill Maze 6-4,

6-2.
Maze looked totally unin
spired in losing. He repeatedly
missed easy shots and im
mediately afterward, showing
no emotion, got set for the next
point.
Tennis notes: Plenty of tickets
still remain for all Trinity
matches. Prices for students are
50 cents outdoors and $1 indoors
. . . KZSU (90.1 FM) will broad
cast live the matches in Maples
Friday and Saturday nights . . .
Gene Mayer will again play only
doubles because of a pulled back
muscle.

READY FOR MAPLES — Freshman Barbara Jordan, second on the
Stanford women's tennis ladder, will be playing first women's
doubles with Lele Forood against Trinity's Stephanie Tolleson
and Sandy Stap tonight in Maples. Last year Jordan was the
second ranked junior (18 and under) in the nation for both singles
and doubles.
