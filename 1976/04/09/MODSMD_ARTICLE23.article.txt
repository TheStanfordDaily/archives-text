# Cardinal knowledge
## Women's tennis rises 
### Ron Beck 
The strongest tennis team in Stanford's history
takes to the courts today and tomorrow in a match
that might be a preview of the national collegiate
finals in June.
Dick Gould's men are playing UCLA again?
No. Anne Hill's women meet Trinity University
as part of the bizarre set-up that includes the men
and women teams of both schools (see accom
panying story).
"This is a great opportunity for the girls," says
coach Hill. "This match gives them a chance to
play in front of a large crowd. And from this,
they'll probably get more crowds for the rest of the
year."
Hill's optimism over the team's performance is
well warranted. This year's women's team might
be the strongest collegiate team ever fielded â€”
outside of Trinity territory.
Double gold
Lele Forood, a double gold medalist at the Fan
Am games, leads the Cardinal attack. Stephanie
Tolleson, a teammate of Forood at the Fan Am
games and last year's collegiate singles champ
ion, meets Forood in a replay of last season's final
college match.
"Lele and Stephanie are without question two
of the best amateurs in the nation" says Hill.
"They always play well against each other."
Freshmen Barb Jordan and Susie Hagey will
face Mary Hamm (ranked 29th in the U.S. Wo
men's Rankings) and Sandy Stap (ranked 37th) in
the second and third singles matches.
Marcy O'Keefe plays Carrie Fleming in the
fourth singles match. Both O'Keefe and Fleming
were playing professionally a couple years back,
but both re-entered the amateur ranks to play col

legiate tennis.
Diane Morrison, the third freshman in the start
ing lineup for the Cards, plays Donna Stockton,
while Liza Fande takes on either Val Franta or
Ann Schroeder in the final singles match.
Last year, Trinity's Tiger women almost dou
bled the Cards in total points to take the National
Women's Collegiates. Men's coach Dick Gould
says that while Stanford's women have improved
considerably this season with the addition of the
three starting freshman, "Trinity is 10 times as
good as they were last year."
"They're No. ladds Hill. "They're just a super
team. They've got super depth."
Meeting Trinity two months away from the na
tionals will be good for the team, explains Hill.
"It'll give us an opportunity to see how well we
match up against them," she says.
Experiment
The Cards enter the Trinity experiment with a
2-0 dual match record and a victory in the pre
stigious Arizona Invitational tournament.
"I'm very pleased with the way all the girls are
playing," says Hill. "Some of our top girls haven't
played a dual match yet (Forood, Jordan and
Hagey), but I'm sure they're ready."
After theTrinity match, the women don't have a
demanding home match until the coed exhibition
on May 7 against the San Francisco Golden Gaters
of World Team Tennis. For the second time, Stan
ford tennis fans will get a chance to see
Forood and a couple of teammates in Maples ac
tion. It will be a good rest from the serve and slam
game that has been on display inside for the last
two seasons.
