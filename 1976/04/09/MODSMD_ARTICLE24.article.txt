# Pro football draft opens
## 
### 
If you've waited a couple of
months for something, what dif
ference can a few extra hours
make?
Plenty, at least to four Stanford
seniors who had not been
drafted through the first seven
rounds of the National Football
League (NFL) college draft.
Kicker Mike Langford, tight
end Ted Pappas, linebacker Geb
Church and center Todd Ander
son were among the hundreds of
college seniors who stayed close
to their telephones yesterday,
waiting for the call from New
York City.
The NFL, which usually holds
its annual talent allotment in

early February, was forced to
delay its 1976 draft because of
legal battles.
With 10 more rounds
scheduled for completion today,
the Card seniors, along with a
couple hundred other college
football players, shouldn't have
long to wait.
Running backs may have
dominated the first round of the
draft, but it was a defensive
lineman who was the first player
selected.
Oklahoma All-American de
fensive end Leroy Selmon was
the draft's No. 1 pick, going to
the expansion Tampa Bay
Bucaneers. In the second round,

the Bucaneers, refusing to break
up the Ail-American brother act
which almost brought the Soon
ers a national championship,
selected Selmon's brother De
wey.
Notre Dame lineman Steve
Niehaus was the No. 2 pick,
going to the Seattle Seahawks.
Cal's Chuck Muncie was
selected ahead of Heisman
Trophy winner Archie Griffin.
Muncie was the third man to be
selected, going to New Orleans.
Griffin was the sixth and final
runner chosen in the first round,
going to Cincinnati.
The San Francisco 49ers. who
gave up all their first round
selections in the Jim Plunkett
trade, drafted UCLA center
Randy Cross and Kansas defen
sive back Eddie Lewis as their
top picks in the draft's second
round.
The 49ers also gave Plunkett a
good target in Cal receiver Steve
Rivera. "Rivera is a real battler, a
winner," said 49er coach Monty
Clark. "He's tougher than a pine
nut," Clark said of the All-Coast
wide receiver.
