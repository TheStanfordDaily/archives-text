# Staves off wind, rain
## Card nine beats Sacramento 
### Linda Buddenberg 
"It's a great day if you happen
to be a duck" commented
baseball coach Ray Young, sur
veying a windy, soggy Sunken
Diamond.
Feathered or not, the Cardi
nals emerged Wednesday, wet
and windblown, with a 10-2 vic
tory over Sacramento State.
A hustling offense, including
eight stolen bases and 12 hits,
made up for somewhat shaky
pitching from John Yandle and
Bruce Fiala for Stanford.
Freshman Larry Reynolds, at
center field again after recover
ing from a sore shoulder, led the
offensive onslaught with a tri
ple, two singles and two stolen
bases.
"You had to concentrate with
that wind," Reynolds said. "I
was just hoping to keep the ball
anywhere on the ground."
Thieves
Young said he was pleased
with his team's basepath thiev
ery, noting that, "It's not just a
matter of desire. This has got to
be a running club. We're not
doing it with the bat, so we've
got to do it on the basepaths."
"And you notice, it's not just
one or two guys," he added.
"Everyone is running. Today
was a perfect example — seven
different guys had stolen bases."
Wednesday's steals bought
the season total to 105. With over
one third of the season still to
come, the team should have a
good shot at last year's record of
141 steals.
Capitalizing on some of Sac
ramento's six errors and clutch
hits from just about everyone,
especially Dave Perez and Randy
Wong, the Cards kept scoring
rallies going in the third, fifth,
seventh and eighth innings.
Perfect example
The seventh inning was a per
fect example of the Cards' style
of play. Errors put Steve Davis
and Bruce Walters on base. After
the two hesitantly started a dou
ble steal, the Sacramento
catcher, thinking it wasa pick off
play, threw to first. During
another throwing error, both
runners scored.
"Call that a group panic all the

way around," said coach Young
when asked how to score it.
Either the offense or the
weather must have intimidated
Sacramento, because Stanford
starter Yandle, who picked
up his fifth win while holding
Scramento to two runs, wasn't
scaring anybody. He only al
lowed three hits in six innings,
but walked six men.
"The wind didn't bother me
physically as much as
psychologically," he said. "I'm
from Oregon and it's always like
this up there, so I can't use that as
an excuse.

Fiala, after an uncertain start,
did a creditable relief job after
taking over for Yandle in the
sixth. He walked one, allowed
four hits, and struck out four.
Fiala, along with Brian Herri
son and a so-far unnamed third
freshman, will be starting this
weekend against Santa Barbara.
"I'm really not impressed with
the way any of the pitching staff
has been doing," commented
Young. "This base-on-balls bus
iness especially has got to go — 1
think we're averaging about five
a game."
"If the pitching doesn't

change, there's going to be a lot
of pressure on the defense, and
it's not real consistent."
Previewing this weekend's
three-game series against Santa
Barbara, Young said, "we'll con
centrate on each game separately
and not think about a sweep."
"Santa Barbara has three or
four good hitters, and all-around
good capabilities, even though
they've been having their prob
lems. We don't want to lose
momentum for a minute."

"It's a great day if you happen
to be a duck" commented
baseball coach Ray Young, sur
veying a windy, soggy Sunken
Diamond.
Feathered or not, the Cardi
nals emerged Wednesday, wet
and windblown, with a 10-2 vic
tory over Sacramento State.
A hustling offense, including
eight stolen bases and 12 hits,
made up for somewhat shaky
pitching from John Yandle and
Bruce Fiala for Stanford.
Freshman Larry Reynolds, at
center field again after recover
ing from a sore shoulder, led the
offensive onslaught with a tri
ple, two singles and two stolen
bases.
"You had to concentrate with
that wind," Reynolds said. "I
was just hoping to keep the ball
anywhere on the ground."
Thieves
Young said he was pleased
with his team's basepath thiev
ery, noting that, "It's not just a
matter of desire. This has got to
be a running club. We're not
doing it with the bat, so we've
got to do it on the basepaths."
"And you notice, it's not just
one or two guys," he added.
"Everyone is running. Today
was a perfect example — seven
different guys had stolen bases."
Wednesday's steals bought
the season total to 105. With over
one third of the season still to
come, the team should have a
good shot at last year's record of
141 steals.
Capitalizing on some of Sac
ramento's six errors and clutch
hits from just about everyone,
especially Dave Perez and Randy
Wong, the Cards kept scoring
rallies going in the third, fifth,
seventh and eighth innings.
Perfect example
The seventh inning was a per
fect example of the Cards' style
of play. Errors put Steve Davis
and Bruce Walters on base. After
the two hesitantly started a dou
ble steal, the Sacramento
catcher, thinking it wasa pick off
play, threw to first. During
another throwing error, both
runners scored.
"Call that a group panic all the

way around," said coach Young
when asked how to score it.
Either the offense or the
weather must have intimidated
Sacramento, because Stanford
starter Yandle, who picked
up his fifth win while holding
Scramento to two runs, wasn't
scaring anybody. He only al
lowed three hits in six innings,
but walked six men.
"The wind didn't bother me
physically as much as
psychologically," he said. "I'm
from Oregon and it's always like
this up there, so I can't use that as
an excuse.

Fiala, after an uncertain start,
did a creditable relief job after
taking over for Yandle in the
sixth. He walked one, allowed
four hits, and struck out four.
Fiala, along with Brian Herri
son and a so-far unnamed third
freshman, will be starting this
weekend against Santa Barbara.
"I'm really not impressed with
the way any of the pitching staff
has been doing," commented
Young. "This base-on-balls bus
iness especially has got to go — 1
think we're averaging about five
a game."
"If the pitching doesn't

change, there's going to be a lot
of pressure on the defense, and
it's not real consistent."
Previewing this weekend's
three-game series against Santa
Barbara, Young said, "we'll con
centrate on each game separately
and not think about a sweep."
"Santa Barbara has three or
four good hitters, and all-around
good capabilities, even though
they've been having their prob
lems. We don't want to lose
momentum for a minute."
