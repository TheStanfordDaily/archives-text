# The 						net result –
## Reds, Phils to win 
### Mike Tollin 
Baseball's back, folks. Yeah,
that's right, the grand old game,
the national pastime. What, not
interested?
All right, how about if I tell
you how the teams'll finish.
Then you can go out and win
yourself some money. On me.
Western Division
Rooting for the Cincinnati
Reds is like rooting for Standard
Oil. Their only weakness is at
third base coach. Eastwick,
McEnaney and Borbon comprise
the best bullpen this side of
Madrid. The rest of the divi
sion's only chance is if Pete
Rose's batteries wear out.
There's talk of installing heat
ers in frigid Candlestick Park,
serving wine, and having a
promotion night for everyone
this side of Toronto. Major
league baseball may not be ready
to replace enology for the cos
mopolitan denizens of San
Francisco, but suddenly the
Giants are chic.
Walter Alston should have
gotten out while he was ahead.
The Dodgers' Andy Messersmith
can't seem to pick out a uniform,
hefty Mike Marshall has started
moonlighting as a locksmith,
and Los Angeles has subtracted
four quality players for a Baker

named Dusty.
Atlanta seems ready to
supplant Philadelphia as the
City of Brotherly Losses. The
Braves, coming off the third
worst major league record,
traded roadrunner Ralph Garr
and Hank Aaron's immortal
ballboy, Tom House. Jim Wynn
and Ken Henderson will take
their cuts in the House that Built
Aaron, but they'll probably have
to wake up Chief Nokahoma.
San Diego's new pitching
coach once set a record for con
secutive losses in a season. The
seven-year-old Pads, with nine
players over 30, seem to be ap
plying for Social Security be
nefits instead of building for the
future.
In 1962 Richard Nixon ran
against Pat Brown and the Hous
ton Colt-45s joined the major
leagues. Fourteen years later
both have sunk to new depths.
Houston finished 43V2 games
behind the Reds last year, but
Cesar Cedeno is still murder in
center field.
Eastern Division
Frank Rizzo, Philadelphia
mayor and noted intellectual,
summed it up:"Dis is de year!"
The Phils, who haven't won a
pennant since the 1950 Whiz
Kids, have the best one-two
punch in baseball (Schmidt and
Luzinski).
Rumor has it that a Mr.
McDonald is going to buy St.
Louis' Gateway Arch, paint it
gold, and start selling hambur
gers in nearby Busch Memorial

Stadium. The Cards, featuring
the game's premier outfield and
some excellent young players,
could turn ownerGussie Busch's
brew into champagne.
Pittsburgh Manager Danny
Murtaugh continues to win titles
and avert heart attacks; this year
he ought to shoot for one out of
two. The Pirate bats are still
there, but they could use a stop
per and Manny Sanguillen
couldn't throw out Murtaugh
stealing second base.
Quick — name the manager of
the New York Mets. Give up? Joe
Frazier's his name, pitching's
his game. The boxer's namesake
has four good hurlers now with
Tom Terrific inked, but beyond
that, well Dave (Kong) Kingman
can only hit so many homers. If
you're in New York, root for the
Yankees.
Remember Santo, Kessinger,
Beckert, and Banks? A million
dollar infield that never brought
Chicago a dime of champion
ship money. Madlock, Rosello,
Trillo, and Thornton doesn't
quite have the ring, but they're
not bad. Trouble is, the pitching
staff is very bad. Maybe they
should play night games at
Wrigley Field to even things up.
The Montreal team is a col
lection of .260 hitters and eight
game winners, and Expo General
Manager Jim Fanning was last
seen working on a construction
crew in the Olympic Village.

Quick — name the manager of
the New York Mets. Give up? Joe
Frazier's his name, pitching's
his game. The boxer's namesake
has four good hurlers now with
Tom Terrific inked, but beyond
that, well Dave (Kong) Kingman
can only hit so many homers. If
you're in New York, root for the
Yankees.
Remember Santo, Kessinger,
Beckert, and Banks? A million
dollar infield that never brought
Chicago a dime of champion
ship money. Madlock, Rosello,
Trillo, and Thornton doesn't
quite have the ring, but they're
not bad. Trouble is, the pitching
staff is very bad. Maybe they
should play night games at
Wrigley Field to even things up.

Baseball's back, folks. Yeah,
that's right, the grand old game,
the national pastime. What, not

All right, how about if I tell
you how the teams'll finish.

yourself some money. On me.
Western Division
Rooting for the Cincinnati
Reds is like rooting for Standard
Oil. Their only weakness is at
third base coach. Eastwick,
McEnaney and Borbon comprise
the best bullpen this side of

Rose's batteries wear out.
There's talk of installing heat
ers in frigid Candlestick Park,
serving wine, and having a
promotion night for everyone
this side of Toronto. Major

Francisco, but suddenly the
Giants are chic.
Walter Alston should have

The Dodgers' Andy Messersmith

hefty Mike Marshall has started
moonlighting as a locksmith,

four quality players for a Baker

Atlanta seems ready to
supplant Philadelphia as the
City of Brotherly Losses. The
Braves, coming off the third
worst major league record,
traded roadrunner Ralph Garr
and Hank Aaron's immortal
ballboy, Tom House. Jim Wynn
and Ken Henderson will take
their cuts in the House that Built
Aaron, but they'll probably have
to wake up Chief Nokahoma.
San Diego's new pitching
coach once set a record for con

seven-year-old Pads, with nine

In 1962 Richard Nixon ran

Houston finished 43V2 games
