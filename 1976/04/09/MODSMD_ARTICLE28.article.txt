Barons face Oxy
Stanford's cindermen travel
south today for tomorrow's dual
meet with Occidental. The Rob
ber Barons, coming off last
week's loss to USC, seek to im
prove their season record of
2-1 with a win over Oxy.
The Stanford-Occidental
series has been a competitive
one. Oxy has won 11 of the 20
meets, with three having been
decided by one point.
Stanford coach Payton Jordan
says he sees no reason why this
year's meet will be different than
the previous ones.
"They have been pointing to
this meet all season," says Jor
dan. "This is the meet of the year
for them every year."
Jordan coached 10 years at Oc
cidental before accepting his

present position on the Farm.
Oxy won 10 league champion
ships under Jordan's tutelage.
He also guided it to a fourth
place finish in the NCAA finals.
New coach
Don Frease was named coach
of the junior varsity football
team Wednesday. Frease had
been a graduate assistant for the
team the past two seasons.
Men golfers win
Coming from behind, the
Stanford men's golf team edged
Hawaii, 14V2-12V2, in a rainy
match Wednesday at the Stan
ford golf course.
Bruce McDonald, the Cards'
sixth man, pulled his team out of
a 8-10 deficit, shooting an 80 and

registering a 2V2-V2 match win.
His round, when paired with
teammate Bob Blum's round,
also gave the Cards a 3-0 best ball
win.
Sophomore Mike Peck, play
ing in the No. 1 position for
injured Glenn Goethals, shot a
team-leading 73, five strokes
ahead of his opponent, Armando
Claudio.
Jay Johnston shot an 80, and
won his match, while Kim Cater,
79, Ray Navis, 80, and Bob Blum,
91, all lost their matches.
Reviewing his team's perfor
mance, coach Bud Finger de
clared, "Any team with depth
would have won this match.
Rounds of 80 and 91 just don't
win matches. We've just been
lucky."

THE WINNER — Lefthander John Yandle picked up his fifth win of the season Wednesday, as the
Stanford baseball team beat Sacramento State, 10-2. Yandle left in the sixth inning, after giving up
two runs, three hits and six walks. Looking over his 5-4 record this season, Yandle says,"I changed
my style to more of a sidearm this year and I'm still having problems with it."

mance, coach Bud Finger de
clared, "Any team with depth
would have won this match.
Rounds of 80 and 91 just don't
win matches. We've just been
lucky."

THE WINNER — Lefthander John Yandle picked up his fifth win of the season Wednesday, as the
Stanford baseball team beat Sacramento State, 10-2. Yandle left in the sixth inning, after giving up
two runs, three hits and six walks. Looking over his 5-4 record this season, Yandle says,"I changed
my style to more of a sidearm this year and I'm still having problems with it."
Barons face Oxy
Stanford's cindermen travel
south today for tomorrow's dual
meet with Occidental. The Rob
ber Barons, coming off last
week's loss to USC, seek to im
prove their season record of
2-1 with a win over Oxy.
The Stanford-Occidental
series has been a competitive
one. Oxy has won 11 of the 20
meets, with three having been
decided by one point.
Stanford coach Payton Jordan
says he sees no reason why this
year's meet will be different than
the previous ones.
"They have been pointing to
this meet all season," says Jor
dan. "This is the meet of the year
for them every year."
Jordan coached 10 years at Oc
cidental before accepting his

present position on the Farm.
Oxy won 10 league champion
ships under Jordan's tutelage.
He also guided it to a fourth
place finish in the NCAA finals.
New coach
Don Frease was named coach
of the junior varsity football
team Wednesday. Frease had
been a graduate assistant for the
team the past two seasons.
Men golfers win
Coming from behind, the
Stanford men's golf team edged
Hawaii, 14V2-12V2, in a rainy
match Wednesday at the Stan
ford golf course.
Bruce McDonald, the Cards'
sixth man, pulled his team out of
a 8-10 deficit, shooting an 80 and

registering a 2V2-V2 match win.
His round, when paired with
teammate Bob Blum's round,
also gave the Cards a 3-0 best ball
win.
Sophomore Mike Peck, play
ing in the No. 1 position for
injured Glenn Goethals, shot a
team-leading 73, five strokes
ahead of his opponent, Armando
Claudio.
Jay Johnston shot an 80, and
won his match, while Kim Cater,
79, Ray Navis, 80, and Bob Blum,
91, all lost their matches.
Reviewing his team's perfor
mance, coach Bud Finger de
clared, "Any team with depth
would have won this match.
