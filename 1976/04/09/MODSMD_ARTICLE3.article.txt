"Some people think it's wrong to take a strong posi
tion, but we feel it's important that we be leaders, not
bureaucrats," said Dan Howard, a junior in biology and
head of the Howard Council of Presidents (COP) slate.
"Bureaucrats organize things so they flow well, but
leaders take strong opinions and initiate action," he said.
Other members of the slate are Liz Ryll, Keith Ar
chuleta and Bill Tyndall.
"We see ourselves as activist — not sitting around, but
working with structural and non-structural means to
achieve change," said Ryll, a first-year graduate student
in economics.
Willing to work
Slate members have emphasized their willingness to
"work hard both within and outside of existing chan
nels" for things in which they believe.
"It means we're willing to put up a fight for a deci
sion," said Tyndall, a junior in American studies.
"For example, in tenure, there is no committee for
students to go to to express their opinions (on tenure).
We would organize (student) departmental organiza
tions. T hey could lobby and demonstrate; by being force
ful enough they could have an impact."
"The important thing is to organize those people con
cerned with the issue (and have them) put pressure upon
those responsible for making the decisions," said How
ard.
He cited the large mass demonstration last year sup

porting the continuation of SWOPSI/SCIRE as an exam
ple of such organized pressure.
Howard said he did not see the student apathy as an
ongoing problem.
Student involvement
"This year there were no real issues for the (students)
to get their teeth into. Definitely, students want to be
involved with decisions. Last year 80 people applied for
seven committee positions through the nominations
committee.
"I think the COP should serve as a source to tell stu
dents all possible ways to get involved (in decision mak
ing)," Howard said.
"The central thing is not how we think, but what we
think. Students have to know what we will do if they
come to us with questions," said Archuleta, a junior in
communication and psychology.
"Very few people take the time to sit down and try to
point out problems or things that should be handled,"
said Howard.
He mentioned that until the "Howard Report" (A
Study of the Committee on Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Aid) came out this year, transfer students
were getting less financial aid than non-transfer stu
dents.
This situation has since been remedied, according to
Howard, and transfer students now receive the same
amount of aid.
"Someone has to kick people in the pants to get things
moving. There is a lot to be said for being loud," he said.
