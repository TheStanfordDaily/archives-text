# 7% room, board hikes proposed for next year
## 
### Stephen Crolius 
University Housing Director Ed
Scoles has recommended that room
and board rates be increased by an av
erage of seven percent for the 1976-77
academic year.
Seven percent increases were re
commended for the residence halls'
room and board rate, the cooperative
houses' room rate and the fraternity
cluster group rate.
Increases of 8.7 percent were re
commended for the Mirrielees apart
ments, single graduate apartment and
the Escondido Village apartments.
A three percent decrease was re
commended for the Manzanita Park
room rate.
The rates for three quarters quoted
by the recommendation were:
—residence hall room $755
—residence hall board (average)
$1086
—cooperative house room $680
—Manzanita Park room $755
—Mirrielees apartment $914
—single graduate apartment $881
—Escondido Village apartment
$179-199-221 -24 5/mo.

The recommendations have been
discussed with the Committee on Ser
vices to Students (COSS) subcommit
tee on residences and the Escondido
Village Governance Advisory Com
mittee. Both g r oups concurred in the
recommendations.
The Board of Trustees will consider
the recommendations at its meeting
next Tuesday.
Fortuitous circumstances
Scoles' recommendation states that
despite "sharply rising utility costs" a
combination of fortuitous cir
cumstances, such as an increase in
summer conference use of the resi
dence halls and an over-estimation of
food cost increases has made it possi
ble for "the total housing and food ser
vice system to show a net income of 3.0
percent this year instead of the
budgeted break-even position."

The fact that "we're making a little
money this year enables us to shoot for
a small loss" next year, Scoles said at a
meeting with media representatives
yesterday. "Over time things will even
out," he added.
Scoles explained that 1976-77 is the
last year in which the housing system
will receive subsidy from any source.
The system has previously received as
much as $340,000 from the Universi
ty's General Funds.
After 1976-77, the housing system
will be "geared to break even," Scoles
said.
Merchandizing
Commenting on the decrease in the
Manzanita Park room rate, Scole ad
mitted that "some merchandizing is
going on."
Assistant to the Dean of Students
Karen Murray explained that the hous
ing office "really would like to make
(Manzanita Park) a more attractive (liv
ing) option ... a financial incentive is
the thing to try next."
Utility costs, especially electricity
and heat, account for the largest in
creases in the budget. Between 1973
and the present they have gone up al
most 140 percent, according to Scoles.
Me said that as far as he knows, there
is no University-wide long-range plan
for reducing University dependent on
ever-more-costly energy sources.
He mentioned, however, that several
short term, "quick pay-oft" schemes
are being put into effect, such as the
construction of a large storage tank for
chilled water to increase the efficiency
of the air conditioning system.
