# Judge rules on parking citation

A Palo Alto Municipal Court deci
sion which found ASSIJ Senate
Chairman William Hoke not guilty of a
parking violation on campus will have
"no impact at all" on a United Stanford
Employees (USE) lawsuit against the
University for its enforcement of park
ing regulations, according to Richard
Potack, an attorney for USE.
The USE lawsuit is currently under
appeal to the District Court of Appeals
for the State of California, according to
Potack. who is preparing to submit a
brief to the court.
The lawsuit questions the IJniversi

ty's application of Section 21113 of the
California Vehicle Code to issue cita
tions to enforce parking regulations.
The statute in question allows tax
exempt institutions to make regula
tions regarding the operation and
parking of automobiles on its property.
Hoke said he received notification in
March that parking in the space desig
nated tor his Escondido Village apart
ment without a "resident student"
parking permit on his car did not make
him guilty of violating Section 21113.
Exceeding authority
Hoke prepared a brief and submitted
it to the court in December. The deci
sion was made by Louis Quick, then
judge pro fem.
Quick said that by providing hous
ing. the University was acting in an
area outside the traditional University
role.
"If the University engages in the
same activities as profit-making or
ganizations by providing housing, it
should be subject to the same regula
tions as those organizations, which
aren't covered by Section 21113.
That's why 1 didn't apply the statute,"
Quick said.
Hoke conceded that the statute is
necessary to give institutions the au
thority to regulate vehicle traffic in the
interest of public health and safety.
However, he questioned its applica
tion to matters having nothing to do
with public health and safety, such as
tenant parking.
Hoke's brief noted that the statute
omitted public housing facilities.
"In operating Escondido Village,
Stanford is performing a purely pri
vate function and one that should not
be granted the extraordinary powers
contained in Sec. 21113," stated the
brief.
The brief adds, "As a landlord the
University has certain rights, as any
private landlord has. This statute . ..
was not intended to add to the powers
of the University as landlord."
Hoke contends that the University's
first source of remedy should be
landlord-tenant laws, not the use of
police power to enforce regulations
under Section 21113.
Persuasive part
Quick said the persuasive part of the
argument was that the University
could not use police to enforce parking
in the tenant parking area.
"There is an arguable section in the

statute regarding the use of police to
enforce regulations — extending to a
private group the powers of govern
ment," he added.
Quick explained that this decision
does not have the effect of a test case
because it was not appealed.
"It was decided in the lower (munic
ipal) court level, it would need to go to
the appellate level (for it to set a prece
dent)." he said.
Potack explained that the Hoke de
cision would not have an effect on the

USE lawsuit because Hoke's case was
decided on a lower level and also be
cause "most of the people we're repre
senting are not tenants (of the Univer
sity)," he said.
No 'police power'
"Stanford is using the law to give
tickets. We stipulate 21113 doesn't
give (the University) that authority.
The basis of our argument is that (the
University) can't use police power to
enforce private policies." Potack said.
loan Dible, a University librarian,
who helped organize Stanford Com
muters Rebel Against Pay Parking
(SCRAP), said that so far, about 1800
parking tickets had been turned in and
passed on to lawyers handling the USE
lawsuit.
"Action on the tickets is being held
off until after a decision on the law
suit," she said.
According to Michael Hudnall, staff
counsel for the vice president of busi
ness and finance, the USE lawsuit is
not having any effect on the enforce
ment of parking regulations.
USE Public Relations Officer Roger

Hardy said that the USE contract is the
only reason for the continued exis
tence of free parking on campus.
"If not for the fact that it's in our
contract, there wouldn't be any free
parking," he said.
Crucial issue
Hardy stressed that the issue of free
parking for employes would be a cru
cial issue in the next contract negotia
tions.
"We don't believe the University
should charge employes for parking,"
he added.
Hardy also noted that USE members
may be protected from receiving park
ing citations by their contract.
"It may be that (parking) tickets for
USE members are in violation of our
contract. An outside arbiter will de
cide if tickets for USE members are in
violation (of the contract)," he said.
If free parking is part of the new IJSI'
contract, the same benefits will proba
bly be extended to all other Universih
employes, Hardy said.
"It's been the University's practice
in the past, and we expect it will con
tinue. The University extends benefits
we get to other University employes ti
keep other employes from joining th<
union or unionizing," he explained.
