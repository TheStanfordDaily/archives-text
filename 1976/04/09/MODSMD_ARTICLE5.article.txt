# Judge rules on parking citation

### Rosario Delatorre 
A Palo Alto Municipal Court deci
sion which found ASSIJ Senate
Chairman William Hoke not guilty of a
parking violation on campus will have
"no impact at all" on a United Stanford
Employees (USE) lawsuit against the
University for its enforcement of park
ing regulations, according to Richard
Potack, an attorney for USE.
The USE lawsuit is currently under
appeal to the District Court of Appeals
for the State of California, according to
Potack. who is preparing to submit a
brief to the court.
The lawsuit questions the IJniversi

ty's application of Section 21113 of the
California Vehicle Code to issue cita
tions to enforce parking regulations.
The statute in question allows tax
exempt institutions to make regula
tions regarding the operation and
parking of automobiles on its property.
Hoke said he received notification in
March that parking in the space desig
nated tor his Escondido Village apart
ment without a "resident student"
parking permit on his car did not make
him guilty of violating Section 21113.
Exceeding authority
Hoke prepared a brief and submitted
it to the court in December. The deci
sion was made by Louis Quick, then
judge pro fem.
Quick said that by providing hous
ing. the University was acting in an
area outside the traditional University
role.
"If the University engages in the
same activities as profit-making or
ganizations by providing housing, it
should be subject to the same regula
tions as those organizations, which
aren't covered by Section 21113.
That's why 1 didn't apply the statute,"
Quick said.
Hoke conceded that the statute is
necessary to give institutions the au
thority to regulate vehicle traffic in the
interest of public health and safety.
However, he questioned its applica
tion to matters having nothing to do
with public health and safety, such as
tenant parking.
Hoke's brief noted that the statute
omitted public housing facilities.
"In operating Escondido Village,
Stanford is performing a purely pri
vate function and one that should not
be granted the extraordinary powers
contained in Sec. 21113," stated the
brief.
The brief adds, "As a landlord the
University has certain rights, as any
private landlord has. This statute . ..
was not intended to add to the powers
of the University as landlord."
Hoke contends that the University's
first source of remedy should be
landlord-tenant laws, not the use of
police power to enforce regulations
under Section 21113.
Persuasive part
Quick said the persuasive part of the
argument was that the University
could not use police to enforce parking
in the tenant parking area.
"There is an arguable section in the

tions by issuing citations is the subject of a lawsuit now being appealed by
United Stanford Employees (USE) attorneys.
