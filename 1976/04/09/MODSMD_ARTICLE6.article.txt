# Menlo Park wants acreage
## Officials fight land bid 
### Pan Demetrakakes 
University officials have expressed
their opposition to a proposal by
Menlo Park citizens that Menlo Park
acquire 270 acres of University land
for recreational purposes.
The proposal, delivered to the
Menlo Park City Council by a citizen's
committee Tuesday night, suggested
that the city acquire University land on
both sides of Sand Hill Road near the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
The land would be used for a golf
course, tennis courts and various other
recreational facilities.
The citizen's committee suggested
that its purchase and improvements
could be financed through municipal
bonds.
University officials contended that
the committee's assessment of the land
at $3700 an acre was far too low, and
that in any case the sale of the land to
Menlo Park would violate the Univer
sity's land use policy.
Academic purposes
Asked if Stanford would sell the
land if the committee raised its as
sessment. University Land Resources
Manager John Breedlove replied, "I
don't think so, no. The figure being
tossed around is not an appraisal or
anything, just a figure arrived at
somewhere in the city. But that's not
ever been the issue. Stanford needs the
land for its own academic purposes."
Breedlove said that the land is cur
rently being used for grazing cattle,
but that "it's being held in accordance
with University land use policy."

This contradicted statements by
Gordon Tillson, a Menlo Park civil en
gineer who served as chairman of the
citizen's committee. "Our interpreta
tion of the Stanford land use policy,
which is a written document, is that
the land does not have any use at this
time," he said.
To arrive at their assessment of the
land, committee members "got asses
sor values and we discussed it with
people on the committee who had
prior experience in this sort of thing,"
Tillson said.
Legal action?
Asked if Menlo Park plans legal ac
tion to get the property condemned,
Tillson replied, "This is a report to the
council. 1 imagine if anything did
happen there would he public hear
ings and a lot of discussion."
Breedlove said that he didn't know
the legal situation, but commented.
"Their attorneys think they can suc
cessfully condemn the land; ours think
they can successfully defend it."
Nathaniel Brooks, who served as the
resource consultant to the citizen's
committee, was more specific on this
point. "We're not at the point of con
sidering legal action," he said.
"The committee wants to see how it
can be done and be accepted gracefully
by all the parties involved." said
Brooks. "We hope to work from the
standpoint of understanding and
friendly persuasion."
Brooks, vice principal of
Ravenswood High School, said the
