# Petroff slate compelling
## 
### 
The present ASSU election campaign seems
normal enough on the surface. There are the usual
charges, countercharges, pledges and promises,
no doubt received with the usual skepticism.
Many of us are left with the usual difficulty in
finding any good reason for bothering to vote.
This time, however, there is a compelling
reason for voting. The ASSU as an institution is
incapable of functioning in its present form, and
running for the Council of Presidents is a group of
people who are dedicated to transforming it.
Vic Petroff, Carole Houck, Deric Jennings and
A 1 Tomaszczuk are unusually gifted in the talent
and experience they would bring to the ASSU.
Hut they possess as well an understanding of the
present depth of disgust with the ASSU, and they
are committed to fundamental changes in its
structure.
They will begin with thestudent senate, which
in the last several years has proved itself structur
ally incapable of contributing in any meaningful
way to the quality of student life or education at
Stanford.
Constitutional amendment
They have pledged to sponsor a constitutional
amendment which will reorganize the student
senate in two urgently needed directions: linking
the function of each senator with specific substan
tive areas, such as educational programs, admis
sions and student services, which they will be
expected to focus on, and, hopefully, tying the
senators to specific constituencies who can hold
them accountable for what they do and don't do
during their terms.
The senate as debating society will thus die a
merciful death. It will become a much leaner body
of serious people, at work on serious tasks: re
searching issues, developing new programs, and
monitoring the University bureaucracy.
The Petroff slate has pledged as well to over
haul the Nominations Committee, understanding
that the student selections to University commit
tees often have a greater impact on University
policies than almost anything elsethe ASSU does.
They mean to treat these important decisions
with the care and objectivity we are entitled to,

Larry Diamond

and will depoliticize the selection process by em
phasizing substantive criteria, publicized in ad
vance, at the expense of such usual considerations
as seniority and patronage.
Quality of education
Finally, they will focus the energy and re
sources of the ASSU. and their own considerable
organizing skills, on the paramount issue for any
student government — the quality of education.
Their experience and talent uniquely equips them
to make good on their pledges to expand the Lec
ture Notes Service and ASSU Course Guide.
Hut there is another issue which they feel
deeply and will not let rest in the coming year, an
issue which, despite all the recent press it has
been given, has barely been scratched in any fun
damental sense: tenure.
The injustice of paying $6500 a year for teachers
that are unprepared and inaccessible, advisers
that are uninterested and faculty residents that
are never present is manifest. If such disappoint
ing, even embitterng, cases are in the minority, it
is a large enough minority to warrant more ag
gressive attention by the ASSU.
Most complex
But the tenure issue may be the most complex in
the University. There is no easy resolution of the
teaching-research conflict, and little chance of
radical change from a faculty which has grown up
in the system and is so deeply wedded to it.
Any effective student initiative will require a
Council of Presidents with something more than a
commitment to quality education. It will require a
group which works incredibly hard and does its
homework, which can negotiate with the faculty
and administration and gain their respect without
being compromised, and which combines some
daring and imagination with a capacity to coolly
appraise political realities.
The Petroff slate is such a group. Their talents
and sensitivities recommend them to the student
body with special distinction at this moment
when the ASSU is at a potentially crucial turning
point.

and former member of the Council of Presidents.)

with the care and objectivity we are entitled to,

and will depoliticize the selection process by em
phasizing substantive criteria, publicized in ad
vance, at the expense of such usual considerations
as seniority and patronage.
Quality of education
Finally, they will focus the energy and re
sources of the ASSU. and their own considerable
organizing skills, on the paramount issue for any
student government — the quality of education.
Their experience and talent uniquely equips them
to make good on their pledges to expand the Lec
ture Notes Service and ASSU Course Guide.
Hut there is another issue which they feel
deeply and will not let rest in the coming year, an
issue which, despite all the recent press it has
been given, has barely been scratched in any fun
damental sense: tenure.
The injustice of paying $6500 a year for teachers
that are unprepared and inaccessible, advisers
that are uninterested and faculty residents that
are never present is manifest. If such disappoint
ing, even embitterng, cases are in the minority, it
is a large enough minority to warrant more ag
gressive attention by the ASSU.
Most complex
But the tenure issue may be the most complex in
the University. There is no easy resolution of the
teaching-research conflict, and little chance of
radical change from a faculty which has grown up
in the system and is so deeply wedded to it.
Any effective student initiative will require a
Council of Presidents with something more than a
commitment to quality education. It will require a
group which works incredibly hard and does its
homework, which can negotiate with the faculty
and administration and gain their respect without
being compromised, and which combines some
daring and imagination with a capacity to coolly
appraise political realities.
The Petroff slate is such a group. Their talents
and sensitivities recommend them to the student
body with special distinction at this moment
when the ASSU is at a potentially crucial turning
point.
(Larry Diamond is a graduate student in sociology
and former member of the Council of Presidents.)
The present ASSU election campaign seems
normal enough on the surface. There are the usual
charges, countercharges, pledges and promises,
no doubt received with the usual skepticism.
Many of us are left with the usual difficulty in
finding any good reason for bothering to vote.
This time, however, there is a compelling
reason for voting. The ASSU as an institution is
incapable of functioning in its present form, and
running for the Council of Presidents is a group of
people who are dedicated to transforming it.
Vic Petroff, Carole Houck, Deric Jennings and
A 1 Tomaszczuk are unusually gifted in the talent
and experience they would bring to the ASSU.
Hut they possess as well an understanding of the
present depth of disgust with the ASSU, and they
are committed to fundamental changes in its
structure.
They will begin with thestudent senate, which
in the last several years has proved itself structur
ally incapable of contributing in any meaningful
way to the quality of student life or education at
Stanford.
Constitutional amendment
They have pledged to sponsor a constitutional
amendment which will reorganize the student
senate in two urgently needed directions: linking
the function of each senator with specific substan
tive areas, such as educational programs, admis
sions and student services, which they will be
expected to focus on, and, hopefully, tying the
senators to specific constituencies who can hold
them accountable for what they do and don't do
during their terms.
The senate as debating society will thus die a
merciful death. It will become a much leaner body
of serious people, at work on serious tasks: re
searching issues, developing new programs, and
monitoring the University bureaucracy.
The Petroff slate has pledged as well to over
haul the Nominations Committee, understanding
that the student selections to University commit
tees often have a greater impact on University
policies than almost anything elsethe ASSU does.
