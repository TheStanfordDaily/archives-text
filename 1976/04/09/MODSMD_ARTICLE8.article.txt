# Letters: Howard, art

Political scene
Having recently attained "old
fart" (alumnus) status after a
number of years of pseudo
education at Stanford and
pseudo-politics with the ASSU, 1
feel that the time has come for
me to engage in the old fart cus
tom of commenting on the cur
rent political scene.
First, the bad news. It seems
that there is still a prevailing no
tion that the best way to support
someone for the Council of Pres
idents is to belittle his oppo
nents. The April 6 letter in the
Daily which said all sorts of nas
ties about Vic Petroff was the
perfect example.
First of all. his attendance re
cord was much better than every
third meeting, and he did not
walk out of a senate meeting, as
far as 1 recall.
Second, and much more im
portant, these kinds of negative
statements simply provide no
basis upon which to decide how
to vote. It's tantamount to saying
that we're trying to choose the
best of a bunch of real losers —
not a very positive or rational
approach.
And now, the good news. I re
ally feel that a great deal of good
can and will come from the elec
tion of Dan Howard's slate to the
Council of Presidents.
They have set important and
reasonable goals designed to
focus their efforts on the key
problems of student government
— lack of continuity, lack of
coordination and lack of effec
tive communication between
students and their government.
They have also come up with
some very workable programs to

achieve these goals of con
tinuity, coordination and com
munication. For example, their
proposed COP committees on
key issues that recur year after
year (i.e., housing, tuition, te
nure decision) would help in
troduce long term planning and
continuity into the traditionally
sporadic efforts of past COPs to
deal with these problems.
And frankly, the Howard slate
is composed of four sincere,
committed individuals who will
maintain close contact with the
student body, reasonable rela
tions with administrators, and a
high level of energy in their
plans and efforts to create a re
sponsive and responsible stu
dent government.
Take the time to read and
think about their newsletter de
scribing their platform — there's
a lot to it that is rational and at
tainable. And please give them
the positive support they will
need during and especially after
the election.

Legalistic sophistry
Richard Fearon's article in the
Daily April 6 in which he denied
the integrity of an artist's work
was a disconcerting example of a
legalistic sophistry to which I
take strong exception.
The fact that art is highly sub
jective and no more legally de
finable than pornography does
not mean that its legal protection
should be so callously dismissed
as "insuperably difficult" and
undesirable.
The legal owner of a work,
even in this extraordinarily

materialistic society, should not
have the right to amend or de
stroy art just because Fearon
can't define it.
The comparison between
Jackson Pollock's workand aGM
car is also outrageous. Here,
Fearon forgets the highly indi
vidual nature of art. Both the
creator and the viewer of a piece
of art must invest elements of
their individuality and under
standing in order for the work to
have meaning.
The similarity that exists bet
ween two CM cars is missing
from any two consecutive
Beethoven symphonies or piano
solos by Keith Jarret.
If you degrade art as being a
mere "product of society" no
more important than concrete
and credit cards, then your soci
ety is not fully civilized. Without
art we're a motley horde of
cavemen with computers.
An example of a current soci
ety that does, in fact, view art as
product is Soviet Russia, from
whose subsidized art factories
little of value has emerged since
the revolution.
Humanity does not transcend
itself through an IBM computer
as it does through da Vinci and
Stravinsky. Therefore no one has
or ever will have the moral right
to destroy a work of art because
we can't formulate a legal defini
tion with which to protect it.
To be facetious: the bound
aries of art can best be defined as
undefinable and imaginary. If it
could be defined, it could be re
produced, and its very individu
ality is the reason it must be pro
tected and nurtured.

Having recently attained "old
fart" (alumnus) status after a
number of years of pseudo
education at Stanford and
pseudo-politics with the ASSU, 1
feel that the time has come for
me to engage in the old fart cus
tom of commenting on the cur
rent political scene.
First, the bad news. It seems
that there is still a prevailing no
tion that the best way to support
someone for the Council of Pres
idents is to belittle his oppo
nents. The April 6 letter in the
Daily which said all sorts of nas
ties about Vic Petroff was the
perfect example.
First of all. his attendance re
cord was much better than every
third meeting, and he did not
walk out of a senate meeting, as
far as 1 recall.
Second, and much more im
portant, these kinds of negative
statements simply provide no
basis upon which to decide how
to vote. It's tantamount to saying
that we're trying to choose the
best of a bunch of real losers —
not a very positive or rational
approach.
And now, the good news. I re
ally feel that a great deal of good
can and will come from the elec
tion of Dan Howard's slate to the
Council of Presidents.
They have set important and
reasonable goals designed to
focus their efforts on the key
problems of student government
— lack of continuity, lack of
coordination and lack of effec
tive communication between
students and their government.
They have also come up with
some very workable programs to

achieve these goals of con
tinuity, coordination and com
munication. For example, their
proposed COP committees on
key issues that recur year after
year (i.e., housing, tuition, te
nure decision) would help in
troduce long term planning and
continuity into the traditionally
sporadic efforts of past COPs to
deal with these problems.
And frankly, the Howard slate
is composed of four sincere,
committed individuals who will
maintain close contact with the
student body, reasonable rela
tions with administrators, and a
high level of energy in their
plans and efforts to create a re
sponsive and responsible stu
dent government.
Take the time to read and
think about their newsletter de
scribing their platform — there's
a lot to it that is rational and at
tainable. And please give them
the positive support they will
need during and especially after
the election.

Legalistic sophistry
Richard Fearon's article in the
Daily April 6 in which he denied
the integrity of an artist's work
was a disconcerting example of a
legalistic sophistry to which I
take strong exception.
The fact that art is highly sub
jective and no more legally de
finable than pornography does
not mean that its legal protection
should be so callously dismissed
as "insuperably difficult" and
undesirable.
The legal owner of a work,
even in this extraordinarily

materialistic society, should not
have the right to amend or de
stroy art just because Fearon
can't define it.
The comparison between
Jackson Pollock's workand aGM
car is also outrageous. Here,
Fearon forgets the highly indi
vidual nature of art. Both the
creator and the viewer of a piece
of art must invest elements of
their individuality and under
standing in order for the work to
have meaning.
The similarity that exists bet
ween two CM cars is missing
from any two consecutive
Beethoven symphonies or piano
solos by Keith Jarret.
If you degrade art as being a
mere "product of society" no
more important than concrete
and credit cards, then your soci
ety is not fully civilized. Without
art we're a motley horde of
cavemen with computers.
An example of a current soci
ety that does, in fact, view art as
product is Soviet Russia, from
whose subsidized art factories
little of value has emerged since
the revolution.
Humanity does not transcend
itself through an IBM computer
as it does through da Vinci and
Stravinsky. Therefore no one has
or ever will have the moral right
to destroy a work of art because
we can't formulate a legal defini
tion with which to protect it.
To be facetious: the bound
aries of art can best be defined as
undefinable and imaginary. If it
could be defined, it could be re
produced, and its very individu
ality is the reason it must be pro
tected and nurtured.
