Amdahl Corporation has already met Dr. Gene
Amdahl's commitment to develop and deliver the
world's first large-scale, fourth generation,
computer system. And as a young company with
a small group of very talented people, we will
continue to need very special individuals.
If you're a talented individual who wants to
meet the challenges of tomorrow's computers,
we would like to talk with you.
You could be working with the Amdahl 470V/6
and other systems as an Engineer in Diagnostics,
Computer Development, Systems Test or
Design Automation. If you have or are about
to receive a BSEE, CS or advanced degree
look for Amdahl Corporation on Campus.
