# Printing division to shut down
## 
### Bill Sing 
The University has made a final de
cision to close the printing division of
the Stanford Press by Sept. 30. This
will result in the eventual layoff of
about 40 press workers.
As yet no definite timetable has been
set for the phasing-out of printing op
erations, according to University chief
counsel for employe relations Douglas
Barton, but efforts are being made by
the University to relocate laid-off
employes in other University or non-
University jobs.
The principle reason for the shut
down, according to Barton, is the de
clining amount of use of the facility,
making it financially impractical for
the University to invest the estimated
$1 million needed for renovation of the
antiquated equipment.
Five union locals are involved in the
press shutdown, including the United
Stanford Employees (USE). The four
printing trades unions involved are
the Western Graphic Arts Union No.
14, Graphic Arts International Locals
280 and 3-B, and Bay Area Typog
raphical Union No. 21.
A final decision from Vice President
for Business and Finance Robert Au
gsburger and President Richard
Lyman had been expected on or before
April 5, according to Barton. He said
the decision had been delayed until
last Thursday, one day before the
meeting, so that the University could
receive and review a formal termina
tion agreement proposal from the un
ions.
Preliminary meeting
Barton said that he and other Uni
versity officials had a "preliminary
meeting" with representatives of the
four printing trades unions last Friday
to discuss the proposals.
"We gave the unions our proposal
for severance pay arrangements," said
Barton, "but we were not prepared to
discuss complete details in the union's
proposal because we had no time to do
our homework."

The union's termination agreement
proposal was submitted to the Univer
sity last Thursday.
Union officials, however, were not
completely satisfied with the progress
made at the meeting.
"They did present us with a sever
ance pay package, but this didn't ad
dress itself to the whole problem," said
Bob Saucedo, business manager of
Graphic Arts International Local 3-B.
"There are other things equally as im
portant to consider, such as extended
sick pay benefits and health and wel
fare coverage."
Saucedo said many of the workers
have been there as long as 30 years,
and "it will be hard to relocate them
elsewhere."
"We were bothered by the Universi
ty's attitude, but not surprised," said
Morris Goldman, first vice president of
the Bay Area Typographical Local 21.
"They figured that coming up with
some dollars and cents figures for
severance pay would solve all the
problems. Dollars and cents are inhu
man in the sense that we're dealing
with people who have been working
there for 20 to 30 years."
"The University is not going to be
able to place these workers in other
jobs overnight," said Vincent Pas
sanisi, recording and financial secret
ary for Graphics Arts International
Local 280. "In the meantime these
workers will need medical and other
benefits in addition to severance pay
while they are unemployed."
Union proposals
Bill Britton, secretary-treasurer of
Western Graphics Arts No. 14, said
that union proposals include a guaran
tee of other University jobs for laid-off
workers, continuance of health and
welfare coverage, supplemental sick
pay after job termination, paid vaca
tion arrangements, payment of possi
ble retraining expenses and extension
of the tuition plan for employes' chil
dren who attend Stanford.

The University has made a final de
cision to close the printing division of
the Stanford Press by Sept. 30. This
will result in the eventual layoff of
about 40 press workers.
As yet no definite timetable has been
set for the phasing-out of printing op
erations, according to University chief
counsel for employe relations Douglas
Barton, but efforts are being made by
the University to relocate laid-off
employes in other University or non-
University jobs.
The principle reason for the shut
down, according to Barton, is the de
clining amount of use of the facility,
making it financially impractical for
the University to invest the estimated
$1 million needed for renovation of the
antiquated equipment.
Five union locals are involved in the
press shutdown, including the United
Stanford Employees (USE). The four
printing trades unions involved are
the Western Graphic Arts Union No.
14, Graphic Arts International Locals
280 and 3-B, and Bay Area Typog
raphical Union No. 21.
A final decision from Vice President
for Business and Finance Robert Au
gsburger and President Richard
Lyman had been expected on or before
April 5, according to Barton. He said
the decision had been delayed until
last Thursday, one day before the
meeting, so that the University could
receive and review a formal termina
tion agreement proposal from the un
ions.
Preliminary meeting
Barton said that he and other Uni
versity officials had a "preliminary
meeting" with representatives of the
four printing trades unions last Friday
to discuss the proposals.
"We gave the unions our proposal
for severance pay arrangements," said
Barton, "but we were not prepared to
discuss complete details in the union's
proposal because we had no time to do
our homework."

The union's termination agreement
proposal was submitted to the Univer
sity last Thursday.
Union officials, however, were not
completely satisfied with the progress
made at the meeting.
"They did present us with a sever
ance pay package, but this didn't ad
dress itself to the whole problem," said
Bob Saucedo, business manager of
Graphic Arts International Local 3-B.
"There are other things equally as im
portant to consider, such as extended
sick pay benefits and health and wel
fare coverage."
Saucedo said many of the workers
have been there as long as 30 years,
and "it will be hard to relocate them
elsewhere."
"We were bothered by the Universi
ty's attitude, but not surprised," said
Morris Goldman, first vice president of
the Bay Area Typographical Local 21.
"They figured that coming up with
some dollars and cents figures for
severance pay would solve all the
problems. Dollars and cents are inhu
man in the sense that we're dealing
with people who have been working
there for 20 to 30 years."
"The University is not going to be
able to place these workers in other
jobs overnight," said Vincent Pas
sanisi, recording and financial secret
ary for Graphics Arts International
Local 280. "In the meantime these
workers will need medical and other
benefits in addition to severance pay
while they are unemployed."
