# Hoover research leans to right
## 
### 
Much of the campus lies within the
shadow of the towering Hoover Institution.
Increasingly, much of the world may lie in
the shadow of its bias.
Hoover's director, Wesley Glenn
Campbell, staunchly maintains that
Hoover's research is balanced. That is true
only insofar as there is balance between
conservative-libertarian economic theory
and conservative-interventionist foreign
policy.
As an introduction to the Hoover view of
the world, we might look at some material
recently published in the Daily.
Senior Fellow Lewis Gann argued on
March 31 that he would support the ap
pointment of Angela Davis as an ASSU
Guest Professor only if she might help him
secure a teaching post in East Germany so
he could espouse anti-communist doc
trines. Gann's position might be described
as "balance of terror academic freedom."
Senior Research Fellow Edward Teller,
the "father of the H-bomb," recently spoke
out in favor of his children and grandchil
dren.
Remain undeveloped
Teller's argument in opposing the Nu
clear Safeguards Initiative was that without
nuclear power, poor nations would remain
undeveloped forever. This is one of the
weaker arguments on either side of the is
sue, and was well refuted by Asst. Radiol
ogy Prof. J. Martin Brown in a letter last
Monday.
Senior Fellow Tibor Machan made his
views clear in a lucid column on March 11.
Machan, who previously defended stress
and alienation necessary parts of student
life, said that uftder pure capitalism, "Each
individual, in voluntary company with
others must choose and can choose, to pur
sue excellence in life."
Machan's conclusion was this: "So what
is lovelier than capitalism? Only some idle

wish, perhaps."
While such libertarian views may have
merit, Hoover's entire domestic studies
program seems designed to confirm them.
Like Brookings
Senior Fellow Thomas Moore, director of
the domestic studies program, hinted at this
in an article last fall. According to the arti
cle, Moore, who calls himself a libertarian,

"believes the institution's frequently con
servative viewpoints are already having
some influence on government
attitudes ... He hopes to see the institution
play a role similar to that held by the Brook
ings Institute in the '605."
Campbell is quick to deny that Hoover is
about to become Brookings-of-the-right.
But it is impossible to deny that Hoover's
major domestic theme is government's ex
cessive influence on American society.
Moore's studies oppose transportation reg
ulation; Roger Freeman argues that the gov
ernment spends too much money on domes
tic programs; Senior Fellow Rita Ricardo
Campbell argues against national health
care and food safety regulations.
The preceding analyses have ignored the
policies of Hoover's most famous honorary
fellows: Ronald Reagan, Aleksandr Sol
zhenitsyn and last year's "distinguished
visitor," Nobel Prize-winning economist
F.A. Hayek.
Hayek is a distinguished defender of the

free market who believes that depression
results from the artificial expansion of
government-propped bank credit. While
there is nothing inherently evil in this posi
tion, it does tend to reaffirm the
general Hoover view of the world.
Solzhenitsyn, since coming to the United
States, has constantly opposed detente. He
believes that the United States is a leading
force against the evils of communism â€” but
that this country has lost its will.
He has profoundly influenced the
thought of the New York Times and other
liberal media.
Reagan's influence has been more direct.
His challenge has moved the Ford
administration to threats against Cuba and
continued promises of exploitation in
Panama.
Abandon nationality
Reagan's views directly caused the Un
ited States to abandon the beginning of a
rational foreign policy of non-intervention
in international affairs and of an end of im
perialism.
There is nothing per se wrong with hav
ing as fellows persons who favor im
perialism, as Hoover does. But the institu
tion is so weighted to the right that it does
justice to the words of Herbert Hoover: "The
purpose of this Institution must be by its
research and publications, to demonstrate
the evils of the doctrines of Karl Marx,
whether communism, socialism, economic
materialism, or atheism."
As more and more of the world drifts to
ward variants of Marxism, the biased
perspective of Hoover, when coupled with
the institution's growing influence, pre
sents a danger to world harmony.
The rightward-leaning tower of Hoover
must be straightened, or it runs the risk of
becoming only a dangerous anachronism.
