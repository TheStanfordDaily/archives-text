# Letters: COP election, support Jones
## 
### 
Howard slate capable
At a time when so many others
are making known their views
on the upcoming Council of
Presidents (COP) elections, I too
would like to say my piece.
Before I go any further, 1 will
admit quite frankly that I am
biased in favor of the Howard
slate. However, this bias is not
based on blind prejudice, but on
a healthy respect for their indi
vidual capabilities.
While I may not agree with all
the conclusions of the Howard
report, 1 admire the energy, the
thoroughness and the persever
ance that went into researching
and writing it.
Keith Archuleta has compiled

an excellent record of active ser
vice to the black community at
Stanford. In addition, he brings
in the "new blood" we need in
the ASSU.
Despite a year in ASSU poli
tics, Bill Tyndall has not become
completely disillusioned. Actu
ally, he is perhaps the most ac
tive senator in following up on
resolutions and educating him
self and the rest of the senate on
current issues.
Liz Ryll has yet to make a
splash on the political scene, but
her astute comments during se
nate debates are clear indica
tions of her interest and compe
tence. Moreover, she will contri
bute an original point of view,
both as a newcomer and a

graduate student.
But the most important asset
of the Howard slate is its wil
lingness to assert itself within
the system, or outside
it if need be. For all these
reasons and more, the Howard
slate has my support.
Sarah Alfadl
ASSU senator 75-76
Elect Jones slate
In my four years at Stanford. 1
have become increasingly aware
that the quality of student life
depends in large measure on the
quantity and quality of activities
which students themselves in
itiate and organize. My work
with the Stanford Quad and as

Pub Board chairman has con
vinced me of that.
That is why 1 endorse the slate
of Scott Jones, Shelly Williams,
Ahmed Calvo and Chris Gutier
rez for senior class officers. I
have worked under Jones on the
Student Development Commit
tee, the fund-raising functions of
which have brought Jones into
close contact with both alumni
and administration.
His performance as director of
the Aqua Follies and as social
and rush chairman at Sigma Chi
show that he can organize and
successfully follow through on
projects that he initiates.
He has managed all of this in
addition to working on an en
gineering major and being a

member of the track team.
Williams has been closely in
volved with the staff of the
Chaparral and worked with
Jones on the Aqua Follies. She
has also organized social events
at Manzanita Park.
Although I haven't been as
closely involved with Calvo and
Gutierrez as with Jones and Wil
liams, I am convinced that all of
the members of the slate are
well organized and interested in
creating a senior class program
that will be both fun and con
structive and that will maximize
both student participation and
student services.

an excellent record of active ser
vice to the black community at
Stanford. In addition, he brings
in the "new blood" we need in
the ASSU.
Despite a year in ASSU poli
tics, Bill Tyndall has not become
completely disillusioned. Actu
ally, he is perhaps the most ac
tive senator in following up on
resolutions and educating him
self and the rest of the senate on
current issues.
Liz Ryll has yet to make a
splash on the political scene, but
her astute comments during se
nate debates are clear indica
tions of her interest and compe
tence. Moreover, she will contri
bute an original point of view,
both as a newcomer and a

graduate student.
But the most important asset
of the Howard slate is its wil
lingness to assert itself within
the system, or outside
it if need be. For all these
reasons and more, the Howard
slate has my support.
Sarah Alfadl
ASSU senator 75-76
Elect Jones slate
In my four years at Stanford. 1
have become increasingly aware
that the quality of student life
depends in large measure on the
quantity and quality of activities
which students themselves in
itiate and organize. My work
with the Stanford Quad and as

Pub Board chairman has con
vinced me of that.
That is why 1 endorse the slate
of Scott Jones, Shelly Williams,
Ahmed Calvo and Chris Gutier
rez for senior class officers. I
have worked under Jones on the
Student Development Commit
tee, the fund-raising functions of
which have brought Jones into
close contact with both alumni
and administration.
His performance as director of
the Aqua Follies and as social
and rush chairman at Sigma Chi
show that he can organize and
successfully follow through on
projects that he initiates.
He has managed all of this in
addition to working on an en
gineering major and being a

member of the track team.
Williams has been closely in
volved with the staff of the
Chaparral and worked with
Jones on the Aqua Follies. She
has also organized social events
at Manzanita Park.
Although I haven't been as
closely involved with Calvo and
Gutierrez as with Jones and Wil
liams, I am convinced that all of
the members of the slate are
well organized and interested in
creating a senior class program
that will be both fun and con
structive and that will maximize
both student participation and
student services.

At a time when so many others
are making known their views
on the upcoming Council of
Presidents (COP) elections, I too
would like to say my piece.
Before I go any further, 1 will
admit quite frankly that I am
biased in favor of the Howard
slate. However, this bias is not
based on blind prejudice, but on
a healthy respect for their indi
vidual capabilities.
While I may not agree with all
the conclusions of the Howard
report, 1 admire the energy, the
thoroughness and the persever
ance that went into researching
and writing it.
