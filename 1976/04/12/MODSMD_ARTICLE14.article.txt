# Identical twins accustomed to constant questions
## 
### Lyn Carlson 
We know what happened to
The Bobbsey Twins at Big Bear
Pond. We know what happened
to The Bohbsey Twins at Pil
grim. We know what happened
to The Bobbsey Twins at
Lakeport. They all lived happily
ever after.
But what happens to the
Bobbsey Twins at Stanford? Or,
to put it a bit more empirically,
what's it like to be an identical
twin at Stanford?
The standard Bobbsey Twin
questions that are uttered by
ogling acquaintances in the di
ning hall are not appreciated.
The least favorite is the bril
liantly perceptive exclamation
(1) "Oh, you must be twins!"
Following that exclamation is
the question (2) "What's it like to
be a twin?" This was attacked by
one twin, who said "that's a
ridiculous question, because I've
never been anything but a twin.
If someone asked you "what's it
like nut to be a twin?" how
would you answer? You've
never been a twin."
The rest of the questions in
clude the following: (3) "Stand
next to each other and let me see

if I can tell you apart." (4) "Oh,
you guys aren't hard to tell
apart!" (5) "You guys are identi
cal (a brilliant remark to say to
identical twins)!" (6) "Can your
boyfriends/girlfriends tell the
difference?" (7) "Did you ever
forget which one you were when
you were little?"
Same questions
But one twin took a sighing yet
sympathetic view of this
xeroxed list of questions, "No, I
don't get tired of it. I would ask
the same questions if I saw
twins."
Upon seeing twins for the first
time, the immediately apparent
similarity or difference is their
dress. The only pair interviewed
that dress alike are Renee and
Ramona Rolle.
"We've dressed alike since we
were born, but were never forced
to dress alike."
On the opposite end oi :he clo
thing spectrum are }im and Ken
Favaro, whose parents "never
dressed us the same. They never
felt it was necessary or even
cute."
Somewhere in the middle of
the spectrum lie the closets of
Kathy and Kristy Herrera, who

don't dress the same, but who
share (or, as Kathy put it. "steal")
from each other's closets all the
time.
A less readily apparent simi
larity or difference is the matter
of a major. Surprisingly, all the
twins were in closely related
majors. Two sets were both
human biology majors, and the
other two sets were in different
types of engineering.
Same classes
As a consequence of being in
similar majors, they have at time

had the same classes. One of
them said, upon discovering she
was in the same class with her
twin, "at first we sat on opposite
sides of the auditorium." The
Favaros have extended this ten
dency to separate so that it
applies not only to where to sit in
the auditorium, but to their en
tire class schedule: "We haven't
had a class together yet."
But the Rolles have come into
many an auditorium together for
classes: "All of our classes are
similar, which aids in study

ing." Renee interjects that "we
don't get the same grades,
though — I usually come out on
the bad end."
The final academically
related matter is that of housing.
Their housing situations vary
widely, and with it, their reasons
for living together'or apart. One
set lives in the same dorm,
another in the same trailer,
another in different houses, and
another in a fraternity and a
house.
The reasons for these together

or apart housing situations range
from the practical ("Our housing
had to be the same because we
own many things in common.")
to the philosophical ("1 think it's
good we're not living in the same
houses.").
Other similarities
A not-so-trivial area is that of
friendships. One set of twins de
clares that "we have the same
friends." Another set echoes
this, but tacks a qualifier onto the
end: "We have the same friends
— almost." Still another set
sounds from the opposite side
that "we had the same friends
until we came here."
All these similarities com
pounded together may account
for the unusual degree of unspo
ken communication all the twins
experience. They relate that "our
reactions to things are the
same ... we say the same things
at the same time . . . our parents
get lost in our conversa
tion ...the great thing about
being a twin is that you can talk
without thinking about it . . . we
think the same . . . I'm very sen
sitive to her moods . . . once in a
while we'll come out with a sen
tence together."

Why did they decide to come
to Stanford together in the first
place? When you embark on the
"grand tour off to college," you
usually leave behind your teddy
bear, Mom's chocolate chip
cookies and any extraneous
twins that have attached them
selves to you along the way.
Jim Favaro voiced this unspo
ken sentiment. "Sometimes 1 get
the feeling that people think it's
not quite noble to have us here
together." Judging from the
number of twins admitted, it ap
pears that someone in the admis
sions office thinks it's noble to
have twins here together.
The twins pondered this ques
tion; some said that "we
thought one might be accepted
and the other one rejected,"
while another said "our records
were very close — GPAs and test
scores. We didn't know for what
reason they would accept one
and not the other."
Perhaps that's what the twins
wish it would be like to be an
identical twin at Stanford — that
the policy of considering them
as individuals that got them ad
mitted would continue through
the rest of their years here.

xeroxed list of questions, "No, I
don't get tired of it. I would ask
the same questions if I saw
twins."
Upon seeing twins for the first
time, the immediately apparent
similarity or difference is their
dress. The only pair interviewed
that dress alike are Renee and
Ramona Rolle.
"We've dressed alike since we
were born, but were never forced
to dress alike."
On the opposite end oi :he clo
thing spectrum are }im and Ken
Favaro, whose parents "never
dressed us the same. They never
felt it was necessary or even
cute."
Somewhere in the middle of
the spectrum lie the closets of
Kathy and Kristy Herrera, who

don't dress the same, but who
share (or, as Kathy put it. "steal")
from each other's closets all the
time.
A less readily apparent simi
larity or difference is the matter
of a major. Surprisingly, all the
twins were in closely related
majors. Two sets were both
human biology majors, and the
other two sets were in different
types of engineering.
Same classes
As a consequence of being in
similar majors, they have at time

had the same classes. One of
them said, upon discovering she
was in the same class with her
twin, "at first we sat on opposite
sides of the auditorium." The
Favaros have extended this ten
dency to separate so that it
applies not only to where to sit in
the auditorium, but to their en
tire class schedule: "We haven't
had a class together yet."
But the Rolles have come into
many an auditorium together for
classes: "All of our classes are
similar, which aids in study

ing." Renee interjects that "we
don't get the same grades,
though — I usually come out on
the bad end."
The final academically
related matter is that of housing.
Their housing situations vary
widely, and with it, their reasons
for living together'or apart. One
set lives in the same dorm,
another in the same trailer,
another in different houses, and
another in a fraternity and a
house.
The reasons for these together

or apart housing situations range
from the practical ("Our housing
had to be the same because we
own many things in common.")
to the philosophical ("1 think it's
good we're not living in the same
houses.").
Other similarities
A not-so-trivial area is that of
friendships. One set of twins de
clares that "we have the same
friends." Another set echoes
this, but tacks a qualifier onto the
end: "We have the same friends
— almost." Still another set
sounds from the opposite side
that "we had the same friends
until we came here."
All these similarities com
pounded together may account
for the unusual degree of unspo
ken communication all the twins
experience. They relate that "our
reactions to things are the
same ... we say the same things
at the same time . . . our parents
get lost in our conversa
tion ...the great thing about
being a twin is that you can talk
without thinking about it . . . we
think the same . . . I'm very sen
sitive to her moods . . . once in a
while we'll come out with a sen
tence together."

Why did they decide to come
to Stanford together in the first
place? When you embark on the
"grand tour off to college," you
usually leave behind your teddy
bear, Mom's chocolate chip
cookies and any extraneous
twins that have attached them
selves to you along the way.
Jim Favaro voiced this unspo
ken sentiment. "Sometimes 1 get
the feeling that people think it's
not quite noble to have us here
together." Judging from the
number of twins admitted, it ap
pears that someone in the admis
sions office thinks it's noble to
have twins here together.
The twins pondered this ques
tion; some said that "we
thought one might be accepted
and the other one rejected,"
while another said "our records
were very close — GPAs and test
scores. We didn't know for what
reason they would accept one
and not the other."
Perhaps that's what the twins
wish it would be like to be an
identical twin at Stanford — that
the policy of considering them
as individuals that got them ad
mitted would continue through
the rest of their years here.

We know what happened to
The Bobbsey Twins at Big Bear
Pond. We know what happened
to The Bohbsey Twins at Pil
grim. We know what happened
to The Bobbsey Twins at
Lakeport. They all lived happily
ever after.
But what happens to the
Bobbsey Twins at Stanford? Or,
to put it a bit more empirically,
what's it like to be an identical
twin at Stanford?
The standard Bobbsey Twin
questions that are uttered by
ogling acquaintances in the di

The least favorite is the bril

(1) "Oh, you must be twins!"
Following that exclamation is
the question (2) "What's it like to
be a twin?" This was attacked by
one twin, who said "that's a
ridiculous question, because I've
never been anything but a twin.
If someone asked you "what's it
like nut to be a twin?" how
would you answer? You've
never been a twin."
The rest of the questions in
clude the following: (3) "Stand
next to each other and let me see

if I can tell you apart." (4) "Oh,
you guys aren't hard to tell
apart!" (5) "You guys are identi
cal (a brilliant remark to say to
identical twins)!" (6) "Can your
boyfriends/girlfriends tell the
difference?" (7) "Did you ever
forget which one you were when
you were little?"

classes: "All of our classes are
similar, which aids in study

ing." Renee interjects that "we
don't get the same grades,
though — I usually come out on
the bad end."
The final academically
related matter is that of housing.
Their housing situations vary
widely, and with it, their reasons
for living together'or apart. One
set lives in the same dorm,
another in the same trailer,
another in different houses, and
another in a fraternity and a
house.
The reasons for these together

or apart housing situations range
from the practical ("Our housing
had to be the same because we
own many things in common.")
to the philosophical ("1 think it's
good we're not living in the same
houses.").
Other similarities
A not-so-trivial area is that of
friendships. One set of twins de
clares that "we have the same
friends." Another set echoes
this, but tacks a qualifier onto the
end: "We have the same friends
— almost." Still another set
sounds from the opposite side
that "we had the same friends
until we came here."
All these similarities com
pounded together may account
for the unusual degree of unspo
ken communication all the twins
experience. They relate that "our
reactions to things are the
same ... we say the same things
at the same time . . . our parents
get lost in our conversa
tion ...the great thing about
being a twin is that you can talk
without thinking about it . . . we
think the same . . . I'm very sen
sitive to her moods . . . once in a
while we'll come out with a sen
tence together."

Why did they decide to come
to Stanford together in the first
place? When you embark on the
"grand tour off to college," you
usually leave behind your teddy
bear, Mom's chocolate chip
cookies and any extraneous
twins that have attached them
selves to you along the way.
Jim Favaro voiced this unspo
ken sentiment. "Sometimes 1 get
the feeling that people think it's
not quite noble to have us here
together." Judging from the
number of twins admitted, it ap
pears that someone in the admis
sions office thinks it's noble to
have twins here together.
The twins pondered this ques
tion; some said that "we
thought one might be accepted
and the other one rejected,"
while another said "our records
were very close — GPAs and test
scores. We didn't know for what
reason they would accept one
and not the other."
Perhaps that's what the twins
wish it would be like to be an
identical twin at Stanford — that
the policy of considering them
as individuals that got them ad
mitted would continue through
the rest of their years here.

We know what happened to
The Bobbsey Twins at Big Bear
Pond. We know what happened
to The Bohbsey Twins at Pil
grim. We know what happened
to The Bobbsey Twins at
Lakeport. They all lived happily
ever after.
But what happens to the
Bobbsey Twins at Stanford? Or,
to put it a bit more empirically,
what's it like to be an identical
twin at Stanford?
The standard Bobbsey Twin
questions that are uttered by
ogling acquaintances in the di
ning hall are not appreciated.
The least favorite is the bril
liantly perceptive exclamation
(1) "Oh, you must be twins!"
Following that exclamation is
the question (2) "What's it like to
be a twin?" This was attacked by
one twin, who said "that's a
ridiculous question, because I've
never been anything but a twin.
If someone asked you "what's it
like nut to be a twin?" how
would you answer? You've
never been a twin."
The rest of the questions in
clude the following: (3) "Stand
next to each other and let me see

if I can tell you apart." (4) "Oh,
you guys aren't hard to tell
apart!" (5) "You guys are identi
cal (a brilliant remark to say to
identical twins)!" (6) "Can your
boyfriends/girlfriends tell the
difference?" (7) "Did you ever
forget which one you were when
you were little?"
Same questions
But one twin took a sighing yet
sympathetic view of this
xeroxed list of questions, "No, I
don't get tired of it. I would ask
the same questions if I saw
twins."
Upon seeing twins for the first
time, the immediately apparent
similarity or difference is their
dress. The only pair interviewed
that dress alike are Renee and
Ramona Rolle.
"We've dressed alike since we
were born, but were never forced
to dress alike."
On the opposite end oi :he clo
thing spectrum are }im and Ken
Favaro, whose parents "never
dressed us the same. They never
felt it was necessary or even
cute."
Somewhere in the middle of
the spectrum lie the closets of
Kathy and Kristy Herrera, who

don't dress the same, but who
share (or, as Kathy put it. "steal")
from each other's closets all the
time.
A less readily apparent simi
larity or difference is the matter
of a major. Surprisingly, all the
twins were in closely related
majors. Two sets were both
human biology majors, and the
other two sets were in different
types of engineering.
Same classes
As a consequence of being in
similar majors, they have at time

had the same classes. One of
them said, upon discovering she
was in the same class with her
twin, "at first we sat on opposite
sides of the auditorium." The
Favaros have extended this ten
dency to separate so that it
applies not only to where to sit in
the auditorium, but to their en
tire class schedule: "We haven't
had a class together yet."
But the Rolles have come into
many an auditorium together for
classes: "All of our classes are
similar, which aids in study

ing." Renee interjects that "we
don't get the same grades,
though — I usually come out on
