# Disease program to be initiated
## 
### Bruce Kadden 
The campus Mil lei organiza
tion is sponsoring a Tay-Sachs
disease prevention program
which will culminate in blood
test screenings to be held later
this month.
Tay-Sachs disease is an incur
able, recessive genetic disorder
that attacks the nervous system
in infants. It is always fatal by
three to five years of age.
Recent scientific break
throughs now make it possible to
prevent Tay-Sachs disease by
testing parents and potential
parents to identify Tay-Sachs
gene carriers, according to Joan
Waranoff, coordinator of the
northern California program to
prevent the disease.
The testing is designed to de
termine if persons of child
bearing age are carriers of the
gene, and thus risk having
offspring with the disease if
they have children with another
carrier.
Options involved
Through genetic counseling,
couples in which both members
are carriers, and who therefore
have a one-in-four chance of
having a Tay-Sachs child, can be
offered several options, one of
which is prenatal diagnosis.
This procedure enables them
to plan for the birth of healthy
children, unaffected by Tay-
Sachs disease, Waranoff stated.
The Tay-Sachs gene is 10
times more common among in
dividuals of Jewish ancestry
than in the general population.
One out of 30 Jews in the United
States carries the Tay-Sachs
gene.
Far-reaching effect
While the Tay-Sachs screen
ing program is aimed specifi

cally at the Jewish population,
its implications go far beyond
this particular disease.
Tay-Sadis is a prototype for
the control ol other genetic dis
orders (such V} s sickle cell
anemia) once testing tor
other diseases becomY-* -i?yad
able.
Waranoff stated that general
awareness of the Tay-Sachs
program will promote a better
understanding of the basic prin
ciples of genetics and how they
can affect family planning deci
sions.
Carriers identified
Since the testing program in
the Hay Area began 15 months
ago, more than 5000 persons
have been tested at Tay-Sachs
screenings, identifying 177 car
riers.
Pediatrics Prof. Howard Cann(
and Dr. Howard Rosenberg of the
V.A. Hospital presented slides
and answered questions at yes
terday's Hillel bagel brunch, the
first of eight such educational
programs to be presented during
the next two weeks.
The screenings will be held
April 28, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and
2-4 p.m., and on April 29, 2-4
p.m. in Tresidder Union, Rooms
270-271.
The blood test will also be
available on April 29 from 10
a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Medical
Center in the Medical Clinic
room AlO5. These testings are
open to the public/No appoint
ment is necessary and results
will be confidential.
The campus screening is also
sponsored by the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Office, the Depart
ment of Pediatrics, and is also
being aided by the cooperation
of Cowell Health Center.

The blood test will also be
available on April 29 from 10
a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Medical
Center in the Medical Clinic
room AlO5. These testings are
open to the public/No appoint
ment is necessary and results
will be confidential.
The campus screening is also
sponsored by the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Office, the Depart
ment of Pediatrics, and is also
being aided by the cooperation
of Cowell Health Center.
The campus Mil lei organiza
tion is sponsoring a Tay-Sachs
disease prevention program
which will culminate in blood
test screenings to be held later
this month.
Tay-Sachs disease is an incur
able, recessive genetic disorder
that attacks the nervous system
in infants. It is always fatal by
three to five years of age.
Recent scientific break
throughs now make it possible to
prevent Tay-Sachs disease by
testing parents and potential
parents to identify Tay-Sachs
gene carriers, according to Joan
Waranoff, coordinator of the
northern California program to
prevent the disease.
The testing is designed to de
termine if persons of child
bearing age are carriers of the
gene, and thus risk having
offspring with the disease if
they have children with another
carrier.
Options involved
Through genetic counseling,
couples in which both members
are carriers, and who therefore
have a one-in-four chance of
having a Tay-Sachs child, can be
offered several options, one of
which is prenatal diagnosis.
This procedure enables them
to plan for the birth of healthy
children, unaffected by Tay-
Sachs disease, Waranoff stated.
The Tay-Sachs gene is 10
times more common among in
dividuals of Jewish ancestry
than in the general population.
One out of 30 Jews in the United
States carries the Tay-Sachs
gene.
Far-reaching effect
While the Tay-Sachs screen
ing program is aimed specifi

cally at the Jewish population,
its implications go far beyond
this particular disease.
Tay-Sadis is a prototype for
the control ol other genetic dis
orders (such V} s sickle cell
anemia) once testing tor
other diseases becomY-* -i?yad
able.
Waranoff stated that general
awareness of the Tay-Sachs
program will promote a better
understanding of the basic prin
ciples of genetics and how they
can affect family planning deci
sions.
Carriers identified
Since the testing program in
the Hay Area began 15 months
ago, more than 5000 persons
have been tested at Tay-Sachs
screenings, identifying 177 car
riers.
