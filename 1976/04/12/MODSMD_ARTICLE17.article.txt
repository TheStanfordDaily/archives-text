# Government to use Hughes Mining Barge
## 
### 
The mysterious Hughes Min
ing Barge has been retained by
the Energy Research ap(d De
! velopment Administration
* (ERDA) at the Port.'tif Redwood
City. 7/
At a held
I Barge Mas
ter Ha^^ e y "Snuffy" Smith
that the barge will be
-"'used to test ocean thermal
energy conversion equipment.
It has been alleged that the
barge played a major role in sal
vaging the mysterious Soviet
submarine which sank in the
Pacific in 1968. While the barge
is submersible to 105 feet, an
especially designed underwater
transfer unit is operational to
depths of 20,000 feet.
The barge, which cost $7.5
million, only went to sea twice,
along with the command ship
Glomar Explorer. Barge Master
Smith would not elaborate on
the specific mission or ac
complishments of tin; barge, but
he did say that he was "satis
fied" with the performance of
the vessel.
Lockheed
The barge was built to Lock
heed Corporation's specifica
tions by the National Steel and
Ship Building Company in San
Diego.
The barge was jointly owned
bySumma Corp..Global Marine
and Lockheed Corp.
The barge is basically a float
ing covered enclosure for the
underwater transfer unit,
nicknamed "Clementine."
Procedure
Smith, a former U.S. Navy
captain, explained how a sal
vage operation worked. After the
barge had submerged to a depth

of 150 feet, its roof doors would
slide back, allowing "Clemen
tine" to float clear of the barge.
"Clementine," equipped with
acoustical, optical and
pressure-sensitive modules as
well as giant claws, would trans
fer to the Glomar Explorer,
which directed it to the precise
salvage point.
After its salvage mission was
completed, "Clementine" was
floated back to the Hughes Min
ing Barge. The barge was re
floated and returned to port.
Left behind
Smith stated that "Clemen
tine" had never brought any
thing back to the barge with it.
Thus, anything picked up by
"Clementine" was left with the
Glomar Explorer. The Glomur
Explorer is currently under the
jurisdiction of the General Ser
vices Administration and is
docked at Long Beach.
The barge was being cut up for
scrap when the ERDA stated its
interest in using it for their
oceanic energy experiments.
There is virtually nothing left of
the "Clementine." Its legs, sen
sors and power mechanisms
have all been removed.
The ERDA plans to use the
barge to determine if energy can
be feasibly obtained on a large
scale basis by utilizing the warm
waters of theGulf Stream and the
colder water beneath the stream.
The plan is to have a pipe 45 feet
in diameter extend to depths of
over 2000 feet for the cold water
needed for the conversion.
The ERDA estimates that the
first commercial plant will be
able to produce 100 megawatts
of electricity.

thing back to the barge with it.
Thus, anything picked up by
"Clementine" was left with the
Glomar Explorer. The Glomur
Explorer is currently under the
jurisdiction of the General Ser
vices Administration and is
docked at Long Beach.
The barge was being cut up for
scrap when the ERDA stated its
interest in using it for their
oceanic energy experiments.
There is virtually nothing left of
the "Clementine." Its legs, sen
sors and power mechanisms
have all been removed.
The ERDA plans to use the
barge to determine if energy can
be feasibly obtained on a large
scale basis by utilizing the warm
waters of theGulf Stream and the
colder water beneath the stream.
The plan is to have a pipe 45 feet
in diameter extend to depths of
over 2000 feet for the cold water
needed for the conversion.
The ERDA estimates that the
first commercial plant will be
able to produce 100 megawatts
of electricity.

IMMERSIBLE — The Hughes Mining Barge, kept in the Port of Redwood City, has been used in some
salvage operations. In the future the Energy Research and Development Administration will use it in
oceanic energy experiments.

that the barge will be
-"'used to test ocean thermal
energy conversion equipment.
It has been alleged that the
barge played a major role in sal
vaging the mysterious Soviet
submarine which sank in the
Pacific in 1968. While the barge
is submersible to 105 feet, an
especially designed underwater
transfer unit is operational to
depths of 20,000 feet.
The barge, which cost $7.5
million, only went to sea twice,
along with the command ship
Glomar Explorer. Barge Master
Smith would not elaborate on
the specific mission or ac
complishments of tin; barge, but
he did say that he was "satis
fied" with the performance of
the vessel.
Lockheed
The barge was built to Lock
heed Corporation's specifica
tions by the National Steel and
Ship Building Company in San
Diego.
The barge was jointly owned
bySumma Corp..Global Marine
and Lockheed Corp.
The barge is basically a float
ing covered enclosure for the
underwater transfer unit,
nicknamed "Clementine."
Procedure
Smith, a former U.S. Navy
captain, explained how a sal
vage operation worked. After the
barge had submerged to a depth

of 150 feet, its roof doors would
slide back, allowing "Clemen
tine" to float clear of the barge.
"Clementine," equipped with
acoustical, optical and
pressure-sensitive modules as
well as giant claws, would trans
fer to the Glomar Explorer,
which directed it to the precise
salvage point.
After its salvage mission was
completed, "Clementine" was
floated back to the Hughes Min
ing Barge. The barge was re
floated and returned to port.
