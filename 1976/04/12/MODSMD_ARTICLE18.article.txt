## Mixed doubles draws raves Tennis teams carve up Trinity 
### Paul Bauman 
It is match point against Mark
Mitchell and Diane Morrison of
Stanford in a third set tiebreaker.
Trinity's David King blasts a
first serve toward Mitchell's
backhand. Mitchell ricochets the
ball off the middle of his racket
directly at King, who can only
return the shot into the net.
Maples silence
The silence in Maples Pavil
ion, interrupted only by the in
termittent "pong" sounds of ball
meeting racket, is destroyed not
by reserved applause, the
trademark of a tennis crowd, but
an all-out roar. The fans even rise
to their feet.
With the tiebreaker tied at 4-4,
the match rests on the next point.

After Mitchell nets a backhand.
King jumps up and then hugs
Donna Stockton, his mixed dou
bles partner.
Surely that was the deciding
match which gave Trinity a win
over Stanford. Nope. The out
come had been decided about
eight hours earlier when the
Cards won their 10th match of
the total 18.
So why all the emotion? The
fans and players were just react
ing to the best match of a two
day tennis extravaganza and the
novelty of collegiate mixed dou
bles.
Healthy attitude
If ever there was a healthy at
titude about sports, the players
on both teams exhibited it Friday

and Saturday. Stanford's Gene
Mayer couldn't compliment his
mixed doubles partner, Susie
Hagey, enough Friday night.
Trinity men cheered in the
stands for Trinity women on the
court, and vice versa. The Tigers
won four straight matches after
Stanford had already declared
itself the overall winner.
Both teams played to win, but
with an attitude that participat
ing in the first major collegiate
coed tennis match ever was to be
enjoyed.
For those inclined to divide
the results by sex, the Stanford
men won five matches and so
did the Card women. How
egalitarian.
Stanford won because of the

singles depth. The Cards won
eight of the 12 singles matches,
but only two of the six doubles
contests.
Top players
Stanford lost both first singles
matches to a couple of the coun
try's best players, Bill Scanlon
and Stephanie Tolleson.
The Cards kissed the shutout
goodby in the Bill Maze-
Scanlon match Friday night in
front of 2300 people in Maples.
Maze is in a terrible slump, now
having lost seven of his last nine
matches in singles and doubles.
Last week it even took him
three sets to beat California's
Steve Pompan, who won't re
mind anyone of Billy Martin.
Scanlon, on the other hand, is
one of the fastest improving,
players in college tennis. A few
months ago, the sophomore
All-American lost to Hie Nas
tase, who won't remind anyone
of Pompan, in three sets.
Maze loses
Maze played better than he has
recently, but Scanlon still won
easily, 6-4,6-3. Maze served well
(five aces), as he must to win, but
Scanlon countered with strong
returns and never lost his own
serve.
The next evening in Maples
before 2600 fans, Tolleson
wiped out Lele "Queen" Forood
of Stanford, 7-5,6-0, in a rematch
of last year's National Women's
Intercollegiate singles champ
ionship won by Tolleson.
Forood was clearly off her
game, constantly hitting her
shots wide or over the baseline,
while Tolleson was near perfect.
The result was the biggest rout
since Stanford played UCLA in
basketball.
Tolleson dominates
Tolleson broke Forood's serve
five times and lost hers only

once. The Trinity sophomore so
dominated the second set that
she didn't lose one point on her
serve. Somebody said Tolleson
hit the ball out of the court twice
in that set, and that wasn't much
of an exaggeration.
"I gave her (Tolleson) a chance
to hit all her good shots," Forood
said afterward. "I didn't put any
pressure on her from the
backcourt. I gave her a lot of con
fidence and then she started hit
ting these really outrageous
shots."
Forood's poor play was sur
prising because she played so
well the previous night in dou
bles. Forood teamed with
freshman Barb Jordan to beat
Tolleson and Sandy Stap, the
No. 1 amateur women's doubles
team in the U.S.,6-4, 6-4.
Stanford got off to a great start
against Trinity, winning all six
matches Friday afternoon on the
Varsity Courts, but then dropped
eight of the last 12. The winning
match for the Cards came Satur
day afternoon at sixth men's
singles as Perry Wright beat
Eddie Reese, 6-4, 6-1. The match
was one of six moved into
Maples because of rain.
