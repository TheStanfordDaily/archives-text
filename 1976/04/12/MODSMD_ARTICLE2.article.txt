# Alumni contributions lag behind Ivy League levels
## 
### Philip Feder 
Back in the 1940s and'sosand even
before, a Stanford education was a bar
gain by anyone's standard.
And now, as those grateful alumni
are donating money to the University
— as thanks for helping them gain luc
rative executive positions — Stanford
has grown from the status of a good
regional school to one with interna
tional drawing power.
Given that now, in 1976, tuition
stands at $3810 and promises to go
higher, how can University fund rais
ers hope to count on the ranks of the
soon-to-be-alumni to fork over more
hard-earned dollars?
The answer, says University General
Secretary Daryl Pearson, who heads
the University's major fund raising ef
forts, is that "our alumni body is ex
tremely loyal."
The statistics on fund raising appear
to bear out Pearson's claim.
For example, a 1970 Alumni Associ
ation survey found that almost half of
all alumni would "substantially" in
crease their contribution to the Uni
versity if Stanford's survival depended
ona significant increaseinalumni giv
ing.
Last year, however, Stanford alums
donated an average of only $146 each.
That compares with Dartmouth's
$179, Yale's $279 and Harvard's $228
as reported in the Wall Street fournal.
And even though the total value of
gifts to the University — including
non-alumni gifts — was the second
highest total in the country (Harvard
was first), Stanford lags far behind
most of the Ivys in the percentage of
alumni who give.
In fact, only about 20-25 percent of
Stanford alums donate money each
year while the figures for Princeton
and Dartmouth were 55 percent and 58
percent, respectively.
The lack of an "old boy" image here
may explain Stanford's relative inabil
ity to attract as many individual
donors as other similar institutions.
And. in comparison with that of the
Ivy League, Stanford uses a more low
key approach in urging present stu
dents to become generous alumni.
Student involvement
Pearson concedes that the Univer
sity "has a much lower profile of stu
dent involvement" in fund raising ac
tivities than other schools and that
"more student involvement would in
crease the giving" by alumni.
The student involvement that does

exist is confined to a small group
known as the Student Development
Committee, which falls under the pur
view of the General Secretary's Office.
Committee member Dick Kaufman,
a senior, says the University should
keep the low-key approach because "1
don't like paying $3810 any more than
anyone else."
The committee, says Kaufman, is not
designed to indoctrinate students, but
"to make students aware that tuition is
not covering the full cost of education.
We want to inform students of the fi
nancial facts of the University."
However, Scott Jones, another
committee member, suggests a some
what different method of informing
students.
"We're trying to hit students early
because the other schools are really
gung-ho. We're trying to develop a
tradition where people can be indoc
trinated to the fact that the University
needs money." says Jones.
Whether it's indoctrination or not,
students here are generally hesitant
about being philanthropic. Senior

Chris Hardy says,"I absolutely would
not give money because 1 feel the Uni
versity did not live up to my expecta
tions. My family has already given 20
to 25,000 dollars."
Junior Elizabeth Reynolds agrees: "I
wouldn't give money unless I was ex
tremely wealthy. They're ripping me
off so badly here."
But junior Shanda Bahles takes a dif
ferent outlook. "It depends on how
much money I make. For me to give to
Stanford would amount to a they
helped-me-l'll-help-them proposi
tion," she says.
Encouraging potential donors
In order to encourage potential
donors to donate money, the Univer
sity tries to be "helpful in a way that is
appropriate," says Alumni Associa
tion Director Tom Newell.
The Alumni Association, for exam
ple, offers free office space to the
Stanford-in-Government program,
provides an alumni contact service for
student job-seekers and allows stu
dents and parents to make use of the
Bowman Alumni House during com
mencement weekend.
"Certainly we want students to join
the Alumni Association, but our ef
forts are motivated by our desire to
make sure that students realize that we
are concerned about them," Newell
says.
Present alumni are all but button
holed to donate money to the Univer
sity through Alumni Association ac
tivities like the Sierra Camp, the Al
pine Chalet, charter flights to Europe
and alumni colleges where popular
professors lecture in specialized
mini-courses.
In addition, there are alumni clubs
in someflO cities throughout the world
as well as elaborate reunion parties
after the Big Game.
And those persuasive efforts are
being translated into fat checks enter
ing the University's coffers every day.
Last year, well over $18 million was
collected from alumni. The General
Secretary's Office is also in the process
of seeking multi-million dollar dona
tions toward construction of the long
awaited new library,and several alums
have been approached.
New Founders League
Newell and the rest of the University
also face problems caused by a small
but vocal minority of conservative

alumni who call themselves the New
Founders League.
The league was founded because
"alumni should not just put up funds
and then have the administration
spend them without taking into ac
count the feelings of alumni," says a
New Founders League director, Low
ell Berry, a 1924 Stanford graduate.
"We're trying to be a spokesman for
alumni who want to be helpful to Stan
ford in a critically constructive way,"
Berry says. "We have the feeling that at
Stanford, those on the far left or liberal
side are so predominately in control
that the influence is detrimental to the
students."
But Berry insists that the league is
not "fascist" in any way. "We support
the return of the ROTC program," he
says, "because that's highly important
from a national standpoint. There
should be the opportunity for students
to receive that $6000 scholarship."
However, Berry says that the arrival
of Angela Davis as a lecturer this quar
ter "is influencing alumni to stop giv
ing money."
In addition, Berry maintains that the
University rejected a gift of $500,000
because the donor wanted the money
to go, in part, to the restoration of
ROTC.
Major contributor
Berry himself is a major contributor
to the University. In 1963 he made a

gift in excess of $1 million for use in
expanding the church program on the
campus, according to a report pre
sented before the Hoard of Trustees la
February.
And, in what might appear as a
move by the University to appease the
New Founders League, Berry was re
cently appointed to the Hoover Institu
tion Board of Overseers.
But Alumni Association Director
Newell insists that the appointment
was made solely by the Hoover Institu
tion, a quasi-independent group
within the University. "It was a deci
sion of the Hoover Institution to ask for
Mr. Berry," Newell says.
The University's counter-attar!*
against the New Founders League
(whose periodical, Stanford's Direc
tion, has a circulation of 23,000) has
been strong. In 1973, Alumni Associa
tion President Ralph Davidson called
the league "a negative force. They just
sit back and criticize everything thatlr
going on."
However, Newell, who says "there
has never been the slightest doubt of
the sincerity of their (the league's)
concern for Stanford," calls the Uni
versity's current position "open, frank
and cordial with the leadership of tip
New Founders League."

New Founders League."
Back in the 1940s and'sosand even
before, a Stanford education was a bar
gain by anyone's standard.
And now, as those grateful alumni
are donating money to the University
— as thanks for helping them gain luc
rative executive positions — Stanford
has grown from the status of a good
regional school to one with interna
tional drawing power.
Given that now, in 1976, tuition
stands at $3810 and promises to go
higher, how can University fund rais
ers hope to count on the ranks of the
soon-to-be-alumni to fork over more
hard-earned dollars?
The answer, says University General
Secretary Daryl Pearson, who heads
the University's major fund raising ef
forts, is that "our alumni body is ex
tremely loyal."
The statistics on fund raising appear
to bear out Pearson's claim.
For example, a 1970 Alumni Associ
ation survey found that almost half of
all alumni would "substantially" in
crease their contribution to the Uni
versity if Stanford's survival depended
ona significant increaseinalumni giv
ing.
Last year, however, Stanford alums
donated an average of only $146 each.
That compares with Dartmouth's
$179, Yale's $279 and Harvard's $228
as reported in the Wall Street fournal.
And even though the total value of
gifts to the University — including
non-alumni gifts — was the second
highest total in the country (Harvard
was first), Stanford lags far behind
most of the Ivys in the percentage of
alumni who give.
In fact, only about 20-25 percent of
Stanford alums donate money each
year while the figures for Princeton
and Dartmouth were 55 percent and 58
percent, respectively.
The lack of an "old boy" image here
may explain Stanford's relative inabil
ity to attract as many individual
donors as other similar institutions.
And. in comparison with that of the
Ivy League, Stanford uses a more low
key approach in urging present stu
dents to become generous alumni.
Student involvement
Pearson concedes that the Univer
sity "has a much lower profile of stu
dent involvement" in fund raising ac
tivities than other schools and that
"more student involvement would in
crease the giving" by alumni.
The student involvement that does

exist is confined to a small group
known as the Student Development
Committee, which falls under the pur
view of the General Secretary's Office.
Committee member Dick Kaufman,
a senior, says the University should
keep the low-key approach because "1
don't like paying $3810 any more than
anyone else."
The committee, says Kaufman, is not
designed to indoctrinate students, but
"to make students aware that tuition is
not covering the full cost of education.
We want to inform students of the fi
nancial facts of the University."
However, Scott Jones, another
committee member, suggests a some
what different method of informing
students.
"We're trying to hit students early
because the other schools are really
gung-ho. We're trying to develop a
tradition where people can be indoc
trinated to the fact that the University
needs money." says Jones.
Whether it's indoctrination or not,
students here are generally hesitant
about being philanthropic. Senior

Chris Hardy says,"I absolutely would
not give money because 1 feel the Uni
versity did not live up to my expecta
tions. My family has already given 20
to 25,000 dollars."
Junior Elizabeth Reynolds agrees: "I
wouldn't give money unless I was ex
tremely wealthy. They're ripping me
off so badly here."
But junior Shanda Bahles takes a dif
ferent outlook. "It depends on how
much money I make. For me to give to
Stanford would amount to a they
helped-me-l'll-help-them proposi
tion," she says.
Encouraging potential donors
In order to encourage potential
donors to donate money, the Univer
sity tries to be "helpful in a way that is
appropriate," says Alumni Associa
tion Director Tom Newell.
The Alumni Association, for exam
ple, offers free office space to the
Stanford-in-Government program,
provides an alumni contact service for
student job-seekers and allows stu
dents and parents to make use of the
Bowman Alumni House during com
mencement weekend.
"Certainly we want students to join
the Alumni Association, but our ef
forts are motivated by our desire to
make sure that students realize that we
are concerned about them," Newell
says.
Present alumni are all but button
holed to donate money to the Univer
sity through Alumni Association ac
tivities like the Sierra Camp, the Al
pine Chalet, charter flights to Europe
and alumni colleges where popular
professors lecture in specialized
mini-courses.
In addition, there are alumni clubs
in someflO cities throughout the world
as well as elaborate reunion parties
after the Big Game.
And those persuasive efforts are
being translated into fat checks enter
ing the University's coffers every day.
Last year, well over $18 million was
collected from alumni. The General
Secretary's Office is also in the process
of seeking multi-million dollar dona
tions toward construction of the long
awaited new library,and several alums
have been approached.
New Founders League
Newell and the rest of the University
also face problems caused by a small
but vocal minority of conservative

alumni who call themselves the New
Founders League.
The league was founded because
"alumni should not just put up funds
and then have the administration
spend them without taking into ac
count the feelings of alumni," says a
New Founders League director, Low
ell Berry, a 1924 Stanford graduate.
"We're trying to be a spokesman for
alumni who want to be helpful to Stan
ford in a critically constructive way,"
Berry says. "We have the feeling that at
Stanford, those on the far left or liberal
side are so predominately in control
that the influence is detrimental to the
students."
But Berry insists that the league is
not "fascist" in any way. "We support
the return of the ROTC program," he
says, "because that's highly important
from a national standpoint. There
should be the opportunity for students
to receive that $6000 scholarship."
However, Berry says that the arrival
of Angela Davis as a lecturer this quar
ter "is influencing alumni to stop giv
ing money."
In addition, Berry maintains that the
University rejected a gift of $500,000
because the donor wanted the money
to go, in part, to the restoration of
ROTC.
Major contributor
Berry himself is a major contributor
to the University. In 1963 he made a

gift in excess of $1 million for use in
expanding the church program on the
campus, according to a report pre
sented before the Hoard of Trustees la
February.
And, in what might appear as a
move by the University to appease the
New Founders League, Berry was re
cently appointed to the Hoover Institu
tion Board of Overseers.
But Alumni Association Director
Newell insists that the appointment
was made solely by the Hoover Institu
tion, a quasi-independent group
within the University. "It was a deci
sion of the Hoover Institution to ask for
Mr. Berry," Newell says.
The University's counter-attar!*
against the New Founders League
(whose periodical, Stanford's Direc
tion, has a circulation of 23,000) has
been strong. In 1973, Alumni Associa
tion President Ralph Davidson called
the league "a negative force. They just
sit back and criticize everything thatlr
going on."
However, Newell, who says "there
has never been the slightest doubt of
the sincerity of their (the league's)
concern for Stanford," calls the Uni
versity's current position "open, frank
and cordial with the leadership of tip
New Founders League."

and cordial with the leadership of tip
New Founders League."
Back in the 1940s and'sosand even
before, a Stanford education was a bar
gain by anyone's standard.
And now, as those grateful alumni
are donating money to the University
— as thanks for helping them gain luc
rative executive positions — Stanford
has grown from the status of a good
regional school to one with interna
tional drawing power.
Given that now, in 1976, tuition
stands at $3810 and promises to go
higher, how can University fund rais
ers hope to count on the ranks of the
soon-to-be-alumni to fork over more
hard-earned dollars?
The answer, says University General
Secretary Daryl Pearson, who heads
the University's major fund raising ef
forts, is that "our alumni body is ex
tremely loyal."
The statistics on fund raising appear
to bear out Pearson's claim.
For example, a 1970 Alumni Associ
ation survey found that almost half of
all alumni would "substantially" in
crease their contribution to the Uni
versity if Stanford's survival depended
ona significant increaseinalumni giv
ing.
Last year, however, Stanford alums
donated an average of only $146 each.
That compares with Dartmouth's
$179, Yale's $279 and Harvard's $228
as reported in the Wall Street fournal.
And even though the total value of
gifts to the University — including
non-alumni gifts — was the second
highest total in the country (Harvard
was first), Stanford lags far behind
most of the Ivys in the percentage of
alumni who give.
In fact, only about 20-25 percent of
Stanford alums donate money each
year while the figures for Princeton
and Dartmouth were 55 percent and 58
percent, respectively.
The lack of an "old boy" image here
may explain Stanford's relative inabil
ity to attract as many individual
donors as other similar institutions.
And. in comparison with that of the
Ivy League, Stanford uses a more low
key approach in urging present stu
dents to become generous alumni.
Student involvement
Pearson concedes that the Univer
sity "has a much lower profile of stu
dent involvement" in fund raising ac
tivities than other schools and that
"more student involvement would in
crease the giving" by alumni.
The student involvement that does

exist is confined to a small group
known as the Student Development
Committee, which falls under the pur
view of the General Secretary's Office.
Committee member Dick Kaufman,
a senior, says the University should
keep the low-key approach because "1
don't like paying $3810 any more than
anyone else."
The committee, says Kaufman, is not
designed to indoctrinate students, but
"to make students aware that tuition is
not covering the full cost of education.
We want to inform students of the fi
nancial facts of the University."
However, Scott Jones, another
committee member, suggests a some
what different method of informing
students.
"We're trying to hit students early
because the other schools are really
gung-ho. We're trying to develop a
tradition where people can be indoc
trinated to the fact that the University
needs money." says Jones.
Whether it's indoctrination or not,
students here are generally hesitant
about being philanthropic. Senior

Chris Hardy says,"I absolutely would
not give money because 1 feel the Uni
versity did not live up to my expecta
tions. My family has already given 20
to 25,000 dollars."
Junior Elizabeth Reynolds agrees: "I
wouldn't give money unless I was ex
tremely wealthy. They're ripping me
off so badly here."
But junior Shanda Bahles takes a dif
ferent outlook. "It depends on how
much money I make. For me to give to
Stanford would amount to a they
helped-me-l'll-help-them proposi
tion," she says.
Encouraging potential donors
In order to encourage potential
donors to donate money, the Univer
sity tries to be "helpful in a way that is
appropriate," says Alumni Associa
tion Director Tom Newell.
The Alumni Association, for exam
ple, offers free office space to the
Stanford-in-Government program,
provides an alumni contact service for
student job-seekers and allows stu
dents and parents to make use of the
Bowman Alumni House during com
mencement weekend.
"Certainly we want students to join
the Alumni Association, but our ef
forts are motivated by our desire to
make sure that students realize that we
are concerned about them," Newell
says.
Present alumni are all but button
holed to donate money to the Univer
sity through Alumni Association ac
tivities like the Sierra Camp, the Al
pine Chalet, charter flights to Europe
and alumni colleges where popular
professors lecture in specialized
mini-courses.
In addition, there are alumni clubs
in someflO cities throughout the world
as well as elaborate reunion parties
after the Big Game.
And those persuasive efforts are
being translated into fat checks enter
ing the University's coffers every day.
Last year, well over $18 million was
collected from alumni. The General
Secretary's Office is also in the process
of seeking multi-million dollar dona
tions toward construction of the long
awaited new library,and several alums
have been approached.
New Founders League
Newell and the rest of the University
also face problems caused by a small
but vocal minority of conservative

alumni who call themselves the New
Founders League.
The league was founded because
"alumni should not just put up funds
and then have the administration
spend them without taking into ac
count the feelings of alumni," says a
New Founders League director, Low
ell Berry, a 1924 Stanford graduate.
"We're trying to be a spokesman for
alumni who want to be helpful to Stan
ford in a critically constructive way,"
Berry says. "We have the feeling that at
Stanford, those on the far left or liberal
side are so predominately in control
that the influence is detrimental to the
students."
But Berry insists that the league is
not "fascist" in any way. "We support
the return of the ROTC program," he
says, "because that's highly important
from a national standpoint. There
should be the opportunity for students
to receive that $6000 scholarship."
However, Berry says that the arrival
of Angela Davis as a lecturer this quar
ter "is influencing alumni to stop giv
ing money."
In addition, Berry maintains that the
University rejected a gift of $500,000
because the donor wanted the money
to go, in part, to the restoration of
ROTC.
Major contributor
Berry himself is a major contributor
to the University. In 1963 he made a

gift in excess of $1 million for use in
expanding the church program on the
campus, according to a report pre
sented before the Hoard of Trustees la
February.
And, in what might appear as a
move by the University to appease the
New Founders League, Berry was re
cently appointed to the Hoover Institu
tion Board of Overseers.
But Alumni Association Director
Newell insists that the appointment
was made solely by the Hoover Institu
tion, a quasi-independent group
within the University. "It was a deci
sion of the Hoover Institution to ask for
Mr. Berry," Newell says.
The University's counter-attar!*
against the New Founders League
(whose periodical, Stanford's Direc
tion, has a circulation of 23,000) has
been strong. In 1973, Alumni Associa
tion President Ralph Davidson called
the league "a negative force. They just
sit back and criticize everything thatlr
going on."
However, Newell, who says "there
has never been the slightest doubt of
the sincerity of their (the league's)
concern for Stanford," calls the Uni
versity's current position "open, frank
and cordial with the leadership of tip
New Founders League."

versity's current position "open, frank
and cordial with the leadership of tip
New Founders League."
Back in the 1940s and'sosand even
before, a Stanford education was a bar
gain by anyone's standard.
And now, as those grateful alumni
are donating money to the University
— as thanks for helping them gain luc
rative executive positions — Stanford
has grown from the status of a good
regional school to one with interna
tional drawing power.
Given that now, in 1976, tuition
stands at $3810 and promises to go
higher, how can University fund rais
ers hope to count on the ranks of the
soon-to-be-alumni to fork over more
hard-earned dollars?
The answer, says University General
Secretary Daryl Pearson, who heads
the University's major fund raising ef
forts, is that "our alumni body is ex
tremely loyal."
The statistics on fund raising appear
to bear out Pearson's claim.
For example, a 1970 Alumni Associ
ation survey found that almost half of
all alumni would "substantially" in
crease their contribution to the Uni
versity if Stanford's survival depended
ona significant increaseinalumni giv
ing.
Last year, however, Stanford alums
donated an average of only $146 each.
That compares with Dartmouth's
$179, Yale's $279 and Harvard's $228
as reported in the Wall Street fournal.
And even though the total value of
gifts to the University — including
non-alumni gifts — was the second
highest total in the country (Harvard
was first), Stanford lags far behind
most of the Ivys in the percentage of
alumni who give.
In fact, only about 20-25 percent of
Stanford alums donate money each
year while the figures for Princeton
and Dartmouth were 55 percent and 58
percent, respectively.
The lack of an "old boy" image here
may explain Stanford's relative inabil
ity to attract as many individual
donors as other similar institutions.
And. in comparison with that of the
Ivy League, Stanford uses a more low
key approach in urging present stu
dents to become generous alumni.
Student involvement
Pearson concedes that the Univer
sity "has a much lower profile of stu
dent involvement" in fund raising ac
tivities than other schools and that
"more student involvement would in
crease the giving" by alumni.
The student involvement that does

exist is confined to a small group
known as the Student Development
Committee, which falls under the pur
view of the General Secretary's Office.
Committee member Dick Kaufman,
a senior, says the University should
keep the low-key approach because "1
don't like paying $3810 any more than
anyone else."
The committee, says Kaufman, is not
designed to indoctrinate students, but
"to make students aware that tuition is
not covering the full cost of education.
We want to inform students of the fi
nancial facts of the University."
However, Scott Jones, another
committee member, suggests a some
what different method of informing
students.
"We're trying to hit students early
because the other schools are really
gung-ho. We're trying to develop a
tradition where people can be indoc
trinated to the fact that the University
needs money." says Jones.
Whether it's indoctrination or not,
students here are generally hesitant
about being philanthropic. Senior

Chris Hardy says,"I absolutely would
not give money because 1 feel the Uni
versity did not live up to my expecta
tions. My family has already given 20
to 25,000 dollars."
Junior Elizabeth Reynolds agrees: "I
wouldn't give money unless I was ex
tremely wealthy. They're ripping me
off so badly here."
But junior Shanda Bahles takes a dif
ferent outlook. "It depends on how
much money I make. For me to give to
Stanford would amount to a they
helped-me-l'll-help-them proposi
tion," she says.
Encouraging potential donors
In order to encourage potential
donors to donate money, the Univer
sity tries to be "helpful in a way that is
appropriate," says Alumni Associa
tion Director Tom Newell.
The Alumni Association, for exam
ple, offers free office space to the
Stanford-in-Government program,
provides an alumni contact service for
student job-seekers and allows stu
dents and parents to make use of the
Bowman Alumni House during com
mencement weekend.
"Certainly we want students to join
the Alumni Association, but our ef
forts are motivated by our desire to
make sure that students realize that we
are concerned about them," Newell
says.
Present alumni are all but button
holed to donate money to the Univer
sity through Alumni Association ac
tivities like the Sierra Camp, the Al
pine Chalet, charter flights to Europe
and alumni colleges where popular
professors lecture in specialized
mini-courses.
In addition, there are alumni clubs
in someflO cities throughout the world
as well as elaborate reunion parties
after the Big Game.
And those persuasive efforts are
being translated into fat checks enter
ing the University's coffers every day.
Last year, well over $18 million was
collected from alumni. The General
Secretary's Office is also in the process
of seeking multi-million dollar dona
tions toward construction of the long
awaited new library,and several alums
have been approached.
New Founders League
Newell and the rest of the University
also face problems caused by a small
but vocal minority of conservative

alumni who call themselves the New
Founders League.
The league was founded because
"alumni should not just put up funds
and then have the administration
spend them without taking into ac
count the feelings of alumni," says a
New Founders League director, Low
ell Berry, a 1924 Stanford graduate.
"We're trying to be a spokesman for
alumni who want to be helpful to Stan
ford in a critically constructive way,"
Berry says. "We have the feeling that at
Stanford, those on the far left or liberal
side are so predominately in control
that the influence is detrimental to the
students."
But Berry insists that the league is
not "fascist" in any way. "We support
the return of the ROTC program," he
says, "because that's highly important
from a national standpoint. There
should be the opportunity for students
to receive that $6000 scholarship."
However, Berry says that the arrival
of Angela Davis as a lecturer this quar
ter "is influencing alumni to stop giv
ing money."
In addition, Berry maintains that the
University rejected a gift of $500,000
because the donor wanted the money
to go, in part, to the restoration of
ROTC.
Major contributor
Berry himself is a major contributor
to the University. In 1963 he made a

gift in excess of $1 million for use in
expanding the church program on the
campus, according to a report pre
sented before the Hoard of Trustees la
February.
And, in what might appear as a
move by the University to appease the
New Founders League, Berry was re
cently appointed to the Hoover Institu
tion Board of Overseers.
But Alumni Association Director
Newell insists that the appointment
was made solely by the Hoover Institu
tion, a quasi-independent group
within the University. "It was a deci
sion of the Hoover Institution to ask for
Mr. Berry," Newell says.
The University's counter-attar!*
against the New Founders League
(whose periodical, Stanford's Direc
tion, has a circulation of 23,000) has
been strong. In 1973, Alumni Associa
tion President Ralph Davidson called
the league "a negative force. They just
sit back and criticize everything thatlr
going on."
However, Newell, who says "there
has never been the slightest doubt of
the sincerity of their (the league's)
concern for Stanford," calls the Uni
versity's current position "open, frank
and cordial with the leadership of tip
New Founders League."
