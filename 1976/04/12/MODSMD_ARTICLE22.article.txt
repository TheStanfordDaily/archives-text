# Trackmen double up Occidental
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
On the strength of double wins by Marvin
Holmes, Tony Sandoval and John Foster,
Stanford's cindermen emerged as 90-64
winners from their Saturday night show
down with Occidental.
"For thesecond year in a row, Foster was
instrumental in breaking their backs," said
coach Payton Jordan after the meet.
Stanford had turned around last year's
meet with Oxy when Foster, normally a
hurdler, won the high jump. Saturday even
ing he did it again.
Foster opened his meet by equaling the
meet record in the 120-yard high hurdles
with a 14.1 win. By the time Foster lined up
for the 440-yard intermediate hurdles, how
ever, Oxy had made the meet much tighter
than the Robber Barons had hoped by
sweeping all three spots in the half-mile.
In command
But the senior from Los Altos put Stan
ford in command by running a 53.5 in the
intermediates tobeata field which included
Gene Taylor, last year's runner-up in the
NCAA finals. Taylor appeared winded from
his earlier victory in the 440-yard dash, and
finished a slow 56.1.
Foster finished his day garnering his 11th
point by picking up a third in the high jump
with a leap of 6-foot-2.
Foster's heroics were complimented by
those of Holmes and San
doval.
Holmes earned Stanford's Most Competi
tive Point Winner award last spring and it is
going to be harder than hell for him not to be
a repeat winner if he has any more days like
Saturday. Holmes won the 100 and 220 in

addition to running the initial leg on Stan
ford's winning 440-yard relay team (40.9).
Dean of distance
Sandoval, not generally called on to dou
ble, proved again why he is the dean of
Stanford's distance running corps.
After winning the mile with a 4:10.3, the
senior from Los Alamos, N.M., came back
and ran a lifetime best in the two-mile. San
doval's eight-lap time of 8:47.4 featured a
4:17 second mile and was a meet record.
Roy Kissin broke Stacy Geiken's year-old
frosh record in the two-mile with a third
place time of 8:58.8. However, Geiken was
doing his own record-breaking.
Geiken set a meet record in the opening
race, the 3000-meter steeplechase, with a
personal best of 9:08.4. Geiken now replaces
teammate Jack Bellah as the third fastest
steeplechaser in Stanford track history.
Meanwhile, Bellah stav ed off a challenge
by Oxy's Jon Sisler on the last lap to finish
second. Sisler, who has a best of 9:03,
finished third with a time identical to Bel
lah's, 9:10.2.
All aces
In the quarter-mile, the Barons played all
their aces, and nearly lost their whole ante.
Stanford lined up James Lofton, Scott
Wingo and Matt Hogsett for the one lap
dash.
But Taylor, who was fresh at that time (in
contrast to his effort later in the inter
mediate hurdles) took the field with a 47.7.
Oxy's Sam Young edged Lofton for a second
place with 48.3.
And while Lofton's 48.4 was only good
for third in the44o, his winning long jump
of 24-9 was representative of an evening of

field event successes.
John Macrorie won the javelin with a
throw of 219-2. The mark was his personal
best. Sophomore Tom Ellis took second
with a fling of 182-6V2. Jordan said Ellis
appears to be physically and mentally ready
to break the 200-foot barrier in the near fu
ture.
Five points
Bob Flint picked up five points for the
Barons by winning the pole vault with a
vault of 16-0.
Mark Hill captured the discus with a
lifetime best of 167-3.
Freshmen Brad Slinkard. Kent Doyle and
Clay Bullwinkel all had key second place
finishes in their field event specialties.
Slinkard had a put of 52-10 3 /4 in the shot,
and Doyle had a 6-4 high jump effort.
Bullwinkel triple jumped 45-OV4, only a
quarter of an inch short of the winning
mark.
The Barons concluded the meet by win
ning the mile relay in what may have been
the most contested race of the evening.
Stanford's team of Wingo, Mark Hadley,
J'aul McCarthy and Lofton continually ex
changed the lead with the Oxy quartet.
It was finally left to Lofton, competing in
his fourth event of the day, to seal the fate of
Occidental. Lofton came from behind with a
47.3 anchor leg that gave Stanford a 10th of
a second margin of victory with a 3:16.4.
This weekend Stanford will host a double
dual meet which will pit the Barons against
UCLA, Cal against (JSC. At least eight
Stanford Stadium records will be
threatened this weekend in a meet which
will feature a throng of Olympic aspirants.

"For thesecond year in a row, Foster was
instrumental in breaking their backs," said
coach Payton Jordan after the meet.
Stanford had turned around last year's
meet with Oxy when Foster, normally a
hurdler, won the high jump. Saturday even
ing he did it again.
Foster opened his meet by equaling the
meet record in the 120-yard high hurdles
with a 14.1 win. By the time Foster lined up
for the 440-yard intermediate hurdles, how
ever, Oxy had made the meet much tighter
than the Robber Barons had hoped by
sweeping all three spots in the half-mile.
In command
But the senior from Los Altos put Stan
ford in command by running a 53.5 in the
intermediates tobeata field which included
Gene Taylor, last year's runner-up in the
NCAA finals. Taylor appeared winded from
his earlier victory in the 440-yard dash, and
finished a slow 56.1.
Foster finished his day garnering his 11th
point by picking up a third in the high jump
with a leap of 6-foot-2.
Foster's heroics were complimented by
those of Holmes and San
doval.
Holmes earned Stanford's Most Competi
tive Point Winner award last spring and it is
going to be harder than hell for him not to be
a repeat winner if he has any more days like
Saturday. Holmes won the 100 and 220 in

addition to running the initial leg on Stan
ford's winning 440-yard relay team (40.9).
Dean of distance
Sandoval, not generally called on to dou
ble, proved again why he is the dean of
Stanford's distance running corps.
After winning the mile with a 4:10.3, the
senior from Los Alamos, N.M., came back
and ran a lifetime best in the two-mile. San
doval's eight-lap time of 8:47.4 featured a
4:17 second mile and was a meet record.
Roy Kissin broke Stacy Geiken's year-old
frosh record in the two-mile with a third
place time of 8:58.8. However, Geiken was
doing his own record-breaking.
Geiken set a meet record in the opening
race, the 3000-meter steeplechase, with a
personal best of 9:08.4. Geiken now replaces
teammate Jack Bellah as the third fastest
steeplechaser in Stanford track history.
Meanwhile, Bellah stav ed off a challenge
by Oxy's Jon Sisler on the last lap to finish
second. Sisler, who has a best of 9:03,
finished third with a time identical to Bel
lah's, 9:10.2.
All aces
In the quarter-mile, the Barons played all
their aces, and nearly lost their whole ante.
Stanford lined up James Lofton, Scott
Wingo and Matt Hogsett for the one lap
dash.
But Taylor, who was fresh at that time (in
contrast to his effort later in the inter
mediate hurdles) took the field with a 47.7.
Oxy's Sam Young edged Lofton for a second
place with 48.3.
And while Lofton's 48.4 was only good
for third in the44o, his winning long jump
of 24-9 was representative of an evening of

field event successes.
John Macrorie won the javelin with a
throw of 219-2. The mark was his personal
best. Sophomore Tom Ellis took second
with a fling of 182-6V2. Jordan said Ellis
appears to be physically and mentally ready
to break the 200-foot barrier in the near fu
ture.
Five points
Bob Flint picked up five points for the
Barons by winning the pole vault with a
vault of 16-0.
Mark Hill captured the discus with a
lifetime best of 167-3.
Freshmen Brad Slinkard. Kent Doyle and
Clay Bullwinkel all had key second place
finishes in their field event specialties.
Slinkard had a put of 52-10 3 /4 in the shot,
and Doyle had a 6-4 high jump effort.
Bullwinkel triple jumped 45-OV4, only a
quarter of an inch short of the winning
mark.
The Barons concluded the meet by win
ning the mile relay in what may have been
the most contested race of the evening.
Stanford's team of Wingo, Mark Hadley,
J'aul McCarthy and Lofton continually ex
changed the lead with the Oxy quartet.
It was finally left to Lofton, competing in
his fourth event of the day, to seal the fate of
Occidental. Lofton came from behind with a
47.3 anchor leg that gave Stanford a 10th of
a second margin of victory with a 3:16.4.
This weekend Stanford will host a double
dual meet which will pit the Barons against
UCLA, Cal against (JSC. At least eight
Stanford Stadium records will be
threatened this weekend in a meet which
will feature a throng of Olympic aspirants.
On the strength of double wins by Marvin
Holmes, Tony Sandoval and John Foster,
Stanford's cindermen emerged as 90-64
winners from their Saturday night show
down with Occidental.

hurdler, won the high jump. Saturday even
ing he did it again.
Foster opened his meet by equaling the
meet record in the 120-yard high hurdles
with a 14.1 win. By the time Foster lined up
for the 440-yard intermediate hurdles, how
ever, Oxy had made the meet much tighter
than the Robber Barons had hoped by
sweeping all three spots in the half-mile.
In command
But the senior from Los Altos put Stan
ford in command by running a 53.5 in the
intermediates tobeata field which included
Gene Taylor, last year's runner-up in the
NCAA finals. Taylor appeared winded from
his earlier victory in the 440-yard dash, and
finished a slow 56.1.
Foster finished his day garnering his 11th
point by picking up a third in the high jump
with a leap of 6-foot-2.
Foster's heroics were complimented by
those of Holmes and San
doval.
Holmes earned Stanford's Most Competi
tive Point Winner award last spring and it is
going to be harder than hell for him not to be
a repeat winner if he has any more days like
Saturday. Holmes won the 100 and 220 in

addition to running the initial leg on Stan
ford's winning 440-yard relay team (40.9).
Dean of distance
Sandoval, not generally called on to dou
ble, proved again why he is the dean of
Stanford's distance running corps.
After winning the mile with a 4:10.3, the
senior from Los Alamos, N.M., came back
and ran a lifetime best in the two-mile. San
doval's eight-lap time of 8:47.4 featured a
4:17 second mile and was a meet record.
Roy Kissin broke Stacy Geiken's year-old
frosh record in the two-mile with a third
place time of 8:58.8. However, Geiken was
doing his own record-breaking.
Geiken set a meet record in the opening
race, the 3000-meter steeplechase, with a
personal best of 9:08.4. Geiken now replaces
teammate Jack Bellah as the third fastest
steeplechaser in Stanford track history.
Meanwhile, Bellah stav ed off a challenge
by Oxy's Jon Sisler on the last lap to finish
second. Sisler, who has a best of 9:03,
finished third with a time identical to Bel
lah's, 9:10.2.
All aces
In the quarter-mile, the Barons played all
their aces, and nearly lost their whole ante.
Stanford lined up James Lofton, Scott
Wingo and Matt Hogsett for the one lap
dash.
But Taylor, who was fresh at that time (in
contrast to his effort later in the inter
mediate hurdles) took the field with a 47.7.
Oxy's Sam Young edged Lofton for a second
place with 48.3.
And while Lofton's 48.4 was only good
for third in the44o, his winning long jump
of 24-9 was representative of an evening of

field event successes.
John Macrorie won the javelin with a
throw of 219-2. The mark was his personal
best. Sophomore Tom Ellis took second
with a fling of 182-6V2. Jordan said Ellis
appears to be physically and mentally ready
to break the 200-foot barrier in the near fu
ture.
Five points
Bob Flint picked up five points for the
Barons by winning the pole vault with a
vault of 16-0.
Mark Hill captured the discus with a
lifetime best of 167-3.
Freshmen Brad Slinkard. Kent Doyle and
Clay Bullwinkel all had key second place
finishes in their field event specialties.
Slinkard had a put of 52-10 3 /4 in the shot,
and Doyle had a 6-4 high jump effort.
Bullwinkel triple jumped 45-OV4, only a
quarter of an inch short of the winning
mark.
The Barons concluded the meet by win
ning the mile relay in what may have been
the most contested race of the evening.
Stanford's team of Wingo, Mark Hadley,
J'aul McCarthy and Lofton continually ex
changed the lead with the Oxy quartet.
It was finally left to Lofton, competing in
his fourth event of the day, to seal the fate of
Occidental. Lofton came from behind with a
47.3 anchor leg that gave Stanford a 10th of
a second margin of victory with a 3:16.4.
This weekend Stanford will host a double
dual meet which will pit the Barons against
UCLA, Cal against (JSC. At least eight
Stanford Stadium records will be
threatened this weekend in a meet which
will feature a throng of Olympic aspirants.
On the strength of double wins by Marvin
Holmes, Tony Sandoval and John Foster,
Stanford's cindermen emerged as 90-64
winners from their Saturday night show
down with Occidental.
"For thesecond year in a row, Foster was
instrumental in breaking their backs," said
coach Payton Jordan after the meet.
