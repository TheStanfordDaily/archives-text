## Yanks, Royals to win 
### Bob Dean 
Last year the American League provided the
only exciting race in baseball. This year more of
the same can be expected. With several recruits
from the National League and the maturity of a
super 1975 rookie crop, both divisions may not
be decided until October. In the meantime
here's how the dogfights should end up.
Eastern division
The Yankees are one part of New York that
isn't in trouble. After two years of laboring in
cognito at Shea Stadium, the Bronx Bombers
return home to refurbished Yankee Stadium.
With them they'll bring four new players: Wil
lie Randolph, Dock (Curlers) Ellis, Ed Figueroa,
and Mickey Rivers, all of whom could put
pinstripes back in style.
Only segregation is more popular in Boston
than the Red Sox. With a projected 2.8 million
maniacs jamming the turnstiles at cozy Fenway
Park, the Sox' biggest problem could be finding
enough seats. Meanwhile manager Darrell
Johnson is keeping his fingers crossed that
gems Fred Lynn and Jim Rice don't have
sophomore slumps, and that newly acquired
Fergy Jenkins has left his gopher ball in Texas.
If the Orioles can dangle enough money in
front of Reggie Jackson, they may find them
selves in the World Series. Baltimore has a bad
habit of getting off to slow starts and then play
ing its best ball the last two months. This year
it'll need a quick jump to stay with Boston and
New York, and with aging Brooks Robinson at
third and ageless Mike Cuellar on the mound
that could be tough.
In the eyes of all uniform connoisseurs,
Cleveland is one of the league's most solid
teams. Even Pierre Cardin would approve of the
Tribe's double knits. Yet Frank Robinson needs
able bodies to fill his wardrobe, pitcher Dennis
Eckersley and outfielder George Hendrick may
not be enough. As for veterans Rico Carty and
Boog Powell, their modeling days are num
bered.
Detroit pulled the biggest payola this winter
since Motown Records when it picked up Rusty
Staub. Pillsbury Doughboy Mickey Lolich had
gone stale and the Tigers were able to swap him
for some badly needed punch. Yet Staub and
gimpy Willie Horton can only do so much for
1975's worst team.
Milwaukee was the only club that made a
conscious effort not to improve itself. During
the offseason it made zero trades, after finish
ing 28 games off the pace. The only fresh face is
manager Alex Grammas who may decide to go
back to Cincinnati and collect playoff checks
after he sees the Brewers. Young Robin Yount

and Big Daddy George Scott need help. And
after 22 years Hank Aaron is a bit passe.
Western division
Sports fans in Kansas City have weathered a
tough year. Their football Chiefs were anemic,
the Scouts seemed to concentrate on camping
rather than hockey, and the Kings were the
court jesters of the NBA. Yet this summer
baseball fans on the Missouri may see some post
season action in their sparkling stadium. With
youngsters George Brett and John Mayberry at
the corners and Amos Otis in center, K.C.'s
drought may be over.
It's hard to imagine the Oakland A's without
Reggie Jackson. It's as if Jimmy Carter lost his
teeth: the bite is gone. But now the dust has
settled following the shocking swap, lovable
Charlie O. may have made quite a deal. He got a
young slugger in Don Baylor and a potential
20-game winner in Mike Torrez, and the real
sleeper is Paul Mitchell who was 10-1 in the
minors. New skipper Chuck Tanner rivals only
Dale Carnegie when it comes to optimism. He
should have no trouble handling the rowdy A's.
Big question marks are Sal Bando, Mike Norris
and Claudell Washington's fielding. Somebody
should send him a compass, to help navigate.
Even if Chicago loses 100 games this sum
mer, you still gotta love 'em. With Minnie
Minoso in clamdiggers, midget batsmen,
promotions galore all on natural turf, Bill
Veeck's White Sox should draw their one-time
fans out of the woodwork. Veeck hopes to rein
carnate the old go-go days with the likes of
Ralph Garr, Jorge Orta and Pat Kelly. His biggest
problem may be finding enough fireworks.
Sentimentally speaking Texas is a great team.
It's full of ex-stars: Jim Fregosi, Gaylord Perry,
Bill Singer, Nelson Briles and perhaps Jeff Bur
roughs. This nostalgia collection has seen bet
ter days. Unless the Rangers can hire George
Allen to coach the Geritol Guys, the Rangers
may only rival Houston as the state's worst.
If Bobby Bonds and his strange lifestyle can
cope with Orange County, California may be
ready to move up from the depths of hell. Man
ager Dick Williams traded a lot of speed and
pitching for two home run hitters (Bonds and
Bill Melton). Nolan Ryan and Frank Tanana are
quite a pair, but the Angels will still need every
prayer they can get.
Minnesota's siamese Twins are hurting.
Aside from Rod Carew and Bert Blyleven, their
roster is a trivia contest. The Twins do have a
new manager. Gene Mauch who finally ran out
of prophecies in Montreal. The only relic from
Minnesota glory years is Tony Oliva, but after
several knee operations he even has trouble
legging out his infrequent home runs.
