Crew 4
Crew teams from Stanford
swept to wins in eight of nine
races in weekend competition at
the Belmont course.
The Robber Barons competed
in the Conn Findley Cup on
Saturday, rowing against USC
and Santa Cara.
Stanford stroked to a two
length victory over the Trojans
in the varsity eights, covering
the 2000 meter course in 6:40.
The rowers added wins in the
JV and freshman eights and in
the women's fours. The
freshmen beat USC by 12 lengths
after a Trojan oarsman broke his
paddle.
The crews vied against Long
Beach State yesterday, with the
varsity, JV's and freshman eights
all winning.
In the varsity race, the Robber
Barons trailed Long Beach until
the 1000 meter mark where they
increased the tempo and gradu
ally pulled away to take the race.
The Stanford rowers will next
be in action on April 23, when
they meet UCLA.
Church drafted
Linebacker Ceb Church and
center Todd Anderson were the
only Stanford football players
selected in the National Football

League's annual college draft,
which ended Friday.
Church was taken in the ninth
round by the Los Angeles Rams.
He was the 266 th player selected
in the two-day draft. The Rams
plan to use the 6-foot-3 215-
pound Church as a defensive
back.
"We thought about putting
him there," said Card coach Jack
Christiansen. "It'll be a big
change for him to play in the
backfield. 1 think he's going
down there on Thursday to talk
to the Rams," said Christiansen.
The New England Patriots
took Anderson in the 17th round
of the draft.
While the selection of Ander
son came as a surprise, the fact
that place kicker Mike Langford
was ignored by the pro pickers
came as a shock to many know
ledgeable Stanford watchers.
"Maybe they were concerned
with his kickoffs," said Chris
tiansen, "but he did some good
kicking for us." 1
Christiansen and Sports In
formation Director Cary Cavalli
speculated that the hero of the
1974 Big Came will probably
sign as a free agent.
Lacrosse
The Card lacrosse squad
whacked USC 21-5 in a contest

yesterday at Stanford.
The team jumped out to a 13-3
halftime lead and coasted to an
easy win.
Larry Wexler and Whitt Budge
each tallied three goals to pace
Stanford.
Night swimming
Stanford students will no
longer have to sneak over the
fence to swim in the DeCuerre
pools at night.
A proposal to open up the
pools for evening swimming
was approved last week by James
Lyons, dean of student affairs.
A surplus of funds, originally
allocated for equipment use and
the hiring of lifeguards at Lake
Lagunita, makes the move pos
sible.
Starting tomorrow, the pools
will be open for nighttime use on
Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday evenings from 7 to 10
p.m.

month.

selected in the National Football

League's annual college draft,
which ended Friday.
Church was taken in the ninth
round by the Los Angeles Rams.
He was the 266 th player selected
in the two-day draft. The Rams
plan to use the 6-foot-3 215-
pound Church as a defensive
back.
"We thought about putting
him there," said Card coach Jack
Christiansen. "It'll be a big
change for him to play in the
backfield. 1 think he's going
down there on Thursday to talk
to the Rams," said Christiansen.
The New England Patriots
took Anderson in the 17th round
of the draft.
While the selection of Ander
son came as a surprise, the fact
that place kicker Mike Langford
was ignored by the pro pickers
came as a shock to many know
ledgeable Stanford watchers.
"Maybe they were concerned
with his kickoffs," said Chris
tiansen, "but he did some good
kicking for us." 1
Christiansen and Sports In
formation Director Cary Cavalli
speculated that the hero of the
1974 Big Came will probably
sign as a free agent.
Lacrosse
The Card lacrosse squad
whacked USC 21-5 in a contest

yesterday at Stanford.
The team jumped out to a 13-3
halftime lead and coasted to an
easy win.
Larry Wexler and Whitt Budge
each tallied three goals to pace
Stanford.
Night swimming
Stanford students will no
longer have to sneak over the
fence to swim in the DeCuerre
pools at night.
A proposal to open up the
pools for evening swimming
was approved last week by James
Lyons, dean of student affairs.
A surplus of funds, originally
allocated for equipment use and
the hiring of lifeguards at Lake
Lagunita, makes the move pos
sible.
Starting tomorrow, the pools
will be open for nighttime use on
Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday evenings from 7 to 10
p.m.
