# Card nine tops Santa Barbara
## 
### George Anders 
Improved pitching made up
for weak hitting, as the Stanford
baseball team swept a three
game series from UC-Santa Bar
bara this weekend at Sunken
Diamond.
The Cards opened with a 4-3
win Friday, then took both
games of a doubleheader Sun
day, 3-1 and 1-0, as freshman
Rob Irwin pitched a three hit
shutout in the second game.
"I don't think we were particu
larly impressive in any of the
games," Card coach Ray Young
said yesterday evening. "We're
pleased to get three wins,
though."
The Cards staved off a three
ninth inning run Santa Barbara
rally in Friday's game, as Bernie
Hittner came in to get the last
two outs.
Bruce Fiala went the distance
in Sunday's opener, allowing
only four hits. However, Young
pointed out that Fiala walked six
batters.
"He was nervous, and he was
pointing for the game," Young
added. "In the first innings he
didn't have good rhythm. In the
fourth he loosened up, and he
got tired in the last two innings."
In the bottom of the ninth, the
first two Santa Barbara batters
got on. Young went out to talk to
Fiala, but left him in, later exp
laining that Fiala would have
been taken out with only a 2-1
lead.
A double play and a ground
out quickly ended the inning
and the game.
Irwin breezed through the
second game, striking out six,
and allowing only one runner to
advance past first. Three Card

double plays wiped out Santa
Barbara's scoring chances.
The Cards scored in the
seventh inning, when Cary
Pitchford singled in Kevin
Triggs.
With one out, Triggs had
walked, and then stole second.
Larry Reynolds followed by
reaching first on a dropped third
strike, as Santa Barbara catcher
Stewart Bringhurst's throw hit
Reynolds in the back.
A fielders choice by Pepe
Hinojosa advanced Triggs to
third, where he scored on the
single.
Triggs had delivered the game
winning hit in the first game; a
fifth inning double scoring Dave
Perez.
However, Young said he was
undecided whether to move
Triggs, a substitute most of the
season, into the regular lineup.
"It'll be on a day-in day-out
basis," the coach explained. "I'll
have to get a feel for what he's
doing."
The Cards made six errors in
the first game, including four by
third baseman Gary Pitchford.
"He zeroed in over there,"
Young said, "and then he got
keyed up."
Friday's game saw the brief re
turn of MikeCodiroli, Stanford's
leading hitter, who had been out
of the lineup for several weeks.
Codiroli got a double, but.
Young said, "he couldn't accel
erate at all," and will be out of
the lineup again.
The weekend sweep raised the
Cards' record in the California
Intercollegiate Baseball Associa
tion to 5-4.
Young cautioned that "1 don't
think the league race can be de
termined this early," but added,
"We're certainly not out of it."
