# Men golfers seek more depth
## 
### Chris Kamel 
A lack of depth hurt Stanford's
men's golf team, as it finished
eighth in a field of 12 at the
Fresno Golf Classic last weekend
with a team score of 1413.
The Cards' top three golfers all
placed near the top of the field.
Mike Peck finished eighth indi
vidually with a 54 hole total of
222. Jay Johnston was 10th with
223, and Glenn Goethals turned
in a 232.
Examining the scores of the
remaining players on his six
man team, Stanford coach Bud
Finger concluded. "We just
don't have that fourth man."
Kim Carter and Ray Navis both
shot 2445, and Bob Blum carded
a 248, to finish back in the pack.
"Right now we are only play
ing with three men," Finger as
serted, "and when you plan in a
tournament where six scores
count you are not going to get
very far."
According to Finger, the team
has been crippled by insufficient
recruiting, and the effects are
now beginning to surface. He
explained that in a tournament
strong performances by two or
three players on the team can be
more than offset by poor rounds
from the remaining members of
the squad.
Stanford's team score was 86
strokes more than tournament

winner Brigham Young.

ment includes a 26-team field
including the 12 of the Fresno
Classic.
"These 12 will be the strength

of the Intercollegiate champion
ships," Finger said, "but that
still doesn't do us any good. We
will need much stronger per
formances from our fourth, fifth
and sixth men before we are con
sidered serious contenders for
anything."
