Lebanese cease-fire extended
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Leftist Moslem leaders agreed
last night to extend the shaky cease-fire until the end
of April to give more time for a political settlement in
Lebanon's year-long civil war.
Overall Moslem chieftain Kamel Jumblatt called for a
"freeze' in Syrian, French and American mediation at least
until parliament elects a replacement for President
Suleiman Franjieh. The Syrian-imposed truce was to have
ended at noon today, 2 a.m. PST.
"But even then, the cease-fire can never be endless,"
said Ibrahim Koleilat, leader of Jumblatt's largest leftist
militia, the Ambushers. "Unless Franjieh's replacement is
completed shortly, we will have to decide the situation on
the basis of a victor and a vanquished."
Parliament amended the constitution Saturday to allow
immediate election of a new president. But Franjieh, a
stubborn Maronite Christian, has yet to sign the amend
ment as required by law and has given no public indica
tion whether he will actually step down even if Parliament
elects a replacement.
Strike negotiations resumed
SAN FRANCISCO — Negotiations resumed yesterday
in an effort to settle a 12-day-old strike by municipal
employes which has halted public transportation and
other city services.
Negotiators for the city and 10 craft unions met for four
hours before breaking for lunch. No results of the talks
were announced.
The unions, representing about 1900 of San Francisco's
18,000 employes, struck March 31 in a dispute over $5.7
million in voter-mandated pay cuts. A carpenter's pay, for
example, would be reduced from $21,800 to $17,240
while a street sweeper's salary would be cut from $17,300
to between $12,000 and $14,000.
Although drivers for the Municipal Railway did not
strike, they agreed to honor union picket lines, halting
transportation for 250,000 people daily.
The strike has closed the city zoo, playgrounds, the
botanical garden, swimming poolsand museums. Thereis
no heat or hot water in most city buildings nor at San
Francisco International Airport.
Hearst as prosecution witness?
SAN FRANCISCO — Patricia Hearst, facing a possible

maximum sentence of 25 years in prison, is willing to
testify about the criminal activities of her one-time under
ground associates to lighten her own sentence, sources
said.
However, Hearst's attorneys, declining comment
on her future as a prosecution witness, said Sunday they
will stress her frail emotional and physical health in seek
ing her immediate release on probation.
"Patty is emotionally and physically drained," said at
torney Al Johnson. He indicated that Hearst's mental
state has deteriorated since her conviction March 20 but
declined to elaborate.
Johnson said the 22-year-old Hearst's main fear
right now is of a heavy prison sentence.
"She's apprehensive, concerned, worried that the judge
might sentence her to an institution" Johnson said.
He said he and partner F. Lee Bailey,who will plead for
mercy at Hearst's sentencing hearing this morn
ing, will stress her original status as a kidnap victim of the
terrorist Symbionese Liberation Army.
Chinese protest rallies continue
TOKYO — China's army vowed to "deal resolute
blows" to supporters of ousted Vice Premier Teng Hsiao
ping, as mass rallies condemning him spread to five
Chinese provinces, Peking broadcasts said yesterday.
"From offices to barracks, from sea islands to frontier
outposts, a revolutionary atmosphere of unity in struggle
now prevails in these People's Revolutionary Army units
stationed across the country," the official Hsinhua news
agency said.
The agency added that mass rallies against Teng were
held in Shansi, Honan, Shensi, Yunnan and Shantung
provinces in the past few days, attended by workers, sol
diers, women and peasants. As many as 300,000 attended
some rallies, the agency said.
The broadcast quoted Liu Hsing-yuan, commander of
Chengtu units, as saying the struggle would go on to a
greater depth, meaning there still were backers to Teng's
policies to be won over or purged.
