# ASSU Senate may have illegally approved SJC
## 
### John Freed Dan Fiduccia 
The Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
was apparently approved last spring
by the ASSU Senate in violation of the
ASSU Constitution.
The SJC, which hears all student
disciplinary cases, came into existence
at the beginning of this year after the
ASSU Senate, the Faculty Senate and
President Richard Lyman approved its
creation last spring.
The ASSU Senate's action appears
to have violated Article IV, Section 1 of
the ASSU Constitution, which reads:
"The Association (ASSU) shall rec
ognize the authority of university jud

icial bodies over members of the As
sociation only if those judicial bodies
shall have been approved by two
thirds of those members of the Associ
ation voting in a general election."
No two-thirds
In a referendum last spring, the SJC
concept was approved by 769 voters
and rejected by 635, with 1076 absten
tions â€” far short of the necessary two
thirds majority.
ASSU Vice President Josie Jaramillo
said the SJC, lacking student approval,
is not legitimate. The same charge had
been leveled at the old Campus Judi
cial Panel (CJP), established by Lyman
in 1971 when the ASSU Senate refused

to nominate members to the judicial
body operating at the time.
"As far as the students are con
cerned, it (the SJC) certainly is il
legitimate," Jaramillo said last night.
Legitimacy
ASSU Vice President Charlotte
Germane said the University should
have a system legitimized by students.
"1 think it's important to have a sys
tem which has been justly ratified. 1
think it's important for the health of
the University and of the judicial sys
tem," Germane said.
The Council of Presidents (COP),
which includes ASSU President Lee
Rosenbaum, Vice President Dave Gal
ligan, Jaramillo and Cermane, issued
no formal statement on the matter last
night because Gal ligan could not be
reached.
'Veto' power
However, Galligan said earlier that
he was in favor of declaring the SJC
illegitimate. One way to do this within
the ASSU Constitution would be for
Rosenbaum to "veto" the Senate's ap
proval of the SJC.
"I'd be perfectly willing to do
it ... It (the veto) sounds fine to me,"
Galligan said.
Rosenbaum said the matter will be
taken up at tomorrow night's ASSU
Senate meeting.
Action expected
"I'm sure action will be taken this
week," he commented.
Germane said the senate should
have obeyed its constitution.
"I think the senate made a stupid
mistake" last spring, she said. "I think
it's important for the senate not to rein
terpret the constitution . . . They
should stick to a two-thirds majority
vote."
Reconvene C-15
If the senate ratification is declared
illegal, the SJC will go out of existence,
which, according to the Legislative
and Judicial Charter of IMGB, will re
quire the Committee of 15 (C-15) to
reconvene.
The COP has been attempting to
get the C-15 to reconvene since late
February.
"Since Lyman has been refusing to
reconvene the C-15, this will force him
to act," Jaramillo declared.
Late in game?
James Siena, legal adviser to the
president, said any invalidation of the
SJC now would be "a little late in the
game."
Lyman will reinstitute the SJC if the
senate's action is ruled illegal, Siena
said.
"There is a judicial system in effect,
and it's the one we're going to use,"
Siena commented.
Internal problem
The administration will not get in
volved in internal ASSU constitu
tional questions, he said.
"The last thing we the administra
tion are going to get involved in is in
terpreting the ASSU Constitution," he
said.
Assoc. Political Science Prof.
Jonathan Casper, faculty co-chairman
of the SJC, said he had "no immediate
reaction."
'Astounded'
Janice Haney, ASSU Senate chair
person when the ratification went
through, said she was "astounded"
that the question of a two-thirds major
ity had not come up in senate debate.
"I'm almost positive we didn't know
about it," Hanev said.
