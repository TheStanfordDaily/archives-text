# Stanford Shopping Center expansion plans approved
## 
### Roy S. Johnson 
The plans for the proposed expan
sion of the Stanford Shopping Center
were approved last Thursday night by
the Palo Alto Architectural Review
Board (ARB). Also accepted was an
"environmental impact report" de
signed to point out some of the effects
of the expansion.
The University has proposed to add
approximately 200,000 square feet of
floor space to the existing shopping
center which now has about 1 million
square feet of building area.
The hearing with the ARB was at
tended by about 35 people from the
local community, most of whom
voiced opposition to the proposed ex
pansion.
Most of the expressed complaints
were concerned with the increased
traffic and air pollution.
The impact report, issued earlier last
month, indicated that the most impor

tant side-effect of the proposed expan
sion would be in the area of traffic. It
estimated that the average volume of
traffic would be increased by about 22
percent.
Traffic problem
Marsha Rector, a Palo Alto resident
who lives near Embarcadero, pointed
out that the traffic problem on that
road is already serious and any expan
sion of the center would only aggra
vate the problem.
The expansion would tend to make
the center a regional shopping com
plex rather than a community one,
much like Eastridge Mall in San Jose or
the San Antonio complex in Mountain
View, some said.
ARB member Derk Vyn pointed out
that the only east-west accesses to El
Camino from Highway 101 are Embar
cadero and the Oregon Expressway.
Without major widening, these roads
would be unable to handle the in
creased volume of traffic attempting to
get to the center from the highway.
Another irate citizen pointed out
that the ARB had no power in the mat

ter. He cited Title 19 of the Master Plan
of Palo Alto, which states: "All matters
affecting the development of the city
shall be directed to the Planning
Commission."
Asst. City Attorney Lou Green re
sponded that the title was left open to
interpretation at the discretion of the
city attorney. The board, which
seemed wary of his response to the
citizens' statements, was obliged to
adhere to his decision.
Individual reviews
After closing the public hearing,
members of the ARB individually re
viewed and commented on the report.
Vyn was the only one opposed to the
report. He said that many of the figures
quoted in the report were based on
"educated guesses," and added that
further studies should be made, espe
cially in the traffic area, to determine
the more exact effect of the expansion.
His statements were to no avail,
however, as every other member of the
board voiced their approval as to the
sufficiency of the report. It was there
fore accepted.
