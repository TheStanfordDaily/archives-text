# Stewart hears Moot Court
## 
### Marc Strassman 
The Stanford Moot Court, sitting
as the United States Supreme Court
in the 24th Annual Marion Rice
Kirkwood Competition, heard ar
guments Friday afternoon in Kresge
Auditorium on the question:
"Whether seizure of contraband in
an airport search made on less than
probable cause violates the Fourth
Amendment."
The court consisted of Potter
Stewart, associate justice of the Un
ited States Supreme Court; Frank
Richardson, associate justice of the
California Supreme Court; and
Constance Motley. United States
district court judge for the Southern
District of New York.
ludging on the basis of written
briefs and oral presentation, the
court decided that A. Randall Fri
day had been the best overall advo
cate and Michael Shepard was the
second best overall advocate. Fri
day was judged the author of the
best brief.
The case under discussion in
volved a hypothetical individual
who was searched bv an air mar

shall at Mantra Airport because he
was suspected of being a potential
hijacker.
The marshall's search turned up
no weapons, but did result in the
discovery of a pouch full of cocaine,
which led to the person's convic
tion on a charge of drug possession.
An appeals court then overturned
the conviction on the grounds that
the cocaine should not have been
admissible evidence because the
search was improper. Counsel for
the Covernment Steven Kenninger
argued that there were reasonable
grounds for the search, because the
individual had "acted nervously
and suspiciously" and fit the
hijacker profile.
Kenninger argued that the prin
ciples of Terry v. Ohio, which al
lows searches for less than probable
cause in certain circumstances, jus
tified the search and that a decision
allowing for administrative
searches justified the procedure.
Friday, arguing against the valid
ity of the search, said that "the
specific and articulatable facts re-

quired under Terry v. Ohio" were
not present. "Nervousness and er
roneous fitting of a profile are not
sufficiently probative" of intention
to hijack a plane, he said.
He asked the court to expand the
exclusionary rule to airport
weapons searches, and to rule out
"pretextual searches."
Stephen Leach, arguing for the
government, contended that the
tremendous threat to life and prop
erty posed by hijacking required
that "any doubts in the matter
should be resolved in favor of al
lowing searches."
He argued that the individual's
only having had one form of iden
tification "set him still farther apart
from the great mass of airplane pas
sengers" and provided additional
justification for the search.
Leach concluded with a reference
to "the grave need for a program to
protect our enormous flying popu
lation." and asked that the coi.rt
overrule the appellate decision be
cause "it would overthrow the pre
sent highly effective system."

admissible evidence because the
search was improper. Counsel for
the Covernment Steven Kenninger
argued that there were reasonable
grounds for the search, because the
individual had "acted nervously
and suspiciously" and fit the
hijacker profile.
Kenninger argued that the prin
ciples of Terry v. Ohio, which al
lows searches for less than probable
cause in certain circumstances, jus
tified the search and that a decision
allowing for administrative
searches justified the procedure.
Friday, arguing against the valid
ity of the search, said that "the
specific and articulatable facts re-

quired under Terry v. Ohio" were
not present. "Nervousness and er
roneous fitting of a profile are not
sufficiently probative" of intention
to hijack a plane, he said.
He asked the court to expand the
exclusionary rule to airport
weapons searches, and to rule out
"pretextual searches."
Stephen Leach, arguing for the
government, contended that the
tremendous threat to life and prop
erty posed by hijacking required
that "any doubts in the matter
should be resolved in favor of al
lowing searches."
He argued that the individual's
only having had one form of iden
tification "set him still farther apart
from the great mass of airplane pas
sengers" and provided additional
justification for the search.
Leach concluded with a reference
to "the grave need for a program to
protect our enormous flying popu
lation." and asked that the coi.rt
overrule the appellate decision be
cause "it would overthrow the pre
sent highly effective system."

THE QUESTION IS MOOT—Supreme Court Assoc. lustice Potter Stewart
was on campus last week as a member of the moot court of the Marion
Rice Kirkwoocl Competition, an event siMinsored hy the Stanford Moot Court.
The Stanford Moot Court, sitting
as the United States Supreme Court
in the 24th Annual Marion Rice
Kirkwood Competition, heard ar
guments Friday afternoon in Kresge
Auditorium on the question:
"Whether seizure of contraband in
an airport search made on less than
probable cause violates the Fourth
Amendment."
The court consisted of Potter
Stewart, associate justice of the Un
ited States Supreme Court; Frank
Richardson, associate justice of the
California Supreme Court; and
Constance Motley. United States
district court judge for the Southern
District of New York.
ludging on the basis of written
briefs and oral presentation, the
court decided that A. Randall Fri
day had been the best overall advo
cate and Michael Shepard was the
second best overall advocate. Fri
day was judged the author of the
best brief.
The case under discussion in
volved a hypothetical individual
who was searched bv an air mar

shall at Mantra Airport because he
was suspected of being a potential
hijacker.
The marshall's search turned up
no weapons, but did result in the
discovery of a pouch full of cocaine,
which led to the person's convic
tion on a charge of drug possession.
An appeals court then overturned
the conviction on the grounds that
the cocaine should not have been
admissible evidence because the
search was improper. Counsel for
the Covernment Steven Kenninger
argued that there were reasonable
grounds for the search, because the
individual had "acted nervously
and suspiciously" and fit the
hijacker profile.
Kenninger argued that the prin
ciples of Terry v. Ohio, which al
lows searches for less than probable

tified the search and that a decision
