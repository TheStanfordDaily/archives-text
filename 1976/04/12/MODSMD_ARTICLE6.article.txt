## Fine arts' moral rights 
### 
Doug Bryant

I would like to clarify some of the problems
raised by Richard Fearon in his April 5 Daily
column condemning the "Artist's right to integ
rity of his work." That discussion confused a
number of issues, each of which might better be
understood if mentioned separately.
Namely the issues are: censorship in the televi
sion industry; a performing artist's contract
rights; the artist's right of integrity in the fine arts;
and the distinctions separating performing art
(the Pythons) from fine art (unique objects and
multiples) from commercial art (mass produced
objects of manufacture).
Under current U.S. law. the rights to all three
types of art are governed by property or contract
law, under which mere possession entitles the
owner to censor, suppress or destroy a work un
less he has specifically agreed otherwise. In
France, Italy and a dozen other countries, how
ever,the finearts have been singled out for special
protection because of their more serious purpose
and cultural significance.
In those countries an art object is considered a
means of expression, a type of two- or three
dimensional frozen speech protected by the right
of integrity, or "moral right," just as we protect
speech through First Amendment freedom. To
allow the possessor of the object to distort its
message would violate the artist's freedom of ex-

pression by attributing something to him which
he had not intended or by suppressing the expres
sion altogether.
The Pythons lost their suit because neither the
United States nor England has yet adopted the
moral right, and even under such a right, the per
forming arts are excluded. Protection of their in
tegrity should have been secured by contract, and
they apparently failed to do this.
Certainly, because the moral right applies only
to finearts. there would be line-drawing problems
for the U.S. courts if this country incorporates
such protection in its forthcoming copyright law
revision. Marcel Duchamp blurred the distinction
between fine and commercial arts in the 1920s
with his "found" art and "ready-mades."
And the French auteur film directors have as
serted their ability to transform the performing
arts into fine art, blurring that distinction as well.
Hut the courts have proved capable of complex
line-drawing in corporate law areas, and distinc
tions among the arts should be no more difficult to
maintain.
The French courts have not found it difficult to
distinguish. Certainly any difficulty here would
be insufficient reason to bar the right altogether,
Fearon and Duchamp notwithstanding.
