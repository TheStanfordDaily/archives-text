# Howard slate avoids issues

Add another slate to the list of
joke slates running for this year's
Council of Presidents (COP):
Dan Howard-KeithArchuleta-
Liz√üyll-Bill Tyndall.After read
ing their vague and pretentious
"platform," one must laugh, or
else become outraged at the
practical joke being played on
the student body.
A quick review of the major
issues of the past year will reveal
a startling and tragic avoidance
of such issues by the so-called
"Howard slate".
Where, for instance, is there
any mention of the issue of stu
dent involvement in the tenure

process in the campaign state
ments of the Howard slate?
Again, where is there any re
levant proposal for dealing with
the all-important matter of the
evaluation of teaching, the stu
dents' most valuable means of
determining the quality of their
education?
A third example (and there
could be so many more) is where
is any specific mention of the
concerns of women students at
this University? Granted,
women students comprise less
than a majority of the Stanford
population, but how could the

"Howard slate" be so cynically
political to forget such a bloc of
their would-be constituency?
The students of this Univer
sity cannot afford such a lack of
representation on the important
issues that face them. We have
been "blessed" with one COP
after another who have forgotten
the needs of their constituents.
If we are to be considered re
sponsible and intelligent voters,
we must reject this form of poli
tics. We want action,not not
too-practical jokes.
