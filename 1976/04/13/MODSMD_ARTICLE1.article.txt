"I don't exactly know why you're
here, or why I'm here. Angela Davis is
doing it, so why shouldn't I?"
ASSU Guest Professor Claude
Steiner presented himself April 5 to a
crowded classroom with a casual
comment that set the tone for the two
hour introduction to the under
graduate special course, "Radical
Psychiatry," that he is teaching this
quarter. Calling himself "an entertain
ing speaker," lie quickly engaged the
attention of the attending students,
most of whom were upperclass wo
men.
Steiner emphasized his political
motives in accepting a guest profes
sorship at Stanford.
"I'm here because of my politics," he
announced. "I'm not a communist. I'm
not a socialist either, hut closer to that
than anything else. I'm a feminist,
democratic socialist."
I le added, however, that he was also
interested in the teaching aspect and
would present the class with an un
usual view of psychiatry.
"I'm going to show you, I hope, that
everything you know about psychiatry
needs to be re-examined," said
Steiner, adding that he would not use
traditional classroom procedure. He
dislikes a professor-student relation
ship in which the teacher has all the
power.
Equalize power
"I can't lecture to you from up here,"
he warned, jumping up on a desk in
the front of the classroom. "I want to
equalize the power here." He spent
nearly an hour getting acquainted with
his students, asking why they wanted
to take his course and what they hoped
to do with it.
Several students said they were at
tracted by Steiner's unique approach
to psychiatric research and
therapy,which is radically different
from the methods of study offered
here.
"There's nothing like this in the
Psychology Department," commented
one psych major. "Stanford is gener
ally behavioralist and experimen
talist."
Steiner's approach is to make the
student aware of power, which he per
ceives to be "an element of every
human transaction."
"If you don't understand power, you
don't understand oppression," said
Steiner. "All psychiatric disturbances
are one thing: alienation, which is the
result of oppression plus mystification
plus isolation. If you don't understand
power," he later explained, "you don't
understand oppression and don't un
derstand alienation."
'Non-lecture'
Steiner will give a two-hour "non
lecture" every Monday from 1:15 to
3:05 pm in Room 300. The course re
quirements include reading Steiner's
book on Transactional Analysis,
"Scripts People Live," and completing
an individual project. He suggested
that each student do a psychiatric his
tory of his family, digging up the facts
and examining them from both the
