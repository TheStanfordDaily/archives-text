# COP slates' final statements
## Howard, et al. 
### 
By now, one has probably heard, seen or
read about the four slates running for the
Council of Presidents (COP).
We would like to thank the Daily for its
endorsement on April 7. We believe that it
clearly defined the differences between the
four slates.
So, why should one vote for us? For that
matter, why should one vote for anyone?
If one has looked at the political games,
the posters, the smiling faces and are fed up
with the whole mess, he has good reason.
So if one doesn't vote, what happens?
The administration won't go away, that's
for sure. Its policies will be left to go unchal
lenged. We agree that the ASSU govern
ment is already too much of a joke in the
eyes of both the administration and stu
dents.
We feel that students can challenge Uni
versity policy when it is contrary to student
concerns. This takes effective and efficient
leadership and realistic approach to com
plicated problems.
We have given serious consideration to

the concerns of our community and feel that
we can provide what is needed.
Our slate does not promise sunshine and
blue skies. A vote of us will not guarantee
that nerds will disappear or that Lake Lag
will fill up.
If one reads our platform, he will see that
in addressing the various areas of concern
we have offered specific programs of action.
This is what separates our slate from the
others. We do not just see the problems, we
offer realistic ways of dealing with them.
Our philosophical underpinning may
appear idealistic. Yet, the record shows our
ability and willingness to work in whatever
way is necessary for student concerns.
The Report on the Committee on Under
graduate Admissions and Financial Aids,
co-authored by Dan Howard, has already
prompted two substantial results.
First, Stanford has changed its financial
aid policies toward transfer students so that
they are offered aid packages commensu
rate with that of other students. Also, the
committee has set up a sub-committee to

study the question of special admissions,
using non-traditional criteria for some stu
dents.
Liz Ry 11, graduate student in economics,
offers a very positive perspective to this
campaign. As an undergraduate at Smith,
she participated in tin; process which
placed a student on t ho Hoard of Trustees.
These are just a few examples of our suc
cess in altering University policy toward
students.
We feel we can successfully challenge the
University when it is in the best interest of
students. Only so much can he expected
from working within the present structure.
Therefore, we have emphasized that we
are willing to work outside the structure
when necessary.
What is needed is active and receptive
leadership. We will provide not only this
leadership, hut also a realistic approach and
common sense.

will fill up.
If one reads our platform, he will see that
in addressing the various areas of concern
we have offered specific programs of action.
This is what separates our slate from the
others. We do not just see the problems, we
offer realistic ways of dealing with them.
Our philosophical underpinning may
appear idealistic. Yet, the record shows our
ability and willingness to work in whatever
way is necessary for student concerns.
The Report on the Committee on Under
graduate Admissions and Financial Aids,
co-authored by Dan Howard, has already
prompted two substantial results.
First, Stanford has changed its financial
aid policies toward transfer students so that
they are offered aid packages commensu
rate with that of other students. Also, the
committee has set up a sub-committee to

study the question of special admissions,
using non-traditional criteria for some stu
dents.
Liz Ry 11, graduate student in economics,
offers a very positive perspective to this
campaign. As an undergraduate at Smith,
she participated in tin; process which
placed a student on t ho Hoard of Trustees.
These are just a few examples of our suc
cess in altering University policy toward
students.
We feel we can successfully challenge the
University when it is in the best interest of
students. Only so much can he expected
from working within the present structure.
Therefore, we have emphasized that we
are willing to work outside the structure
when necessary.
What is needed is active and receptive
leadership. We will provide not only this
leadership, hut also a realistic approach and
common sense.

By now, one has probably heard, seen or
read about the four slates running for the
Council of Presidents (COP).
We would like to thank the Daily for its
endorsement on April 7. We believe that it
clearly defined the differences between the
four slates.
So, why should one vote for us? For that
matter, why should one vote for anyone?
If one has looked at the political games,
the posters, the smiling faces and are fed up
with the whole mess, he has good reason.
So if one doesn't vote, what happens?
The administration won't go away, that's
for sure. Its policies will be left to go unchal
lenged. We agree that the ASSU govern
ment is already too much of a joke in the
eyes of both the administration and stu
dents.
We feel that students can challenge Uni
versity policy when it is contrary to student
concerns. This takes effective and efficient
leadership and realistic approach to com
plicated problems.
We have given serious consideration to

the concerns of our community and feel that
we can provide what is needed.
Our slate does not promise sunshine and
blue skies. A vote of us will not guarantee
that nerds will disappear or that Lake Lag
will fill up.
