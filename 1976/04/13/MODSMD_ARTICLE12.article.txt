This Council of Presidents (COP) cam
paign has been remarkably devoid of dis
cussion on the issues.
We feel that students deserve to know
where the candidates stand. As serious can
didates for the COP we would like to present
our views on the issues. We feel there is a
choice in this election.
In all material thus far presented, our op
ponents have neglected to deal with many
of the most important areas of student con
cern: student participation in the tenure
process, reform of the ASSU senate struc
ture, the concerns of women students, the
evaluation of teaching, and the concerns of
the vast majority of graduate students living
off campus. We would like to address these
points.
Tenure: In the past, students have attemp
ted to influence tenure decisions after the
fact. We will determine which professors
are coming up for review before decisions
are made by departments.
By publicizing and distributing this in
formation to undergraduate departmental
associations, we will encourage these stu
dents to mobilize support for those junior
faculty members deserving tenure for both

research and teaching.
Senate reform: Certainly the most
criticized branch of student government is
the senate. Reformation of this body is a
complex subject and our slate has put a lot
of thought into many such proposals.
We see several possibilities for change
(such as those we have posted in residences
on campus), yet we are open to suggestions.
We are interested in initiating meaningful
changes as well as continuing a process of
serious evaluation.
Women's issues: Repeatedly in the past,
the needs of women students have not been
well-served by the COP. We intend to re
establish the dormant women's co
ordinating committee.
We will co-ordinate all campus efforts for
more effective child care services and Wo
men's Day activities. As a matter of high
priority, we will work for the presence of a
full-time woman staff member in the office
of student activities.
Evaluation of teaching: The most valu
able means of affecting the quality of their
education is student teaching evaluation.
To enable students more effectively to re
ceive a better education for their money,

and to "vote with their feet" on teaching
quality, we will devise a special "short
form" for those courses presently excluded
by the ASSU Course Guide so that all Stan
ford courses will be reviewed.
Graduate student issues: While housing
and related problems for on-campus
graduates are often neglected, most
graduate concerns extend to all graduate
students.
We have proposed specific reform to the
graduate financial aid crisis, and shall un
dertake the preparation of a teacher's assis
tant handbook on proven teaching methods
a successful educator should know. We will
also work to gain permission for student
spouses to take courses on a per unit credit
basis at Stanford.
These are explicit, practical proposals
that will offer concrete benefits to Stanford
students. Our opponents have yet to deal
with any of these issues.
We believe the choice in this election is
clear.
