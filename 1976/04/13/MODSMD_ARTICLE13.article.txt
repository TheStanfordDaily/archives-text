# Hammer and Coffin
## 
### 
An April 7 Daily editorial, in
yet another instance of rubber
stamp ideology, labeled the
Hammer and Coffin Slate a "joke
slate," criticizing us for inability
to effectively challenge Univer
sity policy.
While it is true that we take a
humorous (perhaps hilarious)
approach to the act of campaign
ing for a meaningless office, to
label us "ineffective" performs a
180 degree rotation upon the
truth.
We seek to be the top student
sinecures for the next 12 months.
We need students' support.
Moral support does not a sine
cure make. Voting support does
(physical support, however, is
best).
We are committed to a policy
of militant, senselessly violent
student advocacy. Students
should be given the rights gen
erally bestowed upon one who
supports an institution both fi
nancially and physically.
Why Stanford?, a publication
of the administration, ironically
contains the information that
leads to their downfall.
Old or wimps
In it, the student-faculty ratio
is boasted as something like
12:1. A simple glance reveals

that students are in the majority,
and this coupled with the fact
that many faculty are old, feeble
or merely wimps, puts the stu
dents in an imposing position of
dominance.
We propose the creation of an
ASSU Goon Squad, which
would he responsible for "ham
mering out" difficulties. Not
only would this decrease
bureaucratic inefficiency, but
also student employment would
skyrocket.
If anybody, be it adminis
trator, faculty or staff, gets in our
way, we have no qualms about,
as slate member Marnie Hag
mann says, "wastin' 'em."
We also propose to bring qual
ity concerts to Stanford. We
firmly believe that if the ASSU is
going to lose money in this of
fice, they should at least bring
concerts of interest to students.
Jazz should return to Stanford.
Massive recycling
We propose to put Stanford on
a massive recycling program.
Slate member Roy Skogstrom
has a great measure of expertise
in this matter, and, as he says,
"our high school ecology club
lived in lavish decadence for
years from the profits."
Our final proposal would be to

provide ice cream and candy at
registration and toys during fi
nals week to ease the trauma of
these periods.
We conclude in saying that if
you are not going to vote for us,
please don't vote at all.
Our competition represents
the people who will be compet
ing for topnotch grad schools.
One is only destroying his
chances of admission by beefing
up their applications, which is
the bottom-line reason why

they're runninganyway, isn't it?
We represent a movement to
wards enlightenment and a
sense of humor in student gov
ernment. a movement toward
the election of human beings for
offices that call for such people.
If students don't vote for us, this
movement will be constipated.
