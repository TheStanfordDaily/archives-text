Let's not mince words, we
want to restructure America.
We started on a whim (it was
sunny that day). Soon we began
to question our candidacy.
We struggled to articulate our
dissatisfaction with this one
horsefarm. We struggled then to
explain the apathy and impo
tence. the bureaucracy and en
tropy which rapes our campus.

The acid of despondency
soaked in: we were worse than
serious.
Here's the trip:
We're all fooling ourselves.
We think of Stanford as a place of
learning, a forum for the ex
change of ideas — a place that
"educates" people, developing
their cultural and social con
sciousness.

But Stanford is also a factory,
vomiting out technocrats and
professionals.
Stanford, a school founded by
a robber baron, funded by rich
parents and the government,
must reflect the values of our
rigid society.
It must socialize people, turn
ing them toward preprofes
sionalism and specialization, in

stead of creativity and imagi na
tion.
What follows is an under
standable suppression of soul
searching and a submission to
success in society's terms.
Confused and tired we become
apathetic. An apathy reinforced
by the knowledge that we can't
effect change which challenges
the ideological basis of Stanford.

They are not going to allow stu
dent government determine fi
nancial aid policy, tenure policy
or anything of any consequence
whatsoever.
The function of government
must be reexamined and reno
vated. It can't be done by "insid
ers" who are only offering to
maneuver with the exis-
ting channels. It must be done by
people like ourselves — outsid
ers. We have lived through Stan
ford, suffered from the disease
and tried to figure it out.
We are not going to waste time
on issues we can't change. We'll
make a hell of a lot of noise
against them, but apply ourse
lves to matters we can influence.
We want to loosen things up,
get people questioning, caring
and having a good time.
By electing us one will be serv
ing notice that the students ore
ready to care again.

and tried to figure it out.
We are not going to waste time
on issues we can't change. We'll
make a hell of a lot of noise
against them, but apply ourse
lves to matters we can influence.
We want to loosen things up,
get people questioning, caring
and having a good time.
By electing us one will be serv
ing notice that the students ore
ready to care again.
