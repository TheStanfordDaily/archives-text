Child care
In response to the Howard
slate's position on child care, I
should like to agree that the
elimination of the Nixon Alter
School Program, costing $85 per
child per month for three or
more hours attendance a day,
would truly be "a step backward
for child care at Stanford."
However, 1 question whether
the consciousness of the mem
bers of the Howard slate can be
raised to the level of realizing
that even this After School Prog

ram, which in their words has so
well-served the Stanford com
munity, is a luxury beyond the
financial means of many
graduate parents at Stanford. If
their statements on "a sense of
community" and "challenging
even the most basic assumptions
of the University" are to be be
lieved, then the members of the
Howard slate should not pledge
themselves to the retainment of a
Nixon program Stanford stu
dents cannot afford, but rather
commit themselves to creating a

community day care program at
Stanford on the lines of the free
program at Foothill College.
The Howard slate should have
questioned the University's
basic assumptions that students'
children are in no way a com
munity responsibility, and that
student parents can afford to pay
$85.(J0 a month per child for one
or more children. The proposed
Howard support is unfortu
nately the kind of support that
Stanford student parents don't
need!
Members of the Petroff slate
have already met with the Stan
ford Student Parents Program to
explore the possibilities of real
community child care here.

Lesley Daniels and Bruce Re
znick are wrong about the
Graduate Student Council (GSC)
and its chairperson, Deric Jen
nings. Their April 8 letter to the
Daily takes unpardonable liber
ties with the facts about the Stan
ford Teaching and Research
Employees Union (STREU) and
the GSC, which 1 headed before
Jennings.
The two main facts of the mat
ter are that the GSC has been an

active, effective partisan of
graduate student causes and that
the GSC has made every effort to
cooperate with STREU to ad
vance those causes.
Daniels and Reznick may re
member that they attended a
meeting ot the GSC last spring to
which I invited STREU's offic
ers, in the spirit of cooperation,
in order to explore ways we
might work together to remedy
the desperate financial straits of
graduate students. Much to the
dismay of myself and the GSC's
other members, though,
STREU's representatives
showed that they hadn't done
their homework and that they
hadn't made good on their prom
ise to fight vigorously for
graduate student concerns.
They couldn't answer ques
tions about their demands for
teacher assistant stipends and
working conditions, and they
admitted that they hadn't lob
bied tenaciously with University
officials to get action on the is
sues they claimed to care about.
The GSC took STREU more
seriously than it seemed to take
itself. We investigated and de
bated its demands, and we
worked them into the recom
mendations we made about fel
lowships and stipends to the
committee on graduate studies. 1

sent a copy of our recommenda
tions to Daniels, and she said she
found them acceptable.
She also said that she was
thinking about running for the
GSC because STREU was falling
apart and the GSC seemed to be
where the action was!
I hadn't heard a word about
STREU this year until Daniels
and Reznick wrote to the Daily-1
had reluctantly assumed that the
union had collapsed under the
weight of its broken promises.
Jennings' record on the GSC
contrasts favorably with
STREU's record of false hopes
and failure. He did yeoman's
duty on the committee which
reported to the GSC on what
needs to be done to raise
graduate fellowships to a livable
level.
He is working hard now to get
a hesitant academic senate to
approve the GSC's recommenda
tions. Far from a "yes-man," he
has been a vigilant watchdog of
administration positions and an
outspoken advocate for graduate
student interests.
I'm sure he woitit let up on his
vigilance or his advocacy if
elected to the Council of Presi

Dorsey endorsement
Having lived or worked with
members of both senior class of
ficer slates, we can honestly say
that all of them are spirited and
hard-working. However, we
think the Mike Dorsey, Jamie
Grodsky, Dave Treinis and Risa
Shirnoda slate can serve the
senior class best.
Both slates emphasize their in
terest in supplying seniors with
fun and drink. Who can object to
that? Yet the Dorsey slate also
addresses future careers — an
issue which endures longer in
students' minds than a fleeting
alcoholic high.
The Dorsey slate's prop
osal to further develop the
Alumni Contact Service and
make the Career Planning and
Placement Center more available
to seniors should give students a
better chance at getting jobs.
Both slates also want to survey
seniors for suggestions for com
mencement speaker. The Jones
slate says it will survey students
by mail. This method was used
three years ago without success
— only 17 seniors responded.
The Dorsey slate plans to sur
vey students at registration
where there can be much more
personal contact. They will give
seniors veto power over the de
cision of the senior class officers

.1 nil the admuustration by cir
culating a second survey.
Moth slates art? enthusiastic or
they wouldn't be running. How
ever, the Dorsev slate lias done

Child care
In response to the Howard
slate's position on child care, I
should like to agree that the
elimination of the Nixon Alter
School Program, costing $85 per
child per month for three or
more hours attendance a day,
would truly be "a step backward
for child care at Stanford."
However, 1 question whether
the consciousness of the mem
bers of the Howard slate can be
raised to the level of realizing
that even this After School Prog

ram, which in their words has so
well-served the Stanford com
munity, is a luxury beyond the
financial means of many
graduate parents at Stanford. If
their statements on "a sense of
community" and "challenging
even the most basic assumptions
of the University" are to be be
lieved, then the members of the
Howard slate should not pledge
themselves to the retainment of a
Nixon program Stanford stu
dents cannot afford, but rather
commit themselves to creating a

community day care program at
Stanford on the lines of the free
program at Foothill College.
The Howard slate should have
questioned the University's
basic assumptions that students'
children are in no way a com
munity responsibility, and that
student parents can afford to pay
$85.(J0 a month per child for one
or more children. The proposed
Howard support is unfortu

Stanford student parents don't

Child care
In response to the Howard
slate's position on child care, I
should like to agree that the
elimination of the Nixon Alter
School Program, costing $85 per
child per month for three or
more hours attendance a day,
would truly be "a step backward
for child care at Stanford."
However, 1 question whether
the consciousness of the mem
bers of the Howard slate can be
raised to the level of realizing
that even this After School Prog

ram, which in their words has so
well-served the Stanford com
munity, is a luxury beyond the
financial means of many
graduate parents at Stanford. If
their statements on "a sense of
community" and "challenging
even the most basic assumptions
of the University" are to be be
lieved, then the members of the
Howard slate should not pledge
themselves to the retainment of a
Nixon program Stanford stu
dents cannot afford, but rather
commit themselves to creating a

community day care program at
Stanford on the lines of the free
program at Foothill College.
The Howard slate should have
questioned the University's
basic assumptions that students'
children are in no way a com
munity responsibility, and that
student parents can afford to pay
$85.(J0 a month per child for one
or more children. The proposed
Howard support is unfortu
nately the kind of support that
Stanford student parents don't
need!
Members of the Petroff slate
have already met with the Stan
ford Student Parents Program to
explore the possibilities of real
community child care here.

GSC
Lesley Daniels and Bruce Re
znick are wrong about the
Graduate Student Council (GSC)
and its chairperson, Deric Jen
nings. Their April 8 letter to the
Daily takes unpardonable liber
ties with the facts about the Stan
ford Teaching and Research
Employees Union (STREU) and
the GSC, which 1 headed before
Jennings.
The two main facts of the mat
ter are that the GSC has been an

active, effective partisan of
graduate student causes and that
the GSC has made every effort to
cooperate with STREU to ad
vance those causes.
Daniels and Reznick may re
member that they attended a
meeting ot the GSC last spring to
which I invited STREU's offic
ers, in the spirit of cooperation,
in order to explore ways we
might work together to remedy
the desperate financial straits of
graduate students. Much to the
dismay of myself and the GSC's
other members, though,
STREU's representatives
showed that they hadn't done
their homework and that they
hadn't made good on their prom
ise to fight vigorously for
graduate student concerns.
They couldn't answer ques
tions about their demands for
teacher assistant stipends and
working conditions, and they
admitted that they hadn't lob
bied tenaciously with University
officials to get action on the is
sues they claimed to care about.
The GSC took STREU more
seriously than it seemed to take
itself. We investigated and de
bated its demands, and we
worked them into the recom
mendations we made about fel
lowships and stipends to the
committee on graduate studies. 1

sent a copy of our recommenda
tions to Daniels, and she said she
found them acceptable.
She also said that she was
thinking about running for the
GSC because STREU was falling
apart and the GSC seemed to be
where the action was!
I hadn't heard a word about
STREU this year until Daniels
and Reznick wrote to the Daily-1
had reluctantly assumed that the
union had collapsed under the
weight of its broken promises.
Jennings' record on the GSC
contrasts favorably with
STREU's record of false hopes
and failure. He did yeoman's
duty on the committee which
reported to the GSC on what
needs to be done to raise
graduate fellowships to a livable
level.
He is working hard now to get
a hesitant academic senate to
approve the GSC's recommenda
tions. Far from a "yes-man," he
has been a vigilant watchdog of
administration positions and an
outspoken advocate for graduate
student interests.
I'm sure he woitit let up on his
vigilance or his advocacy if
elected to the Council of Presi
