Jones, et al.
Traditionally, the responsibil
ity of senior class officers are
service, rather than politically,
oriented. We are four fun-loving
people with broad campus ex
perience, desiring to make stu
dents senior year an enjoyable
one.
Our posters, the ones with the
bright red borders, typify our at
titude; we're serious about the
office, yet lighthearted in style.
Our past experience indicates
that we enjoy working for and
with people. We would like to
continue working for students.
Sure we're looking for stu
dents' vote, but no one deserves
a vote until they have earned the
confidence of the electorate.
"TheSlate" is enthusiasticabout
initiating these plans next year:
—FASCSMS, namely, "The
First Annual Senior Com
mencement Speaker Mail Sur
vey," designed to provide posi
tive student input to the speaker
selection process.
—"The outing," an event of
seniors' choice — ideas,
seniors-to-be? How about a Napa
Valley wine tasting tour, a din
ner dance in the city, a night at
Great America, a beach or ski
trip . . .
—SASHAD. namely, "Student
Alumni Sherry Hours and Din
ners," to permit contact with the
"real world" so soon to replace
life on The Farm.
—The Black Book, a computer
printout of seniors' "real world"
addresses for future contact.
—AGSTP, namely, "A Giant
Senior Tailgate Party . . . or
Two ... or Three," as a prelude
to the antics of the Senior Cardi
nals, Trees, Robber Barons,
Sequoias, or whatever students
want to call them.
— ... And of course Zot's —
TGIF's at the traditional senior
watering hole.
We are convinced that these
are all feasible ideas.
Come by and talk with us.
We'll be around White Plaza

each morning this week.

Dorsey, et al.
We're the Dorsey-Grodsky-
Treinis-Shimoda Senior Class
slate. We didn't just dream up
our ideas for voter appeal; in
stead, careful thinking and re
search lies behind our proposals.
At Fall registration next year,
we will collect student sugges
tions for the graduation speaker;
we are the only senior class slate
to allow students a veto on the
proposed speaker.
We feel that seniors will be
nefit from contact with alumni
in their fields; thus, Mike is par
ticularly anxious to develop the
Alumni Contact Service.
We will publicize Career
Planning and Placement Center
events in an attempt to remedy
seniors' anxieties about the fu
ture, and will publish an address
list for seniors to maintain con
tact with each other after
graduating.
All members of our slate are
excited about planning keggers,
"Senior Happy Hours," and
major quarterly smashes. Dave
has begun asking permission
(and received favorable re
sponses) for a dance at "The
Dish." Jamie, of the Field Hoc
key Team, is preparing to work
on a Student-Faculty Sports and
Fun Day, and Risa is getting in
gear for a Senior Class Talent (or
lack of talent) Show.
Please join the following stu
dents who have endorsed
our slate: "Weird Walt" Spevak
and Marie Fiatarone (Presidents,
Class of '78), Jeff Boothe, Bonny
Rodden, Ron Inge, Sam Spigel
man, Chris Benitez, Christy
Timberlake, Todd Margolis and
Nancy Bolger.
Thank you for your support!

We're the Dorsey-Grodsky-
Treinis-Shimoda Senior Class
slate. We didn't just dream up
our ideas for voter appeal; in
stead, careful thinking and re
search lies behind our proposals.
At Fall registration next year,
we will collect student sugges
tions for the graduation speaker;
we are the only senior class slate
to allow students a veto on the
proposed speaker.
We feel that seniors will be
nefit from contact with alumni
in their fields; thus, Mike is par
ticularly anxious to develop the
Alumni Contact Service.
We will publicize Career
Planning and Placement Center
events in an attempt to remedy
seniors' anxieties about the fu
ture, and will publish an address
list for seniors to maintain con
tact with each other after
graduating.
All members of our slate are
excited about planning keggers,
"Senior Happy Hours," and
major quarterly smashes. Dave
has begun asking permission
(and received favorable re
sponses) for a dance at "The
Dish." Jamie, of the Field Hoc
key Team, is preparing to work
on a Student-Faculty Sports and
Fun Day, and Risa is getting in
gear for a Senior Class Talent (or
lack of talent) Show.
Please join the following stu
dents who have endorsed
our slate: "Weird Walt" Spevak
and Marie Fiatarone (Presidents,
Class of '78), Jeff Boothe, Bonny
Rodden, Ron Inge, Sam Spigel
man, Chris Benitez, Christy
Timberlake, Todd Margolis and
Nancy Bolger.
Thank you for your support!

Traditionally, the responsibil
ity of senior class officers are
service, rather than politically,
oriented. We are four fun-loving
people with broad campus ex
perience, desiring to make stu
dents senior year an enjoyable
one.
Our posters, the ones with the
bright red borders, typify our at
titude; we're serious about the
office, yet lighthearted in style.
Our past experience indicates
that we enjoy working for and
with people. We would like to
continue working for students.
Sure we're looking for stu
dents' vote, but no one deserves
a vote until they have earned the
confidence of the electorate.
"TheSlate" is enthusiasticabout
initiating these plans next year:
—FASCSMS, namely, "The
First Annual Senior Com
mencement Speaker Mail Sur
vey," designed to provide posi
tive student input to the speaker
selection process.
—"The outing," an event of
seniors' choice — ideas,
seniors-to-be? How about a Napa
Valley wine tasting tour, a din
ner dance in the city, a night at
Great America, a beach or ski
trip . . .
—SASHAD. namely, "Student
Alumni Sherry Hours and Din
ners," to permit contact with the
"real world" so soon to replace
life on The Farm.
—The Black Book, a computer
printout of seniors' "real world"
addresses for future contact.
—AGSTP, namely, "A Giant
Senior Tailgate Party . . . or
Two ... or Three," as a prelude
to the antics of the Senior Cardi
nals, Trees, Robber Barons,
Sequoias, or whatever students
want to call them.
— ... And of course Zot's —
TGIF's at the traditional senior
watering hole.
We are convinced that these
are all feasible ideas.
Come by and talk with us.
We'll be around White Plaza

each morning this week.
