# Fate of bike bridge to be decided tonight
## 
### Mike Bailey 
A proposal to build a bicycle
pedestrian bridge between Menlo Park
and Stanford faces a last major obstacle
in the Menlo Park City Council to
night. The bridge would span the San
Francisquito Creek near the Medical
Center at San Mateo Drive.
The estimated $70,000 needed to
complete the project has already been
appropriated. Palo Alto agreed July 1,
1975,t0 pay one half of the cost. San
Mateo County agreed later in the
month to pay one quarter of the cost.
The Menlo Park City Council voted in
'December to set aside the remaining
one fourth but then decided to wait for
community reaction before giving a
final approval for construction to be
gin.
Menlo Park residents near the
selected site, and especially those liv
ing on San Mateo Drive, have sub
sequently protested the proposal.
Menlo Park Bikeways Club Chair
man Janice claims that a sur
vey has shown that the bridge would
be used for about 1000 crossings per
day.
The bridge will be completed by fall
if the Menlo Park City Council votes
yes. according to LaFetra. She charac
terized the opposition to the proposal
as "25 local residents who are afraid of
vandalism and traffic."

Homeowners on the quiet residen
tial street seem to fear an invasion of
their privacy. One resident com
plained that San Mateo Drive is "a nar
row street which doesn't even have a
sidewalk or gutter to begin with."
Clarence Cenasci, whose home is
100 feet from the building site, was
particularly bitter about the proposal.
He and many of his neighbors refer to
the bicycle club as "the motorcycle
gang." since they claim that motorcyc
lists would illegally use the bridge.
Pointing out that "mostly senior
citizens" live on San Mateo Drive,
Cenasci asserted that "this thing has
been crammed down our throats." He
said that the Menlo Park City Council
has "been stinking to us because it
hasn't told us anything."
Local residents, totaling 115, have
signed a petition to have the proposal
stopped, he claimed.
Both irritated homeowners and
supporters of the bridge stress the im
portanceof theCitvConncil meeting at
eight tonight. Although only Council
members can vote, Janice LaFetra
claimed that they are very sensitive to
community opinion and that the issue
will probably be decided by a "body
count" of interested citizens who at
tend the meeting.
