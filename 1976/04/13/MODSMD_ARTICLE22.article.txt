Is it legal for an unmarried couple to check into a mote] room
together';'
l couldn't find two sources that agree, but it would appear that as
long as you are both over 21, it is perfectly legal. But it gets rather
confusing after that. The only applicable sections in the Palo Alto
Municipal Code require hotels and motels to keep a register of all
their guests, prohibit guests from signing false names, and require
the motels and hotels to report any minors (under 18) who are
present without their parents or legal guardians.
A source in the police department said that he felt that as long as
the guests were not under age, there <jre no laws against an unmar
ried couple checking in together. However, this doesn't quite
match with the opinions of two motel managers.
Harry Kimball, manager of the Rickey's Hyatt House Hotel, said
that he knew of no laws regarding this either, but indicated that if a
couple did not sign in as man and wife, they would not be allowed
! to rent the same room.
The Glass Slipper motel's manager had a different story. She said
that a Palo Alto police officer had informed her that it was illegal to
rent a room to a couple if the man is younger than 21 or the woman
is younger than 18.
Enforcement policies differ, too. 1 found no indication from the
police department that they were actively looking for violations of
this law.
