## 'Guys & Dolls' arrives Musical fable of Broadway hits Mem. Aud. this week 
### Katherine Miller 
Extravaganza in Memorial
Auditorium?
Students preparing for
months to bring a bit of Broad
way to the Stanford campus?
The idea sounds unrealistic at
best — but for the cast of Guys
<intl Dolls it is merely an exciting
fact of life.
This show represents the
combined efforts of 150 stu
dents. It is the first production by
Ram's Head, the newly revived
independent drama organiza
tion.
Guys o/uJ Dolls is a comic
view of the New York City un
derworld in fhe 19505.
The guys are gamblers looking
for a place to hold "the oldest
established permanent floating
crap game in New York." Most of
the dolls are "Hot Box" chorus
girls, but one is a prim sergeant
in the Salvation Army seeking
sinners for her floundering mis
sion.
Shady and saintly
Comic circumstances and, of
course, unexpected romance
bring the Guys and Dolls to
gether. The shady and the
saintly all sing and dance their
way to a happy ending.
The immense size of the Mem.
Aud. stage has presented a chal
lenge to Jonathan Mills, techni
cal director and set designer.
Mills and his crew members
have constructed an elaborate
platformed set where actors per
form on different levels, a project
not even attempted in the origi
nal Broadway production.
The audience of Guvs and

Dulls will be taken on a visual
tour of New York City from the
neon lights of Broadway to the
pipes of the sewer system.
Moral support and technical
aid has come from many mem
bers of the Drama Department,
says director Susie Malouf, par
ticularly A. Evan Haag and the
show's sponsor, Douglas Rus
sell.
What is it like; to participate in
an extra-curricular ex
travaganza?
Commune
"It's like living in a commune
for eight weeks," says Marty
Markowitz, a medical student by
day and Nathan Detroit, ace
gambler, by night. "There is no
division of labor. Everyone does
everything."
A community spirit does seem
to exist as cast and staff members
work together to complete the
final pre-opening tasks. Malouf
directs the play wearing blue
jeans splattered with traces of an
afternoon of set painting. During
rehearsals, those not on stage are
busy sewing on costumes — or
catching up on some bookwork.
The goal of the Ram's Head
group is to present a professional
performance by students for the
students. However, Malouf says
with a smile, the most important
reason for doing Guys and Dolls
is simply to have a lot of fun.
Tickets for the April 14-17
shows will be available in ad
vance or at the door at a price of
$1 for students and $2.50 for
non-students. All seats are gen
eral admission.
