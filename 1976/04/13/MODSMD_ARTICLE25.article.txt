# Triumphant return for Ram's Head
## 
### 
On April 14 a Broadway musi
cal will once again grace the
stage of Stanford University's
Memorial Auditorium.
Students at Stanford are re
activating Ram's Head, the once
powerful drama organization
that specialized in large-scale
productions.
Guys and Dolls is their first
show. If successful it could lead
to a revival in all-campus inde
pendent theater productions at
Stanford, according to members
of the new Ram's Head staff.
Ram's Head was founded in
1911 by three professors and
seven undergraduates for the
purpose of performing original
dramatic works. Traditionally.
Ram's Head produced original
Winter One-Acts anil a Spring
show, in addition to their annual
Mig Game football show, the
Stanford Gaieties.
Death
Pressure from the Drama De
partment combined with finan
cial difficulties caused the
eventual death of Ram's Head.
Large-scale productions became
more expensive to produce and
box-office profits began to de
cline. The political attitudes
held by students of the 1960s
also caused decreased interest in
the organization.
The group's last program was
Dracula in November, 1971. The
drama society folded in 1972
and assets were auctioned to pay
for debts.
Last July, after months of
negotiations with faculty and
administration members, the
newly assembled Ram's Head
staff was given a performance
date in Memorial Auditorium,
with funding granted by eight
different LJniversity organiza
tions. Director Susie Malouf now
has a 55-person cast plus dozens
of crew and orchestra members
to work with.
Next year
If Guys and Dolls plays to a
full audience each night, Ram's
Head will cover its expenses
while achieving a major goal of
producer George McMillan and
his staff: to provide a fund to
contribute to next year's produc
tion.
McMillan feels that indepen
dent student productions do
generate student interest and
that a large-scale show can be a
success on the Stanford campus.
This week he may be proven
right.
