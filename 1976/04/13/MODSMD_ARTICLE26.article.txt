Judge declares SF walkout illegal
SAN FRANCISCO — A new proposal for ending San
Francisco's 13-day-old city workers strike was made yes
terday shortly after a judge declared the walkout illegal
and ordered picketing ended.
City Attorney Thomas O'Connor said he would meet
today with Mayor George Moscone and the governing
Board of Supervisors on how to implement the prelimi
nary injunction issued by Superior Court Judge John Ben
son after a hearing with union lawyers present.
O'Connor said the probable procedure would be to serve
the order on pickets and arrest them if they fail to comply.
1 le said violators could be fined $500 and spend five days
in jail.
Later in the day the city negotiator met for about an hour
with leaders of the 10 unions which struck March 31,
demanding pay raises and protesting cuts proposed by
supervisors from about 1900 craft union members.
As they left, negotiators said the city had presented a
new economic proposal, which would be aired at a labor
caucus today. Details of the proposal were not made pub
lic.
The preliminary injunction superseded a temporary re
straining order, which was obtained by the city soon after
the strike began. It has been ignored by the strikers.
Benson's ruling said public employes do not have the
right to strike in California.
Cypriots riot at U.S. Embassy
NICOSIA, Cyprus — Hundreds of riot police repulsed
between 2000 and 3000 stone-throwing Greek Cypriot
demonstrators trying to rush the U.S. Embassy here yes
terday to protest planned American military aid to Tur
key.
Successive waves of rioters defied a barrage of tear gas
and police baton charges for nearly three hours before
fleeing into nearby streets.
The demonstrations started with a rally in the main
square of the capital followed by a march through the
main streets to the embassy, two miles away.
The Cyprus government had taken unprecedented mea
sures to protect the embassy, which was stoned in a simi
lar demonstration last Tuesday. In August,l974,Ambas
sador Rodger Davies was killed by a rifle bullet during a
riot against the embassy.
Callaway hearings recessed
WASHINGTON — A Senate subcommittee yesterday
abruptly recessed its hearings on Howard Callawway's
alleged efforts to win Forest Service approval to expand
his Colorado ski resort after the former Army secretary
protested he was being treated unfairly.
Callaway, who recently resigned as President Ford's
campaign manager because of the controversy, com
plained that those who had initially accused him of using
improper influence in allegedly trying to persuade the
Forest Service into approving the expansion had not been
summoned to testify.
Chairman Floyd Haskell (D-Colo.), of the Senate interior
environment subcommittee, said these individuals would
be subpoenaed as a result of Callaway's protest. He then
postponed the hearings until these witnesses can appear,
which I laskell said would be after the 10-day Easter recess
which begins on Wednesday.
Callaway immediately reversed his position, telling the
pan J he would waive all rights to be confronted with his

accusers just to get the proceedings over with.
Callaway acknowledged earlier in the hearing that he
sought Forest Service approval to expand his Colorado ski
resort but denied exerting political pressure to reverse an
agency recommendation opposing the expansion.
Goode faces sentencing today
SACRAMENTO — Manson cultist Sandra Goode will be
sentenced today by the same judge who sentenced her
ex-roommate, Lynette Fromme, to life in prison for at
tempting to kill President Ford.
Coode, the last hardcore follower of mass murderer
Charles Manson still outside prison walls, and a friend,
Susan Murphy, were convicted on charges of conspiring
to issue death threats.
Goode could receive up to 25 years in prison — five
years for each of the five counts against her. Murphy was
convicted on one count.
The two women were convicted of conspiring to mail
threatening letters to a long list of businessmen, govern
ment leaders, companies and organizations.
IRS: faulty tax checks?
WASHINGTON — Four days before income tax filing
deadline, a congressional subcommittee has been told the
government loses hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes
because the Internal Revenue Service cannot verify how
much money many Americans make.
The lost taxes may be as high as $500 million a year, two
investigators told a House Government Operations sub
committee yesterday.
IRS Commissioner Donald Alexander disputed the
amount, saying that his best guess was that taxpayers may
not be reporting as much as $1 billion a year in income,
which translates to a much smaller amount in actual taxes
lost.
Alexander could not say for certain how much income
was not being reported or the actual amount of taxes going
uncollected.
The commissioner did not dispute the findings that
most paper Form 1099 copies are discarded by the IRS, but
he said the lost revenue to the government is not as high as
the investigators claimed because most taxpayers volun
tarily list all their income.
The IRS has a program called Document Matching Prog
ram to verify income amounts but the investigators said it
"is seriously deficient."
