# Victory parties, but...
## No clear primary leader 
### Bruce Kadden News Analysis 
Despite the fact that all three major
Democratic presidential contenders
were talking like victors, no one really
won the New York and Wisconsin
primaries last week.
Senator Henry Jackson (D-
Washington) was bragging that he got
104 convention delegates in the Em
pire State, forgetting that he had pre
dicted he would sweep a majority of
the state's 274 delegates.
Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter was
ecstatic when he was awakened to be
told that he had edged Representative
Mo Udall (D-Arizona) in Wisconsin,
after going to bed convinced he had
lost. But Carter only won 33 delegates
in New York, and far fewer than either
Udall or Jackson won in both states.
Udall, who suffered the embarrass
ment of a pre-mature victory party,
said he was pleased with finishing a
close second, but should have done a
lot better in liberal Wisconsin.
Big winner
On the Republican side, President
Gerald Ford was the big winner, as ex
pected. Although he received only 55
percent of the popular vote in Wiscon
sin, he won all the convention dele
gates. In New York, he officially won
zero delegates, but most of the 113 un
committed delegates are expected to
support him.
Whether former California Governor
Ronald Reagan still has any chance
will be known early next month when
the two clash in Texas. Reagan is pas
sing up Pennsylvania, where he
realizes he doesn't stand a chance, for
the Southern state where he's quite
popular.
His only hope appears to be to ac
cumulate enough delegates to influ
ence Ford's vice-presidential selection
at the Kansas City convention.
The three Democrats have already
started campaigning in Pennsylvania,
a crucial state in which any of the con
tenders could win. Jackson has been

able to win in Massachusetts and New
York; if he can add a third eastern state,
he will bolster his chances to capture a
large portion of the moderates from
Carter.
Peanut farmer
But the peanut farmer remains a
strong front-runner. If his state
ment condoning "ethnic purity"
doesn't come back to haunt him, he
should arrive at the New York conven
tion with the largest block of commit
ted delegates. Carter would greatly be
nefit by a victory in Pennsylvania be
cause it would increase his slim
chances for a first-ballot victory,
chances which are probably null
thanks to his "mistatement."
For Udall, who appears down but
not out. Pennsylvania is critical. As the
leading liberal contender, Udall needs
to maintain momentum in every prim
ary in order to keep the spot. If he fails,
California Governor Jerry Brown,
Idaho Senator Frank Church or Min
nesota Senator Hubert Humphrey are
all waiting in the wings to break a
deadlocked convention.
And what has happened to Alabama
Governor George Wallace who sur
prised everyone four years ago with
impressive showings in northern
states and victories in the South? Wal
lace is struggling to gather every dele
gate possible so that he'll have some
voice in the convention this summer.
Which is more than can be said for

former Oklahoma Senator Fred Harris,
the most recent casualty in the democ
ratic primaries. Harris, campaigning
as a populist, received only one per
cent of the vote in Wisconsin.
April 27 looms as the big date that
may further narrow the field of active
democratic presidential contenders
and will certainly indicate whether
Carter will remain the front-runner
until the important California primary.
For Ford and Reagan, the showdown
will be a week later, when they square
off in Texas.

he will bolster his chances to capture a
large portion of the moderates from
Carter.
Peanut farmer
But the peanut farmer remains a
strong front-runner. If his state
ment condoning "ethnic purity"
doesn't come back to haunt him, he
should arrive at the New York conven
tion with the largest block of commit
ted delegates. Carter would greatly be
nefit by a victory in Pennsylvania be
cause it would increase his slim
chances for a first-ballot victory,
chances which are probably null
thanks to his "mistatement."
For Udall, who appears down but
not out. Pennsylvania is critical. As the
leading liberal contender, Udall needs
to maintain momentum in every prim
ary in order to keep the spot. If he fails,
California Governor Jerry Brown,
Idaho Senator Frank Church or Min
nesota Senator Hubert Humphrey are
all waiting in the wings to break a
deadlocked convention.
And what has happened to Alabama
Governor George Wallace who sur
prised everyone four years ago with
impressive showings in northern
states and victories in the South? Wal
lace is struggling to gather every dele
gate possible so that he'll have some
voice in the convention this summer.
Which is more than can be said for

former Oklahoma Senator Fred Harris,
the most recent casualty in the democ
ratic primaries. Harris, campaigning
as a populist, received only one per
cent of the vote in Wisconsin.
April 27 looms as the big date that
may further narrow the field of active
democratic presidential contenders
and will certainly indicate whether
Carter will remain the front-runner
until the important California primary.
For Ford and Reagan, the showdown
will be a week later, when they square
off in Texas.

ONE OF MANY—Although heading the Democratic race, Jimmy Carter can
not claim a clear-cut leaa in recent state primaries. Here, Carter addresses
Stanford students last November.
Despite the fact that all three major
Democratic presidential contenders
were talking like victors, no one really
won the New York and Wisconsin
primaries last week.
Senator Henry Jackson (D-
Washington) was bragging that he got
104 convention delegates in the Em
pire State, forgetting that he had pre
dicted he would sweep a majority of
the state's 274 delegates.
Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter was
ecstatic when he was awakened to be
told that he had edged Representative
Mo Udall (D-Arizona) in Wisconsin,
after going to bed convinced he had
lost. But Carter only won 33 delegates
in New York, and far fewer than either
Udall or Jackson won in both states.
Udall, who suffered the embarrass
ment of a pre-mature victory party,
said he was pleased with finishing a
close second, but should have done a
lot better in liberal Wisconsin.
Big winner
On the Republican side, President
Gerald Ford was the big winner, as ex
pected. Although he received only 55
percent of the popular vote in Wiscon
sin, he won all the convention dele
gates. In New York, he officially won
zero delegates, but most of the 113 un
committed delegates are expected to
support him.
Whether former California Governor
Ronald Reagan still has any chance
will be known early next month when
the two clash in Texas. Reagan is pas
sing up Pennsylvania, where he
realizes he doesn't stand a chance, for
the Southern state where he's quite
popular.
His only hope appears to be to ac
cumulate enough delegates to influ
ence Ford's vice-presidential selection
at the Kansas City convention.
The three Democrats have already
started campaigning in Pennsylvania,
a crucial state in which any of the con
tenders could win. Jackson has been

able to win in Massachusetts and New
York; if he can add a third eastern state,
he will bolster his chances to capture a
large portion of the moderates from
Carter.
