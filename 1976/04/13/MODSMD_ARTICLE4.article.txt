# ASSU Senate may debate possible SJC illegality
## 
### Dan Fiduccia 
The ASSU Senate tonight probably
will pick up the "hot potato" of the
legitimacy of the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC).
Several senators indicated last night
that they will question whether last
year's senate ratification of the SJC in
fact violated the ASSU Constitution.
Article IV, Section 1 of the ASSU
Constitution requires a two-thirds
majority of the students voting in a
general election to approve new Uni
versity judicial bodies. The current
SJC fell far short of gaining that ap
proval in last spring's student election.
'Amendments'
In a formal statement yesterday, the
ASSU Council of Presidents (COP) af
firmed the SJC's legitimacy, arguing
that the senate approved only
"amendments in the composition of an
already-recognized judicial body."

Making the same argument as Ad
ministration officials, the COP implied
that the SJC actually required approval
only from a simple majority.
Denis Hayes, a former trustee, ASSU
president in 1968-69 and framer of the
current ASSU Constitution disagreed
yesterday with the "amendment" ar
gument.
SJC included?
Contacted in Washington D.C.,
Hayes reacted with dismay. "Some
people are claiming that that (Art. IV,
Sec. 1) should not include the SJC? I
can't believe it. I can hardly think that
the language could be more clear,"
Hayes said.
According to Hayes, the ASSU must
comply with Art. IV, Sec. 1 for any
amendment to the Legislative and Jud
icial Charter of 1968.
"The feeling was that whatever sys
tem was finally approved — be it fa
culty or student majority, or all
student — it would have to be ap
proved by a two-thirds vote of the stu
dents," said Hayes.
Hayes added that it was intended
when the constitution was framed that
two-thirds approval be required for all
future charter changes.
Framing intent
"Our intent in framing was to say the
student moods will change from year
to year, but whatever (judicial) body is
imposed will require a substantial stu
dent approval — thus the two-thirds
clause," Hayes commented.
Herb Borock. 1970-71 senate par
liamentarian, agreed with Hayes con
cerning the necessity of two-thirds
vote.
"The University abrogated the char
ter in 1971, when it instituted the
Campus Judicial Panel. Thus, a two

thirds vote was necessary in 1975." he
said.
Borock also claimed that the senate
has never acted to amend the charter,
even if it does still exist.
No approval
"The senate has not approved the
amendment, and only the senate can
approve it. What it voted was mean
ingless.
"The senate did not do this on May
12,1975. All they did was to certify the
election results one week and ratify it
next week, which is essentially the
same thing — acknowledging that the
election took place and that it was
legal," Borock said.
ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum
said last night he will present copies of
the ClOP's statement to the senators at
the meeting.
Rosenbaum said in the statement
that "The final interpretation of the
ASSU Constitution rests with the
ASSU Senate. It is the Senate which
will have to decide this issue in its
meeting tomorrow evening."
Interpretation clause
The senate's power to interpret its
constitution is provided in Art. 11, Sec.
6. which reads:
"The Senate shall have the power to
interpret this Constitution and the
By-Laws of the Association (ASSU)."
Borock said "the senators have to
interpret the constitution to mean
either that the senate and only the se
nate has power to approve amend
ments, or that the senate can delegate
that power to the students at large."
Borock agreed with others that the
senate "can not delegate that power to
the students according to Article 111 of
the charter and (former University
President Kenneth) Pitzer's letters ot
acceptance of the constitution."
Invalidation immaterial
Even if the senate interprets the con
stitution to invalidate the SJC, the SJC
will apparently remain in effect, ac
cording to an Administration spokes
man.
James Siena, legal adviser to the
president, said Sunday any invalida
tion of the SJC now would be "a little
late in the game."
Siena said that President Richard
Lyman will reinstitute the SJC if last
year's senate action is ruled illegal.
"There is a judicial system in effect
and it's the one we're going to use,"
Siena said.
Mike Herman, last year's ASSU
president and a member of last year's
C-15, said yesterday the senate could
have completely disregarded the stu
dent vote in acting on the SJC.
"The referendum was not binding
on the ASSU Senate," he said. "The
senate still could have not ratified the

referendum — it was the final author
ity."
Two-thirds clause relevant?
Herman said he didn't think the
two-thirds clause was relevant, al
though he said he knew of it last year.
He termed the new SJC as "basically
a series of amendments." but
explained that the proposal was put on
the ballot because other C-15 propos
als had been considered by students in
past years.
Borock pointed out that the two
thirds clause was used both times stu
dents approved the Judicial Charter.
In October, 1968, students approved
by more than two-thirds a referendum
on the student judicial system which
called for approval of the "Judicial and
Rulemaking Bodies recommended by
theCommittee-of-15 . . . until March 1,
1969."
Then in February, 1969, students
approved a referendum which stated
"shall the revised Legislative and Jud
icial Charter, as approved by the
Committee of 15, be adopted?"
