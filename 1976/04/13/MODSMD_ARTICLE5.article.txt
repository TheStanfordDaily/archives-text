SAN FRANCISCO — Judge Oliver
Carter postponed final sentencing of
Patricia Hearst yesterday and mean
while ordered her sent to a correc
tional institute for at least 90 days of
psychiatric study.
As a formality, Carter issued a pre
liminary sentence of 25 years impris
onment — the maximum term possible
for armed bank robbery.
The judge added, however, that after
he receives the results of the psychiat
ric study he intends to reduce the sen
tence. He also said that probation for
Hearst remains a possibility.
Carter's decision was in accordance
with a request filed by defense attor
ney F. Lee Bailey. Bailey had told the

judge that he did not believe impris
onment is needed to protect society
from Hearst or to deter Hearst from
committing further crimes.
"I do not think it necessary," Bailey
said, "in all the agony that has pep
pered this case since Feb. 4, 1974, the
undeserved punishment suffered by
the defendant at the hands of her cap
tors, and by her as a result of what has
happened to her family in one of the
most difficult ordeals any American
family has ever had to endure, that re
tribution by society should play a large
part in any judgment to be imposed in
the case."
Assistant defense attorney Albert
Johnson told newsmen after yester
day's session that when Hearst is cal

led back for final sentencing the de
fense will urge probation. Johnson
said he was pleased with Carter's ac
tion at this time because "in light of the
many complexities in this case it was
a very responsible decision."
Johnson indicated that he believes
Hearst will be taken to the Metropoli
tan Correction Center in San Diego for
her three months of examination.
Sara Jane Moore was sent to the San
Diego center for observation prior to
sentencing for her attempted assassi
nation of President Ford.
Yesterday's ruling is not expected to
affect Hearst's scheduled pre-trial
hearings in I,os Angeles Wednesday
on charges of robbery, kidnapping and
assault.
