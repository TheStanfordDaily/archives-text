The Main Library reference room
houses the 70 volume Encyc
lopedia Universal Illustrade, the
34 volume Index to South African
Periodicals, the 55 volume
Psychological Abstracts and the 45
volume Biographie Universells.,
But far away from all this
academia, off in four locked corner
closets and a locked office, are hid
den such memorabilia as old movie
magazines, photo albums of Mary
Pickford, Bxlo glossy publicity
stills of Lucille Ball, an 1832
playbill for "The Merry Wives of
Windsor," actress Trixie Friganza's
collection of cigarette cards with
pictures of stars, and — most
memorable memorabilia of all —
scripts of "Emergency."
They're all part of the widely var
ied Stanford Theater Collection.
Celeste Ashley is the reference li
brarian in charge of this collection,
which has been described by col
leagues as "one of the best or
ganized" in the United States and
certainly one of the two best on the
Pacific Coast.
The collection was established in
1942 when two student groups, the
Dramatic Council and Ram's Head
Dramatic Society, set up a fund in
the Speech and Drama Department
with the intention of establishing a
departmental library. The depart
ment purchased the 7000 volume
Barrett M. Clark collection in 1944.
Clark was an authority on American
theatrical history.
In 1952 the collection was moved
from the Bender Room to its present
location in the Main Library refer
ence room.
Samuel Stark, compiler of the
noted "Stark Index." donated his
American theater collection to the
library in 1963. This donation now

forms the bulk of the collection.
Various other private donations
have helped it attain its present
size.
Much of the library's growth can
be attributed to the efforts of Ashley
who contacts collectors whenever
she hears of an interesting item.
Thanks to her, the growth of the
collection is an ongoing process.
Overall emphasis
The overall emphasis of the lib
rary is on the American theater,
with particular attention given to
the 19th century American stage.

Very little information has been
formally compiled on this topic,
and hence Stanford's collection is a
valuable tool for scholars.
The "Stark Index," 80,000 cards
which catalog American theatrical
history from 1752 to 1960, repre
sents what may be the only com
prehensive index of the American
stage. As an example, there are over
200 cards just under the heading
"Macßeth."
Samuel Stark began the index
under the prodding of his friend
Cole Porter, who wanted him to do a

book on the American theater. The
book, which was to be entitled The
ater A to Z, only made it to A, but
the cards remain as a testimony to
his research of yesterday and a tool
for scholars today.
Many scholars have burrowed
through the collection in search of
some elusive theatrical curio for
their research, such as an author
from Germany who used the "Stark
Index" to pinpoint American pro
ductions of Max Rheinhart plays.
