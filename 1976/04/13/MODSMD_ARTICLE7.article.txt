### 
When the ASSU Senate ratified
amendments to the Legislative and judi
cial Charter of 1968 last spring, leading
the way to creation of the Stanford Judi
cial Council (SJC), did it violate its con
stitution?
Article IV, Section 1 of the ASSU Con
stitution states:
"The Association shall recognize the
authority of university judicial bodies
over members of the Association only if
those judicial bodies shall have been ap
proved by two-thirds of those members
of the Association voting in a general
election."
The SJC never received the necessary
two-thirds approval.
ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum ar
gues that the senate was merely approv
ing an amendment to the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968; hence, the ac
tion needed only a majority vote of the
senate. 13y this interpretation, critics
concede, the students would never have
had to vote on the matter at all.
Rosenbaum cites Article 111 of the char
ter, which permits amendments after
approval of the ASSU Senate, the
Academic Council and President
Richard Lyman.
From the administration's viewpoint,
this is the legal way to create a new judi
cial body. But this ignores the question
of whether the senate, in okaying the
amendment, violated its own constitu
tion, which is more stringent than the
charter.
The question is one of legitimacy.
Is the senate within its power
legitimizing a system which has not re

ceived the approval of two thirds of the
students?
The author of the ASSU Constitution
says no.
Denis Hayes, ASSU president in 1969
andaframerof the constitution (which
was referred to at the time as the "Hayes
Constitution"), was amazed, when con
tacted last night in Washington, D.C.,
that the two-thirds rule had been ig
nored.
"I can hardly think that the language
could be more clear," Hayes stated.
Hayes explained that the intent of the
framers in writing Article IV was to re
quire "substantial student approval"
any time the judicial system would be
changed.
Thus the two-thirds clause.
No org disputes Lyman's power to
institute any judicial system he desires.
In 1971, for example, he instituted the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) when the
ASSU Senate refused to nominate stu
dent members to the judicial body
operating at the time. That body, inci
dentally, had been ratified by a two
thirds vote of the students in 1968.
The CJP was held illegitimate by sev
eral ASSU Senates. The current senate
should similarly rule on the current SJC.
As Rosenbaum points out, the question
of constitutional interpretation is — in
the last analysis — the senate's to ans
wer.
What should come of all this? Hope
fully, a fully legitimized student judicial
system — it's what we want.
And it's what we need.

should similarly rule on the current SJC.
As Rosenbaum points out, the question
of constitutional interpretation is — in
the last analysis — the senate's to ans
wer.
What should come of all this? Hope
fully, a fully legitimized student judicial
system — it's what we want.
And it's what we need.
When the ASSU Senate ratified
amendments to the Legislative and judi
cial Charter of 1968 last spring, leading
the way to creation of the Stanford Judi
cial Council (SJC), did it violate its con
stitution?
Article IV, Section 1 of the ASSU Con
stitution states:
"The Association shall recognize the
authority of university judicial bodies
over members of the Association only if
those judicial bodies shall have been ap
proved by two-thirds of those members
of the Association voting in a general
election."
The SJC never received the necessary
two-thirds approval.
ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum ar
gues that the senate was merely approv
ing an amendment to the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968; hence, the ac
tion needed only a majority vote of the
senate. 13y this interpretation, critics
concede, the students would never have
had to vote on the matter at all.
Rosenbaum cites Article 111 of the char
ter, which permits amendments after
approval of the ASSU Senate, the
Academic Council and President
Richard Lyman.
From the administration's viewpoint,
this is the legal way to create a new judi
cial body. But this ignores the question
of whether the senate, in okaying the
amendment, violated its own constitu
tion, which is more stringent than the
charter.
The question is one of legitimacy.
Is the senate within its power
legitimizing a system which has not re

ceived the approval of two thirds of the
students?
The author of the ASSU Constitution
says no.
Denis Hayes, ASSU president in 1969
andaframerof the constitution (which
was referred to at the time as the "Hayes
Constitution"), was amazed, when con
tacted last night in Washington, D.C.,
that the two-thirds rule had been ig
nored.
"I can hardly think that the language
could be more clear," Hayes stated.
Hayes explained that the intent of the
framers in writing Article IV was to re
quire "substantial student approval"
any time the judicial system would be
changed.
Thus the two-thirds clause.
No org disputes Lyman's power to
institute any judicial system he desires.
In 1971, for example, he instituted the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) when the
ASSU Senate refused to nominate stu
dent members to the judicial body
operating at the time. That body, inci
dentally, had been ratified by a two
thirds vote of the students in 1968.
The CJP was held illegitimate by sev
eral ASSU Senates. The current senate
should similarly rule on the current SJC.
