# Student trustee
## 
### 
The Board of Trustees will today con
sider a proposal by the ASSU Council of
Presidents to place a student on the
board as a member with full voting
Hghts.
We urge the board not just to consider
and study this proposal, but to put a stu
dent member on the board.
First, students will pay $4275 in tui
tion and $1841 in room and board(pend
ing approval by the board) for a total of
$6116 next year. Tuition is a major
source of income for the University.
Since students alone pay tuition, they
should be allowed complete representa
tion on the board.
Second, times have changed. Not only
has tuition skyrocketed but students
have been delegated more responsibility
in University governance. Students cur
rently sit on trustee committees but not
with the status of members.

If the trustees feel they can allow stu
dents on committees, they should allow
one to be a member of the board.
We note the growing number of uni
versities with student trustees â€” includ
ing the University of California system.
These universities have continued to
function and grow with students as trus
tees.
Stanford, which prides itself as being
one of the leading American univer
sities, should continue to demonstrate
its leadership by approving a student
trustee.
Lastly, alumni under age 35 can be
elected to the board. We fail to see why,
for example, a 25-year-old alumnus or
alumna can be eligible for the board
while a 25-year-old student may not be
eligible.
The time has come for a student trus
tee.
