# Fee assessments

KZSU
The Daily urges a yes vote on the con
tinuation of KZSU's $1 fee assessment
for fall, winter and spring quarters.
KZSU has produced a responsible
budget for next year and has de
monstrated that the assessment is vital to
continue its operation.
The Daily also rebukes the University
tor restricting KZSU from approaching
major University donors for underwrit
ing funds. The University's claim that
KZSU's fund-raising efforts would inter
fere with the University's own fund
raising efforts are ridiculous since
KZSU's underwriting charges average
only a few hundred dollars a year.
Program fee
We also support the $1 assessment for
the Program Fee, distributed by the
ASSU Senate to various University or
ganizations. The Senate displayed a
good deal of balance and organization in
allocating the funds this year (in marked
contrast to the last year's all-night de
bate), and we look forward to continued
success next year.

Legal Counseling Office
The Daily recommends a yes vote for
the Legal Counseling Offices $1 fee as
sessment for fall and winter quarters.
The office receives all of its funds from
fee assessments and provides a neces
sary and useful service for students here.
LSJUMB
The Daily recommends a yes vote for
the band's $1 fee assessment for fall and
winter quarters. This money is used to
finance the band's travel expenses when
it plays at away games, and there will be
several of those (only four football games
are at home next year). The band, repre
senting the University, is good for the
school's reputation.
Daily'
Not surprisingly, we recommend a yes
vote on the $1, three quarter fee assess
ment requested by the Stanford Daily.
After careful scrutiny of the financial
statements made by the Daily's Board of
Directors, it appears that we need the
bucks.
