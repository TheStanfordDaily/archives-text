# Senate rejects anti-SJC resolution

The ASSU Senate last night rejected
a resolution that would have declared
the Stanford Judicial Council (SJC) il
legitimate. The vote was 5-4 with two
abstentions.
The resolution stated that there is
"no Legislative and Judicial Charter
and that any new Charter requires the
approval of two-thirds of the members
of the Association (student body) vot
ing in a general election."
The student vote to approve the cur
rent SJC last April fell far short of a
two-thirds majority and had a large
number of abstentions.
In a long, drawn-out debate last
night, Herb Borock, ASSU senate par
liamentarian in 1971, said that the
SJC's situation now is the same as its
situation in March 19(59. The senate
that year declared that there would be
no judicial system on campus unless
two-thirds of the student voters ap
proved such a system.
Not 'legitimate'
"Currently, there is no legitimate
system," Borock said. A "legitimate
system" could be initiated only if
"President (Richard) Lyman convenes
the SJC using constitutional powers,"
or if the ASSU senate held a special
election asking students if they ap
prove of the current SJC, he added.
The resolution was introduced by
Sen. Sarah Alfadl, who had earlier
suggested postponing debate until the
next senate meeting and forming an
ASSU subcommittee to "explore the
SJC issue."
Said Alfadl, "I'd like to be better in
formed on the issue."
Sen. CaroleHouck disagreed, saying
senators should have already "in
formed themselves" on the issue
realizing that it would be discussed at
the meeting.
Situation simplified
"This situation can be simplified. I
see no reason to draw it out and make it
complicated. Clearly, two-thirds of the
studeni body did not approve the SJC.
The referendum was ambiguous; there
was controversy," said Houck.
Dale Snape, former assistant dean of
students and currently a graduate bus
iness student, argued that the senate
last year "certified" the referendum
knowing the consequences of its ac
tion.
"The senate (in 1975) acted in good
faith. They did what they felt was
right," said Snape.
He contended that the current de
bate concerned only "minor
technicalities" and overlooked the fact
that the senate had "done its duty" by
ratifying the SJC referendum results
last year.
Council of Presidents (COP) Presi
dent Lee Rosenbaum said it was
"ridiculous" to bring up this topic
now.
'Fabricated issue'
"This is a fabricated issue brought
up by the Daily," Rosenbaum charged.
"After lIV 2 months, this issue has
been randomly pulled out of the con

stitution," said Rosenbaum.
In a written statement from the COP,
Rosenbaum emphasized that an
amendment to an already legitimized
judicial system rather than a new judi
cial charter was being approved at the
referendum.
An amendment only needs a major
ity vote to become enacted.
Rosenbaum also said, "Nothing
makes student government look more
idiotic than saying it's going to change
its mind."
