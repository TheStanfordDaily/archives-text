# Nuclear plants: targets
## 
### 
The current debate on the Nuclear
Safeguards Initiative raises some real ques
tions about the advisability of continued re
liance on nuclear power.
Though the debate has emphasized the
environmental aspects of the issue, of grea
ter importance are the questionable de
sirabiliy of an industry dependent on gov
erment subsidy and the threat to civil liber
ties of plants which require an extraordi
nary amount of security.
Based on information available, it is
reasonable to conclude that nuclear power
is environmentally safe, assuming normal
operation and no problems with waste stor
age facilities. When compared with the fos
sil fuel alternatives which America must
adopt in the absence of nuclear power, nuc
lear power is safer.
But a variety of factors not foreseen when
nuclear power was first developed have ari
sen to make the industry economically un
viable. Consequently, the American tax
payers are subsidizing the nuclear industry
and its customers.
Liability limits
The most important subsidy is the
Price-Anderson Act which limits the liabil
ity of private insurers of nuclear plants to
$125 million per accident. Though the
probability of a core melt is extremely low,
should it happen, the American people
would pickup the rest of the tab for the $3-5
billion in damages.
In addition, if President Ford has his way,
the American taxpayers will pay $(i.B bill
ion for a uranium enrichment plant for
commerical fuel needs. These subsidies are
in addition to the thousands of dollars in
advertising that the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission is doing at public expense.
In spite of all these subsidies, new orders
for nuclear plants declined from 27 in 1974

to five now. Only one company .Westing
house, is making a profit in the generation
of nuclear power.
Popularity decline
The reasons for the decline in the popu
larity of nuclear power are many. Electricity
demand has declined, there is a shortage of
capital for plant construction and the price
of uranium has skyrocketed to $47 a pound.
Its price may go as high as $:}()() as a result
of a uranium shortage.

Thus, savings to consumers from use of
nuclear power will probably be wiped out.
In fact, when indirect subsidies through
taxes are considered, such savings may not
exist even now.
Any idea that the people have an obliga
tion to subsidize any American industry is
absurd. If the utilities cannot provide nuc
lear power at a reasonable price without
subsidy, they should find another source of
electricity. The government should remove
its subsidies and let nuclear power rise or
fall on its own merits.
That alone, however, does not justify pas
sage of Proposition 15. A far more important
issue is that of security for nuclear plants.
Sabotage
Industry and goverment statistics show
that during normal operation, nuclear
power is safe. No study, however, takes into
account the issue of sabotage.

For example, a terrorist organization
could "plant" one of its members in a nuc
lear facility as an employe and, at the ap
propriate time, have the employe-saboteur
circumvent the safety systems or blow up
the plant, then shut off the cooling system to
cause a core melt down.
More likely, though, such an organization
would blackmail an already employed offi
cial at a nuclear plant into doing their dirty
work for them by, for example, kidnaping
his family.
Either of these possibilities becomes
frighteningly real in the light of the fact that
terrorist organizations made 99 threats
against nuclear facilities between 1969 and
1975.
Tighter security
As nuclear power grows, the public wel
fare will necessitate that the government
tighten security around nuclear plants as
well as protect employes and relatives.
In addition, the goverment may have to
impose restrictions on civil liberties as the
need for a war against terrorism becomes
essential with the existence of many sitting
targets.
Americans may end up sacrificing their
civil liberties for a few more kilowatts of
power, a price which is too high to pay. A
better solution would be to check the spread
of nuclear power.
Thus, although nuclear power is becom
ing increasingly unviable as a source of
energy and would probably be phased out
without government subsidies regardless of
what happens to Proposition 15, the threat
to civil liberties inherent in the existence of
many reactors as targets for terrorist activity
justifies restriction of nuclear power.
