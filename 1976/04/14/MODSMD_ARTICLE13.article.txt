Drinking contest
We believe that Kevin McDermott's al
leged first place finish in the individual
section of the Sigma Chi beer drinking
contest was accomplished in violation of
several cardinal rules of beer drinking.
Therefore, we urge that McDermott's
record (as reported in the April 8 Thurs
day) be revoked without delay.
Our first objection centers around
McDermott's conduct while he was being
timed. Observers of McDermott's perfor
mance were struck by how little beer he
actually consumed.
Most of his three beers were spilled on
his face, his body, and the Sigma
Chi lawn.
The Daily reported that McDermott's
feat was "incredible." But we see nothing
incredible about emptying three beer
cups in 5.95 seconds.
To legitimately win a beer drinking
contest, one must drink beer rather than
dribbling it onto the ground.
We are even more concerned, though,
with McDermott's conduct before his
clocking. It is a fact that McDermott
puked prior to recording his 5.95.
We feel that letting him continue after
such a breakdown made a travesty of beer
drinking.
Are baseball players allowed to keep
batting after three strikes have been cal
led? Are boxers allowed to keep fighting
after being knocked out? Of course not.
Similarly, after McDermott lost his
cookies, he should have gone back to the
dugout, rather than saying in the batter's
(hooter's?) box.
It is not too late to right these wrongs.
Prompt action by the Daily and by Sigma
Chi can make sure that the drinking
crown is awarded not to McDermott, but
to the man who deserves it — Randy
Swanson.
The courage and humility of Swanson
cannot adequately be conveyed in a mere
letter. Swanson clearly shot three beers in
8.85 seconds, a time we feel is incredible.
He accepted his second place with dig
nity.
bet us hope there is still sufficient jus
tice in this world to ensure that Swanson

will be granted his due honor.

Nuclear power
I would like to clarify a coupleof points
in the Daily's generally accurate April 7
summary of my talk on nuclear power.
With respect to radiation frcm nuclear
power plants, I pointed out that the En
vironmental Protection Agency esti
mated that the average population dose
from a thousand nuclear power plants
and associated reprocessing facilities
would be about one-half a unit (mr) of
radiation and this is what I compared to
the average natural background of 130 to
170 units per year to which all of us are
subjected.
The extra one-half unit is equivalent to
moving to a house 50 feet higher up a hill
and is one-twentieth of the added radia
tion received in moving from a wood to a
brick house.
It is true, as I stated, that recent studies
at Argonne National Laboratories as well
as past work leaves in doubt whether the
150 unit natural background radiation
levels are healthy or harmful, but lest I be
misinterpreted, I believe that unneces
sary radiation should be avoided. I would
not however move my house down the
hill or even recommend transferring from
Stanford to West Valley Junior College to
save 20 radiation units per year.
I also said that I didn't know how long
the archeologist would live, who in the
year 2576, unknowingly drilled down
2000 feet and fished up a piece of our
glassified waste, put it in his mouth to
determine its texture and then put it in his
pocket and took it home and used it as a
paperweight for the rest of his life.
However, I also said that if future gen
erations had an energy supply so that
civilization as we know it and medical
progress could continue, then the ar
cheologist might live to the ripe old age of
Job (140 years). However, if he died pre
maturelv it wouldn't be from our nuclear

waste.

Ezra Pound
Poor Ezra Pound! While he was being
imprisoned by the Americans whom he
had betrayed, the remnants of the mill
ions of Jews — including Anne Frank —
whom he had condemned to hell in his
broadcasts and writings, were being
raked up in the concentration camps.
I understand and admire his daughter
for defending him; Pound, the creative
eccentric, I understand rather less; Dana
Cioia, in his April 9 review, not at all.
Quite aside from the war-horrors,
Pound is. in the opinion of various good
critics, e.g. Malcolm Cowley, a rather
mediocre poet. After working actively as
a critic of poetry for 45 years, my own
re-reading tells me he is surprisingly
simplisticand jingly, almost sophomoric.
I doubt that this is bias: I regard T.S.
Eliot, somewhat similarly compromised
ethically, as the greatest poet of his time.
Pound was an important critic. We owe
him a considerable debt for his advice to
Eliot on The Wasteland and his general
influence on diction. No doubt he had
other qualities and was capable of being a
sympathetic father and friend (so was
Eichmann).
But Gioia misses the whole tone of the
Pound affair by a wide margin.

Israeli arabs
I would like to commend the Daily re
porter on his overall coverage of the Eliav
lecture which appeared April 0. How
ever, I am rather disturbed by his com
ments concerning the Israeli Arabs vis
a-vis the Israel Defense Forces.
His extracontextual use of the word
"ambivalent" somehow suggests that
there exists an uneasy distrust of Israeli
Arab citizens within tin; defense ministry.
Moreover. Kadden's statement that is

raeli Arabs are "not allowed to tight in
Israel's army" is not totally accurate and,
to my recollection, Mr. Eliav made no
such statement.
He merely explained that Israel does
not require from its Arab citizens a 2-3
year residence in the army, as it does in
the case of its Jewish inhabitants. The
basic motive for this policy is more
humanitarian than anything else — the
former should not have to be placed in the
agonizing predicament of conceivably
having to fight their own brothers or
cousins across the border.
However, as Mr. Eliav clearly stated,
the arrny welcomes volunteers from its
citizenry regardless of religious or ethnic
origin. Furthermore, there have been
many documented instances in the last
war in which Israeli Arabs voluntarily as
sumed the non-combatant roles vacated
by their Jewish neighbors. The issue was
not so much one of loyalty to the govern
ment, but rather a common sensitivity to
the fact that war creates suffering on both
sides.
In the hour of greatest need, one's
particular political or religious ideology
matters little.

Tennis tourney
I am writing to express my appreciation
to Dick Gould, Anne Hill and all the other
persons responsible for the tennis match
with Trinity College April 9-10.
The idea of playing a combined men's
and women's match is one which 1 hope
will be expanded upon in the future. The
tennis was. at times, outstanding and was
always very competitive.
Most of all. the players on both teams
are to be complimented for their
sportsmanship and sense of fair play.
This was a sports event in which
everyone emerged as a winner.
Now if only I can hit my forehand like
Susie Hagey, come to the net like Barb
Jordan, hit drop shots like Lele
Forood.. . .
