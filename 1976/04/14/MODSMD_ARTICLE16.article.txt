# Soviets deny visa to lecturer, then relent
## 
### 
Former Stanford lecturer Ad
rian Segall. to whom the Soviet
Union denied a visa to attend a
joint workshop in Moscow last
fall because of his Israeli citizen
ship, was later granted a visa and
did attend the workshop with
other American delegates.
The workshop, which was
sponsored by the Professional
Group on Information Theory of
the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (lEEE) and
a counterpart group of the
USSR Academy of Sciences,
was called off a week be

fore its scheduled date of Aug.
11,1975, because the lEEE dele
gates declared they would only
attend if all of their members had
been granted visas.
However, negotiations were
successful and the workshop
was held in Moscow during Dec.
14-22. Electrical Engineering
Prof. Thomas Kailath led the de
legation consisting of 10 mem
bers and five alternates to the
workshop, which was attended
by all the leading Soviet infor
mation and communication
theorists.

Preprints of all papers were
freely distributed, and a con
tinuation of the Cooperation Ag
reement was negotiated which
emphasized that the major
criterion for eligibility was sci
entific merit without regard to
citizenship or national origin.
John Thomas of the National
Science Foundation, the Ameri
can funding agency, believed
the American technical com
munity was indivisible and the
Soviet side should be required to
adhere to the terms of the origi
nal agreement.

The original agreement stipu
lated that "participation by lEEE
members from any country is not
excluded. It is understood that
scientists from each participat
ing country must arrange for na
tional sources of support.
"Both groups pledge them
selves to expend every effort to
facilitate participation by all in
terested members who have
made significant contributions
to the field."
The lEEE's group currently is
inviting applications by its
members for extended visits
from four to 24 weeks duration to
the Soviet Union.
There will be corresponding
visits of exchange visitors from
the Soviet Union at appropriate
and interested host institutions
in America, where the next joint

workshop will he held sometime
in 1977.
Segal 1 is currently an assistant
professor at the Massachusetts
institute of Technology.
