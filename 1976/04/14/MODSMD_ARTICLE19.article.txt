# Frat rush generates more interest
## 
### 
Inter-Fraternity Council
(IFC) President Bob Ottilie
said yesterday that interest in
fraternity living "appears to
be up significantly over last
year" based on attendance to
tals from the first week of the
fraternity rush.

Ottilie pointed to atten
dance at open houses at Delta
Tau Delta, which he said "far
surpassed anything there in
the past five years" and ex
ceeded last year's by 1000
percent.
The Dolts, suspended for

one year in 1973 for van
dalism, returned to campus
last year.
Aside from the Delt house,
fraternities generally enjoyed
attendance comparable with
last year's, according to IFC

Rush Chairman Tim Fergu
son.
Theta Delta Chi, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, Kappa Alpha,
Phi Delta Theta and Delta Up
silon were the most popular
houses in the first rush week,
he said.
