# COP candidates advocate return of Committee of 15
## 
### Jeff Tanji 
All four slates running for ASSU
Council of Presidents (COP) advocated
the reconvening of the Committee of
15 (C-15) to decide what to do about
the problem of the controversial Stan
ford Judicial Council (SJC).
One member from each slate was on
hand to field questions from listeners
in a broadcast on KZSU.
When questioned as to what basic

issue separated his slate and the one
headed by Vic Petroff, Dan Howard
said "We have a basic willingness to
work outside of the structure; if we run
into a brick wall while trying to work
with the system, we won't hesitate to
move outside of the system to organize
students to put non-violent pressure
on the administration."
"Our slate will work in a state of
cooperation with the administration,
but if we feel that nothing is happen

ing, then we also will go outside of the
system," countered Al Tomaszcz.uk,
representing the Petroff slate.
Stacked cards
"Perhaps the difference is that we
realize that the cards are stacked
against whoever takes office," said
Howard.
"We are in favor or increasing the
special events by the ASSU," said Tom
Galligan representing the D. Leight
slate. "Not necessarily the big events,
but ones that will bring the people to
gether — things in upstairs Tresidder,
small concerts and things."
"If apathy is your problem, we are
your slate," said Jon Barth, speaking
for the Hammer and Coffin slate. "I
don't mean to brag, but I have been
known to bring large crowds into a
frenzy."
"For our slate," said Tomaszczuk,
"tenure is the most important issue.
We recommend that a list should be
distributed by the administration in
dicating what professors are up for te
nure before the decisions are made;
students will have a chance to do
something before it is too late to
change the decision."
Student involvement
"Our slate has worked for some time
on the problem of tenure," said How
ard. "We need students involved with
the process.
"There should be a student commit
tee established with veto power; we
have to realize that tenure is not just
temporary but a long term problem."
"On the subject of tenure, our slate is
in favor of this: tenure for students,"
said Barth.
"It is pretty clear that we are all in
agreement over not returning the In
dian as our mascot," said Galligan.
"Our slate is in favor of making the
grape the new Stanford mascot. The
grape is a tiny little apathetic thing
that would best represent our univer
sity."
All four slates recommended that
the University should ban employers
who discriminate against gays from
the Career Planning and Placement
Center.

change the decision."
Student involvement
"Our slate has worked for some time
on the problem of tenure," said How
ard. "We need students involved with
the process.
"There should be a student commit
tee established with veto power; we
have to realize that tenure is not just
temporary but a long term problem."
"On the subject of tenure, our slate is
in favor of this: tenure for students,"
said Barth.
"It is pretty clear that we are all in
agreement over not returning the In
dian as our mascot," said Galligan.
"Our slate is in favor of making the
grape the new Stanford mascot. The
grape is a tiny little apathetic thing
that would best represent our univer
sity."
All four slates recommended that
the University should ban employers
who discriminate against gays from
the Career Planning and Placement
Center.

SENATE ACTION OK INACTION?—ASSU Senate Chairman Bill Hoke waves
a copy of the Legislative and fudicial Charter of 1968 during last night's
debate. The senate voted down a resolution declaring the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC) illegitimate.
All four slates running for ASSU
Council of Presidents (COP) advocated
the reconvening of the Committee of
15 (C-15) to decide what to do about
the problem of the controversial Stan
ford Judicial Council (SJC).
One member from each slate was on
hand to field questions from listeners
in a broadcast on KZSU.
When questioned as to what basic

issue separated his slate and the one
headed by Vic Petroff, Dan Howard
said "We have a basic willingness to
work outside of the structure; if we run
into a brick wall while trying to work
with the system, we won't hesitate to
move outside of the system to organize
students to put non-violent pressure
on the administration."
"Our slate will work in a state of
cooperation with the administration,
but if we feel that nothing is happen

ing, then we also will go outside of the
system," countered Al Tomaszcz.uk,
representing the Petroff slate.
Stacked cards
"Perhaps the difference is that we
realize that the cards are stacked
against whoever takes office," said
Howard.
"We are in favor or increasing the
special events by the ASSU," said Tom
Galligan representing the D. Leight
slate. "Not necessarily the big events,
but ones that will bring the people to
gether — things in upstairs Tresidder,
small concerts and things."
"If apathy is your problem, we are
your slate," said Jon Barth, speaking
for the Hammer and Coffin slate. "I
don't mean to brag, but I have been
known to bring large crowds into a
frenzy."
"For our slate," said Tomaszczuk,
"tenure is the most important issue.
We recommend that a list should be
distributed by the administration in
dicating what professors are up for te
nure before the decisions are made;
students will have a chance to do
something before it is too late to
change the decision."
