# FCC faces censorship suit
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” The
Federal Communications Com
mission (FCC) illegally insti
tuted "censorship" to trim sex
and violence from network tele
vision during "family viewing
time," a federal judge was told
last week.
"We will contend that what
was before editing by network
editors has now become censor
ship by government-influenced
censors," said an attorney repre
senting the Screenwriters Guild
and the Directors Guild of
America in their suit against the
three networks' "family viewing
time" policy and the FCC.
Lawyer Ronald L. Olson, in
opening remarks that began a
nonjury trial before U.S. District
Court Judge Warren J. Ferguson,
suggested ABC, NBC and CBS
succumbed to pressure from
FCC Chairman Richard Wyley in
late 1974 because the FCC was
then considering five proposed

regulations which the networks
feared could cut their combined
profits by $500 million a year.
The policy, which went into
effect on the networks last fall,
says programs in the first hour of
prime time and the hour im
mediately preceding must not be
offensive to a "general family
audience."
That covers the 7-9 p.m. time
period.
Named as defendants in the
suit are the FCC, the three net
works and the National Associa
tion of Broadcasters. The suit
seeks an injunction to prevent
the FCC from penalizing stations
which fail to comply with the
rule and to stop the networks
from prohibiting the broadcast
of controversial programs in that
time slot. The case is expected to
take at least four weeks.

The TV networks have said
that implementing family view
ing time was a voluntary action
aimed at curbing the amount of
violence and sexually explicit
material on television.
Olson, however, contended
that the concept was developed
by the FCC because the commis
sion was under pressure from
the House Appropriations
Committee, which controls its
funding, to take concrete action
against sex and violence on tele
vision.
He said the plaintiffs will call
as a witness Dr. Barry Cole, an
FCC consultant at the time the
rule was adopted, who will tes
tify that he participated in FCC
staff meetings in which specific
programs were singled out as
being unacceptable for children
in the first prime-time hour.
