# Student drama returns to Mem Aud stage
## 
### Gary Sprague 
This spring, for the first time in a
decade, a major student drama produc
tion will be presented on the Memorial
Auditorum stage.
The show is Guys and Dolls, pro
duced by the resurrected Ram's Head
student drama organization. The last
time Ram's Head was heard of on cam
pus, in Spring 1972, it produced a
musical version of Dracula. The show
was a box office flop and the organiza
tion quietly died.
Ram's Head was revived last spring
amid an upsurge of interest in student
drama. But the road to Memorial Au
ditorium was not an easy one. Ram's
Head leaders are still resentful about
what they consider to be bureaucratic
insensitivity and red tape on the part
of some University departments. They
feel that they have been subjected to
unfair business practices, footdrag
ging and political maneuvering.
Ram's Head is a student-run organi
zation, with about 175 students in
volved in the production of Guys and
Dolls. Although most of the produc
tion staff and cast have had some theat
rical experience, no more than 10 are
drama majors.
Self-supporting
Ram's Head is budgeted to be self
supporting. Gross revenues are pro
jected to be $10,000, and costs, includ

ing a $1500 contingency fund, are es
timated to be $9,900. The goal of self
sufficiency is a crucial one for Ram's
Head, for it was financial insolvency
which killed the organization four
years ago. Consequently, much of the
friction Ram's Head has experienced
with the University has been gener
ated over money matters.
One area of contention centers on
the Tresidder Ticket Office, which is
handling the Guys and Dolls tickets.
During the recent reorganization of
Tresidder Union, a new ticket pricing
policy was adopted. Tresidder now
keeps 18 cents out of every general
admission ticket sold, regardless of the
ticket's face value. Previously, Tresid
der had kept a percentage of the tic
ket's price.
George McMillan, a primary figure
in the Ram's Head revival, and pro
ducer ofGuys and Dolls, says that the
ticket policy unjustly discriminates
against low-priced student produc
tions.
"We set our tickets low enough so
that everyone can see the show,"
McMillan says."The guy who gets
nailed is the producer who charges a
dollar."
Tresidder contract
The contract with Tresidder also re
quires that Ram's Head employ Tre
sidder personnel to man the box office

during performances. Ram's Head will
pay about $1500 to Tresidder for
commissions and fees.
The biggest complaint among Ram's
Head leaders concerning Tresidder,
however, evolved through a misun
derstanding.
McMillan claims that all users of
Memorial Auditorium, except the
Flicks, are required to use the Tresid
der Ticket Office. The feeling that
Ram's Head was being railroaded into
an unsatifactory agreement with Tre
sidder caused much resentment
among the Ram's Head staff.
Dan Williams, director of Tresidder
Union, says that Rams Head is not re

quired to use the ticket office.
McMillan is unsure where the mis
conception started, and admits that
Rams 1 lead would probably have used
Tresidder to sell tickets in any case.
Dates conflict
Ram's Head also experienced fric
tion with the Drama Department. The
major conflict was over the scheduling
of dates for Memorial Auditorium.
The Drama Department and the Of
fice of Public Events have first priority
for dates, with organizations such as
Ram's Head having low priority. Even
tually, it took Ram's Head five months
to secure its four nights in April.
McMillan charges that the selection

process "contained politics," and that
at one point, some members of the de
partment had resolved to keep Guys
and Dulls out of Memorial Au
ditorium.
"Some people (in the department)
might feel somewhat threatened by se
eing Ram's Head shows sell out,"
McMillan says.
Political maneuvering
Susie Malouf, director of Guys and
Doils, also says she suspects political
maneuvering in the department.
"The fact that it took so long to get a
date" raised suspicions, Malouf says.
"Their excuses just seemed flimsy."
Mike Ramseur, who is responsible
for scheduling dates for the Drama De
partment, denies that there were any
politics involved in the selection pro
cess. Ram's Head entered the
scheduled process late, he says, and
each of their requests was foiled by
conflicts with previously scheduled
shows.
The resentment generated by the
scheduling problems caused the
Ram's Head leaders to look to SCIRE
instead of to the Drama Department for
academic credit for their work on the
production.
'Blow us out'
"We felt darn lucky to have the
stage," Malouf says,"and if we went to
the Drama Department for credit too,

they'd just blow us out of the office."
The bypassing of the department did
nothing to mollify feeligs between the
department and Ram's Head. Drama
Prof. Douglas Russell notes. Russell,
who was a member of Ram's Head as
an undergraduate, is now the Ram's
Head sponsor in the Drama Depart
ment.
Even after the dates were set, Ram's
Head ran into more problems. A major
complaint of the organization, Malouf
says, is that they were forced to apply
for services they felt the University
sould be able to provide without
charge.
"Like, we got no breaks."
One of those breaks Ram's Head
didn't get concerned the $100 a night
use fee for Memorial Auditorium. Not
ing that the Drama Department and the
Office of Public Events were exempt
from the use fee, Rams Head applied
for a waiver of the fee. The request was
denied.
The use fee policy is currently under
review, according to Tom Bacchetti,
director of the Office of Public Events.
Despite the frustrations Ram's Head
leaders have felt, participants and ob
servers agree that relations are now
amicable between Ram's Head and the
University. McMillan talks of "de
tente" and "rapport" with the various
departments.

musical version of Dracula. The show
was a box office flop and the organiza
tion quietly died.
Ram's Head was revived last spring
amid an upsurge of interest in student
drama. But the road to Memorial Au
ditorium was not an easy one. Ram's
Head leaders are still resentful about
what they consider to be bureaucratic
insensitivity and red tape on the part
of some University departments. They
feel that they have been subjected to
unfair business practices, footdrag
ging and political maneuvering.
Ram's Head is a student-run organi
zation, with about 175 students in
volved in the production of Guys and
Dolls. Although most of the produc
tion staff and cast have had some theat
rical experience, no more than 10 are
drama majors.
Self-supporting
Ram's Head is budgeted to be self
supporting. Gross revenues are pro
jected to be $10,000, and costs, includ

ing a $1500 contingency fund, are es
timated to be $9,900. The goal of self
sufficiency is a crucial one for Ram's
Head, for it was financial insolvency
which killed the organization four
years ago. Consequently, much of the
friction Ram's Head has experienced
with the University has been gener
ated over money matters.
One area of contention centers on
the Tresidder Ticket Office, which is
handling the Guys and Dolls tickets.
During the recent reorganization of
Tresidder Union, a new ticket pricing
policy was adopted. Tresidder now
keeps 18 cents out of every general
admission ticket sold, regardless of the
ticket's face value. Previously, Tresid
der had kept a percentage of the tic
ket's price.
George McMillan, a primary figure
in the Ram's Head revival, and pro
ducer ofGuys and Dolls, says that the
ticket policy unjustly discriminates
against low-priced student produc
tions.
"We set our tickets low enough so
that everyone can see the show,"
McMillan says."The guy who gets
nailed is the producer who charges a
dollar."
Tresidder contract
The contract with Tresidder also re
quires that Ram's Head employ Tre
sidder personnel to man the box office

during performances. Ram's Head will
pay about $1500 to Tresidder for
commissions and fees.
The biggest complaint among Ram's
Head leaders concerning Tresidder,
however, evolved through a misun
derstanding.
McMillan claims that all users of
Memorial Auditorium, except the
Flicks, are required to use the Tresid
der Ticket Office. The feeling that
Ram's Head was being railroaded into
an unsatifactory agreement with Tre
sidder caused much resentment
among the Ram's Head staff.
Dan Williams, director of Tresidder
Union, says that Rams Head is not re

quired to use the ticket office.
McMillan is unsure where the mis
conception started, and admits that
Rams 1 lead would probably have used
Tresidder to sell tickets in any case.
Dates conflict
Ram's Head also experienced fric
tion with the Drama Department. The
major conflict was over the scheduling
of dates for Memorial Auditorium.
The Drama Department and the Of
fice of Public Events have first priority
for dates, with organizations such as
Ram's Head having low priority. Even
tually, it took Ram's Head five months
to secure its four nights in April.
McMillan charges that the selection

process "contained politics," and that
at one point, some members of the de
partment had resolved to keep Guys
and Dulls out of Memorial Au
ditorium.
"Some people (in the department)
might feel somewhat threatened by se
eing Ram's Head shows sell out,"
McMillan says.
Political maneuvering
Susie Malouf, director of Guys and
Doils, also says she suspects political
maneuvering in the department.
"The fact that it took so long to get a
date" raised suspicions, Malouf says.
"Their excuses just seemed flimsy."
Mike Ramseur, who is responsible
for scheduling dates for the Drama De
partment, denies that there were any
politics involved in the selection pro
cess. Ram's Head entered the
scheduled process late, he says, and
each of their requests was foiled by
conflicts with previously scheduled
shows.
The resentment generated by the
scheduling problems caused the
Ram's Head leaders to look to SCIRE
instead of to the Drama Department for
academic credit for their work on the
production.
'Blow us out'
"We felt darn lucky to have the
stage," Malouf says,"and if we went to
the Drama Department for credit too,

they'd just blow us out of the office."
The bypassing of the department did
nothing to mollify feeligs between the
department and Ram's Head. Drama
Prof. Douglas Russell notes. Russell,
who was a member of Ram's Head as
an undergraduate, is now the Ram's
Head sponsor in the Drama Depart
ment.
Even after the dates were set, Ram's
Head ran into more problems. A major
complaint of the organization, Malouf
says, is that they were forced to apply
for services they felt the University
sould be able to provide without
charge.
"Like, we got no breaks."
One of those breaks Ram's Head
didn't get concerned the $100 a night
use fee for Memorial Auditorium. Not
ing that the Drama Department and the
Office of Public Events were exempt
from the use fee, Rams Head applied
for a waiver of the fee. The request was
denied.
The use fee policy is currently under
review, according to Tom Bacchetti,
director of the Office of Public Events.
Despite the frustrations Ram's Head
leaders have felt, participants and ob
servers agree that relations are now
amicable between Ram's Head and the
University. McMillan talks of "de
tente" and "rapport" with the various
departments.

insensitivity and red tape on the part
of some University departments. They
feel that they have been subjected to
unfair business practices, footdrag
ging and political maneuvering.
Ram's Head is a student-run organi
zation, with about 175 students in
volved in the production of Guys and
Dolls. Although most of the produc
tion staff and cast have had some theat
rical experience, no more than 10 are
drama majors.
Self-supporting
Ram's Head is budgeted to be self
supporting. Gross revenues are pro
jected to be $10,000, and costs, includ

ing a $1500 contingency fund, are es
timated to be $9,900. The goal of self
sufficiency is a crucial one for Ram's
Head, for it was financial insolvency
which killed the organization four
years ago. Consequently, much of the
friction Ram's Head has experienced
with the University has been gener
ated over money matters.
One area of contention centers on
the Tresidder Ticket Office, which is
handling the Guys and Dolls tickets.
During the recent reorganization of
Tresidder Union, a new ticket pricing
policy was adopted. Tresidder now
keeps 18 cents out of every general
admission ticket sold, regardless of the
ticket's face value. Previously, Tresid
der had kept a percentage of the tic
ket's price.
George McMillan, a primary figure
in the Ram's Head revival, and pro
ducer ofGuys and Dolls, says that the
ticket policy unjustly discriminates
against low-priced student produc
tions.
"We set our tickets low enough so
that everyone can see the show,"
McMillan says."The guy who gets
nailed is the producer who charges a
dollar."
Tresidder contract
The contract with Tresidder also re
quires that Ram's Head employ Tre
sidder personnel to man the box office

during performances. Ram's Head will
pay about $1500 to Tresidder for
commissions and fees.
The biggest complaint among Ram's
Head leaders concerning Tresidder,
however, evolved through a misun
derstanding.
McMillan claims that all users of
Memorial Auditorium, except the
Flicks, are required to use the Tresid
der Ticket Office. The feeling that
Ram's Head was being railroaded into
an unsatifactory agreement with Tre
sidder caused much resentment
among the Ram's Head staff.
Dan Williams, director of Tresidder
Union, says that Rams Head is not re

quired to use the ticket office.
McMillan is unsure where the mis
conception started, and admits that
Rams 1 lead would probably have used
Tresidder to sell tickets in any case.
Dates conflict
Ram's Head also experienced fric
tion with the Drama Department. The
major conflict was over the scheduling
of dates for Memorial Auditorium.
The Drama Department and the Of
fice of Public Events have first priority
for dates, with organizations such as
Ram's Head having low priority. Even
tually, it took Ram's Head five months
to secure its four nights in April.
McMillan charges that the selection

process "contained politics," and that
at one point, some members of the de
partment had resolved to keep Guys
and Dulls out of Memorial Au
ditorium.
"Some people (in the department)
might feel somewhat threatened by se
eing Ram's Head shows sell out,"
McMillan says.
Political maneuvering
Susie Malouf, director of Guys and
Doils, also says she suspects political
maneuvering in the department.
"The fact that it took so long to get a
date" raised suspicions, Malouf says.
"Their excuses just seemed flimsy."
Mike Ramseur, who is responsible
for scheduling dates for the Drama De
partment, denies that there were any
politics involved in the selection pro
cess. Ram's Head entered the
scheduled process late, he says, and
each of their requests was foiled by
conflicts with previously scheduled
shows.
The resentment generated by the
scheduling problems caused the
Ram's Head leaders to look to SCIRE
instead of to the Drama Department for
academic credit for their work on the
production.
'Blow us out'
"We felt darn lucky to have the
stage," Malouf says,"and if we went to
the Drama Department for credit too,

they'd just blow us out of the office."
The bypassing of the department did
nothing to mollify feeligs between the
department and Ram's Head. Drama
Prof. Douglas Russell notes. Russell,
who was a member of Ram's Head as
an undergraduate, is now the Ram's
Head sponsor in the Drama Depart
ment.
Even after the dates were set, Ram's
Head ran into more problems. A major
complaint of the organization, Malouf
says, is that they were forced to apply
for services they felt the University
sould be able to provide without
charge.
"Like, we got no breaks."
One of those breaks Ram's Head
didn't get concerned the $100 a night
use fee for Memorial Auditorium. Not
ing that the Drama Department and the
Office of Public Events were exempt
from the use fee, Rams Head applied
for a waiver of the fee. The request was
denied.
The use fee policy is currently under
review, according to Tom Bacchetti,
director of the Office of Public Events.
Despite the frustrations Ram's Head
leaders have felt, participants and ob
servers agree that relations are now
amicable between Ram's Head and the
University. McMillan talks of "de
tente" and "rapport" with the various
departments.
