# Sandoval climbs on
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
"Why do men climb mountains? It seems
obvious to him (the layman) that moun
taineers climb mountains to reach the top; but
that isn't n't true. They don't ... It is exciting
to reach a summit of course: but mountaineers
climb because they like climbing in itself, re
gardless of ends."
—John Sacks, from"The Butcher"
Why does Tony Sandoval run?
What has transformed the senior from Los
Alamos, N.M., into someone willing to run 100
to 150 miles a week year round? What causes
him to relinquish his refuge under the covers
for an early morning run?
With the records and awards he has amassed
during his running career, one speculates that
possibly he runs for prestige.
Prep records
Sandoval's laurels began with the New
Mexico prep two-mile record (9:10), two state
high school cross-country championshi ps plus
a pair of two-mile titles and a national junior
three-mile title.
His most recent accomplishment was a 20th
place finish in the International Cross-Country
Championships at Chepstow, Wales.
But walking into Sandoval's room at Theta
Delta Chi one realizes how improbable all that
speculation is. There is one plaque on the wall
and one trophy on the bookshelf.
Subtle items prove more revealing. The
half-dozen or so pairs of running shoes spilling
from his closet probably have more miles on
them than a good set of steel-belted radials.
Olympic trials
A letter from the U.S. Olympic Committee
sits on his desk. The letter contains details
about the Olympic marathon trials this May in
Eugene, Ore, which Sandoval has already qual
ified by running a 2:19:35 in his first crack at
the distance.
Only with the greatest reluctance will San
doval talk of his own achievements. After

meets, requests for comments are generally
met with directions to the coach and a dis
claimer that he has done nothing noteworthy.
An outlet
Sandoval says he sees running as an outlet
for meeting people.
"When 1 was in high school 1 got to know so
many guys," says Sandoval. "Distance runners
are pretty crazy. I'm crazy. Still, it seems like
most runners are really intelligent guys.'
He has also met and run with the famous;
Steve Prefontaine, Frank Shorter and many
other greats, hut it's one of the not-so-famous
who has left the greatest impression on Tony.
"1 am impressed by this Indian in New Mexico
who drives his pickup to all of the meets with
his family. He doesn't win, but he runs beauti
fully. If I could run like him, I know I could run
well."
"Smooth Sandoval"
Sandoval does run well. Propelling his lean,
5-8 frame around, his long strides seem effort
less. Track & Field News referred to him as
"smooth Sandoval". But a lot of work has gone
into creating that effect of effortlessness.
"In practice Sandy is in a class by himself for
pushing himself," says Stanford cross country
coach Marshall Clark.
Academically, Sandoval pushes himself just
as hard taking at least 20 units each quarter in a
double major of mechanical engineering and
pre-medicine.
"1 want to go home and practice medicine
there." says Sandoval,who will continue on to
medical school next year. "1 really know the
people there. They need help," he says of the
people in Las Truces, a small mining town 35
miles from Los Alamos.
Going through Stanford trying to get into
med school, why does Sandoval continue to
run?
"1 don't really know,"says Tony.
