# Will men's volleyball retain varsity club status?
## 
### Gary Sprague 
The Stanford men's volleyball
team will enter the Northern
California Collegiate Volleyball
Championships next weekend,
still unsure of its status next year
as a University funded program.
The spikers compiled a 10-1
league record this year, and will
host the championships in
Maples Pavilion on April 23.
Currently, the team is a club var
sity sport, which means it re
ceives limited financial support
from the Athletic Department.
The department currently is re

viewing the status of the team.
"Volleyball could go any of
three ways," coach Art Lambert
said. "It could become a club
sport, it could remain a club var
sity sport, or it could become a
varsity program."
Although there have been no
indications yet of the probable
result, Lambert says he is hope
ful that the Athletic Department
will choose the third course.
The difference will be felt
most immediately in the budget.
This year, the team had a budget
of $500, which covered one trip

to Southern California. Lambert
and the players pitched in to pay
for referees, and team members
paid their own travel expenses
on road trips. Junior Tim Wil
liams estimated that each
member spent $20-25, a figure
Lambert said was probably con
servative.
"But nobody's complaining,"
Lambert said. "Everyone's de
lighted to play."
When volleyball was elevated
to a club varsity sport at the be
ginning of this year, volleyball
was considered to be possibly a

revenue-producing sport.
"Of all the sports outside of
football and basketball," Lam
bert said, "volleyball has as good
a chance as any to become a re
venue producing sport." South
ern California schools draw from
2,000 to 10,000 fans for their
matches, he said, and there was
the possibility that the Stanford
team could do almost as well.
Lambert sees the lack of pub
licity as the crucial difference
between the Stanford and south
ern California programs.
"Volleyball is a great spectator

sport," Lambert said. "You don't
have to be a great afficiando of
the sport to appreciate it."
Lambert hopes that a good
team, campus publicity, and the
interest generated by the new
pro volleyball team in San Jose
will stimulate more interest in
the team next year.
Next year's team will see five
of the present top seven men re
turn. Juniors Tom Duralde,
Andy Fishburn, Tim Williams
and Charlie Cosgrove and
sophomore Mike Watt will all be
back.

Lambert noted that the team
will be both experienced and
composed mostly of seniors.
"Next year will be the year,"
he said.
When Lambert was asked by
Athletic Director Joe Reutz to
take over the volleyball team, he
was admittedly unfamiliar with
the sport. This season, Lambert
has been learning techniques
along with his players. Kyle
Mashima, who graduated this
winter, was the de facto coach
for the first half of the season.
"The program is directly due
to Kyle's enthusiasm and ef
forts," Lambert said.
As Lambert gained confi
dence, he was able to gradually
take control of the team.
"I like to think I know enough
to get us by, barely," he said.
The Northern California
championship tournament will
include Davis, Chico and San
Jose State. The Far West Tour
nament will be held on May 7-8
at Cal.
