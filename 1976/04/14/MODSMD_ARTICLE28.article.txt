## Sharing track's wealth 
### Chris Baker 
The rich get poorer.
Two years ago when UCLA destroyed
the Stanford track team 101-10 in one
half of a double dual meet here, Bruin
coach Jim Bush said that the NCAA's de
cision to limit track scholarships to 23
would help schools like Stanford.
"Payton (Jordan] is a great coach, he
proved it at Occidental, but poor Payton
just doesn't have the scholarships,"
lamented Bush. (April 1974)
But now that the NCAA has decided to
reduce the number of track grants to 14
it's poor Bush. The UCLA coach says that
the NCAA is trying to set the sport back
ten years.
Olympics hurt?
"The U.S. is going to fall behind other
countries in the Olympics because of
this," said Bush. "Athletes won't be able
to develop properly." (April 1976)
What he means is that UCLA, which
has won 01 of its last 02 dual meets,
won't be able to develop properly.
Bush has built a first-class track and
field program since coming to West wood
in 1905. Track now ranks behind basket
ball as the third biggest revenue produc
ing sport at UCLA.
Last year over 15,000 people filled
Drake Stadium for the USC-UCLA meet.
And Bush has put together one of the best
dual meet schedules in the country. He's
the Dick Could of track.
Track and Field News, "the bible for
track fans", has ranked the Bruins as the
No. 1 dual meet team for the last four
years.
23 grants
How many athletic grants does UCLA
give out for track and field? The Bruins
now offer close to the full 23 grants.
Stanford isn't able to offer even half
that number of grants for track.

The reason Bush was so happy when
the NCAA limited the number of grants
to 23, was because the Bruins would be
able to compete with schools such as
UTEP, which are able to travel to the
jungles of Africa to recruit.
Limiting track scholarships to 23 re
ally didn't affect the Robber Baron track
program. And the new limit won't matter
much. When you have less than 10 scho
larships to award, then limiting the
number to 23 only means that you won't
get beaten as badly.
No McTear
And many track athletes don't spend
as much time in the classroom as they do
on the track. Houston McTear has about
as much a chance of winding up on the
Farm as Stanford does of winning the
NCAA track crown this year.
That doesn't mean the Barons don't
give 110 percent (please excuse me for
lapsing into athletic department jargon).
When USC crushed Stanford, 105-35,
two weeks ago, the Barons had some
good individual marks. And when the
double dual moves to Stanford Stadium
this Saturday, 1 look for more of the same.
But the Bruins' string of dual meet
wins won't be in jeopardy thru Saturday.
When Bush said that his team would be
able to take it easy this week, he wasn't
too far off the mark. Besides, why let USC
have a sneak preview of UCLA at its best
before May 1 ?
The Bruins came away with a slim,
82-72, win over Oregon last week. UC
LA's super quarter iniler Bennie Myles,
who should lead the U.S. Olympic track
team this summer, was beaten twice by
the Ducks.
"If the USC meet were this week," said
Bush, "1 wouldn't sleep for the next six
days." But Bush, who is 50 going on 35,

is probably resting very comfortably this
week.
Track has returned
And Jordan isn't losing any sleep over
what figures to be UCLA'a 11th straight
win over Stanford on the track. After get
ting thrashed by the Trojans in
Westwood, he said, "Track is definitely
back at Stanford."
The way to have a successful track
program is to schedule good opponents
for your meets and then go out and pro
mote. All you have to do is walk on the
inside lane of the Stadium's track to
know why more dual meets haven't been
slated for the Farm.
Like the housing office, which prom
ised that the trailers would only be
around for a short while, the Athletic
Department has delayed putting in a new
track, despite the fact that the old one is a
couple years past its life expectancy.
Instead of putting up signs which
warn non-tracksters to keep off, they
should put up signs saying, "Caution:
Running On This Track Is Dangerous To
Your Legs."
But scholarships, bad track and all, the
Barons are still going to hold a track meet
this Saturday. And it should be a hell of a
meet.
Olympic preview
It will be a mini-preview of the Olym
pics, with more than 20 leading Olympic
track and field candidates on hand.
The last time the double dual was held
here over 12,000 fans were present. And
with good weather that figure should be
reached again this year. The Stanford Re
lays drew a fair crowd, considering that
it was competing with the NCAA basket
ball tournament.
Maybe the poor are getting richer.
