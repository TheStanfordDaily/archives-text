Baseballers drop one
Late inning rallies by theStan
ford baseball team fell short as
the Cards lost to San Francisco
8-4 in a game played yesterday
afternoon at USF.
Held scoreless through the
first six innings, the Cards
scored in each of the last three
innings. By then, though, USF
had notched four runs off Stan
ford starter John Yandle, and
another four off Jim Scharffen
berger who relieved in the
seventh.
The Cards scored one run in
both the seventh and the eighth
and then added two more on a
bases-loaded Larry Reynolds
singles in the ninth. But that was
the end of the rally.
In the first inning, Stanford
executed a triple play on an
inept bunt attempt by USF when
it had men on first and second.
The "bunt" was a line drive
into first baseman Tom Cuar
din's glove. Guardino threw to
second baseman Dave Perez who
was covering first, to double up
one runner, and Perez threw to
shortstop Steve Davis, who was
covering second, to triple up the
other runner.
The loss dropped Stanford's
season record to 27-16.
Chess
Overcoming a tight time limit,

the Stanford chess team tied for
second place in a field of 12
teams at the Pacific Coast Inter
collegiate Chess Championship,
held April 10-11 in Monterey.
The Robber Barons won $80 in
team prize money and compiled
a 3-1 record in the four-round
four-man team tournament.
The games were played with a
time limit of 40 moves in 90 mi
nutes. which, according to first
board Franklyn Yao, made time
pressure a factor in most games.
Yao and third board Lee Tien
both won two games, drew one
and lost out;. Second board Joel
Friedman won two and lost two,
and fourth board Ed Lipinsky
won all four of his games.
JV nine splits

State, the Stanford JV baseball
team "played well," according
to coach Tom Dunton.
The Cards lost the opener, 4-2,
but won the second game, 6-3.
Mark Abbondola pitched well
in the first game, Dunton said.
The freshman hurler yielded
only five hits in the seven inning
game, and Dunton said that Ab
bondola threw just 66 pitches, 51
of which were strikes.
In the second game, the Card
attack was paced by Kevin
Triggs, back from the varsity,
who had three hits.
The split sent the Cards' re
cord in the Bay Area Collegiate
League to Stanford trails 8-4
California. With eight of the re
maining ten games to be played
here, Dunton said he believes the
schedule will be a help, and that
the Card's still have a good shot

at the league title.

JV nine splits
Splitting a Monday doub
leheader here with San Jose

State, the Stanford JV baseball
team "played well," according
to coach Tom Dunton.
The Cards lost the opener, 4-2,
but won the second game, 6-3.
Mark Abbondola pitched well
in the first game, Dunton said.
The freshman hurler yielded
only five hits in the seven inning
game, and Dunton said that Ab
bondola threw just 66 pitches, 51
of which were strikes.
In the second game, the Card
attack was paced by Kevin
Triggs, back from the varsity,
who had three hits.
The split sent the Cards' re
cord in the Bay Area Collegiate
League to Stanford trails 8-4
California. With eight of the re
maining ten games to be played
here, Dunton said he believes the
schedule will be a help, and that
the Card's still have a good shot

at the league title.

Baseballers drop one
Late inning rallies by theStan
ford baseball team fell short as
the Cards lost to San Francisco
8-4 in a game played yesterday
afternoon at USF.
Held scoreless through the
first six innings, the Cards
scored in each of the last three
innings. By then, though, USF
had notched four runs off Stan
ford starter John Yandle, and
another four off Jim Scharffen
berger who relieved in the
seventh.
The Cards scored one run in
both the seventh and the eighth
and then added two more on a
bases-loaded Larry Reynolds
singles in the ninth. But that was
the end of the rally.
In the first inning, Stanford
executed a triple play on an
inept bunt attempt by USF when
it had men on first and second.
The "bunt" was a line drive
into first baseman Tom Cuar
din's glove. Guardino threw to
second baseman Dave Perez who
was covering first, to double up
one runner, and Perez threw to
shortstop Steve Davis, who was
covering second, to triple up the
other runner.
The loss dropped Stanford's
season record to 27-16.
