## 
### Neal Burstein 
Herant Katchadourian, originator of
the human sexuality course here, has
been appointed vice-provost and dean
of undergraduate studies, effective
Sept. 1. He will succeed Anthropology
Prof. James Gibbs, who has requested
to return to teaching and scholarship.
The appointment was approved by
the Board of Trustees yesterday.
Katchadourian said his "first and

most important function is to find out
what students, faculty and adminis
trators think are the most sa
lient . . . problems confronting under
graduate education at Stanford today
and in the foreseeable future."
He said he has "no intention of even
reducing" his undergraduate instruc
tion.
"I like to do that," he said, saying he
believes his position gives him an
"unusual opportunity to come into
contact with undergraduates for grea
ter effectiveness" as both a teacher and
administrator.
'Brilliant choice'
Dr. David Hamburg, a biology and
psychiatry professor, said Katchadou
rian's appointment was "a brilliant
choice, brilliant."
Hamburg cited excellent teaching,
experience with the human biology
program from its early beginnings,
capacity to understand different sides
of issues and care about quality as
some of Katchadourian's strengths.
As the University's first om
budsman, Katchadourian de
monstrated how strong graduate and
professional faculty can strengthen
undergraduate educational oppor
tunities, and has always proven "very
fair," Hamburg said.
President Richard Lyman stated that
Katchadourian's "outstanding skills
as an educator have long been evident.
His personal warmth, articulateness,
imagination, and energy will stand
him in good stead as he takes on new

and demanding responsibilities."
Of Gibbs. who will return to teach
ing in September, Lyman said, "I've
long admired his courage, devotion to
teaching and learning, and wide sym
pathies. I'm glad he will continue to
exercise these qualities for the benefit
of this University and its students."
Katchadourian was reluctant to de
tail any ideas he has for the Office of
Dean of Undergraduate Studies.
What others think
"I have goals in mind," he said, "but
before expressing them, it is necessary
to learn what others think. Under
graduate education is far too important
to constitute the private concern of a
select few."
He emphasized that he will remain
open to individual students, student
groups and faculty when he takes of
fice in September.
"I agree with Jim Gibbs that the dean
should provide 'an institutional ear'
for all those concerned with under
graduate education," Katchadourian
said.
Born in Turkey of Armenian parents
in 1933, Katchadourian received his
B.A. and M.D. degreescum laudefrom
the American University of Beirut, in
1954 and 1958, respectively. He was
elected to Alpha Omega Alpha medi
cal honorary society, and took resi
dency training at the University of
Rochester.
Coordinator
He came to Stanford in 1966 as coor
dinator of the psychiatry residency
