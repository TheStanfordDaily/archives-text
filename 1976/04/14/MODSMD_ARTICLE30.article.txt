# Stanford sports flashback
## 
### 
With the big double dual track
meet coming up this Saturday at
Stanford Stadium, the sports
flashback remembers one of
Stanford's greatest track stars,
middle distance runner Ben
Eastman.
"Blazin' " Ben, as he was cal
led, came from nearby Burl in
game High School and attended
Stanford in the early 1930'5.
As a freshman, Eastman sur
prised many track observers
when he cruised the 440 yard
dash in 48.4 seconds, setting a
frosh record which stood until
1965.
During his junior year,
Eastman became a world record
holder. On March 26, 1932 on
the Angell Field track (yes, Stan
ford track meets used to be held
there), Eastman shattered the
existing 440 world mark by a
second, clocking a 46.4.
Dink Templeton, the school's
track coach from 1921-39, plot
ted a revolutionary strategy for
Eastman's record breaking race.
The idea was for "Blazin' " Ben
to burn the early part and then
try to finish with what he had
left.
Eastman stuck to the plan,
passing the 220 pole in 21.3 (the
regular 220 was won in 21.4 that
day), and then continued
through the tape for the new
mark.
Two weeks later, again at
Angell Field, Eastman added his
second world standard, this time
in the half mile.
Though he had little experi
ence in the two lapper, Eastman
employed a similar strategy to
that he had used in the 440. He
started fast, passed the quarter
mile in 53.5 (most top half milers
then ran around a 58 first lap),
and finally stopped the watches
in 1:51.3, bettering the previous
record by three-tenths of a sec
ond.
Eastman made record break
ing a habit, also establishing
marks in the 400 and 800 meters
and for the 600 and 1000 yard
runs, besides anchoring a Stan
ford mile relay foursome to the
world standard.
It was an Olympic year in 1932
and of course Eastman was in
Los Angeles for the Games.
Hampered by a sinus infection,
he still gained a silver medal in
the 400 meters.
During his final season at
Stanford, Eastman ran the shor
ter sprints in an attempt to im
prove his speed and finishing
kick, but pulled a muscle and
missed two months of his senior
campaign.

and for the 600 and 1000 yard
runs, besides anchoring a Stan
ford mile relay foursome to the
world standard.
It was an Olympic year in 1932
and of course Eastman was in
Los Angeles for the Games.
Hampered by a sinus infection,
he still gained a silver medal in
the 400 meters.
During his final season at
Stanford, Eastman ran the shor
ter sprints in an attempt to im
prove his speed and finishing
kick, but pulled a muscle and
missed two months of his senior
campaign.

With the big double dual track
meet coming up this Saturday at
Stanford Stadium, the sports
flashback remembers one of
Stanford's greatest track stars,
middle distance runner Ben
Eastman.
"Blazin' " Ben, as he was cal
led, came from nearby Burl in
game High School and attended
Stanford in the early 1930'5.
As a freshman, Eastman sur
prised many track observers
when he cruised the 440 yard
dash in 48.4 seconds, setting a
frosh record which stood until
1965.
During his junior year,
Eastman became a world record
holder. On March 26, 1932 on
the Angell Field track (yes, Stan
ford track meets used to be held
there), Eastman shattered the
existing 440 world mark by a
second, clocking a 46.4.
Dink Templeton, the school's
track coach from 1921-39, plot
ted a revolutionary strategy for
Eastman's record breaking race.
The idea was for "Blazin' " Ben
to burn the early part and then
try to finish with what he had
left.
Eastman stuck to the plan,
passing the 220 pole in 21.3 (the
regular 220 was won in 21.4 that
day), and then continued
through the tape for the new
mark.
Two weeks later, again at
Angell Field, Eastman added his
second world standard, this time
in the half mile.
Though he had little experi
ence in the two lapper, Eastman
employed a similar strategy to
that he had used in the 440. He
started fast, passed the quarter
mile in 53.5 (most top half milers
then ran around a 58 first lap),
and finally stopped the watches
in 1:51.3, bettering the previous
record by three-tenths of a sec
ond.
Eastman made record break
ing a habit, also establishing
marks in the 400 and 800 meters
and for the 600 and 1000 yard
runs, besides anchoring a Stan
ford mile relay foursome to the
world standard.
It was an Olympic year in 1932
and of course Eastman was in
Los Angeles for the Games.

he still gained a silver medal in
