Kissinger warns of communism
WASHINCTON — Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
said yesterday that "a new opportunity for outside pres
sures" would result if local Communist parties shared
power in.Western Europe.
"The United States must not give the impression that it
could be indifferent to such developments," Kissinger
told the annual meeting of the American Society of News
paper Editors.

loosen ties with the United States while giving Western
