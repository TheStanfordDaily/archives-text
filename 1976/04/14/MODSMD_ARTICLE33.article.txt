# No Trustees support
## Student rep issue delayed 
### Jack Vaughn Mark Shibuya 
The Board of Trustees yesterday
postponed final action on a proposal
by the ASSIJ Council of Presidents
(COP) that the board accept a student
member, but Vice President for Public
Affairs Robert' Rosenzweig said "no
support for it (the proposal) was ex
pressed publicly by any member of the
board."
ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum
said the COP began sending board
President Robert Minge Brown infor
mation on precedents at other univer
sities for student board members last
month.
Rosenzweig said the board post
poned action until its June meeting be
cause "some of the new members, who
were not here at the time of the last
major discussion of the matter in 1968.
wanted to seethe supporting material"
from the COP before voting.
Letter
He added that the board sent the
COP a letter this morning announcing
the postponement and pointing out
the lack of board support for the stu

dent member proposal.
Rosenbaum said last night he would
wait for the board's letter to comment
on the absence of board support, but
said he was happy the board consi
dered the proposal.
"We're pleased that the board was
willing to consider and discuss the
concept of a student trustee," Rosen
baum said. "It shows that in the seven
years that students have served on
board committees, the bo ird has come
to take their concerns and opinions
seriously."
$2 million proposal
In other action, the board approved a
$2 million proposal to double the
capacity of the University's central
plant air conditioning water supply.
The cold water is supplied to re
search facilities, libraries and large
classrooms.
The proposed expansion includes
construction of two 1000-ton electric
chillers and a four million gallon un
derground water tank near the central
plant and the Pine Hall Computation
Center parking lot.
The new equipment would be used
to service buildings now under con
struction or those definitely slated for
construction.
The central plant currently uses
steam absorbers, which run on natural
gas or oil, to chill water for air condi
tioning.
Electricity use
According to Central Plant Superin
tendent Warren Weeks, using electric
ity at night, a low demand period,
costs less than using natural gas. The
period of greatest need is during the
day, Weeks said. A four million gallon
tank would allow water to be chilled
nightly by electricity and daily natural
gas, he explained.
Weeks commented that the tank is
the first of its scale, although similar
hot water tanks are used in Europe.
Utilities Manager Robert McKnight
said the project would conserve
energy because "excessive mechanical
equipment" would not be necessary

and the new system would eventually
save the University money.
The underground tank would effi
ciently use land because it could sup
port "a two story wood or steel-frame
stucco building," said Mcknight.
John Lerry. manager of constructor
and engineering at the planning office
pointed out the "peripheral benefits'
of the new system. He noted that the
water could be used for fire fighting
emergency drinking water for the hos
pital. or to "make up water for tlu
boiler plant."
"In an earthquake, the pipes leading
to the boiler are one? of the first thing!
to go." said Lerry. "A four million gal
lon tank of potable water is nice tc
have."

Center parking lot.
The new equipment would be used
to service buildings now under con
struction or those definitely slated for
construction.
The central plant currently uses
steam absorbers, which run on natural
gas or oil, to chill water for air condi
tioning.
Electricity use
According to Central Plant Superin
tendent Warren Weeks, using electric
ity at night, a low demand period,
costs less than using natural gas. The
period of greatest need is during the
day, Weeks said. A four million gallon
tank would allow water to be chilled
nightly by electricity and daily natural
gas, he explained.
Weeks commented that the tank is
the first of its scale, although similar
hot water tanks are used in Europe.
Utilities Manager Robert McKnight
said the project would conserve
energy because "excessive mechanical
equipment" would not be necessary

and the new system would eventually
save the University money.
The underground tank would effi
ciently use land because it could sup
port "a two story wood or steel-frame
stucco building," said Mcknight.
John Lerry. manager of constructor
and engineering at the planning office
pointed out the "peripheral benefits'
of the new system. He noted that the
water could be used for fire fighting
emergency drinking water for the hos
pital. or to "make up water for tlu
boiler plant."
"In an earthquake, the pipes leading
to the boiler are one? of the first thing!
to go." said Lerry. "A four million gal
lon tank of potable water is nice tc
have."
The Board of Trustees yesterday
postponed final action on a proposal
by the ASSIJ Council of Presidents
(COP) that the board accept a student
member, but Vice President for Public
Affairs Robert' Rosenzweig said "no
support for it (the proposal) was ex
pressed publicly by any member of the
board."
ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum
said the COP began sending board
President Robert Minge Brown infor
mation on precedents at other univer
sities for student board members last
month.
Rosenzweig said the board post
poned action until its June meeting be
cause "some of the new members, who
were not here at the time of the last
major discussion of the matter in 1968.
wanted to seethe supporting material"
from the COP before voting.
Letter
He added that the board sent the
COP a letter this morning announcing
the postponement and pointing out
the lack of board support for the stu

dent member proposal.
Rosenbaum said last night he would
wait for the board's letter to comment
on the absence of board support, but
said he was happy the board consi
dered the proposal.
"We're pleased that the board was
willing to consider and discuss the
concept of a student trustee," Rosen
baum said. "It shows that in the seven
years that students have served on
board committees, the bo ird has come
to take their concerns and opinions
seriously."
$2 million proposal
In other action, the board approved a
$2 million proposal to double the
capacity of the University's central
plant air conditioning water supply.
The cold water is supplied to re
search facilities, libraries and large
classrooms.
The proposed expansion includes
construction of two 1000-ton electric
chillers and a four million gallon un
derground water tank near the central
plant and the Pine Hall Computation
Center parking lot.
The new equipment would be used
to service buildings now under con
struction or those definitely slated for
