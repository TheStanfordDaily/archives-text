Apparently all that is necessary for
the release of Fernando Flores. a com
puter scientist and former Chilean
cabinet minister who has been offered
a research associate position here, is
approval by the Chilean government.
"All that remains to free Flores is
Augusto Pinochet's (head of the milit
ary junta) signature," said Computer
Science Department Chairman Robert
Floyd.
"U.S. visas are waiting for him, his
wife and their five children as soon as
Pinochet gives his personal permis
sion to free him," Floyd said.
Obtaining Pinochet's signature is
proving to be the most difficult obsta
cle in a five-month effort to secure the
release of Flores.
No charges have been brought
against him, but he has been held by
the Chilean government since shortly
after the September 1973 overthrow of
Marxist President Salvador Allende's
government.
Various groups in both the United

States and Chile have been working
constantly for Flores' release since
September 1973, according to Sally Li
lienthal, national secretary of Amnesty
International, a world-wide organiza
tion seeking freedom for political pris
oners.
"Stanford has worked very hard for
his release," she said.
Law School Dean Charles Meyers vi
sited Flores in prison and requested
his immediate release.
President Richard Lyman wrote
Pinochet a personal letter in February
requesting Flores' release.
Emeritus Economics Prof. Edward
Shaw declined an invitation by the
Organization of American States to at
tend an economics conference, be
cause, he said, Flores was held "with
out public charges against him."
Lilienthal said that although Flores
has long been on a list of prisoners the
Chilean government has refused to
free, her organization "is more hopeful
than we have been for a while" of
his release.
