# Disturbed children treated in surrogate home
## 
### Phyllis Amabile 
If you bicycle down Channing Ave.
in Palo Alto looking for Learning
House, you're likely to miss it when
you first ride past. It's a converted Vic
torian carriage house set back from the
road behind a long, grassless front
yard, scattered bushes and ivy-covered
trees.
The house and the Channing Market
next door, seem anachronistic amid
the high-rise Channing House across
the street and the Webster Oak Apart
ments next door.
While sitting on the sunny wooden
porch, surrounded by potted straw
berry begonias and wandering jews,
and listening to the birds in the trees,
it's easy to believe you're nowhere

near the center of a city. The shingles
could use some paint and the broken
screens some mending, but the house
has a warm and welcoming air about it.
Learning House is a residential
treatment center for behaviorally dis
turbed children. Six children from
ages 7 to 14 reside at the home with the
"teaching parents," a young married
couple with no children of their own.
While removing a child from his
normal home setting, Learning House
attempts to provide him with as much
of a family environment as is possible.
The goal of the teaching parents is to
return each child to his home, hope
fully after having helped him to ac
quire greater self-management and
more social skills.

Learning House employs a "token
economy" program geared towards
the child's acquisition of more self
control that is individually tailored to
each one's behavioral difficulties and
needs.
The child's "target behaviors" (be
haviors to be increased or decreased in
frequency) are first discussed with
him. Once goals have been agreed
upon, his progress is charted in terms
of behavior frequencies per day. Since
the information is always available to
him, the child can evaluate his own
progress, even on a long-term basis.
The residents of Learning House
spend every weekend at home. Chip
Haven and fane Becker-Haven, who
are program coordinators for Learning

House, explain that progress evalua
tions involve not only the child's in
teractions with his teaching parents,
peers, and classmates, but with his
natural parents as well.
Often the children's problems in
volve the inability of their parents to
interact successfully with them. The
program therefore often involves
working closely with parents and
other family members to improve the
entire network of family interactions.
Each week the families are coun
seled in self-management techniques
and teaching parents exchange prog
ress reports with the families.
Chip Haven describes this aspect of
the program as vital to the realization
of Learning House's goal to return each
child to his home. "Learning House
should always be the second most de
sirable place for the child to be," he
says.
Effective program
Although the information available
on former Learning House residents is
small, the Havens say the program
seems to be an effective one. Of the 13
Learning House "graduates," only one
had difficulties later that necessitated
his return to the facility.
And of the 20 children who have
been associated with Learning House
during the past four years, all but two
are no longer institutionalized.
Becker-Haven points out that more
attention needs to be given to the chil
dren's successes and failures in coping
with life after their release from Learn
ing House. She hopes to introduce a
"continuing care program" beginning
in July to help ease their difficulties.
Two such pilot programs are currently

in progress.
Learning House residents come to
Palo Alto from all of the Bay Area
counties. The most common referral is
through the Juvenile Probation De
partment (if the child has committed a
law violation) or through a Social Ser
vices Agency (if the child's family is
unable to control his behavior).
At the initial hearing, one of two
probationary statuses are assigned.
The child can be named a "ward of the
court," or the parent and court may
have "shared custody." Occasionally
in the past, the child remained com
pletely in the custody of the parents
who voluntarily placed him in Learn
ing House.
When the child is a ward of the
court, there is a yearly hearing to re
viewthe probationary status. This con
tinues until both the child's and fami
ly's progress indicate that certain
criteria have been met so that the child
can be returned to parental custody.
The average length of stay at Learning
House, however, is only 10 months.
Origins
The idea of establishing a residential
treatment facility for behaviorally dis
turbed children in Palo Alto actually
originated in 1972 with three Stanford
educators: Drs. Steve Zifferblatt, Mike
Mahoney and Carl Thoresen. The
Junior League of Palo Alto offered
community financial support.
Learning House has never had any
formal ties with Stanford. There is.
however, a Student Involvement prog
ram created by Brian Yates, a doctoral
candidate in the psychology depart
ment.
Yates introduced the program.

which he describes as a "paraprofes
sional training system" as a course
under the departments of psychology
and education at both Stanford and
San Jose State. The course is currently
directed by Stan Klein, a 1975 Stanford
graduate.
Yates describes the consistency of
the environment Learning House of
fers as perhaps its most beneficial
quality. Since the child knows what to
expect and what is expected of him, it
is easier for him to progress toward
meeting the criteria required for a
permanent return to his family.
'Regular kids'
While at Learning House, the chil
dren are like "regular kids in the com
munity," Yates says. They attend Ad
dison public school, can earn the
privilege of playing unsupervised in
the neighborhood, and use community
facilities regularly.
Every couple of weeks there is a day
trip, and at least once a year, each child
is given the opportunity to attend a
week of camping with the YWCA or
Scouts. Often the camp waives the
normal fees for Learning House resi
dents. During the past two summers,
the children have spent a week camp
ing at Lake Tahoe with their teaching
parents.
Those affiliated with Learning
House describe it with an obvious en
thusiasm and pride. "Institutions and
foster homes often simply don't
work," says Yates.
"You'd have to visit Learning House
to know what I mean. There's a special
sense of warmth about it."

to know what I mean. There's a special

If you bicycle down Channing Ave.
in Palo Alto looking for Learning
House, you're likely to miss it when
you first ride past. It's a converted Vic
torian carriage house set back from the
road behind a long, grassless front
yard, scattered bushes and ivy-covered
trees.
The house and the Channing Market
next door, seem anachronistic amid
the high-rise Channing House across
the street and the Webster Oak Apart
ments next door.
While sitting on the sunny wooden
porch, surrounded by potted straw
berry begonias and wandering jews,
and listening to the birds in the trees,
it's easy to believe you're nowhere

near the center of a city. The shingles
could use some paint and the broken
screens some mending, but the house
has a warm and welcoming air about it.
Learning House is a residential
treatment center for behaviorally dis
turbed children. Six children from
ages 7 to 14 reside at the home with the
"teaching parents," a young married
couple with no children of their own.
While removing a child from his
normal home setting, Learning House
attempts to provide him with as much
of a family environment as is possible.
The goal of the teaching parents is to
return each child to his home, hope
fully after having helped him to ac
quire greater self-management and
more social skills.

Learning House employs a "token
economy" program geared towards
the child's acquisition of more self
control that is individually tailored to
each one's behavioral difficulties and
needs.
The child's "target behaviors" (be
haviors to be increased or decreased in
frequency) are first discussed with
him. Once goals have been agreed
upon, his progress is charted in terms
of behavior frequencies per day. Since
the information is always available to
him, the child can evaluate his own
progress, even on a long-term basis.
The residents of Learning House
spend every weekend at home. Chip
Haven and fane Becker-Haven, who
are program coordinators for Learning

House, explain that progress evalua
tions involve not only the child's in
teractions with his teaching parents,
peers, and classmates, but with his
natural parents as well.
Often the children's problems in
volve the inability of their parents to
interact successfully with them. The
program therefore often involves
working closely with parents and
other family members to improve the
entire network of family interactions.
Each week the families are coun
seled in self-management techniques
and teaching parents exchange prog
ress reports with the families.
Chip Haven describes this aspect of
the program as vital to the realization
of Learning House's goal to return each
child to his home. "Learning House
should always be the second most de
sirable place for the child to be," he
says.
Effective program
Although the information available
on former Learning House residents is
small, the Havens say the program
seems to be an effective one. Of the 13
Learning House "graduates," only one
had difficulties later that necessitated
his return to the facility.
And of the 20 children who have
been associated with Learning House
during the past four years, all but two
are no longer institutionalized.
Becker-Haven points out that more
attention needs to be given to the chil
dren's successes and failures in coping
with life after their release from Learn
ing House. She hopes to introduce a
"continuing care program" beginning
in July to help ease their difficulties.
Two such pilot programs are currently

in progress.
Learning House residents come to
Palo Alto from all of the Bay Area
counties. The most common referral is
through the Juvenile Probation De
partment (if the child has committed a
law violation) or through a Social Ser
vices Agency (if the child's family is
unable to control his behavior).
At the initial hearing, one of two
probationary statuses are assigned.
The child can be named a "ward of the
court," or the parent and court may
have "shared custody." Occasionally
in the past, the child remained com
pletely in the custody of the parents
who voluntarily placed him in Learn
ing House.
When the child is a ward of the
court, there is a yearly hearing to re
viewthe probationary status. This con
tinues until both the child's and fami
ly's progress indicate that certain
criteria have been met so that the child
can be returned to parental custody.
The average length of stay at Learning
House, however, is only 10 months.
Origins
The idea of establishing a residential
treatment facility for behaviorally dis
turbed children in Palo Alto actually
originated in 1972 with three Stanford
educators: Drs. Steve Zifferblatt, Mike
Mahoney and Carl Thoresen. The
Junior League of Palo Alto offered
community financial support.
Learning House has never had any
formal ties with Stanford. There is.
however, a Student Involvement prog
ram created by Brian Yates, a doctoral
candidate in the psychology depart
ment.
Yates introduced the program.

which he describes as a "paraprofes
sional training system" as a course
under the departments of psychology
and education at both Stanford and
San Jose State. The course is currently
directed by Stan Klein, a 1975 Stanford
graduate.
Yates describes the consistency of
the environment Learning House of
fers as perhaps its most beneficial
quality. Since the child knows what to
expect and what is expected of him, it
is easier for him to progress toward
meeting the criteria required for a
permanent return to his family.
'Regular kids'
While at Learning House, the chil
dren are like "regular kids in the com
munity," Yates says. They attend Ad
dison public school, can earn the
privilege of playing unsupervised in
the neighborhood, and use community
facilities regularly.
Every couple of weeks there is a day
trip, and at least once a year, each child
is given the opportunity to attend a
week of camping with the YWCA or
Scouts. Often the camp waives the
normal fees for Learning House resi
dents. During the past two summers,
the children have spent a week camp
ing at Lake Tahoe with their teaching
parents.
Those affiliated with Learning
House describe it with an obvious en
thusiasm and pride. "Institutions and
foster homes often simply don't
work," says Yates.

If you bicycle down Channing Ave.
in Palo Alto looking for Learning
House, you're likely to miss it when
you first ride past. It's a converted Vic
torian carriage house set back from the
road behind a long, grassless front
yard, scattered bushes and ivy-covered
trees.
The house and the Channing Market
next door, seem anachronistic amid
the high-rise Channing House across
the street and the Webster Oak Apart
ments next door.
While sitting on the sunny wooden
porch, surrounded by potted straw
berry begonias and wandering jews,
and listening to the birds in the trees,
it's easy to believe you're nowhere

near the center of a city. The shingles
could use some paint and the broken
screens some mending, but the house
has a warm and welcoming air about it.
Learning House is a residential
treatment center for behaviorally dis
turbed children. Six children from
ages 7 to 14 reside at the home with the
"teaching parents," a young married
couple with no children of their own.
While removing a child from his
normal home setting, Learning House
attempts to provide him with as much
of a family environment as is possible.
The goal of the teaching parents is to
return each child to his home, hope
fully after having helped him to ac
quire greater self-management and
more social skills.

Learning House employs a "token
economy" program geared towards
the child's acquisition of more self
control that is individually tailored to
each one's behavioral difficulties and
needs.
The child's "target behaviors" (be
haviors to be increased or decreased in
frequency) are first discussed with
him. Once goals have been agreed
upon, his progress is charted in terms
of behavior frequencies per day. Since
the information is always available to
him, the child can evaluate his own
progress, even on a long-term basis.
The residents of Learning House
spend every weekend at home. Chip
Haven and fane Becker-Haven, who
are program coordinators for Learning

House, explain that progress evalua
tions involve not only the child's in
teractions with his teaching parents,
peers, and classmates, but with his
natural parents as well.
Often the children's problems in
volve the inability of their parents to
interact successfully with them. The
program therefore often involves
working closely with parents and
other family members to improve the
entire network of family interactions.
Each week the families are coun
seled in self-management techniques
and teaching parents exchange prog
ress reports with the families.
Chip Haven describes this aspect of
the program as vital to the realization
of Learning House's goal to return each
child to his home. "Learning House
should always be the second most de
sirable place for the child to be," he
says.
Effective program
Although the information available
on former Learning House residents is
small, the Havens say the program
seems to be an effective one. Of the 13
Learning House "graduates," only one
had difficulties later that necessitated
his return to the facility.
And of the 20 children who have
been associated with Learning House
during the past four years, all but two
are no longer institutionalized.
Becker-Haven points out that more
attention needs to be given to the chil
dren's successes and failures in coping
with life after their release from Learn
ing House. She hopes to introduce a
"continuing care program" beginning
in July to help ease their difficulties.
Two such pilot programs are currently

in progress.
Learning House residents come to
Palo Alto from all of the Bay Area
counties. The most common referral is
through the Juvenile Probation De
partment (if the child has committed a
law violation) or through a Social Ser
vices Agency (if the child's family is
unable to control his behavior).
At the initial hearing, one of two
probationary statuses are assigned.
The child can be named a "ward of the
court," or the parent and court may
have "shared custody." Occasionally
in the past, the child remained com
pletely in the custody of the parents
who voluntarily placed him in Learn
ing House.
When the child is a ward of the
court, there is a yearly hearing to re
viewthe probationary status. This con
tinues until both the child's and fami
ly's progress indicate that certain
criteria have been met so that the child
can be returned to parental custody.
The average length of stay at Learning
House, however, is only 10 months.
Origins
The idea of establishing a residential
treatment facility for behaviorally dis
turbed children in Palo Alto actually
originated in 1972 with three Stanford
educators: Drs. Steve Zifferblatt, Mike
Mahoney and Carl Thoresen. The
Junior League of Palo Alto offered
community financial support.
Learning House has never had any
formal ties with Stanford. There is.
however, a Student Involvement prog
ram created by Brian Yates, a doctoral
candidate in the psychology depart
ment.
Yates introduced the program.

which he describes as a "paraprofes
sional training system" as a course
under the departments of psychology
and education at both Stanford and
San Jose State. The course is currently
directed by Stan Klein, a 1975 Stanford
graduate.
Yates describes the consistency of
the environment Learning House of
fers as perhaps its most beneficial
quality. Since the child knows what to
expect and what is expected of him, it
is easier for him to progress toward
meeting the criteria required for a
permanent return to his family.
'Regular kids'
While at Learning House, the chil
dren are like "regular kids in the com
munity," Yates says. They attend Ad
dison public school, can earn the
privilege of playing unsupervised in
the neighborhood, and use community
facilities regularly.
Every couple of weeks there is a day
trip, and at least once a year, each child
is given the opportunity to attend a
week of camping with the YWCA or
Scouts. Often the camp waives the
normal fees for Learning House resi
dents. During the past two summers,
the children have spent a week camp
ing at Lake Tahoe with their teaching
parents.
Those affiliated with Learning
House describe it with an obvious en
thusiasm and pride. "Institutions and
foster homes often simply don't
work," says Yates.
