# Gay job discrimination
## 
### 
Richard Thomas

President Lyman has accepted Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons' recommendation that will
allow the University to continue the full facilita
tion of employers who discriminate against Stan
ford students on a basis that can be clearly shown
not to be job-related.
The Gay People's Union here finds this recom
mendation unacceptable. Gay students are, and
always have been, members of the Stanford com
munity. We will neither tolerate nor accept a less
than equal status in that community.
I regret that the University administration pre
sently lacks the courage to protect the human
rights of one of its most abused minorities. The
gay student deserves the same consideration and
equal access to employment that other students
unconsciously expect and receive, and for the
University to facilitate the violation of that stu
dent's rights is an unconscionable abdication of
responsibility by the University administration.
Closeted gay students make up Stanford's
largest minority group, and they are continually
subjected to discrimination, intolerance and
ridicule not only in society at large, but also
within the University. (See the campus "humor"
magazine for examples.)
Basic rights
The University administration's failure to up
hold the basic human rights of the closeted gay
student, who is isolated not only from the support
of his friends but even of his own family, indicates
an insensitivity that is inexcusable.
The lack of human concern for the well-being of
students is clear in Lyons' memorandum which,
while attentive to the consequences to employers
of adding a "gnat" of regulation, remains utterly
oblivious to the damaging effects of the decision
upon the personal lives of the students he is here
to serve.
It is particularly ironic that when Native
Americans challenge the use of the Indian as a
mascot, the administration decides that the Uni
versity is a community that has an obligation to all

its members to do what it can to insure that none
are the victims of arbitrary discrimination,
ridicule, or unfair treatment.
Assaulted rights
When the human rights and human dignity of
the gay student are assaulted, that community
disappears, and the University becomes a
bureaucratic machine that must limit its actions to
only academic judgments and those required by
law. Was this the same kind of reasoning used by
the administrators of universities in Hitler's Ger
many when the rights of their Jewish students and
professors were threatened?
Gay students pay tuition and gay alumni make
donations. Since we fulfill all the responsibilities
and obligations that other students and alumni
meet, we expect the University to insure equal
treatment. We deserve no less.
But the University refuses even to require the
employer to state whether he discriminates. (Even
if he does the University feels compelled to assist
him in the continuation of this practice.) Lyons
says that the University has no sanctions except to
deny recruiting.
No imagination
1 say Lyons has no imagination. Why not re
quire the firm to display a sign at the interview
table stating the fact that his firm discriminates?
That is certainly a sanction, and one that denies
access to no one.
Other universities have taken action. San
Diego State has banned military recruiters from
student facilities because they discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation, and the USC Law
School prohibits the use of its placement center by
any firm that discriminates on that basis.
Lyons' recommendation is inadequate and we
shall ask that the Gommittee on Services to Stu
dents reconsider the issue next year and in each
succeeding year until we obtain the equal treat
ment that is rightfully ours.

Basic rights
The University administration's failure to up
hold the basic human rights of the closeted gay
student, who is isolated not only from the support
of his friends but even of his own family, indicates
an insensitivity that is inexcusable.
The lack of human concern for the well-being of
students is clear in Lyons' memorandum which,
while attentive to the consequences to employers
of adding a "gnat" of regulation, remains utterly
oblivious to the damaging effects of the decision
upon the personal lives of the students he is here
to serve.
It is particularly ironic that when Native
Americans challenge the use of the Indian as a
mascot, the administration decides that the Uni
versity is a community that has an obligation to all

its members to do what it can to insure that none
are the victims of arbitrary discrimination,
ridicule, or unfair treatment.
Assaulted rights
When the human rights and human dignity of
the gay student are assaulted, that community
disappears, and the University becomes a
bureaucratic machine that must limit its actions to
only academic judgments and those required by
law. Was this the same kind of reasoning used by
the administrators of universities in Hitler's Ger
many when the rights of their Jewish students and
professors were threatened?
Gay students pay tuition and gay alumni make
donations. Since we fulfill all the responsibilities
and obligations that other students and alumni
meet, we expect the University to insure equal
treatment. We deserve no less.
But the University refuses even to require the
employer to state whether he discriminates. (Even
if he does the University feels compelled to assist
him in the continuation of this practice.) Lyons
says that the University has no sanctions except to
deny recruiting.
No imagination
1 say Lyons has no imagination. Why not re
quire the firm to display a sign at the interview
table stating the fact that his firm discriminates?
That is certainly a sanction, and one that denies
access to no one.
Other universities have taken action. San
Diego State has banned military recruiters from
student facilities because they discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation, and the USC Law
School prohibits the use of its placement center by
any firm that discriminates on that basis.
Lyons' recommendation is inadequate and we
shall ask that the Gommittee on Services to Stu
dents reconsider the issue next year and in each
succeeding year until we obtain the equal treat
ment that is rightfully ours.

President Lyman has accepted Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons' recommendation that will
allow the University to continue the full facilita
tion of employers who discriminate against Stan
ford students on a basis that can be clearly shown
not to be job-related.
The Gay People's Union here finds this recom
mendation unacceptable. Gay students are, and
always have been, members of the Stanford com
munity. We will neither tolerate nor accept a less
than equal status in that community.
I regret that the University administration pre
sently lacks the courage to protect the human
rights of one of its most abused minorities. The
gay student deserves the same consideration and
equal access to employment that other students
unconsciously expect and receive, and for the
University to facilitate the violation of that stu
dent's rights is an unconscionable abdication of
responsibility by the University administration.
Closeted gay students make up Stanford's
largest minority group, and they are continually
subjected to discrimination, intolerance and
ridicule not only in society at large, but also
within the University. (See the campus "humor"
magazine for examples.)
