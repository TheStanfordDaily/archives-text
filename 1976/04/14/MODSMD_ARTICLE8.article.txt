The Daniels/Reznick letter in
the Daily, April 6, criticizing the
Graduate Student Council (GSC)
demands reponse. As one of the
handful of founding members of
the Stanford Teaching and Re
search Employees Union, of
which Ms. Daniels was not, and
as a member of the original GSC,
I have witnessed the growth (and
decline) and accomplishments
of both groups.
The GSC was indeed founded
by former Graduate Division
Dean Lincoln Moses in response
to demands for pay increases
from the union. Moses re
sponded to the demands by
claiming that we, the Union, did
not represent a majority of the
students, and added that he
would establish a "more rep
resentative" body to convey stu
dent interests to him. This tactic
was most likely employed in
order to assure the administra
tion freedom from dealing with
the more "radical" and outspo
ken of the students.
The union continued organiz
ing and growing through the
spring, but could make no
headway in obtaining needed in
formation from the administra
tion or in further pressing its
demands.
Organization
In the fall of 1974 the GSC was
organized; it was not quite the

docile and competing organiza
tion Daniels describes, but in
cluded in its membership many
union members who were there
to see that the union's interests
were not subverted. We found
there a number of other students
with the same goals and in
terests.
Two main points should be
conveyed to Daniels and Re
znick. First, the GSC has not
been a rubber stamp, but has
dealt with a number of thorny
issues with some significant re
sults.
The GSC Financial Aids
Committee was able to obtain
data concerning the distribution
of graduate students' support
and its sources over the last ten
years, albeit without the full
cooperation of the administra
tion. This could not have been
accomplished by the union as
was illustrated by the attempts of
the physics union to obtain this
information under court sub
poena (they obtained informa
tion for one year only).
Stipends increased
From this information the
Committee attempted to derive a
financial program which would
both increase stipends and
realistically consider the Uni-

versity's financial position.
For the first time since 1967
students received a raise in their
support levels, from $2100 to
$2300, with a raise this year to
$2400. In a year when most as
pects of the University budget
were being sharply cut that was
not a small accomplishment.
Finally, the fact that the mem
bership of the union has dwin
dled, and that no major issues
have been actively pursued
under Daniel's leadership is
more likely a reflection on the
current leadership than on the
existence of the GSC.
In addition, it would be useful
for Daniels and Reznick to recall
that solidarity is the first order of
radical politics, and that in ig
noring this dictum they have fal
len prey to the old "divide and
conquer" tactic.
The only way in which we can
achieve student TA and RA
goals is to unify ourselves be
hind these common goals.
