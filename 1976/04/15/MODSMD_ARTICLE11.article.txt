in New York City." said Dißiaso.
Schmalzried. who averaged
18.2 points, 19 2 rebounds and
6.88 blocked shots per game for
Cardinal Gibbons High Scool. was
an All-State pick for the last two

Schmalzried, was heavily re
cruited by Wake Forest. Duke and
Vanderbilt. The center shot 613

Both players add speed and
quickness that will help build the
type of running game we want to
have here, said Dißiaso

sign these two players first be
