# Visiting Harvard prof sees new multinational conflict
## 
### Marc Strassman 
"Conflict is inevitable" between
developing countries and multina
tional corporations according to
Raymond Vernon, professor of in
ternational management at the
Harvard Business School.
Vernon gave the keynote ad
dress at a symposium Tuesday on
"Multinationals in Developing
Countries."
The program, sponsored by the
International Development Group
at the business school here, drew
a capacity crowd of 350 to Bishop
Auditorium.
Vernon, director of the "Multina
tional Enterprise Project" at Har
vard and the author of
Sovereignty at Bay: The Multi
national Spread of U.S. Enter
prises, said that "multinationals
are the consequence and not the
cause of the increased inter
dependence that now charac
terizes the world."
However, multinationals are
"growing rather faster
than . . . other forms of inter
dependence," he said.
Blamed for ills
"The multinational," said Ver
non, "serves as a surrogate, a
lightening rod, for other concerns"
associated with the "development
process," including "high levels of
unemployment, conspicuous
consumption and overspending
by the rich, inequities of income
distribution, a general tawdriness,
pollution, hucksterism and too
much advertising."
He said that multinationals are
not responsible for these prob
lems, but that they "can be made
to stand for five or six different ills
because they're foreign, because
they're enterprises and because
they're American—all of which are
cause for revulsion in the post-
Vietnam period."

Said Vernon, "Multinationals
can be parsimoniously pelted with
eggs because by that process one
can kill five birds with one stone.'
'Absolescing Bargain'
Vernon said that as time goes
by relations between developing
countries and multinational corpo
rations come to be characterized
by "the absolescing bargain."
According to this "bargain," the
initial gratitude of countries for in
fusions of finance capital and new
technology are replaced by a
"What have you done for me
lately?" attitude.
"Conflicts are inevitable for this
strange institution that fits awk
wardly into a world of nations. It is
difficult to the point of being im
possible for the underdeveloped
nations. It is difficult to the point of
being impossible for the underde
veloped nations to solve the un
derlying problem of interdepen
dence without the multinationals
except at a great cost, which they

cannot pay," Vernon said.
Following Vernon's presenta
tion, Gerald Meier, professor of in
ternational economics at the busi
ness school, lauded multinational
corporations for seeking to im
pose on the world a system of "ef
fective comparative advantage"
for which the "result would be the
same as world free trade, the
equivalent to a world central
plan."

Blamed for ills
"The multinational," said Ver
non, "serves as a surrogate, a
lightening rod, for other concerns"
associated with the "development
process," including "high levels of
unemployment, conspicuous
consumption and overspending
by the rich, inequities of income
distribution, a general tawdriness,
pollution, hucksterism and too
much advertising."
He said that multinationals are
not responsible for these prob
lems, but that they "can be made
to stand for five or six different ills
because they're foreign, because
they're enterprises and because
they're American—all of which are
cause for revulsion in the post-
Vietnam period."

Said Vernon, "Multinationals
can be parsimoniously pelted with
eggs because by that process one
can kill five birds with one stone.'
'Absolescing Bargain'
Vernon said that as time goes
by relations between developing
countries and multinational corpo
rations come to be characterized
by "the absolescing bargain."
According to this "bargain," the
initial gratitude of countries for in
fusions of finance capital and new
technology are replaced by a
"What have you done for me
lately?" attitude.
"Conflicts are inevitable for this
strange institution that fits awk
wardly into a world of nations. It is
difficult to the point of being im
possible for the underdeveloped
nations. It is difficult to the point of
being impossible for the underde
veloped nations to solve the un
derlying problem of interdepen
dence without the multinationals
except at a great cost, which they

cannot pay," Vernon said.
Following Vernon's presenta
tion, Gerald Meier, professor of in
ternational economics at the busi
ness school, lauded multinational
corporations for seeking to im
pose on the world a system of "ef
fective comparative advantage"
for which the "result would be the
same as world free trade, the
equivalent to a world central
plan."
"Conflict is inevitable" between
developing countries and multina
tional corporations according to
Raymond Vernon, professor of in
ternational management at the
Harvard Business School.
Vernon gave the keynote ad
dress at a symposium Tuesday on
"Multinationals in Developing
Countries."
The program, sponsored by the
International Development Group
at the business school here, drew
a capacity crowd of 350 to Bishop
Auditorium.
Vernon, director of the "Multina
tional Enterprise Project" at Har
vard and the author of
Sovereignty at Bay: The Multi
national Spread of U.S. Enter
prises, said that "multinationals
are the consequence and not the
cause of the increased inter
dependence that now charac
terizes the world."
However, multinationals are
"growing rather faster
than . . . other forms of inter
dependence," he said.
