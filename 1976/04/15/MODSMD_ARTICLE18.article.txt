# Council passes bike bridge plan
## 
### Ute Plumbohm 
The Menlo Park City Council
voted unanimously Tuesday night
to go ahead with plans to build a
new bicycle bridge between
Menlo Park and the University.
The bridge will span the San
Francisquito Creek near the Med
ical Center at San Mateo Drive.
Menlo Park Bikeways Chair
man Janice La Fetra, speaking in
favor of the San Mateo Drive loca
tion, called the proposed site the
safest and most convenient place
for the bridge.
Other locations under consid
eration were University Street and
Arbor Street in Menlo Park.
Opposing arguments came
from residents who said they
feared the bridge would cause an
increase in vandalism. La Fetra
said the Palo Alto ana Menlo Park
police departments had assured
her there have been no com
plaints concerning other bicycle
bridges in the area.
Other opposition arguments

centered on problems of litter,
noise, bicycle accidents, harm to
trees in the area and the possible
effect of the bridge on area prop
erty values.
Supporters contended that
bicyclists using the bridge would
be safer than those using El
Camino Real to travel between
the University and Menlo Park.
They also said the site would be
convenient for shoppers on their
way to the Stanford Shopping
Center.
"If the majority wants a bridge,"
said one young supporter, "the
majority should have a bridge."
The council's action is the last
step in appropriating the neces
sary $70,000 for construction from
Palo Alto, which will pay 50 per
cent, San Mateo County, which
will pay 25 percent, and Menlo
Park, which will now pay 25 per
cent.
The University has agreed to
provide a path on one side of the
bridge.
