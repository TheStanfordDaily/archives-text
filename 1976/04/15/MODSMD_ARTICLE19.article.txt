# Experts discuss health care costs
## 
### Sharyl Van Winkle 
Dramatically increasing costs
rather than inequity and ineffi
ciency will finally force changes in
the nation's health care system, a
panel of health experts concluded
Tuesday night.
Philip Lee. former assistant
secretary of the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare,
Mitchell Spellman, professor
of surgery at UCLA and USC.and
San Francisco Chronicle sci
ence writer David Pertman dis
cussed the "Politics of Health
Care" as part of the Human Biol
ogy program.
There are too many powerful in
terest groups interested only in
"their own survival" for changes to
come without a crisis, Lee said.
He named drug companies, the
health insurance industry and
physicians as major vested in
terests.
"We haven't opted for equity,

but quality," Lee said, so those
fortunate enough to receive good
health care are unlikely to comp
lain.
Since the present system,
which demands fees for medical
services, has no built-in cost
cutting incentives for the health
industry, "technological prolifera
tion" and physicians' "sub
specialization" cause costs to rise
without end, he said.
He predicted what he termed
"the worst kind of changes" were
likely: "Price controls and surveil
lance of the doctor patient rela
tionship' by government.
These changes are probable
because politicians who would
enact them "work through an ad
versary process, not a rational
process," he said.
All three panelists agreed that
private health insurance would not
work well in the future, but pre
dicted it would remain because of
the political necessity to "buy into
the existing system" rather than
creating a radically new one, as
Lee put it.
In discussing ideal solutions to
the national health problem,
Spellman described a system
which would integrate preventive
and primary care into a system of
health services centered in the
community and allowing citizen
participation.
As an example. Perlman cited a
training program for barbers in
Rochester, N Y., which taught
methods of spotting drug abuse,
alcoholism, skin disease and ven
ereal disease in customers
The team lecture was the third
in the Human Biology Program s
"Science and Public Policy lec
ture series. The series is required
for students in Human Biology 4,
but is designed to be a public in
formation program as well.
Earlier lectures have dealt with
the public policy issues surround
ing "Abortion and Fetal Re
search," in addition to scientific
problems intertwined in the cur
rent controversy.
The final lecture in the series,
held last night, featured Gerard
Piel, the editor of Scientific Ameri
can. and Kaiser Family Founda
tion President Robert Glaser
speaking on "An End to Welfare
Medicine."

The team lecture was the third
in the Human Biology Program s
"Science and Public Policy lec
ture series. The series is required
for students in Human Biology 4,
but is designed to be a public in
formation program as well.
Earlier lectures have dealt with
the public policy issues surround
ing "Abortion and Fetal Re
search," in addition to scientific
problems intertwined in the cur
rent controversy.

held last night, featured Gerard
Piel, the editor of Scientific Ameri

speaking on "An End to Welfare
Medicine."
Dramatically increasing costs
rather than inequity and ineffi
ciency will finally force changes in
the nation's health care system, a
panel of health experts concluded
Tuesday night.
Philip Lee. former assistant
secretary of the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare,
Mitchell Spellman, professor
of surgery at UCLA and USC.and
San Francisco Chronicle sci
ence writer David Pertman dis
cussed the "Politics of Health
Care" as part of the Human Biol
ogy program.
There are too many powerful in
terest groups interested only in
"their own survival" for changes to
come without a crisis, Lee said.
He named drug companies, the
health insurance industry and
physicians as major vested in
terests.
"We haven't opted for equity,

but quality," Lee said, so those
fortunate enough to receive good
health care are unlikely to comp
lain.
Since the present system,
which demands fees for medical
services, has no built-in cost
cutting incentives for the health
industry, "technological prolifera
tion" and physicians' "sub
specialization" cause costs to rise
without end, he said.
He predicted what he termed
"the worst kind of changes" were
likely: "Price controls and surveil
lance of the doctor patient rela
tionship' by government.
These changes are probable
because politicians who would
enact them "work through an ad
versary process, not a rational
process," he said.
All three panelists agreed that
private health insurance would not
work well in the future, but pre
dicted it would remain because of
the political necessity to "buy into
the existing system" rather than
creating a radically new one, as
Lee put it.
In discussing ideal solutions to
the national health problem,
Spellman described a system
which would integrate preventive
and primary care into a system of
health services centered in the
community and allowing citizen
participation.
