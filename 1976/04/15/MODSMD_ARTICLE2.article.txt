# Under the tenure gun

(Editor's Note: This story is in response to comments
from professors on last March's Thursday issue on te

tenure, you don't know what the hell is going on. The
standards for tenure are really useless. You can

still don't know if you stand a chance. It all comes down to
who's pulling for you to get tenure, and who's lined up
against you. It all comes down to politics."
One junior faculty member expressed his feelings on
the pressures of trying to get tenure in those terms. Many
of his fellow faculty members agree that the political
questions involved in tenure decisions can often be the

major ones.

according to Assoc. History Prof. Barton Bernstein. "I
don't mean narrow disputes such as those between Re
publicans and Democrats. Rather, I am referring to broad
differences, such as controversies over the role of the
University or basic ideological disagreements."
Other faculty members say they believe that the poli

put off those making the decision," Education Prof.
Robert Textor states.
There are several cases in which these types of politi

for denial of tenure:
