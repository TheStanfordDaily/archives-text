# Under the tenure gun
## 
### Andrew Leuchter 
(Editor's Note: This story is in response to comments
from professors on last March's Thursday issue on te
nure that indicated that that story failed to uncover a
large reason for tenure denials, namely, political ac
tivities.
Until "you get a final decision saying 'yes' or 'no' on
tenure, you don't know what the hell is going on. The
standards for tenure are really useless. You can
publish dozens of articles, win the Gores Award and you
still don't know if you stand a chance. It all comes down to
who's pulling for you to get tenure, and who's lined up
against you. It all comes down to politics."
One junior faculty member expressed his feelings on
the pressures of trying to get tenure in those terms. Many
of his fellow faculty members agree that the political
questions involved in tenure decisions can often be the

major ones.
"Politics plays a substantial role in tenure decisions,"
according to Assoc. History Prof. Barton Bernstein. "I
don't mean narrow disputes such as those between Re
publicans and Democrats. Rather, I am referring to broad
differences, such as controversies over the role of the
University or basic ideological disagreements."
Other faculty members say they believe that the poli
tics of tenure can be personal as well. "In any large
organization, there are unorthodox, abrasive people who
put off those making the decision," Education Prof.
Robert Textor states.
There are several cases in which these types of politi
cal consideration have allegedly formed part of the basis
for denial of tenure:
—The case of a former faculty
member in engineering, who al
legedly alienated the senior fa
culty members in his department
by taking a stand against the war
in Vietnam and by participating in
the movement to send food and
medicine to North Vietnam;
—The case of former Asst. Prof,
of German Juan Flores. who al
legedly alienated administrators
by taking a stand against the war
in Vietnam, and by paticipating in
local politics (such as a sit-in at a
local hospital);
—The case of Asst Prof, of In

dustrial Engineering Douglas
Daetz, who claims that he was
denied tenure at least partly on the
basis of his intervention in a stu
dent judicial case, and a
memorandum he authored which
cnticized tenure policy.
Single answer?
The tenure decision is not a
single "yes" or "no" answer. It in
volves several levels of decision
making. When a member of the
professoriate is considered for te
nure, an ad hoc committee is ap
pointed within his/her department
to evaluate the work of the candi
date. The committee then pre

sents its findings to the senior fa
culty in the department, who vote
whether to recommend tenure.
The department head
must then approve or disapprove
the faculty recommendation, and
forward it to the dean of the
school. The dean then approves
or disapproves the department
recommendation, and forwards it
to the provost, who makes a deci
sion which must be approved by
the Board of Trustees.
According to Daetz, this multi
tiered decision-making process
has evolved into a "blackball sys
tem." He claims that "because of

the budget crunch, it is taking
more and more support at every
level (of decision-making) to get
through a recommendation for te
nure. It is getting to the point
where one person you have alien
ated at any level can stop you from
getting tenure."
'Blackball system'
Textor agrees that "we are get
ting closer to a blackball system."
Daetz says he believes that it is
not uncommon for tenure candi
dates "who meet minimal criteria
(to be) .. . turned down because
they have alienated senior faculty
members, or the administration."

One junior faculty member who
agrees with Daetz pointed out
"they can always claim that your
scholarship is not good enough.
Every department makes the mis
take of taking in a certain number
of people that its faculty won't like.
They always figure out a way not
to give them tenure."
University administrators deny
this view. As one dean stated,
"Most departments bend over
backwards to accomodate troub
lemakers."
But Vice Provost for Faculty Af
fairs Arthur Bienenstock admits
that appeals of tenure denials
based on political unfairness to
the candidate are "not uncom
mon. I'd say that I see at least one
case a year in which political con
siderations are cited. Of course,
the appeal is always based on
other reasons as well."
Bienenstock states that he has
never found one of these claims to
be justified.
Impossible to know
Critics of the tenure system
agree political unfairness is virtu
ally impossible to document. Tex
tor says that he has heard such
charges "in two cases, but who
knows if they are true?" But one
charge which can be documented
by statements from several junior
faculty members is that untenured
professors are warned or pres
sured to remain uninvolved in con
troversial issues.
One junior faculty member
states that he was warned by his
department chairman to "keep my
nose out of questions of University
policy, or I might get it cut off." One
professor states that when she
first joined the faculty, she was
told to "keep out Of politics if I ever
wanted to get tenure."
But Bienenstock insists that the
major effect of involvement in
extra-scholarly issues is not alie
nation of senior faculty, but lack of
adequate attention to scholarly
work.
Superior record
"It takes a truly superior record
of scholarship to get tenure at
Stanford," Bienenstock points
out. "If a professor devotes sig
nificant amounts of time to things
other than his work, his record will
not be that good/'
He goes on to cite the involve
ment of many faculty in the politics
of the late '60s. "The radicalism of
the '60s involved a degree of anti
intellectualism.
"Many junior faculty turned
away from their scholarly activities
to get involved in things such as
the peace movement. Those who
became unproductive scholasti
cally did not get tenure."
One thing is certain: untenured
professors feel a real or imaginary
pressure to remain silent on, or
uninvolved in, potential con
troversy. One professor, currently
tenured, describes his experience
at Stanford in the '60s:
"I was (very deeply torn) by the

United States involvement in Vie
tnam. At the time of the escalation
in 1965, I was one of few people
at Stanford who (had spent sig
nificant time in Vietnam), and who
knew what an atrocity we were
committing.
"Yet I also knew the views of
some of the senior faculty in my
department. An anti-war stance
would have been extremely un
popular with them. I really felt that I
could not speak out until I got te
nure."
Bernstein believes such fears
are widespread among the junior
faculty. "I think that untenured fa
culty have a good sense of the
limits of acceptable action. Their
own concepts of what they can
and can not say are probably even
more restrictive than the limits of
the senior faculty," he says.
Bernstein sees the fears of the
junior faculty as limiting academic
freedom at Stanford: "Thesefears
definitely restrict the agenda of
items discussed.'' Textor agrees
with this view: "I think we are
doing real damage to the fiber and
strength of academic freedom —

the very thing the tenure system is
supposed to be preventing."
For those who do not get te
nure, the result can be devastat
ing. One senior faculty member
tells the story of a colleague who
today bears the bitterness and
pain of being denied a tenured
appointment more than 20 years
ago. Such stories are not uncom
mon.
Bienenstock points out that the
results are often much more real,
actually damaging a person's
career: "The denial of tenure at
one university definitely tarnishes
a professor's academic record.
Sometimes, its effects cannot be
overcome."
Trauma inherent
Many argue that this kind of
trauma is inherent in academia.
But even the defenders of
academic competition see serious
problems with the competition for
tenure at Stanford. According to
Textor, the appointments and
promotions system at Stanford
"demands serious over
achievement."
He claims to have seen profes

sors "turn into quasi-alcoholics"
under tenure pressure. He also
states that several families have
"disintegrated" because of the st
rains of tenure competition.
Michael Closson, assistant
dean of undergraduate studies,
agrees that the standards for
achieving tenure are useless as
guidelines for junior faculty efforts.
Closson cites the standards as
outlined in the Stanford Faculty
Handbook:
"(A candidate for promotion to
tenure must be) among the two or
three of the very best persons at a
similar level of professional de
velopment. . According to Clos
son, "It is impossible to prove
those criteria objectively. They are
insidious standards, which can be
used to grant or deny anybody te
nure for any reason."
Halsey Royden, dean of
humanities and sciences, disag
rees with Closson. While "there is
a certain amount of imprecision
inherent in the tenure standards,"
Royden maintains that Stanford
judges candidates for tenure "on
standards widely accepted

throughout the profession "
Bienenstock places limits on
the possibilities for objective te
nure decision-making. The
commitment of tenure is enorm
ous," Bienenstock points out.
What can be done to solve the
problem? Some advocate making
the standards for tenure more
specific. But Bernstein doubts that
this alone is an adequate solution
"The standards always justify the
administration's decisions."
Textor sees the ultimate solu
tion lying in a more open
decision-making system. He be
lieves that every junior faculty
member should have a guaran
teed right to confer with his de
partment chairman once a year, at
which time an evaluation of his
progress towards tenure would be
discussed.
If there are no changes in the
appointments and promotions
system, Textor sees
disastrous results for academic
freedom at Stanford. We will be
come bland and uninteresting,
unchallenged and, ultimately, un
challengeable."
