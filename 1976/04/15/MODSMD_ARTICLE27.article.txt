## Mummenschanz: profound creativity 
### Sue Simmons 
Theater-goers known to say
nothing surprises us happily
ate their words when Mum
menschanz performed for a full
house last Tuesday night at
Memorial Auditorium
Described as "mime-masque
theater." Mummenschanz more
closely resembles its literal mean
ing in German: "game-chance In
fact, chance elements figure as
predominantly in Mum
menschanz as fixity of purpose
and realism do in the classic,
white-face mime of Marcel Mar
ceau.
Traditional mimic realism,
therefore, is just what Mum
menschanz avoids. More than
mere novelty, though, has brought
this troupe of three players inter
national success.
Swiss-born Andres Bossard

and Benie Schuerch, Mum
menschanz founders, met at the
Jacques Lecoq Theatre Mime
School in Paris, where they first
explored the infinite world of
movement together. European
successes led them to the 1972
Avignon Festival, where Italian ac
tress Floriana Frasetto joined and
completed the troupe
Art-form
What the Mums have become
noted for in America and abroad is
almost an entirely new art form.
Their work is theatrically and
thematically unique. Even the an
cient Swiss "mask" tradition, to
which Bossard himself compares
Mummenschanz. served purely
ritualistic functions. Mum
menschanz. however, satisfies a
hunger for more basic, profound,
and frivolous human needs.
For the first part of their

Mem Aud program, Mum
menschanz presented a series of
tableaux illustrating the origin and
evolution of life. Abstract cos
tumes, masking not merely the
faces but even entire bodies of
Mummenschanz players, de
veloped unexpected contours.
The curtain rose on an undulat
ing hassock, later realized to rep
resent primeval matter. What ap
peared to be a maypole-creature
became a multicellular structure,
straining for life in a primal swamp.
Jungle
Then Rousseau's jungle came
alive. A fly buzzed inaudibly, a frog
developed camel humps, and a
cat licked itself contentedly off a
raised platform. Inquisitive beasts
were transformed into men
through living sculptures made of
animated canvas.
