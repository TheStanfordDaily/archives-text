# THEATER

### 
The Mums did not disappoint
their Stanford audience at inter
mission, either. Frasetto,
wearing tights and a black box on
her head, taped faces for herself
and crumpled them. Two spec
tators then received the privilege
of doing the same. Schuerch,
meanwhile, trailed his headdress
of crepe whiskers on and off stage
unnoticed.
Where the element of "Schanz"
(or chance) held sway in the first
half of the Mummenschanz per
formance, the "Mummen" (or
game aspect) of this new mime

form dominated the second half.
The zoological garden, where
men aped apes, gave way to the
society of men aping men.
Checkerboard
Masked couples cajoled and
sparred with weapons at hand:
blocks, balloons, clay and rolls of
toilet paper. In one scene, for
example, men wearing checker
board masks "played for points
until one figure "checkmated" his
fellow.
In another skit, male and female
features were drawn on scratch
pad faces. The more aggressive
male scratched his way to victory,
only to be frustrated by the angry
female who tore all his pages to
shreds.
Mummenschanz truly saved
the best of all the "game" for last,
however, when two men wearing
malleable clay masks ran at each
other in a climactic interface and
squashed their features into one
indistinguishable glob.
The New York Times was
right: Mummenschanz is unques
tionably "one of the most delight
ful events" Stanford has seen in a
long time.
