# Another dorm smash hit
## Soto shows 'How to Succeed...' 
### Linda Buddenberg 
Plays in dorms usually aren't
exactly Tony award material. You
go and see one maybe because
your best friend is in it. Or because
you're too broke to do anything
else.
Certain factors may discourage
you from seeking a dorm play at
all. Like the fact that the leads
have never been in a play before.
Or that the director has never di
rected before. Or that the entire
cast is drawn from one small
dorm.
The How to Succeed in Busi
ness Without Really Trying people
didn't have much raw material to
work with. However, they put to
gether a show at Soto that proves
that a whole can be more than the
sum of its parts.
Oh, sure, there were some
rough spots and some obvious
weaknesses. The point is that di
rector Greg Grefenstette and his
crew did a lot more good things
than bad things. They made sure
that anyone who sees the show is
going to have a great time.
Warped
How to Succeed portrays the
warped values of corporate life,
with executives playing ad
vancement games and sec
retaries playing . . . well, other
games .. . with their bosses.
The musical follows J. Pierpont
"Ponty" Finch, who, with his little
book called How to Succeed in
Business Without Really Try
ing. skyrockets through the World
Wide Wicket Corporation hierar
chy.
The show's biggest asset is a
freshman named Adlai Alexander,
who plays J. Pierpont. He's alter
nately impish, unscrupulous, lov
able and conceited — and obvi
ously loving every moment he's
on stage. Alexander plays the role
with a great deal of hamming, but
anyone who's seen Robert Morse
(who created the role) in the show
knows that hamming is definetly
the rule of the role here.

Alexander's singing provides
the highlights of the evening. His
love song to himself, "I Believe in
You," is absolutely professional,
and teamups with the chorus in
"The Brotherhood of Man" and
George Dallas in the "Groundhog
Fight Song" result in show stop
pers.
Character
Mary Danford plays Rosemary
Pilkington, J. Pierpont's secretary
and romantic interest. She trans
forms a stock character into an
interesting person with sensitive
acting and revealing facial ex
pressions.
Unfortunately, she loses confi
dence and her voice falters when
she solos, as in the beginning of
"Paris Original." This could have
resulted partly from the orchest
ra's difficulty in staying with the
singers. However, Danford's
duets with Alexander provide
some of the show's high points.
Grefenstette draws uniformly
good performances from the sup
porting cast. George Dallas as
J. 8.. J. Pierpont's boss, builds a
well-rounded character, combin
ing executive and lecherous qual

ities. His deep authoritative voice
is especially impressive.
It would have been extremely
easy for Joan Trusty to exagger
ate her part of Hedy Laßue. the
boss' sexy girlfriend, beyond the
limits of musical comedy, but she
does an excellent balancing act
between being too cutesy and
being too sultry.
Other good characterizations
were turned in by Glenn Burgess
as Bud Frump, who livens up the
"Brotherhood" number with a
short but spirited dance solo, and
by Corkey Davis who, as Mr Bratt,
was the only one of J.B's "boys"

who didn't drop character.
Also, Allison Carpenter uses a
strong character voice in Been a
Long Day,"and makes the most of
every line she has ( Maybe I'll
start a rumor that I'm a nym
phomaniac!") in playing Rose
mary's friend. Smitty.
Now, hold a minute before you
go sign these guys up for Broad
way's next season There were
some rough spots. The most glar
ing examples of amateurism oc
curred during the chorus scenes.
The girls' chorus seems very
uninspired compared to Rose
mary and Smitty. They harmonize
well in "Cinderella," but otherwise
they don't seem to be having too
much fun or thinking about their
characters too much.
Similarly, the men's chorus
seems to spend a lot of time
watching each other, rather than
reacting in character. The leads
not only command all the attention
in every scene, but they make the
rest of the cast look like sticks
Director
Sara Hopkins, the choreog
rapher. could have done a lot
more in the group scenes, too,
especially in A Secretary is Not a
Toy." Possibly, she underesti
mated the talent of the cast, and
the result is oversimplified walking
around which never really gives a

feeling of dancing.
Technically, the show reflects
the hard work put into it. The set is
simple but functional, and the cos
tumes are appropriate The Paris
Original dress and J B s golf
pants especially add to the flavor
of the play. Kudos also go to the
technical and lighting crew for
flawless behind-the-scenes work
The Soto people try hard, and it
really shows. One member of the
dorm has spent the week in a
sleeping bag because his sheets
are part of the set. How to Suc
ceed proves that, with devotion
like that, you can't go too far
wrong.


AHOY MATIES—Joan Trusty as Hedy Laßue prepares to set sail on
the World Wide Wicket Treasure Hunt in Soto's production of How
to Succeed. . .
