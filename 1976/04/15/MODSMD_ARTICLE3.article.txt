## Letter: Hoover bias 
### 
Hoover Institution
I must congratulate Viae Ker
shner for revealing the Hoover In
stitution s disgusting conservative
bias. Who would have guessed?
But though Kershner meticul
ously documents the sordid truth,
he leaves several questions un
answered.
First, although he repeatedly re
fers to the institution's growing
influence," he tells us neither how
it is getting that influence nor what
or whom it is influencing. I sup
pose he is suggesting that
Hoover's card-carrying conser
vatives are actually influencing
our very own government. But
how? Since conservatives are
wrong, their influence cannot be

due to the quality of their research.
Clearly, then, there must be a
right-wing conspiracy. I think
there's a Pulitzer in there for Ker
shner if he uncovers that one.
Second, Kershner correctly
points out the risk in allowing
Hoover to remain conservative:
"As more and more of the world
drifts toward variants of Marxism,
the biased perspective of Hoover,
when coupled with the institution s
growing influence, presents a
danger to world harmony (em
phasis added)."
Although one might quarrel with
his characterization of Communist
takeovers as "drifts toward var
iants of Marxism,'' his basic point
is irrefutable. And Hitler couldn't
have said it any better.
But although Kershner recom
mends that Hoover be
"straightened' politically, he neg
lects to describe how this can be
done. In a time of budgetary re
straint, Stanford can't go out and
buy a dozen certified Grade "A"
liberals.
Clearly, the only alternative
short of nuking the Tower or
brainwashing its inhabitants is to
fire the conservatives and replace
them with scholars possessing
more orthodox and less danger
ous opinions. Then, not only will
the world be harmonious, but we'll
have our own liberal think tank,
one we can look up to and be
proud of, one just like everybody
else's.
