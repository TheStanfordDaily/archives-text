Hijacking drama ends

An airline official said they won a promise

the Philippine Airlines jetliner and all
aboard, but Libya's Arab Revolutionary
News Agency said the government of
Moammar Khadafy denied granting them
asylum and added that they were under
interrogation.
The DCB with the freed hostages, all
employes of the airline, flew to Rome and a
night of rest before continuing home to the
Philippines.
