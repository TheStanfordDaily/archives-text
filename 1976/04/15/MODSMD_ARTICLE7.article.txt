# Prop. 15: too drastic?
## 
### 
Rick Greer

Some opponents of Proposition 15, the Nuc
lear Safeguards Initiative, will often refer to it as the
Nuclear Shutdown Initiative. If by this they mean to
imply that Proposition 15 requires the unconditional
shutdown of currently operating nuclear fission
power plants in California, then they have misread
the proposition. The proposition is far more moder
ate than they would have you believe.
What is true is that Proposition 15 provides for a
conditional phased shutdown of operational nuclear
power plants over an 11-year period and a
moratorium on new construction if the following
conditions are not satisfied:
1) The nuclear power industry's liability limits for
loss of property and life subsequent to any nuclear
accident must be removed and full compensation
assured within one year of the proposition's pas
sage.
2) Within five years of the proposition's passage,
the advocates of nuclear power must convince the
California Legislature that a) existing plant safety
systems will work as designed and that b) the
radioactive wastes from any given plant can be
stored or disposed of with no reasonable chance of
the escape of such waste or radioactivity into the
natural environment, whether by accident,
earthquakes, theft or sabotage.
Industry's claims
Surely, this is not too much to ask of the nuclear
power industry. In fact, if the plants are as safe as
the industry claims, then, in order for the industry to
be so sure, comprehensive safety systems must
have been designed, documented and fully tested in
actual operation.
Consequently, it should be an easy matter for
them to bring in their reports and experts and con
vince the legislature. If not, well then perhaps nuc
lear power isn't as safe yet as it should be.
Why are pro-initiative people so worried? First,
the type of radioactive waste being produced is
highly toxic and lonq-lived. For example, an inhaled
speck of plutonium will cause lung cancer, then
death, and will be fully capable of doing just that for
at least 500,000 years. We can't afford to have
material like this out in the environment.
Safety record
Second, in spite of what the opposition may say,
those responsible for operating nuclear power sys
tems do not have a perfect safety record, even
though by their own theory they should. One hears
about the Rasmussen Report which claims that "it is
more probable to be killed by a meteorite than by a
nuclear reactor accident."
Now, if lethal nuclear accidents in general are this
rare, then one could reasonably expect that close

calls or almost catastrophes, while more probable,
will still be pretty unlikely. Hence, since nuclear
power has only been around for about 20 years, we
shouldn't expect to hear of any close calls happen
ing at all. Unfortunately, this is not the case.
Although no one has yet died as a result, over
430,000 gallons of radioactive waste has seeped
into the earth over past years at Hanford,
Washington. This waste was being stored in steel
tanks with a projected life span of 30 years.
Browns Ferry
On March 22, 1975, there was a very serious fire
under the control room of the two nuclear reactors at
the Browns Ferry Plant in Alabama, which resulted
in the almost total failure of the cooling system of
one of the reactors.
If this cooling system had completely failed, then
the reactor fuel would have melted down into a white
hot mass, which would have then melted down
through the containment vessel and out into the
environment.
In summary then, since nuclear fission provides
only a small and not absolutely needed percentage
of the state's energy requirements at the present
time and since it is important for nuclear power
generation to be safe, now is the time for us to
carefully determine in a public forum whether or not
nuclear fission power plants are or can be operated
in a safe fashion.
This, plus requiring full compensation for losses in
case of a nuclear accident, is all that Proposition 15
is trying to accomplish, independent of what the
opposition may tell you.

moratorium on new construction if the following
conditions are not satisfied:
1) The nuclear power industry's liability limits for
loss of property and life subsequent to any nuclear
accident must be removed and full compensation
assured within one year of the proposition's pas
sage.
2) Within five years of the proposition's passage,
the advocates of nuclear power must convince the
California Legislature that a) existing plant safety
systems will work as designed and that b) the
radioactive wastes from any given plant can be
stored or disposed of with no reasonable chance of
the escape of such waste or radioactivity into the
natural environment, whether by accident,
earthquakes, theft or sabotage.
Industry's claims
Surely, this is not too much to ask of the nuclear
power industry. In fact, if the plants are as safe as
the industry claims, then, in order for the industry to
be so sure, comprehensive safety systems must
have been designed, documented and fully tested in
actual operation.
Consequently, it should be an easy matter for
them to bring in their reports and experts and con
vince the legislature. If not, well then perhaps nuc
lear power isn't as safe yet as it should be.
Why are pro-initiative people so worried? First,
the type of radioactive waste being produced is
highly toxic and lonq-lived. For example, an inhaled
speck of plutonium will cause lung cancer, then
death, and will be fully capable of doing just that for
at least 500,000 years. We can't afford to have
material like this out in the environment.
Safety record
Second, in spite of what the opposition may say,
those responsible for operating nuclear power sys
tems do not have a perfect safety record, even
though by their own theory they should. One hears
about the Rasmussen Report which claims that "it is
more probable to be killed by a meteorite than by a
nuclear reactor accident."
Now, if lethal nuclear accidents in general are this
rare, then one could reasonably expect that close

calls or almost catastrophes, while more probable,
will still be pretty unlikely. Hence, since nuclear
power has only been around for about 20 years, we
shouldn't expect to hear of any close calls happen
ing at all. Unfortunately, this is not the case.
Although no one has yet died as a result, over
430,000 gallons of radioactive waste has seeped
into the earth over past years at Hanford,
Washington. This waste was being stored in steel
tanks with a projected life span of 30 years.
Browns Ferry
On March 22, 1975, there was a very serious fire
under the control room of the two nuclear reactors at
the Browns Ferry Plant in Alabama, which resulted
in the almost total failure of the cooling system of
one of the reactors.
If this cooling system had completely failed, then
the reactor fuel would have melted down into a white
hot mass, which would have then melted down
through the containment vessel and out into the
environment.
In summary then, since nuclear fission provides
only a small and not absolutely needed percentage
of the state's energy requirements at the present
time and since it is important for nuclear power
generation to be safe, now is the time for us to
carefully determine in a public forum whether or not
nuclear fission power plants are or can be operated
in a safe fashion.
This, plus requiring full compensation for losses in
case of a nuclear accident, is all that Proposition 15
is trying to accomplish, independent of what the
opposition may tell you.

Some opponents of Proposition 15, the Nuc
lear Safeguards Initiative, will often refer to it as the
Nuclear Shutdown Initiative. If by this they mean to
imply that Proposition 15 requires the unconditional
shutdown of currently operating nuclear fission
power plants in California, then they have misread
the proposition. The proposition is far more moder
ate than they would have you believe.
What is true is that Proposition 15 provides for a
conditional phased shutdown of operational nuclear
power plants over an 11-year period and a
moratorium on new construction if the following
conditions are not satisfied:
1) The nuclear power industry's liability limits for
loss of property and life subsequent to any nuclear
accident must be removed and full compensation
assured within one year of the proposition's pas
sage.
