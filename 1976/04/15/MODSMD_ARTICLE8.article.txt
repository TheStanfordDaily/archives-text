# Amnesty International:
## Panel advocates freedom for Indonesian prisoners 
### Debra Smith 
The U.S. Chapter of Amnesty
International has declared 1976 a
year of concerted effort to free
political prisoners in Indonesia,
according to David Hinkley of Am
nesty International.
Hinkley was a member of a
panel discussion on "Politics and
Political Prisoners in Indonesia,"
held Tuesday night in Tresidder
Union.
Speaking to approximately 20
persons, Hinkley noted that avail
able statistics indicate that one
million people were killed in In
donesia by students, military and
ordinary villagers when the
Sukarno government was over
thrown in 1965. Hundreds of
thousands more were impris
oned, he said.
Prisoner categories
Three categories of prisoners
resulted from this coup, said

Hinkley.
1) The "A" group consists of
several thousand persons ar
rested because of direct involve
ment in the Sept. 30,1965, coup.
(This coup began when five gen
erals were kidnapped and assas
sinated by the Communist faction
in Indonesia.)
2) The "B" group consists of at
least 35,000 persons, mainly intel
lectuals, suspected of indirect in
volvement. This number is known
due to a government promise to
release 35,000 prisoners ob
tained through Amnesty Interna
tional's efforts, Hinkley said.
3) "C" group consists mainly of
several hundred thousand poor
people.
Approximately 10,000 persons
of the "B" group have been relo
cated to the island of Buru,
Hinkley said. The government has
no intention of trying the vast

majority of those incarcerated be
cause the government doesn't
have the necessary legal machin
ery, he commented.
Hinkley said the common crimi
nals have better facilities than the
political prisoners, according to
Carmel Budiardjo. a political pris
oner in Indonesia who was re
leased. Many of the political pris
oners have never received benefit
of counsel, nor been told why they
were initially arrested, he noted.
A typical diet for the political
prisoners, he said, would be a
small bowl of rice, a local vegeta
ble and a liquid. Many prisoners
supplement their diet by catching
rats, according to Hinkley's
sources.
Directly after arrest, many pris
oners were tortured by such
methods as being thrown into pits
of broken glass and being given
shocks, Hinkley reported.
According to Budiardjo, the
worst condition for Indonesia's
political prisoners is the total loss
of self and the total loss of hope,
Hinkley said.
Prisoner population
Indonesia has "overwhelmingly
the largest prisoner population in
the world." Hinkley said.
Amnesty International, he
commented, is a world wide
human rights movement inde
pendent of any government, polit
ical faction, ideology or religious
creed.
He explained that the Amnesty
International adoption method is
to collect information on an indi
vidual political prisoner and send
this information to a group which
in turn works for the individual's
release.
This method has not Worked in
Indonesia, so Amnesty Interna
tional has turned to a more gen
eral campaign consisting of ex
tensive publicity of the "total out
rage against human rights'' that
exists in Indonesia,'' he said.

Hinkley said. The government has
no intention of trying the vast

majority of those incarcerated be
cause the government doesn't
have the necessary legal machin
ery, he commented.
Hinkley said the common crimi
nals have better facilities than the
political prisoners, according to
Carmel Budiardjo. a political pris
oner in Indonesia who was re
leased. Many of the political pris
oners have never received benefit
of counsel, nor been told why they
were initially arrested, he noted.
A typical diet for the political
prisoners, he said, would be a
small bowl of rice, a local vegeta
ble and a liquid. Many prisoners
supplement their diet by catching
rats, according to Hinkley's
sources.
Directly after arrest, many pris
oners were tortured by such
methods as being thrown into pits
of broken glass and being given
shocks, Hinkley reported.
According to Budiardjo, the
worst condition for Indonesia's
political prisoners is the total loss
of self and the total loss of hope,
Hinkley said.
Prisoner population
Indonesia has "overwhelmingly
the largest prisoner population in
the world." Hinkley said.
Amnesty International, he
commented, is a world wide
human rights movement inde
pendent of any government, polit
ical faction, ideology or religious
creed.
He explained that the Amnesty
International adoption method is
to collect information on an indi
vidual political prisoner and send
this information to a group which
in turn works for the individual's
release.
This method has not Worked in
Indonesia, so Amnesty Interna
tional has turned to a more gen
eral campaign consisting of ex
tensive publicity of the "total out
rage against human rights'' that
exists in Indonesia,'' he said.
The U.S. Chapter of Amnesty
International has declared 1976 a
year of concerted effort to free
political prisoners in Indonesia,
according to David Hinkley of Am
nesty International.
Hinkley was a member of a
panel discussion on "Politics and
Political Prisoners in Indonesia,"
held Tuesday night in Tresidder
Union.
Speaking to approximately 20
persons, Hinkley noted that avail
able statistics indicate that one
million people were killed in In
donesia by students, military and
ordinary villagers when the
Sukarno government was over
thrown in 1965. Hundreds of
thousands more were impris
oned, he said.
Prisoner categories
Three categories of prisoners
resulted from this coup, said

Hinkley.
1) The "A" group consists of
several thousand persons ar
rested because of direct involve
ment in the Sept. 30,1965, coup.
(This coup began when five gen
erals were kidnapped and assas
sinated by the Communist faction
in Indonesia.)
2) The "B" group consists of at
least 35,000 persons, mainly intel
lectuals, suspected of indirect in
volvement. This number is known
due to a government promise to
release 35,000 prisoners ob
tained through Amnesty Interna
tional's efforts, Hinkley said.
3) "C" group consists mainly of
several hundred thousand poor
people.
Approximately 10,000 persons
of the "B" group have been relo
cated to the island of Buru,
Hinkley said. The government has
no intention of trying the vast

majority of those incarcerated be
cause the government doesn't
have the necessary legal machin
ery, he commented.
