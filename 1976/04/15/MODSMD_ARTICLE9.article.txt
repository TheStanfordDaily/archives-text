# Historian urges press 'vigilance'

### Dave Ansley 
"Vigilance and suspicion" are
the tools the press must use to
better serve the public. Assoc.
History Prof. Barton Bernstein told
a Bishop Auditorium audience
Tuesday night.
If the press maintained a more
critical outlook and relied less on
government handouts, the Ameri
can people might have a very dif
ferent view of foreign affairs, he
said
This vigilance includes publish
ing classified documents such as
the Pentagon Papers and the Pike
Committee report, maintained
Bernstein, who argued that unless
it would cause "serious national
peril," such "leaked" information

should be released.
Bernstein's speech was pre
sented by the Stanford Alumni
Association.
Bernstein stressed five exam
ples of vital information missing
from foreign affairs news cover
age during the past three de
cades.
"How differently we might have
responded" if we had been told for
instance, that President John
Kennedy's advisors felt that the
Cuban missiles made no military
difference, he commented.
"Since there were people in pri
vate life looking at the situa
tion .. . and making these argu
ments, . . . why couldn't those
who covered the Penta
gon .. . have raised the same
kinds of questions?" Bernstein
asked.
If we had realized in 1961 "that
advisors'. . . was a skillful
euphemism for soldiers,' " our
views about Vietnam might have
been different.
News coverage of the Baruch
Plan, the Marshall Plan and the
Berlin Wall was similarly deficient,
he asserted. Bernstein theorized
that we might not have felt as
much animosity toward the SovieJ
Union and East Germany if we

had been told the full stories be
hind these events.
One cause of this incomplete
coverage, he said, lies in a "sym
biotic relation" between the press
and those it covers. Reporters
are. "like moths to a lightbulb,"
drawn to the lustre of power" and
they hesitate to antagonize their
close friends in government, said
Bernstein.
But it would be more proper, he
concluded, if a critical judgment
was always maintained, and the
press performed its highest obli
gation: to inform and not conceal
things from us.
