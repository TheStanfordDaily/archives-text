IN THE NATION THIS WEEK FRANK CHURCH'S CANDIDACY
George Lardenery of the Washington Post writes:
Senator Frank Church likes to quote the cartoon character Sen
ator Snort who entered the presidential race very late. Senator
Snort happily observed that by entering the race late, he had
saved taxpayers a fortune in Secret Service salaries.
"Senator Church thinks he has more to offer than Senator Snort,
but there are those, even among his friends, who wonder whether
any beyond embarrassingly small number will bother to find out.
"But Senator Church does not have to sit still. He can run for
the presidency, fall flat on his face, and come 1979, still be made
Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee."
