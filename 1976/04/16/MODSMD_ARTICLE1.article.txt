# Federal mediation in SF strike
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AF) — City offi
cials and labor leaders met with a fed
eral mediator yesterday in an effort to
end the municipal workers' strike.
Yellow Cab Co. taxis began rolling
after negotiators reached an agreement
in a separate dispute.
A federal mediator met separately
with the San Francisco Board of
Supervisors and union chiefs, trying to
hammer out ground rules for mediated
negotiations in the 16-day-long walk
out.
In a different dispute. Yellow Cab
and Teamsters Union officials agreed
to put the company's 500 taxis back on
traffic-swollen city streets while
mediated negotiations continue.
Yellow Cab shut down April 5 after
its revenues were attached by court
order in a dispute over fringe benefits.
The Board of Supervisors has in
sisted that all 1600 striking city crafts
workers return to their jobs and .~-
move pickets that have stalled mass
transit before mediated bargaining can
begin.
But the unions said they were only
considering the possibility of allowing
city buses to roll again.
"We're at the same point we were
two days ago," federal mediator James
Scearce said after a meeting with labor
chiefs. "We're grying to find out
whether we've got a basis for media
tion. This is not a simple dispute, and
there are a lot of factors to be dealt
with."
The strike was triggered by the
supervisors' proposal for $5.7 million
in pay cuts for crafts workers — plum
bers, machinists, carpenters, electri
cians and others.
The move toward mediation was an
encouraging sign in the bitter walkout
by the crafts workers and their suppor
ters. Un'il Wednesday, the supervisors
vigorously opposed the unions' call
for mediation.
Ceorge Evankovich, head of the
Laborers Union and a strike negotiator,
said the unions would not withdraw
pickets unless the supervisors agreed
to "stringent rules to show they will
negotiate in good faith through media
tion to a conclusion." He said he ex
pected the strike might be settled with
three days of intensive negotiations.
The city employes' strike has left
public buildings without heat or hot
water. Broken water mains and stop
lights have remained unrepaired, but
most essential services, including
hospitals, waterand sewage.have con
tinued to operate.
Frivate garbage collection com
panies have continued to operate, bui
some garbage is accumulating in the
streets. A private group plans a
citywide cleanup for tomorrow.
