# Economy out-of-sync with education
## 
### 
Time magazine's attraction and useful
ness as restroom reading are unequaled. For
some obscure reason the one urge is always
accompanied by the other.
A recent, relaxing article discussed the
"Slim Pickings for the Class of '76" (Time
March 29, 1976). The story abounds with
jeremiads telling of the UCLA history B.A.
spraying trees, or the Phi Beta Kappa
psychology M.A. subsisting on food stamps
and unemployment checks.
Woe be it to the humanities 8.A., or M.A.,
or even (horribile dictu) the Ph.D. Un
employment, or worse, underemployment
loom ahead. Grim, grim, grunt.
You see, "the U.S. educational system
and the needs of the U.S. economy are badly
out of sync."
Needed, according to Time are petroleum
engineers, accountants, computer scien
tists and pharmaceutical staff. The rape of
Alaska nearing climax we need people to
count the petro-dollars, process the totals,
and supply the Valiums.
For the lost, liberal souls, advice is prof
fered. "Undergraduates are being urged to
make career choices early, to keep an eye on
the marketplace, and, if they must major in
the humanities, to minor in a business field,
or, at least to take shorthand." Flush.
'Real world'
One enterprising Michigan school has
started an executive-in-residence program
where GM execs "live on campus for a week
with liberal arts majors and impart to them a
feeling for the 'real world.' " Zip.
A necessary condition for the existence of

the "real world" being a clean (and locked)
executive washroom, serviced by a happy
worker. A female art major does not a good
charwoman make.
Oh Veblen! Poor Veblen! they've hung
you in the janitor's closet. . . The captains
of industry turned captains of erudition

have now turned the captains of non
erudition.
While reading the bleak forecasts of an
overeducated America, note the direction of
the causal connection. Education serves to
satisfy the needs generated by business.
Need translates as an unfilled job. Shadowy
factory images invade.
A mismatch means the educational sys
tem is askew. Yet, perhaps it is the economy
which is askew. Perhaps business should
serve to satisfy the needs generated by edu
cation. Certainly, the present notion of the
match-up is overemphasized.
Such variants Time would dismiss as
"high-minded theories of education not (of)
much use to young people worrying about
bread and butter." The dismissal betrays a
deep-seated antipathy towards change and

its sources.
A basic goal of a liberal arts education is
the development of a capacity for critical
evaluation; an evaluation not held rigidly
within the confines of profit and loss.
Yet, as an assistant placement director
tells Time, "Most employers are forced to
get personnel who can turn a profit for thev.
right away." Business has no use for value
challenges or alternatives. Someone might
begin to wonder why or how it is that he is
worrying about bread not to mention butter.
Granted, the bread does qualify as an un
alterable necessity, but the particular
methods of its acquisition or distribution
are not so sacrosanct.
Needed are people who can tell the differ
ence between "works befitting the free
man"(artes liberales)and those befitting the
slave. It is within the humanities that the
difference is most intensely explored.
For Time and many placement officials
such a difference hardly exists. It is a mattP r
of availability only. Receptivity and equity
are left unspoken of. Slim pickings indeed.
With almost unbearable irony (of the type
French Prof. Robert Cohn would thoroughly
enjoy), the article immediately following
"Slim Pickings" was an appreciative review
of the current Fauvist exhibit at New York's
Museum of Modern Art.
Unemployed wild beasts subsisting on
food stamps. Didn't they read Time, or were
they merely ahead of it?
