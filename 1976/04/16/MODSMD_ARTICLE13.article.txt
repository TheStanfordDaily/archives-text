# Israeli nuclear weapons

David Sartoris

The recently confirmed specu
lation that Israel possesses nuc
lear capability should be taken
as a critical item of news by the
world community.
Although the threat of nuclear
holocaust has been with man
kind since the back-to-back mer
ciless acts of 1945 at Hiroshima
and Nagasaki, the possession of
nuclear weapons has been li
mited to nations whose leaders
recognize the adverse conse
quences of their use. Nor have
these countries, which include
the United States, Soviet Union,
France, Britain, India and China,
been involved in situations war
ranting their use since their
achievement of nuclear poten
tial.
Israel's acquisition of nuclear
capability, which the CIA esti
mates at between 10 and 20
weapons, threatens to critically
upset the delicate balance which
has prevailed for the past 30
years.
No hesitation
Not only is the nation in
periodic turmoil with several
Arab states in the Middle East,
but Israel has demonstrated that
it would not hesitate to imple
ment nuclear force if sufficiently
provoked.
At the start of the 1973 October
War, Premier Golda Meir gave
Defense Minister Moshe Dayan
permission to activate Israel's
atomic weapons. The move
came in direct response to a seri
ous rout of Israeli forces along
the Suez Canal by the Egyptians,
and a simultaneous retreat of Is
raeli troops from a massive Sy
rian tank attack on the Golan
Heights. The situation prompted
Dayan to warn the premier,
"This is the end of the third tem
ple (Israel)," which resulted in
the arming of the nuclear
weapons.
Fortunately for her adver
saries and the world, Israel
turned the tide of battle on both
fronts, and the bombs were sent
to their present desert arsenal
sites. Nevertheless, it has been
reported that these activities
were a major factor in the U.S.
global militarv alert of October
25. 1973.
At about the same time, the
Soviet Union dispatched nuc
lear warheads from Nikolaev to

Alexandria, with the intent to
arm Russian Scud missiles al
ready based in Egypt. Clearly,
the sword of Armageddon was
poised for global tragedy.
That the news of this highly
critical situation only recently
became known suggests!hat the
brink of nuclear war has proba
bly been approached at other
times during recent years. Simi
larly, tense international con
flicts are highly likely to arise in
the future, both within the Mid
dle East and elsewhere.
Israel's nuclear potential sets
the trend for other lesser world
powers to develop, or even
purchase, atomic weapons. As
the number of players in the nuc
lear game increases, the chances

that senseless destruction will
be unleashed is dangerously en
hanced.
Emphasize control
In view of these considera
tions, it is imperative that lead
ers of all nations place increased
emphasis on nuclear arms con
trol and disarmament in the fu
ture.
Past attempts at such recon
ciliation have failed primarily
due to mistrust and a fear of in
adequate military potential. Fai
lure to overcome these barriers
will undoubtedly result in the
ultimate use of nuclear weapons,
which we have just reason to
fear.
Moshe Dayan believes that a
nuclear capability is essential to

Israel. "We have no choice," he
recently commented, "With our
manpower we cannot physi
cally, financially or economi
cally go on acquiring more and
more tanks and planes."
Clearly, a pronounced shift iw
national priorities is in order \i
Israel and the world as a whole.
Wisely used, nuclear power
can be a powerful tool for the
future prosperity of mankind. A
continuation of current trends,
however, can only be compared
to a Neanderthal discovering fi> .
and then burning himself to
death.

ranting their use since their

tial.
Israel's acquisition of nuclear
capability, which the CIA esti
mates at between 10 and 20
weapons, threatens to critically
upset the delicate balance which
has prevailed for the past 30
years.
No hesitation
Not only is the nation in
periodic turmoil with several
Arab states in the Middle East,
but Israel has demonstrated that
it would not hesitate to imple
ment nuclear force if sufficiently
provoked.
At the start of the 1973 October
War, Premier Golda Meir gave
Defense Minister Moshe Dayan
permission to activate Israel's
atomic weapons. The move
came in direct response to a seri
ous rout of Israeli forces along
the Suez Canal by the Egyptians,
and a simultaneous retreat of Is
raeli troops from a massive Sy
rian tank attack on the Golan
Heights. The situation prompted
Dayan to warn the premier,
"This is the end of the third tem
ple (Israel)," which resulted in
the arming of the nuclear
weapons.
Fortunately for her adver
saries and the world, Israel
turned the tide of battle on both
fronts, and the bombs were sent
to their present desert arsenal
sites. Nevertheless, it has been
reported that these activities
were a major factor in the U.S.
global militarv alert of October
25. 1973.
At about the same time, the
Soviet Union dispatched nuc
lear warheads from Nikolaev to

Alexandria, with the intent to
arm Russian Scud missiles al
ready based in Egypt. Clearly,
the sword of Armageddon was
poised for global tragedy.
That the news of this highly
critical situation only recently
became known suggests!hat the
brink of nuclear war has proba
bly been approached at other
times during recent years. Simi
larly, tense international con
flicts are highly likely to arise in
the future, both within the Mid
dle East and elsewhere.
Israel's nuclear potential sets
the trend for other lesser world
powers to develop, or even
purchase, atomic weapons. As
the number of players in the nuc
lear game increases, the chances

that senseless destruction will
be unleashed is dangerously en
hanced.
Emphasize control
In view of these considera
tions, it is imperative that lead
ers of all nations place increased
emphasis on nuclear arms con
trol and disarmament in the fu
ture.
Past attempts at such recon
ciliation have failed primarily
due to mistrust and a fear of in
adequate military potential. Fai
lure to overcome these barriers
will undoubtedly result in the
ultimate use of nuclear weapons,
which we have just reason to
fear.
Moshe Dayan believes that a
nuclear capability is essential to

Israel. "We have no choice," he
recently commented, "With our
manpower we cannot physi
cally, financially or economi
cally go on acquiring more and
more tanks and planes."
Clearly, a pronounced shift iw
national priorities is in order \i
Israel and the world as a whole.
Wisely used, nuclear power
can be a powerful tool for the
future prosperity of mankind. A
continuation of current trends,
however, can only be compared
to a Neanderthal discovering fi> .
and then burning himself to
death.

The recently confirmed specu

Although the threat of nuclear
