'Howard Report'
I would like to correct two
misrepresentations appearing in
the Daily April 13. In their col
umn, Dan Howard, Keith Ar
chuleta. Liz Rvll and Bill Tyn
dall state that the so-called
"Howard Report" on the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Ad
missions and Financial Aid
(CUAFA) has "prompted two
substantial results."
One. they state, is that transfer
students are now offered aid
packages commensurate with
those of other students. The
other is that a sub-committee has
been established to study "the
question of special admissions,
using non-traditional criteria for
some students."
Both assertions are false. All
financial aid packaging for
transfer students follows
policies, new this year, wholly
unaffected by the "Howard Re
port." And the sub-committee of
CUAFA recently formed will not
study special admissions, nor
will it be concerned with non
traditional criteria for admis
sion. It will be concerned with
establishing a rough socio
economic "profile" of entering
Stanford students.

Think sun
We have a particularly prodi
gal sun at Stanford, and at the
same time people here are talk
ing about the "Energy Crisis."
Why don't we ask the sun to foot
the bill for us? I am sure he
would enjoy helping us in this
way.
More than 10 vears ago,
M.I.T. in Cambridge, which is
half as sunny as our California
and much colder, built the first
American solar house! Why
doesn't Stanford with its optimal
weather conditions and its main
competitor in other fields, not al
ready have one?
Things have to change, and I
hope they will. If Stanford's ad
ministrators are worrying about
running too high risks with
young solar technology, why
shouldn't Stanford's students
push them a little bit?
"Think sun,"and we will soon
see that he will help us to face
the energy shortage, and con
sequently to slow the inflation of
our Stanford tuition: buy the sun
rather than a race horse to pav for
it (But keep your horse until
Solar Energy enters Stanford's
race)!
Don't forget, oil is solar energy
which had been stored for mill
ions of years in the earth. Let us
then be grateful to the sun, think

a little bit of him. Oil was the
traditional way. Today technol
ogy enables us to use the sui,
more directly and thus more ef
ficiently.
"Think sun" for Stanford and
let me know your cogitations, we
can discuss them. I have some
ideas on solar energy and I am
currently designing a solar
house for Escondido Village as /
project for Engineering 235,
Prof. James Johnston's project.

'Howard Report'
I would like to correct two
misrepresentations appearing in
the Daily April 13. In their col
umn, Dan Howard, Keith Ar
chuleta. Liz Rvll and Bill Tyn
dall state that the so-called
"Howard Report" on the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Ad
missions and Financial Aid
(CUAFA) has "prompted two
substantial results."
One. they state, is that transfer
students are now offered aid
packages commensurate with
those of other students. The
other is that a sub-committee has
been established to study "the
question of special admissions,
using non-traditional criteria for
some students."
Both assertions are false. All
financial aid packaging for
transfer students follows
policies, new this year, wholly
unaffected by the "Howard Re
port." And the sub-committee of
CUAFA recently formed will not
study special admissions, nor
will it be concerned with non
traditional criteria for admis
sion. It will be concerned with
establishing a rough socio
economic "profile" of entering
Stanford students.

Think sun
We have a particularly prodi
gal sun at Stanford, and at the
same time people here are talk
ing about the "Energy Crisis."
Why don't we ask the sun to foot
the bill for us? I am sure he
would enjoy helping us in this
way.
More than 10 vears ago,
M.I.T. in Cambridge, which is
half as sunny as our California
and much colder, built the first
American solar house! Why
doesn't Stanford with its optimal
weather conditions and its main
competitor in other fields, not al
ready have one?
Things have to change, and I
hope they will. If Stanford's ad
ministrators are worrying about
running too high risks with
young solar technology, why
shouldn't Stanford's students
push them a little bit?
"Think sun,"and we will soon
see that he will help us to face
the energy shortage, and con
sequently to slow the inflation of
our Stanford tuition: buy the sun
rather than a race horse to pav for
it (But keep your horse until
Solar Energy enters Stanford's
race)!
Don't forget, oil is solar energy
which had been stored for mill
ions of years in the earth. Let us
then be grateful to the sun, think

a little bit of him. Oil was the
traditional way. Today technol
ogy enables us to use the sui,
