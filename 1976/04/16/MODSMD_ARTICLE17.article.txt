MADISON, Wise. (PNS) —
With Jimmy Carter mowing
down liberals even in liberal
states like Wisconsin and dark
horse candidate Jerry Brown
leaping to fourth place in the
polls without yet campaigning,
there is more than noiseand clat
ter behind the Democratic
primaries.
The rise of Carter and Brown
signals a profound ideological
shift within the Democratic
party, unlike any since Franklin
Roosevelt launched his New
Deal.
Both Carter and Brown repre
sent a new "pragmatic" wing of
the Democratic Party, rejecting
the traditional big spending ap
proach to social problems.
Economic crisis
As with the New Deal, this
shift comes in response to
economic crisis and finds its
voice among the nation's gover
nors, not Washington. It was
born out of a recession that has
gripped the economy for two
years — a decline that slashed
state revenues, brought the na
tion's largest city to the brink of
collapse, created record un
employment and inaugurated
what Gov. Brown calls "an era of
limits."
In the face of the recession,
traditional Democratic spending
to help the poor and un
employed ran up dangerous de
ficits, forcing budget cuts and
tax hikes at the city and state
level and fueling inflation in the
•national economy.
Against this backdrop, Carter
and Brown talk of streamlining
bureaucracies, reexamining
costly programs and holding

down federal spending. And
they stress that complex prob
lems cannot be solved, in
Brown's words, "by throwing
money at them."
Yet they remain liberals on
many social issues, combining
social liberalism with fiscal con
servatism in a way that makes
them impossible to classify by
the old liberal-moderate
conservative labels.
New faces
Much of their popularity un
doubtedly comes from style —
both are in their own way run
ning as fresh faces in a new era,
rejecting the well-worn answers
of Washington.
But the central core of those
old answers — at least for the
Democrats — was big spend
ing. And Carter's and Brown's
talk of belt-tightening and re
examining old assumptions has
struck a nerve throughout the
country.
Carter, for instance, has won
support from fiscal conserva
tives, former Wallace suppor
ters, Southerners—but he has
also won a significant percen
tage of the black and liberal vote
and enough aid from those as
sociated with the McCarthy and
McCovern candidacies to be
labeled a "warmed-over
McCovern" by George Wallace.
Brown—with his phenomenal
80-plus percent approval rating
in California —has had much the
same success.
End of "old liberalism"
Joseph Holzinger, an early
McCarthy supporter who was
Northern California Democratic
Party Chairman from 1968-71
and is now number two man in
Carter's California effort, says

"What we are seeing is an end to
the old liberalism—absolutely.
The party is ready to return to
fiscal conservatism, to
Jeffersonian-style democracy."
When Brown declared himself
a candidate—hoping to be cho
sen as a fresh spirit if the conven
tion deadlocks—he presented
his candidacy as an alternative
between "Republican
philosophies that government
can't do anything" and "tradi
tional Democratic approaches
that are running into the diffi
culty that there are limited re
sources."
Both Brown and Carter have
remained vague about how they
hope to achieve what Holzinger
calls "cost-effective liberalism,"
but they clearly plan to take a
harder look at costly programs.
One of Carter's main proposals
is to reorganize and streamline
the federal bureaucracy. And un
like his opponents Henry
Jackson and Morris Udall, he
opposes large-scale federal
spending to create public service
jobs for the unemployed, as well
as direct federal aid to New York
City.
Brown says that as president,
"I'd work hard and ask a lot of
questions," suggesting it is bet
ter to answer complex problems
with "I don't know"and a seri
ous effort to investigate than by
putting more money into inef
fective bureaucracies. •
Conservatism attacked
This new fiscal conservatism
is now under heavy attack by the
traditional New Deal wing of the
party—including organized
labor and candidates Henry
Jackson, Morris Udall and
Hubert Humphrey.

Labor, anxious for a president
committed to federal spending
for full employment, signaled its
attack with an expose of Carter's
use of non-union labor, paid
only $2.54 per hour, on his
peanut farm. Since them its
leaders have publicly urged the
Democratic Platform Committee
to reject the idea that govern
ment has grown too large.
Their favorite, party
stalwart and big spender par
excellence, Hubert Humphrey,
has launched his own "stop Car
ter" movement. Hoping to be
drafted at a deadlocked conven
tion, Humphrey campaigned for
Carter's main opponent in Wis
consin. Morris Udall, and repor
tedly won the backing of a large
number of uncommitted dele
gates elected in New York,
He has repeatedly spoken
against Carter's fiscal conser
vatism and anti-bureaucracy
stance.
In Virginia recently he said
"This business of less govern
ment, this slogan of 'Less Is
More,' is a shoddy, phony busi
ness.
"Don't buy the phrase," Hum
phrey cautions, "Take a look at
the specifics. Take a look at what
they mean. Less for whom? Less
for the people who can least af
ford to suffer the pains of having
less."
Jackson and Udall have simi
larly hammered away at Carter's
unwillingness to lay out con
crete programs to deal with un
employment, urban problems
and the like.
Poll report
But polls show that only Car
ter, at this point, could beat Ford.
The groundswell is clearly with

Brown and Carter, not the tradi
tional Humphrey wing of the
party.
And it is no coincidence that
Brown is a governor and Carter a
former governor.
State government, because it
cannot print money or rack up
huge spending deficits, has been
the proving ground for the new
pragmatism. The vast majority
of the nation's 36 Democrati
tic governors, whether origi
nally elected as conservatives or
liberals, have taken to budget
cutting and belt-tightening in an
effort to bring state finances
under control.
New York City's near default
scared state and local govern
ments. There wasn't a large city
in the nation that didn't at least
take a long hard look at its own
financial situation.
Positive response
In most cases, the response has
been positive, although gover
nors like Massachusetts'
Michael Dukakis and New
York's Hugh Carey have found
that raising taxes to balance
budgets is not as popular as cut
ting programs and expenditures.
The result has been a little
noticed but very real drifting
apart of two segments of the
Democratic party.
Should Carter or Brown win
and remain true to their cam
paign promises, the long-range
consequences could be pro
found. Whether a fiscally con
servative Democratic party
could over the long run hold
onto those constituencies which
have made up the heart of the
party — organized labor,
minorities and the cities — is
perhaps the major question.
