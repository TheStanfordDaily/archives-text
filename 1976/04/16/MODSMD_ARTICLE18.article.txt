LONDON (AP) — Britain's
Labor government, headed by
new Prime Minister James Cal
laghan, unveiled a program
April 6 designed to reduce the
country's crippling rate of infla
tion. It offered income tax relief
in return for voluntary wage re
straint.
The plan was contained in a
proposed national budget out
lined to a packed House of
Commons by Chancellor of the
Exchequer Denis Healey. who
said it would "suffice to produce
the economic miracle we need."
Callaghan, who succeeded
Harold Wilson as prime minis
ter, nodded approval as Healey
spoke. Healey is so far the only
cabinet minister from Wilson's
government asked by Callaghan
to stay on.

In his first broadcast to the na
tion Callaghan said his major
task was to bring down inflation,
now 22.9 percent a year, the
highest in Western Europe, and
to reduce unemployment. His
proposals, which must be ap
proved by Parliament, detailed
government strategy.
The key was Healey's plan to
limit pay increases for the 12
months beginning in August to
three percent of current levels.
On an average industrial wage of
$120 a week this would limit
raises to $3.60. In return, Healey
promised a series of conces
sions, including bigger income
tax deductions.
He emphasized that the pro
posed tax relief measures were
conditional on acceptance of the
three percent limit on pay raises.
