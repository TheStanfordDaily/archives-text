# Gold currency to be eliminated?
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Prop
osals to eliminate gold as inter
national money and establish
flexible new rules for currency
exchange rates are ready tor ap
proval by its 128 members, the
international Monetary Fund
said on April 8.
The initial impact of the
changes on the lives of Ameri
cans probably would be negligi
ble. But in the event they carry
out their purpose of creating a
more stable economic environ
ment in the world, they could be
of considerable significance.
The proposals, which are in

the form of an amendment to the
IMF charter, require each
member "to direct its economic
and financial policies toward the
objective or fostering orderly
economic growth with reasona
ble price stability ..."
Johannes Witteveen the 54-
year-old former Dutch finance
minister who is managing direc
tor of the IMF, predicted it will
be late next year, at the earliest,
before enough nations have ap
proved the proposals to put the
new policies into effect.
He said they need to be ap
proved by at least 77 members

with total voting strength in the
IMF of 80 percent. Since the Un
ited States has 23 percent of the
voting strength, a favorable vote
by the U.S. Congress is essential.
However, only minor stumbl
ing blocks in Congress are likely,
since the the United States had
pushed for the changes in the
role of gold and the system of
currency exchange rates in the
first place.
The exchange rate provision
will make legal what the United
States has been doing since 1974
— letting the value of the U.S.
dollar be set by market forces, a
procedure called "floating."
Old system
The old system of fixed ex
change rates had existed since
the IMF was first established at
Bretton Woods, N.H., in 1944
until the United States took the
beleaguered dollar out of it.
claiming the fixed system has
caused an over-valued dollar
and was damaging the U.S. cur
rency.
The dollar currently is about
12 percent below its interna
tional value in 1971, when a
chain of events began that threw
the world into monetary turmoil.
But by taking the dollar out of
the fixed system, the United
States was in a position of violat
ing the IMF charter, which has
status of a treaty.
Other nations can have fixed
rates, as before, if they wish, but
they cannot impose them on na
tions that don't want them.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Prop
osals to eliminate gold as inter
national money and establish
flexible new rules for currency
exchange rates are ready tor ap
proval by its 128 members, the
international Monetary Fund
said on April 8.
The initial impact of the
changes on the lives of Ameri
cans probably would be negligi
ble. But in the event they carry
out their purpose of creating a
more stable economic environ
ment in the world, they could be
of considerable significance.
The proposals, which are in

the form of an amendment to the
IMF charter, require each
member "to direct its economic
and financial policies toward the
objective or fostering orderly
economic growth with reasona
ble price stability ..."
Johannes Witteveen the 54-
year-old former Dutch finance
minister who is managing direc
tor of the IMF, predicted it will
be late next year, at the earliest,
before enough nations have ap
proved the proposals to put the
new policies into effect.
He said they need to be ap
proved by at least 77 members

with total voting strength in the
IMF of 80 percent. Since the Un
ited States has 23 percent of the
voting strength, a favorable vote
by the U.S. Congress is essential.
However, only minor stumbl
ing blocks in Congress are likely,
since the the United States had
pushed for the changes in the
role of gold and the system of
currency exchange rates in the
first place.
