# Careerism on the rise
## 'Students much more serious now' 
### Palmer Hill 
At 2 on a Thursday afternoon the
Career {Manning and Placement Center
(CPPC) is crowded with students
nervously awaiting interviews by
prospective employers.
"I'm here to be interviewed by a
computer company," says one student
wearing a suit and tie.
"They interview 15 people here and
then they go to Berkeley, UCLA and
other places and interview 15 at each
place. So there's not much hope for
me."
Another student complains that it is
difficult even to get an interview with
an employer.
"I came down here early in the
morning of the day they put out the
interview list for Bank of America,"
she says. "By 8:30 the list was full."
Employment down
U.S. Department of Labor statistics
show that on a nationwide basis,
employment of college graduates is
down 18 percent from 1973-74.
According to the 1974-75 CPPC re-
I port, the number of placements rela
tive to the number of registered stu
dents fell off 11.6 percent during the
past year.
"More students are coming in here
than ever before," says D.L. VVormley,
CPPC assistant tothe director of liberal
arts.
More serious
"Students are much more serious
now." says VVormley. "They're faking
much more of an interest in what they
will do when they get out of school and
are thinking about it earlier."
Kevin Marks, a freshman interested
Jn liberal arts, says."I am fighting the
pre-professional aspect but I think its
going to get me, in light of the pres
sures here. It comes through in the
whole pre-med, pre-law, pre-business
uambit.

"After all," he adds, "being able to
understand Hegel doesn't feed you."
Biology popular
In 1970, English was the most popu
lar major. Biological sciences and
economics, which were then sixth and
seventh most popular, are now respec
tively first and second.
Asst. to the President Bill Stone, also
a freshman adviser, thinks parents are
often part of the student motivation
toward professional positions.
Substantial investment
"It's a substantial investment on the
part of parents to send their chi Idren to
a school like this," he says. "The more
concrete the return on the investment,
the more satisfied they often feel they
will be."
Jean Hetherington, a junior, says her
parents pressure her somewhat to de
cide what she will do when she
graduates.
"My father wanted me to be a doc
tor." she says. "He said it would be a
good career because I could support
myself for the rest of my life."
Opportunities for women
A senior who asked to remain un
named says she is influenced by her
mother when thinking about future
plans, but in a different sense. She
feels that more opportunities are open
to women now and she feels pressured
to become something more than a sec
retary.
"I don't want to end up where my
mother is (a secretary)," she says.
Kelly Karmel, a freshman, cites peer
pressure as her motivation to pick a
major and a career.
"The first question people ask you
when you come here is 'What are you
majoring in?"
