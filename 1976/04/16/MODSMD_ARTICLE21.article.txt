## Henry's: New York style 
### 
Reviews by Nancy Wilson
They call themselves a New
York-style pub, and in decor,
they are. Henry's, on Emerson
Street in Palo Alto, has two sec
tions to offer its customers. As
you peek in under the Irish green
awning, through the glass win
dow front, a New York pub
meets the eye. With wooden bar,
pull up stools, wooden tables
lining the wall and window box,
plants and hat racks interspersed
therein and drapes hanging from
brass railings, it could easily be
in New York.
In the back room, where lunch
and dinner are served, the theme
is carried out to a lesser degree.
And the menu doesn't quite
blend either. Chalkboards at
either end of the room list the
entrees of the day. The selection
is predominately seafood:
abalone, snapper, rainbow trout,
prawns, sand dabs and more.
Then, there is a New York Steak
sandwich, a chuckburger and
quiche lorraine. Henry's also of
fers cold crab and shrimp salads.
We chose the abalone, and
Fetrale Dijonaise. Petrale is a
light, extremely tender fish. So
tender, in fact, that it falls deli
cately apart with the touch of the
fork. Topped with a Dijon sauce,
it is an excellent flavor combina

tion — almost a "melt-in-your
mouth'dish. The abalone, while
good, isn't exceptional. Dinner
comes with soup and salad,
both. After dinner, try some
cheesecake and coffee.
Henry's is a bargain. None of
the complete entrees runs over
$5; most are around $4. Few

other places offer hot entrees
with rice, soup and salad for
such reasonable prices. At this
expense, one can afford to spend
some time in the bar and enjoy
the atmosphere and a drink or
two before or after dinner. Add
to this the very pleasant, prompt
service, and you can't go wrong
at Henry's.
