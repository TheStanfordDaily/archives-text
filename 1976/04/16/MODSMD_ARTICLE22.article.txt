# Salads and wine are the Winery's best bets
## 
### 
Long known on the Stanford
campus, the Winery of Palo Alto
is best known for its salad bar â€”
and all-you-can-drink supply of
house wines. And truthfully,
that is the best it has to offer.
Entree selections include Au
stralian lobster, crab, fish-of
the-day, sirloin steak and com
binations thereof, lamb and beef
stroganoff. We found the Austra
lian lobster tails, by themselves,
to be two rather small tails for a
not-so-small price of over $9.
When served with teriyaki steak,
the problem is not the size of the
lobster portion, but rather the
small, somewhat tough portion
of steak. The rack of lamb is a
tasty dish, but somehow there is
more rack than lamb.

The prices aren't unreasona
ble considering the plentiful
salad bar, with bean salad as well
as shredded lettuce and every
kind of garnish imaginable.
When you pay for the main dish,
you're also paying for lots of
salad and as much wine as you
want.
Overall. I'd stick to the non
combination entrees, more spec
ifically the lamb and beef. With a
healthy salad, dessert and coffee,
you are pleasantly filled, not
over-stuffed. To go with the en
tree, consider the sauteed mus
hrooms. They are still crisp
when served, insead of being
mushy from over-cooking, and
they add to the flavor of a steak.
