# Shirt Tail has a few wrinkles to iron out
## 
### 
Things have changed at the Shirt Tail. Located on El Camino, just
south of campus, the Shirt Tail celebrated its grand opening last
week.
I'm unsure as to what it used to be like and 1 cannot say whether
they've improved, or even if they've changed much at all. They are
presently offering seafood and continental cuisine including fresh
Maine lobster, Italian veal dishes, west coast fish, French gourmet
specialties, and several beef cuts. The entrees come with soup or
salad, u small preliminary dish of spaghetti and ravioli, a plate of
salad and bread and butter. Some items are available a la carte, and
several dishes can be prepared at your tableside it requested.
I'm told the fried prawns are delicious. The Crab Cioppino is a
bit of a surprise. Crab, shrimp, and clams came all in the shell in a
large bowl with the cioppino sauce all drained to the bottom.
Removing the meat from the shell isn't unpleasant, but the reward
doesn't seem commensurate. The sauce has a light tomato flavor.'
My friends report an unexceptional fresh lobster, abalonea bit oir
the tough side, a fine veal scalloppini and a good steak. Â»
The green goddess salad dressing comes out ahead of both thff
minestrone and gazpacho soups. And the only thing that tops the*
crepe suzette is the Aztec fire, a flaming after-dinner drink.
Prices at the Shirt Tail range from $5 and $6 to as high as over $10
for some of the specialties. Dessert is extra, as well as any appetiz
ers. The atmosphere seems to be a lingering part of the old image,
with vinyl-cushioned chairs and lighting somewhat reminiscent of
a hotel dining room. The Shirt Tail also boasts a Ski Lodge
Lounge,featuring fireplace and piano bar entertainment.
A new part of their menu, to start next week is an earlv-bird
dinner. Served from 4 to 7 p.m., the restaurant will offer light meals
in the $H to $4 range. And just opened is the Sunday Steamship
brunch, for $5.35 with buffet selections of eggs, omelets, blintzes,
fish, meats and salads. (Only $3 for children!)
It is the lit-up sign outside that hints of the former Shirt Tail
image, and a few fine dishes hint of what may yet develop. Stick to
some of the simpler meats, and give it a little time.
