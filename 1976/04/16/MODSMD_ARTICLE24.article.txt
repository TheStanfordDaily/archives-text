## Card nine rips Spartans, 18-7 
### Linda Buddenberg 
Erupting for a season high IB
runs, the Stanford baseball team
wasted San Jose State 18-7, in a
game Wednesday afternoon at
Sunken Diamond.
Before the game, Stanford
coach Kay Young told his
players he was worried they
weie working too hard and
not enjoying the game enough.
So, at the expense of the Spar
tans, the Cards made baseball
look like fun.
Using 15 players, the Cards
showed no mercy on the San Jose
pitchers. Steve Davis highligh
ted the destruction with a home
run in the fourth inning, his
ninth for the season.
Lots of help
Stanford had a lot of help from
San Jose in scoring its runs, as
Spartan pitchers walked 14
Stanford batters and let wild
pitches go. Spartan fielders did
their part, too, by contributing
three errors and a lot of sloppy
ball-handling.
The Cardinals also had a good
time on the basepaths again,
picking up nine more stolen
bases. Gary I'itchford drew four
walks and stole three bases, and
Gary Bei and Larry Reynolds
each had two steals.
"We really needed this one,"
said Young. "The team was get

ting into a slump, they were let
ting their heads get down."
"It's really important to keep
the right attitude — the game is
so mental. They need to believe
in themselves more," he added.
Winning pitcher Brian Harri
son started believing in himself
more as the game went on. He
was throwing rather than pitch
ing fur the first few innings, and
relying too heavily on his
fastball, Young said.
Loosened up
Harrison soon loosened up,
though. During the five innings
he pitched before being relieved
by Joe LoPresti, Harrison gave up
three runs, two walks and struck
out five, to increase his season
record to 5-1.
Young was impressed with
the two pitchers, saying, "Both
of them looked better today. Har
rison's last three innings were
really good and LoPresti did a
good job, too — he just needs
more time on the mound."
Asked what San Jose's
weakness was, one Cardinal re
plied, "Easy. They have abso
lutely no talent." But Young said
this weekend's opponent,
California, will be tougher.
"Man for man, they're the best
team in the conference," said
Young. "Their record (6-5) just
doesn't bear them out.
"Their pitching isn't deep, but
they've got a couple of real good
starters."
The Cards play a single game
against Cal at Sunken Diamond
Friday at 2:30 p.m., and a
double-header at Berkeley
Saturday at noon.

this weekend's opponent,
California, will be tougher.
"Man for man, they're the best
team in the conference," said
Young. "Their record (6-5) just
doesn't bear them out.
"Their pitching isn't deep, but
they've got a couple of real good
starters."
The Cards play a single game
against Cal at Sunken Diamond
Friday at 2:30 p.m., and a
double-header at Berkeley
Saturday at noon.

LOTS OF HELP—Freshman pitcher Brian Harrison registered his
fifth win Wednesday, as the Stanford baseball team scored 18 runs
against San )ose State.
Erupting for a season high IB
runs, the Stanford baseball team
wasted San Jose State 18-7, in a
game Wednesday afternoon at
Sunken Diamond.
Before the game, Stanford
coach Kay Young told his
players he was worried they
weie working too hard and
not enjoying the game enough.
So, at the expense of the Spar
tans, the Cards made baseball
look like fun.
Using 15 players, the Cards
showed no mercy on the San Jose
pitchers. Steve Davis highligh
ted the destruction with a home
run in the fourth inning, his
ninth for the season.
Lots of help
Stanford had a lot of help from
San Jose in scoring its runs, as
Spartan pitchers walked 14
Stanford batters and let wild
pitches go. Spartan fielders did
their part, too, by contributing
three errors and a lot of sloppy
ball-handling.
The Cardinals also had a good
time on the basepaths again,
picking up nine more stolen
bases. Gary I'itchford drew four
walks and stole three bases, and
Gary Bei and Larry Reynolds
each had two steals.
"We really needed this one,"
said Young. "The team was get

ting into a slump, they were let
ting their heads get down."
"It's really important to keep
the right attitude — the game is
so mental. They need to believe
in themselves more," he added.
Winning pitcher Brian Harri
son started believing in himself
more as the game went on. He
was throwing rather than pitch
ing fur the first few innings, and
relying too heavily on his
fastball, Young said.
Loosened up
Harrison soon loosened up,
though. During the five innings
he pitched before being relieved
by Joe LoPresti, Harrison gave up
three runs, two walks and struck
out five, to increase his season
record to 5-1.
Young was impressed with
the two pitchers, saying, "Both
of them looked better today. Har
rison's last three innings were
really good and LoPresti did a
good job, too — he just needs
more time on the mound."
Asked what San Jose's
weakness was, one Cardinal re
plied, "Easy. They have abso
lutely no talent." But Young said
this weekend's opponent,
California, will be tougher.
"Man for man, they're the best
team in the conference," said
Young. "Their record (6-5) just
doesn't bear them out.
