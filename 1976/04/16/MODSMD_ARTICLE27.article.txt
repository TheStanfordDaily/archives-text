# Cage recruits to vie for starting spots

The signing Wednesday of
two top prep basketball players
could signal the resurrection of
Stanford's hoop fortunes.
Head coach Dick Dißiaso and
his assistants, Bob Frederick and
Tom McLaughlin, hustled and
scrapped to sign the prospects,
Kimberly Belton, a 6-foot-6, 225
pound forward from New York
City and Tom Schmalzried, a
6-10 215 pound center from Ft.
Lauderdale, Fla.
Belton, who averaged 20
points and 17 rebounds per
game the past season, is the first
team All-New York City selec
tion and a prep Ail-American.
"Kimberly's a big, strong
tough kid," said Chet
Slaybaugh, Belton's coach at
Horace Mann High School.
"He's a very strong rebounder."
Good leader
According to Slaybaugh, Bel
ton also is a good leader. "He
was the captain of our team. He
controlled the game tempo, told
the other players when to set it
up, when to slow it down. He's a
take charge guy."
Slaybaugh believes Belton's
biggest adjustment in going
from the prep ranks to the col
legiate scene will be "learning
how to play from the outside.

Unfortunately, he didn't get
much of an opportunity to play
outside in high school."
Belton played center, alternat
ing between the high and low
posts.
"Belton's just awesome," said
KZSU sportscaster Gary Cohen,
who saw Belton play in a high
school All-Star game recently.
"He's physically like Adrian
Dantley of Notre Dame. He
makes George Schader look
small."
Great leaper
"Belton's a great leaper and
shot blocker," added Cohen, "al
though he has a tendency to try
to block everything."
After signing a national letter
of intent, Belton left for Europe
with a New York AAU team
which will play eight games in
Madrid, Dublin and Barcelona.
Frederick said that Belton also
has been invited to join a group
of prep All-Stars who will tour
the Soviet Union this summer.
Tom Schmalzried, the second
signee, is a two-time All-Stater
in Florida and a prep All
-
He averaged 18.2 points and
19.2 rebounds a game for Cardi
nal Gibbons High School.
A near straight-A student,
Schmalzried plans to be a pre

med.
Psychiatry Prof. William De
ment. head of the Stanford Sleep
Research Center, showed
Schmalzried the academic side
of Stanford when the prepster
visited the campus earlier this
year.
"Schmalzried has terrific po
tential both as a basketball
player and as a student," said
Dement, an avid Card basketball
fan. "I wanted to impress upon
him that Stanford has a lot to of
fer."
Dement added that "Schmal
zried is extraordinarily articu
late and an awfully nice guy."
Frederick said that the recruit
ing coups "will make the sum
mer a lot more enjoyable."
As to whether both signees
will move right into the Card
starting lineup next year, Fre
derick said "they'll both cer
tainly have the opportunity to
vie for starting spots next sea
son."
Also pleased
Stanford Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz was also pleased with the
signings. "The signings bode
well for the future and l think
Dick (Dißiaso) has done a re
markable job in getting these
people."
Ruetz said "this was a critical
year for Dick in recruiting. Now
he can get more of the offense
and style he wants."
The recruiting was critical for
another big reason; the Cards
needed some tall players to re
place graduating seniors and
starters Ed Schweitzer and Tim
Patterson.
Ruetz believes one important
factor was Dißiaso was know
ledge of the national recruiting
scene.
"He's committed to making
Stanford a national contender,"
said Ruetz. "The hurdles are
enormous, but if anyone can do
it, I think he can."
Dißiaso, although he already
has recruited two top players,
isn't stopping there. He was in
the Midwest, trying to sign
another prospect yesterday.
