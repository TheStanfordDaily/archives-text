# Men netters face Bruins, Trojans
## 
### Paul Bauman 
Stanford's men's tennis team
will host UCLA tomorrow and
you know what happened the
last time teams from those two
schools met on the Farm.
And if you don't, it's just as
well. The Bruin cagers beat the
Cards by what seemed like 150
points. Unfortunately for Stan
ford followers, the UCLA tennis
squad, No. 1 in the nation, is
capable of the same kind of de
struction even though Dick
Gould's Cards (9-2) are ranked
second.
UCLA is that much better. The
Bruins are 15-0 this season and
have won 34 matches in a row
going back to last year. UCLA
has never lost more than two in
dividual matches against any
one school this year.
UCLA beat Stanford, 8-1, two
weeks ago in Los Angeles.
Even stronger
Many people, including
Gould, believe UCLA may be
even stronger than last year's
Billy Martin-led squad. The big
reason is Peter Fleming, a trans
fer from Michigan. Fleming, a
junior, is No. 2 in U.S. amateur
rankings behind teammate Brian
Teacher, and No. 29 in U.S.
men's rankings.
Fleming, who plays at first
singles for the Bruins, will play
Pat DuPre Saturday night in
Maples Pavilion. DuPre will be
making his debut at the top of
Stanford's ladder. Gould moved
the Card senior up from second
singles this week to replace Bill
Maze.
DuPre is coming off a straight
set victory over Trinity All
- Bill Matyastik, his
biggest Stanford match since
undergoing wrist surgery last
spring. Maze has been having
trouble in the top spot. His only
wins this month have come
against California, a school with
absolutely no tennis reputation.

Behind Fleming for UCLA, in
order, are Teacher, Ferdi
Taygan, Bruce Nichols, John
Austin and Tony Graham.
Teacher is a three-time All -
American and the 23rd-ranked
men's player in the U.S. Taygan
is another All-American and a
former national junior champ
ion.
Today the Cards go against
USC, and the Trojans are not the
pushovers in tennis that they are
in other sports. USC has a 13-3
record this year and ranks third
in the country. The Trojans' only
losses have been to UCLA and
Stanford. The Cards beat USC,
7-2, in the National Team Indoor
Tournament in February and 5-4
in Los Angeles a couple weeks
ago.
The Trojans' top man, now
that Butch Walts has turned pro,
is Bruce Manson. The sopho
more Ail-American beat Maze in
straight sets in L.A., but faces
DuPre tonight in Maples.
No match-up
The rest of USC's lineup
doesn't match up to UCLA's, or
even Stanford's for that matter.
The Cards have defeated USC
eight consecutive times in the
past four years. Look for number
nine.
It was thought that Gene
Mayer, who has been plagued by
a muscle pull in his back, might
break into the Cards' singles
lineup for USC and UCLA, but
he'll play only doubles.
"He's healthy enough to
play,"Gould said, "buthehasn't
played any (singles) matches in
about two months. We're going
to give him this week to practice
hard. He should play singles at
the Ojai Intercollegiates next
week."
Outdoor play both days begins
at 1 p.m. on the Varsity Courts.
First singles,second singles and
first doubles will be played in
Maples Friday and Saturday
starting at 6:30 p.m.

THE THIRD MAN—Freshman Mark Mitchell will be playing third
singles this weekend, as Stanford takes on USC and UCLA. Mitch
ell, a prep All-American at Palo Alto's Gunn High School last
year, will face the Trojan's Mike Newberry and the Bruins' Ferdi
Taygan. He will also pair with teammate Ferry Wright to play
third doubles.
