Olympians.
That's the billing for tomor
row's double dual track meet at
Stanford Stadium when Stan
ford squares off with UCLA, and
California and USC battle head
to head.
Southern Cal brings the team
many believe to be the best in the
nation to the Farm tomorrow for
the meet.which begins with the

field events at 1:15 p.m. and the
track events at 1:30.
But the Bruins, runners up in
last year's NCAA final, have
their own ideas about which
team is stronger. Track and field
fans can decide for themselves
after tomorrow's meet.
Assault
In addition to the Olympic as
pirants on display tomorrow, an

Olympic Trials or the 1962
U.S.-U.S.S.R. meet.
The stadium 100 meter, 200
meter and pole vault records are
almost certain to fall tomorrow.

meters and both the 400 meter
and mile relays will also fall.
Numerous meet and school re
cords are also expected to be
broken.
But the meet is expected to
offer more than just broken re

terrific individual matchups. In
the Stanford-UCLA end of the
meet, Robber Baron long jumper
James Lofton is pitted against the
Bruins' Willie Banks, who is un
defeated this year.
Square off

vin Holmes will square off with

and Bennie Miles in the 200.
Baron hurdler John Foster will
be challenged by high hurdler
James Owens second in the
NCAA highs last year and Phil
Mills (third iri the Pac-8 inter
mediates last year).
The feature races in the USC-
Cal portion will include the 100
and 200 which put Berkeley's
Wesley Walker on the line with
the Trojans' James Gilkes.
Another showdown should be
the 800 meters with Pac-8 co
leaders Rayfield Beaton of USC
and James Robinson of Cal.
Beaton and Robinson both have
season bests of 1:48.6.

track events at 1:30.
But the Bruins, runners up in
last year's NCAA final, have
their own ideas about which
team is stronger. Track and field
fans can decide for themselves
after tomorrow's meet.
Assault
In addition to the Olympic as
pirants on display tomorrow, an
assault will be made on at least
seven stadium records, many

dating back to the 1960 U.S.
Olympic Trials or the 1962
U.S.-U.S.S.R. meet.
The stadium 100 meter, 200
meter and pole vault records are
almost certain to fall tomorrow.
There is a strong possibility that
records in the 400 meters, 5000
meters and both the 400 meter
and mile relays will also fall.
Numerous meet and school re
cords are also expected to be
broken.
But the meet is expected to
offer more than just broken re
cords. The meet will have some
terrific individual matchups. In
the Stanford-UCLA end of the
meet, Robber Baron long jumper
James Lofton is pitted against the
Bruins' Willie Banks, who is un
defeated this year.
Square off
In the sprints, Stanford's Mar
vin Holmes will square off with
Dotson Wilson in the 100 meters
and Bennie Miles in the 200.
Baron hurdler John Foster will
be challenged by high hurdler
James Owens second in the
NCAA highs last year and Phil
Mills (third iri the Pac-8 inter
mediates last year).
The feature races in the USC-
Cal portion will include the 100
and 200 which put Berkeley's
Wesley Walker on the line with
the Trojans' James Gilkes.
Another showdown should be
the 800 meters with Pac-8 co
leaders Rayfield Beaton of USC
and James Robinson of Cal.
Beaton and Robinson both have
season bests of 1:48.6.
