Eighteen faculty members here have
received Guggenheim Fellowships for
1976.
This figure was the second highest
nationally, slightly behind UC-
Berkeley, where 21 faculty members
won this award, but substantially
ahead of the Stanford of the East, Har
vard, which had 11 winners.
The award, which allows its reci
pients to spend a year pursuing re
search interests of their choice, is
awarded on the basis of "demonstrated
accomplishments in the past and
strong promise for the future."
Some 300 awards are awarded
nationally each year. Their total value
is nearly $4.2 million.
Natural science projects
Half of the awards given to faculty
here were for projects in the natural
sciences, including biology, im
munogenetics, electrical engineering
and applied physics, low temperature
physics, physical chemistry and fluid
mechanics.
Five were in social scientific fields,
including urban design, anthropol
ogy, political science, education and
psychology.
Three involve literary topics: mod
ern Spanish American literature,
Goethe and tragic drama.
Three recipients will spend some of
their time in Gambridge, England.

Genetics Prof. Leonard Herzenberg
will be working with Cesar Milstein, a
leading molecular immunologist at
Cambridge. Herzenberg will be work
ing on perfecting his flourescence ac
tivated cell sorter (FACS), which is
used to separate myelomas and anti
body producing cells from other non
viable cells in mice.
'Fluid flows'
Chemical Engineering Prof. An
dreas Acrivos will also be in Cam
bridge for six months, at the Universi
ty's Department of Applied Mathema
tics and Theoretical Physics, working
on problems of fluid mechanics,
which he says deals with "the flow of
fluids, simple ones, like water and oil
and air, everyday substances, nothing
exotic."
Adj. Prof. C.YV.F. Everitt, at the Han
sen Laboratories of Physics, will be
spending "three or four months in Bri
tain (Cambridge), Scotland and maybe
elsewhere," doing research and writ
ing a biography of the 19th century
physicist James Clerk Maxwell.
Other recepients will be travelling to
other locations in England.
Asst. Prof, of Hemotology Laurence
Kedes will be working at the Imperial
Cancer Research Fund Laboratories in
London, where he will be "exploring
the possibility of transferring genes
from one animal to another by means
of genetic engineering."
Specifically, he will be transplant
ing sea urchin genes into tumor vir
uses and then putting the viruses into
mouse cells. The purpose of this pro
cedure is to determine whether or not
DNA inserted in this manner can be
replicated and whether the new genes
can be expressed in the new host.
Mathematics Dept. Chairman Robert
Osserman will spend half of his fel
lowship period at the University of

Warwick, working in a special diffe
rential geometry program, and half of
the period working with mathemati
cians and teaching at the summer ses
sion at Stanford-in-Florence.
Hiding out
Also leaving campus will be Electri
cal Engineering Prof. Stephen Harris,
who will be spending the first half of
his research period at Dartmouth, in
New Hampshire, doing "theoretical
work in the field of non-linear optics.
He says he will spend the second half
of the time "at Stanford, hiding," pre
"â€¢srnrrably wrrttrrg up the research of the
previous half year.
Psychology Prof. Ewart Thomas will
be working on two separate projects.
Education and Psychology Prof.
Nathaniel Gage will be working on
three related issues in the study of
teaching.
Finally, Assoc. Prof, of Anthropol
ogy George Collier will be working in
"libraries in North America" inves
tigating "the ethnic group relations of
indigenous groups." He will be inves
tigating how native mesoamerican
peoples "became Indians."
Other recipients of the award were:
German Prof. Katharina Mommsen;
Assoc. Prof, of Chemistry Hans Ander
sen; Assoc. Law Prof. Richard Danzig;
Physics Prof. William Fairbank; Assoc.
Prof, of Biological Sciences Marcus
Feldman; Computer Science Dept.
Chairman Robert Floyd; Spanish and
Portuguese Dept. Chairman Jean
Franco; Drama Dept. Chairman
Charles Lyons; Urban Design Lecturer
Rai Okamoto.
