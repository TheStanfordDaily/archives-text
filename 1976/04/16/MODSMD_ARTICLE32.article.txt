# Women netters visit UCLA, SC
## 
### 
After last week's successful al
liance between the meri sand
women's tennis teams, the
women head off this weekend on
their own course.
While the men receive the

comforts of Maples Pavilion Fri
day and Saturday against USC
and UCLA, the women netters
will be playing in the Los
Angeles smog; against UCLA on
Friday and USC on Saturday.
UCLA, 13-1, has lost only to
Arizona State. The Bruins are led
by freshman Paula Smith and
senior Cindy Thomas. Accord
ing to Stanford coach Anne Hill,
UCLA's strength is in its overall
depth straight through the order.
Combating that depth will be
Lele Forood at first singles, Barb
Jordan at second, Susie Hagey
playing in the third singles posi
tion, Marcy O'Keefe at fourth,
and Diane Morrison and Liza
Pande rounding out the singles
lineup.
The Cards will play Forood
and Jordan together in the first
doubles position, followed by
Hagey-Morrison and Pande-
O'Keefe
On Saturday, the netters meet
the Trojans, 4-5 for the season.
"USC is extremely strong at
the top with Barb Halquist,
Diane Desfor and Gretchen
Gault," says Hill. "Halquist and
Desfor can match the top two
players at any school in the
country."
USC's depth is minimal, how
ever, and is responsible for its
poor record this season.
