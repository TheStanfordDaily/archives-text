## Cornett shuns pro golf 
### David Georgette 
Women's professional golf — now there's a
game with big bucks. After all, aren't Sandra
Palmer and Laura Baugh raking in all those
Colgate-Palmolive dollars?
But Stanford senior Pat Cornett. No. 1 on
the women's golf team, says she will pass up
the opportunity to go pro next year.
"I can't see myself playing for money."
Cornett explains. "My parents are a little bit
for it, but for me there's nothing more excit
ing than an amateur tounament."
Carroll Diaz, coach of the women's team,
says, "Pat would make a fine player on the
tour."
Cornett's accomplishments so far include
taking third last year in the national champ
ionships of the Association for Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women (AIAW) and winning
the women's section of the 1975 San Fran
cisco City Open.
Med school
Come autumn, though, Cornett, a biology
major, will be attending medical school and
says she will become only a "weekend
golfer."
"The way 1 look at it," Cornett says,"I have
about five more months of competition, and I
plan to make the best of it. When 1 go to
medical school, I'll probably have to give up
competitive golf."
Four years ago, Cornett says she also
thought she was through with golf. "When I
came to Stanford. I thought I'd never play golf
again," Cornett recalls, explaining she
thought classwork would force her to give up
golf.
When Cornett found out there was time to
make it to the tee, she stuck with golf —
without accomplishing much. "My first two
vears were miserable,"she asserts. "I'm sure

the coach thought I was a hack player. It was
personally frustrating."
Drastic turn
Events took a drastic turn for the better
when Cornett won the San Francisco City
Open in early 1975. "Things started click
ing," she says, and "1 started getting confi
dence. which is pretty important."
Cornett says she regards the triumph in the
City Open as a watershed in her career. "San
Francisco was the complete turnaround. 1
was a loser until then, and since then I've
been a winner. It was such a change."
The victory also heralded the start of a sea
son in which Cornett captured the Arizona
State University Sun Devil Invitational, the
University of Oregon Daisy Duck Invita
tional, the Stanford Invitational and made
NCIAC All-Conference.
She topped off the year by winning the
California state amateur title, which she
calls "a kind of dream come true."
Looking forward
Cornett says she still has more to do.
"I'm always looking forward. The challenge
is going out there the next time and win
ning." But even with winning, she says,
doubts can persist. "You sometimes wonder
if the last one you won was it."
It's a safe bet Cornett's most recent victory
(in a Northern California Intercollegiate Ath
letic Conference tournament at San Jose last
week) won't be her last, at least the way she's
playing now.
Says Diaz, "Pat is hitting every shot right to
the flag. Her confidence is really there."
If Cornett continues to play with the same
confidence and ability displayed recently,
she may depart for med school with a crown
ing triumph — the AIAW national champ
ionship. "I'd love to win it," she says.
She just might.
