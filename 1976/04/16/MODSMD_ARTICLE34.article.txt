Russian dissidents sentenced
MOSCOW — A 35-year-old Russian human rights ac
tivist was sentenced yesterday to five years' exile from
Moscow.
Another political rebel got two-and-a-half years at hard
labor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei Sakharov and
his wife got retaliatory beatings by police, dissident
sources reported.
The exile sentence for Andrei Tverdokhlebov, the sec
retary of the Soviet branch of Amnesty International,
amounts to two years because of time already spent in jail.
His sentence and the labor term for Crimean Tatar
nationalist Mustafa Djemilev, 32, were the second and
third verdicts against Soviet dissidents in two days.
On Wednesday in Lithuania, Valery Mareshin. who had
refused to testify at the trial of another dissident last De
cember, was ordered to forfeit 20 percent of his wages for
six months.
Sakharov has been in the Siberian city of Omsk, 1400
miles east of Moscow .to attend Djemilev's trial. He and his
wife, Yelena, were detained briefly Wednesday after, the
Soviet news agency Tass said, they each struck two
policemen.
Yelena said in a telephone call to friends in Moscow that
the two had been taken back to a police station yesterday
morning after Djemilev's sentencing and were beaten.
Court officials claimed they created a disturbance when
the sentence was announced, Yelena said. It was not
known how serious the reported beating was, but the
couple apparently did not seek medical treatment.
Lebanese fighting escalates
BEIRUT — Fierce artillery battles between Moslem and
Christian gunmen yesterday threatened to bury attempts
for a political end to the fighting and increased the danger
of Syrian military intervention.
Police reported 138 killed and more than 200 wounded
in savage shelling in the Beirut area and in Christian and
Moslem hill towns east of the capital.
"The fighting is escalating ferociously on almost all
fronts," a security forces spokesman said. "There are more
killed on the ground than we can count because we cannot
reach stricken areas."
The casualty toll neared the level reached during the
civil war's heaviest artillery battles three weeks ago. Con
servative estimates put the number killed in the year-long
conflict at 15,500.
U.S.-Greek accord reached
WASHINGTON — The United States agreed yesterday
to give Greece $700 million in arms aid over four years in
exchange for the use of Greek military bases.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Greek Foreign
Minister Dimitri Bitsios initialed a statement of principles

setting out guidelines for upcoming final negotiations.
These talks will begin immediately and should be com
pleted in four to six weeks. State Department officials said.
The accord is parallel to an earlier agreement reached
with Turkey under which the Ankara government will
receive $1 billion over four years in exchange for reopen
ing 26 Turkish bases for American use.
Laird: CIA halted terrorist plots
NEW YORK — Former Defense Secretary Melvin Laird
says the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has thwarted a
number of terrorist death plots in the United States, in
cluding an attempted mass killing with bombs in inid
town Manhattan three years ago.
Writing in next month's Header's Digest, in defense of
American intelligence services, Laird said the bombing
plot involved setting off two cars laden with explosives at
noon,decimating lunch-hour throngs in the busy streets.
"While Israel's Premier Golda Meir was visiting New
York City on March 4, 1973, police rushed to busy mid
town intersections and hauled away two cars with enough
Soviet-made explosives to kill everybody within a 100-
yard radius," Laird said.
Laird's article, "Let's Stop Undermining the CIA." says
the CIA has aborted numerous plots by infiltrating ter
rorist movements.
Hearst's condition shaky
REDWOOD CITY — Patricia Hearst has a large air-filled
blister on her right lung which could cause it to collapse
again a doctor said yesterday.
Donald Rowles described Hearst's progress as satisfac
tory but cautioned that the blister — about the size of a
silver dollar — could rupture for a second time, spilling
air into her chest cavity.
"There is a chance for eventual surgery to remove it,"he
said. "But it could spontaneously heal."
A special chest tube is being used to pump air out of the
chest cavity, permitting the damaged lung to stay inflated
with air.
Meanwhile, in Sacramento, Steven Soliah's attorneys
asked a federal judge to order prosecutors to reveal what
Hearst may have told them about a 1975 bank robbery and
murder.
Defense attorney Sheldon Otis asked U.S. District Court
Judge Philip Wilkins to hold a hearing into reports that
Hearst had been talking to federal investigators about the
holdup.
