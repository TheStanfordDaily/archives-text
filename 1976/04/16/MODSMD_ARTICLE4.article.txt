"We are delighted by the results,"
said Petroff, after hearing Murray read
off the results at the ASSU office yes
terday afternoon.
"It indicates the students want a
new type of government," he said. He
said he foresaw a week of hard work

ahead of his slate in preparation for the
runoffs.
Tyndall confident
Bill Tyndall, speaking for the How
ard slate, said "We are very pleased
with the results.and are very confident
of a victory next Thursday."
A joint statement issued by the
members of the Hammer and Coffin
slate said "... We .. . fervently
adhere to ... a policy of . . . respect
to . . . this great . . . land.
"Congratulations to all
our . . . worthy • • • opponents."
(Editor's Note: The statement of the
Hammer and Coffin slate exceeded
space limitations and. unfortunately,
appears here in an edited version.)
Warren height of the D. height slate
commented "We are ama/ed at doing
what we set out to do. Our apathetic
friends proved their diligence, their
perserverance to the apathetic ideal.
Despite enormous pressure, they
didn't turn out to vote. We thank them
for that. For a campaign where we
spent only 12 cents and virtually no
time campaigning, we won 10 percent
of the vote. We think that might be a
lesson.
"Seriously, all four members of our
slate will be voting for the Howard
slate in the run-off election. We urge
our non-apatheticsupporters to do this
also."

NOT QUITE ENOUGH—Nearly 2900 students voted in the ASSU election this
week, but with four Council of Presidents slates splitting the vote, no one slate
received a majority of votes. The Petroff and Howard slates will face each
other next week in a run-off election. All fee assessments were passed by the
students, and the Dorsey slate won the senior class officers race.
Scott Jones of the defeated Jones
senior class slate commented, "We are
very pleased with the election. It was
an interesting experience. We all had a
good time running — it was a new
experience. We congratulate the
others. It was more interesting than the
COP. We were having fun; the COF
was kind of a political thing. We tried
to impress others. We had a good time,
and thank our supporters."
Mike Dorsey, speaking on behalf of
his fellow senior ofificers Dave
Treinis, Jamie Grodsky and Risa
Shimoda, said, "We'd like to thank our
competitors for running a very graci
ousand honest campaign. We'd also
like to thank those who voted for us
and enlist their help for next year
since we will need a lot of help to
accomplish our objectives."
