# More attractive salaries elsewhere
## Profs lured away 
### Bill Sposato 
"Princeton is running away from us,
and even relatively obscure institu
tions, such as the University of Vir
ginia, have built up English, French
and German departments far outclas
sing ours," French Prof. Robert Cohn
charged last quarter, but Assoc. Dean
of Humanities and Sciences Lewis
Spitz said yesterday,"I think we are in
a strong enough position" in the
humanities.
As evidence of Stanford's decline,
Cohn pointed out that former Stanford
German Prof. Walter Sokol,whom Cohn
described as one of the best Germanists
in the country, has moved to the Uni
versity of Virginia.
But Spitz, known as a strong suppor
ter of the humanities, disagrees with
Cohn. Spitz said that despite the loss of
Sokol. the German Department is
doing very well. With top people such
as Theodore Anderson, Katharina
Mommsen and Gerald Gillespie. Spitz
said the department may now become
No. 1 in the country.
Astronomical salary
Spitz said that Sokol was lured to
Virginia by an "astronomical salary."
Setting up university-wide profes
sorships was one method proposed by
Cohn to attract top people. This
method, already in practice at Har
vard, among other schools, establishes

professors who are not connected to
any single department This creates a
sense of importance for the professor,
which cannot be duplicated by salary,
Cohn contends.
"The title of full professor no longer
means much," he added.
Stanford has considered creating
such professorships, Spitz said, but
the idea was rejected as not being very
useful. It would lower the morale of
professors within departments, Spitz
claimed. University professors are bas
ically free agents who can do what
they want anyway, he added.
$5 million endowment
Cohn also suggested that an en
dowment of $5 million be set aside for
attracting top scholars. This would be
"peanuts" compared to the cost of a
new building, Cohn said, and would
do more to further Stanford's prestige.
But Spitz said that only five en
dowed chairs could be set up with $5
million, which, spread across the
twelve humanities and sciences de
partments, would have a minimal ef
fect.
The University is as shrewd as any
other institution when it comes to re
cruiting, Spitz said. It should be able to
attract top flight people in the future.
"The Harvard people are
the ones who are worried," he added.

Cohn. Spitz said that despite the loss of
Sokol. the German Department is
doing very well. With top people such
as Theodore Anderson, Katharina
Mommsen and Gerald Gillespie. Spitz
said the department may now become
No. 1 in the country.
Astronomical salary
Spitz said that Sokol was lured to
Virginia by an "astronomical salary."
Setting up university-wide profes
sorships was one method proposed by
Cohn to attract top people. This
method, already in practice at Har
vard, among other schools, establishes

professors who are not connected to
any single department This creates a
sense of importance for the professor,
which cannot be duplicated by salary,
Cohn contends.
"The title of full professor no longer
means much," he added.
Stanford has considered creating
such professorships, Spitz said, but
the idea was rejected as not being very
useful. It would lower the morale of
professors within departments, Spitz
claimed. University professors are bas
ically free agents who can do what
they want anyway, he added.
$5 million endowment
Cohn also suggested that an en
dowment of $5 million be set aside for
attracting top scholars. This would be
"peanuts" compared to the cost of a
new building, Cohn said, and would
do more to further Stanford's prestige.
But Spitz said that only five en
dowed chairs could be set up with $5
million, which, spread across the
twelve humanities and sciences de
partments, would have a minimal ef
fect.
The University is as shrewd as any
other institution when it comes to re
cruiting, Spitz said. It should be able to
attract top flight people in the future.
"The Harvard people are
the ones who are worried," he added.
