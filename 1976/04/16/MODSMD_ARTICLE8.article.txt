## 'Daily' story in 'error' 
### 
Rosenbaum, et al.

The Daily's contention April 12 that "The Stan
ford Judicial Council (SJC) was apparently ap
proved last spring by the ASSU Senate in viola
tion of the ASSU Constitution" was made in obvi
ous haste by a dubious interpretation of that Con
stitution that smacks of irresponsible journalism.
The statements attributed to us in the Daily are
based on incomplete information provided to us
by the Daily over the weekend. Upon closer
analysis of the documents in question, we have
concluded that the Daily is in error.
The Daily contends that the Senate's ratifica
t;on of a 1975 student referendum approving
amendments to the Legislative and Judicial Char
ter did not receive a necessary two-thirds vote.
The question at hand, however, was not one of
"recogniz(ing) the authority of university judicial
bodies over members of the Association."
Rather, it was one of approving the amend
ments in the composition of an already
recognized judicial body. The Daily was made
aware of this interpretation, and yet refused to
offer it in comparison to its own opinion in its
news story.
This does not automatically dispel the Daily's
line of argument. One might construe that any
time the charter is amended,thequestion is one of
recognizing its legitimacy. This is further com
pounded by the nebulous state of the SJC from the
time of its supersession by President Richard
Lyman by means of his residual power as outlined
in Article IV of the charter.
Not new body
Nonetheless, it appears that the SJC as amended
last spring was not a new body, but a revived one
whose legitimacy had been recognized in 1968
and was therefore still binding. The return to the
SJC from the Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) im
posed by Lyman should be interpreted as that, the
return to a legitimate system.
We wish to make it clear that we are not at
tempting to thwart efforts to challenge the
amended SJC]. We are opposed to its composition,
both in the absence of a student majority in all
cases and in the nonequivalent selection methods
utilized for faculty, who are selected by a commit
tee, and students, who are first randomly chosen
by computer, then interviewed by the Nomina

tions Committee and approved by the Senate. We
still wish for the Committee of Fifteen to meet to
consider again these problems.
Nor does this clarify the result of last spring's
election, in which the number of students voting
no and the people abstaining in the vote outnum
bered those voting yes by more than two-to-one.
The ballot was confusing and many students
complained. The result was a frustrated ratifica
tion of the outcome of the vote. This was an
attempt to prevent the stigma of overturning a
vote which did not meet with the approval of
student politicians.
Not pleased
We recall that the Daily was not pleased with
this vote, either. But now, eleven and a half
months after the fact (and, conveniently, in the
week of a Daily fee assessment referendum), it has
chosen to attempt to overturn the somewhat gar
bled voice of those students who voted. While we
too are dissatisfied with the SJC, we do not ap
prove of the tactics being employed by the Daily
to reach a post facto solution.
Nor would we veto the Senate's action, as the
Daily suggested.
Aside from the fact that a veto is only permissi
ble in the case of a bill (the ratification was a
resolution), a veto can only be imposed within 72
hours of passage, a matter for which we are some
340 days too late.
Such games merely make student politics look
more idiotic than usual and, in this case, call into
question the reputability of the Daily, whose
editorial board is not elected as representative of
the student body and whose word should not be
taken as law. At this point, we find it difficult to
believe in the impartiality of the Daily in cover
ing, or creating, an issue about which its senti
ments are blatant.
The final interpretation of the ASSU Constitu
tion rests with he ASSU Senate which has de
cided this issue at its meeting Tuesday night. The
already low reputation of student government
may rest on that decision.
(Lee Rosenbaum, Dave Galligan, Charlotte Ger
mane and Josie Jaramillo are the ASSU Council of
Presidents.)
