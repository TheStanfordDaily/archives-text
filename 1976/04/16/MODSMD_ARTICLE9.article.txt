Subbotin, Ma

In the flurry of the 1976 presi
dential campaign, various tac
tics are being employed by polit
ical organizations to earn the
recognition and support of
American voters for their candi
dates. Practices that are mislead
ing or deliberately deceptive
may be ignored in the shuffle of
names and ballots.
We wish to call public atten
tion to one such set of cir
cumstances that should not be
dismissed as acceptable political
procedure. The caucus for
nomination of the Democratic
National Convention delegates
from the 12th district in support
of Edmund G. Brown, Jr., April
1 1 at Mountain View High
School, was surrounded by prac
tices reflecting what we feel are
dubious ethics and questionable
values.
Stanford students for Brown
were organized two weeks ago to
"insure Stanford representa
tion" at the caucus. The leader of
the group, Steve Hefter,
suggested that eight volunteers
run as a slate on April 11 for
nomination as 12th district de
legates.
The slate was to consist of Hef
ter, Brad Krevoy, Ann Baskins,
Peter Boland, Robert Carcia,
Cary Bidder, Bill Price and Kyra
Subbotin. Hefter urged each
candidate on the slate to "en
courage a large turnout of Stan
ford students and a large vote
count for Stanford candidates for
delegates."
All recruited voters were

asked to vote for every member
of the slate. "Achieving these
goals." Hefter concluded, "will
assure Stanford's emergence as a
major power in determining the
district's winner in the June 8
primary."
At the April 11 caucus it
quickly became apparent that
the so-called "Stanford slate"
had been dissolved without the
prior notification or unanimous
consent of the original slate
members.
Three campaign flyers were
circulated; one advocated the
election of Hefter and Krevoy,
the second, Garcia and Bidder
and the third, Boland. There was
no mention of the Stanford slate
on either flyer, and Hefter urged
one member of the original slate
to disregard earlier plans to run
together.
We feel that the original objec
tive of Stanford representation
was by-passed in the quest for
personal recognition on the part
of Hefter. Krevoy, Garcia, Ridder
and Boland. We had recruited
voters on the understanding that
all solicited support would be
directed towards the slate as a
whole.
False pretenses
Therefore, we and the voters
we brought to the caucus came
under false pretenses. The votes
solicited at the caucus by
Hefter-Krevoy, Ridder-Garcia
and Boland were obviously not
intended for the original Stan
ford slate.
When questioned why Hefter

and he had not notified all slate
members of the change in plans,
Krevoy replied that it was the re
sponsibility of each candidate to
find out for himself. However, as
of a conversation with Hefter late
Friday evening, April 9, the plan
to run as a slate of eight was still
intact.
In addition, in the flyer he cir
culated before the caucus was
called to order, Hefter
identified himself as "Stanford
Daily, Editor." Misleading cre
dentials and shady political tac
tics such as these are indicative
of the political process that has
bred a new cynicism among
Americans, including many col
lege students. They were not li
mited to the Hefter-Krevoy cam
paign, but prevailed throughout
the caucus proceedings as well.
Affidavit required
Persons wanting to obtain bal
lots were first required to sign
what Robert Pierce, caucus di
rector, termed "an affidavit"
pledging his or her support to
Edmund G. Brown, Jr. for presi
dent of the United States.
Hefter stated on an earlier
handout, "Information for Stan
ford Students Attending Brown
Caucus," that the affidavit was
"not binding in any way." He
further noted that Stanford votes
at the caucus will "do nothing to
help Brown or encourage or dis
courage the candidacy's (sic) of
anyone else." It was stated by
one caucus official that although
the affidavit was a pledge, there
was no way anyone could be
held to it. an opinion which Hef
ter shared.
Is not an affidavit a legal and
moral commitment to uphold
the pledge stated therein? How
can we demand that our elected
representatives uphold their
commitments to their con
stituents if the very process by
which they are chosen involves
people making promises they
may not or do not intend to
keep?
We feel that compliance with
such practices, both on the part
of Stanford students and the
Santa Clara community, implies
condonation of such unprinci
pled actions. It is for this reason
that Kyra Subbotin felt compel
led to withdraw her name from
the ballot for Brown delegates.
We wish to impress upon the
Stanford community the gravity
of what was dismissed as "nor
mal political procedures," and
the larger implications such ac
tions have on the national level.

Cary Bidder, Bill Price and Kyra
Subbotin. Hefter urged each
candidate on the slate to "en
courage a large turnout of Stan
ford students and a large vote
count for Stanford candidates for
delegates."
All recruited voters were

asked to vote for every member
of the slate. "Achieving these
goals." Hefter concluded, "will
assure Stanford's emergence as a
major power in determining the
district's winner in the June 8
primary."
At the April 11 caucus it
quickly became apparent that
the so-called "Stanford slate"
had been dissolved without the
prior notification or unanimous
consent of the original slate
members.
Three campaign flyers were
circulated; one advocated the
election of Hefter and Krevoy,
the second, Garcia and Bidder
and the third, Boland. There was
no mention of the Stanford slate
on either flyer, and Hefter urged
one member of the original slate
to disregard earlier plans to run
together.
We feel that the original objec
tive of Stanford representation
was by-passed in the quest for
personal recognition on the part
of Hefter. Krevoy, Garcia, Ridder
and Boland. We had recruited
voters on the understanding that
all solicited support would be
directed towards the slate as a
whole.
False pretenses
Therefore, we and the voters
we brought to the caucus came
under false pretenses. The votes
solicited at the caucus by
Hefter-Krevoy, Ridder-Garcia
and Boland were obviously not
intended for the original Stan
ford slate.
When questioned why Hefter

and he had not notified all slate
members of the change in plans,
Krevoy replied that it was the re
sponsibility of each candidate to
find out for himself. However, as
of a conversation with Hefter late
Friday evening, April 9, the plan
to run as a slate of eight was still
intact.
In addition, in the flyer he cir
culated before the caucus was
called to order, Hefter
identified himself as "Stanford
Daily, Editor." Misleading cre
dentials and shady political tac
tics such as these are indicative
of the political process that has
bred a new cynicism among
Americans, including many col
lege students. They were not li
mited to the Hefter-Krevoy cam
paign, but prevailed throughout
the caucus proceedings as well.
Affidavit required
Persons wanting to obtain bal
lots were first required to sign
what Robert Pierce, caucus di
rector, termed "an affidavit"
pledging his or her support to
Edmund G. Brown, Jr. for presi
dent of the United States.
Hefter stated on an earlier
handout, "Information for Stan
ford Students Attending Brown
Caucus," that the affidavit was
"not binding in any way." He
further noted that Stanford votes
at the caucus will "do nothing to
help Brown or encourage or dis
courage the candidacy's (sic) of
anyone else." It was stated by
one caucus official that although
the affidavit was a pledge, there
was no way anyone could be
held to it. an opinion which Hef
ter shared.
Is not an affidavit a legal and
moral commitment to uphold
the pledge stated therein? How
can we demand that our elected
representatives uphold their
commitments to their con
stituents if the very process by
which they are chosen involves
people making promises they
may not or do not intend to
keep?
We feel that compliance with
such practices, both on the part
of Stanford students and the
Santa Clara community, implies
condonation of such unprinci
pled actions. It is for this reason
that Kyra Subbotin felt compel
led to withdraw her name from
the ballot for Brown delegates.
We wish to impress upon the
Stanford community the gravity
of what was dismissed as "nor
mal political procedures," and
the larger implications such ac
tions have on the national level.

In the flurry of the 1976 presi
dential campaign, various tac

ical organizations to earn the
recognition and support of
American voters for their candi
dates. Practices that are mislead
ing or deliberately deceptive
may be ignored in the shuffle of
names and ballots.
We wish to call public atten

procedure. The caucus for

National Convention delegates

dubious ethics and questionable

were organized two weeks ago to
"insure Stanford representa

the group, Steve Hefter,
suggested that eight volunteers
run as a slate on April 11 for

and Boland. We had recruited
voters on the understanding that
all solicited support would be
directed towards the slate as a
whole.
False pretenses
Therefore, we and the voters
we brought to the caucus came
under false pretenses. The votes
solicited at the caucus by
Hefter-Krevoy, Ridder-Garcia
and Boland were obviously not
intended for the original Stan
ford slate.
When questioned why Hefter

and he had not notified all slate
members of the change in plans,
Krevoy replied that it was the re
sponsibility of each candidate to
find out for himself. However, as
of a conversation with Hefter late
Friday evening, April 9, the plan
to run as a slate of eight was still
intact.
In addition, in the flyer he cir
culated before the caucus was
called to order, Hefter
identified himself as "Stanford
Daily, Editor." Misleading cre
dentials and shady political tac
tics such as these are indicative
of the political process that has
bred a new cynicism among
Americans, including many col
lege students. They were not li
mited to the Hefter-Krevoy cam
paign, but prevailed throughout
the caucus proceedings as well.
Affidavit required
Persons wanting to obtain bal
lots were first required to sign
what Robert Pierce, caucus di
rector, termed "an affidavit"
pledging his or her support to
Edmund G. Brown, Jr. for presi
dent of the United States.
Hefter stated on an earlier
handout, "Information for Stan
ford Students Attending Brown
Caucus," that the affidavit was
"not binding in any way." He
further noted that Stanford votes
at the caucus will "do nothing to
help Brown or encourage or dis
courage the candidacy's (sic) of
anyone else." It was stated by
one caucus official that although
the affidavit was a pledge, there
was no way anyone could be
held to it. an opinion which Hef
ter shared.
Is not an affidavit a legal and
moral commitment to uphold
the pledge stated therein? How
can we demand that our elected
representatives uphold their
commitments to their con
stituents if the very process by
which they are chosen involves
people making promises they
may not or do not intend to
keep?
We feel that compliance with
such practices, both on the part
of Stanford students and the
Santa Clara community, implies
condonation of such unprinci
pled actions. It is for this reason
that Kyra Subbotin felt compel
led to withdraw her name from
the ballot for Brown delegates.
We wish to impress upon the
Stanford community the gravity
of what was dismissed as "nor
mal political procedures," and
the larger implications such ac
tions have on the national level.

Subbotin, Ma

In the flurry of the 1976 presi
dential campaign, various tac
tics are being employed by polit
ical organizations to earn the
recognition and support of
American voters for their candi
dates. Practices that are mislead
ing or deliberately deceptive
may be ignored in the shuffle of
names and ballots.
We wish to call public atten
tion to one such set of cir
cumstances that should not be
dismissed as acceptable political
procedure. The caucus for
nomination of the Democratic
National Convention delegates
from the 12th district in support
of Edmund G. Brown, Jr., April
1 1 at Mountain View High
School, was surrounded by prac
tices reflecting what we feel are
dubious ethics and questionable
values.
Stanford students for Brown
were organized two weeks ago to
"insure Stanford representa
tion" at the caucus. The leader of
the group, Steve Hefter,
suggested that eight volunteers
run as a slate on April 11 for
nomination as 12th district de
legates.
The slate was to consist of Hef
ter, Brad Krevoy, Ann Baskins,
Peter Boland, Robert Carcia,
Cary Bidder, Bill Price and Kyra
Subbotin. Hefter urged each
candidate on the slate to "en
courage a large turnout of Stan
ford students and a large vote
count for Stanford candidates for
delegates."
All recruited voters were

asked to vote for every member
of the slate. "Achieving these
goals." Hefter concluded, "will
assure Stanford's emergence as a
major power in determining the
district's winner in the June 8
primary."
At the April 11 caucus it
quickly became apparent that
the so-called "Stanford slate"
had been dissolved without the
prior notification or unanimous
consent of the original slate
members.
Three campaign flyers were
circulated; one advocated the
election of Hefter and Krevoy,
the second, Garcia and Bidder
and the third, Boland. There was
no mention of the Stanford slate
on either flyer, and Hefter urged
one member of the original slate
to disregard earlier plans to run
together.
We feel that the original objec
tive of Stanford representation
was by-passed in the quest for
personal recognition on the part
of Hefter. Krevoy, Garcia, Ridder
and Boland. We had recruited
voters on the understanding that
all solicited support would be
directed towards the slate as a
whole.
