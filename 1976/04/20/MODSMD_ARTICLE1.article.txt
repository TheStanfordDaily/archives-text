# Libraries revise policy
## 
### Kim Hatamiya 
The University libraries are cur
rently implementing a new policy re
garding materials previously shelved
in the security are of the library system
known as the "Locked Stack."
The Academic Council Committee
on Libraries (C-Lib) adopted a revision
of the old policy on April 9 based on a
report of recommendations made by
the Task Force on the Locked Stack, a
committee appointed hy Dale Canelas,
assistant director of public services for
the University libraries.
The task force's recommendations
were made in March in a report which
researched the history and develop
ment of the locked stack and investi
gated the problems of missing and
mutilated books.
The April report's new rules forbid the
arbitrary placement of books with
catalog numbers indicating they con
tain "sensitive subject matter" into the
locked stacks.
Okay for lock-up
The following kinds of books may be
placed in the locked stack:
—books which have been repeatedly
lost or mutiliated;
—"tiny" books, six inches or less in
height;
—"elephant" folios more than 25
inches in length, height or width
which cannot be adequately shelved
for physical reasons on the regular
open stacks: and
— valuable or extremely old books
with leatherorvellum bindingsorbrit
tle pages.
The task force recommended that
"no categories or subjects be assigned
en bloc to the Locked Stack" and that
"each book placed in the Locked Stack
be so assigned according to the criteria
developed by the committee."
Open shelves
The new policy adopted by the
C-Lib suggests that "the Library main
tain as many of their collections as
possible on open shelves to provide

maximum access to faculty and stu
dents while at the same time attempt
ing to maintain adequate security."
The C-Lib, headed by Religious
Studies Department Chairman Wil
liam Clebsch, requested the investiga
tion into the old locked stacks policy
and its subsequent revision in re
sponse to letters to Clebsch and Direc
tor of University Libraries David
Weber by Richard Thomas, commun
ity relations officer for the Stanford
Gay Peoples' Union.
After finding books dealing with
homosexuality in the locked stacks,
Thomas objected to the "inexcusable
barrier to information" in the Sept. 4
letter to Weber.
In a Sept. 29 letter published in the
Daily, Thomas charged that the locked
stack policy was not "some
generalized discriminatory policy of
limiting access to books on civil rights
movements, but rather limited to
books dealing with gay power and gay
civil rights."
'Pleased'
When informed by the Daily of the
new policy, Thomas commented, "I
am pleased that at least one segment of
the University structure has re
sponded to the concerns of gay stu
dents both humanely and with sen
sitivity."
Kathryn Ma, student representative

to C-Lib, said, "This is a real break
through for the University to take such
a conscientious, liberal stand."
"The new procedure is better spel
led out and much more equitable,"
Canelas remarked.
"The purpose of the new policy is to
provide maximum protection and to
make all books as accessible as possi
ble to faculty and students," she ad
ded.
Books with high theft probability
will continue to be placed under
locked stacks, according to Canelas.
Disappearing books
During a period from about 1969-
1973, said Canelas, "books on de
monology and witchcraft were con
stantly disappearing."
During periods of varying student
interests, it was noted that books on
drugs and explosives were also mis
sing, she added.
"However, books stolen at one time
may not be stolen again." Canelas
commented.
Because of shifts in book theft em
phasis, the new locked stack policy re
quires that "specific acquisition and
selection guides be reviewed and up
dated."
"The chief of the circulation de
partment and the assistant director of
collection development will review
the contents of the Locked Stack every
year," said Canelas.
