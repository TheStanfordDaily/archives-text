# Libraries revise policy
## 
### Kim Hatamiya 
The University libraries are cur
rently implementing a new policy re
garding materials previously shelved
in the security are of the library system
known as the "Locked Stack."
The Academic Council Committee
on Libraries (C-Lib) adopted a revision
of the old policy on April 9 based on a
report of recommendations made by
the Task Force on the Locked Stack, a
committee appointed hy Dale Canelas,
assistant director of public services for
the University libraries.
The task force's recommendations
were made in March in a report which
researched the history and develop
ment of the locked stack and investi
gated the problems of missing and
mutilated books.
The April report's new rules forbid the
arbitrary placement of books with
catalog numbers indicating they con
tain "sensitive subject matter" into the
locked stacks.
Okay for lock-up
The following kinds of books may be
placed in the locked stack:
—books which have been repeatedly
lost or mutiliated;
—"tiny" books, six inches or less in
height;
—"elephant" folios more than 25
inches in length, height or width
which cannot be adequately shelved
for physical reasons on the regular
open stacks: and
— valuable or extremely old books
with leatherorvellum bindingsorbrit
tle pages.
The task force recommended that
"no categories or subjects be assigned
en bloc to the Locked Stack" and that
"each book placed in the Locked Stack
be so assigned according to the criteria
developed by the committee."
Open shelves
The new policy adopted by the
C-Lib suggests that "the Library main
tain as many of their collections as
possible on open shelves to provide
