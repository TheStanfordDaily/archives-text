Throughout this campaign,
there has been surprisingly litle
discussion of the most important
issues. We believe that students
deserve to know where the can
didates stand.
In ail the campaign material
presented to date, our opponents
have failed to address many
major areas of student concern:
student participation in the te
nure process, the concerns of
women students, reform of the
ASSU Senate structure and the
concerns of the graduate stu
dents. We would like to address
these points.
Tenure: We will determine
which professors are coming up
for reviews before tenure deci
sions are made by departments.
By publicizing and distributing
this information through
undergraduate departmental

associations, we will encourage
these students to mobilize sup
port for those faculty members
deserving tenure both for their
research and teaching abilities.
Women's issues: We will re
establish the dormant Women's
Coordinating Committee, and
we will provide it with central
campus office space in the ASSU
office. We will also coordinate
all campus efforts for child-care
services student parents can af
ford and, as a matter of high
priority, we will work for the
presence of a fulltime woman
staff member in the Office of
Student Activities.
Semite reform: Reformation of
the structure of the ASSU Senate
is a necessity. We see several
possibilities for change (such as
those we have placed in resi
dences on campus), yet we re
main open to suggestions. We

are committed to initiating
meaningful changes as well as
continuing a process of serious
evaluation.
Graduate student issues: We
have proposed specific reform to
the graduate financial aid crisis
and shall undertake the prepara
tion of a teacher's assistant
handbook containing informa
tion regarding proven teaching
methods every successful
educator should know. We will
also work to allow student
spouses to take courses on a per
unit credit basis at Stanford.
These are practical proposals,
relevant to the major issues fac
ing Stanford students. Our op
ponents have failed to address
any of these issues.
