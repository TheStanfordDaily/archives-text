Howard follow-up
I would like to respond to the Daily's allega
tions that the Howard Report was never followed
up, and to Assoc. Prof, of English William Chace's
letter in the April 16 issue of the Daily. In fact, the
Howard Report was widely circulated among the
top administrators in the University and was
studied by every member of the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid
(CUAFA).
There can be no empirical proof, of course, of a
causal connnection between the Howard Report
and the change in transfer student status and the
creation of a new subcommittee. However, as a
member of CUAFA. I feel that the Howard Report
stimulated discussion and decisions within the
committee on these matters.
The following are two examples of its influ
' ence:
—Prof. Ewart Thomas, in a memo to the com
mittee dated Dec. 19. 1975, suggested further dis
cussion on recruitment and financial aid recom
mendations made in the Howard Report.
—Prof. Rina Benmayor, in a memo to the com
mittee dated Jan. 15. 1976, suggested specifically
that CUAFA consider items in the Howard Report
concerning admissions, recruitment and finan
cial aid policies.
There seems to he a lack of agreement within
CUAFA as to the charge of the subcommittee
formed at our last meeting. The small number of
very low income students in the freshman class
(90/1500), along with discussion in the committee
illustrated the need for further research into the
University's method of attracting and admitting
certain groups of students.
After much discussion concerning the constant
need for reevaluating admission criteria, the mo
tion to form a subcommittee was approved by
CUAFA. 1 felt that the charge of the subcommittee
was to develop alternative criteria for the admis
sion of a small group of students who did not meet
all of the standard criteria.
The compilation of a socio-economic profile of
this year's class wovdd only be a part of that pro
cess.
The Howard Report was informative and useful
to the committee. It provoked discussion and
suggested altenatives.

Student input, if it is to be effective, should be
well-informed and constructive. The Howard Re
port displayed those merits.
While I do not necessarily agree with all the
conclusions and recommendations of the Howard
Report, it cannot be denied that it certainly fi
gured in the deliberations of the committee this
year.

Spitz is indeed a great booster of the humanities
and a great humanist himself. If he doesn't see a
problem in the humanities at Stanford, we're in
deep trouble.
Incidentally, did anyone notice who got the
Cuggenheims this year? Of the 18 here, 15 were in
the sciences or social sciences. Surprise!
Here are some more facts. Former Cerman Prof.
Walter Sokel told me he gets scarcely more at
Virginia than he gets here, not at all an "astronom
ical salary." price Spitz. My proposed university
professorships were not supposed to cover "12
humanities and sciences departments" but just
the humanities, so they'd go far.
Besides, it is a matter of quality, mostly. If the
Cerman Department is in such great shape, why is
one of its most prominent members threatening to
leave because it is in such wobbly condition?
Harvard is "worried?" It can afford to be: it has
at least been there ....
A final blow: For years History Prof. Gordon
Wright and I tried to entice perhaps the most
distinguished man in the field of French. Roger
Shattuck. Guess where he ended up: as Com
monwealth Professor at the University of Vir
ginia. just like Sokel.
If the importation of top people lowers the
morale of the present people, we are worse off
than I thought. And if calling a plague a plague,
Camus-style, is dispiriting, a plague is eventually
far more dispiriting.

Howard follow-up
I would like to respond to the Daily's allega
tions that the Howard Report was never followed
up, and to Assoc. Prof, of English William Chace's
letter in the April 16 issue of the Daily. In fact, the
Howard Report was widely circulated among the
top administrators in the University and was
studied by every member of the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid
(CUAFA).
There can be no empirical proof, of course, of a
causal connnection between the Howard Report
and the change in transfer student status and the
creation of a new subcommittee. However, as a
member of CUAFA. I feel that the Howard Report
stimulated discussion and decisions within the
committee on these matters.
The following are two examples of its influ
' ence:
—Prof. Ewart Thomas, in a memo to the com
mittee dated Dec. 19. 1975, suggested further dis
cussion on recruitment and financial aid recom
mendations made in the Howard Report.
—Prof. Rina Benmayor, in a memo to the com
mittee dated Jan. 15. 1976, suggested specifically
that CUAFA consider items in the Howard Report
concerning admissions, recruitment and finan
cial aid policies.
There seems to he a lack of agreement within
CUAFA as to the charge of the subcommittee
formed at our last meeting. The small number of
very low income students in the freshman class
(90/1500), along with discussion in the committee
illustrated the need for further research into the
University's method of attracting and admitting
certain groups of students.
After much discussion concerning the constant
need for reevaluating admission criteria, the mo
tion to form a subcommittee was approved by
CUAFA. 1 felt that the charge of the subcommittee
was to develop alternative criteria for the admis
sion of a small group of students who did not meet
all of the standard criteria.
The compilation of a socio-economic profile of
this year's class wovdd only be a part of that pro
cess.
The Howard Report was informative and useful
to the committee. It provoked discussion and
suggested altenatives.

Student input, if it is to be effective, should be
well-informed and constructive. The Howard Re
port displayed those merits.
While I do not necessarily agree with all the
conclusions and recommendations of the Howard
Report, it cannot be denied that it certainly fi
gured in the deliberations of the committee this
year.

Spitz is indeed a great booster of the humanities
and a great humanist himself. If he doesn't see a
problem in the humanities at Stanford, we're in
deep trouble.
Incidentally, did anyone notice who got the
Cuggenheims this year? Of the 18 here, 15 were in
the sciences or social sciences. Surprise!
Here are some more facts. Former Cerman Prof.
Walter Sokel told me he gets scarcely more at
Virginia than he gets here, not at all an "astronom
ical salary." price Spitz. My proposed university
professorships were not supposed to cover "12
humanities and sciences departments" but just
the humanities, so they'd go far.
Besides, it is a matter of quality, mostly. If the
Cerman Department is in such great shape, why is
one of its most prominent members threatening to
leave because it is in such wobbly condition?
Harvard is "worried?" It can afford to be: it has
at least been there ....
A final blow: For years History Prof. Gordon
Wright and I tried to entice perhaps the most
distinguished man in the field of French. Roger
Shattuck. Guess where he ended up: as Com
monwealth Professor at the University of Vir
ginia. just like Sokel.
If the importation of top people lowers the
morale of the present people, we are worse off
than I thought. And if calling a plague a plague,
Camus-style, is dispiriting, a plague is eventually
far more dispiriting.
