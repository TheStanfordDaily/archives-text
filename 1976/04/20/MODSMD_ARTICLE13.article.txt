# Apathy for student politics justified
## 
### 
Wednesday and Thursday balloting will
be underway in the runoff for the Council of
Presidents (COP). Big deal.
This year's offering of campus junior
politicos might easily be mistaken by the
casual observer- for the same puttery of
former campaigns — the faces are different,
the platforms largely are not. In fact, if one
isn't aware he is reading a campaign poster
from the current election, he might feel as if
he were taking a stroll through memory
lane.
Both of the remaining slates offer nebul
ous promises, usually devoid of the merest
hint of how such changes are to be im
plemented; each is replete with descrip
tions of grandiose improvements it plans to
make for the good of Stanford and blah ... .
blah . . . blah. . . . Yet, when it comes to act
ing, the winner undoubtedly will retire to
the ASSU loft and vegetate for a year, the
way of the present and most past COPs.
Possible improvement
And some people question why students
are apathetic about student government.
They argue that, true, student govern
ment has been ineffective the last few years,
but only through student interest in gov
ernment is there even a possibility for im
provement. While such contentions may be
valid, one can only make an effort for so
long before becoming discouraged with the
joke we call student government — and
most students reached that point years ago.
For the average Stanford student, it sim
ply is not worth his time to read the übiquit
ous literature disseminated by aspiring Big
Men on Campus. Indeed, the Dan Howard
slate's plaform this year runs to something
like 40 pages.
To acquaint oneself with so much infor
mation is time consuming, not to mention
tedious. This especially holds true when
one considers that few of the proposals of
the average COP slate may have a direct
bearing on any student.
Sure, he could become concerned with
what the campus committee on hospital bed
appropriations is doing — and he could be
come incensed over the horrible treatment
such-and-such group is receiving at the

hands of such-and-such. But few have the
time or inclination to concern themselves
with such largely peripheral issues.
Momentous changes
But wait, one might say. Didn't this year's
COP accomplish a few momentous
changes?

That all depends on what one considers
"momentous." True, the ASSU did succeed
in reallocating its office space (it must feel
great to be able to make such top-level deci
sions) and one occasionally sees the COP
members strutting around filled with their
aura of self-importance. After all, they're the
representatives of. . . well. . . almost a fifth
of the student body, and even if they don't
succeed in mediating too many grave is
sues, they're still pretty damn important.
In the slates of Howard, et al. and Vic
Petroff, et al., the two remaining candidates
for student body muckety mucks, prospects
for a deviation from past years' performance
don't appear much improved.
Howard, the ringleader of a slate com
posed of just the right blend of token every
things, authored the poorly received (un
less one lives in Columbae House) "Howard
Report" on admissions and financial aids.
Although Howard and the others involved
in writing the report obviously spent con
siderable time on it, the report's conclu
sions showed gross ignorance of many im
portant issues; the conclusions rested on
premises that were tenuous, at best.
Little effect
And although undoubtedly the report
spurred people into thinking about admis
sions and financial aid (as does any report),
Assoc. English Prof. Willilam Chace, head

of the Committee on Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aids (CUAFA) stated in
the April 16 Daily that the report had little
effect on the committee's final decisions.
While one must take Chace's negative let
ter with a grain of salt (remember that Chace
bitterly criticized the report when it origi
nally came out), a look at the changes insti
tuted since the report seem to bear out
Chace's contentions.
Regarding the Howard slate's proposals,
they are vague and present little new. What
group doesn't want to increase student in
volvement, and student influence over te
nure, as does the Howard slate?
And, as even the Daily noted in its en
dorsement of the Howard slate,theslate "of
ten doesn't quite know how to (implement
its proposals)."
Realizes absurdity
At least the Vic Petroff slate realizes the
absurdity of present student government
and pressses for structural changes. Pet
roff's proposals are more concrete and more
realistic than those of Howard.
However, several of last year's senators
indicate that Petroff was one of the most
uninterested participants in student poli
tics, oftentimes skipping as many senate
meetings as the rules allowed. Similarly
negative criticism has been directed at other
members of his slate.
One must wonder whether such indi
viduals have the drive to accomplish even
the modest changes they advocate.
With two such lackluster slates, one can't
help but be disillusioned.
As sophomore Duncan Scott (himself a
Senior Class president in high school) put
it:"I used to think that student government
here could accomplish a lot — I even voted
for a 'serious' slate last year. But then 1
grew up.
"Student government should be realfstijc.
It can't accomplish everything — that's why
I voted for the Hammer and Coffin slate this
year. At least their actions would befunhyl"
