# Complete evidence proves SJC legal
##

The controversy over the Stan
ford Judicial Council (SJC) is un
fortunate and mainly because it
will soon resolve itself into
being no controversy at all when
the flying dust that is clouding
everyone's view has settled.
There are four reasons why we
have a controversy.
First, many students are not in
full possession of all the facts.
They are basically aware only of
Section IV of the ASSU Constitu
tion, the section requiring a
two-thirds referendum among
the students.
However, when they have all
the relevant facts, which are de
scribed later in this article, they
will be able to judge more accu
rately.
Second, the Daily has felt
compelled to defend its April 12
article. Thus it has desperately
rounded up all possible evi
dence seeming to support its
side while ignoring the crucial
evidence that makes or breaks
the case.
I feel fairly certain that the
Daily, when no longer under the
pressure to defend itself, will be
able to recognize the situation as
it truly exists.
Third, many students are in
fact eager to have the SJC il
legitimate and unfortunately, in
their eagerness, they jump too
quickly for partial evidence that
seems to support their desires.
Whether or not these people
change their minds depends in
large measure on whether they
can develop the intellectual
honesty that admits that what
they desire is not always logi
cally or legally true.
Finally, many students have a
great difficulty distinguishing
between moral and legal issues.
They reason that since the ASSU
senate ought to have asked for a
two-thirds referendum, it was
legally bound to obtain it. This
does not follow.
There are many situations
where people feel morally

bound to an action but are not
legally compelled. When people
are able to make this distinction,
then they will be able to accept
the proposition that, although
the senate's may have been
wrong, it was not illegal.
Now, what are the relevant
facts? They are not quotes from
long past ASSU officials and
constitution drafters, nor are
they so-called precedents from
years ago.
The above items are not relev
ant simply because they have no
legal force against the black
and-white statutory law that is
quite clear in this case.
The first relevant fact is Sec
tion IV of the ASSU Constitu
tion, which requires a two-thirds
referendum of the students to
approve a judicial system. Un
fortunately, too many students
stopped here.
The second relevant fact is
Clause 5 of the Letters of Accep
tance of the Constitution, which
declares that the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968 has met
the two-thirds requirement of
Section IV of the Constitution
and is thus valid.
The third relevant fact is Arti
cle 111 of the charter which
specifies that the student senate
may approve amendments to the
charter submitted by the Com
mittee of 15 (C-15). Article 111 is
valid like the rest of the charter
since the whole charter was ap
proved by a two-thirds referen
dum of the students.
The fourth relevant fact is the
act of the C-15 in spring 1975
proposing amendments to the
charter, pursuant to the proce
dure specified in Article 111 of the
charter. The fifth relevant fact is
the referendum and the senate
passage of Resolution 23-74 in
spring 1975.
Together these indicate,
beyond any doubt, that the se
nate did approve the charter
amendments as submitted by the
C-15. These facts string together

in a chain that leads to a virtually
inescapable conclusion (nearly a
syllogism) that the action of the
senate last spring in approving
amendments to the charter was
legitimate.
The two main counter argu
ments have asserted either that
although the charter may once
have been valid, it no longer is,
or although the charter is valid,
the amending power contained
in Article 111 is not valid.
In case one, it is usually as
serted that when President
Richard Lyman in 1971 formed
the Campus Judicial Panel (CJP)
he abrogated the charter. But
that is not the case at all as Ly
man's documents in November
1971 make clear.
In fact he was using the charter
to form the CJP.
In case two, it has to be recog

ni/.ed that the Letters of Accep
tance make no qualification
about the validity of the charter.
They do not say that the charter
was valid except for Article 111,
the amending section.
So now this brings us to the
two Daily articles of April 12,
April 13. The Daily walked into
fact one, Section IV of the Con
stitution. and thought it had a
great scoop.
I would have thought so too if
that was the only fact I had.
Frankly, I feel sure the Daily
porters were not fully aware of
Clause 5 of the Letters of Accep
tance and Article 111 of the char
ter, for if they had been, they
would not have published their
first article.
