I have been using contraceptive foam regularly for six months and
am wondering where it goes. 1 am worried that the chemical is
lining absorbed into my body and may cause harmful side effects. If
I I it* foam is bad for me, I would like to switch to the diaphragm. My
boyfriend uses the condom at the same time.
According to the Peer Counseling service, the foam "just dribbles
out with the sperm." Any that happens to get into the uterus will
come out with the next menstruation. There are no known side
effects with the foam/condom combination, which is about 97
percent effective in preventing pregnancy, second only to the pill.
By the way, a diaphragm alone is not as safe as your present
method of birth control.

A woman 1 know maintains that it is possible for a woman to have
sex with two or even, I suppose, three men during her fertile period
and then nine months later produce two, or even three, babies
correlating with those two to three fathers. Is this possible?
Once again, 1 turn to Katchadourian and Lunde's Human Sexual
ity, which has helped me out with so very many unusual questions.
"It is apparently biologically possible for twins to have different
fathers. This phenomenon is called superfecundation and has been
.clearly documented in animal studies. Another bizarre occurrence
is superfetation, the fertilization and subsequent development of
an egg when a fetus is already present in the uterus. There are a few
such cases reported in the medical literature. In one instance, a
woman gave birth to two normal children three months apart."
