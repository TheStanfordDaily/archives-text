# India, Bangladesh dispute use of Ganges
## 
### 
BANGKOK (PNS) — India and
Bangladesh, once allies in
Bangladesh's bloody war of in
dependence, are now bitterly
feuding over their rights to the
subcontinent's principle life
support system — the precious
waters of the Ganges River.
The "river war," in turn, has
heightened big power tensions
on the subcontinent bet
ween the two country's respec
tive allies — the Soviet Union
and China.
The new controversy centers
on India's huge $190 million
Farakka Barrage, a water diver
sion facility near the Bangladesh
border designed to re-direct
much of the Ganges' waters into
India's Hooghly river, and from
there south to the Calcutta har
bor.
India claims the diversion is
critical to flush out a build-up of
silt in the river and Calcutta's
harbor that now threatens the ci
ty's very existence as an interna
tional port.
Confiding need
But Bangladesh desperately
needs the same water for irriga
tion, navigation on its many in
land waterways and industrial
use. Officials in Dacca say the
Ganges' decreasing water levels
during the dry season have al
ready undercut irrigation and
shipping and increased water sa
linity — hurting both fishing
and agriculture.
Fueling the debate, China —
which recently established full
diplomatic relations with
Bangladesh — blasted India for

"inflicting a new disaster on
Bangladesh" as a result of the
diversion project. Peking further
accused the Soviet Union — In
dia's long-time ally — of having
instigated the project to further
Bangladesh's downfall.
Construction of the barrage
began five years ago, when
Bangladesh was still part of
Pakistan. But its operation was
held up until last spring because
of objections from Bangladesh.
Under an interim arrangement
worked out last year, India began
to withdraw a limited amount of
water in April 1975, while a
long-term agreement was left for
future negotiations.
But Bangladesh now claims
that India expanded its with
drawals last summer, and is pre
sently diverting 40,000 cubic
feet of water per second — with
out Dacca's approval. India has
not denied that charge.
Demands
Before negotiations can begin,
Bangladesh insists that
India stop diverting water from
the Ganges altogether.
"It is clear," said a spokesman
in Dacca, "that a treaty provid
ing for mutually acceptable allo
cation of the Ganges waters is
imperative before any water can
be withdrawn at Farakka."
New Delhi calls these condi
tions totally unacceptable.
Officials there vigorously
deny that Bangladesh has suf
fered ill effects from the diver
sion project, pointing out Dac
ca's failure to present factual

data to support its claims — and
charge that much of the Ganges
already flows wastefully
through Bangladesh into the sea.
Finally, India blames
Bangladesh for violating an ear
lier understanding between the
two countries to discourage hos
tile propaganda.
These angry exchanges have
come after several months of
rapidly deteriorating relations
between the two countries.
Undermining?
Many persons in Bangladesh
suspect that India was behind a
November 3,1975 coup d'etat in
Dacca that briefly brought a pro-
Indian group of generals to
power. A counter-coup by the
country's present regime
quickly ousted them.
Shortly afterwards, India's
ambassador in Bangladesh was
shot and wounded in an abortive

kidnaping attempt, increasing
Indian hostility to the new Dacca
government.
In the ensuing months, Ben
gali guerrilla bands have re
peatedly carried out border raids
from India into northern
Bangladesh. Bangladesh has ac
cused India of both financing
and arming the attackers.
In its latest attack on India,
China repeated these charges —

ascribing India's motives to Dac
ca's rapidly improving relations
with India's major antagonists,
Pakistan and China.
The Chinese statements, while
harsh, fall far short of being an
active threat to intervene should
hostilities break out. But if there
is trouble because of Farakka, the
possibility that China would
supply Dacca against Soviet
backed India cannot now be
ruled out.

New Delhi calls these condi

Officials there vigorously
deny that Bangladesh has suf
fered ill effects from the diver
sion project, pointing out Dac
ca's failure to present factual

data to support its claims — and
charge that much of the Ganges
already flows wastefully
through Bangladesh into the sea.
Finally, India blames
Bangladesh for violating an ear
lier understanding between the
two countries to discourage hos
tile propaganda.
These angry exchanges have
come after several months of
rapidly deteriorating relations
between the two countries.
Undermining?
Many persons in Bangladesh
suspect that India was behind a
November 3,1975 coup d'etat in
Dacca that briefly brought a pro-
Indian group of generals to
power. A counter-coup by the
country's present regime
quickly ousted them.
Shortly afterwards, India's
ambassador in Bangladesh was
shot and wounded in an abortive

kidnaping attempt, increasing
Indian hostility to the new Dacca
government.
In the ensuing months, Ben
gali guerrilla bands have re
peatedly carried out border raids
from India into northern
Bangladesh. Bangladesh has ac
cused India of both financing
and arming the attackers.
In its latest attack on India,
China repeated these charges —

ascribing India's motives to Dac
ca's rapidly improving relations
with India's major antagonists,
Pakistan and China.
The Chinese statements, while
harsh, fall far short of being an
active threat to intervene should
hostilities break out. But if there
is trouble because of Farakka, the
possibility that China would
supply Dacca against Soviet
backed India cannot now be
ruled out.

BANGKOK (PNS) — India and
Bangladesh, once allies in
Bangladesh's bloody war of in
dependence, are now bitterly
feuding over their rights to the
subcontinent's principle life
support system — the precious
waters of the Ganges River.
The "river war," in turn, has
heightened big power tensions
on the subcontinent bet
ween the two country's respec
tive allies — the Soviet Union
and China.
The new controversy centers
on India's huge $190 million
Farakka Barrage, a water diver
sion facility near the Bangladesh
border designed to re-direct
much of the Ganges' waters into
India's Hooghly river, and from
there south to the Calcutta har
bor.
India claims the diversion is
critical to flush out a build-up of
silt in the river and Calcutta's
harbor that now threatens the ci
ty's very existence as an interna
tional port.
Confiding need
But Bangladesh desperately
needs the same water for irriga
tion, navigation on its many in
land waterways and industrial
use. Officials in Dacca say the
Ganges' decreasing water levels
during the dry season have al
ready undercut irrigation and
shipping and increased water sa
linity — hurting both fishing
and agriculture.
Fueling the debate, China —
which recently established full
diplomatic relations with
Bangladesh — blasted India for

"inflicting a new disaster on
Bangladesh" as a result of the
diversion project. Peking further
accused the Soviet Union — In
dia's long-time ally — of having
instigated the project to further
Bangladesh's downfall.
Construction of the barrage
began five years ago, when
Bangladesh was still part of
Pakistan. But its operation was
held up until last spring because
of objections from Bangladesh.
Under an interim arrangement
worked out last year, India began
to withdraw a limited amount of
water in April 1975, while a
long-term agreement was left for
future negotiations.
But Bangladesh now claims
that India expanded its with
drawals last summer, and is pre
sently diverting 40,000 cubic
feet of water per second — with
out Dacca's approval. India has
not denied that charge.
Demands
Before negotiations can begin,
Bangladesh insists that
India stop diverting water from
the Ganges altogether.
"It is clear," said a spokesman
in Dacca, "that a treaty provid
ing for mutually acceptable allo
cation of the Ganges waters is
imperative before any water can
be withdrawn at Farakka."
New Delhi calls these condi
tions totally unacceptable.
