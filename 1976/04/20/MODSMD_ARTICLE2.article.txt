# Soliah prosecutors discredit Hearst

### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) — A pro
secutor said yesterday that authorities
here did not believe Patricia Hearst's
secret revelations about a bank robbery
in which her former lover, Steven Sol
iah, is charged.
"There is rational reason for disbe
lieving a woman who wants to lookout
for her boyfriend, and that's what it
comes down to." said Asst. U.S. Atty.
Richard Nichols.
Nichols made the statements chal
lenging Hearst's credibility in a hear
ing to decide whether authorities who
questioned the convicted heiress
should be called to testify about what
she told them during closed-door
meetings.
Outside
Soliah's chief defense attorney,
Sheldon Otis, said he could call wit
nesses, including FBI agents and fed
eral prosecutors, to prove that Hearst
confided to authorities that Soliah was
outside — not inside — the bank he is
accused of robbing.
Soliah is accused of taking part in
the robbery of a branch of the Crocker

National Bank in suburban Carmichael
last April 21, in which a woman bank
customer was killed.
Otis said U.S. Atty. Dwayne Keyes
chose not to believe Hearst and called
to the stand eyewitnesses whose tes
timony he knew was mistaken.
"On the basis of Hearst's informa
tion, prosecutions are pending in
Marin County, in Alameda County and
in the county of Sacramento," said
Otis.
Immunity
"Miss Hearst has been promised and
will receive immunity from prosecu
tion." he added.
Superior Court Judge Philip Wil
kins, indicating he might order the
prosecutors to testify, postponed his
decision until today.
He asked both sides for recommen
dations on whether such a hearing
should be public or held secretly in the
judge's chambers.
The government favored a secret
session while the defense suggested it
be held in open court.
