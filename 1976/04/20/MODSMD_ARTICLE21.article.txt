SACRAMENTO (AF) â€” U.S.
Senate hopeful Tom I lavden said
last Thursday the "corporate
connections" of his primary
election rival, Sen. John Tunney,
"cripple him as a tax reformer."
Hayden, the onetime Chicago
Seven defendant opposing Tun
ney in the June H Democratic
primary, told reporters 85 per
cent of Tunney's contributions
come from big business.
Tunney's financial backers,
Hayden said, include the presi
dent and five senior officers of
Atlantic Richfield Co., a lobbyist
for Gulf Oil Co., and members of

law firms representing Southern
Pacific, Standard Oil and Union
Oil.
Hayden said Tunney hasn't
lived up to his 1970 campaign
promise to fight for tax refom.
"If he fought for tax justice, he
could not finance his reelection
campaign, since he is dependent
on the very corporations which
benfit from tax loopholes,"
Hayden said.
A Tunney aide, JohnFlink,
said he didrit know whether
Hayderi s list of Tunney's con
tributors was accurate.
