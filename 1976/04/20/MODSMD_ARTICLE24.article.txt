# Brown may yield on farm labor issue
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Gov. Edmund
Brown Jr. said yesterday he is willing to
compromise to win funds for his farm labor
board, but that compromise must not be bet
rayal of secret ballot elections.
Brown said again he is confident he can
break the funding deadlock in the legisla
ture that has incapacitated the board since
Eeb. 6. But for the first time he talked about a
struggle that could last years.
"Some people have said. "Why don't you
compromise?" Well, 1 think compromise is
fine, but betrayal is not right. And if it takes
one year or 10 years, we're going to have a
farm labor law that protects farm workers,"
Brown told a conference on farm worker
housing.
Asked later by reporters if the reference to
years meant he is discouraged about reac
tivating the board this year, Brown replied
indirectly.
No 'betrayal'
K I think we can get it faster, but I'm not
about to betray the cause of secret ballot
elections for a short-term gain," he said.
The Democratic governor also said he is

interviewing prospective appointees for the
three vacancies on the five-member board
created last year to supervise secret ballot
elections for farm workers.
But, Brown said, "It's awfully hard to get
someone to take a job when there's no
payclieck. There are not too many takers for
a nonpaying job."
Earlier yesterday, Sen. David Roberti
(D-Los Angeles), the Senate floor manager
of the $2.5 million appropriation bill for the
farm labor board, said he has about 24 of the
27 votes needed for final passage of the
funding bill.
Momentum?
Roberti, the Democratic floor leader in the
Senate, said Brown's appointments to the
board "could bring some momentum" and
break the deadlock over the board.
He said he would take a floor vote "as
soon as 1 have a close chance at 27 votes,"
but that he didn't know if it would be at
Thursday's Senate floor session.
Legislators who agree with grower
charges that the board is biased in favor of

Cesar Chavez' United Earm Workers union
have blocked funds for the board unless a
series of amendments are approved.
Brown did not make specific reference to
those amendments in his appearance before
the farm worker housing conference. But he
gave the clear impression that those
amendments, which he has rejected in the
past, were what he was talking about.
'Long road'
"I recognize it's easy to sell out. But if you
take the long road, which is the right road,
it's a (lot) better," he said.
"It took a long time to get it back. But let's
have something we can be proud of, and not
a watered down meaningless charade that's
not going to help anybody."
News of a pending third vacancy on the
board occurred yesterday when Joseph
Grodin, a former San Erancisco law profes
sor, announced his resignation, effective
April 30.
Board member Leroy Chatfield quit to work
on Brown's presidential campaign recently,
and board member Joseph Ortega resigned
when he was arrested on a morals charge.

struggle that could last years.
"Some people have said. "Why don't you
compromise?" Well, 1 think compromise is
fine, but betrayal is not right. And if it takes
one year or 10 years, we're going to have a
farm labor law that protects farm workers,"
Brown told a conference on farm worker
housing.
Asked later by reporters if the reference to
years meant he is discouraged about reac
tivating the board this year, Brown replied
indirectly.
No 'betrayal'
K I think we can get it faster, but I'm not
about to betray the cause of secret ballot
elections for a short-term gain," he said.
The Democratic governor also said he is

interviewing prospective appointees for the
three vacancies on the five-member board
created last year to supervise secret ballot
elections for farm workers.
But, Brown said, "It's awfully hard to get
someone to take a job when there's no
payclieck. There are not too many takers for
a nonpaying job."
Earlier yesterday, Sen. David Roberti
(D-Los Angeles), the Senate floor manager
of the $2.5 million appropriation bill for the
farm labor board, said he has about 24 of the
27 votes needed for final passage of the
funding bill.
Momentum?
Roberti, the Democratic floor leader in the
Senate, said Brown's appointments to the
board "could bring some momentum" and
break the deadlock over the board.
He said he would take a floor vote "as
soon as 1 have a close chance at 27 votes,"
but that he didn't know if it would be at
Thursday's Senate floor session.
Legislators who agree with grower
charges that the board is biased in favor of

Cesar Chavez' United Earm Workers union
have blocked funds for the board unless a
series of amendments are approved.
Brown did not make specific reference to
those amendments in his appearance before
the farm worker housing conference. But he
gave the clear impression that those
amendments, which he has rejected in the
past, were what he was talking about.
'Long road'
"I recognize it's easy to sell out. But if you
take the long road, which is the right road,
it's a (lot) better," he said.
"It took a long time to get it back. But let's
have something we can be proud of, and not
a watered down meaningless charade that's
not going to help anybody."
News of a pending third vacancy on the
board occurred yesterday when Joseph
Grodin, a former San Erancisco law profes
sor, announced his resignation, effective
April 30.
Board member Leroy Chatfield quit to work
on Brown's presidential campaign recently,
and board member Joseph Ortega resigned
when he was arrested on a morals charge.
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Gov. Edmund
Brown Jr. said yesterday he is willing to
compromise to win funds for his farm labor
board, but that compromise must not be bet
rayal of secret ballot elections.
Brown said again he is confident he can
break the funding deadlock in the legisla
ture that has incapacitated the board since
Eeb. 6. But for the first time he talked about a
struggle that could last years.
