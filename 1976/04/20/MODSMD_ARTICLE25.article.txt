# Opposing groups debate Nuclear Safeguards Initiative
## 
### Glen Jacobs 
"If ever there was an issue, this is it."
The issue is the passage of the Nuclear
Safeguards Initiative appearing on California's
June 8 ballot. The words are those of Project Sur
vival President James Burch.
Project Survival is a Palo Alto-based group
whose purpose is to educate te the people of
California on the "crucial issues facing the planet
and the whole well-being of humanity " Since its
founding last April, more than 650,000 Califor
nians have joined Project Survival.
"We're not just some kind of fad." says
Burch, who works full time without pay, "we're
here to stay."
"Their dedication and enthusiasm is beyond
belief. I'm frankly in awe," says Friends of the
Earth's energy projects director James Harding
about Project Survival volunteers. "They are to
tally centered on passing the initiative. That cen
teredness is very important."
A pharmacist sells his business and gives his
time and money for the cause. School teachers
take a year's leave of absence to work on the Pro
ject Survival staff as volunteers.
'Quality of life'
"The goal is bigger than you or me or the next
door neighbor" says Project Survival media coor
dinator Barbara Thomas. "We're concerned about
the quality of life on this planet. We want to live in
harmony with the environment and each other."
The Nuclear Safeguards Initiative, if passed,
would give the state legislature the responsibility
for deciding on the safety and risks of nuclear
power plants. Efforts to pass the initiative serve as
a focal point in Project Survival's three-pronged
thrust in the areas of education, conservation and
legislation. Nuclear power is seen by many mem
bers of the group as a direct threat to present and
future generations. "Our broad goal sets the nuc
lear issue in contest," says Thomas.
The California Council for Environmental and
Economic Balance (CEEB) has taken a stand
against the Nuclear Safeguards Initiative. Former
California Gov. Pat Brown serves as chairman of
the Board of Directors of CEEB. The board is com
posed of industry, labor and public representa
tives.
CEEB was formed in June 1973 "to respond to
the environmental legislation of the early '705,"
according to CEEB Deputy Director Peter Fearey.
'Threat'
Michael Peevey, CEEB executive director, con
siders the Nuclear Safeguards Initiative a "griev
ous threat" because it "removes one option" av
ailable to meet the growing energy needs of
California over the next 25 years. Peevey says that
we are running out of fossil fuels, that coal is too
dirty and that our foreign sources are becoming
increasingly unreliable.
He says there is no coal in California and that
there is not much natural gas left. Peevey does not
foresee solar power becoming an important
source before another 25 to 35 years.
"CEEB takes a single frame of reference," says

Project Survival's Burch. "Economic considera
tions outweigh all other considerations inCEEB's
thinking; they are not motivated by the vvel 1-being
of all the people."
'Not volunteers'
"You should ask him (Peevey) how much they
(CEEB) are paying him to say the things he says."
comments Burch, and how much they are paying
Pat Brown to be chairman of the board."
"1 know Mike (Peevey) pretty well," comments
Jim Harding of Friends of the Earth. "I don't think
that he particularly loves nuclear power... 1
think he can be persuaded to change his mind.
"CEEB has been forced to run on 'people' — the
cream of the crop of California industry — not on
the merits of the issue," adds Harding. "Mike is
extremely effective in Sacramento among the
power sources."
Approaches differ
The approaches used by CEEB and Project Sur
vival to promote public hearings on the nuclear
issue are characteristic of the way in which each
operates.
Brown sent a letter to each member of the state
legislature urging that hearings be held. Those
favoring the nuclear initiative presented 350,000
signatures to the state government in a call for a
full report on nuclear energy.
CEEB has focused primarily on getting its views
across to the influential and to the decision mak
ers. relying almost solely on mass media to edu
cate the public. Project Survival has taken a much
different approach, using a face-to-face grassroots
campaign in addition to its mass media opera
tions.
Time-consuming
Project Survival's attempt to educate the public
directly through face-to-face contact takes uptime
of volunteers.
"We are really wanting the best for the world
and are willing to work for it,"says Thomas. The
response to their efforts has been "incredible,"
she says.
"We are working not only for ourselves, but for
our children and the whole planet. When you
really believe in what you're doing, that's what
motivates you."

Jim Harding of Friends of the Earth. "I don't think

Approaches differ
The approaches used by CEEB and Project Sur
vival to promote public hearings on the nuclear
issue are characteristic of the way in which each
operates.
Brown sent a letter to each member of the state
legislature urging that hearings be held. Those
favoring the nuclear initiative presented 350,000
signatures to the state government in a call for a
full report on nuclear energy.
CEEB has focused primarily on getting its views
across to the influential and to the decision mak
ers. relying almost solely on mass media to edu
cate the public. Project Survival has taken a much
different approach, using a face-to-face grassroots
campaign in addition to its mass media opera
tions.
Time-consuming
Project Survival's attempt to educate the public
directly through face-to-face contact takes uptime
of volunteers.
"We are really wanting the best for the world
and are willing to work for it,"says Thomas. The
response to their efforts has been "incredible,"
she says.
"We are working not only for ourselves, but for
our children and the whole planet. When you
really believe in what you're doing, that's what
motivates you."
"If ever there was an issue, this is it."
The issue is the passage of the Nuclear
Safeguards Initiative appearing on California's
June 8 ballot. The words are those of Project Sur
vival President James Burch.
Project Survival is a Palo Alto-based group
whose purpose is to educate te the people of
California on the "crucial issues facing the planet
and the whole well-being of humanity " Since its
founding last April, more than 650,000 Califor
nians have joined Project Survival.
"We're not just some kind of fad." says
Burch, who works full time without pay, "we're
here to stay."
"Their dedication and enthusiasm is beyond
belief. I'm frankly in awe," says Friends of the
Earth's energy projects director James Harding
about Project Survival volunteers. "They are to
tally centered on passing the initiative. That cen
teredness is very important."
A pharmacist sells his business and gives his
time and money for the cause. School teachers
take a year's leave of absence to work on the Pro
ject Survival staff as volunteers.
'Quality of life'
"The goal is bigger than you or me or the next
door neighbor" says Project Survival media coor
dinator Barbara Thomas. "We're concerned about
the quality of life on this planet. We want to live in
harmony with the environment and each other."
The Nuclear Safeguards Initiative, if passed,
would give the state legislature the responsibility
for deciding on the safety and risks of nuclear
power plants. Efforts to pass the initiative serve as
a focal point in Project Survival's three-pronged
thrust in the areas of education, conservation and
legislation. Nuclear power is seen by many mem
bers of the group as a direct threat to present and
future generations. "Our broad goal sets the nuc
lear issue in contest," says Thomas.
The California Council for Environmental and
Economic Balance (CEEB) has taken a stand
against the Nuclear Safeguards Initiative. Former
California Gov. Pat Brown serves as chairman of
the Board of Directors of CEEB. The board is com
posed of industry, labor and public representa
tives.
CEEB was formed in June 1973 "to respond to
the environmental legislation of the early '705,"
according to CEEB Deputy Director Peter Fearey.
'Threat'
Michael Peevey, CEEB executive director, con
siders the Nuclear Safeguards Initiative a "griev
ous threat" because it "removes one option" av
ailable to meet the growing energy needs of
California over the next 25 years. Peevey says that
we are running out of fossil fuels, that coal is too
dirty and that our foreign sources are becoming
increasingly unreliable.
He says there is no coal in California and that
there is not much natural gas left. Peevey does not
foresee solar power becoming an important
source before another 25 to 35 years.
"CEEB takes a single frame of reference," says

Project Survival's Burch. "Economic considera
tions outweigh all other considerations inCEEB's
thinking; they are not motivated by the vvel 1-being
of all the people."

the quality of life on this planet. We want to live in
harmony with the environment and each other."
The Nuclear Safeguards Initiative, if passed,
would give the state legislature the responsibility
for deciding on the safety and risks of nuclear
power plants. Efforts to pass the initiative serve as
a focal point in Project Survival's three-pronged
thrust in the areas of education, conservation and
legislation. Nuclear power is seen by many mem
bers of the group as a direct threat to present and
future generations. "Our broad goal sets the nuc
lear issue in contest," says Thomas.
The California Council for Environmental and
Economic Balance (CEEB) has taken a stand
against the Nuclear Safeguards Initiative. Former
California Gov. Pat Brown serves as chairman of
the Board of Directors of CEEB. The board is com
posed of industry, labor and public representa
tives.
CEEB was formed in June 1973 "to respond to
the environmental legislation of the early '705,"
according to CEEB Deputy Director Peter Fearey.
'Threat'
Michael Peevey, CEEB executive director, con
siders the Nuclear Safeguards Initiative a "griev
ous threat" because it "removes one option" av
ailable to meet the growing energy needs of
California over the next 25 years. Peevey says that
we are running out of fossil fuels, that coal is too
dirty and that our foreign sources are becoming
increasingly unreliable.
He says there is no coal in California and that
there is not much natural gas left. Peevey does not
foresee solar power becoming an important
source before another 25 to 35 years.
"CEEB takes a single frame of reference," says

Project Survival's Burch. "Economic considera
tions outweigh all other considerations inCEEB's
thinking; they are not motivated by the vvel 1-being
of all the people."
'Not volunteers'
"You should ask him (Peevey) how much they
(CEEB) are paying him to say the things he says."
comments Burch, and how much they are paying
Pat Brown to be chairman of the board."
"1 know Mike (Peevey) pretty well," comments
Jim Harding of Friends of the Earth. "I don't think
that he particularly loves nuclear power... 1
think he can be persuaded to change his mind.
"CEEB has been forced to run on 'people' — the
cream of the crop of California industry — not on
the merits of the issue," adds Harding. "Mike is
extremely effective in Sacramento among the
power sources."
Approaches differ
The approaches used by CEEB and Project Sur
vival to promote public hearings on the nuclear
issue are characteristic of the way in which each
operates.
Brown sent a letter to each member of the state
legislature urging that hearings be held. Those
favoring the nuclear initiative presented 350,000
signatures to the state government in a call for a
full report on nuclear energy.
CEEB has focused primarily on getting its views
across to the influential and to the decision mak
ers. relying almost solely on mass media to edu
cate the public. Project Survival has taken a much
different approach, using a face-to-face grassroots
campaign in addition to its mass media opera
tions.
Time-consuming
Project Survival's attempt to educate the public
directly through face-to-face contact takes uptime
of volunteers.
"We are really wanting the best for the world
and are willing to work for it,"says Thomas. The
response to their efforts has been "incredible,"
she says.
"We are working not only for ourselves, but for
our children and the whole planet. When you
really believe in what you're doing, that's what
motivates you."
