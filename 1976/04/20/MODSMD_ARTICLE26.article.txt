# Krill, shrimp-like crustaceans, may prove valuable food source
## 
### 
ANTARCTICA (PNS) — Sail
ing in Antarctic waters they
knew to be several hundred
fathoms deep, the crew of the re
search vessel Hero was startled
tjis their sonar equipment seemed
to go haywire. The instruments
indicated a solid bottom 20 feet
below the ship's hull.
On an officer's hunch, the
deck crew lowered a net over the
side. Up came millions of tinv,
wriggling krill. The officer esti
mated there were up to 25 square
miles of them packed as dense as
.in iceberg 20 to 30 feet deep.
Krill—trans pa rent-bodied,
shrimp-like crustaceans—are so
high in protein and so plentiful
they could well become a
worldwide food source over the
ne*t decade. The tiny crusta
ceans live in huge schools a few
fathoms from the surface of the
Antarctic Ocean, the world's
most treacherous and storm
whipped body of water. (Species
of krill also inhabit more temp
erate waters, but less is known
about them as a potential food
source.)
Chilean authorities estimated
in 1.975 that the total mass of krill
on earth might be a staggering 11
trillion pounds — far surpassing
the total mass of the human race
— and that 150 to 200 million

tons of krill could be harvested
annually without appreciably af
fecting species reproduction.
An annual krill catch of 150
million tons would alone be
more than twice the entire
planet's current annual fish
catch — which was around 65
million tons in 1972.
The world's annual fish catch
has since been declining. Over
fishing has endangered the exis
tence of some marine species by
interfering with their abilities to
reproduce. Seaside land de
velopment projects have de
stroyed many coastal estuaries,
the "nurseries of the sea" where
fish spawn. And pollution has
threatened fish populations by
upsetting the oceans' ecological
balance.
Against this backdrop of di
minishing food supply and in
creasing famine on land, krill
offer a potential breakthrough as
a plentiful source of food — a
self-generating staple protein
supply.
Self-destruct
But krill may for now be little
more than a tantalizing mirage.
Before they reach the frozen
foods counter, they must be pre
vented from self-destructing.
Krill decompose very quickly
when killed. As they die, their

bodies release an enzyme that
putrifies them within an hour —
so krill must be processed on the
spot by factory ships that kill,
process and package the catch
on the high seas.
The Soviet Union, Japan,
Chile and West Germany have
all begun research on krill pro
cessing. The Japanese, under
worldwide pressure to find a
substitute for the increasingly
threatened whale, have made the
most progress.
The Japanese harvest krill and
immediately process them into a
bean curd-like paste on factory
ships. Liquid is extracted at high
pressure from the krill, then
congealed with heat into conve
niently stored and transported
blocks of paste. They can be
marketed directly in that form,
or mixed with cheese and butter.
Krill paste has already been
test-marketed in Japan with
some success, ft has a delicate
flavor, not unlike shrimp, and
contains 13 to 20 percent pro
tein, comparable to most cheeses
and fish and greater than the pro
tein content of eggs or milk.
Exploding population
The decline of the whale—
long the krill's most important
predator — has triggered the
krill's population explosion.

When stoma"chs*of captured
whales are split open aboard
whaling vessels, two tons of krill
sometimes spill over the decks.
Krill grow to lengths of two
inches in maturity. Living about
two years, they spawn in deep
water but spend most of their
time in shallow water, where
they serve as food for larger An
tarctic fish and birds. Krill them
selves feed on microscopic yel
low organisms called diatoms,
which are so plentiful in Antarc
tic waters they sometimes turn
icebergs yeilow.
Swarming in schools, krill
make an easy mark for harvest
ing. And each krill has two ab
dominal photopores that emit a
blue-green light visible to ships
when krill surface near the water
at night.
Battle over Antarctica?
The staggering potential of
krill as a world protein source
can only increase world interest
in mineral-rich Antarctica, the
earth's largest untapped land
mass. The Antarctic is currently
a zone of international
cooperation—land claims were
"frozen" there for 30 years by the
Antarctic Treaty of 1961, an out
growth of the 1957-58 Interna
tional Geophysical Year.
The treaty placed a

moratorium on disputed land
claims and prohibited commer
cial and military development of
the area. Several nations — the
United States, Soviet Union,
Chile, Argentina, Britain. New
Zealand and South Africa —
maintain research bases on An
tarctica and nearby islands.
There are even two abandoned
whaling "ghost towns" on South
Georgia island near Antarctica
that could serve as krill bases if
needed. Complete with homes.

churches, machine shops and
standing piers — even diesel
engine ships moored at the
docks — the towns of Grytviken
and Leith Harbor contained 4000
residents until abandoned by
Japanese whalers in 1964.
But many of the islands near
Antarctica—and various parts of
the continent itself—are still
under dispute.
The Antarctic Peninsula,
which juts north toward Cape
Horn, is claimed by Chile,

Argentina and Britain. The
South Shetland Islands are
claimed by Britain and Chile; the
Falkland Islands by Britain and
Argentina. Australia, New Zea
land, Norway and France also
claim sovereignty over areas of
Antarctica.
As krill expeditions from sev
eral nations steam southward, it
remains unclear whether the An
tarctic will remain a zone of in
ternational cooperation — or be
come the earth's final geo
political battleground.

KRILL SHOT — The krill, or Euphasia Superba to biology majors, is so plentiful in Antarctic waters
that it could become a staple world protein source in the next decade.
ANTARCTICA (PNS) — Sail
ing in Antarctic waters they
knew to be several hundred
fathoms deep, the crew of the re
search vessel Hero was startled
tjis their sonar equipment seemed
to go haywire. The instruments
indicated a solid bottom 20 feet
below the ship's hull.
On an officer's hunch, the
deck crew lowered a net over the
side. Up came millions of tinv,
wriggling krill. The officer esti
mated there were up to 25 square
miles of them packed as dense as
.in iceberg 20 to 30 feet deep.
Krill—trans pa rent-bodied,
shrimp-like crustaceans—are so
high in protein and so plentiful
they could well become a
worldwide food source over the
ne*t decade. The tiny crusta
ceans live in huge schools a few
fathoms from the surface of the
Antarctic Ocean, the world's
most treacherous and storm
whipped body of water. (Species
of krill also inhabit more temp
erate waters, but less is known
about them as a potential food
source.)
Chilean authorities estimated
in 1.975 that the total mass of krill
on earth might be a staggering 11
trillion pounds — far surpassing
the total mass of the human race
— and that 150 to 200 million

tons of krill could be harvested
annually without appreciably af
fecting species reproduction.
An annual krill catch of 150
million tons would alone be
more than twice the entire
planet's current annual fish
catch — which was around 65
million tons in 1972.
The world's annual fish catch
has since been declining. Over
fishing has endangered the exis
tence of some marine species by
interfering with their abilities to
reproduce. Seaside land de
velopment projects have de
stroyed many coastal estuaries,
the "nurseries of the sea" where
fish spawn. And pollution has
threatened fish populations by
upsetting the oceans' ecological
balance.
Against this backdrop of di
minishing food supply and in
creasing famine on land, krill
offer a potential breakthrough as
a plentiful source of food — a
self-generating staple protein
supply.
Self-destruct
But krill may for now be little
more than a tantalizing mirage.
Before they reach the frozen
foods counter, they must be pre
vented from self-destructing.
Krill decompose very quickly
when killed. As they die, their

bodies release an enzyme that
putrifies them within an hour —
so krill must be processed on the
spot by factory ships that kill,
process and package the catch
on the high seas.
The Soviet Union, Japan,
Chile and West Germany have
all begun research on krill pro
cessing. The Japanese, under
worldwide pressure to find a
substitute for the increasingly
threatened whale, have made the
most progress.
The Japanese harvest krill and
immediately process them into a
bean curd-like paste on factory
ships. Liquid is extracted at high
pressure from the krill, then
congealed with heat into conve
niently stored and transported
blocks of paste. They can be
marketed directly in that form,
or mixed with cheese and butter.
Krill paste has already been
test-marketed in Japan with
some success, ft has a delicate
flavor, not unlike shrimp, and
contains 13 to 20 percent pro
tein, comparable to most cheeses
and fish and greater than the pro
tein content of eggs or milk.
Exploding population
The decline of the whale—
long the krill's most important
predator — has triggered the
krill's population explosion.

When stoma"chs*of captured
whales are split open aboard
whaling vessels, two tons of krill
sometimes spill over the decks.
Krill grow to lengths of two
inches in maturity. Living about
two years, they spawn in deep
water but spend most of their
time in shallow water, where
they serve as food for larger An
tarctic fish and birds. Krill them
selves feed on microscopic yel
low organisms called diatoms,
which are so plentiful in Antarc
tic waters they sometimes turn
icebergs yeilow.
Swarming in schools, krill
make an easy mark for harvest
ing. And each krill has two ab
dominal photopores that emit a
blue-green light visible to ships
when krill surface near the water
at night.
Battle over Antarctica?
The staggering potential of
krill as a world protein source
can only increase world interest
in mineral-rich Antarctica, the
earth's largest untapped land
mass. The Antarctic is currently
a zone of international
cooperation—land claims were
"frozen" there for 30 years by the
Antarctic Treaty of 1961, an out
growth of the 1957-58 Interna
tional Geophysical Year.
The treaty placed a

moratorium on disputed land
claims and prohibited commer
cial and military development of
the area. Several nations — the
United States, Soviet Union,
Chile, Argentina, Britain. New
Zealand and South Africa —
maintain research bases on An
tarctica and nearby islands.
There are even two abandoned
whaling "ghost towns" on South
Georgia island near Antarctica
that could serve as krill bases if
needed. Complete with homes.

churches, machine shops and
standing piers — even diesel
engine ships moored at the
docks — the towns of Grytviken
and Leith Harbor contained 4000
residents until abandoned by
Japanese whalers in 1964.
But many of the islands near
Antarctica—and various parts of
the continent itself—are still
under dispute.
The Antarctic Peninsula,
which juts north toward Cape
Horn, is claimed by Chile,

Argentina and Britain. The
South Shetland Islands are
claimed by Britain and Chile; the
Falkland Islands by Britain and
Argentina. Australia, New Zea
land, Norway and France also
claim sovereignty over areas of
Antarctica.
As krill expeditions from sev
eral nations steam southward, it
remains unclear whether the An
tarctic will remain a zone of in
ternational cooperation — or be
come the earth's final geo
political battleground.

KRILL SHOT — The krill, or Euphasia Superba to biology majors, is so plentiful in Antarctic waters
that it could become a staple world protein source in the next decade.
ANTARCTICA (PNS) — Sail
ing in Antarctic waters they
knew to be several hundred
fathoms deep, the crew of the re
search vessel Hero was startled
tjis their sonar equipment seemed
to go haywire. The instruments
indicated a solid bottom 20 feet
below the ship's hull.
On an officer's hunch, the
deck crew lowered a net over the
side. Up came millions of tinv,
wriggling krill. The officer esti
mated there were up to 25 square
miles of them packed as dense as
.in iceberg 20 to 30 feet deep.
Krill—trans pa rent-bodied,
shrimp-like crustaceans—are so
high in protein and so plentiful
they could well become a
worldwide food source over the
ne*t decade. The tiny crusta
ceans live in huge schools a few
fathoms from the surface of the
Antarctic Ocean, the world's
most treacherous and storm
whipped body of water. (Species
of krill also inhabit more temp
erate waters, but less is known
about them as a potential food
source.)
Chilean authorities estimated
in 1.975 that the total mass of krill
on earth might be a staggering 11
trillion pounds — far surpassing
the total mass of the human race
— and that 150 to 200 million

tons of krill could be harvested
annually without appreciably af
fecting species reproduction.
An annual krill catch of 150
million tons would alone be
more than twice the entire
planet's current annual fish
catch — which was around 65
million tons in 1972.
The world's annual fish catch
has since been declining. Over
fishing has endangered the exis
tence of some marine species by
interfering with their abilities to
reproduce. Seaside land de
velopment projects have de
stroyed many coastal estuaries,
the "nurseries of the sea" where
fish spawn. And pollution has
threatened fish populations by
upsetting the oceans' ecological
balance.
Against this backdrop of di
minishing food supply and in
creasing famine on land, krill
offer a potential breakthrough as
a plentiful source of food — a
self-generating staple protein
supply.
Self-destruct
But krill may for now be little
more than a tantalizing mirage.
Before they reach the frozen
foods counter, they must be pre
vented from self-destructing.
Krill decompose very quickly
when killed. As they die, their

bodies release an enzyme that
putrifies them within an hour —
so krill must be processed on the
spot by factory ships that kill,
process and package the catch
on the high seas.
The Soviet Union, Japan,
Chile and West Germany have
all begun research on krill pro
cessing. The Japanese, under
worldwide pressure to find a
substitute for the increasingly
threatened whale, have made the
most progress.
The Japanese harvest krill and
immediately process them into a
bean curd-like paste on factory
ships. Liquid is extracted at high
pressure from the krill, then
congealed with heat into conve
niently stored and transported
blocks of paste. They can be
marketed directly in that form,
or mixed with cheese and butter.
Krill paste has already been
test-marketed in Japan with
some success, ft has a delicate
flavor, not unlike shrimp, and
contains 13 to 20 percent pro
tein, comparable to most cheeses
and fish and greater than the pro
tein content of eggs or milk.
Exploding population
The decline of the whale—
long the krill's most important
predator — has triggered the
krill's population explosion.

When stoma"chs*of captured
whales are split open aboard
whaling vessels, two tons of krill
sometimes spill over the decks.
Krill grow to lengths of two
inches in maturity. Living about
two years, they spawn in deep
water but spend most of their
time in shallow water, where
they serve as food for larger An
tarctic fish and birds. Krill them
selves feed on microscopic yel
low organisms called diatoms,
which are so plentiful in Antarc
tic waters they sometimes turn
icebergs yeilow.
Swarming in schools, krill
make an easy mark for harvest
ing. And each krill has two ab
dominal photopores that emit a
blue-green light visible to ships
when krill surface near the water
at night.
Battle over Antarctica?
The staggering potential of
krill as a world protein source
can only increase world interest
in mineral-rich Antarctica, the
earth's largest untapped land
mass. The Antarctic is currently
a zone of international
cooperation—land claims were
"frozen" there for 30 years by the
Antarctic Treaty of 1961, an out
growth of the 1957-58 Interna
tional Geophysical Year.
The treaty placed a

moratorium on disputed land
claims and prohibited commer
cial and military development of
the area. Several nations — the
United States, Soviet Union,
Chile, Argentina, Britain. New
Zealand and South Africa —
maintain research bases on An
tarctica and nearby islands.
There are even two abandoned
whaling "ghost towns" on South
Georgia island near Antarctica
that could serve as krill bases if
needed. Complete with homes.

churches, machine shops and
standing piers — even diesel
engine ships moored at the
docks — the towns of Grytviken
and Leith Harbor contained 4000
residents until abandoned by
Japanese whalers in 1964.
But many of the islands near
Antarctica—and various parts of
the continent itself—are still
under dispute.
The Antarctic Peninsula,
which juts north toward Cape
Horn, is claimed by Chile,

Argentina and Britain. The
South Shetland Islands are
claimed by Britain and Chile; the
Falkland Islands by Britain and
Argentina. Australia, New Zea
land, Norway and France also
claim sovereignty over areas of
Antarctica.
As krill expeditions from sev
eral nations steam southward, it
remains unclear whether the An
