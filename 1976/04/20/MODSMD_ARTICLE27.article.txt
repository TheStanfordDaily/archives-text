# Prostitutes' male customers must face arrest, judges rule
## 
### 
OAKLAND (FNS) — Male customers must
now be arrested as often as women prostitutes
by policemen enforcing California's anti
prostitution statute — or the cases against
women prostitutes will be thrown out on
grounds of sexual discrimination.
That's the impact of a ruling handed in early
April by a three-judge panel in the state's First
Appellate District. Women in 250 cases in
Alameda County had their solicitation and
prostitution arrests thrown out because the
court found that sexual discrimination in the
enforcement of the law violated their constitu
tional right to equal protection.
The decision is the first to require dismissal
of a serious criminal indictment because a law
was unequally enforced against a whole class
of persons.
Systematic bias
Alameda County Public Defender Michael
Millman used Oakland statistics for 1973-74 to
show how systematic bias worked against the
arrested women: 1448 females arrested, only
59 male customers picked up.
Most of the solicitation arrests were made by
decoys — police officers imitating prostitutes
or customers. The court found that women
were arrested 20 times more often than men
because the department used male decoys 20
times more often than female decoys. When no
decoys were used, the numbers were even
more unbalanced: 325 women, 2 men.
That's the way anti-prostitution statutes
have traditionally been enforced by police de
partments in California and the rest of the
country: Round up the women and let the male
"tricks" go free.
But California law as it is written applies
equally to men and women, buyers and sellers.
The penal code defines prostitution as "any
lewd act between persons for money" and
specifies that "every person" who engages in
the act is subject to prosecution.
In the Alameda County cases, the Oakland
Police Department chose to prosecute only the
female participants in sexual transactions on
the grounds that they, as sellers, were the "pro
fiteers" in the deal.

After a lower court ruled against this "selec
tive discriminatory enforcement pattern,"
Oakland police had to change their tactics,
even though the cases were on appeal. Last year
461 males were arrested, as compared with 051
women. Tom Condit, senior trial district attor
ney for Alameda County, expects this 2 to 3
ratio to even out eventually.
The Oakland turnabout has been achieved
through the use of many more women police
officers to decoy*male customers. Vice Squad
Lt. Elwyn Strelo notes with pride that "the
return on investment from a management
point of view" (number of arrests) is greatest
when "the gals" are used. "Baby-faced gals are
the ones the guys go for the fastest," says
Strelo.
Under the new Appellate Court decision,
any California police department arrest profile
which shows substantially more women
charged than men will automatically be sus
pect. Unless prosecutors can show that the
state has some "compelling interest" in pick
ing up) women and ignoring men. arrests will
be dismissed.
Follow the leader
To continue enforcing prostitution and sol
icitation statutes, police elsewhere will proba
bly have to follow Oakland's example and
employ more women officers imitating prosti
tutes. But will other cities want to make the
same "investment" just to trap men who want
to buy sex?
San Francisco has already discovered that
equal enforcement doesn't produce many con
victions in that city. Only 23 percent of men
charged with soliciting women decoys were
convicted by juries there last year. (Conviction
rate for other serious crimes is 81 percent.)
New San Francisco Dist. Attv. Joseph Freitas
gives prostitution arrests very low priority.
The ruling may cause other localities to de
cide that law-enforcement dollars should be
spend on more pressing needs. Back in
Alameda County, there's now a taxpayers' suit
to stop the use of public funds to enforce pros
titution laws. The plaintiffs claim it's a waste of
tax money.

Alameda County Public Defender Michael
Millman used Oakland statistics for 1973-74 to
show how systematic bias worked against the
arrested women: 1448 females arrested, only
59 male customers picked up.
Most of the solicitation arrests were made by
decoys — police officers imitating prostitutes
or customers. The court found that women
were arrested 20 times more often than men
because the department used male decoys 20
times more often than female decoys. When no
decoys were used, the numbers were even
more unbalanced: 325 women, 2 men.
That's the way anti-prostitution statutes
have traditionally been enforced by police de
partments in California and the rest of the
country: Round up the women and let the male
"tricks" go free.
But California law as it is written applies
equally to men and women, buyers and sellers.
The penal code defines prostitution as "any
lewd act between persons for money" and
specifies that "every person" who engages in
the act is subject to prosecution.
In the Alameda County cases, the Oakland
Police Department chose to prosecute only the
female participants in sexual transactions on
the grounds that they, as sellers, were the "pro
fiteers" in the deal.

After a lower court ruled against this "selec
tive discriminatory enforcement pattern,"
Oakland police had to change their tactics,
even though the cases were on appeal. Last year
461 males were arrested, as compared with 051
women. Tom Condit, senior trial district attor
ney for Alameda County, expects this 2 to 3
ratio to even out eventually.
The Oakland turnabout has been achieved
through the use of many more women police
officers to decoy*male customers. Vice Squad
Lt. Elwyn Strelo notes with pride that "the
return on investment from a management
point of view" (number of arrests) is greatest
when "the gals" are used. "Baby-faced gals are
the ones the guys go for the fastest," says
Strelo.
Under the new Appellate Court decision,
any California police department arrest profile
which shows substantially more women
charged than men will automatically be sus
pect. Unless prosecutors can show that the
state has some "compelling interest" in pick
ing up) women and ignoring men. arrests will
be dismissed.
Follow the leader
To continue enforcing prostitution and sol
icitation statutes, police elsewhere will proba
bly have to follow Oakland's example and
employ more women officers imitating prosti
tutes. But will other cities want to make the
same "investment" just to trap men who want
to buy sex?
San Francisco has already discovered that
equal enforcement doesn't produce many con
victions in that city. Only 23 percent of men
charged with soliciting women decoys were
convicted by juries there last year. (Conviction
rate for other serious crimes is 81 percent.)
New San Francisco Dist. Attv. Joseph Freitas
gives prostitution arrests very low priority.
The ruling may cause other localities to de
cide that law-enforcement dollars should be
spend on more pressing needs. Back in
Alameda County, there's now a taxpayers' suit
to stop the use of public funds to enforce pros
titution laws. The plaintiffs claim it's a waste of
tax money.
OAKLAND (FNS) — Male customers must
now be arrested as often as women prostitutes
by policemen enforcing California's anti
prostitution statute — or the cases against
women prostitutes will be thrown out on
grounds of sexual discrimination.
That's the impact of a ruling handed in early
April by a three-judge panel in the state's First
Appellate District. Women in 250 cases in
Alameda County had their solicitation and
prostitution arrests thrown out because the
court found that sexual discrimination in the
enforcement of the law violated their constitu
tional right to equal protection.
The decision is the first to require dismissal
of a serious criminal indictment because a law
was unequally enforced against a whole class
of persons.
