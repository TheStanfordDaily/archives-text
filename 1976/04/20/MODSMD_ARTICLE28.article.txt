# Freedom fight rages in Western Sahara

### 
EL AIUN, Western Sahara (PNS) — The
roofs of El Aiuu are domed, as though the
desert sun made them bubble up, ready to
burst. The heat is always intense in this
Western Sahara capial, especially for the
Polisario — desert tribesmen fighting for
independence in the world's richest phos
phate territory.
Outmanned, outgunned, outsupplied,
the tribesmen (called Sahraouis) have
waged guerrilla war for three years — first
against the Spanish colonialists and now
against their new occupiers, the Moroccans
and Mauritanians.
The Spanish, who used to grudgingly
label El Aiun's Sahraoui neighborhood "La
Republica del Polisario," had been unable
to remove "La Republica's" flag painted on
one of the sand-swept streets. When the ter
ritory changed hands last December after
Morocco's dramatic march into the Sahara,
the Spaniards passed the scraper on to the
Moroccans, but the scimitar-moon stub
bornly remained.
The Spaniards were afraid to set foot up
here, but that is no problem for the Moroc
cans: The neighborhood is empty of all but
the elderly, the women and their children.
The rest — about 20,000 of El Aiun's 25,000
Sahraoui inhabitants — cleared out when
the Moroccans marched in.
The Sahraouis abandoned their huts in
the towns along the desert caravan routes
and fled to Algeria — which supplies the
rebels — and Mauritania, which used to
offer them sanctuary. When special IJ.N.
envoy Olof Rydbeck of Sweden tried to
learn in January whether the Sahraoui fa
vored independence — or the military oc
cupation by Morocco and Mauritania estab
lished in December's Accord of Madrid —
there was no one left to talk with. They had
all left.
In Rydbeck's quixotic pursuit of the elu
sive desert tribesmen, he has become almost
as much a nomad as the Sahraouis them
selves. After trekking back and forth between
Morocco. Mauritania and Spain, Rydbeck
finally traveled to southern Algeria to see if
tens of thousands of Sahraouis actually
were in refugee camps there — and to gauge
whether their reported cries for indepen

dence were real or just Algerian prop
aganda. Algeria lias bitterly opposed
Moroccan control of the Sahara and has
clashed at least once there with its long
time rival neighbor.
On his latest mission. RydbecL by seeing
theSahraoui rebels before visiting Morocco
and Mauritania, outraged those two coun
tries. The United Nations, they complained,
had consulted the enemy — "Algerian
backed mercenaries," Morocco called them
— on the destiny of the territory they believe
is legally theirs.
"It's like throwing oil on a fire."
Mauritania's president said.
Morocco and Mauritania then refused
Rydbeck's entry, which was necessary to
complete his investigation, and accused
Secretary General Kurt Waldheim of curry
ing the favors of Algeria — a self
proclaimed third world leader — for up
coming U.N. elections.
Legal holes
Although Morocco considers the Sah
ara a closed file, its claim to the territory
seems to be riddled with legal holes.
The Accord of Madrid and the? transfer of
the territory were supposed to be ratified by
a "legitimate" consultation with the
Sahraoui people. But according to reliable
Spanish sources, the )emaa (the assembly of
Sahraoui tribal leaders) affirmed the accord
Feb. 26 only after the Moroccans padded its
ranks — emptied in December when a
majority left to join Polisario — and bribed
its remaining members.
Neither Spain nor the U.N. recognizes the
Jemaa's action as legitimate. And neither
believes Spain had the power to transfer
anything more than administrative powers
to Morocco and Mauritania. Sovereign
powers were supposed to remain with the
Sahraouis.
In reality, though. Morocco and
Mauritania are firmly in control of the ter
ritory. except for the Polisario mountain
strongholds hammered daily by Moroccan
F-104 fighters.
A resident of one such stronghold com
mented:

"We'll get Morocco out. even if wehaveto
drag her by the tail."
"The Sahraoui have only two choices,"
saiil another. "We either win our indepen
dence or die fighting."
When asked if Algerian troops are with
the Polisario. a hawk-faced youth replied,
"No, not one. Algeria gives us weapons,
training. Hut no men. This is our battle."
These Polisario also denied that Cubans,
Vietnamese, Spanish Foreign Legionaires
or any of the other rumored mercenaries are
filling their ranks.
"What good would a Vietnamese be in the
Sahara?" one sneered.
Algerian influence
Whatever help Algeria has been, it may
recently have hurt the Polisario cause.
Algeria's unfounded contention that the
Organization of African Unity had unanim
ously endorsed the Polisario's "Republic of
Arab Sahara" damaged the Sahraoui's cre
dibility, as did Algeria's exaggerations of
Polisario victories.
If the Polisario were able to score a mira
cle win over Morocco and Mauritania, their
rich phosphate deposits would not be
enough to secure their republic. The
Sahraouis— mostly poor, nomadic goat and
cattle-herders — have only one lawyer, two
doctors and five engineers in their popula
tion of 70,000.
They no doubt would have to ask Algeria
for help — and that would likely come with
strings attached.
Algeria has reasons of its own to control
the territory. It needs an Atlantic port to
ship iron from its mines at Tindouf. And by
occupying the Western Sahara, Algeria
could head off the possibility of a
Morocco-Mauritania alliance while putting
Morocco in a strategic hammerlock by sur
rounding it on land.
But for now the Sahraoui are worried
mostly about Morocco, which they look
upon not as their brother but as yet another
colonial power
Meanwhile their cry for independence —
or at least for legitimate representation —
has been lost in the power play between
their two stronger neighbors.
