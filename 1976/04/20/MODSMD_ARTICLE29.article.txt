## Despite Maze's heroics UCLA edges men netters 
### Paul Bauman 
"I've never been so happy to
win a match . .. I'm telling you,"
said UCLA's Peter Fleming
Saturday night in Maples Pavil
ion after he and Brian Teacher
had helped give the Bruin tennis
team a 5-4 victory over Stanford.
"How much pressure was
there?" he asked rhetorically.
One fan offered an answer: "I
was shaking."
The game score is 4-4 in the
third and deciding set: Bill Maze
and Pat DuPre against Fleming
and Teacher. Stanford has won
four previous matches; UCLA
four. A win by Maze and DuPre
means:
—they have beaten the top two
amateurs in the country,
—the Cards have put an end to
the Bruins' two-year, 35-match
win streak, and
—Stanford has a chance to
take over the top spot in the na
tional rankings.
A loss by Maze and DuPre
means:
—a sincere pat on the back,
—applause for a great effort,
and

—a little more privacy in the
locker room.
Maze loses his serve, UCLA
goes up 5-4, and it looks like it's
all over. Fleming will serve for
the set and match and he hasn't
lost his serve all night in singles
or doubles.
Set to smash
With the point score at 2-1
(UCLA), Fleming gets set to
smash an overhead. The nearly
infallible 6-foot-5 junior will
naturally put the ball away and
the Bruins will have three match
points coming.
But wait.
Fleming stiffens up and hits
the ball into the net, evening the
score at 2-2. Maze then puts
Stanford ahead with a beautiful
forehand topspin return cross
court off his back foot.
Fleming hits the ball out over
the baseline on the next point
and Maze and DuPre have the
precious break. Spontaneous
applause and a standing ovation.
The game score is 5-5.
Things are looking good for
Stanford. Assuming DuPre
holds his serve, the worst the

Cards can do is go into a tie
breaker at 6-6.
But wait.
Ties score
Teacher ties the score at 3-3
with a backhand cross-court and
then Fleming unloads a back
hand return off DuPre's serve
for a winner. UCLA has broken
back to lead in games, 6-5.
With Teacher serving for the
match, DuPre hits a forehand
into the net and then another
over the baseline. Teacher and
Fleming lead 3-1 in the game.
This time it's really over. Triple
match point.
But wait.
Teacher double faults. Double
match point. Teacher serves to
DuPre, who blasts the ball right
back. The UCLA All-American,
an excellent net player, volleys
into the nylon.
The score is 3-3. UCLA has one
match point left. Teacher serves
to Maze and in the ensuing rally,
Fleming hits a shot down the
middle. Maze and DuPre wait at
the baseline and either could
probably return it by himself.
Both go for it
But they both go for it, clash
ing rackets, and popping the ball
up well in front of the net. Before
the ball landed, Fleming joyfully
jumped up in the air. Then the
ball hit the Sportface carpet and
it was official. This time it was
all over.
Stanford had come within one
point and a tiebreaker of beating
what is quite possibly the best
college tennis team of all time.
Fleming said afterward he
didn't expect such a close match.
"Jesus, I've been playing well.
I thought we were going to bowl
these guys over. But Maze
played like a fiend. DuPre has
never had much of a serve, but he
was serving the ball out of the
court."
That Maze and DuPre even
had the opportunity to win the
dual match for Stanford was
surprising in itself.
Crunch
The Bruins crunched Stan
ford, 8-1, two weeks ago in Los
Angeles, and they hadn't lost
more than two individual
matches to any one school this
year.
But as play moved into
Maples, the match score was 3-3.
Stanford's wins came from Mark
Mitchell at fourth singles, con
sistent Perry Wright at sixth
singles and Wright and Matt
Mitchell at third doubles.
That set up what had to be one
of the most spectacular perfor
mances of any college player in
the country this year. Maze
broke out of his slump to not
only beat, but rout, Teacher, the
top ranked amateur in the U.S.
The score was 7-6, 6-2.
Teacher was off his game
slightly, and Maze was at his
best. The 6-3 sophomore rock
eted his first serve in as usual,
but this time his returns-of-serve

and groundstrokes were equally
sharp.
Greatest shots
Maze made some of the
greatest shots this side of Arthur
Ashe. Several times he scored
points on half-volleys, actually
meeting the ball when it was be
hind him.
A sequence of shots that put
Maze up 5-0 in the second set
exemplified his performance.
First he hit a backhand behind
the baseline facing in the oppo
site direction of the net. When
Teacher countered with a
"dink," Maze raced to the net
and not only reached the ball,
but hit a cross-court drop shot
that fell untouched.
Friday's match against USC
(14-4) also went down to the last
contest, which Stanford (10-3)
won to defeat the Trojans, 5-4.
Maze and DuPre topped Bruce
Manson and Chris Lewis, 6-4,
6-4, before a crowd of 3600 in
Maples.

FLOATING BACKHAND — Stanford's Pat DuPre floats across the baseline to return a shot from
UCLA's Peter Fleming in the No. 1 singles match Saturday night in Maples Pavilion. Fleming
prevailed, however, downing DuPre, 7-6, 6-4.
"I've never been so happy to
win a match . .. I'm telling you,"
said UCLA's Peter Fleming
Saturday night in Maples Pavil
ion after he and Brian Teacher
had helped give the Bruin tennis
team a 5-4 victory over Stanford.
"How much pressure was
there?" he asked rhetorically.
One fan offered an answer: "I
was shaking."
The game score is 4-4 in the
third and deciding set: Bill Maze
and Pat DuPre against Fleming
and Teacher. Stanford has won
four previous matches; UCLA
four. A win by Maze and DuPre
means:
—they have beaten the top two
amateurs in the country,
—the Cards have put an end to
the Bruins' two-year, 35-match
win streak, and
—Stanford has a chance to
take over the top spot in the na
tional rankings.
A loss by Maze and DuPre
means:
—a sincere pat on the back,
—applause for a great effort,
and

—a little more privacy in the
locker room.
Maze loses his serve, UCLA
goes up 5-4, and it looks like it's
all over. Fleming will serve for
the set and match and he hasn't
lost his serve all night in singles
or doubles.
Set to smash
With the point score at 2-1
(UCLA), Fleming gets set to
smash an overhead. The nearly
infallible 6-foot-5 junior will
naturally put the ball away and
the Bruins will have three match
points coming.
But wait.
Fleming stiffens up and hits
the ball into the net, evening the
score at 2-2. Maze then puts
Stanford ahead with a beautiful
forehand topspin return cross
court off his back foot.
Fleming hits the ball out over
the baseline on the next point
and Maze and DuPre have the
precious break. Spontaneous
applause and a standing ovation.
The game score is 5-5.
Things are looking good for
Stanford. Assuming DuPre
holds his serve, the worst the

Cards can do is go into a tie
breaker at 6-6.
But wait.
Ties score
Teacher ties the score at 3-3
with a backhand cross-court and
then Fleming unloads a back
hand return off DuPre's serve
for a winner. UCLA has broken
back to lead in games, 6-5.
With Teacher serving for the
match, DuPre hits a forehand
into the net and then another
over the baseline. Teacher and
Fleming lead 3-1 in the game.
This time it's really over. Triple
match point.
But wait.
Teacher double faults. Double
match point. Teacher serves to
DuPre, who blasts the ball right
back. The UCLA All-American,
an excellent net player, volleys
into the nylon.
The score is 3-3. UCLA has one
match point left. Teacher serves
to Maze and in the ensuing rally,
Fleming hits a shot down the
middle. Maze and DuPre wait at
the baseline and either could
probably return it by himself.
Both go for it
But they both go for it, clash
ing rackets, and popping the ball
up well in front of the net. Before
the ball landed, Fleming joyfully
jumped up in the air. Then the
ball hit the Sportface carpet and
it was official. This time it was
all over.
Stanford had come within one
point and a tiebreaker of beating
what is quite possibly the best
college tennis team of all time.
Fleming said afterward he
didn't expect such a close match.
"Jesus, I've been playing well.
I thought we were going to bowl
these guys over. But Maze
played like a fiend. DuPre has
never had much of a serve, but he
was serving the ball out of the
court."
That Maze and DuPre even
had the opportunity to win the
dual match for Stanford was
surprising in itself.
Crunch
The Bruins crunched Stan
ford, 8-1, two weeks ago in Los
Angeles, and they hadn't lost
more than two individual
matches to any one school this
year.
But as play moved into
Maples, the match score was 3-3.
Stanford's wins came from Mark
Mitchell at fourth singles, con
sistent Perry Wright at sixth
singles and Wright and Matt
Mitchell at third doubles.
That set up what had to be one
of the most spectacular perfor
mances of any college player in
the country this year. Maze
broke out of his slump to not
only beat, but rout, Teacher, the
top ranked amateur in the U.S.
The score was 7-6, 6-2.
Teacher was off his game
slightly, and Maze was at his
best. The 6-3 sophomore rock
eted his first serve in as usual,
but this time his returns-of-serve

and groundstrokes were equally
sharp.
Greatest shots
Maze made some of the
greatest shots this side of Arthur
Ashe. Several times he scored
points on half-volleys, actually
meeting the ball when it was be
hind him.
A sequence of shots that put
Maze up 5-0 in the second set
exemplified his performance.
First he hit a backhand behind
the baseline facing in the oppo
site direction of the net. When
Teacher countered with a
"dink," Maze raced to the net
and not only reached the ball,
but hit a cross-court drop shot
that fell untouched.
Friday's match against USC
(14-4) also went down to the last
contest, which Stanford (10-3)
won to defeat the Trojans, 5-4.
Maze and DuPre topped Bruce
Manson and Chris Lewis, 6-4,
6-4, before a crowd of 3600 in
Maples.

FLOATING BACKHAND — Stanford's Pat DuPre floats across the baseline to return a shot from
UCLA's Peter Fleming in the No. 1 singles match Saturday night in Maples Pavilion. Fleming
prevailed, however, downing DuPre, 7-6, 6-4.
"I've never been so happy to
win a match . .. I'm telling you,"
said UCLA's Peter Fleming
Saturday night in Maples Pavil
ion after he and Brian Teacher
had helped give the Bruin tennis
team a 5-4 victory over Stanford.
"How much pressure was
there?" he asked rhetorically.
One fan offered an answer: "I
was shaking."
The game score is 4-4 in the
third and deciding set: Bill Maze
and Pat DuPre against Fleming
and Teacher. Stanford has won
four previous matches; UCLA
four. A win by Maze and DuPre
means:
—they have beaten the top two
amateurs in the country,
—the Cards have put an end to
the Bruins' two-year, 35-match
win streak, and
—Stanford has a chance to
take over the top spot in the na
tional rankings.
A loss by Maze and DuPre
means:
—a sincere pat on the back,
—applause for a great effort,
and

—a little more privacy in the
locker room.
Maze loses his serve, UCLA
goes up 5-4, and it looks like it's
all over. Fleming will serve for
the set and match and he hasn't
lost his serve all night in singles
or doubles.
Set to smash
With the point score at 2-1
(UCLA), Fleming gets set to
smash an overhead. The nearly
infallible 6-foot-5 junior will
naturally put the ball away and
the Bruins will have three match
points coming.
But wait.
Fleming stiffens up and hits
the ball into the net, evening the
score at 2-2. Maze then puts
Stanford ahead with a beautiful
forehand topspin return cross
court off his back foot.
Fleming hits the ball out over
the baseline on the next point
and Maze and DuPre have the
precious break. Spontaneous
applause and a standing ovation.
The game score is 5-5.
Things are looking good for
Stanford. Assuming DuPre
holds his serve, the worst the

Cards can do is go into a tie
breaker at 6-6.
But wait.
Ties score
Teacher ties the score at 3-3
with a backhand cross-court and
then Fleming unloads a back
hand return off DuPre's serve
for a winner. UCLA has broken
back to lead in games, 6-5.
With Teacher serving for the
match, DuPre hits a forehand
into the net and then another
over the baseline. Teacher and
Fleming lead 3-1 in the game.
This time it's really over. Triple
match point.
But wait.
Teacher double faults. Double
match point. Teacher serves to
DuPre, who blasts the ball right
back. The UCLA All-American,
an excellent net player, volleys
into the nylon.
The score is 3-3. UCLA has one
match point left. Teacher serves
to Maze and in the ensuing rally,
Fleming hits a shot down the
middle. Maze and DuPre wait at
the baseline and either could
probably return it by himself.
Both go for it
But they both go for it, clash
ing rackets, and popping the ball
up well in front of the net. Before
the ball landed, Fleming joyfully
jumped up in the air. Then the
ball hit the Sportface carpet and
it was official. This time it was
all over.
Stanford had come within one
point and a tiebreaker of beating
what is quite possibly the best
college tennis team of all time.
Fleming said afterward he
didn't expect such a close match.
"Jesus, I've been playing well.
I thought we were going to bowl
these guys over. But Maze
played like a fiend. DuPre has
never had much of a serve, but he
was serving the ball out of the
court."
That Maze and DuPre even
had the opportunity to win the
dual match for Stanford was
surprising in itself.
Crunch
The Bruins crunched Stan
ford, 8-1, two weeks ago in Los
Angeles, and they hadn't lost
more than two individual
matches to any one school this
year.
But as play moved into
Maples, the match score was 3-3.
Stanford's wins came from Mark
Mitchell at fourth singles, con
sistent Perry Wright at sixth
singles and Wright and Matt
Mitchell at third doubles.
That set up what had to be one
of the most spectacular perfor
mances of any college player in
the country this year. Maze
broke out of his slump to not
only beat, but rout, Teacher, the
top ranked amateur in the U.S.
The score was 7-6, 6-2.
Teacher was off his game
slightly, and Maze was at his
best. The 6-3 sophomore rock
eted his first serve in as usual,
but this time his returns-of-serve

and groundstrokes were equally
sharp.
Greatest shots
Maze made some of the
greatest shots this side of Arthur
Ashe. Several times he scored
points on half-volleys, actually
meeting the ball when it was be
hind him.
A sequence of shots that put
Maze up 5-0 in the second set
exemplified his performance.
First he hit a backhand behind
the baseline facing in the oppo
site direction of the net. When
Teacher countered with a
"dink," Maze raced to the net
and not only reached the ball,
but hit a cross-court drop shot
that fell untouched.
Friday's match against USC
(14-4) also went down to the last
contest, which Stanford (10-3)
won to defeat the Trojans, 5-4.
Maze and DuPre topped Bruce
Manson and Chris Lewis, 6-4,
6-4, before a crowd of 3600 in
Maples.

FLOATING BACKHAND — Stanford's Pat DuPre floats across the baseline to return a shot from
UCLA's Peter Fleming in the No. 1 singles match Saturday night in Maples Pavilion. Fleming
prevailed, however, downing DuPre, 7-6, 6-4.
"I've never been so happy to
win a match . .. I'm telling you,"
said UCLA's Peter Fleming
Saturday night in Maples Pavil
ion after he and Brian Teacher
had helped give the Bruin tennis
team a 5-4 victory over Stanford.
"How much pressure was
there?" he asked rhetorically.
One fan offered an answer: "I
was shaking."
The game score is 4-4 in the
third and deciding set: Bill Maze
and Pat DuPre against Fleming
and Teacher. Stanford has won
four previous matches; UCLA
four. A win by Maze and DuPre
means:
—they have beaten the top two
amateurs in the country,
—the Cards have put an end to
the Bruins' two-year, 35-match
win streak, and
—Stanford has a chance to
take over the top spot in the na
tional rankings.
A loss by Maze and DuPre
means:
—a sincere pat on the back,
—applause for a great effort,
and

—a little more privacy in the
locker room.
Maze loses his serve, UCLA
goes up 5-4, and it looks like it's
all over. Fleming will serve for
the set and match and he hasn't
lost his serve all night in singles
or doubles.
Set to smash
With the point score at 2-1
(UCLA), Fleming gets set to
smash an overhead. The nearly
infallible 6-foot-5 junior will
naturally put the ball away and
the Bruins will have three match
points coming.
But wait.
Fleming stiffens up and hits
the ball into the net, evening the
score at 2-2. Maze then puts
Stanford ahead with a beautiful
forehand topspin return cross
court off his back foot.
Fleming hits the ball out over
the baseline on the next point
and Maze and DuPre have the
precious break. Spontaneous
applause and a standing ovation.
The game score is 5-5.
Things are looking good for
Stanford. Assuming DuPre
holds his serve, the worst the

Cards can do is go into a tie
breaker at 6-6.
But wait.
Ties score
Teacher ties the score at 3-3
with a backhand cross-court and
then Fleming unloads a back
hand return off DuPre's serve
for a winner. UCLA has broken
back to lead in games, 6-5.
With Teacher serving for the
match, DuPre hits a forehand
into the net and then another
over the baseline. Teacher and
Fleming lead 3-1 in the game.
This time it's really over. Triple
match point.
But wait.
Teacher double faults. Double
match point. Teacher serves to
DuPre, who blasts the ball right
back. The UCLA All-American,
an excellent net player, volleys
into the nylon.
The score is 3-3. UCLA has one
match point left. Teacher serves
to Maze and in the ensuing rally,
Fleming hits a shot down the
middle. Maze and DuPre wait at
the baseline and either could
probably return it by himself.
Both go for it
But they both go for it, clash
ing rackets, and popping the ball
up well in front of the net. Before
the ball landed, Fleming joyfully
jumped up in the air. Then the
ball hit the Sportface carpet and
it was official. This time it was
all over.
Stanford had come within one
point and a tiebreaker of beating
what is quite possibly the best
college tennis team of all time.
Fleming said afterward he
didn't expect such a close match.
"Jesus, I've been playing well.
I thought we were going to bowl
these guys over. But Maze
played like a fiend. DuPre has
never had much of a serve, but he
was serving the ball out of the
court."
That Maze and DuPre even
had the opportunity to win the
dual match for Stanford was
surprising in itself.
Crunch
The Bruins crunched Stan
ford, 8-1, two weeks ago in Los
Angeles, and they hadn't lost
more than two individual
matches to any one school this
year.
But as play moved into
Maples, the match score was 3-3.
Stanford's wins came from Mark
Mitchell at fourth singles, con
sistent Perry Wright at sixth
singles and Wright and Matt
Mitchell at third doubles.
That set up what had to be one
of the most spectacular perfor
mances of any college player in
the country this year. Maze
broke out of his slump to not
only beat, but rout, Teacher, the
top ranked amateur in the U.S.
The score was 7-6, 6-2.
Teacher was off his game
slightly, and Maze was at his
best. The 6-3 sophomore rock
eted his first serve in as usual,
but this time his returns-of-serve

and groundstrokes were equally
sharp.
Greatest shots
Maze made some of the
greatest shots this side of Arthur
Ashe. Several times he scored
points on half-volleys, actually
meeting the ball when it was be
hind him.
A sequence of shots that put
Maze up 5-0 in the second set
exemplified his performance.
First he hit a backhand behind
the baseline facing in the oppo
site direction of the net. When
Teacher countered with a
"dink," Maze raced to the net
and not only reached the ball,
but hit a cross-court drop shot
that fell untouched.
Friday's match against USC
(14-4) also went down to the last
contest, which Stanford (10-3)
won to defeat the Trojans, 5-4.
Maze and DuPre topped Bruce
Manson and Chris Lewis, 6-4,
6-4, before a crowd of 3600 in
Maples.
