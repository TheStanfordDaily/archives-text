was proud of all the girls for per

stated. "We hadn't really been
tested on the road in a dual meet,
and we found that it's harder to
win when you're away."
Stanford's only two losses

players battling it out for three
sets. In No. 1 singles, Lele

ahead" to take the match 7-5,

Jordan defeated the Bruins'
Paula Smith and Cindy Thomas,
6-3, 6-4, and the Trojans' team of
