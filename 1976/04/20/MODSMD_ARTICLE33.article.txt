## Gould juggles lineups to win 
### Vlae Kershner 
One week ago, Bill Maze was in such a
slump that he would have had trouble
beating a backboard.
But if you saw Maze destroy Brian
Teacher in straight sets Saturday night,
you know Maze now looks like he could
become Stanford's first tennis superstar
since Sandy Mayer.
Teacher, the nation's 23rd best player,
was so handcuffed by Maze's serve he
eventually began committing himself be
fore he knew where Maze's serve was go
ing. Even Sandy couldn't do that to
Teacher.
Maze's comeback, in part, was due to
yet another in a series of beneficial lineup
changes by coach Dick Gould. Seeing
Maze in a slump, Gould demoted him to
second singles behind Pat DuPre. With
the pressure off, Maze responded.
In the past four years, Gould has made a
number of lineup shifts. Most have
worked, if not always in assuaging the
egos of his stars, in producing victories.
Now Gould has to make another tricky
shift. He has to figure out where to fit in
Gene Mayer. It won't be easy.
Hurt a while
Mayer's been hurt for a while, but he
could have played singles this past
weekend. The trouble is that he doesn't
want to play below third singles. He's
right. Putting Gene Mayer at fourth or
fifth singles is like asking Picasso to paint
your house.
On the other hand, consider the feel
ings of Matt and Mark Mitchell, the Cards'
current third and fourth players. Matt, a
freshman, has worked hard all year, while
Mark, a senior, has worked hard for four

years, only to be regularly shunted aside
in favor of more talented, if less consis
tent, players. Meanwhile, Mayer has been
away from campus, playing in tourna
ments in the East.
If Mayer moves in at third singles, then
Matt and Mark will be competing for the
fourth singles slot, which is the key one
because only four players can go to the
NCAA Championships.
Mark certainly deserves to go to the
NCAAs. He's missed out on the singles
end of the tournament for the last three
years, during which time he's compiled
one of the best won-lost records ever seen,
35-6. I bet he'd do verv well in the
NCAAs.
Bitter feud
On the other hand, Gene also missed an
NCAA trip two years ago, after a bitter
feud with Nick Saviano which nearly
caused Mayer to transfer. And Gene, right
now, is probably the best player of the
three.
And you certainly can't expect Matt to
forego an NCAA trip, after having won
the number three slot in a series of chal
lenge matches.
Unless someone gets hurt or quits the
team, Gould will have a tough decision to
make, a decision I wouldn't like to have.
Tough lineup decisions are nothing
new to Gould. Three years ago, after one
of his best teams lost to both USC and
UCLA in Los Angeles, Gould demoted his
number four player, Gery Groslimond,
right out of the top six.
He catapulted a virtual unknown, Chip
Fisher, into the number five slot. The .
suit? Fisher, who never did anything in

singles before or since, played great ten
nis all year.
Two years ago, in an era of conflict
punctuated by the quitting of Sandy
Mayer and the Gene Mayer-Saviano tus
sle, Gould again made some hard lineup
decisions. He took a slumping Chico
Hagey right out of the top six, then put
hi m back at number three when Hagey got
his head and body both together.
Second title
All Hagey did was get to the NGAA
finals to clinch a second straight national
championship for the Cards.
Last season, Gould promoted Jim De
laney above both NGAA champion John
Whitlinger and supersoph Nick Saviano
when the latter two began slumping.
Saviano, thus knocked out of Maples
Pavilion (only the top two play in Maples),
took it hard. But it was a decision Gould
had to make.
Now this year. Stanford isn't that far
behind UCLA in talent. The Cards have a
good chance to win this year's UCLA Invi
tational (the successor to the now defunct
Pacific-8s). And a win over UCLA in the
invitational would give Stanford thegood
NCAA seedings it needs to have any
chance of overtaking the Bruins this year.
Will Maze move back up to the No. 1 or
will DuPre hold the position? Will Gene
Mayer and the Mitchell brothers all be
satisfied? How 'bout sixth singles; it's a
tossup between John Rast and Perry
Wright.
The success of the season depends on
Gould's decisions. But his track record
indicates he'll make the right ones.
