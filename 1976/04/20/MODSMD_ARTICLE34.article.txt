# Cardinal nine subdues Cal
## 
### Linda Buddenberg 
When Stanford's baseball
team came back Saturday to take
two games from California after
losing to the Bears on Friday, it
was just following Card baseball
coach Ray Young's prescription.
"We're not going to worry
about sweeps," the coach had
said before the games. "We're
going to take one game at a
time."
And that's just what the Stan
ford nine did. It didn't get down
after Friday's 10-6 loss. Instead,
it came back on Saturday with
back-to-back 5-3 and 4-1 wins on
the Bears' own turf.
Bear coach Jackie Jensen had
predicted a sweep over the
Cards, and the Cal team was
cocky Saturday morning. As the
day wore on, however, the Bear
dugout became noticeably more
subdued.
Eat his words
Besides making the Cal coach
eat his words, the nicest surprise
for the Cards Saturday was the
reliable performance of the Stan
ford bullpen. Bernie Hittner
came in to pickup his first win in
the first game, then Mike "Bird"
Williamson earned his first save
in the second game.
"Both of them had arm prob
lems before, but they're both
pitching a lot better now,"
Young said. "Since they're both
seniors, their experience could
be important for the rest of the
season.
"John Yandle (who started for
the Cards in Saturday's first
game) looked good, too," Young
added. "He's finally pitching up
to his capabilities."
Yandle, who had six strike
outs and gave up only two hits in
five innings, attributed his per
formance to an improved curve
ball.
"It was breaking a lot
sharper," he said. "I was also try
ing to throw a lot harder in gen
eral."
Injuries
The pitching staff's perfor
mance helped make up for an of
fense weakened by injuries.
Dave Perez and Cary Pitchford
were both hurt during Friday's
game and didn't suit up Satur
day.
Young said Pitchford will be

back for the weekend series
against UCLA, but Perez, who
hurt his knee while attempting a
double play, will be out indefi
nitely.
"The team knew that it really
had to pull together since we
were playing without those
guys," said Yandle.
The offensive attack Saturday
was led by Tom Guardino, who
went 5-for-9 for the day.
"It was a gutty performance all
the way around," said Young.
"Cal is a tough place to play —
the basepaths are soft, which is
tough on a running club like us."
'Mental mistakes'
"We made some mental mis
takes," Young added. "The im
portant thing is that we didn't
give up."
The Cards didn't give up Fri
day either, even after Cal opened
with six runs in the first two in
nings, including a first run
homer by Bear catcher Len Pat
terson.
"I was proud of these guys,"
said Young Friday. "They kept
hustling through the whole
game."
Some of the fire was taken out
of the Cardinal drive in a sixth
inning triple play. With Stanford
runners on first and second,
going on a hit-and-run play,
Gary Pitchford lined to the
shortstop who caught the ball for
the out and then dropped it
while trying to take it out of his
glove.
The shortstop threw to the
second baseman, who then
threw to the first baseman,
doubling up both runners.
Starter Rob Irwin took the loss
after giving up the six runs in the
first two innings. However, re
lievers Hittner and Williamson
each limited the Bears to two
runs in relief.
