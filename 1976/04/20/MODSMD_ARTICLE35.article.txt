# Speedy JV nine faces twin bills

### 
With doubleheaders today
and Thursday, Stanford JV
baseball coach Tom Dunton is
faced with the problem of how to
keep his pitchers rested.
Dunton says he will start Mark
Abbondola and Gerrv Komlofske
in today's games against St.
Mary's, but is "hopeful of getting
a lot of other pitchers in so those
two can come back Thursday."
The Cards were originally to
have played St. Mary's today,
but, Dunton explained, the
game had to be postponed since
many St. Mary's players were on
break.
Reviewing the team's statis
tics for the season, Dunton ob
served that the squad has 60 sto
len bases in 72 attempts, as Scott
Laurence leads the way with 11
steals in as many attempts.
Dunton explained that run
ning offsets the team's inconsis
tent hitting. "Our team batting
average is only .238, so we're not
wearing the ball out," he said.

"So we try to run to keep the
pressure on. So far it's worked
out pretty well."
Dave Johnson is the leading
pitcher for the Cards, Dunton
said, pointing to Johnson's 0.98
ERA and 2-0 record. "I wouldn't
say he's overpowering," Dunton
remarked, "but he's consistent
and very rarely hurts himself."
Jerry Battenburg has the
team's next lowest ERA, 1.62.
The Cards have three hitters
near .300. They are Richard
Bruzzone, .395; Kevin Triggs,
.324 and Brad Fox, .297.
