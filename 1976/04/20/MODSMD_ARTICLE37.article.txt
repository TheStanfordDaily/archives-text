# Provides key fifth, sixth men
## Golf 'pack' struggles to join varsity 
### Chris Kamel 
It's called the "pack." At times it's re
sembled a pack of wolves, but the
nickname for the group seeking a spot on
the Stanford men's golf team comes from
something else.
"We got the name from the group of
players that qualify for the Masters," said
Stanford golf coach Hud Finger. "They
are known as the pack."
With last year's graduation of golfers
Aly Trompas and Dave Baskins. the im
portance of the pack has grown this sea
son. Not only have pack members beat out
varsity members, but Finger has looked to
the pack in the late going of this season to
fill the fifth and sixth spots of his team.
And so the success of pack representa
tives have determined the success of the
team.
"In tournaments where all six scores
count, pretty much the play of the fifth
and sixth man has determined the results
of the team's finish," Finger said. This
was most aptly illustrated in the Fresno
Classic two weeks ago where Mike Peck
and Jay Johnston finished in the top 10
individually for Stanford but their play
was offset by the scores of the last men on
the team. The team ended up in eighth
place.
How does a member of the pack make
the varsity lineup?

The process is a measure of the player's
endurance as much as his talent. To have
a shot at the lineup, a pack member must
shoot six rounds in a week. The member
of the pack with the lowest average of the
week challenges the varsity member with
the worst scores of the week. The winner
of this playoff round makes the varsity
team. So, in effect, every varsity player's
position is in potential jeopardy each
week.
How do the varsity players feel about
this constant pressure? All players say
they feel this system is the only way to
determine who deserves to play for the
team.
"It's a very good system," said varsity
No. 1 man Mike Peck. "It keeps all the
varsity players on their toes. They play
seriously and with concentration, which
is the only way golf can he played suc
cessfully."
According to Finger, the pack has not
produced as much this season as he was
hoping it would.
Three playerswhomhewas banking on
for fine performances were seniors Ed
Elordi and Tom Mason and sophomore
Lyn Pittinger. Mason qualified seventh
for the team last winter, one stroke back,
while Elordi qualified ninth.
These three quit the team, however, be
cause of other commitments and thus

weakened the potential of the pack.
"We lost three fine players in Mason,
Elordi and Pittinger, and the effects are
starting to surface," Finger said. "How
ever, the rest of the pack has not played up
to its potential."
At the moment, the average round for
the pack is 79, eight strokes over par on
the Stanford par-71 course.
Finger says his main concern, though,
"is that someone will shoot a really good
round one day, but that they can't keep it
up long enough to make a valuable con
tribution to the team."
Finger is trying to remedy the situation
before the NCAA Championships. Ac
cording to the Stanford coach, he has
some fine people in the pack in Doug
Rice. Wade Nonnemberg and Bruce Car
dinal, and any one of these players could
start playing consistently enough to help
the team.
"We have a very good chance to go to
the NCAAs with our second place finish
in the Western Collegiate Champion
ships," Finger said. "But remember that
the team total only included four scores
and not six."
Therefore, according to Finger, the fifth
and sixth men when included in the team
total might make a difference. The pack
holds Stanford's Pacific-fl and NCAA
hopes in the balance.
