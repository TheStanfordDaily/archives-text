# Laxmen squeak past Berkeley, 14-12
## 
### Leonard Gumlia 
While most Stanford sports
fans were commuting between
the track and the tennis courts
Saturday, much of the action
that day was taking place at the
Lacrosse Field.
The Stanford lacrosse team
upped its record to 7-2 with a
tense 14-12 double overtime vic
tory over the Berkeley Lacrosse
Club.
After watching leads of 5-0
and 10-6 evaporate, the Cards
found themselves down by one
with less than a minute to play.
And in a sport where possession
is all-important, Berkeley gained
control and went into a semi
stall.
But enter Stanford's Greg
Hoberg, who does everything for
the Cards except sell programs.
He scored five goals and added
two assists Saturday, but no play
was bigger than his last score.
Picking up a loose ball near
midfield. Hoberg raced in on the
right side and beat Berkeley
goalie Victor Wong low in the
left corner from 30 feet. There
were only 33 seconds remaining
to play.
The spot
Hoberg, a Pennsylvanian who
learned to play the game out

East where it is more firmly es
tablished, noted that he just
wasn't shooting at the net,
either. "When I have time, I pick
a spot. And I had time."
That goal made it 12-all and
sent the match into overtime.
The first four-minute period was
scoreless, but Berkeley control
led the play. Its best chance came
when Dan Miller whistled a shot
off the pipe from 40 feet.
The second overtime was all
Stanford, Hoberg went into his
act, controlling the ball for 15
seconds, then made a perfect
centering pass to Jon Sprole at

the edge of the crease. Sprole
simply deflected the pass by
Wong for the winning goal and
his second score of the after
noon.
Minutes later, Hoberg helped
clinch the victory when his re
bound was batted in by Whit
Budge, his third goal of the day.
Budge has 29 points in nine
games, and he teams with
Hoberg, who has 42 points, to
give the Cards a tough one-two
punch.
Scoring help
The Cards also got scoring
help from their defense, most

notably Tom Davies and Larry
Wexler. Davies, who is new to
the sport, scored once and went
the length of the field to set up
Budge on another occasion.
Stanford also got goals from
Joe Stratton, Phil Chaplin and
Don Stewart. Berkeley was led
by Stu Blackburn and Bill Bar
ton, each with three goals. Bar
ton lead the rally that brought
Berkeley to its one-goal lead late
in the game.
Stanford coach Sam Sadtler
said he was pleased with the vic
tory. "Good teams come from
behind," he said. "They did a
hell of a job, and I'm proud of
them."
This Sunday, the laxmen re
sume league play in the North
ern California Lacrosse Associa
tion (NCLA) with a home game
against Claremont Men's.
According to Sadtler, the
NCLA was formed to improve
the chances of the Cards receiv
ing NCAA recognition. "To get
recognized," he said, "we have
to get other schools playing. We
need the competition."
Claremont should provide
plenty of competition. Both
Stanford and Claremont are un
defeated in league play, and
Card players say the game may
decide the NCLA champion.

The second overtime was all
Stanford, Hoberg went into his
act, controlling the ball for 15
seconds, then made a perfect
centering pass to Jon Sprole at

the edge of the crease. Sprole
simply deflected the pass by
Wong for the winning goal and
his second score of the after
noon.
Minutes later, Hoberg helped
clinch the victory when his re
bound was batted in by Whit
Budge, his third goal of the day.
Budge has 29 points in nine
games, and he teams with
Hoberg, who has 42 points, to
give the Cards a tough one-two
punch.
Scoring help
The Cards also got scoring
help from their defense, most

notably Tom Davies and Larry
Wexler. Davies, who is new to
the sport, scored once and went
the length of the field to set up
Budge on another occasion.
Stanford also got goals from
Joe Stratton, Phil Chaplin and
Don Stewart. Berkeley was led
by Stu Blackburn and Bill Bar
ton, each with three goals. Bar
ton lead the rally that brought
Berkeley to its one-goal lead late
in the game.
Stanford coach Sam Sadtler
said he was pleased with the vic
tory. "Good teams come from
behind," he said. "They did a
hell of a job, and I'm proud of
them."
This Sunday, the laxmen re
sume league play in the North
ern California Lacrosse Associa
tion (NCLA) with a home game
against Claremont Men's.
According to Sadtler, the
NCLA was formed to improve
the chances of the Cards receiv
ing NCAA recognition. "To get
recognized," he said, "we have
to get other schools playing. We
need the competition."
Claremont should provide
plenty of competition. Both
Stanford and Claremont are un
defeated in league play, and
Card players say the game may
decide the NCLA champion.

GOAL GETTER — Greg Hoberg (left), high scorer for the Stanford lacrosse team, staves off a check
from a Berkeley opponent in action Saturday at Stanford. The Cards won 14-12 as Hoberg tallied
five goals and two assists. The Berkeley squad consisted primarily of graduate students at Califor
nia.
While most Stanford sports
fans were commuting between
the track and the tennis courts
Saturday, much of the action
that day was taking place at the
Lacrosse Field.
The Stanford lacrosse team
upped its record to 7-2 with a
tense 14-12 double overtime vic
tory over the Berkeley Lacrosse
Club.
After watching leads of 5-0
and 10-6 evaporate, the Cards
found themselves down by one
with less than a minute to play.
And in a sport where possession
is all-important, Berkeley gained
control and went into a semi
stall.
But enter Stanford's Greg
Hoberg, who does everything for
the Cards except sell programs.
He scored five goals and added
two assists Saturday, but no play
was bigger than his last score.
Picking up a loose ball near
midfield. Hoberg raced in on the
right side and beat Berkeley
goalie Victor Wong low in the
left corner from 30 feet. There
were only 33 seconds remaining
to play.
The spot
Hoberg, a Pennsylvanian who
learned to play the game out

East where it is more firmly es
tablished, noted that he just
wasn't shooting at the net,
either. "When I have time, I pick
a spot. And I had time."
That goal made it 12-all and
sent the match into overtime.
The first four-minute period was
scoreless, but Berkeley control
led the play. Its best chance came
when Dan Miller whistled a shot
off the pipe from 40 feet.
The second overtime was all
Stanford, Hoberg went into his
act, controlling the ball for 15
seconds, then made a perfect
centering pass to Jon Sprole at
