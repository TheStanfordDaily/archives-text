After the Stanford men gol
fers' eighth place finish in the
Fresno Classic two weeks ago,
many people thought the golfers
had taken an extended spring
vacation. Well, if they did,
they're back and they have al
ready taken care of business at
hand.
The Cards, expected by tour
nament organizers to finish from
fifth to 10th place at the Western
Collegiate Championships in
Santa Cruz last week, finished
second in the 17 team field with
a score of 905.
The showing should assure
the Cards of an invitation to the
NCAAs since Stanford had to
finish in the top three of the
tournament to qualify.

Stanford was paced by
sophomore Mike Peck, whose
three round total of 224 tied him
for 10th place individually, fay
Johnston placed 13th with 225.
Really up
"We were really 'up' for this
tournament," Peck said "We
knew we had to do well before
the tournament in order to be
considered for the nationals."
The Cards were so up for their
competition they found them
selves in first place after the first
round of play Wednesday.
According to Peck, everyone
did very well that first day of
competition. It was the second
round on Thursday which sepa
rated the teams. That day the gol
fers had to fight tough winds in
the area. In fact, there were gale
warnings posted in the Santa
Cruz area.
"We stayed in there that sec
ond day," coach Bud Finger
said. "We had to, it was the only
day in which we could get a
break in our favor."
The break
The Cards got the break they
needed that day, as Peck shot a
74 which jetted him into fourth
place and set him up for his 10th
place finish.
Finger said he was most
pleased by the play of his third
and fourth men. Bruce
McDonald and Doug Rice came
up with three day totals of 227
and 229 and gave the Cards the
lift they needed in what turned
out to be a very close tourna
ment.
Stanford ended up only one
stroke ahead of third place
Arizona State and two strokes in
front of fourth place USC in the
tournament at Pasatiempo Coif
Course. Brigham Young was
first, 37 strokes ahead of Stan
ford.
"We really needed this
finish." said Finger. "We have
the Stanford United States Col
legiate Invitational coming up
and some of our guys need a lit
tle confidence-building." The
tournament is scheduled for
Thursday through Saturday on
the Stanford course.
The Card coach said he hopes
the last men can get something
going and help out the rest of the
team.
