# Increase in Teaching Assistants
## GSC reacts favorably to aid proposals 
### William Sposato 
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) reacted favorably yesterday to a
proposal to increase the number of
teaching assistants (TAs) in under
graduate courses.
The proposal, part of a report com
piled by CISC Chairman Deric Jen
nings, aims to boost the fellowship
money graduate students receive.
Grad students have said present levels
of graduate student aid are not suffi

cient to live on.
Increasing the number of TAs would
have a two-fold benefit, the council
concluded. First, teaching assistants
are paid more per quarter than stu
dents receiving fellowship grants.
Second, the plan would not deplete
the graduate aids fund because TAs are
paid from a separate University ac
count.
Assoc. Dean of Graduate Studies Ar
thur Walker said that the number of
teaching assistants in many courses is
inadequate, and by increasing the
number of assistants undergraduate
education would also be helped.
Fellowships are financial awards
given to students without any special
obligation on their part. Almost all
Ph.D. candidates are on either a Stan
ford fellowship, or one from a private
foundation, Walker said.
Sizable increase?
Jennings' report said that a sizable
increase in the funds available for fel
lowships did not seem likely.
An increase of four to five percent
for fellowships and teaching assistants
is planned to go into effect .Sept. 1, but
Jennings said they are a "a woefully
insufficient step in the right direc
tion."
With the increases, teaching assis
tants will receive $1050 per quarter,
and the maximum fellowship support
will be $2400 per academic year.
This amount is well below what is
paid by comparable institutions.
Walker said. Hut he pointed out that
the University typically supports its
people for a longer period of time.
The council also discussed the idea
of redistributing fellowship grants,
with more promising candidates re
ceiving higher awards. Council
member Dick Karp said that the entire
award system is based on relative
merit, and awarding different amounts
to candidates would merely be an ex
tension of this system.

Another council member asserted
that it would be extremely difficult to
determine someone's worth four years
in the future, while different-size
grants could be demoralizing to some
students.
The council briefly discussed the
possibility of awarding fellowships on
. need basis. Walker said the dean of
graduate studies had studied the pos
sibility of distributing aid in this man
ner a few years ago, but the idea had
been rejected.
The council also urged the
graduate deari s office to simplify the

process for applying for outside fel
lowships from private foundations.
One member suggested a book be
compiled listing all foundations that
regularly award fellowships.
Walker replied that this list already
exists, and is available in the dean's
office.
The fellowship question applies
mostly to the humanities departments,
since most money for engineering and
sciences comes in the form of research
grants. Of the $1.5 million in the
graduate aid fund, only $18,000 is set
aside for the sciences, according to
Walker.

for fellowships and teaching assistants
is planned to go into effect .Sept. 1, but
Jennings said they are a "a woefully
insufficient step in the right direc
tion."
With the increases, teaching assis
tants will receive $1050 per quarter,
and the maximum fellowship support
will be $2400 per academic year.
This amount is well below what is
paid by comparable institutions.
Walker said. Hut he pointed out that
the University typically supports its
people for a longer period of time.
The council also discussed the idea
of redistributing fellowship grants,
with more promising candidates re
ceiving higher awards. Council
member Dick Karp said that the entire
award system is based on relative
merit, and awarding different amounts
to candidates would merely be an ex
tension of this system.

Another council member asserted
that it would be extremely difficult to
determine someone's worth four years
in the future, while different-size
grants could be demoralizing to some
students.
The council briefly discussed the
possibility of awarding fellowships on
. need basis. Walker said the dean of
graduate studies had studied the pos
sibility of distributing aid in this man
ner a few years ago, but the idea had
been rejected.
The council also urged the
graduate deari s office to simplify the

process for applying for outside fel
lowships from private foundations.
One member suggested a book be
compiled listing all foundations that
regularly award fellowships.
Walker replied that this list already
exists, and is available in the dean's
office.
The fellowship question applies
mostly to the humanities departments,
since most money for engineering and
sciences comes in the form of research
grants. Of the $1.5 million in the
graduate aid fund, only $18,000 is set
aside for the sciences, according to
Walker.
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) reacted favorably yesterday to a
proposal to increase the number of
teaching assistants (TAs) in under
graduate courses.
The proposal, part of a report com
piled by CISC Chairman Deric Jen
nings, aims to boost the fellowship
money graduate students receive.
Grad students have said present levels
of graduate student aid are not suffi

cient to live on.
Increasing the number of TAs would
have a two-fold benefit, the council
concluded. First, teaching assistants
are paid more per quarter than stu
dents receiving fellowship grants.
Second, the plan would not deplete
the graduate aids fund because TAs are
paid from a separate University ac
count.
Assoc. Dean of Graduate Studies Ar
thur Walker said that the number of
teaching assistants in many courses is
inadequate, and by increasing the
number of assistants undergraduate
education would also be helped.
Fellowships are financial awards
given to students without any special
obligation on their part. Almost all
Ph.D. candidates are on either a Stan
ford fellowship, or one from a private
foundation, Walker said.
Sizable increase?
Jennings' report said that a sizable
increase in the funds available for fel
lowships did not seem likely.
An increase of four to five percent
for fellowships and teaching assistants
is planned to go into effect .Sept. 1, but
Jennings said they are a "a woefully
insufficient step in the right direc
tion."
With the increases, teaching assis
tants will receive $1050 per quarter,
