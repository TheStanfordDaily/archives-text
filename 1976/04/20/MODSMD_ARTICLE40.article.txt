# No records broken
## Baron trackmen lose to UCLA 
### Bruce Anderson 
Saturday's "mini-Olympic"
preview of the track and field
powers of UCLA and USC at
Stanford Stadium saw the
Bruins whip Stanford, 89-56,
and the Trojans ease by Califor
nia, 100-45.
And while the crowd of 17,000
didn't see any stadium records
fall, as times were slowed by
windy conditions, it did witness
Cal's James Robinson and Stan
ford's James Lofton upset their
highly touted southern Califor
nia opponents.
The last time the James boys
appeared in Stanford Stadium
they won Northern Cal Perfor
mers of the Week laurels for their
head to head showdown in the
mile relay.
Lofton and UCLA's Willie
Banks both came into the meet
undefeated in this year's dual
meet season, but only Lofton
emerged unscathed. Banks drew
a big reaction from Saturday's
responsive crowd with a jump of
24-foot-5V4, but it was short of
Lofton's mark of 24-9V2.
Co-leaders
The Trojans' Rayfield Beaton
and the Bears' Robinson entered
the 800 meters as co-leaders in
thePacific-8, both having season
bests of 1:48.6. As the race began
it appeared Beaton might run
away from the field as he quickly
moved to an eight yard lead.
Robinson trailed him from
that distance until the final half
lap. He caught Beaton on the
curve, passed him coming into
the straightaway and then broke
the tape at 1:46.9, two-tenths of a

second ahead of Beaton.
Robber Baron coach Payton
Jordan said after the meet, "The
800 meters was the race of the
meet and Robinson was the
athlete of the meet." Nonethe
less Jordan continued, "It was
little (Tony) Sandoval who cap
tured the hearts of the crowd."
Sandoval, who has already
qualified for the Olympic
marathon trials in Eugene next
month, was running his last race
at home and was going after Don
Kardong's school record in the
three-mile (13:20.8) and the
stadium record for the 5000 met
ers (13:55.6).
Too fast
But the senior from Los
Alamos, N.M., could not do it
alone. Sandoval went out too fast
with a 4:24 first mile and was
running by himself after the ini
tial lap and a half.
The effects of running alone
and the fast early pace took hold,
though, andSandovalfinished in
14:10.6, 40 seconds ahead of the
rest of the field.
Three other seniors, John Mac
rorie, John Foster and Jack Bel
lah, turned in winning perfor
mances in their last appearances
in Stanford Stadium. Macrorie
racked up his fifth javelin win in
six meets with a toss of 214-1.
Foster equalled his lifetime
best of 13.9 in the high hurdles
with a second place finish, and
then returned later in the after
noon to take the 400 meter in
termediates in 53.9.
Bellah set a meet record in the
3000 meter steeplechase which
was held as a non-scoring event.
Bellah's time of 9:06.0 broke the
record set in 1970 by Brook
Thomas of 9:09.0. It was the
third fastest steeplechase ever
for a Baron runner and a per
sonal best for the senior from Los
Gatos.
Stanford added another win in
the distances as junior Jeff
Parietti ran to an easy 1500 meter
victory.

the straightaway and then broke
the tape at 1:46.9, two-tenths of a

second ahead of Beaton.
Robber Baron coach Payton
Jordan said after the meet, "The
800 meters was the race of the
meet and Robinson was the
athlete of the meet." Nonethe
less Jordan continued, "It was
little (Tony) Sandoval who cap
tured the hearts of the crowd."
Sandoval, who has already
qualified for the Olympic
marathon trials in Eugene next
month, was running his last race
at home and was going after Don
Kardong's school record in the
three-mile (13:20.8) and the
stadium record for the 5000 met
ers (13:55.6).
Too fast
But the senior from Los
Alamos, N.M., could not do it
alone. Sandoval went out too fast
with a 4:24 first mile and was
running by himself after the ini
tial lap and a half.
The effects of running alone
and the fast early pace took hold,
though, andSandovalfinished in
14:10.6, 40 seconds ahead of the
rest of the field.
Three other seniors, John Mac
rorie, John Foster and Jack Bel
lah, turned in winning perfor
mances in their last appearances
in Stanford Stadium. Macrorie
racked up his fifth javelin win in
six meets with a toss of 214-1.
Foster equalled his lifetime
best of 13.9 in the high hurdles
with a second place finish, and
then returned later in the after
noon to take the 400 meter in
termediates in 53.9.
Bellah set a meet record in the
3000 meter steeplechase which
was held as a non-scoring event.
Bellah's time of 9:06.0 broke the
record set in 1970 by Brook
Thomas of 9:09.0. It was the
third fastest steeplechase ever
for a Baron runner and a per
sonal best for the senior from Los
Gatos.
Stanford added another win in
the distances as junior Jeff
Parietti ran to an easy 1500 meter
victory.
Saturday's "mini-Olympic"
preview of the track and field
powers of UCLA and USC at
Stanford Stadium saw the
Bruins whip Stanford, 89-56,
and the Trojans ease by Califor
nia, 100-45.
And while the crowd of 17,000
didn't see any stadium records
fall, as times were slowed by
windy conditions, it did witness
Cal's James Robinson and Stan
ford's James Lofton upset their
highly touted southern Califor
nia opponents.
The last time the James boys
appeared in Stanford Stadium
they won Northern Cal Perfor
mers of the Week laurels for their
head to head showdown in the
mile relay.
Lofton and UCLA's Willie
Banks both came into the meet
undefeated in this year's dual
meet season, but only Lofton
emerged unscathed. Banks drew
a big reaction from Saturday's
responsive crowd with a jump of
24-foot-5V4, but it was short of
Lofton's mark of 24-9V2.
Co-leaders
The Trojans' Rayfield Beaton
and the Bears' Robinson entered
the 800 meters as co-leaders in
thePacific-8, both having season
bests of 1:48.6. As the race began
it appeared Beaton might run
away from the field as he quickly
moved to an eight yard lead.
Robinson trailed him from
that distance until the final half
lap. He caught Beaton on the
curve, passed him coming into
the straightaway and then broke
the tape at 1:46.9, two-tenths of a

second ahead of Beaton.
