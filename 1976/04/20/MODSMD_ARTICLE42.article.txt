Israelis kill Arab rioter
JERICHO — Israeli soldiers shot and killed an
Arab man yesterday as West Bank Arabs continued
to protest a two-day march by thousands of Israeli
Jews demanding their government annex occupied
Jordanian land.
An Israeli military communique said a patrol was
"attacked this morning by a large group of rioters in
an alley of the casbah in Nablus. The patrol fired a
number of warning shots and as a result three per
sons were hit."
One of the wounded, a 55-year-old man, died
while being rushed to a hospital, the communique
said.
He was the sixth Arab casualty in a wave of anti-
Israeli riots by the 670,000 West Bank Arabs since
February.
Shortly before the shooting incident was an
nounced, the Jewish marchers arrived in Jericho,
dry and dusty at the end of a 24-mile trek across the
desert.
An estimated 20,000 to 40,000 Israelis took part
in the march organized by the right-wing Gush
Emunim, or Loyalist Bloc, which claims the West
Bank is part of the land promised to the Jews by
God. They want Israel to keep the land it captured
from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war and allow
Jewish settlement near this biblical city.
FBI shoots hijacker
GRAND ISLAND, Neb. — Roger Lentz was killed
yesterday by FBI agents as he took two hostages and
tried to hijack a plane to Mexico.
Lentz, 31, of Marquette, Neb., was shot at Den
ver's Stapleton airport as he was inspecting the
Convair 990 jet which he thought was his ticket to
Mexico.
Lentz had threatened his hostages if "anyone
even budges me." But FBI agents hid aboard the
plane, one under the floorboard, and shot Lentz to
end a tense seven-hour drama with no injury to the
hostages.
When Lentz boarded the airline jet, with hostage
Robert Blair walking ahead of him, he moved to the
rear of the plane to check the pilots' identification.
Blair noticed FBI agents on the floor between the
seats as he walked to the rear, and when he passed,
the agents rose up and fired at Lentz. Lentz appa
rently fired one shot, which went into the wall,
according to officials.
Pilots Gal Sefton and Doug Underwood said "five
or six FBI agents" were on the plane, one hiding in a
radio compartment under the floorboard. The two
men said six shots were fired, all of which hit Lentz.
High court hears 'gag' case
WASHINGTON — The news media asked the
Supreme Court yesterday to bar lower courts from

restricting news coverage of pending criminal
trials.
But a Nebraska prosecutor, who obtained a con
viction in a mass murder case after a so-called gag
order was imposed, argued that the orders are
needed to protect the rights of defendants.
The court heard arguments for the first time on
the constitutionality of the so-called gag orders. It is
expected to reach a decision by June.
Milton Larson, county attorney of Lincoln
County, Neb., told the court he sought the restric
tive order because he thought it was his responsi
bility as a prosecutor to "take reasonable steps to
protect the individual's right to a fair trial."
Larson obtained a court order under which repor
ters, although they were allowed to attend the hear
ing and take notes, could not report the testimony.
12 die in Indian slum riot
NEW DELHI, India — Slum dwellers fought a
bloody conflict with police yesterday to prevent the
razing of their shacks and forced resettlement. As
many as five policemen and seven slum dwellers
were reported killed and dozens more injured.
The fight with police and city demolition crews
was the first known open resistance to a massive
New Delhi face-lifting program started shortly after
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi proclaimed a na
tional emergency and suspended most civil liber
ties last June.
The federally controlled Delhi administration
has said that at least 250,000 slum dwellers, gener
ally lower caste poor living in shacks near their
places of work, have been moved to resettlement
sites outside the city.
Economy shapes up
WASHINGTON — The nation's economy grew at
an annual rate of 7.5 percent in the first quarter of
1976, an unexpectedly big gain that placed total
economic output at near the prerecession peak, the
government reported yesterday.
Maynard Comiez, acting chief economist for the
Commerce Department, said it was virtually certain
that the economy would grow at least 6.5 percent
and "maybe somewhat more" during all of 1976.
This would be an improvement over the Ford ad
ministration's official forecast for growth of 6.2
percent.
The government also reported that the nation's
over-all inflation rate in the January-March period
was 3.7 percent, the lowest quarterly inflation rate
in more than three years.
The figures show that the economy continued to
recover from recession at a healthy rate with a
bonus of low inflation. For Americans, a continua
tion of the trend would mean a steady rise in the
number of jobs available with incomes likely to
increase faster than prices.

Both the figures on economic growth and infla
tion were contained in theCommerce Department's
report on the nation's first-quarter Gross National
Product, which measures the value of the total out
put of goods and services in the economy.
The GNP now has increased for four consecutive
quarters, following five quarters of decline during
the recession.
Grain export check begins
NEW ORLEANS — Forty federal inspectors,
many of whom were just children when cheating
began at Mississippi River export grain elevators,
reported for duty yesterday to begin the task of
keeping the $12 billion business scandal-free.
The arrival of the inspectors, fresh from a five
week training course, comes after two years of in
vestigation and court action in which there have
been 100 indictments and 60 convictions.
The new inspectors, who will watch over some
200 private and state grain graders, precede by a
few weeks another 80 inspectors scheduled to bols
ter the grain division of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture in New Orleans, the port from which4o
percent of all exported grain leaves.
By midsummer, the number of federal grain in
spectors here will be tripled, from the 60 who were
here when the scandals broke to 180, by transfers
and addition of newly trained personnel.
Along with the hurried USDA expansion, fi
nanced by an emergency $5 million congressional
appropriation, Congress is considering whether the
federal government should take overall inspection
and weighing of grain exports.
Church calls Ford 'weak'
WASHINGTON — Calling President Ford a
"weak" chief executive, Sen. Frank Church of
Idaho said yesterday that if he were president he
would "stop paying big business to leave the coun
try" and stop U.S. intervention in "needless foreign
wars."
In a five-minute nationally televised address,
Church said it is "a weak president who pardons
Richard Nixon for all the crimes he committed in
the White House and then looks the other way
while Nixon's lieutenants stand trial."
Church, a candidate for the Democratic presiden
tial nomination,also termed Ford a weak president
for failing to punish American intelligence agen
cies which he said were guilty of wrongdoing.
