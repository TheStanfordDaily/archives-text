## Roble selected as priority house 
### Pan Demetrakakes 
The native American priority house
for next year will be RobleHall,instead
of Gavilan House in Florence Moore
Hall, Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton announced Thursday.
Gavilan will become a freshman
dorm next year.
Although native American students
will have priority for assignment to
Roble, Horton emphasized, "We are
not in any way turning Roble into a
theme house. All that sort of prog
ramming is done in the native Ameri
can cultural center."
Horton said that the decision to
have Roble as the native American
priority house was made after he was
approached by a delegation of native
American students. They requested
that native American students receive
priority for Roble "primarily because
of the resident fellow," David Haskin,
who is extensively interested in native
American affairs, Horton said.
Problems
Two problems with the current na
tive American priority at Gavilan were
that "there are virtually no single
rooms" there and "not many native
Americans choose to live in the
house," said Horton.

Currently, five native American stu
dents live in Gavilan.
Henjie Atencio, one of the students
who met with Horton, said, "All we're
asking for is priority at the house. We
don't want a theme program there and
we didn't ask for it."
Atencio said non-native American
students in Gavilan showed "little in
terest" in native American activities,
and added that he does not expect the
situation to improve in Roble.
He predicted that a "maximum of
10 to 20" native American stu
dents will live in Roble. However, ac
cording to Lucia Meoe, a recruiter at
the Stanford American Indian Organi
zation, "There are only three who are
committed to Roble."
Haskin commented that the priority
arrangement "meant five people in
Gavilan, and I suspect it will mean five
people in Roble. The same conditions
apply here, and I don't think the result
will be different."
He added, "There will only be eight
new native American students next
year."
Previous troubles
David Mundy, a junior who lived in
Roble when it was the black residence
priority house two years ago, men
tioned several problems involved with
the use of Roble as a minority priority
house.
"One of the problems was that it was
just too large to get a lot of activities
going. Everybody got separated into
what wing they were on. If you lived in
'A' wing you never saw the people in
'C' wing.
"Because it was so large, we
couldn't get a good concentration of
blacks," he said.
Atencio denied that the dispersal of
native American students over a dorm
the size of Roble will present a prob
lem
"We're trying to see if we can ar
range for the native American students
to be grouped in one section," said
Meoe. However, "Horton said he
couldn't make special arrangements
for native American students," she
said.
