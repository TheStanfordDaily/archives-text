# Frats confident of meeting quota

### Stephen Crolius 
The fraternity system will meet its
1976-77 "Fair Share Quota" in this
spring's rush if current trends con
tinue, Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
Rush Chairman Tim Ferguson pre
dicted yesterday.
"If the interest shown thus far is
maintained through the next two
weeks, we'll not only meet our quota
by a good margin, but more impor
tantly, we'll do it with a damn good
bunch of guys," he said.
The fraternity rush, already under
way for two weeks, will continue
through this week.
Attendance figures for fraternity
parties, open houses and other events
have exceeded those of last year for
most houses in the system, according
to Ferguson.
Confidence bolstered
Although Ferguson expressed con
cern last quarter that the fraternity sys
tem would not reach its quota of 234
sophomore equivalents, he said his
confidence had been bolstered by an
evaluation of the first two weeks of the
rush.

A sophomore equivalent is defined
in theGuaranteed Housing Plan as any
student with two years of guaranteed
housing. A junior with only one
guaranteed year remaining thus
counts as one half of a sophomore
equivalent.
Delta Kappa Epsilon (Dek.es) Presi
dent Ken Callander called this year's
rush "great," saying that attendance at
Delta Kappa Epsilon rush events is far
above last year's.
The Dekes missed their quota last
year by 3 V2 spaces. They thus face pos
sible annexation and incorporation
into the regular University housing
system if they do not meet their quota
this year.
But this is not a likelihood, accord
ing to Callander.
'Way over'
"We're planning on going way over
the quota with no problem," he said.
Attendance of Phi Delta Theta (Phi
Delts) rush events is up 20 percent
from last year, according to Phi Delt
Rush Chairman Matt Mavor. "We
won't have any problem at all in mak
ing our quota," he said yesterday.
The fraternity system must attract
the 234 sophomore equivalents in

order to fill its rated occupancy of 561
spaces while a percentage of its mem
bers spend their year off campus. The
figure of 561 spaces represents just
under 18 percent of all housing co
vered by the Guaranteed Housing
Plan.

vered by the Guaranteed Housing
Plan.
