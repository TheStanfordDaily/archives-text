# Report submitted to Lyons
## Bonfire still alive 
### Stephen Crolius 
The Big Game Bonfire issue seems to
have survived the winter and all signs
suggest that it will be with us for some
time to come.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Thomas Massey said yesterday that he
has written a recommendation based
on a meeting concerning the bonfire
held in January by representatives
from the Inter-Fraternity Council and
the Council of Presidents.
He said his report, which he will
submit to Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons today, contains nothing
surprising.
"I'm suggesting a number of ways to
get rid of the bad elements (of the bon
fire)," Massey said. "The biggest ele
ments (to consider) are safety and
crowd control."
He suggested that the aspect of the
blaze that drew the most attention last
year, its size, should also be consi
dered next year.
He also said that he feels the plan
ning and execution of the fire should

be "more broadly based." He men
tioned the possibility of working with
the senior class officers with the objec
tive of involving the senior class in the
event.
Lyons said last week that he had
been "trying to leave it (the bonfire
issue) alone for a while."
He mentioned the possibility of pol
ling the student body later this quarter
in order to ascertain its opinions on the
matter, saying "I think we'll have one
more go around with it (the bonfire
issue). But it's best left to being a stu
dent matter."
Lyons agreed with Massey on crowd
control. "The issue that's going to be
the most troublesome is the security
issue — the drunken teenagers and the
rock throwing," said Lyons. "I
don't know how we're going to cope
with that."
Asked whether he thought the same
amount of controversy would sur
round the "non-issue" next year.
Lyons replied, "It's quite possible."
