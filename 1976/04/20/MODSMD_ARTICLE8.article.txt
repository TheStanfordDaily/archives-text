# Stanford Daily
## Opinions viewpoint Fee assessment thanks 
### 
Relief. That's what I felt Thursday night as
the ASSU election results were announced.
The Daily's fee assessment had passed over
whelmingly, and we were out of financial
quicksand.
My first wish was to thank personally each
of the 2113 persons who had voted "yes," but
realizing that was impossible during a sober
moment Thursday night, 1 settled for this
column.
1 do wish to thank everyone who voted
"yes," not only because they took the time to
go to the polls (hassling with IDs, No. 2 pen
cils, etc.), but also because they have helped
to keep the Daily alive and kicking.

Even though last week's ballot is a basic
vote of approval for our product, 1 realize that
several changes need to be made. I also
acknowledge that 579 people either dislike
the Daily or its fee assessment enough to vote
"no."
To that extent, I'd like to invite people in
the Stanford community to write me or call
me at 497-4632 this week and let me know
what they think of the Daily — what's good
and what needs improvement.
We don't just want to take your money and
run.
