# Final COP statements

Howard, et al.

It's time to clear up some mis
concept ions and misinformation
about ourselves and the other
slate.
Our opponents say they are
the only slate concerned with
graduate students. Yet we are the
only slate that addresses health
care for the spouses and children
of students, a Teaching Resource
Center for TAs, TA and RA pay,
and the Escondido Village
Center.
Our opponents are presenting
students with superficial solu
tions to serious problems. Their
"highest priority" is to work to
have a fulltime woman staff
member in the office of student
activities.
We want to deal with the
broad area of affirmative action
and get to the roots of sexism at
Stanford, rather than putting
band-aids on the problem and
hoping it will go away.

Our major concern is mobiliz
ing student interest and partici
pation in ASSU and University
operations. Rather than decrease
the amount of student input as
our opponents have proposed in
their "senate reforms," we want
to increase student involvment
both in the senate and on com
mittees.
Our proposals for Council of
Presidents (COP) committees,
the ASSU Consultant Prgram,
Senator Orientation and a SCIRE
Task Force on the committee
system will improve the effec
tiveness of student government
and encourage student partici
pation.
Another of our concerns has
been the unification of the Stan
ford community. Our opponents
stuffed the department boxes of
grad students the night before
the election with a letter imply
ing they would eliminate fee as

sessments for grad students.
Why didn't they present this
proposal to the undergraduate
population as well?
We have broad support in the
community. We have a long list
of endorsements, including the
D. Leight slate, the Chicano
community, the Daily, the Black
Student's Union and Against the
Grain.
We've got the experience;
we've got the programs; and
we've got a broad base of sup
port. We know what students are
really concerned about and will
work for and with students to get
something done.
Vote Howard-Archuleta-
Ryll-Tyndall. We need your
support.
