WHAT IS THE WOMEN'S NON-FORMAL EDUCATION NETWORK?
WNEN is a program using classes / workshops to bring together women
who have ski lis, abilities, knowledge, and experience in various areas with
women who want to learn those skills.
WHY WNEN? The Stanford Women's Center, through WNEN, believes it is
vital for women to have a supportive environment in which to learn. Too
often women have been made to feel insecure when exploring a new field,
especially in the presence of men in an educational setting. Therefore, we
want to overcome this through this program.
Workshop facilitators have a basic belief in women's capability and will
work to provide learning experiences based on the needs of the par
ticipants / students.
Finally, WNEN is committed to the belief that by challenging the limits
imposed on us as women we can gain strength from one another, and
through this strength continually work to change our world towards one
based on equality and respect for individual needs and gifts.
