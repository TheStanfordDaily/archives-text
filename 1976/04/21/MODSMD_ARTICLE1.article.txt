With a i. udience 0f441,000
according to . fmt station survey,
KDIA reaches mu > black households
in the San Francisco Hay Area than any
other radio station. Its success is due
largely to one man, ). Walter Carroll,
station manager and vice president of
KDIA radio.
Carroll, 55, is currently a candidate
for a master's degree in communica
tion here.
"You don't ever have to stop learn
ing," he says. "Besides, by enriching
your personal life you are in a position
to contribute that much more to the
community."
He noted that his wife shares his
view and is supportive of all his ac
tivities.
Boundless energy
Members of Carroll's radio staff, col
leagues and classmatesareawed by his
seemingly boundless energy and con
stant good humor.
"1 stay impressed with his fantastic
energy and desire to learn more," said
Carroll's adviser, Nathan Maccoby, di

rector of the Institute for Communica
tion Research here. "I admire a man
who doesn't rest on his laurels."
As part of his course work here, Car
roll said he is planning to conduct an
in-depth study which will better iden
tify KDIA listeners. He said he hopes
the study results will aid the station to
more efficiently meet the informa
tional needs of the black community.
Maccoby said he hoped the project
would be able to serve as a model for
future studies of this type.
Commitment
Throughout his life, Carroll has dis
played a commitment to the black
community. His life story is one of
hard work and opportunity.
Born and raised in Columbus, Ohio,
he left home in 19:36 to attend a small
college in Bluefield, W. Va., where he
majored in political science on a half
athletic, half-academic scholarship.
Upon graduating in 1940, Carroll
became vice principal of a junior high
school for children of poor farmers
from Georgia's backwoods.
"I had never been to Georgia be
fore ... It was truly an experience,"
said Carroll.
Racism and victories
Carroll encountered racism in Geor
gia, but small victories, such as build
ing a home economics cottage for the
children with the help of both black

and white townspeople, left pleasant
memories of the place as well.
After a year there, Carroll returned to
the North to work for a master's degree
in political science at Ohio State Uni
versity. Subsequently, he went to To
ledo and worked for theYMCA. There
with another young man, he de
veloped programs for elementary to
high school age youths. Clubs for pa
rents were also initiated.
At age 27, after a short break from
community-oriented programs, Car
roll quit his job as assistant industrial
relations director for the Doehler-
Jarvis Corporation.
"I was young, somewhat impatient
and did not realize the potentialities of
my future with the company," Carroll
commented.
Many jobs
He moved to Chicago, where he held
a variety of jobs from 1943-58: man
ager of Princeton Park Homes, adver
tising salesman for the Chicago De
fender, marketing salesman for the
Johnson Publishing company and vice
president for the Pittsburgh Courier.
The Courier was the largest black
weekly newspaper in the country
when Carroll was promoted to vice
president of sales and marketing.
However, a few months in highly in
dustrialized Pittsburgh encouraged
him to accept a job with radio station

KSAN, of the Golden State Broadcast
ing Company in San Francisco.
Carroll was intrigued by broadcast
ing because it offered him the oppor
tunity to work closely with people
again and because very few blacks had
entered the field.
In 1963 Carroll left KSAN to join the
classical music station KKHI. Sonderl
ing Broadcasting Company hired him
in 1965 to work for KDIA radio making
him vice president of both KDIA and
the company in 1967.
Carroll said he sees KDIA primarily
as a public service station. In addition
to the United Press International wire
service, the station's own newspeople
and the Black Audio network for black
news perspectives are used.
Discussing his responsibilities as
station manager, Carroll said, "My
staff must consist of able, competent
people who know the pleasure of what
it means to accept responsibility and
have the interest necessary to carry
through and implement" public ser
vice programs.
"If we didn't provide this kind of
service, who would the black com
munity be able to turn to for this in
formation?" asked Carroll. In the same
breath he answered, "Nobody!"
