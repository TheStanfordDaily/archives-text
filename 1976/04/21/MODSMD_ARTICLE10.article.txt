# 'Misleading' statements

Brad Krevoy

This letter is a reply to Kyra
Subbotin and Kathryn Ma's
April 16 Daily column in which
she said some rather untrue, and
if I can take the liberty of using
her own words, "misleading and
deceptive" statements.
Subbotin, at one point in her
discourse on "political miscon
duct" quoted me as saying "it
was the responsibility of each
candidate to find out for him
self" that there had been a
change in plans regarding the
slate of Stanford students who
were running as Brown dele
gates. The fact is that this quote

was taken out of context, and is
"misleading and deceptive."
At no time, in any way, shape
or form, was there a change in
plans from the original agree
ment made among members of
the slate. The agreement, as I
understood it, was that at the
caucus we were on our own to
persuade the uncommitted to
vote for us as individuals, and
that when it came time to vote,
Stanford students would vote for
each other. Those who came out
to support me abided by this ag
reement.

In fact, if anyone failed to
abide by the agreement, it was
Subbotin, who not only failed to
bring her fair share of suppor
ters, but worse yet, deserted the
other members of our slate when
she left when it came time to
vote. Her desertion becomes all
the more tragic because one
Stanford student was nine votes
shy of winning.
Evidently, Subbotin was
under the mistaken impression
that at the caucus we would
lobby collectively for each other.
If this was the agreement, then
we would have all made a joint
speech, and would have printed
up literature en grosse that advo
cated that all participants at the
caucus support the entire Stan
ford c late.
Yet in fact, all of the Stanford
candidates made individual
speeches, and five in particular
had individual handouts. The
fact that some members took the
time and initiative to design
handouts was pefectly within
the bounds of the original ag
reement.
What I said to Subbotin at the
caucus was that "it was the re
sponsibility of each candidate to
find votes for himself or herself
at the caucus." Subbotin con
strued this statement to mean
that there had been a change in
plans.
Yet the fact that six other
members of the slate were aware
of this aspect of the agreement,
leads me to believe that perhaps
she was not completely aware of
what was going on. For this I
offer no apology, since I did not
organize the slate; but rather I
offer a suggestion to Subbotin
that the next time she enters into
an agreement to check what she
is getting into. By doing this, she
won't have to cry foul from ig
norance.
