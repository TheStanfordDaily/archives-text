# Bring back death penalty
## 
### 
Marc Bush

I am disgusted with the Supreme Court
decision of June, 1972, that virtually
abolished the death penalty in our nation.
With a death penalty decision expected
from the high court before its summer re
cess, we should welcome a reversal of the
1972 decision, thus removing from death
rows present festering populations.
I also have an intense loathing for those
indignant bigots who fought for the aboli
tion of the death penalty. The thought of
these intolerable, aimless lamenters only
flushes my face with fire-red blood!
When will these bumbling fools succumb
to the impetus of modern humane ethics
and reinstitute capital punishment in every
state of this Union? 1 surely hope that
abolitionists realize that their position has
no moral, sociological or religious suste
nance.
What type of people would favor the ter
mination of the supreme punishment?
One characteristic they share is that they
are highly emotional, compassionate and
sentimental. They cannot control the power
of logic and reason.
They do not have the competency of a
balanced being. They are not affected by the
meaning of justice.
I ask you: do these pyschological misfits
merit any choice in the question of the death
penalty? We live in a democracy, but these
feckless jellyfish must be silenced and
squelched!
Accomplishments
Envision what capital punishment had
accomplished for us to the point of its aboli
tion. It had canceled the population explo
sion, because of the great number of persons
eliminated in the restful gas chamber.
Human life had become fervently
cherished, as a pillar that only God could

remove. And imagine the number of
families united in love and harmony at the
funeral services of the condemned relative.
An abolitionist cannot defend himself
against the argument taken from Christian
doctrine. It is so stated by Jesus that "an eye
shall be taken for an eye, and a tooth for a
tooth."
Almighty God has ordered man to be ven
geful and has given him the right to judge
the lives of his fellow men and the power to
punish the guilty by giving them death.
I have diverted to length on the justifica
tions for the death penalty; I will now pro
pose the central thesis.
Criminal beings do not deserve a noble
extinction. Hanging, the gas chamber, the
firing squad and the electric chair are too
virtuous for these degenerate animals.
Violent death
A violent and torturous death is the only
means by which a malefactor can receive
that which he has inflicted on other admira
ble human beings.
Let me suggest a number of processes for
extirpating a deadly animal. Moiling in oil
would be provocative. The breaking of
every bone in the human body would be a
fascinating finale.
Not only should a violent and torturous
death be advocated by all, but public execu
tions should occur to serve as a spectacle to
hinder anyone who is contemplating a
criminal act. The ripping-out of the hair and
nails and than subjecting the beast to a
burning-at-the-stake would serve as a most
influential public exposition.
Undoubtedly, my favorite mode of execu
tion is the dissection of a squirming, shriek
ing, live human body. Not only will this
serve as excellent entertaining recreation,
but it will advance medical science in exa-

mi ning the reactions of inner body organs at
the exact moment of death.
Expedite justice
I submit that the inquisitorial judicial sys
tem of trial-by-jury be done away with, and
the death penalty be expeditiously enacted
when a person is merely indicted for a seri
ous crime. In addition to having all felony
indictments punishable by death, 1 recom
mend loitering, mischievious mischief, in
citing or participating in a riot and alcoholic
or narcotic intoxication.
An animal who perpetrates one of these
misdeeds has the right to nothing better
than death. This threat of capital punish
ment will strike such terrorism and linger
such apprehension in our society that there
will never be crime again!
Of course, it could eliminate more than
half the people in our nation, but look whal'
it will have done to the population explo
sion. And justice, which is the execution of
punishment that is commensurate to the
crime, will be served.
Imagine the humanism that a man will
experience as he is returning to his home in
the evening and sights a stiff, silhouet
ted against the amber sunlight, hanging
high from the gibbet, legs and arms torn
from the socket. The incident inspires my
soul in picturing it.
The satisfaction this man will receive,
knowing his government is behind him,
standing for liberty, enacting justice and
upholding the inalienable rights of every
citizen, will always have profound effects in
maintaining the peace. The spiritualism
this man will receive in viewing another
human being hanging lifelessly from the
noose is embracing and awe-inspiring!

mi ning the reactions of inner body organs at
the exact moment of death.
Expedite justice
I submit that the inquisitorial judicial sys
tem of trial-by-jury be done away with, and
the death penalty be expeditiously enacted
when a person is merely indicted for a seri
ous crime. In addition to having all felony
indictments punishable by death, 1 recom
mend loitering, mischievious mischief, in
citing or participating in a riot and alcoholic
or narcotic intoxication.
An animal who perpetrates one of these
misdeeds has the right to nothing better
than death. This threat of capital punish
ment will strike such terrorism and linger
such apprehension in our society that there
will never be crime again!
Of course, it could eliminate more than
half the people in our nation, but look whal'
it will have done to the population explo
sion. And justice, which is the execution of
punishment that is commensurate to the
crime, will be served.
Imagine the humanism that a man will
experience as he is returning to his home in
the evening and sights a stiff, silhouet
ted against the amber sunlight, hanging
high from the gibbet, legs and arms torn
from the socket. The incident inspires my
soul in picturing it.
The satisfaction this man will receive,
knowing his government is behind him,
standing for liberty, enacting justice and
upholding the inalienable rights of every
citizen, will always have profound effects in
maintaining the peace. The spiritualism
this man will receive in viewing another
human being hanging lifelessly from the
noose is embracing and awe-inspiring!

I am disgusted with the Supreme Court
decision of June, 1972, that virtually
abolished the death penalty in our nation.
With a death penalty decision expected
from the high court before its summer re
cess, we should welcome a reversal of the
1972 decision, thus removing from death
rows present festering populations.
I also have an intense loathing for those
indignant bigots who fought for the aboli
tion of the death penalty. The thought of
these intolerable, aimless lamenters only
flushes my face with fire-red blood!
When will these bumbling fools succumb
to the impetus of modern humane ethics
and reinstitute capital punishment in every
state of this Union? 1 surely hope that
abolitionists realize that their position has
no moral, sociological or religious suste
nance.
What type of people would favor the ter
mination of the supreme punishment?
One characteristic they share is that they
are highly emotional, compassionate and
sentimental. They cannot control the power
of logic and reason.
They do not have the competency of a
balanced being. They are not affected by the
meaning of justice.
I ask you: do these pyschological misfits
merit any choice in the question of the death
penalty? We live in a democracy, but these
feckless jellyfish must be silenced and
squelched!
Accomplishments
Envision what capital punishment had
accomplished for us to the point of its aboli
tion. It had canceled the population explo
sion, because of the great number of persons
eliminated in the restful gas chamber.
Human life had become fervently
cherished, as a pillar that only God could

remove. And imagine the number of
families united in love and harmony at the
funeral services of the condemned relative.
An abolitionist cannot defend himself
against the argument taken from Christian
doctrine. It is so stated by Jesus that "an eye
shall be taken for an eye, and a tooth for a
tooth."
Almighty God has ordered man to be ven
geful and has given him the right to judge
the lives of his fellow men and the power to
punish the guilty by giving them death.
I have diverted to length on the justifica
tions for the death penalty; I will now pro
pose the central thesis.
Criminal beings do not deserve a noble
extinction. Hanging, the gas chamber, the
firing squad and the electric chair are too
virtuous for these degenerate animals.
Violent death
A violent and torturous death is the only
means by which a malefactor can receive
that which he has inflicted on other admira
ble human beings.
Let me suggest a number of processes for
extirpating a deadly animal. Moiling in oil
would be provocative. The breaking of
every bone in the human body would be a
fascinating finale.
Not only should a violent and torturous
death be advocated by all, but public execu
tions should occur to serve as a spectacle to
hinder anyone who is contemplating a
criminal act. The ripping-out of the hair and
nails and than subjecting the beast to a
burning-at-the-stake would serve as a most
influential public exposition.
Undoubtedly, my favorite mode of execu
tion is the dissection of a squirming, shriek
ing, live human body. Not only will this
serve as excellent entertaining recreation,
but it will advance medical science in exa-

mi ning the reactions of inner body organs at
the exact moment of death.

Human life had become fervently
cherished, as a pillar that only God could

remove. And imagine the number of
families united in love and harmony at the
funeral services of the condemned relative.
An abolitionist cannot defend himself
against the argument taken from Christian
doctrine. It is so stated by Jesus that "an eye
shall be taken for an eye, and a tooth for a
tooth."
Almighty God has ordered man to be ven
geful and has given him the right to judge
the lives of his fellow men and the power to
punish the guilty by giving them death.
I have diverted to length on the justifica
tions for the death penalty; I will now pro
pose the central thesis.
Criminal beings do not deserve a noble
extinction. Hanging, the gas chamber, the
firing squad and the electric chair are too
virtuous for these degenerate animals.
Violent death
A violent and torturous death is the only
means by which a malefactor can receive
that which he has inflicted on other admira
ble human beings.
Let me suggest a number of processes for
extirpating a deadly animal. Moiling in oil
would be provocative. The breaking of
every bone in the human body would be a
fascinating finale.
Not only should a violent and torturous
death be advocated by all, but public execu
tions should occur to serve as a spectacle to
hinder anyone who is contemplating a
criminal act. The ripping-out of the hair and
nails and than subjecting the beast to a
burning-at-the-stake would serve as a most
influential public exposition.
Undoubtedly, my favorite mode of execu
tion is the dissection of a squirming, shriek
ing, live human body. Not only will this
serve as excellent entertaining recreation,
but it will advance medical science in exa-

mi ning the reactions of inner body organs at
the exact moment of death.
Expedite justice
I submit that the inquisitorial judicial sys
tem of trial-by-jury be done away with, and
the death penalty be expeditiously enacted
when a person is merely indicted for a seri
ous crime. In addition to having all felony
indictments punishable by death, 1 recom
mend loitering, mischievious mischief, in
citing or participating in a riot and alcoholic
or narcotic intoxication.
An animal who perpetrates one of these
misdeeds has the right to nothing better
than death. This threat of capital punish
ment will strike such terrorism and linger
such apprehension in our society that there
will never be crime again!
Of course, it could eliminate more than
half the people in our nation, but look whal'
it will have done to the population explo
sion. And justice, which is the execution of
punishment that is commensurate to the
crime, will be served.
Imagine the humanism that a man will
experience as he is returning to his home in
the evening and sights a stiff, silhouet
ted against the amber sunlight, hanging
high from the gibbet, legs and arms torn
from the socket. The incident inspires my
soul in picturing it.
The satisfaction this man will receive,
knowing his government is behind him,
standing for liberty, enacting justice and
upholding the inalienable rights of every
citizen, will always have profound effects in
maintaining the peace. The spiritualism
this man will receive in viewing another
human being hanging lifelessly from the
noose is embracing and awe-inspiring!
