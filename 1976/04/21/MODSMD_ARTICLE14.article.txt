Ezra Pound

Since it was I who invited
Princess Mary de Rachewiltz to
Stanford, I who introduced her
on the two occasions when she
spoke on campus, and I who
asked Dana Gioia to give ad
vance notice of her appearances,
it falls to me to attempt to re
spond to Prof. Robert Cohn's ex
traordinary letter in the April 14
Daily.
Regarding Gioia's full-page
spread April 19 on Ezra Pound
and his daughter Mary de
Rachewiltz as to which Cohn
opines that it "misses the whole
tone of the Pound affair by a
wide margin," 1 can report that
Princess de Rachewiltz wholly
approved of it, with the single
exception that she objected to
the comment that her father gave
broadcasts "for Mussolini" — an
objection exactly opposite to
that raised by Gohn, so far as 1
can understand him.
For my own part, 1 found that
Gioia's articles confirmed the
opinion that I formed when I
read last quarter his review of
Tim Dekin's Occasional Uncles
— that is to say, that in Gioia the
Daily has found a reviewer more
responsible, with better taste,
and better informed, than any
who has written in the paper
since 1 came to Stanford eight
years ago.
I take note of Cohn's senti
ments as to the relative merits of
Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot, and I
give them as much weight as he
would give to mine if 1 were to
declare that, on re-reading, I
found Paul Verlaine "the
greatest poet of bis time," but Ar
thur Rimbaud "surprisingly
simplistic and jingly, almost
sophomoric!"
Finally, 1 too regard the deaths
of six million Jews in World War
II as an abomination — so abo
minable that it is obscene for

such an enormity to be used as a
pretext for two senior professors
to squabble with each other.
What is even more abominable is
for one of those senior professors
to use the Nazi holocaust of the
Jews as a pretext for putting
down a student journalist.

USE discrimination
In its March 30 issue, the Un
ited Stanford Employees (USE)
newspaper Employees Organize
saw fit to write a disgusting arti
cle about me by Don Ramsay.
His article forgot to mention that
I am a member of the union. My
dues have always been paid up
to date.
He also forgot to mention that I
gave money out of my pocket to
buy food for people who were on
strike. Also I make arrangements
for our steward to have a meeting
place each month. My family
and I also volunteered to fix all
the food for their picnic, and all
the food for their Christmas
Party and also served it. I had to
pay the pot washers at this time
to wash all the pots. When the
city workers in Palo Alto had
their strike, the USE wanted to
donate some food to them. My
wife and I stayed up all night to
prepare it in our home.
First of all I would like to ex
plain that I have been a union
cook for the last 20 years. I have
nothing against the union.
Everyone needs a good union. A
union is as good as the people
make it. The members must
stand behind theirunion.butthe
union must be for the people and
what is right with good leader
ship.
I personally believe someday
the USE will become a good un
ion, but to accomplish this it will
take time, experience, and un

derstanding about human be
ings whether be they black or
white.
I did not ask the union to give
me anything. I asked them for a
loan. It is not everyday one loses
a leg or an arm. If your union
cannot or will not help you when
you do lose a leg or arm, in my
opinion, they are not worth a
damn. For seven months I was in
a wheelchair, sometimes I wou Id
crawl, then I went to my
crutches. Now I have my leg. I'm
walking well and am standing
tall. I still say there was a pre
judice move made toward me
because I'm black.
We have organized a new
group on campus called "Save
the People." I am the chairman
and there is no money or fee in
volved. As of now we have 2300
members with hundreds more to
follow. This is not just for the
minorities but for everyone
black or white.
We are prepared to help and
defend anyone that is taken ad
vantage of. Your case will be in
vestigated to see who is right and
who is wrong. If you are right we
will stand behind you 100 per
cent and if you are wrong, you
know the results.

Beer contest
Richard Castillo and 17 other
Kappa Sigma residents are un
deniably proud that one of their
members drinks beer, one can
assume from their letter to the
Daily April 14.
But to direct such a spurious
attack on Kevin Mr.Dermott and
the judges of the Sigma Chi beer
chugging contest is a poor way
to advertise it.
Mr.Dermott on five different
occasions in the afternoon chug
ged three glasses of beer, each

time complying fully with the
rules which allow no spillage of
beer.
At no time was a complaint
filed with the judges. The time
limit on the contest was actually
extended to allow Randy Swan
son an opportunity to match
McDermott's astonishing feat of
consuming three cups of beer in
5.95 seconds. Swanson even re
fused McDermott's offer to a
"chug off" to determine the
campus chugging champion.
That they challenge McDer
mott's claim to the title because
he puked before his performance
is even more mystifying. This is
no different than the puking
caused by nervousness that
plagues any great athlete before
a record breaking attempt.
The Sigma Chis stand by their
decision. Challengers tq
McDermott can try next year to
beat his time.
Knowing both McDermott and
the Kappa Sigs, I might add a
further note. In a chugging con
test between the two, giving
McDermott 17 beers and all 17
Kappa Sigs one beer each,*
McDermott would win hands
down.
