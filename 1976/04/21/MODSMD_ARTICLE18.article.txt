# Bank to charge prompt customers
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Citibank,
the nation's second largest bank,
has announced it will charge a
50-cent monthly service fee to its
Master Charge customers who
pay their bills immediately. In
dustry spokesman said Tuesday
that the practice probably will
spread to other banks across the
country.
"It's a step in the right direc
tion" said Richard M. Rosen
berg, vice president of Wells
Fargo Bank in San Francisco. "1
think there will be a significant
number of other banks that will
follow."
Up until now, most of the mill
ions of Americans who used
bank charge cards paid no mem
bership fee. The only exceptions

were in a few areas where in
terest rates are lower than nor
mal and an annual fee is charged
to make up the difference.
Citibank is the first bank the
country to impose this kind of
charge.
Rising costs
Philip Seblavoni, product
manager for Citibank's Master
Charge, said, "The revision is
necessary to offset our rising
costs and to improve our level of
customer service. We are asking
those customers who do not pay
any finance charge to contribute
toward the cost of providing this
valuable service." It could not be
determined what it costs
Citibank to provide service to its
one million Master Charge card

holders, about one-third of
whom will be affected by the
change.
A spokesman for Interbank,
which issues Master Charge,said
the company was conducting a
survey of its member banks to
find out whether the Citibank
move was the start of a trend.
"Chances are it may spread," he
said.

A BankAmericard spokesman,
Lee Van Houten, said she did not
know whether other banks will
follow Citibank bulsaid the issue
had been under discussion in
many areas. One bank card, she
said, "may no longer be free —
just like a lot of other things in
our society."
In San Francisco, Rosenberg,
whose bank issues Master

Charge, said "1 think every bank
has considered" imposing a ser
vice fee. He said that the 25 to 33
percent of card holders who pay
their bills on time are, in effect,
"getting an interest free loan."
He said Wells Fargo makes
money on its Master Charge ac
counts, but said the margins are
"very thin," particularly be
cause of increased paper and
postage costs.
