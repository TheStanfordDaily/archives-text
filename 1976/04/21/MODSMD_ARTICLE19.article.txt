(WHEN) Workshops sponsored
by the Stanford Women's Center
will continue through April 23.
Registration forms and course
descriptions are available at the
Women's Center.
The 33 courses vary from the
practical to the esoteric and are
classified into four main areas: 1)
arts and crafts such as weaving,
2) technical skills such as bike
repair, 3) personal identity

workshops on subjects like in
tuitive and psychic awareness
and 4) women's cultural identity
classes concerned with issues
such as women and the legal sys
tem.
For the past two years the
Stanford's Women's Center has
sponsored a fair in the spring.
"This year," Women's Center
coordinator Dee Bucciarelli
said, "The Women's Center
wanted to provide a continuing
event. The workshops educate
women and last more than a few
days."
The workshops will begin on
April 26 and meet two hours a
week for the following six
weeks.
Maggie Nelson, a peer coun
selor at the Bridge, commented,
"Another feature of these work
shops is that they are using ta
lent within the Stanford com
munity rather than bringing in
outside people to speak and lead
sessions."
Nelson stressed that the work
shops are not only for Stanford
students but are open to all
women of Stanford and the out
lying communities.
