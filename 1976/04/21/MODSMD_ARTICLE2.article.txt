# Supreme Court ruling:
## Courts may require low-rents in suburbs 
### 
WASHINGTON (APj — Federal
courts can order the government to
build subsidized low-rent housing in
predominantly white suburbs,
the Supreme Court ruled yesterday.
In an 8-0 decision on a Chicago case
that lias been in the courts for 10 years,
the justices rejected government ar
guments that court orders would un
duly interfere with local authorities.
The key question in the case was
whether the court's 1974 decision that
judges may not ordinarily order bus
ing of pupils across school district
lines also applies to housing.
The court said it does not. Such a
ruling, it said, would erect "an arbit
rary and mechanical shield for those
found to have engaged in unconstitu
tional conduct."
In an opinion by Justice Potter
Stewart, the court said the basis of the
1974 decision was that innocent sub
urbs could not be required to take steps
to correct the faults of cities.
It said the housing situation was dif
ferent because the federal Department
ot I lousing (HIJD) actions had resulted
in unconstitutional segregation by
i.oncentrating public housing in black
ghettos.
The court also said the "relevant
geographic area" for correcting this
was "the Chicago housing market, not
the Chicago city limits."
The court's decision sends the case

back to a federal judge in Chicago with
instructions to consider, but not
necessarily impose, a "metropolitan
area order."
The decision touched on a current
presidential campaign issue stemming
from former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Car
ter's remark that he could "see nothing
wrong with ethnic purity being main
tained" in neighborhoods.
Carter also said he would not permit
discrimination. He later apologized for
using the words "ethnic purity."
There was no immediate reaction to
yesterday's decision from the presi
dential candidates.
In Chicago, Mayor Richard Daley
told a news conference that he agreed
