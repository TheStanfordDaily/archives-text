# Comets indicate huge planet

WASHINGTON — The orbits
of 60 comets indicate they origi
nated from the explosion of a
giant planet that once existed be
tween Mars and Jupiter, an as
tonomer says.
Dr. Thomas Van Flandern of
the U.S. Naval Observatory here
said in an interview yesterday
that computer plotting of the
comet orbits seems to confirm
that the long-theorized planet
existed up to about six million
years ago.
"At that time, the planet
exploded — accounting for
most, if not all comets, the as
teroid belt and many meteor
ites," Van Flandern said.
What could have caused such
an explosion is unknown.
The astronomer traced back
ward the orbits of 60 comets that
have been seen only once from
earth. These comets have orbits
so large that it takes millions of
years for one swing around the
sun.
"There is a tendency for these
orbits to intersect at a common
starting point in the asteroid belt
between Mars and Jupiter," Van
Flandern said. The asteroid belt
is a ring of rocky bodies orbiting
the sun.
Three quarters of the orbits in
dicate the comets originated in
that area five million to seven
million years ago in a zone about
100 million miles wide, he said.
The orbits don't intersect
exactly at one spot, he said, be
cause the comets probably were
disturbed by the gravitational in

fluanees of the galaxy and pas
sing, stars.
■ Van Flandern said his find
ings, drawn from a year of calcu
lations, are in line with a theory
proposed in 1972 by M. Over
den, an astronomer at the Uni
versity of British Columbia.
Overden calculated that a
giant planet 90 times the mass of
earth once existed where the as
teroid belt is now. Three quarters
of his planet would have been
made up of liquids and gases
surrounding a solid core.
"The asteroids may be the
brokeh-up core and the comets
may be the atmosphere or
liquid," Van Flandefn said.
The bodies in the asteroid belt

— ranging in size from the
500-mile-diameter Ceres to
thousands of smaller fragments
— contain only about one tenth
of one percent the mass of earth
For so little to remain, Van
Flandern said, the planet's exp
losion must have been so violent
as to fling much of its material
out of the solar system.
"If we broke up a large planet
today, most of its material either
would escape the solar system or
be swept up by the large outer
planets," he said.
"Overton thinks most rem
nants of the missing planet
were swept up by Jupiter and
Saturn, the biggest planets," he
added.
