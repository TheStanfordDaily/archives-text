What is salmonella poisoning?ls if true that you can contrict it from
turtle soup?-D.B.
According to the dictionary salmonella is "a genus of aerobic
bacteria . . . associated with acute inflammations in the intestines
of animals." Salmonella poisoning is why your mother would
never let you make sandwiches with mayonnaise when they
couldn't be refrigerated.lts symptoms in humans closely resemble
gastro-intestinal flu.
The little bacillus has other credits too. It can cause epidemic
meat poisoning, paratyphoid fever, parrot fever, fowl typhoid, hog
cholera and white diarrhea of poultry.
The bacillus grows well on lots of things, but apparently is
particularly common in turtle meat.

I missed your column last week. What did you do over your
vacation? -C.G.H.
For the first half, I enjoyed the delightful Phoenix weather—42
degrees in the afternoons and hailing. Concerning the second half,
see above question.

Re your column on the squash courts, (April 7) there is indeed
hut one bathroom in the deGuerre courts complex. However, il is
not labeled "Men." It is rather labeled "Men/Women." I know that
for sure because I point it out to people when it's their first time
there. It's got to be the only liberated labeled head on campus. If
your readers are interested, you might let them know that the
bathroom also contains an open dressing room for the side-by-side
shower stalls.-B.T.
Consider them so informed.
