# Dealers overcharge customers

### 
MIAMI (AF) — If you think
your new General Motors car
came equipped with an
American-built CM radio, you'd
better take a closer look. There's
a good chance you've paid top
dollar for a cheaper, foreign
made imitation.
Hundreds of GM dealers,
primarily Chevrolet outlets, are
making extra profits by instal
ling Japanese radios for new car
buyers who think they are get
ting radios made by Delco, a GM
division. The customer pays the
same retail price and apparently
gets as good a product, but the
Japanese radios cost the dealers
only half as much as Delco's.
The problem is so widespread

that Delco has placed advertise
ments in national magazines ad
vising purchasers to "Tell your
dealer 'Delco.' Don't settle for a
look-alike radio in your new CM
car."
Trademark
John Crawford, general sales
manager for Delco Electronics in
Kokomo, Ind., said the firm also
has started putting a standard
Delco-GM trademark on its
radios to help consumers iden
tify them.
"Nationwide, we are seeing an
erosion in sales," Crawford said.
Spokesmen for Ford and
Chrysler said they knew of no
such situation in their firms. A
spokesman for American Motors

said a preliminary check showed
his company "may have a few
isolated instances of this."
Investigation
An Associated Press investi
gation has revealed that the
switch works like this:
A dealer orders his cars with
out radios. The salesman asks a
prospective puchaser whether
he wants a radio in the car, and if
so, which type — AM. AM-FM,
etc.
If the customer says hi; wants a
radio, the salesman pulls out a
GM price book and quotes Ihe
price for a Delco unit. An AM
pushbutton radio for a Chevrolet
Vega retails in the book at $70
and costs the dealer $58.10.

But the radio actually instal
led is one of a number of imports
designed to match the car's in
terior.
Mike Bassan, a spokesman for
one such importer, Dyn Elec
tronic of Miami, said his firm's
imitations cost the dealer about
$30.
This extra $28 profit, multip
lied by thousands of cars, pro
vides a tidy sum for the dealers.
Bassan said his firm sells
radios to more than 300 dealers
throughout the country, mostly
GM dealers.
"They like us because of the
kind of service we provide,
one-week delivery and good
quality," Bassan said.

ments in national magazines ad
vising purchasers to "Tell your
dealer 'Delco.' Don't settle for a
look-alike radio in your new CM
car."
Trademark
John Crawford, general sales
manager for Delco Electronics in
Kokomo, Ind., said the firm also
has started putting a standard
Delco-GM trademark on its
radios to help consumers iden
tify them.
"Nationwide, we are seeing an
erosion in sales," Crawford said.
Spokesmen for Ford and
Chrysler said they knew of no
such situation in their firms. A
spokesman for American Motors

said a preliminary check showed
his company "may have a few
isolated instances of this."
Investigation
An Associated Press investi
gation has revealed that the
switch works like this:
A dealer orders his cars with
out radios. The salesman asks a
prospective puchaser whether
he wants a radio in the car, and if
so, which type — AM. AM-FM,
etc.
If the customer says hi; wants a
radio, the salesman pulls out a
GM price book and quotes Ihe
price for a Delco unit. An AM
pushbutton radio for a Chevrolet
Vega retails in the book at $70
and costs the dealer $58.10.

But the radio actually instal
led is one of a number of imports
designed to match the car's in
terior.
Mike Bassan, a spokesman for
one such importer, Dyn Elec
tronic of Miami, said his firm's
imitations cost the dealer about
$30.
This extra $28 profit, multip
lied by thousands of cars, pro
vides a tidy sum for the dealers.
Bassan said his firm sells
radios to more than 300 dealers
throughout the country, mostly
GM dealers.
"They like us because of the
kind of service we provide,
one-week delivery and good
quality," Bassan said.
MIAMI (AF) — If you think
your new General Motors car
came equipped with an
American-built CM radio, you'd
better take a closer look. There's
a good chance you've paid top
dollar for a cheaper, foreign
made imitation.
Hundreds of GM dealers,
primarily Chevrolet outlets, are
making extra profits by instal
ling Japanese radios for new car
buyers who think they are get
ting radios made by Delco, a GM
division. The customer pays the
same retail price and apparently
gets as good a product, but the
Japanese radios cost the dealers
only half as much as Delco's.
The problem is so widespread

that Delco has placed advertise
ments in national magazines ad
vising purchasers to "Tell your
dealer 'Delco.' Don't settle for a
look-alike radio in your new CM
car."
