# Pepsi still a rarity in Russia

### 
MOSCOW (AP) â€” Three years
after the Soviet Ur.ioh bought
the right to enter the Pepsi gen
eration, the American soft drink
is still a rare commodity in the
workers' state.
At least three million bottles of
Pepsi roll oft a West German
made production line at
Novorossiysk on the Black Sea
every month, and trucks loaded
with the soft drink roar regularly
around the countryside of
southern Russia.
But it's still a rare Russian
worker who can regularly knock
off a bottle of the cola drink after
a hard day fulfilling the plan.
"It's still like a souvenir drink
to us," acknowledged Vladimir
Balashov, who heads the drink
department of the Soviet Food
Ministry in Moscow. Pepsi,
priced at 41 cents a bottle,is sold
now only on the resort-studded
Black Sea coast and in limited
quantities in Moscow.
With a population of 250 mill
ion and the Novorossiysk plant
capacity at 60 million bottles a
year, production statistically
works out to one bottle for every
four people per year.
When a new plant opens be
fore the end of the year at Yev

patoriya in the Crimea, there vvili
be two bottles for every four
people per yeai
In April 1973, when Pepsico
president Donald M. Kendall
signed a 10-year contract with
the Soviets, he said he saw the
country "in the long term as one
ot the greatest volume markets
that we have."
Balashov linked Pepsi growth
in the Soviet Union to Soviet de
liveries of Russian champagne,
cognac, vodka and wine to Pep
sico for sale in the American
market.
Asked why Pepsi wasn't ex
panding more in the Soviet Un
ion, he said: "It depends on there
being a demand by Pepsico for
our production."
Balasho said the Russians will
be paying the equivalent of $2.7
million for bottling equipment
and the soft drink concentrate in
the first five years of the 10-year
contract.
If production of the American
beverage does not expand, it will
be in contrast to plans for the
Russians' own soft drinks in the
next five years.
The 1976-80 economic plan
calls for a doubling in soft drink
output, which amounted in 1975

to 700 million gallons.
Of this amount, kvnss, a popu
lar drink made front bread yeast
and sold in summer from tank
trucks on the street, accounted
for 219 million gallons. The rest
consisted of some 250 Soviet soft
drink brands, mostly sugary and
fruit-flavored.
