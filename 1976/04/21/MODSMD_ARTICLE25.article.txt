Late returns of audio-visual
equipment which in turn incon
veniences other borrowers has

projectors and other equipment.
Effective Monday, April 12,
Audio-Visual Supervisor Bill
Cleveland has been authorized
by Plant Services Department to
charge a "nominal sum" for ren
tals plus a $10 good faith de

"This deposit will be re
funded, minus the rental fee,
upon the prompt return of all
borrowed equipment," Cleve
land said.
"Late returns will cause the
deposit to be forfeited. Rental
