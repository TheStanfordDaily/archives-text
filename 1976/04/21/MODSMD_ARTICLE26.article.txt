## History exhibit a grand display 
### Angela Miller 
On entering the Stanford Gal
lery one is confronted with a
giant photo-reproduction of the
impressive triumphal arch
which once commanded the east
entrance to Stanford before its
destruction in the earthquake of
1906. The sculptural frieze
around this arch depicts the
"Progress of Civilization," a
panoramic flow of figures
among whom a dashing couple
on horseback is prominent.
The couple is Leland Stanford
and his wife Jane, surrounded by
the emblems of their cultural
mission. Their placement in the
frieze sums up the grandiose
conception behind the architec
tural design and execution of the
University.
The Founders and the Ar
chitects, the show now on
exhibit at the Stanford Gallery,
documents this conception at
the various stages through
which it passed during the first
decades of the Universiy's con
struction.
Urban
The figures around whom the
Stanford saga evolved were
among the foremost of American
urban planning and architecture
in the late 19th century. Fre
derick Law Olmsted, the father
of American landscape design,
and the man responsible for
Central, Park in New York, was
commissioned to formulate the
master plan of the University.
Shepley, Rutan. and Coolidge,
the architectural firm which car
ried on the tradition of oneof the
greatest American architects of
the period, H.H. Richardson,
was commissioned to design the
buildings of the central Quad.
Yet as the exhibition and the
book which accompanies it de
monstrate, Stanford himself was
the most forceful personality be
hind the design of the Univer
sity. The much-lauded project
was conceived as a memorial to
Stanford's only son Leland Jr.,
and dedicated to "the children of
California."
Equal in importance, how
ever, was the role of the Univer
sity as a testament to Stanford's
own position in California his
tory. With an impressive career
of railroad magnate, governor,
and U.S. senator behind him,
Stanford envisioned himself as a
great empire builder, channel
ling the forces of culture and set
ting the stage for the golden fu
ture of the young state.
Book
The show and an accompany
ing book are the culmination of
an art department seminar or
ganized by Prof. Paul
Turner in the Fall-Winter quar
ters of 1975. Focusing on the
rich and largely unpublished ar
chival material in the Stanford
museum dealing with the his
tory of the University, the semi
nar provided students a chance
to study the many facets of the

University's plan and construc
tion.
The book, covering the same
material as the show, and super
bly designed by Ann Rosener of
the art department, is an impor
tant contribution in its own
right. In examining dimensions
of the University's architectural
history hitherto untreated, it
secures the importance of the
design in the tradition of English
and American university plan
ning.
Three essays by Prof.
Turner and two members of the
seminar, Marcia Vetrocq and
Karen Weitze, explore the initial
stages of the plan, its subsequent
developments after the earth
quake, and the relationship be
tween the architecture of the
quad and the California Mission
style of the state's earlier history.
Show
The show itself traces the
progression of the plan from its
initial formulation and the lay
ing of the cornerstone in May
1887. Photographs document
each stage along the way,
chronicling in particular the ex
tensive damage caused by the
earthquake. Among the irre
trievable losses to the University
were an impressive library and
gymnasium, both exhibiting
glass and steel constructed
domes.
The show also documents the
particular contribution of Jane
Stanford to the building of the
University following the death
of her husband in 1891.
Of particular interest to the
Stanford community are the
thorough provisions which the
original architects and planners
of Stanford established for the
future extension of the Univer
sity.
Growth
Such projected growth was to
have followed the quadrangular
arrangement of the original plan,
linking new buildings within a
continuous system of arcades.
As Professor Turner notes in the
catalogue, the arcades are a sig
nificant and unifying feature of
Stanford architecture sadly neg
lected by the University's plan
ners.
A research into Stanford's past
provides a perspective by which
these planners would benefit.
Stanford's architectural heritage
has been too long overlooked in
the hasty accommodation of the
University's growing needs.
Catalogues may be purchased
at the Art Gallery Bookshop and
the Stanford Bookstore for $4.80.
The show will be on through
May 9.

glass and steel constructed
domes.
The show also documents the
particular contribution of Jane
Stanford to the building of the
University following the death
of her husband in 1891.
Of particular interest to the
Stanford community are the
thorough provisions which the
original architects and planners
of Stanford established for the
future extension of the Univer
sity.
Growth
Such projected growth was to
have followed the quadrangular
arrangement of the original plan,
linking new buildings within a
continuous system of arcades.
As Professor Turner notes in the
catalogue, the arcades are a sig
nificant and unifying feature of
Stanford architecture sadly neg
lected by the University's plan
ners.
A research into Stanford's past
provides a perspective by which
these planners would benefit.
Stanford's architectural heritage
has been too long overlooked in
the hasty accommodation of the
University's growing needs.
Catalogues may be purchased
at the Art Gallery Bookshop and
the Stanford Bookstore for $4.80.
The show will be on through
May 9.
On entering the Stanford Gal
lery one is confronted with a
giant photo-reproduction of the
impressive triumphal arch
which once commanded the east
entrance to Stanford before its
destruction in the earthquake of
1906. The sculptural frieze
around this arch depicts the
"Progress of Civilization," a
panoramic flow of figures
among whom a dashing couple
on horseback is prominent.
The couple is Leland Stanford
and his wife Jane, surrounded by
the emblems of their cultural
mission. Their placement in the
frieze sums up the grandiose
conception behind the architec
tural design and execution of the
University.
The Founders and the Ar
chitects, the show now on
exhibit at the Stanford Gallery,
documents this conception at
the various stages through
which it passed during the first
decades of the Universiy's con
struction.
Urban
The figures around whom the
Stanford saga evolved were
among the foremost of American
urban planning and architecture
in the late 19th century. Fre
derick Law Olmsted, the father
of American landscape design,
and the man responsible for
Central, Park in New York, was
commissioned to formulate the
master plan of the University.
Shepley, Rutan. and Coolidge,
the architectural firm which car
ried on the tradition of oneof the
greatest American architects of
the period, H.H. Richardson,
was commissioned to design the
buildings of the central Quad.
Yet as the exhibition and the
book which accompanies it de
monstrate, Stanford himself was
the most forceful personality be
hind the design of the Univer
sity. The much-lauded project
was conceived as a memorial to
Stanford's only son Leland Jr.,
and dedicated to "the children of
California."
Equal in importance, how
ever, was the role of the Univer
sity as a testament to Stanford's
own position in California his
tory. With an impressive career
of railroad magnate, governor,
and U.S. senator behind him,
Stanford envisioned himself as a
great empire builder, channel
ling the forces of culture and set
ting the stage for the golden fu
ture of the young state.
Book
The show and an accompany
ing book are the culmination of
an art department seminar or
ganized by Prof. Paul
Turner in the Fall-Winter quar
ters of 1975. Focusing on the
rich and largely unpublished ar
chival material in the Stanford
museum dealing with the his
tory of the University, the semi
nar provided students a chance
to study the many facets of the

University's plan and construc
tion.
The book, covering the same
material as the show, and super
bly designed by Ann Rosener of
the art department, is an impor
tant contribution in its own
right. In examining dimensions
of the University's architectural
history hitherto untreated, it
secures the importance of the
design in the tradition of English
and American university plan
ning.
Three essays by Prof.
Turner and two members of the
seminar, Marcia Vetrocq and
Karen Weitze, explore the initial
stages of the plan, its subsequent
developments after the earth
quake, and the relationship be
tween the architecture of the
quad and the California Mission
style of the state's earlier history.
Show
The show itself traces the
progression of the plan from its
initial formulation and the lay
ing of the cornerstone in May
1887. Photographs document
each stage along the way,
chronicling in particular the ex
tensive damage caused by the
earthquake. Among the irre
trievable losses to the University
were an impressive library and
gymnasium, both exhibiting
glass and steel constructed
domes.

The book, covering the same
material as the show, and super
bly designed by Ann Rosener of
the art department, is an impor
tant contribution in its own
right. In examining dimensions
of the University's architectural
history hitherto untreated, it
secures the importance of the
design in the tradition of English
and American university plan
ning.
Three essays by Prof.
Turner and two members of the
seminar, Marcia Vetrocq and
Karen Weitze, explore the initial
stages of the plan, its subsequent
developments after the earth
quake, and the relationship be
tween the architecture of the
quad and the California Mission
style of the state's earlier history.
Show
The show itself traces the
progression of the plan from its
initial formulation and the lay
ing of the cornerstone in May
1887. Photographs document
each stage along the way,
chronicling in particular the ex
tensive damage caused by the
earthquake. Among the irre
trievable losses to the University
were an impressive library and
gymnasium, both exhibiting
glass and steel constructed
domes.
The show also documents the
particular contribution of Jane
Stanford to the building of the
University following the death
of her husband in 1891.
Of particular interest to the
Stanford community are the
thorough provisions which the
original architects and planners
of Stanford established for the
future extension of the Univer
sity.
Growth
Such projected growth was to
have followed the quadrangular
arrangement of the original plan,
linking new buildings within a
continuous system of arcades.
As Professor Turner notes in the
catalogue, the arcades are a sig
nificant and unifying feature of
Stanford architecture sadly neg
lected by the University's plan
ners.
A research into Stanford's past
provides a perspective by which
these planners would benefit.
Stanford's architectural heritage
has been too long overlooked in
the hasty accommodation of the
University's growing needs.
Catalogues may be purchased
at the Art Gallery Bookshop and
the Stanford Bookstore for $4.80.
The show will be on through
May 9.
