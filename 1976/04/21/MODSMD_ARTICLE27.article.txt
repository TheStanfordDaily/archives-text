# 'President's Men'
## Political classic on film 
### Howard Baldwin 
The screen is white. Suddenly
a loud bang, like a gun. A capital
"J" appears. Typewriter keys
shoot out "June 1, 1972" with an
exaggerated, war-like volume,
comparing the writer's instru
ment with the hunter's and em
phasizing its violent power and
capacity for change.
All the President's Men has
begun. In a world of common
ideas given a slight twist and
being promoted as new, All The
President's Men is a towering
loner among movies, just as its
characters are loners in the field
of journalism. The film is a pow
erful, unique, uncommon com
bination of biography and his
tory, destined for the status of
classic in the annals of film his
tory, made all the more awesome
by the proximity of time of the
events chronicled.
All The President's Men is ex
pected to be the Jaws of 1976. It is
almost as scary. Two
Washington Post reporters, Bob
Woodward (Robert Redford) and
Carl Bernstein (Dustin
Hoffman), stumble onto a trail of
corruption and stupidity too
ridiculous to be believed and too
serious to ignore.
Sad
The sad thing about Watergate
was that all the lies and mistakes
were there for the team of
Woodstein to find, almost as if
the CREEP had been digging its
own grave, unconsciously wait
ing for someone to push them
into it.
Told entirely from the repor
ters' point of view, complete

with doubts and spoonerisms
and the shock of finding that
John Mitchell answers his own
telephone, it is a detective story
that would be unbelievable as
fiction. Two reporters on the
Post for less than a year, destroy
ing the Administration and
political career of a man who'd
been in office for almost a quar
ter century? Preposterous!
But it's true. Devastating. A
story of determination. A story of
suspense. Informers. Loyalty.
Lies. Sexual politics. Defeat.
And success.
All The President's Men
snowballs on the viewer, slowly
and carefully building toward
the climax of the teletype
machine mechanically pro
nouncing the sentences and res
ignations of all the President's
men. The film has a stunning
kind of power, bringing on a
simultaneous sense of fear and
relief — fear that it could have
happened and relief that it was
stopped.
Subtle
So well constructed is the film
that it manages to be stunning as
history as well as fascinating as
biography. The first scenes of
Woodward's subtle questioning
of the Watergate burglars'
lawyer, always beginning with.
"I'm Bob Woodward, from the
Washington Post," show a
super-cool, talented, persistent

reporter. Robert Redford slips
into this mold so snugly that it's
hard to tell that's he's acting.
Dustin I ioffman as Carl Berns
tein is the more effervescent of
the two, walking with obvious
excitement and running if
necessary. His front bicycle
wheel leans against his desk as a
silent representation of his
energy. An amazing contrast to
Woodward, he would be lost
without his matchbooks or nap
kins to make notes upon.
Deep throat
Along with the other actors —
Jason Robards as Ben Bradlee,
Jack Warden as 1 larry Rosenfeld,
Martin Balsam as Howard Si
mons and Hal Holbrook as Deep
Throat, Woodward's informer —
the roles are so perfectly played
that it doesn't even seem like a
movie. It is almost like watching
living history.
Today Woodward and Berns
tein are millionaires — and are
still on the staff of the Post. But
more than that, they are poten
tial candidates for folk heroes,
for having the fortitude to chal
lenge the highest office in the
land at a time when it was the
most popular. "As you know the
freedom of the press, the First
Amendment and maybe the fu
ture of the country is riding on
Ibis. Not that that matters, but if
you fuck up again, I'm going to
get mad."

NO MORE—This grand arch was destroyed in the 1906 earthquake — some say quite deserved:
Obviously, Leland Stanford sought to make a strong statement with this monument. The urrh

MELLOW—Kenny Rankin, an enjoyable and angel-voiced singer
and composer, plays The Brewery in San Jose 011 Wednesday,
April 21 and Thursday, April 22. The intimate atmosphere of The
Brewery promises to be a fine setting for Rankin's talent. The
popular nightclub is only a short drive from the Stanford campus.
