# Winter Consort to play campus
## 
### 
The Paul Winter Consort
will give a single perfor
mance at 8 p.m. Friday, April
23, in Stanford's Memorial
Auditorium.
The Consort received glow
ing reviews on its most recent
May Area tour. John Wasser
man commented, "It was a
magic night. Winter's con
cepts, arrangements, in
strumentation, and perfor
mance are uniquely exciting
in the world of popular
music. The Winter Consort is,
in a word, electrifying."
This will be the Consort's
only Hay Area appearance.
Winter plays alto and sop
rano saxophones, David Darl
ing electrified cello, and
Robert Chappell multiple
keyboards. Percussionists are
Tigger Benford and Ben Car
riel.
The latter two play an as
tonishing number of instru
ments, including marimba
and African log xylophone,
chromatically tuned tabla,
tympani, bells, gongs, con
gas, bongos, cuicci, jazz

drums, cymbals, shakers, and
Brazilian surrin drums.
Tuned tom-toms, hanging
from a pole, are played with
extraordinary effect by Car
riel.
The Consort carries 6000
pounds of instruments and
electronics, including a full
mixing board and sound au
gmentation. They draw
music from sources ranging
from classical to Cregorian
chants, Brazilian folk, Eastern
meditative, and popular jazz.
The Consort plays together
and sometimes in sub
consorts, dividing into solos,
duets, and trios.
Winter formed his first
band as a student at North
western, winning the 196 1 In
tercollegiate Jazz Festival in
Washi ngton.
Tickets are $6, $5, and $4;
students with proper iden
tification, $3. Tickets can be
purchased at Tresidder ticket
office, all Macy's, and major

"must-see" event and prom
ises to be a dynamite show.
