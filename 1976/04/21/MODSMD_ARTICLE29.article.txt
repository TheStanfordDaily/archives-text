Quake may hit within a year
LOS ANGELES — A major quake in the Los
Angeles area could occur within a year, a California
Institute of Technology scientist said yesterday.
He emphasized the prediction was made by ex
perimental methods and could be a false alarm.
The epicenter of the forecast temblor, estimated
•it 5.5 to 6.5 on theßichter Scale, lies near theorigin
nl the 1971 San Fernando Valley quake that killed
04 persons, according to Dr. James Whitcomb.
11 California's evaluation council were to decide
there is serious concern about a quake within the
next year, some preparations could be made, said
Charles Manfred, director of the State Office of
Emergency Services.
Manfred said there was no immediate cause tor
alarm. He said the prediction by Whit
comb will be evaluated within two weeks by a
panel of nine seismologists, and a report will be
made to the governor.
Whitcomb surrounded his statement with cau
tion.
"The uncertainty of the magnitude, location and
time preclude the test from being of great use to the
public," he said.
The forecast came after a slowdown of seismic
waves — vibrations from small quakes or blasting
was observed over a wide area north of Los
Angeles. Such changes in the velocity of seismic
waves have been known to precede quakes — al
though sometimes they have not been followed by
earthquakes. The waves usually return to normal
velocity just before the quake.
S.F. strikers block buses
SAN FRANCISCO — Milling pickets hurled cries
of "scab" at City Hall workers and briefly blocked
suburban buses yesterday in an effort to breathe
new life into the flagging three-week-old munici
pal strike.
liut both sides in the strike appeared ready to
cling adamantly to their positions — labor demand
ing mediated talks with no preconditions, the city
insisting that strikers return to work before talks
resume.
"They haven't been able to persuade us peace
fully so they have shifted to force," said Hoard of
Supervisors president Quentin Kopp before a noon
caucus. "If they agree to return to work, 1 think
there would be a reasonable chance to resume
mediation."
"We tried de-escalating and got insulted for it, so
we figured maybe escalation would bring them to
the bargaining table," said Stan Smith, head of the
striking Building and Trades Union.
About 100 pickets circled peacefully in front of
City Hall to greet city workers. Earlier, twice that
number blocked entrance lanes to the AC Transit
terminal where buses bring about 20,000 commut
ers from Oakland, Berkeley and other East Bay
cities.
State police scuffled briefly with pickets at the
bus terminal and mace was reportedly used on at
least one rowdy striker, but there were no arrests.
There were no problemsatCity Hall where violence
last Wednesday saw a judge pushed to the ground
and other workbound employes jostled.
Several pickets estimated they had lost up to

$1000 in wages, whileofficials say the city is saving
about $300,000 a day by not paying the strikers.
Arabs riot over occupation
JERUSALEM — Arab riots erupted again yester
day against the Israeli occupation of west Jordan.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin reaffirmed Israel was
still prepared to give up part of the territory in any
eventual peace negotiations with Jordan's King
Hussein.
The military command said the riots were minor
and no injuries were reported. But Israeli troops
clamped a curfew on the town of Tulkarm where
Arab students built roadblocks on the main street
and clashed with security forces.
Troops and police also broke up stone-throwing
demonstrations in east Jerusalem, Jenin and Nab
lus, where one Arab rioter was killed by army gun
fire Monday and three were wounded.
In a newspaper interview yesterday, Rabin said
his government was "maintaining freedom of ac
tion to negotiate with Jordan, including territorial
compromise."
But no such negotiations are in sight and Rabin
told the daily Al Hamishmar that he would hold
elections before agreeing to return any west bank
land.
Communist attacks expected
KUALA LAMPUR,Malaysia — Increased attacks
by Communist guerrillas trying to topple the pro-
Western government in Malaysia are expected fol
lowing Communist admissions of a split within
the movement and fighting for control of territory.
Each faction will want to show that it is more
revolutionary than the other to attract recruits, offi
cials and diplomats said.
They did not consider the fighting at this time a
major threat. But the government is sufficiently
concerned about the Communists to have launched
a grass-roots campaign called "rukun tetangga" —
Malay for community self-reliance — to fight sub
version by monitoring every dwelling in this coun
try of 12 million persons.
An estimated 3000 guerrillas of the banned
Malayan Communist party (MCP) operate in the
country along with the splinter faction believed to
beabout 600-strong. Most of them operate along the
Thai-Malaysia jungle border.
The government previously reported the divi
sion among the Communists but it was not acknow
ledged until the past two weeks when the clandes
tine "Voice of the Malayan Revolution Radio,"
which speaks for the Communist party, reported
the fighting.
The radio broadcasts came from Yunnan in
southern China, which has given moral support to
the Malaysian Communists but has not supplied
them with arms.
Hearst's story ruled out
SACRAMENTO — A federal judge refused Tues
day to allow Patricia Hearst's secret conversations
with authorities to influence the bank robbery trial
of her former lover, Steven Soliah.
The decision by U.S. District Court Judge Philip
Wilkins cleared the way for final defense testimony

to proceed — perhaps with the defendant telling
his own story from the witness stand.
Wilkins, refusing to order federal officials to re
veal what Miss Hearst told them about an April
1975 bank robbery, said her statements in other
jurisdictions would have no binding effect on the
U.S. attorney here.
The judge said he narrowed the issue down to a
question of whether the actions of the U.S. attorney
for the Northern District of California, James
Browning Jr., can be binding on the U.S. attorney
for the Eastern District of California, Dwayne
Keyes. He decided they cannot.
Thus, Wilkins said, even if Browning has taken
statements from Miss Hearst which he believes and
which contradict evidence presented in Soliah's
trial, it is not necessary for Keyes to be affected.
"Mr. Keyes is legally able to present his theory of
his case as he sees it, and is not bound to believe
anything said by Miss Hearst," the judge said.
Press protests subpoena
SAN DIEGO — The California Press Photo
graphers Association protested yesterday a judge's
action in subpoenaing more than 400 unpublished
negatives of the Sacramento Bee.
The photographs were taken by Leo Neibaur and
Erhart Kruse, staff photographers of the newspaper,
of a confrontation involving sheriff's deputies and
members of the "posse Comitatus" who tried to
stop union organizers from entering a tomato field.
Superior Court Judge William Biddick of San
Joaquin County subpoenaed the negatives and the
newspaper complied. A spokesman for the state
photographers' group objected to both.
"News photographers and the news media must
remain neutral in such cases regardless of the wants
of the parties involved," said Rick McCarthy, as
sociation president.
Under Section 1070 of the California Evidence
Code, "newspersons cannot be held in contempt for
refusing to disclose unpublished information"
McCarthy said.
The same is true, he said, for photographers'
negatives as it is for reporters' notes or tapes.
