### Mark Shibuya 
Thirty speakers in one body kept
1300 persons laughing in Memorial
Auditorium last night in an ASSU
Speakers Bureau-sponsored speech by
comedian-impersonator David Frye.
Frye, who flew up from Los Angeles
for the event, expressed pleasure in
speaking before a college audience.
"It's nice to get away from televi
sion." he said. "American advertisers

would have us spray every part of our
body," he explained, leading into a
portrayal of a television physician
named "Nine Out of Ten Doctors" who
warned against "embarassing ear
odor."
Switching to an impersonation of
former President Richard Nixon. Frye
muttered, "I knew nothing about any
thing; I know nothing about anything;
I know a little about something, but
you'll never find out."
Frye then impersonated movie ac
tors and television personalities.
'Not easy'
"It's not easy for a Jewish boy to look
like Jimmy Cagney," said a cock
strutting Frye. At one point Frye's
characterization of sports commen
tator Howard Cosell said "Bobby
Riggs, you were humiliated by Billie
Jean King. What do you have to say
about your pitiful, miserable perfor
mance?"

Halfway through his presentation,
Frye took a three-minute break during
which a film soundtracked with Frye's
characterization of Nixon singing "I
Did It My Way" depicted highlights of
the former President's life.
The rest of the program consisted of
Frye's impersonations of presidential
candidates.
"I'm really the Man from Glad." said
Frye's Jimmy Carter. "My program is
to be glad and to go around with a
shit-eating grin on my face."
"I hope to beat Gerald Ford in Texas.
If I do, I'm right in there," said Frye's
characterization of Ronald Reagan.
Goose-stepping adviser
Frye's version of Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger goose-stepped to the
podium to introduce himself as "ad
viser to the President and ambassador
to the entire world.
"I realize because of my religion I
will never become president, but no

one will ever stop Henry Kissinger
from taking my rightful place as
Fuhrer."
Frye's characterization of Hubert
Humphrey dismissed Edmund Muskie
as "too ugly to be President."
"I have delegates and I will continue
to be a pain in the ass," said Frye's
George Wallace, who then revealed
that "Scoop Jackson is a black man."
"Regarding the economy," said
Frye, as Gerald Ford, "There will be a
150 percent surcharge and deportation
of the unemployed."
Serious tribute
Frye finished with a serious tribute
to Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther
King.
In a Daily interview later. Frye said
he usually doesn't present the tribute
in front of a large audience, but did so
this time because the audience was "so
good."

for the event, expressed pleasure in
speaking before a college audience.
"It's nice to get away from televi
sion." he said. "American advertisers

would have us spray every part of our
body," he explained, leading into a
portrayal of a television physician
named "Nine Out of Ten Doctors" who
warned against "embarassing ear
odor."
Switching to an impersonation of
former President Richard Nixon. Frye
muttered, "I knew nothing about any
thing; I know nothing about anything;
I know a little about something, but
you'll never find out."
Frye then impersonated movie ac
tors and television personalities.
'Not easy'
"It's not easy for a Jewish boy to look
like Jimmy Cagney," said a cock
strutting Frye. At one point Frye's
characterization of sports commen
tator Howard Cosell said "Bobby
Riggs, you were humiliated by Billie
Jean King. What do you have to say
about your pitiful, miserable perfor
mance?"

Halfway through his presentation,
Frye took a three-minute break during
which a film soundtracked with Frye's
characterization of Nixon singing "I
Did It My Way" depicted highlights of
the former President's life.
The rest of the program consisted of
Frye's impersonations of presidential
candidates.
"I'm really the Man from Glad." said
Frye's Jimmy Carter. "My program is
to be glad and to go around with a
shit-eating grin on my face."
"I hope to beat Gerald Ford in Texas.
If I do, I'm right in there," said Frye's
characterization of Ronald Reagan.
Goose-stepping adviser
Frye's version of Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger goose-stepped to the
podium to introduce himself as "ad
viser to the President and ambassador
to the entire world.
"I realize because of my religion I
will never become president, but no

one will ever stop Henry Kissinger
from taking my rightful place as
Fuhrer."
Frye's characterization of Hubert
Humphrey dismissed Edmund Muskie
as "too ugly to be President."
"I have delegates and I will continue
to be a pain in the ass," said Frye's
George Wallace, who then revealed
that "Scoop Jackson is a black man."
"Regarding the economy," said
Frye, as Gerald Ford, "There will be a
150 percent surcharge and deportation
of the unemployed."
Serious tribute
Frye finished with a serious tribute
to Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther
King.
In a Daily interview later. Frye said
he usually doesn't present the tribute
in front of a large audience, but did so
this time because the audience was "so
good."
Thirty speakers in one body kept
1300 persons laughing in Memorial
Auditorium last night in an ASSU
Speakers Bureau-sponsored speech by
comedian-impersonator David Frye.
