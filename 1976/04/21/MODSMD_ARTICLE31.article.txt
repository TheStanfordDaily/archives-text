# Attention Seniors
## 
### 
Seniors may vote today and to
morrow for their choices on class
day speakers and the class gift. Ac
cording to Senior Class President
"Weird Walt" Spevak, a separate
table from the ASSIJ election table
will be set up at the post office both
days from 10 a.m. â€” 4 p.m.
In addition, seniors will be asked
to make suggestions for spring
quarter activities and commence
ment related events.
Class day is traditionally a lunc
heon held the day before com
mencement for graduating seniors
and their parents. Last year's speak
ers were Law Prof. John Kaplan,
Economics Prof. John Curley and
then-Asst. Religious Studies Prof.
Jerry Irish.
Senior class officers say they
hope to lure one additional speaker
to this year's luncheon. "We're still
trying to convince Woody Allen to
come," says Spevak.
