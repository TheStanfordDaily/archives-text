## 
### Arlene Warmack 
The Gay People's Union (CPU) has
proposed that the University adopt a
"Human Rights Policy" of non
discrimination on the basis of sexual
or affectional preference for students,
faculty and staff.
I lie proposal, submitted to Acting
Provost William Massy on Monday.
\v<is in response to recommendations
from Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons that prospective employers
using the Career Planning and Place
ment Center (CPPC) be asked to volun
tarily supply information on what per
sonal characteristics they consider to
be job-related.
Richard Thomas, community rela
tions coordinator for the GPU expres
sed disappointment over the llniversi
t\ s acceptance of Lyons' recommen
dation, saying such information
should be required of employers using
the CPPC and other University
fai ilities.
Existing University policies allow
employers to discriminate against stu
lents "on a basis that can be clearly
shown .is not job-related." Thomas
said.
W ill try again
He indicated that the GPU will seek
re< msideration of the CPPC next fall
on grounds that other universities
have adopted similar statements
.ig'tinst discrimination based on sex

ual orientation.
Under the "Human Rights Policy"
proposed by the GPU. the University
would require "that all personnel ac
tions such as compensation, benefits,
transfers, layoffs. . . . educa
tion, . . . and that all student recruiting
and admissions, student services
(such as financial aid. placement,
counseling, housing, student ac
tivities, physical recreation), and
facilities usage, be administered with
out discrimination based on race, sex,
sexual orientation, age, religion, na
tional origin, or physical disability."
Commenting on the proposal. Lyons
said, "We have not discriminated in
job-related matters or areas that are not
job-related." He called the proposal a
"laundry list" and said developing
such a list on the basis of such a broad
range of areas "is a patently absurd
idea."
David kallick, assistant dean for
student affairs at the University of
Southern California Law School, said
the school last month added "sexual
orientation" to the terms included in
its anti-discrimination policies.
San Diego State University officials
also reported that the student council
there had adopted a similar policy.
"Ironically, both of these actions are
a result of our own initial efforts at
Stanford." Thomas said.
