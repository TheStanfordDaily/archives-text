# Rubber strike begins as contract talks fail
## 
### 
CLEVELAND (AF) â€” United Rubber
Workers (URW) struck the rubber in
dustry's Big Four companies
(Coodyear, B.F. Goodrich, General
Tire and Firestone) early today after
failing to reach agreement on a con
tract before contracts expired at 12:01
a.m. EST.
URW President Feter Bommarito
said negotiations continued after the
deadline following a last-minute offer
by the Firestone Tire and Rubber Co.
But Bommarito said he held little hope
for agreement.
The main stumbling block was re
vealed by economic issues that in
cluded a demand for an unlimited
cost-of-living adjustment clause.
URW officials said 47 plants involv
ing 60,000 URW members were or
dered to shut down nationwide.
The Big Four's last known offer

proposed $1.05 in hourly wage in
creases for tire workers over the life of
the.contract, 50 cents of it in the first
year; 85 cents for nontire workers over
three years; and a cost-of-living ad
justment ranging from five to 10 cents
an hour per year.
IJRW sources said the dollar value of
the total package couldn't be estimated
because of such variables as insurance
rate increases.
The URW went into the talks de
manding an unlimited cost-of-living
adjustment provision and an increase
in hourly wages sufficient to bring the
$5.50 URW hourly average into line
with United Auto Workers pay and to
keep it there. The amount needed was
estimated at $1.65 in the first year and
$2 or more over life of the contract.
Company concern centered on
separating tire and nontire worker
pay scales, a step the URW insisted it
wouldn't accept, and on work rule and
other operational and pay changes
aimed at making nontire operations
more competitive with those in smal
ler, nonunion companies.
Bommarito said that shutting down
all the Big Four would cut off 88 per
cent of the nation's tire production.
The diversity in the rubber and plas
tics field, with about 1500 companies
making a total of about 32,000 pro
ducts, was expected to offset im
mediate effects outside the Big Four.
Bommarito also made public a letter
from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-
Mass.) to the Justice Department's an
titrust division chief, Thomas Kauper,
asking about possible antitrust viola
tions or investigations relative to a
mutual aid agreement among the
companies.
Company spokesmen acknow
ledged that such agreements have
existed since 1907, indicating the ag-
reements were revised to fit the ci*
cumstances of the negotiations eac
three years but refusing to give detai
of past or current pacts.
A lustice Department spokesman i
Washington, Mark Sheehan, sal
the letter was received yesterday "an
we will, of course, look into the sitiu
tion as we would in response to an
request.
"That doesn't mean there's going t
bean antitrust investigation,"Sheehai
added.
