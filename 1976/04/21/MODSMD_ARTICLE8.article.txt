# Condescending reference
## 
### 
Rafferty, et al. ||

On behalf of the more than 2000 secretaries and
office assistants here whose principal task often
seems to be dispensing good-natured aid and ad
vice to students, professors and administrators,
we resent the condescending reference that was
made to their collective work role in the Daily's
April 16 article on careerism.
Although it is likely that the remarks of the
student who "felt pressured to become something
more than a secretary," and did not want to "end
up where her mother was (a secretary)" arose
more from sympathy than from animosity, she
obviously hasn't been without her book bag and
meal card long enough to discover the true di
mensions of today's job market.
There are now more people in the American
labor force with at least two years of college than
there are upper level occupations to absorb them.
The myth that education is a sure route to in
creased social status and higher income has been
dispelled, and it's inevitable that many future
graduates will "end up" doing work inherently
less satisfying than that toward which they had
aspired while in school.
But to paraphrase Mark Twain, a job is, after all,

only "what a body is obliged to do" in order to pay
the bills. Whilesome might lend themselves more
than others to the "self-actualization" process
mentioned in thearticle, they are still just jobs and
only one part of a person's overall being.
Many University secretaries undoubtedly feel
they are working at less than their full potential,
and many students here undoubtedly experience
anxiety over the prospect of eventually being un
deremployed as well. We are in close, impartial
contact with both groups and it is our opinion that
if being self-actualized has anything to do with
effectively coping with the problem in question,
the degree of self-actualization is far greater
among secretaries than it is among students.
Undergraduates could probably gain some of
the most valuable knowledge of their four-year
visit by asking a secretary what it takes to remain
smiling after eight hours behind a desk each day.
They might be asking similar questions of them
selves not long after the ink on their diplomas has
dried.
