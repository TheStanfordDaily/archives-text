# Hughes, Mao compared

Marc Strassman

Howard Hughes, who recently
died, and Mao Tse-tung, who
may die soon, have much in
common.
Moth were old, sick men, liv
ing lives of phenomenal isola
tion. their deaths frequently ru
mored, their presence reluc
tantly shared with a select few,
the meetings a tremendous rarity
and honor.
Both achieved their near
mythic status by identifying and
devising solutions for the central
problems of their respective
societies as China and America
evolved through the major part
of the 20th Century.
Hughes, whose initial fortune
of half a million dollars came
from his father's historically
significant invention of an oil
drilling bit that could cut
through rock (making the for
tune of J. Paul Getty, the only
American richer than Hughes,
possible), took the money and
with his inventive mind made
movies, designed airplanes and
set speed records (including one
in 1938 for global circumnaviga
tion).
Hughes also founded a com
pany (Hughes Aircraft Com
pany) which developed sophis
ticated electronic weaponry for
the; Cold War and Vietnam and
he established a unique Sunbelt
empire that included gambling
casinos, hotels, airlines, mining
operations, an aerospace firm,
medical research institute and
vast tracts of land.
Representative sample
Movies, airplanes, gambling,
and weapons are as representa

tive a sample of what American
life in the 20th Century has been
about as anything, and Hughes
was importantly involved in the
development and profits of them
all.
Mao Tse-tung, poet,
philosopher, soldier, and politi
cal leader, the Creat Helmsman
of the Chinese people, repre
sents in a different way the same
incarnation of his people's aspi
rations and major historical pro
jects.
He developed from Marx's
writings the identification and
creation of solutions for central
problems facing the Chinese
people, such as the need to
eliminate feudalism, oppose the
Japanese invasion, to drive
out the Nationalists and to de
velop an indigenous form of
modernity that will be. whatever
the result of the current struggle
between moderates and radicals,
the starting point for, and a sig
nificant influence on, China's fu
ture.
Power and progress
Both these men achieved great
power (through money in one
case and through ideology and
force of arms in the other) be
cause they were men of excep
tional talent who saw clearly
what was happening in their
societies. They were also capa
ble of clearly seeing future pros
pects, and had the ability to
mobilize the ideas, people and
materials necessary to do the
work of transformation required
by their peoples, lands and
times.

Fidel Castro, though not yet in
the same class of World Histori
cal Individual — Hegel's phrase
— with these two men, may be
come one if he survives and con
tinues to grow in experience and
stature during the next 25 to 30
years.
There has always been debate
among those who hold that his
tory is made by the masses or by
impersonal, abstract forces, or by
great leaders, by blind fate or by
conscious choice and action.
The examples of Howard
Hughes and Mao Tse-tung sup
port the argument that it is the
extraordinary person, along with
powerful ideas (and a fertile
ground and climate for his per
sonality and ideas) that has the
most influence in making and
shaping history.
Each of these men represents,
in ways indigenous and approp
riate to their Eastern and West
ern cultures, the epitome and
culmination of their civiliza
tions during a particular histori
cal period.
They were born near the be
ginning of the century. As the
century moves towards its end
ing, the historical situation,
created partiallyby their actions,
is substantially different from
what it was then; but it likewise
will create and be influenced by
other persons, who will, like
Pilot Hughes and Helmsman
Mao, be able to identify and pro
vide workable solutions to the
major problems of their time.
