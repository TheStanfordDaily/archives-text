## Why more theme houses? 
### Mark Albertson 
n the cover of the draw booklet, they appear as
Robert S. Moore Houses. North and South. But if
present plans are borne out, they will soon be
come the newest additions to theme house popu
lation here.
The appearance of two new theme houses, at a time
when general housing is in such great demand, has
raised a number of questions about the necessity of
having two more theme houses.
"Diversity is important," says Paul Sobotka, chairman
of the Subcommittee on Residences of the Committee on
Services to Students. "We didn't feel that we were limiting
the scope or attractiveness of the residential system by
adding a new theme house," he adds.-
Associate Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton points
out that waiting iists and draw popularity for existing
theme houses show that there is still a great deal of
demand among students for theme residences, particu
larly academic ones.
Although Horton feels that the prospects for theme
houses "look very good," he adds that "we would not
hesitate to pull the rug if a house did not show well in the
draw."
Horton says that there is more demand for academic
residences than ethnic ones. According to Horton, this is
because of the "uneasiness people feel toward ethnic
houses."
However Chris Sherry, who is a house associate at
Grove House, feels "somewhat concerned" that the two
theme houses were placed in new residences. "I think it's
unfortunate that minority groups such as Asian Ameri
cans and chicanos are in dorm situations." says Sherry,
and she feels that while Casa Italiana should have its own
house, American studies should be incorporated in a
dorm.
Asst. English Prof. Arnold Rampersad, resident faculty
adviser for the American studies house,says he feels that
an American studies house will be a valuable addition to
the housing system, and the house is strongly supported
by students of the American studies interdepartmental
program. He is quick to add that "We did not press for one
of the new houses," and he states flatly that is "has no
doubt the house could be somewhere else."

Aiphonse Juilland, chairman of
the French and Italian Depart
ment, says that he was "pleased

feels that the new theme houses
will be good additions to the hous
ing system and points to the
great first choice ratio of the
French house as an example.
The French Department was
looking for ways to improve the
teaching of French," says Robin

Robinson responds to argu
ments that the placement of two
theme houses limits space to stu
dents by noting that the programs
are broad and have no pre
requisites. Says Robinson,
What we want to avoid is getting
narrow houses.

However, students at the
French house say they feel that it
would benefit even more from a
system that would allow them to
be more selective in choosing
house members from interested
students.
They wanted a system similar to
Columbae s in which students at
tend a series of house meetings
and express interest in the house
before the draw This would cut
down on the number of students
drawing into the house who have
never taken a language.
The housing office has not been
too eager to change the draw
sysem for the French house, and
Juilland regrets it. We don't want
to create hostility," he says, but
adds,"if it could be more selective,
it would be a better program.
The decision to place the theme
programs in the new Row houses
stems from a variety of physical
factors. Horton reasons that the
new houses were built with the
flexibility of having theme houses
within them," and he emphasizes
that the houses were not con

structed specifically with themes
in mind.
Need small houses
Horton also recalls that most of
the faculty members who sup
ported the new theme houses
didn t think the programs would be
successful unless they were in
small group houses.
Robinson emphasizes that the
desires of those in the American
studies program not to allow
freshmen in the house eliminated
the posibility of a dorm situation.
We wanted to preserve the
uniqueness that each house has,"
says Robinson, and he cites the
successful French house as proof
that smallness makes houses
good, cohesive units."
Sobotka says that once his
subcommittee had decided on the
two theme houses, they started
looking around for a place to put
them. Because the new Moore
houses were small and had space
for a live-in faculty member,
Sobotka's subcommittee unani
mously agreed to put them in the

new houses. It was coincidental
that we had new facilities.'
More than hotel'
"We want a residence to offer
something more than a hotel,"
says Assistant to the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Karen Murray. Murray
points out that the structure of the
new houses offers needed small
ness and the "intimate relation
ship with a faculty member," qual
ities which she feels are important

to the success of a theme house.
She also points out that the
moving or elimination of another
house on theßow never came into
consideration. Last year, the fail
ing Guthrie House was picked as
the site of the French house, but
Murray feels that this year, "there
really wasn't a house that needed
to be revived."

ALMOST READY—One of the new Robert S. Moore houses awaits
its new occupants. Although the houses will be ready in the fall, this
week's draw will probably decide whether the new residence will
become one of the new theme houses or remain a simple row
house.
n the cover of the draw booklet, they appear as
Robert S. Moore Houses. North and South. But if
present plans are borne out, they will soon be
come the newest additions to theme house popu
lation here.
The appearance of two new theme houses, at a time
when general housing is in such great demand, has
raised a number of questions about the necessity of
having two more theme houses.
"Diversity is important," says Paul Sobotka, chairman
of the Subcommittee on Residences of the Committee on
Services to Students. "We didn't feel that we were limiting
the scope or attractiveness of the residential system by
adding a new theme house," he adds.-
Associate Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton points
out that waiting iists and draw popularity for existing
theme houses show that there is still a great deal of
demand among students for theme residences, particu
larly academic ones.
Although Horton feels that the prospects for theme
houses "look very good," he adds that "we would not
hesitate to pull the rug if a house did not show well in the
draw."
Horton says that there is more demand for academic
residences than ethnic ones. According to Horton, this is
because of the "uneasiness people feel toward ethnic
houses."
However Chris Sherry, who is a house associate at
Grove House, feels "somewhat concerned" that the two
theme houses were placed in new residences. "I think it's
unfortunate that minority groups such as Asian Ameri
cans and chicanos are in dorm situations." says Sherry,
and she feels that while Casa Italiana should have its own
house, American studies should be incorporated in a
dorm.
Asst. English Prof. Arnold Rampersad, resident faculty
adviser for the American studies house,says he feels that
an American studies house will be a valuable addition to
the housing system, and the house is strongly supported
by students of the American studies interdepartmental
program. He is quick to add that "We did not press for one
of the new houses," and he states flatly that is "has no
doubt the house could be somewhere else."

ALMOST READY—One of the new Robert S. Moore houses awaits
its new occupants. Although the houses will be ready in the fall, this
week's draw will probably decide whether the new residence will
become one of the new theme houses or remain a simple row
house.
n the cover of the draw booklet, they appear as
Robert S. Moore Houses. North and South. But if
present plans are borne out, they will soon be
come the newest additions to theme house popu
lation here.
The appearance of two new theme houses, at a time
when general housing is in such great demand, has
raised a number of questions about the necessity of
having two more theme houses.
"Diversity is important," says Paul Sobotka, chairman
of the Subcommittee on Residences of the Committee on
Services to Students. "We didn't feel that we were limiting
the scope or attractiveness of the residential system by
adding a new theme house," he adds.-
Associate Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton points
out that waiting iists and draw popularity for existing
theme houses show that there is still a great deal of
demand among students for theme residences, particu
larly academic ones.
Although Horton feels that the prospects for theme
houses "look very good," he adds that "we would not
hesitate to pull the rug if a house did not show well in the
draw."
Horton says that there is more demand for academic
residences than ethnic ones. According to Horton, this is
because of the "uneasiness people feel toward ethnic
houses."
However Chris Sherry, who is a house associate at
Grove House, feels "somewhat concerned" that the two
theme houses were placed in new residences. "I think it's
unfortunate that minority groups such as Asian Ameri
cans and chicanos are in dorm situations." says Sherry,
and she feels that while Casa Italiana should have its own
house, American studies should be incorporated in a
dorm.
Asst. English Prof. Arnold Rampersad, resident faculty
adviser for the American studies house,says he feels that
an American studies house will be a valuable addition to
the housing system, and the house is strongly supported
by students of the American studies interdepartmental
program. He is quick to add that "We did not press for one
of the new houses," and he states flatly that is "has no
doubt the house could be somewhere else."

Robinson responds to argu
ments that the placement of two
theme houses limits space to stu
dents by noting that the programs
are broad and have no pre
requisites. Says Robinson,
What we want to avoid is getting
narrow houses.

However, students at the
French house say they feel that it
would benefit even more from a
system that would allow them to
be more selective in choosing
house members from interested
students.
They wanted a system similar to
Columbae s in which students at
tend a series of house meetings
and express interest in the house
before the draw This would cut
down on the number of students
drawing into the house who have
never taken a language.
The housing office has not been
too eager to change the draw
sysem for the French house, and
Juilland regrets it. We don't want
to create hostility," he says, but
adds,"if it could be more selective,
it would be a better program.
The decision to place the theme
programs in the new Row houses
stems from a variety of physical
factors. Horton reasons that the
new houses were built with the
flexibility of having theme houses
within them," and he emphasizes
that the houses were not con

structed specifically with themes

Horton also recalls that most of
the faculty members who sup
ported the new theme houses
didn t think the programs would be
successful unless they were in
small group houses.
Robinson emphasizes that the
desires of those in the American
studies program not to allow
freshmen in the house eliminated
the posibility of a dorm situation.

says Robinson, and he cites the
successful French house as proof
that smallness makes houses

Sobotka says that once his
subcommittee had decided on the
two theme houses, they started
looking around for a place to put

houses were small and had space
for a live-in faculty member,
