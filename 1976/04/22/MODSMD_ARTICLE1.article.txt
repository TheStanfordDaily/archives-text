## Why more theme houses? 
### Mark Albertson 
n the cover of the draw booklet, they appear as
Robert S. Moore Houses. North and South. But if
present plans are borne out, they will soon be
come the newest additions to theme house popu
lation here.
The appearance of two new theme houses, at a time
when general housing is in such great demand, has
raised a number of questions about the necessity of
having two more theme houses.
"Diversity is important," says Paul Sobotka, chairman
of the Subcommittee on Residences of the Committee on
Services to Students. "We didn't feel that we were limiting
the scope or attractiveness of the residential system by
adding a new theme house," he adds.-
Associate Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton points
out that waiting iists and draw popularity for existing
theme houses show that there is still a great deal of
demand among students for theme residences, particu
larly academic ones.
Although Horton feels that the prospects for theme
houses "look very good," he adds that "we would not
hesitate to pull the rug if a house did not show well in the
draw."
Horton says that there is more demand for academic
residences than ethnic ones. According to Horton, this is
because of the "uneasiness people feel toward ethnic
houses."
However Chris Sherry, who is a house associate at
Grove House, feels "somewhat concerned" that the two
theme houses were placed in new residences. "I think it's
unfortunate that minority groups such as Asian Ameri
cans and chicanos are in dorm situations." says Sherry,
and she feels that while Casa Italiana should have its own
house, American studies should be incorporated in a
dorm.
Asst. English Prof. Arnold Rampersad, resident faculty
adviser for the American studies house,says he feels that
an American studies house will be a valuable addition to
the housing system, and the house is strongly supported
by students of the American studies interdepartmental
program. He is quick to add that "We did not press for one
of the new houses," and he states flatly that is "has no
doubt the house could be somewhere else."
