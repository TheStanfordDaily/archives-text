# Price increases held to .2 percent in March

WASHINGTON (AP) — Falling
prices at the gasoline pump and
the third big monthly drop in groc
ery costs held the rise in con
sumer prices to two-tenths of a
percent in March, the government
said yesterday.
The March increase compared
with February s consumer price
rise of one-tenth of a percent and
an increase of four-tenths of a
percent in January.
The January-to-March figures
left consumers with the lowest
three-month inflation rate in al
most four years.
The Labor Department said the
increase for the three months end
ing in March — a seasonally ad
justed annual rate of 2.9 percent
— was the smallest three-month
increase since June 1972. It com
pared with an average increase of
about 7 percent for each calendar
quarter in 1975.
Social security increases
Announcement of the first
quarter consumer price figure
triggers a 6.4 percent cost-of
living benefit increase for 36.3 mill
ion persons under the Social Sec
unty and Supplemental Security
Income programs.
The increase is automatic,
based on a comparison of the av
erage monthly Consumer Price
Index in the first quarter of 1976.
At the White House. Press Sec
retary Ron Nessen said President
Ford views the relatively small in
crease in consumer prices as ex
cellent news" and "further evi
dence that the administration s
economic policies are working.
Nessen said Ford expects the
inflation rate to remain at a "rela
tively low level" throughout 1976,
but added that it would be un
realistic to expect the small in
creases of the past three months
to continue throughout the year.
Despite the slowing of inflation

the purchasing power of the
average worker's paycheck feli
seven-tenths of a percent last
month because weekly earnings
were held down by a reduction in
working hours.
However, purchasing power —
that is, take-home pay adjusted
for inflation and taxes — was up
4.3 percent over the year.
Grocery prices tumbled for the
third straight month, falling 1.2
percent in March after declines of
1.5 percent in February and four
tenths of one percent in January.
The cost of services continued
to be the fastest rising component
of the consumer price index,
climbing seven-tenths of a per
cent in March, the same rate as in

February.
Transportation services rose
1.3 percent, reflecting further in
creases in auto insurance rates.
Utility increases
Medical care services, includ
ing physicians fees and hospital
charges, rose one percent.
Household services also in
creased. largely due to increases
for natural gas and electricity, the
government said.
The Ford administration has
forecast an inflation rate of 5.9
percent this year, but officials
have suggested that there is a
good chance the increase will be
5.5 percent or less. Prices rose
seven percent last year and 12.2
percent in 1974.
