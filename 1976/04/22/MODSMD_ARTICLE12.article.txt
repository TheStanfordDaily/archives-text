# Dollar woes keep pub staggering

Uncertainty as to whether the
proposed Tresidder Union pub will
be economically feasible will
delay the opening of the pub for
some time," according to Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Dan Wil
liams.
It is hoped the pub will be open
fall quarter. Bob Caselli, food ser
vices director for TDS, Inc., said
yesterday. TDS is the food service
contractor for Tresidder Union.
"It's not clear that the pub at this
time is a financially viable ser
vice." Williams said yesterday.
' We may need to redesign and
modify some of our present ser
vices."
Williams' office is studying the
problem in an attempt to find ways
to insure the financial stability of
the operation. Williams cited the
"major capital investment" re
quired for construction of the facil
ity as the principal reason for the
study.
The feasibility study was de
layed because TDS was not sure
that the state Alcoholic Beverage
Commission (ABC) would grant a
liquor license.
Biggest obstacle
"The biggest obstacle was get
ting the license," Caselli said. 'We
didn't spend a lot of time or effort
before we got the license."
In February the ABC granted a
conditional license to TDS for the
sale of beer."The license will be
issued as soon as the facility is
ready," said Caselli. "I would hope
that the pub will open in fall quar
ter."
TDS initially applied for a
license last July, and had specu
lated that the tavern might open in
January. However, a protest filed
by a student which was sub
sequently withdrawn and there

tusal of the ABC to permit the sale
of wine added to the amount of
time required to sanction the per
mit.
No one under 21
One of the conditions of the
permit is that "no one under the
age of 21 is allowed in the pub/'
Caselli stated, adding that "we are
required to have a person at the
door to check IDs.''
Sixty percent of all students
here are of legal age to be admit
ted to bars, according to Caselli.
"The big question is how well
received the pub is going to be,"
Caselli said.
He said that he "would welcome
input'' from the community in
planning the establishment.
The pub will tentatively be lo
cated in what is now the billiards
room in Tresidder. "All of our
planning is based on that as our
choice," Caselli remarked.
The pub intends to serve about
a "half-dozen brands of beers to
start, and then we'll take it from
there," Caselli said.
84-inch TV
For entertainment, he added,
"we're contemplating light folk
acoustical entertainment. We like
the idea of a dart alley along with
personalized darts. We have also
seriously thought of a seven-foot
TV screen."
The pub will serve snack and
"munchie" type foods. Pizza and
hamburgers from the Transition
will also be offered.
The pub, which Caselli hopes
will operate from 11 a.m. to mid
night, should have a minimal ad
verse effect on the Coffee House
business.
"The Coffee House is a good
idea and popular," said Caselli.
"We re going to try to create as
little impact as possible on it."
