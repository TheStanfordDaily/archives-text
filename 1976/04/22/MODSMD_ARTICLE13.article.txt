# Coed nude area sign is a hoax
## 
### 
If you came to Stanford be
cause of the photos that
Playboy magazine ran of
coed nude sunbathing on the
Farm a few years back, you
may be in luck.
Signs proclaiming that the
old Encina Pool area is now
available for coed nude sunba
thing went up in three stratetic
locations around Encina Gym
yesterday.
But it's just a hoax.
An enclosed court area of
the gym, which was used for
nude sunbathing by men, was
closed off when women re
ceived locker space in the
complex earlier this month.
The Athletic Department put
up signs saying, "Coed Area,
No Nude Sunbathing,'' related

Assoc. Education Prof. Wess 8
Ruff. "Someone must have o
changed the signs," he added, fi
The Encina Pool was closed X
when the deGuerre Pools 0
opened in 1974. The depart- n
ment has no plans to turn the V
abandoned Encina Pools into a o
nude sunbathing area. X
Athletic Department officials A
speculated that the Xeroxed S
signs were probably the work a
of irate sunbathers who were X
displaced by the closure of the O
court area which was formerly X
used for sunbathing. 0
People wishing to get that N
"all-over tan" can attempt to 8
find an isolated area in the o
foothills or a nice rooftop. But X
not Encina Pool. 0
