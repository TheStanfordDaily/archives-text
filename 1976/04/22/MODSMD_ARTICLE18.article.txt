# Polished professionalism
## 'Guys & Dolls': a student triumph THEATER 
### Kathy Ross 
The newly resurrected student
drama group Rams Head pre
sented a fine, professional
looking version of Damon Run
yon's Guys and Dolls to four
warmly receptive audiences in
Mem Aud last Thursday through
Saturday nights.
The familiar plot — a light
hearted, affectionate look at the
underside of New York in the '50s
— centers arond a lovable group
of gamblers, a dance hall girl
(Adelaide) who has been en
gaged to one of the gamblers
(Nathan) for 14 years, and a naive
young missionary (Sarah) from
the Save-a-Soul Mission who tries
to convert them all and ends up
falling in love with the smoothest
operator in town (Sky Masterson).
The play calls for well-rounded
actors who can sing, dance, de
liver one-line jokes and maintain
a lively pace for over three hours

with only a short break between
acts. Especially sparkling in all re
spects, with an outstanding audi
ence rapport and the sulkiest,
funniest New York accent you
ever heard, was Dotty Kemper as
the frustrated Miss Adelaid.
Kemper's hilarious solo
number, "Miss Adelaide's La
ment," quickly established her
popularity with the audience,
which she retained throughout the
play. Her bouncy, pouty portrayal
of Adelaide highlighted the show,
and proved her talent as a great
comedienne.
Flawless
Another flawless performance
was offered by Marty Markowitz
as Nathan Detroit. His duet with
Adelaide, "Sue Me," was a high
point in the show, and his charac
terization of the irresponsible,
crapshooting entrepreneur was
consistently good: neither under

nor over-acted.
Paul Edwards and Barbara
Hoey as the straighter leading
couple (Sky and Sarah) made the
best of the slower paced material
they had to work with. Hoey's
clear singing voice needed no
thing more than a little more confi
dence behind it. Edwards' voice
and projecting were stupendous,
and he carried off the part of the
high-class gambler with self
assured savoir-faire.
Both characters warmed up
considerably between the rather
stiff "I'll Know." toward the be
ginning and the beautiful duet
"I've Never Been In Love Before,
at the end of the first act.
John Stadelman, a refreshingly
good actor, breathed life into the
sweet Nicely-Nicely Johnson
("How ya doin ?" Nicely, nicely,
thank you"). He sang particularly
well in two demanding songs.

'Guys and Dolls" and Sit Down
You're Rocking the Boat."
Tough
The street-wise gamblers, led
by Perry Simon and Kevin
Cavanaugh as ingratiating toughs
(Harry the Horse and Big Jule).
kept the show's pace alive and
humorous. Splendid character
portrayals were also turned in by
Al Melinkoff as the ever-wary Lt
Brannigan and Robert Hyman as
the mellifluous Arvide Abernathy.
Sarah's father. The Hot Box girls,
a group of luscious lovelies, kept
at least half the audience's eyes
aglow.
In the end, his performance of
Guys and Dolls can be considered
a victory for the entire cast, since
its success can be attributed to a
collective, well-balanced effort
The unity of the cast was a par
ticular tribute to the efforts of the
shows directors. Susie Malouf
and Rob Christopher. The spirit of
the cast, as well as its technical
proficiency, were the obvious re
sults of skilled and sensitive stage
direction.
Professionalism
Highly polished costumes
(headed by Martha Hardwick) and
light designs (Steven Austin)

added to the professionalism of
the production.
The sets, although they contri
buted substantially to the produc
tion as a whole, presented a minor
problem in that the scene changes
slowed down the pace of the play
Unfortunately there s no way to
make 16 set changes go
smoothly unless they are re
hearsed with the rest of the show
dozens of times, or they are
simplified considerably
An outstanding musical script
by Frank Loesser was done jus
tice by Anthony McDonald s mus
ical direction and a spirited,
though inconsistent, orchestra.
The chorus numbers were lively
and remarkably precise
Worthy of congratulation,
praise and gratitude for produc
ing a show of such caliber is
George McMillan whose dedica
tion has been evident throughout
the complications Rams Head has
had in dealing with the University
as well as outside groups.
The show was an amazing feat
of diplomacy, cooperation and
hard work: a shining success for
the first of what I hope will be many
Rams Head productions.
