# Pretty face, messy kiss
## 'Lipstick' a crude endeavor 
### Howard Baldwin 
Lipstick might very well have
been conceived by the very same
people who sit around their bed
rooms composing letters for
Penthouse magazine's Forum. It
is the kind of dreadful movie that
gives a bad name to anything on
celluloid. It is one of the most
sickening of a disgusting cinema
tic species — the high-class
exploitation film.
This particular species gathers
together highly paid and prestigi
ous names and lowers them to the
depths of sadistic depravity in a
film more likely to be found on a
scratchy print on a drive-in movies
screen in the backwoods of Ken
tucky.
Despite its gloss, it has no more

quality than a piece of gore dished
out by American International Pic
tures along the lines of Killer
Force and Race With The Devil.
At best, Lipstick can be de
scribed as stupid, ugly and repul
sive. Its characters are plastic
stereotypes who prance across
the screen with no more emotion
than the robot on Lost In Space
had. What's even worse is that it
tries to be a first-class movie.
Its snobbish pretentiousness in
giving us Margaux Hemingway.
Anne Bancroft and ex-promising
actor Chris Sarandon (Al Pacino s
transsexual wife in Dog Day Af
ternoon, who has now wisely
sworn off portrayals of sexual ab
errants) makes it all that much

more disgusting.
There are few things less
ridiculous than Volkswagens driv
ing around with Rolls-Royce gril
les. Lipstick is a scooter attempt
ing to be a Cadillac.
Hemingway plays Chris
McCormick, a highly paid model
who is attacked by her little sister's
music teacher Gordon Stuart
(Sarandon) and sodomized in one
of the most unnecessary and
brutally overdone scenes in re
cent American cinema.
It is pathetically stupid because
one has received no indication of
either Stuart's sexual perversions
or Chris' stature as a model. We
all know what's going to happen
because we've read plot sum
maries, but seeing the movie it is
impossible to find any motivation
or obsession on Stuart's part.
The fact that after he is acquit
ted in court he goes on to commit
the same hideous act to Chris'
14-year-old sister only proves him
to be a psychotic moron. It is only
an excuse for director Lamont
Johnson to put a rifle in Chris'
hands and, like her legendary
grandfather might have, blast the
balls (literally) off the rapist.
Lipstick tries to make some
points about the treatment of
women who've been raped, to the
point of employing experts on the
subject as technical advisers. It
also touches upon the world's
contempt for beautiful models
who in effect sell their bodies in a
look-but-don't-touch world of ad
vertising. But ultimately Lipstick is
overwhelmed by its own exploita
tive stupidity.
Thinking back on the film and
reading what I have just written, I
realize the inaccuracy of this re
view. I have been far too kind.
