Proposition 15
It is interesting to read people s
opinions of nuclear energy in rela
tion to the problem of worldwide
poverty. It is also interesting to
read the views of mechanical en
gineers toward environmental ef
fects, economics and social con
science.
As interesting as these discus
sions are. though, they fail to ad
dress the real issues of Prop 15,
the Nuclear Safeguards Initiative.
Prop 15 will not ban nuclear
energy even in California, let
alone the United States or the
world, provided some elementary
requirements are met. What it will
required is safe disposal of
radioactive wastes and testing of
reactor safety systems within five
years; also it wili require full insur
ance accountability by the utilities
and publication of information on
what to do in case of a nuclear
accident.
How this can be considered a
ban by the nuclear industry and its
supporters is interesting to say the
least. I would think that passage of
Prop. 15 would be viewed by the
nuclear industry as a golden op
portunity to once and for all quiet
the nuclear safety critics.
The provisions, after all, seem
to be in everyone's best interests.
If the requirements can't be met,
the law will affect only the reactors
in California, not the rest of the
world.
Even at that, the present nuc-

Lear reactors in California are a
tiny fraction of the state's energy
sources.

Training politics
It's nice that this fine University
is providing career training for a
group of people who badly need
the practice. Any future politicians
who desire to overcome their
post-Watergate morality and be
come true politicos should just be
ASSU Senators.
In less than a year, a majority of
the senate has developed the fol
lowing skills:
—Ignoring its own constitution
and re-interpreting it to support its
own interests.
—Forging ahead with major
changes in the constitution with
out any demonstration of suffi
cient student support.
—Finally, attacking the press by
calling it "opportunistic" and "ir
responsible'' when the govern
ment's mistakes are pointed out.
All of these are actions which
we deplore in our national gov
ernment. Why should we allow
them here?
The most positive action the
ASSU Senate could take would be
to vote to buy themselves tickets
to see All the President's Men.
