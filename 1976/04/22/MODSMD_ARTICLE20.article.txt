# questions on placement of new theme houses

are being approved without a full
or adequate demonstration of
student demand. No large scale
survey of the student population
was ever taken for either Casa
Italiana or American studies. As
Dan Brenner, house associate at
Zeta Alpha Phi house points out,
'The key to these programs must
be sufficient student interest."
No polls
Rampersad admits that he
never polled classes, but he did
discuss the program with the
American Studies Student As
sociation and a number of Ameri
can studies majors.
Annamaria Napolitano, resi
dent fellow for Casa Italiana, says
that she polled two first year, first
quarter Italian classes of 23 and
20 students each. In addition, she
talked with returning students
from the department's overseas
campus in Florence. She found
that 30 percent to 70 percent of
the groups she talked to expres
sed interest in having an Italian
theme house, so she went ahead
with the program.
"We've found that surveys have
been unreliable," says Sobotka.
He felt satified that the presence
of a strongly backed student
group with a "large number" of in
terested students showed his
subcommittee that the interest
was there. "I have no doubt,''
claims Sobotka, "that the Italian
house will be as popular as other
theme houses."
If either Casa Italiana or Ameri
can studies fails, it will not be the
first time that an academic theme
house has bitten the dust. Last
year, Stanford-ln-Stanford, a
house built around a theme of in
ternational relations, was cancel
ed after a poor showing in the first
round.
'Too specific'
"It was just too specific," says
Robinson, and he points to the

"rigorous" academic require
ments as a major reason for the
program's failure. One of the
coordinators, Mike Herman, sees
the fact that it "did not attract
enough women" as another
reason for the house's demise.
Although interest for Stanford-
In-Stanford was predicted from a
survey of two political science
classes, in which 150 sudents ex
pressed interest, Herman does
not feel that a larger survey would
have made a difference.
The active interest of the
French and Italian Department in
theme houses has led to some
muttering among students and fa
culty alike about declining enroll
ments and diminishing interest in
French/Italian. Although enroll
ment figures for the last three
years shows that enrollment has
risen to 1841 in French and 764 in
Italian, the 34 majors in both de
partments still makes the depart
ment one of the smallest on cam
pus.
Enrollment steady
"The facts are just not there,"
says Juilland in response to
suggestions that his department
may be trying to revive sagging
interest. As evidence of this, he
points to figures which show that
Italian enrollment is up 20 percent
since last spring. The French en
rollment has never shown a de
cline of more than five percent du r
ing one quarter.
However, the department does
not take an active interest in the
theme house, and the support is
financial as well as academic. The
French Department recently
purchased a French video

tape series from money which
was lent to them by the housing
office.
In addition, Juilland is trying to
get $1000 for each house for more
TV tapes and even hopes to
have 24-hour radio broadcasts
from overseas. He plans to obtain

the money from the department's
gift resources and from a fund
raising drive that he is mounting.
The memory of the failure of
Stanford-ln-Stanford still lingers.
If the bottom falls out on either
Casa Italiana or the American
studies program after the first

round, the University and faculty
will have to face some serious
questions about the future of
academic theme houses at Stan
ford.
If, however, interest in such
theme houses continues to rise,
many more may soon appear on
campus.


—Daily phofo by Glenn Hudson
CASA ITALIANA?—Larry Horton, Norm Robinson and other housing officials discuss the prospects
for the two new theme programs outside one of the still-empty Moore houses. The housing office, the
French and Italian Department and the American studies program are hoping that there will be
enough interest to fill the houses in the fall and make the programs successful. As one official put rt. If
they don't make it by the first round, they are out by the second."
