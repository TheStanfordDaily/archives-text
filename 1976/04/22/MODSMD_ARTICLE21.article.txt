Social security to rise
WASHINGTON — Thirty-seven million
persons on Social Security and Supple
mental Security Income will receive a 6.4
percent cost-of-living increase beginning
with their July checks, the government said
yesterday
The benefit increases will cost about $6.6
billion between July 1, 1976 and Oct. 1,
1977, sources said That includes higher
payments during the transitional quarter
from July 1 to Oct. 1 when the federal gov
ernment switches to a new fiscal account
ing period.
The Social Security hikes will come out of
Social Security trust funds which are ex
pected to experience a deficit for the sec
ond straight year. The Supplemental Sec
urity Income increases will be paid out of
general funds in the treasury.
Maximum federal payments under Sup
plemental Security Income will go up
$10 10 a month for individuals, to a new
total of $167 80, and up $15.20 a month for
couples to $251 80.
By July, there will be an estimated 4.4
million Americans receiving Supplemental
Secunfy Income.
Africans await Kissinger
NAIROBI, Kenya — Criticism of Henry
Kissinger and American policy in Africa is
Duilding up among black African militants in
advance of the secretary of state s first visit
south of the Sahara.
But some moderate African leaders see
the April 24-May 6 tour as their best chance
so far to swing the United States solidly in

support of black nationalists in southern Af
rica.
The racial struggle against ruling white
minorities in Rhodesia and South Africa,
along with economic issues between the
world's rich and poor nations, will dominate
Kissinger's discussions with presidents in
seven nations, and with delegates at the
United Nations conference on trade and
development in Nairobi.
Requests for more U.S. economic and
military aid will also be reviewed in most of
the scheduled countries — Kenya, Tan
zania, Zambia, Zaire, Ghana, Liberia and
Senegal.
Rubber strike continues
CLEVELAND — International president
of the United Rubber Workers union (URW)
Peter Bommarito said yesterday there was
little hope for an immediate settlement as
negotiations resumed with Firestone Tire
and Rubber Co. in the first day of a strike
against the industry's big four companies.
Bommarito said the negotiators were far
apart on many issues when bargaining re
cessed earlier in the day. He said he ex
pected iast evening's sessions to produce
little progress.
Firestone offered hourly pay raises total
ing 51.55 over three years. 60 cents in the
first year, and what it termed an uncapped

cost-of-living adjustment plus pension,
health and other fringe benefit boosts.
Bommarito disputed the description of
the cost-of-living factor as unlimited, saying
it wouldn't provide any money until April
1978 and was restricted by the terms on
which it would be triggered.
And he called the general wage increase
"short on what we need for a cost-of-living
catch-up for 1976 alone."
He said earlier that the URW's total
economic demands would raise the current
average total package of 59.05 an hour by
42 percent. Current average hourly pay
was $5.50, the URW said.
Ford confronts charges
WASHINGTON — President Gerald
Ford called for a little straight talk" in the
election debate and branded campaign
charges of U.S. military inferiority "com
plete and utter nonsense yesterday.
Without mentioning his chief critic on de
fense posture. Ronald Reagan, Ford told a
meeting of the Daughters of the American
Revolution, "The American people have
had enough distorted allegations that we
have become a second-rate nation."
Reagan has said the Soviets have
achieved dangerous military supremacy.
Pointing out that he has asked Congress

for the two biggest defense budgets in the
nation's history, Ford pledged that as long
as he is president, "the United States will
never become second to anybody."
Hearst in Soliah trial?
SACRAMENTO — Steven Soliah's at
torneys told his judge yesterday they may
ask to subpoena Patricia Hearst as a de
fense witness.

fore that they might summon the convict/

judge could go to the hospital, if necessary,
and take a deposition from Hearst

Hearst.

terday afternoon, including an employe of
the Carmichael bank Soliah is accused of
robbing.
Today's weather

Africans await Kissinger
NAIROBI, Kenya — Criticism of Henry
Kissinger and American policy in Africa is
Duilding up among black African militants in
advance of the secretary of state s first visit
south of the Sahara.
But some moderate African leaders see
the April 24-May 6 tour as their best chance
so far to swing the United States solidly in

support of black nationalists in southern Af
rica.
The racial struggle against ruling white
minorities in Rhodesia and South Africa,
along with economic issues between the
world's rich and poor nations, will dominate
Kissinger's discussions with presidents in
seven nations, and with delegates at the
United Nations conference on trade and
development in Nairobi.
Requests for more U.S. economic and
military aid will also be reviewed in most of
the scheduled countries — Kenya, Tan
zania, Zambia, Zaire, Ghana, Liberia and
Senegal.
Rubber strike continues
CLEVELAND — International president
of the United Rubber Workers union (URW)
Peter Bommarito said yesterday there was
little hope for an immediate settlement as
negotiations resumed with Firestone Tire
and Rubber Co. in the first day of a strike
against the industry's big four companies.
Bommarito said the negotiators were far
apart on many issues when bargaining re
cessed earlier in the day. He said he ex
pected iast evening's sessions to produce
little progress.
Firestone offered hourly pay raises total
ing 51.55 over three years. 60 cents in the
first year, and what it termed an uncapped

cost-of-living adjustment plus pension,
health and other fringe benefit boosts.
Bommarito disputed the description of
the cost-of-living factor as unlimited, saying
it wouldn't provide any money until April
1978 and was restricted by the terms on
which it would be triggered.
And he called the general wage increase
"short on what we need for a cost-of-living
catch-up for 1976 alone."
He said earlier that the URW's total
economic demands would raise the current
average total package of 59.05 an hour by
42 percent. Current average hourly pay
was $5.50, the URW said.

Rubber strike continues
CLEVELAND — International president
of the United Rubber Workers union (URW)
Peter Bommarito said yesterday there was
little hope for an immediate settlement as
negotiations resumed with Firestone Tire
and Rubber Co. in the first day of a strike
against the industry's big four companies.
Bommarito said the negotiators were far
apart on many issues when bargaining re
cessed earlier in the day. He said he ex
pected iast evening's sessions to produce
little progress.
Firestone offered hourly pay raises total
ing 51.55 over three years. 60 cents in the
first year, and what it termed an uncapped

cost-of-living adjustment plus pension,
health and other fringe benefit boosts.
Bommarito disputed the description of
the cost-of-living factor as unlimited, saying
it wouldn't provide any money until April
1978 and was restricted by the terms on
which it would be triggered.
And he called the general wage increase
"short on what we need for a cost-of-living
catch-up for 1976 alone."
He said earlier that the URW's total
economic demands would raise the current
average total package of 59.05 an hour by
42 percent. Current average hourly pay
was $5.50, the URW said.
