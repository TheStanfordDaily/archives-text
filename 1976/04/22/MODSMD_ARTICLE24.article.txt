# The 						best among area bike tours
## 
### Dave Ansley 
If you'll lift your had from that
book for a moment, you might
notice that springtime has finally
come to the Farm. It is that season
for flowers and birds and green
grass and mumblety-peg, and
neither God nor Little Leland, in
their infinite wisdom, intended that
we spend every afternoon of it in
the library.
So drop that pen from your
sweaty grip, flex your fingers a few
times, wrap them around the
handlebars of your bicycle and
head for the hills.
G'wan. Git.
Get away from the musty halls
of academe and enjoy a few hours
of fresh air and sun.
Be it a Schwinn tank with coas
ter brakes or a 10-speed Gitane
lightweight, your bike is an inex
pensive way to see a lot of beauti
ful countryside, and this area is
plentiful in that commodity.
For every combination of bicy
cle, leg strength and free time that
exists, there is a bike route around
here to match it perfectly.
The most enjoyable way to find
these routes is to follow your nose.
Go out Campus Drive to Junipero
Serra Boulevard and turn either
right or left.
Take Palm Drive, Galvez Street
or Serra Street into Palo Alto and
explore.
Or you can follow El Camino
into any nearby town, and turn off
onto any side streets that strike
your fancy. The higher-class resi
dential districts in Menlo Park and
Atherton offer twisty shaded
streets and little traffic.
If you prefer cows and horses to
kids and houses, Sand Hill Road,
Page Mill Road and Alpine Road
all cross Interstate 280 and wind
through the farms and wooded
hills in the Portola Valley area.
You can buy the Stanford Area
Bicycle Trip Guidebook, if you
want to research the topic first.
Available in the bookstore for
$1.50, it lists 50 bike trips for all
levels of ability.
Everything from half-mile jaunts
to Palo Alto parks to 120-mile

overnight marathons are
suggested, all with complete di
rections and travel tips.
Published by the Stanford Con
servation Group, it divides the
Midpeninsula into six regions and
offers a choice of tours in each.
For example, under "Local
Rides," the pamphlet tells you
how to get to the "Sharon Heights
Picnic Spot":
"This is a pleasant grassy area
with a small pond. Leave campus
via the Searsville bike path, turn
ing left onto Willow Road. Willow
becomes Sand Hill Road as it
crosses Alpine Road. Continue
2/3 of the way up Sand Hill, turning
right onto Monte Rosa Drive. The
park is on the left at the intersec
tion with Sharon Park Drive. Dis
tance: 2 miles."
The more industrious can try
Hill Country, which describes the
"Kings Mountain Loop." It in
cludes "a pretty four mile climb to
the Skeggs Point Lookout (el.
2300 feet)."
Wherever you go and however
you get there, remember to take
along a few accessories to make
the ride more enjoyable.
A small tube patch kit and a bike
pump are necessities, unless you
really enjoy walking your crippled
bike home. Local road maps come
in handy for long trips, since
neither the sun nor the North Star
are always around to help out.
If you purchase the guidebook,
there are a few maps inside illus
trating the routes. For a more
complete street directory, the
Stanford Bookstore also sells for
$1 a street map of Midpeninsula
cities. Or you can try to find a gas
station that still hands them out.
To find out where the hills are in
advance, buy a topographic map
of the area from U.S. Geographic
Survey Map Center in Menlo Park.
Any bike riders who plan to be
away from their favorite food ser
vice for several hours should con
sider carrying some sustenance.
Light foods that provide quick
energy are a must.

Try fresh fruits, candy bars or
gorp. Gorp, long a favorite of hik
ers, is a mixture of nuts, dried
fruits and chocolate chips.
For liquid refreshment, water or
fruit juices are best.
And of course, one of the most
important accessories is a com
panion, of whatever sex you pre
fer.
But don't pay so much attention
to your partner that you stop pay
ing attention to the road. Bicycle
riders will come out on the losing
end in any confrontation with a
motor vehicle, and your chem prof
would like to see you in class
again tomorrow.
The Stanford Department of
Public Safety has a comic book
called Sprocket Man which exp
lains all the rules and regulations
involved.
According to the guidebook,
cyclists are entitled to five feet at
the right-hand edge of any road,
except where bicycles are prohi
bited by signs. Appreciate the op
portunity; not all places have it.
You haven't truly lived until you've
attempted to share a narrow two
lane road with a couple of large
logging trucks. Would you believe
the route sign said "U.S. 101"?
The bicycle is the most efficient
form of transportation around.
Use it.

CAMPUS PATH—Just past Roble and Lagunita, this path offers
cyclists a not-so-short cut to Sand Hill Road.
If you'll lift your had from that
book for a moment, you might
notice that springtime has finally
come to the Farm. It is that season
for flowers and birds and green
grass and mumblety-peg, and
neither God nor Little Leland, in
their infinite wisdom, intended that
we spend every afternoon of it in
the library.
So drop that pen from your
sweaty grip, flex your fingers a few
times, wrap them around the
handlebars of your bicycle and
head for the hills.
G'wan. Git.
Get away from the musty halls
of academe and enjoy a few hours
of fresh air and sun.
Be it a Schwinn tank with coas
ter brakes or a 10-speed Gitane
lightweight, your bike is an inex
pensive way to see a lot of beauti
ful countryside, and this area is
plentiful in that commodity.
For every combination of bicy
cle, leg strength and free time that
exists, there is a bike route around
here to match it perfectly.
The most enjoyable way to find
these routes is to follow your nose.
Go out Campus Drive to Junipero
Serra Boulevard and turn either
right or left.
Take Palm Drive, Galvez Street
or Serra Street into Palo Alto and
explore.
Or you can follow El Camino
into any nearby town, and turn off
onto any side streets that strike
your fancy. The higher-class resi
dential districts in Menlo Park and
Atherton offer twisty shaded
streets and little traffic.
If you prefer cows and horses to
kids and houses, Sand Hill Road,
Page Mill Road and Alpine Road
all cross Interstate 280 and wind
through the farms and wooded
hills in the Portola Valley area.
You can buy the Stanford Area
Bicycle Trip Guidebook, if you
want to research the topic first.
Available in the bookstore for
$1.50, it lists 50 bike trips for all
levels of ability.
Everything from half-mile jaunts
to Palo Alto parks to 120-mile

overnight marathons are
suggested, all with complete di
rections and travel tips.
Published by the Stanford Con
servation Group, it divides the
Midpeninsula into six regions and
offers a choice of tours in each.
For example, under "Local
Rides," the pamphlet tells you
how to get to the "Sharon Heights
Picnic Spot":
"This is a pleasant grassy area
with a small pond. Leave campus
via the Searsville bike path, turn
ing left onto Willow Road. Willow
becomes Sand Hill Road as it
crosses Alpine Road. Continue
2/3 of the way up Sand Hill, turning
right onto Monte Rosa Drive. The
park is on the left at the intersec
tion with Sharon Park Drive. Dis
tance: 2 miles."
The more industrious can try
Hill Country, which describes the
"Kings Mountain Loop." It in
cludes "a pretty four mile climb to
the Skeggs Point Lookout (el.
2300 feet)."
Wherever you go and however
you get there, remember to take
along a few accessories to make
the ride more enjoyable.
A small tube patch kit and a bike
pump are necessities, unless you
really enjoy walking your crippled
bike home. Local road maps come
in handy for long trips, since
neither the sun nor the North Star
are always around to help out.
If you purchase the guidebook,
there are a few maps inside illus
trating the routes. For a more
complete street directory, the
Stanford Bookstore also sells for
$1 a street map of Midpeninsula
cities. Or you can try to find a gas
station that still hands them out.
To find out where the hills are in
advance, buy a topographic map
of the area from U.S. Geographic
Survey Map Center in Menlo Park.
Any bike riders who plan to be
away from their favorite food ser
vice for several hours should con
sider carrying some sustenance.
Light foods that provide quick
energy are a must.

Try fresh fruits, candy bars or
gorp. Gorp, long a favorite of hik
ers, is a mixture of nuts, dried
fruits and chocolate chips.
For liquid refreshment, water or
fruit juices are best.
And of course, one of the most
important accessories is a com
panion, of whatever sex you pre
fer.
But don't pay so much attention
to your partner that you stop pay
ing attention to the road. Bicycle
riders will come out on the losing
end in any confrontation with a
motor vehicle, and your chem prof
would like to see you in class
again tomorrow.
The Stanford Department of
Public Safety has a comic book
called Sprocket Man which exp
lains all the rules and regulations
involved.
According to the guidebook,
cyclists are entitled to five feet at
the right-hand edge of any road,
except where bicycles are prohi
bited by signs. Appreciate the op
portunity; not all places have it.
You haven't truly lived until you've
attempted to share a narrow two
lane road with a couple of large
logging trucks. Would you believe
the route sign said "U.S. 101"?
The bicycle is the most efficient
form of transportation around.
Use it.

CAMPUS PATH—Just past Roble and Lagunita, this path offers
cyclists a not-so-short cut to Sand Hill Road.
If you'll lift your had from that
book for a moment, you might
notice that springtime has finally
come to the Farm. It is that season
for flowers and birds and green
grass and mumblety-peg, and
neither God nor Little Leland, in
their infinite wisdom, intended that
we spend every afternoon of it in
the library.
So drop that pen from your
sweaty grip, flex your fingers a few
times, wrap them around the
handlebars of your bicycle and
head for the hills.
G'wan. Git.
Get away from the musty halls
of academe and enjoy a few hours
of fresh air and sun.
Be it a Schwinn tank with coas
ter brakes or a 10-speed Gitane
lightweight, your bike is an inex
pensive way to see a lot of beauti
ful countryside, and this area is
plentiful in that commodity.
For every combination of bicy
cle, leg strength and free time that
exists, there is a bike route around
here to match it perfectly.
The most enjoyable way to find
these routes is to follow your nose.
Go out Campus Drive to Junipero
Serra Boulevard and turn either
right or left.
Take Palm Drive, Galvez Street
or Serra Street into Palo Alto and
explore.
Or you can follow El Camino
into any nearby town, and turn off
onto any side streets that strike
your fancy. The higher-class resi
dential districts in Menlo Park and
Atherton offer twisty shaded
streets and little traffic.
If you prefer cows and horses to
kids and houses, Sand Hill Road,
Page Mill Road and Alpine Road
all cross Interstate 280 and wind
through the farms and wooded
hills in the Portola Valley area.
You can buy the Stanford Area
Bicycle Trip Guidebook, if you
want to research the topic first.
Available in the bookstore for
$1.50, it lists 50 bike trips for all
levels of ability.
Everything from half-mile jaunts
to Palo Alto parks to 120-mile

overnight marathons are
suggested, all with complete di
rections and travel tips.
Published by the Stanford Con
servation Group, it divides the
Midpeninsula into six regions and
offers a choice of tours in each.
For example, under "Local
Rides," the pamphlet tells you
how to get to the "Sharon Heights
Picnic Spot":
"This is a pleasant grassy area
with a small pond. Leave campus
via the Searsville bike path, turn
ing left onto Willow Road. Willow
becomes Sand Hill Road as it
crosses Alpine Road. Continue
2/3 of the way up Sand Hill, turning
right onto Monte Rosa Drive. The
park is on the left at the intersec
tion with Sharon Park Drive. Dis
tance: 2 miles."
The more industrious can try
Hill Country, which describes the
"Kings Mountain Loop." It in
cludes "a pretty four mile climb to
the Skeggs Point Lookout (el.
2300 feet)."
Wherever you go and however
you get there, remember to take
along a few accessories to make
the ride more enjoyable.
A small tube patch kit and a bike
pump are necessities, unless you
really enjoy walking your crippled
bike home. Local road maps come
in handy for long trips, since
neither the sun nor the North Star
are always around to help out.
If you purchase the guidebook,
there are a few maps inside illus
trating the routes. For a more
complete street directory, the
Stanford Bookstore also sells for
$1 a street map of Midpeninsula
cities. Or you can try to find a gas
station that still hands them out.
To find out where the hills are in
advance, buy a topographic map
of the area from U.S. Geographic
Survey Map Center in Menlo Park.
Any bike riders who plan to be
away from their favorite food ser
vice for several hours should con
sider carrying some sustenance.
Light foods that provide quick
energy are a must.

Try fresh fruits, candy bars or
gorp. Gorp, long a favorite of hik
ers, is a mixture of nuts, dried
fruits and chocolate chips.
For liquid refreshment, water or
fruit juices are best.
And of course, one of the most
important accessories is a com
panion, of whatever sex you pre
fer.
But don't pay so much attention
to your partner that you stop pay
ing attention to the road. Bicycle
riders will come out on the losing
end in any confrontation with a
motor vehicle, and your chem prof
would like to see you in class
again tomorrow.
The Stanford Department of
Public Safety has a comic book
called Sprocket Man which exp
lains all the rules and regulations
involved.
According to the guidebook,
cyclists are entitled to five feet at
the right-hand edge of any road,
except where bicycles are prohi
bited by signs. Appreciate the op
portunity; not all places have it.
You haven't truly lived until you've
attempted to share a narrow two
lane road with a couple of large
logging trucks. Would you believe
the route sign said "U.S. 101"?
The bicycle is the most efficient
form of transportation around.
