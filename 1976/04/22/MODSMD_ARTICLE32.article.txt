# What to look for when you buy cycles
## 10-speeds The 						Stanford Shopping Bag 
### Kevin Ohlson 
So you are going to buy a 10-
speed bicycle, but you don't know
what to look for. What features
should a buyer look for, especially
for use around campus?
People should be careful of
what they are buying in bicycles."
said Greg McEllinney of the Palo
Alto Bike Shop. "Some of the

bikes sold in discount and depart
ment stores are made like toys."
Most lower-priced 10-speeds of
any quality cost $130-5200 and
weigh 26 to 30 pounds
McEllinney explained what to

look for when shopping around for
a 10-speed bicycle.
Frame
The frame tubes should be
connected by sleeves, and not
welded together. (Most American
bicycle frames are welded.)
Welded frames are heavier and
not as strong as frames with
sleeves.
The bike should be equipped
with center-pull brakes, rather
than side-pull. McEllinney has
tened to point out that inexpensive
center-pull brakes perform better
than inexpensive side-pull
brakes.
Axle mounts should be brazed

to the frame, rather than crimped.
Brazed mounts are stronger.
Quick release
Quick release axles are great if
you are constantly needing to re
move the rims. For campus use,
however, McEllinney said he
thinks that the security disadvan
tage outweighs any convenience.
A six-foot chain or cable should
be used for all bikes with quick
release axles.
While alloy rims save weight,
they are not as good as steel rims
for all-around use.
McEllinney says that as a gen
eral rule, bikes get lighter as the
prices increase. They use
stronger and lighter frame tubing,
lighter rims and tires, and stronger
and lighter drive systems.
$1000 price-tag
There are some brands of 10-
speeds which sell for more than
$1000.
Most manufacturers of 10-
speed bicycles offer a lifetime
frame guarantee and a six-month
rolling guarantee, excepting tires.
McEllinney pointed out that this
was a warranty against defects,
not against wear and tear.
And in the long run, the expen
sive machines are more economi
cal,McEllinney said.

QUICK RELEASE — Our consumer expert warns against quick
release axles for general campus biking; quick release makes your
wheels easy to remove, for you and for theives. Our expert also
recommends steel rims for all-around use.
