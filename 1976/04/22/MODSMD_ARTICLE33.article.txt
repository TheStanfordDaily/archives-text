# Mopeds
## 
### 
Moped sales are on the rise,
according to local merchants. Be
cause of a recent change in
California's vehicle code,
mopeds are now considered
bicycles.
Though the maximum allowa
ble speed is 30 miles per hour,
they are allowed on bike paths.
Some models obtain over 200
miles per gallon of a gas and oil
mixture.
They do not need to be regis
tered with the Department of
Motor Vehicles, thus saving a re
gistration fee.
Two local bicycle shops started
carrying the Motebecane moped
line about a month ago. According
to Tom Sweeney of Bayshore
Bike Works, Motebecane is the
oldest and largest manufacturer of
mopeds.
Price range
The Motebecane line includes
six models, ranging from $339 to
$509. At the bottom of the price
lineup is the Solex Horse.
Sweeney described this model
as a "bicycle with a motor on it." It
uses a friction drive system on the

front wheel, while the other mod
els feature rear wheel chain-drive
and drum brakes.
The more expensive models
have bigger tires, stainless steel
fenders, speedometer and a rear
suspension. The top-of-the-line
model has a "variator," which
Sweeney says is like an automatic
transmission and makes hill
climbing easier.
Erika Kavanagh of Olympic
Cyclery in Redwood City said that
there has been a tremendous re
sponse to mopeds since their in
troduction a few weeks ago.
Bike sales hurt?
She said that she is not afraid
that mopeds will cut into her bicy
cle sales, but will appeal to a diffe
rent group altogether.
She said she had noticed that
the 16- to 25-year-old age group
seems to be the most interested,
which she attributes to their high
insurance rates.
"Once people see them around
and become aware of their advan
tages, sales should increase even
more," she said.
