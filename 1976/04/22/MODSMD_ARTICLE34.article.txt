# The
						racing bicycle: a special machine

While most of us use our bikes
just to get from dorm to class and
back, a few athletes take their
cycling more seriously.
Bike racers demand more from
their cycles, and although racing
bikes may resemble other 10-
speeds in appearance, these
machines are special.
"They're basically the same
bike, but all the components are a
lot finer equipment. The big differ
ence is in the wheels," said un
dergrad David Voss, a regular

bike racer.
All racing bikes have tubular or
"sew up" tires, Voss explained.
"Sew-ups" weigh an average of
250 grams and are glued on to the
rim.
Racing tires also require from
100 to 120 pounds of pressure,
while an average tire requires be
tween 50 and 60 pounds.
The wheels themselves are
generally lighter than those on a
conventional 10-speed, as are the
frames.
Frames are usually made of al
loyed steel, Voss said, but "some
times they're made of bizarre
things like titanium."

both quick and strong. For
strength, the bike frame tubing is

though, be forewarned that these
beauties can run as much as
$1200.
"The cheapest racing bike
costs around $300, but the aver
age bike that people race proba
bly costs between $600 and
$700," Voss said.
Beside the hefty capital invest
ment, a license is required of bike
racers. The U.S. Cycling Federa
tion certifies bike racers at a cost
of $8.
In California, bike racers are re
quired to prove their racing
abilities in competency trials, usu
ally held between February and
March, Voss said.
