# Campus cops catch careless cyclists
## 
### Dan Fiduccia Mark Simonian 
If you re riding on campus and
you think the heat is off. you're
wrong.
Stanford Police Services
spokesmen say they are continu
ing to ticket bicyclists who run stop
signs, ride on the wrong side of the
street, etc
Very few moving violations
have actually been given out, ac
cording to police figures. Six were
issued in January, one in Feb
ruary and three in March. There
are none so far this month.
But. police say, if they see a

violation, they will not hesitate to
ticket.
Mechanical violations
A majority of the citations that
Stanford police have issued to
cyclists over the last few months
involve mechanical violations —
no front headlights, no side reflec
tors, etc. Already this month,
police have issued 11 mechanical
citations.
Last month 14 cyclists received
mechanical citations, while 15
were ticketed in February and 23
in January.
There is no fine for a mechani
cal citation, if the defect is cor
rected within 11 days, according

to Stanford police. The cost of a
moving violation depends on the
exact violation.
The best advice police give is to
escape the hassle of a ticket by
knowing the bicycle traffic laws
and obeying them. Cyclists have
many of the same obligations as
drivers.
Accidents
To avoid accidents, police
suggest that cyclists ride on the
right-hand side of the road, stop at
all stop signs and use a headlight
at night.
The only campus cycling fatality
occurred at night in June 1973 on
Escondido Road between Wilbur
and Stern Halls. Two riders
crashed head-on, and freshman
Robert Steele died of injuries.
Neither rider had a headlight on
his 10-speed.
Stanford police offer Sprocket
Man. a free, student-produced
comic book that describes bicycie
regulations and gives cyclists
some good tips on avoiding acci
dents. theft and other bike wor
ries.
Super hero
Conceived and drawn by un
dergrad Louis Saekow, the comic
employs a superhero-type
character to emphasize and exp
lain bike safety.
Stanford police paid $1300 to
print approximately 12,000 copies
of the comic. Saekow s work was
also sponsored by the Urban
Bikeway Design Collaborative
(ÜBDC), part of a national bike
safety organization.
Last fall, every student who re
gistered a bike on campus, com
plying with new state regulations,
received a copy of Sprocket Man.
And second-year law student
Julia Molander, who handled the
book's legal matters, said earlier
this week that elementary schools
may be interested in distributing
the comic to their students.

were ticketed in February and 23
in January.
There is no fine for a mechani
cal citation, if the defect is cor
rected within 11 days, according

to Stanford police. The cost of a
moving violation depends on the
exact violation.
The best advice police give is to
escape the hassle of a ticket by
knowing the bicycle traffic laws
and obeying them. Cyclists have
many of the same obligations as
drivers.
Accidents
To avoid accidents, police
suggest that cyclists ride on the
right-hand side of the road, stop at
all stop signs and use a headlight
at night.
The only campus cycling fatality
occurred at night in June 1973 on
Escondido Road between Wilbur
and Stern Halls. Two riders
crashed head-on, and freshman
Robert Steele died of injuries.
Neither rider had a headlight on
his 10-speed.
Stanford police offer Sprocket
Man. a free, student-produced
comic book that describes bicycie
regulations and gives cyclists
some good tips on avoiding acci
dents. theft and other bike wor
ries.
Super hero
Conceived and drawn by un
dergrad Louis Saekow, the comic
employs a superhero-type
character to emphasize and exp
lain bike safety.
Stanford police paid $1300 to
print approximately 12,000 copies
of the comic. Saekow s work was
also sponsored by the Urban
Bikeway Design Collaborative
(ÜBDC), part of a national bike
safety organization.
Last fall, every student who re
gistered a bike on campus, com
plying with new state regulations,
received a copy of Sprocket Man.
And second-year law student
Julia Molander, who handled the
book's legal matters, said earlier
this week that elementary schools
may be interested in distributing
the comic to their students.

NAILED —Stanford police say they are going to keep ticketing cyc
lists who disobey traffic or bike safety laws. Although police have
not racked up any moving violaticns this month, 11 cyclists have
been cited for mechanical violations.

If you re riding on campus and
you think the heat is off. you're
wrong.
Stanford Police Services
spokesmen say they are continu
ing to ticket bicyclists who run stop
signs, ride on the wrong side of the
street, etc
Very few moving violations
have actually been given out, ac
cording to police figures. Six were
issued in January, one in Feb
ruary and three in March. There
are none so far this month.
But. police say, if they see a

violation, they will not hesitate to
ticket.
Mechanical violations
A majority of the citations that
Stanford police have issued to
cyclists over the last few months
involve mechanical violations —
no front headlights, no side reflec
tors, etc. Already this month,
police have issued 11 mechanical
citations.
Last month 14 cyclists received
mechanical citations, while 15
were ticketed in February and 23
in January.
