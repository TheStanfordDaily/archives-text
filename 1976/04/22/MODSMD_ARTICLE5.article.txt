# On the virtue of tax evasion
## 
### 
Karl Bray is in prison today.
The young attorney s incarcera
tion began in April 1973. when he
was arrested by two Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) agents
and (14 hours later) charged with
"illegal possession of IRS insig
nia."
Bray's crime ostensibly was
possession of IRS seizure
notices, which actually are pub
licly available under the Freedom
of Information Act. His real danger
to the United States government,
however, was as an exponent of
tax rebellion, in which role he has
used the seizure notices.
Four days before his arrest,
Bray had led Salt Lake City's first
tax protest, marshalling 150 per
sons to march amidst a rainstorm.
According to the April Playboy, an
IRS field auditor responded to the
demonstration by saying, "The
IRS is going to get Karl Bray."
It got him — and again later, on
additional charges of failure to file
his income tax form.
Rumored millions
What the IRS apparently cannot
reach, however, is the rumored
millions of United States tax
payers who are quietly, deftly re
fusing to pay up.
Playboy's report said a "bare
minimum estimate" of the number
who have quit paying is about four
million, noting that the IRS in 1972
admitted finding one million illegal
failures-to-file.
U.S. News and World Report
reported the following year that "A
tax dodging spree, spreading
rapidly, is costing the government
in Washington at least six billion
dollars a year and threatening to
get completely out of hand
. . . Tax experts outside the
IRS . . . put the real losses as high
as five times that much."
The government has no desire
to see this revolt magnified by pub
licity. But it is finding it increasingly
hard to ignore the 100,000 per
sons who have publicly refused to
pay their taxes. Some of these are
cantankerous kooks, yet others
have developed themselves into
shrewd tax battlers.

The public resisters to taxing
authorities have utilized two
common means for avoiding
payment. One is to refuse to ans
wer pertinent questions on in
come tax forms on Fifth Amend
ment self-incrimination grounds.
The other takes advantage of
antiquated (but still effective) fed
eral statutes equating the dollar
with a certain value in gold or
silver. Because federal reserve
notes have not been backed by
either metal since 1968, the ar
gument is made that dollars perse
do not now exist and that no one
has earned any income.

Both approaches, though occa
sionally successful, are often falli
ble. The government reserves the
right to compute the tax liability of
those who refuse to do so them
selves.
But both tactics can be effective
in making an overburdened IRS
do the dirty work itself and not rely
on the voluntary compliance of
Americans. If millions utilized
these means, the burden placed
on the IRS would undoubtedly be
debilitating.
IRS smarting
The IRS is already smarting
from the more subtle moves of
millions who are hiding their in
come or exempting it from taxa
tion through liberal "religious"
clauses.
In addition, outright falsehoods
may be working for a large
number. The IRS revealed last
week that only 27 percent of 1973
returns were matched against
W-2 and other income-reporting
forms.
The agency is seeking funds to
increase this percentage to 42
percent each year.

With the addition of each new
tax evader, those already resist
ing become more difficult to catch
and prosecute. Indeed, a common
moral standard which views taxa
tion as just and the avoidance of
taxes as theft may be all that is
preventing a snowballing of tax
resistance.
Taxation as theft
Will that morality change?
Most constructions of a natural
rights philosophy already hold
taxation as theft. The continual
increase of tax rates and the con
comitantly increasing suspicion of
the use of tax revenues may be
pushing utilitarians as well into the
view that tax avoidance is socially
optimal.
It can be so viewed in one par
ticular regard: Non-payment of
taxes is the answer to the question
often posed to the apolitical: "How
can one change the course of
government except through poli
tics?"
The answer is this: An expand
ing government, when deprived of
large and larger amounts of tax
revenue, has but two choices to
repair its gaping deficit. One is
borrowing (to which there is a
market limit); the other is the print
ing press.
Hyper-inflation of the money
supply leads to a point at which
the government's fiat currency is
no longer accepted. It is at this
point that the national government
is truly bankrupt and can no longer
function.
Taxpayers of the United Slates
thus hold in their hands the key to
the future of the government; by
keeping what is theirs, as they are
doing in ever-larger numbers,
they place a finite limit on the
state.
In this regard, one needn't
agree that taxes are wrong per se
to realize the virtue of tax evasion.

Karl Bray is in prison today.
The young attorney s incarcera
tion began in April 1973. when he
was arrested by two Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) agents
and (14 hours later) charged with
"illegal possession of IRS insig
nia."
Bray's crime ostensibly was
possession of IRS seizure
notices, which actually are pub
licly available under the Freedom
of Information Act. His real danger
to the United States government,
however, was as an exponent of
tax rebellion, in which role he has
used the seizure notices.
Four days before his arrest,
Bray had led Salt Lake City's first
tax protest, marshalling 150 per
sons to march amidst a rainstorm.
According to the April Playboy, an
IRS field auditor responded to the
demonstration by saying, "The
IRS is going to get Karl Bray."
It got him — and again later, on
additional charges of failure to file
his income tax form.
Rumored millions
What the IRS apparently cannot
reach, however, is the rumored
millions of United States tax
payers who are quietly, deftly re
fusing to pay up.
Playboy's report said a "bare
minimum estimate" of the number
who have quit paying is about four
million, noting that the IRS in 1972
admitted finding one million illegal
failures-to-file.
U.S. News and World Report
reported the following year that "A
tax dodging spree, spreading
rapidly, is costing the government
in Washington at least six billion
dollars a year and threatening to
get completely out of hand
. . . Tax experts outside the
IRS . . . put the real losses as high
as five times that much."
The government has no desire
to see this revolt magnified by pub
licity. But it is finding it increasingly
hard to ignore the 100,000 per
sons who have publicly refused to
pay their taxes. Some of these are
cantankerous kooks, yet others
have developed themselves into
shrewd tax battlers.

The public resisters to taxing
authorities have utilized two
common means for avoiding
payment. One is to refuse to ans
wer pertinent questions on in
come tax forms on Fifth Amend
ment self-incrimination grounds.
The other takes advantage of
antiquated (but still effective) fed
eral statutes equating the dollar
with a certain value in gold or
silver. Because federal reserve
notes have not been backed by
either metal since 1968, the ar
gument is made that dollars perse
do not now exist and that no one
has earned any income.

Both approaches, though occa
sionally successful, are often falli
ble. The government reserves the
right to compute the tax liability of
those who refuse to do so them
selves.
But both tactics can be effective
in making an overburdened IRS
do the dirty work itself and not rely
on the voluntary compliance of
Americans. If millions utilized
these means, the burden placed
on the IRS would undoubtedly be
debilitating.
IRS smarting
The IRS is already smarting
from the more subtle moves of
millions who are hiding their in
come or exempting it from taxa
tion through liberal "religious"
clauses.
In addition, outright falsehoods
may be working for a large
number. The IRS revealed last
week that only 27 percent of 1973
returns were matched against
W-2 and other income-reporting
forms.
The agency is seeking funds to
increase this percentage to 42
percent each year.

With the addition of each new
tax evader, those already resist
ing become more difficult to catch
and prosecute. Indeed, a common
moral standard which views taxa
tion as just and the avoidance of
taxes as theft may be all that is
preventing a snowballing of tax
resistance.
Taxation as theft
Will that morality change?
Most constructions of a natural
rights philosophy already hold
taxation as theft. The continual
increase of tax rates and the con
comitantly increasing suspicion of
the use of tax revenues may be
pushing utilitarians as well into the
view that tax avoidance is socially
optimal.
It can be so viewed in one par
ticular regard: Non-payment of
taxes is the answer to the question
often posed to the apolitical: "How
can one change the course of
government except through poli
tics?"
The answer is this: An expand
ing government, when deprived of
large and larger amounts of tax
revenue, has but two choices to
repair its gaping deficit. One is
borrowing (to which there is a
market limit); the other is the print
ing press.
Hyper-inflation of the money
supply leads to a point at which
the government's fiat currency is
no longer accepted. It is at this
point that the national government
is truly bankrupt and can no longer
function.
Taxpayers of the United Slates
thus hold in their hands the key to
the future of the government; by
keeping what is theirs, as they are
doing in ever-larger numbers,
they place a finite limit on the
state.
In this regard, one needn't
agree that taxes are wrong per se
to realize the virtue of tax evasion.

tion began in April 1973. when he
was arrested by two Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) agents
and (14 hours later) charged with
"illegal possession of IRS insig
nia."
Bray's crime ostensibly was
possession of IRS seizure
notices, which actually are pub
licly available under the Freedom
of Information Act. His real danger
to the United States government,
however, was as an exponent of
tax rebellion, in which role he has
used the seizure notices.
Four days before his arrest,
Bray had led Salt Lake City's first
tax protest, marshalling 150 per
sons to march amidst a rainstorm.
According to the April Playboy, an
IRS field auditor responded to the
demonstration by saying, "The
IRS is going to get Karl Bray."
It got him — and again later, on
additional charges of failure to file
his income tax form.
Rumored millions
What the IRS apparently cannot
reach, however, is the rumored
millions of United States tax
payers who are quietly, deftly re
fusing to pay up.
Playboy's report said a "bare
minimum estimate" of the number
who have quit paying is about four
million, noting that the IRS in 1972
admitted finding one million illegal
failures-to-file.
U.S. News and World Report
reported the following year that "A
tax dodging spree, spreading
rapidly, is costing the government
in Washington at least six billion
dollars a year and threatening to
get completely out of hand
. . . Tax experts outside the
IRS . . . put the real losses as high
as five times that much."
The government has no desire
to see this revolt magnified by pub
licity. But it is finding it increasingly
hard to ignore the 100,000 per
sons who have publicly refused to
pay their taxes. Some of these are
cantankerous kooks, yet others
have developed themselves into
shrewd tax battlers.

The public resisters to taxing
authorities have utilized two
common means for avoiding
payment. One is to refuse to ans
wer pertinent questions on in
come tax forms on Fifth Amend
ment self-incrimination grounds.
The other takes advantage of
antiquated (but still effective) fed
eral statutes equating the dollar
with a certain value in gold or
silver. Because federal reserve
notes have not been backed by
either metal since 1968, the ar
gument is made that dollars perse
do not now exist and that no one
has earned any income.

Both approaches, though occa
sionally successful, are often falli
ble. The government reserves the
right to compute the tax liability of
those who refuse to do so them
selves.
But both tactics can be effective
in making an overburdened IRS
do the dirty work itself and not rely
on the voluntary compliance of
Americans. If millions utilized
these means, the burden placed
on the IRS would undoubtedly be
debilitating.
IRS smarting
The IRS is already smarting
from the more subtle moves of
millions who are hiding their in
come or exempting it from taxa
tion through liberal "religious"
clauses.
In addition, outright falsehoods
may be working for a large
number. The IRS revealed last
week that only 27 percent of 1973
returns were matched against
W-2 and other income-reporting
forms.
The agency is seeking funds to
increase this percentage to 42
percent each year.

With the addition of each new
tax evader, those already resist
ing become more difficult to catch
and prosecute. Indeed, a common
moral standard which views taxa
tion as just and the avoidance of
taxes as theft may be all that is
preventing a snowballing of tax
resistance.
Taxation as theft
Will that morality change?
Most constructions of a natural
rights philosophy already hold
taxation as theft. The continual
increase of tax rates and the con
comitantly increasing suspicion of
the use of tax revenues may be
pushing utilitarians as well into the
view that tax avoidance is socially
optimal.
It can be so viewed in one par
ticular regard: Non-payment of
taxes is the answer to the question
often posed to the apolitical: "How
can one change the course of
government except through poli
tics?"
The answer is this: An expand
ing government, when deprived of
large and larger amounts of tax
revenue, has but two choices to
repair its gaping deficit. One is
borrowing (to which there is a
market limit); the other is the print
ing press.
Hyper-inflation of the money
supply leads to a point at which
the government's fiat currency is
no longer accepted. It is at this
point that the national government
is truly bankrupt and can no longer
function.
Taxpayers of the United Slates
thus hold in their hands the key to
the future of the government; by
keeping what is theirs, as they are
doing in ever-larger numbers,
they place a finite limit on the
state.
In this regard, one needn't
agree that taxes are wrong per se
to realize the virtue of tax evasion.
