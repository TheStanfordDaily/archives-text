### Marc Strassman 
Sun images and promises of tax
reform dominated the presenta
tion of Norman Shaskey, a candi
date for the Democratic congres
sional nomination in the 12th Dis
trict, when he brought his cam
paign here yesterday afternoon.
Shaskey, anM.A.in economics,
a governing board member of
Foothill-De Anza Community Col
lege District, a former Eagle Sc
out, a former student body presi
dent of the University of California
at Santa Barbara and former in
structor of economics and earth
sciences at Santa Barbara City
College, spoke to a dozen people
in a corner of the Roble Lounge.
Shaskey called for the rapid de
velopment of solar energv, saying
that "the sun can provide 60 to 70
percent of our country's energy
needs";he advocated "a sunset
law," in which all laws, agencies
and programs would have a ter
mination date when originally
created, and said he favors
"sunshine bills' which would re
torm the process ot political lobby
ing, exposing more of its opera
tions to the light of day.
He said he was in favor of the
Equal Rights Amendment, a
negative income tax and the es

tablishment of educational trust
accounts, a system in which pa
rents could set aside tax-exempt
and interest earning money for the
tuition and living expenses of their
children as they pursue their voca
tional training or other educational
goals.
He called the foreign tax credit
now enjoyed by multinational cor
porations "a ridiculous loophole"
and cited it as a principle reason
why those corporations have
"grown so strong."
He also called for an "acceler
ated depreciation allowance
schedule" that he said would en
courage more private investment
and create more jobs.
Regarding the defense budget,
Shaskey said that "President Ford
is asking $10 billion too much." He
disapprovingly compared the cost
of a single Trident submarine
($l.l billion) with the cost of the
entire Coast Guard (S1 billion, ac
cording to Shaskey) which he said
could use additional ships.
He attacked what he said was
the disproportionate ratio of gen
erals and admirals to enlisted per
sons, saying that the armed forces
are "more top heavy with brass
than they were in World War II."



Norman Shaskey ~ D "' lv pl ""° R * n " y K "' h
tion in the domestic affairs of other
countries, specifically in such
cases as Lebanon and the
Dominican Republic; he also said
"we have to protect ourselves; if
we're strong, people will respect
us, and won't attack us."
He also cautioned, "We've
reached nuclear overkill," and he
added that "the government
should not be locked into nuclear
options." He said he favored pas
sage of Proposition 15, the so
called "nuclear shutdown" initia
tive.
Shaskey also briefly discussed
his proposal for a constitutional
amendment that would extend the
concepts of initiative and referen
dum to the national level.
According to his plan, if 20 per
cent of the voters in three quarters
of the states supported a prop
osed law, it would be voted on in a
national initiative. If the legislation
passed, said Shaskey, "the Sup
reme Court would still have the

power to declare it unconstitu
tional. It wouldn't mean the citi
zens would rule, but they, like the
Congress, would be able to pass
laws."
He said that under such a sys
tem, the Vietnam war would have
ended eight years sooner, and at
considerably less cost.
Shaskey also outlined his views
on:
—Senate Bill 1: "S.B. 1 is very
repressive and should be de
feated."
—abortion: "A woman has the
right to control her body. I wouldn't
want my wife to have one: but it's
up to her."
—marijuana: "The government
should remove personal penalties
for possession. Individuals should
be allowed to grow six or 10 plants
for their personal use."
The candidate said that he was
interested in "making the gov
ernment more responsive and
changing the direction of the last
few years."
