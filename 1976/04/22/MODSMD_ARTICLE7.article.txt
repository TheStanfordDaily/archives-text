# Racial violence flares in Boston

BOSTON (AP) — Strife torn
Boston is being hit by new acts of
racial brutality as spring ap
proaches the New England city.
A white auto mechanic lies
near death with a battered face
and a damaged brain; a black
lawyer has a broken nose; two
black bus drivers are cut and
bruised: these are the random vic
tims of the new wave of violence.
Since court-ordered school in
tegration began almost two years
ago, Boston has been wracked by
spasms of fighting between
blacks and whites followed by lulls
of quiet tension.
A decision by Judge W. Arthur
Garrity Jr. in U.S. District Court
started buses rolling between
schools in black and white
neighborhoods in September

1974. And it ignited a serious
ethnic conflict.
The violence usually is confined
to white neighborhoods — South
Boston and Charlestown — and
the streets around the low-income
housing projects in largely black
Roxbury.
Poorest neighborhoods
They are the poorest neighbor
hoods of a city made up of people
on low incomes These areas are
either all white or all black. Bos
ton s population is 20 percent
black.
The latest trouble began April 5,
when about 200 whites marched
downtown for an antibusing de
monstration Many of them were
pupils who skipped classes at
South Boston and Charlestown
high schools.

In front of City Hall, some of
them attacked a passerby, a black
lawyer who is executive director of
the Contractors Association of
Boston
Before television cameras and
newspaper photographers.
Theodore Landsmark was club
bed with the staff of an American
flag, beaten to the ground and
kicked
Attack denounced
The attack was denounced by
black politicians. Within the next
few days, a black girl was cut
when a rock smashed through a
bus window, a white bus driver
was assaulted by black youths
and cut on the face, and cars dri
ven by whites were stoned by
blacks.
Tensions seemed to ease a bit
until last Saturday, when two
black bus drivers were attacked
by a gang of whites as they sat on
a bench outside a bus station in
South Boston They were beaten
and whipped with a car antenna
Then on Monday night, a white
auto mechanic was hit with a brick
as he sat in his car waiting for the
light to change at an intersection
in Roxbury near the Orchard Park
housing project
Mangled face
While the driver of another veh
icle watched helplessly, the white
man was dragged from his car and
beaten with bricks and rocks.
When police arrived, they said his
face was mangled beyond recog
nition.
Before the incident, a caller had
warned police that there might be
trouble in the housing project and
that a group of blacks "had a look
out for whitey."
At Boston City Hospital,
spokesmen said the victim.
Richard Poleet, 34. suffered brain
damage, and his chances of sur
vival were slim.
Police arrested two black
youths, a 16-year-old ninth grader
and Randy Lewis, 19 Lewis
pleaded innocent yesterday to
charges of assault with intent to
murder and robbery of Poleet s
wallet and was held on $25,000
bail.
