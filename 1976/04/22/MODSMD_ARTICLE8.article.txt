A Palo Alto physician was arrested in his office Monday on the charge
of violating a California law which prohibits the use of the vitamin Laetrile
as a cancer treatment.
Stewart Jones, a graduate of the medical school here, is charged
with prescribing Laetrile to his cancer patients.
Jones was not available for comment on the charges.
Also arrested for alleged violation of the controversial cancer therapy
law is Charles Hoiles, owner of the Liberty Bookstore in Mountain View.
Hoiles said yesterday that he "supposedly sold amygdalin. which they

Choice in Cancer Therapy for over
two years and said that his interest
in Laetrile stems from his "funda
mental principles and the constitu

The Liberty Bookstore, accord

of the Committee For Freedom of
Choice, sells Laetrile as a "per

purchaser must, however, sign an
"informed consent" stating that
"he or she does not have cancer
and is not using it for that pur
pose." he added
Bradford, currently on a leave of
absence from his staff position at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC), labeled the
charges against Jones ' part of
the continual harassment ... to
scare doctors away from
metabolic therapy."
He criticized American interven-
