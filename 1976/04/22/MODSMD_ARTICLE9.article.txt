# Alums read Jefferson, Adams

"It is the normal instinct of
philosophers to communicate.
Thomas Jefferson wrote in a per
sonal letter to his good friend and
colleague John Adams.
A dramatic reading of selec
tions from the letters of these two
statesmen, presented to a group
of about 75 persons at Tresidder
Lounge Tuesday night,
exemplified the ideological and
political communication which
existed between the two
philosophers for more than 13
years.
Jefferson, whose letters were
read by Dick Arnold, a Stanford
alumnus, spanned a period from
1813 to 1826 and documented
Jefferson's careful planning and
building of the University of Vir
ginia.
Paul Spiegel, also a Stanford
alumnus, read the letters of
Adams, a man of subtle wit and
decided political views.
Diverse views
The writings encompassed not
only the two men's political views,
which had grown apart with time,
but their philosophical and moral
standson the issues of their day
The men's letters, excerpted
from the book entitled Jefferson
to Adams, Adams to Jefferson,
were originally sent via
stagecoach from Adams' home in
Quincy. Massachusetts to Mon
ticello, Virginia, and from Mon
ticello to Quincy. Jefferson himself
notes surprise when a reply is re
ceived from Adams in a record
seven days.
During the course of their cor
respondence, Jefferson notes
that he has been approached by a
publisher who had "the effrontery"
to ask him to publish his letters to
Adams. Jefferson concludes that
these publishers would print any
thing "as long as there were
money to be made."
'Too fat'
Adams, who claims that he is
"still too fat to last much longer," is
constantly examining and ex
pounding on the political situation

of both Europe and the United
States. France, he said, "was a
den of robbers," and England, "a
den of pirates."
"Britain," he wrote to Jefferson,
"will never be our friend till we are
her master."
The correspondence between
the two men offers an interesting
perspective on history; events of
the day are viewed in a much diffe
rent light than that by which they
are now seen.
Inherent humor
Though most of the letters are
quite serious in content, it is pos
sible to detect the humor inherent
in both men.
Adams and Jefferson agree on
the impossibility of mastering
Plato's Republic. Adams calls the
work a "severe task." After com
pleting the "task" Jefferson asks
Adams, "Is this life?"
Between these two men was an
affection that lasted through politi

cal disagreement as well as
philosophical disunity. Each com
forts the other in times of sadness,
however, and it is Adams who
admits to Jefferson that, "You and
I ought not to die before we exp
lain ourselves to each other."
Both Adams and Jefferson died
on July 4,1826 within four hours of
each other and on the 50th an
niversary of the independence of
the country they had helped to
found.

ticello to Quincy. Jefferson himself
notes surprise when a reply is re
ceived from Adams in a record
seven days.
During the course of their cor
respondence, Jefferson notes
that he has been approached by a
publisher who had "the effrontery"
to ask him to publish his letters to
Adams. Jefferson concludes that
these publishers would print any
thing "as long as there were
money to be made."
'Too fat'
Adams, who claims that he is
"still too fat to last much longer," is
constantly examining and ex
pounding on the political situation

of both Europe and the United
States. France, he said, "was a
den of robbers," and England, "a
den of pirates."
"Britain," he wrote to Jefferson,
"will never be our friend till we are
her master."
The correspondence between
the two men offers an interesting
perspective on history; events of
the day are viewed in a much diffe
rent light than that by which they
are now seen.
Inherent humor
Though most of the letters are
quite serious in content, it is pos
sible to detect the humor inherent
in both men.
Adams and Jefferson agree on
the impossibility of mastering
Plato's Republic. Adams calls the
work a "severe task." After com
pleting the "task" Jefferson asks
Adams, "Is this life?"
Between these two men was an
affection that lasted through politi

cal disagreement as well as
philosophical disunity. Each com
forts the other in times of sadness,
however, and it is Adams who
admits to Jefferson that, "You and
I ought not to die before we exp
lain ourselves to each other."
Both Adams and Jefferson died
on July 4,1826 within four hours of
each other and on the 50th an
niversary of the independence of
the country they had helped to
found.
"It is the normal instinct of
philosophers to communicate.
Thomas Jefferson wrote in a per
sonal letter to his good friend and
colleague John Adams.
A dramatic reading of selec
tions from the letters of these two
statesmen, presented to a group
of about 75 persons at Tresidder
Lounge Tuesday night,
exemplified the ideological and
political communication which
existed between the two
philosophers for more than 13
years.
Jefferson, whose letters were
read by Dick Arnold, a Stanford
alumnus, spanned a period from
1813 to 1826 and documented
Jefferson's careful planning and
building of the University of Vir
ginia.
Paul Spiegel, also a Stanford
alumnus, read the letters of
Adams, a man of subtle wit and
decided political views.
Diverse views
The writings encompassed not
only the two men's political views,
which had grown apart with time,
but their philosophical and moral
standson the issues of their day
The men's letters, excerpted
from the book entitled Jefferson
to Adams, Adams to Jefferson,
were originally sent via
stagecoach from Adams' home in
Quincy. Massachusetts to Mon
ticello, Virginia, and from Mon
ticello to Quincy. Jefferson himself
