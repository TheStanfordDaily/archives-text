"It is the normal instinct of
philosophers to communicate.
Thomas Jefferson wrote in a per
sonal letter to his good friend and
colleague John Adams.
A dramatic reading of selec
tions from the letters of these two
statesmen, presented to a group
of about 75 persons at Tresidder
Lounge Tuesday night,
exemplified the ideological and
political communication which
existed between the two
philosophers for more than 13
years.
Jefferson, whose letters were
read by Dick Arnold, a Stanford
alumnus, spanned a period from
1813 to 1826 and documented
Jefferson's careful planning and
building of the University of Vir
ginia.
Paul Spiegel, also a Stanford
alumnus, read the letters of
Adams, a man of subtle wit and
decided political views.
Diverse views
The writings encompassed not
only the two men's political views,
which had grown apart with time,
but their philosophical and moral
standson the issues of their day
