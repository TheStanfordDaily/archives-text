braunstein, speaker of the Legislature
jIN5: The recently-adopted proposals from the C/15 regurdini;
an ij.J.C. and an tt.C.L.C.
Th.ere were a nuaber of memoranda exchanged prior to the
election of Oct. 14-15, dealing with the interpretations
of vurious people as to Just what a favorable vote on
the C/1S proposal would mean. Some of thece nemos were
conflicting, and I have since been asked by the admin
istration and the faculty to clarify just what we think
the vote meant. I have prepared the following brief
statement, and I would like to ask you to endorse it
as an official position of the legislature:
The legislature has ratified the results of the election
of Oct. In that election, a measure calling for
the adoption of the C/15 proposals for a Conduct Leg
islative Council and a Judicial Council until March 1
received 82.4% of the votes cast.
The legal effect of that vote was:
1) To suspend the Judicial sections of the JUiSU Con
stitution until March 1;
2) To grant legitimacy to the S.J.C. and the S.C.L.C.
in the area of student affairs until March 1.
If the Coaaittee-of-15 will propose a new Charter, embodying
realietie amendment provisions, the Legislature of the
Associated Students will promptly bring it to a vote of
the student body.
The new Charter would require a 2/3 affirmative vote,
among those voting in a general election, for paaaage. The
legal effect of auch a vote would be:
1) The peraanent suspension of tho Judicial aection of the
A.S.S.U. Constitution;
?.) To grant legitimacy in the area of student affairs to
auch Judicial and rule asking bodies as may have been
adopted.
