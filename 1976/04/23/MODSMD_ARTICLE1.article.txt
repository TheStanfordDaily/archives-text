# ASSU history reveals trend toward advocacy vs. services
## 
### John Larmer News Analysis 
The Vic Petroff slate has probably
ion the Council of Presidents (COP)
election. Is there any significance at
all in this event?
The answer is yes, if student politics
are viewed from an historical perspec
tive.
This year's results represent yet
another swing of the "student advo
, acy vs. student services" pendulum.
The pendulum has swung regularly
every April for the past several years.

ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum de
fines an "advocacy slate" as one that
emphasizes the part of the ASSU in
"the larger scheme of things in the
University." He defines a "services"
slate as one that sees "the role of the
ASSU as internally administrative"
and thus "oversees the operations of
the ASSU."
In 1973, advocacy (the Kevin
O'Crady slate) defeated services (the
Peter Van Petten slate). The next year,
services (the Mike Herman slate) beat
advocacy (the 800 Bacon slate). Last

year, advocacy (the Rosenbaum slate)
defeated services (the Kevin McDer
inott slate).
Now, the slate which leans toward
services is back in power.
Useful dichotomy
Although the slates of recent elec
tions have the tendency to play down
the "advocacy vs. services" aspect of
the elections, many observers find this
dichotomy useful in interpreting stu
dent politics here.
McDermott, for example, feels that

there are "almost like . . . political par
tins at Stanford."
He said he believes that a "pen
dulum effect" explains who is going to
win each year: The students, disen
chanted with the incumbent COP's ef
fectiveness, elect the slate which pro
motes the opposite approach.
Statements made during the
Bacon/Herman campaign highlight
the dichotomy especially well. The
Herman slate, in the April 16, 1974
Daily, explained: "We feel that the
primary role of the ASSU Council of
Presidents is to initiate, organize and
support effectively programs and ser
vices to students ..."
Educational and social change
The Bacon slate stated in the same
issue that" . . . theASSU Council of
Presidents should not restrict its ac
tivities to the area of student services
but should also deal with student in
volvement in educational and social
change ..."
Rosenbaum cautions against over
emphasizing the political implica
tions of the dichotomy. Asked if "ad
vocacy" meant "liberal" and "ser
vices" meant "conservative," he re
plied. "No. I don't think you can clas
sify it along those lines . . . There's a
danger when you start typing people
that way."
Opposite directions
Rosenbaum's view is bolstered by
the student voting record, which indi
cates that what is essentially the same
student body voted in opposite direc
tions at different times.
However, the frequently heated de
bate between proponents of the two
positions, combined with the repeated
incidence of COP slates which can be
identified more strongly with one side
or the other, indicate that the ASSU's
role in the University remains an issue
dividing student leaders.
