# CIA stirs up Lebanese war
## 
### 
Last December, unknown assailants mur
dered the ClA's Athens station chief,
Richard Welch. Although described at the
time as an innocent intelligence officer,
Welch has now been charged, by former
National Security Agency official Winslow
Peck, with directing the CIA program of aid
ing right wing Christian phalangists in their
attempt to stave off leftist Moslem majority
rule in Lebanon.
The charge is particularly serious for two
reasons.First, Congress has almost certainly
not been informed of the operation. And
second, with over 15,000 dead and 32,000
wounded from thefighting, any CIA arms or
financial support could only be considered
a criminal prolongation of the suffering.
Peck's charge deserves to be taken seri
ously, in light of previous indications Qf a
concerted effort by the CIA to bolster ex
tremist phalangists.
The appointment of G. McMurtie Godley
as U.S. ambassador to Lebanon in January
1974 provoked a storm of comment even
from Lebanese government officials, for
Godley's career has been more like that of a
soldier than a diplomat.
He helped arrange the U.S. invasion of
Lebanon in 1958, helped the CIA suppress
revolts in the Congo in the early 19605, and
later almost single-handedly directed the
CIA war in Laos as ambassador.
Arms exports
Then, last May, in the midst of of the
fighting the State Department approved
arms export licenses to a Lebanese agent of
Colt Industries, to a value of $216,800. A
U.S. official assured a reporter that the arms
would not go to Palestinian groups, but
rather to "responsible elements, Christian
elements." Moreover, the previous January,
the same agent flew a secret planeload of
arms out of Bradley Airport in Connecticut,
destined for Beirut.

Last November, the Washington Post
learned that American arms dealer Samuel
Cummings, "linked to CIA-approved
causes in the past," sold $2.5 million worth
of arms to an extremist faction of the Christ
ian militia. Actually, Cummings served in
the CIA during the Korean War, from 1950-
52.

But arms can always be purchased in
Europe if the CIA won't release them di
rectly. The real question is where the
phalangists raise the estimated $4 million
each month required to equip their militia.
(The Moslems receive much of their support
from Libya, and formerly from Syria).
Funneling money
If Winslow Peck is correct, the CIA has
been funneling money into phalangist cof
fers through American banks in Greece,
which finance European arms purchases.
The phalangists are also said to receive
money from right wing forces in West Ger
many, and from Israel, Iran and Jordan, all
of which oppose the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO).
There arealso intriguing indications that
the phalangists raise considerable sums
through the international narcotics traffic.
Lebanon has long been a major center of the
traffic, a transhipment point between Tur
key and Marseille, France.
A Miami court trial last October of two

Lebanese accused of trying to smuggle $24
million worth of heroin into the U.S., re
vealed that top Lebanese government offi
cials and diplomats were the drug suppliers
â€” information confirmed by a number of
books on the international narcotics traffic.
Christians profit
Apparently the Drug Enforcement Ad
ministration suspects top Christian leaders
of profiting from the traffic. In 1974 L\s
agents detained the Christian presidenr.of
Lebanon, Suleiman Franjieh, upon his arri
val in New York, to inspect his luggage for
drugs.
Why would the CIA support drug
trafficking, right-wing extremist forces in
Lebanon? Primarily, it would appear, to
prevent Palestinian forces from obtaining a
secure position in the country from which
to press their demands against Israel. The
major Christian demand, significantly, was
the elimination of PLO autonomy in the re
fugee camps.
The CIA has long supported both Israel
(through now retired counterintelligence
chief James Angleton) and the conservati" j
Arab states (via such agents as Kermit
Roosevelt, who later became Northrop Cor
poration's Middle East arms agent). But it
has always opposed the Palestinian move
ment, which it considers a radical de
stabilizing force in the oil rich region.
If the ClA's hope was to enforce stability
in the Middle East, its policy has failed.
Lebanon is a powder keg whose charge may
trigger a new expolosion between Israel and
its neighbors. Until the Mideast problem is
approached by negotiation, sacrifice and
conciliation, there can be no hope of peace.
"Covert action" will only prolong the
bloodshed.
