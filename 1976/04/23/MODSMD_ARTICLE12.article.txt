Tenure politics
I don't get it. What is all the furor about
the tenure process being political? Of
course it's political. It is the American
Way of Life.
I am surprised that one has not learned
it by now. Ever since I was old enough to
understand the meaning of the word
"no," I have known that the key to success
lies in playing someone else's game and
winning their approval. You've got to
know what to kiss and when.
If you want to use the car this weekend,
you'll wash the damn dishes. If you don't
want your phone bugged and your mail
monitored, you'll refrain from going to
that political rally or speaking out against
the status quo. You'll be nice,to Uncle
Herbert if you want to be "remembered"
some day in the future.
Of course you can always try to retain
some sense of individuality, self-respect
and personal integrity — if you're willing
to pay the cost. Some peopled didn't play
the game, like . . . uh . . . Nathan Hale (I
know it is a poor example, but it is the
Bicentennial Year) . . . Sir Thomas More
. . . Jesus Christ . . . Randall Patrick
McMurphy. . .andlookwhatitgotthem.

As one of the individuals supposedly
wronged by the actions of Brad Krevoy
and Steve Heftei at the 12th Congres
sional District Brown for President
caucus April 11th, I feel obliged to reply
to Kyra Subbotin and Kathryn Ma's col
umn of April 16th.
In their letter, they alleged that Krevoy
and Hefter had "by-passed . . . the origi
nal objective of Staniford representation"
by circulating campaign flyers which ad
vocated the election of only themselves.
This action in no way violated the agree
ment that Krevoy and Hefter had formed
with myself, Subbotin and the four other
members of the so-called Stanford slate.
What was formed at the original meet
ing was not a slate, but rather a voting
coalition.
Each delegate pledged that he would
bring as many voters as he could to the
caucus and every voter from Stanford was
asked to vote for all members of the coali
tion. As it was obvious that we would not
have enough votes among Stanford stu
dents, it was left to the individual dele
gates to raise votes from other voters at the
caucus. Each delegate's willingness to
work largely determined his chance of
success.
I did not pass out any leaflets at the

caucus, but this was largely an effect of a
lack of planning. 1 feel that rather than
condemning Krevoy and Hefter, they
should be commended for their extra ef
forts to ensure Stanford representation at
the national convention this summer. It
is extremely unfortunate that Subbotin
did not understand the nature of the ag
reement that we formed and felt forced to
withdraw, thereby damaging the chances
of all the other Stanford candidates.

Ezra Pound
It would seem that Prof. Robert Cohn
holds it a point of honor to hold — and,
moreover, to share — an opinion about
everything, which is, I suppose, harmless
enough. But I cannot but think that ho is
hoist with his own petard in his latest
diatribe against Dana Gioia's review of a
new biography of Ezra Pound in the Daily
April 19.
In the first place, Gioia's article was not
a defense of Pound the man or of Pound's
politics, which were, after all, repulsive;
rather, the subject at hand was Pound the
poet. Gioia is surely not to be faulted for
what he did not set out to cover. Seen in
this light, Cohn's accusation that "Gioia

misses the whole tone of the Pound affair
by a wide margin" is a crashing irony.
Further, I am offended by Cohn's
puerile logical progression: "Quite aside
from the war-horrors, Pound is, in the
opinion of various good critics, e.g., Mal
com Cowley, a rather mediocre poet." Hiv
anti-Semitism notwithstanding, the jux
taposition of Pound with war-horrors in a
guilt-by-association maneuver is unjusti
fiable, if not irresponsible.
Nor do I find the unfavorable opinion
of one lonely critic, seconded by Cohn
himself, overwhelmingly convincing
proof that Pound was a mediocre poet
Andl would think,consideringthepraise
given T.S. Eliot, Cohn would accord some
weight to Eliot's own judgment of Pound
as a poet given in the dedication to The
Wasteland. "For Ezra Pound, il miglior
fahbro." For in addition to being, as Cohn
so rightly points out, "the greatest poet a f
his time," Eliot was also one of th\
greatest critics.
While I admire Cohn's industry (and
envy his leisure) in writing letters to the
editor so assiduously, I am compelled to
think that, in this case, he fell to grinding
his own ax at the expense of what was, in
fact, quite an intelligent review.

As one of the individuals supposedly
wronged by the actions of Brad Krevoy
and Steve Heftei at the 12th Congres
sional District Brown for President
caucus April 11th, I feel obliged to reply
to Kyra Subbotin and Kathryn Ma's col
umn of April 16th.
In their letter, they alleged that Krevoy
and Hefter had "by-passed . . . the origi
nal objective of Staniford representation"
by circulating campaign flyers which ad
vocated the election of only themselves.
This action in no way violated the agree
ment that Krevoy and Hefter had formed
with myself, Subbotin and the four other
members of the so-called Stanford slate.
What was formed at the original meet
ing was not a slate, but rather a voting
coalition.
Each delegate pledged that he would
bring as many voters as he could to the
caucus and every voter from Stanford was
asked to vote for all members of the coali
tion. As it was obvious that we would not
have enough votes among Stanford stu
dents, it was left to the individual dele
gates to raise votes from other voters at the
caucus. Each delegate's willingness to
work largely determined his chance of
success.
I did not pass out any leaflets at the

caucus, but this was largely an effect of a
lack of planning. 1 feel that rather than
condemning Krevoy and Hefter, they
should be commended for their extra ef
forts to ensure Stanford representation at
the national convention this summer. It
is extremely unfortunate that Subbotin
did not understand the nature of the ag
reement that we formed and felt forced to
withdraw, thereby damaging the chances
of all the other Stanford candidates.

Ezra Pound
It would seem that Prof. Robert Cohn
holds it a point of honor to hold — and,
moreover, to share — an opinion about
everything, which is, I suppose, harmless
enough. But I cannot but think that ho is
hoist with his own petard in his latest
diatribe against Dana Gioia's review of a
new biography of Ezra Pound in the Daily
April 19.
In the first place, Gioia's article was not
a defense of Pound the man or of Pound's
politics, which were, after all, repulsive;
rather, the subject at hand was Pound the
poet. Gioia is surely not to be faulted for
what he did not set out to cover. Seen in
this light, Cohn's accusation that "Gioia

misses the whole tone of the Pound affair
by a wide margin" is a crashing irony.
Further, I am offended by Cohn's
puerile logical progression: "Quite aside
from the war-horrors, Pound is, in the
opinion of various good critics, e.g., Mal
com Cowley, a rather mediocre poet." Hiv
anti-Semitism notwithstanding, the jux
taposition of Pound with war-horrors in a
guilt-by-association maneuver is unjusti
fiable, if not irresponsible.
Nor do I find the unfavorable opinion
of one lonely critic, seconded by Cohn
himself, overwhelmingly convincing
proof that Pound was a mediocre poet
Andl would think,consideringthepraise
given T.S. Eliot, Cohn would accord some
weight to Eliot's own judgment of Pound
as a poet given in the dedication to The
Wasteland. "For Ezra Pound, il miglior
fahbro." For in addition to being, as Cohn
so rightly points out, "the greatest poet a f
his time," Eliot was also one of th\
greatest critics.
While I admire Cohn's industry (and
envy his leisure) in writing letters to the
editor so assiduously, I am compelled to
think that, in this case, he fell to grinding
his own ax at the expense of what was, in
fact, quite an intelligent review.

Tenure politics
I don't get it. What is all the furor about
the tenure process being political? Of
course it's political. It is the American
Way of Life.
I am surprised that one has not learned
it by now. Ever since I was old enough to
understand the meaning of the word
"no," I have known that the key to success
lies in playing someone else's game and
winning their approval. You've got to
know what to kiss and when.
If you want to use the car this weekend,
you'll wash the damn dishes. If you don't
want your phone bugged and your mail
monitored, you'll refrain from going to
that political rally or speaking out against
the status quo. You'll be nice,to Uncle
Herbert if you want to be "remembered"
some day in the future.
Of course you can always try to retain
some sense of individuality, self-respect
and personal integrity — if you're willing
to pay the cost. Some peopled didn't play
the game, like . . . uh . . . Nathan Hale (I
know it is a poor example, but it is the
Bicentennial Year) . . . Sir Thomas More
. . . Jesus Christ . . . Randall Patrick
McMurphy. . .andlookwhatitgotthem.

condemning Krevoy and Hefter, they
should be commended for their extra ef
forts to ensure Stanford representation at
the national convention this summer. It
is extremely unfortunate that Subbotin
did not understand the nature of the ag
reement that we formed and felt forced to
withdraw, thereby damaging the chances
of all the other Stanford candidates.

Ezra Pound
It would seem that Prof. Robert Cohn
holds it a point of honor to hold — and,
moreover, to share — an opinion about
everything, which is, I suppose, harmless
enough. But I cannot but think that ho is
hoist with his own petard in his latest
diatribe against Dana Gioia's review of a
new biography of Ezra Pound in the Daily
April 19.
In the first place, Gioia's article was not
a defense of Pound the man or of Pound's
politics, which were, after all, repulsive;
rather, the subject at hand was Pound the
poet. Gioia is surely not to be faulted for
what he did not set out to cover. Seen in
this light, Cohn's accusation that "Gioia

misses the whole tone of the Pound affair
by a wide margin" is a crashing irony.
Further, I am offended by Cohn's
puerile logical progression: "Quite aside
from the war-horrors, Pound is, in the
opinion of various good critics, e.g., Mal
com Cowley, a rather mediocre poet." Hiv
anti-Semitism notwithstanding, the jux
taposition of Pound with war-horrors in a
guilt-by-association maneuver is unjusti
fiable, if not irresponsible.
Nor do I find the unfavorable opinion
of one lonely critic, seconded by Cohn
himself, overwhelmingly convincing
proof that Pound was a mediocre poet
Andl would think,consideringthepraise
given T.S. Eliot, Cohn would accord some
weight to Eliot's own judgment of Pound
as a poet given in the dedication to The
Wasteland. "For Ezra Pound, il miglior
fahbro." For in addition to being, as Cohn
so rightly points out, "the greatest poet a f
his time," Eliot was also one of th\
greatest critics.
While I admire Cohn's industry (and
envy his leisure) in writing letters to the
editor so assiduously, I am compelled to
think that, in this case, he fell to grinding
his own ax at the expense of what was, in
fact, quite an intelligent review.

Tenure politics
I don't get it. What is all the furor about
the tenure process being political? Of
course it's political. It is the American
Way of Life.
I am surprised that one has not learned
it by now. Ever since I was old enough to
understand the meaning of the word
"no," I have known that the key to success
lies in playing someone else's game and
winning their approval. You've got to
know what to kiss and when.
If you want to use the car this weekend,
you'll wash the damn dishes. If you don't
want your phone bugged and your mail
monitored, you'll refrain from going to
that political rally or speaking out against
the status quo. You'll be nice,to Uncle
Herbert if you want to be "remembered"
some day in the future.
Of course you can always try to retain
some sense of individuality, self-respect
and personal integrity — if you're willing
to pay the cost. Some peopled didn't play
the game, like . . . uh . . . Nathan Hale (I
know it is a poor example, but it is the
Bicentennial Year) . . . Sir Thomas More
. . . Jesus Christ . . . Randall Patrick
McMurphy. . .andlookwhatitgotthem.

No misconduct
As one of the individuals supposedly
wronged by the actions of Brad Krevoy
and Steve Heftei at the 12th Congres
sional District Brown for President
caucus April 11th, I feel obliged to reply
to Kyra Subbotin and Kathryn Ma's col
umn of April 16th.
In their letter, they alleged that Krevoy
and Hefter had "by-passed . . . the origi
nal objective of Staniford representation"
by circulating campaign flyers which ad
vocated the election of only themselves.
This action in no way violated the agree
ment that Krevoy and Hefter had formed
with myself, Subbotin and the four other
members of the so-called Stanford slate.
What was formed at the original meet
ing was not a slate, but rather a voting
coalition.
Each delegate pledged that he would
bring as many voters as he could to the
caucus and every voter from Stanford was
asked to vote for all members of the coali
tion. As it was obvious that we would not
have enough votes among Stanford stu
dents, it was left to the individual dele
gates to raise votes from other voters at the
caucus. Each delegate's willingness to
work largely determined his chance of
success.
I did not pass out any leaflets at the

caucus, but this was largely an effect of a
lack of planning. 1 feel that rather than
condemning Krevoy and Hefter, they
should be commended for their extra ef
forts to ensure Stanford representation at
the national convention this summer. It
is extremely unfortunate that Subbotin
did not understand the nature of the ag
reement that we formed and felt forced to
withdraw, thereby damaging the chances
of all the other Stanford candidates.
