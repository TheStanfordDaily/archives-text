# Small claims courts gain popularity
## 
### Associated Press 
An increasing number of Americans
who can't get satisfaction despite the
growth in complaint agencies are taking
their grievances to courts and arbitration
boards.
The most popular legal step is to fight
in small claims court, with alternatives
including class action lawsuits and arbit
ration boards set up by the Better Busi
ness Bureaus.
The atmosphere in small claims court is
much more informal than in regular
court. You usually don't need a lawyer;
some states even ban attorneys.
Small claims courts are designed for
those cases where it simply wouldn't pay
to get a lawyer and invest a lot of time; the
costs would be more than the damages
involved.
Rules
Rules for small claims courts vary from
state to state. The filing fee is relatively
small — generally between $10 and $50
— and the amount of damages you can
recover runs from a couple hundred to a
icouple thousand dollars.
"It is a poor man's court," said County
Court Judge Thomas O'Connell of Dade
County, Fla.
O'Connell's duties include hearing
small claims or summary procedure cases
as they are called in Florida. John Nelson,

clerk of the civil division of the court —
the part in which O'Connell works — re
ported 24,329 small claims cases were
filed in 1975, compared to 20,904 in 1974
and 18,163 in 1973.
Why the increase? No one is sure. Nel
son said a 1973 change in the law trans
ferring some cases to small claims court
that previously had been heard elsewhere
might be part of the reason, although that
would not account for the increase from
1974 to 1975. "Or," he said, "it might be
the economy."
Recession theory
The theory that people are more likely
to go to court in hard times is supported
by figures for the first part of this year
when the recession had eased. Nelson
said 3443 small claims cases were heard
in January and February this year, com
pared to 3638 in the same period of 1975.
If you need legal advice during the
case, you probably can get it from the
court itself.
O'Connell heard nine cases in a recent
morning. They ranged from an argument
over a broken windshield to a case involv
ing a used car loan.
The annual interest rate on the loan,
clearly stated in the contract, was 27.1
percent. "Usurious," O'Connell said.
"They didn't get a chance to open their
mouth because they didn't have to. All I

had to do was look at the contract."
Small claims courts, of course, serve
businesses as well as consumers. Land
lords take tenants to small claims court.
Finance companies try to collect on debts.
In Dade County, O'Connell said, most of
the cases involve companies suing indi
viduals.
An individual with an unsettled dis
pute that he or she doesn't want to take to
court can use the Better Business
Bureau's system of arbitration established
with three pilot projects in 1971 and now
i ncludi ng about 100 arbitration programs
in major metropolitan areas. Almost
15,000 businesses have agreed to partici
pate.
The service is free. Consumer and busi
ness agree to accept the result as legal and
binding. The bureau suggests arbitration
if earlier attempts at resolving a dispute
are unsuccessful.
"It's a very simple process," said Jesse
Bogan of the National Council of Better
Business Bureaus in Washington. Both
sides "select a neutral third party from a
pool of volunteers."
It takes a maximum of 45 days from the
time the two parties agree to arbitration
until a decision is reached, Bogan said.
Since 1971, some 2500 cases have gone
to arbitration. About 40 percent of the de
cisions are in favor of the individual; 40

percent in favor of business; and 20 per
cent are mixed, Bogan said.
Complaints vary
Florence Nicholls of the Better Busi
ness Bureau in Rochester, N. Y., said arbit
ration cases range from "a man claiming
he was shortweighted five dozen clams"
to arguments over home construction.
The Rochester bureau has a pool of 77
volunteers — "a marvelous cross-section
of the community"— Nicholls said.
There is one arbiter who speaks Tur
kish; another is a rabbi; still others are
housewives, businessmen and college
professors.
Most calls to the Better Business
Bureau in Rochester — up to 600 a day —
don't wind up in arbitration. Sometimes
they can be settled with a call to the com
pany involved or by mediation.
Other cases simply take a little tact.
Like the one involving a woman who cal
led just after Nicholls arrived at the
bureau. "She wanted me personally to
come and remove a bird's nest from over
the door of a supermarket. 1 explained
that she should call the humane society.
She wanted me to call. I finally gave the
society her number and a couple days la
ter, when I was in the neighborhood, 1
looked and there were no birds flying
around."
