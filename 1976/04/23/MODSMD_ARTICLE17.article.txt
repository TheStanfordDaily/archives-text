# Oswald used defective gun?
## 
### 
BERKELEY (PNS)—Lee
Harvey Oswald's rifle, allegedly
used in the sharpshooting assas
sination of John F. Kennedy, is
so flimsy it was at one time pul
led off the market.
According to a newly declas
sified CIA report filed from Italy
six days after the assassination,
Oswald's gun was part of a
shipment so defective that many
exploded when fired — and all
were temporarily withdrawn
from sale to be checked.
Even those that turned out to
be serviceable, like Oswald's,
were so poor they were initially
wholesaled for only $2.20
apiece, the report adds.
Warren commission
The new information fuels a
long controversy over the War
ren Commission story that Os
wald, called a "rather poor shot"
by the man who evaluated his
U.S. Marine marksmanship re
cords for the commission, could
have hit his moving target twice
in the space of 5.6 seconds.
Oswald's own rifle was found
to be flimsy in 1964 when tested
by U.S. Army "master" riflemen.
The army weapons experts who
set up the tests told the Warren
Commission they "were a little
concerned about breaking the
firing pin,"oneofthem "had dif
ficulty in opening the bolt" and
there was comment that the trig
ger "suddenly required" greater
effort in mid-pull.
All found they "could not
sight the weapon" until the
scope had been adjusted by the
insertion of metal shins.
The Warren Commission also
received interviews in which a
Dallas gun-shop owner called
Oswald's gun "a very cheap
rifle" and a man who owned one
of the rifles volunteered that "it
is so poorly constructed he de
cided it was best not to shoot it
any more for the reason he was
afraid it would explode." The

commission interviewed the lat
ter witness but not ask about his
rifle.
In answer to claims that Os
wald's gun was far too clumsy to
have allowed a mediocre
marksman to hit Kennedy, the
commission ordered U.S. Army
tests of the rifle under allegedly
similar conditions.
Dissimilar conditions
But in fact the conditions were
not similar. The Army used mas
ter riflemen — sharpshooters
qualified for international com
petition. In place of a moving
target, the three masters shot at
stationary targets from a more
favorable position than Os
wald's. And they were given as
much time as they wanted to line
up their first shot.
Still, only one of the three hit
the targets twice in 5.6 seconds.
The other two took from one to
three seconds longer.
In 1967 CBS recreated Os
wald's alleged feat on television,
testing 11 master riflemen on
moving targets under conditions
similar to Oswald's.
The masters, given a chance to
practice, fired a totalof 37 firing
runs. They averaged only 1.2
hits, compared to Oswald's sup
posed two. And they were not
using Oswald's gun, but one of
the same model which fired fas
ter than Oswald's ever had for
any master rifleman.

The CIA report, which has
taken on added significance in
the face of the evidence the War
ren Commission did receive
about the poor quality of Os
wald's supposed weapon, may
never have reached the commis
sion. In any event, it was clearly
ignored — or suppressed — at
some level, for the Warren
Commission did nothing to pur
sue its implications.
Initial report
The initial CIA report stated
unambiguously that the first lot
of 7000 Mannlicher Carcamos
imported to the U.S. in 1960, in
cluding Oswald's gun, "had dis
astrous results. Many of them
burst, with frequently fatal con
sequences, and many didn't fire.
This forced Adam (Consolidated
Industries, Inc., the importing
firm) to withdraw all the rifles
from sale and check them before
putting them back on the mar
ket."
But five months later, when
the FBI submitted its own re
search into Oswald's rifle, its re
port was vague. It said only that
the weapon was part of an origi
nal consignment of 7000 that
"were used and in need of re
pair," and referred to "a legal
proceeding ... to collect pay
ment for the shipment of the
rifles which Adam Consolidated
Indutries, Inc., claims were de
fective."

Oswald's gun was part of a
shipment so defective that many
exploded when fired — and all
were temporarily withdrawn

Warren commission
The new information fuels a
long controversy over the War
ren Commission story that Os
wald, called a "rather poor shot"
by the man who evaluated his
U.S. Marine marksmanship re
cords for the commission, could
have hit his moving target twice
in the space of 5.6 seconds.
Oswald's own rifle was found
to be flimsy in 1964 when tested
by U.S. Army "master" riflemen.
The army weapons experts who
set up the tests told the Warren
Commission they "were a little
concerned about breaking the
firing pin,"oneofthem "had dif
ficulty in opening the bolt" and
there was comment that the trig
ger "suddenly required" greater
effort in mid-pull.
All found they "could not
sight the weapon" until the
scope had been adjusted by the
insertion of metal shins.
The Warren Commission also
received interviews in which a
Dallas gun-shop owner called
Oswald's gun "a very cheap
rifle" and a man who owned one
of the rifles volunteered that "it
is so poorly constructed he de
cided it was best not to shoot it
any more for the reason he was
afraid it would explode." The

commission interviewed the lat
ter witness but not ask about his
rifle.
In answer to claims that Os
wald's gun was far too clumsy to
have allowed a mediocre
marksman to hit Kennedy, the
commission ordered U.S. Army
tests of the rifle under allegedly
similar conditions.
Dissimilar conditions
But in fact the conditions were
not similar. The Army used mas
ter riflemen — sharpshooters
qualified for international com
petition. In place of a moving
target, the three masters shot at
stationary targets from a more
favorable position than Os
wald's. And they were given as
much time as they wanted to line
up their first shot.
Still, only one of the three hit
the targets twice in 5.6 seconds.
The other two took from one to
three seconds longer.
In 1967 CBS recreated Os
wald's alleged feat on television,
testing 11 master riflemen on
moving targets under conditions
similar to Oswald's.
The masters, given a chance to
practice, fired a totalof 37 firing
runs. They averaged only 1.2
hits, compared to Oswald's sup
posed two. And they were not
using Oswald's gun, but one of
the same model which fired fas
ter than Oswald's ever had for
any master rifleman.

The CIA report, which has
taken on added significance in
the face of the evidence the War
ren Commission did receive
about the poor quality of Os
wald's supposed weapon, may
never have reached the commis
sion. In any event, it was clearly
ignored — or suppressed — at
some level, for the Warren
Commission did nothing to pur
sue its implications.
Initial report
The initial CIA report stated
unambiguously that the first lot
of 7000 Mannlicher Carcamos
imported to the U.S. in 1960, in
cluding Oswald's gun, "had dis
astrous results. Many of them
burst, with frequently fatal con
sequences, and many didn't fire.
This forced Adam (Consolidated
Industries, Inc., the importing
firm) to withdraw all the rifles
from sale and check them before
putting them back on the mar
ket."
But five months later, when
the FBI submitted its own re
search into Oswald's rifle, its re
port was vague. It said only that
the weapon was part of an origi
nal consignment of 7000 that
"were used and in need of re
pair," and referred to "a legal
proceeding ... to collect pay
ment for the shipment of the
rifles which Adam Consolidated
Indutries, Inc., claims were de
fective."
