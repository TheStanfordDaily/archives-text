When I was introduced to Professor Mark Munccill several years
ago, he shook hands with his left. Is that his usual manner or was I
particularly honored? -E.S.
"I should make up an awfully filthy explanation for it, but it
wouldn't be true," Mancall sighed.
The truth is that Mancall became an ambidextrous handshaker
after breaking his right elbow in Tours during the summer of 1973.
Left-handed shaking became a necessity for a few months, and is
now a habit.
Since the break has mended (although he still has two pins in the
bone which identify him as a potential hijacker whenever he steps
through airport metal detectors), Mancall said that he uses both
hands. "It depends on which side of me is facing the person I'm
going to shake hands with."

I never thought of myself as being invisible, but standing in front of
the Hoover loan desk one feels like it. The ladies are so hesitant and
reluctant to help anyone. Also, I feel that if the library is supposed
to be open until 5 p.m., it should be open until then. They shoo you
out at 4:45 and won't talk to you after 4:30.1 was in the card catalog
room at 4:50 and the lights were turned off. Is the library open until
5 or not? -E.H.
A librarian at the loan desk, who is also responsible for closing
up, was not especially sympathetic. "Maybe that person's watch
was wrong," she said.
According to her, the library begins warning people 10 minutes
before 5 p.m. so that they have time to collect their books. She said
that the lights were never turned oft before 5. We suggest you
protest to them if it happens again.
*****
Could you list the number of foreign students from each country
enrolled at Stanford? -T.Q.L.
The list is really too long to publish here but is available from
Bechtel International Center. By region, it breaks down this way —
Asia, 472; the Americas, 373; Europe, 305; the Middle East, i94;
Africa, 55; the Pacific Basin, 26. There are also four "stateless"
foreign students, who are refugees without passports.
Strangely enough, the greatest number of foreign students come
from Taiwan, with 119. After that are Canada (94), Hong Kong (92),
Mexico (90), Iran (86) and France (82). And there is but one lone
student from Burma, Bolivia, British West Indies, Guyana,
Paraguay, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, USSR, Iraq, Tunisia,
Cameroon, Mauritius, Sudan, Tanzania and Zaire.

Why isn't the bridge entrance to UGLY used? It requires only one
attendant to check books and bags-D.G.
Yes, but that one attendant would cost the library almost $400 a
week, exclusive of benefits, according to Don Intersimone, build
ing supervisor. The library figures that it isn't worth the slightly
greater convenience (or the added noise).

Bechtel International Center. By region, it breaks down this way —
Asia, 472; the Americas, 373; Europe, 305; the Middle East, i94;
Africa, 55; the Pacific Basin, 26. There are also four "stateless"
foreign students, who are refugees without passports.
Strangely enough, the greatest number of foreign students come
from Taiwan, with 119. After that are Canada (94), Hong Kong (92),
Mexico (90), Iran (86) and France (82). And there is but one lone
student from Burma, Bolivia, British West Indies, Guyana,
Paraguay, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, USSR, Iraq, Tunisia,
Cameroon, Mauritius, Sudan, Tanzania and Zaire.

Why isn't the bridge entrance to UGLY used? It requires only one
attendant to check books and bags-D.G.
Yes, but that one attendant would cost the library almost $400 a
week, exclusive of benefits, according to Don Intersimone, build
ing supervisor. The library figures that it isn't worth the slightly
greater convenience (or the added noise).


When I was introduced to Professor Mark Munccill several years
ago, he shook hands with his left. Is that his usual manner or was I
particularly honored? -E.S.
"I should make up an awfully filthy explanation for it, but it
wouldn't be true," Mancall sighed.
The truth is that Mancall became an ambidextrous handshaker
after breaking his right elbow in Tours during the summer of 1973.
Left-handed shaking became a necessity for a few months, and is
now a habit.
Since the break has mended (although he still has two pins in the
bone which identify him as a potential hijacker whenever he steps
through airport metal detectors), Mancall said that he uses both
hands. "It depends on which side of me is facing the person I'm
going to shake hands with."

I never thought of myself as being invisible, but standing in front of
the Hoover loan desk one feels like it. The ladies are so hesitant and
reluctant to help anyone. Also, I feel that if the library is supposed
to be open until 5 p.m., it should be open until then. They shoo you
out at 4:45 and won't talk to you after 4:30.1 was in the card catalog
room at 4:50 and the lights were turned off. Is the library open until
5 or not? -E.H.
A librarian at the loan desk, who is also responsible for closing
up, was not especially sympathetic. "Maybe that person's watch
was wrong," she said.
According to her, the library begins warning people 10 minutes
before 5 p.m. so that they have time to collect their books. She said
that the lights were never turned oft before 5. We suggest you
protest to them if it happens again.

Could you list the number of foreign students from each country
enrolled at Stanford? -T.Q.L.
The list is really too long to publish here but is available from
Bechtel International Center. By region, it breaks down this way —
