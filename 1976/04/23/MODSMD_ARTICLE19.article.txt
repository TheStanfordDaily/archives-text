# All of California coast endangered by quake
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) — A
200-mile west fork of the San
Andreas fault has been linked
together by scientists who say it
could cause strong earthquakes
along the central California
coast.
The six-week-old discovery
was revealed in connection with
a Senate hearing on a bill to im
plement the California Coastal
Plan.
Kenneth Lajoie of the U.S.
Ceological Survey at Menlo Park
said in a telephone interview
late Wednesday that 10
geologists mapping offshore
faults met in early March at Stan
ford University, compared notes

and agreed that the faults were
connected.
Double jeopardy
The discovery doubles the
length of an offshore fault Merg
ing with the San Andreas hear
San Francisco.
The San Gregorio fault, previ
ously thought to end at Mon
terey Bay, hooks up with the
Hosgri fault, which connects
with the San Simeon fault, said
Lajoie.
"Very definitely," Lajoie said,
"the longer a fault becomes, the
larger the earthquake you can
expect from it.
"It would not be unreasona
ble, from the best data today, to
expect a possible eight" from the
200-mile fault zone on the
open-ended Kichter magnitude
scale.
The 1906 San Francisco ear
thquake registered 8.3. It occur
red on the 650-mile-long San
Andreas fault.
Lajoie said the "west branch"

is "not the same caliber as the
San Andreas. We'll still see the
major quakes along the San An
dreas."
Seismically active
But he said coastal Califor
nians — 85 percent of Califor
nia's2l million persons — arein
an area "more potentially seis
mically active" than scientists
realized.
p]li Silver, head of the Uni
versity of California at Santa
Cruz Department of Geology,
said the fault isn't more than 10
miles offshore at its farthest
point, and the Hosgri fault is
only about two miles off the Di
ablo Canyon site of two nuclear
power plants under construc
tion.
Lajoie said geologists also
have traced the Rose Canyon
fault in San Diego offshore to a
point where it links up with the
Newport (Inglewood) fault that
cuts across the Los Angeles ba
sin.

The San Gregorio fault, previ
ously thought to end at Mon
terey Bay, hooks up with the
Hosgri fault, which connects
with the San Simeon fault, said
Lajoie.
"Very definitely," Lajoie said,
"the longer a fault becomes, the
larger the earthquake you can
expect from it.
"It would not be unreasona
ble, from the best data today, to
expect a possible eight" from the
200-mile fault zone on the
open-ended Kichter magnitude
scale.
The 1906 San Francisco ear
thquake registered 8.3. It occur
red on the 650-mile-long San
Andreas fault.
Lajoie said the "west branch"

is "not the same caliber as the
San Andreas. We'll still see the
major quakes along the San An
dreas."
Seismically active
But he said coastal Califor
nians — 85 percent of Califor
nia's2l million persons — arein
an area "more potentially seis
mically active" than scientists
realized.
p]li Silver, head of the Uni
versity of California at Santa
Cruz Department of Geology,
said the fault isn't more than 10
miles offshore at its farthest
point, and the Hosgri fault is
only about two miles off the Di
ablo Canyon site of two nuclear
power plants under construc
tion.
Lajoie said geologists also
have traced the Rose Canyon
fault in San Diego offshore to a
point where it links up with the
Newport (Inglewood) fault that
cuts across the Los Angeles ba
sin.
