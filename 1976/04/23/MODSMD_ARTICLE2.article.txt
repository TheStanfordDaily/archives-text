# Hoover fellow Moore criticizes transportation regulatory groups

"The average guy on the street
thinks that the CAB (Civil Aeronautics
Board) and ICC (Interstate Commerce
Commission) are there to protect him.
that's what they say in high school
civics books. That guy is uninformed."
In an address entitled "Transporta
tion Regulations â€” theCainersand the
Losers" delivered to the Young Liber
tarian Alliance last Wednesday night,
Thomas Moore of the Hoover Institute
observed that regulation of the trans
portation industry is another example
of how "government ruins everything
it touches.
"Transportation regulations are typ
ical of what goes on in the economy,"
Moore observed. "The chief be
neficiaries are the big industries and
w ibor unions. The losers are you and
ine, the consumers."
Moore, a senior research fellow,
served for two years on the Council of
Economic Advisers. He is an "acknow
ledged libertarian," according to June
Cenis, an activist in the libertarian
movement here, and has been study
rtg the history of transportation regu
lations as well as current issues in this
field for several years.
He briefly outlined the conflict be
tween pro-regulationists and de
regulationists from its inception with
the establishment of the ICC in 1887.
Magnates supported ICC
"The railroads supported the estab
lishment of the ICC," noted Moore,
explaining that the early magnates
wanted federal regulation which they
could use to reduce price competition

and protect cartel agreements.
Moore contended that federal reg
ulatory agencies, such as the ICC, ac
tually did help large industries
stabilize their prices at high cost to the
consumer and that they continue to do
so today.
He used the ICC regulation of the
trucking industry as an example of the
ineffectiveness of 20th century
federal intervention. The trucking in
dustry, he claimed, uses the ICC to in
sure a relatively low level of price
competition.
"The industry tells us if we didn't
have regulation, prices would be
higher," said Moore, labeling this
contention to be "180 degrees in the
wrong direction." He cited a case in
which prices charged by an unregu
lated trucking firm were compared
with those of a much larger, regulated
company.
"The unregulated prices were 45
percent lower." stated Moore, adding
that "service quality was measured in
seven categories ... in all seven of
those, the unregulated came out ahead
of the regulated firm.
Poor quality
"In ICC trucking," he asserted, "the
quality and the price are not good."
He described what he called the
"sheer waste" of obligatory trucking
certificates which send ICC-regulated
trucks to their destination by circuit
ous routes, or from city to city com
pletely empty. Such practices, Moore
claimed, keep consumer prices high
while profits go into union members'
pockets.

"If you look at the wages paid to
ICC-regulated truckers in 1972, the av
erage Class One trucker got $12,295.
Driving the same type of carrier, the
unregulated trucker received $8500. A
little over $12 billion extra going to
labor in the trucking industry is due to
ICC regulation," Moore said.
He also noted that a similar situation
exists in the airline industry, which is
regulated by the CAB.
S.F. to N.Y. for $100
"For example," Moore said, "World
Airways petitioned to fly from San
Francisco to New York charging only
$100 per customer. The CAB never
even held a hearing." This, he con
tends, is just one of many instances in
which the federal agency stamped out
a potential source of competition.
"Who loses?" queried Moore. "The
consuming public, as usual. Rates
would be 32-47 percent lower in the
absence of CAB regulation. Passengers
would have saved $3.9 to 4 billion."
