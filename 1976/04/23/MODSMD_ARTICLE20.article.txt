# Alpha Delts begin pizza service

We all know how despicable
the munchies are. They attack
mercilessly, without warning,
strafing your stomach, making it
feel like it's collapsing in on it
self. You need u pizza. Round
Table is substandard. Frankie,
Johnny, and Luigi's, too is too
far. Besides your roommate has
commandeered your reconnais
sance vehicle.
Your alternative — run for the
phone and dial 327-4454. Or
328-9700. Or 767-3934 (al
though the latter will only get
you the correct time). The first
two numbers will ring in the
kitchen of the Alpha Delta Phi
pizza delivery service.
Conceived by Business School
students Chris Cline and Jay Farr
and senior French major Derek
Bertocci, the Alpha Delta Phi
pizza delivery service is availa
ble anywhere on campus within
15 to 20 minutes after receipt of
the order.
The sequence is simple. When
the order is received, the bakers
go to work on constructing and
baking it specially. Farr takes the
finished product on his motor
cycle, handily equipped with a

140-degree warming oven on the
back, to the appropriate dorm.
Since pizzas can't be delivered
to rooms, Farr calls ahead to
make sure that someone is wait
ing for him in a common room
with the payment (it's about time
he got around to the cost!). The
price is unbeatable, unless you
make it yourself, which isn't as
convenient.

Each pizza is 13 inches. A
cheese pizza is $3, a meat pizza
with one kind of meat, $3.50,
and a pizza with everything
costs $4. Infinite variety is pro
vided by ham. salami, peppe
roni, linguica, olives, onionsand
a blend of cheeses. "The secret,"
Cline says, "is in the sauce and
the cheese. There are three diffe
rent varieties of cheese, and we

put at least a half-pound of
cheese on each pizza."
flours of operation
The hours of this operation are
Thursday through Saturday, 10
p.m. through 1 a.m. "We did an
empirical study," says Cline.
"Most of our orders come after
11." The hours may expand if
business is brisk.
Last week, the first week the
Alpha Delts were in business, 55
pizzas went out, though there
had been little advertising done.
They say that people called
bai:k to say how good it was, and
one fraternity went so far as to
order a second pizza almost as
soon as the first one arrived.
They say they think it is an
ingenious idea, for there is no
pizza parlor close by campus
that can deliver their product
here as fast as they can. Like true
marketing experts, Cline and
Farr have created a way to fill a
present but dormant demand.
Community service
Farr notes that, "any univer
sity town back East has a pizza
delivery, and there it's a real
community service." He also
mentions that the pizza is avail
able for catering study breaks, if
such services are desired.
Pizzas are made from Bertoc
ci's family recipe. He says,"It
comes from Caeta, near Naples.
It's been in the family since the
family was around, and that's a
long time." Bertocci is head
hasher at the Alpha Delts and is
at home in the kitchen. The pizza
proves that; innocent and impar
tial bystander Elke Meier said of
the pizzas, "They're dynamite!"
So now, thanks to the Alpha
Delts, we now have ammunition
to fight the war against the mun
chies. The light at the end of the
tunnel is in sight.

SECRET RECIPE—Derek Bertocci and Chris Cline have begun a
pizza service located at the Alpha Delt fraternity. Bertocci, pic
tured here, pours his special sauce over the dough. The pizza is
from an old family recipe, says Bertocci, and has its origins in
Gaeta, near Naples.
