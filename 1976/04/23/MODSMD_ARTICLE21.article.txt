Economics and Freedom of Expression:
Media Structure and the First Amendment,
by Bruce XI. Owen. Bullinger Publishing,
$15.
Reviewed by George Powell
An economist looking at the structure of
the media in America may seem odd at first,
just because it hasn't been done. Hut it's
time for a fresh perspective on who controls
access to the media, and Bruce Owen, an
assistant economics professor here, has
some novel suggestions on what could be
changed.
Economics and Freedom of Expression is
more of an academic monograph than a
book written with the general public in
mind, but if one ignores all the graphs and
complex formulas that give the necessary
academic rigor to his arguments, the argu
ments themselves are arresting, if not al
ways convincing.
basically, Owen feels that existing public
and private monopolies over the transmis
sion and publishing ends of the media
should be broken. That is, anyone who
could buy air time should have access to a
television or radio transmitter, and anyone
who has a newspaper should have access
(again at a price) to the same printing and
distribution system that a successful daily

newspaper enjoys.
Of the three types of media Owen treats in
his book, magazines come off the best,
newspapers second and the electronic
media — mainly television—the worst in
terms of ease of access.
Looking at the marketplace of ideas in a
strictly dollars and cents fashion, Owen
wants the consumers to be ". . . free to ex
press their preferences with dollars." To
some, this might suggest that only oil com
panies and Arab nations would end up with
television time, but with more channels and
a greater diversity of programming than is
now available, Owen does not feel that a
network monopoly would be replaced with
an advertiser monopoly.
To bring about the necessary changes in
television, Owen advocates the establish
ment of private property rights in the elec
tromagnetic spectrum, abolishing the Fed
eral Communications Commission (FCC)
licensing authority and other rules over
broadcast content, and turning public tele
vision over to commercial operators.
For newspapers, Owen feels that they
should be divested of their printing and de
livery systems and that 110 newspaper
should be permitted to own a a television
station in the same city (like KRON-TV
being owned by the San Francisco Chroni

cle).
Magazines are in fairly good shape, but
Owen would be in favor of continuing lower
second class postage rates, which is an in
direct subsidy to small magazines with li
mited circulation. Such action is helpful to
keep a full range of ideas available to the
consumer, he writes. In any the edito
rial function of a magazine, newspaper or
television program should not be tampered
with by any outside party.
If these ideas seem to deflate a lot of sac
red cows (imagine KQED as a commercial
channel), then Owen's book has made its
main point. The current system of regula
tion is a mess, with legislators, regulators
and network executives falling over each
other in an effort to reduce television con
tent to the lowest common denominator.
The time is ripe for some new thinking and
legislation, which hasn't been done since
the heyday of Babe Ruth and Charles
Lindbergh.
Although it may be so abstruse in places
that it becomes inaccessable to the general
public, Economics and Freedom of Expres
sion serves as a valuable starting point for a
discussion of changing media structure to
reinsure continued maximum freedom of
expression in America.

Advice from academia on gov
ernmental regulation is some
times dismissed as theoretical or
impractical. But when Bruce
Owen publishes a book on media
structure, he knows his subject
matter from two angles.
An assistant professor of
economics here, Owen is a
former chief economist for the
White House Office of Telecom
munications Policy. He has also
been an economic policy fellow at
the Brookings Institute and a na
tional fellow of the Hoover Institu
tion.
"A lot of my ideas came out of
policy frustrations in dealing with
the FCC (Federal Communica
tions Commission), a highly pro
tective agency," said Owen. "I
have a better feeling for what's
possible and probable."
Tad Lipsky, a graduate student
in both law and economics here,
assisted Owen with part of the
book. When asked about the
book's possible impact, Lipsky
said, "He's (Owen) not going to
be the Captain Ahab of broadcast

reform. This issue is to big for any
one person to handle."
"It's intended as an academic
work," said Owen, "not one to be
reviewed by Newsweek." He

hopes the book will be a stimulant
for broadcast reform. "People will
gradually begin to see the scan
dal as it is."
