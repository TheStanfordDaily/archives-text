# Arnaz: his talent isn't in writing
## 
### 
A Book, by Dcsi Arnaz. William Morrow &■ Company, Inc., $8.95.
Reviewed by Howard Baldwin
At various times in his life, Desi Arnaz proved himself a talented
band leader, actor, television show producer and studio executive.
He became an Alger-type success in each field, overcoming the
adversity of being run out of Cuba as a teenager by a revolution.
However successful he was at being the millionaire that came out
of all those business ventures, Arnaz is, unfortunately, not a writer.
His autobiography A Book demonstrates this almost to the point of
embarrassment.
Arnaz is one of those people, though, whose life has been so
diverse that his autobiography sometimes manages to be interest
ing in spite of itself. It is similar to Arthur Marx's Everybody Loves
Somebody Sometimes (Especially Himself), and the story of Dean
Martin and Jerry Lewis, which is also attractive, but like A
Book,dull.
A dry book
Arnaz's dry and suspenseless way of recounting his life is far
from conducive to the forward thrust of the narrative. It hinders its
progression every step of the way, as a matter of fact. But this is
Arnaz, the native Cuban. He did not go to journalism school, so he
should not be expected to write like Carl Sandburg.
Unfortunately, the dullness of the language and narrative is not
the book's only flaw. It also suffers from an abundance of what is
uninteresting and a scarcity of what is most fascinating about
Arnaz's life.
A full 40 pages are devoted to Arnaz's childhood in Cuba before
the Batista revolution drove him and his father to Miami. With
loving care, Arnaz recounts his grandfather's and father's
achievements in the Cuban government, his own first experiences
with the opposite sex. and the paradise in which he lived.
Tidal wave
While I'm sure it was a tidal waveof sweet nostalgia for Arnaz to
recount all that, it is like quicksand for the reader. Arnaz's life is full
of many unique achievements that the time he spends describing
his idyUic childhood seems like a waste.
Similarly, he deals with a garrulous exactness about the forma
tion of Desilu Productions and his function as its president. When
he comes to his divorce from Lucille Ball, he quickly traipses past it
with a fatalistic nod, without going into any real analysis of how
such a successful couple could end up on the rocks.
Surprisingly, the book ends in 1959, right after the celebrated
divorce. And this, to me, represents the main flaw of A Book, for it
is a lost opportunity to discuss a situation rarely considered in
biographies.
Abdication
What does a man do when he abdicates a throne of power and
success? What happened to Arnaz after "I Love Lucy"? What has
his relationship been to Lucille Ball and his children?
I think the last 16 years would be a riveting discussion of a man
on his way down to a simpler life, in contrast to his hectic race for
the top. How did he progress from the dark and swarthy Ricky
Ricardo to the silver-haired man he is today? How a man of Arnaz's
stature in the entertainment business world accepts semi-retirement
would be a fascinating study.
In this world of constant sequels, there is an answer. A postscript
on the dust jacket says. "P.S. Ilyou Ii ke A Book. I promise to see you
again in Another Book —D A."

recount all that, it is like quicksand for the reader. Arnaz's life is full
of many unique achievements that the time he spends describing
his idyUic childhood seems like a waste.
Similarly, he deals with a garrulous exactness about the forma
tion of Desilu Productions and his function as its president. When
he comes to his divorce from Lucille Ball, he quickly traipses past it
with a fatalistic nod, without going into any real analysis of how
such a successful couple could end up on the rocks.
Surprisingly, the book ends in 1959, right after the celebrated
divorce. And this, to me, represents the main flaw of A Book, for it
is a lost opportunity to discuss a situation rarely considered in
biographies.
Abdication
What does a man do when he abdicates a throne of power and
success? What happened to Arnaz after "I Love Lucy"? What has
his relationship been to Lucille Ball and his children?
I think the last 16 years would be a riveting discussion of a man
on his way down to a simpler life, in contrast to his hectic race for
the top. How did he progress from the dark and swarthy Ricky
Ricardo to the silver-haired man he is today? How a man of Arnaz's
stature in the entertainment business world accepts semi-retirement
would be a fascinating study.
In this world of constant sequels, there is an answer. A postscript
on the dust jacket says. "P.S. Ilyou Ii ke A Book. I promise to see you
again in Another Book —D A."

Desi Arnaz
A Book, by Dcsi Arnaz. William Morrow &■ Company, Inc., $8.95.
Reviewed by Howard Baldwin
At various times in his life, Desi Arnaz proved himself a talented
band leader, actor, television show producer and studio executive.
He became an Alger-type success in each field, overcoming the
adversity of being run out of Cuba as a teenager by a revolution.
However successful he was at being the millionaire that came out
of all those business ventures, Arnaz is, unfortunately, not a writer.
His autobiography A Book demonstrates this almost to the point of
embarrassment.
Arnaz is one of those people, though, whose life has been so
diverse that his autobiography sometimes manages to be interest
ing in spite of itself. It is similar to Arthur Marx's Everybody Loves
Somebody Sometimes (Especially Himself), and the story of Dean
Martin and Jerry Lewis, which is also attractive, but like A
Book,dull.
A dry book
Arnaz's dry and suspenseless way of recounting his life is far
from conducive to the forward thrust of the narrative. It hinders its
progression every step of the way, as a matter of fact. But this is
Arnaz, the native Cuban. He did not go to journalism school, so he
should not be expected to write like Carl Sandburg.
Unfortunately, the dullness of the language and narrative is not
the book's only flaw. It also suffers from an abundance of what is
uninteresting and a scarcity of what is most fascinating about
Arnaz's life.
A full 40 pages are devoted to Arnaz's childhood in Cuba before
the Batista revolution drove him and his father to Miami. With
loving care, Arnaz recounts his grandfather's and father's
achievements in the Cuban government, his own first experiences
with the opposite sex. and the paradise in which he lived.
Tidal wave
While I'm sure it was a tidal waveof sweet nostalgia for Arnaz to
recount all that, it is like quicksand for the reader. Arnaz's life is full
