# 'S/HE's' second issue shows superficial analysis
## 
### 
Reviewed by Richard Cross
The second issue of S/HE, the
new student-initiated publica
tion sponsored by the Center for
Research on Women (CROW),
has less discernment and energy
than the first issue gave promise
of. Much of the writing in this
month's issue is too self-assured;
there is a general failure (with
one bright exception) to go be
yond a purely superficial level of
analysis.
The cover story, a summariza
tion of Dr. Bernice Sandler's re
cent lecture at the Center for Re
search on Women, is a journalis

tic catastrophe, being a labyrinth
of conceptual non-sequiturs that
result in a very strong picture of
the woman who has been called
the "Mother of Affirmative Ac
tion."
The truth of the matter is that
the author Andrew Leuchter
may be protecting Sandler, that
is, if her talk has been accurately
translated from lectern to news
page — for most of the inconsis
tencies in Leuchter's summary
of her talk are contained within
quotation marks. It is possible
that Leuchter chose to ignore the
various instances of faulty
reasoning and ill-founded op
timism. Unfortunately, his
summary of Sandler's talk does
not give enough clues to let us
know whether one or both of
them are confused about where
the battle lines of feminism re
ally are and where they should
be.
Excellent summary
Laura Goverson, on the other
hand, has written an excellent
summary of her investigation of
the "critical shortage" of obstet
ricians and gynecologists in
Santa Clara County who will ac
cept women on Medi-Cal as pa
tients.
Coverson points out that be
cause the chances of Medi-Cal
remuneration are much higher
for abortion and sterilization pa
tients than for pregnancy pa -
tients. there is a widespread ten
dency among doctors to accept
the former and refuse the latter.
As the author perceptively notes,
the result is a "subtle coercive
fertility control practiced on
welfare women."
Coverson rightly insists that
"fertility control must be an in
formed choice, not a coerced re
sponse to a welfare system . . .
which on one hand has built-in

incentives for large families and
on the other has medical remun
eration practices which favor
small families. .
Distorted picture
Mary Ingersoll's review of Let
ters Home by Sylvia Plath by
Aurelia Schober Plath, the
poetess' mother, fails to weigh
an extremely important feature
of this new book. Ingersoll al
lows that Aurelia Plath's editor
ship probably gives a distorted
picture of her daughter's per
sonality. However, she fails to
make anything of the fact that a
collection of letters selected and
edited by the poetess' mother
can hardly be regarded as objec
tive and impartial. Rather, such a
book must be regarded as a biog
raphy — and a crucial one, too.
Too much is at stake to allow any
other conclusion.
What the reader finds is not
the poetess suspended in an
ideal historical dimension but
the mother's version of how Syl
via Plath wanted to be known to
her mother in her letters. With
out this recognition, the facts of
Sylvia Plath's life are implausi
ble and unrevealing when view
ed from the context of this
book; with it. the book affords
the reader a new perspective on
Sylvia Plath's life and work.
Other features in this month's
SINE include an extremely pro
vincial and unimaginatve re
view of Lina Wertmuller's Seven
Hnauties, a comparison of
supermarket price differences
and a report on two new wo
men's resource centers. There
are also some poems and a short
story.
S/HE will need shrewder and
more energetic examinations of
women's problems and the wo
men's movement if it is going to
be a source of intelligent change.
