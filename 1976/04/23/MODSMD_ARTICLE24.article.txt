Of all the major European
poets of this century Consta nti ne
Cavafy, a Greek who lived in
Alexandria, wrote the most ac
cessible body of work.
Cavafy was almost completely
unknown in his own lifetime. He
never published any of his
poems in book form. Instead he
circulated a few slender,
privately printed pamphlets
among his friends.
Nor did he always keep track
of his carefully worked poems
once he published them in far
flung Creek periodicals. Only
with much difficulty were all his
poems collected after his death
by his admirers. This single vol
ume has earned him the position
as one of the greatest poets of
modern period in any language.
Early reputation
Cavafy's early reputation grew
as quickly in the English
speaking world as it did in
Greece. T.S. Eliot, E.M. Forster,
W.H. Auden and several other
British writers published and

praised Cavafy when the poet
was still relatively unknown in
his native country.
In fact at the time of his death
this modest poet, who spoke
Greek with a British accent, was
probably better known in Lon
don than in Athens.
The Greeks were not slow to
reverse this situation. Once
Cavafy's work was collected and
published he became recognized
as the founder of modern Greek
poetry. His work became the
models for many young poets
and despite the unabashedly
erotic preoccupation of most of
his poetry it even became part of
the standard curriculum for
Greek school children.
Three themes
Almost all of Cavafy's poems
fall into three categories. First
there are the brief glimpses of
love amid the squalor of a huge
city. Second, there are the recre
ations of some episode — public
or private — in Greek history
which reflect Cavafy's enormous
interest in this subject. Third,
there are those few absolutely
stunning poems in which Cavafy
takes some famous historical or
mythic situation and univer
salizes it to explain some area of
human experience.
Cavafy's love poems are his
most numerous productions.
They are rarely written to any
one. Instead they are third per
son descriptions of some rela
tionship full of realistic details.
Cavafy was unabashedly
homosexual and his poetry re
flects this predilection. Yet his
love poetry is both immediate
and universal to a degree few
poets of any time or place have
ever been.
In his love poetry Cavafy
writes like a novelist in verse.
The poems are full of devastat
ingly honest observations!hat do
much to explain how two peo
ple—of whatever sex— act in a
sexual relationship.
Theme of lust
L-ust is as important a theme
as love in Cavafy's poetry. And
he has certainly written some of
his most profound poetry on
how physical desire can draw
two people together for good or
bad consequences.
The love poems also capture
Cavafy's characteristic scenes,
the sprawling, decadent city of
Alexandria. No small part of the
pleasure of reading Cavafy
comes from t he hypnotic portrait
he paints of his hybrid city. What
Joyce did for Dublin. Cavafy did
for his native city of Alexandria.
At the beginning of the cen
tury it was a truly cosmopolitan
city populated by dozens of
races and nationalities. In many
ways for its considerable
homosexual subculture Alexan
dria was not unlike contempor
ary San Francisco. It was a city
full of polyglot cafes, seedy
tavernas, male bordellos and di
lapidated but discrete hotels in
which all levels of society
mixed, unhindered by law or
public disapproval.
Autoernticism
A recent biography has proven
to the great surprise of no one
who knows his work, that Cavafy
was obsessively autoerotic. His
poems are full of sexual fan
tasies, not in the pornographic
sense, but as reveries on old lov
ers or young men of whom he
has got a tempting glimpse.
The beginning of the poem

"Gray" is typical of Cavafy:
While lookingat a half-gray opal
I remembered (wo lovely gray
eyes;
it must be twenty yearsago I saw
them. . .
Such poems might easily be
come annoying. But Cavafy con
trols and condenses these
moody recollections so well that
they are almost always very
powerful poems.
Perhaps Cavafy's greatest
achievement was his ability to
reshape so much of Greek his
tory into poetry. His meditations
on history like his meditations of
love allow him to transcend the
seedy realities of modern
Alexandria and discuss subject
matter of more universal impor
tance.
Cavafy's poetry captures brief
and fascinating episodes from
almost every period of Greece's
decline from the Golden Age of
Athens to its present comforta
ble anonymity.
Triumph and decline
Cavafy's brilliant poems about
the triumph and decline of Greek
civilization around the Mediter
ranean have success as indi
vidual works of art, but com
bined they have an almost epic
significance. Together they pro
vide a cinematic journey
through the history of a people.
It is significant that a poet has
undertaken the task of recreating
Greek history for his people. The
Greek people who have been
scattered around the Mediterra
nean and beyond have no politi
cal unity. Only the Greek lan
guage itself still unifies this
widely scattered race, and
Cavafy renewed the modern
Greek language in a body of
poetry which has conveyed the
tragic history of his people.
Cavafy writes superbly about
love and history, but his greatest
poems are his new versions of
myths. These poems were pre
sumably written to specific in
dividuals at crucial points in
their lives, but once again
Cavafy's genius transcended the
particular occasion. "Ithaka"is
such a poem:
As you set out for Ithaka
hope your road is a long one
full of adventure, full of discov
ery. . .
There are two modern Greek
languages. One is a formal, liter
ary language fairly close to clas
sical Greek. The second is the
spoken language of the people.
Cavafy combines the two levels
of language in his poetry — a fact
which makes the exact character
impossible to translate exactly.
But despite this problem, Ed
mund Keeley and Philip Sher
rard have done an exemplary
job. Their translations are al
ways lucid and graceful.
Quite often they are very good
English poems in their own
right. The hardbound edition
provides a facing Greek text for
the lucky few who can make out
Cavafy in the original. Both edi
tions have extensive notes that
prove quite helpful to the reader.
Princeton's edition of Cavafy's
Collected Pi»ems is a nearly per
fect volume. The only shortcom
ing is very slight. One could
have wished that their brief
biographical section had been
expanded. But perhaps Cavafy is
best represented by the poems
themselves. Few modern Euro
pean poets have fared so well in
English.
