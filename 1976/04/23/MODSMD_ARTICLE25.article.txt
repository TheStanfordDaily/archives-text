## Trackman battles against illness, 'specialization' 
### Daryl Thomas 
Amid the surroundings of a
well-lived-in trailer, Al
Sheats sits battling stomach
trouble. The Stanford
trackman looks at the books
and paraphenalia lying
around and recalls how he
started track.
Sheats says until he left Al
tadena, his hometown, to
come here, track was more
"something to do on Thurs
days than an all
encompassing thing."
In high school, Sheats re
called he chose to run track
partly because he wasn't"big
enough to play football nor
tall enough to play basket
ball," and partly because his
brother was a sprinter.
Sheats began his Stanford
career last year running the
440 and the relays. Although
not spectacular, he had a
good first year, according to
teammates. This year, he's
one of top point getters on the

team.
Sheats said he learned to
run with intelligence. He
noted, "The right strategy
and tactics can beat sheer
speed, so homework should
be done studying opponents
and their weaknesses."
This season, recurring ill
ness has kept Sheats from
training for the44o so he has
joined Marvin Holmes in the
short sprints.
The other thing Sheats says
he has learned from running
at Stanford is to work. He
claims his high school team
had a "laissez faire" attitude
and never worked hard.
Sheats' friends say he
doesn't think much about
track during the offseason.
"I like photography and try
to work with it as much as
possible," Sheats says. "In
high school. I worked on my
yearbook and all, but here
specialization is ruining
things."

"I took one photo class,"he
recalls, "but decided not to
compete with the crowds to
get into another. I may later."
A sophomore, Sheats has
yet to declare a major. The
only goals he has set concern
the track team. He would like
to go to the NCAA Champion
ships and would like to help
break the Stanford mile relay
record.
Sheats also says,"I wish we
had more fans. No one likes to
get beat in front of a crowd. If
we could get as many people
in the stadium as the football
team, boy, we'd really fly."
"Track can teach you about
people," Sheats concludes.
"When you're up, everybody
is for you and behind you,but
when you're down, they're all
on your back."

things."

"I took one photo class,"he
recalls, "but decided not to
compete with the crowds to
get into another. I may later."
A sophomore, Sheats has
yet to declare a major. The
only goals he has set concern
the track team. He would like
to go to the NCAA Champion
ships and would like to help
break the Stanford mile relay
record.
Sheats also says,"I wish we
had more fans. No one likes to
get beat in front of a crowd. If
we could get as many people
in the stadium as the football
team, boy, we'd really fly."
"Track can teach you about
people," Sheats concludes.
"When you're up, everybody
is for you and behind you,but
when you're down, they're all
on your back."
Amid the surroundings of a
well-lived-in trailer, Al
Sheats sits battling stomach
trouble. The Stanford
trackman looks at the books
and paraphenalia lying
around and recalls how he
started track.
Sheats says until he left Al
tadena, his hometown, to
come here, track was more
"something to do on Thurs
days than an all
encompassing thing."
In high school, Sheats re
called he chose to run track
partly because he wasn't"big
enough to play football nor
tall enough to play basket
ball," and partly because his
brother was a sprinter.
Sheats began his Stanford
career last year running the
440 and the relays. Although
not spectacular, he had a
good first year, according to
teammates. This year, he's
one of top point getters on the

team.
Sheats said he learned to
run with intelligence. He
noted, "The right strategy
and tactics can beat sheer
speed, so homework should
be done studying opponents
and their weaknesses."
This season, recurring ill
ness has kept Sheats from
training for the44o so he has
joined Marvin Holmes in the
short sprints.
The other thing Sheats says
he has learned from running
at Stanford is to work. He
claims his high school team
had a "laissez faire" attitude
and never worked hard.
Sheats' friends say he
doesn't think much about
track during the offseason.
"I like photography and try
to work with it as much as
possible," Sheats says. "In
high school. I worked on my
yearbook and all, but here
specialization is ruining
things."
