## Wrestling to be phased out 
### George Anders 
The intercollegiate wrestling
program here will terminate at
the end of the 1976-77 season
and a women's gymnastics team
will start in 1977-78, Athletic Di
rector Joe Ruetz announced yes
terday morning.
Ruetz also announced that
next fall men's and women's vol
leyball would be raised from
varsity club to varsity status.
Ending wrestling will cut
costs, Ruetz said, and also enable
the department to offer women's
intercollegiate gymnastics, a
sport he said he feels has more
student support.
"There's a broad interest on
the student body level for wo
men's gymnastics," Ruetz said.
"We've got 150 or 160 in the
women's PE classes."
He said that for wrestling,
though, "there's little student
participation," except on the

team level.
Wrestling coach Joe DeMeo
said, however, "I don't really
think the reasons he gave were
the real ones," and speculated
that Ruetz was "a little bit pre
judiced against minor sports."
Wrestling, previously a var
sity sport, will be a varsity club
sport next year and receive "very
little" funding, Ruetz said.
Ruetz added he had consi
dered eliminating wrestling
immediately, but changed his
mind after discussions with
members of this year's team.
"Seniors were delaying gradua
tion so they could wrestle next
year, something I wasn't aware
of," he explained.
Continuing wrestling for
another year will give team
members a chance to transfer to a
school with an ongoing wrestl
ing program without missing a
year, Ruetz said.
"Six to 10 of my students will
have to transfer after next year,"
DeMeo estimated.
During next year, the women's
gymnastics team will be "asses
sed" and then established on an
intercollegiate basis in 1977-78,

Ruetz said.
Sadao Hamada, coach of the
men's team, will continue as
coach of the two teams, Ruetz
said, "but he'll get a graduate as
sistant to help him and to relieve
the burden of his heavy teaching
load."
DeMeo will continue as a vol
unteer coach next year, Ruetz
said, and "probably will have to
look for another wrestling posi
tion after that."
Ruetz said any savings from
running a women's gymnastics
team instead of a wrestling team
"would be put back into some
thing else."
This year, the wrestling prog
ram has "direct costs of $12,000
to $13,000," Ruetz said, as well
as "hidden costs" that include
using computer time to check
wrestlers' academic standings,
administering the loyalty oath
and issuing mailings in response
to inquiries about the program.
DeMeo questioned the impor
tance of indirect costs, though,
and remarked "administering
the loyalty oath took under 10
minutes."
Ruetz said wrestling could

pay for itself if "we put every
thing into it like lowa State
does." However, he said the de
partment had rejected such a
possibility.
Another consideration Ruetz
cited was "a sheer space prob
lem in Encina" Gym (where both
the wrestling and men's gym
nastics teams practice).
"We don't have adequate
facilities for either one," he said.
"This way we hope to make one
of them more viable."
"If in the future we all of a
sudden got new facilities,"
Ruetz said, "notliing would pre
vent us from starting a wrestling
program again."
Viewing next season, DeMeo
said "we're going to have a prog
ram with no aid from the de
partment, not one nickel. But it's
going to be one of the strongest
and most successful programs
we've ever had."
Ruetz added he had consi
dered continuing wrestling as a
club sport, but noted "there
would be no opportunity for
competition on that level," as
there are few club wrestling
team:, in the area.

The intercollegiate wrestling
program here will terminate at
the end of the 1976-77 season
and a women's gymnastics team
will start in 1977-78, Athletic Di
rector Joe Ruetz announced yes
terday morning.
Ruetz also announced that
next fall men's and women's vol
leyball would be raised from
varsity club to varsity status.
Ending wrestling will cut
costs, Ruetz said, and also enable
the department to offer women's
intercollegiate gymnastics, a
sport he said he feels has more
student support.
"There's a broad interest on
the student body level for wo
men's gymnastics," Ruetz said.
"We've got 150 or 160 in the
women's PE classes."
He said that for wrestling,
though, "there's little student
participation," except on the

team level.
Wrestling coach Joe DeMeo
said, however, "I don't really
think the reasons he gave were
the real ones," and speculated
that Ruetz was "a little bit pre
judiced against minor sports."
Wrestling, previously a var
sity sport, will be a varsity club
sport next year and receive "very
little" funding, Ruetz said.
Ruetz added he had consi
dered eliminating wrestling
immediately, but changed his
mind after discussions with
members of this year's team.
"Seniors were delaying gradua
tion so they could wrestle next
year, something I wasn't aware
of," he explained.
Continuing wrestling for
another year will give team
members a chance to transfer to a
school with an ongoing wrestl
ing program without missing a
year, Ruetz said.
"Six to 10 of my students will
have to transfer after next year,"
DeMeo estimated.
During next year, the women's
gymnastics team will be "asses
sed" and then established on an
intercollegiate basis in 1977-78,

Ruetz said.
Sadao Hamada, coach of the
men's team, will continue as
coach of the two teams, Ruetz
said, "but he'll get a graduate as
sistant to help him and to relieve
the burden of his heavy teaching
load."
DeMeo will continue as a vol
unteer coach next year, Ruetz
said, and "probably will have to
look for another wrestling posi
tion after that."
Ruetz said any savings from
running a women's gymnastics
team instead of a wrestling team
"would be put back into some
thing else."
This year, the wrestling prog
ram has "direct costs of $12,000
to $13,000," Ruetz said, as well
as "hidden costs" that include
using computer time to check
wrestlers' academic standings,
administering the loyalty oath
and issuing mailings in response
to inquiries about the program.
DeMeo questioned the impor
tance of indirect costs, though,
and remarked "administering
the loyalty oath took under 10
minutes."
Ruetz said wrestling could

pay for itself if "we put every
thing into it like lowa State
does." However, he said the de
partment had rejected such a
possibility.
Another consideration Ruetz
cited was "a sheer space prob
lem in Encina" Gym (where both
the wrestling and men's gym
nastics teams practice).
"We don't have adequate
facilities for either one," he said.
"This way we hope to make one
of them more viable."
"If in the future we all of a
sudden got new facilities,"
Ruetz said, "notliing would pre
vent us from starting a wrestling
program again."
Viewing next season, DeMeo
said "we're going to have a prog
ram with no aid from the de
partment, not one nickel. But it's
going to be one of the strongest
and most successful programs
we've ever had."
Ruetz added he had consi
dered continuing wrestling as a
club sport, but noted "there
would be no opportunity for
competition on that level," as
there are few club wrestling
team:, in the area.
