# New steal mark set by Cards
## 
### Linda Buddenberg 
The Stanford baseball team
combined slugging and stealing
as it took wins Tuesday from St.
Mary's, 9-6, and Wednesday
from Sacramento State, 8-7.
Stanford's power hitting
drove in the winning runs in
both games. In the St. Mary's
game, designated hitter Rich
Bruzzone chose a perfect time
for his second homer of the sea
son — with the Cards down in
the bottom of the eighth, he hit a
grand slam over the left field
fence to cap an eight-run eighth
inning.
"I didn't hit it all that well,"
Bruzzone said. "I got ahead of
the ball . . . but I'll certainly take
the home run."
Minutes after Bruzzone's
blast, first baseman Tom Guar
dino added two more runs as he
ripped the ball not only over the
fence, but out of the park. Guar
dino hit another one out on
Wednesday, bringing his season
total to nine.
"We were also getting the cru
cial base hits," said Card coach
Ray Young after Wednesday's
game.
"Steve Davis especially was
getting good contact with the
ball," Young continued. "I think
he's out of his slump now."
Davis had three hits on Wed
nesday and was also busy on the
basepaths.
When he stole second in the
fourth inning, it was the team's
142 nd stolen base, breaking the

season record set last year.
Another stolen base record is
in jeopardy as Larry Reynolds
tied the individual season record
of 25 bases, after picking up two
in Wednesday's game.
Stanford pitching, however,
didn't match the offensive
fireworks.
"We weren't pitching well,"
said Young about Wednesday's
game. "John Yandle will start
(today), but I'm not sure about
Saturday. Harrison, Fiala, and
Irwin are all arm-weary."
Irwin went seven innings for
Stanford in Tuesday's game, giv
ing up only two runs on nine
hits.
While the Cardinals have been
picking up victories, they've
been losing players lately.
Second baseman Dave Perez
went "under the knife" yester
day for a knee operation. Young
said. Gary Pitchford can hit but
not throw due to an injured
thumb, and Bruce Walters has a
bruised hip.

The Stanford baseball team
combined slugging and stealing
as it took wins Tuesday from St.
Mary's, 9-6, and Wednesday
from Sacramento State, 8-7.
Stanford's power hitting
drove in the winning runs in
both games. In the St. Mary's
game, designated hitter Rich
Bruzzone chose a perfect time
for his second homer of the sea
son — with the Cards down in
the bottom of the eighth, he hit a
grand slam over the left field
fence to cap an eight-run eighth
inning.
"I didn't hit it all that well,"
Bruzzone said. "I got ahead of
the ball . . . but I'll certainly take
the home run."
Minutes after Bruzzone's
blast, first baseman Tom Guar
dino added two more runs as he
ripped the ball not only over the
fence, but out of the park. Guar
dino hit another one out on
Wednesday, bringing his season
total to nine.
"We were also getting the cru
cial base hits," said Card coach
Ray Young after Wednesday's
game.
"Steve Davis especially was
getting good contact with the
ball," Young continued. "I think
he's out of his slump now."
Davis had three hits on Wed
nesday and was also busy on the
basepaths.
When he stole second in the
fourth inning, it was the team's
142 nd stolen base, breaking the

season record set last year.
Another stolen base record is
in jeopardy as Larry Reynolds
tied the individual season record
of 25 bases, after picking up two
in Wednesday's game.
Stanford pitching, however,
didn't match the offensive
fireworks.
"We weren't pitching well,"
said Young about Wednesday's
game. "John Yandle will start
(today), but I'm not sure about
Saturday. Harrison, Fiala, and
Irwin are all arm-weary."
Irwin went seven innings for
Stanford in Tuesday's game, giv
ing up only two runs on nine
hits.
