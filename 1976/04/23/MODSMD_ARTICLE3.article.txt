# Bomb injures 18 in Boston courthouse
## 
### 
BOSTON (AP) â€” A dynamite blast
'ocked a marble-walled corridor of a
courthouse yesterday, injuring 18 per
sons. Officials said there was no evi
dence to link the blast to recent racial
unrest here.
The bomb exploded at exactly the
time an anonymous caller had warned
a bomb would explode. Police said
, here was a 10-minute delay in getting
word of the call to the workers in the
building.
The bombing followed three straight
days of racial violence, but Police
Commissioner Robert deGrazia said in
midafternoon, "This has nothing to do
with a racial incident." He did not
elaborate.
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said three
hours after the blast, "Obviously the
evidence is sketchy. There is no evi
dence at this point that this morning's
incident is connected with race or in
any way has any relationship to other
incidents that have taken place in the
-ity"
Boston has been beset by racial trou

ble since court-ordered busing began
in the fall of 1974.
Planted in elevator
One man lost a leg when the bomb
went off in the elevator lobby outside a
second-floor probation office.
Sheriff Thomas A. Eisenstadt quoted
the caller as saying, "A bomb will go
off, Jackson."
The caller was asked "What
Jackson?" but hung up without
answering.
Investigators said the name
"Jackson" would fit at least five per
sons: a black woman and her daughter
hit by stones Wednesday night in the
city's continuing racial problems, a
black man charged with the murder of
two white Boston coeds four years ago,
or two persons scheduled to be tried in
the courthouse yesterday.
Meantime, Mayor Kevin White ap
pealed for support for a previously
scheduled march against violence
which he is sponsoring today. "1 want
it to be the city's willingness to record
itself against violence," he said.
