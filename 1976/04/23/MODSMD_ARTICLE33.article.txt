Netters tackle Ojai
The 77th annual Ojai Intercol
legiate Tennis Championships
are schedululed to run until
Sunday but they're just about
over for Stanford, at least in si ng
les competition.
After the opening day of com
petition yesterday, only one
Card, Pat DuPre, is still alive in
the singles division. And he
didn't look all that strong him
self.
DuPre, Stanford's No. 1 man,
just got by Andy Lucchesi, No. 4
at USC, 7-6, 4-6, 7-6, in the sec
ond round. DuPre drew a bye in

off a 7-6, 6-2 upset win over UC
LA's Brian Teacher, the top

The Ojai tournament marked
the return of Stanford's Gene
Mayer, who has been bothered

much.

6-4.
The news was a little better in
doubles, as all three Card teams
are still in the tournament. The
Matt Mitchell-Wright and Mark
Mitchell-Mayer teams both won
their opening matches, while
Maze and DuPre drew an open
ing round bye and have yet to
play.

of Stanford defeated aCal Poly-

Wednesday against Sacramento State, as they notched their
142nd steal.
Netters tackle Ojai
The 77th annual Ojai Intercol
legiate Tennis Championships
are schedululed to run until
Sunday but they're just about
over for Stanford, at least in si ng
les competition.
After the opening day of com
petition yesterday, only one
Card, Pat DuPre, is still alive in
the singles division. And he
didn't look all that strong him
self.
DuPre, Stanford's No. 1 man,
just got by Andy Lucchesi, No. 4
at USC, 7-6, 4-6, 7-6, in the sec
ond round. DuPre drew a bye in

USC 9, Stanford 4 and California
0.

Maze, 7-6, 6-0. Maze was coming
off a 7-6, 6-2 upset win over UC
LA's Brian Teacher, the top
ranked college player in the U.S.
The Ojai tournament marked
the return of Stanford's Gene
Mayer, who has been bothered
by a muscle pull in his back, to
singles competition.
Stanford coach Dick Gould
had hoped that Mayer's perfor
mance at Ojai would help de
termine where the junior stand
out should be inserted into the
Cards' singles lineup. Gould
didn't get a chance to learn
much.
After beating Cal's John Hub
bell, 6-1, 6-2, in the first round,

Mayer, the third-ranked amateur
in the country, lost to Chris
Lewis of USC, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2.

in the second round.
In the open end of the tourna
ment, including players from all
sorts of schools, Stanford's John
Rast lost to Alex Olmedo, 4-6,
6-3, 6-3, and Craig Johnson came
upshortagainstGeneMalin,7-6,
6-4.
The news was a little better in
doubles, as all three Card teams
are still in the tournament. The
Matt Mitchell-Wright and Mark
Mitchell-Mayer teams both won
their opening matches, while
Maze and DuPre drew an open
ing round bye and have yet to
play.
In an early women's match,
