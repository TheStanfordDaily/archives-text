# Men golfers capture lead in tourney

The Stanford men's varsity
golf team kept its momentum
going from last week's second
place finish at the Western Col
legiate Championships as it
charged to a five stroke lead at
281 in the first round of the Stan
ford Invitational Champion
ships yesterday.
Stanford coach Bud Finger
knew the first round was going
to be Stanford's as Jay Johnston,
the first man to tee the ball up for
the Cards, eagled the first hole
on the Stanford course.
"Johnston's eagle was a great
start for us," said Finger. "If a
few other putts would have
dropped for us during the day
we would be six or seven putts
ahead of where we are now."
Johnston finished the round
tied for the lead individually at
69 with California's Dave
Fowler. Teammate Mike Peck
kept up the torrid pace as he
fired a 70 which deadlocked him
for third with San Jose State's
Scott Hoyt. The Stanford
sophomore could have ended up
in the lead, but three-putted on
the 18th green from 15 feet out.
Finger said what pleased him
the most was the play of Bruce
McDonald who shot 71.
"McDonald wasn't even on
the team four weeks ago,"
explained Finger, "but judging
from his performance at
Pasatiempo last week along with
this round, he's really coming
into his own."
