Soliah tells of love for Hearst
SACRAMENTO — Patricia Hearst's underground lover,
Steven Soliah, told jurors yesterday of the love affair
which lured him into radical circles but which was shat
tered when the FBI found Hearst.
"I lived with her. 1 slept with her. We had a close
relationship," he said.
Before her capture, he said he and Hearst had talked of
fleeing together to Oregon. "But on Sept. 18, I was ar
rested."
Under questioning by U.S. Atty. Dwayne Keyes, Soliah
admitted he was curious when Hearst stored cash in the
refrigerator at their San Francisco hideout. Although he
was supporting her with her earnings as a housepainter,
he said he didn't ask where she'd gotten the extra money.
Meanwhile, Hearst has regained her spirits and some
weight while hospitalized but is not ready for discharge
and cannot travel by air for 30 days, her doctor said yester
day. Hearst was hospitalized 10 days ago after suffering a
lung collapse.
Soliah told for the first time details of Hearst's "missing
year" as a fugitive in Sacramento, having abandoned a
Pennsylvania farmhouse hideout. Hearst refused to talk
about the period at her San Francisco bank rolb ery trial.
Soliah said he met Hearst in August 1974 when she and
the Harrises came from the East Coast to an apartment
arranged by Soliah, his sister and Kilgore.
Leftist revolt threatened in Beirut
BEIRUT — Leftist Moslems yesterday threatened to es
tablish a revolutionary government if Christian President
Suleiman Franjieh does not step down from office in 10
days.
Fighting tapered off in the year-old civil war that has left
16,500 dead and ruined the economy, but there still was
sporadic shelling and shooting. Police said 27 persons
were killed and 46 wounded throughout the country yes
terday.
Franjieh. the stubborn 65-year-old Christian leader
clinging to office despite passage of a parliamentary re
solution allowing election of a successor, summoned his
main Christian allies to his headquarters nine miles north
of Beirut for a meeting. The Christians have refused to
grant the Moslem majority's demands for more political
and economic control unless there is a clamp-down on
Palestinian guerrillas.
Embattled CIA official resigns
Walters' resignation came as a surprise. Press Secretary
Ron Nessen said Walters was quitting because he believed
himself "overdue to get out of the Army."
A CI A spokesman refused to comment on whether Wal
ters' resignation stemmed from investigations of the
agency during the past year or from reorganization of the
nation's intelligence agencies.

WASHINGTON — Lt. Gen. Vernon Walters, the Central
Intelligence Agency's deputy director who defended the
agency during recent congressional investigations, is
quitting, the White House announced yesterday.
CIA associate deputy director E. Henry Knoche, a civi
lian, will be nominated to replace Walters, the White
House said.
'Elections dull diplomacy'
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
said yesterday that presidential election campaigns tend
to inhibit major American diplomatic initiatives but that
Russia carries the main burden for the deterioration of
detente.
"It is clear when there are so many candidates in the
field there is a temptation to defer dramatic moves" until
after the election, he said.
"This is a result of concern by policy makers that such
initiatives will be construed by the public as politically
motivated," he said.
However, when pressed on this point, Kissinger said,
"No great new initiatives have been deferred" this year.
While acknowledging the impact of the presidential
campaign on foreign policy, Kissinger at the same time
denied that U.S. politics has caused the obvious slow
down in detente.
Concerning his trip to Africa, which starts today, Kis
singer said his main concern is to establish credibility in
the U.S. determination to support black majority rule in
the sub-Sahara region.
Colorado law limits bureaucracies
DENVER — Colorado Gov. Richard Lamm yesterday
signed the nation's first law designed to force governmen
tal bureaucracies out of business unless they can prove
they are needed.
A citizens' lobby, Colorado Common Cause, proposed
the so-called Sunset Law six months ago to control the
state version of supergovernment: a system of regulatory
agencies and programs that Common Cause feels has ex
ceeded its statutory authority.
The law gives an agency or program a life of six years.
Within that period, the legislature must call in directors or
supervisors to justify the agency's or program's con
tinuance.
If the legislators are satisfied, the program or agency
will continue for another six years, during which the
process will be repeated. If agencies cannot justify them
selves, they will be given a year to complete their busi
ness, with no reduction in their authority.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Warmer days. Lows in the 40s.
Highs in the upper 60s and 70s. West to northwest winds
10 to 20 mph.

"It is clear when there are so many candidates in the
field there is a temptation to defer dramatic moves" until
after the election, he said.
"This is a result of concern by policy makers that such
initiatives will be construed by the public as politically
motivated," he said.
However, when pressed on this point, Kissinger said,
"No great new initiatives have been deferred" this year.
While acknowledging the impact of the presidential
campaign on foreign policy, Kissinger at the same time
denied that U.S. politics has caused the obvious slow
down in detente.
Concerning his trip to Africa, which starts today, Kis

the U.S. determination to support black majority rule in

Colorado law limits bureaucracies
DENVER — Colorado Gov. Richard Lamm yesterday
signed the nation's first law designed to force governmen
tal bureaucracies out of business unless they can prove
they are needed.
A citizens' lobby, Colorado Common Cause, proposed
the so-called Sunset Law six months ago to control the
state version of supergovernment: a system of regulatory
agencies and programs that Common Cause feels has ex
ceeded its statutory authority.
The law gives an agency or program a life of six years.
Within that period, the legislature must call in directors or
supervisors to justify the agency's or program's con
tinuance.
If the legislators are satisfied, the program or agency
will continue for another six years, during which the
process will be repeated. If agencies cannot justify them
selves, they will be given a year to complete their busi
ness, with no reduction in their authority.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Warmer days. Lows in the 40s.
Highs in the upper 60s and 70s. West to northwest winds
10 to 20 mph.
Soliah tells of love for Hearst
SACRAMENTO — Patricia Hearst's underground lover,
Steven Soliah, told jurors yesterday of the love affair
which lured him into radical circles but which was shat
tered when the FBI found Hearst.
"I lived with her. 1 slept with her. We had a close
relationship," he said.
Before her capture, he said he and Hearst had talked of
fleeing together to Oregon. "But on Sept. 18, I was ar
rested."
Under questioning by U.S. Atty. Dwayne Keyes, Soliah
admitted he was curious when Hearst stored cash in the
refrigerator at their San Francisco hideout. Although he
was supporting her with her earnings as a housepainter,
he said he didn't ask where she'd gotten the extra money.
Meanwhile, Hearst has regained her spirits and some
weight while hospitalized but is not ready for discharge
and cannot travel by air for 30 days, her doctor said yester
day. Hearst was hospitalized 10 days ago after suffering a
lung collapse.
Soliah told for the first time details of Hearst's "missing
year" as a fugitive in Sacramento, having abandoned a
Pennsylvania farmhouse hideout. Hearst refused to talk
about the period at her San Francisco bank rolb ery trial.
Soliah said he met Hearst in August 1974 when she and
the Harrises came from the East Coast to an apartment
arranged by Soliah, his sister and Kilgore.
Leftist revolt threatened in Beirut
BEIRUT — Leftist Moslems yesterday threatened to es
tablish a revolutionary government if Christian President
Suleiman Franjieh does not step down from office in 10
days.
Fighting tapered off in the year-old civil war that has left
16,500 dead and ruined the economy, but there still was
sporadic shelling and shooting. Police said 27 persons
were killed and 46 wounded throughout the country yes
terday.
Franjieh. the stubborn 65-year-old Christian leader
clinging to office despite passage of a parliamentary re
solution allowing election of a successor, summoned his
main Christian allies to his headquarters nine miles north
of Beirut for a meeting. The Christians have refused to
grant the Moslem majority's demands for more political
and economic control unless there is a clamp-down on
Palestinian guerrillas.

Leftist revolt threatened in Beirut
BEIRUT — Leftist Moslems yesterday threatened to es
tablish a revolutionary government if Christian President
Suleiman Franjieh does not step down from office in 10
days.
Fighting tapered off in the year-old civil war that has left
16,500 dead and ruined the economy, but there still was
sporadic shelling and shooting. Police said 27 persons
were killed and 46 wounded throughout the country yes
terday.
Franjieh. the stubborn 65-year-old Christian leader
clinging to office despite passage of a parliamentary re
solution allowing election of a successor, summoned his
main Christian allies to his headquarters nine miles north
of Beirut for a meeting. The Christians have refused to
grant the Moslem majority's demands for more political
and economic control unless there is a clamp-down on
Palestinian guerrillas.
Embattled CIA official resigns
Walters' resignation came as a surprise. Press Secretary
Ron Nessen said Walters was quitting because he believed
himself "overdue to get out of the Army."
A CI A spokesman refused to comment on whether Wal
ters' resignation stemmed from investigations of the
agency during the past year or from reorganization of the
nation's intelligence agencies.

WASHINGTON — Lt. Gen. Vernon Walters, the Central
Intelligence Agency's deputy director who defended the
agency during recent congressional investigations, is
quitting, the White House announced yesterday.
CIA associate deputy director E. Henry Knoche, a civi

'Elections dull diplomacy'
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
said yesterday that presidential election campaigns tend
to inhibit major American diplomatic initiatives but that
Russia carries the main burden for the deterioration of
detente.
"It is clear when there are so many candidates in the
field there is a temptation to defer dramatic moves" until
after the election, he said.
"This is a result of concern by policy makers that such
initiatives will be construed by the public as politically
motivated," he said.
However, when pressed on this point, Kissinger said,
"No great new initiatives have been deferred" this year.
While acknowledging the impact of the presidential
campaign on foreign policy, Kissinger at the same time
denied that U.S. politics has caused the obvious slow
down in detente.
Concerning his trip to Africa, which starts today, Kis
singer said his main concern is to establish credibility in
the U.S. determination to support black majority rule in
the sub-Sahara region.
Colorado law limits bureaucracies
DENVER — Colorado Gov. Richard Lamm yesterday
signed the nation's first law designed to force governmen
tal bureaucracies out of business unless they can prove
they are needed.
A citizens' lobby, Colorado Common Cause, proposed
the so-called Sunset Law six months ago to control the
state version of supergovernment: a system of regulatory
agencies and programs that Common Cause feels has ex
ceeded its statutory authority.
The law gives an agency or program a life of six years.
Within that period, the legislature must call in directors or
supervisors to justify the agency's or program's con
tinuance.
If the legislators are satisfied, the program or agency
will continue for another six years, during which the
process will be repeated. If agencies cannot justify them
selves, they will be given a year to complete their busi
ness, with no reduction in their authority.
