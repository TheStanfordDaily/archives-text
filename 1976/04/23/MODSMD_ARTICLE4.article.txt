# Petroff slate takes COP runoff election
## 
### Lori Matsukawa 
The Vic Petroff slate won this week's
runoff Council of Presidents (COP)
election with strong support coming
from the voters at the Graduate School
of Business (GSB) and Escondido Vil
lage polls.
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Mike Murray said the results are tenta
tive pending receipt of overseas bal
lots.
Petroff, along with slate members A 1
Toinaszczuk, Carole Houck and Deric
Jennings, received 1403 votes. Their
opponents, Dan Howard, Keith Ar
chuleta, Liz Ryll and Bill Tyndall re

ceived 1243 votes.
"We'd like to thank all of those
people who supported us. We're ready
to get to work on our proposals," said
Petroff quietly, seemingly in a daze,
after the results were announced by
Murray at the ASSU office yesterday
afternoon.
Percentages
The Howard slate held a larger per
centage of the votes at the post office,
Engineering Corner and History
Corner polling places.
However, the Petroff slate held a
majority of votes at the Physics Tank
and a sweeping 88.2 percent of the
votes at the GSB and Escondido Vil
lage polls.
''This shows where our major appeal
has been," said Petroff. "Deric (Jen
nings) has done the work for graduate
students,and his reputation stands."
Jennings is chairman of the Graduate
Student Council (GSC).
"I attribute our win to making sure
we addressed the most important is
sues and an awful lot of hard work,"
said Petroff.
Archuleta of the defeated Howard
slate said, "We'd like to express our

appreciation to all the people who've
helped us."
'Issues not addressed'
"There were many broader issues
that were never brought up in the
campaign that (still) need to be addres
sed," said Archuleta, listing award
and tenure issues, admissions criteria
and recruitment procedures as those
areas that need attention.
Howard could not be reached for
comment.
The election results must be cer
tified by the ASSU senate at Mon
day's senate meeting to become offi
cial.
"Our number one priority is te
nure," said Petroff. "We plan to en
courage student participation. We will
compile a list of all those (persons)
eligible for tenure and get this list out
to students in October.
"We will ask the students to indicate
who the best teachers are and send
these recommendations to the de
partment heads before the decision is
made," he said.
After the the interview with the
Daily, Petroff, a junior, said, "Excuse
me. I'm going to call my parents."
