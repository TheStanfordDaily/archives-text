# ASSU may reassess SJC legitimacy; experts disagree on proper interpretation
## 
### Dan Fiduccia News Analysis 
Will the question of legitimacy of
the Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
soon "resolve itself into being no con
troversy at all"?
Such is the opinion of William
Hoke, chairman of the ASSU Senate.
But members of the senate have in
dicated that the whole matter may be
taken up again when the senate meets
Monday night.
Hoke, in a lengthy written statement
(which appeared in edited version in
Tuesday's Daily), pieced together
what he called a logical "chain that
leads to a virtually inescapable con
clusion (nearly a syllogism) that the
action of the senate last spring in ap
proving amendments to the charter
was legitimate."
But experts on the ASSU Constitu
tion disagree as to whether the senate
exceeded its authority when it okayed
amendments to the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, creating the
SJC.
Memo from Braunstein
The charter was amended once be
fore. during winter quarter, 1969. Be
fore then, ASSU President Denis
Hayes and Speaker of the ASSU Legis
lature (now called the senate) Yale
Braunstein wrote a memorandum stat
ing the proposed amendments would
require 2/3 approval by the students
before the ASSU Legislature could act
on them.
This was adopted as a rule of the
legislature at a fall quarter meeting in
1968, according to Braunstein, and
was later incorporated into the current

ASSU Constitution (of which Hayes
was a framer) as Article IV, Section 1.
The pertinent clause reads:
"The Association (ASSU) shall rec
ognize the authority of university jud
icial bodies over members of the As
sociation only if those judicial bodies
shall have been approved by two
thirds of those members of the associa
tion voting in a general election."
In last spring's referendum, the SJC
fell far short of the 2/3 majority.
The 1969 amendments did receive
the 2/3 majority, with 1635 students
voting in favor and 484 voting against.
Student approval
Hayes explained what was intended
by Article IV, Section 1.
"Our intent in framing was to say the
student moods will change from year
to year, hut whatever (judicial) body is
imposed will require a substantial stu
dent approval — thus the 2/3 clause."
Hoke argued that the original char
ter was approved by a 2/3 majority, as
was its amending process — which
specifies that amendments must be
approved by majority vote of the
LASSU (now the senate) and the
Academic Council, followed by ap
proval from President Richard Lyman.
This 2/3 approval, Hoke noted, was
mentioned in Clause 5 of the Letters of
Acceptance of the ASSU Constitution.
These letters, written by then-
University President Kenneth Pitzer,
include clauses interpreting various
sections of the constitution.
'No qualification'
"It has to be recognized that the Let
ters of Acceptance make no qualifica
tion about the validity of the charter. It

did not say that the charter was valid
except for Article 111, the amending
section," Hoke wrote.
But Braunstein, reached Tuesday in
New York City, disagreed with Hoke's
reading of Clause 5 of Pitzer's letter.
That clause states:
"Since the present Legislative and
Judicial Charter, as amended, was ap
proved by more than two-thirds of
those students voting in a referendum,
I interpret nothing in the new constitu
tion as disestablishing any existing
judicial process."
According to Braunstein, Pitzer
conceded in Clause 5 that changes
from any judicial process — including
amendments to the charter but not in
cluding procedural rules laid down by

the judicial body — would require 2/3
approval once again.
"If there were going to be any major
changes in the judicial body, any sub
stantive changes, you needed the 2/3,"
Braunstein said. "Pitzer expressly rec
ognized our retroactive approval to the
old charter under the new constitu
tion, and that future changes would
need 2/3 also."
Hoke in error?
Hoke's argument, Braunstein said, is
wrong.
"(In Pitzer's Letters of Acceptance) it
doesn't say you can change the exist
ing judicial process' without going to
the students for 2/3 approval."
The charter, Braunstein pointed out.
