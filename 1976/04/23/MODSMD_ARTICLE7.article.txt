## Opinions Determining obscurity 
### 
Eric Rothfeld

I have had to summon all my
courage, fortitude and audacity
in order to comment on French
Prof. Robert Cohn's charges ap
pearing in the Daily April 16 ar
ticle, "Professors lured away."
You see, I endured my under
graduate years at the relatively
obscure institution, the Univer
sity of Virginia, which Cohn as
serts has lured away Stanford fa
culty by offering astronomical
salaries.
Taking ino full account my
embarassingly humble
background, I would like to ask a
few questions about the salient
criteria Cohn employs for de
termining relative obscurity.
Is his an historical perspec
tive? Must the University of Vir
ginia continue to suffer under
the stigma of its unimaginative,
little-known founder, Thomas
Jefferson, and its mere 150 years
of academic mediocrity?
Is his an academician's
perspective? Had the well
informed, contemporary Cohn
never heard of any liberal arts
departments nor faculty mem
bers at the University of Virginia
prior to the theft of Prof. Walter
Sokol?
Or, is his a humanitarian's
perspective? Has he indeed
heard the anguished cries of Vir

ginia scholars, enslaved in the
perditious Shenandoah Valley,
merely 100 miles from the insig
nificant metropolitan and cul
tural center of Washington, D.C.,
who can no longer endure their
lack of recognition? Perhaps he
can enlighten me on their con
stant attempts at protestation
and outright defection, which
the University of Virginia has
cleverly suppressed by ran
domly dispersing astronomical
salaries?
It would not be just to limit my
recognition to Cohn alone. Cer
taily the expertise of the Daily
must alone be lauded. Without
the Daily's highly inquisitive,
objective and comprehensive
investigative reporting, the Uni
versity of Virginia's relative
obscurity might have continued
to inconspicuously persist.
Once again the Daily has un
covered pertinent information
vital to the academic commun
ity. I can only pray that future
generations will take heed of this
disclosure and not be forced to
innocently labor in futility as I
did at the University of Virginia.
1 can not adequately express my
appreciation for the Daily's
priorities and journalistic
sophistication.
It has handled this delicate
subject with the highest degree

of professionalism, such a rare
exception for the ordinary uni
versity newspaper, yet such a
common rule for the Daily. Had I
not been fortunate enough to fol
low the compelling two-year
series on the volatile Bonfire and
Cardinal-Robber Baron con
troversies, I might have been
wholly astounded, rather than
moderately surprised, by the re
velations on Virginia's relative
obscurity.
Finally, I must make a confes
sion that supports Cohn's and
the Daily's acknowledgement of
relative obscurity. It has been a
very arduous, frustrating ad
justment to the pompous pre
stige of Stanford after my years
of ignorant bliss and security at
Virginia. I realize I must con
tinue to struggle in hopes of ac
quiring their pretentious delu
sions.
I'm confident I will succeed
with such continued enlighten
ment and inspiration. I ask only
for their patience, hoping they
will compassionately remember
my humble roots.

investigative reporting, the Uni

obscurity might have continued
to inconspicuously persist.

covered pertinent information
vital to the academic commun
ity. I can only pray that future

disclosure and not be forced to
innocently labor in futility as I

appreciation for the Daily's
priorities and journalistic
sophistication.
It has handled this delicate
subject with the highest degree

of professionalism, such a rare
exception for the ordinary uni

common rule for the Daily. Had I
not been fortunate enough to fol

wholly astounded, rather than
moderately surprised, by the re

the Daily's acknowledgement of
relative obscurity. It has been a
very arduous, frustrating ad

Virginia. I realize I must con

I'm confident I will succeed
with such continued enlighten

for their patience, hoping they
will compassionately remember
my humble roots.

I have had to summon all my
courage, fortitude and audacity
in order to comment on French
Prof. Robert Cohn's charges ap
pearing in the Daily April 16 ar
ticle, "Professors lured away."
You see, I endured my under
graduate years at the relatively
obscure institution, the Univer
sity of Virginia, which Cohn as
serts has lured away Stanford fa
culty by offering astronomical
salaries.
Taking ino full account my
embarassingly humble
background, I would like to ask a
few questions about the salient
criteria Cohn employs for de
termining relative obscurity.
Is his an historical perspec
tive? Must the University of Vir
ginia continue to suffer under
the stigma of its unimaginative,
little-known founder, Thomas
Jefferson, and its mere 150 years
of academic mediocrity?
Is his an academician's
perspective? Had the well
informed, contemporary Cohn
never heard of any liberal arts
departments nor faculty mem
bers at the University of Virginia
prior to the theft of Prof. Walter
Sokol?
Or, is his a humanitarian's
perspective? Has he indeed
heard the anguished cries of Vir

ginia scholars, enslaved in the
perditious Shenandoah Valley,
merely 100 miles from the insig
nificant metropolitan and cul
tural center of Washington, D.C.,
who can no longer endure their
lack of recognition? Perhaps he
can enlighten me on their con
stant attempts at protestation
and outright defection, which
the University of Virginia has
cleverly suppressed by ran
domly dispersing astronomical
salaries?
It would not be just to limit my
recognition to Cohn alone. Cer
taily the expertise of the Daily
must alone be lauded. Without
the Daily's highly inquisitive,
objective and comprehensive
investigative reporting, the Uni
versity of Virginia's relative
obscurity might have continued
to inconspicuously persist.
