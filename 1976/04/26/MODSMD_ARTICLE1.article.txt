# Gunning for RoMo? Hope you drew low

### Stephen Crolius 
□id you list either of the new Robert S. Moore
houses (RoMoNo and R0M0S0) or the elegant
sounding 558 Mayfield at the top of your draw
card?
Did you get a priority card for La Casa Italiana or
the American studies residential program? Did you
get a low draw number? A very low draw number?
If you can answer al 1 of the above questions in the
affirmative, then maybe, just maybe, you will be
living in one of the three new Row houses nextfall.
"We anticipate (the new Row houses) to be the
most popular in the draw by a longshot," Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton said a few
Fridays ago during a tour of the University's newest
residences.
Most of those in the tour were fund raisers whose
job it is to find $600,000 to cover the cost of 558
Mayfield. Money for the two RoMo houses came
from the same Moore estate which gave us the
FloMo complex. (Ro was Flo's husband.)
The tour started in ROMOSO, which will be the
home of the American studies program.
ROMOSO, like its brother and cousin next door,
will accommodate about 50 students. The three
together will have an official occupancy of 154;
next year, however, so as not to cramp the faculty
residence staff in the two theme houses, 145 stu
dents will have places.
Spaciousness and intimacy
Immediately noticeable in ROMOSO, despite the
construction scraps lying on the floors and the
smells of drying paint and plaster, was theapparent
balance between spaciousness and intimacy.
The ground floor consists of a large front en
tranceway leading on the left to the dining room
and kitchen, straight ahead to the main stairway
and to the right to the living room.

Both dining and living rooms seem very light, an
effect created by the large windows (some of them
floor-to-ceiling) and the white walls.
Between the dining room and the kitchen is a
serving area/kitchenette where students will be
able to fix snacks. The living room features a stone
fireplace and built-in bench-type seating.
The wide stairway is lined with floor-to-ceiling
windows and has a su ndeck off one of the landings.
On the two upper floors are the sleeping quarters.
The leader of the tour, Bob Nerrie, a senior planner
from the Planning Office, pointed out that an em
phasis was placed on variety in designing the
rooms.
While most are more intimate than spacious, very
few rooms are exactly alike. They vary in shape,
window size and "extras" — at least one room, for
example, has its own balcony.
'Quite a few' doubles
There are some single rooms, Nerrie said, "quite
a few" doubles and some triples. Doubles, he ad
ded, are based on two different patterns: one, a
sitting room/bedroom type; the other, two bed
rooms. The two layouts are distinguished from
each other by the arrangement of the closets, which
incidentally, also emphasize intimacy over spaci
ousness.
The next house in the tour, RoMoNo (or "La Casa
Italiana," as it will be called) has the "most con
troversial design," according to Horton. He is refer
ring to the fact that the living room ceiling is 3V2
stories above the living room floor.
Italian villa
The living room creates an impression of being in
the courtyard of a small Italian villa, with three tiers
of open-air corridors lining the four walls. These
corridors lead to the rooms, which are much the
same as in ROMOSO.

Explaining the diversity in the interior arrange
ment of the three houses, Nerrie said that a different
partner from the architectual firm which designed
the residences, Bull, Field, Volkmann and
Stockwell, drew up the plans for each house. Each
of the designers spent one night and several even
ings in the Row houses to get a feeling for both their
good and bad points.
RoMoNo will also feature a stone fireplace in the
living room and beautiful views from the third
floor. Planters will be hung out over the living room
from the corridors, according to Horton.
Exterior variety
The exterior of 558 Mayfield is shingled, in con
trast to both RoMo houses,which will be different
colored stucco only "to provide variety," Nerrie
said.
The distinguishing features inside 558 Mayfield
are the 30- and 60-degree angles at which the walls
and the ceiling beams intersect.
Since 558 Mayfield was closest to completion, a
single room was finished and furnished for de
monstration purposes. It featured wall-to-wall car
peting, the standard University metal bed frame
and "contemporary American," natural finish,
hardwood furniture — a desk, a chair, book
shelves and a half-dresser.
The chair did not fit under the desk, but this error
will be rectified before next September, Horton
said.
558 Mayfield is shaped in a hollow "U." On the
concave side is a tree of such imposing height that it
almost seems as if the tree has shaped the house to
itself. This impression adds weight to Nerrie's con
tention that "the main criterion (for the design of
the houses) was to stay within the feeling of the
Row."

almost seems as if the tree has shaped the house to

the houses) was to stay within the feeling of the

GUIDED TOUR — Larry Horton (right), associate dean of student affairs,
shows off one of the new Robert Moore houses during an earlier stage of
construction. Now nearly finished, the three new Row houses will be home to
a group of students with extremely low draw numbers next year.
□id you list either of the new Robert S. Moore
houses (RoMoNo and R0M0S0) or the elegant
sounding 558 Mayfield at the top of your draw
card?
Did you get a priority card for La Casa Italiana or
the American studies residential program? Did you
get a low draw number? A very low draw number?
If you can answer al 1 of the above questions in the
affirmative, then maybe, just maybe, you will be
living in one of the three new Row houses nextfall.
"We anticipate (the new Row houses) to be the
most popular in the draw by a longshot," Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton said a few
Fridays ago during a tour of the University's newest
residences.
Most of those in the tour were fund raisers whose
job it is to find $600,000 to cover the cost of 558
Mayfield. Money for the two RoMo houses came
from the same Moore estate which gave us the
FloMo complex. (Ro was Flo's husband.)
The tour started in ROMOSO, which will be the
home of the American studies program.
ROMOSO, like its brother and cousin next door,
will accommodate about 50 students. The three
together will have an official occupancy of 154;
next year, however, so as not to cramp the faculty
residence staff in the two theme houses, 145 stu
dents will have places.
Spaciousness and intimacy
Immediately noticeable in ROMOSO, despite the
construction scraps lying on the floors and the
smells of drying paint and plaster, was theapparent
balance between spaciousness and intimacy.
The ground floor consists of a large front en
tranceway leading on the left to the dining room
and kitchen, straight ahead to the main stairway
and to the right to the living room.

Both dining and living rooms seem very light, an
effect created by the large windows (some of them
floor-to-ceiling) and the white walls.
Between the dining room and the kitchen is a
serving area/kitchenette where students will be
able to fix snacks. The living room features a stone
fireplace and built-in bench-type seating.
The wide stairway is lined with floor-to-ceiling
windows and has a su ndeck off one of the landings.
On the two upper floors are the sleeping quarters.
The leader of the tour, Bob Nerrie, a senior planner
from the Planning Office, pointed out that an em
phasis was placed on variety in designing the
rooms.
While most are more intimate than spacious, very
few rooms are exactly alike. They vary in shape,
window size and "extras" — at least one room, for
example, has its own balcony.
'Quite a few' doubles
There are some single rooms, Nerrie said, "quite
a few" doubles and some triples. Doubles, he ad
ded, are based on two different patterns: one, a
sitting room/bedroom type; the other, two bed
rooms. The two layouts are distinguished from
each other by the arrangement of the closets, which
incidentally, also emphasize intimacy over spaci
ousness.
The next house in the tour, RoMoNo (or "La Casa
Italiana," as it will be called) has the "most con
troversial design," according to Horton. He is refer
ring to the fact that the living room ceiling is 3V2
stories above the living room floor.
Italian villa
The living room creates an impression of being in
the courtyard of a small Italian villa, with three tiers
of open-air corridors lining the four walls. These
corridors lead to the rooms, which are much the
same as in ROMOSO.

Explaining the diversity in the interior arrange
ment of the three houses, Nerrie said that a different
partner from the architectual firm which designed
the residences, Bull, Field, Volkmann and
Stockwell, drew up the plans for each house. Each
of the designers spent one night and several even
ings in the Row houses to get a feeling for both their
good and bad points.
RoMoNo will also feature a stone fireplace in the
living room and beautiful views from the third
floor. Planters will be hung out over the living room
from the corridors, according to Horton.
Exterior variety
The exterior of 558 Mayfield is shingled, in con
trast to both RoMo houses,which will be different
colored stucco only "to provide variety," Nerrie
said.
The distinguishing features inside 558 Mayfield
are the 30- and 60-degree angles at which the walls
and the ceiling beams intersect.
Since 558 Mayfield was closest to completion, a
single room was finished and furnished for de
monstration purposes. It featured wall-to-wall car
peting, the standard University metal bed frame
and "contemporary American," natural finish,
hardwood furniture — a desk, a chair, book
shelves and a half-dresser.
The chair did not fit under the desk, but this error
will be rectified before next September, Horton

trast to both RoMo houses,which will be different
colored stucco only "to provide variety," Nerrie
said.
The distinguishing features inside 558 Mayfield
are the 30- and 60-degree angles at which the walls
and the ceiling beams intersect.
Since 558 Mayfield was closest to completion, a
single room was finished and furnished for de
monstration purposes. It featured wall-to-wall car
peting, the standard University metal bed frame
and "contemporary American," natural finish,
hardwood furniture — a desk, a chair, book
shelves and a half-dresser.
The chair did not fit under the desk, but this error
will be rectified before next September, Horton
said.
558 Mayfield is shaped in a hollow "U." On the
concave side is a tree of such imposing height that it
almost seems as if the tree has shaped the house to
itself. This impression adds weight to Nerrie's con
tention that "the main criterion (for the design of
the houses) was to stay within the feeling of the
Row."

GUIDED TOUR — Larry Horton (right), associate dean of student affairs,
shows off one of the new Robert Moore houses during an earlier stage of
construction. Now nearly finished, the three new Row houses will be home to
a group of students with extremely low draw numbers next year.
□id you list either of the new Robert S. Moore
houses (RoMoNo and R0M0S0) or the elegant
sounding 558 Mayfield at the top of your draw
card?
Did you get a priority card for La Casa Italiana or
the American studies residential program? Did you
get a low draw number? A very low draw number?
If you can answer al 1 of the above questions in the
affirmative, then maybe, just maybe, you will be
living in one of the three new Row houses nextfall.
"We anticipate (the new Row houses) to be the
most popular in the draw by a longshot," Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton said a few
Fridays ago during a tour of the University's newest
residences.
Most of those in the tour were fund raisers whose
job it is to find $600,000 to cover the cost of 558
Mayfield. Money for the two RoMo houses came
from the same Moore estate which gave us the
FloMo complex. (Ro was Flo's husband.)
The tour started in ROMOSO, which will be the
home of the American studies program.
ROMOSO, like its brother and cousin next door,
will accommodate about 50 students. The three
together will have an official occupancy of 154;
next year, however, so as not to cramp the faculty
residence staff in the two theme houses, 145 stu
dents will have places.
Spaciousness and intimacy
Immediately noticeable in ROMOSO, despite the
construction scraps lying on the floors and the
smells of drying paint and plaster, was theapparent
balance between spaciousness and intimacy.
The ground floor consists of a large front en
tranceway leading on the left to the dining room
and kitchen, straight ahead to the main stairway
and to the right to the living room.

Both dining and living rooms seem very light, an
effect created by the large windows (some of them
floor-to-ceiling) and the white walls.
Between the dining room and the kitchen is a
serving area/kitchenette where students will be
able to fix snacks. The living room features a stone
fireplace and built-in bench-type seating.
The wide stairway is lined with floor-to-ceiling
windows and has a su ndeck off one of the landings.
On the two upper floors are the sleeping quarters.
The leader of the tour, Bob Nerrie, a senior planner
from the Planning Office, pointed out that an em
phasis was placed on variety in designing the
rooms.
While most are more intimate than spacious, very
few rooms are exactly alike. They vary in shape,
window size and "extras" — at least one room, for
example, has its own balcony.
'Quite a few' doubles
There are some single rooms, Nerrie said, "quite
a few" doubles and some triples. Doubles, he ad
ded, are based on two different patterns: one, a
sitting room/bedroom type; the other, two bed
rooms. The two layouts are distinguished from
each other by the arrangement of the closets, which
incidentally, also emphasize intimacy over spaci
ousness.
The next house in the tour, RoMoNo (or "La Casa
Italiana," as it will be called) has the "most con
troversial design," according to Horton. He is refer
ring to the fact that the living room ceiling is 3V2
stories above the living room floor.
Italian villa
The living room creates an impression of being in
the courtyard of a small Italian villa, with three tiers
of open-air corridors lining the four walls. These
corridors lead to the rooms, which are much the
same as in ROMOSO.

Explaining the diversity in the interior arrange
ment of the three houses, Nerrie said that a different
partner from the architectual firm which designed
the residences, Bull, Field, Volkmann and
Stockwell, drew up the plans for each house. Each
of the designers spent one night and several even
ings in the Row houses to get a feeling for both their
good and bad points.
RoMoNo will also feature a stone fireplace in the
living room and beautiful views from the third
floor. Planters will be hung out over the living room
from the corridors, according to Horton.
