Departmental tenure deci
sions are usually the result of a
complicated and conscientious
process. Partially informed stu
dents can easily misjudge the
wisdom of such decisions.
Yet as a concerned undergrad I
would like to express my sup
port for granting tenure to Assoc.
Economics Prof. Duncan Foley.
Having taken over 50 units of
economics taught by professors
of various rank, I have been puz
zled by the poor teaching ability
in the Economics Department.
Ironically some of the most effec
tive teachers I have had were vis
iting professors.
One exception was Foley. All
professors encourage students to
ask questions. Mysteriously, lit
tle true discission goes on in
econ classes.
There are long monologues
dominated by a few students.
There are requests to repeat part
of the lecture. It may be that stu
dents are awed by their mentor's
intellectual superiority.
But in Economics 53 taught by
Foley, there are lucid lectures
and lively discussions of 10 mi
nutes or more every day. The en
thused students question and
clarify the lecture materials
through questions.
The Economics Department is
endowed with favorable pre
conditions to self-sustained
growth. Factors such as a charm
ing campus and delightful
weather, strong Mathematics
and Statistics departments, and
the nationally prominent busi
ness school and Food Research
Institute offer variable resources
and support to economic

studies.
In the late 1950s and early
19605, the department had
prominent figures such as Prof.
Kenneth Arrow. Much of the
momentum has since been lost.
In a recent survey, the depart
ment was ranked seventh na
tionally.
The department is further af
fected by the scheduled retire
ment ofTibor Scitovsky and
Moses Abramovitz and the de
parture of Prof. Joseph Stiglitz to
Oxford. It would be unfortunate
to see a teacher with such a
strong publication record as
Foley leave.

Frye improper
Since its inception in 1974 the
ASSU Speakers Bureau has been
funded three times by one dollar
student assessments. Its ostensi
ble purpose, as stated in the Se
nate By-Laws is to invite distin
guished, provocative speakers to
present various viewpoints in
lectures for the edification and
intellectual stimulation of the
Stanford community.
Past speakers include William
F. Buckley, John Sawhill and
Jimmy Carter, with John Kenneth
Galbraith due later this quarter.
Tuesday, April 20, 1300 stu
dents realized the use of their as
sessment dollars by attending
the lecture/performance of com
edian David Frye.
That the vast majority of the
students present enjoyed him
immensely is clear. That this
was a valid use of the Speakers
Bureau funds is not.

Frye is not a political com
mentator, as some have said; he
is a gifted impressionist of polit
ical as well as entertainment fi
gures who crudely and tas
telessly uses these impressions
to deliver ethnic, religious and
sexist slurs on these individuals.
Surely Richard Nixon urinating
on the floor, Kissinger depicted
as Hitler, and Humphrey selling
urine to the Poles are not the
things of which enlightening
lectures are made.
Not that there isn't a need for
entertainment. Thirteen
hundred students demonstrated
that.
But the Speakers Bureau
should leave that concern to
ASSU Special Events, for whose
functions admission is charged.
Student subsidization of enter
tainment violates the Speakers
Bureau mandate.

Pound: man and poet
On Pound: The poet and the
man ought not to be confused

when evaluating the poetry, I
quite agree (that distinction oc
curred in my letter). But there is
also a loose linkage in what is
known as "the Pound affair" —
Pound himself insisted on thfc
tie — and in that context 1 still
vigorously disagree with the op
position.
On the other hand, I can admit
that my characterization of his
poetry as "rather mediocre" was
inadequate. Some bias undoub'
tedly crept it.
It was — Passover and Good
Friday, in a time of spiritual
decay — a week of deep human
concern.
Even the greatest of poets is
ultimately called to account in
moral terms. Stephane Mallarrm'
for instance, demonstrated tha*.
it is possible to be an artist of the
very highest rank and yet a stub
bornly decent peson in the
clutches.
Knowing the odds in his case,
it is moving to read his remark
about Paul Gauguin: "One hasn''
the right to abandon his chil
dren, even to found a religion."

Since its inception in 1974 the
ASSU Speakers Bureau has been
funded three times by one dollar
student assessments. Its ostensi
ble purpose, as stated in the Se
nate By-Laws is to invite distin
guished, provocative speakers to
present various viewpoints in
lectures for the edification and
intellectual stimulation of the
Stanford community.
Past speakers include William
F. Buckley, John Sawhill and
Jimmy Carter, with John Kenneth
Galbraith due later this quarter.
Tuesday, April 20, 1300 stu
dents realized the use of their as
sessment dollars by attending
the lecture/performance of com
edian David Frye.
That the vast majority of the
students present enjoyed him
immensely is clear. That this
was a valid use of the Speakers
Bureau funds is not.

Frye is not a political com
mentator, as some have said; he
is a gifted impressionist of polit
ical as well as entertainment fi
gures who crudely and tas
telessly uses these impressions
to deliver ethnic, religious and
sexist slurs on these individuals.
Surely Richard Nixon urinating
on the floor, Kissinger depicted
as Hitler, and Humphrey selling
urine to the Poles are not the
things of which enlightening
lectures are made.
Not that there isn't a need for
entertainment. Thirteen
hundred students demonstrated
that.
But the Speakers Bureau
should leave that concern to
ASSU Special Events, for whose
functions admission is charged.
Student subsidization of enter
tainment violates the Speakers
Bureau mandate.

Pound: man and poet
On Pound: The poet and the
man ought not to be confused

when evaluating the poetry, I
quite agree (that distinction oc
curred in my letter). But there is
also a loose linkage in what is
known as "the Pound affair" —
Pound himself insisted on thfc
tie — and in that context 1 still
vigorously disagree with the op
position.
On the other hand, I can admit
that my characterization of his
poetry as "rather mediocre" was
inadequate. Some bias undoub'
tedly crept it.
It was — Passover and Good
Friday, in a time of spiritual
decay — a week of deep human
concern.
Even the greatest of poets is
ultimately called to account in
moral terms. Stephane Mallarrm'
for instance, demonstrated tha*.
it is possible to be an artist of the
very highest rank and yet a stub
bornly decent peson in the
clutches.
Knowing the odds in his case,
it is moving to read his remark
about Paul Gauguin: "One hasn''
the right to abandon his chil
dren, even to found a religion."

In the late 1950s and early
19605, the department had
prominent figures such as Prof.
Kenneth Arrow. Much of the
momentum has since been lost.
In a recent survey, the depart

The department is further af

Moses Abramovitz and the de

strong publication record as

Since its inception in 1974 the
ASSU Speakers Bureau has been
funded three times by one dollar
student assessments. Its ostensi
ble purpose, as stated in the Se
nate By-Laws is to invite distin
guished, provocative speakers to
present various viewpoints in
lectures for the edification and
intellectual stimulation of the
Stanford community.
Past speakers include William
F. Buckley, John Sawhill and
Jimmy Carter, with John Kenneth
Galbraith due later this quarter.
Tuesday, April 20, 1300 stu
dents realized the use of their as
sessment dollars by attending
the lecture/performance of com
edian David Frye.
That the vast majority of the
students present enjoyed him
immensely is clear. That this
was a valid use of the Speakers
Bureau funds is not.

Frye is not a political com
mentator, as some have said; he
is a gifted impressionist of polit
ical as well as entertainment fi
gures who crudely and tas
telessly uses these impressions
to deliver ethnic, religious and
sexist slurs on these individuals.
Surely Richard Nixon urinating
on the floor, Kissinger depicted
as Hitler, and Humphrey selling
urine to the Poles are not the
things of which enlightening
lectures are made.
Not that there isn't a need for
entertainment. Thirteen
hundred students demonstrated
that.
But the Speakers Bureau
should leave that concern to
ASSU Special Events, for whose
functions admission is charged.
Student subsidization of enter
tainment violates the Speakers
Bureau mandate.

Pound: man and poet
On Pound: The poet and the
man ought not to be confused

when evaluating the poetry, I
quite agree (that distinction oc
curred in my letter). But there is
also a loose linkage in what is
known as "the Pound affair" —
Pound himself insisted on thfc
tie — and in that context 1 still
vigorously disagree with the op
position.
On the other hand, I can admit
that my characterization of his
poetry as "rather mediocre" was
inadequate. Some bias undoub'
tedly crept it.
It was — Passover and Good
Friday, in a time of spiritual
decay — a week of deep human
concern.
Even the greatest of poets is
ultimately called to account in
moral terms. Stephane Mallarrm'
for instance, demonstrated tha*.
it is possible to be an artist of the
very highest rank and yet a stub
bornly decent peson in the
clutches.
Knowing the odds in his case,
it is moving to read his remark
about Paul Gauguin: "One hasn''
the right to abandon his chil
dren, even to found a religion."

Departmental tenure deci
sions are usually the result of a
complicated and conscientious
process. Partially informed stu
dents can easily misjudge the
wisdom of such decisions.
Yet as a concerned undergrad I
would like to express my sup
port for granting tenure to Assoc.
Economics Prof. Duncan Foley.
Having taken over 50 units of
economics taught by professors
of various rank, I have been puz
zled by the poor teaching ability
in the Economics Department.
Ironically some of the most effec
tive teachers I have had were vis
iting professors.
One exception was Foley. All
professors encourage students to
ask questions. Mysteriously, lit
tle true discission goes on in
econ classes.
There are long monologues
dominated by a few students.
There are requests to repeat part
of the lecture. It may be that stu
dents are awed by their mentor's
intellectual superiority.
But in Economics 53 taught by
Foley, there are lucid lectures
and lively discussions of 10 mi
nutes or more every day. The en
thused students question and
clarify the lecture materials
through questions.
The Economics Department is
endowed with favorable pre
conditions to self-sustained
growth. Factors such as a charm
ing campus and delightful
weather, strong Mathematics
and Statistics departments, and
the nationally prominent busi
ness school and Food Research
Institute offer variable resources
and support to economic

studies.
