## Men spikers win NorCal 
### Gary Sprague 
Led by the stellar all around
performance of Tim Minor and
steady work in the middle by
Charlie Cosgrove and Bob Latta,
the Stanford men's volleyball
team defeated San Jose State Fri
day night to capture the North
ern California Collegiate Vol
leyball Championship.
Stanford won in straight
games, taking the opener, 15-13.
At 2-1 in the second game, Rob
ber Baron Andy Fishburn made a
miraculous return of a Spartan
spike, striking the ball behind
his back while squatting on the
floor. The Barons caught fire and
quickly rolled up a 7-1 lead. Al
though San Jose hung on tenaci
ously for the remainder of the
game, the efforts of Cosgrove and
Latta sent Stanford home a 15-11
victor.
Stanford coach Art Lambert
said he was delighted with the
way his team played.
'Played defense'
"We finally played some de
fense," Lambert said. "We put it
all together. You couldn't ask for
much more than that."
The key to the game, Lambert
said, was the play of Minor,
who "played superbly. He
turned the game around."
Lambert also had praise for
Cosgrove. "Charlie did a hell of a
job," the coach said, "especially
in the first game."
Cosgrove said the team's ini

tial strategy was to hit the Spar
tan middle with medium short
sets.
Strategy failed
The strategy failed early in the
first game, however, and the Ba
rons returned to their orthodox
style.
The Barons and the Spartans
had met twice earlier this year,
with each team scoring victories
on the enemy court. Senior Latta
credited the Stanford crowd of
about 200 with an assist in the
victory.
"San Jose is a real spurt team,"
Latta said. "They react to their
crowd. We had a larger crowd
than usual, and they drowned
the San Jose rooters out."
Latta said the Stanford prog
ram is strong enough to play
with the big boys down south.
'A lot better'
"If we were in the Southern
California League," Latta said,
"we'd be third or fourth in the
league. The Northern League is a
lot better than people think."
The volleyball program will
be elevated to varsity level next
year. Lambert said he expects the
change to result in more inten
sity and effort in the program.
"We have a good chance of
getting the top teams in the na
tion playing on the Maples
floor," he said.
Stanford defeated UC-Davis
15-13, 15-7, Friday afternoon, to
enter the finals.
