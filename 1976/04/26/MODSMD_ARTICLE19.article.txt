ional Championships at Oak
land.
In other races, Stanford's
four-person team took fourth
and a team of Robber Baron
Kathy Thaxton and a Santa Bar
bara rower took third in the two
person race.
Crewmen win two
The Stanford crew team won
only two of seven races this
weekend, competing against
USC and UCLA Friday at Los
Angeles Harbor and against UC-
Irvine and Orange Coast Satur
day at Newport.
The Robber Barons won the
freshman eights Friday and the
varsity eights Saturday.
Baron coach Dick Dreis
sigacker said, "The results we
ren't as good as we had hoped.
But they were somewhat better
than our past performances in

UCLA's varsity eight received
the Harbach Cup for winning its
race,- finishing five lengths
ahead of Stanford.

most of the race.

Laxmen rout Claremont
Instead of being a close con
test, the showdown between
Stanford's and Claremont Men's
undefeated lacrosse teams
turned into a laugher as Stanford
routed Claremont, 15-4, at the
Lacrosse Field here yesterday.
The Cards had already
clinched the college title of the
Northern California Lacrosse
Association (NCLA) before yes
terday's game, while Claremont
had earned the same honor in the
Southern California Lacrosse
Association.
The Cards ended any drama
the game might have early by
spurting to an 8-0 halftime lead.
As usual, Greg Hoberg headed
the Stanford attack. The Cards'
leading scorer notched four
goals and four assists on the af

ternoon. Three of his goals were
unassisted as he continually
weaved and dodged his way
around frustrated Claremont de
fensemen.
Hoberg was not the only
scorer. Joe Straton tallied three
times for the Cards, including
the niftiest goal of the day.
Breaking in at a sharp angle from
the right side, he reached back
from behind the net with his left
hand and stuffed the ball by sur
prised Claremont goalie Mike
Rorick.
Stanford also got two goals
from Whit Budge and Willie
Reid. Don Stewart, John Sprole,
Larry Wexler and Tom Tweedy
rounded out the scoring for the
Cards.
There wasn't much to cheer
about on the Claremont bench.
Comments ranged from "It's a
long day" to "We gotta get some
shots" and finally to "This is
discouraging."
It was the type of contest in
which post-game comments
started in the third quarter.
"They're good. We're being
eaten alive," moaned Claremont
coach Bill Wootton. After the
game, the veteran coach of 10
years said, "This is the best team
I've ever brought up here, and
this is the worst I've ever been
beaten."
Stanford coach Sam Sadtler
expressed pleasure with his
team's performance and espe
cially with the significance of
the victory. " With a win over Cal
next week, we'll be the
mythological college champions
of California," he said.
"And we have already qual

ified for the NCLA playoffs in
two weeks against the winners of
the other divisions in the As
sociation," Sadtler added. Those
winners are club teams from
Palo Alto, San Francisco and
North Bay.
But more immediate on his
team's schedule will be Stan
ford's own Western States Invi
tational next weekend at the Lac
rosse Field. It will have a strong
eight-team field, Sadtler said,
including clubs from San Diego,
Los Angeles and an all-star team
from Seattle.

Sailors second
A third place finish Saturday
in the Northern California Inter

(NCISA) Race No. 9 at Santa Cruz
left the Stanford sailing team in
second place in the NCISA for
the season.
"We were supposed to win the
whole thing," Robber Baron
coach Wim Steenbakkers said.
But, he recalled, a scheduling
conflict in early April forced the
team to send its best men to a
non-NCISA race while "the sec

points" in an NCISA race.
Stanford finished Va point be

Barons Alan Andrews and

Crewmen win two
The Stanford crew team won
only two of seven races this

USC and UCLA Friday at Los
Angeles Harbor and against UC-
Irvine and Orange Coast Satur
day at Newport.
The Robber Barons won the

Laxmen rout Claremont
Instead of being a close con
test, the showdown between
Stanford's and Claremont Men's
undefeated lacrosse teams
turned into a laugher as Stanford
routed Claremont, 15-4, at the
Lacrosse Field here yesterday.
The Cards had already
clinched the college title of the
Northern California Lacrosse
Association (NCLA) before yes
terday's game, while Claremont
had earned the same honor in the
Southern California Lacrosse
Association.
The Cards ended any drama
the game might have early by
spurting to an 8-0 halftime lead.
As usual, Greg Hoberg headed
the Stanford attack. The Cards'
leading scorer notched four
goals and four assists on the af

ternoon. Three of his goals were
unassisted as he continually
weaved and dodged his way
around frustrated Claremont de
fensemen.
Hoberg was not the only
scorer. Joe Straton tallied three
times for the Cards, including
the niftiest goal of the day.
Breaking in at a sharp angle from
the right side, he reached back
from behind the net with his left
hand and stuffed the ball by sur
prised Claremont goalie Mike
Rorick.
Stanford also got two goals
from Whit Budge and Willie
Reid. Don Stewart, John Sprole,
Larry Wexler and Tom Tweedy
rounded out the scoring for the
Cards.
There wasn't much to cheer
about on the Claremont bench.
Comments ranged from "It's a
long day" to "We gotta get some
shots" and finally to "This is
discouraging."
It was the type of contest in
which post-game comments
started in the third quarter.
"They're good. We're being
eaten alive," moaned Claremont
coach Bill Wootton. After the
game, the veteran coach of 10
years said, "This is the best team
I've ever brought up here, and
this is the worst I've ever been
beaten."
Stanford coach Sam Sadtler
expressed pleasure with his
team's performance and espe
cially with the significance of
the victory. " With a win over Cal
next week, we'll be the
mythological college champions
of California," he said.
"And we have already qual

ified for the NCLA playoffs in
two weeks against the winners of
the other divisions in the As
sociation," Sadtler added. Those
winners are club teams from
Palo Alto, San Francisco and
North Bay.
But more immediate on his
team's schedule will be Stan
ford's own Western States Invi
tational next weekend at the Lac
rosse Field. It will have a strong
eight-team field, Sadtler said,
including clubs from San Diego,
Los Angeles and an all-star team
from Seattle.

The Robber Barons won the

Laxmen rout Claremont
Instead of being a close con
test, the showdown between
Stanford's and Claremont Men's
undefeated lacrosse teams
turned into a laugher as Stanford
routed Claremont, 15-4, at the
Lacrosse Field here yesterday.
The Cards had already
clinched the college title of the
Northern California Lacrosse
Association (NCLA) before yes
terday's game, while Claremont
had earned the same honor in the
Southern California Lacrosse
Association.
The Cards ended any drama
the game might have early by
spurting to an 8-0 halftime lead.
As usual, Greg Hoberg headed
the Stanford attack. The Cards'
leading scorer notched four
goals and four assists on the af

ternoon. Three of his goals were
unassisted as he continually
weaved and dodged his way
around frustrated Claremont de
fensemen.
Hoberg was not the only
scorer. Joe Straton tallied three
times for the Cards, including
the niftiest goal of the day.
Breaking in at a sharp angle from
the right side, he reached back
from behind the net with his left
hand and stuffed the ball by sur
prised Claremont goalie Mike
Rorick.
Stanford also got two goals
from Whit Budge and Willie
Reid. Don Stewart, John Sprole,
Larry Wexler and Tom Tweedy
rounded out the scoring for the
Cards.
There wasn't much to cheer
about on the Claremont bench.
Comments ranged from "It's a
long day" to "We gotta get some
shots" and finally to "This is
discouraging."
It was the type of contest in
which post-game comments
started in the third quarter.
"They're good. We're being
eaten alive," moaned Claremont
coach Bill Wootton. After the
game, the veteran coach of 10
years said, "This is the best team
I've ever brought up here, and
this is the worst I've ever been
beaten."
Stanford coach Sam Sadtler
expressed pleasure with his
