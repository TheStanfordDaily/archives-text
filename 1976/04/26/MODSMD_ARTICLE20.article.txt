# Bruin nine takes 2 of 3
## UCLA frustrates Cards 
### Daniel John Pyne 
A late afternoon sun streaks
across Sunken Diamond and the
remnants of a Saturday after
noon baseball crowd watches
somewhat vacantly as Stanford
first baseman Tom Guardino
steps to the plate and faces the
final pitch of an unsuccessful
Cardinal home series with
UCLA.
Stanford's Larry Reynolds
leads off second and Bruin
pitcher Ed Cowan goes into the
stretch.
Guardino takes but one prac
tice swing. Cowan delivers.
Guardino sends a hard ground
ball to Raymond Townsend, the
Bruin shortstop.
He fields the ball and fires to
first. The throw is off, but the
Bruin first baseman nabs it and
tags Guardino on the back,
The three game series could
have propelled Stanford into
first place in the California Inter
collegiate Baseball Association
(CIBA).
Dissolved visions
The Cardinals battered the
Bruins Friday for a 13-9 win, but
visions of a doubleheader sweep
the next day dissolved in a disas
trous first inning in Saturday's
opener, and the Cards dropped
the twin bill, 8-7 and 5-3.
Friday's game was a blatant

display of indefatigable hitting
(or a sorrowful exhibition of
pitching) as the two teams com
bined for 14 runs in the first
three innings.
It was also, however, an im
pressive display of Stanford's
tenacity. Twice the Cards fell
behind UCLA, and twice rallied
to take the lead.
Stanford coach Ray Young
gave freshman Bruce Fiala the
nod for the mound, but the
righthander could find neither
control nor power and left the
game in the second inning after
yielding six runs.
Versatile
Fiala's replacement was —
somewhat surprisingly — Mike
Codiroli, who has seen more ac
tion in the outfield and as a de
signated hitter this season than
on the mound. The versatile
southpaw pitched creditably for
six innings, allowing only three
runs and notching his second
win of the season.
Young explained he went
with Codoroli because, "Mike
was simply the only lefthander
we had. jerry Argust and Yandle
are both out with sore arms, and
there wasn't anyone else we
could go with.
"It was a gamble," Young ad
mitted, "but it worked out.
Mike is a pitcher; we just ha

ven't had the chance to use him
much this year."
The Card batters laced UCLA
started Tim O'Neill for 10 hits in
the first two innings, and drove
him to the showers with a five
run third inning that put the
Cards in the lead.
Led attack
Reynolds led the Card attack
with three RBIs on a double and
a triple.
Guardino hit his 10th home
run of the season, a towering
shot to left field, to lead off the
fourth.
Saturday the pitching prob
lems remained. Starter Rob
Irwin left the opener after only a
third of an inning, five runs
down.
The Cards came back, scoring
two runs in the fifth when Randy
Wong singled to center with the
bases loaded and two more in
seventh when Kevin Triggs sing
led with loaded bases and Bruce
Walters walked.
Three runs
Down 8-4 with two outs in the
ninth, the Cards came up with
three runs on singles by
Codiroli, Rusty Duquette,
Reynolds and a Pepe Hinojosa
double, but the tying run re
mained on third as Gary Pitch
ford grounded out to end the in
ning.
The nightcap exhibited
stronger pitching, as Cardinal
ace Brian Harrison held the
Bruins to two runs for seven in
nings. Stanford scored first!
when Walters singled in Steve
Davis in the fourth.
Walters singled in another run
in the sixth, giving the Cards a
seemingly safe 3-1 lead. But with
one out in the eighth, Bruin right
fielder Dave Baker put a line shot
over the right field fence with
one man on base to tie the score.
Mike Williamson came in to
relieve Harrison, but gave up
two more runs — one in the
eighth and another in the ninth
on a passed ball.
FortheCards, nowB-7 inCIBA
play, it was a frustrating
weekend which left them where
they started — in third place.
Young acknowledged that his
team played well but that, all
things considered, "UCLA is in
the driver's seat now."

HANDY RANDY—Outfielder Randy Wong helped pace the Stan
ford attack in three baseball games against UCLA this weekend.
Above, Wong gloves a line drive.
A late afternoon sun streaks
across Sunken Diamond and the
remnants of a Saturday after
noon baseball crowd watches
somewhat vacantly as Stanford
first baseman Tom Guardino
steps to the plate and faces the
final pitch of an unsuccessful
Cardinal home series with
UCLA.
Stanford's Larry Reynolds
leads off second and Bruin
pitcher Ed Cowan goes into the
stretch.
Guardino takes but one prac
tice swing. Cowan delivers.
Guardino sends a hard ground
ball to Raymond Townsend, the
Bruin shortstop.
He fields the ball and fires to

Bruin first baseman nabs it and

The three game series could
have propelled Stanford into
first place in the California Inter
collegiate Baseball Association
(CIBA).
Dissolved visions
The Cardinals battered the
Bruins Friday for a 13-9 win, but
visions of a doubleheader sweep
the next day dissolved in a disas
trous first inning in Saturday's
opener, and the Cards dropped
the twin bill, 8-7 and 5-3.
Friday's game was a blatant

display of indefatigable hitting
(or a sorrowful exhibition of
pitching) as the two teams com
bined for 14 runs in the first
three innings.
It was also, however, an im
pressive display of Stanford's
tenacity. Twice the Cards fell
behind UCLA, and twice rallied
to take the lead.
Stanford coach Ray Young
gave freshman Bruce Fiala the
nod for the mound, but the
righthander could find neither
control nor power and left the
game in the second inning after
yielding six runs.
Versatile
Fiala's replacement was —
somewhat surprisingly — Mike
Codiroli, who has seen more ac
tion in the outfield and as a de
signated hitter this season than
on the mound. The versatile
southpaw pitched creditably for
six innings, allowing only three
runs and notching his second
win of the season.
Young explained he went
with Codoroli because, "Mike
was simply the only lefthander
we had. jerry Argust and Yandle
are both out with sore arms, and
there wasn't anyone else we
could go with.
"It was a gamble," Young ad
mitted, "but it worked out.
Mike is a pitcher; we just ha

ven't had the chance to use him
much this year."
The Card batters laced UCLA
started Tim O'Neill for 10 hits in
the first two innings, and drove
him to the showers with a five
run third inning that put the
Cards in the lead.
Led attack
Reynolds led the Card attack
with three RBIs on a double and
a triple.
Guardino hit his 10th home
run of the season, a towering
shot to left field, to lead off the
fourth.
Saturday the pitching prob
lems remained. Starter Rob
Irwin left the opener after only a
third of an inning, five runs
down.
The Cards came back, scoring
two runs in the fifth when Randy
Wong singled to center with the
bases loaded and two more in
seventh when Kevin Triggs sing
led with loaded bases and Bruce
Walters walked.
Three runs
Down 8-4 with two outs in the
ninth, the Cards came up with
three runs on singles by
Codiroli, Rusty Duquette,
Reynolds and a Pepe Hinojosa
double, but the tying run re
mained on third as Gary Pitch
ford grounded out to end the in
ning.
The nightcap exhibited
stronger pitching, as Cardinal
ace Brian Harrison held the
Bruins to two runs for seven in
nings. Stanford scored first!
when Walters singled in Steve
Davis in the fourth.
Walters singled in another run
in the sixth, giving the Cards a
seemingly safe 3-1 lead. But with
one out in the eighth, Bruin right
fielder Dave Baker put a line shot
over the right field fence with
one man on base to tie the score.
Mike Williamson came in to
relieve Harrison, but gave up
two more runs — one in the
eighth and another in the ninth
on a passed ball.
FortheCards, nowB-7 inCIBA
play, it was a frustrating
weekend which left them where
they started — in third place.
Young acknowledged that his
team played well but that, all
things considered, "UCLA is in
the driver's seat now."

HANDY RANDY—Outfielder Randy Wong helped pace the Stan
ford attack in three baseball games against UCLA this weekend.
Above, Wong gloves a line drive.
A late afternoon sun streaks
across Sunken Diamond and the
remnants of a Saturday after
noon baseball crowd watches
somewhat vacantly as Stanford
first baseman Tom Guardino
steps to the plate and faces the
final pitch of an unsuccessful
Cardinal home series with
UCLA.
Stanford's Larry Reynolds
leads off second and Bruin
pitcher Ed Cowan goes into the
stretch.
Guardino takes but one prac
tice swing. Cowan delivers.
Guardino sends a hard ground
ball to Raymond Townsend, the
Bruin shortstop.
He fields the ball and fires to
first. The throw is off, but the
Bruin first baseman nabs it and
tags Guardino on the back,
The three game series could
have propelled Stanford into
first place in the California Inter
collegiate Baseball Association
(CIBA).
Dissolved visions
The Cardinals battered the
Bruins Friday for a 13-9 win, but
visions of a doubleheader sweep
the next day dissolved in a disas
trous first inning in Saturday's
opener, and the Cards dropped
the twin bill, 8-7 and 5-3.
Friday's game was a blatant

display of indefatigable hitting
(or a sorrowful exhibition of
pitching) as the two teams com
bined for 14 runs in the first
three innings.
It was also, however, an im
pressive display of Stanford's
tenacity. Twice the Cards fell
behind UCLA, and twice rallied
to take the lead.
Stanford coach Ray Young
gave freshman Bruce Fiala the
nod for the mound, but the
righthander could find neither
control nor power and left the
game in the second inning after
yielding six runs.
Versatile
Fiala's replacement was —
somewhat surprisingly — Mike
Codiroli, who has seen more ac
tion in the outfield and as a de
signated hitter this season than
on the mound. The versatile
southpaw pitched creditably for
six innings, allowing only three
runs and notching his second
win of the season.
Young explained he went
with Codoroli because, "Mike
was simply the only lefthander
we had. jerry Argust and Yandle
are both out with sore arms, and
there wasn't anyone else we
could go with.
"It was a gamble," Young ad
mitted, "but it worked out.
Mike is a pitcher; we just ha

ven't had the chance to use him
much this year."
The Card batters laced UCLA
started Tim O'Neill for 10 hits in
the first two innings, and drove
him to the showers with a five
run third inning that put the
Cards in the lead.
Led attack
Reynolds led the Card attack
with three RBIs on a double and
a triple.
Guardino hit his 10th home
run of the season, a towering
shot to left field, to lead off the
fourth.
Saturday the pitching prob
lems remained. Starter Rob
Irwin left the opener after only a
third of an inning, five runs
down.
The Cards came back, scoring
two runs in the fifth when Randy
Wong singled to center with the
bases loaded and two more in
seventh when Kevin Triggs sing
led with loaded bases and Bruce
Walters walked.
Three runs
Down 8-4 with two outs in the
ninth, the Cards came up with
three runs on singles by
Codiroli, Rusty Duquette,
Reynolds and a Pepe Hinojosa
double, but the tying run re
mained on third as Gary Pitch
ford grounded out to end the in
ning.
The nightcap exhibited
stronger pitching, as Cardinal
ace Brian Harrison held the
Bruins to two runs for seven in
nings. Stanford scored first!
when Walters singled in Steve
Davis in the fourth.
Walters singled in another run
in the sixth, giving the Cards a
seemingly safe 3-1 lead. But with
one out in the eighth, Bruin right
fielder Dave Baker put a line shot
over the right field fence with
one man on base to tie the score.
Mike Williamson came in to
relieve Harrison, but gave up
two more runs — one in the
eighth and another in the ninth
on a passed ball.
FortheCards, nowB-7 inCIBA
play, it was a frustrating
weekend which left them where
they started — in third place.
Young acknowledged that his
team played well but that, all
things considered, "UCLA is in
the driver's seat now."
