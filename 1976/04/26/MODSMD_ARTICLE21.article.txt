# Peck takes first in golf tourney
## 
### Chris Kamel 
Last year, Mike Peck was a
freshman whom Stanford golf
coach Bud Finger termed "one of
the best prospects in Stanford
golf history." He started on Stan
ford's varsity golf team but was
overshadowed by seniors Dave
Baskins and Aly Trompas.
Well, Baskins and Trompas
have graduated, and Peck started
to prove Finger's earlier prog
nosis this weekend as he won the
Stanford U.S. Collegiate Invita
tional Tourney at the Stanford
Golf Course.
The way he won it, however,
still has people talking about it.
Peck turned in a 54 hole total
of 212, tying the 1971 mark set
by Card Tom Watson, now on the
pro tour.
'Only a sophomore'
"The thing is that Mike is only
a sophomore," explained
Finger, "while Watson was a
senior when he set the record.
So, Mike can very accurately be
compared to Watson."
How did Peck suddenly come
into his own? According to
Finger, Peck is one of the longest
hitters in the world but has
worked on his short game the
last two weeks.
"1 realized that it's the chip
ping and putting that wins tour

naments," Peck said, "so I
worked on that and it paid off."
Peck's total was two strokes
ahead of San Jose State's Scott
Hoyt, who finished at 214.
Even though Peck won the bat
tle, Stanford didn't win the war,
however. Despite Peck's show
ing, the Cards saw a five shot
lead after Thursday's opening
round turn into a second place
finish after Saturday's final
round.
The Cards were nine strokes
behind San Jose State's 870. The
Spartan's total beat Stanford's
1970 tournament record of 872.
'Super golf
"We played super golf for a
young team," said Finger, "but
our team effort fell a little short."
The surprise of the tourna
ment came when Stanford JV
members Mark Mcßride and
Kim Cater finished ahead of the
five remaining varsity members.
Mcßride shot 219, tying him
for fifth while Cater was one
shot back at 220. The Stanford JV
finished fourth with a team total
of 896.
"Mcßride and Cater seern to
have the hot hand right now and
will be making the trip to
(Arizona's) McCormick Ranch
for the Sun Devil Tournament
this weekend," Finger said.
Clenn Goethals' 221, Jay
Johnston's 223 and Bruce
McDonald's 225 rounded out the
four-man scoring team. Goethals
finished 12th as he made a
strong comeback in the last
round, shooting two under par
for the back nine holes of the
course.
Johnston, on the other hand,
was tied for the lead after the first
round, at 69, but shot a 79 the
next day.
