A potential third-place finish
for the Stanford women's golf
team in the Sun Devil Invita
tional at Phoenix disappeared
Friday when the Cards' Pam
Palmieri was disqualified dur
ing the second round after play
ing another golfer's ball.
Tulsa won the two day tour
nament with a team total of 617.
Stanford was listed fifth with a
677. Had Palmieri's score of 158
been allowed, the Cards would
have finished with a 646, good
enough for a third place tie with
the University of Arizona.
Arizona State finished second
with 625.
Individually, Stanford's Pat
Cornett rallied with a four-under
par 70 on Friday to finish second

at 147.
Palmieri's disqualification oc
curred when, after having
checked both the brand and
number, she played the ball of
Tulsa's Brenda Moyers on her
second shot at the 10th hole.
The confusion resulted be
cause, two holes earlier, Moyers
failed to inform Palmieri that she
had dropped a new ball. The
new ball was the same make as
the ball Palmieri had been play
ing since the opening of the
round.
"Teamwise, everybody was a
little upset," said Palmieri.
"That thing cost our team 31
strokes."
Said Cornett, "1 think Pam re
ally got ripped on it. It was abso
lutely not her fault at all."

Cornett, who had shot a 77 on
Thursday, said, "I was really en
couraged by Friday's round."
She added, "Everybody choked
on Friday. Their scores went sky
high."
In evaluating the team's per
formance, Cornett said, "We
were happy because we would
have finished third. Our first
three scores were comparable to
those of Tulsa and ASU. We beat
all the teams we were supposed
to beat."
When she returned to Stan
ford, Coriiett recalled the flat de
sert course was "a totally diffe
rent course than what we've
been used to. People who
wouldn't outdrive us up here
outdrove us down there."
