Campaign money decision due
WASHINGTON — Congress returns from a
10-day Easter recess today facing decisions on fed
eral spending, foreign aid and a bill to get federal
campaign money flowing again to the presidential
candidates.
The last of the major intelligence reports — on
domestic intelligence operations — is to be re
leased late today by the Senate intelligence com
mittee.
Advance word is that the report will disclose the
181 had a network of informants in news organiza
tions, universities and charitable organizations but
won't name names.
Presidential candidates' federal campaign
money has been cut off for more than a month now,
awaiting congressional action. They have piled
up applications for more than $2.5 million.
Congress is likely to complete action this week
on a Supreme Court-ordered reorganization of the
Federal Election Commission to clear the way for
renewing the federal campaign money.
But President Ford has not declared himself on
reports that he may veto that bill.
And if he signs it he must nominate new commis
sion members, and the Senate must confirm them,
before the commission will be able to resume the
campaign money to the candidates.
Candidates charge Ford with delay
PI lILAUELPHIA — Two Democratic presidential
candidates said yesterday that President Ford
wants to delay the revival of federal campaign sub
sidies because he doesn't need the money for his
own Republican race.
Sen. Henry Jackson of Washington said Ford had
the most money but "doesn't want Ronald Reagan
to get his matching funds." Rep. Morris Udall of
Arizona accused Ford of "aiding and abetting" the
delay of legislation and urged him to promise to
sign the bill so candidates could borrow money in
anticipation of a revival.
But Jimmy Carter said Congress was at fault and
predicted that the aid probably won't be restored
before the primary elections are over.
Carter, Jackson, Udall, Alabama Gov. George
Wallace and Sen. Frank Church of Idaho spent an
hour answering questions on a nationally televised

interview program.
Portugal holds parliament elections
LISBON — Portugal held its first free parliamen
tary election in 51 years yesterday with none of the
14 political parties on the ballot expected to win a
majority.
The nation's armed forces were on full alert, with
6.5 million persons eligible to vote, and the entire
country was reported calm.
Polls closed at 7 p.m.,but the counting of millions
of paper ballots was expected to delay the indica
tion of trends until today.
Pre-election studies suggested the Socialists
would lead but would fall short of enough votes to
form a government by themselves.
Observers expected that at best the election
would result in a center-left coalition. They said
agreement between parties that woidd form such an
alliance would be difficult because of the leftover
bitterness from a violent 18-day election campaign.
The Socialists have rejected the idea of a coalition
with the Communists.
Schools closed over race conflict
EUDORA, Ark. — What began 10 days ago as an
ice-cream-parlor argument between a black boy and
white girl has erupted into a major racial conflict in
this Mississippi delta hamlet.
A dusk-to-dawn curfew was slapped on Eudora
and its 3700 residents after 100 of the community's
375 high school students were involved in a fist
swinging, rock-throwing melee last week at the
school.
And officials have ordered the high school and
Eudora's other public school — a combined
elementary-junior high school — shut down for the
rest of the academic year because of racial distur
bances.
The board said the action was necessary because
of continued unrest and tension, the uncertainty of
adequate staffing and the withdrawal of students
from the schools.
Four dead in robbery, kidnap spree
JACKSON, Ga. — Apparently angered over a
drug deal, an ex-convict went on a two-state rob
bery and kidnap spree, killed three people and
wounded 13 others before killing himself, au
thorities said.

The outburst began in Jacksonville, Fla., and left
a bloody path up Interstate Highway 75 through
central Georgia. It ended here Sunday when 31-
year-old Moses Pearson of Jacksonville, sur
rounded by deputies in a car he had commandeered
and wrecked, turned one of his four pistols on him
self, authorities said.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Lows in upper 30s and
40s. Highs in mid 60s to low 70s. Northwesterly
winds 12 to 25 mph, decreasing late today.

Candidates charge Ford with delay
PI lILAUELPHIA — Two Democratic presidential
candidates said yesterday that President Ford
wants to delay the revival of federal campaign sub
sidies because he doesn't need the money for his
own Republican race.
Sen. Henry Jackson of Washington said Ford had
the most money but "doesn't want Ronald Reagan
to get his matching funds." Rep. Morris Udall of
Arizona accused Ford of "aiding and abetting" the
delay of legislation and urged him to promise to
sign the bill so candidates could borrow money in
anticipation of a revival.
But Jimmy Carter said Congress was at fault and
predicted that the aid probably won't be restored
before the primary elections are over.
Carter, Jackson, Udall, Alabama Gov. George
Wallace and Sen. Frank Church of Idaho spent an
hour answering questions on a nationally televised

interview program.
Portugal holds parliament elections
LISBON — Portugal held its first free parliamen
tary election in 51 years yesterday with none of the
14 political parties on the ballot expected to win a
majority.
The nation's armed forces were on full alert, with
6.5 million persons eligible to vote, and the entire
country was reported calm.
Polls closed at 7 p.m.,but the counting of millions
of paper ballots was expected to delay the indica
tion of trends until today.
Pre-election studies suggested the Socialists
would lead but would fall short of enough votes to
form a government by themselves.
Observers expected that at best the election
would result in a center-left coalition. They said
agreement between parties that woidd form such an
alliance would be difficult because of the leftover
bitterness from a violent 18-day election campaign.
The Socialists have rejected the idea of a coalition
with the Communists.
Schools closed over race conflict
EUDORA, Ark. — What began 10 days ago as an
ice-cream-parlor argument between a black boy and
white girl has erupted into a major racial conflict in
this Mississippi delta hamlet.
A dusk-to-dawn curfew was slapped on Eudora
and its 3700 residents after 100 of the community's
375 high school students were involved in a fist
swinging, rock-throwing melee last week at the
school.
And officials have ordered the high school and
Eudora's other public school — a combined
elementary-junior high school — shut down for the
rest of the academic year because of racial distur
bances.
The board said the action was necessary because
of continued unrest and tension, the uncertainty of
adequate staffing and the withdrawal of students
from the schools.
Four dead in robbery, kidnap spree
JACKSON, Ga. — Apparently angered over a
drug deal, an ex-convict went on a two-state rob
bery and kidnap spree, killed three people and
wounded 13 others before killing himself, au
thorities said.

The outburst began in Jacksonville, Fla., and left
a bloody path up Interstate Highway 75 through
central Georgia. It ended here Sunday when 31-
year-old Moses Pearson of Jacksonville, sur
rounded by deputies in a car he had commandeered
and wrecked, turned one of his four pistols on him
self, authorities said.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Lows in upper 30s and
40s. Highs in mid 60s to low 70s. Northwesterly
winds 12 to 25 mph, decreasing late today.
Campaign money decision due
WASHINGTON — Congress returns from a
10-day Easter recess today facing decisions on fed
eral spending, foreign aid and a bill to get federal
campaign money flowing again to the presidential
candidates.
The last of the major intelligence reports — on
domestic intelligence operations — is to be re
leased late today by the Senate intelligence com
mittee.
Advance word is that the report will disclose the
181 had a network of informants in news organiza
tions, universities and charitable organizations but
won't name names.
Presidential candidates' federal campaign
money has been cut off for more than a month now,
awaiting congressional action. They have piled
up applications for more than $2.5 million.
Congress is likely to complete action this week
on a Supreme Court-ordered reorganization of the
Federal Election Commission to clear the way for
renewing the federal campaign money.
But President Ford has not declared himself on
reports that he may veto that bill.
And if he signs it he must nominate new commis
sion members, and the Senate must confirm them,
