# Udall man predicts:
## 'Carter will stumble' 
### Neal Burstein 
Rep. George Brown (D-Monterey
Park) predicted in a meeting with
campaign organizers in San Mateo that
Rep. Morris Udall's (D-Ariz.) rivals,
former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Garter and
Sen. Henry Jackson (D-VVash.) will be
disappointed in Northern state
primaries yet to come.
Brown said the Democratic nomina
tion will not be decided by early
primaries and predicted Udall "will go
to the Democratic convention with a
solid block of votes."
"1 see Garter running against the
stumbling block of trying to win in the
industrial states," Brown said, adding
that Jackson "is not someone people
can empathize with."
Assessing the Udall campaign,
Brown said "more people have to be
exposed to him" in the coming
months, but that the Arizona Democrat
"is trying hard and making it" in
primaries across the country, pointing
to Udall's second-place finish in Wis
consin.
Brown said Udall is hoping tomor
row's Pennsylvania primary will be a
slingshot for him.
"The media still perceive Mo as a
second or third place man," Brown
said.
Udall's political philosophy is
"progressive" rather than liberal, ac
cording to Brown. "A liberal emerges
five years after an issue is popular," he
explained, saying Udall was active in
environmental issues before they be
came popular.
He pointed out that self-styled "lib
erals," such as Sargent Shriver and
former Oklahoma Sen. Fred Harris,
have already dropped out of the presi
dential race.
Udall "has gone further than he has
to go" to talk about issues in his cam
paign, Brown said. He said this was
evidenced by the candidate's proposal

to break up certain large oil firms.
"Anyone can come out with an
anti-monopoly statement without
naming names," Brown said.
Brown characterized a possible
Ford-Humphrey contest this fall as one
stripped of many issues, saying that
Humphrey and Ford were elected to
Congress about the same time and
"each knows how the other thinks."
Brown said the block of delegates
committed to Gov. Edmund Brown is
made up of "the type who would turn
to Udall" in case of a brokered conven
tion in New York this summer.
Brown, a former mayor of Monterey
Park, served in Congress from 1962 to
1970, when he was defeated by John
Tunney, and returned to his seat in
1972, when Tunney ran for the U.S.
Senate.
