# Fulbright scholars suggest less emphasis on research

### Sharyl Van Winkle 
The Fulbright-Hays scholarship
program should put less emphasis on
research and more emphasis on cul
tural exchange, a regional conference
of 200 former Fulbright scholars con
cluded here on Friday.
The conference was held to suggest
new directions for the 30 year old fed
eral program, which has allowed
41,000 Americans to teach and study
in foreign countries and 78,000
foreigners to come here for the same
purpose.
People who "bury themselves in re
search laboratories" should be fi
nanced by other programs, Assoc.Dean
of Earth Sciences Konrad Krauskopf
said during the conference.
Other conference participants re
commended more stringent language
requirements and clearer goals for
Fulbright scholars. Some complained

that many Fulbrighters treated their
experience as a vacation in Europe.
"An excellent engineer without a
social conscience is worthless," Mexi
can Ambassador to Norway Eduardo
Jimenez-Gonzalez said. He felt that
scholars returning to their countries
after a stay in the United States should
"not go back to reinforce the unjust
situation that already exists," using
the technical expertise they have
gained, but go back with an under
standing of the American democratic
system.
'Neointerventionism'
Several participants expressed con
cern that the Fulbright program fosters
"neointerventionism." Communica
tion Department Chairman Lyle Nel
son criticized the fact that most foreig
ners come to the United States to re
search and learn, while most Ameri
cans go to teach and tell.

"It's a presumption on our part that
we have the answers." he said. He felt
there should be more foreign lecturers,
and that they should spend part of
their time in places which are not cen
ters of research, such as "Nebraska
and lowa."
This, he hoped, would help create a
much-needed interest in and under
standing of international affairs

among Americans. As International
Studies Prof. Robert Ward pointed out,
only three percent of college under
graduates are taking courses which
deal primarily with international af
fairs or culture, and barely five percent
of future primary and secondary
teachers have any international
studies training.
This week three former Fulbright
scholars who spoke at the conference
will be guests-in-residence at dor
mitories here. Jimenez-Gonzalez will
be at Casa Zapata and a scholar-in
residence at Bolivar House. Austrian
newspaper editor Dr. Hubert
Feichtlbauer is at Branner Hall. Dr.
Kihei Koizumi of the Japanese Na
tional Institute for Educational Re
search is at Larkin. All will beat sherry
hours at their residences tonight, and
will attend a dinner at Hammerskjold
House Tuesday.
