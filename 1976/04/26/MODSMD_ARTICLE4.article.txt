# Grads must draw for housing, too
## 
### Ann Amioka 
Undergraduates wishing to live on
campus are not alone in having to go
through the worries and uncertainties
of a housing draw. Single graduate
students and married students attend
ing the University without spouses or
children must go through a similar
process if they want to live on campus
â€” and have lower chances of being
assigned a place than undergraduates.
There are 723 spaces in the graduate
student housing draw, according to
Carolyn Conn, a housing office assis
tant who deals with single graduate
student assignments for on-campus
residences.
Of these spaces, 142 are in Crothers

Hall, 213 in Crothers Memorial Hall
(Cro Mem), 54 in Mirrielees House and
254 in McFarland, Hulme and
Blackwelder. the Escondido Village
high rise apartments.
In fall 1975, 40 percent of the single
graduate students who applied re
ceived on-campus housing, Conn said.
In contrast, 79 percent of the under
graduates requesting on-campus hous
ing received such an assignment at the
end of round two in the 1975 spring
draw, she said.
Conn pointed out, however, that the
figures change each quarter because
more spaces become available during
the year as more people drop out of the
housing system.

The procedure for the single
graduate students' housing draw is
slightly different from the process for
undergraduates. The graduate stu
dents submit applications for housing
and are assigned to places on a waiting
list according to a random draw made
by the housing office, Conn said.
This year's draw will be held on June
1. Applications received after May 31
will be put on the waiting list accord
ing to the date of the application, Conn
said.
Although the pamphlet on graduate
housing assignment policies and pro
cedures for 1976-77 says that the draw
will be done by computer, Conn said
the draw will probably be done by
hand. She noted that the draw would
be "simpler (that way) just because
there are fewer people to deal with
(than in the undergraduate draw)."
Computer draw
There has been talk of going to a
computer draw this fall, Conn said, but
the office "probably will not" because
"we don't really need it."
Single graduate students living in
University housing during spring
quarter can claim a stronger residence
priority than undergraduates, Conn
noted. If the graduate student signs a
residence agreement by a given date
(May 10 this year), the student is
guaranteed the same place the follow
ing fall, she said.
Law students receive priority for
Crothers and engineering students re
ceive priority for Cro Mem because
those conditions were outlined in the
bequest of Judge Ceorge Crothers (Law
School Class of' 96), whose family pro
vided the funds for both halls.
The general policy of placing un
dergraduates in undergraduate hous
ing and graduate students in graduate
student housing "seems to work the
best," said Conn.
Special cases
However, exceptions are made for
special cases, she said. For example, a
25-year-old undergraduate might not
be assigned to undergraduate housing
because the student "wouldn't feel

comfortable," Conn said.
This quarter, a number of graduate
students, "all special cases," are living
in Manzanita Park, said Conn. There
are also undergraduates living in
Crothers and Cro Mem, she said.
Students desiring "special consid
eration for housing" may petition for
it. Conn said.
Co-terminal students who have
applied for graduation are not eligible
for undergraduate housing but may
apply for graduate student housing,
she said.
