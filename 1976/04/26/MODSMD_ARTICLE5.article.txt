Many undergraduates' most
cherished rite of spring was car
ried out last week in the Music
Listening Room at Tresidder Un
ion,as freshmen,sophomores and
juniors joined in the Spring Hous
ing Draw.
Contestants in the draw re
ceived, appropriately enough, dif
ferent varieties of suckers for their
efforts at pulling the lowest
number possible out of a box of
5000 tags.
Last week's draw was forßound
One of the housing competition,
and results including preliminary
housing assignments and cut-off
numbers for students without
guarantees under the new Guaran
teed Housing Program are due
May 11.
Following notification ofßound
Oneresults, students are eligible
to compete in Round Two,which
will give students a chance to
change their Round One assign
ments. Students satisfied with
their Round One assignments are
allowed to keep them.
Graduate students, whose de
mand for on-campus housing is
lighter, participate in a different
kind of draw this June (see story
this page).
