### Associated Press 
DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania â€”Sec-
retary of State Henry Kissinger, on a
seven-nation African tour, said yester
day the United States "does not plan to
give military aid in any form to the
nationalist movements in Africa."
But he said the Ford administration
will use its economic and political in
fluence to bring about black majority
rule in southern Africa.
Kissinger spoke in Nairobi, Kenya,
before leaving for Tanzania and talks
with President Julius Nyerere.
The question of arms aid follows the
recent defeat of two pro-Western fac
tions by a pro-Soviet group in the An
golan civil war.
A senior American official, asked
what Washington would do if another
Angolan situation developed, said he
could not now see any possibility of
giving military support toblack libera
tion groups trying to topple the
white-minority regimes in Rhodesia
and South Africa.
Black nationalist guerrillas waging
hit-and-run border warfare are scoring
mounting successes in their attempts.
Operating from safe havens in
black-ruled nations that have replaced
colonial governments, they are gradu

ally intensifying their attacks amid
growing fears that the southern part of
the continent may he heading for hitter
race wars.
Rhodesia's 270,000 whites are defy
ing African and world demands for
majority rule for the nation's 5.7 mill
ion hlacks.
On leaving Kenya, the first stop on
his tour, Kissinger said the United
States wants non-African powers to
stay out of the conflict over majority
rule in southern Africa.
Following talks with Kenyan Presi
dent Jomo Kenyatta, Kissinger told re
porters:
"We do not believe that it is helpful
for outside powers to inject themselves
because that could only lead to the di
vision of Africa." He did not mention
directly Soviet and Cuban involve
ment in Angola.
Reports circulated in Africa, how
ever. that the Ford administration is
considering the posibility of at least
indirect arms aid.
Recently. Soviet-armed guerrillas
slipping into Rhodesia across the
800-mile border with Mozambique
have demonstrated they could strike
deep inside the country.
In Easter weekend operations, they
blasted three locomotives and a string
of wagons off the strategic Rhodesia-
South Africa rail line. Three South Af
rican tourists were shot and killed on
the main highway to South Africa. La
ter, a Rhodesian soldier and a police
man guarding an isolated white farm
were killed. In the same period only
two guerrilla deaths were reported al
though total guerrilla casualties are
still far in excess of those of Rhodesian
forces.
President Ford, Kissinger and other
administration officials have
threatened to take broad action should
the Soviet Union use Cuban forces to
foment strife in Africa. They have not
said specifically what the action
would be.
An estimated 12,000 Cuban troops
spearheaded the successful offensive
by Angola's Moscow-backed Popular
Movement.
