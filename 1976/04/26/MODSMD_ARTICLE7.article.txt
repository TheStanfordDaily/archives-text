# Irresponsible journalism

Rick Fearon's obviously partisan concoction of
misinformation on the Daily opinions page April
20 strikes me as the height of irresponsibility.
Fearon—a Daily opinions editor, note—
claimed to be attacking student politics in gen
eral, but spent most of his time in unjustified and
unprovable attacks on the Council of Presidents
(COP) slate headed by Dan Howard.
The Daily editor had previously forbidden any
editor to write personal letters of endorsement.
By writing and then running his vicious col
umn the day before the election—thus eliminat
ing any chance of reply—Fearon exhibited pre
judice, stupidity and gross irresponsibility.
Some samples of Fearon's unsupported allega
tions:
—the Howard platform was nothing near 40
pages. Had Fearon bothered to try to read it, he
would have seen it was 20 pages of narrow mar
gins when presented to the Daily: the same text
took only eight pages, photo-reduced, as distri
buted.
—his assertion that "few of the proposals of the
average COP slate have a direct bearing on any
student" further demonstrates a sort of political
ignorance. As in national politics, every proposal
affects everyone, although to varying degrees.
Students such as Fearon have a responsibility to
determine which proposals will best affect them
— and then to vote. Otherwise, they have abso
lutely no basis for complaint about any COP's

performance.
—his "right blend of token everythings" line
smacks of mere racism — or else lack of sensitiv
ity. The fact that a slate includes one person from
Stanford's many minority groups, one woman,
who is also the only graduate student, does not
mean any member is a token. Possibly — although
this would damage Fearon's analysis — just pos
sibly women and black people can be capable, too.
—the so-called "Howard Report" was not
poorly received by all outside of Columbae. In
fact, it is not clear why members of Columbae
house should have cared as much as members of,
say, Zapata or Ujamaa — it was on minority ad
missions.
Fearon's attempt to "balance" his column by a
few jibes at the Petroff slate should have been left
out — it was so poorly explained, that the rest of
the column almost made sense by comparison.
Fearon may honestly believe that student poli
tics are a joke. If that is indeed the case, he should
quit trying to campaign for a particular slate.
Moreover, if he must criticize politicians, he
should at least put some thought and work into
his critiques.
This column will appear, of course, too late to
influence the outcome of the election — that is, to
counterbalance Fearon's partisan assault. But it
will hopefully make Daily editors think a little bit.

ignorance. As in national politics, every proposal
affects everyone, although to varying degrees.
Students such as Fearon have a responsibility to
determine which proposals will best affect them
— and then to vote. Otherwise, they have abso
lutely no basis for complaint about any COP's

performance.
—his "right blend of token everythings" line
smacks of mere racism — or else lack of sensitiv
ity. The fact that a slate includes one person from
Stanford's many minority groups, one woman,
who is also the only graduate student, does not
mean any member is a token. Possibly — although
this would damage Fearon's analysis — just pos
sibly women and black people can be capable, too.
—the so-called "Howard Report" was not
poorly received by all outside of Columbae. In
fact, it is not clear why members of Columbae
house should have cared as much as members of,
say, Zapata or Ujamaa — it was on minority ad
missions.
Fearon's attempt to "balance" his column by a
few jibes at the Petroff slate should have been left
out — it was so poorly explained, that the rest of
the column almost made sense by comparison.
Fearon may honestly believe that student poli
tics are a joke. If that is indeed the case, he should
quit trying to campaign for a particular slate.
Moreover, if he must criticize politicians, he
should at least put some thought and work into
his critiques.
This column will appear, of course, too late to
influence the outcome of the election — that is, to
counterbalance Fearon's partisan assault. But it
will hopefully make Daily editors think a little bit.

Rick Fearon's obviously partisan concoction of
misinformation on the Daily opinions page April
20 strikes me as the height of irresponsibility.
Fearon—a Daily opinions editor, note—
claimed to be attacking student politics in gen
eral, but spent most of his time in unjustified and
unprovable attacks on the Council of Presidents
(COP) slate headed by Dan Howard.
The Daily editor had previously forbidden any
editor to write personal letters of endorsement.
By writing and then running his vicious col
umn the day before the election—thus eliminat
ing any chance of reply—Fearon exhibited pre
judice, stupidity and gross irresponsibility.
Some samples of Fearon's unsupported allega
tions:
—the Howard platform was nothing near 40
pages. Had Fearon bothered to try to read it, he
would have seen it was 20 pages of narrow mar
gins when presented to the Daily: the same text
took only eight pages, photo-reduced, as distri
buted.
—his assertion that "few of the proposals of the
average COP slate have a direct bearing on any
student" further demonstrates a sort of political
ignorance. As in national politics, every proposal
affects everyone, although to varying degrees.
