# Criticism of Pound
##

Sidney Hook

Prof. Donald Davie's state
ments in his letter to the Daily
April 21 regarding Prof. Robert
Cohn's critical comment on an
encomium of Ezra Pound testify
either to a perverse moral
economy or to a lamentable fai
lure to communicate clearly
what he meant to say. There is
certainly nothing "obscene" in
referring to the genocidal prac
tices of the powers, whose cause
Pound ardently defended during
World War 11, in considering

Pound as man and poet.
That Pound gave broadcasts as
a fanatical partisan of the
fascist-Nazi cause is undeniable.
He escaped a traitor's death be
cause he was adjudged techni
cally insane shortly before he
was to be brought to justice.
There is no finding that he was
insane when he was broadcast
ing. He died publicly unrepen
tant of his outrageous justifica
tion of the fascist-Nazi system

and his murderous injustices,
the victims of which numbered
far more than the six million
Jews.
Regardless of Pound's merits
as a poet, in our total judgment of
him we cannot subscribe to the
view of pure aestheticism, of "art
for art's sake." This was the up
shot of the discussion at the time
Pound was denied the
Emerson-Thoreau Medal of the
American Academy of Arts and
Sciences.
Civilized life requires that we
recognize the priority of moral
judgment. If a Nazi scientist has
made a medical discovery while
torturing human beings, it is un
likely that he would have been
awarded a Nobel Prize.
Indeed, at Nuremberg, some of
the Nazi physicians contended
that the knowledge gained by
immersing concentration camp
inmates in ice-cold water to see
how long they could survive,
would be useful in coping with
mishaps at sea. Such a rationali
zation can properly be called
"obscene."
Neither "art for art's sake," nor
"science for science's sake," nor
even "religion for religion's
sake" ("The Sabbath was made
for man, and not man for the
Sabbath" — Mark, 2, 27.) is
compatible with the life of
reason.
In protesting the glorification
of Pound, Cohn was not only
exercising a legitimate right of
criticism, he was expressing the
values of a liberal and humane
society. He deserves plaudits,
not abuse.

Prof. Donald Davie's state
ments in his letter to the Daily
April 21 regarding Prof. Robert
Cohn's critical comment on an
encomium of Ezra Pound testify
either to a perverse moral
economy or to a lamentable fai
lure to communicate clearly
what he meant to say. There is
certainly nothing "obscene" in
referring to the genocidal prac
tices of the powers, whose cause
Pound ardently defended during
World War 11, in considering

Pound as man and poet.
That Pound gave broadcasts as
a fanatical partisan of the
fascist-Nazi cause is undeniable.
He escaped a traitor's death be
cause he was adjudged techni
cally insane shortly before he
was to be brought to justice.
There is no finding that he was
insane when he was broadcast
ing. He died publicly unrepen
tant of his outrageous justifica
tion of the fascist-Nazi system

and his murderous injustices,
the victims of which numbered
far more than the six million
Jews.
Regardless of Pound's merits
as a poet, in our total judgment of
him we cannot subscribe to the
view of pure aestheticism, of "art
for art's sake." This was the up
shot of the discussion at the time
Pound was denied the
Emerson-Thoreau Medal of the
American Academy of Arts and
Sciences.
Civilized life requires that we
recognize the priority of moral
judgment. If a Nazi scientist has
made a medical discovery while
torturing human beings, it is un
likely that he would have been
awarded a Nobel Prize.
Indeed, at Nuremberg, some of
the Nazi physicians contended
that the knowledge gained by
immersing concentration camp
inmates in ice-cold water to see
how long they could survive,
would be useful in coping with
mishaps at sea. Such a rationali
zation can properly be called
"obscene."
Neither "art for art's sake," nor
"science for science's sake," nor
even "religion for religion's
sake" ("The Sabbath was made
for man, and not man for the
Sabbath" — Mark, 2, 27.) is
compatible with the life of
reason.
In protesting the glorification
of Pound, Cohn was not only
exercising a legitimate right of
criticism, he was expressing the
values of a liberal and humane
society. He deserves plaudits,
not abuse.
