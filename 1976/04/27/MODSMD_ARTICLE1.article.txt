# Budget cuts force Hoover Library to lay off 7
## 
### Bert Bower 
Hoover Institution library boasts a wealth of
resource materials few private institutions can
match. Its 1.25 million volumes represent
about a third of total University holdings and
are the largest private archive collection in the
United States. Last year almost 1200 visiting
scholars from 38 different states and 29 foreign
countries used Hoover materials.
But even Hoover's library, with all its domi
nance in its field, has begun to feel the pinch of
economic austerity.
The University's three-year $10 million belt
tightening effort has forced the library to cut
$209,000 from its operating budget between
1975 and 1978.
As a result, seven library personnel will be
laid off in August,representing ansBo,ooo re
duction in operating costs, according to
Hoover Institution Director VV. Glenn
Campbell.
The cuts have raised serious concerns that
some of Hoover's world-renowned collections
may suffer.
'Minimum effect'
But Campbell said the cuts will have a
"minimum effect on the quality of the library"
because the Hoover staff is presently formulat
ing plans to lessen the impact of the cuts. "As
long as I'm director," Campbell said, "the lib
rary will continue in excellent shape."
Opinions differ, however, on how greatly the
loss of seven library personnel will affect the

library.
Serial Librarian Marie Schutz, who has been
notified that she will be laid off, described the
situation: "It's apt to be difficult after August.
I've never had enough help or time."
Foreign Government Document Librarian
W. David Rozkuszka, who is familiar with
Hoover's resources, said, "1 don't see how
they're going to function without (Schutz's)
position. It's a crucial area of thelibrary.and it's
a shame to cut it back. I'm very concerned."
'Really serious'
His concern was also shared by the curator of
the western European collection, Agnes Peter
son. She referred to the loss of Shutz's position
as "really serious."
"It will make things more difficult and more
complicated without her," Peterson said. "Any
kind of up-to-date research we're doing first
appears in journals or newspapers (handled by
the Serials Department). If we cut the staff
there, we make it more difficult for the rest of
the staff."
Also being laid off is the Head of Cataloguing
and Acquisitions Adorjan de Galfy and three
clerical workers on his staff—Linda Galewatz,
Anne Wilson and Michelle Mount. •
Asa result some "professional people will be
forced to do sub-professional work," De Galfy
said.
'Acquisition decline?'
In addition, De Galfy predicted a 30 percent
decline in acquisitions.

Associate Director for Library Operations
Richard Staar said that Hoover is already "get
ting less material." Commenting on the per
sonnel cuts, he said. "We will have to reor
ganize,and people in the cataloguing and ac
quisitions departments will have to assume
new responsibilities."
He said it was "fortunate the cuts came now
because the people are getting four months'
notice, and it may be possible to place them in
new jobs."
The two remaining layoffs, those of Re
search Fellow William Katliff and Library As
sistant Julia Ball, may havea pronounced affect
on the Latin American collection.
Less important?
"When a budget cut is made, it is most likely
going to affect the collections considered by
the administration as less important." Rati iff
said. He is the editor of the Latin American
section of Hoover's annual International
Communism Yearbook.
"But the Latin American collection is unique
and important. We preserve a lot of material
that might not otherwise be preserved in this
country or in Latin America."
Ball is the only assistant to Latin American
Curator Joseph Bingaman. Said Bingaman:
"The work she does will have to be absorbed. I
don't know how that will be worked out."
Extinction?
Other reliable sources within Hoover have
said the Latin American collection is on the

border line of extinction.
Campbell maintained.however, that despite
the personnel cuts actu.il acquisitions would
not decline. "If the situation in terms of servic
ing materials looks as if it is having an adverse
affect, we will act on it."
He explained that the $209,000 three-year
cut by the University was partly due to general
University financial policies that led to a lower
endowment income.
Campbell explained that the University had
common stock which it abandoned for bonds
just when the stock market was beginning to
make a recovery in 1975. The transaction led to
smaller income this year.
Campbell also noted that the University's
$209,000 i:ut represents a percentage four
times as great as tin; Main Library's cutbacks.
"The Main Library couldn't take a percentage
cutback at our level and operate .it our high
level of operation." Campbell said.
Expansion
While Hoover library is feeling the crunch of
present University economic policy, other
areas at Hoover seem to be expanding.
On Jan. 8. 1975. President Cerald Ford
signed a bill that will provide $7 million in
federal funds for the construction of a third
building at the institution. Hoover has five
years to raise $7 million in matching funds to
be used for "general Hoover Institution pur
poses," according to Campbell.

In addition, the domestic research
program seems to be expanding, with
increasing emphasis placed on re
search and publications. Such well
known scholars as Seymour Martin
Lipset and Edward Teller are based at
the institution.
Constructing a new building, con
tinuing a high level of research and
publication and expanding the domes
tic studies are helping to enhance
Hoover's prestige.

The library personnel cuts, how
ever. will not strengthen one of
Hoover's fundamental services: pro
viding students, researchers and scho
lars with an invaluable wealth of mate
rials which, in many cases, can't be
found at any other institution.
Indeed, the layoffs have left many
with some unanswered questions: "Is
the Hoover shifting its emphasis? Why
have library cuts been made while
other areas of Hoover are expanding?"
