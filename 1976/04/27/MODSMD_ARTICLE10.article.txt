# How the media cover elections
## 
### 
Baseball's most famous umpire, Bill
Klem, was once asked whether a certain
pitch was a ball or a strike. "It ain't no
thing," he replied, "until I call it."
In much the same way, while the results
of the Democratic primary in Pennsylvania
will be known tonight, the meaning won't
be clear until one R.W. Apple Jr. determines
what it should be.
What, you may ask, is an R.W. Apple Jr.?
The fruit industry's answer to Tony the
Tiger? Not exactly, although his power is
similarly grrrreat.
Apple is the senior political writer for the
New York Times and one of two
"heavyweights" in the profession, accord
ing to Timothy Crouse's remarkable
analysis of the 1972 campaign, The Boys in
the Bus. Apple's analyses are generally
picked up by the rest of the media and serve
as a focal point for discussion during the
remainder of the campaign.
Last Friday, Apple concluded, with few
reservations, that the Democratic race is
now between Jimmy Carter and Hubert
Humphrey, and that the presence of candi
dates such as Morris LJda 11 and Henry
Jackson does lit'le except help stop Carter.
This, of course, is a self-fulfilling
prophecy. Jackson's chances are now just
about dead, simply because his name is
coupled in voters' minds as "the Humphrey
stand-in." Udall was the stand-in purpose
in Wisconsin. Jerry Brown will be "Hum
phrey West."
Apple's analysis did not stop at just limit

ing the race between Carter and Humphrey,
however. He also suggested campaign tacks
for both men to follow.
According to Apple, Carter should try to
demonstrate that, according to polls, he has
a better chance at beating G. & B. Ford than
does Humphrey, while Humphrey should
campa'gn on the issue that "Carter is not 'a
real Democrat.' "

So. we now have candidates and issues
both defined. The problem is that the issues
are of style rather than substance. There are
few real differences between Humphrey
and Carter.
The only issues one could glean out of the
Times and the major news magazines and
networks are minor ones. Carter wants to
pardon Vietnam-era draft evaders, Hum
phrey doesn't. Humphrey wants to spend
more money than does Carter to reach full
employment, but they both will probably
expand the money supply. Both have the
same foreign policy as Ford/Kissinger, with

minor changes. Big deal.
Those candidates who have different
views than Humphrey and Carter are dis- 1
missed out of hand by the media with neat
phrases. Wallace is a washed-up phenome
non; Jackson a warmonger; Udall too lib
eral; Brown to inexperienced; Church a . . .
well, he doesn't have a chance anyway.
The truth is that the media simply take
and read polls, neatly package the results,
determine which candidates fit a profile
and dismiss other candidates (and their is
sues) as unimportant.
In this context, how can one expect Carter
or anyone else to take clear stands? Clear
stands don't win, as Goldwater and
McGovern proved. Jackson should have fi
gured this out and been only a closet war
monger.
The media is not doing a totally bad job.
Having learned from the Nixon-McGovern
race that an above-the-battle non-candidate
can hide more than a real candidate, Hum
phrey is being pressured to either enter
some primaries or get out and let Jackson,
Udall and Brown plead their own cases. It's
probably too late, though, and the net result
will be that if the media destroy Humphrey,
Carter will be the only man left.
Taken as a whole, it's just another mean
ingless election covered by media which
think popularity-poll answers represent
Cod-given truths.
