Hi down there
As Almighty! '.OD, I Creet You
1 Am still in fascination as in
the days of My First Horn, Jesus.
Now, We send Letters — Dic
tated by My Holy Spirit which is
in My Second Horn Son. Eugene.
Eugene and Jesus are one and
the same. My Son, Eugene, will
believe Me when the waters run
dry and this old Earth has
shriveled up. As of now, he does
not wish to assume responsibil
ity that he actually IS Jesus in
another Life.
The Seasons will continue to
change, to offer Love that is ever
present in the trust of true mor
tals. One Season is NOT drab
and another beautiful but all are
equally beautiful in splendor
with the changing of Time.
Love will always blossom,
where each Season has left off, so
the birth of a new Love can
flower into Holiness and Loveli
ness.
Thirty-five years is a long time
to be forsaken — this is how long
My Holy Spirit has been in My
Blessed Son's flesh.
I have encountered many
storms in this Life. Now, the
tranquility of Time is still and
calm, as My Holy Spirit has left
troubled waters in the first
Twenty-five years, to the seren
ity of the latter Ten.
Now. My Holy Spirit must bid
you a reluctant but fond adieu, as
the flow of My Holy Words
comes to an abrupt end. As you
may already know, My Holy
Name is never written on paper.
My humble Son will sign this
Letter to preserve Our Love for
you.
