# 'TAs should learn how to teach'
## 
### Kim Hatamiya 
Graduate schools here are insufficient
when it comes to teaching grad students
how to educate, according to participants in
a workshop here Friday.
Sondra Napell, coordinator of Graduate
Assistants Teaching Programs at UC-
Berkeley, got graduate students here in
volved in a peer teaching demonstration
similar to her class at Berkeley.The class.she
said, is designed "to help people help them
selves."
According to Jon Reider. a workshop
coordinator and graduate student in history
of social theory here, the University has not
spent sufficient resources on problems of
graduate students.
Hence, a study group of interested grad
students and Danforth fellowship reci
pients conceived a series of workshops on
"Academic Problems of the Graduate Stu
dent at Stanford." The series, of which Fri
day's workshop was the first, is sponsored
by the Genter for Teaching and Learning
here.
Insufficient notice
"The basic academic concerns of
graduate students do not receive enough
of the appropriate attention from the Uni
versity," Reider commented.
The workshops are intended to address
problems ranging from specific, practical
concerns such as effective teaching
techniques, grading procedures and job
tinding to such theoretical applications as
cross-disciplinary utilization of methods
and general knowledge.
"Through the workshops, we're trying to
raise the level of University interest by pro
viding grad students emotional support and
practical assistance," Reider said.
"Stanford is noticeably more backward in
this area than most other universities of its
caliber." Reider added. "We would like to

see the University make a generalized
commitment to improved teaching via grad
students."
Napell's workshop on the improvement
of instructional skills began with a lively
contrast of the scholarly academician, un
familiar with so-called teaching methods
and techniques, with the unlikely situation
of an educator unfamiliar with his discip
line.
The humorous contrast helped to rein
force Napell's belief that "we should not
perpetuate the pretensethat years of experi
ence or even scholarly reputation are neces
sarily related to the quality of under
graduate instruction" as presented in a
workshop fact sheet.
Role playing
Grad students were asked to play the roles
of both teacher and student. Dividing the
gathering of grad students into'various
groups, Napell distributed descriptions of
"six uncommon non-facilitating teaching
behaviors" to be presented before the work
shop participants as if taught in a regular
classroom situation.
The teams of grad students employed
role-playing, question-and-answer formats,
visual aids and discussion to define,
exemplify and improve upon the behaviors
presented.
"Notice that peer teaching is important,
and no sort of lecture took place," Napell
said.
"The workshop can hopefully provide a
variety of experience and formats to be
utilized in real-life situations," she added.
"Different needs demand different
methods, which in turn yields variety. We
just don't assume everyone learns the same
way."
In response to the active learning process
presented at the workshop from which both

teacher and student may benefit, one grad
student commented that "the classroom it
self isn't really conducive to helping the
teacher to learn."
Now in its third year at UC-Herkeley,
Napell's course acknowledges the need for
teaching assistants (TAs) to receive training
on instructional methods. Videotapes of a
TA's regular class period are filmed and
later viewed by the grad student to evaluate
personally his or her classroom perfor
mance and the reactions of his or her stu
dents.
TAs also receive consultations from
Napell and attend seminars on various sub
jects similar to the Stanford workshop.
"The ideal situation," Napell com
mented. "would be for a professor to come
to these seminars with his TAs.
Train profs?
"Some sort of training program should be
the requirement of all academic professors,
who are the least trained of any profession
als in any field," she remarked.
ASSU Vice President Deric Jennings, a
graduate student, attended the workshop
and remarked that he "is now in a position
to be effective in regards to the needs of grad
students.
"Many times the TA positon is only a
means of getting financial assistance, and
only for that reason do some grad students
become TAs," stated Jennings.
"The University does not provide an ex
ternal motivation for TAs to become good
educators — this is bad for the undergrads
subjected to this, and of course not par
ticularly good for the TA," he commented.
"The University must provide an incen
tive to TAs, and the means are not readily
available," he said.
The workshops will continue to be held
the next four Fridays in the Florence Moore
Main Lounge.
