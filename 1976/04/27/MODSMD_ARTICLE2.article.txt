A police investigation of the alleged
filming of pornographic movies by
San Jose State University (SJSU) stu
dents has produced no corroborating
evidence, according to a statement is
sued last Friday by SJSU President
John Bunzel.
The investigation, which involved
SJSU police, the university's housing
office. San Jose Police and the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Office, was
sparked by a news story which ap
peared in the Spartan Daily, the SJSU
campus newspaper, on April 6.
The story by student reporter Louise
Ransil described how SJSU students
allegedly wrote, directed and per
formed in pornographic films sold to
wholesalers, and distributed in Los
Angeles and in the East. The story
claimed that over 200 films were pro
duced by students.

William Hoffmann, assistant Santa
Clara county district attorney, said that
the production of pornographic films
could involve prostitution charges.
Possible charges
"The actors and actresses could face
prostitution charges if they're commit
ting sex acts for money, and the impre
sario could face charges of pimping if
he's living off the proceeds," he said.
The lack of any evidence so far re
garding the allegations by the investi
gation and alleged misquotes in the
story have led the district attorney to
doubt the validity of the story.
Hoffman insisted that the story
could not be true. He
said the investigation included under
cover agents and that none of the in
vestigating sources had heard any
thing about the filming or distribution
of the films.
Ransil's story included several

statements attributed to Al Fabris. de
puty district attorney for Santa Clara
County, which Fabris denied having
made to Ransil in a letter to the Spar
tan Daily which was printed on April
21.
In the letter, Fabris said he had never
met Ransil and that he had never been
interviewed by her, either in person or
by telephone.
Ransil claims that she did interview
Fabris. "1 did talk to Fabris. It was a
phone interview about a month before
the story ran," she said.
"Just before the story ran, 1 called his
secretary to see that his name and title
were correct. When I spoke to him, 1
identified myself and (told him) that 1
was doing a story on pornography. I
told him what I was doing, and he
made the statements," said Ransil.
Fabris is on vacation for two weeks
and was unavailable for comment.

Hoffman said, "I'm sure he hasn't
talked with her. He hasn't spoken with
anyone from the Spartan Daily for two
years. He (also) said things he couldn't
have said because he didn't know
them."
Fremont case
Hoffmann noted that Ransil's story
said that Fabris referred to a case in
Fremont where "Deep Throat" was
judged non-pornographic. "He
couldn't have said that because we
only have the cases listed by county,
not by city." said Hoffmann.
"According to him (Fabris), she in
vented the whole story," Hoffmann
said.
Steve Wright, editor of the Spartan
Daily, said he stands behind the story
and supports Ransil. "I stand behind
her 100 percent," he said.
"The lack of any result from the
(SJSU) investigation is what 1
would've expected. No one is going to
want to talk after the fact," Wright ad
ded.
"Just because they couldn't find any
evidence doesn't mean the story is
false," he said.
Follow-up story
Wright also said that the Spartan
Daily would try to do a follow-up story
on the filmmaking. "We only have 12
issues left (this term). 1 don't know if
there's enough time to do a follow-up.
Someone else (other than Ransil)
would probably do the story." said
Wright.
According to Officer Larry James of
the SJSU campus police, Chief of
Police E.G. Quinton offered to give
Ransil a lie detector test to determine if
the story was genuine.
"We were interested in determining
the validity of the story only, not in
finding out who her sources were."
said James.
"The chief talked to her attorney and
told him we were interested in having
her on the lie detector. Her attorney
was very reluctant to do this. He told
us she would not go on it." James
explained.
Ransil's attorney, Steve Schlosser of
San Jose, said that to his knowledge,
the story was true and gave reasons for
refusing to allow Ransil to take a lie
detector test.
"Basically, we were in a 'damned if
we do, damned if we didn't' situa
tion," Schlosser said. "If she flunked
the test it would impair her credibility
and hurt her in the future. If she passed
the test, the D.A. would probably
reopen the investigation and possibly
force her to reveal her sources."
Protecting sources
Ransil has vowed to protect the
identities of her sources and has re
fused to make her notes available to
investigators.
Under the California Evidence Code,
S. 1070, also referred to as the repor
ters' "shield law," a reporter cannot be
held in contempt for refusing to dis
close sources of information by any
body having the power to subpoena
evidence.
Schlosser noted that this law is no
longer binding as a result of previous
court decisions, but that it is still fol

lowed by other agencies. "The D.A.
is not hostile to newsmen, they still
like to follow the law even though it's
been emasculated."
The shield law does not protect re
porters when they refuse to reveal in
formation about crimes they have wit
nessed.
'Consenting adults'
Wright stressed that Ransil, who al
legedly watched films being made and
took pictures, did not witness a crime.
"She did not see any money change
hands. There is no law against filming
porno using consenting adults," hq
said.
According to California Penal Code,
S. 311, it is against the law to sell or
distribute obscene material.
According to Bunzel's statement.
"SJSIJ will continue its investigation
in the hope that the alleged events can
be shown not to have occurred."
Schlosser said he thought the whole
incident had "more or less fizzled out.
"The case is dead for the moment.
All we can do is sit back. Craduation is
three weeks a way,and not hi ng is goi ng
to happen before graduation," he said.
