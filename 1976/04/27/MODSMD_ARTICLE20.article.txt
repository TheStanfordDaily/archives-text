# Fonda stumps for Hayden, argues Senate needs him
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
Academy Award-winning ac
tress and radical political ac
tivist Jane Fonda visited here
Friday during a hectic schedule
of campaigning for the senato
rial bid of her husband, Tom
Hayden.
In an interview to be broadcast
today at 5:30 p.m. on KZSIJ,
Fonda discussed her films and
her politics, demonstrating how
they overlap.
Fonda explained why Hayden
had chosen to run for the Senate,
rather than for the House of Rep
resentatives.
"The Senate is the one area of
goverment in which basic
policies are debated. . . . The
philosophies of our country are
essentially debated in the Senate
— it was how it was originally
conceived," she said.
"Tom's strength is as a vision
ary. as a strategist, someone
who is and has been all his life
fundamentally bound up with
basic philosophies and priorities
in this country. It stands to
reason, then, that ... he should
be in the Senate," she added.
Fonda stressed Hayden's
strength in terms of "strategy,"
emphasizing his use of it in the
civil rights movement, the anti
war movement and the forma
tion ot Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) in the 196 Us.
Attacking the established idea
of how to become a politician
("You go to Harvard or Yale, get
your law degree and then start at
the bottom"), Fonda suggested
t hat "we have to reconsider what
does prepare one for public of
fice."
Out-of-it politicos
She cited public opinion
polls that show "that most
people in the United States feel
that most politicians are 20 years
behind the times," simply be
cause of this trail that slowly
leads to Washington.
Fonda listed Hayden's ac
complishments in many com
munities, referring to his work in
Newark, N.J., as a civil rights
leader; in Atlanta working with
Martin Luther King; in Berkeley
concerning community control
ot the police; and in Indochina
negotiating over prisoners of
war.
Even on the subject of movies.
Fonda was never far away from
politics. All her films—the ones
she's acted in recently, as well as
those she plans on producing —
are politically oriented.
Her upcoming film is Dick and
jane, with George Segal. Fonda
explaned that it was the Dick and
Jane of the reading primers, who

have grown up and gotten mar
ried.
Middle class panic
"Dick is an aerospace execu
tive who's laid off. There they
are with their middle class pre
tentions — their $25U,0()U house
and the mortgage they can't pay,
their over-extension with the
Diner's Club, and their
panic.... In our movie they be
come hold-up artists.
"It's sort of a black, sardonic
comedy with shades of Water
gale in il, about a phenomenon
that is really quite real in Ameri
can life. In fact, the middle class
and even the upper middle class
are experiencing the bottom
dropping out — the fact that the
American dream is not necessar
ily going to be theirs anymore,"
she said.
As a producer. Fonda has
commissioned some writers to
create stories in which people
"are viewed," she said, "re
moved from any kind of social
context, as though whatever we

are as people has nothing to do
with the environment in which
we live. In fact, that's very inac
curate. It doesn't help us undei
stand anyt hi ng about who we are
or what we do. We're ill formed
by the economic situation in
which we live, the social
philosophy and mores, el cet
era."
Above all, Fonda is commit
ted. Asked about Hayden's
chances in the primary, she ex
pressed the belief that he would
vvi n.
"Bui whatever happens on
June 8. we will continue, be
cause we're in it toi lite Tom
Hayden will run again," she
said
"We feel this is the time to be
gin. because so many people are
changing. Middle Americans are
discovering that the rules that
they've played by all their lives
are bankrupt, and they're look
ing for different kinds of
answers."

Out-of-it politicos
She cited public opinion
polls that show "that most
people in the United States feel
that most politicians are 20 years
behind the times," simply be
cause of this trail that slowly
leads to Washington.
Fonda listed Hayden's ac
complishments in many com
munities, referring to his work in
Newark, N.J., as a civil rights
leader; in Atlanta working with
Martin Luther King; in Berkeley
concerning community control
ot the police; and in Indochina
negotiating over prisoners of
war.
Even on the subject of movies.
Fonda was never far away from
politics. All her films—the ones
she's acted in recently, as well as
those she plans on producing —
are politically oriented.
Her upcoming film is Dick and
jane, with George Segal. Fonda
explaned that it was the Dick and
Jane of the reading primers, who

have grown up and gotten mar
ried.
Middle class panic
"Dick is an aerospace execu
tive who's laid off. There they
are with their middle class pre
tentions — their $25U,0()U house
and the mortgage they can't pay,
their over-extension with the
Diner's Club, and their
panic.... In our movie they be
come hold-up artists.
"It's sort of a black, sardonic
comedy with shades of Water
gale in il, about a phenomenon
that is really quite real in Ameri
can life. In fact, the middle class
and even the upper middle class
are experiencing the bottom
dropping out — the fact that the
American dream is not necessar
ily going to be theirs anymore,"
she said.
As a producer. Fonda has
commissioned some writers to
create stories in which people
"are viewed," she said, "re
moved from any kind of social
context, as though whatever we

are as people has nothing to do
with the environment in which
we live. In fact, that's very inac
curate. It doesn't help us undei
stand anyt hi ng about who we are
or what we do. We're ill formed
by the economic situation in
which we live, the social
philosophy and mores, el cet
era."
Above all, Fonda is commit
ted. Asked about Hayden's
chances in the primary, she ex
pressed the belief that he would
vvi n.
"Bui whatever happens on
June 8. we will continue, be
cause we're in it toi lite Tom
Hayden will run again," she
said
"We feel this is the time to be

changing. Middle Americans are

Academy Award-winning ac
tress and radical political ac
tivist Jane Fonda visited here
Friday during a hectic schedule
of campaigning for the senato
rial bid of her husband, Tom
Hayden.
In an interview to be broadcast
today at 5:30 p.m. on KZSIJ,
Fonda discussed her films and
her politics, demonstrating how
they overlap.
Fonda explained why Hayden
had chosen to run for the Senate,
rather than for the House of Rep
resentatives.
"The Senate is the one area of
goverment in which basic
policies are debated. . . . The
philosophies of our country are
essentially debated in the Senate
— it was how it was originally
conceived," she said.
"Tom's strength is as a vision
ary. as a strategist, someone
who is and has been all his life
fundamentally bound up with
basic philosophies and priorities
in this country. It stands to
reason, then, that ... he should
be in the Senate," she added.
Fonda stressed Hayden's
strength in terms of "strategy,"
emphasizing his use of it in the
civil rights movement, the anti
war movement and the forma
tion ot Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) in the 196 Us.
Attacking the established idea
of how to become a politician
("You go to Harvard or Yale, get
your law degree and then start at
the bottom"), Fonda suggested
t hat "we have to reconsider what
does prepare one for public of
fice."
