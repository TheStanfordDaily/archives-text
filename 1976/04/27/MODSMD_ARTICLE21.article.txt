# Union organizers face 'unexpected' opposition from textile workers
## 
### 
COLUMBUS. Ga. (PNS) — In
the auto plants of Detroit and the
steel mills of Pittsburgh, unions
are an established way of life.
But here in the textile mills of
Georgia — and throughout the
Southeast — the union move
ment is still as rudimentary as
unspun cotton.
From Virginia to Alabama,
courtrooms and picket lines are
the battle scenes in a campaign
to organize the South's huge

$16-18 billion a year textile in
dustry. Of the 550.000 southern
textile workers — 40 percent of
North Carolina's industrial work
force. 25 percent of South
Carolina's and 12 percent of
Georgia's — 50.000 now belong
to the Textile Workers' Union of
America (TYVUA).
Drives to organize southern
textile workers failed in the late
1920s and after World War II be
cause of company opposition,

lack of financing and political
and racial divisions among the
workers themselves. "Right
to-work" laws, which prohibit
agreements requiring all work
ers in a plant to join a union
(even though they receive union
benefits), have also hampered
textile organizing in the South.
"Since the textile industry is
the backbone of the economy
here, it sets the example for other
industries," says Mike Krivosh,

an organizer for the AFL-CIO In
dustrial Union Department
(lUD) in Charlotte. N.C. "The
whole attitude of anti-unionism
has spread throughout the other
industries here and has kept
wages down."
Indeed, the South's economic
development has largely been
built on cheap labor. Low wage
scales have attracted hundreds
of plants from the more un
ionized North.
North Carolina, the South's
most highly industrialized state
and biggest textile manufac
turer, also has the nation's low
est average industrial wage.
The average wage for textile
employes across the Southeast,
$3.48 per hour, is 20 percent
below the region's average
manufacturing wage and about
two-thirds the national average
of $4.84.
The lUD has been fighting to
organize the Southeast since

1962. As their main target they
and the TWUA picked J.P. Ste
vens. the nation's second largest
textile manufacturer. With 879
plants and 46,000 workers
throughout the South, Stevens
was to be the test of strength.
"We just didn't expect the sort
of opposition we've run into
over the last 13 years," Krivosh
says. "We've proven that they've
fired over 300 workers for trying
to unionize," he alleged.
Since 1963, the TWUA has
filed repeated complaints
against Stevens for alleged har
rassment, illegally firing work
ers, failing to negotiate in good
faith and other charges. A dozen
complaints have been upheld by
the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB), which ordered
Stevens to reinstate 289 workers
with back pay of $1.3 million.
The most serious charges, that
the company illegally closed its
Statesboro. Ga., plant last June to

avoid unionization, are still
pending. The plant was closed
two years after a judge ordered
the company to negotiate with
the union. The company claims
it closed the plant because it was
losing money, not to avoid
negotiating.
In another case. 3000 workers
at the seven Stevens plants in
Roanoke Rapids, N.C., are stll
without a contract after voting
for TWUA representation more
than 18 months ago.
Stevens contends the TWUA
doesn't really want to settle on a
contract, while the union has ac
cused Stevens of failing to
negotiate in good faith. The
AP'L-CIO executive council,
which recently set up a special
committee to coordinate efforts
against the? firm, has criticized
Stevens openly.
The TWUA is also active in
cities like Bristol, Tenn., Wal
lace. S.G.. and here in Columbus,
Ga. "As the economy goes down,
more workers are calling us,"
TWUA organizer Harold Bag
well says. "They're calling us in
stead of us having to call them."
In Columbus, a west Georgia
mill town of 130,000 with a po
tential textile union member

ship of 10,000. the union cam
paign began six years ago. After
quickly organizing a towel mill,
the TWUA has lost elections at
two other plants, including two
defeats at Swift textiles Charges
and counter-charges before the
NLRB have followed each elec
tion there.
Now, a third union election is
scheduled this spring at the
large Swift plant, which TWUA
officials think is the key to or
ganizing other Columbus mills.
Whatever the outcome of the
vote, the battle will probably
continue in the courts.
TWUA officials say a non
pocketbook issue may do more
to spur textile organizing than
any other.
The TWUA has launched a
campaign against byssinosis, or
brown lung disease, a respirat
ory ailment caused bv breathing
cotton dust. Workers in carding
and spinning operations are
especially susceptible, some suf
fering shortness of breath or
more severe complications.
More than 100.000 workers in
the United States have the dis
ease. according to Labor De
partment statistics.

quickly organizing a towel mill,
the TWUA has lost elections at
two other plants, including two
defeats at Swift textiles Charges

Now, a third union election is
scheduled this spring at the
large Swift plant, which TWUA
officials think is the key to or

Whatever the outcome of the
vote, the battle will probably
continue in the courts.
TWUA officials say a non
pocketbook issue may do more
to spur textile organizing than
any other.
The TWUA has launched a
campaign against byssinosis, or
brown lung disease, a respirat
ory ailment caused bv breathing
cotton dust. Workers in carding

COLUMBUS. Ga. (PNS) — In
the auto plants of Detroit and the
steel mills of Pittsburgh, unions
are an established way of life.
But here in the textile mills of
Georgia — and throughout the
Southeast — the union move
ment is still as rudimentary as
unspun cotton.
From Virginia to Alabama,
courtrooms and picket lines are
the battle scenes in a campaign
to organize the South's huge

$16-18 billion a year textile in
dustry. Of the 550.000 southern
textile workers — 40 percent of
North Carolina's industrial work
force. 25 percent of South
Carolina's and 12 percent of
Georgia's — 50.000 now belong
to the Textile Workers' Union of
America (TYVUA).
Drives to organize southern
textile workers failed in the late
1920s and after World War II be
cause of company opposition,

lack of financing and political
and racial divisions among the
workers themselves. "Right
to-work" laws, which prohibit
agreements requiring all work
ers in a plant to join a union
(even though they receive union
benefits), have also hampered
textile organizing in the South.
"Since the textile industry is
the backbone of the economy
here, it sets the example for other
industries," says Mike Krivosh,

an organizer for the AFL-CIO In
dustrial Union Department
(lUD) in Charlotte. N.C. "The
whole attitude of anti-unionism
has spread throughout the other
industries here and has kept
wages down."
Indeed, the South's economic
development has largely been
built on cheap labor. Low wage
scales have attracted hundreds
of plants from the more un
ionized North.
North Carolina, the South's
most highly industrialized state
and biggest textile manufac
turer, also has the nation's low
est average industrial wage.
The average wage for textile
employes across the Southeast,
$3.48 per hour, is 20 percent
below the region's average
manufacturing wage and about
two-thirds the national average
of $4.84.
The lUD has been fighting to
organize the Southeast since

1962. As their main target they
and the TWUA picked J.P. Ste
vens. the nation's second largest
textile manufacturer. With 879
plants and 46,000 workers
throughout the South, Stevens
was to be the test of strength.
"We just didn't expect the sort
of opposition we've run into
over the last 13 years," Krivosh
says. "We've proven that they've
fired over 300 workers for trying
to unionize," he alleged.
Since 1963, the TWUA has
filed repeated complaints
against Stevens for alleged har
rassment, illegally firing work
ers, failing to negotiate in good
faith and other charges. A dozen
complaints have been upheld by
the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB), which ordered
Stevens to reinstate 289 workers
with back pay of $1.3 million.
The most serious charges, that
the company illegally closed its
Statesboro. Ga., plant last June to

avoid unionization, are still
pending. The plant was closed
two years after a judge ordered
the company to negotiate with
the union. The company claims
it closed the plant because it was
losing money, not to avoid
negotiating.
In another case. 3000 workers
at the seven Stevens plants in
Roanoke Rapids, N.C., are stll
without a contract after voting
for TWUA representation more
than 18 months ago.
Stevens contends the TWUA
doesn't really want to settle on a
contract, while the union has ac
cused Stevens of failing to
negotiate in good faith. The
AP'L-CIO executive council,
which recently set up a special
committee to coordinate efforts
against the? firm, has criticized
Stevens openly.
The TWUA is also active in
cities like Bristol, Tenn., Wal
lace. S.G.. and here in Columbus,
Ga. "As the economy goes down,
more workers are calling us,"
TWUA organizer Harold Bag
well says. "They're calling us in

In another case. 3000 workers
at the seven Stevens plants in
Roanoke Rapids, N.C., are stll
without a contract after voting
for TWUA representation more

Stevens contends the TWUA
doesn't really want to settle on a
contract, while the union has ac
cused Stevens of failing to
negotiate in good faith. The
AP'L-CIO executive council,

committee to coordinate efforts

Stevens openly.
The TWUA is also active in

In Columbus, a west Georgia
mill town of 130,000 with a po

ship of 10,000. the union cam

quickly organizing a towel mill,
the TWUA has lost elections at
two other plants, including two
defeats at Swift textiles Charges
and counter-charges before the
NLRB have followed each elec

Now, a third union election is
scheduled this spring at the
large Swift plant, which TWUA
officials think is the key to or
ganizing other Columbus mills.
Whatever the outcome of the
vote, the battle will probably
continue in the courts.
TWUA officials say a non
pocketbook issue may do more
to spur textile organizing than
any other.
The TWUA has launched a
campaign against byssinosis, or
brown lung disease, a respirat
ory ailment caused bv breathing
cotton dust. Workers in carding
and spinning operations are
especially susceptible, some suf
fering shortness of breath or
more severe complications.
More than 100.000 workers in
the United States have the dis

COLUMBUS. Ga. (PNS) — In
the auto plants of Detroit and the
steel mills of Pittsburgh, unions
are an established way of life.
But here in the textile mills of
Georgia — and throughout the
Southeast — the union move
ment is still as rudimentary as
unspun cotton.
From Virginia to Alabama,
courtrooms and picket lines are
the battle scenes in a campaign
to organize the South's huge

$16-18 billion a year textile in
dustry. Of the 550.000 southern
textile workers — 40 percent of
North Carolina's industrial work
force. 25 percent of South
Carolina's and 12 percent of
Georgia's — 50.000 now belong
to the Textile Workers' Union of
America (TYVUA).
Drives to organize southern
textile workers failed in the late
1920s and after World War II be
cause of company opposition,

lack of financing and political
and racial divisions among the
workers themselves. "Right
to-work" laws, which prohibit
agreements requiring all work
ers in a plant to join a union
(even though they receive union
benefits), have also hampered
textile organizing in the South.
"Since the textile industry is
the backbone of the economy
here, it sets the example for other
industries," says Mike Krivosh,

an organizer for the AFL-CIO In
dustrial Union Department
(lUD) in Charlotte. N.C. "The
whole attitude of anti-unionism
has spread throughout the other
industries here and has kept
wages down."
Indeed, the South's economic
development has largely been
built on cheap labor. Low wage
scales have attracted hundreds
of plants from the more un
ionized North.
North Carolina, the South's
most highly industrialized state
and biggest textile manufac
turer, also has the nation's low
est average industrial wage.
The average wage for textile
employes across the Southeast,
$3.48 per hour, is 20 percent
below the region's average
manufacturing wage and about
two-thirds the national average
of $4.84.
The lUD has been fighting to
organize the Southeast since

1962. As their main target they
and the TWUA picked J.P. Ste
vens. the nation's second largest
textile manufacturer. With 879
plants and 46,000 workers
throughout the South, Stevens
was to be the test of strength.
"We just didn't expect the sort
of opposition we've run into
over the last 13 years," Krivosh
says. "We've proven that they've
fired over 300 workers for trying
to unionize," he alleged.
Since 1963, the TWUA has
filed repeated complaints
against Stevens for alleged har
rassment, illegally firing work
ers, failing to negotiate in good
faith and other charges. A dozen
complaints have been upheld by
the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB), which ordered
Stevens to reinstate 289 workers
with back pay of $1.3 million.
The most serious charges, that
the company illegally closed its
Statesboro. Ga., plant last June to

avoid unionization, are still
pending. The plant was closed
two years after a judge ordered
the company to negotiate with
