## 'Robin and Marian' 007 turns sensitive 
### Howard Baldwin 
British secret agent 007 as
Robin Hood? You may scoff all
you wish, but Sean Connerv is
firmly establishing himself in a
new career far away from the
character of James Bond. After
discouraging forays into The
Terrorists and Murder On The
Orient Express, Connerv entered
grandly into the field of histori
cal fiction with The Wind Anil
The Lion, The Man Who Would
Be King and now Rohirt and Ma
rian.
Connerv has matured from
the super-slick James Bond to an
actor with an expressive, experi
enced weathered face as per
fectly suited for history as
Charlton Heston's is for Biblical
epics. His beard is growing out
salt-and-pepper gray, even
though he is only 46, giv
ing him the ruddy adventurous
look needed for the epic adven
tures he is now enhancing.
Though it is hard to rank the
three excellent movies, Hohin
and Marian is perhaps the best of
them. Robin Hood twenty years
after his initial fame is Connery's
best role, for it offers him a ver
satility that neither of the other
two films could.
His Sherwood Forest compat
riots are no less memorable. The
actress who can come out of an
eight-year self-imposed retire
ment and still receive second bil
ling is rare, but it proves Audrey
Hepburn's talent and durability

as a star.
Nicol Williamson as Little
John is as excellent as one would
expect from a man whose
cinematic rendition of Hamlet
surpassed that of Laurence
Olivier's.
Robert Shaw plays the Sheriff
ot Nottingham with the same
gutsy strength and force that he
shows in all his diverse roles
IT he Taking Of Pel ha m One Two
Three; Jaws). If is refreshing to
see such a great actor finally re
ceiving the long overdue public
recognition he deserves.
Robin (ind Marian is a bit
tersweet love story of legends
grown old, of people meeting
years after they've been lovers,
only to find that their bonds are
still strong. Robin returns from
the Crusades to find Sherwood
Forest overgrown and Marian an
abbess about to be taken prisoner
by the evil sheriff.
Director Richard Lester (The
Three and Pour Musketeers)
uses the imagery of rotting ap
ples to indicate youth and ripe
ness grown past its prime. It is
particularly appropriate in the
context of the film that Audrey
Hepburn has been gone so long
— she returns to the movies and
steals the audience's love, just as
Robin returns to Marian and ste
als hers.
The film is a whimsical fan
tasy, stunningly photographed,
and all around a beautiful mo
tion picture. Its basic strength

boils down to the romanticism of
the legend of Robin Hood,
though, when Will Scarlett!Den
ham Elliott) says. "Everyone
still wants to hear about our
exploits in the early days, Ro
bin," Robin replies, "Hut Will,
we never did them!"
James Goldman's screenplay
takes us through the last fight
to-the-death with the sheriff.
The last scenes and images,
when Marian insures that she
and Robin will be together
forever, is a masterpiece that
brings together all the elements
of love, fantasy and legendry.
Robin and Marian is currently
showing at the Menlo Theater.
