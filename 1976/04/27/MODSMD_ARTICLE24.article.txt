STONE ALONE: Bill Wyman.
Rolling Stones Records
Bill Wyman's most recent
album is called Stone Alone, and
it ain't rollin' nowhere. It's nice
that some of the less-lauded
Boys in the Bands are making
their own records; solo albums
by such musicians as Ron Wood,
Bob Weir, Billy Cobham and
Marty Balin have spotlighted the
relatively low-profile members
of stellar rock groups.
However, in the case of Bill
Wyman and the Stones, I wish
he'd take his bass back into the
shadows, let Mick sing and
Keith compose.
On Stons Alone, Wyman has
attempted to represent a variety
of musical styles: rock, country
honk, reggae and the humorous
ditty. The first side of the album
might more accurately be called
a pastiche of the boring, the
mediocre and the pathetic. "A
Quarter to Three" is a '50s
style rock'n'roll number, passa
ble because of Van Morrison's
swinging sax.
Wyman's voice is flat and
sounds as if he has a speech im
pediment, which he, unlike Jag
ger, can't use to his advantage.
Wyman's slur isn't expressive:
it's messy. His attempt at reggae,
"Soul Satisfying," sounds like a
7-1 Jp commercial. Its beat is
bouncy, its rhyming lyrics
whispered and its instrumen
tals reminiscent of the muzak
piped in at skating rinks.
The album's second side is
distinguished by curiosities —
spoofs of established musical
types and reworkings of old
material. Wyman croaks out his
Louis Armstrong imitation in
"No More FoolinV' Then there's
a speeded-up version of the old
Trini Lopez number, "If You
Wanna Be Happy." Better
synched than the original, with
reeling sax parts and energetic
back-up vocals by the Pointer
Sisters, this is one of the two
"highlights" of Wyman's
lackluster album.
The other minimal offender is
"Feet," an upbeat song with
funny lyrics and the only

noteworthy guitarwork on the
record. Danny Kortchmar's play
ful slide guitar saves this song,
probably because he wrote it.
Although there are many
styles, or rather, imitations of
styles, on his current record,
Wyman seems to have mastered
onlyone—theamusing curio.On
the whole, the instrumental
rarely surface, Wyman's voice is
monotonous and his composi
tions overly casual.
One may cite Stone Alone for
being unpretentious and claim
that Wyman plays only so that,
as he says, "you can dance if you
wanna." You can also stop buy
ing records and switch to AM.
SWEET HARMONY: Maria
Muldaur, Warner Bros.
Sweet Harmony, Maria Mul
daur's new album, is also
marked by stylistic diversity.
Happily, in this case, the re
cord's quality doesn't suffer for
the sake of its varied selection.
Even sworn enemies of all that is
languid and laid-back in pop
music should appreciate Mul
daur's expertise.
Possessing vocal command
and versatility, she vitalizes the
gospel, the ballad, the '30s
show tune, the New Orleans and
the swing sounds. Her charac
teristic sliding vocals are less
common in this than in earlier
work.
And in several faster songs.
Muldaur proves that she can
swing with the best of them. In
one foot-stamping gospel tune.
Muldaur wails in orgasmic
ecstasy, singing "when you
make love to me all night long, I
can't stand it."
She forgoes her typically
seductive manner to sing plainly
and dynamically in the ballad of
"Jon the Generator," akin in
spirit to Carol King's similarly
upbeat, similarly narrated,
"Smack Water Jack."
Muldaur succeeds, on her
latest record, with a wide range
of songs, any one of which might
be the redeeming cut on a lesser
album. To complement a diet of
hard rock or to round out a mel
lower regime, take Sweet Har
mony auditorily.

AL r RORA. Jean-Luc Ponty,
Atlantic
In Switzerland. 1966. four of
the world's finest jazz violinists
met to produce an extraordinary
concert and subsequent album.
Violin Summel. Three of the
musicians were over 50 years
old, but one was a strikingly
young (24 years old) and new in
fluence named Jean-Luc Ponty,
who had not as yet released an
album but had nonetheless
placed first in Down Beat's jazz
critic's poll.
Since that day, Ponty has
taken an unusual course for the
only violinist ever to capture the
Coltrane spirit. He has served in
ternships in the Mahavishnu Or
chestra as well as the Elton John
Hand, released a number of solo
albums and become increas
ingly influenced by rock.
Last year, his first album for
Atlantic, Upon the Wings of
Music, was released. It was his
first all-out attempt at creating a
jazz-rock fusion of his own. Poli
ty's second album, Aurora, is
now upon us. While it suffers
from some uneveness, it is over
all an amazing and captivating
testament to Polity's virtuosity

and imagination.
Aurora experiments more
with studio effects and
techniques — overdubbing,
phase shifters, wah-wah — than
do previous albums, but never
exploits these tools to the point
of gimmickery. His last album
suffered from an inability to
maintain the subtlety and vari
ety of jazz under the foursquare
drumming and simpler chord
patterns of rock.
Ponty and band play acousti
cally, and his violin is dubbed
into a string chorus. Together,
they conjure up visions of a
Tolkien-like lantasy world.
Throughout the album, Ponty's
skill at coaxing varied textures
from his instrument and techni
cal virtuosity are striking.
Ponty remains the finest elec
tric violinist in the world today,
and Aurora is a worthy effort
from this musical pioneer.
DESTROYER. Kiss, Casablanca
Things had looked almost
hopeful. Kiss, four black-and
silver faced, spike-and-leather
rebels of theatre-rock, had repor
tedly realized that musicians
generally stay more successful if
able to play music. Rather than
fire themselves and hire four

competents, however, they
chose to take up Bob Erzin's
(Alice Cooper notoriety) offer to
produce their album.
This "New Direction" piece of
vinyl is appropriately titled De
stroyer, and shows that
superhuman producing efforts
can compensate only slightly for
a glaring lack of talent.
Erzin's efforts are heaped onto
Destroyer. We have Kiss and
organ interlude, Kiss and or
chestra, Kiss and chorus, but,
unfortunately, we still have Kiss.
Erzin's carefully structured mus
ical gimmicks are too often top
pled by a single inane, nonsensi
cal guitar solo from Ace Frehley.
The group even makes an at
tempt to shoot for MOR in
"Beth," but only succeeds in
contrasting a lush string ar
rangement with Peter Criss'
weak, gravel-throated vocals.
We find that Kiss is strongest
singing in harmony, as no
member is capable of a really
good solo.
There are a few rare moments,
however, when the Erzin plan
works,noticeably in a song like
"Flaming Youth," which offers
stylistic variation and hints of

more subtle musical interplay.
With more i;are and thought.
Kiss could consistently bring us
the raucous infectiousness of a
punk-rock group like Sweet.
Senseless repetition and lack
of development too often charac
terize their work, however, and
without improvement in this
area, the four boys may realize
their own lyric: "1 got to laugh
'cause I know I'm gonna die."
FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE;
Peter Frampton. A & M
Upon observing Frampton's
glassy eyes, gaping mouth and
primal plumage, one unfamiliar
with his work might expect him
to begin flailing away at his Les
Paul in an orgy of hard-rock
mindlessness, a la Ronnie Mon
trose.
While Frampton occasionally
proves he is capable of such re
petitious excess, it is more often
his tasteful and versatile guitar
which delivers this album from
mediocrity and provides us with
an exciting and satisfying an
thology of a musician emerging
to stardom after 10 years.
Frampton is probably the best
of the third-generation British
rockers and holds his position by

virtue of instrumental profi
ciency. His songs are decep
tively simple in form and chord
progression, but the intricate
weaving of striking and captivat
ing guitar lines in numbers like
"Lines on My Face" or "Do You
Feel Like We Do" make his
works musically stimulating,
demonstrating that ther is
strength in simplicity.
With 10 years of classical
training and work in Humble Pie
backing him, Frampton is at his
best in tasteful phrasing.
This platinum album is cer
tainly not spared poorer mo
ments. however. Frampton toys
with a talkbox on "Do You Keel
Like We Do" and gets carried
away in conversation. In addi
tion, he threatens to lose his
thoughtful musicianship in "(I'll
give you) Money" and his matur
ity in "Show Me the Way."
Finally, one wonders whether
Frampton wi 11 ever learn to write
lyrics. Lines like "1 don't car el If
they cut my hair I All I want to be
is by your side" are embarras
sing and unworthy of his music.
These flaws fade, however,
when one returns to listen to his
guitar sing.

it's messy. His attempt at reggae,
"Soul Satisfying," sounds like a
7-1 Jp commercial. Its beat is
bouncy, its rhyming lyrics
whispered and its instrumen
tals reminiscent of the muzak
piped in at skating rinks.
The album's second side is
distinguished by curiosities —
spoofs of established musical
types and reworkings of old
material. Wyman croaks out his
Louis Armstrong imitation in
"No More FoolinV' Then there's
a speeded-up version of the old
Trini Lopez number, "If You
Wanna Be Happy." Better
synched than the original, with
reeling sax parts and energetic
back-up vocals by the Pointer
Sisters, this is one of the two
"highlights" of Wyman's
lackluster album.
The other minimal offender is
"Feet," an upbeat song with
funny lyrics and the only

noteworthy guitarwork on the
record. Danny Kortchmar's play
ful slide guitar saves this song,
probably because he wrote it.
Although there are many
styles, or rather, imitations of
styles, on his current record,
Wyman seems to have mastered
onlyone—theamusing curio.On
the whole, the instrumental
rarely surface, Wyman's voice is
monotonous and his composi
tions overly casual.
One may cite Stone Alone for
being unpretentious and claim
that Wyman plays only so that,
as he says, "you can dance if you
wanna." You can also stop buy
ing records and switch to AM.
SWEET HARMONY: Maria
Muldaur, Warner Bros.
Sweet Harmony, Maria Mul
daur's new album, is also
marked by stylistic diversity.
Happily, in this case, the re
cord's quality doesn't suffer for
the sake of its varied selection.
Even sworn enemies of all that is
languid and laid-back in pop
music should appreciate Mul
daur's expertise.
Possessing vocal command
and versatility, she vitalizes the
gospel, the ballad, the '30s
show tune, the New Orleans and
the swing sounds. Her charac
teristic sliding vocals are less
common in this than in earlier
work.
And in several faster songs.
Muldaur proves that she can
swing with the best of them. In
one foot-stamping gospel tune.
Muldaur wails in orgasmic
ecstasy, singing "when you
make love to me all night long, I
can't stand it."
She forgoes her typically
seductive manner to sing plainly
and dynamically in the ballad of
"Jon the Generator," akin in
spirit to Carol King's similarly
upbeat, similarly narrated,
"Smack Water Jack."
Muldaur succeeds, on her
latest record, with a wide range
of songs, any one of which might
be the redeeming cut on a lesser
album. To complement a diet of
hard rock or to round out a mel
lower regime, take Sweet Har
mony auditorily.

AL r RORA. Jean-Luc Ponty,
Atlantic
In Switzerland. 1966. four of
the world's finest jazz violinists
met to produce an extraordinary
concert and subsequent album.
Violin Summel. Three of the
musicians were over 50 years
old, but one was a strikingly
young (24 years old) and new in
fluence named Jean-Luc Ponty,
who had not as yet released an
album but had nonetheless
placed first in Down Beat's jazz
critic's poll.
Since that day, Ponty has
taken an unusual course for the
only violinist ever to capture the
Coltrane spirit. He has served in
ternships in the Mahavishnu Or
chestra as well as the Elton John
Hand, released a number of solo
albums and become increas
ingly influenced by rock.
Last year, his first album for
Atlantic, Upon the Wings of
Music, was released. It was his
first all-out attempt at creating a
jazz-rock fusion of his own. Poli
ty's second album, Aurora, is
now upon us. While it suffers
from some uneveness, it is over
all an amazing and captivating
testament to Polity's virtuosity

and imagination.
Aurora experiments more
with studio effects and
techniques — overdubbing,
phase shifters, wah-wah — than
do previous albums, but never
exploits these tools to the point
of gimmickery. His last album
suffered from an inability to
maintain the subtlety and vari
ety of jazz under the foursquare
drumming and simpler chord
patterns of rock.
Ponty and band play acousti
cally, and his violin is dubbed
into a string chorus. Together,
they conjure up visions of a
Tolkien-like lantasy world.
Throughout the album, Ponty's
skill at coaxing varied textures
from his instrument and techni
cal virtuosity are striking.
Ponty remains the finest elec
tric violinist in the world today,
and Aurora is a worthy effort
from this musical pioneer.
DESTROYER. Kiss, Casablanca
Things had looked almost
hopeful. Kiss, four black-and
silver faced, spike-and-leather
rebels of theatre-rock, had repor
tedly realized that musicians
generally stay more successful if
able to play music. Rather than
fire themselves and hire four

competents, however, they
chose to take up Bob Erzin's
(Alice Cooper notoriety) offer to
produce their album.
This "New Direction" piece of
vinyl is appropriately titled De
stroyer, and shows that
superhuman producing efforts
can compensate only slightly for
a glaring lack of talent.
Erzin's efforts are heaped onto
Destroyer. We have Kiss and
organ interlude, Kiss and or
chestra, Kiss and chorus, but,
unfortunately, we still have Kiss.
Erzin's carefully structured mus
ical gimmicks are too often top
pled by a single inane, nonsensi
cal guitar solo from Ace Frehley.
The group even makes an at
tempt to shoot for MOR in
"Beth," but only succeeds in
contrasting a lush string ar
rangement with Peter Criss'
weak, gravel-throated vocals.
We find that Kiss is strongest
singing in harmony, as no
member is capable of a really
good solo.
There are a few rare moments,
however, when the Erzin plan
works,noticeably in a song like
"Flaming Youth," which offers
stylistic variation and hints of

more subtle musical interplay.
With more i;are and thought.
Kiss could consistently bring us
the raucous infectiousness of a
punk-rock group like Sweet.
Senseless repetition and lack
of development too often charac
terize their work, however, and
without improvement in this
area, the four boys may realize
their own lyric: "1 got to laugh
'cause I know I'm gonna die."
FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE;
Peter Frampton. A & M
Upon observing Frampton's
glassy eyes, gaping mouth and
primal plumage, one unfamiliar
with his work might expect him
to begin flailing away at his Les
Paul in an orgy of hard-rock
mindlessness, a la Ronnie Mon
trose.
While Frampton occasionally
proves he is capable of such re
petitious excess, it is more often
his tasteful and versatile guitar
which delivers this album from
mediocrity and provides us with
an exciting and satisfying an
thology of a musician emerging
to stardom after 10 years.
Frampton is probably the best
of the third-generation British
rockers and holds his position by

virtue of instrumental profi
ciency. His songs are decep
tively simple in form and chord
progression, but the intricate
weaving of striking and captivat
ing guitar lines in numbers like
"Lines on My Face" or "Do You
Feel Like We Do" make his
works musically stimulating,
demonstrating that ther is
strength in simplicity.
With 10 years of classical
training and work in Humble Pie
backing him, Frampton is at his
best in tasteful phrasing.
This platinum album is cer
tainly not spared poorer mo
ments. however. Frampton toys
with a talkbox on "Do You Keel
Like We Do" and gets carried
away in conversation. In addi
tion, he threatens to lose his
thoughtful musicianship in "(I'll
give you) Money" and his matur
ity in "Show Me the Way."
Finally, one wonders whether
Frampton wi 11 ever learn to write
lyrics. Lines like "1 don't car el If
they cut my hair I All I want to be
is by your side" are embarras
sing and unworthy of his music.
These flaws fade, however,
when one returns to listen to his
guitar sing.

STONE ALONE: Bill Wyman.
Rolling Stones Records
Bill Wyman's most recent
album is called Stone Alone, and
it ain't rollin' nowhere. It's nice
that some of the less-lauded
Boys in the Bands are making
their own records; solo albums
by such musicians as Ron Wood,
Bob Weir, Billy Cobham and
Marty Balin have spotlighted the
relatively low-profile members
of stellar rock groups.
However, in the case of Bill
Wyman and the Stones, I wish
he'd take his bass back into the
shadows, let Mick sing and
Keith compose.
On Stons Alone, Wyman has
attempted to represent a variety
of musical styles: rock, country
honk, reggae and the humorous
ditty. The first side of the album
might more accurately be called
a pastiche of the boring, the
mediocre and the pathetic. "A
Quarter to Three" is a '50s
style rock'n'roll number, passa
ble because of Van Morrison's
swinging sax.
Wyman's voice is flat and
sounds as if he has a speech im
pediment, which he, unlike Jag
ger, can't use to his advantage.

rarely surface, Wyman's voice is
monotonous and his composi
tions overly casual.
One may cite Stone Alone for
being unpretentious and claim
that Wyman plays only so that,
as he says, "you can dance if you
wanna." You can also stop buy
ing records and switch to AM.
SWEET HARMONY: Maria
Muldaur, Warner Bros.
Sweet Harmony, Maria Mul
daur's new album, is also
marked by stylistic diversity.
Happily, in this case, the re
cord's quality doesn't suffer for
the sake of its varied selection.
Even sworn enemies of all that is
languid and laid-back in pop
music should appreciate Mul
daur's expertise.
Possessing vocal command
and versatility, she vitalizes the
gospel, the ballad, the '30s
show tune, the New Orleans and
the swing sounds. Her charac
teristic sliding vocals are less
common in this than in earlier
work.
And in several faster songs.
Muldaur proves that she can
swing with the best of them. In
one foot-stamping gospel tune.
Muldaur wails in orgasmic
ecstasy, singing "when you
make love to me all night long, I
can't stand it."
She forgoes her typically
seductive manner to sing plainly
and dynamically in the ballad of
"Jon the Generator," akin in
spirit to Carol King's similarly
upbeat, similarly narrated,
"Smack Water Jack."
Muldaur succeeds, on her
latest record, with a wide range
of songs, any one of which might
be the redeeming cut on a lesser
album. To complement a diet of
hard rock or to round out a mel
lower regime, take Sweet Har
mony auditorily.

AL r RORA. Jean-Luc Ponty,
Atlantic
In Switzerland. 1966. four of
the world's finest jazz violinists
met to produce an extraordinary
concert and subsequent album.
Violin Summel. Three of the
musicians were over 50 years
old, but one was a strikingly
young (24 years old) and new in
fluence named Jean-Luc Ponty,
who had not as yet released an
album but had nonetheless
placed first in Down Beat's jazz
critic's poll.
Since that day, Ponty has
taken an unusual course for the
only violinist ever to capture the
Coltrane spirit. He has served in
ternships in the Mahavishnu Or
chestra as well as the Elton John
Hand, released a number of solo
albums and become increas
ingly influenced by rock.
Last year, his first album for
Atlantic, Upon the Wings of
Music, was released. It was his
first all-out attempt at creating a
jazz-rock fusion of his own. Poli
ty's second album, Aurora, is
now upon us. While it suffers
from some uneveness, it is over
all an amazing and captivating
testament to Polity's virtuosity

and imagination.
Aurora experiments more
with studio effects and
techniques — overdubbing,
phase shifters, wah-wah — than
do previous albums, but never
exploits these tools to the point
of gimmickery. His last album
suffered from an inability to
maintain the subtlety and vari
ety of jazz under the foursquare
drumming and simpler chord
patterns of rock.
Ponty and band play acousti
cally, and his violin is dubbed
into a string chorus. Together,
they conjure up visions of a
Tolkien-like lantasy world.
Throughout the album, Ponty's
skill at coaxing varied textures
from his instrument and techni
cal virtuosity are striking.
Ponty remains the finest elec
tric violinist in the world today,
and Aurora is a worthy effort
from this musical pioneer.
DESTROYER. Kiss, Casablanca
Things had looked almost
hopeful. Kiss, four black-and
silver faced, spike-and-leather
rebels of theatre-rock, had repor
tedly realized that musicians
generally stay more successful if
able to play music. Rather than
fire themselves and hire four

competents, however, they
chose to take up Bob Erzin's
(Alice Cooper notoriety) offer to
produce their album.
This "New Direction" piece of
vinyl is appropriately titled De
stroyer, and shows that
superhuman producing efforts
can compensate only slightly for
a glaring lack of talent.
Erzin's efforts are heaped onto
Destroyer. We have Kiss and
organ interlude, Kiss and or
chestra, Kiss and chorus, but,
unfortunately, we still have Kiss.
Erzin's carefully structured mus
ical gimmicks are too often top
pled by a single inane, nonsensi
cal guitar solo from Ace Frehley.
The group even makes an at
tempt to shoot for MOR in
"Beth," but only succeeds in
contrasting a lush string ar
rangement with Peter Criss'
weak, gravel-throated vocals.
We find that Kiss is strongest
singing in harmony, as no
member is capable of a really
good solo.
There are a few rare moments,
however, when the Erzin plan
works,noticeably in a song like
"Flaming Youth," which offers
stylistic variation and hints of

more subtle musical interplay.
With more i;are and thought.
Kiss could consistently bring us
the raucous infectiousness of a
punk-rock group like Sweet.
Senseless repetition and lack
of development too often charac
terize their work, however, and
without improvement in this
area, the four boys may realize
their own lyric: "1 got to laugh
'cause I know I'm gonna die."
FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE;
Peter Frampton. A & M
Upon observing Frampton's
glassy eyes, gaping mouth and
primal plumage, one unfamiliar
with his work might expect him
to begin flailing away at his Les
Paul in an orgy of hard-rock
mindlessness, a la Ronnie Mon
trose.
While Frampton occasionally
proves he is capable of such re
petitious excess, it is more often
his tasteful and versatile guitar
which delivers this album from
mediocrity and provides us with
an exciting and satisfying an
thology of a musician emerging
to stardom after 10 years.
Frampton is probably the best
of the third-generation British
rockers and holds his position by

virtue of instrumental profi
ciency. His songs are decep
tively simple in form and chord
progression, but the intricate
weaving of striking and captivat
ing guitar lines in numbers like
"Lines on My Face" or "Do You
Feel Like We Do" make his
works musically stimulating,
demonstrating that ther is
strength in simplicity.
With 10 years of classical
training and work in Humble Pie
backing him, Frampton is at his
best in tasteful phrasing.
This platinum album is cer
tainly not spared poorer mo
ments. however. Frampton toys
with a talkbox on "Do You Keel
Like We Do" and gets carried
away in conversation. In addi
tion, he threatens to lose his
thoughtful musicianship in "(I'll
give you) Money" and his matur
ity in "Show Me the Way."
Finally, one wonders whether
Frampton wi 11 ever learn to write
lyrics. Lines like "1 don't car el If
they cut my hair I All I want to be
is by your side" are embarras
sing and unworthy of his music.
These flaws fade, however,
when one returns to listen to his
guitar sing.

STONE ALONE: Bill Wyman.
Rolling Stones Records
Bill Wyman's most recent
album is called Stone Alone, and
it ain't rollin' nowhere. It's nice
that some of the less-lauded
Boys in the Bands are making
their own records; solo albums
by such musicians as Ron Wood,
Bob Weir, Billy Cobham and
Marty Balin have spotlighted the
relatively low-profile members
of stellar rock groups.
However, in the case of Bill
Wyman and the Stones, I wish
he'd take his bass back into the
shadows, let Mick sing and
Keith compose.
On Stons Alone, Wyman has
attempted to represent a variety
of musical styles: rock, country
honk, reggae and the humorous
ditty. The first side of the album
might more accurately be called
a pastiche of the boring, the
mediocre and the pathetic. "A
Quarter to Three" is a '50s
style rock'n'roll number, passa
ble because of Van Morrison's
swinging sax.
Wyman's voice is flat and
sounds as if he has a speech im
pediment, which he, unlike Jag
ger, can't use to his advantage.
Wyman's slur isn't expressive:
it's messy. His attempt at reggae,
"Soul Satisfying," sounds like a
7-1 Jp commercial. Its beat is
bouncy, its rhyming lyrics
whispered and its instrumen
tals reminiscent of the muzak
piped in at skating rinks.
The album's second side is
distinguished by curiosities —
spoofs of established musical
types and reworkings of old
material. Wyman croaks out his
Louis Armstrong imitation in
"No More FoolinV' Then there's
a speeded-up version of the old
Trini Lopez number, "If You
Wanna Be Happy." Better
synched than the original, with
reeling sax parts and energetic
back-up vocals by the Pointer
Sisters, this is one of the two
"highlights" of Wyman's
lackluster album.
The other minimal offender is
"Feet," an upbeat song with
funny lyrics and the only

noteworthy guitarwork on the
record. Danny Kortchmar's play
ful slide guitar saves this song,
probably because he wrote it.
Although there are many
styles, or rather, imitations of
styles, on his current record,
Wyman seems to have mastered
onlyone—theamusing curio.On
the whole, the instrumental
rarely surface, Wyman's voice is
monotonous and his composi
tions overly casual.
One may cite Stone Alone for
being unpretentious and claim
that Wyman plays only so that,

can't stand it."
She forgoes her typically
seductive manner to sing plainly
and dynamically in the ballad of
"Jon the Generator," akin in
spirit to Carol King's similarly
upbeat, similarly narrated,
"Smack Water Jack."
Muldaur succeeds, on her
latest record, with a wide range
of songs, any one of which might
be the redeeming cut on a lesser
album. To complement a diet of
hard rock or to round out a mel
lower regime, take Sweet Har
mony auditorily.

AL r RORA. Jean-Luc Ponty,
Atlantic
In Switzerland. 1966. four of
the world's finest jazz violinists
met to produce an extraordinary
concert and subsequent album.
Violin Summel. Three of the
musicians were over 50 years
old, but one was a strikingly
young (24 years old) and new in
fluence named Jean-Luc Ponty,
who had not as yet released an
album but had nonetheless
placed first in Down Beat's jazz
critic's poll.
Since that day, Ponty has
taken an unusual course for the
only violinist ever to capture the
Coltrane spirit. He has served in
ternships in the Mahavishnu Or
chestra as well as the Elton John
Hand, released a number of solo
albums and become increas
ingly influenced by rock.
Last year, his first album for
Atlantic, Upon the Wings of
Music, was released. It was his
first all-out attempt at creating a
jazz-rock fusion of his own. Poli
ty's second album, Aurora, is
now upon us. While it suffers
from some uneveness, it is over
all an amazing and captivating
testament to Polity's virtuosity

and imagination.
Aurora experiments more
with studio effects and
techniques — overdubbing,
phase shifters, wah-wah — than
do previous albums, but never
exploits these tools to the point
of gimmickery. His last album
suffered from an inability to
maintain the subtlety and vari
ety of jazz under the foursquare
drumming and simpler chord
patterns of rock.
Ponty and band play acousti
cally, and his violin is dubbed
into a string chorus. Together,
they conjure up visions of a
Tolkien-like lantasy world.
Throughout the album, Ponty's
skill at coaxing varied textures
from his instrument and techni
cal virtuosity are striking.
Ponty remains the finest elec
tric violinist in the world today,
and Aurora is a worthy effort
from this musical pioneer.
DESTROYER. Kiss, Casablanca
Things had looked almost
hopeful. Kiss, four black-and
silver faced, spike-and-leather
rebels of theatre-rock, had repor
tedly realized that musicians
generally stay more successful if
able to play music. Rather than
fire themselves and hire four

competents, however, they
chose to take up Bob Erzin's
(Alice Cooper notoriety) offer to
produce their album.
This "New Direction" piece of
vinyl is appropriately titled De
stroyer, and shows that
superhuman producing efforts
can compensate only slightly for
a glaring lack of talent.
Erzin's efforts are heaped onto
Destroyer. We have Kiss and
organ interlude, Kiss and or
chestra, Kiss and chorus, but,
unfortunately, we still have Kiss.
Erzin's carefully structured mus
ical gimmicks are too often top
pled by a single inane, nonsensi
cal guitar solo from Ace Frehley.
The group even makes an at
tempt to shoot for MOR in
"Beth," but only succeeds in
contrasting a lush string ar
rangement with Peter Criss'
weak, gravel-throated vocals.
We find that Kiss is strongest
singing in harmony, as no
member is capable of a really
good solo.
There are a few rare moments,
however, when the Erzin plan
works,noticeably in a song like
"Flaming Youth," which offers
stylistic variation and hints of

more subtle musical interplay.
With more i;are and thought.
Kiss could consistently bring us
the raucous infectiousness of a
punk-rock group like Sweet.
Senseless repetition and lack
of development too often charac
terize their work, however, and
without improvement in this
area, the four boys may realize
their own lyric: "1 got to laugh
'cause I know I'm gonna die."
FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE;
Peter Frampton. A & M
Upon observing Frampton's
glassy eyes, gaping mouth and
primal plumage, one unfamiliar
with his work might expect him
to begin flailing away at his Les
Paul in an orgy of hard-rock
mindlessness, a la Ronnie Mon
trose.
While Frampton occasionally
proves he is capable of such re
petitious excess, it is more often
his tasteful and versatile guitar
which delivers this album from
mediocrity and provides us with
an exciting and satisfying an
thology of a musician emerging
to stardom after 10 years.
Frampton is probably the best
of the third-generation British
rockers and holds his position by

virtue of instrumental profi
ciency. His songs are decep
tively simple in form and chord
progression, but the intricate
weaving of striking and captivat
ing guitar lines in numbers like
"Lines on My Face" or "Do You
Feel Like We Do" make his
works musically stimulating,
demonstrating that ther is
strength in simplicity.
With 10 years of classical
training and work in Humble Pie
backing him, Frampton is at his
best in tasteful phrasing.
This platinum album is cer
tainly not spared poorer mo
ments. however. Frampton toys
with a talkbox on "Do You Keel
Like We Do" and gets carried
away in conversation. In addi
tion, he threatens to lose his
thoughtful musicianship in "(I'll
give you) Money" and his matur
ity in "Show Me the Way."
Finally, one wonders whether
Frampton wi 11 ever learn to write
lyrics. Lines like "1 don't car el If
they cut my hair I All I want to be
is by your side" are embarras
sing and unworthy of his music.
These flaws fade, however,
when one returns to listen to his
guitar sing.

ROCK —Kiss, four black arid silver faced, spike and leather rebels of theatre-rock have released a
new album called Destroyer.
STONE ALONE: Bill Wyman.
Rolling Stones Records
Bill Wyman's most recent
album is called Stone Alone, and
it ain't rollin' nowhere. It's nice
that some of the less-lauded
Boys in the Bands are making
their own records; solo albums
by such musicians as Ron Wood,
Bob Weir, Billy Cobham and
Marty Balin have spotlighted the
relatively low-profile members
of stellar rock groups.
However, in the case of Bill
Wyman and the Stones, I wish
he'd take his bass back into the
shadows, let Mick sing and
Keith compose.
On Stons Alone, Wyman has
attempted to represent a variety
of musical styles: rock, country
honk, reggae and the humorous
ditty. The first side of the album
might more accurately be called
a pastiche of the boring, the
mediocre and the pathetic. "A
Quarter to Three" is a '50s
style rock'n'roll number, passa
ble because of Van Morrison's
swinging sax.
Wyman's voice is flat and
sounds as if he has a speech im
pediment, which he, unlike Jag
ger, can't use to his advantage.
Wyman's slur isn't expressive:
it's messy. His attempt at reggae,
"Soul Satisfying," sounds like a
7-1 Jp commercial. Its beat is
bouncy, its rhyming lyrics
whispered and its instrumen
tals reminiscent of the muzak
piped in at skating rinks.
The album's second side is
distinguished by curiosities —
spoofs of established musical
types and reworkings of old
material. Wyman croaks out his
Louis Armstrong imitation in
"No More FoolinV' Then there's
a speeded-up version of the old
Trini Lopez number, "If You
Wanna Be Happy." Better
synched than the original, with
reeling sax parts and energetic
back-up vocals by the Pointer
Sisters, this is one of the two
"highlights" of Wyman's
lackluster album.
The other minimal offender is
"Feet," an upbeat song with
funny lyrics and the only

noteworthy guitarwork on the
record. Danny Kortchmar's play
ful slide guitar saves this song,
probably because he wrote it.
Although there are many
styles, or rather, imitations of
styles, on his current record,
Wyman seems to have mastered
onlyone—theamusing curio.On
the whole, the instrumental
rarely surface, Wyman's voice is
monotonous and his composi
tions overly casual.
One may cite Stone Alone for
being unpretentious and claim
that Wyman plays only so that,
as he says, "you can dance if you
wanna." You can also stop buy
ing records and switch to AM.
SWEET HARMONY: Maria
Muldaur, Warner Bros.
Sweet Harmony, Maria Mul
daur's new album, is also
marked by stylistic diversity.
Happily, in this case, the re
cord's quality doesn't suffer for
the sake of its varied selection.
Even sworn enemies of all that is
languid and laid-back in pop
music should appreciate Mul
daur's expertise.
Possessing vocal command
and versatility, she vitalizes the
gospel, the ballad, the '30s
show tune, the New Orleans and
the swing sounds. Her charac
teristic sliding vocals are less
common in this than in earlier
work.
And in several faster songs.
Muldaur proves that she can
swing with the best of them. In
one foot-stamping gospel tune.
Muldaur wails in orgasmic
ecstasy, singing "when you
make love to me all night long, I
can't stand it."
She forgoes her typically
seductive manner to sing plainly
and dynamically in the ballad of
"Jon the Generator," akin in
spirit to Carol King's similarly
upbeat, similarly narrated,
"Smack Water Jack."

chestra as well as the Elton John
Hand, released a number of solo
albums and become increas
ingly influenced by rock.
Last year, his first album for
Atlantic, Upon the Wings of
Music, was released. It was his
first all-out attempt at creating a
jazz-rock fusion of his own. Poli
ty's second album, Aurora, is
now upon us. While it suffers
from some uneveness, it is over
all an amazing and captivating
testament to Polity's virtuosity

and imagination.
Aurora experiments more
with studio effects and
techniques — overdubbing,
phase shifters, wah-wah — than
do previous albums, but never
exploits these tools to the point
of gimmickery. His last album
suffered from an inability to
maintain the subtlety and vari
ety of jazz under the foursquare
drumming and simpler chord
patterns of rock.
Ponty and band play acousti
cally, and his violin is dubbed
into a string chorus. Together,
they conjure up visions of a
Tolkien-like lantasy world.
Throughout the album, Ponty's
skill at coaxing varied textures
from his instrument and techni
cal virtuosity are striking.
Ponty remains the finest elec
tric violinist in the world today,
and Aurora is a worthy effort
from this musical pioneer.
DESTROYER. Kiss, Casablanca
Things had looked almost
hopeful. Kiss, four black-and
silver faced, spike-and-leather
rebels of theatre-rock, had repor
tedly realized that musicians
generally stay more successful if
able to play music. Rather than
fire themselves and hire four

competents, however, they
chose to take up Bob Erzin's
(Alice Cooper notoriety) offer to
produce their album.
This "New Direction" piece of
vinyl is appropriately titled De
stroyer, and shows that
superhuman producing efforts
can compensate only slightly for
a glaring lack of talent.
Erzin's efforts are heaped onto
Destroyer. We have Kiss and
organ interlude, Kiss and or
chestra, Kiss and chorus, but,
unfortunately, we still have Kiss.
Erzin's carefully structured mus
ical gimmicks are too often top
pled by a single inane, nonsensi
cal guitar solo from Ace Frehley.
The group even makes an at
tempt to shoot for MOR in
"Beth," but only succeeds in
contrasting a lush string ar
rangement with Peter Criss'
weak, gravel-throated vocals.
We find that Kiss is strongest
singing in harmony, as no
member is capable of a really
good solo.
There are a few rare moments,
however, when the Erzin plan
works,noticeably in a song like
"Flaming Youth," which offers
stylistic variation and hints of

more subtle musical interplay.
With more i;are and thought.
Kiss could consistently bring us
the raucous infectiousness of a
punk-rock group like Sweet.
Senseless repetition and lack
of development too often charac
terize their work, however, and
without improvement in this
area, the four boys may realize
their own lyric: "1 got to laugh
'cause I know I'm gonna die."
FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE;
Peter Frampton. A & M
Upon observing Frampton's
glassy eyes, gaping mouth and
primal plumage, one unfamiliar
with his work might expect him
to begin flailing away at his Les
Paul in an orgy of hard-rock
mindlessness, a la Ronnie Mon
trose.
While Frampton occasionally
proves he is capable of such re
petitious excess, it is more often
his tasteful and versatile guitar
which delivers this album from
mediocrity and provides us with
an exciting and satisfying an
thology of a musician emerging
to stardom after 10 years.
Frampton is probably the best
of the third-generation British
rockers and holds his position by

virtue of instrumental profi
ciency. His songs are decep
tively simple in form and chord
progression, but the intricate
weaving of striking and captivat
ing guitar lines in numbers like
"Lines on My Face" or "Do You
Feel Like We Do" make his
works musically stimulating,
demonstrating that ther is
strength in simplicity.
With 10 years of classical
training and work in Humble Pie
backing him, Frampton is at his
best in tasteful phrasing.
This platinum album is cer
tainly not spared poorer mo
ments. however. Frampton toys
with a talkbox on "Do You Keel
Like We Do" and gets carried
away in conversation. In addi
tion, he threatens to lose his
thoughtful musicianship in "(I'll
give you) Money" and his matur
ity in "Show Me the Way."
Finally, one wonders whether
Frampton wi 11 ever learn to write
lyrics. Lines like "1 don't car el If
they cut my hair I All I want to be
is by your side" are embarras
sing and unworthy of his music.
These flaws fade, however,
when one returns to listen to his
guitar sing.

new album called Destroyer.
STONE ALONE: Bill Wyman.
Rolling Stones Records
Bill Wyman's most recent
album is called Stone Alone, and
it ain't rollin' nowhere. It's nice
that some of the less-lauded
Boys in the Bands are making
their own records; solo albums
by such musicians as Ron Wood,
Bob Weir, Billy Cobham and
Marty Balin have spotlighted the
relatively low-profile members
of stellar rock groups.
However, in the case of Bill
Wyman and the Stones, I wish
he'd take his bass back into the
shadows, let Mick sing and
Keith compose.
On Stons Alone, Wyman has
attempted to represent a variety
of musical styles: rock, country
honk, reggae and the humorous
ditty. The first side of the album
might more accurately be called
a pastiche of the boring, the
mediocre and the pathetic. "A
Quarter to Three" is a '50s
style rock'n'roll number, passa
ble because of Van Morrison's
swinging sax.
Wyman's voice is flat and
sounds as if he has a speech im
pediment, which he, unlike Jag
ger, can't use to his advantage.
Wyman's slur isn't expressive:
it's messy. His attempt at reggae,
"Soul Satisfying," sounds like a
7-1 Jp commercial. Its beat is
bouncy, its rhyming lyrics
whispered and its instrumen
tals reminiscent of the muzak
piped in at skating rinks.
The album's second side is
distinguished by curiosities —
spoofs of established musical
types and reworkings of old
material. Wyman croaks out his
Louis Armstrong imitation in
"No More FoolinV' Then there's
a speeded-up version of the old
Trini Lopez number, "If You
Wanna Be Happy." Better
synched than the original, with
reeling sax parts and energetic
back-up vocals by the Pointer
Sisters, this is one of the two
"highlights" of Wyman's
lackluster album.
The other minimal offender is
"Feet," an upbeat song with
funny lyrics and the only

noteworthy guitarwork on the
record. Danny Kortchmar's play
ful slide guitar saves this song,
probably because he wrote it.
Although there are many
styles, or rather, imitations of
styles, on his current record,
Wyman seems to have mastered
onlyone—theamusing curio.On
the whole, the instrumental
rarely surface, Wyman's voice is
monotonous and his composi
tions overly casual.
One may cite Stone Alone for
being unpretentious and claim
that Wyman plays only so that,
as he says, "you can dance if you
wanna." You can also stop buy
ing records and switch to AM.
SWEET HARMONY: Maria
Muldaur, Warner Bros.
Sweet Harmony, Maria Mul
daur's new album, is also
marked by stylistic diversity.
Happily, in this case, the re
cord's quality doesn't suffer for
the sake of its varied selection.
Even sworn enemies of all that is
languid and laid-back in pop
music should appreciate Mul
daur's expertise.
Possessing vocal command
and versatility, she vitalizes the
gospel, the ballad, the '30s
show tune, the New Orleans and
the swing sounds. Her charac
teristic sliding vocals are less
common in this than in earlier
work.
And in several faster songs.
Muldaur proves that she can
swing with the best of them. In
one foot-stamping gospel tune.
Muldaur wails in orgasmic
ecstasy, singing "when you
make love to me all night long, I
can't stand it."
She forgoes her typically
seductive manner to sing plainly
and dynamically in the ballad of
"Jon the Generator," akin in
spirit to Carol King's similarly
upbeat, similarly narrated,
"Smack Water Jack."
Muldaur succeeds, on her
latest record, with a wide range
of songs, any one of which might
be the redeeming cut on a lesser
album. To complement a diet of
hard rock or to round out a mel
lower regime, take Sweet Har
mony auditorily.

AL r RORA. Jean-Luc Ponty,
Atlantic
In Switzerland. 1966. four of
the world's finest jazz violinists
met to produce an extraordinary
concert and subsequent album.
Violin Summel. Three of the
musicians were over 50 years
old, but one was a strikingly
young (24 years old) and new in
fluence named Jean-Luc Ponty,
who had not as yet released an
album but had nonetheless
placed first in Down Beat's jazz
critic's poll.
Since that day, Ponty has
taken an unusual course for the
only violinist ever to capture the
Coltrane spirit. He has served in
ternships in the Mahavishnu Or
chestra as well as the Elton John
Hand, released a number of solo
albums and become increas
ingly influenced by rock.
Last year, his first album for
Atlantic, Upon the Wings of
Music, was released. It was his
