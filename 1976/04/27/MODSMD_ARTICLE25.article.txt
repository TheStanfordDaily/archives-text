Socialists lead in Portugal
LISBON, Portugal — The way was open yester
day for ouster of Moscow-line Communists from
the Portuguese government for the first time in two
years, following parliamentary elections.
Pressure mounted for a center-left coalition
under Socialist leadership to counter political in
stability threatened by the results of Sunday's vote.
All major parties rejected any coalition with the
Communists.
While the Socialist party was the leader in the
balloting among 14 parties competing for 263 par
liament seats, it lacked the muscle needed to gov
ern alone.
With nearly all votes counted, the Socialists had
36.9 percent of valid ballots cast. The Popular
Democrats (PPD) had 24.99 percent, the conserva
tive Social Democratic Center won 16.48 percent
and the Moscow-line Communists had 15.51 per
cent.
Clue found to Hughes will
LOS ANGELES — A letter signed by the late
billionaire Howard Hughes was filed yesterday in
Superior Court indicating he deposited a will in a
Texas bank in 1938.
The letter was one of several documents — in
cluding material detailing the worldwide search
for a Hughes will — filed in connection with a
declaration seeking that Richard Gano Jr. be named
sole administrator of the vast Hughes estate in Los
Angeles County. His holdings here have been esti
mated at $1 billion.
In the documents, Gano states that Hughes offi
cials have as yet been unable to find a safe-deposit
box which Hughes said contained his will.
However, he said, he is advised there is "no
known evidence indicating that such a will was
revoked or destroyed."
Gano also said that Hughes officials have con
ducted "an exhaustive worldwide search of build
ings, records storage areas, file rooms, vaults, air
craft hangars and other possible locations of evi
dence. . . ."

He said that because of the "enormous volume of
records, which must be searched through, much
work remains to be done."
