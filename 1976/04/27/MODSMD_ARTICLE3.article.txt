# The 						Seeley Mudd Chem Building
## 'Earthquake-resistant design'

The Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry
Building, scheduled to be com
pleted in October, "is designed to
withstand a 1906 earthquake," ac
cording to Hirge Clark, the build
ing's architect.
Concrete columns within the
building will aid in the stability of
the structure and in absorbing
shock should an earthquake strike,
Clark said. The present chemistry
building is not capable of with
standing an earthquake of consid
erable magnitude and is not very

safe, he commented.
The move from the present
chemistry building to the Mudd
building will be made in December,
according to Clark.
With a floor space of 85,000
square feet, or two acres, the $7
million Mudd building has been
designed with the safety of the
occupants in mind, said Clark.
'Spartan' interior
"The interior of the building is
very spartan," he said, "but the
University did not spare any ex

penses with respect to the size and
the safety of the building."
The building is designed to be as
similar as possible to the Quad
buildings, with special touches in
cluded to cut costs to a minimum.
Sandblasted and painted concrete
will give the appearance of the
stone that composes theQuadbuild
ings, while the same
Mediterranean-style tile roofs will
top the structure.
The first floor will contain ad
ministrative offices, professors'
labs and offices and two lecture
halls with seating capacities of 296
and 114.
The second floor will house 16
labs — all devoted to under
graduate studies and research. The
floor space of these labs will help to
alleviate the crowding that exists in
the present chemistry labs, Clark
said, noting that there will be about
twice the working area per student
in comparison to the present labs.
Exits in the labs to the inside as
well as to the outside balcony and
stairways will facilitate evacuation
in case of fire.
Air turnover
Hoods in all laboratories will
have an air turnover at a rate of
every 3V2 minutes. To..fc chemicals
and volatile solvents will be chan
neled a way at a far greater rate than
at present, according to Clark.
Plans call for the third floor of the
building to be used for graduate re
search and classes. The basement
will contain a lounge for chemistry
students.
The lounge will be put in the
basement because the basement
"will be open at all hours while the
rest of the building will be locked
up after working hours." Clark
explained.
"Student uproars have caused
design complications for us — it
would be much nicer to have the
lounge in the main floor, but for
security reasons we are forced to
put it in a place like the basement,"
he commented.
"I graduated from Stanford in
1914," said Clark. "Things were
much simpler then."
