## 
### Lori Matsukawa 
The ASSU Senate last night certified
the results of the recent ASSU elec
tions, thus confirming the validity of
the elections and the accuracy of the
results.
The certification means the Vic Pet
roff slate is the official Council of Pres
idents (COP), the Mike Dorsey slate
will be the senior class officers and the
six fee assessments which were passed
by students are official.
Sen. Carole Houck, one of the new
ASSU vice presidents, resigned as a
senator. He •it m ill be filled by Bar
bara RizzaHi
Sen. Kevin McDermott questioned
the certification of the fee assessment
for the ASSU Speakers Bureau because
the assessment was not publicized in
the Daily within 14-21 days before it
appeared on the April 14-15 ballot.

"The senate has violated the con
stitution," said McDermott. "If we can
change the constitution whenever we
wish, we may as well not have a con
stitution at all. We should simply
throw it away."
'No run-off election*
ASSIJ Elections Commissioner
Mike Murray replied, "Even though
we knew it violated the constitution, at
the time (of the last senate meeting) it
looked like there would be no run-off
election. Therefore, we wanted the
Speakers Bureau assessment on the
April 14-1 5 ballot."
Sen. Bruce Reznic.k. a graduate stu
dent, questioned Murray about the
legitimacy of the Escondido Village
polling place.

that "a polling place in Escondido Vil
lage would not significantly help to
get graduate students to vote."
"I don't want to question your hon

seemed that this year's elections were
a close horserace at most of the other
polls except for one place (Escondido
Village) where the vote was almost 8-1
(in favor of one slate)."
Murray said that the by-laws allow
the elections commissioner to put
polls wherever he wants, "which is

unfortunate."

Sen. Kevin McDermott questioned
the certification of the fee assessment
for the ASSU Speakers Bureau because
the assessment was not publicized in
the Daily within 14-21 days before it
appeared on the April 14-15 ballot.

"The senate has violated the con
stitution," said McDermott. "If we can
change the constitution whenever we
wish, we may as well not have a con
stitution at all. We should simply
throw it away."

(in favor of one slate)."
Murray said that the by-laws allow
the elections commissioner to put
