# Jennings won't quit grad council
## 
### William Sposato 
Newly elected ASSU Vice President Deric Jennings said
yesterday he will not resign from his post as chairman of
the Graduate Student Council (GSC) at this time.
Jennings said that though he would like to have some
one else take over as chairman, no one else seems willing,
and he is committed to follow through on the issue of
graduate student aid.
"This financial aids question must be resolved," said
Jennings.
He said that although he is spreading himself very thin,
he feels that pursuing his duties as chairman of the GSC is
in line with his commitments to all students as a member
of the COP.
"I do not want to see theGSC go under," said Jennings
Aids problem report
In its meeting yesterday, the GSC continued to discuss
the report bv Jennings on the aids problem. The report
examines ways that might be used to increase the amount
of fellowship and teaching assistant money for Ph.D. can
didates.
The Provost's Office is considering the establishment of
"Advanced Graduate Registration" (AGR) as one way of
increasing total aid to graduate students. This category
would cover fourth year graduate students, who now pay
only terminal graduate fees of $315 per year. Under the
AGR program, these students would instead pay one half
of normal tuition, which will be $4275 next year.
Jennings said that the AGR system would permit
heavier assessment of outside fellowship organizations
and the University staff benefits fund. This would serve to

increase the total amount of aid to graduate students, he
said.
W. Bliss Carnochan, dean of graduate studies, said that
graduate students who pay their own way would be most
heavily affected by an AGR program. But there are not
many of these students, the dean added.
'Grandfather clause'
Carnochan also said that any change in tuition for
graduate students would have a "grandfather clause"
which would exempt current students.
He said the AGR proposal would hopefully encourage
graduate students to complete their Ph.D. in four years.
The AGR proposal is scheduled to be discussed by the
Faculty Senate in its meeting today.
In other matters, members of the GSC criticized the
filing system used in the Office of Graduate Awards for
outside agencies offering fellowships.
Fellowships are now listed by the agency offering the
fellowships, which is "totally ridiculous" from the stu
dents' point of view, according to Jennings.
He pointed out that even the index for fellowships is not
arranged for student needs.
A member of the GSC also asked Carnochan what had
happened to the promise made by former Dean of
Graduate Studies Lincoln Moses concerning transcript
fees.
According to a CSC member, Moses said transcript fees,
which are $1 to $2 per transcript, would be waived for
fellowship applications. Carnochan said he would look
into the matter.

Jennings said that though he would like to have some
one else take over as chairman, no one else seems willing,
and he is committed to follow through on the issue of
graduate student aid.
"This financial aids question must be resolved," said
Jennings.
He said that although he is spreading himself very thin,
he feels that pursuing his duties as chairman of the GSC is
in line with his commitments to all students as a member
of the COP.
"I do not want to see theGSC go under," said Jennings
Aids problem report
In its meeting yesterday, the GSC continued to discuss
the report bv Jennings on the aids problem. The report
examines ways that might be used to increase the amount
of fellowship and teaching assistant money for Ph.D. can
didates.
The Provost's Office is considering the establishment of
"Advanced Graduate Registration" (AGR) as one way of
increasing total aid to graduate students. This category
would cover fourth year graduate students, who now pay
only terminal graduate fees of $315 per year. Under the
AGR program, these students would instead pay one half
of normal tuition, which will be $4275 next year.
Jennings said that the AGR system would permit
heavier assessment of outside fellowship organizations
and the University staff benefits fund. This would serve to

increase the total amount of aid to graduate students, he
said.
W. Bliss Carnochan, dean of graduate studies, said that
graduate students who pay their own way would be most
heavily affected by an AGR program. But there are not
many of these students, the dean added.
'Grandfather clause'
Carnochan also said that any change in tuition for
graduate students would have a "grandfather clause"
which would exempt current students.
He said the AGR proposal would hopefully encourage
graduate students to complete their Ph.D. in four years.
The AGR proposal is scheduled to be discussed by the
Faculty Senate in its meeting today.
In other matters, members of the GSC criticized the
filing system used in the Office of Graduate Awards for
outside agencies offering fellowships.
Fellowships are now listed by the agency offering the
fellowships, which is "totally ridiculous" from the stu
dents' point of view, according to Jennings.
He pointed out that even the index for fellowships is not
arranged for student needs.
A member of the GSC also asked Carnochan what had
happened to the promise made by former Dean of
Graduate Studies Lincoln Moses concerning transcript
fees.
According to a CSC member, Moses said transcript fees,
which are $1 to $2 per transcript, would be waived for
fellowship applications. Carnochan said he would look
into the matter.
Newly elected ASSU Vice President Deric Jennings said
yesterday he will not resign from his post as chairman of
the Graduate Student Council (GSC) at this time.
Jennings said that though he would like to have some
one else take over as chairman, no one else seems willing,
and he is committed to follow through on the issue of
graduate student aid.
