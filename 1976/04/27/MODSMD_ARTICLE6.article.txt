# Immorality of taxation

If a man came to one's door soliciting voluntary
contributions for a study of the frisbee, would one
contribute? How about a research project into the
history of comic books?
What would be his reply to a stranger who
asked one to give him $570 so that he could take a
cruise around the world? To most individuals,
who have more important ways to spend their
money, the above requests would be viewed with
contempt and rejected.
The U.S. government, however, has spent mill
ions of tax dollars for precisely these purposes.
Value is not a consideration in government
spending, whereas it is a primary consideration to
the individual. The government does not earn its
income and is not required to confine its spending
to an established budget.
List of boondoggles
Consider the following brief list of bona fide
boondoggles that have been uncovered by the Na
tional Taxpayers Union:
—$:»J0 billion given away in foreign aid since
194 5.
—$41 million to maintain the Selective Service
even though no fine was being drafted.
—$966,643 to outfit a penthouse office and
meeting room for the Postmaster Genera!.
—$170,000 for a junket by welfare adminis
trators to the Virgin Islands to study how to save
money.
—$50,000 annually for upkeep on the govern
ment's cache of three million pounds of feathers.
—$:J42,:i78 to study why unmarried college
students use birth control devices.
The list goes on and on. It is estimated that the
average household pays approximately $5,000
annually in taxes. Would one as a taxpayer volun
tarily contribute $5000 of his hard-earned dollars
to support even one of the above activities?
Does the government have the right to force one
to support expenditures of which one may not
approve? Does Congress have the right to spend
without limit?
Does one wonder why taxes are the single
largest expenditure in the average family's
budget?
Taxation immoral
Taxation is the process by which property (e.g.
money) is transfered from private sources to pub
lic (governmental) treasuries. It is the compulsory
nature of taxation, the threat of civil and/or crimi
nal prosecution for failure to comply, that makes
it immoral.

The protection of rights is a matter of defining
the limits of one actions, namely at what point
they violate the rights of others. This in no way
compels anyone to take a specific course of action,
only to observe the rights of others.
When the state demands that an individual re
linquish a portion of his assests. under penalty of
imprisonment, fines or confiscation, the state op
presses that individual. It makes no difference to
the government whether he agrees how his money
is to be spent.
This is what makes it involuntary servitude.
The issue is: Is the government t he owner of one's
life?
Fundamental right
The right of an individual to his own life is the
only fundamental right, of which the right to lib
erty and property are necessary consequences.
The protection of these rights is valuable to us all.
and so there is every reason to expect that people
would be willing to pay for this protection.
Taxation is thus not necessary to finance law
enforcement.
>o lony as government has the power to tax it
h.is Uie power to enslave, to force us to work not
tor nursi Ives but for what our governmental mas
ters think we should. Taxation is not necessary to
finance the protection of the rights of private citi
zens.
Taxation is necessary for the perpetuation and
growth of a bureaucracy which has become the
implement of our own destruction.
What can one do?
Become aware of one's rights. If one does not
defend them, the IKS will surely violate them.
Inform others, and solicit their support in de
manding that the IRS be restrained from uncon
stitutional activities.
Learn more about the tactics of the IRS and how
others have successfully resisted it.
Exercise one's rights under the Freedom of In
formation Act to examine incriminating IRS
documents.
Finally start thinking about the supporting al
ternatives to taxes: lotteries, users fees for gov
ernment services, voluntary taxes for new prog
rams paid for by those who support the programs,
options on tax returns which would allow one to
fund programs he likes and ignore those he
doesn't like.
