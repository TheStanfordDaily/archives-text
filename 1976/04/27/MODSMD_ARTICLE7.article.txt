# Turn down ERA

I would like to take this oppor
tunity to air some of my views on
the Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA). I will present them in ful
ler detail at the ERA debate here
tonight.
The proponents of the ERA are
perpetrating a fraud on Ameri
can women. It will takeaway far
more important rights than it
will ever create.
1) The ERA will wipe out the
financial obligation of a husband
and father to support his wife
and children — the most impor
tant of all women's rights.
2) The ERA will make women
subject to the draft and to combat
duty on an equal basis with men.
3) The ERA will wipe out the
right of a mother to keep her
children in case of divorce.

The ERA will do absolutely
nothing for women in terms of
employment. ERA proponents
continue to falsely imply that the
ERA will give women advan
tages in employment that they
do not now have (falsely equat
ing the ERA with "equal pay for
equal work").
These claims are false; it is de
ceitful for ERA proponents to
claim or imply that they are true.
The ERA can do nothing for
women in the field of education.
Passage of the Education
Amendments Act of 1972, which
abolished sex discrimination in
every aspect of education which
received any federal aid (95 per
cent of all schools), took care of
everything for women in this
area.

Similarly, the ERA can do no
more to help women in the credit
area than can the Depository In
stitutions Amendment Act of
1974.
This law takes care of every
thing women have been comp
laining about relative to credit.
The record proves that people
are aware of these facts.
Whenever the ERA has been
taken to the people either in the
form of a vote — as in New York
and New Jersey — or in a public
opinion poll, the American
people overwhelmingly turn
down the ERA. I urge you to do
the same.
