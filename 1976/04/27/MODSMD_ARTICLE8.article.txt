# UFW initiative has serious defects

(First of tivo parts)
Passage of the United Farm Workers' in
itiative would be a disaster â€” for farm
workers, for growers and for the general
public.
The major part of the initiative would
reenact the Agriculture Labor Relations Act
(ARLA). In doing so, it would lock the state
into a law which, while sound in overall
design, has serious defects requiring im
mediate correction. Most importantly, the
act, as administered by the Agricultural
Labor Relations Board (ARLB), has not de
livered on its promise of free, impartially
conducted elections for the workers to de
termine whether or not they want to be rep
resented by a union.
In its 40 years of operation, the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has de
veloped carefully drawn standards regulat
ing the conduct of employers and unions in
representation elections. Basically, they are
designed to insure that the employes in
fact have a free choice by protecting them
from coercion or misrepresentation by
either side.
Although the ARI.A, as it presently reads,
requires the ALRB to follow "applicable"
precedents under the National Labor Rela
tion Act (NRLA).the ALRB has not followed
these precedents in the election area. It has
certified many elections which, under the
NRLB's election rules, would have been
overturned because of United Farm Work
ers miconduct.
Additional polling place
For example, in one election the UFW
asked the ALRB to open an additional pol
ling place and on the morning of the elec
tion, with less than three hours before the
polls opened, the ALRB granted the UFW's
request. Neither the employer nor the
Teamsters Union, which also was on the
ballot, were notified that the election would
be held at this additional polling place, nor
were the employes given any notice.
Thus the only employes aware of this
new polling place and able to vote there

were those informed by the UFW.
The UFW won the election and, despite
the strong objections of the employer and
the Teamsters that the election was not con
ducted fairly, the ALRB certified its results.
In another election, four UFW organizers
came onto the employer's fields a few days
before the election and asked a worker to
sign a UFW authorization card. The man
refused, stating that and his wife did not
support the UFW.
The organizers told him that if he and his
wife didn't sign UFW authorization cards
and the UFW won the election, they would
lose their jobs. The UFW won the election
and again the ALRB certified its results de
spite the UFW's threat.
Certified elections
In these and numerous other election
cases, the ALRB has certified elections
which the National Labor Relations Board
would have set aside. In some of these cases,
the ALRB has acknowledged its failure to
apply federal representation election stan
dards, but has excused its failure by point
ing to the fact that, because of the seasonal
ity of much agricultural empoloyment, a
rerun election could not be held im
mediately.
By the same reasoning, candidates in
Senatorial elections would be free to make
misrepresentations or engage in other un
fair practices not permitted to candidates in
Congressional elections because elections
for the former positions are only held every
six years.
Another problem in the ALRA as it pre
sently reads is the great control it gives to
unions over the employes they represent.
Under the NRLA, an employe may not be
required to become or remain a union
member in order to remain his job, except to
the extent of paying union dues and initia
tion fees.
His union cannot force his employer to
fire him for not obeying union rules or
policies. The same is true under the labor
laws of every other state, both in the public

and private sector.
The ALRA departs from this consensus. It
permits contracts between employers and
unions to require full union membership in
good standing as a condition of employ
ment, so that an employer is obligated to
discharge an employe who violated any
union rules, not just those requiring the
payment of dues and initiation fees. For
example, if a union required its members to
participate in a demonstration or to support
a particular political candidate, members
could lose their jobs by failing to comply.
Nothing special
There is nothing about agriculture which
requires unions representing agricultural
employees to have a kind and degree of
power over their members unlike that per
mitted to unions in any other sector of the
economy.
Nor is the IJFW so virtuous that concern
about its repression potential is unneces
sary. I.abor history is full of examples of
unions which have passed quickly from the
initial idealism of their founders to venal
suppression.
John L. Lewis, for example, the builder of
the United Mine Workers and a man no less
charismatic than Cesar Chavez, was suc
ceeded as union president by Tony Boyle,
who recently was convicted of murdering
an opponent for the union presidency and
misappropriating union funds.
Moreover. theUFW has shown an intense
intolerance toward those who disagree in
any way with its programs. As California
Assembly Speaker Leo McCarthy, certainly
no enemy of the UFW. recently noted, the
UFW's attitude is that "anv difference of
. ipinion by those of us responsible for enact
ing the new law constitutes a betrayal of
farm workers."
The UFW's rigidity and narrowness make
it all the more urgent that the repressive
potential of the law be corrected, not written
into stone by the initiative.
