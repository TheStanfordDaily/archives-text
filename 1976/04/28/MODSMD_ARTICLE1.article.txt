# University files charge vs. USE
## 
### Bill Sing Jacob Young 
The University has filed an unfair
labor practice charge with the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB) against
the United Stanford Employees (USE),
alleging that a USE court suit is de
signed to unlawfully force three Uni
versity employes to become union
members.
The workers are Charles Hall, a
physical sciences and engineering
technician at Hansen Labs; Lupe Del-
Real, a maintenance coordinator for
married student housing; and Edward
Hartal. a shop supervisor in chemistry.
All three currently pay sums equiva
lent to regular union dues.
The dispute stems from the refusal
of the three to become signatory mem
bers of USE, and pay initiation fees of
$50 each.
USE suit
The USE suit in Santa Clara County
Superior Court is asking the court to
force the employes to sign union arti
cles of membership, which USE claims
is required in its current contract with
the University.
According to Douglas Barton,"Uni
versity staff counsel for employe rela
tions, "As a matter of federal labor
law,the maximum requirement is that
an employe only have to satisfy fun
damental (financial) obligatons. It
does not requ ire an employe to become
a member of any union.
"It is clear that USE has exceeded
legal limitations to get the employes to
join the union."
Barton said. "The union has every
right to talk with employes about join
ing, anil it is not our business to inter
fere in such cases. But we do think it is
our business when USE goes to court
suing the employes . . . obliging them
to join. Such an obligation does not
exist, and would be unlawful if it did."
The current University-union con
tract requires all employes to maintain
"membership in good standing."
Disagreement
Barton claims that "in good stand
ing" means "only the obligation to pay
amounts equal to union dues." USE
President Jim Berk, on the other hand,
insists that the contract calls specifi
cally for membership in the union.
Berk said that he had "no idea (that
the University charge) was con
templated or possible."
According to Berk. USE is "suing for
completion of the contract" which re
quires "signing of union membership
papers and paying union dues."
Saying that Barton's claims that
payment of union dues "equivalents"
is all that the contract requires are
"nonsense." Berk insisted that in
fanuary 1975. a panel of grievance ar
bitrators determined that all employes
covered in the contract are required to
lign.
Berk said that the charges appeared
to be an attempt to "weaken the union
shop" that USE currently has. He also
said that he felt the union was, "fairly
secure as to being impervious to legal
action" on these grounds.
Barton said that the University is
asking the NLRB "to explore the pos
sibility of an injunction against the
suit." He explained that because the
prospect of retaining counsel while
tin; suit is pending would be a burden
upon the employes, hp has asked the
NLRB "to expedite action" on this
case.
