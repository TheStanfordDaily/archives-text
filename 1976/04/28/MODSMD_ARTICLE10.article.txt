# Israel's future appears bleak
## 
### 
The recent demonstrations in Israeli oc
cupied Arab territories and the overwhelm
ing victory of Arab nationalist parties in the
recent West-Bank elections point up a di
lemma for the Jewish state. Israel feels com
pelled by security reasons to keep occupied
Arab lands, yet for it to do so would be to
commit suicide as a Jewish nation.
Presently, Israel is trying to have its cake
and eat it too. Though Israel is committed to
democratic ideals and is giving Arabs a
measure of participation in government,
Arabs within the state itself, and within oc
cupied territories, are second class citizens.
What makes the problem especially appa
rent and causes the most outrageous abuses
against the Arabs is the siege state of mind
gripping the nation. With enemies on all
sides, an inflation rate of 25 percent, a
bloated defense budget which cannot be
cut, high taxes and a falling standard of
living, Israel cannot afford the existence of
an Arab fifth column within the nation.
Consequently, half the Israeli police force
is engaged in internal security. For "sec
urity reasons," Israeli Arabs can be de
tained, barred from holding jobs and re
fused entrance to some educational de
partments.
'Security precaution'
In addition, as a part of Jewish efforts to
settle occupied Arab lands, the government
can confiscate Arab land. Though Arabs can
appeal through the nation's courts, they are
often removed from lands as a "security

precaution."
Finally, many Israeli Jews feel an open
contempt for the Arabs. Thus, many Arabs,
particularly in occupied lands, feel ex
tremely resentful toward the Israeli gov
ernment.

Though most of these problems are a re
sult of the state of war in the Middle East,
the problem runs much deeper than that, to
the issue of whether Israel can continue to
survive as a Jewish state.
In addition,,to the Arabs living in oc
cupied lands, approximately 500,000 Israeli
citizens are Arabs. If, as resettlement efforts
on the part of the government indicate, Is
rael holds on to the occupied lands, and if
the present disparity in Jewish and Arab
birth rates continues, Arabs will outnumber
Jews within presently held Israeli territory
by the end of the century.
Thus, the foundation of the Israeli state,
the numerical superiority of the Jewish
people,is eroding away. At the same time
Israel is a theocracy which, by definition,

cannot hand political control over to an
Arab majority.
If Israel wants to maintain its identity as a
Jewish nation, it appears to have two alter
natives. It may either withdraw from Arab
lands, or it may use increasingly repressive
measures to keep an angry and growing
Arab minority in a state of second class citi
zenship.
At present, it appears that Israel has cho
sen the latter course. There are 62 settle
ments on occupied territory in the Golan
Heights and the West Bank, and plans exist
for the construction of 100 more.
Resort to apartheid
If these policies are carried out in the face
of present demographic trends, Israel may
have to resort to a form of apartheid to main
tain a Jewish identity. It is questionable
w'hether Israel has the resources it will need
to hold off the Arabs outside the nation and
repress them within.
The second alternative would be for Israel
to withdraw from occupied Arab lands. Yet
it would be costly and difficult to move Is
raelis settled there, as well as dangerous to
Israel from a military point of view.
Whichever course Israel chooses, its
long-term future does not look bright. A
Jewish Israel cannot continue to occupy
Arab lands and still maintain its democratic
institutions.

zenship.
At present, it appears that Israel has cho
sen the latter course. There are 62 settle

Resort to apartheid
If these policies are carried out in the face
of present demographic trends, Israel may
have to resort to a form of apartheid to main
tain a Jewish identity. It is questionable
w'hether Israel has the resources it will need
to hold off the Arabs outside the nation and
repress them within.
The second alternative would be for Israel
to withdraw from occupied Arab lands. Yet
it would be costly and difficult to move Is
raelis settled there, as well as dangerous to
Israel from a military point of view.
Whichever course Israel chooses, its
long-term future does not look bright. A
Jewish Israel cannot continue to occupy
Arab lands and still maintain its democratic
institutions.

The recent demonstrations in Israeli oc
cupied Arab territories and the overwhelm
ing victory of Arab nationalist parties in the
recent West-Bank elections point up a di
lemma for the Jewish state. Israel feels com
pelled by security reasons to keep occupied
Arab lands, yet for it to do so would be to
commit suicide as a Jewish nation.
Presently, Israel is trying to have its cake
and eat it too. Though Israel is committed to
democratic ideals and is giving Arabs a
measure of participation in government,
Arabs within the state itself, and within oc
cupied territories, are second class citizens.
What makes the problem especially appa
rent and causes the most outrageous abuses
against the Arabs is the siege state of mind
gripping the nation. With enemies on all
sides, an inflation rate of 25 percent, a
bloated defense budget which cannot be
cut, high taxes and a falling standard of
living, Israel cannot afford the existence of
an Arab fifth column within the nation.
Consequently, half the Israeli police force
is engaged in internal security. For "sec
urity reasons," Israeli Arabs can be de
tained, barred from holding jobs and re
fused entrance to some educational de
partments.
'Security precaution'
In addition, as a part of Jewish efforts to
settle occupied Arab lands, the government
can confiscate Arab land. Though Arabs can
appeal through the nation's courts, they are
often removed from lands as a "security

precaution."
Finally, many Israeli Jews feel an open
contempt for the Arabs. Thus, many Arabs,
particularly in occupied lands, feel ex
tremely resentful toward the Israeli gov
ernment.

Though most of these problems are a re
sult of the state of war in the Middle East,
the problem runs much deeper than that, to
the issue of whether Israel can continue to
survive as a Jewish state.
In addition,,to the Arabs living in oc
cupied lands, approximately 500,000 Israeli
citizens are Arabs. If, as resettlement efforts
on the part of the government indicate, Is
rael holds on to the occupied lands, and if
the present disparity in Jewish and Arab
birth rates continues, Arabs will outnumber
Jews within presently held Israeli territory
by the end of the century.
Thus, the foundation of the Israeli state,
the numerical superiority of the Jewish
people,is eroding away. At the same time
Israel is a theocracy which, by definition,

cannot hand political control over to an
Arab majority.
If Israel wants to maintain its identity as a
Jewish nation, it appears to have two alter
natives. It may either withdraw from Arab
lands, or it may use increasingly repressive
measures to keep an angry and growing
Arab minority in a state of second class citi
zenship.

sen the latter course. There are 62 settle
