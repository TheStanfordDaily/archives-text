Laetrile ban
We are appal led at the April 19
raid of Doug Hoiles' home and
bookstore in Mountain View by
agents of the County Department
of Consumer Affairs, State De
partment of Health, and the
Franchise Tax Board. (The
Franchise Tax Board?)
Hoiles and Stewart jones, a
physician, were arrested for
supplying Laetrile, a substance
which some claim arrests cancer
but which is prohibited from
being sold as a cancer cure.
This inexpensive dietary sup
plement has been employed in
other parts of the world for the
prevention and control of many
types of cancer. The Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) and
the American Medical Associa
tion (AMA) claim, however, that
there exist insufficient data to
permit the use of Laetrile in this
country. But the FDA has mys
teriously refused to grant an ex
perimental license for the testing
of Laetrile.
What kind of circular reason
ing is this? Just who is the FDA
trying to protect? Certainly not
the 350,000 who will die of
cancer this year in the U.S.
alone.
It is imperative that every av
enue of possible relief be freely
and openly pursued.
At stake is the doctor-patient
relationship, which many feel
should not be subject to political
interference. On a broader scale,
we feel that each individual
should have the ultimate say on
what he takes into his own body.
Doug Hoiles has been serving
members of the Stanford com
munity for many years, provid
ing literature not commonly av
ailable in other area bookstores.
We, in turn, wish to help him
now by organizing support in
the Stanford community
through our Libertarian Defense
League.
If you are interested in expres
sing your opposition to viola
tions of our individual rights,
contact us.
Remember, if the state is to be
restrained from imposing "emi
nent domain" over our bodies,
we must take a stand.
