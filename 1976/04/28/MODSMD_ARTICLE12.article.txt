# UFW initiative needs modifications

(Second of two ports)
To correct problems with the
United Farm Workers' (UFW) in
itiative, a group of legislators has
proposed changes in the present
law. All of these changes are di
rected toward bringing the Ag
riculture Labor Relations Act
(ARLA) into close conformity
with the National Labor Rela
tions Act (NLRA). They would in
no way emasculate the ARLA or
infringe upon the rights of farm
workers.
To the contrary, the amend
ments would strengthen the law

by insuring its even-handed ad
ministration and compliance
with the accepted solutions to
labor relations problems de
veloped over forty years under
federal law.
In addition to re-enacting the
ARLA. the UFW's initiative
would add several provisions to
the existing law. Most notably, it
would add to the statute the
highly controversial "access
regulation." This regulation re
quires all agricultural employers
in the state to allow nonemploye
union organizers to come onto
their property during certain
periods of the working day.
The National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) does not as a gen
eral rule require employers to
admit nonemploye union or
ganizers to their property, and
the access regulation has been
attacked in the courts as an un
constitutional infringement of

private property rights
Another addition to the exist
ing law proposed in the initia
tive is treble damages in unfair
labor practice cases. This change
would aggravate what already
has been a serious problem in the
way the ALRB has handled un
fair labor practice cases under
the existing law.
For example, the board's gen
eral counsel has demanded that
the employer make a public
apology to his employes for al
leged unfair labor practices.
While there have been a few iso
lated cases under the NLRA
where an employer has been re
quired to read a formal notice to
the employes, these cases have
involved employers who have
been found repeatedly guilty of
the most serious unfair Labor
practices.
In other cases the remedies
sought by the general counsel

have been even more extreme.
For example, in at least one case,
the general counsel has de
manded that in addition to giv
ing a public apology speech to
employees, posting notices and
mailing to the employes' homes
written statements containing
the same message, the employer
place newspaper advertisements
containing the apology.
In that and other cases, the
ALRB also has demanded that
the employer compensate the
employes for the "emotional dis
tress" resulting from his claimed
unfair labor practices.
In all, the ALRB is seeking 27
different items of relief in that
case and many of them, such as
the damages for emotional dis
tress, go way beyond NLRA pre
cedent. One inevitable effect of
this punitive approach is that it
is impossible to settle many
cases, with substantial resulting
costs to all parties and to the
ALRB.
Voluntary compliance
No labor relations law can be
effective if it does not secure
voluntary compliance by all of
the groups it directly regulates.
The ALRB's partiality and puni
tive approach to employers are
largely responsible for the sus
picion and hostility toward the
ALRB which undoubtedly now
exist on the part of some agricul
tural employers.
Finally, whatever merits the
initiative process may have for
some kinds of legislation, it is a
poor vehicle for regulating labor
relations. Once enacted, an in
itiative statute can be amended
or repealed only by another in
itiative.
Such inflexibility is a fatal de
fect for any labor relations legis
lation, regardless of its content.
Relationships between
employers, unions, and
employes change constantly
and, to be fair and effective,
legislation regulating these rela
tionships must be responsive to
the changes.

The NLRA has been amended
several times since originally
enacted, as have comparable
state labor relations laws. Flexi
bility is particularly important
for labor relations legislation
covering agriculture since it is,
experimental and since the un
derlying relationships between
the parties are stil! unsettled.
Even the ALRA's most ardent de
fenders admit that changes in
the law wi 11 be necessary at some
point.
Misrepresentation
In promoting what would be
repressive legislation for both
agricultural employers and
employes, the UFW repeatedly
misrepresents the economic
situation of the farm worker in
California. Its picture of ruthless
exploitation simply is not accu
rate. Wages of farm workers in
California have risen by more
than 120 percent in the last de
cade, more than twice as fast as
â€¢ he rise in pay for urban indust
rial workers.
California farm workers now
receive on the average $3.20 per
hour in wages. Fringe benefits
and working conditions have
improved even more dramati
cally. While field labor still is
difficult work, it is no different
in this respect than many other
jobs and is paid at a level that is
better than that received for
comparable work in many other
sectors of the economy.
In the past, residents of urban
areas have proven to be receptive
targets for the UFW's misrep
resentations. Their good will
and sense of injustice have been
engaged at no immediate cost
since the problems arise in re
mote rural settings. This is a
luxury that none of us can afford
anymore. At stake are the fun
damental rights of farm workers
and growers to fairly conducted
elections and an impartially ad
ministered law.
