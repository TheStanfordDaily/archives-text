call it the Nuclear Shutdown
If even t he scientific commun
itv is split on tht: issue, how can
t lit; average voter decide? Field's
kitest California Poll on Prop. 15
found a slight 5-to-4 anti
initiative sentiment among the
05 percent of the public aware of
it. That's not enough, he said, to
predict an outcome.
Emotional pitches have al
ready been made by both sides
on tht; only one of the 15 ballot
propositions that reached the
ballot by petitions, so much so
that Assemblyman Charles War
ren (D-Los Angeles), com
mented:
"Both ot them are overstating
their respective cases."
Warren, whose assembly
committee held vast hearings on
4he subject late last year, says."It
is the most important issue fac
ing California in at least 50

years.
And voters in Colorado and
Oregon, where similar initia
tives have qualified for
November ballots, are watching
the California vote. So is the nuc
lear industry, which is trying to
halt the anti-nuclear movement
in California.
Here's what Prop. 15 would
do:
—In itself, it would not shut
down or ban nuclear power
plants. It would leave it in the
hands of the California Legisla
ture, requiring two-thirds votes
in both houses to go ahead with
new atomic plants.
—If the legislature did not
judge by 1979 that plants could
operate safely and nuclear waste
could be stored or disposed of
without risk, existing plants
would have to reduce output to
60 percent of licensed capacity
in 1981 and shut down by 1987
unless the safety verdict
changed.
—The companies operating
atomic power plants would have
to drop the shield of federal
Price-Anderson Act liability
limits. They limit a utility's lia
bility to $560 million in the
event of a disaster, although
Congress could raise the limit on
the merits of a case.
—Unless there is unlimited
liability within one year, from
either a change in federal law or
a waiver by power companies,
existing plants would have to

reduce output to 60 percent of
licensed capacity in 1981 and
shut down by 1987 unless the
situation changed.
A 15-member commission
wi tli a budget of $800,000 a year
v\ul.Ic! advise the legislature on
plant safety.
Opponents say that under the
two-thirds vote requirement,
only 14 state senators could de
cide California's nuclear future.
Opponents also claim the fed
eral law on liability and the act
that created the Nuclear Reg
ulatory Commission supersede
the states, so Prop. 15 would
wind up in the courts.
Proponents say they are ready
to argue their case all the way to
the U.S. Supreme Court.
Both sides have geared up to
accelerate campaigns in the final
weeks, and the courts have made
it a no-holds-barred contest by
throwing out state laws limiting
campaign spending.
David Pesonen, a San Fran
cisco attorney who drafted Prop.
15, said the "Yes on 15 Commit
tee" would spend about
$800,000 in its campaign. He
said court decisions throwing
out campaign spending limits
hurt the initiative's chances
against such powerful foes as
General Electric and Westing
house.

"It's the people against the
money," said Pesonen, repre
senting such environmental
groups as Project Survival and
the Sierra Club.
Basically, he said, all the in
itiative asks is that utilities "put
their money where there mouth
is" by guaranteeing their pro
duct against failure. He said that
by calling it the "shutdown" in
itiative, the opponents were ad
mitting that nuclear power
could not be proven safe.
Opponents, such as former
Cov. Edmund G. "Pat" Brown,
point to what they call an "un
paralleled" safety record in the
history of nuclear power. More
than 50 nuclear reactors, includ
ing three operating in California,
have never had an injurious ac
cident, they say.
Brown's son, California Gov.
Edmund Brown Jr.. has not taken
a stand, saying he wants to study
pending legislation that would
accomplish many Prop. 15 goals
without affecting existing
plants.
Passage of Prop. 15. say oppo
nents, would send electricity
rates soaring and cause shor
tages. The economy would suf
fer. they say. because industry
would not locate where it could
not be sure of enough electricity
to operate.
Proponents, citing a state

Energy Commission report, say
utilities in California have suffi
cient energy reserves.
Pesonen, at a recent court
hearing, failed to have ballot
pamphlet language changed to
use "nuclear safeguards" title.
An attorney for the "No on 15"
committee commented to Peso
nen within hearing of a reporter
that the initiative's effect on
existing plants, and those under
construction, was Prop. 15's
"Achilles heel."
Legislative Analyst A. Alan
Post says utilities' investments
of up to $2.3 billion could be lost
if they had to close the three
plants now operating and could
not put four under construction
into use.
