Is it possible to damage the enamel on one's teeth by chewing on ice
cubes ?-A.S.
Dr. Borer, a dentist at the University of the Pacific School of
Dentistry, says no.
I lowever, our staff does recal I an article somewhere which main
tained that icecube chewing indicates sexual problems. It's some*
thing to think about.
I commute from Berkeley and hove noticed that oil the toll bridges
lime neon lights above each booth which flush a number as each
car pusses. The most frequent number is four. What does it
meun?â€”\V.W.
The overhead light indicates the "type of transaction." according
to a Bay Bridge official. Cars, and trucks with four wheels (which
pay 50 cents), are classified as (Mass I vehicles, and consequently
represented by the numeral "4." ((let it?) A flashing "5" indicates
that the vehicle is toll-free, including police cars and bridge
maintenance vehicles. Larger multi-wheeled trucks have different
numbers and pay different prices.

If you practice tennis at Stanford, you may have noticed the re
markable difference in the cleaning of the varsity courts and the
Hncina courts. The former are clean-brushed; the loiter, a mess,
with bolls, cons, paper hags, leaves, etc. Are the lousy players
supposed to clean the area themselves? If so, tell me.-H.V.
Tennis Coach Dick Could admitted that during the tournament
season the varsity courts are washed more often, since they must be
cleaned before each event. And they do get preference for new
equipment.
However, Could said that neither set of courts is washed fre
quently. Consequently, players are responsible for depositing their
own trash in the provided receptacles.
