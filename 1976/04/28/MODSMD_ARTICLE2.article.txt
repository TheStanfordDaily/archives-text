"The political mood of the country
is one of very deep disillusionment."
Political Science Prof. John Manley
said yesterday at a noon forum entitled
"Perspectives on the Presidential
Candidates."
Manley. Political Science Prof. Ale
xander George and Adjunct Political
Science Prof. Lawrence Weiler spoke
with .1 group of 30 persons on major
candidates and issues in the upcoming
presidential election.
"People are discouraged with edu
cation and business organizations."
Manley said. "The only thing there's
confidence in is the medical profes
sion and trash collection."
George cited the importance of dis
tinguishing between "... what it
takes to get elected, and what it takes to
perform well in office."
He commented. "We are at a turning
point as to what to do with the presi
dency; the President used to be the ful
crum of the system."
George said that the current trend is

to put more emphasis on the "personal
characteristics" of the candidates.
"The person elected should have
major executive experience." he said.
All three professors stressed the sig
nificance of sound foreign policy plat
forms in the election.
"Under Carter." said Weiler. "who
knows what foreign policy would be?
It's not been demonstrated that he has
any great knowledge in this area."
Weiler said Humphrey "is the most
liberal in foreign policy" and"the best
informed. He's a man who's finally at
peace with himself."
If President Gerald Ford is elected.
Weiler said, "there will be a change in
foreign policy. But which way? Kis
singer will go. and he's the remaining
dove of the Ford Administration."
Foreign policy is "in a state of disre
pair," according to George. "I think
Kissinger has to go." said George.
"And someone will have to pick up the
pieces; the person elected must bring
with him managing experience and
sound advisinu systems."
