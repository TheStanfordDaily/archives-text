## Card nine tops Davis 
### George Anders 
Rescued by three innings of
hitless relief from freshman
Mark Abbondola, the Stanford
baseball team edged UC-Davis
yesterday, 9-8, in an afternoon
game at Davis.
Abbondola, called up from the
JV baseball team, came on in the
bottom of the seventh after star
ter Rob Irwin had yielded an
inning-opening home run.
Evaluating his performance
after the game, Abbondola said,
"I got most of my fastballs where
1 wanted, but was surprised a
couple sliders" weren't ripped
for hits by Davis.
The Cards broke out with five
runs in the first on four singles, a
hit batsman, three walks and a
sacrifice fly. Davis starter Roger
McKay was yanked after pitch
ing only one-third of an inning.
Stanford shortstop Steve
Davis got his 10th home run in
the third inning, a shot near the
left field foul line, to tie him for
the club lead with Tom Guar
dino.
Card outfielder Larry
Reynolds added two more stolen
bases, giving him 30 on the sea
son. Fast weekend, Reynolds
broke the Stanford season stolen
base record of 25, set by Warren
Goodrich in 1953.
Abbondola picked up his sec
ond save for the varsity, striking
out two and walking two. It was
his first appearance since March
22 when he faced Delaware.
Irwin picked up the win, run
ning his record to 5-3.
The Cards return to California
Intercollegiate Baseball Associa
tion (CIBA) play this weekend
when USC's baseball team
comes to Sunken Diamond for a
three game series Friday at 3
p.m., Saturday at 1 p.m. and
Sunday at 1 p.m.
