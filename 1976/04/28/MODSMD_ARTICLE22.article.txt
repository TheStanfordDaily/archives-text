# But stresses team success
## Guardino hits homers 
### David Georgette 
The pitcher peers in tor the
sign. He sets himself and checks
the runner. His fastball smokes
to the plate like the 5:05 express,
but the batter sends it upward
and outward even more quickly.
The thud of the ball on the in
cline beyond the left fence sig
nifies anotherhome run for Sta
nford first basemen Tom Guar
dino.
Home runs represent the pin
nacle of baseball hitting. They
make men into legends. But
when Guardino talks about the
three homers he hit last
the sophomore from San lose
analyzes them quite differently.
"Frankly, 1 might have been
hitting home runs, but 1 wasn't
swinging the bat as well as I
would like to." he remarks. "The
thing with homeruns is some
times you start looking at the left
field fence too much."
Reviewing the way he's
played so far. Guardino says "In
league, I haven't yet put it to
gether. I'm striking out way too
much. I've improved defen

sively, but I'm still not making
all the plays I should make."
'Line drive hitter'
However, Stanford baseball
coach Ray Young said "he's a
very fine defensive ballplayer."
Young added Guardino is "a line
drive hitter, a power hitter but
not a home run hitter."
Furthermore, Young said, "he
runs well for a big man. (Guar
dino is 6-feet-2 1 /2 and weighs 196
lbs.) I have no hesitation to give
Tommy the steal sign at any
time."
Guard i no's own definition of a
successful season leaves little
room for error. "For me to cal 1 it a
good season." he says, "I'd have
to hit .300." After facing Davis
yesterday, he was hitting .273.
When asked what he takes
most pride in, Guardino replies,
"It's got to be a game-winning
hit."
Solid first year
After a solid first year, for
which he was named the most
valuable freshman, Guardino
played baseball last summer in
Pueblo, Golo. This year, fans
must have envisioned many
more homers from the big guy.
"It's unreasonable for people to
assume that a guy will keep im
proving on his statistics each
year," Guardino says.
Earlier this year, Guardino
was struggling at the plate. Then
over spring break, he made the
all-tournament team at the
Riverside tourney on the
strength of efforts like a 3 for 4
day against eventual champion
Arizona State.
"That, so far. is the personal
highlight of the season," says
Guardino. "It helped me get the
confidence back. If it hadn't been
for Riverside, it could have been
a long season for me."
Since the tournament, Guar
dino has been batting clean-up.
"I feel better in the fourth slot.
It's kind of a challenge."
But when one bats clean-up, a
hitless day can bring plenty of

frustration, Cuardino knows.
"The bad days pop up here and
there and usually they're at the
worst time."
Often, when he speaks of his
own achievements, he prefaces
them by stating. "Team success
is more important to me."
Though Guardino will not
readily label his performances as
outstanding, he says he am feel
the benefit of a year's experi
ence. "I definitely think I've im
proved and I'm hitting better for
average. I'm enjoying it more
this season."
Guardino says he is thinking
about playing professional
baseball. "Right now, I'm hop
ing I have more untapped abil
ity." he says. "If I have plans at
all of playing pro, l have to im
prove each year as I did between
this year and my freshman year."
He's not staking everything on
baseball, however. "I don't value
academics over athletics or the
athletics over academics,"
Guardino says. "They're sort of
mutual. If one goes sour, I can
look to the other for a sense of
accomplishment."
Perhaps Guardino can find a
sense of accomplishment this
weekend against USC. "We
need a sweep to get back in the
thick of it,"he says,"and at least
two out of three to stay alive."
