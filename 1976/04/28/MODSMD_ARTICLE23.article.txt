# Stanford sports flashback
## 
### Jeff Parietti 
The scores 27-17 and 13-12
probably won't mean much to
one at first look. But to die-hard
Stanford football fans these
numbers almost immediately
bring to mind the Cards' Rose
Bowl victories over Ohio State
and Michigan in 1971 and 1972.
Quarterbacks Jim Plunkett and
Don Bunce led Stanford to back
to-back wins in what sportscas
ter Curt Gowdy terms as "the
Cranddaddy of all bowls."
But the two Bowl teams we
ren't just Plunkett and Bunce.
There were numerous other
stars, some of whom are still ac
tive in the professional ranks.
'Thunderchickens'
The most widely known front
four in the country (besides the
Minnesota Vikings' Purple
People Eaters) during these two
seasons were Stanford's "Thun
derchickens."
The colorful, cocky "Thun
derchickens" drove opposing
quarterbacks batty.
The mainstays of the in

timidating group were Pete
Lazetich, Greg Sampson, Larry
Butler and Dave Tipton. Tipton
graduated in 1971 and was re
placed by Roger "Hollywood"
Cowan.
Lazetich and Butler were
selected to the 1971 Pacific-8
All-Conference squad.
Sampson, a first round draft
pick of the HoustonOilers, is still
with the Oilers and starts at of
fensive tackle.
The "Thunderchickens" were
aided by an excellent trio of
linebackers in Jeff Siemon, Ron
Kadziel and Mike Simone.
Siemon was a consensus Ail-
American his senior campaign
and has spent four years with the
Minnesota Vikings. Besides
playing in two Rose Bowls, he
has been in two Su per Bowls and
is one of the top middle linebac
kers in the NFL.
The other two caught on with
pro teams for a short time, Kad
ziel with New England and
Simone with Denver.
Defensive back Benny Barnes

was another outstanding player.
Barnes was an All Pacific-H pick
in 1971 and is a four year veteran
of the Dallas Cowboys.
'The Rabbit'
The offensive squad wasn't
bad either. Plunkett had two ex
cellent receivers to throw to in
tight end Bob Moore and flanker
Randy "the Rabbit" Vataha.
Moore played five seasons
with the Oakland Raiders before
being taken in this year's expan
sion draft by Tampa Bay. Vataha
has been a member of the New
England Patriots for five years.

Running back Reggie Sander
son, a two time Rose Bowl vete
ran. made a goat the pros, play
ing in the now defunct World
Football League (WFL).
Kicker Rod Garcia, whose
clutch 31-yard field goal with 12
seconds to play beat Michigan,
also was in the WFL for a year
with the Southern California
Sun.
And finally, former head
coach John Ralston moved on to
the pro coaching ranks with the
Denver Broncos after his two
Bowl gems.
