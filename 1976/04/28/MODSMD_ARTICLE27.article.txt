Jury acquits Soliah
SACRAMENTO — A federal court jury found
Patricia Hearst's confessed lover, Steven Soliah,
innocent of bank robbery charges yesterday mo
ments after officials revealed evidence contradict
ing his alibi witnesss.
The jury of eight women and four men deliber
ated only six-and-a-half hours before acquitting the
blond, 27-year-old house painter of helping in the
$15,000 robbery of a suburban bank in which a
woman customer was killed.
But Asst. U.S. Attorney David Bancroft said in
San Francisco after the verdict that federal officials
had not ruled out the possibility of charging Soliah
with other crimes.
"There .ire a number of possibilities," said Ban
croft. "We are evaluating all opt inns and reviewing
all evidence which has come to light since Sept.
18."
In <i press conference after the vedict, Soliah said
the jury's decision was the "right thing. I didn't
know what to expect but I'm glad it (the verdict)
happened."
Only minutes before the verdict, officials re
vealed tli,it Emily Zoback, a San Francisco mas
seuse who was Soliah's alibi witness, may have
been visiting Folsom Prison only 10 miles from
Carmichael on the day of the robbery — April 21,
1975.
The jury, which started deliberations Monday
evening, was of course unaware of the revelations
about Toback.
Toback, who was present at the verdict, sitting in
the front row of spectators, said, "That's errone
ous," when asked about the prison report.
Kissinger speaks against Rhodesia
LUSAKA, Zambia — Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger vowed yesterday "unrelenting opposi
tion" by the United States to Prime Minister lan
Smith's white minority government in Rhodesia.
Meanwhile, in Ghana, student demonstrators
have forced Kissinger to cancel his planned visit to
that African country. American officials said.
Smith reacted sharply to Kissinger's statement,
saying the secretary judged Rhodesia "from a pre
conceived stance," and a Khodesian black leader
said Kissinger offered "nothing that is new."
In a major policy speech during his visit to Zam
bia, the third stop on a seven-nation African tour,
Kissinger called for a negotiated agreement to give
Rhodesia black majority rule within two years.
To help secure a "just and durable" solution in
Rhodesia, Kissinger said the Ford administration
will ask Congress to repeal its authorization for the
import of Khodesian chrome in defiance of United
Nations sanctions.
I le said the United States will also ask South
Africa and France for full compliance with the Un
ited Nations sanctions.
The cancellation of Kissinger's visit to Ghana

was attributed to an illness of the head ot state. Col.
Ignatius Acheampong. according to the cable from
the U.S. Ambassador in Ghana, Shirley Temple
Black.
But U.S. officials traveling with Kissinger
charged that Soviet diplomats in Accra, Ghana,
provoked the student protests.
"We know for a fact that the Soviets have been
agitating with the Ghanaian goverment and with
Ghanaian students over the visit," one otf icial said.
Jetliner crashes; 52 survive
CHARLOTTE AMALIE, Virgin Islands — An
American Airlines jet with H8 persons aboard
crashed into an embankment at the end of the air
port runway yesterday, ripped across a busy high
way and exploded in flames.
Hospital authorities said 52 passengers and crew
members were treated lor injuries, leaving 36 per
sons killed or unaccounted for.
Civil Defense officials reported earlier that 47
bodies were removed from the wreckage, but it was
determined later that some of the body bags used at
the site contained only portions of badly charred
victims.
The plane struck at least seven automobiles and
smashed into a service station and a tavern, a fire
official said. Two cars were crushed under the
smouldering fuselage.
American Airlines in San Juan, Puerto Rico, an
nounced that the jetliner was Flight 625 from Pro
vidence, R. 1., with a stop at New York's Kennedy
Airport. They said the craft carried HI passengers
and a crew of seven.
Federal Aviation Administration officials in At
lanta, Ga., said the plane apparently touched down
too late on the runway at Harry S. Truman Airport
and then applied power but was unable to become
airborne.
Brown heads for Maryland primary
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. takes
his presidential campaign to Maryland today, and
California gets its first black acting governor as Lt.
Gov. Mervyn Dymally takes over for two days.
Brown, who is on the Democratic presidential
primary ballots in only California, Nevada and
Maryland, will be testing his unorthodox style of
anti-politics in the suburbs of the nation's capital.
But he is competing only for the image of being a
serious national candidate — not for delegates —
because he did not enter a slate in the separate
Maryland elections for convention delegates.
The Maryland trip marks the first time the 38-
year-old bachelor has left California since his elec
tion as governor 16 months ago. And that means
today will be Dymally's first chance to serve as
acting governor.
But Dymally has travel plans, too. He plans to
attend the National Black Caucus in North Carolina

Saturday, which will make Senate President pro
tem James Mills (D-Sun Diego), acting governor
over the weekend.
Brown may also visit the North Carolina meeting,
but his schedule was still uncertain a few hours
before his departure today.
l or a politician who has emphasized — even
boasted — of an unorthodox style. Brown is plan
ning a conspicuously orthodox Maryland tour.
In a 54-hour period beginning tonight in Balti
more, Brow nis slated to attend 21 events touching
on all of the traditional bases that Democratic can
didates for office usually cover.
The 2V2-day round of dinners, receptions, news
conferences and plant tours includes separate
meetings with labor leaders, locally elected offi
cials, ministers, blacks, students and party leaders.
Add in the tours of two industrial plants, two
television shows, a radio show, meetings with
editors of the state's two biggest newspapers and
editors of a black newspaper, and you have the
typical candidate's blitz oi a state.
There is even a tour of a federally funded,
minority-run health clinic.
That schedule — balanced and precise in timing
— is quite unlike the style Brown has set as gover
nor.
U.S. bishop appointed cardinal
VATICAN CITY — Pope Paul VI reached out to
six continents yesterday arid named 1 ( J new cardi
nals, including Archbishop William Baum of
Washington, D.C.. a fighter against racism.
The pontiff's action made the body that elects
popes younger and more representative of the
Roman Catholic Church in the Third World.
The selection of Archibishop Baum, a 49-year
old Texan, gives the United States, a country of
more than 48 million Roman Catholics, 12 mem
bers in the Sacred College of Cardinals.
This is the biggest U.S. representation ever, al
though three of the cardinals are retired and one is
over 80 and ineligible to vote in a conclave for a
new pope.
In his selection the 78-year-old pontiff took
another step toward rejuvenating and inter
nationalizing the Sacred College of Cardinals, once
dominated by Italians.
The Pope, who has been stressing the Church's
missionary role, named cardinals from six conti
nents — four from Africa, five from North and
South America, two from Asia, seven from Europe
and one from New Zealand.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow but patchy low clouds
tomorrow morning. Little temperature change.
Lows tonight in the 40s. 1 lighs today and tomorrow
in the 60s to low 70s. Light winds becoming north
west winds 10 to 20 mph afternoons and evenings.

Kissinger speaks against Rhodesia
LUSAKA, Zambia — Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger vowed yesterday "unrelenting opposi
tion" by the United States to Prime Minister lan
Smith's white minority government in Rhodesia.
Meanwhile, in Ghana, student demonstrators
have forced Kissinger to cancel his planned visit to
that African country. American officials said.
Smith reacted sharply to Kissinger's statement,
saying the secretary judged Rhodesia "from a pre
conceived stance," and a Khodesian black leader
said Kissinger offered "nothing that is new."
In a major policy speech during his visit to Zam
bia, the third stop on a seven-nation African tour,
Kissinger called for a negotiated agreement to give
Rhodesia black majority rule within two years.
To help secure a "just and durable" solution in
Rhodesia, Kissinger said the Ford administration
will ask Congress to repeal its authorization for the
import of Khodesian chrome in defiance of United
Nations sanctions.
I le said the United States will also ask South
Africa and France for full compliance with the Un
ited Nations sanctions.
The cancellation of Kissinger's visit to Ghana

was attributed to an illness of the head ot state. Col.
Ignatius Acheampong. according to the cable from
the U.S. Ambassador in Ghana, Shirley Temple
Black.
But U.S. officials traveling with Kissinger
charged that Soviet diplomats in Accra, Ghana,
provoked the student protests.
"We know for a fact that the Soviets have been
agitating with the Ghanaian goverment and with
Ghanaian students over the visit," one otf icial said.
Jetliner crashes; 52 survive
CHARLOTTE AMALIE, Virgin Islands — An
American Airlines jet with H8 persons aboard
crashed into an embankment at the end of the air
port runway yesterday, ripped across a busy high
way and exploded in flames.
Hospital authorities said 52 passengers and crew
members were treated lor injuries, leaving 36 per
sons killed or unaccounted for.
Civil Defense officials reported earlier that 47
bodies were removed from the wreckage, but it was
determined later that some of the body bags used at
the site contained only portions of badly charred
victims.
The plane struck at least seven automobiles and
smashed into a service station and a tavern, a fire
official said. Two cars were crushed under the
smouldering fuselage.
American Airlines in San Juan, Puerto Rico, an
nounced that the jetliner was Flight 625 from Pro
vidence, R. 1., with a stop at New York's Kennedy
Airport. They said the craft carried HI passengers
and a crew of seven.
Federal Aviation Administration officials in At
lanta, Ga., said the plane apparently touched down
too late on the runway at Harry S. Truman Airport
and then applied power but was unable to become
airborne.
Brown heads for Maryland primary
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. takes
his presidential campaign to Maryland today, and
California gets its first black acting governor as Lt.
Gov. Mervyn Dymally takes over for two days.
Brown, who is on the Democratic presidential
primary ballots in only California, Nevada and
Maryland, will be testing his unorthodox style of
anti-politics in the suburbs of the nation's capital.
But he is competing only for the image of being a
serious national candidate — not for delegates —
because he did not enter a slate in the separate
Maryland elections for convention delegates.
The Maryland trip marks the first time the 38-
year-old bachelor has left California since his elec
tion as governor 16 months ago. And that means
today will be Dymally's first chance to serve as
acting governor.
But Dymally has travel plans, too. He plans to
attend the National Black Caucus in North Carolina

Saturday, which will make Senate President pro
tem James Mills (D-Sun Diego), acting governor
over the weekend.
Brown may also visit the North Carolina meeting,
but his schedule was still uncertain a few hours
before his departure today.
l or a politician who has emphasized — even
boasted — of an unorthodox style. Brown is plan
ning a conspicuously orthodox Maryland tour.
In a 54-hour period beginning tonight in Balti
more, Brow nis slated to attend 21 events touching
on all of the traditional bases that Democratic can
didates for office usually cover.
The 2V2-day round of dinners, receptions, news
conferences and plant tours includes separate
meetings with labor leaders, locally elected offi
cials, ministers, blacks, students and party leaders.
Add in the tours of two industrial plants, two
television shows, a radio show, meetings with
editors of the state's two biggest newspapers and
editors of a black newspaper, and you have the
typical candidate's blitz oi a state.
There is even a tour of a federally funded,
minority-run health clinic.
That schedule — balanced and precise in timing
— is quite unlike the style Brown has set as gover
nor.
U.S. bishop appointed cardinal
VATICAN CITY — Pope Paul VI reached out to
six continents yesterday arid named 1 ( J new cardi
nals, including Archbishop William Baum of
Washington, D.C.. a fighter against racism.
The pontiff's action made the body that elects
popes younger and more representative of the
Roman Catholic Church in the Third World.
The selection of Archibishop Baum, a 49-year
old Texan, gives the United States, a country of
more than 48 million Roman Catholics, 12 mem
bers in the Sacred College of Cardinals.
This is the biggest U.S. representation ever, al
though three of the cardinals are retired and one is
over 80 and ineligible to vote in a conclave for a
new pope.
In his selection the 78-year-old pontiff took
another step toward rejuvenating and inter
nationalizing the Sacred College of Cardinals, once
dominated by Italians.
The Pope, who has been stressing the Church's
missionary role, named cardinals from six conti
nents — four from Africa, five from North and
South America, two from Asia, seven from Europe
and one from New Zealand.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow but patchy low clouds
tomorrow morning. Little temperature change.
Lows tonight in the 40s. 1 lighs today and tomorrow
in the 60s to low 70s. Light winds becoming north
west winds 10 to 20 mph afternoons and evenings.
Jury acquits Soliah
SACRAMENTO — A federal court jury found
Patricia Hearst's confessed lover, Steven Soliah,
innocent of bank robbery charges yesterday mo

The jury of eight women and four men deliber
ated only six-and-a-half hours before acquitting the
blond, 27-year-old house painter of helping in the
$15,000 robbery of a suburban bank in which a
woman customer was killed.
But Asst. U.S. Attorney David Bancroft said in
San Francisco after the verdict that federal officials
had not ruled out the possibility of charging Soliah
with other crimes.
"There .ire a number of possibilities," said Ban
croft. "We are evaluating all opt inns and reviewing
all evidence which has come to light since Sept.
18."

saying the secretary judged Rhodesia "from a pre
conceived stance," and a Khodesian black leader
said Kissinger offered "nothing that is new."
In a major policy speech during his visit to Zam
bia, the third stop on a seven-nation African tour,
Kissinger called for a negotiated agreement to give
Rhodesia black majority rule within two years.
To help secure a "just and durable" solution in
Rhodesia, Kissinger said the Ford administration
will ask Congress to repeal its authorization for the
import of Khodesian chrome in defiance of United
Nations sanctions.
I le said the United States will also ask South
Africa and France for full compliance with the Un

The cancellation of Kissinger's visit to Ghana

was attributed to an illness of the head ot state. Col.
Ignatius Acheampong. according to the cable from
the U.S. Ambassador in Ghana, Shirley Temple
Black.
But U.S. officials traveling with Kissinger
charged that Soviet diplomats in Accra, Ghana,
provoked the student protests.
"We know for a fact that the Soviets have been
agitating with the Ghanaian goverment and with
Ghanaian students over the visit," one otf icial said.
Jetliner crashes; 52 survive
CHARLOTTE AMALIE, Virgin Islands — An
American Airlines jet with H8 persons aboard
crashed into an embankment at the end of the air
port runway yesterday, ripped across a busy high
way and exploded in flames.
Hospital authorities said 52 passengers and crew
members were treated lor injuries, leaving 36 per
sons killed or unaccounted for.
Civil Defense officials reported earlier that 47
bodies were removed from the wreckage, but it was
determined later that some of the body bags used at
the site contained only portions of badly charred
victims.
The plane struck at least seven automobiles and
smashed into a service station and a tavern, a fire
official said. Two cars were crushed under the
smouldering fuselage.
American Airlines in San Juan, Puerto Rico, an
nounced that the jetliner was Flight 625 from Pro
vidence, R. 1., with a stop at New York's Kennedy
Airport. They said the craft carried HI passengers
and a crew of seven.
Federal Aviation Administration officials in At
lanta, Ga., said the plane apparently touched down
too late on the runway at Harry S. Truman Airport
and then applied power but was unable to become
airborne.
Brown heads for Maryland primary
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. takes
his presidential campaign to Maryland today, and
California gets its first black acting governor as Lt.
Gov. Mervyn Dymally takes over for two days.
Brown, who is on the Democratic presidential
primary ballots in only California, Nevada and
Maryland, will be testing his unorthodox style of
anti-politics in the suburbs of the nation's capital.
But he is competing only for the image of being a
serious national candidate — not for delegates —
because he did not enter a slate in the separate
Maryland elections for convention delegates.
The Maryland trip marks the first time the 38-
year-old bachelor has left California since his elec
tion as governor 16 months ago. And that means
today will be Dymally's first chance to serve as
acting governor.
But Dymally has travel plans, too. He plans to
attend the National Black Caucus in North Carolina

Saturday, which will make Senate President pro
tem James Mills (D-Sun Diego), acting governor
over the weekend.
Brown may also visit the North Carolina meeting,
but his schedule was still uncertain a few hours
before his departure today.
l or a politician who has emphasized — even
boasted — of an unorthodox style. Brown is plan
ning a conspicuously orthodox Maryland tour.
In a 54-hour period beginning tonight in Balti
more, Brow nis slated to attend 21 events touching
on all of the traditional bases that Democratic can
didates for office usually cover.
The 2V2-day round of dinners, receptions, news
conferences and plant tours includes separate
meetings with labor leaders, locally elected offi
cials, ministers, blacks, students and party leaders.
Add in the tours of two industrial plants, two
television shows, a radio show, meetings with
editors of the state's two biggest newspapers and
editors of a black newspaper, and you have the
typical candidate's blitz oi a state.
There is even a tour of a federally funded,
minority-run health clinic.
That schedule — balanced and precise in timing
— is quite unlike the style Brown has set as gover
nor.
U.S. bishop appointed cardinal
VATICAN CITY — Pope Paul VI reached out to
six continents yesterday arid named 1 ( J new cardi
nals, including Archbishop William Baum of
Washington, D.C.. a fighter against racism.
The pontiff's action made the body that elects
popes younger and more representative of the
Roman Catholic Church in the Third World.
The selection of Archibishop Baum, a 49-year
old Texan, gives the United States, a country of
more than 48 million Roman Catholics, 12 mem
bers in the Sacred College of Cardinals.
This is the biggest U.S. representation ever, al
though three of the cardinals are retired and one is
over 80 and ineligible to vote in a conclave for a
new pope.
In his selection the 78-year-old pontiff took
another step toward rejuvenating and inter
nationalizing the Sacred College of Cardinals, once
dominated by Italians.
The Pope, who has been stressing the Church's
missionary role, named cardinals from six conti
nents — four from Africa, five from North and
South America, two from Asia, seven from Europe
and one from New Zealand.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow but patchy low clouds
tomorrow morning. Little temperature change.
Lows tonight in the 40s. 1 lighs today and tomorrow
in the 60s to low 70s. Light winds becoming north
west winds 10 to 20 mph afternoons and evenings.
Jury acquits Soliah
SACRAMENTO — A federal court jury found
Patricia Hearst's confessed lover, Steven Soliah,
innocent of bank robbery charges yesterday mo
ments after officials revealed evidence contradict
ing his alibi witnesss.
The jury of eight women and four men deliber
ated only six-and-a-half hours before acquitting the
blond, 27-year-old house painter of helping in the
$15,000 robbery of a suburban bank in which a
woman customer was killed.
But Asst. U.S. Attorney David Bancroft said in
San Francisco after the verdict that federal officials
had not ruled out the possibility of charging Soliah
with other crimes.
"There .ire a number of possibilities," said Ban
croft. "We are evaluating all opt inns and reviewing
all evidence which has come to light since Sept.
18."
In <i press conference after the vedict, Soliah said
the jury's decision was the "right thing. I didn't
know what to expect but I'm glad it (the verdict)
happened."
Only minutes before the verdict, officials re
vealed tli,it Emily Zoback, a San Francisco mas
seuse who was Soliah's alibi witness, may have
been visiting Folsom Prison only 10 miles from
Carmichael on the day of the robbery — April 21,
1975.
The jury, which started deliberations Monday
evening, was of course unaware of the revelations
about Toback.
Toback, who was present at the verdict, sitting in
the front row of spectators, said, "That's errone
ous," when asked about the prison report.

Jetliner crashes; 52 survive
CHARLOTTE AMALIE, Virgin Islands — An
American Airlines jet with H8 persons aboard
crashed into an embankment at the end of the air
port runway yesterday, ripped across a busy high
way and exploded in flames.
Hospital authorities said 52 passengers and crew
members were treated lor injuries, leaving 36 per
sons killed or unaccounted for.
Civil Defense officials reported earlier that 47
bodies were removed from the wreckage, but it was
determined later that some of the body bags used at
the site contained only portions of badly charred
victims.
The plane struck at least seven automobiles and
smashed into a service station and a tavern, a fire
official said. Two cars were crushed under the
smouldering fuselage.
American Airlines in San Juan, Puerto Rico, an
nounced that the jetliner was Flight 625 from Pro
vidence, R. 1., with a stop at New York's Kennedy
Airport. They said the craft carried HI passengers
and a crew of seven.
Federal Aviation Administration officials in At
lanta, Ga., said the plane apparently touched down
too late on the runway at Harry S. Truman Airport
and then applied power but was unable to become
airborne.
Brown heads for Maryland primary
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. takes
his presidential campaign to Maryland today, and
California gets its first black acting governor as Lt.
Gov. Mervyn Dymally takes over for two days.
Brown, who is on the Democratic presidential
primary ballots in only California, Nevada and
Maryland, will be testing his unorthodox style of
anti-politics in the suburbs of the nation's capital.
But he is competing only for the image of being a
serious national candidate — not for delegates —
because he did not enter a slate in the separate
Maryland elections for convention delegates.
The Maryland trip marks the first time the 38-
year-old bachelor has left California since his elec
tion as governor 16 months ago. And that means
today will be Dymally's first chance to serve as
acting governor.
But Dymally has travel plans, too. He plans to
attend the National Black Caucus in North Carolina

Saturday, which will make Senate President pro
tem James Mills (D-Sun Diego), acting governor
over the weekend.
Brown may also visit the North Carolina meeting,
but his schedule was still uncertain a few hours
before his departure today.
l or a politician who has emphasized — even
boasted — of an unorthodox style. Brown is plan
ning a conspicuously orthodox Maryland tour.
In a 54-hour period beginning tonight in Balti
more, Brow nis slated to attend 21 events touching
on all of the traditional bases that Democratic can
didates for office usually cover.
The 2V2-day round of dinners, receptions, news
conferences and plant tours includes separate
meetings with labor leaders, locally elected offi
cials, ministers, blacks, students and party leaders.
Add in the tours of two industrial plants, two
television shows, a radio show, meetings with
editors of the state's two biggest newspapers and
editors of a black newspaper, and you have the
typical candidate's blitz oi a state.
There is even a tour of a federally funded,
minority-run health clinic.
That schedule — balanced and precise in timing
— is quite unlike the style Brown has set as gover
nor.
U.S. bishop appointed cardinal
VATICAN CITY — Pope Paul VI reached out to
six continents yesterday arid named 1 ( J new cardi
nals, including Archbishop William Baum of
Washington, D.C.. a fighter against racism.
The pontiff's action made the body that elects
popes younger and more representative of the
Roman Catholic Church in the Third World.
The selection of Archibishop Baum, a 49-year
old Texan, gives the United States, a country of
more than 48 million Roman Catholics, 12 mem
bers in the Sacred College of Cardinals.
This is the biggest U.S. representation ever, al
though three of the cardinals are retired and one is
over 80 and ineligible to vote in a conclave for a
new pope.
In his selection the 78-year-old pontiff took
another step toward rejuvenating and inter
nationalizing the Sacred College of Cardinals, once
dominated by Italians.
The Pope, who has been stressing the Church's
missionary role, named cardinals from six conti
nents — four from Africa, five from North and
South America, two from Asia, seven from Europe
and one from New Zealand.
Today's weather

Lows tonight in the 40s. 1 lighs today and tomorrow

Jury acquits Soliah
SACRAMENTO — A federal court jury found
Patricia Hearst's confessed lover, Steven Soliah,
innocent of bank robbery charges yesterday mo
ments after officials revealed evidence contradict
ing his alibi witnesss.
The jury of eight women and four men deliber
ated only six-and-a-half hours before acquitting the
blond, 27-year-old house painter of helping in the
$15,000 robbery of a suburban bank in which a
woman customer was killed.
But Asst. U.S. Attorney David Bancroft said in
San Francisco after the verdict that federal officials
had not ruled out the possibility of charging Soliah
with other crimes.
"There .ire a number of possibilities," said Ban
croft. "We are evaluating all opt inns and reviewing
all evidence which has come to light since Sept.
18."
In <i press conference after the vedict, Soliah said
the jury's decision was the "right thing. I didn't
know what to expect but I'm glad it (the verdict)
happened."
Only minutes before the verdict, officials re
vealed tli,it Emily Zoback, a San Francisco mas
seuse who was Soliah's alibi witness, may have
been visiting Folsom Prison only 10 miles from
Carmichael on the day of the robbery — April 21,
1975.
The jury, which started deliberations Monday
evening, was of course unaware of the revelations
about Toback.
Toback, who was present at the verdict, sitting in
the front row of spectators, said, "That's errone
ous," when asked about the prison report.
Kissinger speaks against Rhodesia
LUSAKA, Zambia — Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger vowed yesterday "unrelenting opposi
tion" by the United States to Prime Minister lan
Smith's white minority government in Rhodesia.
Meanwhile, in Ghana, student demonstrators
have forced Kissinger to cancel his planned visit to
that African country. American officials said.
Smith reacted sharply to Kissinger's statement,
saying the secretary judged Rhodesia "from a pre
conceived stance," and a Khodesian black leader
said Kissinger offered "nothing that is new."
In a major policy speech during his visit to Zam
bia, the third stop on a seven-nation African tour,
Kissinger called for a negotiated agreement to give
Rhodesia black majority rule within two years.
To help secure a "just and durable" solution in
Rhodesia, Kissinger said the Ford administration
will ask Congress to repeal its authorization for the
import of Khodesian chrome in defiance of United
Nations sanctions.
I le said the United States will also ask South
Africa and France for full compliance with the Un
ited Nations sanctions.
The cancellation of Kissinger's visit to Ghana

was attributed to an illness of the head ot state. Col.
Ignatius Acheampong. according to the cable from
the U.S. Ambassador in Ghana, Shirley Temple
Black.
But U.S. officials traveling with Kissinger
charged that Soviet diplomats in Accra, Ghana,
provoked the student protests.
"We know for a fact that the Soviets have been
agitating with the Ghanaian goverment and with
Ghanaian students over the visit," one otf icial said.
