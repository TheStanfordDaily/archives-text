# More prevalent in Jews
## Tay-Sachs test today 
### Bruce Kadden 
A screening to determineTay-Sachs
disease gene carriers will be held on
campus today and tomorrow. The
blood test will be available from 11
a.m.-l p.m. and at Tresidder from 2-4
p.m.
Tay-Sachs disease is an incurable,
recessive genetic disorder that attacks
the nervous system in infants. It is al
ways fatal by the time the child is :i-5
years old.
Recent scientific breakthroughs
make it possible to prevent Tay-Sachs
disease by testing parents and poten
tial parents to identify Tay-Sachs gene
carriers.

Through genetic counseling,
couples in which both members are
carriers, and who are thus "at risk" for
having Tay-Sachs children, can ho of
fered several options, one of which is
prenatal diagnosis.
The Tay-Sachs gene is 101 i mes more'
common among individuals of Jewish
ancestry than in the general popula
tion. according to Assoc. Pediatrics
Prof. I loward Cann, who has been pre
senting a slide presentation to various
groups during the past few weeks .is
part of the educational campaign pre
ceding the testing.
Cann said that about one in 3()
American Jews carries the Tay-Sachs
gene. He noted that there are presently
only unproven theories which attempt
to explain why the gene occurs more
often in persons of Jewish ancestry.
The Tay-Sachs screening program is
a prototype for the control of other
genetic disorders, once carrier testing
lor these other disorders becomes av
ailable.
According to Joan Wranoff. coor
dinator of the Northern California
Tay-Sachs Disease Prevention Prog
ram. general awareness of the Tav-
Sachs program will promote a better
understanding of the basic principles
of genetics and how they can affect
family planning decisions.
Over 5000 persons have been tested
at Tay-Sachs screenings in the Hay
Area since the testing program started
more than 15 months ago. More than
175 carries have been identified.
The campus screenings are spon
sored by Hillel, with the cooperation of
Cowell Health Center, the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Office and the Department
of Pediatrics.
