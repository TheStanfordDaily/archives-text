# Lyman doubts that Trustees will accept student member
## 
### Geoff Samuels 
President Richard Lyman said last
night he did not consider it likely that
the Board of Trustees would accept
student membership.
Interviewed on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Lyman said, "It is not very
likely that there will be a dramatic re
versal (of the board's position) next
month, but it's very much to be ex
pected that there will be a fairly
thoroughly thought-out statement on
the subject."
The traditional purpose of a "lay
board" in higher education, be said,
has been to be a "link and a buffer"
between the university community
and the outside community.
Student, faculty or staff presence on
the board Would tend to draw the
board into a more active role in the
conduct of University operations.
'More activist role'
"When boards begin to become rep
resentative of campus constituencies,"
Lyman explaned, "then there is a
much greater likelihood of the board
playing a much more activist role in
the running of the place, or trying to."
The ultimate fiduciary respon
sibilities for the University rests with
the board, Lyman said. He commented

that this purpose is likely to be "vit
iated" if the immediate pressure of
campus concerns became prominent.
Lyman emphasized that if students
were allowed to be board members
"All constitutencies would have to be
represented — and the matter of
achieving the right representation is
extremely difficult."
Questioned on the accessibility of
the board to student opinions, Lyman
replied that there are students on every
board committee except the nomina
tions committee.
Students on committees
The committees on academic affairs,
land and buildings and finance and
development each have two student
members, while the committee on in
vestments has one student, Lyman
said.
"Most of the real discussion and de
bate goes on in the committees," he
said.
Although students do not attend
board meetings where the final deci
sions are made. Lyman said he "didn't
think that anybody can remember
when committee judgments have been
significantly altered by the board as a
whole subsequently."
He further noted that when the

board met as a whole in the academics
committee the two student members
are able to present their views to the
complete board, witout being board
members.
"I think that it is crucially important
for the board to be open to student
views,to have opportunities to find out
what students think," Lyman said, "I
think that can be done without student
membership."

President Richard Lyman said last
night he did not consider it likely that
the Board of Trustees would accept
student membership.
Interviewed on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Lyman said, "It is not very
likely that there will be a dramatic re
versal (of the board's position) next
month, but it's very much to be ex
pected that there will be a fairly
thoroughly thought-out statement on
the subject."
The traditional purpose of a "lay
board" in higher education, be said,
has been to be a "link and a buffer"
between the university community
and the outside community.
Student, faculty or staff presence on
the board Would tend to draw the
board into a more active role in the
conduct of University operations.
'More activist role'
"When boards begin to become rep
resentative of campus constituencies,"
Lyman explaned, "then there is a
much greater likelihood of the board
playing a much more activist role in
the running of the place, or trying to."
The ultimate fiduciary respon
sibilities for the University rests with
the board, Lyman said. He commented

that this purpose is likely to be "vit
iated" if the immediate pressure of
campus concerns became prominent.
Lyman emphasized that if students
were allowed to be board members
"All constitutencies would have to be
represented — and the matter of
achieving the right representation is
extremely difficult."
Questioned on the accessibility of
the board to student opinions, Lyman
replied that there are students on every
board committee except the nomina
tions committee.
Students on committees
The committees on academic affairs,
land and buildings and finance and
development each have two student
members, while the committee on in
vestments has one student, Lyman
said.
"Most of the real discussion and de
bate goes on in the committees," he
said.
Although students do not attend
board meetings where the final deci
sions are made. Lyman said he "didn't
think that anybody can remember
when committee judgments have been
significantly altered by the board as a
