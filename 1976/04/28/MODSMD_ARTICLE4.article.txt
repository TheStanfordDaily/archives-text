# Woman: 'Moonies' wouldn't let her leave
## 
### Dave Treinis 
A Midpeninsula man claimed yes
terday that his 23-year-old sister in
voluntrily spent last week at the indoc
trination center for Unification Church
recruits in Booneville.
However, a representative of the Un
ification Church in San Francisco,
who identified herself only as
"Donna," said, 'I wouldn't know any
thing about it. Things like that never
occur" and refused further comment.
Referring to his sister's experiences
at the "New Ideal City Ranch," the in
formant said that, "She had been try
ing to get out for days and was virtu
ally in hysterics" before he was able to

locate her.
The Unification Church, led by Rev.
Sun Myung Moon, teaches a mixture
of Christianity, Korean faiths and
anti-Communism.
In the past, the group, nicknamed
"Moonies," has come under fire from
relatives of young converts who have
alleged the group captures potential
converts and wins them to their faith
through coercion and brainwashng.
Fear of reprisal
Both the informant and his sister re
quested that their names not be
printed, explaining that they feared
possible reprisal from Moon's follow
ers.
According to the informant, his sis
ter said that she had planned to "go
camping in Mendocino with two or
three 'very friendly girls' " that she
had met in thevicinity of thebookstore
here.
"Although she said that they briefly
mentioned religious backgrounds,
they did not once mention their affilia
tion with any religious group." he
explained.
"When she arrived at the ranch on
the evening of April 15. she finally be
came suspicious when the 'Moonies'
appeared very solicitious of her," he
added, noting that, "she then de
manded to know where she was and
received virtually no answer."
The informant said that his sister
was "forced to attend religious
indoctrination seminars on 'basic be
liefs' for that entire week" and com
mented that "they kept hammering
away at her and denying her sleep
until she was physically and emotion
ally exhausted."
The informants' sister confirmed the
details of her stay at the ranch.
Questioning
He mentioned that he was able to
deduce his sister's whereabouts by
questioning the Mendocino county
sheriff about the existence of religious
communes in that area.
He further commented that persons
<it tin ranch "would aUvays give e\-
cuses explaining why they couldin
locate her" whenever he tried to phone
his sister, and that he received one
"disjointed, peculiar letter that (his
sister) had written on Monday but that
was postmarked Thursday."
"Finally, I decided to go up north to
get her," he said. "When I drove to the
ranch, she came hounding up to the car
with her suitcase in hartd."
The informant summarized his fam
ily's experiences by observing th«>t, "If
you're way out there in the sticks and
under all his psychological coercion, it
makes it hard for you to leave. They
just wait for people to crack."
