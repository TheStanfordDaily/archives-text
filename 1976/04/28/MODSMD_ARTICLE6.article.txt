# Research conducted here on child neglect problems
## 
### Rachel Moran 
A baby is born prematurely. As the
doctor, how do you decide whether
waterbed flotation should be used?
As an administrator in the public
school system, how do you deal with
the special problems of minority chil
dren in predominantly white schools?
You are a judge faced with a case of
child neglect. How do you decide what
effects separation from the pa rents will
have on a child?
Research being done at the Boys'
Town Center for the Study of Youth
Development at Stanford could aid in
answering all of these questions.
Waterbed babies
For example. Dr. Anneliese Korner
and her associates studied the effects
of keeping premature infants on a
waterbed that oscillated in a gentle,
irregular rhythm similar to that of mat
ernal respiration.
They found that apnea (cessation of
respiration) occurred less frequently
among "waterbed babies" than among
babies cared for in the customary in
cubator.
In a study of San Francisco schools.
Sociology Prof. Sanford Dornhusc h
found that black and Chicano students
held unrealistic views of their own
level of effort and skill in academic
work.
According to the center's second
annual report, "This appears to result

from the school's failure to set chal
lenging standards for academic per
formance.
"Stanford investigators are now
working with the San Francisco
School District to develop methods of
teaching which will increase student's
perceptions of the close relationship
between school work and future occu
pational aspiration."
The center is also supporting an on
going project to investigate the effects
of parent-child separation legally
necessary because of parental neglect
or abuse. However, findings are not yet
available.
Problems of neglect
All of these seemingly diverse inves
tigations have one thing in common:
according to the center, they all deal
with problems of neglect.
As the center's 1973-74 annual re
port states, neglect has been inter
preted in its broadest sense to include
"any knowledge that can be used ulti
mately for the benefit of youth to in
sure that they may have healthy,
happy, and productive lives."
Founded in 1974. the center here
will receive $450,000 per annum for 25
years from Boys' Town, Nebraska to
support research by University faculty
and graduate students.
Moreover. $1.5 million has been
committed for the construction of ,i
permanent research facility in build

ing 460 on th' 1 outer Quad.
Originally. Boys' Town was simply
an institution th.it housed about 550
troubled youths.
However, as its fame spread, it re
ceived numerous endowments. These
excess funds were used to create three
research centers: one at Boys' Town,
one at Catholic University in
Washington, D.C., and one here.
Although the center here receives
funds from Boys' Town, policy-wise
"it is largely autonomous." says Lin
nea Marenco, administrative assistant
for the center.
She adds that there are two primary
advatanges to the Center's approach:
"The center is interdisciplinary. We
have gotten together top researchers
who share from their disciplines."
Otherwise, professors may tend to
"use the vocabulary and history ot
knowledge" of their own fields and
remain unaware of similar work in
other fields.
For example, she describes one case
in which "people in anthropology and
pediatrics were doing the same type of
research and didn't even know it."
Guaranteed tunding
Marenco also indicates that because
the center has a guaranteed source of
funding for 25 years, it provides an
"excellent opportunity" for long term
research projects.

used at the center. The center studies such problems as

whether or not prematurely horn infants should be
placed on flotation waterheds.
According to Marenco, the Univer
sity was selected because it "submit
ted the best proposal and because of its
reputation for dealing with problems
of youth development."
Psychology Prof. Albert Uastorf di
rects the program; he makes decisions
concerning budgeting and allocation
of resources and appointments and
reappointments to membership in the
center.
Policy decisions are made by the di
rector and members, who are chosen
from Stanford faculty with an interest
in youth development.
Presently, the center is not con
cerned with disseminating informa
tion. although there are extensive
plans for a distributional center in
Boys' Town. I lowever. the center's an
nual report is distributed throughout
the country.
Makes contacts
Although the center is primarily
oriented towards faculty and graduate
students, if an undergraduate is in
terested in an area of neglect, the
center will try to help him contact an
appropriate professor. For further ex
change of information, open seminars
are held every other week.
While all of these means of dispers
ing information are valuable, effective
avenues of communication with the
general public remain a dream for the
future.
The center says it has succeeded in
stimulating basic research on the prob
lems of neglect; however, the problem
of making its findings available
through Boys' Town to doctors,
judges, school administrators and
others remains largely unresolved.
