## Election chaos 
### 
The end of April sees yet another ASSU election pass
into history.Though the past election was probably the
best run in years, perfection is still a long way off.
First, confusion arose in March and continued
through Registration Week as to when fee assessment
petitions had to be completed — and who was empo
wered by the ASSU Constitution to make that decision.
This caused constant arguing by ASSLJ Elections
Commissioner Mike Murray and then-ASSU President
Lee Rosenbaum, making it necessary for the ASSU to
intervene.
The senate had to place some fee assessments on the
ballot at its March 30 meeting, and then had to deliber
ately override its constitution to place the Speakers
Bureau fee assessment on the ballot at its April 13
meeting.
However, one of the most incredible acts of any
recent election occurred the night the primary results
were tabulated. Murray was able only to read off the
vote totals in the order by which they were placed on
the ballot without giving the slate or organization's
name, since he did not have a copy of the ballot with
him.
Thus, for a few hours it was unknown which fee
assessment had received which vote total. This caused
KZSU, which was broadcasting live at the time the vote
was announced, no end of consternation.
Murray, however, is to be commended for tabulating
the results of the primary and the runoff within two
hours each time, a record.
It would be unfair to blame all of the last few weeks'
mistakes on Murray, since he is charged with adminis
tering a set of rules which are open to anyone's in
terpretation.
As Murray has pointed out, confusion and error in
ASSU elections exist because of the inconsistency and
vagueness of the ASSU's election laws. These laws
have been frequently rewritten to the point where they
only create chaos.
Therefore, the ASSU Senate should immediately
create an ad hoc committee to totally revise all election
laws. The duties and powers of the Election Commis
sioner should be clearly delineated. Also, just who can
overrule the commissioner — and in which areas —
should also be decided.
Furthermore, this committee should define just
what the phrase "public notice" in the constitution
means. If this phrase would be specified as meaning
that the times and places of the voting, along with the
full text of the ballot, be printed not less than four days
before an election, most of the controversy surround
ing the last two elections could have been obviated.
