# Root of SF strike

The city workers' strike in San
Francisco is rooted in a bitter
irony.
The striking "craft workers"
are fighting back after having
been punished at the polls for
something of which they aren't
guilty. Their salaries — admit
tedly well above the average in
other cities — were blamed for
high property tax bills in 1975.
It isn't true. But the leaders of
these unions can't go to the
people and explain the error.
They can't do it because those
same union leaders were a
knowing and willing part of
what did cause the tax jump.
San Francisco's tax bills are
outrageous because thecity's top
businessmen, with building
trades union leaders as eager col
laborators, decided years ago to
turn San Francisco into a west
ern New York City — in a sense
only dimly related to New York's
current fiscal problems. Out here
we call it "Manhattanization."
Corporate activity
San Francisco is to become the
headquarters for corporate activ
ity in Asia. Australia and the
Pacific coast of Latin America. A
1957 Stanford Research Institute

study referred to this as the
"Pacific Rim strategy." Its advo
cates are not small-timers: the
Bank of America, Bechtel Corp.,
Standard Oil of California, Wells
Fargo and lesser lights in ship
ping, construction and espe
cially finance.
Locally, this meant a
Stonehenge of disproportionate
highrise office buildings and a
rapid transit system designed to
bring white workers from com
fortable suburbs and to get them
home again. This meant
building-trades jobs, and the
elite leaders of those elite unions
jumped onto the Pacific Rim
strategy early. At the taxpayers'
expense.
Highrises meant new water
and sewage facilities. The
strategy demanded an expanded
airport. Inexpensive downtown
pensioners' housing was "rede
veloped" for a new convention
center. Stephen Bechtel, who
was as responsible as any one
man for thinking up Bay Area
Rapid Transit (BART), got the
people to pay him to build it.
Labor involvement
And while it was all happen
ing. John Crowley, who heads
the San Francisco Labor Coun

cil, was on Mayor Joe Alioto's
bond screening committee. The
Plumbers' Joe Mazzola was on
the Airport Commission. The
Laborers' George Evankovich
was on the Housing Authority.
The Machinists' Stan Jensen was
on the Redevelopment Agency.
Bill Chester of the Longshore
men — a union that since the
early 1960s has gone along with
Pacific Rim and the building
trades despite its integrated
membership and radical history
— is chairman of the board of
BART.
Today this "labor town" is
struggling through the least
popular strike in its history be
cause its voters believe that
Crowley and Mazzola and the
others are not "labor" any more
— but powerful men who drew
their power from an alliance
with businessmen and who are
now desperate because the
businessmen don't need them
any more.
San Franciso's longtime ro
mance with its labor leaders was
undaunted by all of this
downtown collaboration until
the 19705.
