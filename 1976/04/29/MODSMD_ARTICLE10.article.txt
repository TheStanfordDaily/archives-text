# Carter clears vital hurdle
## 
### Bruce Kadden News Analysis 
Jimmy Carter cleared another
important hurdle on the way to a
first-ballot victory at this summer's
Democratic national convention in
New York by winning Tuesday's
Pennsylvania primary with an im
pressive 36 percent of the popular
vote.
The former Georgia governor's
surprisingly easy victory over
labor's favorite candidate Henry
Jackson, who received 26 percent
of the vote, indicated that the only
person with any chance to keep
Carter from the top spot on the
ticket is Minnesota Sen. Hubert
Humphrey, who has so far skip

ped the primaries.
Humphrey's hopes have rested
all along on the theory that the
democratic contenders would de
feat each other during the tiring
primary campaign, leading to a
wide open convention where an
"old reliable'' would have the best
chance to win.
Correct decision?
For a while it looked as if Hum
phrey had made the correct deci
sion, but Carter's recent momen
tum indicates that he is far ahead
of the rest of the field.
With 3008 delegates voting at
the convention, Carter is shooting
for two "magic'' numbers. If he re
ceives 1505 votes on a ballot, he

will win the nomination. But with
the large number of candidates in
the race, he may not be able to
reach that figure on the first ballot.
The other magic number is con
sidered to be 1000, or about one
third of the delegates. Anyone
able to capture that many first
ballot votes (unless he has the
views of a George Wallace) would
be virtually assured of an eventual
victory.
Stop-Carter campaign
While Carter is well on his way
to this total, the large number of
uncommitted delegates could be
his greatest stumbling block By
the time the convention rolls
around, a monumental stop-
Carter campaign could be in full
swing, probably aiming at divert
ing these uncommitted votes from
the peanut farmer.
Another important roadblock is
the probable victory of favorite son
and Gov. Jerry Brown in Califor
nia. While Brown has been ac
cused of being a Humphrey
stand-in. it is more likely that he
wants a piece of the action him
self.
On the Republican side, the
May 1 Texas primary will indicate
whether former California Gov.
Ronald Reagan has any chance
to beat President Gerald Ford in
Kansas City this summer.
Up for grabs
Ford is currently speaking al
most around the clock in the
southern state where 93 dele
gates are up for grabs.
The Texas and Louisiana
primaries this Saturday mark the
start of the home stretch in which
22 contests dunng the next six
weeks will complete the pre
convention official competition.
Carter intends to enter all of
these contests, sustaining the in
tensity he has shown throughout
the campaign Unless he makes a
slip worse than his "ethnic purity
comment, there may be no stop
ping him.
