# 'Jewish experience atypical'

"The American Jewish experi
ence comes closer to affirming the
American dream than that of any
other group come to these shores,
while at the same time remaining
atypical," Political Science Prof.
Daniel Elazar of Temple Univer
sity said Tuesday night in a lecture
entitled America and Its Jewish
Community: An Atypical Affirma
tion of the American Experience."
Delivering one of the seventh
annual Aaron-Roland lectures in
Jewish Studies to about 70 people
in the Geology Building, Elazar
said, Most of the peoples who
came to America wished to be
come unambivalently American.
This was to some extent true of
the Jews as well, but Jewish am
bivalence was more deep-rooted.
It may be that individual Jews
are able to achieve typicality.
However, Jews as a group remain
atypical."
Prismatic character'
Elazar traced this atypicality to
what he called the "prismatic
character" of the Jewish people
which, he said, involves three
elements: the conception of the
Jewish people as ecclesia (a re
ligious group), ethnos (an ethnic
group) or politea (a political
group).
At least one of these concep
tions served to distinguish Jews
from other immigrant peoples dur
ing the history of the United
States, according to Elazar.
"For the first six generations of
Jewish life in America, the Jewish
corporate identity combined
ecclesia, ethnos and politea,'
Elazar said.
However, in what Elazar called
"the second stage" of American
Jewish history (1840-1880), "the
ethnos was latent and the politea
was denied. The emphasis of
Judaism was primarily religious.
"Even when it came to matters
of Jewish immigrants in America,
the appeal was to treat them as
Germans, not Jews," he said.
Jewery transformed
"But in the third stage of Jewish
development — up to World War 11
— American Jewry was trans
formed by the coming of Jews
from Eastern Europe. For them,
the ethnos was manifest. The
ecclesia continued to be manifest
as well, but the politea was still
latent," he said.
According to Elazar, the con
cept of politea was re-awakened
after World War II by "the Zionist
movement, which made a deep
impression on American Jewry."
The concept of ethnos was also
strengthened by "the rise of ethnic
interest throughout America at the
end of the 1960 s," he said.
"We are now on the threshold of
the 11th Jewish generation in
America,"he said. "The Bible at
taches importance to the passing
of 10 generations, and perhaps
American Jews live according to
this rule. The coming generation
may adjust the relationship bet
ween ecclesia, ethnos and politea
in the American dream."

However, Jews as a group remain
atypical."
Prismatic character'
Elazar traced this atypicality to
what he called the "prismatic
character" of the Jewish people
which, he said, involves three
elements: the conception of the
Jewish people as ecclesia (a re
ligious group), ethnos (an ethnic
group) or politea (a political
group).
At least one of these concep
tions served to distinguish Jews
from other immigrant peoples dur
ing the history of the United
States, according to Elazar.
"For the first six generations of
Jewish life in America, the Jewish
corporate identity combined
ecclesia, ethnos and politea,'
Elazar said.
However, in what Elazar called
"the second stage" of American
Jewish history (1840-1880), "the
ethnos was latent and the politea
was denied. The emphasis of
Judaism was primarily religious.
"Even when it came to matters
of Jewish immigrants in America,
the appeal was to treat them as
Germans, not Jews," he said.
Jewery transformed
"But in the third stage of Jewish
development — up to World War 11
— American Jewry was trans
formed by the coming of Jews
from Eastern Europe. For them,
the ethnos was manifest. The
ecclesia continued to be manifest
as well, but the politea was still
latent," he said.
According to Elazar, the con
cept of politea was re-awakened
after World War II by "the Zionist
movement, which made a deep
impression on American Jewry."
The concept of ethnos was also
strengthened by "the rise of ethnic
interest throughout America at the
end of the 1960 s," he said.
"We are now on the threshold of
the 11th Jewish generation in
America,"he said. "The Bible at
taches importance to the passing
of 10 generations, and perhaps
American Jews live according to
this rule. The coming generation
may adjust the relationship bet
ween ecclesia, ethnos and politea
in the American dream."

AMERICAN DREAM—Temple University Prof. Daniel Elazar said
Tuesday that the experience of American Jews comes close to
"the American dream." Elazar (right) is shown here before his
lecture, talking with Political Science Dept. Chairman Richard
Brody.
"The American Jewish experi
ence comes closer to affirming the
American dream than that of any
other group come to these shores,
while at the same time remaining
atypical," Political Science Prof.
Daniel Elazar of Temple Univer
sity said Tuesday night in a lecture
entitled America and Its Jewish
Community: An Atypical Affirma
tion of the American Experience."
Delivering one of the seventh
annual Aaron-Roland lectures in
Jewish Studies to about 70 people
in the Geology Building, Elazar
said, Most of the peoples who
came to America wished to be
come unambivalently American.
This was to some extent true of
the Jews as well, but Jewish am
bivalence was more deep-rooted.
It may be that individual Jews
are able to achieve typicality.
However, Jews as a group remain
