# Committee staff assistant attacked for report role
## 
### Kim Hatamiya 
"Our role is to stimulate discus
sion on issues within and between
academic committees, the ASSU
Senate, and the Council of Presi
dents (COP)," ASSU Committee
Staff Assistant Mike Kieschnick
says.
But Kieschnick's performance
of this "role" has come under fire
from critics of his work on the so
called "Howard Report" on Uni
versity admissions policies.
ASSU Sen. Bob Ottilie charges
Kieschnick with "politically involv
ing himself on student time and
money."
Ottilie says he feels that "the
Committee Staff Assistant should
take a neutral position politically
on any issue and should not act to
push any issue or ideology.
"I am not against the position,"
he says. "I'm against the fact that
the Committee Staff Assistant
took a position.
"Kieschnick should be helping
students and committee members
to represent student interest and
not to represent student interest
himself," he argues.
Bureaucratic function'
"We have a base bureaucratic
function," Kieschnick says. "We
file reports and committee mi
nutes and answer questions on
applications for committee posi
tions.
"I am very available in terms of
discussing questions on how
committees should work and the
more political and philosophical
issues dealt with in the commit
tees,' he says.
Responding to Ottilie's criticism
of his role in preparing the Howard
Report, Kieschnick says,"the
purpose of the Howard Report
was to focus on an issue, but we
also took a committee itself as the
subject — we were looking into
the dynamics of a committee, in

this case the Committee on Un
dergraduate Admissions and Fi
nancial Aid (C-UAFA), and
checked whether faculty and stu
dents were really effective.
"Personally I see the Howard
Report as something the position
of Committee Staff Assistant
should do a lot more of.' he says.
Ottilie contends that Kieschnick
investigated the C-UAFA under
the pretense that he would inves
tigate all committees as to why
students are not effectively com
municating, which is definitely
misleading."
'No effort'
He further charges that "the
Committee Staff Assistants have
made no effort to perform their re

sponsibilities They never acted
as a liaison or came to the Senate
They never investigated student
input and never came to the Se
nate to suggest any change,'' he
says.
The double position of Commit
tee Staff Assistant, now in its sec
ond year, is filled by Kieschnick. a
senior, and sophomore Barry
Corden.
Selected by a committee of
three senators and one COP
member, the students were ap
pointed because of their experi
ence with University and student
government bureaucracy accord
ing to Corden.
Sounding board'
We are mainly used as a
sounding board. Corden says.

called "Howard Report" on Uni
versity admissions policies.
ASSU Sen. Bob Ottilie charges
Kieschnick with "politically involv
ing himself on student time and
money."
Ottilie says he feels that "the
Committee Staff Assistant should
take a neutral position politically
on any issue and should not act to
push any issue or ideology.
"I am not against the position,"
he says. "I'm against the fact that
the Committee Staff Assistant
took a position.
"Kieschnick should be helping
students and committee members
to represent student interest and
not to represent student interest
himself," he argues.
Bureaucratic function'
"We have a base bureaucratic
function," Kieschnick says. "We
file reports and committee mi
nutes and answer questions on
applications for committee posi
tions.
"I am very available in terms of
discussing questions on how
committees should work and the
more political and philosophical
issues dealt with in the commit
tees,' he says.
Responding to Ottilie's criticism
of his role in preparing the Howard
Report, Kieschnick says,"the
purpose of the Howard Report
was to focus on an issue, but we
also took a committee itself as the
subject — we were looking into
the dynamics of a committee, in

this case the Committee on Un
dergraduate Admissions and Fi
nancial Aid (C-UAFA), and
checked whether faculty and stu
dents were really effective.
"Personally I see the Howard
Report as something the position
of Committee Staff Assistant
should do a lot more of.' he says.
Ottilie contends that Kieschnick
investigated the C-UAFA under
the pretense that he would inves
tigate all committees as to why
students are not effectively com
municating, which is definitely
misleading."
'No effort'
He further charges that "the
Committee Staff Assistants have
made no effort to perform their re

sponsibilities They never acted
as a liaison or came to the Senate
They never investigated student
input and never came to the Se
nate to suggest any change,'' he
says.
The double position of Commit
tee Staff Assistant, now in its sec
ond year, is filled by Kieschnick. a
senior, and sophomore Barry
Corden.
Selected by a committee of
three senators and one COP
member, the students were ap
pointed because of their experi
ence with University and student
government bureaucracy accord
ing to Corden.
Sounding board'
We are mainly used as a
sounding board. Corden says.
"Our role is to stimulate discus
sion on issues within and between
academic committees, the ASSU
Senate, and the Council of Presi
dents (COP)," ASSU Committee
Staff Assistant Mike Kieschnick
says.
But Kieschnick's performance
of this "role" has come under fire
from critics of his work on the so
called "Howard Report" on Uni
versity admissions policies.
