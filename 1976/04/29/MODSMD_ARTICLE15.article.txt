# Grad tuition plan to reduce deficit
## 
### William Sposato 
Dean of Graduate Studies W
Bliss Carnochan said yesterday
that he hopes to institute the prop
osed "Advanced Graduate Re
gistration" (AGR) program for
Ph.D. graduate students by next
year.
The AGR program would mean
that fourth year Ph D. candidates
who now pay only terminal
graduate registration fees of $300
per year, would have to pay one
half regular tuition. Next year this
would be $2137.
Current graduate students and
those coming in next fall would be
exempted from the AGR plan
under a special clause in the
proposal, Carnochan said
A report which outlines the
proposal, prepared by the
Graduate Studies Office, indi
cates that the plan would sharply
reduce the University's $10 million

annual deficit and would more
equitably distribute the tuition
costs between graduate and un
dergraduate students
Fellowship aid
Some of the added income
generated by AGR could be used
for graduate fellowship aid. Car
nochan said.
Much of the higher tuition cost
for graduate students would be
paid by fellowship organizations
and thus the new system would
have a minimal effect on students,
according to Carnochan
The University staff benefits
fund — the money paid by the
University for health care and
pension benefits — would also
share some of the burden, since
this fund pays tuition costs for
teaching and research assistants
Graduate Student Touncil
Chairperson Dene Jennings said
last rwght that he is "generally in
favor" of the plan with the qualifi
cation that "TAs (teaching assis
tantships) and RAs (research as
sistantships) should be made av
ailable to the group of students
who would otherwise have to pay
the cost (of the tuition) out of their
own pockets."
Small minority
Such students. Jennings admit
ted. are a small minority of all
graduate students
The plan would keep the Uni
versity in line financially with com
parable institutions, according to
the report A doctorate obtained
here in four years would cost
$14,960. Of six comparable
schools Princeton was the highest
at $17,600 and Harvard had the
lowest total cost at $10,400
The AGR proposal was discus
sed at the Committee on Graduate
Studies meeting yesterday. Car
nochan said the committee saw
no snags" in the plan. But. he ad
ded. the committee has no official
say in the matter. Their position is
only advisory, he said.
