# Current Drama Dept. offering
## 'Miss Julie' a mixed success 
### Michael Fossel 
A short theater piece, like a vig
nette. should display its mastery in
a few powerful strokes, leaving
the panorama of life to more epic
drama. Strindberg s Miss Julie, as
directed by Eliot Sroka and
choreographed by Lori Sroka,
does just this. The acting is inci
sive; the emotions are etched into
an hour and a half performance.
Joseph Siravo, as Jean, an am
bitious and sardonic valet who is
eager to climb to the top of society
in late 19th century Sweden, plays
opposite Sondra West, the
coquettish Miss Julie. The frenzy
of these two principals rises
rapidly through the play culminat
ing on the edge of hysteria.
Sondra West's acting is superb.
Her portrayal of Miss Julie is con
sistent and realistic as she runs a
gamut from self pity to brazen
upper class man-hater. The role is

especially suited to West, al
lowing her abilities a range of ex
pression.
Perhaps less adroit in a more
intimate theater setting than he
was as Orestes in the Orestia this
winter, Joseph Siravos perfor
mance lacked grace at moments.
Nevertheless, his acting varied
between simply good and quite
excellent. No doubt his "larger
than life'' interpretation of Jean will
become polished during the two
week run of Miss Julie.
Pale
Valerie DeJose, as Christine,
the cook, was pale in contrast.
However, in her moments of
anger she was convincing: she
exits the stage, sallying off to
church in a fit of righteousness
and credibility.
The madness of Miss Julie and
Jean is woven amid a colorful fab
ric of dancers, lively music, and an
impressive stage design. The

dancers are both frenetic and ear
thy. Wending their way through
the action of the principals, they
add to the crescendo of emotion
while simultaneously lending sta
bility to the play.
Their performance was en
hanced by the sprightly accom
paniment of Tim Rued, their ac
complished fiddler. Together with
the stage, which gave the audi
ence the illusion of participation in
the Midsummer festival, these
elements alone would have enter
tained. Instead they serve as the
whirling, happy background to the
figure of madness which the prin
cipals create before us.
Miss Julie is worth seeing. It is
short and well paced. While sub
ject to occasional inconsistencies
and emotional non sequiturs.
Miss Julie is an entertaining show
which promises to improve with
each performance. Miss Julie will
play until May 8 in the Nitery.
