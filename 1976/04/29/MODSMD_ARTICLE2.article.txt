# Married undergrads rare
## 
### Kit Warfield 
Less than two percent of Stanford's 6,500 under
graduates encounter reactions like,
"You're 19 and a junior and what??"
"Well I'll be damned!
"What's it like being married and studying too?"
"You must be kidding — I thought undergrads stopped getting
married years ago!"
Many of the 100 Stanford undergraduates who are indeed
married say that married student life is "great."
"People have the crazy idea that being married and going to
school is mutually exclusive," says Marilyn. "But how is it diffe
rent from two students living together off campus, or a group of
roommates in the trailers? They all have to cook, clean and
study, too."
The question is not whether it is feasible to be married and go
to school too, according to Randy, who married his high school
sweetheart two years ago.
"My marriage took priority over everything, even school," he

explained. "But if the marriage is right, school will be right,
there's no question about it. If married students have problems,
they probably shouldn't be married in the first place.
Only two couples interviewed met and were married as Stan
ford undergraduates. Both couples say that marriage was the
most practical step to take.
"We knew we were going to spend the rest of our lives to
gether," says Sheila, who met Weezer on a backpacking trip a
week before they entered Stanford as freshmen. "So, by the end
of junior year marriage seemed the most natural thing to do.
Vicky says she and her husband Marty, both seniors in
psychology, are actually much better students since they were
married. "We don't waste as much time," she says. "It's a lot
more practical when you don't have to make special appoint
ments to see each other."
The couples, some of whom have been married less than six
months and others over three years, agree that school is easier,
not harder.
Ben and Elaine were married the
last day of finals week fall quarter.
Even though they both lived in
Lagunita last year and were con
stantly together, marriage has
made a difference with Ben. "It
has made me a better student. In
stead of wasting time, I try harder
to get my studying done during the
day. Then I can spend evenings
with Elaine," who has already
graduated.
After three years of marriage.
Wayne comments, "There's an
old saying about how marriage
has a stabilizing influence. Well,
I'm doing much better in school
than I ever thought a married stu
dent would do."
Kelly is not only more efficient in
his studying since he was married
in December, he is happier too.
"People in my eating club told
me they couldn't imagine me mar
ried. But I was so depressed by
spring of my sophomore year, with
her in Missouri" — where they met
— "and me here, that it made
sense to marry her and be to
gether. And,"he laughs, "my
phone bill went down!"
Budget time better
Richard also married his high
school sweetheart, as did 13 of
the 25 undergraduates inter
viewed. "I would tell people not to
try it, except that I'm so much hap

pier now than before we were
married." With a wife and new
baby to take care of, he says I
budget my time more properly, in
stead of running around with my
head cut off like I used to."
Some couples commented that
unmarried undergraduates seem
to feel threatened by the thought
of marriage.
"Before I was married I couldn't
have identified with someone my
own age, in my own classes,
being married. Unmarried stu
dents find it very hard to accept
married students their own age,"
says Kelly.
Marilyn finds that a lot of Stan
ford women feel threatened by the
thought of marrfage. And, the
majority of married under
graduates are in fact men. Most of
their wives work, and a few,
mostly older "returning under
graduates, have children.
Of the women married under
graduates, one-third are married
to graduate students. When Mari
lyn and her husband, who is in the
joint law-business program, de
cided to get married, she ran into
what she calls the "anti-Dolly syn
drome."
To catch a man
"A lot of women here feel that
one comes to Stanford for a high
quality education — which is true
— but that a woman who marries
while she's an undergraduate
came to Stanford to catch a man.'
That's ridiculous. I was after my
degree, and I got it. I just hap
pened to get married in the pro
cess."
But students report that even
some of their friends find their

marriage hard to accept. From the
registrar's statistics, it looks as if
marriage among undergraduates
is unacceptable to many these
days. The lowest number of mar
ried undergraduates recently was
117 in 1973, compared with 100
this year. Last year there were 138
married undergrads, with 155,
220 and 298 in '72, '71 and '70.
For some like Sheila and
Weezer, marriage was the right
thing. But even so, "some of our
friends find it easier to just think of
us as boyfriend and girlfriend."
They have been married since last
May. A friend of Weezer's greets
him with a joking "How's the wife
and kids?" every time they meet.
On the other hand, Randy's
friends "gained a buddy — my
wife — so it worked out well for
everyone." Kelly says that his wife
had a harder time accepting his
friends than they had accepting
her.
New friends scarce
Of course, "it is harder to meet
new friends after you are mar
ried," says Catherine, another
undergraduate whose husband is
a graduate student. Everyone
who was interviewed agreed.
"I'm not quite as open to people
in classes as I would be if I were
single," says Wayne. And, says
Marilyn, "you do find that you have
a new responsibility to the other
person, and that takes up some of
the time you might spend with new
friends."
The thing that Weezer notices
the most is that "the girls don't flirt
anymore." He is a physics teach
ing assistant, and "after the
freshman girls in my sections find

On the other hand, Randy's
friends "gained a buddy — my
wife — so it worked out well for
everyone." Kelly says that his wife
had a harder time accepting his
friends than they had accepting
her.
New friends scarce
Of course, "it is harder to meet
new friends after you are mar
ried," says Catherine, another
undergraduate whose husband is
a graduate student. Everyone
who was interviewed agreed.
"I'm not quite as open to people
in classes as I would be if I were
single," says Wayne. And, says
Marilyn, "you do find that you have
a new responsibility to the other
person, and that takes up some of
the time you might spend with new
friends."
The thing that Weezer notices
the most is that "the girls don't flirt
anymore." He is a physics teach
ing assistant, and "after the
freshman girls in my sections find


WEDDING BELLS — A bride and her mother prepare
for a wedding in Memorial Church. Marriage seems to be a dying
institution at Stanford among undergraduates as only 95 of them
are registered as married — compared to almost 300 only five
years ago.
Less than two percent of Stanford's 6,500 under
graduates encounter reactions like,
"You're 19 and a junior and what??"
"Well I'll be damned!
"What's it like being married and studying too?"
"You must be kidding — I thought undergrads stopped getting
married years ago!"
Many of the 100 Stanford undergraduates who are indeed
married say that married student life is "great."
"People have the crazy idea that being married and going to
school is mutually exclusive," says Marilyn. "But how is it diffe
rent from two students living together off campus, or a group of
roommates in the trailers? They all have to cook, clean and
study, too."
The question is not whether it is feasible to be married and go
to school too, according to Randy, who married his high school
sweetheart two years ago.
"My marriage took priority over everything, even school," he

explained. "But if the marriage is right, school will be right,
there's no question about it. If married students have problems,
they probably shouldn't be married in the first place.
Only two couples interviewed met and were married as Stan
ford undergraduates. Both couples say that marriage was the
most practical step to take.
"We knew we were going to spend the rest of our lives to
gether," says Sheila, who met Weezer on a backpacking trip a
week before they entered Stanford as freshmen. "So, by the end
of junior year marriage seemed the most natural thing to do.
Vicky says she and her husband Marty, both seniors in
psychology, are actually much better students since they were
married. "We don't waste as much time," she says. "It's a lot
more practical when you don't have to make special appoint
ments to see each other."
The couples, some of whom have been married less than six
months and others over three years, agree that school is easier,
not harder.
Ben and Elaine were married the
last day of finals week fall quarter.
Even though they both lived in
Lagunita last year and were con
stantly together, marriage has
made a difference with Ben. "It
has made me a better student. In
stead of wasting time, I try harder
to get my studying done during the
day. Then I can spend evenings
with Elaine," who has already
graduated.
After three years of marriage.
Wayne comments, "There's an
old saying about how marriage
has a stabilizing influence. Well,
I'm doing much better in school
than I ever thought a married stu
dent would do."
Kelly is not only more efficient in
his studying since he was married
in December, he is happier too.
"People in my eating club told
me they couldn't imagine me mar
ried. But I was so depressed by
spring of my sophomore year, with
her in Missouri" — where they met
— "and me here, that it made
sense to marry her and be to
gether. And,"he laughs, "my
phone bill went down!"
Budget time better
Richard also married his high
school sweetheart, as did 13 of
the 25 undergraduates inter
viewed. "I would tell people not to
try it, except that I'm so much hap

pier now than before we were
married." With a wife and new
baby to take care of, he says I
budget my time more properly, in
stead of running around with my
head cut off like I used to."
Some couples commented that
unmarried undergraduates seem
to feel threatened by the thought
of marriage.
"Before I was married I couldn't
have identified with someone my
own age, in my own classes,
being married. Unmarried stu
dents find it very hard to accept
married students their own age,"
says Kelly.
Marilyn finds that a lot of Stan
ford women feel threatened by the
thought of marrfage. And, the
majority of married under
graduates are in fact men. Most of
their wives work, and a few,
mostly older "returning under
graduates, have children.
Of the women married under
graduates, one-third are married
to graduate students. When Mari
lyn and her husband, who is in the
joint law-business program, de
cided to get married, she ran into
what she calls the "anti-Dolly syn
drome."
To catch a man
"A lot of women here feel that
one comes to Stanford for a high
quality education — which is true
— but that a woman who marries
while she's an undergraduate
came to Stanford to catch a man.'
That's ridiculous. I was after my
degree, and I got it. I just hap
pened to get married in the pro
cess."
But students report that even
some of their friends find their

marriage hard to accept. From the
registrar's statistics, it looks as if
marriage among undergraduates
is unacceptable to many these
days. The lowest number of mar
ried undergraduates recently was
117 in 1973, compared with 100
this year. Last year there were 138
married undergrads, with 155,
220 and 298 in '72, '71 and '70.
For some like Sheila and
Weezer, marriage was the right
thing. But even so, "some of our
friends find it easier to just think of
us as boyfriend and girlfriend."
They have been married since last
May. A friend of Weezer's greets
him with a joking "How's the wife
and kids?" every time they meet.
On the other hand, Randy's

one comes to Stanford for a high
quality education — which is true
— but that a woman who marries
while she's an undergraduate
came to Stanford to catch a man.'
That's ridiculous. I was after my
degree, and I got it. I just hap
pened to get married in the pro
cess."
But students report that even
some of their friends find their

marriage hard to accept. From the
registrar's statistics, it looks as if
marriage among undergraduates
is unacceptable to many these
days. The lowest number of mar
ried undergraduates recently was
117 in 1973, compared with 100
this year. Last year there were 138
married undergrads, with 155,
220 and 298 in '72, '71 and '70.
For some like Sheila and
Weezer, marriage was the right
thing. But even so, "some of our
friends find it easier to just think of
us as boyfriend and girlfriend."
They have been married since last
May. A friend of Weezer's greets
him with a joking "How's the wife
and kids?" every time they meet.
On the other hand, Randy's
friends "gained a buddy — my
wife — so it worked out well for
everyone." Kelly says that his wife
had a harder time accepting his
friends than they had accepting
her.
New friends scarce
Of course, "it is harder to meet
new friends after you are mar
ried," says Catherine, another
undergraduate whose husband is
a graduate student. Everyone
who was interviewed agreed.
"I'm not quite as open to people
in classes as I would be if I were
single," says Wayne. And, says
Marilyn, "you do find that you have
a new responsibility to the other
person, and that takes up some of
the time you might spend with new
friends."
The thing that Weezer notices
the most is that "the girls don't flirt
anymore." He is a physics teach
ing assistant, and "after the
freshman girls in my sections find


WEDDING BELLS — A bride and her mother prepare
for a wedding in Memorial Church. Marriage seems to be a dying
institution at Stanford among undergraduates as only 95 of them
are registered as married — compared to almost 300 only five
years ago.
Less than two percent of Stanford's 6,500 under
graduates encounter reactions like,
"You're 19 and a junior and what??"
"Well I'll be damned!
"What's it like being married and studying too?"
"You must be kidding — I thought undergrads stopped getting
married years ago!"
Many of the 100 Stanford undergraduates who are indeed
married say that married student life is "great."
"People have the crazy idea that being married and going to
school is mutually exclusive," says Marilyn. "But how is it diffe
rent from two students living together off campus, or a group of
roommates in the trailers? They all have to cook, clean and
study, too."
The question is not whether it is feasible to be married and go
to school too, according to Randy, who married his high school
sweetheart two years ago.
"My marriage took priority over everything, even school," he

explained. "But if the marriage is right, school will be right,
there's no question about it. If married students have problems,
they probably shouldn't be married in the first place.
Only two couples interviewed met and were married as Stan
ford undergraduates. Both couples say that marriage was the
most practical step to take.
"We knew we were going to spend the rest of our lives to
gether," says Sheila, who met Weezer on a backpacking trip a
week before they entered Stanford as freshmen. "So, by the end
of junior year marriage seemed the most natural thing to do.
Vicky says she and her husband Marty, both seniors in
psychology, are actually much better students since they were
married. "We don't waste as much time," she says. "It's a lot
more practical when you don't have to make special appoint
ments to see each other."
The couples, some of whom have been married less than six
months and others over three years, agree that school is easier,
not harder.
Ben and Elaine were married the
last day of finals week fall quarter.
Even though they both lived in
Lagunita last year and were con
stantly together, marriage has
made a difference with Ben. "It
has made me a better student. In
stead of wasting time, I try harder
to get my studying done during the
day. Then I can spend evenings
with Elaine," who has already
graduated.
After three years of marriage.
Wayne comments, "There's an
old saying about how marriage
has a stabilizing influence. Well,
I'm doing much better in school
than I ever thought a married stu
dent would do."
Kelly is not only more efficient in
his studying since he was married
in December, he is happier too.
"People in my eating club told
me they couldn't imagine me mar
ried. But I was so depressed by
spring of my sophomore year, with
her in Missouri" — where they met
— "and me here, that it made
sense to marry her and be to
gether. And,"he laughs, "my
phone bill went down!"
Budget time better
Richard also married his high
school sweetheart, as did 13 of
the 25 undergraduates inter
viewed. "I would tell people not to
try it, except that I'm so much hap

pier now than before we were
married." With a wife and new
baby to take care of, he says I
budget my time more properly, in
stead of running around with my
head cut off like I used to."
Some couples commented that
unmarried undergraduates seem
to feel threatened by the thought
of marriage.
"Before I was married I couldn't
have identified with someone my
own age, in my own classes,
being married. Unmarried stu
dents find it very hard to accept
married students their own age,"
says Kelly.
Marilyn finds that a lot of Stan
ford women feel threatened by the
thought of marrfage. And, the
majority of married under
graduates are in fact men. Most of
their wives work, and a few,
mostly older "returning under
graduates, have children.
Of the women married under
graduates, one-third are married
to graduate students. When Mari
lyn and her husband, who is in the
joint law-business program, de
cided to get married, she ran into
what she calls the "anti-Dolly syn
drome."
