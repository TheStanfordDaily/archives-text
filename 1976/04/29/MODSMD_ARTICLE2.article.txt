# Married undergrads rare

Less than two percent of Stanford's 6,500 under
graduates encounter reactions like,
"You're 19 and a junior and what??"
"Well I'll be damned!
"What's it like being married and studying too?"
"You must be kidding â€” I thought undergrads stopped getting
married years ago!"
Many of the 100 Stanford undergraduates who are indeed
married say that married student life is "great."
"People have the crazy idea that being married and going to
school is mutually exclusive," says Marilyn. "But how is it diffe
rent from two students living together off campus, or a group of
roommates in the trailers? They all have to cook, clean and
study, too."
The question is not whether it is feasible to be married and go
to school too, according to Randy, who married his high school
sweetheart two years ago.
"My marriage took priority over everything, even school," he

explained. "But if the marriage is right, school will be right,
there's no question about it. If married students have problems,
they probably shouldn't be married in the first place.
Only two couples interviewed met and were married as Stan
ford undergraduates. Both couples say that marriage was the
most practical step to take.
"We knew we were going to spend the rest of our lives to
gether," says Sheila, who met Weezer on a backpacking trip a
week before they entered Stanford as freshmen. "So, by the end
of junior year marriage seemed the most natural thing to do.
Vicky says she and her husband Marty, both seniors in
psychology, are actually much better students since they were
married. "We don't waste as much time," she says. "It's a lot
more practical when you don't have to make special appoint
ments to see each other."
The couples, some of whom have been married less than six
months and others over three years, agree that school is easier,
not harder.
