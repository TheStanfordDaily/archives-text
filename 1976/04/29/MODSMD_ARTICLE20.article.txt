# 'Caribou' at Cubberley
## Upcoming film highlights nature's beauty

Going back to nature for some
connotes trotting back up into the
foothills and. for maximum effect,
avoiding Interstate 280. For
others, it means heading for the
Sierras and backpacking in and
avoiding mechanized civilization
for a week or two.
For Fred and Elaine Meader, it
means shedding as many of the
trappings of the world as possible
and retreating as far away from
progress as they can. They
headed with their three-year-old
son up to the Brooks Mountain
Range in Alaska, 85 miles north of
the Arctic Circle, 50 miles from
their nearest neighbor There they
constructed a log cabin and
started their alternative living.
If the Meaders sound like a
couple disillusioned by Vietnam
and Watergate, they're not. Not
because that sort of thing wouldn t
bother them, but because they
have been living in the far snowy
reaches of Alaska since 1960
In addition to setting them
selves up in the wilderness, the
Meaders have produced a visually
beautiful film of their experienced
there. Called Year Of The
Caribou, it chronicles their exis

tence and survival in a place few
even know about.
Unique
While it does not fully explain
the Meaders' viewpoint, it does
provide a unique memoir of life
such as our ancestors might have
lived it. Fred Meader has pointed
out, though, that Primitive man,
whom we took as our ideal, had an
innocence we could never hope to
achieve."
The Meaders will be here at
Stanford with The Year Of The
Caribou tomorrow night. It will be
screeened in Cubberley Au
ditorium at 7 and 9:30 p.m.
Technically, it is a well
constructed film. Scenes of Elaine
Meader swimming are intercut
with scenes of ducks on the lake,
emphasizing how close the
Meaders have actually gotten to
the primitive level of communal,
natural living that they desired.
The scenery is delightful. The
lake, mountains, trees, and wild
animals who grew to recognize
and accept the Meaders' pre
sence are all carefully photo
qraphed to reflect their beauty.
VaJley
The title refers to the Meaders'
livelihood. They depended on the
caribou that migrated through

their valley every year for food,
clothing, thread, sleeping bags,
among other items. No part of the
caribous they shot went unused,
right down to the brains. Their in
genuity in their adopted home is
amazing, as if they'd been brought
up in the wilderness.

Actually, both Fred and Elaine
are from New England. He said
that in 1959, when he started re
searching in libraries for books on
the subject of living in the wilder
ness, the sources were pitifully
few. It is better now, he said, but
not by much. His wife is currently

writing a book about their experi
ences.
The film is an interesting and
informative look at a way of life as
far removed from our lives today
as can be imagined, set in an at
mosphere of creativity and
natural, unmolested beauty.


HERE COMES SANTAâ€”The frozen beauty of the Alaskan wilderness is beautifully captured in The
Year of the Caribou, a film by Fred and Elaine Meader, who are showing the film tomorrow night at
Cubberley Auditorium.
