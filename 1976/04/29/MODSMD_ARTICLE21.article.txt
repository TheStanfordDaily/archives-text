out that I'm married. I don't get any
offers in return for giving them an
A."
But, seriously, says his wife, the
only detrimental effect their mar
riage had was on her tuition scho
larship.
Aid changed
She explains, "I went into the
Stanford financial aids office be
fore we were married to make
sure that it wouldn't affect my
grant. They told me that every
thing would be fine: in fact, that

they allow more for living ex
penses if you're married. Yet,
when I received the notice of aid,
they had given me a large loan in
place of the large grant I used to
get. That's not exactly the same!"
Other couples have had less
trouble. For the majority of mar
ried undergraduates interviewed,
their parents have continued pay
ing tuition, "regardless of our mari
tal status." A few have private
scholarships which did not
change, and in other cases, "the

financial aids people were still as
helpful as they've always been."
"But people don't usually ask
where the money comes from,
says one student. "They ask who
does the housework."
Both do housework
"We both do," says Marty.
"Vicky and I trade cooking every
other night, because there is no
way either one of us has more
time than the other to cook or
clean."
Neither of us knew how to cook

in the first place." Vicky adds, so
we both learned I can't imagine
how two students married to each
other could do it any other way.
Other couples try to handle it
the same way. depending on their
situation. Sheila has an easy quar
ter, and Weezer is working hard
as a TA. so she does more of the
housework.
Kelly spends more time at home
than his wife, who usually works
evening shifts as a nurse, so split
ting the cleaning works well for
him too. ' When I'm home I do the
dishes and when she's home she
does them." he explains.
Three separations
There are, of course, those un
dergraduates whose marriages
didn't last. Three couples sepa
rated in the last year, but none of
these reported that conflicts with
school had anything to do with
their separations.
At the other extreme are a few
women who came to Stanford
when they were already wives and
mothers, and have stuck to both
school and their marriages. One
sophomore was married in high
school and accepted at Stanford
at the same time. She had a baby
as a freshman. Needless to say,
she finds it difficult to go to school
with a husband and a baby, but
I'm doing it," she says.
Most other women say that

they'll wait until after graduate
school to think about children.
Sheila says that when she, tells
people she is in fact going o law
school next year, the '"ouble
whammy — married and going to
law school — really shocks them.
Even so, at least 10 of the women
interviewed will go to graduate
school next year, married or not
"I've seen marriages at the Bus
iness School falling apart, says
Catherine, whose husband is a
graduate. I think they have prob
lems because the husband is in
school and the wife has a lousy
job."
Mary has been married forhhre r
entire college career, but not to
the man on the cover (He has
been married for four months, but
not to Mary.)
"It's definitely easier to gc
through school married,'' she
says. She went to Foothill for two
years, and will graduate from
Stanford this June Of course,
she says. I have no idea what it's
like to date, to live in a dorm, to go
out and get drunk on weekends —
I've missed all that."
But she wouldn t have missed
the last four years of school and
marriage for anything. Neither
would the rest of the married un
dergraduates at Stanford
As Randy says, Marriage
changes everthmg — and I love
it!"


ALMOST READY—Katie Anderson, Memorial Church's wedding hostess, pins a corsage on the
mother of the bride just before the ceremony. Anderson relates that she has twelve weddings of
undergraduates scheduled immediately after graduation. Fewer and fewer undergraduates are get
ting married while they are still students, however.
