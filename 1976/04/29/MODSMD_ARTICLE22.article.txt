SF unions reject proposal
SAN FRANCISCO — Union leaders re
jected the city's latest offer to settle the
29-aay strike yesterday, but presented a
counterproposal which was aimed at
guaranteeing strikers no pay cuts.
Jack Crowley, executive secretary of the
San Francisco Labor Council, said late last
night that the supervisors would consider
the union's proposal today and the labor
leaders would meet with the city's
negotiator this afternoon.
Details of the two proposals were not
made public, but Plumbers Union head Joe
Mazzola told reporters the city offer was
one-sided.
We want to protect ourself against a de
crease in salary," said Mazzola These
men all have a living standard based on
their present income "
There was no immediate reaction from
supervisors to the counterproposal deli
vered to city negotiator Patrick Mahler.
Quentm Kopp, president of the governing
Board of Supervisors, said the city offer
bears not only the stamp of approval of the
Board of Supervisors but also top labor
leaders "
'Deep Throat' named?
SAN FRANCISCO — Deep Throat," the
codenamed source for many of the
Washington Post s disclosures about the
Watergate cover-up, was acting on instruc
tions of the CIA to protect the agency from
media scrutiny, Rolling Stone magazine
reported yesterday.
In a copyrighted article, the magazine
identifies the celebrated source as Robert
Bennett, former owner of a Washington
public relations firm that served as a front

for the CIA. It was Bennett, the magazine
says, who supplied Post reporter Bob
Woodward with many details of the coverup
conducted in the Nixon White House.
Rolling Stone reports that the informa
tion received by Woodward was part of a
CIA effort to keep the media from inquiring
into the role of the spy agency and,
peripherally, the late billionaire Howard
Hughes.
Carter confident of nomination
PHILADELPHIA — Jimmy Carter, a dou
ble landslide winner in Pennsylvania, said
yesterday it is unlikely he can be stopped
short of the Democratic presidential nomi
nation. But it seems as though Sen. Hubert
Humphrey (D-Minn.) is preparing to try.
The Pennsylvania verdict, with Carter a
big winner in both sides of a presidential
primary that measured popularity and also
picked delegates, left the former Georgia
governor with no real challengers among
the candidates he has faced in nine
primaries.
But Humphrey, in Washington, signaled
a likely go-ahead for supporters who want
to set up what they call an exploratory
committee to assess his prospects for pres
idential nomination.
Such a committee is no more than the
cover for a campaign committee that will
seek to keep Humphrey's prospects alive
for active candidacy after the primary voting
ends on June 8.

Meanwhile, California Gov. Edmund
Brown Jr. launched his national presidential
campaign in Maryland yesterday with a
proclamation that the race for the Democra
tic nomination is wide open.
Brown denied at a crowded airport news
conference here that Carter has the nomi
nation sewed up.
"I think the Democratic nomination is
open. If I thought otherwise, I would not be
here today," Brown said.
The 38-year-old governor acknowledged
that he is getting into the race late but said
he is "coming in with a lot of energy and a
fresh spirit."
Controls on CIA, FBI called for
WASHINGTON — The Senate Intelli
gence Committee, reporting U.S. intelli
gence agencies used burglary, blackmail
and illegal bugging to spy on the private
lives of Americans, yesterday called for
tight controls on the CIA and FBI. particu
larly by Congress.
In a 396-page report, the committee de
tailed previously disclosed abuses such as
CIA domestic spying and electronic eaves
dropping by the National Security Agency.
It made 96 recommendations to sharply
curtail FBI activities and prohibit other
agencies from virtually any involvement in
domestic investigations.
"All this occured because intelligence
agencies were ordered to break the law, felt

they had a right to break the law, and even
felt they had a duty ... to break the law."
Sen. Walter Mondale (D-Minn.) said.
Sen. Richard Schwieker (R-Pa.) added
that "Congress bears a heavy responsibility
for ignoring its constitutional role."

SF unions reject proposal
SAN FRANCISCO — Union leaders re
jected the city's latest offer to settle the
29-aay strike yesterday, but presented a
counterproposal which was aimed at
guaranteeing strikers no pay cuts.
Jack Crowley, executive secretary of the
San Francisco Labor Council, said late last
night that the supervisors would consider
the union's proposal today and the labor
leaders would meet with the city's
negotiator this afternoon.
Details of the two proposals were not
made public, but Plumbers Union head Joe
Mazzola told reporters the city offer was
one-sided.
We want to protect ourself against a de
crease in salary," said Mazzola These
men all have a living standard based on
their present income "
There was no immediate reaction from
supervisors to the counterproposal deli
vered to city negotiator Patrick Mahler.
Quentm Kopp, president of the governing
Board of Supervisors, said the city offer
bears not only the stamp of approval of the
Board of Supervisors but also top labor
leaders "
'Deep Throat' named?
SAN FRANCISCO — Deep Throat," the
codenamed source for many of the
Washington Post s disclosures about the
Watergate cover-up, was acting on instruc
tions of the CIA to protect the agency from
media scrutiny, Rolling Stone magazine
reported yesterday.
In a copyrighted article, the magazine
identifies the celebrated source as Robert
Bennett, former owner of a Washington
public relations firm that served as a front

for the CIA. It was Bennett, the magazine
says, who supplied Post reporter Bob
Woodward with many details of the coverup
conducted in the Nixon White House.
Rolling Stone reports that the informa
tion received by Woodward was part of a
CIA effort to keep the media from inquiring
into the role of the spy agency and,
peripherally, the late billionaire Howard
Hughes.
Carter confident of nomination
PHILADELPHIA — Jimmy Carter, a dou
ble landslide winner in Pennsylvania, said
yesterday it is unlikely he can be stopped
short of the Democratic presidential nomi
nation. But it seems as though Sen. Hubert
Humphrey (D-Minn.) is preparing to try.
The Pennsylvania verdict, with Carter a
big winner in both sides of a presidential
primary that measured popularity and also
picked delegates, left the former Georgia
governor with no real challengers among
the candidates he has faced in nine
primaries.
But Humphrey, in Washington, signaled
a likely go-ahead for supporters who want
to set up what they call an exploratory
committee to assess his prospects for pres
idential nomination.
Such a committee is no more than the
cover for a campaign committee that will
seek to keep Humphrey's prospects alive
for active candidacy after the primary voting
ends on June 8.

Meanwhile, California Gov. Edmund
Brown Jr. launched his national presidential
campaign in Maryland yesterday with a
proclamation that the race for the Democra
tic nomination is wide open.
Brown denied at a crowded airport news
conference here that Carter has the nomi
nation sewed up.
"I think the Democratic nomination is
open. If I thought otherwise, I would not be
here today," Brown said.
The 38-year-old governor acknowledged
that he is getting into the race late but said
he is "coming in with a lot of energy and a
fresh spirit."
Controls on CIA, FBI called for
WASHINGTON — The Senate Intelli
gence Committee, reporting U.S. intelli
gence agencies used burglary, blackmail
and illegal bugging to spy on the private
lives of Americans, yesterday called for
tight controls on the CIA and FBI. particu
larly by Congress.
In a 396-page report, the committee de
tailed previously disclosed abuses such as
CIA domestic spying and electronic eaves
dropping by the National Security Agency.
It made 96 recommendations to sharply
curtail FBI activities and prohibit other
agencies from virtually any involvement in
domestic investigations.
"All this occured because intelligence
agencies were ordered to break the law, felt

they had a right to break the law, and even
felt they had a duty ... to break the law."
Sen. Walter Mondale (D-Minn.) said.
Sen. Richard Schwieker (R-Pa.) added
that "Congress bears a heavy responsibility
for ignoring its constitutional role."

SF unions reject proposal
SAN FRANCISCO — Union leaders re
jected the city's latest offer to settle the
29-aay strike yesterday, but presented a
counterproposal which was aimed at
guaranteeing strikers no pay cuts.
Jack Crowley, executive secretary of the
San Francisco Labor Council, said late last
night that the supervisors would consider
the union's proposal today and the labor
leaders would meet with the city's
negotiator this afternoon.
Details of the two proposals were not
made public, but Plumbers Union head Joe
Mazzola told reporters the city offer was
one-sided.
We want to protect ourself against a de
crease in salary," said Mazzola These
men all have a living standard based on
their present income "
There was no immediate reaction from
supervisors to the counterproposal deli
vered to city negotiator Patrick Mahler.
Quentm Kopp, president of the governing
Board of Supervisors, said the city offer
bears not only the stamp of approval of the
Board of Supervisors but also top labor
leaders "
'Deep Throat' named?
SAN FRANCISCO — Deep Throat," the
codenamed source for many of the
Washington Post s disclosures about the
Watergate cover-up, was acting on instruc
tions of the CIA to protect the agency from
media scrutiny, Rolling Stone magazine
reported yesterday.
In a copyrighted article, the magazine
identifies the celebrated source as Robert
Bennett, former owner of a Washington
public relations firm that served as a front

for the CIA. It was Bennett, the magazine
says, who supplied Post reporter Bob
Woodward with many details of the coverup
conducted in the Nixon White House.
Rolling Stone reports that the informa
tion received by Woodward was part of a
CIA effort to keep the media from inquiring
into the role of the spy agency and,
peripherally, the late billionaire Howard
Hughes.
Carter confident of nomination
PHILADELPHIA — Jimmy Carter, a dou
ble landslide winner in Pennsylvania, said
yesterday it is unlikely he can be stopped
short of the Democratic presidential nomi
nation. But it seems as though Sen. Hubert
Humphrey (D-Minn.) is preparing to try.
The Pennsylvania verdict, with Carter a
big winner in both sides of a presidential
primary that measured popularity and also
picked delegates, left the former Georgia
governor with no real challengers among
the candidates he has faced in nine
primaries.
But Humphrey, in Washington, signaled
a likely go-ahead for supporters who want
to set up what they call an exploratory
committee to assess his prospects for pres
idential nomination.
Such a committee is no more than the
cover for a campaign committee that will
seek to keep Humphrey's prospects alive
for active candidacy after the primary voting
ends on June 8.

Meanwhile, California Gov. Edmund
Brown Jr. launched his national presidential
campaign in Maryland yesterday with a
proclamation that the race for the Democra
tic nomination is wide open.
Brown denied at a crowded airport news
conference here that Carter has the nomi
nation sewed up.
"I think the Democratic nomination is
open. If I thought otherwise, I would not be
here today," Brown said.
The 38-year-old governor acknowledged
that he is getting into the race late but said
he is "coming in with a lot of energy and a
fresh spirit."
Controls on CIA, FBI called for
WASHINGTON — The Senate Intelli
gence Committee, reporting U.S. intelli
gence agencies used burglary, blackmail
and illegal bugging to spy on the private
lives of Americans, yesterday called for
tight controls on the CIA and FBI. particu
larly by Congress.
In a 396-page report, the committee de
tailed previously disclosed abuses such as
CIA domestic spying and electronic eaves
dropping by the National Security Agency.
It made 96 recommendations to sharply
curtail FBI activities and prohibit other
agencies from virtually any involvement in
domestic investigations.
"All this occured because intelligence
agencies were ordered to break the law, felt

they had a right to break the law, and even
felt they had a duty ... to break the law."
Sen. Walter Mondale (D-Minn.) said.
Sen. Richard Schwieker (R-Pa.) added
that "Congress bears a heavy responsibility
for ignoring its constitutional role."
