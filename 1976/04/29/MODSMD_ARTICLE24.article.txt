# Where to find a court
## It sounds tough at Stanford, but it's possible!

Frustration.
Is drawing 4856 in the housing draw.
Is waiting for the Stanford track team to beat
UCLA or USC.
Is the tennis situation on the Farm.
No, Head Tennis Coach Dick Gould has not
resigned. And Gene Mayer hasn't deserted
Stanford for the glamorous life of the pro net
circuit.
Both the men's and women's tennis teams
are doing quite well, thank you. Gould's men
are ranked second in the nation behind UCLA
and the Card women hold an equally lofty posi
tion.
It's just that if you're name doesn't happen to
be Forood or Maze, finding an available tennis
court is almost as hard as finding an empty
seat at a talk by David Frye.
Classes and team practices devour most of
the tennis day.
During non-class hours the fight for the 25
courts on campus is intense. (There are 26
courts on the Farm if you count Maples). But
the battle reaches an uneasy truce at dusk,
because none of the courts are lighted.
This situation could change. Installing lights
on the Varsity and Encina courts has high prior

ity on the Athletic Department's list of im
provements.
"Right now we'd like to put two or three
courts in Escondido Village," said Assoc. Ath
letic Director Bob Young. "We're hoping for a
gift. Our next priority would be lighting." But
Young admitted that the gift has not yet
"materialized."
The Encina and Varsity complexes provide
some order to the chaos; courts must be
cleared on the hour if others are waiting to play.
The Varisty courts also use a reservation sys
tem, but much of the afternoon — prime time
for tennis players — is blocked off for tennis
team practice.
There are 11 courts in the Varsity complex
and they are rarely free after 9:30 a.m. And
Encina's six courts are in use most of the day.
Though the eight Roble courts are probably
the most accessible on campus, few players
follow the sign-up list. And classes eat up much
of the Roble courts during the day.
But if you're willing to travel off campus, you
may be in luck. (No, that line isn't in the draw
booklet.)

School's seven courts. Located across El
