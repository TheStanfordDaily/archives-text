# Where to find a court
## It sounds tough at Stanford, but it's possible! 
### Chris Baker 
Frustration.
Is drawing 4856 in the housing draw.
Is waiting for the Stanford track team to beat
UCLA or USC.
Is the tennis situation on the Farm.
No, Head Tennis Coach Dick Gould has not
resigned. And Gene Mayer hasn't deserted
Stanford for the glamorous life of the pro net
circuit.
Both the men's and women's tennis teams
are doing quite well, thank you. Gould's men
are ranked second in the nation behind UCLA
and the Card women hold an equally lofty posi
tion.
It's just that if you're name doesn't happen to
be Forood or Maze, finding an available tennis
court is almost as hard as finding an empty
seat at a talk by David Frye.
Classes and team practices devour most of
the tennis day.
During non-class hours the fight for the 25
courts on campus is intense. (There are 26
courts on the Farm if you count Maples). But
the battle reaches an uneasy truce at dusk,
because none of the courts are lighted.
This situation could change. Installing lights
on the Varsity and Encina courts has high prior

ity on the Athletic Department's list of im
provements.
"Right now we'd like to put two or three
courts in Escondido Village," said Assoc. Ath
letic Director Bob Young. "We're hoping for a
gift. Our next priority would be lighting." But
Young admitted that the gift has not yet
"materialized."
The Encina and Varsity complexes provide
some order to the chaos; courts must be
cleared on the hour if others are waiting to play.
The Varisty courts also use a reservation sys
tem, but much of the afternoon — prime time
for tennis players — is blocked off for tennis
team practice.
There are 11 courts in the Varsity complex
and they are rarely free after 9:30 a.m. And
Encina's six courts are in use most of the day.
Though the eight Roble courts are probably
the most accessible on campus, few players
follow the sign-up list. And classes eat up much
of the Roble courts during the day.
But if you're willing to travel off campus, you
may be in luck. (No, that line isn't in the draw
booklet.)
The closest facilities are Palo Alto High
School's seven courts. Located across El

Camino Real from the stadium, these courts
are usually very crowded. The courts are also
lighted.
Rinconada Park is one of the most popular
off-campus courts. Located right off Embar
cadero, Rinconada's six lighted courts are in
use much of the day. They are also popular at
night.
Mitchell Park, located at 600 East Meadow,
has seven lighted courts and they're in good
shape. _ ....
Gunn High
Many of Stanford's tennis players prepped at
Gunn High School, and one look at the facilities
will tell you why Gunn hasn't lost a tennis
match in a long time. Gunn's seven courts,
although often plagued by high winds, are in
good shape. It's located at 780 Arastradero.
Cubberley High School, at 400 Middle f ield
Road, has six courts and they re in great
shape.
The largest number of courts, 12, are lo
cated at Los Altos High School. Located at 201
East Almond Ave., the courts are in good
shape.

Jordan Junior High School, at Middlefield
and California, has six courts.
Terman Junior High School, at 655 Aras
tradero, has four courts.
Small courts
Palo Alto also has a couple of smaller courts.
Weisshaar Park, located on Dartmouth bet
ween California and College Ave., has two
courts. Peer Park, located at 899 Park Blvd.,
has two courts. And Hoover Park, located at
2901 Cowper, also has two courts.
Nealon Park, located on Middle Ave., has
four courts. Burgess Park, located on Laurel
Ave., has four courts. The Willow School, at
620 Willow, has three courts. La Entrada on
Sharron Rd., has two courts. And the Encinal
School, located at Encinal Ave., also has two
courts.
McKenzie Park, located at 707 Fremont
Ave., is probably the best of Los Altos' courts.
McKenzie has two courts. Other facilities in
Los Altos include Montclair Park, located at
1160 St., Joseph, this part has two courts.
Egan Junior High, at 100 West Portola, has two
courts. And Covington High, at 201 Covington
Rd. also has two courts.

An empty court —a rare sight at Stanford.
Frustration.
Is drawing 4856 in the housing draw.
Is waiting for the Stanford track team to beat
UCLA or USC.
Is the tennis situation on the Farm.
No, Head Tennis Coach Dick Gould has not
resigned. And Gene Mayer hasn't deserted
Stanford for the glamorous life of the pro net
circuit.
Both the men's and women's tennis teams
are doing quite well, thank you. Gould's men
are ranked second in the nation behind UCLA
and the Card women hold an equally lofty posi
tion.
It's just that if you're name doesn't happen to
be Forood or Maze, finding an available tennis
court is almost as hard as finding an empty
seat at a talk by David Frye.
Classes and team practices devour most of
the tennis day.
During non-class hours the fight for the 25
courts on campus is intense. (There are 26
courts on the Farm if you count Maples). But
the battle reaches an uneasy truce at dusk,
because none of the courts are lighted.
This situation could change. Installing lights
on the Varsity and Encina courts has high prior

ity on the Athletic Department's list of im
provements.
"Right now we'd like to put two or three
courts in Escondido Village," said Assoc. Ath
letic Director Bob Young. "We're hoping for a
gift. Our next priority would be lighting." But
Young admitted that the gift has not yet
"materialized."
The Encina and Varsity complexes provide
some order to the chaos; courts must be
cleared on the hour if others are waiting to play.
The Varisty courts also use a reservation sys
tem, but much of the afternoon — prime time
for tennis players — is blocked off for tennis
team practice.
There are 11 courts in the Varsity complex
and they are rarely free after 9:30 a.m. And
Encina's six courts are in use most of the day.
Though the eight Roble courts are probably
the most accessible on campus, few players
follow the sign-up list. And classes eat up much
of the Roble courts during the day.
But if you're willing to travel off campus, you
may be in luck. (No, that line isn't in the draw
booklet.)
The closest facilities are Palo Alto High
School's seven courts. Located across El

Camino Real from the stadium, these courts
are usually very crowded. The courts are also
lighted.
Rinconada Park is one of the most popular
off-campus courts. Located right off Embar
cadero, Rinconada's six lighted courts are in
use much of the day. They are also popular at
night.
Mitchell Park, located at 600 East Meadow,

shape. _ ....
Gunn High
Many of Stanford's tennis players prepped at
Gunn High School, and one look at the facilities
will tell you why Gunn hasn't lost a tennis
match in a long time. Gunn's seven courts,
although often plagued by high winds, are in
good shape. It's located at 780 Arastradero.
Cubberley High School, at 400 Middle f ield

shape.

Jordan Junior High School, at Middlefield
