# Beginners need to relax and have fun
## 
### John Roos 
Playing catch with a football
or a baseball for the first time
doesn't take any particular
skills. Shooting a basketball
through a hoop also needs no
extraordinary ability for an
adult new to the sport.
But stick two beginners ac
ross the tennis court from each
other with racquets in their
hands, and frustration and
panic will soon follow.
Tennis is one of the hardest
sports at the beginner stage,
but since every player had to
pass the stage at one point,
maybe there are some hints
that can ease the transition
from beginner to intermediate.
Stanford tennis coach Dick

Gould says that there are.
They key to quick learning at
the beginning, he says, is to
"learn to relax."
"If you go on the court just to
have fun, you can't help but
improve," he says. "But if
you're out there struggling
over every shot, you're going
to be in trouble.
"There's an enormous dif
ference between a teacher or
a machine hitting you the
same shot, and then someone
on the other side of the court
hitting you shots during a
match.
"In a match, things are un-

Novices are at a frustrating point

controlled. There are a lot
more variables. Everything's
different from shot to shot. The
placement, the spin, the
bounce, the height.
"You've got to slow the
game down. Try to relax and
take your time. You have to rid
yourself of as many variables
as possible."
Ron Beck, a Stanford stu
dent who has spent the last
two summers as an instructor
at John Gardiner's Tennis
Ranch in Carmel Valley, has a
similar philosophy.
"The game is completely dif
ferent when you switch from a

controlled instructional ses
sion to an uncontrolled game
with a friend," he says."The
way to overcome that differ
ence is to avoid thinking of all
the details you've been taught.
Try to have fun without burden
ing your strokes with too much
thought."
Beck has taught privately for
the past four years in Los
Angeles and the Palo Alto area
and says that one of the most
important things he instructs
students to do between les
sons is to rally with friends and
practice the strokes.
"I want the beginner to feel
comfortable with his shots. But

you can't feel comfortable if
you're forcing everything.
When you're rallying to im
prove your shots, don't smash
everything, just try to keep the
ball in the court as consistently
as you can."
Gould also believes that
practice has to be different
than playing.
"There's a time to practice
and a time to play," he says.
"When you're playing, don't try
to think of every little thing. But
when you're practicing with a
teacher, that's when you work
on specific points.
"In baseball, the guy who
wins the batting championship
has failed two out of every
three times he goes up to hit
