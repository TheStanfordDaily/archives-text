## editorial Students' protest 
### 
Students and disgruntled faculty members at Spelman
College in Georgia last week joined in a successful pro
test against what they saw as an unresponsive and un
sympathetic board of trustees.
Spelman is an all-woman, predominantly black school
in Atlanta. Its male president recently announced his
resignation and recommended that his successor be a
black female. Students and faculty members also called
for the appointment of a black female president.
But a search committee of the board of trustees, which
included no students, recommended a male for the job.
Many students contended that the board had never seri
ously considered a broad range of candidates, and that
its choice was predetermined.
When the board accepted the committee's recom
mendation, students and faculty members locked the
trustees in their meeting room, demanding student and
faculty representation both On the board and on its search
committee. After 27 consecutive hours the board agreed
to compromise and granted the demands.
It is unfortunate that students and faculty members at
any institution should be driven to such lengths before the
school's governing body will seriously listen to their opin
ions. Hopefully, the Stanford Board of Trustees will soon
allow student representation without the need for such a
protest.
