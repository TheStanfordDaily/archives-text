# Tennis business booms
## 
### Mark Simonian 
"It's an exploding industry."
"It's all over â€” department
stores, specialty stores, gen
eral sporting goods stores."
The"it" is tennis. And
people in the tennis industry,
like the two quoted above, are
the first to admit (with a smile)
that business is booming.
"It's one of the fastest grow
ing sports on an individual
basis," says Rod Farrow of
Sports Exchange, a store that
specializes in the resale of all
sorts of used tennis equip
ment.
Alex Swetka, owner of a
tennis store that bears his
name, points to a number of
new tennis specialty shops,
departments, clubs and pro
outlets that have sprung up
over the last five years.
Everybody
"Everybody handles tennis
now," he says.
And it seems as if everybody
wants to play the game.
"People have discovered a
great game," Swetka com
ments. "The word got around."
Swetka says he believes
that people are more con
scious about physical fitness
now, and tennis is an enjoy
able way to keep in shape.
He adds that the so-called
tennis battle of the sexes bet

ween Bobby Riggs and Billie
Jean King sparked public in
terest in the game, as have
televised tennis matches.
Farrow attributes the tennis
boom to a different set of
factors, though. "It's indicative
of a trend towards increasing
leisure time and increasing af
fluence," he says.
Farrow also says the mid-
Peninsula environment is
"perfect" for tennis en
thusiasts.
Who plays?
Who are these people that
spend their hard-earned bucks
to bat a little ball back and forth
over a net?
Farrow categorizes his bus
iness as roughly 40 percent
novices, 40 percent proficient
players and 20 percent ex
perts.
Swetka says a majority of
people he sees in his store are
more experienced players,
since he doesn't deal in used
goods or tennis clothing.
Metal racquet
Both proprietors agreed that
the hottest item today is the
metal tennis racquet. A rela :
tive newcomer to the game,
the metal racket available
today lasts longer and plays as
well as wood racquets, accord
ing to Swetka.
One of the "latest" inven

tions for the tennis specialist is
the graphite racquet, but both
men agree that it is still a
novelty. At $150 to $250 for
graphite "gamer," it's a pretty
expensive novelty nonethe
less.
For those who take their
tennis a little less seriously,
however, Farrow says his
store offers used tennis balls.
Beginners can purchase the
less bouncy, softer used balls
for under a quarter a piece
(much cheaperthan new balls)
just for practice.
