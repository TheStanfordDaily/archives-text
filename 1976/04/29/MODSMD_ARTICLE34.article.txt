# All you need to start the game of tennis
## The
						Stanford Shopping Bag 
### Jill Lieber 
These days a tennis player
who's shopping for a new rac
quet is in the same predica
ment as the kid who walks into
a candy store with one dime.
He faces the agony of select
ing only one racquet from a
multitude of appealing models.
However, Wilson has made
the selection of tennis rac
quets easier for the potential
buyer by promoting the Jack
Kramer Autograph racquet so
well that its name comes to
mind immediately to those
people who are asked for ad
vice in choosing racquets. Wil
son has put Kramer racquets
into the hands of many of the
nation's top players.
Players such as Raul
Ramirez, ranked No. 7 in the
world by Tennis magazine,
and college stars such as
Stanford's Pat DuPre, John
Rast and Marcy O'Keefe,
along with the nation's top
ranked amateur, Brian
Teacher of UCLA, all use Jack
Kramer Autograph racquets.
The Kramer racquet is not
just for the nation's top players
however.lt suits everyone's
needs.
Its flexibility, that is, the
amount of "give" in the frame,
is especially good for a begin
ner. The more flexible a rac
quet is, the more power it will
add to shots by its greater

whiplash action.
A beginner wants help in
getting the ball over the net,
because he is not hitting the
ball very hard. The Kramer
racquet will give as the ball hits
the strings and "throw" it back
over the net.
It is an all-purpose racquet.
A player who is advanced will
find that it offers control in re
turning hard serves. A player
can get the stiffness he needs
for powerful round strokes
from this racquet also.
Racquets are strung with
nylon or gut. Whereas today's
top players can break their
nylon strings in as little as two
weeks, beginning tennis

players will find that nylon is
their best investment.
Nylon withstands greater
variance in temperature. Gut
does not wear well in humid
weather.
Many of the advanced
players prefer to have their
racquet strung with gut. Gut
pockets the ball better than
nylon and therefore puts more
spin on the ball. Beginners
want to concentrate on hitting
the ball flat and also work for
control. They should not be
concerned with putting spin on
the ball; therefore; gut string
ing is not necessary.
The accompanying table
shows comparative prices of
the Jack Kramer Autograph
racquet, the cost of stringing it
with low priced nylon and the
price of a can of tennis balls —
all you'll need to start the
game.
Once you have invested
time and money in the purch
ase of a racquet, take good
care of it. Get a racquet cover
and use it. It is unnecessary to
keep a wooden racquet in a
press off the court. It will usu
ally cause more damage than

help.
Always store your racquet
vertically on a rack and not
tossed in the closet or in the
trunk of your car. Clean the

grip with mild soap and water
from time to time and treat the
racquet as you would any
precision-crafted item —
handle with care.
