# 'Crafts pay' is problem

Workers were the heroes of San Francisco in the
general strike of 1934 and the "streamlined strike"
of 1936-37. They remained the city's heroes for
years afterward, as the war brought prosperity and
the workers themselves moved into the upwardly
mobile row stuccos of San Francisco's outer dis
tricts.
When, after the war, it was suggested that craft
workers employed by the city should receive pay on
a par with their brothers in private industry, San
Franciscans overwhelmingly agreed and the "crafts
pay" provision was passed.
Although the original "crafts pay" provision did not
include laborers, the mysterious semantics of sub
sequent labor negotiations have brought members
of the Laborers' Union under the crafts pay formula.
Some of them — gardeners, for instance — are
skilled workers. Most of them — streetsweepers, for
instance — are not.
Regardless of whether the original motive to give
skilled workers special treatment was elitist, San
Franciscans didn't intend the provision to cover
iaborers. The shock wave started when a news
paper article noted that after 1976 — because of
the "crafts pay" formula — some streetsweepers
would make $17,300 a year.
Citywide issue
The 517,000-a-year streetsweeper became a
citywide issue, despite the fact that no
streetsweeper has yet been paid that wage. Re
sentment ran particularly high among those who
made less for working as hard, among pensioners
on fixed incomes, among people like teachers who
make little more and don't like it, among city workers
not covered by crafts pay provisions despite obvious
skills and among those who believe that a lot of city
employment is a boondoggle anyway. Not inciden
tally, the dirtiness of the streets is a major issue in
San Francisco.
In November 1975, San Franciscans voted to
take the crafts pay provision out of the charter — not
by a narrow vote sparked by a new conservative
majority, but by an overwhelmingly two-to-one mar
gin that must have included a lot of union-member
affirmatives. "Yes" votes ran high in minority and
pension neighborhoods that have traditionally sup
ported the labor movement and its favorite politi
cians.
These were neighborhoods that heavily sup
ported George McGovern in 1972 (McGovern car
ried San Francisco) and enabled liberal Democrat
George Moscone to defeat conservative

businessman John Barbagelata for mayor last year
— although Barbagelata was closely identified with
the crafts-pay repeal measure.
It isn't a sign of a revolt against labor, or of a
growing conservatism. Its an indication of resent
ment of the few elitist labor leaders who have risen
to a startling power in the city and who, once in
power, have held the needs of the city's people in
contempt.
'Limited Success'
Only 1900 people are actually on strike (some
craft unions accepted the vote, negotiated sepa
rately. and won raises). Ironically, the strike has had
its little success so far only because of support by
the Transport Workers Union (TWU) whose mem
bers operate the city's buses — and whose mem
bership is more than 50 percent black. This is far
from mutual admiration; the TWU contract with the
city comes up in June, and they're looking out for
themselves.
Most of the other 17,000 or so city workers con
tinue to cross the picket lines. The old days of white
male labor solidarity are gone. Many of the workers
are women, many are members of minorities, many
work under adverse, even miserable conditions that
have been ignored by the elite unions that might
have helped.
The strike is led by leaders who can't take their
workers' case to the people without exposing their
own role in exploiting the middle-class homeowners
and renters. And as a final irony it's a strike, in a city
famed for its relative racial harmony and its toler
ance of variant life styles, that is led by the labor
movement's last Mesozoic defenders of short
haired white maleness.
It won't last much longer.
