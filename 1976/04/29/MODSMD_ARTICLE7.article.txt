### Jack Vaughn 
Possible building code de
ficiencies may force a delay in the
scheduled July opening of the
University Hospital's new $12.6
million wing, Hospital and Clinics
Director Paul Hofmann said yes
terday.
Hofmann said a team of inspec
tors from the California Bureau of
Licensure and Certification, state,
Palo Alto and Santa Clara fire de
partments and two federal prog
rams found the problems in a pre
liminary visit to the hospital April
23.
Robert Bowen of the state
licensing bureau refused to list the
problems until he issues an advis
ory report outlining the deficien
cies and suggesting corrections to
the architect and the building con
tractor.
However. Bowen said the prob
lems are "not insurmountable."
"The building is a good structure,"
he said. "When you deal with a
physical plant of this magnitude,
there are bound to be clean-up
type problems."
Hofmann said the University
requested the preliminary visit to
advise the architect and contractor
as to how the building stood in

relation to hospital building code
requirements.
Hofmann said he did not know
any details about the problems.
"The report was only a preliminary
one," he said. "We have not re
ceived any formal reports as yet,
though we fully expect to be ap
praised of the situation shortly."
He said it would be "inapprop
riate to speculate" publicly on
costs of bringing the building up to
code, though there has been
some speculation on costs among
hospital and planning officials.
Facilities Director James Nel
son said some parts of the new
wing may have to be modified if
they fail to meet code require
ments, but also emphasized that
information on required modifica
tions, if any, has not yet been re
ceived.
Hofmann explained that the
hospital had expected the wing to
be ready for use in May and to
admit its first patients in July.
The wing will add two intensive
care beds to the hospital and in
crease emergency services
facilities. The expansion will also
have X-ray, surgical pathology
and cardiology and postanes
thesia recovery services.
