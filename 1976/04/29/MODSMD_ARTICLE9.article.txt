# USE sues trustees for arbitration delay
## 
### Bill Sing Dan Fiduccia 
United Stanford Employees (USE) filed a lawsuit
yesterday against the University's Board of Trus
tees alleging that the University is delaying the arbit
ration of employe grievances.
The suit, filed in U.S. District Court for the North
ern District of California, seeks temporary and per
manent injunctions and a declaratory judgment
against the University.
The union-University contract allows for binding
arbitration to resolve grievances if preliminary pro
cedures do not result in settlement.
The suit charges that the University has "engaged
in dilatory and delaying tactics with regard to arbitra
tion of charges and grievances" and that "said be
havior constitutes a continuing course of conduct in
violation of the contract."
USE is demanding that the University "be re
strained from in any manner failing or refusing to
perform its obligations" under the contract.
USE President Jim Berk said yesterday there are
about 150 grievances awaiting arbitration.
Douglas Barton, University staff counsel for
employe relations, said last night that he is "puzzled
by the suit in as much as we seem to be doing

nothing but scheduling arbitration."
Barton called the charges in the suit absolutely
unfounded.
"I think Berk knows that," he added
Berk said the University has "just been dilatory
and have dragged things out. They've just put oft
and put off" these cases.
Barton said USE was "engaging in a propaganda
battle" by filing the suit.
USE could be trying to provide a "basis for its
members to believe that the reasons (for the
backlog) are because the University won't schedule
the cases," Barton said.
Meanwhile, some employes are circulating a peti
tion for the decertification of USE as the bargaining
agent for members of the technical, maintenance
and service unit.
If 30 percent or about 450 members, of the unit
sign the petition then an election will have to be held
this summer. Members would then vote either for
USE or for no union at all.
Berk believes anti-union people, and not suppor
ters of an alternative union, are behind the petitions.
A decertification election would have a great ef
fect upon upcoming negotiations for a new contract
between the USE and the University. Berk said.
