Bikes raced through White Plaza on Wednesday,
marking the Stanford Bicycle Safety Fair. The pur
pose of the fair was to heighten awareness among
students, staff and faculty for safety, maintenance and
protection against theft.
Sponsored by the Office of Student Activities,
events of the day included a bike race between the
Administration Lackeys and the Daily Thundertur
keys. Phyllis Amabile (pictured above, left, with or
ganizer Annette Price) was the winner in a drawing
for a bike valued at $120. The bike was donated by the

also included in the fair. Safety Inspection Stations
were set up by Palo Alto Bike Shop, Rhea Schwinn's
Bike Shop and Stanford students.
The Stanford Bike Co-op added a lock display to the
fair. A light display was also offered. Two films,
Tripping on Two Wheels and GO Cycles were pre
sented every half hour.
Issues of the bicycle safety magazine Sprocket Man
are available at the Stanford Fire Station.
