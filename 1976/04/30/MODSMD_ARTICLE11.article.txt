# Atrocities committed for 'ideal'
##

Daniel Brenner

This afternoon in the law school's Kresge
Auditorium, Elie VViesel, a most gifted and
sensitive writer on the predicament of 20th
century morality, will deliver the Fourth
Annual Kent State-Jackson State Memorial
Lecture.
It is fitting that Wiesel should speak here
today. A teen-age survivor of the Nazi death
camps in Auschwitz and Buchenwald,
Wiesel has an intimacy with darkness, a
darkness that moves men and women to
commit atrocity in the name of an ideal
known as the "state" or "order."
Just as it was the darkness of mankind that
could convince enough people actively to
participate in the destruction of European
Jewry and the millions of others who con
tradicted the fascist version of "order," so it
was an acquiescence to the tug of evil incli
nation that, albeit on a reduced proportion,
could lead ordinary, and ordinarily decent
human beings to engage in a butchery of
students six years ago this week.
What happened in May 1970? The events
at Kent, Ohio, on the morning of May 4
resembled those transpiring at several col
lege campuses. Frustrated by President Ni
xon s decision to send American soldiers
into Cambodia at a time when most thought
that the war was winding down, war protes
ters had moved to organizea campus rally at
Kent State University to prepare a public
response.
The rally had been scheduled for noon on
the Kent State green. The Ohio National
Guard, exhausted from overtime duty at a
wildcat labor strike in Akron, had been
summoned to the campus, against the
wishes of the college president, by then-
Gov. James Rhodes.
Four killed
The fn;:- students Killed by the burst of
guardsman gunfire were neither organizers
noractive participants in the rally. Each had
stepped out onto the green merely to ob
serve, as one might anonymously join the
fringe of a crowd assembled at White Plaza.
Although some rocks had been hurled at the

guardsmen, they made no attempt to dis
criminate among members of the crowd
when they opened fire. One of the dead stu
dents, a ROTC cadet at Kent State, was
positioned 100 feet behind the guard when
the barrage of gunfire came down.
The events at Jackson State 10 days later,
in which two black youths were shot and
killed by highway patrolmen at a women's
dormitory at the Jackson, Miss., cam
pus, only add to the nightmarish memory of
that time. It was as if those entrusted with
maintaining peace had become the in
stigators of the violence it was theirs to pre
vent.
How do we reconcile these events six
years later, events that for most students
here have only a vague historical signifi
cance, but for whom the Crosby, Stills,
Nash and Young lyric, "Four dead in
Ohio," penetrates directly to our consci
ences? In part, of course, we can attribute
the madness to the political climate of a
war-sickened nation ruled by a hopelessly
fearful and therefore misunderstanding
Nixon majority.
But there is more to the tragedy of Kent
State and Jackson State. At the time,
thoughtful persons considered it part of a
malaise that had come to roost in the United
States.
Abstract entities
My own conclusion is that the malaise
grew out of a runaway willingness to
characterize oneself and others in terms of
abstract entities so that virtually no conduct
could be condemned as long as it was con
sistent with a given mind-set. For example,
the National Guard adjutant general who
commanded the firing squad at Kent State
explained his action this way: "We were all
agents of the State of Ohio. We did not act as
individuals."
Likewise, the Mississippi highway pat
rolmen could literally spray the sides of a
dormitory with bullets only by blocking out
the blood and flesh insideand instead view
ing the building as a warehouse of non
human inventory marked for destruction.
This identification of the malaise of 1970

with the process of dehumanizing our vic
tims suggests that we have not been
miraculously cured of whatever it was that
ailed us by the passage of six years. Ob
literating the humanity of one's neighbor is
not an evanescent phenomenon. Visions of
the "state" in the mind of a Guard adjutant
do not differ very much from visions of the
"state" in the mind of a terrorist in Belfast.
No difference
Nor does it differ very much from the vis
ion shared by those who persecuted Wiesel
and the generation of victims for whom he
serves as a messenger. There is that dark
ness in all mankind, which, given the
proper nourishment, can arrive full-bodied
in each of us.
Thus, the participation of Wiesel this af
ternoon in a program dedicated to the mem
ory of slain college students should signal
the qualitative connection between the vio
lence of mass extermination and the killing
of those six innocent men and women. We
are neither collectively past those dreadful
days of 1970, nor individually beyond the
conduct of the killers. We are rather
squarely up against our own capacity to
create abstractions and to do violence by
acting upon them. By recollecting the grisly
and sad consequences of such mental
games, one can, we must hope, arrest their
development.

could lead ordinary, and ordinarily decent
human beings to engage in a butchery of
students six years ago this week.
What happened in May 1970? The events
at Kent, Ohio, on the morning of May 4
resembled those transpiring at several col
lege campuses. Frustrated by President Ni
xon s decision to send American soldiers
into Cambodia at a time when most thought
that the war was winding down, war protes
ters had moved to organizea campus rally at
Kent State University to prepare a public
response.
The rally had been scheduled for noon on
the Kent State green. The Ohio National
Guard, exhausted from overtime duty at a
wildcat labor strike in Akron, had been
summoned to the campus, against the
wishes of the college president, by then-
Gov. James Rhodes.
Four killed
The fn;:- students Killed by the burst of
guardsman gunfire were neither organizers
noractive participants in the rally. Each had
stepped out onto the green merely to ob
serve, as one might anonymously join the
fringe of a crowd assembled at White Plaza.
Although some rocks had been hurled at the

guardsmen, they made no attempt to dis
criminate among members of the crowd
when they opened fire. One of the dead stu
dents, a ROTC cadet at Kent State, was
positioned 100 feet behind the guard when
the barrage of gunfire came down.
The events at Jackson State 10 days later,
in which two black youths were shot and
killed by highway patrolmen at a women's
dormitory at the Jackson, Miss., cam
pus, only add to the nightmarish memory of
that time. It was as if those entrusted with
maintaining peace had become the in
stigators of the violence it was theirs to pre
vent.
How do we reconcile these events six
years later, events that for most students
here have only a vague historical signifi
cance, but for whom the Crosby, Stills,
Nash and Young lyric, "Four dead in
Ohio," penetrates directly to our consci
ences? In part, of course, we can attribute
the madness to the political climate of a
war-sickened nation ruled by a hopelessly
fearful and therefore misunderstanding
Nixon majority.
But there is more to the tragedy of Kent
State and Jackson State. At the time,
thoughtful persons considered it part of a
malaise that had come to roost in the United
States.
Abstract entities
My own conclusion is that the malaise
grew out of a runaway willingness to
characterize oneself and others in terms of
abstract entities so that virtually no conduct
could be condemned as long as it was con
sistent with a given mind-set. For example,
the National Guard adjutant general who
commanded the firing squad at Kent State
explained his action this way: "We were all
agents of the State of Ohio. We did not act as
individuals."
Likewise, the Mississippi highway pat
rolmen could literally spray the sides of a
dormitory with bullets only by blocking out
the blood and flesh insideand instead view
ing the building as a warehouse of non
human inventory marked for destruction.
This identification of the malaise of 1970

with the process of dehumanizing our vic
tims suggests that we have not been
miraculously cured of whatever it was that
ailed us by the passage of six years. Ob
literating the humanity of one's neighbor is
not an evanescent phenomenon. Visions of
the "state" in the mind of a Guard adjutant
do not differ very much from visions of the
"state" in the mind of a terrorist in Belfast.
No difference
Nor does it differ very much from the vis
ion shared by those who persecuted Wiesel
and the generation of victims for whom he
serves as a messenger. There is that dark
ness in all mankind, which, given the
proper nourishment, can arrive full-bodied
in each of us.
Thus, the participation of Wiesel this af
ternoon in a program dedicated to the mem
ory of slain college students should signal
the qualitative connection between the vio
lence of mass extermination and the killing
of those six innocent men and women. We
are neither collectively past those dreadful
days of 1970, nor individually beyond the
conduct of the killers. We are rather
squarely up against our own capacity to
create abstractions and to do violence by
acting upon them. By recollecting the grisly
and sad consequences of such mental
games, one can, we must hope, arrest their
development.

This afternoon in the law school's Kresge
Auditorium, Elie VViesel, a most gifted and
sensitive writer on the predicament of 20th
century morality, will deliver the Fourth
Annual Kent State-Jackson State Memorial
Lecture.
It is fitting that Wiesel should speak here
today. A teen-age survivor of the Nazi death
camps in Auschwitz and Buchenwald,
Wiesel has an intimacy with darkness, a
darkness that moves men and women to
commit atrocity in the name of an ideal
known as the "state" or "order."
Just as it was the darkness of mankind that
could convince enough people actively to
participate in the destruction of European
Jewry and the millions of others who con
tradicted the fascist version of "order," so it
was an acquiescence to the tug of evil incli

guardsman gunfire were neither organizers
noractive participants in the rally. Each had
stepped out onto the green merely to ob
serve, as one might anonymously join the
fringe of a crowd assembled at White Plaza.
Although some rocks had been hurled at the

guardsmen, they made no attempt to dis
criminate among members of the crowd
when they opened fire. One of the dead stu
dents, a ROTC cadet at Kent State, was
positioned 100 feet behind the guard when
the barrage of gunfire came down.
The events at Jackson State 10 days later,
in which two black youths were shot and
killed by highway patrolmen at a women's
dormitory at the Jackson, Miss., cam
pus, only add to the nightmarish memory of
that time. It was as if those entrusted with
maintaining peace had become the in
stigators of the violence it was theirs to pre
vent.
How do we reconcile these events six
years later, events that for most students
here have only a vague historical signifi
cance, but for whom the Crosby, Stills,
Nash and Young lyric, "Four dead in
Ohio," penetrates directly to our consci
ences? In part, of course, we can attribute
the madness to the political climate of a
war-sickened nation ruled by a hopelessly
fearful and therefore misunderstanding
Nixon majority.
But there is more to the tragedy of Kent
State and Jackson State. At the time,
thoughtful persons considered it part of a
malaise that had come to roost in the United
States.
Abstract entities
My own conclusion is that the malaise
grew out of a runaway willingness to
characterize oneself and others in terms of
abstract entities so that virtually no conduct
could be condemned as long as it was con
sistent with a given mind-set. For example,
the National Guard adjutant general who
commanded the firing squad at Kent State
explained his action this way: "We were all
agents of the State of Ohio. We did not act as
individuals."
Likewise, the Mississippi highway pat
rolmen could literally spray the sides of a
dormitory with bullets only by blocking out
the blood and flesh insideand instead view
ing the building as a warehouse of non
human inventory marked for destruction.
This identification of the malaise of 1970

with the process of dehumanizing our vic
tims suggests that we have not been
miraculously cured of whatever it was that
ailed us by the passage of six years. Ob
literating the humanity of one's neighbor is
not an evanescent phenomenon. Visions of
the "state" in the mind of a Guard adjutant
do not differ very much from visions of the
"state" in the mind of a terrorist in Belfast.
No difference
Nor does it differ very much from the vis
ion shared by those who persecuted Wiesel
and the generation of victims for whom he
serves as a messenger. There is that dark
ness in all mankind, which, given the
proper nourishment, can arrive full-bodied
in each of us.
Thus, the participation of Wiesel this af
ternoon in a program dedicated to the mem
ory of slain college students should signal
the qualitative connection between the vio
lence of mass extermination and the killing
of those six innocent men and women. We
are neither collectively past those dreadful
days of 1970, nor individually beyond the
conduct of the killers. We are rather
squarely up against our own capacity to
create abstractions and to do violence by
acting upon them. By recollecting the grisly
and sad consequences of such mental
games, one can, we must hope, arrest their
development.

This afternoon in the law school's Kresge
Auditorium, Elie VViesel, a most gifted and
sensitive writer on the predicament of 20th
century morality, will deliver the Fourth
Annual Kent State-Jackson State Memorial
Lecture.
It is fitting that Wiesel should speak here
today. A teen-age survivor of the Nazi death
camps in Auschwitz and Buchenwald,
Wiesel has an intimacy with darkness, a
darkness that moves men and women to
commit atrocity in the name of an ideal
known as the "state" or "order."
Just as it was the darkness of mankind that
could convince enough people actively to
participate in the destruction of European
Jewry and the millions of others who con
tradicted the fascist version of "order," so it
was an acquiescence to the tug of evil incli
nation that, albeit on a reduced proportion,
could lead ordinary, and ordinarily decent
human beings to engage in a butchery of
students six years ago this week.
What happened in May 1970? The events
at Kent, Ohio, on the morning of May 4
resembled those transpiring at several col
lege campuses. Frustrated by President Ni
xon s decision to send American soldiers
into Cambodia at a time when most thought
that the war was winding down, war protes
ters had moved to organizea campus rally at
Kent State University to prepare a public
response.
The rally had been scheduled for noon on
the Kent State green. The Ohio National
Guard, exhausted from overtime duty at a
wildcat labor strike in Akron, had been
summoned to the campus, against the
wishes of the college president, by then-
Gov. James Rhodes.
