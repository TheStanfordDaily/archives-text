# No COP pendulum

As I graduated from the Uni
versity last year and did not re
turn until this past week, I was
very much surprised to find
mention of the "Mike Herman"
slate for the Council of Presi
dents (COP) on the front page of
the Daily April 23. Having been
a member of that slate. 1 was flat
tered somewhat that mention
was being made of us now two
years later, but also somewhat
troubled by the connection in
which it was being made.
I refer to the "news analysis"
in that issue which observed
rather simplistically a "penduj
lum effect" in the COP's poll
tics between so-called "student
advocate slates" and "student
services slates."
Inability
The inability of the Daily to
distinguish one group of candi
dates from another over the year%
in matched only by the Univer
sity administration's equal ina
bility to do so.
The ambience of sage-like
cynicism which the Daily at
tempts to effect is ridiculous to
anyone who has been involved
in ASSU politics and a dissert
vice to anyone who has not.
It is true, that our slate
(Herman-Carter-Mackey-Mayer)
ran on a platform predominately
stressing the strengthening and
revitaliation of those services
which affect students here and
upon which as COP members vMjl
had the greatest effect.
Our philosophy was not
drawn from that of the "Pete Van
Petten slate" which the article
implied were our precursors as
advocates of student services. As
a matter of clear record, severa/
of the projects that we were ablt*
to accomplish were suggestions
made but not accomplished by
the "Kevin O'Grady slate," Van
Petten's "student advocate" op
ponents.
Public image
As to the campaign last year
between the "Lee Rosenbaum
slate" and the "Kevin McDer
mott slate," if that was a conflict
between advocates of student
services and those of student ad
vocacy, then the terms them
selves should be redefined.
What that campaign really
boiled down to was McDermott's
public image versus Rosep
baum's public image, and issufts
took second billing.
Finally, in regard to the just
concluded campaign between
Vic Petroff and Dan Howard, as
far as I can make out from talking
to various friends not-yet
graduated from the University,
no great distinction ever pre
sented itself to the students.
I would imagine that the
drawbacks to both student ser
vices and student advocacy have
been observed by Petroff and
Howard and "down-played" by
both as the Daily reporter for
once accurately points out. Only
the Daily in its ill-fated en
dorsement editorial managed to
determine a distinction, one
which was apparently lacking of
supporting evidence.

graduated from the University,
no great distinction ever pre
sented itself to the students.
I would imagine that the
drawbacks to both student ser
vices and student advocacy have
been observed by Petroff and
Howard and "down-played" by
both as the Daily reporter for
once accurately points out. Only
the Daily in its ill-fated en
dorsement editorial managed to
determine a distinction, one
which was apparently lacking of
supporting evidence.

As I graduated from the Uni
versity last year and did not re
turn until this past week, I was
very much surprised to find
mention of the "Mike Herman"
slate for the Council of Presi
dents (COP) on the front page of
the Daily April 23. Having been
a member of that slate. 1 was flat
tered somewhat that mention
was being made of us now two
years later, but also somewhat
troubled by the connection in
which it was being made.
I refer to the "news analysis"
in that issue which observed
rather simplistically a "penduj
lum effect" in the COP's poll
tics between so-called "student
advocate slates" and "student
services slates."
Inability
The inability of the Daily to
distinguish one group of candi
dates from another over the year%
in matched only by the Univer
sity administration's equal ina
bility to do so.
The ambience of sage-like
cynicism which the Daily at
tempts to effect is ridiculous to
anyone who has been involved
in ASSU politics and a dissert
vice to anyone who has not.
It is true, that our slate
(Herman-Carter-Mackey-Mayer)
ran on a platform predominately
stressing the strengthening and
revitaliation of those services
which affect students here and
upon which as COP members vMjl
had the greatest effect.
Our philosophy was not
drawn from that of the "Pete Van
Petten slate" which the article
implied were our precursors as
advocates of student services. As
a matter of clear record, severa/
of the projects that we were ablt*
to accomplish were suggestions
made but not accomplished by
the "Kevin O'Grady slate," Van
Petten's "student advocate" op
ponents.
Public image
As to the campaign last year
between the "Lee Rosenbaum
slate" and the "Kevin McDer
mott slate," if that was a conflict
between advocates of student
services and those of student ad
vocacy, then the terms them
selves should be redefined.
What that campaign really
boiled down to was McDermott's
public image versus Rosep
baum's public image, and issufts
took second billing.
Finally, in regard to the just
concluded campaign between
Vic Petroff and Dan Howard, as
far as I can make out from talking
to various friends not-yet
graduated from the University,
no great distinction ever pre
sented itself to the students.
I would imagine that the
drawbacks to both student ser
vices and student advocacy have
been observed by Petroff and
Howard and "down-played" by
