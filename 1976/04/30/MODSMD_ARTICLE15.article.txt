# Brown's labor law on rocks
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (PNS)—As California
(iov. Jerry Brown's star continues to rise
over the presidential landscape, the
brightest achievement of his year-old ad
ministration — passage of California's first
farm labor law — is on the rocks.
Since the farm union election process
broko down in February due to a lack of
operating funds and opposition from
Teamsters and growers, Brown's best efforts
at conciliation and diplomacy have proved
fruitless.
As a consequence California voters will
evidently be called upon next November to
decide, through the initiative process,
whether or not to revive the law guaran
tying secret ballot union elections in the
fields.
Cesar Chavez's United Farm Workers
(UFW) union announced this week that it
has gathered nearly 500,000 petition signa
tures to place the initiative on the November
ballot. Since only 312,000 valid signatures
are required the campaign would appear to
be won.
Petition campaign
A UFW spokesperson said the petition
campaign, which kicked off April 1, will
attempt to gather a record-breaking 700,000
signatures before the April 30 deadline.
The initiative drive is an effort to bypass
the stalled Agricultural Labor Relations Act
(ALRA) of 1975 — the once-lauded legisla
tion designed to end the bloody strife that

has characterized California farm labor for
40 years.
The act established a five-member board
with a staff of 175 to oversee secret ballot
elections between the battling Teamsters
and the UFW.
But after just five months of intense and
contested elections, of which the UFW won
a majority, the funds appropriated for the
board ran dry in February.
Brown had been optimistic in budgeting
for the new board, and perhaps somewhat
euphoric about campaign promises to hold
the line on spending. To give him credit, no
one anticipated the workload the board
would have to face.
Projections based on the National Labor
Relations Board's (NLRB) first full year were
exceeded by 1000 pecent. In its five months
of operaton the board processed over 10
times as many elections and election dis
putes as the NLRB handled in its entire first
year.
Teamsters and growers, charging the
board was biased toward the UFW, seized
the opportunity to block supplemental ap
propriations in the legislature by patching
together a coalition of conservative Repub
licans and rural Democrats.
Despite heavy lobbying by Brown and
pro-UFW legislators to approve additional
funds and get the elections rolling again,
the Teamster- and grower-backed opposi
tion has held firm since February, demand

ing significant changes in the law that the
governor and the UFW call unacceptable.
These changes include a reversal of the
board ruling that permits organizers access
to workers in the field during non-work
periods. They have also demanded elimina
tion of a provision that makes growers liable
for back wages when they fail to negotiate in
good faith and extension of the one-week
deadline for holding elections after peti
tions have been accepted.
When it appeared three weeks ago that
the legislative deadlock could not be bro
ken, Chavez and his supporters kicked off
the present initiative campaign to bypass
the legislature and go directy to the state's
voters.
The initiative, if passed, will reaffirm the
provisions of the original law, mandate
adequate financing and prohibit legislative
amendments.
No elections
Without the needed appropriations no
elections are being scheduled for the
thousands of workers who had planned
votes during the current growing season.
UFW spokesman Mark Grossman says it's
an "open question" whether such a situa
tion will lead to a renewal of violence be
tween members of the UFW and Teamsters.
"Last summer we had the law," he said.
"We were able to tell our people to hold
tight, the law would protect them. This
summer we may have nothing."
