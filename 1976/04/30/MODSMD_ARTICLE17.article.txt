We have heard that somehow in history the hand signals used In
the spectators at Hainan gladiatorial lights to indicate whether the
loser's life should be spared have hern mixed up. Is it (rue that
thumbs-up originally meant death? If so. how did this historical
mix-up occur'.'' -D.F.W.E.
The experts disagree on this one. According to the Oxford Com
panion to Classical Literature, you're right. When spectators voted
to kill the gladiator they pointed with upward thumbs at their
hearts. It the vote was to let him live, thumbs were turned down
ward.
However, Michael Grant, a classics professor at UC Santa Mar
bara, and a visiting professor here last year, takes a different posi
tion. In bis recent book The Gladiators. Grant discusses the ques
tion in about 40 pages and concludes that the traditional interprets
tion was the way it was done then. However, he admits that evi
dence is contradictory, and that historical accounts are too hazy to
confirm either side. He also said that it is possible th.it both ways
were used.
Classics l'rof. John Nicols. who contacted Grant, feels that this
contusion is tor the best. "One of the nice things about history is
that you sometimes don't know the answer in the end,"Nicols said.
Take that, vou science and math freaks.
