## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — There
are more women than men in
America, and the women live
longer. Hut females have a long
way to go before pulling even
with males in jobs anil educa
tion.
Such are the 112 indings in one of
the most comprehensive reports
ever compiled on the status of
American women.
The report, the first of its kind
by the Census Bureau, shows
demographic. social and
economic trends among women.
It shows women comprise
51.3 percent of the population of
2 13,137,000. There are 5.0 mill
ion more women than men. By
1973. women could expect to
live .in average of nearly eight
years longer than men,compared
with 3.5 years longer in 1930.
The figures show the number
of women in the labor force

nearly doubled between 1950
and 1974 to 35.9 million, while
the number of men increased by
only one-fourth to 57.3 million.
But the income differences bet
ween men and women remain
substantial — the median earn
ings for women were $0,772 in
1974. compared with $11.630 for
men.
The report shows that among
people ages 23 to 29. approxi
mately 77 women had com
pleted at least four years of col
lege for every 100 men in 1975.
compared with 00 women tor
every 100 men in 1950.
"Of course, the women's
movement has had an impact."
said Paula ). Schneider, who
headed a group of census staffers
to plan and coordinate the re
port. "But it's hard to say if the
movement was a cause or an ef
fect. The movement was helped
because lots of women had to
work, and it encouraged women
by publicizing the fact that the
working woman was not alone."
Schneider, who works in
the bureau's population divi
sion. said that she hopes the

women's movement will work to
improve salaries for women and
clay care.
Other findings in the report
show:
—A growing proportion ot
women are single or divorced
and not remarried. In 1975. al
most 40 pecent ol women ages
20 to 24 were single, compared
with 28 percent in 1950.
—The number ol female
headed families has increased In
73 percent since 19(i0t07.2 mill
ion. They now comprise 13 per
cent of .ill families.
—Women have gone from a
near-record high fertility rate in
the late 1950s to an all-time low
in recent years. Women under 30
are increasingly favoring the
two-child family.
By 1974, there were 03 women
for every 100 men in the labor
force, compared with 41 women
for every 100 men in 1950, the
