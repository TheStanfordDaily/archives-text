# With 'reasonable work load'
## Davis presents unorthodox views 
### Kathryn Ma 
It is not unusual to find courses on
the contemporary woman in college
catalogues today. Many schools have
become aware of the need to examine,
the issues presented by a growing
feminist movement.
Hut Stanford students have the un
ique opportunity to view feminism
from an unconventional standpoint
this quarter: that of ASSU Cuest Prof.
Angela Davis.
Although her perspective may be
unorthodox, Davis conducts her
course, "The Female Condition:
Search for a Marxist Approach," in the
onventional manner.
The undergraduate special meets
twice a week for two hours. Students
in the class are required to write two
papers during the quarter.
There is also a list of required read
ing which includes both historical
works, such as the writings of Marx
and Engels, and contemporary titles
on such topics as Cuban and Soviet
women.
Reasonable work load
While one student commented that
the work load is quite reasonable,"
another complained that "the reading
.is all historical stuff. I want to look
more at the current situations."
Davis breaks her class time into two
sessions: the first hour for her lecture
and the second for class discussion.
In her class yesterday, Davis spoke

on the historical development of the
suffrage movement in the United
States and on an issue of popular in
terest, the Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA).
After describing the historical con
text in which the ERA was first prop
osed, Davis offered her own view of the
controversial amendment.
"As most of you know," she said,
"the party which I belong to — the
Communist party — has taken an op
posing stand to the ERA." Although
she had initially advocated ratification
of what she thought was she thought
was "progressive" legislation, Davis
said she has come to see that "the ERA
may very well be far more detrimental
than 1 had previously believed."
Aids property owners
"The point is," she explained, "that
it (the ERA) will more than likely aid
property owners and middle class
women." She added, however, that
working women will not be helped
and may in fact be hurt by passage of
the ERA if such measures as protective
labor laws are abolished.
Women should not be "equalized
down" by abolishing those measures
which protect a working woman.
Davis suggested, rather, labor laws
should be extended to apply to men
and women.
"In general," she commented, "un
iformity of rules, of work and of
employment under existing social

conditions may preserve or even foster
inequality between the sexes."
Position challenged
Her position was quickly challenged
in the discussion session immediately
following the lecture. Students spent
the next hour examining the status of
the ERA in California and evaluating
the merits of retaining protective labor
laws.
Davis declined to conduct the dis
cussion herself on the grounds that she
had already presented "a partial view
point." Such awareness of her political
biases and of her responsibility as a
teacher to encourage comments and
questions is appreciated by her stu
dents.
"She doesn't want to be the 'answer
lady,' " claimed one undergraduate.
"She wants students to talk between
themselves and so encourages just
that."
Not everyone is wholly satisfied
with Davis' course. The class is "going
okay," said one student, "but not as
well as I had hoped. The interest in the
class is declining; there's fewer people
here than at the begi nni ng of the quar
ter."
But Davis' approach attracted a
crowd of about 50 women and 10 men
yesterday, and at least one non
student. Liz Walsh, who claimed, "I
am impressed not only by her lectures,
but also by the way that she is handling
her question and answer sessions."
