Wakefield. Douhleday Co.,

Dan Wakefield's new book be
gins,"! was a closet soap opera
addict." And so it had to be.
Youthful prejudices and self
conceptions are hard to change.
As Wakefield explains:
"When I went to college at
Columbia in the early '50s no
student would have been caught
dead owning his own television
set. Wo were intellectuals, you
see, and at that all self
respecting intellectuals feared
that television would try the
minds of the masses. . .
Popular on campus
Hut now. more than 20 years
later, with television a fact of life
rather than an unknown com
modity in student unions and
dormitories all over the country,
hundreds of students gather
daily at noon before color sets
watching intently, silently. A
"civilian" inadvertently intrud
ing could easily ask "Is it a news
conference?" The whispered
answer: "No, it's All Mv Cliil

dren."
With warmth, humor, percep
tion and respect, Wakefield
takes us through tin? early days
of his love affair with All My
Children, how he became
hooked on Fine Valley and its
residents and eventually disco
vered his addiction was legion.
This book about All My Chil
dren is also a book about its
creator, Agnes Nixon. She has
been the guiding hand behind
much of the innovation and de
velopment of recent daytime
drama.
When one realizes that Nixon
created not only Tara and Philip
of All My Children but also Joe
and Viki of One Life To Live and
Alice and Steven and Rachel ol
Another World, one sees the
trend away from the situation
controlling the story toward the
current emphasis on interper
sonal relationships, reality and
development of characters.
Highest rated
It is this reality, this believa
bilitv that has made All My Chil
dren the highest rated soap
opera today. And ironically, this

figure does not reflect the
thousands of sets tuned to All
My Children on campus all over
the country and the dozens or
even hundreds of viewers who
are watching each of them.
When Hob Creene of the
Chicago Sun-Times observed
this phenomenon on the campus
of Northern Illinois University
he was quickly advised that stu
dents are not just watching soap
opera.
Said one senior, "Not just any
soap opera. This is All My Chil
dren. There has never been any
thing like it around here. Stu
dents plan their class schedules
around it. Right at this moment
All My Children is on television
sets in every fraternity, sorority
and dormitory on campus. It's
what students want to see. I
guarantee that two out of every
three students on this campus —
men and women both — can tell
you the plot uf All My Children
much more than could tell you
the record of our football team."
Social concern
Why? It's well known that All
My Children as well as One Life

To Live, both Nixon creations,
reflect her concern with current
social issues. Could it be the so
cial relevance?
Not so, according to
Wakefield's interview with
Ceorge Forgie, a faculty
member at University of Texas
(8.A., Amherst; Ph.D., Stanford
University).
Forgie explains, "I know All
My Children is cited as oneof the
more relevant soaps, dealing
with issues like drugs and child
abuse and so on. but frankly we
didn't feel the 'relevance' was
that big a deal, at least in why we
liked it so much. We were more
interested in when and how Phil
was going to find out lie was the
natural father of Tara's child."
Anil confirming the universal
appeal of theshow,Forgie noted.
"1 guess the best indication of
how widespread a phenomenon
it is among students was a squib
in the student paper the other
day, the Daily Texan, some
thing about what would happen
if Phil and Erica attended some
student event coming up. The
squib didn't even mention All
My Children, the paper just as
sumed that everyone knows who
Phil and Rrica are."
Behind camera
Wakefield takes up behind the
cameras at All My Children
where we are once again assured
that it is anything but as easy as it
looks to create a reflection of re
ality five days a week,
Wakefield's interviews with the
cast regulars are serious and di
rect, elaborating on their feel
ings about the characters they
play and the work they've cho
sen.
Dan Wakefield touches all
bases with All Her Children. I It;
delves into the soap opera
phenomenon in general and dis
cusses the reasons why people
watch. He includes the critics as
well as the supporters and has
managed to define the audience
in a more positive way than any
recent study of soap opera has.
Birth of a soap
We learn how a soap opera is
born, the creative efforts and the
big business logistics which
begin far in advance of the first
taped episode.
And yet, some prejudices still
die hard. Despite the over
whelming current popularity of

soap operas in general and All
My Children in particular, there
are still those whose lifelong
bias is so arthritic it cannot be
excised. Case in point — Time's
recent cover article on soap
operas. If, indeed, the cover
status recognized the legitimacy
of the soap opera art form, the
scope and depth of the subject
was stripped from the article by
machete.
On being interviewed for the
article Dan Wakefield contri
buted a behind-the-scenes
glimpse of the effort and con
centration necessary to produce
quality daytime drama.
Wakefield related that on days
when the script is emotional and
demanding, actress Kay
Campbell, who plays Kate Mar
tin, sometimes releases that
built-up emotion through tears
as soon as the live-tape perfor
mance is over, signified by the
theme music overtrack. Time
neatly capsulized this informa
tion as follows: "Novelist Dan
Wakefield often bursts into tears
at 12:30 when the plagent music
of All My Children wells up."
Lingering prejudices
It is ironic that articles reflect
ing lingering prejudices born in
another time are most often the
only words published about
soap operas outside the daytime
television publications them
selves.
Therefore, while it would be
misleading to imply that All Her
Children is an unbiased book
(Wakefield certainly wouldn't
have written it out of indiffer
ence) it is an entertaining and
well-written opportunity to see
the other side and learn why 40
million Americans can't all be
wrong.
