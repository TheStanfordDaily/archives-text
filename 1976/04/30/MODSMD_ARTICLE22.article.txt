Momaday is a striking excep

>1 Momaday's poetry. He has
written several of the poems in
Vngle of Geese in approxima
tions of native American verse
forms. These freer poems read
like litanies or chants:
I am a feuthei in the bright sky.
I am the blue horse that runs in

the plain.
I din the fish Ihnt tolls, shining,
in tin' wafer.
I am n shadow that follows a
child.
In these poems especially
Momaday joyfully announces
what is the major theme of his
hook, the natural relation bet
ween men and their world.
Momaday\s vision of native
American culture is as an exis
tence in total harmony with Na-
Cultural vision
This i ultural vision is implicit
in most of Momaday's poems. In
"Before an Old hunting of the
Crucifixion" Momaday stands in
the Carmel Mission and medi
tates oil Christ's passion hut he
cannot keep his meditation on
Christ from turning to Nature.
The Christian religion is ulti
mately subsumed into panth
eism.
A life "in good relation to the
earth" is not only external but
internal for Momaday, and the
best poems in the volume move
in both directions. "Compara
tives," "Rainy Mountain Ceinet
arv" and the title poem. "The
Angle ofCeese" all show the im
agination's interaction with the
world. For Momaday a poem
about nature is not simply de

scriptive, it must show the mind
coming to terms with what it de
scribes.
Momaday's poems are very
simple. Most of them talk about
the Southwest where Momaday
grew up. and many concern
themselves directly with native
American lore.
Most books of poetry are too
long. Their authors make no at
tempt to weed out the weak
poems before publication. The
(iodine chapbooks are a wel
come antidote to this trend.

written several of the poems in
Vngle of Geese in approxima

forms. These freer poems read
like litanies or chants:
I am a feuthei in the bright sky.
I am the blue horse that runs in

the plain.
I din the fish Ihnt tolls, shining,
in tin' wafer.
I am n shadow that follows a
child.
In these poems especially
Momaday joyfully announces
what is the major theme of his
hook, the natural relation bet
ween men and their world.
Momaday\s vision of native
American culture is as an exis
tence in total harmony with Na-
Cultural vision
This i ultural vision is implicit
in most of Momaday's poems. In
"Before an Old hunting of the
Crucifixion" Momaday stands in
the Carmel Mission and medi
tates oil Christ's passion hut he
cannot keep his meditation on
Christ from turning to Nature.
The Christian religion is ulti
mately subsumed into panth
eism.
A life "in good relation to the
earth" is not only external but
internal for Momaday, and the
best poems in the volume move
in both directions. "Compara
tives," "Rainy Mountain Ceinet
arv" and the title poem. "The
Angle ofCeese" all show the im
agination's interaction with the
world. For Momaday a poem
about nature is not simply de

scriptive, it must show the mind
coming to terms with what it de
scribes.
Momaday's poems are very
simple. Most of them talk about
the Southwest where Momaday
grew up. and many concern
themselves directly with native
American lore.
Most books of poetry are too
long. Their authors make no at
