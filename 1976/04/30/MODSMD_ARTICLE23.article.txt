## Economic scapegoats: heroes or scoundrels? 
### 
Defending the Undefendable, by Walter Block. Fieri Press. S<) >15.
Reviewed by Bill Evers
Would you classify the following sorts of people as heroes or
villains: loan sharks, jitterbugs, misers, slanderers, libelers, pi nips,
counterfeiters, stripminers, drug pushers, ticket scalpers, prosti
tutes, scabs, blackmailers and slumlords?
If your intuitive inclination is to think of such people as scoun
drels, you'll find Walter Block's new book mind-boggling, block
presents them as heroes and offers good reasons for doing so.
Previous popularly written introductions to political economy
have suggested ending occupational licensure of doctors, legaliz
ing marijuana or legalizing abortions. Hut no previous book in this
genre has thoroughly dealt with the almost universally reviled
practices and occupations discussed in block's book.
Tour de force
Block's book is a startling, witty and eminently reasonable tour
de force. The reader begins each chapter by thinking (as Nobel
Laureate F. A. Hayek did at first, according to his introduction to
the book), "this is going too far." Hut led by block's ingenious
arguments, the reader is compelled (as Hayek was') to agree; with
Block.
Moreover, Block's method has the special attraction of nun
mathematically treating economics as a matter of logic ot choit e.
whileavoiding theall-too-commonpracticeof relying on statists s.
An unexpected bonus in an economics book is the presence of
illustrations for each chapter drawn by Rodrigues. whose cartoon
studies of the demimonde are regular features in Playlwv, Pent
house and the National Lampoon.
Three characteristics
All Block's heroes have three characteristics in common. First,
the practices in which they are engaged do not involve the initia
tion of aggression against others. Second, the demonstrated prefer
ences of peopleand the logic of choice show that Block's heroes are
performing jobs that are of great value to other people. Third, these
heroes are providing their services in the face of constant reproach
from the public and outlawry by the state.
After reading Block's book, we recognize the pimp as an honest
broker and the uncorrupted cop as the Nuremberg defendant who
always followed orders. We art; reminded thai stripmining of coal
allows miners to escape black-lung disease and cave-ins. while
creating what could be described as a stark, desert-like beaut v.
Block gives the reader succinct yet penetrating criticisms of the
Federal Reserve System and the Keynesian paradox of savings. I lis
chapter on charity is the best modern defense of social Darwinism
that I have ever read.
Finest chapter
Perhaps Block's finest chapter is the one on advertising. For
example, Block shows how the use of advertising gimmicks to alert
consumers to products is exactly parallel to a person's attention to
his personal appearance and grooming before a job interview.
Read this book for the intellectual delight (as well as the gain in
knowledge) to be found in observing Block reason his way I hrough
extreme, shocking cases to a counterintuitive, but rigorously de
fended account of the just solutions to them.
