## Jim Plunkett returns to Stanford Discusses Rose Bowls, beer, Indian 
### Chris Baker 
"Say isn't that Jim Plunkett?"
asked the adoring Athletic De
partment secretary as she
watched the well-tanned young
man stroll past her.
His face has been on the cover
of almost every magazine except
Playgirl. The secretary wasn't
mistaken, she had caught a
glimpse of Stanford's first and
only Heisman Trophy winner.
Since being traded from the
New England Patriots to the San
Francisco 49ers earlier this
month, he has been to many
Stanford sporting events. To
morrow at 10:30 a.m. he'll try to
direct the alumni to a win in the
second annual Stanford alumni
football game.
Plunkett just returned from a
tennis ranch in Arizona and has
moved into a new apartment ac
ross the street from the Stanford
Medical Center, a place he vis
ited many times last year during
his injury-plagued season with
the Patriots.
"Sandy and Gene Mayer live
here," said Plunkett, pulling his
sleek blue BMW into the garage.
As he turned off the key the soul
music tape popped out of the

tape player.
Plunkett and the reporter
moved to a terrace overlooking
the tennis courts. The sound of
tennis balls invaded the serenity
of the complex's rustic setting.
Daily: How much of a role did
you play in your trade?
Plunkett: "A pretty big one.
With the Rozelle rule getting
shot down in court they could
have kept me another year, my
option year is next year, and
tried to sign me. So I was in the
fortunate position of being able
to pick and choose. I thought of
L.A. and Denver."
Daily: Are trades part of the
life of a pro football player?
Plunkett: 'i used to think that.
But a lot of it is pretty unfair.
There's got to be some kind of a
different system. It's tough on
anybody."
Daily: I read Dan Jenkins' book
about pro football, Semi Tough.
How true was it?
Plunkett: "I didn't care for it. I
started to read it. I take my pro
fession a little more serious than
that. Did you read North Dallas
Forty ? A lot of it was fairly true."
Daily: Is a lot of the stuff you
hear about pro football lite true?
Plunkett: "Oh sure, I learned
to love beer in training camp be
cause it's so hot and humid.
Training camp is a tough way to
live. I've seen grown men sneak
out. Plus you see guys get cut."
Daily: Is pro football a busi
ness?
Plunkett: "Yes, 1 don't go to
practice. I go to work. I enjoy
what I'm doing and I get a big
thrill out of being out on a foot
ball field. But I earn my living
that way, so it's a job. 1 love it. A
lot of guys who are on those spe
cial teams who don't get a lot of
money have got to love what
they're doing."
Daily: What about drugs in pro
sports?
Plunkett: "I know our team
(Patriots) doesn't (take drugs).
But after what happened in San
Diego they're pretty strict. I got
tired of hearing it but just like
they say 'pro football is a micro
cosm of life . . . .' Just like the ar
ticle which came out which said
that 20 percent of the players in
the NFL being homosexual. Well
that's only the norm of the entire
country. The thing 1 got upset
about was the three NFL quar
terbacks. So its no different than
anyplace else. People smoke
dope and chase girls . . . but
then you see any businessman at
a downtown bar and you see the
same thing."
Daily: Let's talk about Stan

ford. Did you really think you
would beat Ohio State in the
Rose Bowl?
Plunkett: "We were sure
scared . . . apprehensive. But I
think deep down we thought we
could heat them. We didn't want
to play them 1(J times because 1
think they would have won nine
of them. Rut that one time we
were ready."
Daily: It's been said Stanford
just doesn't get up for the small
ones.
Plunkett: "1 can remember my
junior year, which was possibly
our finest offensive team, we
were ahead of UCLA 17-3 and we
wound up tying 20-20 and we
should have won again at the
end when we had a field goal
blocked. But some guy; in those
days a hippie-looking guv, long
hair and a beard, came up to me,
and it sticks out in my mind, and
said it's not you, meaning me
and the rest of the guys.it's Sta
nford.
"He actually believed there
was something about Stanford
that would cause us to lose a
game like that. He was sincere as
hell .... He was loaded, but he
had a lot on his mind."
Daily: You were at Stanford
during the late '60s, one of the
most troubled periods in the
University's history.
Plunkett: "Some were in
volved in the movement. I was
just the time when the athlete
was starting to change. There
were still your hard-core jocks,
but there were many people who
were very concerned with what
was going on.
"One of the reasons I didn't go
to Cal. at that time, was because
Cal had Mario Savio in 1966 and
the start of the protest move
ments and 1 just figured that
wasn't for me. I just wanted to go
to school and play some foot
ball."
Daily: Right after you left the
mascot was changed to Cardi
nals. How doyou feel about that?
Plunkett: "Robber Barons?
Well I think that it's kind of a
joke now. Unfortunately, I've
always like Indians. They did it
because they had a reason to do
it. But there wasn't anything I
was more proud of than that lit
tle guy."
Daily: Did winning the Heis
man put a lot of strain on you?
Plunkett: "At that time I had a
lot of headaches, so I took some
tests and the only thing they
could figure out was tension. So
1 guess it did put a little pressure
on me."
Daily: When you were here

there were some fans who
thought Don Bunce should start.
How do you compare it to the
situation now with the quarter
backs?
Plunkett: "Obviously I
thought I was the guy who
should start and the coaches felt
that way and that's why 1 played.
So at that time we prevented the
situation that Stanford has now.
"Whereas they (Mike Cordova
and Guy Benjamin) trade off
every day. play every other week
or every ot her quarter almost and
once you get in a situation like
that the problems multiply.
"1 always believed in one
quarterback. You've got to find
one and stick with him. Because
first of all it gives him more con
fidence and your whole team.
But to change them back and
forth is a real sticky situation to
get into. I'm glad I don't have
that problem."
Daily: And Cordova has your
old number — 16.
Plunkett: "No it wasn't fair.
Expectations are the biggest
thing you have to cope with
among fans in college as well as
the pros."
Daily: Did you hear about the
Stanford mutiny?
Plunkett: "I didn't hear about
the attorney. Nothing surprises
me anymore. 1 know that there
were a lot of mixed feelings.

"What I really felt was the bad
thing which happened last year
was that they booed Cordova
when he came out.ln the pros it's
fine. But in college the kids art;
still young and to do that to
somone was a real cruel thing.
Not on that level."
Daily : How does it feel to make
your coaching debut in the
alumni game?
Plunkett: "I'm not really doing
any coaching. I'll be there Satur
day for suggestions but Keith
Rowan is doing a lot of the work.
I'm just looking forward to
seeing a lot of my friends that
I haven't seen in a long time."
Daily: When do you want to
retire?
Plunkett: "I thought I'd play a
lot longer a couple of years ago
than I do right now after being
hurt and banged up so much.
I've thought about it a lot over
the years, but 1 haven't come to
any conclusion about what I re
ally want to do in life. It's
tough."
Daily: One more question.
Will you be wearing No. 16 next
year?
Plunkett: "Right now Norru
Snead has the number. That was
one of my first questions. If I
can't get it I'll wear No. 14.1 wore
it in high school, but when I
came to Stanford someone had

Training camp is a tough way to
live. I've seen grown men sneak
out. Plus you see guys get cut."
Daily: Is pro football a busi
ness?
Plunkett: "Yes, 1 don't go to
practice. I go to work. I enjoy
what I'm doing and I get a big
thrill out of being out on a foot
ball field. But I earn my living
that way, so it's a job. 1 love it. A
lot of guys who are on those spe
cial teams who don't get a lot of
money have got to love what
they're doing."
Daily: What about drugs in pro
sports?
Plunkett: "I know our team
(Patriots) doesn't (take drugs).
But after what happened in San
Diego they're pretty strict. I got
tired of hearing it but just like
they say 'pro football is a micro
cosm of life . . . .' Just like the ar
ticle which came out which said
that 20 percent of the players in
the NFL being homosexual. Well
that's only the norm of the entire
country. The thing 1 got upset
about was the three NFL quar
terbacks. So its no different than
anyplace else. People smoke
dope and chase girls . . . but
then you see any businessman at
a downtown bar and you see the
same thing."
Daily: Let's talk about Stan

ford. Did you really think you
would beat Ohio State in the
Rose Bowl?
Plunkett: "We were sure
scared . . . apprehensive. But I
think deep down we thought we
could heat them. We didn't want
to play them 1(J times because 1
think they would have won nine
of them. Rut that one time we
were ready."
Daily: It's been said Stanford
just doesn't get up for the small
ones.
Plunkett: "1 can remember my
junior year, which was possibly
our finest offensive team, we
were ahead of UCLA 17-3 and we
wound up tying 20-20 and we
should have won again at the
end when we had a field goal
blocked. But some guy; in those
days a hippie-looking guv, long
hair and a beard, came up to me,
and it sticks out in my mind, and
said it's not you, meaning me
and the rest of the guys.it's Sta
nford.
"He actually believed there
was something about Stanford
that would cause us to lose a
game like that. He was sincere as
hell .... He was loaded, but he
had a lot on his mind."
Daily: You were at Stanford
during the late '60s, one of the
most troubled periods in the
University's history.
Plunkett: "Some were in
volved in the movement. I was
just the time when the athlete
was starting to change. There
were still your hard-core jocks,
but there were many people who
were very concerned with what
was going on.
"One of the reasons I didn't go
to Cal. at that time, was because
Cal had Mario Savio in 1966 and
the start of the protest move
ments and 1 just figured that
wasn't for me. I just wanted to go
to school and play some foot
ball."
Daily: Right after you left the
mascot was changed to Cardi
nals. How doyou feel about that?
Plunkett: "Robber Barons?
Well I think that it's kind of a
joke now. Unfortunately, I've
always like Indians. They did it
because they had a reason to do
it. But there wasn't anything I
was more proud of than that lit
tle guy."
Daily: Did winning the Heis
man put a lot of strain on you?
Plunkett: "At that time I had a
lot of headaches, so I took some
tests and the only thing they
could figure out was tension. So
1 guess it did put a little pressure
on me."
Daily: When you were here

there were some fans who
thought Don Bunce should start.
How do you compare it to the
situation now with the quarter
backs?
Plunkett: "Obviously I
thought I was the guy who
should start and the coaches felt
that way and that's why 1 played.
So at that time we prevented the
situation that Stanford has now.
"Whereas they (Mike Cordova
and Guy Benjamin) trade off
every day. play every other week
or every ot her quarter almost and
once you get in a situation like
that the problems multiply.
"1 always believed in one
quarterback. You've got to find
one and stick with him. Because
first of all it gives him more con
fidence and your whole team.
But to change them back and
forth is a real sticky situation to
get into. I'm glad I don't have
that problem."
Daily: And Cordova has your
old number — 16.
Plunkett: "No it wasn't fair.
Expectations are the biggest
thing you have to cope with
among fans in college as well as
the pros."
Daily: Did you hear about the
Stanford mutiny?
Plunkett: "I didn't hear about
the attorney. Nothing surprises
me anymore. 1 know that there
were a lot of mixed feelings.

"What I really felt was the bad
thing which happened last year
was that they booed Cordova
when he came out.ln the pros it's
fine. But in college the kids art;
still young and to do that to
somone was a real cruel thing.
Not on that level."
Daily : How does it feel to make
your coaching debut in the
alumni game?
Plunkett: "I'm not really doing
any coaching. I'll be there Satur
day for suggestions but Keith
Rowan is doing a lot of the work.
I'm just looking forward to
seeing a lot of my friends that
I haven't seen in a long time."
Daily: When do you want to
retire?
Plunkett: "I thought I'd play a
lot longer a couple of years ago
than I do right now after being
hurt and banged up so much.
I've thought about it a lot over
the years, but 1 haven't come to
any conclusion about what I re
ally want to do in life. It's
tough."
Daily: One more question.
Will you be wearing No. 16 next
year?
Plunkett: "Right now Norru
Snead has the number. That was
one of my first questions. If I
can't get it I'll wear No. 14.1 wore
it in high school, but when I
came to Stanford someone had

Plunkett passed for 52 touchdowns, won the Heisman trophy in
1970 and led Stanford to a win in the 1971 Rose Bowl.

AND NOW—After being traded to the San Franciso 4Uers, Plun
kett moved into an apartment complex in Palo Alto. Here he sits
outside the complex and talks about football.
"Say isn't that Jim Plunkett?"
asked the adoring Athletic De
partment secretary as she
watched the well-tanned young
man stroll past her.
His face has been on the cover
of almost every magazine except
Playgirl. The secretary wasn't
mistaken, she had caught a
glimpse of Stanford's first and
only Heisman Trophy winner.
Since being traded from the
New England Patriots to the San
Francisco 49ers earlier this
month, he has been to many
Stanford sporting events. To
morrow at 10:30 a.m. he'll try to
direct the alumni to a win in the
second annual Stanford alumni
football game.
Plunkett just returned from a
tennis ranch in Arizona and has
moved into a new apartment ac
ross the street from the Stanford
Medical Center, a place he vis
ited many times last year during
his injury-plagued season with
the Patriots.
"Sandy and Gene Mayer live
here," said Plunkett, pulling his
sleek blue BMW into the garage.
As he turned off the key the soul
music tape popped out of the

tape player.
Plunkett and the reporter
moved to a terrace overlooking
the tennis courts. The sound of
tennis balls invaded the serenity
of the complex's rustic setting.
Daily: How much of a role did
you play in your trade?
Plunkett: "A pretty big one.
With the Rozelle rule getting
shot down in court they could
have kept me another year, my
option year is next year, and
tried to sign me. So I was in the
fortunate position of being able
to pick and choose. I thought of
L.A. and Denver."
Daily: Are trades part of the
life of a pro football player?
Plunkett: 'i used to think that.
But a lot of it is pretty unfair.
There's got to be some kind of a
different system. It's tough on
anybody."
Daily: I read Dan Jenkins' book
about pro football, Semi Tough.
How true was it?
Plunkett: "I didn't care for it. I
started to read it. I take my pro
fession a little more serious than
that. Did you read North Dallas
Forty ? A lot of it was fairly true."
Daily: Is a lot of the stuff you
hear about pro football lite true?

that would cause us to lose a
game like that. He was sincere as
hell .... He was loaded, but he
had a lot on his mind."
Daily: You were at Stanford
during the late '60s, one of the
most troubled periods in the
University's history.
Plunkett: "Some were in
volved in the movement. I was
just the time when the athlete
was starting to change. There
were still your hard-core jocks,
but there were many people who
were very concerned with what
was going on.
"One of the reasons I didn't go
to Cal. at that time, was because
Cal had Mario Savio in 1966 and
the start of the protest move
ments and 1 just figured that
wasn't for me. I just wanted to go
to school and play some foot
ball."
Daily: Right after you left the
mascot was changed to Cardi
nals. How doyou feel about that?
Plunkett: "Robber Barons?
Well I think that it's kind of a
joke now. Unfortunately, I've
always like Indians. They did it
because they had a reason to do
it. But there wasn't anything I
was more proud of than that lit
tle guy."
Daily: Did winning the Heis
man put a lot of strain on you?
Plunkett: "At that time I had a
lot of headaches, so I took some
tests and the only thing they
could figure out was tension. So
1 guess it did put a little pressure
on me."
Daily: When you were here

there were some fans who
thought Don Bunce should start.
How do you compare it to the
situation now with the quarter
backs?
Plunkett: "Obviously I
thought I was the guy who
should start and the coaches felt
that way and that's why 1 played.
So at that time we prevented the
situation that Stanford has now.
"Whereas they (Mike Cordova
and Guy Benjamin) trade off
every day. play every other week
or every ot her quarter almost and
once you get in a situation like
that the problems multiply.
"1 always believed in one
quarterback. You've got to find
one and stick with him. Because
first of all it gives him more con
fidence and your whole team.
But to change them back and
forth is a real sticky situation to
get into. I'm glad I don't have
that problem."
Daily: And Cordova has your
old number — 16.
Plunkett: "No it wasn't fair.
Expectations are the biggest
thing you have to cope with
among fans in college as well as
the pros."
Daily: Did you hear about the
Stanford mutiny?
Plunkett: "I didn't hear about
the attorney. Nothing surprises
me anymore. 1 know that there
were a lot of mixed feelings.

"What I really felt was the bad
thing which happened last year
was that they booed Cordova
when he came out.ln the pros it's
fine. But in college the kids art;
still young and to do that to
somone was a real cruel thing.
Not on that level."
Daily : How does it feel to make
your coaching debut in the
alumni game?
Plunkett: "I'm not really doing
any coaching. I'll be there Satur
day for suggestions but Keith
Rowan is doing a lot of the work.
I'm just looking forward to
seeing a lot of my friends that
I haven't seen in a long time."
Daily: When do you want to
retire?
Plunkett: "I thought I'd play a
lot longer a couple of years ago
than I do right now after being
hurt and banged up so much.
I've thought about it a lot over
the years, but 1 haven't come to
any conclusion about what I re
ally want to do in life. It's
tough."
Daily: One more question.
Will you be wearing No. 16 next
year?
Plunkett: "Right now Norru
Snead has the number. That was
one of my first questions. If I
can't get it I'll wear No. 14.1 wore
it in high school, but when I
came to Stanford someone had

Plunkett passed for 52 touchdowns, won the Heisman trophy in
1970 and led Stanford to a win in the 1971 Rose Bowl.

AND NOW—After being traded to the San Franciso 4Uers, Plun
kett moved into an apartment complex in Palo Alto. Here he sits
outside the complex and talks about football.
"Say isn't that Jim Plunkett?"
asked the adoring Athletic De
partment secretary as she
watched the well-tanned young
man stroll past her.
His face has been on the cover
of almost every magazine except
Playgirl. The secretary wasn't
mistaken, she had caught a
glimpse of Stanford's first and
only Heisman Trophy winner.
Since being traded from the
New England Patriots to the San
Francisco 49ers earlier this
month, he has been to many
Stanford sporting events. To
morrow at 10:30 a.m. he'll try to
direct the alumni to a win in the
second annual Stanford alumni
football game.
Plunkett just returned from a
tennis ranch in Arizona and has
moved into a new apartment ac
ross the street from the Stanford
Medical Center, a place he vis
ited many times last year during
his injury-plagued season with
the Patriots.
"Sandy and Gene Mayer live
here," said Plunkett, pulling his
sleek blue BMW into the garage.
As he turned off the key the soul
music tape popped out of the

tape player.
Plunkett and the reporter
moved to a terrace overlooking
the tennis courts. The sound of
tennis balls invaded the serenity
of the complex's rustic setting.
Daily: How much of a role did
you play in your trade?
Plunkett: "A pretty big one.
With the Rozelle rule getting
shot down in court they could
have kept me another year, my
option year is next year, and
tried to sign me. So I was in the
fortunate position of being able
to pick and choose. I thought of
L.A. and Denver."
Daily: Are trades part of the
life of a pro football player?
Plunkett: 'i used to think that.
But a lot of it is pretty unfair.
There's got to be some kind of a
different system. It's tough on
anybody."
Daily: I read Dan Jenkins' book
about pro football, Semi Tough.
How true was it?
Plunkett: "I didn't care for it. I
started to read it. I take my pro
fession a little more serious than
that. Did you read North Dallas
Forty ? A lot of it was fairly true."
Daily: Is a lot of the stuff you
hear about pro football lite true?
Plunkett: "Oh sure, I learned
to love beer in training camp be
cause it's so hot and humid.
Training camp is a tough way to
live. I've seen grown men sneak
out. Plus you see guys get cut."
Daily: Is pro football a busi
ness?
Plunkett: "Yes, 1 don't go to
practice. I go to work. I enjoy
what I'm doing and I get a big
thrill out of being out on a foot
ball field. But I earn my living
that way, so it's a job. 1 love it. A
lot of guys who are on those spe
cial teams who don't get a lot of
money have got to love what
they're doing."
Daily: What about drugs in pro
sports?
Plunkett: "I know our team
(Patriots) doesn't (take drugs).
But after what happened in San
Diego they're pretty strict. I got
tired of hearing it but just like
they say 'pro football is a micro
cosm of life . . . .' Just like the ar
ticle which came out which said
that 20 percent of the players in
the NFL being homosexual. Well
that's only the norm of the entire
country. The thing 1 got upset
about was the three NFL quar
terbacks. So its no different than
anyplace else. People smoke
dope and chase girls . . . but
then you see any businessman at
a downtown bar and you see the
same thing."
Daily: Let's talk about Stan

ford. Did you really think you
would beat Ohio State in the
Rose Bowl?
Plunkett: "We were sure
scared . . . apprehensive. But I
think deep down we thought we
could heat them. We didn't want
to play them 1(J times because 1
think they would have won nine
of them. Rut that one time we
were ready."
Daily: It's been said Stanford
just doesn't get up for the small
ones.
Plunkett: "1 can remember my
junior year, which was possibly
our finest offensive team, we
were ahead of UCLA 17-3 and we
wound up tying 20-20 and we
should have won again at the
end when we had a field goal
blocked. But some guy; in those
days a hippie-looking guv, long
hair and a beard, came up to me,
and it sticks out in my mind, and
said it's not you, meaning me
and the rest of the guys.it's Sta
nford.

Plunkett: "No it wasn't fair.
Expectations are the biggest
thing you have to cope with
among fans in college as well as
the pros."
Daily: Did you hear about the
Stanford mutiny?
Plunkett: "I didn't hear about
the attorney. Nothing surprises
me anymore. 1 know that there
were a lot of mixed feelings.

"What I really felt was the bad
thing which happened last year
was that they booed Cordova
when he came out.ln the pros it's
fine. But in college the kids art;
still young and to do that to
somone was a real cruel thing.
Not on that level."
Daily : How does it feel to make
your coaching debut in the
alumni game?
Plunkett: "I'm not really doing
any coaching. I'll be there Satur
day for suggestions but Keith
Rowan is doing a lot of the work.
I'm just looking forward to
seeing a lot of my friends that
I haven't seen in a long time."
Daily: When do you want to
retire?
Plunkett: "I thought I'd play a
lot longer a couple of years ago
than I do right now after being
hurt and banged up so much.
I've thought about it a lot over
the years, but 1 haven't come to
any conclusion about what I re
ally want to do in life. It's
tough."
Daily: One more question.
Will you be wearing No. 16 next
year?
Plunkett: "Right now Norru
Snead has the number. That was
one of my first questions. If I
can't get it I'll wear No. 14.1 wore
it in high school, but when I

1970 and led Stanford to a win in the 1971 Rose Bowl.

AND NOW—After being traded to the San Franciso 4Uers, Plun
kett moved into an apartment complex in Palo Alto. Here he sits
outside the complex and talks about football.
"Say isn't that Jim Plunkett?"
asked the adoring Athletic De
partment secretary as she
watched the well-tanned young
man stroll past her.
His face has been on the cover
of almost every magazine except
Playgirl. The secretary wasn't
mistaken, she had caught a
glimpse of Stanford's first and
only Heisman Trophy winner.
Since being traded from the
New England Patriots to the San
Francisco 49ers earlier this
month, he has been to many
Stanford sporting events. To
morrow at 10:30 a.m. he'll try to
direct the alumni to a win in the
second annual Stanford alumni
football game.
Plunkett just returned from a
tennis ranch in Arizona and has
moved into a new apartment ac
ross the street from the Stanford
Medical Center, a place he vis
ited many times last year during
his injury-plagued season with
the Patriots.
"Sandy and Gene Mayer live
here," said Plunkett, pulling his
sleek blue BMW into the garage.
As he turned off the key the soul
music tape popped out of the

tape player.
Plunkett and the reporter
moved to a terrace overlooking
the tennis courts. The sound of
tennis balls invaded the serenity
of the complex's rustic setting.
Daily: How much of a role did
you play in your trade?
Plunkett: "A pretty big one.
With the Rozelle rule getting
shot down in court they could
have kept me another year, my
option year is next year, and
tried to sign me. So I was in the
fortunate position of being able
to pick and choose. I thought of
L.A. and Denver."
Daily: Are trades part of the
life of a pro football player?
Plunkett: 'i used to think that.
But a lot of it is pretty unfair.
There's got to be some kind of a
different system. It's tough on
anybody."
Daily: I read Dan Jenkins' book
about pro football, Semi Tough.
How true was it?
Plunkett: "I didn't care for it. I
started to read it. I take my pro
fession a little more serious than
that. Did you read North Dallas
Forty ? A lot of it was fairly true."
Daily: Is a lot of the stuff you
hear about pro football lite true?
Plunkett: "Oh sure, I learned
to love beer in training camp be
cause it's so hot and humid.
Training camp is a tough way to
live. I've seen grown men sneak
out. Plus you see guys get cut."
Daily: Is pro football a busi
ness?
Plunkett: "Yes, 1 don't go to
practice. I go to work. I enjoy
what I'm doing and I get a big
thrill out of being out on a foot
ball field. But I earn my living
that way, so it's a job. 1 love it. A
lot of guys who are on those spe
cial teams who don't get a lot of
money have got to love what
they're doing."
Daily: What about drugs in pro
sports?
Plunkett: "I know our team
(Patriots) doesn't (take drugs).
But after what happened in San
Diego they're pretty strict. I got
tired of hearing it but just like
they say 'pro football is a micro
cosm of life . . . .' Just like the ar
ticle which came out which said
that 20 percent of the players in
the NFL being homosexual. Well
that's only the norm of the entire
country. The thing 1 got upset
about was the three NFL quar
terbacks. So its no different than
anyplace else. People smoke
dope and chase girls . . . but
then you see any businessman at
a downtown bar and you see the
same thing."
Daily: Let's talk about Stan

ford. Did you really think you
would beat Ohio State in the
Rose Bowl?
Plunkett: "We were sure
scared . . . apprehensive. But I
think deep down we thought we
could heat them. We didn't want
to play them 1(J times because 1
think they would have won nine
of them. Rut that one time we
were ready."
Daily: It's been said Stanford
just doesn't get up for the small
ones.
Plunkett: "1 can remember my
junior year, which was possibly
our finest offensive team, we
were ahead of UCLA 17-3 and we
wound up tying 20-20 and we
should have won again at the
end when we had a field goal
blocked. But some guy; in those
days a hippie-looking guv, long
hair and a beard, came up to me,
and it sticks out in my mind, and
said it's not you, meaning me
and the rest of the guys.it's Sta
nford.
"He actually believed there
was something about Stanford
that would cause us to lose a
game like that. He was sincere as
hell .... He was loaded, but he
had a lot on his mind."
Daily: You were at Stanford
during the late '60s, one of the
most troubled periods in the
University's history.
Plunkett: "Some were in
volved in the movement. I was
just the time when the athlete
was starting to change. There
were still your hard-core jocks,
but there were many people who
were very concerned with what
was going on.
"One of the reasons I didn't go
to Cal. at that time, was because
Cal had Mario Savio in 1966 and
the start of the protest move
ments and 1 just figured that
wasn't for me. I just wanted to go
to school and play some foot
ball."
Daily: Right after you left the
mascot was changed to Cardi
nals. How doyou feel about that?
Plunkett: "Robber Barons?
Well I think that it's kind of a
joke now. Unfortunately, I've
always like Indians. They did it
because they had a reason to do
it. But there wasn't anything I
was more proud of than that lit
tle guy."
Daily: Did winning the Heis
man put a lot of strain on you?
Plunkett: "At that time I had a
lot of headaches, so I took some
tests and the only thing they
could figure out was tension. So
1 guess it did put a little pressure
on me."
Daily: When you were here

there were some fans who
thought Don Bunce should start.
How do you compare it to the
situation now with the quarter
backs?
Plunkett: "Obviously I
thought I was the guy who
should start and the coaches felt
that way and that's why 1 played.
So at that time we prevented the
situation that Stanford has now.
"Whereas they (Mike Cordova
and Guy Benjamin) trade off
every day. play every other week
or every ot her quarter almost and
once you get in a situation like
that the problems multiply.
"1 always believed in one
quarterback. You've got to find
one and stick with him. Because
first of all it gives him more con
fidence and your whole team.
But to change them back and
forth is a real sticky situation to
get into. I'm glad I don't have
that problem."
Daily: And Cordova has your
old number — 16.

Playgirl. The secretary wasn't
mistaken, she had caught a
glimpse of Stanford's first and
only Heisman Trophy winner.
Since being traded from the
New England Patriots to the San
Francisco 49ers earlier this
month, he has been to many
Stanford sporting events. To
morrow at 10:30 a.m. he'll try to
direct the alumni to a win in the
second annual Stanford alumni
football game.
Plunkett just returned from a
tennis ranch in Arizona and has
moved into a new apartment ac
ross the street from the Stanford
Medical Center, a place he vis
ited many times last year during
his injury-plagued season with
the Patriots.
"Sandy and Gene Mayer live
here," said Plunkett, pulling his
sleek blue BMW into the garage.
As he turned off the key the soul
music tape popped out of the

tape player.
Plunkett and the reporter
moved to a terrace overlooking
the tennis courts. The sound of
tennis balls invaded the serenity
of the complex's rustic setting.
Daily: How much of a role did
you play in your trade?
Plunkett: "A pretty big one.
With the Rozelle rule getting
shot down in court they could
have kept me another year, my
option year is next year, and
tried to sign me. So I was in the
fortunate position of being able
to pick and choose. I thought of
L.A. and Denver."
Daily: Are trades part of the
life of a pro football player?
Plunkett: 'i used to think that.
But a lot of it is pretty unfair.
There's got to be some kind of a
different system. It's tough on
anybody."
Daily: I read Dan Jenkins' book
about pro football, Semi Tough.
How true was it?
Plunkett: "I didn't care for it. I
started to read it. I take my pro
fession a little more serious than
that. Did you read North Dallas
Forty ? A lot of it was fairly true."
Daily: Is a lot of the stuff you
hear about pro football lite true?
Plunkett: "Oh sure, I learned
to love beer in training camp be
cause it's so hot and humid.
Training camp is a tough way to
live. I've seen grown men sneak
out. Plus you see guys get cut."
Daily: Is pro football a busi
ness?
Plunkett: "Yes, 1 don't go to
practice. I go to work. I enjoy
what I'm doing and I get a big
thrill out of being out on a foot
ball field. But I earn my living
that way, so it's a job. 1 love it. A
lot of guys who are on those spe
cial teams who don't get a lot of
money have got to love what
they're doing."
Daily: What about drugs in pro
sports?
Plunkett: "I know our team
(Patriots) doesn't (take drugs).
But after what happened in San
Diego they're pretty strict. I got
tired of hearing it but just like
they say 'pro football is a micro
cosm of life . . . .' Just like the ar
ticle which came out which said
that 20 percent of the players in
the NFL being homosexual. Well
that's only the norm of the entire
country. The thing 1 got upset
about was the three NFL quar
terbacks. So its no different than
anyplace else. People smoke
dope and chase girls . . . but
then you see any businessman at
a downtown bar and you see the
same thing."
Daily: Let's talk about Stan

ford. Did you really think you
would beat Ohio State in the
Rose Bowl?
Plunkett: "We were sure
scared . . . apprehensive. But I
think deep down we thought we
could heat them. We didn't want
to play them 1(J times because 1
think they would have won nine
of them. Rut that one time we
were ready."
Daily: It's been said Stanford
just doesn't get up for the small
ones.
Plunkett: "1 can remember my
junior year, which was possibly
our finest offensive team, we
were ahead of UCLA 17-3 and we
wound up tying 20-20 and we
should have won again at the
end when we had a field goal
blocked. But some guy; in those
days a hippie-looking guv, long
hair and a beard, came up to me,
and it sticks out in my mind, and
said it's not you, meaning me
and the rest of the guys.it's Sta
nford.
"He actually believed there
was something about Stanford
that would cause us to lose a
game like that. He was sincere as
hell .... He was loaded, but he
had a lot on his mind."
Daily: You were at Stanford
during the late '60s, one of the
most troubled periods in the
University's history.
Plunkett: "Some were in
volved in the movement. I was
just the time when the athlete
was starting to change. There
were still your hard-core jocks,
but there were many people who
were very concerned with what
was going on.
"One of the reasons I didn't go
to Cal. at that time, was because
Cal had Mario Savio in 1966 and
the start of the protest move
ments and 1 just figured that
wasn't for me. I just wanted to go
to school and play some foot
ball."
Daily: Right after you left the
mascot was changed to Cardi
nals. How doyou feel about that?
Plunkett: "Robber Barons?
Well I think that it's kind of a
joke now. Unfortunately, I've
always like Indians. They did it
because they had a reason to do
it. But there wasn't anything I
was more proud of than that lit
tle guy."
Daily: Did winning the Heis
man put a lot of strain on you?
Plunkett: "At that time I had a
lot of headaches, so I took some
tests and the only thing they
could figure out was tension. So
1 guess it did put a little pressure
on me."
Daily: When you were here

there were some fans who
thought Don Bunce should start.
How do you compare it to the
situation now with the quarter
backs?
Plunkett: "Obviously I
thought I was the guy who
should start and the coaches felt
that way and that's why 1 played.
So at that time we prevented the
situation that Stanford has now.
"Whereas they (Mike Cordova
and Guy Benjamin) trade off
every day. play every other week
or every ot her quarter almost and
once you get in a situation like
that the problems multiply.
"1 always believed in one
quarterback. You've got to find
one and stick with him. Because
first of all it gives him more con
fidence and your whole team.
But to change them back and
forth is a real sticky situation to
get into. I'm glad I don't have
that problem."
Daily: And Cordova has your
old number — 16.
Plunkett: "No it wasn't fair.
Expectations are the biggest
thing you have to cope with
among fans in college as well as
the pros."
Daily: Did you hear about the
Stanford mutiny?
Plunkett: "I didn't hear about
the attorney. Nothing surprises
me anymore. 1 know that there
were a lot of mixed feelings.

"What I really felt was the bad
thing which happened last year
was that they booed Cordova
when he came out.ln the pros it's
fine. But in college the kids art;
still young and to do that to
somone was a real cruel thing.
Not on that level."
Daily : How does it feel to make
your coaching debut in the
alumni game?
Plunkett: "I'm not really doing
any coaching. I'll be there Satur
day for suggestions but Keith
Rowan is doing a lot of the work.
I'm just looking forward to
seeing a lot of my friends that
I haven't seen in a long time."
Daily: When do you want to
retire?
Plunkett: "I thought I'd play a
lot longer a couple of years ago
than I do right now after being
hurt and banged up so much.
I've thought about it a lot over
the years, but 1 haven't come to
any conclusion about what I re
ally want to do in life. It's
tough."
Daily: One more question.
Will you be wearing No. 16 next
year?
Plunkett: "Right now Norru
Snead has the number. That was
one of my first questions. If I
can't get it I'll wear No. 14.1 wore
it in high school, but when I
came to Stanford someone had
