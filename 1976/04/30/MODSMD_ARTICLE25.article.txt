Lazetich was in rare form Wed
nesday afternoon. "We're going
to try and resolve the quarter
back situation," Lazetich said at
a Northern California Football
Writers luncheon. "We're going
to hurt both of them."
Laz, and professional football
stars Jim Plunkett, Gene
Washington and George
Buehler, star guard of the Oak
land Raiders, will lead the "Gol
den Boys" —the Stanford
alumni —into tomorrow's sec
ond annual Stanford alumni
football garneat 10:30 a.m. in the
stadium. The contest will mark
the end of four weeks of spring
football practice for the Card
varsity.
Plunkett. the former Heisman
Trophy winner recently traded
to the San Francisco 49ers, will
act as offensive coach of the
alumni.
Point spread
"The point spreat should be
minus 47," joked Plunkett.
Putting on his Knute Rockne
game face, Plunkett said, "We're
going to try to put the ball across
the goal line.
When New York Giants' quar
terback Craig Morton coached
the Cal alumni team a couple
years ago. he entered the alums'
huddle and then stepped back a
few yards. He threw a couple of
completions, but then a Kotshot
sophomore literally ripped the
shirt off Morton's back.
New 49er Head Coach Monte
Clarke has made Plunkett prom

ise that he wouldn't follow Mor
ton's example. Calling the plays
for the alums will he Stanford
medical student Don Bunce,
hero of the Cards' 13-12 1972
Rose Howl win over Michigan.
Stanford coach Jack Christian
sen indicated Mike Cordova will
get the starting nod tomorrow,
hut Chris emphasized he doesn't
plan to choose next year's start
ing quarterback until the Penn
State game Sept. 11.
Same situation
"The quarterback situation is
the same," said Christiansen.
"We've been alternating them
day by day — letting each one
run the first team. I think the
competition has helped them
both.
"It might be Mike's turn to
start." he said. Hut Christiansen
added both Guy Benjamin and
Cordova will get the same
amount of playing time.
Christiansen's biggest priority
this spring has been switching
the Card defense from the "50"
to a four-man front. "I'm happy
with the way our defense has
come along," said Christiansen.
"They've really dominated the
scrimmages this spring."
The Cards have been hurt by
injuries. Defensive end Bruce
Barker was the eighth person
lost to injuries this spring, when
he injured his knee this week. He
has already undergone surgery.
"I don't know if we could have
enough to split up into two
squads, so it's good that we're
having an alumni game," said
Christiansen.

Last year the varsity beat the
alumni 27-0. "The first half
should be really good," said
Chris. The alums will field a
team of many players from Stan
ford's two Rose Bowl squads.
Rose Bowl stars
Joining Bunce will be running
back Jackie Brown, wide re
ceiver Eric Cross, kicker Steve
Horowitz, tackle Bill Meyers,
tight end Bill Scott and several
others.
Defensively, the alums will be
led by three former Rose Bowl
stars, Lazetich, Denver Broncos'
safety Randy Potl and 1970 Stan
ford co-captain Jack Schultz.
Beside Plunkett, several other
professional players will be on
hand in a non-playing role, in
cluding New Orleans Saints'
linebacker Rick Merlo, Chicago
Bears' defensive end Roger
Stillwell, Philadelphia Eagles'
defensive end Gary Pettigrew
and Tampa Bay tight end Bob
Moore, formerly of the Oakland
Raiders.
Cardinal Notes: Tickets are $2

and children . . . Between 9:30
