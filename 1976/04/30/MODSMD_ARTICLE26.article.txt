# Reporter joins grid practice

### David Georgette 
When watching a football game from the4oth
row in Stanford Stadium, the players below
seem to possess no extraordinary speed, size or
quickness. Down on the field, though, things
take on quite a different perspective when you
confront Ron Inge eye-to-shoulder.
So I found out yesterday when 1 practiced
with thefootball team for what some said would
be a suicidal mission.
Asking the equipment manager for a helmet
brought a rebuff along with an inquiry as to
whether there were any more "fucking stupid
ideas" in the works.
Fortunately, a non-contact practice in shorts
and shoulder pads afforded survival to me and
relief to the players.
The practice started witha warm-upand calis
thenic period during which receiver coach Pete
Kettela barked at me for improperly stretching.
"Stretch, don't bounce!" cried P.K.
Quarterback Guy Benjamin advised me to
look busy and just pretend to stretch.
My first chance to throw to the receivers
came in a drill where the receiver strides out
down the sideline and the quarterback lofts the
ball out there to make the receiver reach for it.
Concern over whether 1 would choke on my
big chance began to disappear after I connected
on my first few tosses. Encouraging comments
from the receivers built my confidence, which
was deflated later when my final pass fell woe
fully short of its intended mark and nearly
caused a collision between two receivers.

Later, the offensive skill positions lined up
against the linebackers and deep backs in the
most interesting drill of the day — seven on
seven.
This drill sent all backs and receivers out
while the quarterback sat back and waited for
hisprimary receiver to get open.Without a rush,
the defense was at a disadvantage and was
shredded by passes.
Warnings of "Ball, ball!" and "Got one
deep!" were useless because after almost every
play offensive players congratulated each other
— "Good pass, Guy, good timing!" or "Good
read, Steve!"
The final portion of the practice was on the
running game. The offense plied its way up and
down the field against the relatively minimal
resistance offered by the makeshift defense of
bagholders.
Never-ending encouragements by the coach
ing staff of "0.K., here we go!" and "Pick it up.
line, pick it up!" was answered with plays of
like "Blue left, 21 pitch" going for big yardage.
Everyone knew where to go and what to do.
Well, almost all the time.On one p1 ay John
Finley did not run through the gaping hole
blasted in the line. "I've never run a 1b trap
before." Finley said. "Darn!"
About then. Christiansen boomed. "Last
play!" Quarterback Turk Schonert let out a "Ya
ooh!" and after the whistle blew the ball dead,
the players gathered around the coaches for
tinal instructions before Saturday's came.
