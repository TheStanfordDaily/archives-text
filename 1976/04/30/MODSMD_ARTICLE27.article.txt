# Williamson throws six-hitter
## Card nine tops SF State, 8-1 
### Linda Buddenberg 
He didn't know he'd be the
starting pitcher until 40 minutes
before the Wednesday's baseball
game, but a hot Mike Williamson
came in anyway to stop San
Francisco State cold, leading
Stanford to an 8-1 victory over
the Cators.
Logging the first complete
game Stanford has seen in three
weeks, "Birdman" Williamson
never even let the Gators
threaten. The big right-hander
scattered six hits and struck out
seven batters.
"My motions were a lot
smoother," Williamson said, in
evaluating his performance. "I
was getting evervthi ng over and
not getting behind the batters."
"He pitched a little high, but
did a good job," Card coach Ray
Young said. "If his offspeed
pitches improve, he could do
well against (this weekend's op
ponent), USC."
Sore arms
Williamson, usually a re
liever, said he got to pitch be
cause sore arms had forced other
pitchers out of the rotation.
"Coach Young didn't have any
one else to throw," Williamson
explained.
The Card offense gave Wil
liamson plenty of support. Stan
ford batters made the most of 10
hits and — what's new? —
basepath hustling, to give Wil
liamson a seven-run cushion.
First baseman Tom "Ajax"
Cuardino supplied the power
again, knocking out his 11th
homer of the season in the sixth
inning.
Second baseman Kevin Triggs
picked up two more hits. Playing
for injured Dave Perez, Triggs
has raised his average to .324
with 11 hits in the last five
games.
Game winners
The game winning runs came
in the second inning, starting
with a Randy Wong walk, a
Triggs double, and ending with
RBIs by Mike Codiroli, Rusty
DuQuette and Gary Pitchford.
Shortstop Steve Davis only
had one hit, but when he came

around to score, he broke one
Stanford record and tied
another. Davis scored his 136 th
career run. to break Mark
Lucich's record set from 1971 to
1974. Davis also tied Jack
Shepard's 1953 mark for runs
scored in a season at 52.
Davis, however, said he's been
struggling this season.
"I'm putting myself under a
lot of mental pressure," he said.
"I'm hitting it on the end of the

bat, tilings like that."
Along with the rest of the
team. Davis said he is looking
forward to this weekend's en
counter.
"We're not out of it."he em
phasized. "And you know USC
and Stanford — we always have
it in for each other."
Young's tentative mound
choices for the big series are
Brian Harrison on Friday. Bernie
HPtner on Saturday and "who

ever we haven't used yet" on
Sunday.
Cardinal notes: Left fielder Pepe
Hinojosa broke into the record
book this week with a season
high 49 bases on balls . . . The
Stanford Band will definitely
play at this Friday's game.
