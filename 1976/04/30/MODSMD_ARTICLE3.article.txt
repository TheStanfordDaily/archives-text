# Marc Harris, Inc.: music, money, marine bio
## Wrote master's thesis in marine bio 'for relaxation' 
### Kit Warfield 
Marc Harris, now 23 years old. had two goals in
.riind when he started Stanford's graduate program in
marine biology last June. One was to finish his education.
The other was to backup "Plan A" — finding a job in
marine biology — with something more dependable.
"1 had doubts from the beginning that even a Stanford
degree would guarantee me the kind of marine bio job I
want." Harris explains. "I'm too conscious of being secure
Vo put my stake in Plan A. I had to have Plan H.PlanC, Plan
/) — something concrete."
This month the wiry, dark-haired graduate added an
M.S. to his U.S. in marine biology. "But I'm probably the
only student who wrote his master's thesis in his spare
time — for relaxation!" he says.
Parasite samples
As president of his own corporation, general manager of
\wo Hay Area bands and a recording studio, and a per
former who plays six instruments, Harris had plenty to do
when he was not relaxing with parasite samples last quar
ter.
A year ago Harris became manager of an filast Hay group
c alled Brotherly Love. "They had some of the best profes
sional talent I'd seen," he says, "yet they had no time to
promote their music or the two-year-old recording studio
'hey built."
After talking over promotion of the band. Harris came
up with the idea of "using their talent and their studio to
produce sound tracks for radio and television commer
cials."
The group formed a corporation called Commercial
Concepts and produced six demonstration sound tracks.
Harris helped write and arrange the ads, and sang the
,/rics. Then, "with two briefcases in hand —one with the
tape recorder in it,"he made presentations to 40 advertis

ing agencies in the area.
Contracts for two TV and three radio sound tracks re
sulted, included "Caress Soap" and "Smorgy Boys" ads.
Harris explains, "With my kind of drive and aggression,
I couldn't stand going to school five days a week and
doing nothing else. Keeping up those outside interests
was very important to me."
His professors found out fall quarter just how important
Harris' non-academic pursuits were. There was promo
tion to do for the Brotherly Love's first big concert, set for
New Year's Eve. Because Harris had appointments Tues
day through Friday of finals week to work out concert
details, he arranged to take all four finals that Monday.
"I walked into the first. Viruses, at 7 a.m. and out of Bio
Statistics, the last, at 6:30 that evening. And I did well on
all hut the last one.
Too thin?
"Some people think I spread myself too thin." Harris
comments. "But everyone should be doing something he
loves, and not letting life pass him by. If he'd rather be
tending a tobacco factory than sitting in an office, all it
takes is a few letters or phone calls.
"For instance, I couldn't see myself slaving over a hot
test tube eight hours a day right after graduation. But you
can't wait until you're out of school and then start worry
ing about what you'd like to be doing. You have to plan."
After the concert. Harris started work on his thesis. He
also took a job singing at the Refectory Steak House in
Menlo Park. And, as if that weren't enough, he began
negotiatons for funds to back a second corporation. Marc
Harris. Inc.
"I won't be one of those people who looks back five
years later and says,"I hate my job. I should have done
what I wanted to do rather than what I was forced into."
says Harris. "People should be smart and do it my way."
