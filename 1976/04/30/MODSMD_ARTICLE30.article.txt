# Jordan seeks upset of Cal track team
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
The Stanford track team closes
its dual meet season tomorrow
when it travels to Berkeley to
face California in the 82nd Big
Meet.
Stanford enters the meet with
a 4-2 dual meet record and will
try to preserve its edge in the
series when the meet begins at
1:15 at Edwards Stadium. The
Robber Barons hold a 40-39-2
margin in the series which dates
back to 1893.
Cal has won the last four Big
Meets and is favored to win to
morrow. But Stanford coach
Payton Jordan warned, "The last
time we upset Cal was in 1971.
We did it with a team just like
this one."
And Cal coach Erv Hunt
cautioned, "This is going to be a
pretty good meet. I strongly feel
that Stanford is definitely one of
the top 20 dual meet teams in the
country."
'Magic number'
To upset the Bears, Jordan said
"the magic number is five. We
have to get maximum results in

the first five events (the shot put,
long jump. 400 meter relay, jave
lin and 1500 meters)."
If things go well for the Barons
in the first five events, the sixth
event, the 110 meter high hur
dles, could be pivotal.
The meet record of 14.0, held
by Bear McKinley Mosely, will
be under attack when Cal's Carl
Florant, with a season best of
13.8, and Moseley (13.9) line up
against Stanford's John Foster
(13.9).
Marvin Holmes will head
Stanford's challenge of Cal's
talented sprint duo of Wesley
Walker and Paul Wallace.
Field events
In the field events, Stanford's
steady John Macrorie (219-2)
will match up with the Bears'
John Biska (218-4) in the javelin,
and Baron Bob Flint (16-0) is pit
ted against California's Larry
Hintz (16-10) in the pole vault.
While the Barons' fastest times
this year stack up a little short in
both relays — 40.6 to Cal's 40.4
in the4oo and 3:10.8 to 3:09.9 in
the mile — anything can happen
in a meet noted for emotional
performances.
Jordan says that the Baron
quartet of Scott Wingo, Alan
Sheats, Matt Hogsett and James
Lofton will have to set a school
record in the mile relay to upset
the Bears in that event.
For nine Stanford seniors it
will be their last Big Meet.
Senior Tony Sandoval, who wil I
run the 1500 meters tomorrow
says,"The Big Meet has signifi
cance in itself. It will be the last
dual meet of the season, it's Cal,

of being close."

Hintz (16-10) in the pole vault.
While the Barons' fastest times
this year stack up a little short in
both relays — 40.6 to Cal's 40.4
in the4oo and 3:10.8 to 3:09.9 in
the mile — anything can happen
in a meet noted for emotional
performances.
Jordan says that the Baron
quartet of Scott Wingo, Alan
Sheats, Matt Hogsett and James
Lofton will have to set a school
record in the mile relay to upset
the Bears in that event.
For nine Stanford seniors it
will be their last Big Meet.
Senior Tony Sandoval, who wil I
run the 1500 meters tomorrow
says,"The Big Meet has signifi
cance in itself. It will be the last
dual meet of the season, it's Cal,
and this year it has the promise
of being close."
The Stanford track team closes
its dual meet season tomorrow
when it travels to Berkeley to
face California in the 82nd Big
Meet.
Stanford enters the meet with
a 4-2 dual meet record and will
try to preserve its edge in the
series when the meet begins at
1:15 at Edwards Stadium. The
Robber Barons hold a 40-39-2
margin in the series which dates
back to 1893.
Cal has won the last four Big
Meets and is favored to win to
morrow. But Stanford coach
Payton Jordan warned, "The last
time we upset Cal was in 1971.
We did it with a team just like
this one."
And Cal coach Erv Hunt
cautioned, "This is going to be a
pretty good meet. I strongly feel
that Stanford is definitely one of
the top 20 dual meet teams in the
country."
'Magic number'
To upset the Bears, Jordan said
"the magic number is five. We
have to get maximum results in

the first five events (the shot put,
long jump. 400 meter relay, jave
lin and 1500 meters)."
If things go well for the Barons
in the first five events, the sixth
event, the 110 meter high hur
dles, could be pivotal.
The meet record of 14.0, held
by Bear McKinley Mosely, will
be under attack when Cal's Carl
Florant, with a season best of
13.8, and Moseley (13.9) line up
against Stanford's John Foster
(13.9).
Marvin Holmes will head
Stanford's challenge of Cal's
talented sprint duo of Wesley
Walker and Paul Wallace.
Field events
In the field events, Stanford's
steady John Macrorie (219-2)
will match up with the Bears'
John Biska (218-4) in the javelin,
and Baron Bob Flint (16-0) is pit
ted against California's Larry
Hintz (16-10) in the pole vault.
