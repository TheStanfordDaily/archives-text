# Women netters rout JCs
## 
### Paul Bauman 
Liza Pande of the Stanford
women's tennis team attended a
funeral yesterday morning and
then returned to the Varsity
Courts in the afternoon to watch
another one as her teammates
buried a group of local junior
college all-stars, 9-0.
It should now be clear, if it
wasn't before, that California
small college talent is no match
for the Cards, the top team in the
country. Stanford (8-0) didn't
lose so much as one set yester
day. The most games any oppos
ing player won in a set was three
and that only happened twice.
The closest match of the day
came at sixth singles, in which,
Stanford's Pat Delaney survived
a grueling bout with Kim Web
ber of San Jose City College, 6-2,
6-3.
And the Cards' top two
players, Lele Forood and Barb
Jordan, didn't even play singles.
It was the closest thing to cruel
and unusual punishment you'd
care to see. Pitting JC players
against Stanford is like Upper
Volta declaring war on the
United States.
Injuries at the bottom of the
Card ladder, and Pande's ab
sence, forced coach Anne Hill to
use some players she might
otherwise have rested.
Marianne Ingard has been out
all season with ligament prob
lems in her knee.
Marcy O'Keefe, normally No.
5. played at first singles and beat
Val Mendoza of DeAnza, 6-1,
6-1.
Diane Morrison moved up a

couple of notches from her usual
No. 4 spot to defeat Foothill's
Julie Jacklich, 6-2, 6-1.
Jordan skipped the singles
competition but won a doubles
match along with O'Keefe, 6-1,
6-1.
