# Men netters down San Diego
## 
### Paul Bauman 
Things were back to normal
yesterday for the Stanford men's
tennis team.
The Cards returned to dual
match play after competing in
the Ojai Intercollegiates last
weekend, and Gene Mayer was
out of the lineup.
Stanford (13-3) swept all six
si ngles matches and defeated the
University of San Diego, the de
fending NCAA Division II
champion, 7-2.
Mayer got sick in Ojai. throw
ing up continually, and hasn't
played since. He underwent
some medical tests yesterday
and Gould speculated Mayer
may have a virus.
Mayer has played very little al 1
season due apparently to a nag
ging muscle pull in his back.
"It's too bad," Gould said of
Mayer's latest setback. "It's not
helping him get ready for any
thing."
Stanford started its normal
lineup against San Diego with
the exception of Bill Maze.
Gould rested the big sophomore
yesterday but said Maze will
play today against California
(2:30 p.m., Varsity Courts) while

Pat DuPre takes a break.
Gould and women's coach
Anne Hill also announced Stan
ford's entries in the California
State Championships next week
at Pebble Beach and the Cards'
lineup for their match against
the Golden Gaters of World
Team Tennis next Friday in
Maples Pavilion.
Matt Mitchell, Mark Mitchell.
Maze, Perry Wright. Alex Cortes,
Dave Becker and Steve Valelly of
the men's team will play in the
Cal States, and Susie Hagey, Pet
Varga and Joy Hahn of the wo
men's squad will head south.
Gould said playing in the tour
nament is purely voluntary.
For the Gaters Friday, Stan
ford will go with Maze in men's
singles, Lele Forood in women's
singles, Mark and Matt Mitchell
in men's doubles, Barb Jordan
and Diane Morrison in women's
