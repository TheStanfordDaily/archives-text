Hughes' will filed in Nevada?
LAS VEGAS — A crudely handwritten docu
ment described as the will of the late billionaire
Howard Hughes was filed with a Nevada court
yesterday, but its authenticity remained in
doubt.
The Mormon church, which found the pur
ported will, was listed as a major beneficiary
while a 31-year-old Utah gas station owner was
named to inherit one-sixteenth, or about $125
million, of Hughes' estate.
At least 10 spelling errors in the yellowed
document, plus a reference to the "Spruce
Goose" — a name for his wooden airplane that
Hughes considered derogatory — raised suspi
cions of his former associates.
According to the document, the bulk of the
estate, estimated at up to $2.5 billion, would go
to medical research and charitable organiza
tions. Hughes' two former wives, his aides and
other individuals would receive most of the rest.
The holographic will — so called because it
purports to be written in the decedent's own
hand — contains no signatures of witnesses.
I lowever, a federal judge in Clark County said a
holographic will does not require witnesses,
merely verification from handwriting experts.
FBl's King investigation reviewed
WASHINGTON — The Justice Department
yesterday launched a full review of the FBI in
vestigation of the death of Dr. Martin Luther
King, although Atly. Gen. Fdward Levi said a
preliminary inquiry turned up no evidence that
the probe was less than thorough.
Levi said he will assign a team of department
lawyers to review some 200,000 FBI documents
dealing with the assassination of King and also
the FBI campaign to harass and discredit him as
a civil rights leader.
Assistant Attv. Gen. J. Stanley Pottinger had
recommended the appointment of an outside
commission, including civil rights leaders, to
pursue the investigation.
But Levi rejected the approach because he
"believes this department has a very serious re
sponsibility to insure that any alleged wrongdo
ing is dealt with by the attorney general," Pot
t inner told a news conference.

Levi's decision to keep the investigation
within the department was attacked im
mediately by the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, who
succeeded King as head of the Southern Christ
ian Leadership Conference.
"1 do not have any faith whatsoever in the
investigation as conducted by the FBI in the
tragic assassination," Abernathy said in Atlanta.
New S F strike proposal studied
SAN FRANCISCO — With striking labor lead
ers awaiting their response, the city's Hoard of
Supervisors met behind closed doors yesterday
to study a proposed settlement ot the 30-day
walkout.
"It appears we are on the same track." said a
cautiously optimistic Quentin Kopp. president
of the board. "I'm hopeful for a settlement . . . ."
Kopp said there would be no public comment
on the proposal until the labor leaders consider
the city's response. No details have been dis
closed but it was expected to rescind the salary
cuts which precipitated the walkout.
Meanwhile, helmeted policemen were posted
at Golden Gate Park to guard against further
breaks in a water main that has broken twice,
spewing millions of gallons of water and ham
pering service to a large residential area.
Sabotage was suspected in the water breaks.
Explosion shakes Soviet embassy
MOSCOW — The official news agency Tass
said a strong explosion at the gates of the Soviet
Embassy in Peking yesterday killed two Chinese
guards but caused no Soviet casualties.
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug in Bel
grade reported the explosion, but it said the two
Chinese guards were severely injured, not kil
led.
The Tass account said that the Soviet Embassy
suffered damage and that a protest was lodged
with Chinese authorities "in connection with
the incident."
The Tanjug report said there was no im
mediate indication what caused the explosion.
China and the Soviet Union have been
squabbling for years over ideological issues as
well as disputed border territory.

Swine' flu upsets hog men
NEWARK — Any controversy over the im
munization program for the latest tin type seems
to have quieted with Congress' approval ot $135
million for it. But now there is a new flu flap.
The latest strain is known as the swine flu and
the official name is A-NewJersey-76, but it turns
out nobody wants to claim the name, let alone
the blame.
The name swine flu came about because the
flu resembles a virus found in swine. However,
there is no known probability for humans con
tracting the disease from eating pork.
Hog growers already art; whining about refer
ences to swine flu, which they say is a slam at the
already maligned pig. And officials in New Jer
sey, where the flu was discovered at Ft. Dix,
think the state has enough problems and doesn't
need a flu named for it.
"No matter how you slice the bacon, swine flu
is swine flu," said Scott McGlasson of the New
Jersey Department of Labor and Industry.
Bay Area electronics firm indicted
SAN FRANCISCO — A Bay Area firm has been
charged with illegally exporting $3 million in

sophisticated electronics manufacturing
equipment to the Soviet Union in what may be
the start of a federal crackdown on such transac
tions.
The federal indictment returned Wednesday
against 1.1. Industries Inc. paints a cloak-and
dagger picture of fictitious firms, mysterious
foreign "middlemen" and complex equipment
disguised as washing machines and ovens to
avoid detection by customs authorities.
It alleges that the Sunnyvale firm, three
of its officers and three West German nationals
violated U.S. law forbidding exportation to
communist countries of any goods which
will "significantly increase. . . present or poten
tial military capability."
The indictment charges the defendants con
spired to export the prohibited goods to the
Soviet Union between April 1, 1975. and last
Jan. 17.

Swine' flu upsets hog men
NEWARK — Any controversy over the im
munization program for the latest tin type seems
to have quieted with Congress' approval ot $135
million for it. But now there is a new flu flap.
The latest strain is known as the swine flu and
the official name is A-NewJersey-76, but it turns
out nobody wants to claim the name, let alone
the blame.
The name swine flu came about because the
flu resembles a virus found in swine. However,
there is no known probability for humans con
tracting the disease from eating pork.
Hog growers already art; whining about refer
ences to swine flu, which they say is a slam at the
already maligned pig. And officials in New Jer
sey, where the flu was discovered at Ft. Dix,
think the state has enough problems and doesn't
need a flu named for it.
"No matter how you slice the bacon, swine flu
is swine flu," said Scott McGlasson of the New
Jersey Department of Labor and Industry.
Bay Area electronics firm indicted
SAN FRANCISCO — A Bay Area firm has been
charged with illegally exporting $3 million in

sophisticated electronics manufacturing
equipment to the Soviet Union in what may be
the start of a federal crackdown on such transac
tions.
The federal indictment returned Wednesday
against 1.1. Industries Inc. paints a cloak-and
dagger picture of fictitious firms, mysterious
foreign "middlemen" and complex equipment
disguised as washing machines and ovens to
avoid detection by customs authorities.
It alleges that the Sunnyvale firm, three
of its officers and three West German nationals
violated U.S. law forbidding exportation to
communist countries of any goods which
will "significantly increase. . . present or poten
tial military capability."
The indictment charges the defendants con
spired to export the prohibited goods to the
Soviet Union between April 1, 1975. and last
Jan. 17.

Hughes' will filed in Nevada?
LAS VEGAS — A crudely handwritten docu
ment described as the will of the late billionaire
Howard Hughes was filed with a Nevada court
yesterday, but its authenticity remained in
doubt.
The Mormon church, which found the pur
ported will, was listed as a major beneficiary
while a 31-year-old Utah gas station owner was
named to inherit one-sixteenth, or about $125
million, of Hughes' estate.
At least 10 spelling errors in the yellowed
document, plus a reference to the "Spruce
Goose" — a name for his wooden airplane that
Hughes considered derogatory — raised suspi
cions of his former associates.
According to the document, the bulk of the
estate, estimated at up to $2.5 billion, would go
to medical research and charitable organiza
tions. Hughes' two former wives, his aides and
other individuals would receive most of the rest.
The holographic will — so called because it
purports to be written in the decedent's own
hand — contains no signatures of witnesses.
I lowever, a federal judge in Clark County said a
holographic will does not require witnesses,

munization program for the latest tin type seems
to have quieted with Congress' approval ot $135
million for it. But now there is a new flu flap.
The latest strain is known as the swine flu and
the official name is A-NewJersey-76, but it turns
out nobody wants to claim the name, let alone
the blame.
The name swine flu came about because the
flu resembles a virus found in swine. However,
there is no known probability for humans con
tracting the disease from eating pork.
Hog growers already art; whining about refer
ences to swine flu, which they say is a slam at the
already maligned pig. And officials in New Jer
sey, where the flu was discovered at Ft. Dix,
think the state has enough problems and doesn't
need a flu named for it.
"No matter how you slice the bacon, swine flu
is swine flu," said Scott McGlasson of the New
Jersey Department of Labor and Industry.
Bay Area electronics firm indicted
SAN FRANCISCO — A Bay Area firm has been
charged with illegally exporting $3 million in

sophisticated electronics manufacturing
equipment to the Soviet Union in what may be
the start of a federal crackdown on such transac
tions.
The federal indictment returned Wednesday
against 1.1. Industries Inc. paints a cloak-and
dagger picture of fictitious firms, mysterious
foreign "middlemen" and complex equipment
disguised as washing machines and ovens to
avoid detection by customs authorities.
It alleges that the Sunnyvale firm, three
of its officers and three West German nationals
violated U.S. law forbidding exportation to
communist countries of any goods which
will "significantly increase. . . present or poten
tial military capability."
The indictment charges the defendants con
spired to export the prohibited goods to the
Soviet Union between April 1, 1975. and last
Jan. 17.

Hughes' will filed in Nevada?
LAS VEGAS — A crudely handwritten docu
ment described as the will of the late billionaire
Howard Hughes was filed with a Nevada court
yesterday, but its authenticity remained in
doubt.
The Mormon church, which found the pur
ported will, was listed as a major beneficiary
while a 31-year-old Utah gas station owner was
named to inherit one-sixteenth, or about $125
million, of Hughes' estate.
At least 10 spelling errors in the yellowed
document, plus a reference to the "Spruce
Goose" — a name for his wooden airplane that
Hughes considered derogatory — raised suspi
cions of his former associates.
According to the document, the bulk of the
estate, estimated at up to $2.5 billion, would go
to medical research and charitable organiza
tions. Hughes' two former wives, his aides and
other individuals would receive most of the rest.
The holographic will — so called because it
purports to be written in the decedent's own
hand — contains no signatures of witnesses.
I lowever, a federal judge in Clark County said a
holographic will does not require witnesses,
merely verification from handwriting experts.
FBl's King investigation reviewed
WASHINGTON — The Justice Department
yesterday launched a full review of the FBI in
vestigation of the death of Dr. Martin Luther
King, although Atly. Gen. Fdward Levi said a
preliminary inquiry turned up no evidence that
the probe was less than thorough.
Levi said he will assign a team of department
lawyers to review some 200,000 FBI documents
dealing with the assassination of King and also
the FBI campaign to harass and discredit him as
a civil rights leader.
Assistant Attv. Gen. J. Stanley Pottinger had
recommended the appointment of an outside
commission, including civil rights leaders, to
pursue the investigation.
But Levi rejected the approach because he
"believes this department has a very serious re
sponsibility to insure that any alleged wrongdo
ing is dealt with by the attorney general," Pot
t inner told a news conference.

Levi's decision to keep the investigation
within the department was attacked im
mediately by the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, who
succeeded King as head of the Southern Christ
ian Leadership Conference.
"1 do not have any faith whatsoever in the
investigation as conducted by the FBI in the
tragic assassination," Abernathy said in Atlanta.
New S F strike proposal studied
SAN FRANCISCO — With striking labor lead
ers awaiting their response, the city's Hoard of
Supervisors met behind closed doors yesterday
to study a proposed settlement ot the 30-day
walkout.
"It appears we are on the same track." said a
cautiously optimistic Quentin Kopp. president
of the board. "I'm hopeful for a settlement . . . ."
Kopp said there would be no public comment
on the proposal until the labor leaders consider
the city's response. No details have been dis
closed but it was expected to rescind the salary
cuts which precipitated the walkout.
Meanwhile, helmeted policemen were posted
at Golden Gate Park to guard against further
breaks in a water main that has broken twice,
spewing millions of gallons of water and ham
pering service to a large residential area.
Sabotage was suspected in the water breaks.
Explosion shakes Soviet embassy
MOSCOW — The official news agency Tass
said a strong explosion at the gates of the Soviet
Embassy in Peking yesterday killed two Chinese
guards but caused no Soviet casualties.
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug in Bel
grade reported the explosion, but it said the two
Chinese guards were severely injured, not kil
led.
The Tass account said that the Soviet Embassy
suffered damage and that a protest was lodged
with Chinese authorities "in connection with
the incident."
The Tanjug report said there was no im
mediate indication what caused the explosion.
China and the Soviet Union have been
squabbling for years over ideological issues as
well as disputed border territory.
