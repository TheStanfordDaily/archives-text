# Humphrey will not run in presidential primaries
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — With tears
welling in his eyes, Sen. Hubert Hum
phrey. the "happy warrior" of three
unsuccessful presidential campaigns,
announced yesterday he would not
jump into the 1976 race.
"1 shall not enter the New Jersey
primary nor shall I authorize any
committee or committees to solicit
funds or work in my behalf," Hum
phrey told a news conference. "1 in
tend to run for re-election to the United
States Senate from the state of Min
nesota."
Humphrey made his announcement
in a jammed Senate caucus room,
scene of the Senate Watergate Commit
tee hearings as well as numerous de
clarations of candidacy for the presi
dency.
Thh Minnesota Democrat, who was
his party's presidential nominee in
1908 and a candidate for the nomina
tion in 1960 and 1972, left open the
possibility he would accept the nomi
nation if the convention in July should
turn to him.
But he described that possibility as
remote.

"I'm really not very optimistic," he
said. "I'm a realist about politics."
Former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Garter,
whose victory in the Pennsylvania
primary put pressure on Humphrey,
said he had "mixed emotions" about
the former vice president's decision.
Carter told reporters in Albany. Ga..
he would rather have met with Hum
phrey first bill said the decision will
give him a chance "to pull the factions
of the party back together."
Carter's campaign manager. Hamil
ton Jordan, said. "1 think this takes us a
long way toward winning the nomina
tion." He said it may be "a turning
point" in the campaign.
Rep. Morris Udall (D-Ariz.) de
scribed Humphrey's decision as "a
very big break for me."
"I'm hoping that a lot of the kind of
people who would support Humphrey
will come to me," he said.
Sen. Frank Church (D-ldaho), cam
paigning in Oregon, said the de
cision may help his own efforts.
Despite Humphrey's announcment,
James Dugan, Democratic state chair
man for New Jersey, said he will push

for an uncommitted slate of delegates
that he considers to be a Humphrey
slate.
President Ford, campaigning in
Texas, said he thinks the only way
Democrats can stop Carter's drive is in
the smoke-filled rooms of a brokered
convention"and I think the public
would object to that."
If Carter is the Democratic nominee,
he said, it "will be a contest between a
proven record on my part and a chal
lenger without experience in the Oval
Office."
After Carter's solid victory Tuesday,
Humphrey met with supporters to dis
cuss formation of an exploratory
committee. But according to Robert
Short, a Minneapolis hotelman and
top Humphrey supporter, the consen
sus was that it was too late to set up an
exploratory group.
Short said Humphrey had to decide
to make an all-out effort incuding run
ning in the primaries or staying out of
the race entirely.
The deadline for entering the New
Jersey primary was yesterday after
noon.
Humphrey's name will be on the bal
lot in primaries in Nebraska, Oregon
and Idaho in May. The senator told
reporters that when he considered
campaigning in those states he
realized there was not enough time.
"One thing I don't need at this age is to
look ridiculous," he said.
Asked if he could support Carter,
Humphrey said, "I always look with
favor on fellow Democrats."
Meanwhile, another Democratic
candidate, California Cov. Edmund
Brown,said in Maryland he does not
think that anyone, including Carter,
has the nomination locked up.
Several hundred people stood in
line outside the high-ceilinged caucus
room for nearly an hour before Hum
phrey arrived to make his dramatic
announcement.
Some of the people crowding into
the room wore buttons that said,
"Humphrey '76," buttons that could
serve as well for a senatorial as for a
presidential campaign.

Meanwhile, another Democratic
candidate, California Cov. Edmund
Brown,said in Maryland he does not
think that anyone, including Carter,
has the nomination locked up.
Several hundred people stood in
line outside the high-ceilinged caucus
room for nearly an hour before Hum
phrey arrived to make his dramatic
announcement.
Some of the people crowding into
the room wore buttons that said,
"Humphrey '76," buttons that could
serve as well for a senatorial as for a
presidential campaign.
WASHINGTON (AP) — With tears
welling in his eyes, Sen. Hubert Hum
phrey. the "happy warrior" of three
unsuccessful presidential campaigns,
announced yesterday he would not
jump into the 1976 race.
"1 shall not enter the New Jersey
primary nor shall I authorize any
committee or committees to solicit
funds or work in my behalf," Hum
phrey told a news conference. "1 in
tend to run for re-election to the United
States Senate from the state of Min
nesota."
Humphrey made his announcement
in a jammed Senate caucus room,
scene of the Senate Watergate Commit
tee hearings as well as numerous de
clarations of candidacy for the presi
dency.
Thh Minnesota Democrat, who was
his party's presidential nominee in
1908 and a candidate for the nomina
tion in 1960 and 1972, left open the
possibility he would accept the nomi
nation if the convention in July should
turn to him.
But he described that possibility as
remote.

"I'm really not very optimistic," he
said. "I'm a realist about politics."
Former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Garter,
whose victory in the Pennsylvania
primary put pressure on Humphrey,
said he had "mixed emotions" about
the former vice president's decision.
Carter told reporters in Albany. Ga..
he would rather have met with Hum
phrey first bill said the decision will
give him a chance "to pull the factions
of the party back together."
Carter's campaign manager. Hamil
ton Jordan, said. "1 think this takes us a
long way toward winning the nomina
tion." He said it may be "a turning
point" in the campaign.
Rep. Morris Udall (D-Ariz.) de
scribed Humphrey's decision as "a
very big break for me."
"I'm hoping that a lot of the kind of
people who would support Humphrey
will come to me," he said.
Sen. Frank Church (D-ldaho), cam
paigning in Oregon, said the de
cision may help his own efforts.
Despite Humphrey's announcment,
James Dugan, Democratic state chair
man for New Jersey, said he will push

for an uncommitted slate of delegates
that he considers to be a Humphrey
slate.
President Ford, campaigning in
Texas, said he thinks the only way
Democrats can stop Carter's drive is in
the smoke-filled rooms of a brokered
convention"and I think the public
would object to that."
If Carter is the Democratic nominee,
he said, it "will be a contest between a
proven record on my part and a chal
lenger without experience in the Oval
Office."
After Carter's solid victory Tuesday,
Humphrey met with supporters to dis
cuss formation of an exploratory
committee. But according to Robert
Short, a Minneapolis hotelman and
top Humphrey supporter, the consen
sus was that it was too late to set up an
exploratory group.
Short said Humphrey had to decide
to make an all-out effort incuding run
ning in the primaries or staying out of
the race entirely.
The deadline for entering the New
Jersey primary was yesterday after
noon.
Humphrey's name will be on the bal
lot in primaries in Nebraska, Oregon
and Idaho in May. The senator told
reporters that when he considered
campaigning in those states he
realized there was not enough time.
"One thing I don't need at this age is to
look ridiculous," he said.
Asked if he could support Carter,
Humphrey said, "I always look with
favor on fellow Democrats."
Meanwhile, another Democratic
candidate, California Cov. Edmund
Brown,said in Maryland he does not
think that anyone, including Carter,
has the nomination locked up.
