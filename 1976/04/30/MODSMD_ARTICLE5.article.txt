## 
### Stephen Crolius 
"If we can't provide the security and
control necessary (for a safe Big Game
Bontire next year), . . . then it's un
likely we can have the bonfire," Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons said
yesterday, commenting on Asst. Dean
of Student Affairs Thomas Massey's
recommendations for the future of the
evet,'

"If we can do it (provide the neces

It further recommends that a "panel
of organizers" be formed which would
include "broadly based interest

Council (IFC)and Palo Alto residents.
Lyons said he would definitely act
on this second recommendation, say

prior item on the agenda: that is, to

September)."
Community support
Massey's third recommendation
suggests that "significant student and

'Big Game Rally Night,' " and that
