# '76 bonfire to depend on adequate security
## 
### Stephen Crolius 
"If we can't provide the security and
control necessary (for a safe Big Game
Bontire next year), . . . then it's un
likely we can have the bonfire," Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons said
yesterday, commenting on Asst. Dean
of Student Affairs Thomas Massey's
recommendations for the future of the
evet,'
"The important issue is what to do
about the non-students who spoiled
the event last year." Lyons said.
"If we can do it (provide the neces
sary security) then the next question is
at what cost, and are we willing to as
sume that cost," added Lyons.
Recurrent concerns
Massey's recommendation re
viewed the "problems and concerns
recurrent in the bonfire issue," and
made three recommendations regard
ing the future of the blaze.
The first recommendation states that
the bonfire should "be put in a more
proper perspective," and suggests that
"the bonfire would be, if the decision
is to continue having one, an agenda
item on a larger program."
The second recommendation
suggests that "a survey of opinion be
made toward the end of this quarter
but not later than the first weeks of fall
quarter."
It further recommends that a "panel
of organizers" be formed which would
include "broadly based interest
groups in the University family," such
as the ASSU Senate, the Council of
Presidents (COP), the Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC)and Palo Alto residents.
Lyons said he would definitely act
on this second recommendation, say
ing, "I think there might even be a

prior item on the agenda: that is, to
address the question should there be a
bonfire as part of the rally at all." If the
bonfire is not rejected by an over
whelmingly negative response to this
question from students, Lyons said "1
would be very pleased to have the
group set up before school starts (next
September)."
Community support
Massey's third recommendation
suggests that "significant student and
community support be solicited for
'Big Game Rally Night,' " and that
"volunteers be signed up to participate
in outtinu on the event and comole
menting the staff support that is pro
vided."
Newly elected COP President Vic
Petroff said yesterday he feels the
question of whether there should be a
bonfire or not should be put on the fall
ballot as a referendum.
Collecting student opinion in this
way would "give us an indication of
what to work for," he said.
'A smaller bonfire'
If such a referendum produces no
clear-cut majority of students either for
oragainst the blaze.the COP will try to
arrange a compromise in the form of "a
smaller bonfire," Petroff said.
IFC President Bob Ottilie said yes
terday he feels the organization of the
bonfire is already broadly based.
"We'd like as broad based an event
as possible," he said. "And we've al
ways attempted to broaden the base.
". . . Put it's not something that can
be expanded any more because we've
already expanded to include every
possibility."
