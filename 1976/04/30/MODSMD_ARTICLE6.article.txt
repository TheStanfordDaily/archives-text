# Summer profs chosen for visibility, teaching
##

Students who will be registered for
summer quarter this year will have an
opportunity to sample some "un
usual" teachers in 11 departments.
In the Philosophy Department, for
example, "we usually try to have one
(summer) visitor with some visibility,
someone who can do sometliing out of
the ordinary," Acting Philosophy
Dept. Chairman David Nivison says.
"We aren't seeking people on the
basis of having written interesting
papers. We do want good teachers," he
says.
Other departments have chosen
summer visitors for reasons similar to
Nivison's. "What we try to do is com

plement our selected faculty with
skills which they may not represent,"
said William Iverson, associate dean of
the School of Education.
Affective education
"For example, there is no one on our
faculty in affective education," Iver
son said. "So we will have Bruno Bet
telheim on psychoanalysis and educa
tion."
Bettelheim was formerly the direc
tor of the orthogenic school in Chicago
for children with emotional problems,
according to Iverson.
Another visiting education profes
sor, Thomas Knapp, specializes in
statistical analysis as it applies to edu
cation.
Richard Bube, chairman of the Mate
rials Science and Engineering Dept.,
says "We use these (visiting professor
positions) to bring in people who
aren't usually found in universitites to
teach courses that aren't usually
taught, to broaden the perspective of
students."
Choosing profs 'fun'
Bube calls choosing summer profes
sors "fun" and says there was "no real
problem doing it." He says somebody
in his department invariably knows of
someone on sabbatical or who is going
to be in the country.
Nivison says "we try to advertise,
but we can't afford the time. We would
get hundreds of applications. Summer
staffing is done informally. It's quite
easy to get competent teachers, and
they're not always well known."
Iverson said people in his field get to
know each other through publications
and meetings such as those of the
American Psychiatric Associaton
every year. At the meetings, those who
communicate effectively are remem
bered as possible teachers.
Names submitted
Names to be considered for ap
pointment are submitted to the deans
of the various schools, according to
Sue Horst, assistant to the vice provost
for faculty affairs.
The final decision for summer ap
pointments is then made in the Pro
vost's Office, she said.
The decision is made in a less formal
manner than an ordinary appoint
ment, which requires approval of the
president and the Board of Trustees,
according to Horst.
