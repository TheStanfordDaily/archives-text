## U.S.policy change 
### 
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's strong state
ments in opposition to the illegal white minority re
gime in Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) give some encourage
ment to all those who favor self-determination and
majority rule in Africa.
Kissinger publicly stopped short of promising aid to
black liberation movements in that country, but ac
cording to news reports, the United States government
might be willing to offer economic, and possibly milit
ary aid to such movements.
While this remains short of open support by the
United States of black rule in Zimbabwe, it comes as a
welcome change from the government's earlier fence
straddling. Kissinger's statements in Lusaka on Tues
day were even more emphatic.
There can of course be some debate over whether the
United States should give any aid to foreign nations,
but if it does so, it should certainly intervene on the
proper side. No black nation in Africa has ever thrown
off Western oppression without outside assistance. For
once, the United States seems willing to support the
cause of African self-determination, rather than to aid
and abet the oppressors.
