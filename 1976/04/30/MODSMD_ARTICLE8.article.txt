## Differences 
### 
In his Daily column April 27
Viae Kershner characterized as
"minor" the difference between
Jimmy Carter and Hubert Hum
phrey over the treatment of Viet
nam war resisters. It is not a
minor difference to the tens of
thousands of men who refused to
take part in a criminal war and
are now underground or in
exile.
Humphrey would require
"service" on their part — which
many of them refuse to perform
on grounds of conscience — be
fore they could resume normal
lives. Carter says he would sim
ply call them all home within a
week of his taking office.
As for the "minor" foreign
policy differences between Car
ter and Ford-Kissi nger, the latter
would have involved us in

another bloody struggle in An
gola while Carter spoke out
strongly against our involve
ment. Carter has pledged to re
move all 700 nuclear weapons
from South Korea and eventu
ally al 1 American troops. He may
be an ambitious man, but unlike
Kissinger he has shown no signs
of wishing to police the entire
world.
Kershner is right that the news
media tell us how to think about
the election. The press has fos
tered the myth that Carter has
not taken specific stands on is
sues. But the evidence — includ
ing his positions on gun control,
the Selective Service system,
welfare, tax reform and conser
vation — is to the contrary.
