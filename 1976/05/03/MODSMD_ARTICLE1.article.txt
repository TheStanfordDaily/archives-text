# 'Course Guide' manager chosen
## 
### Lori Matsukawa 
The ASSIJ Course Guide Policy
Board confirmed the appointment of a
new project manager Friday-
Greg Larson, a junior political sci
ence major, will be taking over the
reins of the ASSU Course Guide.
The biggest change next year will be
the format of the guide, said Larson,
who has been the busi ness manager for
IV2 quarters this year.
"It will be a tabloid, similar in size to
the Daily's Thursday, about 50 pages
long and will be delivered free to each
dormitory room each quarter," he said.
According to an operating plan and
proposed budget for 1976-77, which
Larson said he will submit to the ASSIJ
Senate at next Monday's meeting,
printing costs of the tabloid will be
approximately $2750 or "nearly $250
less than that spent last ye.»r ..." on a
bound and stapled course guide.
Cost-cutting essential
Larson said he views cost-cutting
measures as essential in order to ex
pand course guide services.
"Unlike other ASSU projects, the
Course Guide cannot break even. We
spend more than we can bring in,"
Larson said. "We need donations from
the Publications Board, the ASSU Se
nate and administration funds."
Larson said he hopes to receive
$2000 from the Publications Board,
$2000 from the senate and $1000 from
the Office of the Dean of Under
graduate Studies and the Office of the
Dean of Student Affairs.
"Wo are looking into a possible fee
assessment once every two or four
years as a new revenue source." said
Larson. Until such a system is set up,
funding for the project must continue
to come from the three sources, he
added.
Another cost-cutting move Larson
said he hopes to implement is using
"pre-arranged volunteers who would
be willing to pass out. collect and re
turn to the office all class question
naires."
The operating plan indicates the
possibility of implementing a plan
where by student distributors are paid
$1 per course, but Larson said he and
ASSU Financial Manager Chris Cline
later decided a volunteer plan should
be seriously considered.
Sufficient data
In order to serve students better. Lar
son said he hopes to provide sufficient
data on as many courses as possible.
"The specific area I'm going to con

centrate on is questionnaire distribu
tion," he explained. "They provide the
main data for the Course Guide. One
problem is that we just haven't found
an effective way to get the question
naires from the office, to the classroom
and back again."
In some cases, said Larson, interfer
ence by professors prevents effective
use of the questionnaires.
"Some professors just did not want
the questionnaires returned to us.
There are definitely some professors
who don't think it's (the guide) a reli
able evaluation of their course," Lar
son said.
He commented that current Course
Guide manager Lance Friedmann and
staff have "started us down the road to
more dependable course evaluation
and better relations with the administ
ration and faculty."
Larson said he plans to continue
Friedmann's "non-antagonistic" ap
proach. "If the professor says he
doesn't want to be evaluated, we won't
force it or press too hard," said Larson.
Larson suggested that professors
who do consent to have their classes
evaluated not be allowed to see the
evaluations before they have been re
turned to the office.
Evaluations and tenure
"We want to give these evaluations
to tenure committees," said Larson,
commenting that Course Guide evalu
ations may help committees analyze a
professor's teaching abilities.
"If the professor does not want them
(evaluations) used by the commit
tees," said Larson, "he would have to
deal with the committee himself, say
ing why he doesn't think the informa
tion given is correct, or how he has
improved his course since the evalua
tion was taken."
Larson, who will be paid $1900 for
his work this summer and for the up
coming academic year, will be work
ing on a study of the feasibility of
evaluating graduate courses and fa
culty.
He is also working with Alice Sup
ton, director of the Student Center for
Innovation and Research in Education
(SCIRE) to establish an ASSU-SCIRE
Task Force on the Evaluation of Teach
ing.
According to the operating plan, the
task force would consist of students
and faculty and would "research and
analyze the current status of teaching
evaluation at Stanford."

who don't think it's (the guide) a reli
able evaluation of their course," Lar
son said.
He commented that current Course
Guide manager Lance Friedmann and
staff have "started us down the road to
more dependable course evaluation
and better relations with the administ
ration and faculty."
Larson said he plans to continue
Friedmann's "non-antagonistic" ap
proach. "If the professor says he
doesn't want to be evaluated, we won't
force it or press too hard," said Larson.
Larson suggested that professors
who do consent to have their classes
evaluated not be allowed to see the
evaluations before they have been re
turned to the office.
Evaluations and tenure
"We want to give these evaluations
to tenure committees," said Larson,
commenting that Course Guide evalu
ations may help committees analyze a
professor's teaching abilities.
"If the professor does not want them
(evaluations) used by the commit
tees," said Larson, "he would have to
deal with the committee himself, say
ing why he doesn't think the informa
tion given is correct, or how he has
improved his course since the evalua
tion was taken."
Larson, who will be paid $1900 for
his work this summer and for the up
coming academic year, will be work
ing on a study of the feasibility of
evaluating graduate courses and fa
culty.
He is also working with Alice Sup
ton, director of the Student Center for
Innovation and Research in Education
(SCIRE) to establish an ASSU-SCIRE
Task Force on the Evaluation of Teach
ing.
According to the operating plan, the
task force would consist of students
and faculty and would "research and
analyze the current status of teaching
evaluation at Stanford."

NEW GUIDE BOSS—Junior Greg Larson has been appointed as the new
'Course Guide' manager by the ASSU Course Guide Policy Board. Larson
plans a 50-page tabloid next year. He says it will cost less to print and will be
distributed free to each dorm room next year. Larson says he also hopes the
course evaluations will be used in tenure decisions.
The ASSIJ Course Guide Policy
Board confirmed the appointment of a
new project manager Friday-
Greg Larson, a junior political sci
ence major, will be taking over the
reins of the ASSU Course Guide.
The biggest change next year will be
the format of the guide, said Larson,
who has been the busi ness manager for
IV2 quarters this year.
"It will be a tabloid, similar in size to
the Daily's Thursday, about 50 pages
long and will be delivered free to each
dormitory room each quarter," he said.
According to an operating plan and
proposed budget for 1976-77, which
Larson said he will submit to the ASSIJ
Senate at next Monday's meeting,
printing costs of the tabloid will be
approximately $2750 or "nearly $250
less than that spent last ye.»r ..." on a
bound and stapled course guide.
Cost-cutting essential
Larson said he views cost-cutting
measures as essential in order to ex
pand course guide services.
"Unlike other ASSU projects, the
Course Guide cannot break even. We
spend more than we can bring in,"
Larson said. "We need donations from
the Publications Board, the ASSU Se
nate and administration funds."
Larson said he hopes to receive
$2000 from the Publications Board,
$2000 from the senate and $1000 from
the Office of the Dean of Under
graduate Studies and the Office of the
Dean of Student Affairs.
"Wo are looking into a possible fee
assessment once every two or four
years as a new revenue source." said
Larson. Until such a system is set up,
funding for the project must continue
to come from the three sources, he
added.
Another cost-cutting move Larson
said he hopes to implement is using
"pre-arranged volunteers who would
be willing to pass out. collect and re
turn to the office all class question
naires."
The operating plan indicates the
possibility of implementing a plan
where by student distributors are paid
$1 per course, but Larson said he and
ASSU Financial Manager Chris Cline
later decided a volunteer plan should
be seriously considered.
Sufficient data
In order to serve students better. Lar
son said he hopes to provide sufficient
data on as many courses as possible.
"The specific area I'm going to con

centrate on is questionnaire distribu
tion," he explained. "They provide the
main data for the Course Guide. One
problem is that we just haven't found
an effective way to get the question
naires from the office, to the classroom
and back again."
In some cases, said Larson, interfer
ence by professors prevents effective
use of the questionnaires.
"Some professors just did not want
the questionnaires returned to us.

who don't think it's (the guide) a reli
able evaluation of their course," Lar
son said.
