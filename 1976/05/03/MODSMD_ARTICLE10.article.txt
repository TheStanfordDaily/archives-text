# TV news becomes sensationalistic
## 
### 
ABC has made television history by hir
ing Barbara Walters to become the first tele
vision network anchorwoman — and at $1
million a year for five years. Not only will
Walters be the first female newscaster, but
she will also be the highest paid newscaster
on any network.
The contract ABC has made with Walters
illuminates some of the interesting
philosophies by which the major TV net
works are apparently run — especially their
news departments.
First, the Nielsen ratings show that ABC's
news division has third place all to itself in
audience viewing. Some 27 percent of
the audience was watching Walter Cron
kite on CBS while 25 percent was watching
John Chancellor on NBC during the first
quarter of this year.
However, only 19 percent was watching
112 larry Reasoner on ABC. Three years ago, 23
percent of the viewers was watching ABC.
Not comparable
Furthermore, ABC's news division's
budget is not comparable to those of the
other networks. ABC has recently halved
the number of programs for its documentary
series.
NBC and CBS each have more correspon
dents than ABC, and many of ABC's corres
pondents are thought to be not quite so good
as their counterparts on the other two net
works.
In light of all this, ABC became a particip
ant to a bidding contest that makes some pro
sports deals pale by comparison.
After Walters decided to pass up NBC's
offers to stay with that net
work, her package with ABC included
doubling her present $500,000 per year, ap
pearing on other ABC news and documen
tary series and occasionally hosting Issues
and Answers, ABC's Sunday interview
program.
The idea to attempt to attract Walters
away from NBC supposedly originated with
ABC's television division president — and
not with the chief of its news division.
ABC may think its ratings, and thus its
advertising revenues, will increase because

it can now boast of Walters on its evening
news shows. However, ABC has done tele
vision and all of journalism a great disser
vice by hiring Walters in this fashion.
ABC now seems to equate the hiring of a
newscaster with the hiring of an actor or
actress for one of its prime-time entertain
ment shows.

ABC had problems with its evening news
show,according to the ratings. Yet hiring
Walters at this price is a drastic step, which
appears to be an "all-or-nothing" approach
to raising the quality of its news program.
Walters had made her reputation mainly on
her interviewing, something on which
evenings news programs are usually not
based.
Walters' Today show on NBC has re
cently suffered a loss of viewers. ABC does
not appear to have considered what it will
do when the novelty of watching Walters
wears off, and the network has to keep pay
ing her until the five-year contract expires.
Not too surprising
Most of this isn't too surprising since it
comes from a television news organization.
Women newscasters (and weather
forecasters and sportscasters) have sud
denly popped up at the anchor desks on the
afliliate stations of the three major networks
at an amazing rate in the last few years. Thus
it was only a matter of time before there was
an anchorwoman on a national news prog
ram. But h'ow many women news corres
pondents are there these days?
Of course, ABC is the network which has
many affiliates that boast of the "happy
talk" news program, where the newscasters

laugh their way through reports of catas
trophes. ABC was rumored to be consider
ing a "happy talk"'national news program
earlier this year. Suddenly, they've signed
up Walters.
All this boils down to the question of just
what do the networks want to offer through
their news programs. Do they want big
names that will attract viewers, regardless
of content? (Remember, ABC brought you
Howard Cosell "live" earlier this season.)
Handsome anchormen
Do the "big three" networks (and their
affiliates) want to present handsome an
chormen, cute anchorwomen, electronic
studios and news presented in a coffee-table
atmosphere?
ABC has opened the door for television
news programs to be run like television en
tertainment shows. And after the last season
of prime-time shows on all three networks,
one would think ABC would have learned
its lesson.
So what's next in the electronic medium?
Newscasters doing advertising and endors
ing products on the news show?
The network news shows seems to have
forgotten that they are news-gathering and
news-disseminating operations. TV net
works seem to want to cash in on that large,
captive audience every night in any way
they can.
Take advantage
Instead of bringing us more newscasters,
the networks should take advantage of the
fact they can be both seen and heard by the
public. More in-the-field coverage should
be presented.
TV news organizations have shifted
course and now seem to be playing up the
television, instead of the news, part of their
operation. The networks should reassess
just what their purpose is and how they
plan to accomplish it.
It's time tor the networks to stop imposing
their showbiz news thinking on the public.
After all, TV stations are licensed by our
government for "the public good."

ABC has made television history by hir
ing Barbara Walters to become the first tele
vision network anchorwoman — and at $1
million a year for five years. Not only will
Walters be the first female newscaster, but
she will also be the highest paid newscaster
on any network.
The contract ABC has made with Walters
illuminates some of the interesting
philosophies by which the major TV net
works are apparently run — especially their
news departments.
First, the Nielsen ratings show that ABC's
news division has third place all to itself in
audience viewing. Some 27 percent of
the audience was watching Walter Cron
kite on CBS while 25 percent was watching
John Chancellor on NBC during the first
quarter of this year.
However, only 19 percent was watching
112 larry Reasoner on ABC. Three years ago, 23
percent of the viewers was watching ABC.
Not comparable
Furthermore, ABC's news division's
budget is not comparable to those of the
other networks. ABC has recently halved
the number of programs for its documentary
series.
NBC and CBS each have more correspon
dents than ABC, and many of ABC's corres
pondents are thought to be not quite so good
as their counterparts on the other two net
works.
In light of all this, ABC became a particip
ant to a bidding contest that makes some pro
sports deals pale by comparison.
After Walters decided to pass up NBC's
offers to stay with that net
work, her package with ABC included
doubling her present $500,000 per year, ap
pearing on other ABC news and documen
tary series and occasionally hosting Issues
and Answers, ABC's Sunday interview
program.
The idea to attempt to attract Walters
away from NBC supposedly originated with
ABC's television division president — and
not with the chief of its news division.
ABC may think its ratings, and thus its
advertising revenues, will increase because

it can now boast of Walters on its evening
news shows. However, ABC has done tele
vision and all of journalism a great disser
vice by hiring Walters in this fashion.
ABC now seems to equate the hiring of a
newscaster with the hiring of an actor or
actress for one of its prime-time entertain
ment shows.

ABC had problems with its evening news
show,according to the ratings. Yet hiring
Walters at this price is a drastic step, which
appears to be an "all-or-nothing" approach
to raising the quality of its news program.
Walters had made her reputation mainly on
her interviewing, something on which
evenings news programs are usually not
based.
Walters' Today show on NBC has re
cently suffered a loss of viewers. ABC does
not appear to have considered what it will
do when the novelty of watching Walters
wears off, and the network has to keep pay
ing her until the five-year contract expires.
Not too surprising
Most of this isn't too surprising since it
comes from a television news organization.
Women newscasters (and weather
forecasters and sportscasters) have sud
denly popped up at the anchor desks on the
afliliate stations of the three major networks
at an amazing rate in the last few years. Thus
it was only a matter of time before there was
an anchorwoman on a national news prog
ram. But h'ow many women news corres
pondents are there these days?
Of course, ABC is the network which has
many affiliates that boast of the "happy
talk" news program, where the newscasters

laugh their way through reports of catas
trophes. ABC was rumored to be consider
ing a "happy talk"'national news program
earlier this year. Suddenly, they've signed
up Walters.
All this boils down to the question of just
what do the networks want to offer through
their news programs. Do they want big
names that will attract viewers, regardless
of content? (Remember, ABC brought you
Howard Cosell "live" earlier this season.)
Handsome anchormen
Do the "big three" networks (and their
affiliates) want to present handsome an
chormen, cute anchorwomen, electronic
studios and news presented in a coffee-table
atmosphere?
ABC has opened the door for television
news programs to be run like television en
tertainment shows. And after the last season
of prime-time shows on all three networks,
one would think ABC would have learned
its lesson.
So what's next in the electronic medium?
Newscasters doing advertising and endors
ing products on the news show?
The network news shows seems to have
forgotten that they are news-gathering and
news-disseminating operations. TV net
works seem to want to cash in on that large,
captive audience every night in any way
they can.
Take advantage
Instead of bringing us more newscasters,
the networks should take advantage of the
fact they can be both seen and heard by the
public. More in-the-field coverage should
be presented.
TV news organizations have shifted
course and now seem to be playing up the
television, instead of the news, part of their
operation. The networks should reassess
just what their purpose is and how they
plan to accomplish it.
It's time tor the networks to stop imposing
their showbiz news thinking on the public.
After all, TV stations are licensed by our
government for "the public good."

ABC has made television history by hir
ing Barbara Walters to become the first tele
vision network anchorwoman — and at $1
million a year for five years. Not only will
Walters be the first female newscaster, but
she will also be the highest paid newscaster
on any network.
The contract ABC has made with Walters
illuminates some of the interesting
philosophies by which the major TV net
works are apparently run — especially their
news departments.
First, the Nielsen ratings show that ABC's
news division has third place all to itself in
audience viewing. Some 27 percent of
the audience was watching Walter Cron
kite on CBS while 25 percent was watching
John Chancellor on NBC during the first
quarter of this year.
However, only 19 percent was watching
112 larry Reasoner on ABC. Three years ago, 23
percent of the viewers was watching ABC.
Not comparable
Furthermore, ABC's news division's
budget is not comparable to those of the
other networks. ABC has recently halved
the number of programs for its documentary
series.
NBC and CBS each have more correspon
dents than ABC, and many of ABC's corres
pondents are thought to be not quite so good
as their counterparts on the other two net
works.
In light of all this, ABC became a particip
ant to a bidding contest that makes some pro
sports deals pale by comparison.
After Walters decided to pass up NBC's
offers to stay with that net
work, her package with ABC included
doubling her present $500,000 per year, ap
pearing on other ABC news and documen
tary series and occasionally hosting Issues
and Answers, ABC's Sunday interview
program.
The idea to attempt to attract Walters
away from NBC supposedly originated with
ABC's television division president — and
not with the chief of its news division.
ABC may think its ratings, and thus its
advertising revenues, will increase because

it can now boast of Walters on its evening
news shows. However, ABC has done tele
vision and all of journalism a great disser
vice by hiring Walters in this fashion.
ABC now seems to equate the hiring of a
newscaster with the hiring of an actor or
actress for one of its prime-time entertain
ment shows.

ABC had problems with its evening news
show,according to the ratings. Yet hiring
Walters at this price is a drastic step, which
appears to be an "all-or-nothing" approach
to raising the quality of its news program.
Walters had made her reputation mainly on
her interviewing, something on which
evenings news programs are usually not
based.
Walters' Today show on NBC has re
cently suffered a loss of viewers. ABC does
not appear to have considered what it will
do when the novelty of watching Walters
wears off, and the network has to keep pay
ing her until the five-year contract expires.
Not too surprising
Most of this isn't too surprising since it
comes from a television news organization.
Women newscasters (and weather
forecasters and sportscasters) have sud
denly popped up at the anchor desks on the
afliliate stations of the three major networks
at an amazing rate in the last few years. Thus
it was only a matter of time before there was
an anchorwoman on a national news prog
ram. But h'ow many women news corres
pondents are there these days?
Of course, ABC is the network which has
many affiliates that boast of the "happy
talk" news program, where the newscasters

laugh their way through reports of catas
trophes. ABC was rumored to be consider
ing a "happy talk"'national news program
earlier this year. Suddenly, they've signed
up Walters.
All this boils down to the question of just
what do the networks want to offer through
their news programs. Do they want big
names that will attract viewers, regardless
of content? (Remember, ABC brought you
Howard Cosell "live" earlier this season.)
Handsome anchormen
Do the "big three" networks (and their
affiliates) want to present handsome an
chormen, cute anchorwomen, electronic
studios and news presented in a coffee-table
atmosphere?
ABC has opened the door for television
news programs to be run like television en
tertainment shows. And after the last season
of prime-time shows on all three networks,
one would think ABC would have learned
its lesson.
So what's next in the electronic medium?
Newscasters doing advertising and endors
ing products on the news show?
The network news shows seems to have
forgotten that they are news-gathering and
news-disseminating operations. TV net
works seem to want to cash in on that large,
captive audience every night in any way
they can.
Take advantage
Instead of bringing us more newscasters,
the networks should take advantage of the
fact they can be both seen and heard by the
public. More in-the-field coverage should
be presented.
TV news organizations have shifted
course and now seem to be playing up the
television, instead of the news, part of their
operation. The networks should reassess
just what their purpose is and how they
plan to accomplish it.
It's time tor the networks to stop imposing
their showbiz news thinking on the public.
After all, TV stations are licensed by our
government for "the public good."
