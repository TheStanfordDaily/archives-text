# 'Confusion plagues blacks': columnist

### Mark Shibuya 
"I see a tremendous amount of
confusion in black America, and
the irony is that there could be
more confusion among intellec
tual Americans than those in the
street," said Carl Rowan, black
syndicated columnist for the
Chicago Daily News.
Speaking at a symposium
sponsored by the Black Craduate
Students Organization Thurs
day, Rowan said "one of the
things that troubles black
America is self-hatred, and there
is no greater manifestation of
self-hatred than the thought that
no black American has the for
titude, the guts, the balls to make
it without selling out to the
white man."
Rowan called for black "infilt
ration" of the political and
economic structure of the United
States.
He pointed out that this year
would see changes in the presi
dency and Congress, and"the
role of the black professional is
to have some kind of voice in
who fills those jobs."
Calling the cities of the North,
West and Northeast those most

resistant to social change —
"just as myopic as the South was
three decades ago" — Rowan
said "one of the roles of the black
professional is to say to the cities
that they can't practice Jim Crow
and prosper."
Rowan discounted as a fallacy
the Ford Administration's con
tention that black Americans
would prosper as the nation as a
whole came out of the recession.
He cited February's unemploy
ment statistics which show that,
while general unemployment
fell, black unemployment rose.
"The role of the black profes
sional is not only to become doc
tors, lawyers and teachers, but
also to wake up the rest of society
to the fact that we have this per
manent jobless class and to what
it's doing to the black family," he
said.
