## Lazetich blames second beer Alumni gridders fall to varsity 
### Chris Baker 
It was late in the game when
Stanford Alumni offensive
coach Jim Plunkett threw his
play cards into the air and
walked over to the sidelines for
an ice-cold Oly.
Plunkett didn't exactly have a
good day as the play-caller for
the Alumni in Saturday's second
annual Varsity-Alumni football
game. The Robber Barons, or as
the game announcer said, "we're
going to call them everything
today," rolled to a 24-0 win over
the grads. The Trees beat the
Alums by a 27-0 score last
year.
The Alums' biggest scoring
threat came on the last play of
the game, when Denver Broncos'
safety Randy Poltl picked up the
ball before the Cards could snap
it and raced 75 yards for an il
legal touchdown.
"I know we didn't have it after
the second," said Alumni defen
sive player-coach Pete Lazetich.
"Second score?" asked the re
porter. "No, after my second
beer," replied Laz.

The Alumni really didn't have
it after the first quarter. Safety
Larry McCovern blocked a Dave
Ottmar punt early in the stanza
and cornerback John Piggott
tooktheball down totheAlumni
26.
Then starting quarterback Cuy
Benjamin (coach Jack Christian
sen gave everyone except Daily
reporter David Georgette a
chance at the helm) hit flanker
Tony Hill for 11 yards. Two
plays later, Benjamin lofted a
pass to split end Bill Kellar for a
15-yard touchdown.
A couple minutes later, defen
sive end Chuck Evans recovered
a fumble and Mike Michel
booted a 30-yard field goal, to
give the Cards a 10-0 first quarter
lead over the Alumni.
The Alumni used one of the
strangest defenses the varsity
had ever seen. "Even I couldn't
tell what was going on from the
sidelines," said Oakland Raid
ers' star guard George Buehler.
Cordova confused
It must have confused Mike
Cordova, who played most of the

second quarter, as well. Quarter
back Turk Schonert, who shared
time with Cordova, must have
felt pretty much like Mike did.
A Piggott interception of a
Dave Ottmar pass set up the var
sity's next scoring drive. The big
play was a 28-yard Cordova pass
to Tony Hill. Four plays later,
Cordova scored on a 5-yard run,
to make it 17-0.
Benjamin capped the Cards'
scoring attack with a 9-yard
pass to wide receiver Vince Mul
roy, who dragged two defenders
with him for a touchdown.
Christiansen's biggest goal
this spring has been switching
the defense from the "50" to a
multiple front. The Alums, led
by fullback Jack Alustiza, made
their only serious offensive
threat of the day in the fourth
quarter.
Shredded defense
Before a tiny"crowd,"the old
timers marched to the Card 20-
yard line. Alumni quarterback
Don Bunce shredded the varsity
defense with a 31-yard pass to
Jack Lasater. But Bunce, who
played as if his hands were
coated with surgical jelly, com
mitted his third fumble of the
day to end the threat.
As autograph seekers surged
around the Alumni players, try
ing to pull the Alumni out of un
iforms which had fit in 1960,
Plu nkett was surrounded by fans
who could remember when,
"you were a freshman at James
Lick High."
"We didn't move the ball well
offensively," said Plunkett. "I'm
starting to sound like a coach,"
he added.
The real coach, Christiansen,
said, "We'll just have to look at
the films and evaluate
everyone."
About even
The Card offense generated
only 98 yards passing and 97
yards rushing. Statistically, Ben
jamin and Cordova were about

even. Benjamin completed four
of six for 47 yards and two
touchdowns. And Cordova hit
on two of three passes for 35
yards. He also had a touchdown
on the ground.
John Finley was the varsity's
leading rusher with 18 yards. He
was followed by Dave Tenn, who
is trying to make a comeback
after missing most of last season
due to injuries.
"We're going to break down
the films of the game, to see how
everyone did," said Christian
sen. "We wanted to use every
body at quarterback and we
did."
But fans will still have to wait
until Sept. 11, the day of the
Penn State game, to find out who
the regular season starter will be.
As one fan said after the game,
"I wouldn't make my reserva
tions for Pasadena on the basis of
this game."

today," rolled to a 24-0 win over
the grads. The Trees beat the
Alums by a 27-0 score last
year.
The Alums' biggest scoring
threat came on the last play of
the game, when Denver Broncos'
safety Randy Poltl picked up the
ball before the Cards could snap
it and raced 75 yards for an il
legal touchdown.
"I know we didn't have it after
the second," said Alumni defen
sive player-coach Pete Lazetich.
"Second score?" asked the re
porter. "No, after my second
beer," replied Laz.

The Alumni really didn't have
it after the first quarter. Safety
Larry McCovern blocked a Dave
Ottmar punt early in the stanza
and cornerback John Piggott
tooktheball down totheAlumni
26.
Then starting quarterback Cuy
Benjamin (coach Jack Christian
sen gave everyone except Daily
reporter David Georgette a
chance at the helm) hit flanker
Tony Hill for 11 yards. Two
plays later, Benjamin lofted a
pass to split end Bill Kellar for a
15-yard touchdown.
A couple minutes later, defen
sive end Chuck Evans recovered
a fumble and Mike Michel
booted a 30-yard field goal, to
give the Cards a 10-0 first quarter
lead over the Alumni.
The Alumni used one of the
strangest defenses the varsity
had ever seen. "Even I couldn't
tell what was going on from the
sidelines," said Oakland Raid
ers' star guard George Buehler.
Cordova confused
It must have confused Mike
Cordova, who played most of the

second quarter, as well. Quarter
back Turk Schonert, who shared
time with Cordova, must have
felt pretty much like Mike did.
A Piggott interception of a
Dave Ottmar pass set up the var
sity's next scoring drive. The big
play was a 28-yard Cordova pass
to Tony Hill. Four plays later,
Cordova scored on a 5-yard run,
to make it 17-0.
Benjamin capped the Cards'
scoring attack with a 9-yard
pass to wide receiver Vince Mul
roy, who dragged two defenders
with him for a touchdown.
Christiansen's biggest goal
this spring has been switching
the defense from the "50" to a
multiple front. The Alums, led
by fullback Jack Alustiza, made
their only serious offensive
threat of the day in the fourth
quarter.
Shredded defense
Before a tiny"crowd,"the old
timers marched to the Card 20-
yard line. Alumni quarterback
Don Bunce shredded the varsity
defense with a 31-yard pass to
Jack Lasater. But Bunce, who
played as if his hands were
coated with surgical jelly, com
mitted his third fumble of the
day to end the threat.
As autograph seekers surged
around the Alumni players, try
ing to pull the Alumni out of un
iforms which had fit in 1960,
Plu nkett was surrounded by fans
who could remember when,
"you were a freshman at James
Lick High."
"We didn't move the ball well
offensively," said Plunkett. "I'm
starting to sound like a coach,"
he added.
The real coach, Christiansen,
said, "We'll just have to look at
the films and evaluate
everyone."
About even
The Card offense generated
only 98 yards passing and 97
yards rushing. Statistically, Ben
jamin and Cordova were about

even. Benjamin completed four
of six for 47 yards and two
touchdowns. And Cordova hit
on two of three passes for 35
yards. He also had a touchdown
on the ground.
John Finley was the varsity's
leading rusher with 18 yards. He
was followed by Dave Tenn, who
is trying to make a comeback
after missing most of last season
due to injuries.
"We're going to break down
the films of the game, to see how
everyone did," said Christian
sen. "We wanted to use every
body at quarterback and we
did."
But fans will still have to wait
until Sept. 11, the day of the
Penn State game, to find out who
the regular season starter will be.
As one fan said after the game,
"I wouldn't make my reserva
tions for Pasadena on the basis of
this game."

"Second score?" asked the re
porter. "No, after my second
beer," replied Laz.

The Alumni really didn't have
it after the first quarter. Safety
Larry McCovern blocked a Dave
Ottmar punt early in the stanza
and cornerback John Piggott
tooktheball down totheAlumni
26.
Then starting quarterback Cuy
Benjamin (coach Jack Christian
sen gave everyone except Daily
reporter David Georgette a
chance at the helm) hit flanker
Tony Hill for 11 yards. Two
plays later, Benjamin lofted a
pass to split end Bill Kellar for a
15-yard touchdown.
A couple minutes later, defen
sive end Chuck Evans recovered
a fumble and Mike Michel
booted a 30-yard field goal, to
give the Cards a 10-0 first quarter
lead over the Alumni.
The Alumni used one of the
strangest defenses the varsity
had ever seen. "Even I couldn't
tell what was going on from the
sidelines," said Oakland Raid
ers' star guard George Buehler.
Cordova confused
It must have confused Mike
Cordova, who played most of the

second quarter, as well. Quarter
back Turk Schonert, who shared
time with Cordova, must have
felt pretty much like Mike did.
A Piggott interception of a
Dave Ottmar pass set up the var
sity's next scoring drive. The big
play was a 28-yard Cordova pass
to Tony Hill. Four plays later,
Cordova scored on a 5-yard run,
to make it 17-0.
Benjamin capped the Cards'
scoring attack with a 9-yard
pass to wide receiver Vince Mul
roy, who dragged two defenders
with him for a touchdown.
Christiansen's biggest goal
this spring has been switching
the defense from the "50" to a
multiple front. The Alums, led
by fullback Jack Alustiza, made
their only serious offensive
threat of the day in the fourth
quarter.
Shredded defense
Before a tiny"crowd,"the old
timers marched to the Card 20-
yard line. Alumni quarterback
Don Bunce shredded the varsity
defense with a 31-yard pass to
Jack Lasater. But Bunce, who
played as if his hands were
coated with surgical jelly, com
mitted his third fumble of the
day to end the threat.
As autograph seekers surged
around the Alumni players, try
ing to pull the Alumni out of un
iforms which had fit in 1960,
Plu nkett was surrounded by fans
who could remember when,
"you were a freshman at James
Lick High."
"We didn't move the ball well
offensively," said Plunkett. "I'm
starting to sound like a coach,"
he added.
The real coach, Christiansen,
said, "We'll just have to look at
the films and evaluate
everyone."
About even
The Card offense generated
only 98 yards passing and 97
yards rushing. Statistically, Ben
jamin and Cordova were about

even. Benjamin completed four
of six for 47 yards and two
touchdowns. And Cordova hit
on two of three passes for 35
yards. He also had a touchdown
on the ground.
John Finley was the varsity's
leading rusher with 18 yards. He
was followed by Dave Tenn, who
is trying to make a comeback
after missing most of last season
due to injuries.
"We're going to break down
the films of the game, to see how
everyone did," said Christian
sen. "We wanted to use every
body at quarterback and we
did."
But fans will still have to wait
until Sept. 11, the day of the
Penn State game, to find out who
the regular season starter will be.
As one fan said after the game,
"I wouldn't make my reserva
tions for Pasadena on the basis of
this game."
