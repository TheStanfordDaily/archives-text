singlehanded championships,
to tie held May 22-29 in New
York.
Commenting on Skinner's
performance, Robber Baron

"I'd expected someone to do
well, but not this well. There was
a little bit of luck, but Skinner
was the most consistent there."
Skinner finished three points
behind Hugo Smith of San Diego
State. "I think I should have beat

him," Skinner said, "but he's a
good sailor."
Other finishers for the Barons
were Hugh Cullman, sixth,
Allan Andrews, eighth, Edward
Shapiro, 15th and Craig Daniels,
18th.
Skinner led by six points after
Saturday's races. Going into the

finished the 10 mile route in
25:34, a new IM record, accord

The times of the next 10
