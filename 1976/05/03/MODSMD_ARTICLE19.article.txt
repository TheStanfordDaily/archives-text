# All-Star Cornett places second
## 
### David Georgette 
Marianne Bretton of UCLA
fired a tournament low 78 Satur
day to lead the Southern Califor
nia Women's Intercol
legiate Athletic Conference
All-Stars to an 87-60 victory over
the Northern California Intercol
legiate Athletic Conference
All-Star team at the Alisal Ranch
in Solvang.
Stanford senior Pat Cornett,
matched against Bretton,
finished tied for second with
UCLA's Janet Cole at 79. Pam
Palmieri of Stanford finished
fourth with an 82 on the par 76
course.
With seven women on each
team, scoring was based on a
combination of the medal-match
point system and medal point
play.
Each team received two points
when a player won a match
overall, won the front nine or
won the back nine. The teams
also received 14 points for a
player placing first individually,
13 points for second and so on.
No level putts
Commenting on all the over
par scores, Palmieri said, "The
course was short, but really
tight. There was a lot of break on
the greens." Palmieri said she
doubted that she had a level putt
all day.
Cornett evaluated her perfor
mance as being "pretty poor. I
just putted awful. The greens
were tough to read. Pam and I
couldn't buy a putt between us."
Cornett called her play "dis
couraging." She said she hit her
irons well, but her trouble on the
green upset her.
Stanford coach Carroll Diaz,
coach of the North squad, agreed
with her golfers' appraisals. "It
was a tough golf. It was real
| tight."
Close play
The coach also said, despite
the wide margin of victory, "The
play was close." But she added,
"It was decisive as far as the
matches wre concerned."
Palmieri and Cornett both
praised the play of Stanford's
Ellen Sale. Sale shot a round of
85, including a sizzling 37 on the
back nine. Palmieri called it "a
super round. She did a great
job."

Sale said she "liked the back
nine," because the fairways were
wider. "When it's more open, 1
don't think about hitting the ball
out of bounds."
The tournament had origi
nally been slated as a two-day,
36 hole event. However, Friday's
rounds were ruled to be for prac
tice and only Saturday's scores
counted in the scoring.
Diaz said this change occurred
because of confusion resulting
from a lack of experience by the
conferences in conducting All-
Star format tournaments.
