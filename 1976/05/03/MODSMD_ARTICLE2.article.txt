# Wiesel notes man's indifference
## We forget suffering 'so quickly' 
### Bruce Kadden 
Author and philosopher Elie Wiesel said Friday that
"man has never been so indifferent" as he is today toward
such events as the killings at Kent State, starvation in
Biafra and destructive wars in Vietnam, Lebanon and
Bangladesh.
"We forget so quickly," without even learning the
slightest lesson, "to remember" such occurences, he said.
"Maybe events follow too fast." We are "no longer witnes
sing events as they are. and this can be a curse," he said.
"Society has never been so vulnerable to destruction.
Wiesel lamented. "Sometimes I wonder if we're not wit
nessing the end of time," in which "chaos will be

everywhere." according to Jewish literature. "I wonder
whether we are still alive."
VViesel delivered the fourth annual Kent State-Jackson
State Memorial Lecture to more than 500 persons in
Kresge Auditorium.
A survivor of the concentration camps at Auschwitz and
Buchenwald, Wiesel spoke as one who could never forget
the childhood experiences which shaped his life.
Warning
VViesel warned that "we may enter into an epoch of
madness" similar to the Crusades. anti-Jewish pogroms
and Na'.i holocaust. "I feel the world has not been
punished for what it has done to my people. Could this be

the beginning of the punishment?" he asked rhetorically.
"Indifference used to be a sin. Will it become a punish
ment?" he questioned. Onlookers who claim to be neutral
always "help the killer, not the victim," he charged, echo
ing a theme that runs through many of his 14 books.
But Wiesel, who said he lost faith in God's justice fol
lowing his concentration camp experience, indicated that
his hope has been rekindled. "Even of tragedies we can
draw lessons."
Evil and violence "must be unmasked, must be fought."
"Neutrality borders on indifference," he reiterated, urging
the audience to "protest, fight, demonstrate for justice"
and against injustice.
"We must believe in man even if it is in spite of man," he
said.
Witness and teacher
Besides playing the role of witness, Wiesel assumed the
role of teacher, which he currently experiences as profes
sor of Jewish studies at City College of new York.
"Truth can be found in the marketplace," he pointed
out. illustrating his point by a Hasidic story, one of his
favorite modes of presentation. "Experience must en
hance knowledge, not replace it."
But "in order to rebel against knowledge," one must
"acquire it first," Wiesel told the students.
Kent State reminds us that "evil has more power than
good," Wiesel said. "One rifle is stronger than 100 books."
The university is supposed to be a battleground for books
and words, rather than National Guardsmen, he stated.
"Students see the past covered with ruins. You share
our fear, our anguish, our despair, and you ask questions
to which there can be no answer," Wiesel said.
Responsible for world
Bearing the responsibility for his generation, he added,
"we've done you an injustice," by destroying the world for
you. "Now you're responsible for it."
Me said that the "awesome questions" human beings are
confronted with today are, "What ideals can we explore?"
and "What examples can you follow?"
He offered an answer to this question by quoting from
some holocaust victims' notebooks which he is currently
reading and editing.
Though they "knew their turn would come to be thrown
into the flames, they felt the need to bear witness," Wiesel
pointed out.
They could have reacted by saying, "if this is man, we
want no part of him,' but they decided to become
"chroniclers for man."
Third-year law student Daniel Brenner, who organized
this year's lecture, recalled to the audience the events of
May 1970. when seven students were killed during cam
pus protests at Kent State University in Ohio and Jackson
State College in Mississippi following President Richard
Nixon's announcement of the decision to send U.S. troops
to Cam bod in

"man has never been so indifferent" as he is today toward
such events as the killings at Kent State, starvation in
Biafra and destructive wars in Vietnam, Lebanon and
Bangladesh.
"We forget so quickly," without even learning the
slightest lesson, "to remember" such occurences, he said.
"Maybe events follow too fast." We are "no longer witnes
sing events as they are. and this can be a curse," he said.
"Society has never been so vulnerable to destruction.
Wiesel lamented. "Sometimes I wonder if we're not wit
nessing the end of time," in which "chaos will be

everywhere." according to Jewish literature. "I wonder
whether we are still alive."
VViesel delivered the fourth annual Kent State-Jackson
State Memorial Lecture to more than 500 persons in
Kresge Auditorium.
A survivor of the concentration camps at Auschwitz and
Buchenwald, Wiesel spoke as one who could never forget
the childhood experiences which shaped his life.
Warning
VViesel warned that "we may enter into an epoch of
madness" similar to the Crusades. anti-Jewish pogroms
and Na'.i holocaust. "I feel the world has not been
punished for what it has done to my people. Could this be

the beginning of the punishment?" he asked rhetorically.
"Indifference used to be a sin. Will it become a punish
ment?" he questioned. Onlookers who claim to be neutral
always "help the killer, not the victim," he charged, echo
ing a theme that runs through many of his 14 books.
But Wiesel, who said he lost faith in God's justice fol
lowing his concentration camp experience, indicated that
his hope has been rekindled. "Even of tragedies we can
draw lessons."
Evil and violence "must be unmasked, must be fought."
"Neutrality borders on indifference," he reiterated, urging
the audience to "protest, fight, demonstrate for justice"
and against injustice.
"We must believe in man even if it is in spite of man," he
said.
Witness and teacher
Besides playing the role of witness, Wiesel assumed the
role of teacher, which he currently experiences as profes
sor of Jewish studies at City College of new York.
"Truth can be found in the marketplace," he pointed
out. illustrating his point by a Hasidic story, one of his
favorite modes of presentation. "Experience must en
hance knowledge, not replace it."
But "in order to rebel against knowledge," one must
"acquire it first," Wiesel told the students.
Kent State reminds us that "evil has more power than
good," Wiesel said. "One rifle is stronger than 100 books."
The university is supposed to be a battleground for books
and words, rather than National Guardsmen, he stated.
"Students see the past covered with ruins. You share
our fear, our anguish, our despair, and you ask questions
to which there can be no answer," Wiesel said.
Responsible for world
Bearing the responsibility for his generation, he added,
"we've done you an injustice," by destroying the world for
you. "Now you're responsible for it."
Me said that the "awesome questions" human beings are
confronted with today are, "What ideals can we explore?"
and "What examples can you follow?"
He offered an answer to this question by quoting from
some holocaust victims' notebooks which he is currently
reading and editing.
Though they "knew their turn would come to be thrown
into the flames, they felt the need to bear witness," Wiesel
pointed out.
They could have reacted by saying, "if this is man, we
want no part of him,' but they decided to become
"chroniclers for man."
Third-year law student Daniel Brenner, who organized
this year's lecture, recalled to the audience the events of
May 1970. when seven students were killed during cam
pus protests at Kent State University in Ohio and Jackson
State College in Mississippi following President Richard
Nixon's announcement of the decision to send U.S. troops
to Cam bod in
