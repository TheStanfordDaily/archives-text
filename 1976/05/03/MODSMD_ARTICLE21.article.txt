# Cal sprints to 95-50 win over trackmen
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
Long on performances, but
short on points, the Stanford
track squad suffered a 95-50
thrashing by Cal's Golden Bears
Saturday in the 82nd Big Meet at
Berkeley.
"The points were against us,
but the performances weren't,"
said Stanford coach Payton Jor
dan after the meet. Jordan said
the Bears, who evened the series
at 40-40-2 by winning for the
fifth year in a row, had "too
much depth for us."
California's depth was par
ticularly evident in the sprints
where the Bears finished one
two in the 100, 200 and 400
meters, and the 110 meter inter
mediate hurdles.
And Cal began the meet by
running a season best of 40.3 to
blank the Robber Barons in the
400 meter relay. "They beat us in
the short events," said Jordan.
Senior Tony Sandoval was
Stanford's only redemption in
the running events Saturday,
winning the 1500 meters with a
lifetime best of 3:47.6.

Later Sandoval was called on
to run his first open 800 since
high school. He ran a brilliant
1:51.2, another lifetime best,
only to finish second to Cal's
Cirilo Morgan (1:51.0). It was
Sandoval's first defeat this sea
son.
"Being undefeated is neat,
but it's not significant," said
Sandoval, who was elected team
captain last Thursday. "1 was
pleased with the race. A 1:51.2 is
not a bad way to come into the
800," he said.
Jeff Parietti, who finished
third behind Sandoval with a
lifetime best of 3:50.2 in the
1500, came back to pick up sec
ond in the 5000 meters.
In the field events, the Barons
coupled the expected with the
unexpected. The expected were
James Lofton (24-3) remaining
undefeated in the long jump and
senior John Macrorie picking up
five points for the Barons with a
first place mark of 214-10 in the
javelin.
Lofton came back and jumped
a personal collegiate best of

47-10V4 to capture second in the
triple jump.
Kent Doyle, whose season up
to the Big Meet had been a few
6-4 high jumps and several no
heights, flopped 6-8 to take sec
ond behind Cal's Tom Murphy
who won on fewer misses.
Mark Hill (168-7) and Brad
Slinkard (152-6) finished one
two in the discus to give the Ba
rons their only eight point event.
