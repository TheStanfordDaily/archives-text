# Trojans win 2 of 3
## USC checks Card nine 
### Linda Buddenberg 
Mudville couldn't have been
much quieter than Sunken
Diamond yesterday afternoon,
after USC destroyed Stanford's
hope for a championship season.
The Cardinals had to win two
in order to stay alive in the
California Intercollegiate
Baseball Association (C1BA)
conference race, but only got one
on Saturday. 4-2, while coming
out second in Friday's game, G-4,
and in yesterday's contest. 7-0.
In Friday's game, Stanford bat
ters came up with four runs, but
that wasn't enough, as starting
pitcher Brian Harrison and re
liever Bruce Davis gave up six.
Ten hits
The Cards had 10 hits, includ
ing two each by Cary Pitchford,
Tom Cuardino, Kevin Triggs
and Bruce Walters.
On Saturday, 850 fans saw the
payoff resulting from some Car
dinal shuffling by coach Ray
Young — a new starting pitcher
and a changed lineup.
Senior Bernie Hittner, de
scribed by Young as currently
the hottest member of the pitch
ing staff, was pulled out of the
bullpen to start and responded
by limiting the Trojans to two
runs on.seven hits.
Hittner said he wanted to
make the most of his chance to
start.
"I like to start," he said Satur
day, "That's where all the star
dom is."

Helping Hittner with their
bats were infielders Pitchford
and Guardino, each with two
hits. Pitchford drew applause
from the crowd for sparkling
fielding plays.
Pitchford also earned the
dubious distinction of hitting
into his second triple play of the
season.
"I can't believe it,"he said. "1
must be leading the world in tri
ple plays."
Sunday's game saw the Cards
left helpless against Trojan
pitcher Ernie Mauritson, as Stan
ford was shut out, 7-0.
'Fine slider'
"Mauritson took the bat right
out of our hands," said Young.
"He especial ly had a fine slider."
While Stanford bats were kept
quiet, the Trojans got to Stanford
early, as they shelled starter
Mike Williamson for four runs in
the second inning. Bruce Fiala
and Rob Irwin came in to finish

after Williamson was taken out
in the second inning.
Young said he doesn't think
that the Cards will let the disap
pointing weekend bother them
tor their remaining six league
games.
"They'll pull right back," he
said.
