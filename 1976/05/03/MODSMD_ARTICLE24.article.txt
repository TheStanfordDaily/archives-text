# Men netters coast, shut out California

### Paul Bauman 
Fortunately for the Stanford
men's tennis team, its 9-0 victory
over California Friday on the
Varsity Courts just about con
cludes the dual match season.
The Cards do play UC-Davis
Thursday at home, but coach
Dick Gould said he will keep his
top four players out of the Aggie
match.
It seems to be that poi nt in the
season, after the big USC and
UCLA matches and before the
NCAAs* where tennis gets a bit
old. And it showed at times
against Cal.
It took Mark Mitchell one set
and a discussion with Gould to
get going before he beat Steve
Pompan, 3-6, 6-1, 6-1.
Bill Maze, playing first singles
while Pat DuPre took the day off,
had trouble returning any serve
in the beginning of his match
with Steve Hahn and squeaked
by in the first set, 6-4. Maze
looked sharper in the second set
and, with the help of his big
serve and some sharply-angled
volleys, took the match, 0-4, 6-2.
In first doubles, between Matt

Mitchell and Perry Wright of
Stanford and Ilahn and John
Hubbell, rackets and profanities
were flying through the air as
often as tennis balls. Mitchell
and Wright prevailed on the
scoreboard, 7-5, 6-3.
"It's tough to play this time of
year," Gould said. "The guys get
tired and down. I'm glad to have
(this match) behind us."
"Some of us are over
tennised," Matt Mitchell said.
"Me . .my brother .. .
Perry ..."
Next on the Cards' schedule is
the Cal State Championships
this week at Pebble Beach.
