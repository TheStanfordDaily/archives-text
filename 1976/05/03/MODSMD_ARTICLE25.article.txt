Black caucus quizzes candidates
CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Four Democratic presiden
tial contenders, striving for support yesterday at the
Black Democratic Caucus, refusfed to say flatly they
would push for a black as a vice presidential candi
date.
Former Georgia Cov. Jimmy Carter, Sen. Frank
Church (D-Idaho), Kep. Morris Udall (D-Ariz.) and
California Gov. Edmund Brown appeared together
to answer questions from the caucus.
No similar invitation was extended to Alabama
Cov. George Wallace.
All the candidates were pitching for a share of the
nation's black vote, estimated by caucus Chairman
Basil Patterson of New York at nearly eight million.
The candidates were asked by Richard Hatcher,
mayor of Gary, Ind., whether they would encourage
the selection of a black as the party's vice presiden
tial candidate.
Udall responded that "America is ready for a
black vice president," but said he would make no
flat commitment, a position endorsed by the other
candidates.
Responding to a question on whether they sup
port court-ordered busing for school integration,
the candidates varied somewhat.
Carter limited his support to voluntary busing
but he advocated "heavy emphasis on black leader
ship" in schools.
Brown, who said the president has to provide
moral leadership, said he advocates "full enforce
ment of court orders." Church gave a similar ans
wer, saying it is "up to the president to enforce the
laws."
Udall said he would support busing as a means of
integration but he would limit it as much as possi
ble.
California GOP groups reject Reagan
LOS ANGELES — Ronald Reagan's presidential
campaign was resoundinglyrejected by two grass
roots California Republican groups yesterday.
The moderate California Republican League
(CRL) rejected the former governor for being too far
right on the political spectrum. The conservative
United Republicans of California opposed Presi
dent Gerald Ford and Reagan calling them both
"highly socialistic."
CRL delegates also overwhelmingly endorsed
former Lt. Gov. Robert Finch for the GOP nomina
tion for the U.S. Senate seat now held by Democrat
JohnTunney, with former San Francisco State Pres
ident S.I. Hayakawa running a distant second.

Commerce Secretary Elliott Richardson was the
CRL's top choice for vice president, followed by
San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson.
Others receiving vice presidential votes were
Howard Baker, Edward Brooke, John Connally,
Charles Percy and Betty Ford.
Phil Ashey, head of the Stanford chapter of the
CRL, said he cast 10 votes for the chapter at the
convention. Ford received nine of the presidential
votes, while Reagan got one. All ten senatorial
votes went to Finch, he said.
Vote expected on election funds bill
WASHINGTON — Their campaign treasuries
running dry, presidential candidates hope Con
gress and the president will turn the flow of public
funds back on this week.
After weeks of haggling among themselves and
with the White House, Congress expects to com
plete action early in the week on a compromise
Federal Election Commission bill.
President Gerald Ford does not like the com
promise bill and may veto it.
But some Republicans, including Sen. Mark Hat
field of Oregon, who worked on the compromise,
have advised the President the bill could have been
a lot worse.
Hatfield called the compromise "the best we can
get under the circumstances" and said he would
urge Ford to sign it.
Italians begin election campaign
ROME — With parliament dissolved and elec
tions set for June, Italy yesterday began what outgo
ing Premier Aldo Moro called "an alarming pause"
— a seven-week campaign period likely to aggra
vate economic ills and heighten political and social
tension.
Moro's Christian Democratic minority govern
ment, the 34th postwar administration, fell Friday
night. President Giovanni Leone dissolved parlia
ment Saturday and ordered new elections a year
ahead of schedule.
Cabinet officials, acting as a caretaker govern
ment, are to meet today to set a date for elections,
which sources say will be June 20.
The campaign promises to be bitter, with the
Marxist coalition of the Communists, Socialists and
far-left splinter groups expected to pick up enough
votes to give the Communists a formal role in the
government for the first time since 1948.

Saturday, extreme leftists clashed with police in
downtown Rome and near the Vatican with
firebombs that drew tear gas volleys, leaving 20
slightly injured and leading to 40 arrests.
200 killed in Beirut fighting
BEIRUT, Lebanon — A leftist Moslem militia
group claimed it had taken strategic control of
Beirut's port area from Christian forces yesterday,
as continued heavy fighting and rocket, mortar and
artillery barrages rocked the divided capital.
Police reported more than 200 persons killed
since heavy fighting flared Friday night, after parli
ament postponed election of a new president until
next Saturday.
The Ambushers, the largest militia in the Moslem
alliance, said it occupied an officeand a bank build
ing t hat gives the leftists strategic control of the port
area, a major objective since they forced the Christ
ians out of the seaside hotel district last week.
The group said leftist forces were regrouping for
a "largescale attack to complete their control of the
area."
