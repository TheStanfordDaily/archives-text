# Reagan wins crucial victory
## 
### Bruce Kadden News Analysis 
Former California Gov. Ronald
Reagan recorded a crucial landslide
victory over President Gerald Ford in
the Texas primary Saturday, winning
all of the state's 96 delegates and gain
ing the momentum needed to carry
him through the rest of the primaries,
if not to the convention nomination.
On the Democratic side, former
Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter won 93 of
the 98 delegates up for grabs. Coming
on the heels of the news that two of his
strongest challengers, Sen. Hubert
Humphrey (D-Minn.) and Sen. Henry
"Scoop" Jackson (D-Wash.). were
withdrawing from active campaign
ing, this victory indicated Carter has a
firm hold on the presidential nomina
tion.
Reagan enjoyed support throughout
the state, actually winning in 24 sepa
rate district primaries, unofficially
gathering about 64 percent of the

popular vote.
He apparently drew a substantial
amount of support from conservative
Democrats who have supported
Alabama Gov. George Wallace in the
past. Wallace did more poorly than
was expected on the Democratic side.
Higher GOP turnout
Texans do not register by party and
the state had never held a presidential
primary before. However, the number
if Republican ballots cast in other
races indicated a substantially higher
GOP turnout than usual.
Reagan's victory moved him to
within 47 delegates of Ford, 283-236.
However, the incumbent will probably
receive most of the 329 currently un
committed delegates. The Republi
cans must choose 1411 more delegates
before the Kansas City convention.
Reagan's second primary win, the
first coming in North Carolina, was his
most important. A loss in Texas un
doubtedly would have meant the end
of his campaign. Even a narrow win
would have cast doubts on his ability
to challenge Ford.
But this win gives Reagan momen
tum going into this week's primaries
in Alabama, Georgia. Indiana and
Washington, D.C.
He is leading polls in the first two
states, while Indiana should be an im
portant dogfight. Ford is running un
opposed in the nation's capital and
will win its 14 delegates.
Indiana
Ford, who has beaten Reagan five
times and has won twice unopposed,
now must win in Indiana, or he could
start on a downhill slide that may lead
out the door of 1600 Pennsylvania Av
enue.
Carter, meanwhile, continued to
prove unbeatable, losing only five de
legates to Texas' favorite son, Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.). Carter in
creased his delegate total to 447, more
than twice as many as Jackson, who
dropped out of active campaigning for

the presidency Saturday.
Jackson, who was not on the Texas
ballot, said he would remain a candi
date but cited shortages of money and
votes for his decision to stop cam
paigning. Jackson has 196 delegates,
most coming from his victory in Mas
sachusetts.
Rep. Morris Udall (D-Ariz.). the
only original Carter challenger still
campaigning besides Wallace, is third
in delegate totals with 175. Wallace is
fourth with 113, while 242 remain un
committed.
Carter's one-sided victory in Texas
won't be his only happy moment this
week. He takes on Wallace in Alabama
and Udall in Washington, D.C., in two
primaries which should test Carter's
strength among both conservative and
liberal voters.
Carter should also have easy vic
tories in Indiana, where he goes
against Jackson, and in his home state.
In other primaries this weekend, an
uncommitted slate headed by
Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards won
15 delegates to 10 for Carter and seven
for Wallace.
Republicans selected 20 supposedly
uncommitted delegates to the GOP
convention in Maine, but 13 of them
indicated that they supported Ford.
While Ford and Reagan battle it out
across the country, Carter continues to
take on all comers, having entered

every primary. With Humphrey on the
sidelines, awaiting the outcome of the
primary campaigns, attention shifts tf.
California Gov. Jerry Brown.
Brown is on the ballot in California,
Nevada and Maryland, the last only
because the Secretary of State put his
name on the list of Democratic conten
ders.
It is doubtful that Brown or anyone
else can stop Carter. Brown's best"
chance, of course, is in his home state,
but since the winner-take-all format
has been abandoned here in favor of
separate Democratic district races, he
will probably win only in southern
California,where he is strongest.
