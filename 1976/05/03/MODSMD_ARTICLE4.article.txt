# Prof doubts IBM security system
## Computer guard soon obsolete? 
### Steve Schiller 
A computer security system prop
osed by the National Bureau of Stan
dards (NBS) tor government and pri
vate computers has "planned obsoles
cence" built into it and will be ren
dered "totally insecure" within 10
years, according to Assoc. Electrical
Engineering Prof. Martin Hellman.
The system, originated at Interna
tional Business Machines (IBM), must
be approved by the secretary of com
merce before becoming a required
standard for most federal agencies and
a de facto standard for private users.
The system, or "key." is composed
of 56 binary digits (zeros and ones)
arranged at random, allowing for
about 100 million billion possible
combinations, according to Hellman.
By inserting the key in an encoding
computer program called an "al
gorithm," a computer user can send
and receive information. Any other
key will produce a meaningless re
sponse.
'Breaking' the key
Although the only known way to
break such a key is by trial and error,
Hellman said a specially designed
computer could try all possible com

binations and break any given key in
only "half a day."
Presently, such a computer would
cost approximately $20 million, a price
I lellman said is probably too high tor a
private firm to invest in stealing rivals'
secrets, but not high enough to prevent
the National Security Agency (NSA)
and the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) from seeking computer-stored
information on private citizens.
"Today NSA could break it, but no
body else could," he said.
Moreover, by 1986. "our $20 million
machine will cost approximately
$200,000 and be within reach of any
large organization," I lellman said.
With such a device, an organization
could read data from both increasingly
large domestic storage banks and data
from foreign computer networks tied
into U.S. systems, he said.
1 lellman and graduate student Whit
field Diffie, who have been research
ing encoding systems, advocate ex
panding the k.ey up to 128 binary di
gits. In addition, they favor varying the
number of digits in different keys,
making simple random selection
much more difficult.
Code-solving cost
Such a standard would push the cost
of solving a single code out of the
range of both business and govern
ment, Hellman said.
However, he said NSA has an in
terest in preventing the adoption of a
"publicly known" unbreakable code,
which would make it more difficult to
tap computer memories.
A common outlook between the
NSA and theNBS — the latter employs
several former NSA employes — is an
additional factor in the insecurity of
the 56-digit system, according to
Hellman and Diffie.
If the key were enlarged to 64 in
stead of the proposed 56 digits, some
additional security would be pro
vided, the two men admit. The cost of
key-breaking machinery for a 64-digit
code would be about $5 billion.
However, they said, expected
technological advances would reduce
these figures to $50 million in 10 years,
a price within the range of the gov
ernment agencies.

key-breaking machinery for a 64-digit
code would be about $5 billion.
However, they said, expected
technological advances would reduce
these figures to $50 million in 10 years,
a price within the range of the gov
ernment agencies.
A computer security system prop
osed by the National Bureau of Stan
dards (NBS) tor government and pri
vate computers has "planned obsoles
cence" built into it and will be ren
dered "totally insecure" within 10
years, according to Assoc. Electrical
Engineering Prof. Martin Hellman.
The system, originated at Interna
tional Business Machines (IBM), must
be approved by the secretary of com
merce before becoming a required
standard for most federal agencies and
a de facto standard for private users.
The system, or "key." is composed
of 56 binary digits (zeros and ones)
arranged at random, allowing for
about 100 million billion possible
combinations, according to Hellman.
By inserting the key in an encoding
computer program called an "al
gorithm," a computer user can send
and receive information. Any other
key will produce a meaningless re
sponse.
'Breaking' the key
Although the only known way to
break such a key is by trial and error,
Hellman said a specially designed
computer could try all possible com

binations and break any given key in
only "half a day."
Presently, such a computer would
cost approximately $20 million, a price
I lellman said is probably too high tor a
private firm to invest in stealing rivals'
secrets, but not high enough to prevent
the National Security Agency (NSA)
and the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) from seeking computer-stored
information on private citizens.
"Today NSA could break it, but no
body else could," he said.
Moreover, by 1986. "our $20 million
machine will cost approximately
$200,000 and be within reach of any
large organization," I lellman said.
With such a device, an organization
could read data from both increasingly
large domestic storage banks and data
from foreign computer networks tied
into U.S. systems, he said.
1 lellman and graduate student Whit
field Diffie, who have been research
ing encoding systems, advocate ex
panding the k.ey up to 128 binary di
gits. In addition, they favor varying the
number of digits in different keys,
making simple random selection
much more difficult.
Code-solving cost
Such a standard would push the cost
of solving a single code out of the
range of both business and govern
ment, Hellman said.
However, he said NSA has an in
terest in preventing the adoption of a
"publicly known" unbreakable code,
which would make it more difficult to
tap computer memories.
A common outlook between the
NSA and theNBS — the latter employs
several former NSA employes — is an
additional factor in the insecurity of
the 56-digit system, according to
Hellman and Diffie.
If the key were enlarged to 64 in
stead of the proposed 56 digits, some
additional security would be pro
vided, the two men admit. The cost of
key-breaking machinery for a 64-digit
code would be about $5 billion.
