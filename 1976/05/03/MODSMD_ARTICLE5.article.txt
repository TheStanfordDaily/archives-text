# Cal-Stanford 'Voltaire' competition
## Debaters argue SST 
### Ron Beck 
Tomorrow's Voltaire debate is the
first step in what Stanford Debate
Union President John Roos calls "re
storing interest in the art of debate."
The Voltaire, sponsored by the Al
liance Francaise of San Francisco, for
the past 81 years, matches two Stan
ford students and two UC-Berkeley
students in a discussion of topics per
tinent to French and U.S. governmen
tal policies.
This year's topic is "Resolved: That
the Concorde should not be allowed
scheduled landings in the United
States." The debate begins at 8 p.m. in
Cubberley Auditorium.
Each Stanford debater will team
with a Cal debater on opposite sides of
the question. Only one student of the
four will be pronounced winner. The
Meduille Voltaire will go to him and
the overall victory will go to his

school.
Cal holds a 41-40 lead over Stanford
in the competitions (known until last
year as the Joffre debates).
Roos and Jim Wagstaffe, a sopho
more communication major, will rep
resent Stanford in the debate. Both
have been preparing separately for the
last month, since they will be taking
different sides in the debate.
Detailed research
"We've had to research almost every
imaginable point that deals with the
Concorde," says Roos. "It's impossible
to predict exactly what the opposing
team will come up with, so we've had
to cover all ground."
Roos says that he is used to the
painstaking research involved in the
preparation for debate.
"After a few seasons of intercol
legiate debate, you have some idea of
what arguments are likely to be pre
sented,"he says.
"1 have tremendous confidence in
John and Jim," says Dan Meek, director
of Stanford forensics and a second
year law student. "Both are know
ledgeable on the topic, have no prob
lems thinking on their feet, and are
accomplished speakers."
"They've come thr6ugh in the past,"
says Meek, "and I'm sure they'll come
through again."
Wagstaffe teaches 30 students in an
undergraduate special course on
forensics.
Roos, a junior political science
major, has debated every year here,
after three years of debate at Lowell
High School in San Francisco.
"Roos has almost single-handedly
revived debate at Stanford," Meek
says.
This quarter he is scheduled to
speak at various college campuses in
California on the nuclear initiative
(Proposition 15), based on research
that he and another student did earlier
this year.
Wagstaffe will argue the affirmative
side ot the resolution with Robert In
felise of Cal, while Roos will take the
negative with Cal's Enda Brennan.
According to Meek, the Voltaire is
the forerunner of a new style of Stan
ford debate.
"Because of a general lack of finan
cial support from the University, Stan

ford debate will emphasize publif
oriented debates like the Voltaire over
tournament-style debates." he says.
"Although the Voltaire is basically
an individual competition," says
Roos, "if either Jim or I win, I'll lie
satisfied. Whatever it takes to re-attract
the interest of Stanford students (in
debate) is worth it."

this year.
Wagstaffe will argue the affirmative
side ot the resolution with Robert In
felise of Cal, while Roos will take the
negative with Cal's Enda Brennan.
According to Meek, the Voltaire is
the forerunner of a new style of Stan
ford debate.
"Because of a general lack of finan
cial support from the University, Stan

ford debate will emphasize publif
oriented debates like the Voltaire over
tournament-style debates." he says.
"Although the Voltaire is basically
an individual competition," says
Roos, "if either Jim or I win, I'll lie
satisfied. Whatever it takes to re-attract
the interest of Stanford students (in
debate) is worth it."

Tomorrow's Voltaire debate is the
first step in what Stanford Debate
Union President John Roos calls "re
storing interest in the art of debate."
The Voltaire, sponsored by the Al
liance Francaise of San Francisco, for
the past 81 years, matches two Stan
ford students and two UC-Berkeley
students in a discussion of topics per
tinent to French and U.S. governmen
tal policies.
This year's topic is "Resolved: That
the Concorde should not be allowed
scheduled landings in the United
States." The debate begins at 8 p.m. in
Cubberley Auditorium.
Each Stanford debater will team
with a Cal debater on opposite sides of
the question. Only one student of the
four will be pronounced winner. The
Meduille Voltaire will go to him and
the overall victory will go to his

school.
Cal holds a 41-40 lead over Stanford
in the competitions (known until last
year as the Joffre debates).
Roos and Jim Wagstaffe, a sopho
more communication major, will rep
resent Stanford in the debate. Both
have been preparing separately for the
last month, since they will be taking
different sides in the debate.
Detailed research
"We've had to research almost every
imaginable point that deals with the
Concorde," says Roos. "It's impossible
to predict exactly what the opposing
team will come up with, so we've had
to cover all ground."
Roos says that he is used to the
painstaking research involved in the
preparation for debate.
"After a few seasons of intercol
legiate debate, you have some idea of
what arguments are likely to be pre
sented,"he says.
"1 have tremendous confidence in
John and Jim," says Dan Meek, director
of Stanford forensics and a second
year law student. "Both are know
ledgeable on the topic, have no prob
lems thinking on their feet, and are
accomplished speakers."
"They've come thr6ugh in the past,"
says Meek, "and I'm sure they'll come
through again."
Wagstaffe teaches 30 students in an
undergraduate special course on
forensics.
Roos, a junior political science
major, has debated every year here,
after three years of debate at Lowell
High School in San Francisco.
"Roos has almost single-handedly
revived debate at Stanford," Meek
says.
This quarter he is scheduled to
speak at various college campuses in
California on the nuclear initiative
(Proposition 15), based on research
that he and another student did earlier
this year.
Wagstaffe will argue the affirmative
side ot the resolution with Robert In
