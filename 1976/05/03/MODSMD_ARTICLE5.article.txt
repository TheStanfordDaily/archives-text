# Cal-Stanford 'Voltaire' competition
## Debaters argue SST 
### Ron Beck 
Tomorrow's Voltaire debate is the
first step in what Stanford Debate

school.
Cal holds a 41-40 lead over Stanford
in the competitions (known until last
year as the Joffre debates).
Roos and Jim Wagstaffe, a sopho

Concorde," says Roos. "It's impossible
to predict exactly what the opposing
team will come up with, so we've had

painstaking research involved in the
preparation for debate.
"After a few seasons of intercol
legiate debate, you have some idea of
