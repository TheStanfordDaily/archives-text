Veiled threats
In three years at Stanford I've
grown increasingly numb to the
inanity, arrogance and irration
ality which regularly coalesce
into Daily editorials. Today's
unsigned edit, ("Students' pro
test"), however, was enough to
stir me from my slumber.
The editorial board uses a re
mote incident at Spelman Col
lege in Georgia as a lead-in to a
barely veiled threat to lock up
the Stanford Board of Trustees
should that body have the audac
ity not to allow student member
ship.
The representation question is
one over which reasonable per
sons might differ. But the pomp
ous, snide tone of the editorial
must be universally repulsive,
no matter how obstinate one may
conceive the board to be.
The Daily ought to be
ashamed about this one.

The Daily's April 29 editorial
entitled "Students protest"
prompts me to ask a question. If
no provision is made for member
ship of students on the Board of
Trustees, will the Spelman Col-

lege tactic be adopted and the
trustees be locked in their meet
ing room until they grant the
demands of the student mem
bers?
If it is the generally accepted
view of students (and I dearly
hope it is not) that to "listen seri
ously" to their opinion means
necessarily to agree with them,
as the editorial implies, this
seems to me to provide yet
another reason for not having
students on the Board of Trus
tees — paticularly when the con
sequences of not adopting that
line of reasoning is to open one
self up to imprisonment in the
meeting room until one does.
This is not the first occasion in
which the Daily has advocated
violence as a means to bring
about change when other means
have failed. It is still a shame.

Union usurpation
Naivete about the nature of
labor unions is beginning to
evaporate at Stanford as United
Stanford Employees (USE) be
gins to flex its muscles as "the"
bargaining agent for some 1500

workers.
When the Stanford-USE con
tract was signed there were
many people (department heads
among them) who did not realize
that the proposed agreement
would require all workers to pay
union dues. Now it appears that
University officials were naive
in believing union negotiators
on the definition of membership.
The union wants to force all
old as well as all new workers in
the bargaining unit to become
full members in the union. The
fact that this would violate the
contract as understood by the
union, by the University, by
union members and by non
union workers in the unit does
not deter USE.
The fact that there are a few
(how many?) people who do not
want, under any circumstances,
to join this union does not im
press union officials. Matters of
personal conscience are in con
flict with the path to greater
union power.
The union is attempting to
gain more power than the work
ers would voluntarily give to it.
It is unfortunate that Califor
nia does not have a "right to
work" law. Such a law would
make it illegal to fire someone
for refusing to join a union.
In states with such laws, un
ions tend to have only as much
power as workers are willing to
give to them.

Program applications
Applications for membership
on the Tresidder Program Board
are now available to students.
Our goal is to make Tresidder
a real community center — an
area for the expression of a wide
variety of ideas and interests.
The Program Board will have a
major role in this effort. Our suc
cess in the past has been based
upon the active involvement of
students.
Responsibilities will include
all programming functions at
Tresidder Union.
It wi 11 be a working board, not
just an advisory one.
The members will actively
participate in the initiation, or
ganization, execution and
evaluation of all aspects of prog
ramming. Rick Redman
