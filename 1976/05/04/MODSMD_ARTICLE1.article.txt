# SF supervisors plan to sue unions

### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — City
supervisors moved yesterday to sue
striking unions for sabotage while of
ficials called attention to new victims
of the 34 day wage dispute —
thousands of dying young trees.
The Board of Supervisors unanim
ously voted to direct the city attorney
to file a civil suit for money damages
against "individuals or entities caus
ing damage to city property."
Board president Quentin Kopp said
the suit stems from strike-related dam
age to water pipes, phone and compu
ter cables and negligence of city
facilities, such as the golf course,
"which may have to be rebuilt because
of illegal picketing."
Supervisors also noted that some
water may be polluted because city
pickets barred delivery of chemicals to
sewage treatment plants.
Lack of care
At first the only obvious impact of
the strike by 1800 city tradesmen was
the lack of public transit. But as the
walkout dragged on its effect became
visible in the lack of care given city
parks, streets, zoos and buildings.
Brian Fewer, the city's superinten
dent of street landscaping, said some
10,000 young trees will die unless they
get water soon. He said the six-person
crew which normally is out on the
streets in three tanker trucks irrigating
these trees has been on strike since
March 31.
The 10 crafts unions walked off the
job five weeks ago when $5.7 million
in pay cuts were authorized by the
supervisors.
Public transit was idled when driv
ers honored the picket lines.
Playing hooky
Some 10,000 junior and senior high
school students rely on public buses to
get to school,and school officials have
become increasingly worried by the
drop in attendance with only six
weeks of the term remaining.
As frustration mounted in many
quarters over the drawn out dispute,
former Mayor Joseph Alioto broke a
self-imposed ban on comments on city
affairs by calling on his successor to
take a more active part in resolving the
strike.
"It seems to me that a hard negotia
tion with the mayor taking the lead
built around freezing present salaries
rather than reducing them is the way
out of this mess. It doesn't seem that

difficult," said Alioto, who settled a
police-firemen strike last August by
invoking emergency powers.
Meanwhile, a court ban on the pic
keting activities of 285 striking Golden
Gate Transit District bus drivers was
lifted yesterday, opening the door to
union escalation of the 22 day old
walkout.
Picketing bus drivers snarled traffic
on the Golden Gate Bridge last month
and halted service at the district-run
Sausalito ferry until stopped by the
court order.
Cecil Heden, secretary-treasurer of
Amalgamated Transit Union Local
1225, said there would be no escala
tion of the strike today, "but after that, 1
can't say."

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — City
supervisors moved yesterday to sue
striking unions for sabotage while of
ficials called attention to new victims
of the 34 day wage dispute —
thousands of dying young trees.
The Board of Supervisors unanim
ously voted to direct the city attorney
to file a civil suit for money damages
against "individuals or entities caus
ing damage to city property."
Board president Quentin Kopp said
the suit stems from strike-related dam
age to water pipes, phone and compu
ter cables and negligence of city
facilities, such as the golf course,
"which may have to be rebuilt because
of illegal picketing."
Supervisors also noted that some
water may be polluted because city
pickets barred delivery of chemicals to
sewage treatment plants.
Lack of care
At first the only obvious impact of
the strike by 1800 city tradesmen was
the lack of public transit. But as the
walkout dragged on its effect became
visible in the lack of care given city
parks, streets, zoos and buildings.
Brian Fewer, the city's superinten
dent of street landscaping, said some
10,000 young trees will die unless they
get water soon. He said the six-person
crew which normally is out on the
streets in three tanker trucks irrigating
these trees has been on strike since
March 31.
The 10 crafts unions walked off the
job five weeks ago when $5.7 million
in pay cuts were authorized by the
supervisors.
Public transit was idled when driv
ers honored the picket lines.
Playing hooky
Some 10,000 junior and senior high
school students rely on public buses to
get to school,and school officials have
become increasingly worried by the
drop in attendance with only six
weeks of the term remaining.
As frustration mounted in many
quarters over the drawn out dispute,
former Mayor Joseph Alioto broke a
self-imposed ban on comments on city
affairs by calling on his successor to
take a more active part in resolving the
strike.
"It seems to me that a hard negotia
tion with the mayor taking the lead
built around freezing present salaries
rather than reducing them is the way
out of this mess. It doesn't seem that

difficult," said Alioto, who settled a
police-firemen strike last August by
invoking emergency powers.
Meanwhile, a court ban on the pic
keting activities of 285 striking Golden
Gate Transit District bus drivers was
lifted yesterday, opening the door to
union escalation of the 22 day old
walkout.
Picketing bus drivers snarled traffic
on the Golden Gate Bridge last month
and halted service at the district-run
Sausalito ferry until stopped by the
court order.
Cecil Heden, secretary-treasurer of
Amalgamated Transit Union Local
1225, said there would be no escala
tion of the strike today, "but after that, 1
can't say."
