# Committee assistants necessary

In view of the article in the April 29 Daily
citing criticism of the present committee
staff assistants, I feel it is appropriate to
place a word of caution into the con
troversy. Because certain ASSU senators
feel that the present holders of that office
have abused the responsibilities of that pos
ition, this must not be construed as an attack
on the role of the staff assistant itself.
The position was first recommended by
an ad hoc ASSU Committee on University
Committees composed of then-ASSU Vice
President Beth Garfield, then-Nominations
Committee member Margie Shuer and
then-Senators Rocky Barber, 800 Bacon and
myself. After reviewing student involve
ment on University committees, we con
cluded that an office should be established
as a liaison between elected ASSU officials
and students on University committees.
The following year, the Council of Presi
dents (COP) established such an office.
Review duties
It is perhaps timely to review what the
recommended duties of the committee staff
assistant were as specified by the ad hoc
committee. They included:
—to make sure thatall committees remain
filled. If a student resigns, that student will
be required to submit a letter of resignation
to the committee staff assistant and to the
appropriate administrators;

—to report to the senate at each meeting
on the issues and problems brought up in
committees;
—to publish a monthly newsletter on the
issues and problems being brought up in
committees, to be distributed to senators
and the general student body;
—to maintain the files of minutes and
agendas in the ASSU office;
—to organize meetings between old and
new student members during the end of the
spring quarter; and
—to meet with each student group during
the beginning of fall quarter to discuss plans
for the year; senators and members of the
COP will be invited.
Deemed essential
Each of these duties was deemed essential
to the smooth functioning of student input
on all-important decision-making bodies
like the University committees. Each of
these duties remain essential.
One of the most criticized aspects of stu
dent government this year has been the se
nate. The primary reason for this criticism
has been the all-too-apparent impotence of
the body to effectively influence University
policy by its resolutions.
Here is a prime example of where an effec
tive committee staff assistant could guide
senate action to the appropriate students on
committees.

Recent articles in the Daily have con
tained criticism of one of the two curren|
committee staff assistants for his participa
tion in the writing of the so-called "Howard
Report," alleging that the primary function
of the report was the personal aggrandize
ment of its authors and that the committee
staff assistant should be above politics.
Remain depoliticized
For the staff assistant to remain de
politicized in those surroundings would re
quire either exceptional skill or total avoi
dance of the issues of the day. Rather than
judge the current staff assistants on their
activities external to their established
duties, senators should inquire into the per
formance of the responsibilities with which
the staff assistants were originally charged.
It is possible that senators who are critical
of the present holders of the office may wish
to alter or clarify the duties of the post, or
perhaps they wil 1 wish to be more vigilant
in their selection this year of next year's staff
assistant, to insure someone more to their
liking.
What is truly important here is that the
position continue to be available to the stu
dents. It has an important function in the
workings of student government, both in
and out of the ASSU office.
