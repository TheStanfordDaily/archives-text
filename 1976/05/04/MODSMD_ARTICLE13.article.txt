# Arguments against ERA not valid

I am writing in response to Mary
Schmitz's April 27 Daily column against
the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA).
The ERA says only: "Equality of rights
under the law shall not be denied or ab
ridged by the United States or by any state
on account of sex." That's all. No "taking
away" is implied, only extension of cer
tain rights now enjoyed by only one sex,
to cover both.
If, as Schmitz states, "the obligation of a
husband and father to support his wife
and children" is "the most important of
all women's rights," then the one-fourth
of all American households headed by
women are without this right, as are the
10,500,000 women who are single, and
the 9,800,000 who are widows.
A high estimate is that only 50 percent
of al 1 alimony awarded is ever paid — not
a very effective "right." How much better
for all these women if, instead of having
to depend on the benevolence of nonexis
tent or neglectful husbands, they had the

right to earn what a man does, thereby
relieving them of a dependence demean
ing to all concerned.
Still awarded
Alimony would still be awarded, but
only on the basis of each spouse's fi
nances and needs. If a woman has no in
come and cares for her children, a hus
band with income will contribute to her
and their support — and vice versa.
However, with the current under
employment and underpayment of wo
men, the former case is still likely to be
more common.
Drafting for combat duty is odious —
to either sex. That is why conscription
was done away with several years ago,
and it is not likely that the American
people wil 1 suffer to see it reinstated soon.
If a defense emergency should demand
conscription, why shouldn't all who
enjoy the nation's benefits — such as
commensurate pay and fair hiring prac

tices — fight for that nation? Israel, using
every available soldier, male and female,
has proven itself a power to be feared and
respected.
If women do, as is claimed by some,
possess a greater natural compassion and
more pacific instincts, perhaps their re
sponsible presence at all levels of our
volunteer armed forces will help to fore
stall the terrible spectre of war.
Customary awards
Until well into this century child cus
tody was customarily awarded to men,
just as it is customarily awarded to
women today. When the "award" of chil
dren is based on the needs and desires of
the children and not of the parents, and
when social conditions are such that
women are no longer at a financial disad
vantage or men at a psychological disad
vantage in caring for them, a truly just
system will have evolved.
Children are not commodities one has a

"right" to, but developing human beings
whose special needs have a right to pre
cedence at a time of divorce.
Since Schmitz feels that no more dis
crimination exists in education or credit,
and that that which does exist in
employment will not be alleviated by the
ERA, then at most it will be an impotent,
redundant law—rendering the vehe
mence of her and other stop-ERA groups
unnecessary and suspicious.
What is she so afraid of? The opportun
ity to work at a fulfilling career? To be
educated to her fullest capacity? If one is
afraid of any of these things, then don't do
them.
The ERA will not force any of these on
one, but will only permit those who do
want them the access which they would
have had, had they been born of the other
sex.
