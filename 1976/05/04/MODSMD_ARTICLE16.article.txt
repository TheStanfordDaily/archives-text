# Stanford leads USC in blood drive

### Carlin Chrisman 
With 1000 pints of blood to
USC's 650, Stanford leads the
competition between the two
schools to see who can donate
more blood to the Red Cross
Blood Drive.
"We're very pleased with the
results of the competition so
far," said Marilyn Coulson, local
Red Cross director of donor re
cruitment. "Stanford students
have always been generous in
donating their blood, but this
year the percentage of student
donors at Stanford is especially
high — 12 percent compared to
the nationwide figure of three
percent."
Bloodmobiles have given the
drive here a critical boost, she
commented.

"Most of the student participa
tion has come from the blood
mobiles, which are a new feature
in the blood drive this year," she
said. "Bloodmobile units are on
campus nearly every week,
which makes it much more con
venient for students to donate
blood."
She added that donors can
also come to the Red Cross Blood
Center at 3330 Hillview Ave. in
Palo Alto.
Coulson said there has been a
lot of student interest in the
Stanford-USC competition.
"The nurses at the blood
mobile units, especially, have
reported that students are asking
about Stanford's status in the
competition. They are happy to
hear that Stanford is way ahead,

even though USC is a much
larger school."
Beth Hesselmeyer, a senior in
psychology and local blood
drive chairman, explained the
blood giving process.
"The whole thing takes about
45 minutes to an hour, but only
5-7 minutes of that time is spent
actually giving blood," she said.
"First the donor registers and
answers some health questions
to determine if he or she is eligi
ble to donate. The nurses ask
about past diseases, medical his
tory, that sort of thing.
"Then the tube is attached and
450 milliliters, or a little less
than a pint, is taken," she said.
"After giving blood, the donor is
served cookies and juice in the
canteen and rests for about 15

minutes."
The blood collected is sent
immediately to the lab, where it
is separated into four compo
nents: plasma, platelets, cryo
precipitate factor and red blood
cells. "Each of these blood com
ponents goes to a different pa
tient at the Stanford Hospital
and Children's Hospital," said
Hesselmeyer, "so your donation
actually helps save four lives."
All blood donated at the Stan
ford Red Cross goes directly to
the Stanford Hospital and Chil
dren's Hospital.
"The hospitals use a tremend
ous amount of blood," Hessel
meyer related. ,"We are faced
with a continual blood crisis,
which is why it is so important
that we replenish our supplies."
