Is it true that a man can have VD and by symptom-free? If so, are
routine checkups advisable for someone who is sexually active?
Will Cowell perform them without a lot of moralistic hassle?
Both men and women can have venereal disease and, at various
times in the course of the disease, show no symptoms. However,
the disease is transmittable whether it has announced its presence
or not. Men can tell if they have VD by watching for the first stage
signs: a burning sensation during urination for gonorrhea or a
chancre on the shaft of the penis for syphilis.
Women, on the other hand, may not have any symptoms and
should have a checkup at least once a year if she is sexually active.
Yes, Cowell will help without hassles.

Can a virgin become pregnant? It seems that a virgin could play
around with sex, without actual intercourse, and still become
pregnant.
Yes, Virginia, immaculate conception can happen. It is possible,
although it certainly doesn't happen often, for a woman to become
pregnant without penetration. If her partner ejaculates outside the
vagina, it is possible for sperm deposited nearby to get inside,
travel up into the fallopian tubes and impregnate her. It is even
possible if she still has her hymen, since most hymens are not
completely solid.
