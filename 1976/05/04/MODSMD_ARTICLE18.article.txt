# 'Allah is angry' — so Beirut citizens fight battles
## 
### 
BEIRUT (FNS) — Ask people
here how they feel now, where
Lebanon stands, what its future
might be, and they point to the
orange-dust-colored sky, saying
"Allah ruddub" — Allah is
angry with us.
Lebanon has stepped beyond
the tolerable limits of civil strife.
Few here believe that their disin
tegrated society can soon
achieve long-term peace. Few
have hope that they will soon see
Allah's beneficence again.
Yet amid the fragility here,
hopes persists.
This is a turning point for
Lebanon. Parliament and Presi
dent Suleman Franjieh have
cleared the way for elections to
select a new president. Syria and
the Palestinians have reached
rapprochment on their differ
ences and are thus forcing the
Lebanese Left, which has had the
upper hand in the last round of
fighting, to accept another
Syria-sponsored ceasefire.
American and French
mediators are scurrying back

and forth between the opposing
parties trying out new ideas, lis
tening for a response and calling
for order. Perhaps most impor
tant has been the resurrection of
the tri-partite military com
mand, composed of leaders of
the leftist National Front, the
rightist Khatayeb (Phalangists)
and the Syrian-Palestinian al
liance.
Beirut is in a constant state of
alert. Its citizens listen atten
tively to every radio broadcast.
Radio Lebanon, BBC. Kol Israel
— all provide different parts to
the puzzle.
Government here collapsed
some six months ago. The rule of
the day is gun law. Yet power
and water are still operational
with some staggered cut-offs in
different neighborhoods. Sew
age, while never adequate, is
still flowing. Garbage is piling
up on the streets and people
burn it when they are able. While
it is impossible to reach a tele
phone operator, the automatic
exchange works and you can

dial the U.S. direct.
Banks are busy and open when
there are no artillery attacks.
There is a flourishing and color
ful commerce on the sidewalks
of the once-chic Rue Hamru.
The Lebanese pound is as strong
as ever.
With airports and essential
services open, borders open,
commerce active and cinemas
sanguinely displaying their ti
tles on marquees, the conflict
here offers a model for urban
survival in the midst of low-level
civil strife.
An American woman living
right below the combat-heavy
hotel section explained she felt
protected among her friendly
neighbors. Her neighborhood
was alive, full of purpose and
commitment. The solidiers —
leftists of three different persua
sions — were full of life and
exuded a sense of pride in their
cause.
The woman had just returned
from a wedding that she said was
joyous among the noises of war.

She, like many Americans and
other Westerners here, feels a
part of Beirut and doesn't want
to abandon it.
Since the guns of war erupted
over a year ago, some 20,000
people have given their lives to
their (and others') respective go
als. These goals are mutually
contradictory expressions of
what Lebanese life should be
like.
While undoubtedly compli
cated to the Westerner, the
Lebanese conflict is basically a
class conflict between the feudal
family power structure of the
traditional Arab world and the
growing majority sentiment for
democracy. While the majority's

vision ot democracy may be im
perfect by Western standards, it
is inevitable that the power ba
lance be redressed. The conflict
is only circumstantially a religi
ous one.
For the rightist (coinciden
tally Christian) Phalange and its
allies, the struggle is for the con
tinued survival of the autocratic,
anti-socialist, feudalist system
of banking and business. Its
leading spokesperson, Pierre
Gemayel, believes the Lebanese
crisis is the "result of the ac
tivities of the international left."
The so-called leftists are better
described by their own term
"National Front." While the
front is composed of myriad

groups of differing ideologies
ranging from advocates of a Gre
ater Syria to proponents of a
People's Republic of Lebanon,
they find their lowest common
denominator and most active
spokesperson in Kamal Jumblat,
leader of the Socialist-
Progressive party.
Westerners are often misled by
the party's title. While progres
sive and socialist by Lebanese
standards, it is characterized by
one American living in Beirut as
"ideologically within the
bounds of the American Repub
lican Party."
The third power center of the
conflict is Damascus, which has
traditional ties to Lebanon. Syria

has had to tread the delicate line
between angering the Israelis
(with its growing involvement)
and angering the Lebanese (as an
outside interventionist).
The final factor in the fighting
is the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization (PLO). While con
tributing much to the National
Front's advantage, the PLO finds
itself caught between loyalty to
reform in Lebanon and its strug
gle to establish a Palestinian
state.
While progress toward a polit
ical solution has taken its first
fragile steps forward, the deeper
question of how society itself
will be restructured here re
mains unanswered.
