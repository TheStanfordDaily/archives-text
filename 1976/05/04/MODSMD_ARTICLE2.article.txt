# Theta Xi leads move
## IFC members to oust Ottilie? 
### Jack Vaughn 
Members of the fraternity Theta Xi
will attempt to oust Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC) President Bob Ottilie at
tomorrow night's IFC meeting. The
move is prompted by a dispute con
cerning a letter Ottilie sent during the
recent ASSU Council of Presidents
(COP) election.
Dan Howard, a Theta Xi member
who headed the losing slate in the COP
election, said Ottilie sent a letter to
every fraternity except Theta Xi sup
porting the successful Vic Petroff slate
the night before the runoff election.
The letter concluded that "Vic Pet
roff believes in fraternities" and that
the Howard slate "has never taken a
stand" on fraternity issues.
"A lot of people from other frater
nities thought it was an IFC endorse
ment," Howard said, adding that
Theta Xi members were angered be
cause no letter was sent to their frater
nity.
Protest
In response, Theta Xi members have
sent letters to several fraternities pro
testing the Ottilie letter and calling for
his removal at this week's meeting.
Because Ottilie's term ends in three
weeks, Howard called the move "very
symbolic" and said he did not expect
the ouster to succeed.

Noting that there is no provision for
removing an IFC officer in the IFC con
stitution, Ottilie said he will entertain
only a motion to censure himself at the
meeting.
He said no letter was sent to Theta Xi
because he "assumed people in his
(Howard's) fraternity would support
him" and nothing could be gained
from sending a copy to the house.
Howard, however, said Theta Xi
members feel they have been slighted.
"The IFC president turned his back on
one of the IFC members, and the IFC
president can't do that," he said.
He also said Ottilie "abused his ti
tle" by signing the letter "Bob Ottilie,
IFC President."
'Relevant'
Ottilie said he signed the letter with
his title because "this is relevant to my
position" since it evaluated the views
of each slate on fraternities.
"The letter kind of ignores the fact
that I am a fraternity member," How
ard said.
He alluded to the split among frater
nities on issues such as this year's Big
Game Bonfire, when Theta Xi and
Sigma Alpha Epsilon opposed general
fraternity support for the event.
"Just because you're liberal, conser
vative or radical doesn't mean you

won't support your house," Howard
said.
"The letter was not an attack on Dan
Howard. It was an endorsement of Vic
Petroff," Ottilie claimed.
Theta Xi has contributed "almost
nil" to IFC projects this year, Ottilie
said. "I didn't mention the fact that
Dan was a member of a fraternity just
like I didn't mention the fact that he
spends half his time over at Columbae
(the non-violence theme house)."

SHOCKING STATEMENT—Emeritus Electrical Engineering Prof. William
Shockley, spurred on by former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter's famous
"ethnic purity" remarks, has proposed lie detector tests on major issues for all
presidential candidates. The Nobel laureate is shown here discussing his
controversial theories on intelligence and heredity.
Members of the fraternity Theta Xi
will attempt to oust Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC) President Bob Ottilie at
tomorrow night's IFC meeting. The
move is prompted by a dispute con
cerning a letter Ottilie sent during the
recent ASSU Council of Presidents
(COP) election.
Dan Howard, a Theta Xi member
who headed the losing slate in the COP
election, said Ottilie sent a letter to
every fraternity except Theta Xi sup
porting the successful Vic Petroff slate
the night before the runoff election.
The letter concluded that "Vic Pet
roff believes in fraternities" and that
the Howard slate "has never taken a
stand" on fraternity issues.
"A lot of people from other frater
nities thought it was an IFC endorse
ment," Howard said, adding that
Theta Xi members were angered be
cause no letter was sent to their frater
nity.
Protest
In response, Theta Xi members have
sent letters to several fraternities pro
testing the Ottilie letter and calling for
his removal at this week's meeting.
Because Ottilie's term ends in three
weeks, Howard called the move "very
symbolic" and said he did not expect
the ouster to succeed.

Noting that there is no provision for
removing an IFC officer in the IFC con
stitution, Ottilie said he will entertain
only a motion to censure himself at the
meeting.
He said no letter was sent to Theta Xi
because he "assumed people in his
(Howard's) fraternity would support
him" and nothing could be gained
from sending a copy to the house.
Howard, however, said Theta Xi
members feel they have been slighted.
"The IFC president turned his back on
one of the IFC members, and the IFC
president can't do that," he said.
He also said Ottilie "abused his ti
tle" by signing the letter "Bob Ottilie,
IFC President."
'Relevant'
Ottilie said he signed the letter with
his title because "this is relevant to my
position" since it evaluated the views
of each slate on fraternities.
"The letter kind of ignores the fact
that I am a fraternity member," How
ard said.
He alluded to the split among frater
nities on issues such as this year's Big
Game Bonfire, when Theta Xi and
Sigma Alpha Epsilon opposed general
fraternity support for the event.
"Just because you're liberal, conser
vative or radical doesn't mean you

won't support your house," Howard
said.
"The letter was not an attack on Dan
Howard. It was an endorsement of Vic
Petroff," Ottilie claimed.
Theta Xi has contributed "almost
nil" to IFC projects this year, Ottilie
said. "I didn't mention the fact that
Dan was a member of a fraternity just
like I didn't mention the fact that he
spends half his time over at Columbae
(the non-violence theme house)."
