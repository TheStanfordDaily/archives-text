## 'Blue Marine' an expressive flick 
### Howard Baldwin 
Sometimes the external ap
pearance of a film can be mis
leading, as is the case with Col
umbia Pictures' Buby Blue
Marine. It looks like an over
sweetened love story between
Jan-Michael Vincent and Glyn
nis O'Connor, set to the patriotic
backdrop of that last patriotic
war in 1943.
Actually, Buby Blue Murine
has far more depth and romance
than that. It is an expressive and
idyllic story taken past the ex
pected cliches into a never
neverland of an America that
never was but that we all secretly
tell ourselves actually must have
existed sometime. Buby Blue
Murine's America produced all
our heroes and must have
existed for the simple reason that
our heroes could never have
sprung from anything but purity.
It's a film about second
chances to prove oneself. Marion
Hedgepith, nicknamed Hedge
(Jan-Michael Vincent), washes
out of the Marines and is sent
home in the humiliating baby
blue outfits designed for shame.
Their name and the film's title
denote immediately the inno
cence suffusing it.
A soldier being shipped back
to the front forcibly trades un
iforms with Hedge, and the latter
is off, hitchhiking across the
country, living a lie but eventu
ally proving himself worthy
anyway.
Rockwell
The feeling of an America that
never was is heightened by a
prologue and epilogue of Nor
man Rockwell's paintings of
America during t he war. The last
scene, freezing into a Rockwell
panorama, provides the final fit
ting touch for a time that never
was and could never be.
The world of John Hancock's
exquisite film is one of pat
riotism when it still existed. It
may seem cliched, full of 1943
apple pie a la modes and hot
dogs, but because of a narration
from the present, it has 1976
shadows lurking about. A fellow
recruit of Hedge's (13. Kirby, Jr.)
is actually a voice from the
Vietnam-rotted future cynically
denying the fortitude of war.

The scene in which Hedge
simply but courageously tries to
help three Japanese-American
relocation-camp internees ac
ross a river glows with civil
rights. Baby Blue Murine isn't
the way it was — it's the way it
should have been. The film rep
resents rewritten history the way
we'd all like to see it, with sim
ple morality, justice, equality,
truth and honesty. It is a fantasy
as escapist and enlightening as a
trip down the yellow brick road.
Innocent
Everything and everyone is
innocent and uncorrupted. The
lovers never go further on screen
than a loving kiss. In a dream
like way, everything happens
the way it is supposed to in fan
tasies — making love in a field of
flowers below the magnificent
backdrop of the Rocky Moun
tains, the hard-working small
town girl whose family sings to
gether after dinner, whose pa
rents are still in love after 20
years.
Hedge tells a fearful mother
that he met her son on a chow
line in the South Pacific and that
he's fine and well-liked by his
company, when in reality Hedge
has never been out of the United
States. It is a lie, but it is a well
meaning and honorable one. The
perfect finishing touch would
have been to hear Art Garfunkel
singing his rendition of "Disney
Girls" on the soundtrack.
Hancock's direction and cast
ing is superb. Vincent and
O'Connor are the stereotypes of
sunshine, with his sandy locks
and her flowing curls. The
screenplay by Stanford Whit
more is humorous and imagina
tive in its witticisms, portraying
a life with laughter and tears per
fectly balanced, as life should be
(but rarely is).
The story is not so much as
important as what both it and the
characters within it represent —
what we've always wanted our
selves to be, but have never been
able to achieve. With nostalgic
sweetness, we can view Baby
Blue Marina and be content with
the knowledge that somewhere,
if only in fiction, fantasies do
come true.

THE WAY WE NEVER WERE—Jan-Michael Vincent and Glynnis O'Connor play two young people
who meet and fall in love at first sight in Hnhy Blue Marine, an enchanting fantasy about a world
that, like Shangri-La, is always searched for but never discovered.


EXPRESSIVE MYSTICISM—Armenian artist Yerchan Boghos

April. His works are motivated by eastern poems, essays, music

singing his rendition of "Disney
Girls" on the soundtrack.
Hancock's direction and cast
ing is superb. Vincent and
O'Connor are the stereotypes of
sunshine, with his sandy locks
and her flowing curls. The
screenplay by Stanford Whit
more is humorous and imagina
tive in its witticisms, portraying
a life with laughter and tears per
fectly balanced, as life should be
(but rarely is).
The story is not so much as
important as what both it and the
characters within it represent —
what we've always wanted our
selves to be, but have never been
able to achieve. With nostalgic
sweetness, we can view Baby
Blue Marina and be content with
the knowledge that somewhere,
if only in fiction, fantasies do
come true.

THE WAY WE NEVER WERE—Jan-Michael Vincent and Glynnis O'Connor play two young people
who meet and fall in love at first sight in Hnhy Blue Marine, an enchanting fantasy about a world
that, like Shangri-La, is always searched for but never discovered.


EXPRESSIVE MYSTICISM—Armenian artist Yerchan Boghos
sian displayed a varied collection of his works at Tresidder last
April. His works are motivated by eastern poems, essays, music

and folk dances. The collection has been exhibited extensively
through the Middle East and Europe.
Sometimes the external ap
pearance of a film can be mis
leading, as is the case with Col
umbia Pictures' Buby Blue
Marine. It looks like an over
sweetened love story between
Jan-Michael Vincent and Glyn
nis O'Connor, set to the patriotic
backdrop of that last patriotic
war in 1943.
Actually, Buby Blue Murine
has far more depth and romance
than that. It is an expressive and
idyllic story taken past the ex
pected cliches into a never
neverland of an America that
never was but that we all secretly
tell ourselves actually must have
existed sometime. Buby Blue
Murine's America produced all
our heroes and must have
existed for the simple reason that
our heroes could never have
sprung from anything but purity.
It's a film about second
chances to prove oneself. Marion
Hedgepith, nicknamed Hedge
(Jan-Michael Vincent), washes
out of the Marines and is sent
home in the humiliating baby
blue outfits designed for shame.
Their name and the film's title
denote immediately the inno
cence suffusing it.
A soldier being shipped back
to the front forcibly trades un
iforms with Hedge, and the latter
is off, hitchhiking across the
country, living a lie but eventu
ally proving himself worthy
anyway.
Rockwell
The feeling of an America that
never was is heightened by a
prologue and epilogue of Nor
man Rockwell's paintings of
America during t he war. The last
scene, freezing into a Rockwell
panorama, provides the final fit
ting touch for a time that never
was and could never be.
The world of John Hancock's
exquisite film is one of pat
riotism when it still existed. It
may seem cliched, full of 1943
apple pie a la modes and hot
dogs, but because of a narration
from the present, it has 1976
shadows lurking about. A fellow
recruit of Hedge's (13. Kirby, Jr.)
is actually a voice from the
Vietnam-rotted future cynically
denying the fortitude of war.

The scene in which Hedge
simply but courageously tries to
help three Japanese-American
relocation-camp internees ac
ross a river glows with civil
rights. Baby Blue Murine isn't
the way it was — it's the way it
should have been. The film rep
resents rewritten history the way
we'd all like to see it, with sim
ple morality, justice, equality,
truth and honesty. It is a fantasy
as escapist and enlightening as a
trip down the yellow brick road.
Innocent
Everything and everyone is
innocent and uncorrupted. The
lovers never go further on screen
than a loving kiss. In a dream
like way, everything happens
the way it is supposed to in fan
tasies — making love in a field of
flowers below the magnificent
backdrop of the Rocky Moun
tains, the hard-working small
town girl whose family sings to
gether after dinner, whose pa
rents are still in love after 20
years.
Hedge tells a fearful mother
that he met her son on a chow
line in the South Pacific and that
he's fine and well-liked by his
company, when in reality Hedge
has never been out of the United
States. It is a lie, but it is a well
meaning and honorable one. The
perfect finishing touch would
have been to hear Art Garfunkel
singing his rendition of "Disney
Girls" on the soundtrack.
