# At Keystone Korner in S.F.-
## Liebman plays fine sax 
### Dave Smith 
Dave Liebman, the soprano
saxophonist who brought his
band to the Keystone Korner in
San Francisco last week, has
learned at least one thing from
his former mentor, Miles Davis:
Me can play quite well with his
back to the audience.
But unlike Davis, Liebman
will never be accused of sullen
ness. The balding New Yorker,
clad in a denim jumpsuit for his
first Bay Area appearance since
he left Davis' band, gave a low
key but impressive performance
on the sweetest-sounding of all
saxophones.
Liebman's group, Lookout
Farm, is exceptionally steady
and restrained for an electric jazz
band. And Liebman, who first
gained a reputation for being
able to play John Coltrane

saxophone licks faster than Col
trane and the soprano sax faster
than anyone else alive, has set
tled into a mature style that goes
with the whole range of modern
jazz styles.
Liebman also played tenor sax
for a series of duets with Jim
Pepper, a special guest whom
Liebman introduced as "one of
my first inspirations on the
saxophone." The loud bluesy
style of Pepper, a gifted com
poser and leader of a small na
tive American jazz movement,
formed a pleasing contrast with
Liebman's softer and more
melodic playing.
Davis is obviously Liebman's
guiding musical influence, and
Lookout Farm offered a well
played selection of Miles' music
from recent pieces to "All
Blues," the 1958 composition.

While several of his contem
poraries from Davis' "On the
Corner" band, inluding Herbie
Hancock, Lonnie Liston Smith

and Carlos Garnett, have flirted
with musical mediocrity lately,
Liebman's music has been con
sistently well-played.


VOIJLEZ-VOUS?—Francoise Regnat will give a concert on Friday
at Tresidder. A N<nv York Times reviewer said: "Francoise Regnat
demure in appearance, was quite a firebrand at the keyboard,
reveling in sudden dynamic contrasts, fiery temperament, her
fingers scaling every technical hurdle with impetuous ease."
Tickets are $3.50, $3 for students.
