# Armenian art show redundant
## 
### Mary Anderson 
The Armenian artist Yerchan
Boghossian, who had an exhibit
of his oil paintings on Tresid
der's second floor and Art Room
during April, is motivated by
Eastern poetry, music and
dance. His works hint interest
ingly at exotica upon first
glance, but closer inspection re
veals a repetitiveness of style
and of subject matter which robs
a few of the works of their poten
tially stirring quality,
I le uses pastel and smoky hues
to render scenes of folkdancing,
mysticism and poetic creation.
Some interesting brushwork
implies wisps of smoke, wind or
incense. The eyes of his subjects
are clouded over to emphasize,
apparently, the profound qual
ities of the human soul over
physical reality.
The only painting, however,
which succeeds in evoking a
profound response from the
viewer is "The Poet," in which
Boghossian emphasizes the
poet's — or any artist's — crea
tive power, much akin to Clod's
creative force reflected in nature.
The show proceeds, though, to
display basically repetitious
versions of "The Poet," as well
as of "The Prophet of Omar
Khayyam," of folkdancersand of
women fondling deer. The show
not only becomes tiresome, but
the opening works quickly lose
their effect amid so much of the
same.
Commercialism
Combined with his slightly
gaudy color schemes, the re
petit iousness of his style and
motifs implies a kind of
production-line technique
aimed toward commercialism
rather than toward a pure art.
As the viewer proceeds
through the entire show, this re
dundancy also emphasizes trite
stereotypes. Boghossian's
"poets," always male, have a
bearded, God-like quality; they
wield their plumed pens vigor
ously over the stormy land
scapes. Man as a symbol of prim
ary creative power is firmly es
tablished.
Mystical
Woman, to Boghossian, repre
sents his more mystical and dxo
tic subjects. In many of his
works, women are akin with na
ture and are sexual images of
gentleness, of love, of suste
nance and of fantasy.
