Reagan gaining in South, Midwest
INDIANAPOLIS — The focus of the presiden
tial campaign today is directly on the Republi
cans as Ronald Reagan attempts to extend his
success in the J>un Belt to President Gerald
Ford's home ground in the Midwest.
Reagan's challenge for the Republican presi
dential nomination is tested again today in three
states, Georgia, Alabama and Indiana. The
former California governor is conceded a favo
rite's role in the two Southern primaries and a
reasonable chance in Indiana, where a month
ago Ford's polls showed him 25 percentage
points ahead.
Ford made a last-minute swing through In
diana and Alabama yesterday attacking
Reagan's plan to trim the federal budget and
continuing the debate over the Panama Canal, an
issue given credit for helping Reagan sweep
Texas' 96 delegates in the primary there on
Saturday.
Meanwhile, the 12-candidate free-for-all that
was once the Democratic race has become a case
of Jimmy Carter odds-on against the field. There
are Democratic primaries today in the same
three states and the District of Columbia but they
only stand to lengthen Carter's lead over his
scattered pursuers.
Carter picked up additional strength yester
day when he was endorsed by one of his
erstwhile rivals, Sen. Birch Bayh of Indiana.
Bayh noted that he is closer philosophically to
Rep. Morris Udall, but said Carter is the only
Democrat who can win in November.
Brown confident he has a chance
LAS VEGAS — California Gov. Edmund
Brown Jr. told 200 cheering Nevada supporters
yesterday that he wouldn't bother campaigning
if he didn't believe he could win the Democratic
nomination for president.
In his first appearance in Nevada, where he
will be on the May 25 presidential primary bal
lot, Brown told supporters he is a political re
former who has "been on the cutting edge of the
political issues" of recent years, such as Viet
nam, civil rights and political reform.
"I've tried in my own way as secretary of state
and as governor of California to bring a new
politics to California, and I'm now trying to
bring that to the nation," he said.
Brown rejected suggestions by reporters that
former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter has the

nomination all but locked up.
"If I didn't believe it were a real possibility to
win the nomination, I wouldn't be coming to
Maryland and Nevada and taking all the chances
I'm taking," he said.
Brown, who returned Sunday after five days of
campaigning in Maryland and North Carolina,
hits the campaign trail again tomorrow, with
four days of campaigning scheduled in Mary
land and another in Nevada.
Tax campaign funding may resume
WASHINGTON — The House approved and
sent to the Senate yesterday a bill to reconstitute
the Federal Election Commission and get cam
paign money flowing again to the presidential
candidates.
The House voted 291 to 81. The Senate hoped
to act quickly on the measure and send it to
President Ford.
But Ford still has not said whether he will veto
the bill — and even if he does not he has to
nominate six FEC commissioners and the Senate
has to confirm them before the checks can go
out.
The taxpayers' check-off campaign money
was cut off five weeks ago, March 22, under a
Supreme Court ruling that the FEC was a con
gressional commission and under the Constitu
tion's balance of powers doctrine could not con
duct executive duties like clearing the campaign
checks.
Congress' bill solves that problem by recon
stituting the FEC as an executive commission
with the commissioners appointed by the presi
dent.
However, Republican leaders have said Ford
might veto the bill primarily because they said it
is a pro-labor bill.
A major change would permit labor union
political committees to get contributions from
all members while corporation political com
mittees could get contributions only from execu
tives and their families.
Democratic backers said that change is only
fair since most corporate executives can contri
bute large sums to political committees while
labor union workers contribute only small
amounts.
Will Italians choose communism?
ROME — Italy's caretaker government yester

day set national elections for June 20-21, giving
the voters seven weeks to decide whether to
entrust their futures to the Christian Democrats
or turn to the Communists for leadership.
The elections, which come at a time of finan
cial gloom and violence, could give the Com
munists a role in the government of this NATO
ally for the first time since 1948.
The Communists are expected to make a
strong bid to extend the domain they already
have over most of Italy's major cities to Rome,
the Italian capital.
The election, a year earlier than scheduled,
was brought about by the collapse Friday of
Premier Aldo Moro's Christian Democrat minor
ity government. It was Italy's 34th government
since the end of World War 11.
In nationwide regional elections last June, the
Communists took a third of the votes, just two
percentage points behind the Christian Democ
rats. Since then, the country's economic climate
has declined rapidly and the Christian Democ
rats have been tainted by scandals related to
Lockheed payoffs and alleged CIA activity here.
The Communists and other leftists also hope
to gain from the granting of voting privileges to
18-year-olds in elections for the chamber of de
puties.
1976 Pulitzer Prizes awarded
NEW YORK — The Anchorage Daily News,
with a news staff of only 20, won the 1976
Pulitzer Prize for public service yesterday for its
major investigation of Teamster Union power
and impact on Alaska's economy and politics.
Two 1976 winners repeated earlier Pulitzer
victories — Gene Miller of the Miami Herald in
reporting and Paul Horgan in history.
Miller was cited in the 1976 awards for persis
tent and courageous general reporting over an
BV2-year span that led to the exoneration of two
men twice convicted and sentenced to death in
Florida for murder.
Hughes' will: Is it authentic?
HAWTHORNE, Nev. — Melvin Duramar, a
gasoline service station attendant named in the
purported will of Howard Hughes, was tried and
acquitted on a forgery charge here in 1969, au
thorities said yesterday.
Mineral County Dist. Atty. Larry Bettis said
Dummar was charged with fotging a $251
paycheck but the charge was later dropped.

Court actions are underway to determine the
authenticity of the will, found last Tuesday at
Mormon church headquarters in Salt Lake City.
The immediate task, said Attorney Harold
Rhoden, will be proving by chemical and hand
writing analysis that the will was indeed written
by Hughes on the date inscribed on it — March
19,1968.
But the attorney said, "I'm not sure that any
one is going to contend it is not Howard Hughes'
handwriting."
He said he expected the main challenges to
involve Hughes' mental state at the time he is
supposed to have made out the will.
