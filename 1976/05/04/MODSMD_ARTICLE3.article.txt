# Galvez street closes
## Construction cuts parking 
### Rosario Delatorre 
Some 114 reserve and staff permit
parking spaces will be eliminated
when the parking lot adjacent to the
Lou Henry Hoover Building is closed
on Thursday on account of under
ground construction for the proposed
Herbert Hoover Memorial Building.
Beginning immediately, Galvez
Street will be closed for what may be
years at its intersection with Serra
Street, between Hoover Tower and En
cina Hall, according to Nelson.
Fifty more spaces along Galvez
Street will be lost in late May or early
June because of the construction, ac
cording to Master Planner Oscar Nel
son.
The pay parking lot next to the de

signated lot will not be affected by the
Hoover Memorial construction, Nel
son said.
The eliminated spaces will be re
assigned to Serra Street, between Gal
vez Street and Hoover Tower, accord
ing to Nelson. "It appears that that will
accomodate everyone," he said.
Galvez Street will be open to Escon
dido Road to allow access to the Main
Library pay parking lot. Nelson said.
"Access (to the Main Library pay lot)
by Escondido Road will be in effect
until the Main Library (pay) lot is
eliminated, (which will be) when con
struction begins on the addition to the
Main Library," he said.
The parking lot off of Serra by the
men's tennis courts will be reclassified

from "G" permit to "Faculty" and
"Staff" permits this summer, he ad
ded.
Nelson noted that there are about
700 spaces in the varsity tennis courts'
parking lot. The lot was intended to
replace parking spaces that would be
lost from construction projects, he
explained.
"We always try to provide replace
ment parking when we eliminate park
ing areas as a result of University con
struction," he said.
The underground construction for
the proposed Hoover Memorial Build
ing will include the installation of
steam lines, sewer lines, electrical and
communication lines and water sup
ply lines, Nelson said.
Construction of the building itself
will begin in late July, according to*
Senior Planner Robert Nerrie of Nel
son's office.
The proposed building will house
Hoover Institution archives and re
search facilities, Nerrie said.
