# Grad Council reps question AGR benefits

### William Sposato 
Members of the Graduate Student
Council (GSC) expressed doubts yes
terday as to how much the proposed
Advanced Graduate Registration prog
ram would benefit graduate students.
The proposal, submitted by the
Graduate Dean's Office, calls for fourth
year graduate students, now paying
total fees of $300 per year, to pay $2137
next year, one half the normal tuition.
Current students would be exempt
from the fee increase under the plan.
Committee member Linda Fields
said that the AGR proposal has been
criticized by some students who pay
their own tuition. Some of these
people are financing their education
by working, and cannot necessarily af
ford the increase, she said.
Assoc. Dean of Graduate Studies Ar
thur Walker said that many of those
students who pay their own tuition
would be granted some sort of Univer
sity fellowship in their fourth year of
graduate study.
Walker said the AGR proposal
would increase total income to the

University which could be used to in
crease the graduate fellowship fund.
Students who could demonstrate fi
nancial need in their fourth year
would receive support. Walker said.
Warren Seering, a student member
of the Committee on Graduate Studies,
said there is no reason to believe that
any increase in University income
would mean a boost in the graduate
fellowship fund.
Walker replied that while the Pro
vost's Office has not made a firm com
mitment to this idea, he feels that if
graduate students bring in more
money, they are entitled to increased
aid.
The dean's office hopes to institute
AGR next year, if no snags are disco
vered.
The proposal will next be consi
dered by the Budget Committee, after
which the provost will make the final
decision on the plan.
At its meeting next Monday, the
GSC will discuss whether University
fellowships should be assigned on the
basis of financial need.
