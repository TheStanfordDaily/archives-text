# Prof suggests lie detector test for candidates

Prof. William Shockley has suggested
that former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter
take a polygraph (lie detector) test to
show that his apologies for using the
phrase "ethnic purity" were sincere.
In identical letters sent to all presi
dential candidates in the Texas prim
ary via certified, special delivery air
mail on April 22, Shockley urged all
candidates to submit to polygraph
tests and challenge their political op
ponents to do the same.
If Carter were to follow this sugges
tion, he could convert the "liability" of
his remark into a "political asset,"
Shockley noted in the letter.
"Even more significantly," wrote
Shockley, Carter's action would
"promote open discussion in a search
for truth in free societies and
strengthen them in the world-wide
struggle against totalitarianism and
thought control."
He stated that "demonstrable integ
rity in our government is a vital need of
our nation," citing a Wall Street Jour
nal story which reported that 68 per
cent of those polled felt that the coun
try's leaders have "consistently lied"
to the people over the past 10 years.
Shockley said yesterday that he had
received the post card return receipts
indicating the letters had reached their

destinations, but had received no reply
from the candidates.
In his letter, Shockley said he is
"prepared to find polygraph examin
ers of unquestioned competence," and
offered, as president of the Foundation
for Research and Education on
Eugenics and Dysgenics (FREED), to
have that organization pay the costs of
the tests. FREED claims to be con
cerned with improving human genetic
quality.
If the polygraph test worked, "it
might mean people would know better
than they ever have before about what
they are voting for," Shockley said.
"I don't see any need at al l for Jimmy
Carter to take a polygraph test," said
John Seidl, a lecturer in public man
agement at the business school who is
working with the Carter campaign on
campus.
He said the support which Carter has
garnered shows there are many per
sons who believe Carter is "honest"
with a "fresh approach" to the busi
ness of government and "who trust
him." On this basis, Seidl said, it is
unnecessary for Carter to take a polyg
raph test.
Kent Thiry, campus coordinator for
the Carter campaign, said he is a "firm
believer that it (the 'ethnic purity' re
mark) was just a slip of the tongue."
Carter's record shows that he is
"progressive in the area of civil
rights," Thiry said, noting that Carter
had supported integration in the '50s.
No interaction
"I like the idea (of the polygraph
test) if it's reliable," said Thiry. He said
that voters generally "don't get to in
teract" with candidates and must
therefore base their judgments on the
candidate's character and on what
others say.
"If it (the polygraph test) would be
an asset, it would be a small one,"
Thiry said. He pointed out that al
though Carter's remark has been an
issue on campus, it has not been one
elsewhere and does not seem to have
hurt Carter in the primaries.
Winner of the 1956 Nobel prize in
physics for his work in developing the
transistor, Shockley has gained notor
iety in recent years for his contention
that blacks are genetically inferior to
whites.
Imperfect tools
Shockley said the polygraph is not
perfect, but "I compare imperfect tools
like polygraphs and IQ tests to the clin
ical thermometer, which is a valuable
instrument, even though it can't dis
tinguish between malaria and staying
too long in a sauna."
In his letter, Shockley noted that
when he took polygraph tests he found
"that the examiners did reliably de
termine when 1 answered 'no' falsely,
in keeping with their instructions, to a
trivial test situation."
