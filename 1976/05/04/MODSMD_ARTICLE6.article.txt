# COP head proposes new group for ongoing tenure evaluation
## 
### Lori Matsukawa 
Newly elected ASSU President Vic Petroff has proposed
a student group continuously researching, evaluating
and "keeping an eyewatch" on the tenure procedure.
The prospect of such a group was one of several ideas
discussed at an informal meeting between Petroff and
interested students last Thursday at Toyon Hall.
"We just got together what I considered to be a diverse
group of individuals interested in the tenure issue," said
Petroff.
"All I did was present to these people what I and the
other members of the COP (Council of Presidents) prop
osed in our campaign and asked them to respond and give
other ideas."
Petroff said he had called the participants in the meet
ing on the Friday after the election results were counted.
Continuity sought
Larry Diamond, a first year sociology graduate student
at the meeting, said, "there was a definite feeling at the
meeting that there is a group of people who are really
interested in the tenure problem and are willing to spend
time on it. We need a group of students that will provide
some continuity to the issue."
"We need to know more," Diamond continued, "We
need to know who is getting tenure and the reasons why,
whether the selection procedure is actually followed as
written, how much play is used within the rules.
"When I say 'play,' I mean there is a lot of flexibility in
the way tenure rules are applied. Not everyone is being
considered under the same procedure," said Diamond.
ASSU Vice President A 1 Tomaszczuk, who did not at

tend the meeting, said, "from what I've heard about the
meeting, what people seem to want is a permanent com
mittee, a continuous student pressure group."
Special task force
Tomaszczuk mentioned the possibility of forming a
special task force of students and administrators to work
under the COP providing data and input on tenure ap
pointments and procedures.
"If there were a group under the COP to get information
concerning tenure," said Diamond, "they could start talk
ing to professors who have had contact with the tenure
process. When we know how the (selection) procedure
works both on paper and, more importantly, in reality,
then we can focus our efforts on problem solving."
Diamond cautioned that such a group shoould not be
"too formal, (or) based on the presumption that we know
the present structure."
'Momentous import'
"The COP wants to cover all the bases and go slowly. On
a topic of such momentous import, you have to get all the
facts at once. The first order is to get the facts," he said.
Diamond suggested that the group should refrain from
"shooting too high too fast" and instead build up a strong
case for tenure change from an accurate information base.
Keith Archuleta, a member of the Howard slate, Petroff's
opponent in the COP election, was at the meeting briefly.
Bill Tyndall, also a member of the Howard slate, was
notified of the meeting but was unable to attend, accord
ing to Diamond.
Another organizational meeting is planned for next
Tuesday at 7 p.m. at Tresidder Union.

road work on Galvez between Serra Street and Campus Drive has made
navigating the south side of the University so complicated that officials
deemed the removal of the posts necessary.
