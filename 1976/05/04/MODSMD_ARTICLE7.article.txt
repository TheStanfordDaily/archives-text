## Theme house planning 
### 
Next fall will see the addition of two,
and possibly three, more theme houses
to the University's housing system.
Some persons are debating the merits of
a particular theme house or its location,
but it is time for the long-term future of
theme houses to be examined.
Theme houses are beginning to prolif
erate â€” during a time when the housing
demand still greatly exceeds the supply.
Theme houses restrict the choice of a
person, and the requirements necessary
for some houses' priorities exclude most.
It's particularly unfair that new resi
dences are becoming theme houses, in
stead of having theme houses equally

distributed among old and new resi
dences.
These and other aspects of creating
theme houses do not appear to have been
given the thought which tye deserve.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton and the Committee on Services to
Students should examine the concept of
theme houses and publish a comprehen
sive statement regarding the philosophy
behind theme houses. One aspect of
theme houses which this statement
needs to examine is what will be the
maximum number of theme houses al
lowed within the system.
