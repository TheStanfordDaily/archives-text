## 'Daily' reorganized 
### 
If you take a quick glance at
our staff box lower on this page,
you might note that the organi
zation of the Daily's news office
has changed slightly. That little
change. I hope, will make a big
difference in the quality of news
in the Daily and in our accessi
bility to you when you feel you
have a news story that merits our

coverage.
To be specific, the Daily now
has only one "news editor"—
Bonny Rodden. The news editor
is the only person you need to
contact if yo'u have a story
suggestion, tip, etc.
Roddenwill almost always be
available in the late afternoons
(3:30 to 6 p.m.) as well as other

sporadic times, and you can call
her at 497-4632.
Dan Fiduccia and Jack Vaughn
will assume the new positions of
"campus editors," and will deal
more closely with reporters.
Kathryn Ma will assume the
newly created position of na
tional news editor. She'll have
control over the AP news sum
mary and coordinate the Daily's
political coverage in this elec
tion year.
This organization should ac
complish three things:
1) Open the news office. With
only one person "in charge,"
you won't be shuffled from per
son to person. Ask specifically
for the news editor.
2) Free two editors, the new
campus editors, to re-establish
our news "beat system," check
over reporters' stories and do
some investigative writing on
their own.
3) Improve the quality and
consistency of the national news
in the paper, to make sure you
get a complete summary of the
important international and na
tional events.
This new system is only an
experiment, and it may need
modification, this year or next.
We may abandon it. But, judging
from your comments and com
plaints, I felt it a step in the right
direction —toward providing
you, the Stanford community,
with a newspaper that meets
your needs.
You may not notice any im
mediate or dramatic changes
right away, but we're working at
making our product better.
