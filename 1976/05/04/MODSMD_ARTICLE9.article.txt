Shoddy journalism
1 was deeply disgusted at the
inept writing and cheap jour
nalism as evidenced intheApril
30 Daily article on the women's
tennis victory, April 29, over the
JC All-Stars. 1 quote:
"Liza Pande of the Stanford
women's tennis team attended a
funeral yesterday morning and
then returned to the Varsity
Courts in the afternoon to watch
another one as her teammates
buried a group of local junior

college all-stars, 9-0."
The death of someone I loved
being used as a convenient play
on words is an affront to both my
family and myself. It is distres
sing to see a supposedly intelli
gent staff writer of the Daily
show such lack of maturity and
sensitivity.
I don't understand how this
managed to escape the sports
editor's good judgment, and I
hope this kind of writing is stop
ped.
