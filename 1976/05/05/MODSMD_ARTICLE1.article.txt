A health service for midpeninsula
residents is seeking to place members
on the governing body of the federally
funded Health Systems Agency (HSA),
according to the health service's plan
ning director, Jeanne Ewy.
Ewy said the Midpeninsula Health
Service (MPHS) is trying to get its
members on the HSA for Santa Clara
County by May 14.
"The HSA has the potential of being
a very powerful agency on a long-term
basis," said Ewy. "It will determine
the health needs of an area, the
facilities, programs and allocation of
federal funds."
She commented, "Since this is one
of the few agencies where the users of
the services, the consumers, can have
input at the decision-making level, we
feel that local representation is neces
sary."
The governing body of the HSA,
chosen and appointed by the Santa
Clara County Hoard of Supervisors,
will direct the activities of the HSA in
accordance with the National Health
Planning and Resources Development
Act of 1974 (also known as Public Law
93-641).
This act, according to President
Gerald Pord, "offers the greatest poten
tial for changing directions in the pro
visions of health care than any other
piece of legislation that has come
along."
The act allocates more than $1 bill
ion over three years for establishing
over 200 health systems agencies in
the country, 14 of them in California.
Each agency will be responsible for
making and carrying out plans to
achieve higher quality local health
care that is accessible to all citizens.
Priorities of the act include:
—provision of primary care services
established especially for the medi
cally underserved and economically
depressed;
—the development of group prac
tice;
—the training and utilization of
physician assistants;
—the promotion of activities for the
prevention of disease; and
—the development of methods to
educate the public in personal health
care and effective use of available
health services.
The governing body of the HSA will
consist of consumers, providers and
government representatives. The act
requires the majority of the body's
members to be consumers who equita
bly reflect the area's socio-economic,
racial, sex and age composition.
Two groups are currently applying
for designation as the HSA for Santa
Clara County. One, the Santa Clara
Health Systems Agency, is a public en
tity organized by the Board of Super
visors. The other, the Health Systems

Agency of Santa Clara Valley, is a
non-profit, private corporation which
was initiated by the Comprehensive
Health Planning Association.
Neither group could be reached for
comment.
"At the present time the non-profit
group (Health Systems Agency of
Santa Clara Valley) is in the process of
getting nominations for its Hoard of
Directors," said Ewy.
"In the county group (Santa Clara
Health Systems Agency) the House of
Delegates is meeting to decide who
will represent their group," she added.
"Hopefully if all things are kept to
schedule the decision will be made by
May 14 as to which group will be the
HSA for Santa Clara County."
The secretary of the California De
partment of Health. Education and
Welfare, upon consultation with the
governor, will make the final decision
as to which group will be designated
as the area's HSA.
Presently, the Mid-Peninsula Health
Service is a member-owned service
"providing primary health care ser
vices to people," according to Ewy.
