A health service for midpeninsula
residents is seeking to place members
on the governing body of the federally
funded Health Systems Agency (HSA),
according to the health service's plan
ning director, Jeanne Ewy.
Ewy said the Midpeninsula Health
Service (MPHS) is trying to get its
members on the HSA for Santa Clara
County by May 14.
"The HSA has the potential of being
a very powerful agency on a long-term
basis," said Ewy. "It will determine
the health needs of an area, the
facilities, programs and allocation of
federal funds."
She commented, "Since this is one
of the few agencies where the users of
the services, the consumers, can have
input at the decision-making level, we
feel that local representation is neces
sary."
The governing body of the HSA,
chosen and appointed by the Santa
Clara County Hoard of Supervisors,
will direct the activities of the HSA in
accordance with the National Health
Planning and Resources Development
Act of 1974 (also known as Public Law
93-641).
This act, according to President
Gerald Pord, "offers the greatest poten
tial for changing directions in the pro
visions of health care than any other
piece of legislation that has come
along."
The act allocates more than $1 bill
ion over three years for establishing
over 200 health systems agencies in
the country, 14 of them in California.
Each agency will be responsible for
making and carrying out plans to
achieve higher quality local health
care that is accessible to all citizens.
