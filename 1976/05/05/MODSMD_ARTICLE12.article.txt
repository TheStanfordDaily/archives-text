Underhanded attack
We, the members ofTheta Xi,
are outraged by the under
handed attack mounted on a
member of our fraternity by Rob
Ottilie, Interfraternity Council
(IFC) President. In an endorse
ment letter for the Vic Petroff
slate distributed to fraternities
on the eve of last week's Council
of Presidents (COP) run-off elec
tion, Ottilie stated without evi
dence that Dan Howard's slate
had worked against fraternity in
terests and that Vic Petroff was
pro-fraternity.
Therefore, he argued all
fraternity men should support
Petroff. He signed the letter as
IFC President, giving the impre
ssion that his statement was an
official M'C endorsement. In fact,
Ottil ie never consulted the IFC at
all.
To back up his claims he
stated that Petroff was about to
join the Beta Theta Pi fraternity,
and that he supported the bon
fire. Supposedly, this was indi
cative of Petroff's support of
fraternities.
Ottilie completely ignored the
fact that Howard has been a
pledged and active member of
Theta Xi for a year, and was in

fact the only fraternity man run
ning for the COP.
Ottilie went on to list some of
the organizations supporting
Howard, such as: the Gay
People's Union, Against the
Grain and Columbae House. He
implied that the support of such
organizations indicated an anti
fraternity feeling in Howard.
Wedonot believethatOttilie's
letter was decisive in terms of
the results of the election. This is
not our content ion. Rather we do
feel that his actions are divisive
to the fraternity system here and
display a callous disregard for
our house and our members,
who have always supported
fraternities.
We ask that the IFC im
mediately remove Ottilie from
the presidency of the council. He
has proven himself to be a pre
varicator, a person who abuses
his title and a divisive influence
on the fraternity system.
If the IFC does not comply
with our request, Theta Xi will
boycott all IFC functions and
meetings for at least the remain
der of Ottilie's tenure in office.

Inattentive to time
I wish Stanford University
would be more kind.
Now, I sit here, after receiving
my third parking ticket in three
days because I get dazed a lot by
this place, and can't keep track of
my car and my time. It's sad and
my fault for sure that I'm too lazy
to walk a long distance to my
pressing engagements.
But on the other hand, when
I've got a class to get to in a rush
(because I've been created so
hectically here), I park in one of
those 40 minute zones. Then I
have a 50 minute class and get
zapped.
This letter is, in part, a
panegyric to the timeliness of
the Stanford Police Depart
ment's critical eye. Yet, it seems
to me and those people with
whom I've talked who have had
similar frustrations as to the high
cost of parking on this campus,
that the 40 minute time zones
ought to be changed to 50 mi
nutes. It just makes common
sense.
And if Stanford doesn't, I'm
going to take my Volvo toy and
go home.

on the eve of last week's Council
of Presidents (COP) run-off elec
tion, Ottilie stated without evi
dence that Dan Howard's slate
had worked against fraternity in
terests and that Vic Petroff was
pro-fraternity.
Therefore, he argued all
fraternity men should support
Petroff. He signed the letter as
IFC President, giving the impre
ssion that his statement was an
official M'C endorsement. In fact,
Ottil ie never consulted the IFC at
all.
To back up his claims he
stated that Petroff was about to
join the Beta Theta Pi fraternity,
and that he supported the bon
fire. Supposedly, this was indi
cative of Petroff's support of
fraternities.
Ottilie completely ignored the
fact that Howard has been a
pledged and active member of
Theta Xi for a year, and was in

fact the only fraternity man run
ning for the COP.
Ottilie went on to list some of
the organizations supporting
Howard, such as: the Gay
People's Union, Against the
Grain and Columbae House. He
implied that the support of such
organizations indicated an anti
fraternity feeling in Howard.
Wedonot believethatOttilie's
letter was decisive in terms of
the results of the election. This is
not our content ion. Rather we do
feel that his actions are divisive
to the fraternity system here and
display a callous disregard for
our house and our members,
who have always supported
fraternities.
We ask that the IFC im
mediately remove Ottilie from
the presidency of the council. He
has proven himself to be a pre
varicator, a person who abuses
his title and a divisive influence
on the fraternity system.
If the IFC does not comply
with our request, Theta Xi will
boycott all IFC functions and
meetings for at least the remain
der of Ottilie's tenure in office.

Inattentive to time
I wish Stanford University
would be more kind.
Now, I sit here, after receiving
my third parking ticket in three
days because I get dazed a lot by
this place, and can't keep track of
my car and my time. It's sad and
my fault for sure that I'm too lazy
to walk a long distance to my
pressing engagements.
But on the other hand, when
I've got a class to get to in a rush
(because I've been created so
hectically here), I park in one of
those 40 minute zones. Then I
have a 50 minute class and get
zapped.
This letter is, in part, a
panegyric to the timeliness of
the Stanford Police Depart
ment's critical eye. Yet, it seems
to me and those people with
whom I've talked who have had
similar frustrations as to the high
cost of parking on this campus,
that the 40 minute time zones
ought to be changed to 50 mi
nutes. It just makes common
sense.
And if Stanford doesn't, I'm
going to take my Volvo toy and
go home.
