The opponents of Proposition
15, the Nuclear Safeguards In
itiative, call it radical legisla
tion. Rick Greer in his April 15
Daily column indicates that the
initiative is "far more moderate
than they (theopponents) would
have you believe." It seems dif
ficult to defend as "moderate" a
proposal which would, in the
face of an on-rushing energy
crisis, eliminate a presently av
ailable source of energy without
addressing the relative risks and
benefits of that technology.
We cannot logically rule out
one power source without care
fully considering the relative de
sirability and demonstrated av
ailability of the remaining
sources. We clearly need a ba
lanced energy policy, not one
that blindly eliminates our op
tions.
Proposition >15 was intended
to be, and is. a shutdown mea

sure which would remain in ef
fect forever. Greer talks about
Proposition 15's "conditional
phased shutdown of operating
nuclear plants" and
"moratorium on new construc
tion" as if the conditions of the
initiative provided for flexible
realistic implementation. Prop
osition 15 provides neither the
opportunity nor the mechanism
to restart already shutdown
plants; nor does it provide for
reinitiation of construction ac
tivities for new plants. This
open-ended "moratorium"
comes as close to being a per
petual shutdown measure for
nuclear power in California as
we could get. This may very well
have been t he intent of the prop
osition's authors all along.
Nuclear power has the most
extensive and complete public
liablity coverage of any industry
in the world. Yet Proposition 15
would shut down nuclear power

in California (forever) within
one year unless the nuclear in
dustry can assure "full compen
sation" for loss of propety and
life subsequent to any imagina
ble nuclear accident.
Disregarding for a moment
that such assurance might re
quire repeal of a recently
enacted Federal law (the Price-
Anderson Act), please consider
the fact that no industry, no ac
tivity, no human endeavor of
any kind can provide the assur
ance of "full compensation" to
the public. To honestly attempt
implementation of such assur
ance would mean the end of
technological development and
industrial growth as we know it
(as well as the end of many broad
humanitarian programs with
small, yet real risks — but large
benefits.
Zero-risk activities
Such assumption of unlimited
liability is only possible when
dealing with zero-risk activities;
there are no such activities. We
will always have to weigh poten
tial risks against potential be
nefits. Let's be realistic, there are
no assurances of "full compen
sation" for the people who live
below Folsom Dam, should it
fall. There are no such assur
ances forthcoming from the
owners of the Golden Gate
Bridge, should it collapse on
your way to Marin County.
While State and Federal disas
ter legislation provides funds for
disasters such as earthquakes,
explosions, chemical releases,
fires, floods, tornadoes, etc.,
these funds typically cover only
damage to property, not per
sonal injury or death. The
Price-Anderson Act automati
cally provides the public with
complete no-fault liability
coverage for up to 560 million
dollars. Claims need only be
supported by proof of loss for
coverage. Furthermore, Con
gress has stated its intention to
extend the liability coverage
beyond the 560 million dollars
automatically available should
the need ever arise. No other in
dustry can offer the public that
kind of protection.
There isn't a single activity on
earth (let alone any industry)
which could stand up to the
open-ended safety and en
vironmental impact require
ments ambiguously envisioned
by Proposition 15.
Operating nuclear plant safety

systems are continually tested
and retested year-in and year-out
as a routine matter. Proposition
15 alludes to tests and criteria for
safety acceptance, yet these tests
and criteria are not defined or
discussed. Greer talks about the
safety system requirements of
the Proposition as if the real key
question, the acceptance criteria
for these tests, has ever been
explored and defined in the
Proposition. If adequately de
fined, their reasonableness and
merit could be determined.
Fully tested
Proposition 15 calls for reactor
safety systems to be fully tested
in "actual operation." In fact, all
of the nuclear plant's safety sys
tems and components are al
ready fully tested as a routine re
quirement of the operating
license. Testability is a design
requirement. The plant operat
ing license requires daily,
weekly, and monthly check out
and operation of this hardware
during power operation, as well
as prior to each startup. When a
deficiency is discovered, the
plant is shut down and repaired,
or does not start up until cor
rected and verified.
This is the sameaproach used
by airline pilots during their
pre-flight safety checks and in
flight operations monitoring.
We don't legislate a crash test of
every airline to prove what will
happen if the landing gear fails.
Rather, the airlines checkout
component-by-component and
system-by-system the normal
and back-up hydraulic and
mechanical performance of the
landing gear system.
When Proposition 15 talks
about "fully tested in actual op
eration" does it mean a power
company will have to crash test
their power plant by staging a
major accident to satisfy the
proponents of the initiative? No
one real ly knows what the initia
tive has in mind.
Will one such crash test be
enough, or will absolute proof
only come from a program of
many such tests? Again, these
tests will only serve to verify that
each safety system is operable at
a given instant — which is
exactly what existing operating
plant test procedures are doing
(on every plant, on a continuous
basis, not just a "crash" model).

osition 15 provides neither the
opportunity nor the mechanism
to restart already shutdown
plants; nor does it provide for
reinitiation of construction ac
tivities for new plants. This
open-ended "moratorium"
comes as close to being a per

nuclear power in California as
we could get. This may very well

Nuclear power has the most
extensive and complete public
liablity coverage of any industry
in the world. Yet Proposition 15
would shut down nuclear power

in California (forever) within
one year unless the nuclear in
dustry can assure "full compen
sation" for loss of propety and
life subsequent to any imagina
ble nuclear accident.
Disregarding for a moment
that such assurance might re
quire repeal of a recently
enacted Federal law (the Price-
Anderson Act), please consider
the fact that no industry, no ac
tivity, no human endeavor of
any kind can provide the assur
ance of "full compensation" to
the public. To honestly attempt
implementation of such assur
ance would mean the end of
technological development and
industrial growth as we know it
(as well as the end of many broad
humanitarian programs with
small, yet real risks — but large
benefits.
Zero-risk activities
Such assumption of unlimited
liability is only possible when
dealing with zero-risk activities;
there are no such activities. We
will always have to weigh poten
tial risks against potential be
nefits. Let's be realistic, there are
no assurances of "full compen

below Folsom Dam, should it
fall. There are no such assur
ances forthcoming from the
owners of the Golden Gate
Bridge, should it collapse on
your way to Marin County.
While State and Federal disas
ter legislation provides funds for
disasters such as earthquakes,
explosions, chemical releases,
fires, floods, tornadoes, etc.,
these funds typically cover only
damage to property, not per
sonal injury or death. The
Price-Anderson Act automati
cally provides the public with
complete no-fault liability
coverage for up to 560 million
dollars. Claims need only be
supported by proof of loss for
coverage. Furthermore, Con
gress has stated its intention to
extend the liability coverage
beyond the 560 million dollars
automatically available should
the need ever arise. No other in
dustry can offer the public that
kind of protection.
There isn't a single activity on
earth (let alone any industry)
which could stand up to the
open-ended safety and en
vironmental impact require
ments ambiguously envisioned
by Proposition 15.
Operating nuclear plant safety

systems are continually tested
and retested year-in and year-out
as a routine matter. Proposition
15 alludes to tests and criteria for
safety acceptance, yet these tests
and criteria are not defined or
discussed. Greer talks about the
safety system requirements of
the Proposition as if the real key
question, the acceptance criteria
for these tests, has ever been
explored and defined in the
Proposition. If adequately de
fined, their reasonableness and
merit could be determined.
Fully tested
Proposition 15 calls for reactor
safety systems to be fully tested
in "actual operation." In fact, all
of the nuclear plant's safety sys
tems and components are al
ready fully tested as a routine re
quirement of the operating
license. Testability is a design
requirement. The plant operat
ing license requires daily,
weekly, and monthly check out
and operation of this hardware
during power operation, as well
as prior to each startup. When a
deficiency is discovered, the
plant is shut down and repaired,
or does not start up until cor
rected and verified.
This is the sameaproach used
by airline pilots during their
pre-flight safety checks and in
flight operations monitoring.
We don't legislate a crash test of
every airline to prove what will
happen if the landing gear fails.
Rather, the airlines checkout
component-by-component and
system-by-system the normal
and back-up hydraulic and
mechanical performance of the
landing gear system.
When Proposition 15 talks
about "fully tested in actual op
eration" does it mean a power
company will have to crash test
their power plant by staging a
major accident to satisfy the
proponents of the initiative? No
one real ly knows what the initia
tive has in mind.
Will one such crash test be
enough, or will absolute proof
only come from a program of
many such tests? Again, these
tests will only serve to verify that
each safety system is operable at
a given instant — which is
exactly what existing operating
plant test procedures are doing
(on every plant, on a continuous
basis, not just a "crash" model).

(as well as the end of many broad
humanitarian programs with
small, yet real risks — but large
benefits.
Zero-risk activities
Such assumption of unlimited
liability is only possible when
dealing with zero-risk activities;
there are no such activities. We
will always have to weigh poten
tial risks against potential be
nefits. Let's be realistic, there are
no assurances of "full compen
sation" for the people who live
below Folsom Dam, should it
fall. There are no such assur
ances forthcoming from the
owners of the Golden Gate
Bridge, should it collapse on
your way to Marin County.
While State and Federal disas
ter legislation provides funds for
disasters such as earthquakes,
explosions, chemical releases,
fires, floods, tornadoes, etc.,
these funds typically cover only
damage to property, not per
sonal injury or death. The
Price-Anderson Act automati
cally provides the public with
complete no-fault liability
coverage for up to 560 million
dollars. Claims need only be
supported by proof of loss for
coverage. Furthermore, Con
gress has stated its intention to
extend the liability coverage
beyond the 560 million dollars
automatically available should
the need ever arise. No other in
dustry can offer the public that
kind of protection.
There isn't a single activity on
earth (let alone any industry)
which could stand up to the
open-ended safety and en
vironmental impact require
ments ambiguously envisioned
by Proposition 15.
Operating nuclear plant safety

systems are continually tested
and retested year-in and year-out
as a routine matter. Proposition
15 alludes to tests and criteria for
safety acceptance, yet these tests
and criteria are not defined or
discussed. Greer talks about the
safety system requirements of
the Proposition as if the real key
question, the acceptance criteria
for these tests, has ever been
explored and defined in the
Proposition. If adequately de
fined, their reasonableness and
merit could be determined.
Fully tested
Proposition 15 calls for reactor
safety systems to be fully tested
in "actual operation." In fact, all
of the nuclear plant's safety sys
tems and components are al
ready fully tested as a routine re
quirement of the operating
license. Testability is a design
requirement. The plant operat
ing license requires daily,
weekly, and monthly check out
and operation of this hardware
during power operation, as well
as prior to each startup. When a
deficiency is discovered, the
plant is shut down and repaired,
or does not start up until cor
rected and verified.
This is the sameaproach used
by airline pilots during their
pre-flight safety checks and in
flight operations monitoring.
We don't legislate a crash test of
every airline to prove what will
happen if the landing gear fails.
Rather, the airlines checkout
component-by-component and
system-by-system the normal
and back-up hydraulic and
mechanical performance of the
landing gear system.
When Proposition 15 talks
about "fully tested in actual op
eration" does it mean a power
company will have to crash test
their power plant by staging a
major accident to satisfy the
proponents of the initiative? No
one real ly knows what the initia
tive has in mind.
Will one such crash test be
enough, or will absolute proof
only come from a program of
many such tests? Again, these
tests will only serve to verify that
each safety system is operable at
a given instant — which is
exactly what existing operating
plant test procedures are doing
(on every plant, on a continuous
basis, not just a "crash" model).

The opponents of Proposition
15, the Nuclear Safeguards In
itiative, call it radical legisla
tion. Rick Greer in his April 15
Daily column indicates that the
initiative is "far more moderate
than they (theopponents) would
have you believe." It seems dif
ficult to defend as "moderate" a
proposal which would, in the
face of an on-rushing energy
crisis, eliminate a presently av
ailable source of energy without
addressing the relative risks and
benefits of that technology.
We cannot logically rule out
one power source without care
fully considering the relative de
sirability and demonstrated av
ailability of the remaining
sources. We clearly need a ba
lanced energy policy, not one
that blindly eliminates our op
tions.
Proposition >15 was intended
to be, and is. a shutdown mea

sure which would remain in ef
fect forever. Greer talks about
Proposition 15's "conditional
phased shutdown of operating
nuclear plants" and
"moratorium on new construc
tion" as if the conditions of the
initiative provided for flexible
realistic implementation. Prop
osition 15 provides neither the
opportunity nor the mechanism
to restart already shutdown
plants; nor does it provide for
reinitiation of construction ac
tivities for new plants. This
open-ended "moratorium"
comes as close to being a per
petual shutdown measure for
nuclear power in California as
we could get. This may very well
have been t he intent of the prop
osition's authors all along.
Nuclear power has the most
extensive and complete public
liablity coverage of any industry
in the world. Yet Proposition 15
would shut down nuclear power

in California (forever) within
one year unless the nuclear in
dustry can assure "full compen
sation" for loss of propety and
life subsequent to any imagina
ble nuclear accident.
Disregarding for a moment
that such assurance might re
quire repeal of a recently
enacted Federal law (the Price-
Anderson Act), please consider
the fact that no industry, no ac
tivity, no human endeavor of
any kind can provide the assur
ance of "full compensation" to
the public. To honestly attempt
implementation of such assur
ance would mean the end of
technological development and
industrial growth as we know it
(as well as the end of many broad
humanitarian programs with
