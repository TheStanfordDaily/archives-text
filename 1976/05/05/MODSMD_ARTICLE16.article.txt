IVhy isn't Old Encina Gym, the basketball pavil
ion, returned to the Athletic Department to be
used as a sports center? The Old Pavilion has a
line spring-type-construction floor, similar to
Maples. Office personnel certainly do not need
spring floors, showers, dressing rooms and an
extra high ceiling. It has been quite some time
since business office personnel from Encina Hall
were moveil there temporarily (?) because of the
Encina fire. -T.G. and D.G.
Unfortunately, it's going to be a long time. Earl
Cilley, director of sponsored projects, said that the
most recent estimated repair cost for the burned
east wing of Encina is $() to 7 million. And every
day the price inflates a little more.
The east wing has a basement and five floors, of
which only the first floor and basement are now
serviceable. According to Cilley, the fire was so
hot that it loosened the mortar between the
sandstone blocks. Repairs will involve propping
up the outside, tearing out all woodwork and
flooring to the basement, pouring a reinforced
concrete shell inside the sandstone, tying the
sandstone to the reinforced concrete and then
putting all the floors back in.
In addition, the rebuilt lincina will have to meet
mur h higher county fire specifications than the
old one, making the whole process "horrendously
expensive." Not only does the University lack
money, but the funds it has are going to higher
priority construction like the library and the re
construction of the History Corner.
One way to get people out of the Old Pavilion,
Cilley suggested, would be to "bulldoze the damn
thing (the burned wing) and put a tin shed out
there," a solution which headmitted would not be
very aesthetically pleasing. Or the parking lot
could be tilled with modular structures.
It might be gratifying to know that the people in
the Old Pavilion aren't any happier being there.
According to Cilley, bees come in through the
window, birds fly overhead and make public nui-

sances of themselves,and dust blowsthrough the
building. All material from the old building must
be hand-delivered.
In other words, don't count on using the gym
any time soon. Right now, Cilley and his staff are
hoping for a present from the tooth fairy.

Can you give me some information on Tim Eugan,
who writes "Over the Edge?" Is he a student here?
-H.D.
I really like "Over the Edge" but something
puzzles me. I know thatMorgo the Monstrous bore
a striking resemblance to Hubert Humphrey, but
who was that despicable character always whis
pering in his ear? Garry Trudeau? Elliot Richard
son? Jerry Brown? Richard Lyman? -T.S.J.
Tim Eagan, a former district attorney of Santa
Clara county, lives in a Santa Cruz mountain
cabin with his dog Crimble. A graduate of
Dartmouth and Hastings law school, he quit the
law trade after realizing that his decision to be an
attorney was "just taking the path of least resis
tance." Since then he has been a "hungry car
toonist," who is, he hopes, "still on his way up."
Eagan draws political cartoons for Sundaz — a
weekly Santa Cruz newspaper — and one of his
cartoons has been published in Penthouse."Over
the Edge" is presently published only in the
Daily.
Eagan admits that Morgo does indeed share
Hubert Humphrey's face but calls it a non sequitur
in the strip. "There he is, the Hump, right in the
middle of this outer space cartoon," Eagan said.
"But his presence in the strip doesn't have any
specific meaning, one way or the other."
The little slime at Hubert's ear is just a mysteri
ous, faceless figure whom Eagan calls "Mr. Big."
"He's the man behind the scenes, the only one
who knows what's going on." While that may
sound like Richard Lyman, Eagan rejects any
identity for his character.

up the outside, tearing out all woodwork and
flooring to the basement, pouring a reinforced
concrete shell inside the sandstone, tying the
sandstone to the reinforced concrete and then
putting all the floors back in.
In addition, the rebuilt lincina will have to meet
mur h higher county fire specifications than the
old one, making the whole process "horrendously
expensive." Not only does the University lack
money, but the funds it has are going to higher
priority construction like the library and the re
construction of the History Corner.
One way to get people out of the Old Pavilion,
Cilley suggested, would be to "bulldoze the damn
thing (the burned wing) and put a tin shed out
there," a solution which headmitted would not be
very aesthetically pleasing. Or the parking lot
could be tilled with modular structures.
It might be gratifying to know that the people in
the Old Pavilion aren't any happier being there.
According to Cilley, bees come in through the
window, birds fly overhead and make public nui-

sances of themselves,and dust blowsthrough the
building. All material from the old building must
be hand-delivered.
In other words, don't count on using the gym
any time soon. Right now, Cilley and his staff are
hoping for a present from the tooth fairy.

Can you give me some information on Tim Eugan,
who writes "Over the Edge?" Is he a student here?
-H.D.
I really like "Over the Edge" but something
puzzles me. I know thatMorgo the Monstrous bore
a striking resemblance to Hubert Humphrey, but
who was that despicable character always whis
pering in his ear? Garry Trudeau? Elliot Richard
son? Jerry Brown? Richard Lyman? -T.S.J.
Tim Eagan, a former district attorney of Santa
Clara county, lives in a Santa Cruz mountain
cabin with his dog Crimble. A graduate of
Dartmouth and Hastings law school, he quit the
law trade after realizing that his decision to be an
attorney was "just taking the path of least resis
tance." Since then he has been a "hungry car
toonist," who is, he hopes, "still on his way up."
Eagan draws political cartoons for Sundaz — a
weekly Santa Cruz newspaper — and one of his
cartoons has been published in Penthouse."Over
the Edge" is presently published only in the
Daily.
Eagan admits that Morgo does indeed share
Hubert Humphrey's face but calls it a non sequitur
in the strip. "There he is, the Hump, right in the
middle of this outer space cartoon," Eagan said.
"But his presence in the strip doesn't have any
specific meaning, one way or the other."
The little slime at Hubert's ear is just a mysteri
ous, faceless figure whom Eagan calls "Mr. Big."
"He's the man behind the scenes, the only one
who knows what's going on." While that may
sound like Richard Lyman, Eagan rejects any
identity for his character.


IVhy isn't Old Encina Gym, the basketball pavil
ion, returned to the Athletic Department to be
used as a sports center? The Old Pavilion has a
line spring-type-construction floor, similar to
Maples. Office personnel certainly do not need
spring floors, showers, dressing rooms and an
extra high ceiling. It has been quite some time
since business office personnel from Encina Hall
were moveil there temporarily (?) because of the
Encina fire. -T.G. and D.G.
Unfortunately, it's going to be a long time. Earl
Cilley, director of sponsored projects, said that the
most recent estimated repair cost for the burned
east wing of Encina is $() to 7 million. And every
day the price inflates a little more.
The east wing has a basement and five floors, of
which only the first floor and basement are now
serviceable. According to Cilley, the fire was so
hot that it loosened the mortar between the
sandstone blocks. Repairs will involve propping
up the outside, tearing out all woodwork and
flooring to the basement, pouring a reinforced
concrete shell inside the sandstone, tying the
sandstone to the reinforced concrete and then
putting all the floors back in.
