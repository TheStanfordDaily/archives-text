"Capitalism and democracy
are incompatible," stated Prof.
James O'Connor, a Maxist
economist from San Jose State
University, at his lecture Mon
day night on "International Cap
ital and National Politics."
According to O'Connor, there
is presently a "working class
majority" in the U.S. whose un
ionized demands prevent
capitalist big business from
gaining necessary profits. In
order to avoid the working class
majority and union power preva
lent in U.S. democracy, O'Con
nor contends that big business is
moving to Third World nations
to exploit cheap and unor
ganized labor.
"The accumulation of means
of production in the developed
world and the accumulation of
surplus labor in the underde
veloped world is the basic dif
ference between the two," re
marked O'Connor.
O'Connor elaborated on this
difference by commenting that
"Capitalists bring their means of
production (factories)
technological advancements
and capital to the underde
veloped countries to exploit this
surplus labor."
Integration helped
"Previously, immigrant labor,
the integration of workers from
underdeveloped to developed
countries, helped capitalists to
match their means of production
with capital," stated O'Connor.
"But immigrants brought new
forms of class struggle and heavy
expenses in the U. 5.," he added,
"so the best solution was for big
business to bring their capital to

the Third World."
"By moving business to the
Third World," O'Connor em
phasized, "capitalists leave pro
duction expenses, such such as
pollution control, to Third
World nations to worry about."
Labor force
The cheap and flexible labor
force existing in Third World
countries, says O'Connor, can be
maintained by "the growing
militarism of sub-imperial pow
ers such as India, Brazil, and
Mexico."
"This takes the load off of U.S.
military forces abroad," O'Con
nor said.
Overseas more profitable
According to O'Connor,
capitalists would rather venture
overseas than fight strong U.S.
labor forces and demands of die
welfare state.
"Through overseas invest
ments," said O'Connor,
"capitalists let national poli
ticians deal with problems of the
welfare state."
"There is plenty of demand in
the U.S., but it is harder and har
der to produce values profita
bly," he added.
Because of lower and less cer
tain profits, "capitalists have al
lowed working conditions in the
U.S. to deteriorate," O'Connor
commented.
O'Connor said "there has been
no real average wage increase
within the last eleven years."
