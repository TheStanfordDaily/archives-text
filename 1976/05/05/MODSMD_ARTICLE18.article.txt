# Rose Bowl hero Nevers mourned

Sports editor's note: The beJovv is a raprint from The Daily Palo
Alto on Ernie Nevers. Nevers probably was the greatest all-around
athlete in Stanford history. In the 1925 Hose Bowl game against
Notre Dame and its farious "Four Horsemen" backfield, Nevers set
a record by carrying the ball 34 times for 114 yards.
After his college days, Nevers signed with the Duluth Eskimos of
the NFL in 1926 and later starred for the Chicago Cardinals, play
ing through 1927.
Ernie Nevers died Monday at the age of 72.
STANFORD, Jan. 5,1925 — ErnieNevers will guidethedestinies
of the 1925 varsity football team. He was chosen captain by the
members of the squad after the Notre Dame contest, in which
Nevers played one of the best games of his career.
Many critics have voiced the opinion that Nevers is the greatest
athlete ever to wear the Cardinal. He is a member of the class of
1926, but last year he earned three varsity letters, and was a star on
each squad. This year he injured an ankle in the first practice
football game. In the following game, with Montana, he crushed
the other ankle and could not play until last Thursday. Against
Notre Dame he was in the thick of the fray invariably. His crashing
line bucks were never stopped until they had netted a substantial
gain, his passes were well timed and accurate, and Notre Dame
found its Waterloo in his work on defense.
Should his ankles be strong enough, Nevers is counted upon to
fill one of the forward berths on the hoop squad. He played this
position last year and was known as one of the smoothest pivoters
and dribblers in the conference.
Last year his work on the mound was a leading factor in Califor
nia's defeat by the Card baseball varsity. On the 1923 grid team he
was also invaluable, being placed on Walter Camp's third All-
American eleven.
When a freshman Nevers earned four numerals, a feat seldom
recorded. Two of these came on the same day, as he pitched for the
Babe nine in the forenoon, and then after taking a shower donned
track togs and placed in the Stanford-California track meet.
