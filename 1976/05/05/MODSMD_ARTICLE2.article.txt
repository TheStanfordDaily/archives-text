# A 						futile effort?
## SF pickets pulled

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A sur
prise move which yanked a majority of
striking city workers off picket lines
yesterday had little apparent effect on
the 35-day-old walkout of crafts union
members.
Officials of the Laborers Union rep
resenting about 1 200 of the 1800 strik
ing employes, called the 24 hour pic
keting moritorium "a good faith ges
ture to get the board to sit down and
talk with us."
They became the first of the 10 strik
ing unions to agree to a city proposal
aimed at getting negotiations under
way. The proposal, already with
drawn, included establishing a fact
finding panel, a return to work and the
removal of two propositions placed on
the June 8 ballot by the city.
But their efforts appeared to be
futile. While expressing delight with

the action, Board of Supervisors Presi
dent Quentin L. Kopp warned that it
does not signal an end to the illegal
walkout.
"We're delighted to see the pickets
removed," Kopp said in a telephone
interview. "But I think people would
be even more delighted to see the
workers return to work."
Jack Crowley, executive secretary of
the Central Labor Council, said labor
leaders had issued another call for
"face-to-face" negotiations with the
board. The board negotiates through
Patrick Mahler, insisting he has the
necessary power to hammer out a deal
with the strikers.
"We have offered to take all our de
mands off the table," Crowley said.
"We're ready to start anew if they'll sit
down with us."

THE Ci(K)I) OLD DAYS?—The last major demonstration sponsored by Stan
ford's Alliance for Radical Change saw marchers protest University financial
aid and a contract with Iran — but that was a year ago. Today Stanford
radicals have apparently turned to more traditional political means.
