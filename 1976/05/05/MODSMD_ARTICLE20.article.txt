# Rain in Spain, but Britain's dry
##

LONDON (AP) â€” British commuters hurrying to work Monday
thought they felt a vaguely familiar sodden substanr.e falling out of
the sky and speckling pavements dried by Britain's worst drought
since 1780.
Those with good memories identified the substance as rain, but
the phenomenon passed and the sun came out before anyone did
anything impulsive, like breaking out a brolly or covering a cricket
wicket.
"Beastly weather we've been having," grumbled the manager of
James Smith and Son Ltd., the sticks and umbrellas people. "Only
four days rain in a year. If it weren't for walking sticks, I don't know
how we'd carry on."
The drought has almost changed the life-style of Britain's
staidest citizenry. It's been weeks since anyone left an umbrella in
the cloakroom at the Athenaeum Club, the exclusive Pall Mall
hangout for politicians and churchmen, where a prominent
member of the aristocracy once blamed the disappearance of um
brellas on "letting all those bishops in here."
The hall porter allowed that "some of the older members still
come along with their umbrellas to sort of complete their outfits,"
but he knew of no cases of brolly-napping during the long dry spel 1.

At Lord's cricket ground the gentlemen players in the white
flannels and schoolboy caps have been able to play through to tea
every day since the new season began.
"They haven't gone in once to play cards while we broke out the
tarpaulins," said a grounds keeper.
The British meteorological office blames the rain in Spain and
North Africa for the prolonged British drought. The explanation is
that after a succession of mild winters the arctic ice cap has re
ceded, changing North Atlantic weather patterns so that the rain
bearing depressions normally destined for England have gone
farther south or, in some cases, north over Scandinavia and Siberia.
In the hard-hit southern and western parts of England, where
reservoirs are at their lowest levels in two centuries, water au
thorities have banned garden hoses and are drawing up con
tingency plans to ration water if the public ignores the warnings
against wasting it.
; In the Wessex country, familiar to lovers of Thomas Hady's
novels, the water authority is taking no chances. Besides spending
$2 million on emergency bore holes, borrowing four huge tanker
trucks from a brewery and putting four mobile river-water treat
ment plants on a standby basis, the authority director, Anthony
Young, sent off to Botswana in southern Africa for a prayer rug.
