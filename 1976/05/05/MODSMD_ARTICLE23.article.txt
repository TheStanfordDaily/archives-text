## At 24, women's net coach Anne Hill works non-stop 
### Linda Buddenberg 
"I do things as fast as possible." says Anne
Hill. "I've always been that way.
And she isn't kidding. At 24, she's already
coach of Stanford's women's tennis team.
When Hill was 18, she enrolled at Stanford as a
freshman. Four years later. Hill'was graduated
Phi Beta Kappa in Spanish.
"If 1 had to do things over, 1 might take things
a little slower," she says. "But 1 love all the
things I'm doing now."
Hill says her age is probably one of her
biggest assets to the program. It wasn't too long
ago that she was a Stanford player herself —in
the days before Title IX.
'Old tennis balls'
"We only practiced an hour twice a week,"
she remembers. "We had to use old tennis
balls, we had absolutely no travel money, no
thing."
Hill played first doubles when she was here.
"They had a funny rule then, trying to spread
around the playing time,"she explains. "You
could either play singles or doubles, but not
both."
Her players say they believe that since Hill
was recently in tournaments herself, she's a
more effective coach, even with scholarships
and new tennis balls.
"She knows what we're going through,"
says team member Pat Varga. "She under
stands the pressure we're under."
Hill also notes that her players "each have
different needs. With some 1 need to work on
specific strokes, but others need more help
with the mental part of the game."
'Satisfying'
"It's really satisfying here," she concludes.
"It's easier to see improvement here than at a
tennis club."
Teaching at a club (she was a pro at the
Menlo Circus Club before coming to Stanford)
didn't offer the same rewards, she says.
"People at clubs don't necessarily take les
sons to be good tennis players," she com
mented. "Some do it for social reasons, some to

lose weight."
Not so for her current pupils. In coming to
Stanford, Hill inherited the best, or very close
to the best, women's tennis team in the coun
try. And unless some of her stars run off prema
turely to join the pros, she'll have some great
talent around for a while.
Recruiting
"We're not even concerned about recruiting
for next year," she says. "We won't be looking
until 1977."
Hill didn't follow the usual path to tennis
addiction. She got her tennis start when she
was growing up in South America.
"I lived in a little town which you might call
the 'armpit of the world,' " Hill recalls. "The
only thing to do there was swim or play ten
nis."
So, making the most of the situation, she
picked up her first racket at age 13. Her main
practice opponent and doubles partner was her
younger sister.
"The big difference between playing here
and in South America is the lack of competi
tion down there. There's very few good players
to play against." Hill says.
'Not ladylike'
"There's a different sports philosophy for
girls there, too," Hill continued. "It's not con
sidered ladylike to play after you're 15 or 16.
There's only a few people playing after the
14-and-unders."
So, Hill came north for competitions, includ
ing the Orange Bowl International Bowl in
1966 and 1967, and the Junior Wimbledon
Tournament in 1968.
Hill's "really easy to talk to about anything,"
says Varga. "She goes out to dinner with us and
stuff, too."
Even when she's off the courts and out of her
courtside office, Hill says her mind is usually
on the tennis team.
"I've only been home one Sunday all quar
ter," she says."I haven't even had time to play
tennis myself. . . it's just been tennis stuff for
so long."

Not so for her current pupils. In coming to
Stanford, Hill inherited the best, or very close
to the best, women's tennis team in the coun
try. And unless some of her stars run off prema
turely to join the pros, she'll have some great
talent around for a while.
Recruiting
"We're not even concerned about recruiting
for next year," she says. "We won't be looking
until 1977."
Hill didn't follow the usual path to tennis
addiction. She got her tennis start when she
was growing up in South America.
"I lived in a little town which you might call
the 'armpit of the world,' " Hill recalls. "The
only thing to do there was swim or play ten
nis."
So, making the most of the situation, she
picked up her first racket at age 13. Her main
practice opponent and doubles partner was her
younger sister.
"The big difference between playing here
and in South America is the lack of competi
tion down there. There's very few good players
to play against." Hill says.
'Not ladylike'
"There's a different sports philosophy for
girls there, too," Hill continued. "It's not con
sidered ladylike to play after you're 15 or 16.
There's only a few people playing after the
14-and-unders."
So, Hill came north for competitions, includ
ing the Orange Bowl International Bowl in
1966 and 1967, and the Junior Wimbledon
Tournament in 1968.
Hill's "really easy to talk to about anything,"
says Varga. "She goes out to dinner with us and
stuff, too."
Even when she's off the courts and out of her
courtside office, Hill says her mind is usually
on the tennis team.
"I've only been home one Sunday all quar
ter," she says."I haven't even had time to play
tennis myself. . . it's just been tennis stuff for
so long."

TENNIS TALK—Women's tennis coach Anne Hill discusses tennis with men's coach Dick
Gould. Hill dedicates much of her time to the sport, although she says she doesn't have
enough time to play the game herself.
"I do things as fast as possible." says Anne
Hill. "I've always been that way.
And she isn't kidding. At 24, she's already
coach of Stanford's women's tennis team.
When Hill was 18, she enrolled at Stanford as a
freshman. Four years later. Hill'was graduated
Phi Beta Kappa in Spanish.
"If 1 had to do things over, 1 might take things
a little slower," she says. "But 1 love all the
things I'm doing now."
Hill says her age is probably one of her
biggest assets to the program. It wasn't too long
ago that she was a Stanford player herself —in
the days before Title IX.
'Old tennis balls'
"We only practiced an hour twice a week,"
she remembers. "We had to use old tennis
balls, we had absolutely no travel money, no
thing."
Hill played first doubles when she was here.
"They had a funny rule then, trying to spread
around the playing time,"she explains. "You
could either play singles or doubles, but not
both."
Her players say they believe that since Hill
was recently in tournaments herself, she's a
more effective coach, even with scholarships
and new tennis balls.
"She knows what we're going through,"
says team member Pat Varga. "She under
stands the pressure we're under."
Hill also notes that her players "each have
different needs. With some 1 need to work on
specific strokes, but others need more help
with the mental part of the game."
'Satisfying'
"It's really satisfying here," she concludes.
"It's easier to see improvement here than at a
tennis club."
Teaching at a club (she was a pro at the
Menlo Circus Club before coming to Stanford)
didn't offer the same rewards, she says.
"People at clubs don't necessarily take les
sons to be good tennis players," she com
mented. "Some do it for social reasons, some to

lose weight."
Not so for her current pupils. In coming to
Stanford, Hill inherited the best, or very close
to the best, women's tennis team in the coun
try. And unless some of her stars run off prema
