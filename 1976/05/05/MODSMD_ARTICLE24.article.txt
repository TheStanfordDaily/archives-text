# Cornett shatters record in pro-am
## 
### David Georgette 
Stanford's Pat Cornett estab
lished a new women's record for
the Stanford Golf Course Mon
day when she fired a seven
under par, 18 hole total of 69 in
the First Annual Stanford Wo
men's Pro-Am.
The tournament was won by
the quintet of Gene Lubfin, Shir
ley Lee, Bobbie Kroopf, Sis
Henry and Rosie Bartlett with a
total of 131. Every group con
sisted of one pro and four
amateurs. Scoring was deter
mined by the two best balls of the
group at each hole.
Cornett's round bettered the
previous record of 71, set in 1960
by both Nancy Downing and
Joann Carner. Women's par for
the couse is 76.
"It was something I was trying
to do the past two years," Cornett
said. "1 figured 1 only had a few
shots left at it."
Earlier chances
Cornett said that she had ear
lier chances to break the record,
but "I've always choked. I've al
ways thought I've had the
capabilities but 17 and 18 always
killed me."
The tournament employed a
shotgun format, which means
that all the groups began play at
the same time, with two groups
starting on each of the 18 holes.
Cornett started at the 17th tee
and parred it and the 18th. She
also carded birdies on one and
two.
Even with the good start, Cor
nett wasn't concentrating on set
ting a new mark. "I didn't start
thinking about it until way la
ter," she said.
Big eagle
An eagle on the 13th put Cor
nett two under the record. She
used a "super par" on the 15th to
get herself out of the rough.
She had almost been forced to
take a two stroke penalty when
she was unable to locate her ball.
She found it only after having
"spent ten minutes looking for
it."
With disaster averted, Cornett
handled the par five 16th with
out any difficulty, even though
she was "kind of nervous."
Cornett tallied six birdies and
one eagle during the record
round.
She said she could have had
even a lower score. "I missed so
many putts it could have been a
lot better."
Pam Palmieri of Stanford also

competed in the tournament,
coming away with a 76. She said
she thought her score was "all
right until I heard Pat's score."
Carroll Diaz, the women's golf
coach, said Cornett's achieve
ment was really significant be
cause "we've had some great
women golfers play that course
and never do as weii."
Cornett broke the record de
spite having had her driver bro
ken between the seventh and
eighth holes. The cart carrying
her clubs wedged the driver
against the side of a foot bridge.
"It didn't look like a very good
day for me then," she said.
The entry fees for the benefit
tournament netted about $4000.
The money will be used to sup
port the women's golf program.
Diaz said she was pleased with
the success of the tournament.
"It was really well planned.
There were only a couple of
hitches." She plans on making
the tournament an annual affair.

Stanford's Pat Cornett estab
lished a new women's record for
the Stanford Golf Course Mon
day when she fired a seven
under par, 18 hole total of 69 in
the First Annual Stanford Wo
men's Pro-Am.
The tournament was won by
the quintet of Gene Lubfin, Shir
ley Lee, Bobbie Kroopf, Sis
Henry and Rosie Bartlett with a
total of 131. Every group con
sisted of one pro and four
amateurs. Scoring was deter
mined by the two best balls of the
group at each hole.
Cornett's round bettered the
previous record of 71, set in 1960
by both Nancy Downing and
Joann Carner. Women's par for
the couse is 76.
"It was something I was trying
to do the past two years," Cornett
said. "1 figured 1 only had a few
shots left at it."
Earlier chances
Cornett said that she had ear
lier chances to break the record,
but "I've always choked. I've al
ways thought I've had the
capabilities but 17 and 18 always
killed me."
The tournament employed a
shotgun format, which means
that all the groups began play at
the same time, with two groups
starting on each of the 18 holes.
Cornett started at the 17th tee
and parred it and the 18th. She
also carded birdies on one and
two.
Even with the good start, Cor
nett wasn't concentrating on set
ting a new mark. "I didn't start
thinking about it until way la
ter," she said.
Big eagle
An eagle on the 13th put Cor
nett two under the record. She
used a "super par" on the 15th to
get herself out of the rough.
She had almost been forced to
take a two stroke penalty when
she was unable to locate her ball.
She found it only after having
"spent ten minutes looking for
it."
With disaster averted, Cornett
handled the par five 16th with
out any difficulty, even though
she was "kind of nervous."
Cornett tallied six birdies and
one eagle during the record
round.
She said she could have had
even a lower score. "I missed so
many putts it could have been a
lot better."
Pam Palmieri of Stanford also

competed in the tournament,
coming away with a 76. She said
she thought her score was "all
right until I heard Pat's score."
Carroll Diaz, the women's golf
coach, said Cornett's achieve
ment was really significant be
cause "we've had some great
women golfers play that course
and never do as weii."
Cornett broke the record de
spite having had her driver bro
ken between the seventh and
eighth holes. The cart carrying
her clubs wedged the driver
against the side of a foot bridge.
"It didn't look like a very good
day for me then," she said.
