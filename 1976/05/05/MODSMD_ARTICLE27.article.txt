## QB III enters final season 
### Jeff Parietti 
Another spring football practice ended
.ast weekend, culminating with a 24-0
win by the Varsity over the Alumni, and
now it's time to look ahead to next fall's
season.
When Stanford football has been dis
cussed the last few years, most talk has
centered around the continuing saga of
"Who's the Quarterback?" starring head
coach Jack Christiansen and signal cal
lers Guy Benjamin and Mike Cordova.
Like a TV soap opera, the characters
have remained the same and the plot has
stayed predictable.
Of course, Jerry Waldvogel has de
parted for the Cornell Medical School,
but Steve Dils has stepped in to take over
the third string quarterbacking spot.
Perhaps this season will be different.
The word is that Christiansen will select
his No. 1 quarterback before the opener at
Penn State Sept. 11 unlike 1974 when he
waited.
Name one starter
Hopefully then Christiansen will
name one starter this year and stick with
him, unless the chosen one plays himself
out of the job.
California Bears' coach Mike White
handled his quarterback situation fairly
well last season. Whife started Fred Be
sana early in the schedule, but Besana
didn't produce as expected and Joe Roth
took over, almost leading the Bears to the
Rose Bowl.
Christiansen has said both Benjamin
and Cordova can do the job. The pair
have shown the ability to handle the
team. Each was honored last year as na
tional Backs of the Week, Cordova for his
performance against Michigan and Ben
jamin for his efforts against Oregon.
But they also have their problems.
Cordova sometimes has been inconsis

tent in his play, while Benjamin was
hampered by interceptions (six in the
last two games of the '75 campaign).
Benjamin had a higher ratio ot
touchdowns per passes attempted than
did his counterpart, although Cordova
had a lower interception ratio.
Have good sense
No matter whom Christiansen finally
selects as No. 1 man, I hope the coach has
the good sense to pull his starter if he's
not performing well in a game (and not
wait to make the switch after the game is
already out of reach).
Of course, pulling quarterbacks in
volves tinkering with the egos of Benja
min and Cordova, both of whom want to
play. But trying to win the game is more
important and sometimes a change at the
right time can fire up a team.
The sooner the whole quarterback
situation is resolved next fall, the better it
will be for the team overall.
And the team should be a good one.
With 40 returning lettermen, Stanford
should have its best opportunity to go to
the Rose Bowl since its last Pasadena ap
pearance in 1972.
l!p for grabs
The conference race will be up for
grabs, with a possible five team battle
among UCLA, USC, California,
Washington and Stanford.
The Cardinals must get off to a good
start in non-conference play, establish
ing momentum and confidence going
into the league games, unlike the past
three years when the team has won only
three of 12 games against non
conference foes.
The task won't be any easier this fall as
Stanford plays four of its first five con
tests on the road, including games at
Penn State and Michigan.

With only four home games on the
schedule, the Cards will have to show
early that they can win away from Stan
ford Stadium, if they are indeed to be a
viable Pacific-8 title contender.
Key games
The first two conference games could
make or break Stanford's hopes for roses.
The opener is against UCLA in Los
Angeles, and the Cards haven't won their
conference opener the past four years,
dating back to the school's last Rose
Bowl trip.
Dropping the Pacific-8 opener has se
verely affected Rose Bowl hopes and put
the Cards in a hole they haven't been able
to crawl out of in each of the last four
seasons. ,
Thefollowing week, Stanford will face
the tough Washington Huskies, a vastly
improved team in 1975 under Don James.
USC comes later and the Trojans have
Heisman Trophy candidate Ricky Bell
returning. According to one pro scout,
the USC squad is loaded with talent.
Title shot
With Stanford's talent and experience,
1 think theCardshaveanexcellent shotat
the Pacific-8 title. Winning the title,
however, will depend greatly on
whether Christiansen can straighten out
the quarterback dilemma.
And it also depends on whether the
coaching staff can motivate players for
the key games.
That important motivation seemed to
be absent in one big. key game that comes
to mind, one against the California Bears
when the Cards got shellacked 48-15.
Let's hope Christiansen uses the sum
mer to solve these problems and, come
fall, is prepared for what could be a very
good year for Stanford football and fr r
Stanford fans.
