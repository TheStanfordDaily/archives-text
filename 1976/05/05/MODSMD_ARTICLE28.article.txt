# Long-time fans back Card nine
## 
### Caryn K. Coulter 
Next time a bespectacled
baseball fan in a sun-bleached
hat cites a little-known baseball
statistic, believe him — if he
looks older than 70. Chances are
he's been following Stanford
baseball for more years than
you've been alive.
What's more, any Stanford
baseball fan or player will back
these claims. "There are at least
four or five of them at every
game," says Tom Cuardino. first
baseman for the Cards. It's as
though the program might fall to
pieces without the support of a
certain stalwart squad of fans.
And they're not even Stanford
alums.
James "Woody" Woodside,
83, has missed few workouts and
even fewer home games in his
history as Stanford's most loyal
baseball fan. Woody even travel
led with the team to Omaha for
the College World Series in
1967.
John "Andy" Anderson. 72,
says he's only missed six home
games since World War 11.
No interruptions
Woody wouldn't allow any in
terruption of his concentration
during Saturday's game against
USC, asserting, "We've been
waiting a long time for this!"
After both teams had left the
field and the stands were empty.
Woody agreed to talk for awhile,
claiming, "I know as much
baseball as any coach."
Woody once attended a local
coaches' meeting at the invita
tion of then Stanford baseball
coach and now IM director,
Dutch Fehring. "And you know
what?" Woody asked. "I've
never met a finer group of men.
Because they have one thing in
common — baseball — a good
boy becomes a better boy when
he plays baseball."
Woody's wife accompanied
him to the game. She explains
his Stanford baseball instinct as
a sort of "paternal" loyalty. A
grandmother of five, she notes
his Cardinal consciousness,
"I've tried to get him to wear one
of those straw sun hats, but

somehow he always manages to
find an old, red baseball hat."
Woody, who retired 18 years
ago after 50 years as a salesman,
has a simple philosophy on life.
"There's only one prerequisiteto
good salesmanship," he said.
"You've just got to love people,"
because "love is the greatest
thing in life. That's why these
boys are out here, because they
love baseball."
Lauds Woody
Andy Anderson, a gregarious
member of the squadron, also
lauds Woody's dedication. Stan
ford baseball teams are "all he
lives for," Andy explained, hint
ing of personal fondness. "He
lives with 'em."
Woody plays the game from
the stands. "You gotta be think
ing all the time when you play
this game," said the baseball
diehard. He could only think of
one other game which required
as much thought — chess.
Woody and the rest of the
squadron all share backgrounds
in athletics. Woody played street
baseball in San Francisco as a
youngster, his wife explained,
lie also claims to have hiked the
7V2-mile "Dipsea Trail" 500
times in 15 years to visit his
wife-to-be and her friends at the
beach.
Andy is a former tennis
champion of Topeka, Kansas. He
also played on a championship
basketball team for Washburn
College in 1925. Now he gains
entrance to all Stanford athletic
events with a complimentary
season pass, courtesy of the Ath
letic Department, as do some of
his cohorts.
They're full of stories, full of
warmth, and full of life. If you
havea questionabout baseball —
or about anything else for that
matter — they'll have an answer
for you. (They may also suggest
that you get your hair cut.)
Charmers? You better believe
it. When Heidi Munzinger,
baseball statistician, told Woody
she thought she could trust him,
he replied, "Don't trust me,
Heidi — lotsa girls used to make
that mistake!"
