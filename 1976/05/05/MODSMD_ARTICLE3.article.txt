# Thomas attacks sex policy
## Cites 'social intolerance' on campus 
### Lori Matsukawa 
If the University adopts the Human
Rights Policy proposed by the Gay
People's Union (GPU) the action
"would perhaps show that the Univer
sity is supportive of gay students and
could lessen the social intolerance
present on the campus." said GPU
Community Relations Coordinator
Richard Thomas last night.
"I've been trying to get information
from the University about any kind of
non-discrimination policy of any kind
and have received no response. To my
understanding there is no policy on

students," said Thomas on KZSU's
Campus Conference.
"The only policy that exists based
on sexual orientation is in the USE
(United Stanford Employees) contract,
which says that the University can not
discriminate against employes in the
union," said Thomas.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
had called the human rights proposal a
"laundry list." The GPU Policy prop
osed that the University not discrimi
nate against students because of race,
sex, sexual orientation, age. religion,
national origin or physical disability.
No evidence
Lyons had told Thomas that he had
seen no evidence of such discrimina
tion at the University and therefore
such a policy may not be necessary
here.
"1 don't think the argument that
there has been no actual act of dis
crimination is necessarily a good ar
gument," said Thomas.
"The purpose of adopting such a
proposal is more than just to prevent
acts of discrimination but also to les
sen the fear of discrimination. Gay
students fear not only the actual act of
discrimination, but the threat of dis
crimination. They see it as a threat to
their freedom of expression."
Asked whether the act of stating a
policy with no problem present
"smacks of the federal government"
course of action, Thomas replied, "but
there is a problem. He (Lyons) defined
a problem as an actual act of discrimi
nation but I see the problem as being,
at least in the case of gay students, that
they must lead double lives because of
a fear of social intolerance and dis
crimination."
Thomas noted that there are 25 cities
and three counties that have non
discriminatory policies, as well as
schools such as New York State Uni
versity College, Columbia Teacher's
College, the USC Law School and San
Diego State University.
Thomas said he did not think that
those policies were instituted by ac
tual acts of discrimination but by the

recognition that "there is a tendency to
discriminate" in society.
Thomas said the GPU was disap
pointed that the University did not fol
low the Committee on Services to Stu
dents (COSS) recommendation that
recruiters who use the Career Planning
and Placement Center (CPPC) be re
quired to state whether they discrimi
nate against gays.
'Partial victory'
"However, we still see the final ac
tion Dean Lyons took as a partial vic
tory for GPU. It did show the Univer
sity is concerned for gay students and
their needs." he said.
Despite an often brisk and blunt cor
respondence between Lyons and him
self, Thomas said relations between
the GPU and the administration are
"generally good".
Lyons had recommended in a letter
to Thomas dated April 14, 1976 that

the GPU could petition COSS to recon
sider the employer discrimination
matter against next year, "although it
would be unusual for a committee to
do so having just devoted virtually two
complete quarters to this issue."
Said Thomas, "I think it's important
to bring up the issue each year. 1 see
attitudes changing nationally as well
as locally. There will be a time when
all kinds of sexual orientation will be
acceptable and we want to have a pol

icy when people are ready tor it." The
say issue is seen "negatively." he said.
"The freshman dorms (I've spoken
to) were the worst in terms of negative
expressions toward gays." said
Thomas.
"Only in recent years have high
school students 'comeout.' If a student
is proud of his activities on human
rights issues, it would be a good thing
if he could include it on his applica
tion without fearing discrimination,"
Thomas said.
