Senate OKs campaign subsidies
WASHINCTON — The Senate passed and sent to
President Ford yesterday a bill that would open the
way for a resumption of federal campaign subsidies
for presidential candidates.
A key part of the bill is a restructuring of the
Federal Election Commission (EEC) in compliance
with a Supreme Court decision so that the federal
money spigot for presidential contenders, cut off
since March 22, can be turned on again.
But the bill also makes many other changes in
campaign finance law that opponents contend
would undermine the independence of the FEC,
add to the political muscle of labor unions, and
increase the advantages of incumbent officehol
ders.
Ford has said he will carefully review the legisla
tion. a compromise of separate bills previously pas
sed by the Senate and House, before deciding
whether to sign or veto it.
He repeatedly urge Congress just to pass a bill
reconstituting the FEC to comply with the Supreme
Court's Jan. 30 decision that all six of the agency's
members be appointed by the President.
The 1974 campaign finance law, creating the
FEC, provided for appointment of four of the mem
bers by Congress. The court ruled this was uncon
stitutional because the commission performs
executive functions.
Just last week, Ford issued a statement protesting
that Congress was introducing confusion and un
certainty into this year's elections by making many
other unnecessary changes in existing law.
Rabin predicts trouble with Arabs
JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
told Israelis yesterday to gird themselves for politi
cal confrontation with the Arabs as Israeli troops
patrolled the troubled West Bank and the Soviet
Union was reported trying to improve its relations
with Egypt.
The U.N. Security Council scheduled an after
noon meeting in New York at Egypt's request to
take up alleged Israeli atrocities in occupied Arab
lands. Israel planned to deny the Egyptian charges,
and the Palestine Liberation Orlanization also was
expected to take part.
Rabin, speaking in a television interview as Is
raelis began observing the 28th anniversary of their
independence day, said the Palestinian issue and
the question of representation of "terrorist organi
zations" in negotiations will become sharper next
year.
Israeli security forces, in combat gear and ar
mored halftracks, were on top alert to prevent re
newed Arab rioting in occupied West Jordan and
against guerrilla raids in Israel itself. Policeblamed
Palestinians for the explosion of a booby-trapped
motor scooter that injured 30 persons Monday in
Jerusalem.
House overrides child care veto
WASHINGTON — The House voted 301 to 101
yesterday to override President Ford's veto of a bill
providing $125 million to help the states meet new
federal standards for child day care centers.
The measure now goes to the Senate, where a
veto on overriding the veto is expected today.
In vetoing the bill last month, Ford said it would

"perpetuate rigid federal child day-care standards
for all the states and localities in the nation, with
the cost to be paid by the federal taxpayer."
Ford urged Congress to enact his own program
under which states would establish and enforce
their own day care standards.
Ford has vetoed 48 bills and has been overriden
eight times.
The day care centers look after the children of
working mothers and have been cited as a way
women with small children can get off welfare rolls
and into jobs without leaving their children unat
tended.
The House vote on the bill was 33 votes more
than the required two-thirds majority to override
the veto.
The bill would suspend until July 1 a require
ment that child day-care centers, to quality for fed
eral funds, must meet federal standards on staff
persons on hand for children aged six weeks to six
years old. A previous suspension, enacted last Oc
tober, expired Feb. 1.
The staffing requirements range from one child
per staff member for the youngest children to seven
youngsters per staff member for children between
four and six years old.
'Mary Hartman' caught with cocaine
BEVERLY HILLS — In a series of events that
unfolded like an episode of Mary Hartman, Mary
Hartman, actress Louise Lasser went to a boutique
to buy a doll house for a friend and ended up
booked for investigation of cocaine possession.
Lasser, 37, star of the comedy-soap opera televi
sion series, was released on $1631 bond after two
hours in custody Saturday. Municipal Court ar
raignment was set for May 12.
Officers were called to the Rainbow Boutique by
the manager, who complained that Lasser was
creating a disturbance after being refused a per
sonal charge account.
The manager, who declined to give her name,
said Lasser came in about 11 a.m. Saturday and
"wanted to buy a tabletop doll house with mouse
dolls for a friend's birthday."
The bill came to about $100 and Miss Lasser
offered to pay with an American Express credit
card, which the store doesn't honor.
"She said, i'm going to sit here all day if you
don't let me take it,"the manager said. "So she sat
there and told every customer who came in what a
bad place this was and cursed me. I called the
police and said I didn't want to press charges but
just wanted her out of here."
At the police station a routine search of the ac
tress' purse turned up a vial of powder that
chemists said was cocaine.
A district attorney's spokesman said conviction
of possession of cocaine is punishable by two to 10
years in prison but a first offense can be diverted
into a drug education program with trial.
Trains collide in Netherlands
ROTTERDAM, The Netherlands — The interna
tional Rhine Express and a Dutch local trail col
lided head-on yesterday leaving at least 20 persons
dead, five seriously injured and an unknown
number with lesser injuries, police said.
Four persons were believed still trapped in the
Dutch train, whose front coach was crushed as the

trains rammed together west of Rotterdam. There
were no school children among the victims as some
early reports said.
A third train alongside the line was also dam
aged.
Dutch authorities launched an inquiry to estab
lish how the two trains came to be travelling on the
same line in opposite directions.
All the tatalities and serious casualties were
aboard the front section of the Dutch train, police
said.
The Dutch engineer of the express saw a crash
was imminent, reduced speed and jumped from his
cabin police said. He was apparently unhurt.
The local train was travelling at about 36 miles
per hour when the collision occurred, railway offi
cials said. The local's engineer lost a foot in the
accident and was trapped in the wreckage for more
than two hours before rescue workers brought him
out.
Poll supports conditional amnesty
SAN FRANCISCO — A year after the Communist
takeover of Vietnam, Californians' attitudes are sof
tening toward draft evaders and deserters, accord
ing to a California Poll released today.
Fifty-four percent of the people polled feel am
nesty should be granted to draft evaders who accept
public service jobs for two to three years.
That is up from 50 percent in 1974 and 49 percent
in 1972.
Forty-two percent believe army deserters should
receive amnesty with alternate service, up from 37
percent in 1974 and 34 percent in 1972.
Seventeen percent believe deserters should re
ceive unconditional amnesty, compared to 33 per
cent believing they should be punished like ordi
nary deserters with prison sentences.
Twenty-two percent support unconditional am
nesty for draft evaders, up from 17 percent in 1974
and 16 in 1972.
In 1972, 25 percent favored full punishment for
draft evaders, and that climbed to 29 percent in
1974. But that dropped to 18 percent in the latest
poll.
"The trend toward public support for amnesty
appears to reflect a growing belief by many people
that those in exile or underground have already
paid a heavy price," pollster Mervin Field said.
"Former President Richard Nixon's pardon for
any crimes he may have committed in the Water
gate affair and the light sentences given to others
involved in recent business and political wrongdo
ing no doubt also have a bearing on the public's
present mood,"added Field, an independent polls
ter who sells the California Poll to newspapers and
broadcasters.
