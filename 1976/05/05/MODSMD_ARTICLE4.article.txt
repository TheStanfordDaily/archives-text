# Reagan swamps Ford in three primary votes
## 
### 
From the Associated Press
Ronald Reagan won the Indiana
presidential primary election yester
day night, surging ahead of President
Ford in their contest for the Republi
can presidential nomination.
In Indiana, Georgia and Alabama, he
made Ford a three-time loser in a day,
and with that showing took the lead in
committed GOP delegate strength.
Indiana was the big one for the con
servative challenger, and he won it,
gaining 51 percent of the ballots and a
margin of about 14,000 votes, with 84
percent of the precincts counted.
It was narrow, but it was enough,
particularly in the state next door to
Ford's Michigan home.
Thanks voters
"I'm deeply grateful to the voters of
Indiana, Georgia and Alabama," said
Reagan, already in Nebraska to cam
paign for his next test with Ford in a
week.
Ford retired without comment, and
a spokesman said the President is "de

termined to go on and win the nomina
tion as he expects to do."
The President's campaign manager
acknowledged that Reagan had sud
denly gained the advantage of the Re
publican race.
Democrat Jimmy Garter rolled to two
more primary victories, in Indiana and
Georgia, led in the District of Golum
bia, and gained new strength to dis
play to the party's leaders as he seeks
to rally them behind him.
Wallace wins
Alabama Gov. George Wallace led in
his home state primary, as expected.
For the first time, Wallace said he
could support Garter as the Democratic
presidential nominee.
Rogers Morton, the Ford campaign
manager, said Reagan had "a sudden,
and I hope temporary, advantage . . .
"However, I remain convinced that
we have the potential for a first-ballot
victory in Kansas City," he said.
Overall, the incomplete returns from
Tuesday's balloting gave Reagan 115
delegates, Ford only 9. Those figures
could change as the final votes are tal
lied, but Reagan was assured the dele
gate lead.
Count mounts
His nationwide count mounted to
351; Ford has 292. It will take 1130 to
nominate. It was the first time the
former California governor had led in
delegates. Ford does have support
among uncommitted GOP delegates,
but that could be shaken by the Reagan
revival.
Democrat Carter said the President
was in trouble. He also said Reagan
would be a very divisive candidate. "I
just want to make sure that whoever
gets the Republican nomination has to
face me," Carter said. These were the
Tuesday returns, state by state:
Indiana
With 86 percent of the Republican
precincts counted, it was:
Reagan: 288.157 or 51 percent.
Ford: 272,303 or 49 percent.
That translated to 45 delegates for
Reagan and 9 for Ford.The delegates
were apportioned on the basis of con
gressional district as well as statewide
showings.
On the Democratic side, it was no
contest: Carter all the way. He had

353,080 or 68 percent.
Wallace was running second with
76,004 or 15 percent. Sen. Henry M.
Jackson of Washington, who quit the
activecampaign.had 61,104 or 12 per
cent.
That had Carter ajiead for 48
nominating delegates, Wallace for 6,
with 21 uncommitted.
Georgia
With 95 percent of the precincts
counted it was:
Reagan: 113,946 or 68 percent.
Ford: 52,776 or 32 percent.
The former California governor was
leading for all 48 COP delegates.
Carter marched easily through
Georgia. He had 382,780 votes or 84
percent.
That meant all 50 delegates for Car
ter.
District of Columbia
With 45 percent of the precincts
counted, Carter was ahead for six dele
gates, Rep. Morris K. Udall of Arizona
for four, and two uncommitted entries
led. There were no returns on the other
five delegates there.
Alabama
Four percent of the precincts had
been counted in the Republican race
and Reagan led for 22 delegates, with
no returns in on the other 15 seats.
In the Democratic primary, with 39
percent of the precincts counted, dele
gates backing Wallace led for 15 con
vention seats, Carter for one, Fred R.
Harris for one, and uncommitted en
tries for two. There were no returns
counted in the other 17 delegate con
tests.
Ford was unopposed for the 14 COP
delegates from the District of Colum
bia, so there was no need for a Republi
can primary there.
The four-primary night was the first
of six successive Tuesdays that will
feature multiple contests, before the
primary marathon ends on June 8.
Sen. Birch Bayh of Indiana endorsed
Carter on Monday; Sen. Lloyd M.
Bentsen of Texas said yesterday he is
releasing the half dozen delegates he
was able to win in his favorite son
primary race against Carter. Bentsen
said it is obvious Texans went Carter.
