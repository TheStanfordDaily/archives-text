# Under proposed rules
## More charter flights possible 
### Sharyl Van Winkle 
More ASSIJ charter flights and flights to less popular
destinations could result from proposed new charter
flight regulations, according to ASSU Travel Service
Asst. Manager Carolyn Bedford.
There are presently two kinds of charter arrange
ments. Affinity flights, which the ASSU Travel Service
uses, require 30 days advance notice and affiliation
with a group. Travel Group Charters (TGCs) must be
booked 60 days in advance and sometimes cost some
what more than affinity flights, but require no group
affiliation.
The proposal by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB)
would allow all charter flights the most flexible aspects
of both of the present plans: 30-day rather than 60-day
advance signups and no affiliation with a group re
quired. CAB is seeking citizen response to the prop
osal.
"It would definitely be a help to the travel service,"
Bedford said. The proposed rules would make it easier
for the ASSU to fill the popular flights because non-
Stanford students could be allowed sign up for flights

which Stanford students couldn't fill, she said.
This spring, the travel service has already cancelled
two of four scheduled one-way charters for lack of
interest. Another, the June 9 flight to Chicago, will be
cancelled if 30 more people do not sign up by tomor
row. According to Bedford, the ASSU Chicago charter
costs $79, $40 less than the next cheapest kind of flight.
The CAB proposal might give ASSU more competi
tion from charter companies using TCCs. But "our
prices are better than most charter companies," be
cause ASSU is a non-profit agency which only charges
$10 per ticket for administrative services, Bedford said.
"Our dates are perfect for the student," she said. "We
try to allow the most time possible away from Stan
ford," while other companies must cater to a larger
public.
Abraham Van Kempen, director of VVestcoast Stu
dent Travel Counsel, said there will probably be an
increase in low-cost, high-volume domestic charter
flights for persons not affiliated with groups because of
the new regulations.
