# Campus radicals turn traditional
## 
### Jacob Young 
Do campus radicals still exist?
Yes, according to Seth Foldy, a member of the
Alliance for Radical Change.
"The radicals are still out there," Foldy said, but
are channeling their energies into more traditional
areas, such as research, organization and publish
ing.
"ARC includes a wide range of opinions and
interests," he said, pointing out that there is much
individual work now on many issues, including
Senate Bill 1 and "evaluations of political candi
dates' records on repression and foreign policy —
especially imperialism."
Foldy noted that some ARC members are work
ing for Against the Grain, a radical campus news
piiper.
Beginnings
Formed two years ago in an apparent attempt to
conserve and promote the spirit of the early '70s
when the I Jniversitv was often a center of struggles
for minority rights and protests against the Vietnam
War and the military-industrial complex, ARC was
a highly visible group in the beginning.
Sponsoring speeches, meetings and demonstra
tions. the group sought to fight "imperialism,
sexism and racism." But in recent months, ARC has
been silent, causing many to wonder if its energetic
mood, like the spirit of activism, has deteriorated
into a feeling of cynicism and defeat.

Part of the current lull in ARC activity is due to
the tremendous efforts spent on Disorientation
Week, Foldy explained, alluding to the ARC
sponsored series of speeches in January which fea
tured such radical thinkers as Herbert Marcuseand
H. Bruce Franklin.
Apparently, the only project currently being
sponsored by ARC is a lecture series on "The Un
ited States in the World Today: Bicentennial
perspectives,"which is a joint effort with the Stan
ford Workshops on Political and Social Issues
(SWOPSI). The series features various viewpoints
on economics, politics and environmental issues.
Participation
SWOPSI Co-director Andy Parnes said there
have been several ARC members involved in the
project, but added that he was "not sure" if the
group as a whole had participated in planning the
project.
Commenting on the causes for the decline in
student interest in radical issues, ARC member Tim
Cullinane commented that the student body is "in
general much more conservative" than in the past.
He blamed the change in student attitudes on
"the admissions policy of (Admissions Dean Fred)
Hargadon" and the fact that students are "much
less interested in politics and much more interested
in careers."
Foldy said the present student body is "neither
hostile nor enthusiastic" to radical issues and that

it is "very hard to monitor where the student body
is coming from."
50 members
ARC currently has about 50 members, with a
working membership of around 30, he said. The
group has no real structure now, but meetings
"should begin again soon," Foldy said.
He explained that in the past, ARC had a system
of small committees which worked on specific
programs in an attempt to "put collective goals into
action" with "various jobs scattered amongst
people." These groups, consisting of five to nine
people, submitted proposals and recommendations
to the larger group, he said.
ARC has no elected officers; meetings are chaired
by different members on a rotating basis.
What's in store?
The future of radical studies here is not "dismal,"
but "things are going to get worse before they get
better." said Foldy, noting that the University is
currently hiring professors in the physical sci
ences. rather than professors in the social sciences.
The physical sciences "produce students with
marketable skills" in the eyes of the University,
while the social sciences, produce graduates with
"unmarketable" skills, he said.
Foldy said he saw the hiring of Economics Prof.
Donald Harris as a "victory." because ARC. has al
ways been concerned with the University's appa
rent reluctance to hire Marxist professors.

He blamed the change in student attitudes on
"the admissions policy of (Admissions Dean Fred)
Hargadon" and the fact that students are "much
less interested in politics and much more interested
in careers."
Foldy said the present student body is "neither
hostile nor enthusiastic" to radical issues and that

it is "very hard to monitor where the student body
is coming from."
50 members
ARC currently has about 50 members, with a
working membership of around 30, he said. The
group has no real structure now, but meetings
"should begin again soon," Foldy said.
He explained that in the past, ARC had a system
of small committees which worked on specific
programs in an attempt to "put collective goals into
action" with "various jobs scattered amongst
people." These groups, consisting of five to nine
people, submitted proposals and recommendations
to the larger group, he said.
ARC has no elected officers; meetings are chaired
by different members on a rotating basis.
What's in store?
The future of radical studies here is not "dismal,"
but "things are going to get worse before they get
better." said Foldy, noting that the University is
currently hiring professors in the physical sci
ences. rather than professors in the social sciences.
The physical sciences "produce students with
marketable skills" in the eyes of the University,
while the social sciences, produce graduates with
"unmarketable" skills, he said.
Foldy said he saw the hiring of Economics Prof.
Donald Harris as a "victory." because ARC. has al
ways been concerned with the University's appa
rent reluctance to hire Marxist professors.
Do campus radicals still exist?
Yes, according to Seth Foldy, a member of the
Alliance for Radical Change.
"The radicals are still out there," Foldy said, but
are channeling their energies into more traditional
areas, such as research, organization and publish
ing.
"ARC includes a wide range of opinions and
interests," he said, pointing out that there is much
individual work now on many issues, including
Senate Bill 1 and "evaluations of political candi
dates' records on repression and foreign policy —
especially imperialism."
Foldy noted that some ARC members are work
ing for Against the Grain, a radical campus news
piiper.
Beginnings
Formed two years ago in an apparent attempt to
conserve and promote the spirit of the early '70s
when the I Jniversitv was often a center of struggles
for minority rights and protests against the Vietnam
War and the military-industrial complex, ARC was
a highly visible group in the beginning.
Sponsoring speeches, meetings and demonstra
tions. the group sought to fight "imperialism,
sexism and racism." But in recent months, ARC has
been silent, causing many to wonder if its energetic
mood, like the spirit of activism, has deteriorated
into a feeling of cynicism and defeat.

Part of the current lull in ARC activity is due to
the tremendous efforts spent on Disorientation
Week, Foldy explained, alluding to the ARC
sponsored series of speeches in January which fea
tured such radical thinkers as Herbert Marcuseand
H. Bruce Franklin.
Apparently, the only project currently being
sponsored by ARC is a lecture series on "The Un
ited States in the World Today: Bicentennial
perspectives,"which is a joint effort with the Stan
ford Workshops on Political and Social Issues
(SWOPSI). The series features various viewpoints
on economics, politics and environmental issues.
Participation
SWOPSI Co-director Andy Parnes said there
have been several ARC members involved in the
project, but added that he was "not sure" if the
group as a whole had participated in planning the
project.
Commenting on the causes for the decline in
student interest in radical issues, ARC member Tim
Cullinane commented that the student body is "in
general much more conservative" than in the past.
He blamed the change in student attitudes on
"the admissions policy of (Admissions Dean Fred)
Hargadon" and the fact that students are "much
less interested in politics and much more interested
in careers."
