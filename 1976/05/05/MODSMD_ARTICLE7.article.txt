# Alumni funds usage

On being graduated from Stanford in 19651 was
solicited by theStanford Alumni Association fora
lifetime membership.Theplan wasa sensibleone.
with gradually increasing contributions over a
period of several years until the lifetime member
ship fee was reached. By participating in this
program, 1 have always thought that 1 was helping
the University, which unquestionably helped me.
A recent solicitation for the Stanford Annual
Fund, however, and a prompt response to some
questions I asked of the fund director, snapped
me out of my benevolent lethargy. Money donated
to the Alumni Association does not go toward the
development of the University, but rather for
"alumni-related activities and the support of the
Bowman Alumni House."
Well, perhaps that's not so bad. Even if you're
on the other side of the U.S. and are unable to
enjoy the rah rah of Big Came with ye ole alumns,
there are times in your professional career when
the Alumni Associaton can be of real assistance.
This occurred for me recently.
I requested placement assistance from the
Alumni Association — only to discover that they
provide no such service. The University has >«
"career planning and placement center" which
sent me a ream of application forms, reference
forms, sxB index cards, and waivers to fill out
which would shame the most seasoned bureau
crat.
In addition, depending on one's salary, up to
$75 is charged for the privilege of filing this thesis
of forms, plus $3.50 each time the forms are
mailed anywhere, and $15 for the additional

privilege of updating your file. Designations are
given to each applicant, such as "Category 11.
Terminal Graduate Registrants (TGR)," which
sounds like someone who won't need placement
services too much longer.
To eliminate the immediate questions now, let
me hastily add that a TGR is defined by the Career
Planning and Placement Center (CCPC) as fol
lows: "A terminal graduate registrant is a student
who has completed unit registration and certain
residence requirements and who is currently re
gistered as a Terminal Graduate." That should
clear things up.
If you need more information on TGRs, ACUS,
CFEPA, or the CPC (not to be confused with the
CPPC or other similarly-named federal agencies),
contact the CPPC — ASAP. And that's a big 10-4
good buddy.
All of this is to say that I now seriously question
what the Stanford Alumni Association funds are
used for, as well as my own wisdom in donating to
the Association. I want the University, not the
Bowman Alumni House, to grow and develop. 1
would add here that other universities have
alumni placement services, including periodic
employment listings, which are provided at no
charge.
As June approaches, give this some thought.
You only paid for a portion of your education
through tuition and fees. Decide in what manner
it is most appropriate for you to support your
University.
