# Clarifying Israeli problems

It was encouraging to see seri
ous concern for Israel's problems
as demonstrated by Jerry
Lampton's April 2H Daily article,
" Is rael' s fu t ure a ppears b lea k." 11
was unfortunate that this article
contained several inaccuracies.
Lampton's article deserves con
sideration because it attempts to
deal with two of Israel's more
important problems,administer
ing occupied Arab territory and
finding a permanent solution to
hostile relations within Israel.
First, Israel is not a theocracy.
A theocracy exists where priests,
or more generally religious lead
ers, are the rulers of a state. Israel
is governed by laymen, laymen
of several different faiths.
Israel is unusual in that, due to
the land's intense religious sig
nificance to several faiths, re
ligious leaders maintain consid
erable control over their respec
tive communities. Three sab
baths are observed within Israel;
religious holidays and rituals are
practiced by all faiths with no
governmental restrictions on
any community.
Lampton's prophecy of apar
theid demonstrates bad faith and
general ignorance of domestic
Israeli conditions. The present
demographic trends indicate a
leveling off of the Israeli-Arab
birth rate as modern technology
penetrates this community.
This, conjoined with Israel's

commitment not to annex oc
cupied Arab land makes apar
theid within Israel a nonexistent
issue.
Arab territory
Efforts to settle occupied Arab
territory, contrary to Lampton's
impressions, are not official Is
raeli policy and offer only tem
porary delays in the face of a
practicable peace settlement.
Gush Emunim, the Israeli politi
cal group attempting to settle the
West Bank, has enlisted support
from only one sector of Israeli
society although it reflects the
sentiments of many Israelis.
Nevertheless, these efforts are of
relative insignificance in light of
official Israeli efforts to establish
peace, i.e., the recent Sinai ag
reement with Egypt and the
open bridge policy with Jordan.
The Israeli government has
stated repeatedly that all oc
cupied lands are negotiable, ex
cept for a return to the former
unjust administration of
Jerusalem where all Jewish re
ligious sites in Old Jerusalem
were barred to all Jews.
Many factors
Finally, Israel's predicament
does not reduce to an either/or
situation as described by
Lampton. Many factors, includ
ing recent political trends in
Egypt, developments in the on
going Lebonese crisis, and con
sequences of Israel's recent tax

reorganization, will contribute
to the character of Israel's future.
No individual set of factors,
particularly those inaccurately
stated by Lampton, will deter
mine Israel's prospects or
policies. Peace can come to the
Middle East via several routes,
each beginning with recognition
of Israel's right to exist and the
realization that such a peace will
require sacrifices by all parties
involved.

unjust administration of
Jerusalem where all Jewish re
ligious sites in Old Jerusalem
were barred to all Jews.
Many factors
Finally, Israel's predicament
does not reduce to an either/or
situation as described by
Lampton. Many factors, includ
ing recent political trends in
Egypt, developments in the on
going Lebonese crisis, and con
sequences of Israel's recent tax

reorganization, will contribute
to the character of Israel's future.
No individual set of factors,
particularly those inaccurately
stated by Lampton, will deter
mine Israel's prospects or
policies. Peace can come to the
Middle East via several routes,
each beginning with recognition
of Israel's right to exist and the
realization that such a peace will
require sacrifices by all parties
involved.

It was encouraging to see seri
ous concern for Israel's problems
as demonstrated by Jerry
Lampton's April 2H Daily article,
" Is rael' s fu t ure a ppears b lea k." 11
was unfortunate that this article
contained several inaccuracies.
Lampton's article deserves con
sideration because it attempts to
deal with two of Israel's more
important problems,administer
ing occupied Arab territory and
finding a permanent solution to
hostile relations within Israel.
First, Israel is not a theocracy.
A theocracy exists where priests,
or more generally religious lead
ers, are the rulers of a state. Israel
is governed by laymen, laymen
of several different faiths.
Israel is unusual in that, due to
the land's intense religious sig
nificance to several faiths, re
ligious leaders maintain consid
erable control over their respec
tive communities. Three sab
baths are observed within Israel;
religious holidays and rituals are
practiced by all faiths with no
governmental restrictions on
any community.
Lampton's prophecy of apar
theid demonstrates bad faith and
general ignorance of domestic
Israeli conditions. The present
demographic trends indicate a
leveling off of the Israeli-Arab
birth rate as modern technology
penetrates this community.
This, conjoined with Israel's

commitment not to annex oc
cupied Arab land makes apar
theid within Israel a nonexistent
issue.
Arab territory
Efforts to settle occupied Arab
territory, contrary to Lampton's
impressions, are not official Is
raeli policy and offer only tem
porary delays in the face of a
practicable peace settlement.
Gush Emunim, the Israeli politi
cal group attempting to settle the
West Bank, has enlisted support
from only one sector of Israeli
society although it reflects the
sentiments of many Israelis.
Nevertheless, these efforts are of
relative insignificance in light of
official Israeli efforts to establish
peace, i.e., the recent Sinai ag
reement with Egypt and the
open bridge policy with Jordan.
The Israeli government has
stated repeatedly that all oc
cupied lands are negotiable, ex
cept for a return to the former
unjust administration of
Jerusalem where all Jewish re
ligious sites in Old Jerusalem
were barred to all Jews.
