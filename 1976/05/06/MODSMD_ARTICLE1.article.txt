## RAs: Who gets chosen? 
### Philip Feder 
Patty, the RA in a dorm on campus, quit her job because she
couldn't communicate with the other students. She wanted
stereos turned off at 10. She wanted house meetings run
with strict parliamentary procedures. The students rejected
those demands.
Patty (not her real name) had her own ideal view of the
purpose of a house associate (commonly called RA), who acts
as an organizer of student activities and as dorm liaison with the
University.
Patty, a regular undergraduate RA, is paid $1050 while senior
RAs are paid $1350. Graduate students earn $300 more in
either position as an incentive for them to become RAs.
According to one house member, "She (Patty) had a
Gestapo-like impression of how to run a dorm. House meetings
were to be no-nonsense affairs. She told people to stop playing
their stereos loudly when another student complained."
But the student also says that Patty "wanted to cater to the
frosh" with activities and the like. The upper classmen in the
dorm, who were used to organizing activities themselves, had
"big fights" with Patty over who should take charge.
Patty's case is probably an exception. RA s usually don't quit.
However, nearly every student will tell you he has had a bad RA
at least once. And possibly more often than that.
Karen Murray, an assistant dean of student affairs, takes
charge of the whole RA selection process here. Although she
admits that there are problems with some RA s, she believes
that the selection process is "the best available."

"There is not just one archetypical candidate," she says. "You
can't be all things to all people. We want R A s to be around and to
be available. We also want balance and diversity with each
residence staff."
That balance is achieved through an elaborate system of
interviews and private appointments for prospective RA s in the
University's housing network. The Housing Office has set May
24 as the target date for notifying successful RA candidates.
This year there were over 470 applicants for the 164
positions as RA, says Murray. After the initial round where each
candidate is interviewed by a group of three people acquainted
with the housing system (usually current RAs), about 100
would-be RAs are eliminated from the running.
During the second round, individual house fellows choose
their own RA s from the first round. Returning RA s are
exempted from he first round but must be recommended again
by a house fellow if they want to continue for another year.
About one-third of the RA s have been RA s before. Most
RA s who reapply for the position are accepted.
Applicants must fill out a form explaining their interests and
academic work. They also must write three essays and have two
people write them recommendations.
The interviewing process hurt senior Bob Siegel the most in
his unsuccessful bid to be an RA. "It's very hard to select the
right people," says Siegel, who thinks the interview "was done
fairly."
