## RAs: Who gets chosen? 
### Philip Feder 
Patty, the RA in a dorm on campus, quit her job because she
couldn't communicate with the other students. She wanted
stereos turned off at 10. She wanted house meetings run
with strict parliamentary procedures. The students rejected
those demands.
Patty (not her real name) had her own ideal view of the
purpose of a house associate (commonly called RA), who acts
as an organizer of student activities and as dorm liaison with the
University.
Patty, a regular undergraduate RA, is paid $1050 while senior
RAs are paid $1350. Graduate students earn $300 more in
either position as an incentive for them to become RAs.
According to one house member, "She (Patty) had a
Gestapo-like impression of how to run a dorm. House meetings
were to be no-nonsense affairs. She told people to stop playing
their stereos loudly when another student complained."
But the student also says that Patty "wanted to cater to the
frosh" with activities and the like. The upper classmen in the
dorm, who were used to organizing activities themselves, had
"big fights" with Patty over who should take charge.
Patty's case is probably an exception. RA s usually don't quit.
However, nearly every student will tell you he has had a bad RA
at least once. And possibly more often than that.
Karen Murray, an assistant dean of student affairs, takes
charge of the whole RA selection process here. Although she
admits that there are problems with some RA s, she believes
that the selection process is "the best available."

"There is not just one archetypical candidate," she says. "You
can't be all things to all people. We want R A s to be around and to
be available. We also want balance and diversity with each
residence staff."
That balance is achieved through an elaborate system of
interviews and private appointments for prospective RA s in the
University's housing network. The Housing Office has set May
24 as the target date for notifying successful RA candidates.
This year there were over 470 applicants for the 164
positions as RA, says Murray. After the initial round where each
candidate is interviewed by a group of three people acquainted
with the housing system (usually current RAs), about 100
would-be RAs are eliminated from the running.
During the second round, individual house fellows choose
their own RA s from the first round. Returning RA s are
exempted from he first round but must be recommended again
by a house fellow if they want to continue for another year.
About one-third of the RA s have been RA s before. Most
RA s who reapply for the position are accepted.
Applicants must fill out a form explaining their interests and
academic work. They also must write three essays and have two
people write them recommendations.
The interviewing process hurt senior Bob Siegel the most in
his unsuccessful bid to be an RA. "It's very hard to select the
right people," says Siegel, who thinks the interview "was done
fairly."

"l was later told that my recom
mendations were strong, but that
the interview was not quite as
good. He says that the interview
ers may have come out with some
wrong impressions about me.
One interviewer. Darlene
Brinker. who works as an adminis
trative assistant in the Row Office,
says the interview is designed to
find out if the candidate has the
right qualifications for the job.
"I looked for someone with a
diverse background," she says of
her interviewing experience.
That doesn't mean someone
who is just an electrical engineer
but one who could also lead a
seminar or one who has experi
ence in counseling. That person
must be solid about making com
mitments."
Conflict question
An answer to the hypothetical
question, "Would you approve of
buying dope for a house party,"

can help gauge how a prospective
RA would react in a conflict situa
tion. says Brinker. "The idea is to
see if the person can approach the
problem in a mature way.''
Assoc. History Prof. Mark Man
call also frequently asks a
hypothetical question to prospec
tive RAs concerning a conflict
situation. His what would you do
if you found a gay alligator under
your bed?" is probably one ques
tion most RAs wouldn't have to
answer in a real life situation,
however.
But it's the entire interview pro
cess that makes the RA selection
system so arbitrary, says Andy
Leuchter, an RA himself who also
interviewed applicants a few
weeks ago.
"Everyone's conception of what
makes a good RA differs across
the board. Some people recom
mended no one; others recom
mended many," he says.
Leuchter also points out the in

equity involved in the panel which
oversees the results of round one.
That panel knows nothing about
the applicants, and then passes
judgment in an arbitrary way,
Leuchter says.
' Rumors of injustice are ram
pant. In one case, a person was
recommended by all three mem
bers of the round one panel, but
was rejected by a residential edu
cation office review. So the com
mittee that interviewed the candi
date was overruled.''
Balance, diversity
Murray insists that her office will
reject a candidate that is highly
recommended by even the house
fellow if the requirements of ba
lance and diversity are not fulfil
led. She cites "several cases of
ethnic balance and male/female
balance," where candidates were
rejected.
Leuchter also maintains that the
resident fellows are given too
much control over the selection of
RAs. "The recommendations of
the resident fellow are accepted in
nine out of 10 cases," he says.

"So the resident fellow can simply
pick his own friends for the RA
jobs."
However, Murray responds the
house fellows don't interview the
candidates until the second
round, after a number of applic
ants have been rejected. The exis
tence of a pool of prospective
RA s selected by the housing staff
prevents "cronyism" from de
veloping. "All the positions are up
for grabs," she says.
Leuchter says the RA s in Flor
ence Moore House are "hand
picked graduates of the SLE
(Structured Liberal Education)
program. In some cases, outside
people are not even considered."
The Flo Mo program, directed
by Mancall, consists of freshmen
who take nine units per quarter in
house-centered academic en
deavors.
RA disagrees
But Risa Shimoda, an RA in Flo
Mo, disagrees with Leuchter.
"Only eight of 23 RAs in Flo Mo
are involved with Mancall's prog
ram," she says."The rest are

Patty, the RA in a dorm on campus, quit her job because she
couldn't communicate with the other students. She wanted
stereos turned off at 10. She wanted house meetings run
with strict parliamentary procedures. The students rejected
those demands.
Patty (not her real name) had her own ideal view of the
purpose of a house associate (commonly called RA), who acts
as an organizer of student activities and as dorm liaison with the
University.
Patty, a regular undergraduate RA, is paid $1050 while senior
RAs are paid $1350. Graduate students earn $300 more in
either position as an incentive for them to become RAs.
According to one house member, "She (Patty) had a
Gestapo-like impression of how to run a dorm. House meetings
were to be no-nonsense affairs. She told people to stop playing
their stereos loudly when another student complained."
But the student also says that Patty "wanted to cater to the
frosh" with activities and the like. The upper classmen in the
dorm, who were used to organizing activities themselves, had
"big fights" with Patty over who should take charge.
Patty's case is probably an exception. RA s usually don't quit.
However, nearly every student will tell you he has had a bad RA
at least once. And possibly more often than that.
Karen Murray, an assistant dean of student affairs, takes
charge of the whole RA selection process here. Although she
admits that there are problems with some RA s, she believes
that the selection process is "the best available."

"There is not just one archetypical candidate," she says. "You
can't be all things to all people. We want R A s to be around and to
be available. We also want balance and diversity with each
residence staff."
That balance is achieved through an elaborate system of
interviews and private appointments for prospective RA s in the
University's housing network. The Housing Office has set May
24 as the target date for notifying successful RA candidates.
This year there were over 470 applicants for the 164
positions as RA, says Murray. After the initial round where each
candidate is interviewed by a group of three people acquainted
with the housing system (usually current RAs), about 100
would-be RAs are eliminated from the running.
During the second round, individual house fellows choose
their own RA s from the first round. Returning RA s are
exempted from he first round but must be recommended again
by a house fellow if they want to continue for another year.
About one-third of the RA s have been RA s before. Most
RA s who reapply for the position are accepted.
Applicants must fill out a form explaining their interests and
academic work. They also must write three essays and have two
people write them recommendations.
The interviewing process hurt senior Bob Siegel the most in
his unsuccessful bid to be an RA. "It's very hard to select the
right people," says Siegel, who thinks the interview "was done
fairly."

"l was later told that my recom
mendations were strong, but that
the interview was not quite as
good. He says that the interview
ers may have come out with some
wrong impressions about me.
One interviewer. Darlene
Brinker. who works as an adminis
trative assistant in the Row Office,
says the interview is designed to
find out if the candidate has the
right qualifications for the job.
"I looked for someone with a
diverse background," she says of
her interviewing experience.
That doesn't mean someone
who is just an electrical engineer
but one who could also lead a
seminar or one who has experi
ence in counseling. That person
must be solid about making com
mitments."
Conflict question
An answer to the hypothetical
question, "Would you approve of
buying dope for a house party,"

can help gauge how a prospective
RA would react in a conflict situa
tion. says Brinker. "The idea is to
see if the person can approach the
problem in a mature way.''
Assoc. History Prof. Mark Man
call also frequently asks a
hypothetical question to prospec
tive RAs concerning a conflict
situation. His what would you do
if you found a gay alligator under
your bed?" is probably one ques
tion most RAs wouldn't have to
answer in a real life situation,
however.
But it's the entire interview pro
cess that makes the RA selection
system so arbitrary, says Andy
Leuchter, an RA himself who also
interviewed applicants a few
weeks ago.
"Everyone's conception of what
makes a good RA differs across
the board. Some people recom
mended no one; others recom
mended many," he says.
Leuchter also points out the in

equity involved in the panel which
oversees the results of round one.
That panel knows nothing about
the applicants, and then passes
judgment in an arbitrary way,
Leuchter says.
' Rumors of injustice are ram
pant. In one case, a person was
recommended by all three mem
bers of the round one panel, but
was rejected by a residential edu
cation office review. So the com
mittee that interviewed the candi
date was overruled.''
Balance, diversity
Murray insists that her office will
reject a candidate that is highly
recommended by even the house
fellow if the requirements of ba
lance and diversity are not fulfil
led. She cites "several cases of
ethnic balance and male/female
balance," where candidates were
rejected.
Leuchter also maintains that the
resident fellows are given too
much control over the selection of
RAs. "The recommendations of
the resident fellow are accepted in
nine out of 10 cases," he says.

"So the resident fellow can simply
pick his own friends for the RA
jobs."
However, Murray responds the
house fellows don't interview the
candidates until the second
round, after a number of applic
ants have been rejected. The exis
tence of a pool of prospective
RA s selected by the housing staff
prevents "cronyism" from de
veloping. "All the positions are up
for grabs," she says.

resident fellows are given too
much control over the selection of
RAs. "The recommendations of
the resident fellow are accepted in
nine out of 10 cases," he says.

"So the resident fellow can simply
pick his own friends for the RA
jobs."
However, Murray responds the
house fellows don't interview the
candidates until the second
round, after a number of applic
ants have been rejected. The exis
tence of a pool of prospective
RA s selected by the housing staff
prevents "cronyism" from de
veloping. "All the positions are up
for grabs," she says.
Leuchter says the RA s in Flor
ence Moore House are "hand
picked graduates of the SLE
(Structured Liberal Education)
program. In some cases, outside
people are not even considered."
The Flo Mo program, directed
by Mancall, consists of freshmen
who take nine units per quarter in
house-centered academic en
deavors.

Patty, the RA in a dorm on campus, quit her job because she
couldn't communicate with the other students. She wanted
stereos turned off at 10. She wanted house meetings run
with strict parliamentary procedures. The students rejected
those demands.
Patty (not her real name) had her own ideal view of the
purpose of a house associate (commonly called RA), who acts
as an organizer of student activities and as dorm liaison with the
University.
Patty, a regular undergraduate RA, is paid $1050 while senior
RAs are paid $1350. Graduate students earn $300 more in
either position as an incentive for them to become RAs.
According to one house member, "She (Patty) had a
Gestapo-like impression of how to run a dorm. House meetings
were to be no-nonsense affairs. She told people to stop playing
their stereos loudly when another student complained."
But the student also says that Patty "wanted to cater to the
frosh" with activities and the like. The upper classmen in the
dorm, who were used to organizing activities themselves, had
"big fights" with Patty over who should take charge.
Patty's case is probably an exception. RA s usually don't quit.
However, nearly every student will tell you he has had a bad RA
at least once. And possibly more often than that.
Karen Murray, an assistant dean of student affairs, takes
charge of the whole RA selection process here. Although she
admits that there are problems with some RA s, she believes
that the selection process is "the best available."

"There is not just one archetypical candidate," she says. "You
can't be all things to all people. We want R A s to be around and to
be available. We also want balance and diversity with each
residence staff."
That balance is achieved through an elaborate system of
interviews and private appointments for prospective RA s in the
University's housing network. The Housing Office has set May
24 as the target date for notifying successful RA candidates.
This year there were over 470 applicants for the 164
positions as RA, says Murray. After the initial round where each
candidate is interviewed by a group of three people acquainted
with the housing system (usually current RAs), about 100
would-be RAs are eliminated from the running.
During the second round, individual house fellows choose
their own RA s from the first round. Returning RA s are
exempted from he first round but must be recommended again
by a house fellow if they want to continue for another year.
About one-third of the RA s have been RA s before. Most
RA s who reapply for the position are accepted.
Applicants must fill out a form explaining their interests and
academic work. They also must write three essays and have two
people write them recommendations.
The interviewing process hurt senior Bob Siegel the most in
his unsuccessful bid to be an RA. "It's very hard to select the
right people," says Siegel, who thinks the interview "was done
fairly."

"l was later told that my recom
mendations were strong, but that
the interview was not quite as
good. He says that the interview
ers may have come out with some
wrong impressions about me.
One interviewer. Darlene
Brinker. who works as an adminis
trative assistant in the Row Office,
says the interview is designed to
find out if the candidate has the
right qualifications for the job.
"I looked for someone with a
diverse background," she says of
her interviewing experience.
That doesn't mean someone
who is just an electrical engineer
but one who could also lead a
seminar or one who has experi
ence in counseling. That person
must be solid about making com
mitments."
Conflict question
An answer to the hypothetical
question, "Would you approve of
buying dope for a house party,"

can help gauge how a prospective
RA would react in a conflict situa
tion. says Brinker. "The idea is to
see if the person can approach the
problem in a mature way.''
Assoc. History Prof. Mark Man
call also frequently asks a
hypothetical question to prospec
tive RAs concerning a conflict
situation. His what would you do
if you found a gay alligator under
your bed?" is probably one ques
tion most RAs wouldn't have to
answer in a real life situation,
however.
But it's the entire interview pro
cess that makes the RA selection
system so arbitrary, says Andy
Leuchter, an RA himself who also
interviewed applicants a few
weeks ago.
"Everyone's conception of what
makes a good RA differs across
the board. Some people recom
mended no one; others recom
mended many," he says.
Leuchter also points out the in

equity involved in the panel which
oversees the results of round one.
That panel knows nothing about
the applicants, and then passes
judgment in an arbitrary way,
Leuchter says.
' Rumors of injustice are ram
pant. In one case, a person was
recommended by all three mem
bers of the round one panel, but
was rejected by a residential edu
cation office review. So the com
mittee that interviewed the candi
date was overruled.''
Balance, diversity
Murray insists that her office will
reject a candidate that is highly
recommended by even the house
fellow if the requirements of ba
lance and diversity are not fulfil
led. She cites "several cases of
ethnic balance and male/female
balance," where candidates were
rejected.
Leuchter also maintains that the
resident fellows are given too
much control over the selection of
RAs. "The recommendations of
the resident fellow are accepted in
nine out of 10 cases," he says.

"So the resident fellow can simply
