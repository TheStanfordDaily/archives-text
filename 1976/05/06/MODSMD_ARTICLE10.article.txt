Selecting a commencement
speaker and establishing get
together sherry hours for seniors
and Stanford alumni are the top
priority items for the newly elected
senior class officers.
The officers are juniors Mike
Dorsey, Risa Shimoda, Jamie
Grodsky and Dave "Y'all" Treinis.
What we plan to do on Reg
(registration) Day, although we
haven't figured out the logistics
yet, is connect to each senior's
PTR (Permit to Register), a ques
tionnaire asking for suggestions
for a commencement speaker
said Shimoda, a product design
major and house associate at
Mirlo.
"We hope to get a committee
together to get a list of names from
the suggestions. They would
come up with the names of people
the students are excited about
and the administration is excited
about. We would only discuss
those names that both parties
were interested in," said Dorsey, a
history and humanities major and
a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon
(SAE) fraternity.
"It won't be a matter of the
seniors selecting a speaker and

having it rejected," continued
Shimoda. "We would go to the
administration with the list of
names and discuss the pos
sibilities before a certain speaker
is selected."
Grodsky, a history and human
biology major and member of the
women's field hockey team, em
phasized that "seniors do get a
final veto" of the speaker
selected.
The officers said they felt the list
of those being considered for
commencement speaker should
not be disclosed to the student
body.

"We have talked to "Weird"
(Walt "Weird" Spevak, this year's
senior class president) about cer
tain ideas and obstacles that
might come along during the
year," said Treinis, a chemical
engineering major and part-time
lifeguard at deGuerre pool.
"It would be best if we would not
mention the list of names," Treinis
said.
"The only reason is that we
don't want to hurt the feelings of
those who aren't invited to speak,"
said Grodsky.
Dorsey said he saw the matter

NEW SENIOR OFFICERS—The new senior class officers have
formulated plans for next year. The new officers are Mike Dorsey,
Jamie Grodsky, Dave "Vail" Treinis and Risa Shimoda.
as more than hurt feelings. "I think
it would hurt our chances of get
ting the speaker we want if the
invited speaker knew he (or she)
was the second choice."
Sherry hours which would en
courage seniors to "match-up"
with alumni with similar interests
may also be pursued next year.
"Students could take advan
tage of alumni experience in their
chosen careers." said Dorsey.
"We have also considered compil
ing a list of alumni willing to help
out seniors by giving advice in
career decisions."
"It would also be an opportunity
for seniors to meet alumni who
have adopted alternate lifestyles."
added Shimoda.
Other activities
Other activities the officers may
plan include bicycle rides to Zot's.
a Dish Dance at the beginning of
the year (at the radar "dish" near
campus) and a Flea Market in
White Plaza where seniors can
sell their untruckable books and
furniture.
Treinis said this year's seniors
may have a flea market and Dor
sey said the event would definitely
by pursued next year "if it's suc
cessful this year."
Class Day, according to
Grodsky, may be a picnic lunc
heon with faculty members and
seniors. "We hope to have faculty
members at a lot of events." she
said.
The senior class, according to
the officers will include students
who entered as freshmen in au
tumn, 1973 and those who will be
co-terminal students next year. "It
does not include regular graduate
students who are getting degrees
this year," said Shimoda.
Communications between the
officers and seniors will be main
tained through senior representa
tives in every dorm. "It will be simi
lar to the program now. where a
senior in each dorm is responsible
for posting messages," said Dor
sey.
