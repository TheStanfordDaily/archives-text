# Rivers views press, politics

Journalists "are the creators of
the image of government," ac
cording to William Rivers, Paul
Edwards Professor of Communi

The result is that the public re

that is "often highly distorted,"
Rivers said Tuesday night in a

more complex, the reporters are
writing with more suspicion and
greater certainty." But he added
that the reporters still show up at
the congressman's door asking
"Have you got any news today?"
Rivers expressed skepticism
toward investigative reporting,
saying that less goes on than most
people think.

based in Washington, only 14
were checking into Watergate, he
said.
John Haile and Bernie Shellum,
who are studying here under the
Professional Journalism Fel
lowship Program, commented on
Rivers' speech.
Haile, a reporter with The Ten
nessean in Nashville, said the
best investigative reporters can
not obtain an objective view of the
news.
Shellum said the average repor

tical in the past 10 years, but he
did not credit this change to advo
cacy journalism. The advocacy
