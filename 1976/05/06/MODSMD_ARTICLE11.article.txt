# Rivers views press, politics

### Wlliam Sposato 
Journalists "are the creators of
the image of government," ac
cording to William Rivers, Paul
Edwards Professor of Communi
cation.
The result is that the public re
ceives a picture of the government
that is "often highly distorted,"
Rivers said Tuesday night in a
speech at Bishop Auditorium.
Rivers stated that a nummber of
journalistic practices lead to this
distortion. For example, of the
three million people who work for
the federal government, the
press only examines the ac
tivities of the President, a few
cabinet officials and some con
gressional leaders, he said.
The winner of the Walter J.
Gores Award for excellence in
teaching, Rivers said the press
can be manipulated by govern
ment officials.
'MachiaveJN is alive'
"I could be convinced many
times that Machiavelli is alive and
advising congressmen," he com
mented.
Rivers said that news reports
are often shallow, and give only
the official version because many
times the journalist is hurried or
lazy and writes his story using only

the government report.
However, the situation is impro
ving, Rivers said.
"As the government becomes
more complex, the reporters are
writing with more suspicion and
greater certainty." But he added
that the reporters still show up at
the congressman's door asking
"Have you got any news today?"
Rivers expressed skepticism
toward investigative reporting,
saying that less goes on than most
people think.
Watergate
Out of the 2000 correspondants
based in Washington, only 14
were checking into Watergate, he
said.
John Haile and Bernie Shellum,
who are studying here under the
Professional Journalism Fel
lowship Program, commented on
Rivers' speech.
Haile, a reporter with The Ten
nessean in Nashville, said the
best investigative reporters can
not obtain an objective view of the
news.
Shellum said the average repor
ter has become much more skep
tical in the past 10 years, but he
did not credit this change to advo
cacy journalism. The advocacy
school of journalism does not
have a foothold in most of the
news that is written, he said.
Rivers said people should be
wary of the news reports that are
filed on the campaign trail. Haile
said that in many cases, all the
reporters covering a candidate will
gather around the Associated
Press correspondent and will
send in the same story he does.
Shellum, a political writer for the
Minneapolis Tribune, agreed,
saying that the candidate can lead
the reporters to what he wants
them to see.
All three men had harsh words
for in-depth reporting at the local

level.
"In 15 years in the area, I have
never seen an investigative story
in the Palo Alto Times." Rivers
said.
Haile said that on many papers
the youngest and most inexperi
enced persons are assigned to
cover local news, and never have
the time to gain some knowledge
of what they are reporting on.
Shellum contended that part of
the problem is that in small towns,
news editors are friends of other
leaders in the community.
The presentation was one of tne
series of lectures being given by
the Stanford Alumni Association
on "The Anatomy of the Press."
