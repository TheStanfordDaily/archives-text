## Prop. 15: no 
### 
Carolyn Kovacevic

(Second of two parts)
Proposition 15 would shut down
nuclear power in California if two
thirds of the legislature (two-thirds
of both houses) could not be con
vinced that there is "no reasona
ble chance of release of radioac
tive waste or radioactivity to the
natural environment due to "ear
thquakes or other acts of God,
theft, sabotage, acts of war, gov
ernment or social instabilities,"
etc. This means that if just 14 of
our 150 State Legislators aren't
convinced (or aren't available to
vote) they can shut down nuclear
power in California.
Assurance of "no reasonable
chance'' might only be guaran
teed by a power plant which dis
charges absolutely no radioactiv
ity to the environment. Such a
stipulation is neither practical nor
necessary.
What is the incremental in
crease in radiation we're talking
about from operation of a nuclear
plant? If one lived right next door
to the plant for an entire year and
got all of his drinking water from
downstream of the plant dis
charge, he would add about one
additional unit of radiation to the
100-plus units we're all getting
from nature.

In his Daily column
April 15, Rick Greer
refers to nuclear power as
providing "only a small and not
absolutely needed percentage" of
our energy requirements. He's
right about one thing; nuclear
power has not yet become a major
part of our total power production
The similarly proven alterna
tives to nuclear power which are
available to us today are oil and
coal, both of which are considera
bly more expensive and far less
environmentally acceptable than
nuclear power.
The exotic sources of power
such as solar, tidal, wind, fusion,
etc., are today at the stage of de
velopment the nuclear power
program was in the 19505. If they
prove acceptably safe and
economical, they'll be ready for
the start of the next century.
As I see it, our real challenge in
the next 20 years is to develop all
of these future sources of power.
We need to work to defeat
Proposition 15 and any other simi
lar legislation which will slow or
halt the continued development of
nuclear power, our cleanest, most
abundant source of safe power.
