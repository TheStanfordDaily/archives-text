SACRAMENTO (AP) â€” Con
trols on coastal development in
California would increase some
prices but would help the state s
economy overall, says a report to
the U.S. Department of Com
merce.
The report, by Real Estate Re
search Corp of Chicago, was re
leased recently by environmental
groups backing legislation to es
tablish permanent state restric
tions on coastal development.
The study says restrictions on
development will drive some
businesses away but attract
others because of the physical
environment, increases in land
value, enhanced recreation and
agriculture, and reduction in urban
sprawl

"It does not cost money to enact
coastal management," John
Zierold of the Sierra Club said at a
news conference.
The study said coastal restric
tions would mean 'California resi
dents and business consumers
may have to bear higher costs
It explained that restrictions on
available development sites
would increase some land costs,
and environmental protections
would increase some production
costs.
On the other hand, the report
said, Califormans would benefit
from stabilized productivity and
price stability for wood products,
agricultural produce, and sea
food, as well as reduced energy
consumption."
