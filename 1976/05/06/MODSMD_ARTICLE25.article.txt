# State to assume malpractice risk?

### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) — All
California doctors could be re
quired to buy their malpractice in
surance through the state under a
Brown administration proposal
unveiled last week.
The plan, endorsed by one doc
tors' group, would establish a
mandatory liability fund if a "sub
stantial" majority of physicians
approved it in a state-wide poll.
Assembly majority leader How
ard Berman (D-Beverly Hills) said
doctors would decide whether
they want a mandatory fund, a
voluntary fund, as his original bill
proposed, or no state fund at all.
A fund would lower doctors' in
surance premiums to an initial av

erage of $4000 a year. Rates
under the mandatory fund would
increase no more than 15 percent
a year, but the voluntary fund
could increase faster.
Neither fund would involve any
state money, Berman said.
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.'s prop
osal for a "medical peace corps
offerng low-cost or free care to the
needy was removed from the bill.
Berman said the proposal is con
tained in separate legislation.
Michael Freilich of United
Physicians of California, which led
this year s Southern California s
doctors' slowdown, said his group
endorsed the Berman bill.
