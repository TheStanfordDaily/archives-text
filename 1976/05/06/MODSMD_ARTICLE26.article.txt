# Good interviews don't clench post

simply aware of the program. And
most of the RA s were not in SLE
before."
While some RAs are involved
in the academic concerns of SLE,
others on campus fit the mold of
the "empty-headed person who
smiles a lot and plays volleyball,"
says one graduate student whose
RA experience stretches over four
years.
The chief trouble with Stanford
RA s are that they want to be one
of the guys," he says."The frosh
are given no perspective of some
one older; it's just down to their
level. You need RA s who bring in
interesting speakers, professors."
One student who has reached
the second round selection pro
cess says that he and everyone
else applying for the RA positions
'are doing it for the money." But
he adds, "I'll be earning the
money if I get a job. When I'm paid
to do something, I'll do it."
Rejected 10 times
Senior Anne Doyle says she
did not apply for an RA job
simply for the money. Doyle, who
was rejected by 10 house fellows
after being accepted into the sec
ond round last year says,"I really
wanted to be an RA, but I was
really teed off that I had gotten so
far and hadn't achieved anything."
The ordeal of going through all
those interviews — each lasting

up to two hours — caused Doyle
to write to RA coordinator Murray
about the inefficiencies of the
selection process.
"I wanted to get rid of the diffe
rent interviewing processes. After
all his, only 50 percent are
reasonably good RA s. Random
selection would produce the same
thing," she says, and take up less
time.
The purported inefficiences in
selection coupled with the feeling
of many students that the RA sys
tem is useless make cases such
as Patty's seem like frequent oc
curences. But Murray insists that

RA s serve a definite purpose in
the housing system.
Row House RA s
"Even in the three-class Row
houses. RAs have the initiation
role in social activities and in resi-
based education prog
rams," Murray says. "They also
serve a counseling function and
act as administrative liaison with
the University."
But former Row (Phi Sig) resi
dent Elizabeth Reynolds says of
RA s on the Row." It depends on
the situation. The job can be use
ful if you have a productive per
son. If not, the job can be done
away with. My RA could have
been eliminated because he
never did anything."
Even when the RA is not
needed to organize social events
—most notably in the fraternities
— he is an important information
source in refering other students
to Cowell, to the Bridge and to just
call home, says Murray.
Yet in the presence of "rip-offs"
by outsiders and internal prob
lems in individual dormitories,
Murray says the University "has

never serious considered having
specified rules for RA s. We (the
University) want to treat students
as adults. We want them to be
aware of different alternatives and
not protected from influence, to
make choices for themselves."
Several schools across the
country, she says, have strict reg
ulations governing RA s. Specifi
cally. RA s may be forced to sign a
contract promising that they will
significantly limit the number of
weekends spent off campus.
Because no such rule exists
here, one can find some R A s who
spend little or no time in the dor
mitory to which they have been
assigned, leading one to suspect
that RA s do not have overriding
importance.
However, junior Paul Edwards
thinks Roble Hall has benefited
from his tenure as an RA there this
year and the record tends to prove
him right.
Edwards directed one play in
the fall, organized a casino night in
the winter complete with side
shows and promises a "festival of
the arts'' this month — all taking

place at Roble.
He admits that he was acceptd
as an RA because of his profes
sed theatrical skills But he has
since felt no pressure by the
house fellow to produce the enter
tainment. "I would have done this
even if I hadn't been an RA. he
says.
RA s also provide entertain
ment for students apart from the
theater. It's common knowledge
that some RA s give away or sell
drugs to students
And in freshman dorms, the
function of an RA as entertainer
becomes important. Freshmen
need to get acquainted with the
Bay Area and to go to San Fran
cisco." says French House man
ager Beth Wagner, a graduating
senior. The RA can help the frosh
get acclimated to college life
