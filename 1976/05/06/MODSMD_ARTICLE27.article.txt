Gov. Moore acquitted
CHARLESTON, W.Va. — Gov. Arch
Moore Jr. and a former aide were acquitted
by a federal jury yesterday of extortion
charges.
The seven-woman five-man jury deliber
ated slightly more than seven hours before
finding Moore and former aide William Loy
innocent of charges of extorting a $25,000
campaign contribution from Theodore
Price, former resident of Diversified Moun
taineer Corp., in 1972.
Price was seeking a state bank charter,
which he never received.
As the clerk in the U.S. District Court
room read the verdict, spectators burst into
applause and cheers. Judge Joseph Young
reprimanded the spectators and then
thanked the jury for its work.
Neither Moore nor Loy looked at the
jurors or showed any immediate reaction to
the verdict.
Senate fails to override veto
WASHINGTON — The Senate yester
day failed by three votes to override Presi
dent Ford's veto of a $125 million child-care
bill.
The Senate vote was 60-34, short of the
needed two-thirds majority to override.
It followed by one day a House vote of
301-101 overriding the veto, 33 more than
the required two-thirds in that chamber.
To date Ford has vetoed 48 bills and has
been overridden eight times.
The measure would have granted states
$125 million to meet new federal child day-

care standards, while delaying implementa
tion of the standards until July 1.
In his veto message. Ford said the legis
lation would "not make day-cace sen/ices
more widely available. It would only make
them more costly to the American tax
payer.''
Ford has urged Congress to enact his
own program under which states would set
and enforce their own day-care standards.
Hostilities cease in Beirut
BEIRUT — The Beirut port area, scene of
heavy fighting for the past week, calmed
yesterday with a new cease-fire, and
street-fighters of both sides emerged from
bunkers to exchange cold drinks, cigaret
tes, crosses and Korans in the buffer zone.
Troops of the Palestinian Liberation
Army (PLA) separated Christian and Mos
lem forces in the capital. However, some
sporadic fighting with small arms continued
in suburbs and nearby mountain towns.
In the port area, a bearded Christian
gunman threw his arms around a Moslem
street fighter in the middle of the debris of
war. "God willing, one day we will sit to
gether and eat together and drink to
gether," he said. "If only the big shots will
leave us alone."
Mao Tse-tung in poor health?
HONG KONG — China's Mao Tse-tung
is frail and in poor health as the result of a
reported stroke suffered some time ago, but

is not senile, New Zealand Prime Minister
Robert Muldoon said yesterday after a visit
to Peking.
Muldoon spent 10 minutes who Mao last
Friday, far less time than the 82-year-old
Chinese Communist party chairman usu
ally spends with foreign dignitaries. Mul
doon said he believed this was because of
Mao's health.
;'There is no doubt he is not healthy," the
prime minister said at a news conference.
A number of American and other foreign
visitors to China in the past year have re
ported Mao to be frail and sometimes to
have trouble speaking, but they said he had
an active and alert mind.
Muldoon said Chinese officials told him
about Mao's stroke, but they did not say
when it occurred except that it was "some
time ago."
