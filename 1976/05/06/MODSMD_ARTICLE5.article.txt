# RA program isn't cheap
## 
### 
Student staff positions in on
campus residences should be a
concern not only of those who
apply for the posts, but of all who
live in the houses. The matter
should concern these residents,
because it costs them plenty.
The University plans to fill some
164 senior and regular House As
sociate (RA) positions for next
year. Regular undergraduate RAs
are to be paid $1050 apiece,
senior RAs $1350.
Graduate students will earn
$300 extra in either post next year
as an incentive for more
graduates to become RAs. Virtu
ally all RAs receive single rooms,
and those with prior RA experi
ence, undergraduates and
graduates, get an extra $100 on
top of everything else.
Assuming a reasonable percen
tage of graduate and experienced
RAs, we can compute the total
cost of the operation at around
$217,000. Except for an amount
paid to graduates out of the Uni
versity's "staff benefits pool" (a
sum estimated at $50,000 by As
soc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton), the entire cost will be
borne directly by those living in
University housing.
Tidy sum
If we estimate 6000 students liv
ing on-campus, each resident
thus should be paying some $25
to $30 next year in direct costs for
the benefit of an RA.
Given this tidy sum, it's high
time the consumers of this sen/ice
took a hard look at what they're
getting for their money.
Few would object to many of the
functions performed by RAs in
freshman dorms, particularly dur
ing fall quarter when contacts are
first being established and stu
dents are generally unfamiliar with
Stanford.
Later, as these freshmen be
come more attuned to Stanford
and aware of the peer counseling
and advising services offered out
side of their dorm, their need for
RAs will diminish. Additionally, as
house governments arise to take

over leadership and administra
tive roles, these tasks as well
should become less a function of
the RA.
React cynically
Indeed, it may be true that the
RAs administrative role and the
amount of leadership by dorm re
sidents vary inversely. When de
sired events and programs are
planned and executed for them,

human beings commonly react
with cynicism and lack of involve
ment.
Trying as a freshman's first
quarter may be, however, the
planned ratio of approximately
one RA for every 20 first-year stu
dents might have merit for those
initial three months. Whether all
those RAs are worth the price for
the remainder of the year is far
less certain.
Equally dubious is the necessity
of placing large numbers of RAs
in four-class houses, and any staff
members at all in purely upper
class residences.
Ninety-person four-class dor
mitories usually contain three-to
four RAs. While it is true that social
interaction is sometimes strained
in such residences, the elements
of leadership and ingenuity to re
medy this situation must exist just
as surely within the house itself as
within the RAs.
And freshmen in four-class
houses can hardly have the de
mand for RAs that they would in
an all-frosh house, enjoying as
they do a slew of upperclass ad
visors living all around them.
Desire independence
Whether anyone in upperclass
complexes such as Manzanita
Park and Mirrielees (five and three
RAs, respectively) has any need

for such staffers, outside of mun
dane administrative tasks, is
questionable. Indeed, many stu
dents choose to live in these hous
ing options because they desire
independence from residence of
ficialdom.
The RA position becomes
most awkward in self-governing
houses such as fraternities or
Columbae. Their residents have
chosen assignment to those
houses for the purpose of partici
pation in its activities.
Leadership in such a situation
falls naturally on the students
themselves; the RA role is often
superfluous.
In some fraternities, RAs may
not only be unnecessary, but are
taking up valuable space which
becomes more precious each
year as mandated over-pledging
quotas have increasing effect.
A job description on the 1976-
77 RA application form calls these
House Associates "social and in
tellectual catalysts" who will
spend up to 15 hours per week
performing their choirs.
Whether the bulk of these staf
fers are meeting either of these
standards, and whether 137 of
them are needed to meet the aims
of the program, are two questions
every rent-paying on-campus re
sident should consider.

Student staff positions in on
campus residences should be a
concern not only of those who
apply for the posts, but of all who
live in the houses. The matter
should concern these residents,
because it costs them plenty.
The University plans to fill some
164 senior and regular House As
sociate (RA) positions for next
year. Regular undergraduate RAs
are to be paid $1050 apiece,
senior RAs $1350.
Graduate students will earn
$300 extra in either post next year
as an incentive for more
graduates to become RAs. Virtu
ally all RAs receive single rooms,
and those with prior RA experi
ence, undergraduates and
graduates, get an extra $100 on
top of everything else.
Assuming a reasonable percen
tage of graduate and experienced
RAs, we can compute the total
cost of the operation at around
$217,000. Except for an amount
paid to graduates out of the Uni
versity's "staff benefits pool" (a
sum estimated at $50,000 by As
soc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton), the entire cost will be
borne directly by those living in
University housing.
Tidy sum
If we estimate 6000 students liv
ing on-campus, each resident
thus should be paying some $25
to $30 next year in direct costs for
the benefit of an RA.
Given this tidy sum, it's high
time the consumers of this sen/ice
took a hard look at what they're
getting for their money.
Few would object to many of the
functions performed by RAs in
freshman dorms, particularly dur
ing fall quarter when contacts are
first being established and stu
dents are generally unfamiliar with
Stanford.
Later, as these freshmen be
come more attuned to Stanford
and aware of the peer counseling
and advising services offered out
side of their dorm, their need for
RAs will diminish. Additionally, as
house governments arise to take

over leadership and administra
tive roles, these tasks as well
should become less a function of
the RA.
React cynically
Indeed, it may be true that the
RAs administrative role and the
amount of leadership by dorm re
sidents vary inversely. When de
sired events and programs are
planned and executed for them,

human beings commonly react
with cynicism and lack of involve
ment.
Trying as a freshman's first
quarter may be, however, the
planned ratio of approximately
one RA for every 20 first-year stu
dents might have merit for those
initial three months. Whether all
those RAs are worth the price for
the remainder of the year is far
less certain.
Equally dubious is the necessity
of placing large numbers of RAs
in four-class houses, and any staff
members at all in purely upper
class residences.

mitories usually contain three-to
