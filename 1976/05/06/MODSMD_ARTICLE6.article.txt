## SF bus drivers to end walkout? 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Bus
drivers voted last night to return to
work if the San Francisco Board of
Supervisors meets two crucial
conditions in the 35-day-old strike
by city workers.
If the governing supervisors
agree to remove two anti-labor
measures from the June 8 ballot
and to resume negotiations with
striking unions, bus drivers will go
back on the job immediately, the
leader of their union said.
Larry Martin, head of the trans
port union, said the back-to-work
proposal, supported by the
Laborers Union was approved by
a 2-1 ratio. About 1000 drivers
voted.
Martin said a sister union repre
senting mechanics for diesel
fueled buses would go back to
work if the drivers did. He added
that supervisory personnel could
service streetcars and trolleys.
If supervisors agreed to the
conditions, Martin said, "we'd go
back to work right away."
Bus drivers had voted on three
earlier occasions to honor picket
lines set up by the city's 1800 strik
ing crafts union members.
Quentin Kopp. president of the
Board of Supervisors, had said
earlier that the board would give
serious consideration to removing
Propositions E and K from the bal
lot and resume negotiations that
broke off last week if there were
substantial restoration of city ser
vices.
The vote came amid indications
that labors united front appeared

to be crumbling.
The lack of buses, trolleys and
cable cars used by 250,000 daily
riders, has had the most signific
ant impact of the aging walkout.
The idled public transit has
forced 10.000 junior and senior
high school students to stay home
from school or find other ways of
getting to class.
