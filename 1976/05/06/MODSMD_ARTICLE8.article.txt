# Ottilie holds on to IFC presidency

### Stephen Crolius 
A motion requesting the resig
nation of Inter-Fraternity Council
President Bob Ottilie was de
feated by a vote of 6-4 with one
abstention at yesterday's IFC
meeting.
A motion reprimanding Ottilie
was defeated 6-5.
Both motions arose from a dis
pute concerning a letter Ottilie
sent during the recent ASSU
Council of Presidents (COP) elec
tion.
Ottilie has said the letter was a
personal one paid for without IFC
funds.
The letter, which Ottilie calls "an
endorsement of Vic Petroff and
not an attack against Dan How
ard," provoked Theta Xi's anger
for a number of reasons, the three
Theta Xi representatives at the
meeting said.
Reasons
One reason, they said, was Ot
tilie's use of his title. IFC presi
dent, under his signature. Other
reasons were his failure to deliver
a copy of the letter to the Theta Xi
house, his failure to identify How
ard as an active Theta Xi member
and his failure to state explicitly
that the letter was not an IFC en
dorsement.
Theta Xi member Mike Wil
liamson stated that the members
of Theta Xi found Ottilie's letter
"the ultimate abuse of his office"
and called Ottilie's failure to de
liver the letter to Theta Xi "a very
cowardly act."
Jeff Dykes, also a member of
Theta Xi, called the letter "the last
straw," saying the letter was the
most recent in a "string of things"
objectionable to the members of
Theta Xi.
He said Ottilie's actions as IFC
president this year have created a
"non-representative" image of the
IFC and that "Bob has caused

tremendous damage to the frater
nity system as a whole."
Standard practice
John Butterfield, a member of
Beta Theta Pi (Betas), defended
Ottilie s use of his title, as being
standard practice for individuals
giving endorsements.
Phi Delta Theta President Chad
Huston said that he did not feel
Ottilie's resignation was "neces
sary,; and stated "I think asking for
his resignation now is an insult to
some one who has put in a lot of
time" working for the fraternity
system.
Ottilie defended the letter as
"an honest attempt to show what
he (Howard) is . . . and how he
would be detrimental to the frater
nity system."

He said his mention of three
groups which endorsed the How
ard slateâ€”Columbae House, the
Gay People's Union (GPU) and
the radical newspaper Against
the Grain, was an attempt to
clarify Howard's "ideology."
"This (the mention of the
groups) tells you who agrees with
the guy,'' he said.
Ottilie said the letter was his
"honest attempt as IFC president
to support some one who will help
us next year.
The meeting ended with the
passage of a motion directing that
henceforth the statement of an
IFC president should not be con
strued as a statement of IFC pol
icy.
