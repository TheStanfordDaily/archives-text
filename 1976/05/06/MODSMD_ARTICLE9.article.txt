Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
Rush Chairman Tim Ferguson
confirmed last night that the
fraternity system will exceed its
imposed housing quota in spring
rush this year, but that three
houses will almost definitely not
meet their individual marks.
Ferguson declined to name for
publication the three houses.
However telephone calls to
fraternities last night revealed the
three as Theta Xi, Alpha Delta Phi
and Delta Tau Delta.
Earlier yesterday, Ferguson's
preliminary rush figures showed
three other houses also under
their quotas —Delta Kappa Epsi
lon, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and
Sigma Chi.
Figures obtained from calls last
night showed that Delta Kappa
Epsilon met its requirement, but
Kappa Sigma did not.
Pledges
Except for Theta Xi. Alpha Delta
Phi and Delta Tau Delta, all other
frats said last night they expect to
pledge enough men by the end of
this week to meet or exceed their

quotas.
Ferguson told the IFC at its
meeting yesterday that the frater
nity system as a whole should
"exceed (its) quota this spring by
10 to 20 pledges.
"We're in excellent shape." he
commented.
Ferguson added last night that
since the fraternity system as a
whole will meet its quota, houses
that come within 10 percent of
meeting individual requirements
will not be penalized.
Another fraternity?
In other matters discussed at
the meeting, IFC President Bob
Ottilie reported that three national
fraternities are "very interested" in
establishing houses here.
He said that ' one or two of
these three may be willing to come
in and put down the money'' to
build a new fraternity house
The IFC's position on next
year's Big Game Bonfire was also
discussed. It was decided that the
IFC would not take a stand until
student body opinion has been
ascertained
