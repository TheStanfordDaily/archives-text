Returnable
not just recyclable.
Buffalo talks turkey about the energy crisis!
Recycling the world's resources is important. The last few years have
proved that. It's beyond argument. That's why Buffalo Beer makes
its cans of recyclable metal that can be collected directly at trash
disposal sites.
But there's more to ecology than just recycling. Because recycling
takes energy; often just as much energy as the original manufacturing
process.
Buffalo has a better way!
That's why Buffalo believes in returnable bottles. Bottles that can be
re-used after sterilization and purification processes. Bottles that
don't add to America's energy drain.
Buffalo Beer started with returnable bottles. jjHPpWW
And we still believe it's the best way to save OTjjLaJP
energy. If you still prefer cans, Buffalo cans
are recyclable. And we realize there are
some occasions when cans are just naturally
But use returnable bottles when you can.
After all, when you have a glass of beer at /*• 112 flB&A
home, you don't throw away the glass! /
Buffalo. Buy it by the herd!
