IN THE NATION THIS WEEK
" For more than 100 years The Nation has stood
for consistency, honesty and idealism. It's roots
run deep in the experience of America's poor and
dispossessed. More than one generation of farm
workers have drawn encouragement and inspir
ation from its steadfast defence of the farm
workers' cause. We believe in The Nation and in
the high ideals it has always upheld. The Nation
embodies what Ghandi taught: 'In a gentle way
you can shake the world'".
Ceasar Chavez
