Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences
Dept. Secretary Barbara Honegger has
been awarded approximately $2250 in
back pay after a three month grievance
hearing arbitrated by the University,
according to Asst. to the Vice Presi
dent for Medical Affairs Peter Car
penter.
After making the decision to meet
most of the demands in Honegger's
grievance, Carpenter called the hear
ing, which ended last Wednesday,
"one of the more lengthy staff grie
vances in University history."
Honegger filed her grievance with
the University on Nov. 24 maintaining
that when she was hired her boss,
Psychiatry and Psychology Prof. Karl
Pribram, downgraded her status to the
Secretary II" level, approximately
$100 less per month than the "Secret
ary III" level at which she claims she
was previously working.
Extensive overtime
. In addition, she charged that Prib
ram refused to pay for the extensive
overtime hours she worked.
Carpenter's decision was directed
solely at Honegger's grievance con
cerning unpaid back salary and did not
include any action on an alleged at
tack and beating by Pribram on Oct. 29,
1975.
She has filed a separate assault and
battery grievance with the University
which has not yet been heard.
Honegger also filed a civil suit on
Dec. 17, 1975 asking frn $2500 in gen
eral damages, $2500 in punitive dam
ages and $47.53 in medical damages
stemming from the alleged beating. No
court date has been set.
Of the $2250 compensation awarded
in the back pay grievance, approxi
mately $1800 will cover work Honeg
ger did as a "Secretary II" when she
should have been paid as a "Secretarv
III".
The remaining $450 will be paid for
0;?.5 hours of overtime which Car
penter found was due her.
'Properly protected'
"I am satisfied that the interest of the
employe was properly protected and
that a fair and impartial decision was
reached," Carpenter said.
Honegger's grievance representa
tive. Librarian Lise Ciraud, echoed
Carpenter's evaluation of the hearing
saying, "It was an eminently fair deci
sion. I'm happy to see justice
triumph."
In addition to theback paycompen
sation. Carpenter ruled that a series of
three memos placed in Honegger's

personnel file by Pribram without her
knowledge be removed.
Honegger claims the "clandestine"
memos were detailed criticisms of her
work down "to the last typo" and were
placed in her file to "falsely discredit
her." _
'Insubordinate act
She said the memos were written
"after 1 filed a reclassification request
with Personnel, which Dr. Pribram
considered an insubordinate act."
The memos were delivered by Prib
ram to Administrative Services Man
ager Hazel Eickworth who typed and
filed them without Honegger's know
ledge.
University policy dictates that all
memos regarding employe perfor
mance must be signed by both the
supervisor who writes the memo and
the employe about whom the memo is
written before the memo is filed, ac
cording to Honnegger.
Part of the unofficial transcript*
which Honegger transcribed herself
during the hearing reads:
"Honegger: What did Dr. Pribram
want to do (with the memos)?
"Eickworth: He wanted your dis
missal.
"Honegger: I see. Were you aware
that I had never seen any of these
memos?
"Eickworth: No. The purpose of the
memos was not clear to me. I had no
way of knowing. Dr. Pribram brought
them over to be typed. He took them
back with him so I probably assumed
he showed them to you. I never asked
him."
Adverse impact
Carpenter decided to remove the
memos from Honegger's file to "pre
clude the remote possibility that they
might have a future adverse impact "
on her.
During a later hearing Pribram was
confronted with the issue of the
memos, according to Honegger:
"Honegger: What did you hope to
accomplish by these secret memos?
"Pribram: I don't have to justify any
thing. I was told to keep these records.
Hazel Eickworth said she (Honegger)
was a 'trouble maker' and that we
couldn't fire her unless we compiled a
file on her."
Pribram was further questioned
about the legality of placing memos in
an employe's file without his or her
knowledge, Honegger said:
"Honegger: As Stanford's represen
tative, as you have stated many places
in your memos of which we all have
copies, did you believe you should be
aware of laws, policies, etc. vis-a-vis

your employes?
"Pribram: Certainly not. Legalities
are irrelevant.
"Giraud: Does that imply you ex
pected your secretary to know all this
and apply the rules for you?
"Pribram: You don't understand.
I'm in Psychiatry. Over there they all
have secretaries. There's a legitimate
way of proceeding with things. I went
to my department head to ask such
questions."
Neither Pribram nor Eickworth were
available for comment yesterday.

written before the memo is filed, ac
cording to Honnegger.
Part of the unofficial transcript*
which Honegger transcribed herself
during the hearing reads:
"Honegger: What did Dr. Pribram
want to do (with the memos)?
"Eickworth: He wanted your dis
missal.
"Honegger: I see. Were you aware
that I had never seen any of these
memos?
"Eickworth: No. The purpose of the
memos was not clear to me. I had no
way of knowing. Dr. Pribram brought
them over to be typed. He took them
back with him so I probably assumed
he showed them to you. I never asked
him."
Adverse impact
Carpenter decided to remove the
memos from Honegger's file to "pre
clude the remote possibility that they
might have a future adverse impact "
on her.
During a later hearing Pribram was
confronted with the issue of the
memos, according to Honegger:
"Honegger: What did you hope to
accomplish by these secret memos?
"Pribram: I don't have to justify any
thing. I was told to keep these records.
Hazel Eickworth said she (Honegger)
was a 'trouble maker' and that we
couldn't fire her unless we compiled a
file on her."
Pribram was further questioned
about the legality of placing memos in
an employe's file without his or her
knowledge, Honegger said:
"Honegger: As Stanford's represen

in your memos of which we all have
copies, did you believe you should be
aware of laws, policies, etc. vis-a-vis

your employes?
"Pribram: Certainly not. Legalities
are irrelevant.

Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences
Dept. Secretary Barbara Honegger has
been awarded approximately $2250 in
back pay after a three month grievance
hearing arbitrated by the University,
according to Asst. to the Vice Presi
dent for Medical Affairs Peter Car
penter.
After making the decision to meet
most of the demands in Honegger's
grievance, Carpenter called the hear
ing, which ended last Wednesday,
"one of the more lengthy staff grie
vances in University history."
Honegger filed her grievance with
the University on Nov. 24 maintaining
that when she was hired her boss,
Psychiatry and Psychology Prof. Karl
Pribram, downgraded her status to the
Secretary II" level, approximately
$100 less per month than the "Secret
ary III" level at which she claims she
was previously working.
Extensive overtime
. In addition, she charged that Prib
ram refused to pay for the extensive
overtime hours she worked.
Carpenter's decision was directed
solely at Honegger's grievance con
cerning unpaid back salary and did not
include any action on an alleged at
tack and beating by Pribram on Oct. 29,
1975.
She has filed a separate assault and
battery grievance with the University
which has not yet been heard.
Honegger also filed a civil suit on
Dec. 17, 1975 asking frn $2500 in gen
eral damages, $2500 in punitive dam
ages and $47.53 in medical damages
stemming from the alleged beating. No
court date has been set.
Of the $2250 compensation awarded
in the back pay grievance, approxi
mately $1800 will cover work Honeg
ger did as a "Secretary II" when she
should have been paid as a "Secretarv
III".
The remaining $450 will be paid for
0;?.5 hours of overtime which Car
penter found was due her.
'Properly protected'
"I am satisfied that the interest of the
employe was properly protected and
that a fair and impartial decision was
reached," Carpenter said.
Honegger's grievance representa
tive. Librarian Lise Ciraud, echoed
Carpenter's evaluation of the hearing
saying, "It was an eminently fair deci
sion. I'm happy to see justice
triumph."
In addition to theback paycompen
sation. Carpenter ruled that a series of
three memos placed in Honegger's

personnel file by Pribram without her
knowledge be removed.
Honegger claims the "clandestine"
memos were detailed criticisms of her
work down "to the last typo" and were
placed in her file to "falsely discredit
her." _
'Insubordinate act
She said the memos were written
"after 1 filed a reclassification request
with Personnel, which Dr. Pribram
considered an insubordinate act."
The memos were delivered by Prib
ram to Administrative Services Man
ager Hazel Eickworth who typed and
filed them without Honegger's know
ledge.
University policy dictates that all
memos regarding employe perfor
mance must be signed by both the
supervisor who writes the memo and
the employe about whom the memo is
written before the memo is filed, ac
cording to Honnegger.

Secretary II" level, approximately
$100 less per month than the "Secret
ary III" level at which she claims she
was previously working.
Extensive overtime
. In addition, she charged that Prib
ram refused to pay for the extensive
overtime hours she worked.
Carpenter's decision was directed
solely at Honegger's grievance con
cerning unpaid back salary and did not
include any action on an alleged at
tack and beating by Pribram on Oct. 29,
1975.
She has filed a separate assault and
battery grievance with the University
which has not yet been heard.
Honegger also filed a civil suit on
Dec. 17, 1975 asking frn $2500 in gen
eral damages, $2500 in punitive dam
ages and $47.53 in medical damages
stemming from the alleged beating. No
court date has been set.
Of the $2250 compensation awarded
in the back pay grievance, approxi
mately $1800 will cover work Honeg
ger did as a "Secretary II" when she
should have been paid as a "Secretarv
III".
The remaining $450 will be paid for
0;?.5 hours of overtime which Car
penter found was due her.
'Properly protected'
"I am satisfied that the interest of the
employe was properly protected and
that a fair and impartial decision was
reached," Carpenter said.
Honegger's grievance representa
tive. Librarian Lise Ciraud, echoed
Carpenter's evaluation of the hearing
saying, "It was an eminently fair deci
sion. I'm happy to see justice
triumph."
In addition to theback paycompen
sation. Carpenter ruled that a series of
three memos placed in Honegger's

personnel file by Pribram without her
knowledge be removed.
Honegger claims the "clandestine"
memos were detailed criticisms of her
work down "to the last typo" and were
placed in her file to "falsely discredit
her." _
'Insubordinate act
She said the memos were written
"after 1 filed a reclassification request
with Personnel, which Dr. Pribram
considered an insubordinate act."
The memos were delivered by Prib
ram to Administrative Services Man
ager Hazel Eickworth who typed and
filed them without Honegger's know
ledge.
University policy dictates that all
memos regarding employe perfor
mance must be signed by both the
supervisor who writes the memo and
the employe about whom the memo is
written before the memo is filed, ac
cording to Honnegger.
Part of the unofficial transcript*
which Honegger transcribed herself
during the hearing reads:
"Honegger: What did Dr. Pribram
want to do (with the memos)?
"Eickworth: He wanted your dis
missal.
"Honegger: I see. Were you aware
that I had never seen any of these
memos?
"Eickworth: No. The purpose of the
memos was not clear to me. I had no
way of knowing. Dr. Pribram brought
them over to be typed. He took them
back with him so I probably assumed
he showed them to you. I never asked
him."
Adverse impact
Carpenter decided to remove the
memos from Honegger's file to "pre
clude the remote possibility that they
might have a future adverse impact "
on her.
During a later hearing Pribram was
confronted with the issue of the
memos, according to Honegger:
"Honegger: What did you hope to
accomplish by these secret memos?
"Pribram: I don't have to justify any
thing. I was told to keep these records.
Hazel Eickworth said she (Honegger)
was a 'trouble maker' and that we
couldn't fire her unless we compiled a
file on her."
Pribram was further questioned
about the legality of placing memos in
an employe's file without his or her
knowledge, Honegger said:
"Honegger: As Stanford's represen
tative, as you have stated many places
in your memos of which we all have
copies, did you believe you should be
aware of laws, policies, etc. vis-a-vis

your employes?
"Pribram: Certainly not. Legalities
are irrelevant.
"Giraud: Does that imply you ex
pected your secretary to know all this
and apply the rules for you?
"Pribram: You don't understand.
I'm in Psychiatry. Over there they all
have secretaries. There's a legitimate
way of proceeding with things. I went
to my department head to ask such
questions."
Neither Pribram nor Eickworth were
available for comment yesterday.
