# Lockheed payoffs implicate CIA
## 
### 
The Lockheed revelations show more
than the personal venality of Lockheed
executives and of officials of more than 15
countries who took bribes to influence con
tract awards. They also tell us about the
dangers to law and democracy that arise
from the cooperation of parallel covert
bureaucracies whose operations are hidden
from public scrutiny by the cloak of "na
tional security."
Lockheed, like the Hughes empire, Ex
xon, ITT and other large multinationals,
maintains its own covert bureaucracy, a
mini-CIA which passes out bribes abroad
and in Washington and gathers worldwide
intelligence. (On at least one occasion,
Lockheed paid a CIA-linked firm in London
for secret information on European business
competitors.)
The power, and potential for abuse, of
Lockheed's bureaucracy is greatly mag
nified by its traditionally close ties to
America's national security establishment.
Most of Lockheed's work is for the Penta
gon, but it also built the U-2 spy plane for
the CIA. Their covert bureaucracies share a
strong community of interest.
The CIA and Lockheed joi ned forces most
blatantly in Japan, where they financed the
local covert network of Kodama Yoshio, a
former Class A war criminal and enor
mously influential leader of Japan's
paramilitary right wing and Tokyo under
world.
Lockheed used Kodama over many years
as an agent to swing Japanese government
contracts its way—in return for more than
$7 million in "fees."
Senator Frank Church accused Lockheed
of pursuing a "corporate foreign policy" of
support to Japan's right wing in opposition
to the position of the United States gover
ment. Contrary, however, to Church's con
tention that the U.S."vigorously opposed"
Kodama, the CIA and Army Intelligence

procured Kodama's release from prison in
1948 and have employed his services ever
since — as a source of high level intelli
gence and an entry into Japanese govern
ment and business circles. Kodama proved
particularly useful in mobilizing strongarm
squads of rightists and gangsters to smash
leftwing demonstrators and organizers dur
ing the 19505.

In 1958,the CIA financed the victorious
election campaign of former war criminal
Kishi Nobusuke, Kodama's close friend and
fellow prison inmate. The next year, armed
with funds from Lockheed, Kodama won for
Lockheed an important contract for anti
submarine aircraft with the Kishi gover
ment.
The CIA almost certainly knew of Lock
heed's payments to Kodama. Most of these
bribes were "laundered" through Deak &
Co., a currency trading firm headed by a
former U.S. intelligence agent and often
used by the CIA for covert currency transac
tions.
Veteran CIA watcher Tad Szulc, on the
basis of this connection, argues in the New
Republic that the CIA used Lockheed to
bolster Kodama and advance U.S. objectives
in Japan. But why not just give Kodama the
money directly? A more likely explanation
is that Lockheed simply appropriated Deak
& Co.'s existing private covert bureaucracy
for its own ends, while the CIA looked on
approvingly.

For Szulc errs in describing Deak & Co. as
a mere CIA front. Thus, at the same time that
Deak & Co. was helping the CIA profit
covertly from blackmarket plaster specula
tion during the Vietnam war (at the tax
payer's ultimate expense), it was also handl
ing similar massive illegal currency trans
actions for major U.S. organized crime fi
gures — who channeled the profits into
Nicholas Deak's Swiss bank.
The CIA undoubtedly knew of this crimi
nal procedure (important U.S. banks were
implicated, too) but did nothing, to avoid
disrupting its own questionable operations
with Deak.
In Japan, years of goverment-business
corruption insure that the Lockheed scan
dal, which now touches virtually every fi
gure in the ruling Liberal-Democratic party,
will never be fully investigated. Now that
the scandal has reached the CIA and such
powerful political figures as Richard Nixon
(who allegedly pushed Lockheed aircraft on
the Japanese), a coverup is already under
way in the United States.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, last
December, asked the courts to keep the
Lockheed data secret since its release could
"have grave consequences for significant
foreign relations interests of the United
States."
More recently, in a little noticed move.
President Ford appointed Charles Robinson
as Kissinger's chief deputy. Robinson was
president of Marcona Mining Corp., which
sells iron ore to Japanese steel firms. Three
years ago, Marcona took a multimillion dol
lar loan from Marubeni Co.
Lockheed paid Marubeni $2.1 million to
act as its sales agent and bribe distributor in
Japan.
The coverup continues.

gures — who channeled the profits into
Nicholas Deak's Swiss bank.

with Deak.
In Japan, years of goverment-business
corruption insure that the Lockheed scan
dal, which now touches virtually every fi

the scandal has reached the CIA and such
powerful political figures as Richard Nixon
(who allegedly pushed Lockheed aircraft on
the Japanese), a coverup is already under
way in the United States.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, last
December, asked the courts to keep the
Lockheed data secret since its release could
"have grave consequences for significant
foreign relations interests of the United

More recently, in a little noticed move.
President Ford appointed Charles Robinson
as Kissinger's chief deputy. Robinson was
president of Marcona Mining Corp., which
sells iron ore to Japanese steel firms. Three
years ago, Marcona took a multimillion dol

Lockheed paid Marubeni $2.1 million to
act as its sales agent and bribe distributor in
Japan.

The Lockheed revelations show more
than the personal venality of Lockheed
executives and of officials of more than 15
countries who took bribes to influence con
tract awards. They also tell us about the
dangers to law and democracy that arise
from the cooperation of parallel covert
bureaucracies whose operations are hidden
from public scrutiny by the cloak of "na
tional security."
Lockheed, like the Hughes empire, Ex
xon, ITT and other large multinationals,
maintains its own covert bureaucracy, a
mini-CIA which passes out bribes abroad
and in Washington and gathers worldwide
intelligence. (On at least one occasion,
Lockheed paid a CIA-linked firm in London
for secret information on European business
competitors.)
The power, and potential for abuse, of
Lockheed's bureaucracy is greatly mag
nified by its traditionally close ties to
America's national security establishment.
Most of Lockheed's work is for the Penta
gon, but it also built the U-2 spy plane for
the CIA. Their covert bureaucracies share a
strong community of interest.
The CIA and Lockheed joi ned forces most
blatantly in Japan, where they financed the
local covert network of Kodama Yoshio, a
former Class A war criminal and enor
mously influential leader of Japan's
paramilitary right wing and Tokyo under
world.
Lockheed used Kodama over many years
as an agent to swing Japanese government
contracts its way—in return for more than
$7 million in "fees."
Senator Frank Church accused Lockheed
of pursuing a "corporate foreign policy" of
support to Japan's right wing in opposition
to the position of the United States gover
ment. Contrary, however, to Church's con
tention that the U.S."vigorously opposed"
Kodama, the CIA and Army Intelligence

procured Kodama's release from prison in
1948 and have employed his services ever
since — as a source of high level intelli
gence and an entry into Japanese govern
ment and business circles. Kodama proved
particularly useful in mobilizing strongarm
squads of rightists and gangsters to smash
leftwing demonstrators and organizers dur
ing the 19505.

In 1958,the CIA financed the victorious
election campaign of former war criminal
Kishi Nobusuke, Kodama's close friend and
fellow prison inmate. The next year, armed
with funds from Lockheed, Kodama won for
Lockheed an important contract for anti
submarine aircraft with the Kishi gover
ment.
The CIA almost certainly knew of Lock
heed's payments to Kodama. Most of these
bribes were "laundered" through Deak &
Co., a currency trading firm headed by a
former U.S. intelligence agent and often
used by the CIA for covert currency transac
tions.
Veteran CIA watcher Tad Szulc, on the
basis of this connection, argues in the New
Republic that the CIA used Lockheed to
bolster Kodama and advance U.S. objectives
in Japan. But why not just give Kodama the
money directly? A more likely explanation
is that Lockheed simply appropriated Deak
& Co.'s existing private covert bureaucracy
for its own ends, while the CIA looked on
approvingly.

For Szulc errs in describing Deak & Co. as
a mere CIA front. Thus, at the same time that
Deak & Co. was helping the CIA profit
covertly from blackmarket plaster specula
tion during the Vietnam war (at the tax
payer's ultimate expense), it was also handl
