# Preparing to enter real world

While attending this school I have
noticed two very interesting qualities
about the nature of students: first, they
seem to be apathetic concerning many is
sues, especially compared to the dedica
tion of the activists during the late '60s;
second, I see an academic cynicism
which lends itself to battling out popular
issues at the dinner table on such an intel
lectual level that it is impossible to search
tor realistic, "grass roots" solutions.
First a few comments on the "academic
cynicism" here. To those of you who can
answer yes to the following questions,
feel free to read another article. Do you
know about the provisions of Senate Bill
1? Do you know that almost 400 million
people are undernourished ("starving")
according to U.N. estimates during the
World Food Conference in 1974?
If you were offended by Josh and the
"propaganda" posted by the Christians,
did you actually go hear him to see if he
was an over-publicized, floor-stomping
evangelist, or actually a man worth listen
ing to? Have you read the actual nuclear
initiative to be voted on in June by

Californians? And the last question
which all brilliant students here should
be able to answer: Can you name your two
senators and district representative?
Hooray to those of you who answered
all affirmately! These are only a few ques
tions which seem appropriate to ask col
lege students who will shortly be promi
nent leaders in all vocational areas.
Don't feel ashamed
Those of you who were scratching your
heads as you read these questions don't
feel ashamed, or even ignorant, but of
course I would never expect a Stanford
student to plead ignorance on any issue!
Let me elaborate on the point I am trying
to make.
One doesn't have to be a member of
ARC (Alliance for Radical Change) to
keep up on important issues. ARC, as wel 1
as the Young Republicans and Young
Libertarian Alliance, keep up on current
events while offering good speakers and
information to (he University commun
ity. The fact is that common news sources
(e.g. newspapers, TV. radio and
magazines) offer a great deal of general

information on the issues previously
mentioned, as well as an ocean of others.
Be aware
In order to be responsible citizens, we
must be aware of what is going on around
us. Political and social controversies go
on daily, but we must look for informa
tion on these issues.
We can not let ourselves become
apathetic when our government, multina
tional corporations, the CIA and the FBI
are full of corruption and misdeeds. It is
now when we should be most informed
and active in our government. It doesn't
take a major war to see that something's
wrong. But are we going to wait for
another Vietnam, Sahel famine or Nixon
to emerge before becoming active citi
zens? We don't have to.
How many of you have written to your
congressperson or senator on an issue
which you have strcyig convictions? This
process, as well as many others such as
lobbying, supporting campaigns and get
ting involved in community activities are
methods which we can utilize as students
to do our part as citizens.

These suggestions are not radical; they
do not call for a revolutionary change in
systems. Changes are needed, but they
can be made within the confines of the
present system. We must act on what we
believe, or suffer from bad results which
were not molded by our ideas. How can
you expect a system to be acceptable to
you if your ideas do not help to shape the
form of that system?
I am asking that we, as members of the
academic arena, become involved in the
world outside the University. We will
soon be out in the "real world," where
decisions are made governing the way we
live.
Until we are willing to work within the
system to change the wrongs and main
tain the rights, we can not expect any
thing. We will stay cynics and live in a
world of personal discontent until we get
out and do something. We are ineffective
citizens (in a world of power struggles) as
long as we continue in our present trend
of apathy.
