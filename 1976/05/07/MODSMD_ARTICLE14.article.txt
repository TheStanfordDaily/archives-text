a pait albino? IVluil is the correct definition? -L.M.
Albinism is the absence of all pigment in hair, eyes and skin,
according to Biology Lecturer Marcia Allen.
. Consequently, Allen said, no person with red hair could be an
rlbi no. Albino humans do have red eyes but this color is merely the
reflection of blood vessels in the retina. Albinos have very light,
nearly white, hair.
■ In humans, albinism is caused by two recessive albino genes. An
.rlbi no gene is a mutation which prevents production of theenzyme
tryosinase, which produces melanin (what gives color to hairand
skin). While.i person might be the carrier of a recessive albino gene,
this would not show up in any physical way.

Dirk can't help you too much, but Jason Mavis, director of Plant
Services, can. Although typical University budget-tightening men
tality dictates that repairs in this area should be generally avoided
(in anticipation of the new library which will eventually be built
there), Mavis promised to fill in these particular craters.

Stanford is part of Palo Alto, but since it has its own post office,
the official address is "Stanford." Here's hoping your tuition hasn't
been swept away in one fell swoop.
