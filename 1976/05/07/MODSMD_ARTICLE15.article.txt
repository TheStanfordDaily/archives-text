LOS ANGELES (AP) — Vice President Nelson
Rockefeller said Wednesday he believes Demo
cratic cross-overs gave primary victories to
Ronald Reagan in Indiana and Texas anil said the
Democrats would rather face Reagan than Presi
dent Ford in November.
He again criticized the former California gover
nor for using "demagoguery" in his campaign
and added he is still certain that President Ford
will win the Republican presidential nomination.
The vice president told a news conference in
Los Angeles that cross-over voting makes it "pos
sible for the opposition party to help select the
candidate of their opponent."
No chance
Of Reagan's hopes to unseat Ford, Rockefeller
said, "I don't think he has a chance. I think his
chances are better than they were, but 1 still don't
think he has a chance."
Asked if he would support Reagan in the event
the ex-governor did win the nomination, the vice
president replied, "I don't even consider or dis

cuss the possibility."
Rockefeller criticized Reagan's stand on the
Panama Canal. Angola and defense spending, cal
ling his statements either "ignorant of the facts or
a misrepresentation."
He said he feels the campaign should be fought
on the basis of "issues and facts, not slogans and
demagoguery."
Extremes
The vice president said Reagan's "extreme pos
itions" would hurt him in a campaign against
Democrats because "1 don't think this is an ex
tremist country."
Rockefeller was scheduled later to address the
Los Angeles World Affairs Council at the Biltmore
Hotel and tell his audience there is a need to
increase defense spending because "if the down
ward or static trend of U.S. defense expenditures
of the recent past continues, the United States will
be abandoning its ability to maintain its essential
strength vis-a-vis the Soviet Union."
