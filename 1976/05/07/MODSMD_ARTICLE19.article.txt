## Black dance show lively, informative 
### Keith Calhoun 
Black American dance hit the
stage of Dinkelspiel Auditorium
last week as the Committee on
Black Performing Arts and Les
Williams treated a very respon
sive audience to two lively even
ings of music, history and dance.
I can honestly say it was more
informative than your average
lecture class.
Williams, director of t he prog
ram, led the audience through
the long evolution of jazz danc
ing, spicing his narrative with
examples ranging from the
"cake walk" to his own versions
ol the black fad dances of the
'liOs. The dances featured stu
dents that gave energetic and at
times near professional perfor
mances.
Although the atmosphere suf
fered from general lack of sets
and fuller orchestration the cos
tumes were imaginative and the
routines well choreographed. At
times the dancers seemed to be
enjoying their performance as
much as the audience.
"Cakewalk," "Walking the
Dog," "Shim Sham Shimmy"
and "Black Bottom" were some
of the most exciting routines as
was the tap dancing chorus line
and Mae Jemison's tantalizing
designs on Woody Weaver in

"St. Louis Blues."
Williams himself turned the
house out with an incredible
rendition of Bill "Bojungles"
Robinson's bumms stair dance.
11 is showmanship and seem
ingly effortless maneuvers were
the highlight of the night.
Williams was equally effective
in his role as narrator as he of
fered sometimes personal in
sights into the eclectic origins of
tap dancing, the sly imitation of
the strutting plantation master
in the "cake walk" and a less

than serious story of the begin
nings of the Charleston.
But if there was any theme that
ran consistently through the
program it was what Williams
called a need in this bicentennial
year to examine the true roots of
America's dance forms. Al
t hough black forms of dance his
torically never gained the estab
lished recognition or acceptance
of many other styles of dance,
jazz dancing has been a consis
tent influence and source from
which mainstream American

dancers have traditionally
drawn.
Williams pointed out that
minstrel shows, vaudeville acts
and a host of popular dances,
ranging from the Charleston,
Lindv and Jitterbug to the Twist,
Jerk and presently the Hustle,
Bump,etc. have all been freely
borrowed from and adapted into
more accepted forms.
All in all, Williams' concept
was clear and his program well
executed — it was a night well
spent.
