# Authorities investigate tapes found in Soto attic
## 
### Pan Demetrakakes Randy Keith 
Two students uncovered 11 cassette
tapes containing clandestinely re
corded conversations spoken in one
female Soto resident's room, Sgt.
Richard Min, Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Office detective, confirmed
yesterday.
The two Soto residents, senior Jim
Polk and freshman Bob Hauptman,
found the tapes, a set of headphones
and some wires while they were
exploring the Soto attic late last quar
ter, Polk said.
The recordings were apparently
made by hooking into the female resi
dent's intercom, according to Min.
Each Wilbur room contains an inter
com which was once connected to the
Wilbur office. The entire system was
disconnected several years ago.
Sheriffs have no specific suspect.
However, "with the information we
have found on the physical evidence,
the profile would be a male student —
a member of the dorm," Min said.
Felony charges
Min said the person who made the
tape could face three felony charges.
He also noted that the tapes were
bought at the Stanford Bookstore.
The Soto attic can be reached by a
trap door in the third floor hallway, but
Min said this method would be very
conspicuous. He stated the eaves
dropper most likely entered through
the trap door above the maid's closet in
the third floor men's bathroom.

Also, according to an informed i
source, "at least one key" is missing
which opens the maid's closet.
Possession of keys
The only persons who should have
keys to open the maid's closet are Ad
ministrative Assistant for Wilbur Hall
Marie Haley. Custodian Supervisor
Maggie Montgomery and the Soto
maid, house associate (RA) James Liu
said.
The investigators rejected the idea
that the tapings were an "official
wiretap. We determined it was not a
federal matter because they would
have more know-how and do a more
sophisticated job than what we found,
which was pretty mickey-mouse,"
Min remarked.
One apparent motive for the record
ings, that the eavesdropper is an
"audio voyeur," has subsequently
been rejected by the detective. The
tapes, contain no sounds of sexual ac
tivities, according to Min.
The tapes contained "normal dorm
chatter, schoolwork, chatter, things
like that. We identified a number of
voices — it was absolutely legitimate;
there was nothing embarrassing," Min
remarked.
Listened to tape
Min and senior house associate
Glenn Burgess are the only persons
who have listened to all the tapes.
Burgess said he listened to the tapes
with University permission at the
request of police.
Polk said he stumbled onto the tapes

during a party.
"We had a party and a couple people
got a little rambunctions, so they
poked around in the attic," Soto resi
dent James Bach explained. "Some
where along in the search they found
the tapes and a pair of headphones."
Polk added, "We walked back to the
trap door and ).L. (Morris, a Soto RA)
was right below us and we said, 'Come
on up, J.L., we want to show you some
thing.' "
'Half a minute'
Morris and Polk said they listened to
"about a half a minute" of the tape in
Soto resident Tim Williams' room.
Polk said he recognized the voice of
ex-Soto resident Roger West. West
transferred to Northwestern Univer-
sity at the end of winter quarter, ac
cording to dorm residents.
"At that point we stopped the tape
and we went and got Roger. He (West)
said, 'Well, I'd like to hear the rest of
the tape,' " Folk said.
Meanwhile, according to several
sources in Soto, two residents had
gone to the attic, removed the remain
ing tapes and listened to them with
other residents for a few minutes.

been rejected by the detective. The
tapes, contain no sounds of sexual ac
tivities, according to Min.
The tapes contained "normal dorm
chatter, schoolwork, chatter, things
like that. We identified a number of
voices — it was absolutely legitimate;
there was nothing embarrassing," Min
remarked.
Listened to tape
Min and senior house associate
Glenn Burgess are the only persons
who have listened to all the tapes.
Burgess said he listened to the tapes
with University permission at the
request of police.
Polk said he stumbled onto the tapes

during a party.
"We had a party and a couple people
got a little rambunctions, so they
poked around in the attic," Soto resi
dent James Bach explained. "Some
where along in the search they found
the tapes and a pair of headphones."
Polk added, "We walked back to the
trap door and ).L. (Morris, a Soto RA)
was right below us and we said, 'Come
on up, J.L., we want to show you some
thing.' "
'Half a minute'
Morris and Polk said they listened to
"about a half a minute" of the tape in
Soto resident Tim Williams' room.
Polk said he recognized the voice of
ex-Soto resident Roger West. West
transferred to Northwestern Univer-
sity at the end of winter quarter, ac
cording to dorm residents.
"At that point we stopped the tape
and we went and got Roger. He (West)
said, 'Well, I'd like to hear the rest of
the tape,' " Folk said.
Meanwhile, according to several
sources in Soto, two residents had
gone to the attic, removed the remain
ing tapes and listened to them with
other residents for a few minutes.
Two students uncovered 11 cassette
tapes containing clandestinely re
corded conversations spoken in one
female Soto resident's room, Sgt.
Richard Min, Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Office detective, confirmed
yesterday.
The two Soto residents, senior Jim
Polk and freshman Bob Hauptman,
found the tapes, a set of headphones
and some wires while they were
exploring the Soto attic late last quar
ter, Polk said.
The recordings were apparently
made by hooking into the female resi
dent's intercom, according to Min.
Each Wilbur room contains an inter
com which was once connected to the
Wilbur office. The entire system was
disconnected several years ago.
Sheriffs have no specific suspect.
However, "with the information we
have found on the physical evidence,
the profile would be a male student —
a member of the dorm," Min said.
Felony charges
Min said the person who made the
tape could face three felony charges.
He also noted that the tapes were
bought at the Stanford Bookstore.
The Soto attic can be reached by a
trap door in the third floor hallway, but
Min said this method would be very
conspicuous. He stated the eaves
dropper most likely entered through
the trap door above the maid's closet in
the third floor men's bathroom.

Also, according to an informed i
source, "at least one key" is missing
which opens the maid's closet.
Possession of keys
The only persons who should have
keys to open the maid's closet are Ad
ministrative Assistant for Wilbur Hall
Marie Haley. Custodian Supervisor
Maggie Montgomery and the Soto
maid, house associate (RA) James Liu
said.
The investigators rejected the idea
that the tapings were an "official
wiretap. We determined it was not a
federal matter because they would
have more know-how and do a more
sophisticated job than what we found,
which was pretty mickey-mouse,"
Min remarked.
One apparent motive for the record
ings, that the eavesdropper is an
"audio voyeur," has subsequently
been rejected by the detective. The
tapes, contain no sounds of sexual ac
tivities, according to Min.
