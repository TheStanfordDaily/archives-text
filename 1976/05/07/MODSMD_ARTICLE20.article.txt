# Quicksilver in dynamite return
## 
### Sally Young 
Quicksilver Messenger Ser
vice put on a rousing show at the
Keystone Berkeley on April 30.
Playing without a break for two
hours, the group performed
songs from early albums as well
as extended vocal
instrumental jams. First, how
ever, one had to suffer through
the opening act.
The seating was surprisingly
uncrowded in the spacious Ber
keley nightclub, and one could
sip beer or apple juice while
awaiting the electric onslaught.
The warm-up band was the
Runaways, an all-female rock
group from L.A.

Introducing themselves as a
real rock band ("and not just
another 'Fanny' "), these self
styled bad-girls unleashed a volt
of cacophony. Grinding away at
their axes and bellowing lyrics
that were, fortunately, swal
lowed by the din, they subjected
the audience to an unvaried tor
rent of unprofessional screech.
In keeping with their street
wise image, the black-gloved
Runaways presented a selection
of toughkid tunes. Dwelling on
sex and violence, their unim
aginative lyrics reached the peak
of offensiveness in "S&M, Let's
Do It Again."

Apart from their limited reper
toire of "mean momma'' songs,
the Runaways revealed their
lack of musical experience in
uncoordinated guitar work bet
ween the bass, rhythm and lead
players.
Their drawing-card, one
would surmise, is their ambigu
ously baby-faced lead singer, a
17-year-old angel beneath her
make-up. Although interesting
to look at. with her angelic/
demonic features, the vocalist
suffered from laughable lyrics
and the inability to move. With a
stiltified walk, a wooden leap,
and a monumental lack of tim
ing, she danced without re

course to rhythm. It was to little
regret that the Runaways
finished their set without an en
core.
What a relief to watch an or
ganized band when, moments
later, Quicksilver took over the
stage. Beginning their set with
their classic, "Fresh Air,"
Quicksilver instantly estab
lished an enthusiastic rapport
with their audience.
After the scowling Runaways,
Quicksilver's hippie tunes
seemed cleancut, and their lead
singer. Dino Valenti, positively
jolly.
There were no noticeable
flaws in the performance; rather,
each musician seemed to play
his heart out with subtlety and
success. David Freidberg, end
ing backwards under his over
sized bass, performed an ac
complished and comic solo
looking like R. Crumb's truckin'
man.
Valenti and Gary Duncan
maintained searing guitar riffs

throughout, but the most spec
tacular solo was performed by
Pete Sears on keyboards. From
the tinkling of blues to boogie,
jazz, and the futuristic zap of
syntheiszer, Sears played it all in
an inspired turn before the spot
light.

For the most part, Quicksilver
stuck to traditional crovvd
pleasers, such as "Bittersweet
Love" and "What About Me."
The group's versatility was evi
dent, however, for interspersed
with their old songs were elec
trifying blues-rock instrumen

tals and a few slow love songs.
Obviously enjoying them
selves, Quicksilver could relax
without suffering time lapses be
tween numbers or musical
lapses between players. Theirs
was a tight, professional set of
pleasantly hard rock music.

their classic, "Fresh Air,"
Quicksilver instantly estab
lished an enthusiastic rapport
with their audience.
After the scowling Runaways,
Quicksilver's hippie tunes
seemed cleancut, and their lead
singer. Dino Valenti, positively
jolly.
There were no noticeable
flaws in the performance; rather,
each musician seemed to play
his heart out with subtlety and
success. David Freidberg, end
ing backwards under his over
sized bass, performed an ac
complished and comic solo
looking like R. Crumb's truckin'
man.
Valenti and Gary Duncan
maintained searing guitar riffs

throughout, but the most spec
tacular solo was performed by
Pete Sears on keyboards. From
the tinkling of blues to boogie,
jazz, and the futuristic zap of
syntheiszer, Sears played it all in
an inspired turn before the spot
light.

For the most part, Quicksilver
stuck to traditional crovvd
pleasers, such as "Bittersweet
Love" and "What About Me."
The group's versatility was evi
dent, however, for interspersed
with their old songs were elec
trifying blues-rock instrumen

tals and a few slow love songs.
Obviously enjoying them
selves, Quicksilver could relax
without suffering time lapses be
tween numbers or musical
lapses between players. Theirs
was a tight, professional set of
pleasantly hard rock music.

HlPPlES—Quicksilver Messenger Service, a band that began in San Francisco's Haight-Asbury
district has kept up a strong beat through the years. The group made a crowd-pleasing appearance
at the intimate Keystone Berkeley last week.
Quicksilver Messenger Ser
vice put on a rousing show at the
Keystone Berkeley on April 30.
Playing without a break for two
hours, the group performed
songs from early albums as well
as extended vocal
instrumental jams. First, how
ever, one had to suffer through
the opening act.
The seating was surprisingly
uncrowded in the spacious Ber
keley nightclub, and one could
sip beer or apple juice while
awaiting the electric onslaught.
The warm-up band was the
Runaways, an all-female rock
group from L.A.

Introducing themselves as a
real rock band ("and not just
another 'Fanny' "), these self
styled bad-girls unleashed a volt
of cacophony. Grinding away at
their axes and bellowing lyrics
that were, fortunately, swal
lowed by the din, they subjected
the audience to an unvaried tor
rent of unprofessional screech.
In keeping with their street
wise image, the black-gloved
Runaways presented a selection
of toughkid tunes. Dwelling on
sex and violence, their unim
aginative lyrics reached the peak
of offensiveness in "S&M, Let's
Do It Again."

Apart from their limited reper
toire of "mean momma'' songs,
the Runaways revealed their
lack of musical experience in
uncoordinated guitar work bet
ween the bass, rhythm and lead
players.
Their drawing-card, one
would surmise, is their ambigu
ously baby-faced lead singer, a
17-year-old angel beneath her
make-up. Although interesting
to look at. with her angelic/
demonic features, the vocalist
suffered from laughable lyrics
and the inability to move. With a
stiltified walk, a wooden leap,
and a monumental lack of tim
ing, she danced without re

course to rhythm. It was to little
regret that the Runaways
finished their set without an en
core.
What a relief to watch an or
ganized band when, moments
later, Quicksilver took over the
stage. Beginning their set with
their classic, "Fresh Air,"
Quicksilver instantly estab
lished an enthusiastic rapport
