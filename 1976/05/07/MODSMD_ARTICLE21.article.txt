# Savoyards' spring offering
## 'Sorcerer' is rousing 
### Karen Olson 
Both love potions and sorcerers may produce
unexpected consequences. The Sorcerer by Gil
bert and Sullivan is a lighthearted treatment of
someot those romantic complications. As done by
the Stanford Savoyards, this production of the
operetta combined both excellent singing and
great orchestration with entertaining results.
The story began with Constance Partlett si ngi ng
(to her mother) of an unrequited love for the vil
lage vicar. Constance, played by Patty Wolfe,
opened up with a clear, touching voice but failed
to move or use the stage; effectively in one of tin;
show's many blocking failures.
After Mrs. Partlett questioned the vicar about
his feelings for Constance, we hear him break into
song on the topic of love. The vicar. Dr. Daly, was
played by Frederick Wedel Jr. Wedel, although
convincingly portraying an old churchman, lost
many of his singing parts through throaty projec
tion and lack of diction.
After the vicar's outburst, the whole village
gathered together to celebrate the marriage of
Alexis (son of an old baronet) and Aline (daughter
of Lady Sangazure). In one of the brightest songs
of the show, Lady Sangazure and the old baronet,
Sir Marmaduke Poindexter, voiced their attrac
tions for each other.
Ann Hay, portraying theLady.and Ed Firestone,
as Sir Marmaduke, hammed up their roles in ex
cellent Gilbert and Sullivan style.
Duet
Soon after the village retired into the church,
Alexis (Laurel Smith and Michael Kel
logg respectively) combined for a love duet which
at times grew tedious. Both voices were clear in
their higher ranges, but Smith's soprano lost too
much volume on the lower notes.
Kellogg's projection of a high-voiced, unmas
culine Alexis produced many audience laughs

but the character interpretation became stronger as
Kellogg seemed to gain confidence in his role.
After rejoicing in the beauties of love, Alexis
decided to spread this wonderful feeling
throughout the town, disregarding the conven
tions or rank, age or monetary status.He sought to
procure a love potion and wound up dealing with
a registered sorcerer. John Wellington Wells (Dan
Allen), "a dealer in magic and spells," was one of
the high points of the show.
With great stage presence and audience appeal
he carried off a mystical incantation scene with
perfect poise. He then poured the guaranteed love
potion into a wedding reception punch which
cast a spell over the whole town. The resulting
mix-up of former love partners provided the basis
for action for the rest of the show.
I.ove-sick
Allen, in the second act. again managed to cap
tivate the audience in an outstanding combina
tion with Lady Sangazure. The sorcerer had found
himself trapped by the love-sick Lady and voiced
his obvious dismay in a slickly produced number.
Allen entranced the audience while Ann Hay fi
nally warmed up to her part as mixed-up Lady
Sangazure.
Overall, the main cast was supported by an ex
cellent vocal chorus. The combined town scenes
produced an outstanding sound and would have
been very professional except for the lack of crea
tive choreography or blocking. However the or
chestration was from the beginning impressive,
and credit must goto Jason Klein for his coordina
tion of musical talents.
Also, a few of the scenes needed a change of
pace as the conversational songs seemed long and
drawn-out at times.
The Savoyard's production continues through
today, tomorrow and Sunday. Shows begin at 8
p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.

Sir Marmaduke Poindexter, voiced their attrac
tions for each other.
Ann Hay, portraying theLady.and Ed Firestone,
as Sir Marmaduke, hammed up their roles in ex
cellent Gilbert and Sullivan style.
Duet
Soon after the village retired into the church,
Alexis (Laurel Smith and Michael Kel
logg respectively) combined for a love duet which
at times grew tedious. Both voices were clear in
their higher ranges, but Smith's soprano lost too
much volume on the lower notes.
Kellogg's projection of a high-voiced, unmas
culine Alexis produced many audience laughs

but the character interpretation became stronger as
Kellogg seemed to gain confidence in his role.
After rejoicing in the beauties of love, Alexis
decided to spread this wonderful feeling
throughout the town, disregarding the conven
tions or rank, age or monetary status.He sought to
procure a love potion and wound up dealing with
a registered sorcerer. John Wellington Wells (Dan
Allen), "a dealer in magic and spells," was one of
the high points of the show.
With great stage presence and audience appeal
he carried off a mystical incantation scene with
perfect poise. He then poured the guaranteed love
potion into a wedding reception punch which
cast a spell over the whole town. The resulting
mix-up of former love partners provided the basis
for action for the rest of the show.
I.ove-sick
Allen, in the second act. again managed to cap
tivate the audience in an outstanding combina
tion with Lady Sangazure. The sorcerer had found
himself trapped by the love-sick Lady and voiced
his obvious dismay in a slickly produced number.
Allen entranced the audience while Ann Hay fi
nally warmed up to her part as mixed-up Lady
Sangazure.
Overall, the main cast was supported by an ex
cellent vocal chorus. The combined town scenes
produced an outstanding sound and would have
been very professional except for the lack of crea
tive choreography or blocking. However the or
chestration was from the beginning impressive,
and credit must goto Jason Klein for his coordina
tion of musical talents.
Also, a few of the scenes needed a change of
pace as the conversational songs seemed long and
drawn-out at times.
The Savoyard's production continues through
today, tomorrow and Sunday. Shows begin at 8
p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Both love potions and sorcerers may produce
unexpected consequences. The Sorcerer by Gil
bert and Sullivan is a lighthearted treatment of
someot those romantic complications. As done by
the Stanford Savoyards, this production of the
operetta combined both excellent singing and
great orchestration with entertaining results.
The story began with Constance Partlett si ngi ng
(to her mother) of an unrequited love for the vil
lage vicar. Constance, played by Patty Wolfe,
opened up with a clear, touching voice but failed
to move or use the stage; effectively in one of tin;
show's many blocking failures.
After Mrs. Partlett questioned the vicar about
his feelings for Constance, we hear him break into
song on the topic of love. The vicar. Dr. Daly, was
played by Frederick Wedel Jr. Wedel, although
convincingly portraying an old churchman, lost
many of his singing parts through throaty projec
tion and lack of diction.
After the vicar's outburst, the whole village
gathered together to celebrate the marriage of
Alexis (son of an old baronet) and Aline (daughter
of Lady Sangazure). In one of the brightest songs
of the show, Lady Sangazure and the old baronet,
Sir Marmaduke Poindexter, voiced their attrac
tions for each other.
