And I remember the singer -
In fact he was a legend -
I've a book full of interesting
names
A scratched forty-five
And so many memories,
Somehow without music it's
just not the same.
Bernie Taupin's assessment of
his work without rock star Elton
John is essentially correct. It's
not the same without the music.
Gone are the energetic, high
pitched vocals, the flashy piano
riffs, the searing guitar, the driv
ing beat, thebubblegum—all the
elements of the Elton John
sound.
What's left is a (by definition)
passive, but still very moving
compilation of lyrics—words
that have built two careers—
Elton's and Bernie's.
Taupin's work begins with
some of his earliest, most primi
tive lyrics ("And it's me, yes it's
men, It's me, yes, it's me yes it's
me that you need") and it traces
his lyrics up to the complicated,
metaphorical and intense words
of Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road.
Art
The book is packed with draw
ings, photos and graphics that
many times capture the essence
of Taupin's thought, and in some
instances leave the reader won

dering about the artist's sanity.
Among the notable artists and
photographers are Peter Heard,
Terry O'Neill, David Larkham,
Charlie Watts, Mike Dempsey
and rock stars John Lennon,
Ringo Starr and Alice Cooper.
The cover is a masterpiece by
Alan Aldridge. (Remember the
Captain Fantastic album cover
and the Beatle books?) If you are
familiar with Elton-Bernie song
titles, try and guess which songs
Aldridge has placed on a like
ness of Bernie's hand.
Warm glow
Overall, the book has a warm
glow. I found myself humming
Elton's tunes to Bernie's printed
lyrics and for the first time,
perhaps, understanding the
meanings of some of the songs
that have sold millions of re
cords.
Others may find this book
cheap, shoddy, commercial
trash—a poor attempt to be artis
tic. 1 disagree.
Taupin's book is not necessar
ily a collection of great poetry (or
one of bad poetry), but it's a un
ique compendium of rock'n'roll
lyrics and rock'n'roll art. The
book is more a pop chronicle.
But unmistaken
The music soared above us.
Its power upon the masses
never died,
But when our systems fed the
voice
It was the words upon his lips
That made the crowds that
watched him cry.
