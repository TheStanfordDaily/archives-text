# Fields: moving towards self-discovery, control

The Other Walker, by Ken
Fields. Talisman, $3.95.
Sunbelly, by Ken Fields. David
R. Godine, $2.50.
Reviewed by Dana Gioia
Ken Fields has been at Stan
ford for the last 10 years first as a
graduate student, then as a pro
fessor. During this time he has
published two books of verse.
The Other Walker was pub
lished in 1971 on a grant from
the National Endowment for the
Arts. Field's second book, Sun
belly, was recently brought out
by David Godine, a prestigious
Boston publisher, to help inaugu
rate a poetry series. These two
books show Fields as a serious
poet developing an individual
style.
The Other Walker is a
poorly edited book. It contains
many poems that should not
have been collected in book
torm. At this stage of his career
Fields did not have enough
first-rate poems to fill 70
closely printed pages and pub
lished many pieces he should
have forgotten. Several poems
read like experiments in various
styles or meters and lack the in
tensity of Fields' best work.
This looseness of judgment is
a shame because The Other
Walker contains many excellent
poems, and it would be unfortu
nate if the reader was discour
aged by the less successful
poems before he found the many
gems. I am sure that part of the
reason that Fields' first book has
not received nearly the attention
it deserves was that few critics
took the trouble to read through
the entire book. Had Fields
worked with a better publisher
this neglect would not have oc
curred.
Best poems
The best poems in The Other
Walker show Fields' first style.
He wrote formal, well
controlled, intellectual poems.
As often as not the entire poem
was reflective. The speaker
talked about what had happened
or what might happen. In "Down
Along The Coast" Fields writes
to his wife:
We lived in moments: heard at
night the long
crash of the surf, delayed in its
full swell:
The broken motion of the moon,
the tides;
And in that change kneiv no
thing hut ourselves.
In the last poem of this first
book Fields consciously tries to
break away from the introspec
tion that characterized so much
of his early work:
An amateur
Of darkness and of the darkened
self
I had, for too long, felt closed in
by otherness.
This superb poem, signific
antly entitled "Today," an
nounced the direction of Fields'

later work. He wanted h is poetry
to leave the world of the mind
and enter the world of the
senses.
Difficult journey
This journey out of the mind is
difficult. Intellectual skills can
be learned through many tradi
tional disciplines. But sensual
awareness is a more dangerous
state to attain. There is always
the possibility of overin
dulgence at any one spot along
the journey. Most of the many
disciplines that are offered seem
specious and limited.
A person usually needs a
teacher of some sort, and Fields
was no exception. He looks to
ward Castenada's Don Juan.
While this identification did ex
pand Fields, the poetic results
entitled "Juan Songs" are very
modest.
The "Juan Songs" are thecent
ral section of Fields' second
book, Sunbelly. In the "Juan
Songs" there is a freedom and
naturalness absent in Fields' ear
lier poetry, but they also betray
the limitations of a style which
praises the external at the ex
pense of the internal.
Totemic songs
Like examples in Castenada's
books these poems are totemic
songs which capture the inner
essence of some magical object
or animal. Often that object is
speaking. They are precise and
objective, but as poems they
seem incomplete expressions of
Fields' talent.
In the best poems in Sunbelly
Fields uses a looser version of
his earlier style to examine the
excesses of the intellect. Cer
tainly the finest poem in the
book is "Boss" which describes
the suicide of Ernest Heming
way who killed himself with a
Boss shutgun. The beginning of
the poem is stunning:
All night he heard the sound of
mountain water,
The clear streams of the fxist fal
ling away
From a lake in the high country.
The black ducks then
And rainbows would be rising
with the sun
But not for him. It was already
over.
This poem is about more than
Hemingway. It is a sympathetic
but firm critique of any mind
that is fixed on nada. This poem
deserves to be better known. I
hope no anthologist lets it pass
him by.
Comic verse
One early interest that Fields
luckily did not abandon in his
second book is his flair for comic
verse. Sunbelly has a section of
epigrams that demonstrate this
rich part of Fields' talent in this
ancient form. My own favorite is
called "Biog.":
Poets are known by readers and

hy lovers:
Discreet, separate but equal
under covers.
Someday Fields may well re
place another Stanford poet, J.V.
Cunningham, as America's mas
ter of the epigram.
Sunbelly is a book by a poet
who is growing. It shows Fields
expanding his vision and
loosening his style. No final
opinion should be made about
him from this volume. His later
work will undoubtedly prove
any facile predictions wrong.
Both of Fields' books should
be read together. They show a
poet moving towards self
discovery and control. Perhaps
he has not totally arrived as an
important poet, but Sunbelly
shows him moving in the right
direction.

ward Castenada's Don Juan.
While this identification did ex
pand Fields, the poetic results
entitled "Juan Songs" are very
modest.
The "Juan Songs" are thecent
ral section of Fields' second
book, Sunbelly. In the "Juan
Songs" there is a freedom and
naturalness absent in Fields' ear
lier poetry, but they also betray
the limitations of a style which
praises the external at the ex
pense of the internal.
Totemic songs
Like examples in Castenada's
books these poems are totemic
songs which capture the inner
essence of some magical object
or animal. Often that object is
speaking. They are precise and
objective, but as poems they
seem incomplete expressions of
Fields' talent.
In the best poems in Sunbelly
Fields uses a looser version of
his earlier style to examine the
excesses of the intellect. Cer
tainly the finest poem in the
book is "Boss" which describes
the suicide of Ernest Heming
way who killed himself with a
Boss shutgun. The beginning of
the poem is stunning:
All night he heard the sound of
mountain water,
The clear streams of the fxist fal
ling away
From a lake in the high country.
The black ducks then
And rainbows would be rising
with the sun
But not for him. It was already
over.
This poem is about more than
Hemingway. It is a sympathetic
but firm critique of any mind
that is fixed on nada. This poem
deserves to be better known. I
hope no anthologist lets it pass
him by.
Comic verse
One early interest that Fields
luckily did not abandon in his
second book is his flair for comic
verse. Sunbelly has a section of
epigrams that demonstrate this
rich part of Fields' talent in this
ancient form. My own favorite is
called "Biog.":
Poets are known by readers and

hy lovers:
Discreet, separate but equal
under covers.
Someday Fields may well re
place another Stanford poet, J.V.
Cunningham, as America's mas
ter of the epigram.
Sunbelly is a book by a poet
who is growing. It shows Fields
expanding his vision and
loosening his style. No final
opinion should be made about
him from this volume. His later
work will undoubtedly prove
any facile predictions wrong.
Both of Fields' books should
be read together. They show a
poet moving towards self
discovery and control. Perhaps
he has not totally arrived as an
important poet, but Sunbelly
shows him moving in the right
direction.

Sunbelly, by Ken Fields. David
R. Godine, $2.50.
Reviewed by Dana Gioia
Ken Fields has been at Stan
ford for the last 10 years first as a
graduate student, then as a pro
fessor. During this time he has
published two books of verse.
The Other Walker was pub
lished in 1971 on a grant from
the National Endowment for the
Arts. Field's second book, Sun
belly, was recently brought out
by David Godine, a prestigious
Boston publisher, to help inaugu
rate a poetry series. These two
books show Fields as a serious
poet developing an individual
style.
The Other Walker is a
poorly edited book. It contains
many poems that should not
have been collected in book
torm. At this stage of his career
Fields did not have enough
first-rate poems to fill 70
closely printed pages and pub
lished many pieces he should
have forgotten. Several poems
read like experiments in various
styles or meters and lack the in
tensity of Fields' best work.
This looseness of judgment is
a shame because The Other
Walker contains many excellent
poems, and it would be unfortu
nate if the reader was discour
aged by the less successful
poems before he found the many
gems. I am sure that part of the
reason that Fields' first book has
not received nearly the attention
it deserves was that few critics
took the trouble to read through
the entire book. Had Fields
worked with a better publisher
this neglect would not have oc
curred.
Best poems
The best poems in The Other
Walker show Fields' first style.
He wrote formal, well
controlled, intellectual poems.
As often as not the entire poem
was reflective. The speaker
talked about what had happened
or what might happen. In "Down
Along The Coast" Fields writes
to his wife:
We lived in moments: heard at
night the long
crash of the surf, delayed in its
full swell:
The broken motion of the moon,
the tides;
And in that change kneiv no
thing hut ourselves.
In the last poem of this first
book Fields consciously tries to
break away from the introspec
tion that characterized so much
of his early work:
An amateur
Of darkness and of the darkened
self
I had, for too long, felt closed in
by otherness.
This superb poem, signific
antly entitled "Today," an
nounced the direction of Fields'

later work. He wanted h is poetry
to leave the world of the mind
and enter the world of the
senses.
Difficult journey
This journey out of the mind is
difficult. Intellectual skills can
be learned through many tradi
tional disciplines. But sensual
awareness is a more dangerous
state to attain. There is always
the possibility of overin
dulgence at any one spot along
the journey. Most of the many
disciplines that are offered seem
specious and limited.
A person usually needs a
teacher of some sort, and Fields
was no exception. He looks to

belly, was recently brought out
by David Godine, a prestigious
Boston publisher, to help inaugu
rate a poetry series. These two
books show Fields as a serious
poet developing an individual
style.
The Other Walker is a
poorly edited book. It contains
many poems that should not
have been collected in book
torm. At this stage of his career
Fields did not have enough
first-rate poems to fill 70
closely printed pages and pub
lished many pieces he should
have forgotten. Several poems
read like experiments in various
styles or meters and lack the in
tensity of Fields' best work.
This looseness of judgment is
a shame because The Other
Walker contains many excellent
poems, and it would be unfortu
nate if the reader was discour
aged by the less successful
poems before he found the many
gems. I am sure that part of the
reason that Fields' first book has
not received nearly the attention
it deserves was that few critics
took the trouble to read through
the entire book. Had Fields
worked with a better publisher
this neglect would not have oc
curred.
Best poems
The best poems in The Other
Walker show Fields' first style.
He wrote formal, well
controlled, intellectual poems.
As often as not the entire poem
was reflective. The speaker
talked about what had happened
or what might happen. In "Down
Along The Coast" Fields writes
to his wife:
We lived in moments: heard at
night the long
crash of the surf, delayed in its
full swell:
The broken motion of the moon,
the tides;
And in that change kneiv no
thing hut ourselves.
In the last poem of this first
book Fields consciously tries to
break away from the introspec
tion that characterized so much
of his early work:
An amateur
Of darkness and of the darkened
self
I had, for too long, felt closed in
by otherness.
This superb poem, signific
antly entitled "Today," an
nounced the direction of Fields'

later work. He wanted h is poetry
to leave the world of the mind
and enter the world of the
senses.
Difficult journey
This journey out of the mind is
difficult. Intellectual skills can
be learned through many tradi
tional disciplines. But sensual
awareness is a more dangerous
state to attain. There is always
the possibility of overin
dulgence at any one spot along
the journey. Most of the many
disciplines that are offered seem
specious and limited.
A person usually needs a
teacher of some sort, and Fields
was no exception. He looks to
ward Castenada's Don Juan.
While this identification did ex
pand Fields, the poetic results
entitled "Juan Songs" are very
modest.
The "Juan Songs" are thecent
ral section of Fields' second
book, Sunbelly. In the "Juan
Songs" there is a freedom and
naturalness absent in Fields' ear
lier poetry, but they also betray
the limitations of a style which
praises the external at the ex
pense of the internal.
Totemic songs
Like examples in Castenada's
books these poems are totemic
songs which capture the inner
essence of some magical object
or animal. Often that object is
speaking. They are precise and
objective, but as poems they
seem incomplete expressions of
Fields' talent.
In the best poems in Sunbelly
Fields uses a looser version of
his earlier style to examine the
excesses of the intellect. Cer
tainly the finest poem in the
book is "Boss" which describes
the suicide of Ernest Heming
way who killed himself with a
Boss shutgun. The beginning of
the poem is stunning:
All night he heard the sound of
mountain water,
The clear streams of the fxist fal
ling away
From a lake in the high country.
The black ducks then
And rainbows would be rising
with the sun
But not for him. It was already
over.
This poem is about more than
Hemingway. It is a sympathetic
but firm critique of any mind
that is fixed on nada. This poem
deserves to be better known. I
hope no anthologist lets it pass
him by.
Comic verse
One early interest that Fields
luckily did not abandon in his
second book is his flair for comic
verse. Sunbelly has a section of
epigrams that demonstrate this
rich part of Fields' talent in this
ancient form. My own favorite is
called "Biog.":
Poets are known by readers and

hy lovers:
Discreet, separate but equal
under covers.
Someday Fields may well re
place another Stanford poet, J.V.
Cunningham, as America's mas
ter of the epigram.
Sunbelly is a book by a poet
who is growing. It shows Fields
expanding his vision and
loosening his style. No final
opinion should be made about
him from this volume. His later
work will undoubtedly prove
any facile predictions wrong.
Both of Fields' books should
be read together. They show a
poet moving towards self
discovery and control. Perhaps
he has not totally arrived as an
important poet, but Sunbelly
shows him moving in the right
direction.
