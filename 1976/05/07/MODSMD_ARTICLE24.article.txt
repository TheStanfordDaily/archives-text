The publishing industry thrives on frequent
turn-over of hot items. And so it is unusual to find
a review, like this one, for a book published al
most four years ago. The fact is, hardly anything
in print will long stay in circulation without a
healthy publicity campaign to boost it. And when
William Hermanns' book The Holocaust first
came out, the publisher settled back and watched
it fade away from benign neglect. The result is,
now, a few years later, a worthwhile book is about
to become unavailable and almost unknown (un
less somehow a paperback edition emerges).
The Holocaust is a personal account by a man
who survived the bayonets, the damp trenches
and the poison gas of the Battle of Verdun. It is
also a powerful testimony to the courage a person
can find when his conscience is awakened to
something higher than the call of honor. In fact,
this short, gripping narrative is the story of a con
version: from a young soldier, who begins as a
crusader for Germany, to a penitent human being,
who cries out against the atrocity committed in
the name of his country.
I
In 1916 the armies of Germany and France met
around the French village of Verdun, and there
remained locked in battle for more than two years.
For the Kaiser of Germany, obsessed with ideas of
conquest and glory, retreat was unthinkable, even
though the youth of his country was marching to
slaughter under his command. In the end,
a million men were killed, and Verdun is re
membered as one of the most brutal moments in
history. In its aftermath, the Kaiser lost the war,
and his throne.
Not surprisingly, The Holocaust was first pub
lished during the height of the Vietnam war. Its
author, a poet and longtime a teacher at San Jose
State University, found his students turning to
him for help, because they believed that what had
happened at Verdun was also happening in Viet
nam. His recollections, which had been circulat
ing in manuscript, finally were published. But
somehow the book got lost in the shuffle; too
much was going on at the time — in Vietnam and
then around Watergate — for people to be con
cerned about a battle that had taken place six
decades before.

Now, in 1976, after the rubble from a brutal war
has begun to settle and after Americans have seen
their own leaders unmasked, it is easier to under
stand the experiences of the young volunteer in
the Kaiser's army. The Holocaust reads today wi th
remarkable force and cogency.
Though it will be of interest to historians, Her
manns' book is not, strictly speaking, an historical
account. As he says in his introduction, "my con
cern is with the people, young and old, soldiers
and civilians, whose lives are permanently af
fected and often destroyed because of policy deci
sions and political expediency."
His book shares with good fiction a power of
plunging the reader completely into the flow of
events. The author's own gentleness and idealism
are quickly tested after he leaves his nurturing
aunt and sisters and volunteers to fight. In the
army, he finds himself taunted by an officer be
cause of his bourgeois background, yet responds
with dignity. He is appalled at the hypocrisy of
the war-mongering German clergymen, and won
ders why the truth has to be kept hidden in time of
fighting. Finally, in the trenches of Verdun, he is
there beside his friends who fall from bullet
wounds and from poison gas attacks.
The author tells how he was saved from death
three times, "as if by a miracle." But it is clear
from his account that he survived the war also
through his own courage. Had he not convinced
his stubborn captain to surrender to the French,
he and all his fellow soldiers would have been
killed. Had he not had the humility to recognize
his kinship with the French he was called to fight,
he might never have survived the French captiv-"
ity. After the spiritual mutilation of the war has
begun to heal, Willie Hermanns, a 20-year-old
prisoner of war, sees "how inhuman a uniform
can make a man."
Despite a few flaws in editing, especially a few
passages that read too much like translation, the
pace of The Holocaust is so exciting that most
readers will find it hard to put down. The narra
tive admirably creates the details and sensibility
of a period in German life when people believed
their leader was the emissary of God on earth. And
while The Holocaust does not deliver a new mes
sage, it says — in its vivid and personal way —
something that can probably never be repeated
too many times.

Reviewed by Elliot Klein
The publishing industry thrives on frequent
turn-over of hot items. And so it is unusual to find
a review, like this one, for a book published al
most four years ago. The fact is, hardly anything
in print will long stay in circulation without a
healthy publicity campaign to boost it. And when
William Hermanns' book The Holocaust first
came out, the publisher settled back and watched
it fade away from benign neglect. The result is,
now, a few years later, a worthwhile book is about
to become unavailable and almost unknown (un
less somehow a paperback edition emerges).
The Holocaust is a personal account by a man
who survived the bayonets, the damp trenches
and the poison gas of the Battle of Verdun. It is
also a powerful testimony to the courage a person
can find when his conscience is awakened to
something higher than the call of honor. In fact,
this short, gripping narrative is the story of a con
version: from a young soldier, who begins as a
crusader for Germany, to a penitent human being,
who cries out against the atrocity committed in
the name of his country.
I
In 1916 the armies of Germany and France met
around the French village of Verdun, and there
remained locked in battle for more than two years.
For the Kaiser of Germany, obsessed with ideas of
conquest and glory, retreat was unthinkable, even
though the youth of his country was marching to
slaughter under his command. In the end,
a million men were killed, and Verdun is re
membered as one of the most brutal moments in
history. In its aftermath, the Kaiser lost the war,
and his throne.
Not surprisingly, The Holocaust was first pub
lished during the height of the Vietnam war. Its
author, a poet and longtime a teacher at San Jose
State University, found his students turning to
him for help, because they believed that what had
happened at Verdun was also happening in Viet
nam. His recollections, which had been circulat
ing in manuscript, finally were published. But
somehow the book got lost in the shuffle; too
much was going on at the time — in Vietnam and
then around Watergate — for people to be con
cerned about a battle that had taken place six
decades before.

Now, in 1976, after the rubble from a brutal war
has begun to settle and after Americans have seen
their own leaders unmasked, it is easier to under
stand the experiences of the young volunteer in
the Kaiser's army. The Holocaust reads today wi th
remarkable force and cogency.
Though it will be of interest to historians, Her
manns' book is not, strictly speaking, an historical
account. As he says in his introduction, "my con
cern is with the people, young and old, soldiers
and civilians, whose lives are permanently af
fected and often destroyed because of policy deci
sions and political expediency."
His book shares with good fiction a power of
plunging the reader completely into the flow of
events. The author's own gentleness and idealism
are quickly tested after he leaves his nurturing
aunt and sisters and volunteers to fight. In the
army, he finds himself taunted by an officer be
cause of his bourgeois background, yet responds
with dignity. He is appalled at the hypocrisy of
the war-mongering German clergymen, and won
ders why the truth has to be kept hidden in time of
fighting. Finally, in the trenches of Verdun, he is
there beside his friends who fall from bullet
wounds and from poison gas attacks.
The author tells how he was saved from death
three times, "as if by a miracle." But it is clear
from his account that he survived the war also
through his own courage. Had he not convinced
his stubborn captain to surrender to the French,
he and all his fellow soldiers would have been
killed. Had he not had the humility to recognize
his kinship with the French he was called to fight,
he might never have survived the French captiv-"
ity. After the spiritual mutilation of the war has
begun to heal, Willie Hermanns, a 20-year-old
prisoner of war, sees "how inhuman a uniform
can make a man."
Despite a few flaws in editing, especially a few
passages that read too much like translation, the
pace of The Holocaust is so exciting that most
readers will find it hard to put down. The narra
tive admirably creates the details and sensibility
of a period in German life when people believed
their leader was the emissary of God on earth. And
while The Holocaust does not deliver a new mes
sage, it says — in its vivid and personal way —
something that can probably never be repeated
