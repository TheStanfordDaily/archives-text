More than 12 years after the assas
sination of President John F. Ken
nedy. millions of Americans — in
cluding responsible journalists, pub
lic officials, medical experts and
former intelligence agents — still be
lieve the killing to have been the
work of an organized conspiracy.
Judging by the outpouring of arti
cles, books, public lectures, televi
sion programs and radio talk shows
on the assassination, it would appear
that the public's demand for a new.
impartial investigation has never
been greater.
The public's dissatisfaction with
the Warren Report stems both from
the obvious inadequacy of its handl
ing of evidence, and from a new and
profound distrust of government in
the wake of Watergate. It no longer
seems so implausible that the FBI or
CIA would cover up evidence tend
ing to reflect badly on their opera
tions. In the light of CIA-Mafia assas
sination plots against Castro, it no
longer seems so improbable that a
"rogue" assassination unit turned on
Kennedy following the Bay of Pigs
disaster.
The spate of new books and articles
leaves many Americans bewildered
as to where to find reliable informa
tion on the assassination. Many fine
monographs are available, but a few
stand out.

The best place to begin is with Syl
via Meagher's masterpiece, Acces
sories After The Fact. Meagher sub
jects the Warren Report to withering
scrutiny, critically comparing its
conclusions and assertions against
the factual record. The best of the
"first generation" critics, she is care
ful never to speculate excessively re
garding "who did it" or about the
motives of the officials who covered
up or bungled the investigation. The
reader, however, will leave the book
appalled by the FBI, the Warren
commission and the Dallas police.
Meagher systematically recon
structs a plausible alibi for Oswald,
and throws doubt on every aspect of
the Commission's case — that Os
wald bought a Manlicher Carcano,
that he carried it into the Texas
School Book Depository building,
that he ever fired it, that he killed
Officer Tippit, and so forth. As one
who began her book convinced that
Oswald was at least one of several
assassins, if not the only one, I
finished with my assumptions sha
ken.
Such findings do no more than
discredit the Warren Report. Many
recent writers, impatient to find the
killers after all these years, have ad
vanced hypotheses as to the nature of
the conspiracy.
Theme expanded
Robert Sam Anson, in They've Kil
led the President points to CIA-
Mafia involvement. (His is the best
overall book on the assassination.) As
Anson notes, the Kennedy administ
ration's crackdown on organized
crime and the Mafia-ridden

Teamsters Union gave the Mafia
every reason to kill its enemy and
put Lyndon Johnson into office.
(Johnson, while still President, was
accused in a national magazine of
having taken payoffs from organized
crime while a senator.)
The theory seems especial ly plaus
ible in light of the intelligence or
crime background of so many Ken
nedy assassination figures. Take Os
wald — stationed while in the
Marines at one of the world's largest
CIA bases (Atsugi, Japan), he ob
tained a hardship discharge in record
time, traveled to the U.S.S.R. despite
an inadequate bank account, "de
fected," returned to the U.S. two
years later, received a new passport
and a transport allowance without
question and was met at the airport
not by a suspicious FBI agent but by
the secretary general of the American
Friends of the Anti-Bolshevik Na
tions — hardly the sort of man ex
pected to associate with a "Marxist."
Later, Oswald set up a one-man
pro-Castro committee in New Or
leans, operating out of an office used
by CIA-sponsored right wing anti-
Castro Cubans. These and other as
pects of his career smack more of U.S.
intelligence than of the "one lone
nut" syndrome. Oswald's pro
communist cover, however, proved
convenient for those who set him up.
Jack Ruby's connections were with
organized crime. Widely portrayed
as an insignificant, patriotic bar
owner who killed Oswald to spare
Jackie Kennedy the pain of testifying
in a trial. Ruby was actually a major
Dallas organized crime figure who

first reached heights in the mob dur
ing his days as a Chicago labor boss.
Narcotics syndicate
FBI reports from the 1950s list
Ruby as a kingpin of a nationwide
narcotics syndicate. (He later became
an occasional FBI informer.) And he
was on intimate terms with gamblers
from Las Vegas to Cuba — the same
ones who saw Castro expropriate
their billion dollar concessions. Did
Ruby shoot Oswald on higher orders,
to prevent Oswald from proving his
innocence, with the expectation of
receiving parole (and a big bank ac
count) in a few years?
This is speculation, and it may be
that the assassins have so well co
vered their traces that a new investi
gation would never uncover them.
But there is a mistake in assuming
that the only purpose of an investiga
tion would be to find the culprits.
Actually, it might prove even more
valuable as an education in the ex
traordinary dangers inherent in the
existence of "large and sometimes
overlapping networks of intelligence
agencies and organized crime where
secrecy is a way of life.
"In retrospect, the Dallas cover-up
can be seen to involve many of these
elements. The mere hint of an infor
mant relationship between Oswald
and the FBI raised 'national sec
urity' problems — not the proposi
tion that the FBI had plotted the as
sassination. but the more general
embarrassment of any links between
the agency and the assumed de
mented leftist.
"Jackßuby's friends in the Dallas
police department and the Chicago

underworld posed similar embar
rassments — promoting evasive tes
timony from the FBI and others who
had secrets to keep which were unre
lated to the assassination . . .(such as
the) CIA assassination plots directed
against Castro — at least one of which
was even more embarrassing because
it involved the proposed use of Mafia
hit men."
Covert networks
This long quote appears in The As
sassinations: Dallas and Beyond,
edited by Peter Hock, Russ Stetler
and Peter Dale Scott. Professor Scott
is the man most responsible for
showing that the incestuous and sec
retive nature of covert networks pro
tected by "national security" justifi
cations, breeds crime, conspiracy
and coverups.
The Assassinations makes valu
able reading alongside any standard
"text," because it pulls together arti
cles from such obscure sources as
Texas Observer and Forensic Sci
ence. Particularly valuable are
Scott's famous articles, "Prom Dallas
to Watergate," examining the paral
lels and direct links between Ameri
ca's two greatest modern scandals,
and Sylvia Meagher's demonstration
that David Helin. attorney for both
the Warren and Rockefeller CIA
commissions, may have suborned
perjury.
The Assassinations also contains a
few suggestive articles questioning
the official findings of the Martin
Luther King and Robert Kennedy kil
lings.
