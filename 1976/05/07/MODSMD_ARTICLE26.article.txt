## Netters play Gaters in team tennis debut 
### Paul Bauman 
Stanford tennis will stroll
down yet another unexplored
path tonight when the Cardinals
meet the Golden Gaters of World
Team Tennis (WTT) in an un
precedented exhibition match.
Flay is set for 7 p.m. before an
expected crowd of SUCJU in
Maples Pavilion,
The Card men and women will
once again combine forces, but
this time they'll go against estab
lished professionals, some of
whom rank among the top
players in the world.
The match will follow the
WTT format of one set each of
men's singles, women's singles,
men's doubles, women's dou
bles and mixed doubles. Set
scores will be added to deter
mine the overall match winner.
"We feel the match will be a
great spectator attraction," said
Stanford men's coach Dick
Gould. "It will be a fun event for
the players while adding a new
dimension to tennis at Stan
ford."
The Golden Gaters' roster,
with five foreigners and one

American, reads like a roll-call at
the United Nations. There are
Tom Okker and Betty Stove from
Holland, Francoise Durr of
France, Frew McMillan from
South Africa, Racquel Giscafre
of Argentina and Jeff Borowiak
all the way from Berkeley.
Henry Kissinger should be the
Gaters' coach.
In addition to being one of the
most international teams in the
WTT, the Gaters (1975 Western
Division champions) may also
be the most talented.
The 5-foot-10, 140-lb. Okker is
the ninth-ranked player in the
world and last year was named
WTT Most Valuable Player. One
of Okker's accomplishments is
winning the French Open dou
bles title in 1973.
Cool player
In his book, Portrait in Motion,
Arthur Ashe says Okker "proba
bly has the coolest attitude in the
game ... If we wereall like Tom,
the psychiatrists would go out of
business."
Durr, ranked No. 1 in France,
has used the French Open, one of

tennis' four biggest tourna
ments, as a personal advertising
campaign. "Frankie" has won
the singles title once, the dou
bles championship five straight
times, and the mixed doubles
title three times.
Stove, who at 6-0, 150 lbs.
makes Okker look like a
munchkin, is the lOth-ranked
woman in the world. She won
the Wimbledon doubles champ
ionship with Billie Jean King in
1972.
McMillan may be the only
player in the world known more
for his tennis apparel than his
tennis. Which is too bad because
he's one of the best doubles
players in the world and has two
Wimbledon titles to prove it.
McMillan's claim to fashion
fame is that he is never seen on a
tennis court, indoors or out,
without his white sportsman's
cap.
Borowiak and Giscafre are the
Gaters' two new additions.
Borowiak is a former NCAA
singles and doubles champion
from UCLA.
Probable lineups
Gould and women's coach
Anne Hill have announced a
lineup, but McMillan, the Gat
ers' player-coach, has not as yet
named his starters.
All the Gaters will be at
Maples, and, assuming McMil
lan goes with his top players, the
matchups should be: Bill Maze
against Okker in men's singles,
Lele Forood against Durr in wo
men's singles, Perry Wright and
Matt Mitchell vs. Okker and
Borowiak in men's doubles, Barb
Jordan and Diane Morrison
against Durr and Stove in wo
men's doubles and Mark Mitch
ell and Susie Hagey versus
McMillan and Stove in mixed
doubles.
There will also be a special
mixed doubles exhibition match
teaming Craig Johnson and Liza
Pande against John Rast and
Marcy O'Keefe, all Stanford
players.
Gene Mayer was originally
scheduled to play against the
Gaters but the junior is on the
shelf again with a viral infection.
Pat DuPre, Stanford's No. 1
man, is currently playing as an
amateur in a professional tour
nament inNorth Carolina. Gould
gave him permission to leave so
he could start preparing for his
pro career, which will begin in
June.

all the way from Berkeley.
Henry Kissinger should be the
Gaters' coach.
In addition to being one of the
most international teams in the
WTT, the Gaters (1975 Western
Division champions) may also
be the most talented.
The 5-foot-10, 140-lb. Okker is
the ninth-ranked player in the
world and last year was named
WTT Most Valuable Player. One
of Okker's accomplishments is
winning the French Open dou
bles title in 1973.
Cool player
In his book, Portrait in Motion,
Arthur Ashe says Okker "proba
bly has the coolest attitude in the
game ... If we wereall like Tom,
the psychiatrists would go out of
business."
Durr, ranked No. 1 in France,
has used the French Open, one of

tennis' four biggest tourna
ments, as a personal advertising
campaign. "Frankie" has won
the singles title once, the dou
bles championship five straight
times, and the mixed doubles
title three times.
Stove, who at 6-0, 150 lbs.
makes Okker look like a
munchkin, is the lOth-ranked
woman in the world. She won
the Wimbledon doubles champ
ionship with Billie Jean King in
1972.
McMillan may be the only
player in the world known more
for his tennis apparel than his
tennis. Which is too bad because
he's one of the best doubles
players in the world and has two
Wimbledon titles to prove it.
McMillan's claim to fashion
fame is that he is never seen on a
tennis court, indoors or out,
without his white sportsman's
cap.
Borowiak and Giscafre are the
Gaters' two new additions.
Borowiak is a former NCAA
singles and doubles champion
from UCLA.
Probable lineups
Gould and women's coach
Anne Hill have announced a
lineup, but McMillan, the Gat
ers' player-coach, has not as yet
named his starters.
All the Gaters will be at
Maples, and, assuming McMil
lan goes with his top players, the
matchups should be: Bill Maze
against Okker in men's singles,
Lele Forood against Durr in wo
men's singles, Perry Wright and
Matt Mitchell vs. Okker and
Borowiak in men's doubles, Barb
Jordan and Diane Morrison
against Durr and Stove in wo
men's doubles and Mark Mitch

McMillan and Stove in mixed
doubles.
There will also be a special
mixed doubles exhibition match
teaming Craig Johnson and Liza
Pande against John Rast and
Marcy O'Keefe, all Stanford
players.
Gene Mayer was originally
scheduled to play against the
Gaters but the junior is on the
shelf again with a viral infection.
Pat DuPre, Stanford's No. 1
man, is currently playing as an
amateur in a professional tour
nament inNorth Carolina. Gould
gave him permission to leave so
he could start preparing for his
pro career, which will begin in
June.
Stanford tennis will stroll
down yet another unexplored
path tonight when the Cardinals
meet the Golden Gaters of World
Team Tennis (WTT) in an un
precedented exhibition match.
Flay is set for 7 p.m. before an
expected crowd of SUCJU in
Maples Pavilion,
The Card men and women will
once again combine forces, but
this time they'll go against estab
lished professionals, some of
whom rank among the top
players in the world.
The match will follow the
WTT format of one set each of
men's singles, women's singles,
men's doubles, women's dou
bles and mixed doubles. Set
scores will be added to deter
mine the overall match winner.
"We feel the match will be a
great spectator attraction," said
Stanford men's coach Dick
Gould. "It will be a fun event for
the players while adding a new
dimension to tennis at Stan
ford."
The Golden Gaters' roster,
with five foreigners and one

American, reads like a roll-call at
