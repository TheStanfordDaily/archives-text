# Jordan's big comeback
## 
### Roy S. Johnson 
Nine years ago, 10-year-old Barbara Jordan
walked onto a tennis court in Swarthmore, Pa. and
prepared to start her first tournament. She was
facing another 10-year-old girl, Gary Wood. The
day was hot and the competition was tough.
"I remember it well," Jordan said of the experi
ence."lgot creamed."
But, apparently the defeat didn't get Jordan
down. Since then she has gone on to such feats as
being ranked No. 2 nationally in 1975 Juniors in
both singles and doubles. She reached the quar
terfinals of the Junior Wimbledon Tournament
that same year.
And now, as a freshman, Barb is the No. 2 player
of the Cards' women's tennis squad — one of the
top teams in the nation.
So, what happened to Gary Wood?
'Quit circuit'
"Well, she quit the circuit the next year," Jor
don says. It's probably just as well for Gary. Be
cause if the two had met since the first time,
chances are the results wouldn't have been the
same.
Jordan, from King of Prussia, Pa., was recruited
heavily by several other schools.
So why did she come all the way out to Stan
ford?
"Stanford already had an excellent tennis
team," Jordan says. "Much more so than any of the
other schools that I considered."
"The climate's much nicer than at home," she
adds. "And the scholarship didn't hurt either."

Jordan is one of the few women athletes at Stan
ford on scholarship. As a matter of fact, she's one
of the few women athletes in the country on scho
larship.
One of the smallest
At 5-5,120 pounds Jordan is one of the smallest
women on the squad.
"I usually don't hit the ball that hard" she says.
But she says she does like to consider herself an
aggressive player.
Jordan says she considers her backhand cross
court volley as her best shot. "I like to hit my
backhand most," Barb says."And then go in and
play the net."
"Really," she admits with a smile. "Any shot
that wins a point ... 1 like."
Jordan says she has had some "good times" this
season and hasn't really felt much pressure play
ing behind No. 1 Lele Forood, who is considered
one of the top amateur players in the world.
Jordan says, "It's tough to keep up (academi
cally) during the season."
She has no major,and now she's just "trying to
do well in a lot of different courses."
At the end of high school, Jordan was drafted by
the Indiana Loves of World Team Tennis but
didn't really give it a serious thought.
"Getting drafted by Indiana." she says, "is like
being drafted by the old Houston Oilers (a pro
football team). It's a bad fate.
"I'm not nearly ready to turn pro anyway," she
says. "I'm sure I'd consider it in a few years. But,
right now, school's treating me well."

"Well, she quit the circuit the next year," Jor
don says. It's probably just as well for Gary. Be
cause if the two had met since the first time,
chances are the results wouldn't have been the
same.
Jordan, from King of Prussia, Pa., was recruited
heavily by several other schools.
So why did she come all the way out to Stan
ford?
"Stanford already had an excellent tennis
team," Jordan says. "Much more so than any of the
other schools that I considered."
"The climate's much nicer than at home," she
adds. "And the scholarship didn't hurt either."

Jordan is one of the few women athletes at Stan
ford on scholarship. As a matter of fact, she's one
of the few women athletes in the country on scho
larship.
One of the smallest
At 5-5,120 pounds Jordan is one of the smallest
women on the squad.
"I usually don't hit the ball that hard" she says.
But she says she does like to consider herself an
aggressive player.
Jordan says she considers her backhand cross
court volley as her best shot. "I like to hit my
backhand most," Barb says."And then go in and
play the net."
"Really," she admits with a smile. "Any shot
that wins a point ... 1 like."
Jordan says she has had some "good times" this
season and hasn't really felt much pressure play
ing behind No. 1 Lele Forood, who is considered
one of the top amateur players in the world.
Jordan says, "It's tough to keep up (academi
cally) during the season."
She has no major,and now she's just "trying to
do well in a lot of different courses."
At the end of high school, Jordan was drafted by
the Indiana Loves of World Team Tennis but
didn't really give it a serious thought.
"Getting drafted by Indiana." she says, "is like
being drafted by the old Houston Oilers (a pro
football team). It's a bad fate.
"I'm not nearly ready to turn pro anyway," she
says. "I'm sure I'd consider it in a few years. But,
right now, school's treating me well."

Barb Jordan
Nine years ago, 10-year-old Barbara Jordan
walked onto a tennis court in Swarthmore, Pa. and
prepared to start her first tournament. She was
facing another 10-year-old girl, Gary Wood. The
day was hot and the competition was tough.
"I remember it well," Jordan said of the experi
ence."lgot creamed."
But, apparently the defeat didn't get Jordan
down. Since then she has gone on to such feats as
being ranked No. 2 nationally in 1975 Juniors in
both singles and doubles. She reached the quar
terfinals of the Junior Wimbledon Tournament
that same year.
And now, as a freshman, Barb is the No. 2 player
of the Cards' women's tennis squad — one of the
top teams in the nation.
So, what happened to Gary Wood?
'Quit circuit'
