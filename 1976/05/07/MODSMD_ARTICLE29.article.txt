Trackmen enter relays
A small nucleus of the Stan
ford track team travels to Fresno
tomorrow for the annual West
Coast Relays. The Robber Barons
will be represented by two relay
teams and several individuals
competing in the open events.
"They will be there trying to
sharpen their edges for next
week's Pac-8 Championships,"
said Stanford coach Payton Jor
dan. Pacific-8 powers (JSC,
UCLA and UC-Berkeley will also
be at Fresno, preparing for the
conference meet next Friday and
Saturday in Berkeley.
Jordan said he feels the mile
relay team of Scott Wingo, Alan
Sheats, Matt Hogsett and James
Lofton should turn in its best
time of the season because none
of them will have to double in
other races.
The quartet has a season best
of 3:10.8, three-tenths of a sec
ond off the school record.
Paul McCarthy, Tom Pitch
ford, Harold Celms and Mark
Hadley will share the baton in

the two-mile relay.
Senior Tony Sandoval drew a
short assignment this weekend
— the 1500 meters. Sandoval
will run either the 5000 or
10,000 meters in next week's
championships in Berkeley and
then fly to Eugene the next
weekend for the U.S. Olympic
Marathon Trials.
John Foster rounds off the Ba
rons' contingent. The senior
from Los Altos will compete in
his specialty, the 110 meter high
hurdles.
Brad Slinkard will put the shot
for Stanford at Fresno and
sophomore Mark Hill, who
threw a lifetime best of 168-
foot-7against Cal Saturday, will
toss the discus. Seniors John
Macrorie and Bob Flint will
compete in the javelin and pole
vault respectively. James Lofton
will put his undefeated record in
the long jump on the line.
