# Murphy defends GM ethics
## 
### Jack Vaughn 
Americans must consider local
business and political practices before
passing judgment on multinational
corporations' activities abroad, Gen
eral Motors' chief executive officer and
board chairman Thomas Murphy said
yesterday.
Speaking before a crowd of 200 per
sons in Bishop Auditorium on "Corpo
rate Ethics," Murphy said domestic
disrespect for law coupled with differ
ing political and economic practices
overseas cloud the moral issue of
American corporations making politi
cal contributions and even bribing of
ficials in other countries.
"We have to strive for an under
standing" of how business activities
relate to foreign customs, Murphy
said. He added, however, that such an
understanding could not justify brib
ery, which he said is against the law in
almost all nations.
On the other hand, he said, corpo
rate political contributions, illegal in
this country, "may not only be legal
but honorable political practices a
broad."
Permissible and acceptable
Murphy said critics of American
business must take into account "the
times in which we live" and realize
that "what is permissible and accepta
ble in one sector of society is con
demned in another."
Murphy cited thefts of corporate re
cords later given to the press. "Those
who have done this have been made
heroes in some quarters for having sto
len," he said, adding that if these re
cords had been given directly to
foreign agents, "they (the leaders)
would have been jailed."
Murphy said payments to foreign of
ficials by other corporations were
often made "under duress," when

local officials threatened the well
bei ng of the corporations unless bribes
were given.
Nonetheless, "what we must realize
is that our duty to our company — to
our stockholders and our employes —
is not necessarily the supreme one," he
cautionea.
Moral standards
"If we (corporate executives) apply
to ourselves the moral standards we
apply to others," there will be no prob
lem of corporate illegality, he said.
Murphy outlined GM's policy to
ward relations with foreign host gov
ernments: "We recognize that we have

the opportunity to influence nations
toward progressive change," but at the
same time GM wants to avoid "fruit
less interference in the political pro
cess of other countries."
He cited the controversial GM pre
sence in South Africa which he said
does not indicate that his corporation
condones the political situation there.
"By working within the system," he
said, while not itself practicing racial
discrimination, GM "has been able to
make social and economic progress"
in South Africa.
"Black people there have told me,

ETHICAL RELATIVITY—Thomas Murphy, CM chief executive, called for
understanding of business activity as it relates to prevailing foreign customs.
He said the presence of GM plants in South Africa and Chile did not, however,
indicate a condoning of their political practices.
'Don't leave us,' because the level of
opportunity" in South Africa has been
raised by C.M's presence, and "espe
cially that of the blacks because they
are the majority." he said.
Limits
He cautioned, however, that there
are limits on corporate responsibility
for social change. "I deplore apartheid,
but while I deplore it. I do not advocate
violence to overthrow it,"he said.
Murphy said that he personally pro
tested calls for GM to abandon its
plants in Chile. GM, he said, may have
to pull out of the South American
country only because "someone
doesn't like the way Chile is conduct
ing its affairs.
"We have to be guests there; we have
to respect the way they do things
there" and not leave the country, he
said.
Regarding GM's domestic policies
Murphy said that it is not business'
ethical responsibility to alter con
sumer wants in the United States.
"We've never been successful in tel
ling people what to buy," he said.
Full-size cars
For this reason, GM continues to
build large-sized cars, he explained.

"I don't think it's surprising they
(the American people) want full-size
cars" for family use, he said, adding
that "what we're trying to do is take
size and weight out of all our cars,"
without affecting carrying ability, in
order to provide "improved fuel capa
bility."
Murphy said that "GM's goal is to
serve the public and do what the pub
lic wants" rather than to "tell the pub
lic what it wants. •
"We should never be at variance
with what the real interests of this
country are: what the public wants,"
he said.
