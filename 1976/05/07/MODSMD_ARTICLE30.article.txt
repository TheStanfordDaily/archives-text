# Sailors meet wave of successes

The 14-foot Laser speeds away from
the dock, its sail swollen with 40 m.p.h.
winds. The sailor dips his head, grace
fully escaping the boom that sweeps ac
ross the boat as he heads out into the
harbor. He seems to be having trouble
keeping the boat upright in the gusting
winds. Suddenly the boat tips over,
sprawling sideways in the middle of the
harbor.
But the sailor isn't a bit troubled. He
just climbs over the side and onto the
centerboard, forcing the boat upright as
he jumps back into the bow. He con
tinues sailing, the boat tipping over sev
eral times, until the wind snaps part of
the mast off, forcing him to quit for the
day.
This persevering showing by Hugh
Cullman, a member of Stanford's sailing
team,was in keeping with his team's at
titude. Even the sight of a dry Lake
Lagunita has failed to discourage the
squad, which practices at the Palo Alto
Yacht Club, Redwood City or Searsville
Lake two afternoons a week.
The sailing team is enjoying a tre
mendous season this year, according to
its coach, Wim Steenbakkers. "We al
ready have one sailor, Peter Skinner,
qualifying for the Intercollegiate Na
tional Championships in New York this
June," he said.
Second place
Skinner qualified for the nationals by
taking second place in the Pacific Dis
trict Single-Handed Championships last
week. The race was an unexpected suc
cess for Stanford, with Skinner,
Cullman and Alan Andrews placing in
the top eight.
"We were overwhelmed to have done
so well," said Steenbakkers. "We are
having the best season ever in the sailing
team's three-year history. I think we have
a psychological advantage over the other
teams now, and I expect our sailors to do
well throughout the rest of the season.
"We finished second to Sonoma State
in the northern California series, which

was kind of a disappointment." con
tinued Steenbakkers. "It would have
been nice to get first place, but our im
portant races, the Pacific District Qual
ifying Championships, are just coming
up now. The Pacific District is one of the
toughest in the country," he added. "Be
sides having a lot of skill, you just have
to be lucky to win."
Team cap
The captain of the sailing team is Alan
Andrews. One of the top two skippers on
the team, Andrews is ranked No.
4 in the district.
"I've been sailing all my life," An
drews explained. "I'm addicted to it."
Andrews is a junior, majoring in
mechanical engineering.
As team captain, Andrews said he
spends a lot of time with "sailing
bureaucracy." His duties include bor
rowing boats, writing fund-raising let
ters to alumni and deciding team sailing
positions.
Andrews also represents Stanford in
devising California district sailing
policies and adjusting regatta schedules.
Andrews said he is very pleased with
the team's efforts so far this year.
"The team's pretty hot," he remarked.
Work well together
"We work well together and we've
shown tremendous improvement over
last year. We've also begun to have better
facilities and equipment," he continued.
Steenbakkers said the team has some
very competent sailors. Andrews and
Skinner are the top skippers, Skin
ner receiving honorable mention as
skipper by the district last month. Russel
Winslow, who is Andrews' crew, won
the honor of number one crewman in the
district.
"The coach is also doing a great job,"
Andrews said. "He works an average of
six days a week. The sailing team
wouldn't have the status it does in the
Athletic Department if it weren't for
him."
Steenbakkers has begun recruiting

high school students trom around the
country to join the sailing team.
"Now we can offer students a good
program," he explained, "1 wouldn't
want to persuade anyone to come to
Stanford just because of its sailing team
but 1 think it has a lot to offer."
'Great way out'
"Sailing is a sport with carry-over
value—what a student does here at Stan
ford can be just the start of his sailing
career. It's a great way out for
businessman. They may have had a hec
tic week, but when Friday comes they
can hitch up their boat and go sailing for
the weekend. Sailing is relaxing. It has a
way of putting things back into the right
perspective."
Steenbakkers began sailing in his na
tive Holland, where sailing is a national
sport. But sailing is more than a sport, he
claimed.
"For me, it's a way of life. In sailing,
it's you against the elements. The ele
ments always put you in your place.
They are always master."
"1 really became aware of the power of
the elements when I sailed from Holland
to the Carribbean a few years ago," he
recalled.
"We were caught in a st6rm in the
middle of the Atlantic ocean. We were
totally surrounded by 40-foot waves—l
didn't see the bow for five days. 1 realized
then that you can't challenge nature. You
have to take what comes, you don't attack
or you'll go under. All you can do is try to
stay afloat."
Sailing is a year-round sport and the
team has been practicing and competing
since October. The climax of the season,
however, is in the next four weeks.
Steenbakkers is hopeful that more of the
team besides Skinner will have a chance
to compete in the Intercollegiate Na
tional Championships, which will be
held in Kingspoint, New York, JuneB-19.
"It would be great to have more of our
team represented in nationals," he con
cluded. "I think we can do it, and I'd love
to see it happen."
