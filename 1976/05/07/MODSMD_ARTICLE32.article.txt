### George Anders 
Reflecting on his team's 4-0
loss to San Francisco State Wed
nesday, Stanford baseball coach
Ray Young said "I'm not sure we
were there except in body."
The Cards got only three hits
against a San Francisco team
they had beaten, 8-1, in a game
the previous Wednesday.
"It was a flat day," Young
explained. He added it was the
first such game since March.
Three San Francisco pitchers
combined for the shutout. Ac
cording to Stanford shortstop
Steve Davis, "some of the pitch
ers were even JV pitchers"
brought up to the varsity.
Brian Harrison started for
Stanford and was tagged for the

loss, dropping his record to 5-3.
"Harrison's struggling a bit,"
Young said. "He's trying to find
his control and his confidence."
After the defeat, Young had
his hitters go through a baserufi
ning drill for 30 minutes. In ad
dition to the running. Young
said, "Every time we'd take a
breather we'd go over things that
happened in the game," as he
pointed out mental mistakes to
players.
According to Davis, the Cards
were "pointing towards the
weekend" during Wednesday's
game.
Stanford plays a three game
California Intercollegiate
Baseball Association series
against UC-Santa Barbara there,

with a single game this after
noon and a doubleheader tomor
row.
Although the Cards swept a
three game series against Santa
Barbara here, several weeks ago,
Young cautioned, "It's going to
be a cat-and-mouse type thing."
Young noted that the Cards,
now 9-9 in CIBA play, still could
win the league title, but that it
would be "very difficult. It
would take so many things
. . . before we could even have
a shot at it."
