# Card shortstop fights slump
## Davis eyes pro baseball 
### Jim Reitzes 
As a freshman, he was the
starting shortstop on Stanford's
baseball team and hit .309.
As a junior, he was named to
the NCAA's District-8 All-
Conference team.
But during this, his senior
year, Steve Davis has been in a
month-and-a-half slump. His
average has dropped from a high
of around .380 in March to .301
now.
"Steve has brought an awful
lot of pressure on himself," Stan
ford baseball coach Ray Young
said. "I've moved him down in
the lineup to try to help him out.
He's not watching the ball at the

plate. You can tell he's overeager
and having trouble concentrat
ing.
"Steve usually plays better in
the second half of the season,
especially in league," Young
said. But this year, Davis is hit
ting only .217 in California In
tercollegiate Baseball Associa
tion (CIBA) play.
Play pro ball
Davis said he would like to
play professional baseball. "I'm
not particular where I want to
play," he explained. "Anyplace
that can use my skills as a player
is fine. I just don't want to say
down in the minors too long."
At 6-foot-l and 180 lbs., Davis
is larger than most pro
shortstops. Me said "some teams
want me to play shortstop and
some say 1 should play another
position."
According to Young, "the pros
probably are not looking at him
as favorably because of his re
cent showing, but I'm sure
they'll at least draft him because
of past performance.
"He's not a picture ballplayer
offensively or defensively, but
he gets the job done."
'Power shortstop'
Analyzing his fielding, Davis
said, "I'm a power shortstop. I'm
not exceptionally quick, but I try
to make sure an out is made on
the play. I don't try to be fancy."
Teammate Dave Perez said
Davis has helped him with field
ing. Perez, a sophomore, was the
Cards' starting second baseman
this year, until being injured.
"The first couple days of prac
tice last year, I didn't expect

anyone to help me out," Perez
recalled. "But Steve went out of
his way, even taking time after
practice. He helped me out
plenty, and I didn't feel like such
an outcast because I was a
freshman."
Perez added that he believes
Davis is a team leader who
"gains respect by his play. He's
quiet, but he's a positive person.
He displays the confidence of a
winner."
Fourth place
This season, Stanford has been
a less consistent winner. It has
won most non-league games but
is in fourth place in the five team
CIBA, with a 9-9 record.
Davis said academic pressures
have affected Stanford baseball.
"When you play 65 games, there
are going to be some times like
finals and midterms when your
mind isn't on the game," he exp
lains.
"You have to learn to concen
trate on thefield and concentrate
in the classroom, keeping them
separate," he added.
Perez said Davis makes this
distinction successfully. "He
can leave the game behind him
and concentrate on something
else. He doesn't waste time, and
he's a good student."
Commenting on Davis' desire
to play pro baseball, Perez said,
"If he wasn't concerned with
getting a good education, he
could have gone to the pros
sooner.
"Steve's a hell of a guy. I hope
he gets a chance to play in the
pros, because I'm sure he can do
the job."
