Killer quake hits northern Italy
VENICE, Italy — A severe earthquake hit north
eastern Italy last night, collapsing entire sections of
towns northeast of Venice near the Yugoslav bor
der, killing at least 7'A persons and injuring 500 or
more, police said.
The spokesman for the caribinieri—the national
police—said they had reports of severe damage
from half a dozen towns in the foothills of the Alps,
with whole families buried in the collapse of their
homes.
Communications with a number of points in the
area were still out.
"It is dark, electric power is down, rescue work
ers have a hard time reaching all the many centers
in the stricken area," the officer said.
A caribinieri officer in Forgaria, a town of 4000
near the Yugoslavian border, described the situa
tion there as "catastrophic . . . whole neighbor
hoods have been flattened to the ground. Many are
dead and many are missing. We lack equipment for
rescue work. We have no power. It is not possible to
make an estimate of the number of dead, but it must
be high."
The quake was also felt in Yugoslavia, West Ger
many, Austria and Czechoslovakia.
The National Earthquake Information Center at
Golden, Col., gave a Richter reading of 6.5 for the
quake.
Labor leaders lean to Carter
WASHINGTON — With their favorites all but out
of the race, labor leaders are looking toward an
accommodation with Democratic frontrunner
Jimmy Carter rather than risk sitting out another
presidential election.
No rush of support is expected beyond that al
ready given by a few liberal unions, but most union
chiefs are becoming reconciled to a Carter victory at
the Democratic convention.
Contrary to his position in the last election,
AFL-CIO President George Meany is telling his
political lieutenants that if Carter wins the nomina
tion the giant labor federation will throw its full
support behind his presidential campaign.
But, sources said, support will be keyed to an
acceptable clarification of Carter's stand on labor
issues.
The independent United Auto Workers (IJAW),
biggest of the liberal unions, is expected to work for
Carter in the Michigan primary rather than back
Rep. Morris Udall of Arizona, the so-called prog
ressive candidate.
Labor leaders in general have been suspicious of

the former Georgia governor. But some — among
them UAW President Leonard Woodcock and Pres
ident Jerry Wurf of the municipal employes union
— have indicated they can forgive Carter for some
positions that were less than perfect from labor's
standpoint.
"We've got to get rid of Ford," said a union polit
ical strategist. "Carter is still the new guy on the
block to labor, but where else can we go?"
Six die in Mexico terrorist attack
MEXICO CITY — A band of terrorists, including
a woman in black, burst into a quiet suburban re
staurant at breakfast time yesterday and shot dead
six government agents assigned as bodyguards to a
prominent Mexican family, police reported.
As their car sped away, the terrorists killed a
uniformed customs officer with a burst of gunfire at
a street stand.
Two persons were wounded in the double attack.
Police later surrounded a campus of the National
Polytechnic Institute, on a report the killers —
numbering at least four — had fled there.
The six agents were breakfasting quietly at the
Lindavista restaurant on a treelined suburban street
when the gunmen appeared and opened fire with
out saying a word, police quoted witnesses as say
ing.
A tall, blond man who entered first killed three
agents at one table with a machine gun, then two
other men and the woman — each with a pistol —
cut down the other three at another table, witnesses
said.
The agents fell among the tables and chairs. They
never knew what was happening and had no time
to draw their own guns, said a waitress, who was
also wounded in the shooting.
The blond man smiled as he disarmed the bodies
and threw the pistols in a bag, she said.
Moments later the terrorists stopped their car at
an open-air juice stand and killed the customs
agent and wounded another.
Reagan hopes for first ballot win
WASHINGTON — Ronald Reagan said yesterday
he thinks he can win the nomination on the first
ballot at the Republican National Convention.
President Ford, meanwhile, forswore any more
predictions about how he will do in the primaries.
Campaigning in Shreveport, La., Reagan said his
delegate strength has exceeded his own projec
tions.
"I believe it is possible to go to the convention

now with enough delegates to win on the first bal
lot," the former California governor told some 250
supporters at the Shreveport airport.
Reagan, who is challenging Ford for the GOP
nomination, made his assessment as the president's
key political advisers grew increasingly pessimis
tic about Ford's chances of arriving at the Republi
can convention with enough votes for a first-ballot
victory.
Some are concerned he could lose his own state's
primary.
American/Soviet detente 'eroding'
LONDON — Detente between the Soviet Union
and the United States seems to be eroding and signs
point "to a period of pronounced American-Soviet
rivalry," an influential research group said today.
Suspicion between the two superpowers over fu
ture intentions and objectives bode ill for interna
tional stability, the International Institute for
Strategic Studies said in its annual survey of world
strategy.
However, Christoph Bertram, the institute's di
rector, told a news conference he was "not overly
impressed" by the buildup of Soviet military power
during 1975 and so far this year.
Despite Moscow's success in Angola, the survey
said, both major powers suffered setbacks in 1975.
"Both emerged from the year somewhat cut down
to size," said Bertram.
Meanwhile, China wants Western Europe and
the United States to prepare themselves for "an
imminent and inevitable war" against the Soviet
Union,the London Times reported from Peking yes
terday.
Times correspondent Peter Hazelhurst said this
was the message the Chinese gave visiting British
Foreign Secretary Anthony Crosland.
"It is understood that the main part of the discus
sions were devoted to Chinese views on the dangers
of a world war against the Soviet Union,"
Hazelhurst said.
He added, "Using the maxim: 'united we
stand, divided we fall,' Mr. Chiao is reported to
have told Mr. Crosland that 'there is no doubt about
the inevitability of war and anyone who denies this
is fooling himself. The Soviet Union's plan is to
make a feint in the East while attacking theWest.' "
Today's weather
