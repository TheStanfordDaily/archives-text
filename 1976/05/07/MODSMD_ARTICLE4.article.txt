## Pipe leak reduces service 
### Dan Fiduccia 
A leak in a fresh water pipe at Tre
sidder Memorial Union has caused a
temporary reduction in service at the
Coffee House, according to Coffee
House Manager Malcolm Young.
A small leak in the plumbing for the
washroom above the Coffee House
kitchen was discovered early yester
day afternoon. The water leaked down
into the kitchen's refrigerator so
Young had all the food within the re
frigerator removed and destroyed.
Following the disposal of the re
frigerator contents, the Coffee House
served nosandwiches or pastries,and
only one half of the normal selection of
beverages.
The Tresidder maintenance staff in
formed Young yesterday afternoon
that the leak was from a fresh water
pipe. Even though the maintenance
crew expected to have the leak fixed by
last night, Young said he had "no
idea" when the Coffee House would be
back to normal operations.
Bill Garland, Santa Clara County
Health Department sanitarian, said
Sec. 28552 of the California Restaurant
Act forbids the location of a restaurant
kitchen under plumbing on the floor
above it.
"No city would allow that (kind of)
plumbing set-up (in Tresidder)," Gar
land said.
The problem at Tresidder can be re
medied by either renovating the
plumbing, removing the kitchen or
adding protection to the plumbing,
Garland said.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Dan
Williams said that either protection
would be added or the plumbing
would be rerouted around the Coffee
House area.
Bob Caselli, manager of TDS Inc.
which operates the Coffee House, has
already invited county inspectors to
examine the plumbing, according to
Williams.
Young said he thought all of the food
™rved before the leak was discovered
been removed from the re
"ingerator before the contamination
occured.
University safety and health inspec
tors could not be reached for comment
