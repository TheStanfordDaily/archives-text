# Oldest Chinese sculptures yet
## Prof enchanted by tomb treasures 
### Carrie Breuner 
"1 would have made a rotten architect." confided
Art Prof. Michael Sullivan. Fortunately somewhere
along his path from Cambridge University in Eng
land to sunny California, Sullivan escaped the
world of drafting boards and blueprints and be
came "involved with China." He is now a Chinese
art expert of world renown.
Sullivan's affair with the East probably began in
1940, the year he took a position with the Interna
tional Red Cross in China and began teaching in a
Chinese university.
Although he left China in 1946. his 12 books on
Chinese art are a convincing testimonial to his first
love.
'First emperor'
Sullivan returned to China for the first time in
1973. At that time he explored the site of the tomb of
the "First Emperor" of China, Ch'in Shih Huang-ti,
who died in 210 H.C.
Little did he know that a year later, the same tomb
was to yield one of the most sensational archaeolo
gical discoveries of recent vears — the oldest nipr.p

of Chinese sculpture yet discovered.
Telling the story of the discovery of the ancient
sculpture, Sullivan said that members of the com
mune digging a well about a mile to the east of Shih
Huang-ti's tomb sank, not into water, but into a
huge pit, 600 feet long and 30 feet deep.
Strange depression
Investigating the strange depression, ar
chaeologists found about 6000 life-size terra cotta
figures of warriors and horses lying in rows across
the entire depression, dating from the third century
B.C.
"It is quite reasonable." said Sullivan, "to expect
that if such a pit exists to the east of the tomb, others
lie to the north, south and west of it. All together,"
he added, "there may be 24.000 clay figures."
In China, Sullivan said, it was common to bury
smaller figurines, one or two feet high. The statues
were supposed to be substitutes for living men.

did not believe the figures were much help. Sulli
van said. In fact, he said, there are records of a
protest written 2000 years ago chiding people for
neglecting their parents while they were alive but
lavishing costly funerals on them when they died.
Partly excavated
Only about one quarter of the tomb area has been
uncovered so far, Sullivan said, pointing to one of
the slides he will show at his lecture on the tomb pit
this Friday at 8 p.m. in Annenberg Auditorium.
While in Peking last October to see a special
exhibition of the great paintings of China's past,
Sullivan was among the first to see four of the
restored figures on display at the Palace Museum.
The tomb site itself was not open to visitors, but
several more of the figures are stored in the Na
tional Historical Museum, which has been closed to
the public since 1966, Sullivan said. Headded that
the museum was opened especially for him and his
wife.
"We had it to ourselves for a whole day."he said.
» "It was great."

'First emperor'
Sullivan returned to China for the first time in
1973. At that time he explored the site of the tomb of
the "First Emperor" of China, Ch'in Shih Huang-ti,
who died in 210 H.C.
Little did he know that a year later, the same tomb
was to yield one of the most sensational archaeolo
gical discoveries of recent vears — the oldest nipr.p

of Chinese sculpture yet discovered.
Telling the story of the discovery of the ancient
sculpture, Sullivan said that members of the com
mune digging a well about a mile to the east of Shih
Huang-ti's tomb sank, not into water, but into a
huge pit, 600 feet long and 30 feet deep.
Strange depression
Investigating the strange depression, ar
chaeologists found about 6000 life-size terra cotta
figures of warriors and horses lying in rows across
the entire depression, dating from the third century
B.C.
"It is quite reasonable." said Sullivan, "to expect
that if such a pit exists to the east of the tomb, others
lie to the north, south and west of it. All together,"
he added, "there may be 24.000 clay figures."
In China, Sullivan said, it was common to bury
smaller figurines, one or two feet high. The statues
were supposed to be substitutes for living men.

did not believe the figures were much help. Sulli
van said. In fact, he said, there are records of a
protest written 2000 years ago chiding people for
neglecting their parents while they were alive but
lavishing costly funerals on them when they died.
Partly excavated
Only about one quarter of the tomb area has been
uncovered so far, Sullivan said, pointing to one of
the slides he will show at his lecture on the tomb pit
this Friday at 8 p.m. in Annenberg Auditorium.
While in Peking last October to see a special
exhibition of the great paintings of China's past,
Sullivan was among the first to see four of the
restored figures on display at the Palace Museum.
The tomb site itself was not open to visitors, but
several more of the figures are stored in the Na
tional Historical Museum, which has been closed to
the public since 1966, Sullivan said. Headded that
the museum was opened especially for him and his
wife.
"We had it to ourselves for a whole day."he said.
» "It was great."

FAR FAST FASCINATION —Art Prof. Michael Sullivan, an authority on
J Chinese art. will bp giving a slide presentation today at 8 p.m. in Annen-
I berg Auditorium on an archeological discovery at the tomh pit of the first
J emperor ot China.
"1 would have made a rotten architect." confided
Art Prof. Michael Sullivan. Fortunately somewhere
along his path from Cambridge University in Eng
land to sunny California, Sullivan escaped the
world of drafting boards and blueprints and be
came "involved with China." He is now a Chinese
art expert of world renown.
Sullivan's affair with the East probably began in
1940, the year he took a position with the Interna
tional Red Cross in China and began teaching in a
Chinese university.
Although he left China in 1946. his 12 books on
Chinese art are a convincing testimonial to his first
love.
