## Opinions Hoover funds clarified 
### 
Richard Staar

Despite the extent of the Daily reporter's week
long "investigative reporting" at the Hoover In
stitution last week, he left out or mixed up several
pertinent facts in his April 29 story which would
have made it much less interesting — not to men
tion less sensational!
First, the $209,000 three-year budget cut by the
University was a reduction solely in general funds
provided by Stanford in support of the library at
the Hoover Institution. About 00 percent of the
total Hoover Institution library budget comes
from University general funds.The research and
publications program receives no University gen
eral funds; it is 100 percent supported by re
stricted Hoover Institution endowment income
and gifts received for research purposes.
Second, the reduction in endowment income
that the Hoover InstitLtion suffered as a result of
University financial policies is not included in
the $209,000 figure.
Third, and most important of all, the reporter
neglected to mention that currently almost
$400,000 of private gift funds have been raised
and will be spent this year on the library. The
amount has increased steadily in recent years as

the University has gone through its various
budgetary crises, starting in the late 19605. In
recent years 20 percent or more of the library
budget has come from private gift funds — an
amount many multiples of the percentage of pri
vate gift funds in the Main Library's budget. How
ever. there is even a limit to the amount of gift
funds that an internationally renowned center
like the Hoover Institution, despite its "greater
gift capacity." can raise for library purposes.
Finally, on the matter of the Hoover Institution
shifting its emphasis;anyone with successful ex
perience in fund raising knows that basically it is
the international reputations of the distinguished
scholars on the Hoover Institution staff and their
outstanding publications that interest donors in
contributing to the library, and not the other way
around. Our library is outstanding and world
famous, and my colleagues and I are extremely
proud of it and intend to keep it that way. But its
role in the overall program of the Hoover Institu
tion, important though it is, still needs to be kept
in perspective.
