# Letters: Carter, IQ

### 
The year's enigma
Once again spring luis arrived,
and with it comes longer days
warmer weather and the last
round of presidential primaries.
With the year's primaries comes
this year's political enigma,
Jimmy darter, the man every
body loves to dump on.
As each of the primaries has
come and gone, and anot her dar
ter win has been recorded, stu
dents here rack their minds to
come up with some way to exp
lain darter's success. The most
common explanation is that the
poor dumb voters back in
wherever simply got sucked in
by the smiling peanut farmer
from Georgia.
The possibility that there is
something belli nd that smileand
behind all the media rhetoric is
rarely, if ever, considered by
students here as an alternative
explanation. Yet behind that
smile and behind the image is a
man who 1 feel has the compas
sion and understanding to be
come a good leader for this na
tion.
The problem up to this point
has been that these qualities are
all but impossible to perceive in
tin; five or so minutes per night
that the national news devotes to

the presidential campaign. Such
limited coverage, plus the fact
that California's primary is one
of the last to be decided, com
bine to create a situation in
which all that most people know
about Carter and the other can
didates is what has trickled
down through local newspapers
and television.
This puts the interested voter
in the position of having to rely
almost totally on the media for
information on which to base an
opinion of the candidates. And
just as I would never ask a person
to support a candidate solely on
the basis of his media image, I
would likewise ask that person
not to form a negative opinion
based on the same limited in
formation.
I would urge voters not to pre
judge any candidate, be it Carter
or anyone else. See the candi
dates, listen to them speak, read
their stands on the issues,
which, believe it or not, do exist
for the person who will spend a
little time in searching for them.
If this is done it is my feeling
that more people will come to a
conclusion similar to the one I
have reached, which is that Car
ter's decency, concern and stand
on the issues combine to make
him, of all the current candi
dates. the most qualified to be

president.

William Shockley's quote
about IQ tests in the Daily May 4
is interesting, and it points out a
crucial difference between the
use of the IQ test as a "scientific
instrument" and the use of other
testing devices, such as the
thermometer. Shockley says:
"1 compare imperfect tools
like polygraphs and IQ tests to
the clinical thermometer, which
is a valuable instrument, even
though it can't distinguish bet
ween malaria and staying too
long in a sauna."
Indeed, but whereas the ther
mometer is never used in and of
itself to determine the difference
between malaria and a long stay
in the sauna, IQ tests are usually
the only instruments used to de
termine whether a young child is
"intelligent" or not. And a
specious instrument it is.

William Shockley's quote
about IQ tests in the Daily May 4
is interesting, and it points out a
crucial difference between the
use of the IQ test as a "scientific
instrument" and the use of other
testing devices, such as the
thermometer. Shockley says:
"1 compare imperfect tools
like polygraphs and IQ tests to
the clinical thermometer, which
is a valuable instrument, even
though it can't distinguish bet
ween malaria and staying too
long in a sauna."
Indeed, but whereas the ther
mometer is never used in and of
itself to determine the difference
between malaria and a long stay
in the sauna, IQ tests are usually
the only instruments used to de
termine whether a young child is
"intelligent" or not. And a
specious instrument it is.

The year's enigma
Once again spring luis arrived,
and with it comes longer days
warmer weather and the last
round of presidential primaries.
With the year's primaries comes
this year's political enigma,
Jimmy darter, the man every
body loves to dump on.
As each of the primaries has
come and gone, and anot her dar
ter win has been recorded, stu
dents here rack their minds to
come up with some way to exp
lain darter's success. The most
common explanation is that the
poor dumb voters back in
wherever simply got sucked in
by the smiling peanut farmer
from Georgia.
The possibility that there is
something belli nd that smileand
behind all the media rhetoric is
rarely, if ever, considered by
students here as an alternative
explanation. Yet behind that
smile and behind the image is a
man who 1 feel has the compas
sion and understanding to be
come a good leader for this na
tion.
The problem up to this point
has been that these qualities are
all but impossible to perceive in
tin; five or so minutes per night
that the national news devotes to

the presidential campaign. Such
limited coverage, plus the fact
that California's primary is one
of the last to be decided, com
bine to create a situation in
which all that most people know
about Carter and the other can
didates is what has trickled
down through local newspapers
and television.
This puts the interested voter
in the position of having to rely
almost totally on the media for
information on which to base an
opinion of the candidates. And
just as I would never ask a person
to support a candidate solely on
the basis of his media image, I
would likewise ask that person
not to form a negative opinion
based on the same limited in
formation.
I would urge voters not to pre
judge any candidate, be it Carter
or anyone else. See the candi
dates, listen to them speak, read
their stands on the issues,
which, believe it or not, do exist
for the person who will spend a
little time in searching for them.
If this is done it is my feeling
that more people will come to a
conclusion similar to the one I
have reached, which is that Car
ter's decency, concern and stand
on the issues combine to make
him, of all the current candi
dates. the most qualified to be

president.
