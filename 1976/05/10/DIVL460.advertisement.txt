20 MILLION REGISTERED UNEMPLOYED I
BY NOVEMBER 19761
In France, currently the colleges are in turmoil. Insufficient jobs and positions
are the cause. Many collegians believe that all Frenchmen are equal ("LIBERTY,
EQUALITY, FRATERNITY")?
What about the collegians "in the land of the free and the home of the brave"?
Are the eight million of them content with handouts from the Noble Buck passers?
They do not have to be. Can't they organize and register at the unemployment
office? Is this not the democratic way?
"Government is for the betterment of every man, every woman and every child
in the Nation".
