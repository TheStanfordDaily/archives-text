# Symposium stresses passage of Prop. 15

### Leonard Gumlia 
Stressing the lack of safety in most
phases of the nuclear energy program,
alumnus Gregory Minor and Palo Alto
attorney Craig Ritchey made a plea for
the passage of controversial Proposi
tion 15 at a symposium sponsored by
the Stanford Chapter of Project Survi
val and the Stanford Environmental
Law Society Thursday night at Tresid
der Union.
Minor is one of three General Elec
tric engineers who qoit their jobs last
February because of the danger they
saw in the present program.
"In 20 years the nuclear industry has
gone too far, too fast," he said. "The
new plants of today are predicated on
the old, which themselves haven't
been fully tested."
Minor used the example of the
near-disaster at Brown's Ferry,
Alabama, to point out the short
comings of present safety measures. "I
designed the control room there," he
said, "and it was supposed to be the
safest, the best of all the plants. But we
still came much too close to a nuclear
disaster."
According to Minor, the Emergency
Core Cooling System, the positioning
of key cables and evacuation proce
dures were all found to be inadequate.

"But we haven't seemed to learn any
lessons," he said. "The changes made
treated only the symptoms, not the
causes. It could happen again."
The worst kind of nuclear accident
is called a core melt-down. The
Emergency Core Cooling System is de
signed to prevent such an accident,
which could result in over $15 billion
of property damage.
These systems have not been fully
tested, however, and Minor noted that
it is "absolutely vital that these devices
be tested and that they work. Proposi
tion 15 will ensure this."
Ritchey discussed the history of
public awareness of nuclear energy
and more specifically, Proposition 15.
"This is a safety measure," he stres
sed. "There is a difference of opinion
that has to be decided before we can go
on with nuclear plants."
Ritchey denied the claims of "15
oppositionists" that passage would
mean a shutdown of nuclear plants
and economic chaos. "The nuclear in
dustry was defeated in safety debates
in the legislature and now they are just
trying to appeal to voter motivation.
The demand for electricity, not the
means of technology, will determine
the economy."
Both Ritchey and Minor felt that the
industry would be able to make any
necessary changes within the five year
period the proposition would allow.

attorney Craig Ritchey made a plea for
the passage of controversial Proposi
tion 15 at a symposium sponsored by
the Stanford Chapter of Project Survi
val and the Stanford Environmental
Law Society Thursday night at Tresid
der Union.
Minor is one of three General Elec
tric engineers who qoit their jobs last
February because of the danger they
saw in the present program.
"In 20 years the nuclear industry has
gone too far, too fast," he said. "The
new plants of today are predicated on
the old, which themselves haven't
been fully tested."
Minor used the example of the
near-disaster at Brown's Ferry,
Alabama, to point out the short
comings of present safety measures. "I
designed the control room there," he
said, "and it was supposed to be the
safest, the best of all the plants. But we
still came much too close to a nuclear
disaster."
According to Minor, the Emergency
Core Cooling System, the positioning
of key cables and evacuation proce
dures were all found to be inadequate.

"But we haven't seemed to learn any
lessons," he said. "The changes made
treated only the symptoms, not the
causes. It could happen again."
The worst kind of nuclear accident
is called a core melt-down. The
Emergency Core Cooling System is de
signed to prevent such an accident,
which could result in over $15 billion
of property damage.
These systems have not been fully
tested, however, and Minor noted that
it is "absolutely vital that these devices
be tested and that they work. Proposi
tion 15 will ensure this."
Ritchey discussed the history of
public awareness of nuclear energy
and more specifically, Proposition 15.
"This is a safety measure," he stres
sed. "There is a difference of opinion
that has to be decided before we can go
on with nuclear plants."
Ritchey denied the claims of "15
oppositionists" that passage would
mean a shutdown of nuclear plants
and economic chaos. "The nuclear in
dustry was defeated in safety debates
in the legislature and now they are just
trying to appeal to voter motivation.
The demand for electricity, not the
means of technology, will determine
the economy."
Both Ritchey and Minor felt that the
industry would be able to make any
necessary changes within the five year
period the proposition would allow.
