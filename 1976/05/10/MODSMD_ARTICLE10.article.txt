"We should get out of Panama; only
a demagogue would claim that it is
still a part of our country," asserted
Assoc. History Prof. John Wirth.
"The solution to this problem is so
obvious that anyone of good will can
conclude that this is one of the few
issues that is truly black or white,"
Wirth, director of Latin American
Studies, added.
Professors here seem to be in agree
ment that the United States should re

negotiate its treaty with Panama over
the concerns of possession of the ter
ritorial zone and canal.
"1 certainly feel that we should re
negotiate our treaty with the Panama
nians," said Political Science Prof.
Richard Fagen, "eventually the United
States will have to get out of Panama."
State Department
"1 think that the State Department
position — and this has been the pol
icy since 1964 established by Presi
dent Johnson — is that our basic treaty
with Panama should be renegotiated,"
said Michael Cotter, a Foreign Service
officer, currently studying with the
Latin America Program here.
"The exact settlement of terms is
still part of the negotiations — and it
seems that with the renegotiations
there will be a greater role for Panama
in the operation of both the zone and
the canal," Cotter stated.
The Panama Zone (and Canal) is
now a constitutionally acquired ter
ritorial possession granted to the Un
ited States by the Republic of Panama.
The U.S. maintains the canal zone as a
government reservation in exchange
for the operation, maintenance and
protection of the Canal.
The terms of this agreement were
established by the Panama Canal Act
of Dec. 5, 1912, signed bv William
Taft.
