## New quakes rock Italy; number of dead rises 
### 
UDINE, Italy (AP) — Two
more powerful earthquakes
shook northeastern Italy and
western Yugoslavia yesterday,
leveling houses and a 16th cen
tury cathedral. No new casual
ties were reported, but the offi
cial death toll from last Thurs
day's devastating quake reached
812.
Police officials said they ex
pect to find at least 400 more
bodies buried under the debris,
with the final death toll exceed
ing 1000.
The latest tremors, one
measuring a strong 5.7 on the
Richter Scale, hit as soldiers and
other rescue workers continued
to dig through the rubble in
search of survivors and others
killed by the first quake. A total
of 44 quakes and tremors have
ripped through the area since

Thursday.
Rain hampered search and re
scue operations yesterday and
authorities appealed for tents to
shelter tens of thousands of
homeless still lacking temporary
accommodations.
Shortage of tents
A shortage of tents is the major
problem for the relief operation,
Health Minister Luciano del
Falco said. He reported an in
noculation campaign against
typhoid fever was progressing
satisfactorily and supplies of
serum were arriving regularly in
the quake-striken area.
Del Falco said all persons in
the disaster zone were being
vaccinated against typhoid
fever. Health conditions re
mained serious as tens of
thousands spent their third
night away from home in tent

cities. Some of the homeless
were accommodated in sleeping
cars from trains.
In Washington, the U.S.
Agency for International De
velopment announced it has
made $353,000 in aid available
for Italian earthquake victims.
International aid for the sur
vivors kept pouring in, includ
ing some from the U.S. military,
which dispatched from the air
base in Aviano a convoy carry
ing a bulldozer, a grader, 18
trucks, a communications trailer
and support equipment includ
ing tents and blankets.
Kinging bells
Yesterday morning the ring
ing of bells from undamaged
churches provided sharp con
trast to the wailing of police and
ambulance sirens that continu
ally went back and forth between
Udine and stricken villages in
the Dolomites foothills.
The homeless face the pros
pect of moving from their vil
lages to live with relatives in
nearby towns.
In Osoppo on a wall that used
to be the front of the city hall,
there are lists of the dead and
injured. Most of the names on
the list are residents under 20
and over 60 because most of the
work-age population has gone
abroad to work over the past 30
years.
Rescue workers included sur
vivors of an earthquake that kil
led 315 and injured thousands in
the Belice Valley in western Sic
ily in 1968.
They also provided a living
testimony that promises of re
building homes can be a long
process in Italy. Eight years after
the Belice disaster, survivors are
still sheltered in "temporary"
shacks with government funds
earmarked for housing repor
tedly gobblsd up in other pro
jects.

the disaster zone were being
vaccinated against typhoid
fever. Health conditions re
mained serious as tens of
thousands spent their third
night away from home in tent

cities. Some of the homeless
were accommodated in sleeping
cars from trains.
In Washington, the U.S.
Agency for International De
velopment announced it has
made $353,000 in aid available
for Italian earthquake victims.
International aid for the sur
vivors kept pouring in, includ
ing some from the U.S. military,
which dispatched from the air
base in Aviano a convoy carry
ing a bulldozer, a grader, 18
trucks, a communications trailer
and support equipment includ
ing tents and blankets.
Kinging bells
Yesterday morning the ring
ing of bells from undamaged
churches provided sharp con
trast to the wailing of police and
ambulance sirens that continu
ally went back and forth between
Udine and stricken villages in
the Dolomites foothills.
The homeless face the pros
pect of moving from their vil
lages to live with relatives in
nearby towns.
In Osoppo on a wall that used
to be the front of the city hall,
there are lists of the dead and
injured. Most of the names on
the list are residents under 20
and over 60 because most of the
work-age population has gone
abroad to work over the past 30
years.
Rescue workers included sur
vivors of an earthquake that kil
led 315 and injured thousands in
the Belice Valley in western Sic
ily in 1968.
They also provided a living
testimony that promises of re
building homes can be a long
process in Italy. Eight years after
the Belice disaster, survivors are
still sheltered in "temporary"
shacks with government funds
earmarked for housing repor
tedly gobblsd up in other pro
jects.

SEND A CABLE — San Francisco cable cars are running again after labor and city officials reached a
compromise agreement to end the strike last Saturday. Over 1000 buses, trollies, street and cable
cars were idle during the 38-day strike.
UDINE, Italy (AP) — Two
more powerful earthquakes
shook northeastern Italy and
western Yugoslavia yesterday,
leveling houses and a 16th cen
tury cathedral. No new casual
ties were reported, but the offi
cial death toll from last Thurs
day's devastating quake reached
812.
Police officials said they ex
pect to find at least 400 more
bodies buried under the debris,
with the final death toll exceed
ing 1000.
The latest tremors, one
measuring a strong 5.7 on the
Richter Scale, hit as soldiers and
other rescue workers continued
to dig through the rubble in
search of survivors and others
killed by the first quake. A total
of 44 quakes and tremors have
ripped through the area since

Thursday.
Rain hampered search and re
scue operations yesterday and
authorities appealed for tents to
shelter tens of thousands of
homeless still lacking temporary
accommodations.
Shortage of tents
A shortage of tents is the major
problem for the relief operation,
Health Minister Luciano del
Falco said. He reported an in
noculation campaign against
typhoid fever was progressing
satisfactorily and supplies of
serum were arriving regularly in
the quake-striken area.
Del Falco said all persons in
the disaster zone were being
vaccinated against typhoid
fever. Health conditions re
mained serious as tens of

night away from home in tent
