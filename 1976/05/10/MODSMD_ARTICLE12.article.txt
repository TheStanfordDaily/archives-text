ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New
York's Republican organization
still loyal to Vice President Nel
son Rockefeller, is emerging as a
potentially key power bloc in the
struggle for theCOP presidential
nomination.
As President Ford struggles to
fend off Ronald Reagan's chal
lenge, state Republican leaders
say privately they may try to use
their power to advance the lin
gering ambitions of former New
York Gov. Rockefeller.
Rockefeller withdrew six
months ago from consideration
as Ford's vice presidential run
ning mate in 1976. Uut the New
York GOP has begun a public
flirtation with Reagan. GOP state
workers said they hope to
negotiate a spot on the Ford or
Reagan ticket or in the cabinet
for Rockefeller — or perhaps
even presidential nomination it
self, if the Republican conven
tion is deadlocked.
Endorsement reversed
New York Republican leaders
have nourished such ambition
for some ti me. In December, after
Rockefeller removed himself
from the ticket, the state Repub
lican Committee abruptly re
versed its previous endorsement
of Ford for president and resol
ved to send a "united and un
committed" delegation to the
Republican National Conven
tion in July to retain the state's
bargaining power.
While the committed delegate
count has dominated the head
lines, more than 300 uncommit

ted delegates have been selected.
And that includes 151 New Yor
kers, most of them picked byand
loyal to the state GOP organiza
tion headed by Chairman
Richard Rosenbaum, a Rockefel
ler ally. Only three of New
York's delegates are committed
to a candidate, each to Reagan.
Potential 'power broker'
National Democratic Chair
man Robert Strauss said last
week that Rockefeller is emerg
ing as a potential power broker at
the Republican convention. The
Los Angeles Times surveyed de
legate counts and predicted that
if Reagan wins the California
primary next month, the conven
tion probably would be dead
locked and Rockefeller might
hold the balance of power.
