# Study says program not effective
## Lawyer assails Nixon's LEAA 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — An
independent study of the gov
ernment's mul ti-bil lion-dollar
crime-fighting program con
cludes it has accomplished little
and should be abolished.
The focus of the study was the
Law Enforcement Assistance
Administration (LEAA) which
has disbursed $4.4 billion in
grants to communities to help
fight crime.
"It is the conclusion of this re
port that the LEAA program
should be abolished," the study
said.
Entitled "Law and Disorder
IV," the report was the fourth in
a series of studies of LEAA.
$160 million
The study examined the
LEAA's high impact program
under which $160 million was
channeled to eight cities in an
effort to reduce stranger-to
stranger crime.
The report, released March 2,
said that violent crime has con
siderably worsened in the eight
cities. It added that the increase
might have been much greater if
the program had not been in op
eration.
The latest study said: "LEAA's
performance in the High Impact
program was an irresponsible,
ill-conceived and politically
motivated effort to throw money
at a social program.' "
"Many of the cities had no
idea how to effectively spend
such a high level of funding in
such a short period of time and
complained bitterly about
LEAA's lack of assistance," it
added.
