# Wants defense pact
## Premier warns U.S. 
### 
ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Fu
ture defense pacts between the
United States and Turkey will be
virtually ruled out if the U.S.
Congress rejects a $1 billion de
fense agreement between the
two NATO allies. Premier
Suleyman Demirel said yester
day.
The 52-year-old premier also
disclosed in an interview that
the Soviet Union has pledged $1
billion in easy-term credits to
fund Turkish development and
industrial projects.
Turkey, which lies on Russia's
southern border, has been a key
element in the American policy
of containment of the Soviet
Union since Cold War days.
Standing army
The Turks have a standing
army of half a million, largest
among European NATO mem
bers, and 26 U.S. military elec
tronic surveillance stations
which monitor Soviet activities.
After Congress imposed an
arms embargo 14 months ago,
because American weapons
were used in the 1974 Turkish
invasion of Cyprus, Demirel
turned toward the Soviet bloc for
trade and economic cooperation.

He stopped short of accepting
Soviet weapons offers.
In March, Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger announced the
United States had agreed to sup
ply Turkey with $1 billion in
military aid over four years in
return for reopening of thebases.
A similar agreement for $700
million is pending with Greece.
However, congressional ap
proval for both appears unlikely.
It is not yet known when Con
gress will vote.
Cyprus conflict
American critics in Congress
say Turkey should not receive
aid as long as there is no settle
ment of the Greek-Turk conflict
on Cyprus.
"If the agreement is rejected,"
Demirel said, "it should be better
not to have it... It would be very
difficult to have another agree
ment along these lines or along
other lines. What is the use of
having agreements with the U.S.
government because we don't
know whether they will be re
jected or accepted by Congress."
Demirel also disclosed that the
foreign ministers of Greece and
Turkey would meet privately
during a NATO ministerial con

ference in Oslo on May 19.
Meanwhile, student distur
bances have caused considera
ble disruption in the country.
Since the beginning of the
school year student violence has
resulted in at least 30 deaths
with hundreds of others injured.
Asked what could be done
about student unrest, the pre
mier said, "These are not student
actions. Universities are being
used as platforms ... It started
several years ago. The same
people are involved as in the dis
turbances of 1969-72."

masks and they had a 12-gauge
pump riot gun and a 15-inch
sawed-off shotgun.
"I walked in on five city
police, three federates and two
secret police," he said.
'Hands up'
Eielden said he had been
studying in a dictionary how to
say "bands up" in Spanish, but
when he tried to say it#did not
come out right. However, the
guns spoke for him and the
policemen put their hands up
and eventually supplied keys for
the cells.
He said he released "his man"
and then the others in the jail
and a prisoner went to get two
girls in another cell.
The escapees made their way
across the border to the West
Texas town of Eagle Pass where
some turned themselves over to
U.S. authorities or scattered ac
ross the country. The younger
Davis came to Dallas.

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Fu
ture defense pacts between the
United States and Turkey will be
virtually ruled out if the U.S.
Congress rejects a $1 billion de
fense agreement between the
two NATO allies. Premier
Suleyman Demirel said yester
day.
The 52-year-old premier also
disclosed in an interview that
the Soviet Union has pledged $1
billion in easy-term credits to
fund Turkish development and
industrial projects.
Turkey, which lies on Russia's
southern border, has been a key
element in the American policy
of containment of the Soviet
Union since Cold War days.
Standing army
The Turks have a standing
army of half a million, largest
among European NATO mem
bers, and 26 U.S. military elec
tronic surveillance stations
which monitor Soviet activities.
After Congress imposed an
arms embargo 14 months ago,
because American weapons
were used in the 1974 Turkish
invasion of Cyprus, Demirel
turned toward the Soviet bloc for
trade and economic cooperation.

He stopped short of accepting
Soviet weapons offers.
In March, Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger announced the
United States had agreed to sup
ply Turkey with $1 billion in
military aid over four years in
return for reopening of thebases.
A similar agreement for $700
million is pending with Greece.
However, congressional ap
proval for both appears unlikely.
It is not yet known when Con
gress will vote.
Cyprus conflict
American critics in Congress
say Turkey should not receive
aid as long as there is no settle
ment of the Greek-Turk conflict
on Cyprus.
"If the agreement is rejected,"
Demirel said, "it should be better
not to have it... It would be very
difficult to have another agree
ment along these lines or along
other lines. What is the use of
having agreements with the U.S.
government because we don't
know whether they will be re
jected or accepted by Congress."
Demirel also disclosed that the
foreign ministers of Greece and
Turkey would meet privately
during a NATO ministerial con

ference in Oslo on May 19.
Meanwhile, student distur
bances have caused considera
ble disruption in the country.
Since the beginning of the
school year student violence has
resulted in at least 30 deaths
with hundreds of others injured.
Asked what could be done
about student unrest, the pre
mier said, "These are not student
actions. Universities are being
used as platforms ... It started
several years ago. The same
people are involved as in the dis
turbances of 1969-72."

pump riot gun and a 15-inch

"I walked in on five city
police, three federates and two
secret police," he said.
'Hands up'
Eielden said he had been
studying in a dictionary how to
say "bands up" in Spanish, but
when he tried to say it#did not
come out right. However, the
guns spoke for him and the
policemen put their hands up
and eventually supplied keys for
the cells.
