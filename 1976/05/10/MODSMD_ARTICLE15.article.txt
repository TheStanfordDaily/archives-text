## 
### 
DALLAS (AP) — A former
Marine sergeant who led a dar
ing jail break that freed 14 U.S.
citizens from a Mexican jail did
it "for money and the adventure
involved," his attorney says.
Lawyer F.rnest Kuehne said
his client, Don Fielden of
Gladewater, Tex., now an un
employed truck driver, led the
raid on the Piedras Negras jail in
the predawn hours of March 12.
Hut the man Fielden said hired
him to free his son from the jail,
Dallas psychologist Sterling B.
Davis, denied yesterday that he
funded the jailbreak.
No pay
Asked if he had paid Fielden
to carry out the jailbreak. Davis
replied tersely, "No." but he
acknowledged his son — 29-
year-old Sterling "Cooter" Davis
Jr. — had been in the Piedras
Negras jail.
The Dallas Times Herald,
which carried the story in yes
terday's editions, said its repor
ters had a tape recording of an
interview in which the
psychologist said he had ar

ranged to free his son. A
spokesman said the newspaper
was sticking by its story.
The Times-Herald quoted
Davis as saying, "I had
exhausted all other options of
the Mexican extortion system.
Why did I do it that way? What
else was 1 supposed to do? They
had beaten and damn near killed
my son in those jails."
Drug offenders
According to the newspaper
account, Fielden — accom
panied by a 15-year-old youth
and another man — broke into
the jail, held 10 policemen at bay
with a sawed-off shotgun and
then released the U.S. prisoners,
all charged with drug offenses.
Fielden gave this account to
the Tiroes-Herald;
He and his partners moved
into Piedras Negras in the pre
dawn hours of March 12 and the
whole operation took less than
10 minutes.
Fielden said he left the youth
in the car with a CB radio while
he and the other man walked in.
