STUTTGART, West Germany
(AP) â€” The body of Ulrike
Meinhof, a heroine to European
radicals, was found hanging yes
terday from window bars of her
maximum security cell in
fortress-like Stammheim Prison,
authorities announced.
The 41-year-old former jour
nalist has been on trial for nearly
a year with three other members
of the Baader-Meinhof anarchist
gang. They were charged with a
series of terrorist attacks includ
ing those that kil led four Ameri
can servicemen and a German
policeman four years ago.
A spokesman for the Stuttgart
prosecutor's office reported that
Meinhof was last seen alive
Saturday night by a prison guard
who said she was typing in her

cell until 10:30 p.m.
When another guard opened
the cell yesterday morning, the
spokesman said, he found the
prisoner's body hanging at the
window from a piece of prison
toweling. The spokesman said a
doctor confirmed the death.
Papers found in the cell gave
no indication of any intent to
commit suicide, the spokesman
said, and further details would
he released after an inquiry.
West German authorities, fear
ing retaliation by anarchist sym
pathizers, put security forces on
alert.
In Paris, bombs caused heavy
damage and fires but no casual
ties at the offices of two West
German industrial firms.
Paris Police Commissioner
Pierre Soinveilie said, "The two
explosions certainly were linked
and one could relate them" to
Meinhof's death.
The bombs went off at the of
fices of Kloeckner Ina-France
and Thyssen-France. Both firms
specialize in steel products.
Successful journalist
Until 1968, Meinhof was a
successful journalist who wrote
her own column in a Hamburg
based, satirical-leftist magazine
owned by her then-husband
Klaus Rainer Roehl, father of her
two children. But she parted

with her family that year and
quit her job.
She surfaced in West Berlin
where authorities said she
helped free Andreas Baader,
who was serving a sentence for
an arson attack on a Frankfurt
department store. A guard was
shot and seriously wounded
when Baader was liberated from
the prison library on May 14,
1970.
Meinhof and Baader disap
peared into the underground
from where they organized the
Red Army Faction (RAF), which
police say was responsible for
acts that terrorized most of West
Germany in the next few years. It
became commonly known as the
Baader-Meinhof gang.
Prison sentence
Following the re-arrest of
Baader, the arrests of Jan-Carl
Raspe and Baader's girlfriend,
Gudrun Ensslinn, Meinhoff was
apprehended in Hannover-
La ngenhagen on June 7, 1972. A
West Berlin court sentenced her
to eight years in prison for the
prison attack that freed Baader.
After her 1974 Berlin trial, at
which she said an "armed bat
tle" to achieve a change in soci
ety was legal, Meinhof and the
other three RAF members were
brought to Stammheim.
