NEW YORK (AP) — California
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. accused
Jimmy Carter on Sunday of "not
leveling with the American
people" in the race for the
Democratic presidential nomi
nation.
"Where's the real Jimmy Car
ter? What's behind the smile?"
he asked on the CBS program
Face the Nation.
Carter, former governor of
Georgia, is the acknowledged
frontrunner for the Democratic
nomination. Brown got onto the
Carter question when newsmen
asked him why he appeared sen
sitive to charges by the Georgian
that Brown had the support of
old-time machine politicians in
the May 18 Maryland primary.
Such charges, he said, "give
me pause about Jimmy Carter,
when he makes these charges
about entrenched politicians.
Didn't get endorsements
"At the same time he (Carter)
says he's not seeking endorse
ments, he's on the telephone ask
ing for those endorsements. He
didn't get them," said Brown.
Brown predicted tough times
ahead for the American people
and said "I don't think Carter is
leveling with the American
people about the difficulties . ..
it's not going to be easy ... I'm
not trying to sugarcoat these
things.
"With Carter, the sense 1 get is
it's all smiles, be nice and easy
. . . but it's going to be tough."
said Brown.
The Californian stressed re
peatedly that he considered jobs
and provision of good medical
care the primary tasks of the na
tional government.
No contradiction
He denied that this con
tradicted his call for government
frugality and dispersal of some
functions to the states.
Brown maintained that the
fight for the Democratic nomina
tion is "wide-open" and men
tioned New Jersey. Rhode Island
and California as other states
where he would campaign.
"As we spread across the
country, you're going to see

some real surprises," he said.
Brown, the last entry into the
primary races, said he decided to
seek the presidency "because i
think this country needs to re
gain the initiatives it has lost. . .
the people of this country are
ready for a new generation of
leadership and I'd like to pro
vide it."
"I'm coming in with an open
mind and lots of energy," he
said.
