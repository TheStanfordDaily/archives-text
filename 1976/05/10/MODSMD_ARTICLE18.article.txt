# Two strike settlements achieved
## Disputes in S.F., N.J. ended

(AP) â€” Cable cars are rolling
again in San Francisco and beer
is brewing once more at a Bud
weiser plant in New Jersey.
In San Francisco, an im
promptu champagne party
celebrating the end of the 38-day
strike was held aboard the first
cable car to restore service on
Nob Hill.
About 1800 city building trade
workers struck on March 31 over
a proposed $5.7-million pay cut.
The 1900 municipal railway
workers honored the picket
lines, idling the system's more
than 1000 buses, trollies, street
cars and cable cars.
The strike ended early Satur
day when labor and city officials
reached a compromise agree
ment to turn the issue of pay cuts
over to an 11-member committee
to recommend a solution. The
recommendations, however, are
not binding.
About 2000 acres of San Fran
cisco grass needs mowing, 8000
to 10,000 trees need waterering,
and 150 to 200 leaks in the city's
water system need repair, city of
ficials said.
Three-year contract
The Anheiser Busch strike in
Newark, N.J., ended Saturday
when members of Teamsters
Local 102 accepted a three-year
contract. Details of the pact were
not disclosed. About 150
machinists, clerical workers and
nurses struck the Newark brew
ery March 1, and their picket
lines were honored by about
1000 other employes.
About 7000 Budweiser
employes in eight other cities
remain on strike.
A tentative agreement was
reached early Saturday in the
five-week strike of 1700 techni
cians and newswriters at the Na
tional Broadcasting Co., where
salaries now average about $374
a week.
Undisclosed terms
Terms of the proposed con
tract were not disclosed pending
a ratification vote by the striking
members of the National Associ
ation of Broadcast Employes and
Technicians in New York,
Washington, Cleveland,
Chicago, Los Angeles and San
Francisco.
Voting was expected to be
completed by Wednesday and, if
approved, the strikers will re
turn to work by next Saturday,
the network said. The walkout
resulted from economic provi
sions and working conditions.
