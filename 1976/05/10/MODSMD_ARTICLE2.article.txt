# Joint effort to rid area of mosquitoes
## Weeds causing control problem 
### John Larmer 
Have you ever been bothered by a
mosquito in the Palo Alto area? If you
have, you can rest assured that the
problem is being taken care of through
the joint efforts of the University and
the San Mateo County Mosquito
Abatement District — with the envi
ronment in mind, too.
According to CharlesHanson, assis
tant manager entomologist at the
Abatement District, Searsville Lake,
which lies northwest of the campus in
Jasper Ridge biological preserve, is
overgrown with a weed called "par
rot's feather."
Mosquitoes are able to breed in the
plants unmolested by fish which nor
mally control the mosquito popula
tion. The fish cannot get through the
dense vegetation to eat the larvae.
The Abatement District originally
planned to use herbicides to eliminate
the weeds. However, Alan
Grundmann, manager of the
Stanford-owned Jasper Ridge biologi
cal preserve expressed opposition to
the use of herbicides, favoring instead
a more expensive mechanical harvest
ing device to remove the weeds.
'Time bomb'
Grundmann said he found the idea
of using herbicides "appalling." The
herbicide diquat does not degrade, ac
cording to Grundmann. It bonds with
the mud on the lake bottom and can be
released from the mud many years in
the future resulting in a "time bomb"
effect on the lake.
The Abatement District agreed to
use a mechanical harvester but said
that it could not afford to buy one. The
harvester represents an initial invest
ment of $10,000 compared to an an
nual cost of only a few hundred dollars
for herbicides.
lasper Ridge is currently using its
own funds to lease a machine from the
Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in
Arizona. This machine has already
cleared eight tenths of the overgrowth
-it a cost of $5000.
"It's a hell of a lot of work." said
Grundmann, "but we believe that what
we are doing is right." The machine
cuts the plants off below the water
level and pushes them to shore where
the weeds are collected, allowed to dry
and scattered as mulch in nearby areas.
The University may design a
machine of its own for future use, ac
cording to Grundmann.
Other herbicides
He will also be evaluating other
biodegradable herbicides to use in kil
ling regrowth of parrot's feather.
Grundmann spoke about the ecol
ogy of the Searsville Lake area, noting
that parrot's feather is a Brazilian plant
that got into the lake "probably be
cause of an aquarium being dumped"
into the water a few years ago. Because
the plant, is non-native to the lake, "in
an abstract way we'd like to see it go
away," said Grundmann.

biodegradable herbicides to use in kil
ling regrowth of parrot's feather.
Grundmann spoke about the ecol
ogy of the Searsville Lake area, noting
that parrot's feather is a Brazilian plant
that got into the lake "probably be
cause of an aquarium being dumped"
into the water a few years ago. Because
the plant, is non-native to the lake, "in
an abstract way we'd like to see it go
away," said Grundmann.
Have you ever been bothered by a
mosquito in the Palo Alto area? If you
have, you can rest assured that the
problem is being taken care of through
the joint efforts of the University and
the San Mateo County Mosquito
Abatement District — with the envi
ronment in mind, too.
According to CharlesHanson, assis
tant manager entomologist at the
Abatement District, Searsville Lake,
which lies northwest of the campus in
Jasper Ridge biological preserve, is
overgrown with a weed called "par
rot's feather."
Mosquitoes are able to breed in the
plants unmolested by fish which nor
mally control the mosquito popula
tion. The fish cannot get through the
dense vegetation to eat the larvae.
The Abatement District originally
planned to use herbicides to eliminate
the weeds. However, Alan
Grundmann, manager of the
Stanford-owned Jasper Ridge biologi
cal preserve expressed opposition to
the use of herbicides, favoring instead
a more expensive mechanical harvest
ing device to remove the weeds.
'Time bomb'
Grundmann said he found the idea
of using herbicides "appalling." The
herbicide diquat does not degrade, ac
cording to Grundmann. It bonds with
the mud on the lake bottom and can be
released from the mud many years in
the future resulting in a "time bomb"
effect on the lake.
The Abatement District agreed to
use a mechanical harvester but said
that it could not afford to buy one. The
harvester represents an initial invest
ment of $10,000 compared to an an
nual cost of only a few hundred dollars
for herbicides.
lasper Ridge is currently using its
own funds to lease a machine from the
Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in
Arizona. This machine has already
cleared eight tenths of the overgrowth
-it a cost of $5000.
"It's a hell of a lot of work." said
Grundmann, "but we believe that what
we are doing is right." The machine
cuts the plants off below the water
level and pushes them to shore where
the weeds are collected, allowed to dry
and scattered as mulch in nearby areas.
The University may design a
machine of its own for future use, ac
cording to Grundmann.
