# Swedish taxes too high
## 
### 
Ingmar Bergman's recent de
cision to leave Sweden because
of tax difficulties points up an
important flaw in the Swedish
Utopia. To support the Welfare
State, Sweden's government is
becoming increasingly power
ful, arbitrary and repressive in
its tax policies.
Bergman's case demonstrates
the point. After being accused of
tax fraud and asked to pay
$120,000 in back income taxes,
Bergman pointed out that the
$500,000 he was asked to pay in
come taxes on was a capital gain,
not personal income, and,
hence, subject to the lower tax he
did pay.
Even after the government
dropped the charges, tax inves
tigators continued to hound
Bergman for other taxes he al
legedly owes. Bergman, after
much reflection, finally pulled
up stakes and left his native
country, refusing to pay taxes on
his income at a rate of 139 per

cent.
Unfortunately, such high tax
rates are not uncommon for
wealthier Swedes. Even an indi
vidual earning $12,000 per year
pays 70 percent of it in taxes.

These tax rates have had im
portant consequences. Perhaps
the most important of these is
that professional people have an
incentive not to work.
Tax evasion
In addition, there is wide
spread use of barter to escape
taxes. A dentist, for example,
might fill a carpenter's cavities if

the carpenter fixes the dentist's
roof. Neither service involves
money so neither service is re
corded as income, and hence
neither is subject to tax.
The Swedish government es
timates that it loses about $3 bill
ion because of various forms of
tax fraud.
To fight such evasion, the
government has deployed an
army of tax bureaucrats with ex
tensive powers under a new ter
rorism law to insure that every
citizen pays "his fair share." The
Palme government may be using
tax investigation of wealthy
people to bolster its sagging
support among the working
classes.
Governmental power
Thus, the Swedish govern
ment has tremendous power to
squeeze every last penny out of
its citizenry to help finance the
welfare state. This power has
fueled the arrogance of a
bureaucracy which Bergman

calls a "galloping cancer."
Taxation policy in Sweden is
important because it represents
the ultimate application of an
important liberal goal: truly
"progressive" taxation. What
liberals in this country have
failed to consider is the other
side of the coin.
This other side is the inevita
ble growth in governmental
power which must accompany a
steeply progressive tax system.
As individuals are given a grea
ter incentive to find ways to
evade taxes, the government
must grasp greater power to
track them down and collect
those taxes.
Property rights
Another issue concerns prop
erty rights. A system which viol
ates the property rights of the
rich is just as immoral as one
which neglects the poor. Yet, in
exactinga tax rate of 70 percent,
it is just those rights which the
Swedish system violates.
It is partly because of these in
justices and the arrogance of the
government which perpetuates
it that Ingmar Bergman decided
to leave his beloved native coun
try.
