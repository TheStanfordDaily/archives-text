# Public control reactors
## 
### 
In another month, Californians will vote on the
Nuclear Power Plants Initiative (Proposition 15).
The outcome of that vote will not only decide
whether nuclear safeguards will be sub
jected to open public evaluation; it will also indi
cate a shift of power within the society. Either big
money and big government will con
tinue, or control will be given back to the Ameri
can people.
The Initiative is important, and all voters must
make an intelligent and open minded decision.
But before that is possible, certain misconcep
tions about nuclear energy and the Initiative must
be cleared up.
First of all, the Initiative is not a subtle attempt
to shut down nuclear power. All it asks is that
systems designed to keep radioactivity out of the
environment be sufficiently tested and that cur
rent liability limits be removed to assure full
compensation for losses in nuclear accidents.
If these conditions are not met, enforcement
procedures will be implemented to reduce nuc
lear power plant output. Such action is not the
beginning of an irreversible shutdown process.
Any limit on nuclear power generating capacity is
intended as a last-resort safety measure, to be used
if commercial safety systems are proven unsatis
factory.
Reduction timetable
The time table for power reductions is designed
to give the law some teeth while allowing enough
time for the nuclear industry to prove its assertion
that nuclear energy is safe. Opponents of the In
itiative believe that the industry has already
proved itself and that the standards in the Initia
tive are unnecessary. What are these standards,
and how important are they?
1.) The Initiative requires that all reactor safety
systems be tested in actual operation on "substan
tially similar systems." The most important
emergency safety device, the Emergency Core
Cooling System (ECCS), has never been tested in
actual operation. It is tested on scale models and
computer simulations which many physicists say

are inaccurate because the physics of a nuclear
reactor are not completely understood. The ECCS
has failed many times even in the small scale
simulations.
2.) Despite the expenditure of several years time
and many millions of dollars, no permanent
radioactive waste storage method has yet been
approved by the federal government. These
wastes remain exceedingly toxic for tens of
thousands of years and have been shown to travel
very readily throughout the biosphere when
stored improperly. The Initiative would require
the development of adequate permanent waste
storage within five years.
Price Anderson
3.) In the event that radioactive material escapes
into the environment, the public must be pro
tected from losses due to property damage. The
Price-Anderson Act of 1957 established a liability
limit of $560 million for nuclear accidents. A seri
ous accident could cause $15 billion in damage.
Nuclear accidents are unique in that individuals
cannot buy any personal insurance to supplement
federal and industry insurance. The Initiative
states that this liability limit must be removed
within one year.
Although the Initiative is primarily concerned
with nuclear safeguards, its real significance lies
much deeper. Energy policy, like foreign policy,
has rarely been influenced by the wishes of com
mon Americans.
Nuclear energy has been particularly isolated
from public control. The excuse is that these is
sues are too complex for the layman to under
stand. Decision making should be left to a few
"experts" who "know what is best." In a true
democracy, no issue is beyond the realm of public
decision and debate. Californians and all other
Americans must seize any opportunity they can to
restore a true democracy. The nuclear Initiative
provides such an opportunity. A "yes" vote on the
Initiative is for giving power to the people.
