## Reagan is wrong on Panama 
### 
Peter Fredericks

One of the major issues on which Governor
Reagan has based his assault on President Ford's
foreign policy is the Panama Canal negotiations.
That he has been able to make political capital of
this situation suggests that Americans have not
learned that they must assess the relative impor
tance of different national interests.
Reagan insists that the Canal Zone "is sovereign
Uniied States territory just the same as Alaska is
and as the part of Texas that came out of the
Gadsden Purchase and the states carved out of the
Louisiana Purchase" and that "the people of the
United States do not want to give the Panama
Canal away." He therefore opposes the negotia
tions, initiated by President Johnson after riots in
Panama in 1964 resulted in the deaths of 24
people, which are directed toward the composi
tion of a new treaty to replace that of 1903.
One very relevant criticism of Reagan's position
comes from Vice-President Rockefeller, who
maintains that the United States does not really
possess sovereignty over the Canal Zone, a con
tention that would be supported by most experts.
The 1903 treaty carefully granted this country
only certain rights to act as "if it were the
soverign." That the United States has in fact never
claimed actual sovereignty is evidenced by a 1936
treaty which refers to the area as "territory of the
Republic of Panama under the jurisdiction of the
United States" and the $2.3 million per year pay
ments made to Panama.
Guerrilla war
Senator Goldwater emphasizes a different con
sideration, that failure to reach an agreement may
lead to "open military conflict." Although he has
not explicitly said so, he apparently fears that
such a "guerrilla war" would not only involve
Panamanians but also troops from the rest of Latin
America. Many Latin American leaders view the
situation as a test of United States intentions.
Refusal to conclude a new treaty could perma
nently alienate some of them and make the United
States appear colonial in the eyes of world opin
ion.
Even more disturbing than Reagan's position
itself is the reasoning behind it. When asked how
far he would go to maintain the status quo in the
Canal Zone, he replied, "How far would we go to
stop somebody from taking the state of Alaska?" It
is apparent that he is neither differentiating the
value of various national interests nor consider
ing long-term concerns.
Our real interests, in the words of Ambassador
at Large Ellsworth Bunker, chief U.S. negotiator
for the Panama Canal treaty, are "a canal that is
open, safe, efficient and neutral" and "fair treat
ment" for American citizens in the area, both of
which are insured by the fundamental principles
upon which the negotiations have been based and
upon which any new treaty will rest. Sovereignty

in the Canal Zone is simply not a vital, irreducible
national interest and it is dangerous to treat it as
such.
Should negotiate
Our interests will certainly be better served by
negotiating, as the canal is quite vulnerable and
would probably be closed in the event of the
armed conflict that Goldwater foresees. Similarly,
in the long run a troublesome situation may
be resolved, halting a source of the disconcert
ing trend of growing hostility toward the United
States in Latin America.
Unfortunately, Reagan may be correct in assert
ing that he represents the view of the majority of
Americans and political observers do attribute
much of his recent success to his strong stand on
this issue. In any case, a large percentage of citi
zens consider it both necessary and possible to
maintain the present situation unchanged.
Although most congressmen might be expected
to have perspective and accurate knowledge of
the facts, this does not appear to be the case.
Senator Strom Thurmond heads a bloc of 35
senators who oppose the yielding of United States
"sovereignty," and the House voted 246 to 164 to
withhold all State Department funds that might be
used "to negotiate the surrender or relinquish
ment of U.S. rights" over the canal. If the present
configuration in Congress remains unaltered, a
new treaty embodying our true national interests
and providing the foundation for more amiable
relations with Latin America will be rejected.
Recent foreign policy reversals teach that the
United States must carefully scrutinize each na
tional interest to define its relative importance
and determine what kind of action is warranted,
emphasizing long-term considerations. If Gover
nor Reagan's success with his strategy of opposi
tion to the Panama Canal negotiations is any indi
cation of the real situation, then many Americans
have still not learned this lesson.
