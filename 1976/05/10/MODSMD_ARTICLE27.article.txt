# Alumni Assoc. funds well spent

In his May 5 guest editorial "Alumni
Funds Usage," John Sullivan, '65, exhibits a
woeful lack of understanding of the nature
and functions of the Stanford Alumni As
sociation. Perhaps this is our fault, which is
distressing when we consider the amount of
paper we must have sent him over the past
11 years.
The purposes of the independent Alumni
Association, to quote its articles of incorpo
ration, are "to promote the interests of Stan
ford University and to establish and main
tain a mutually beneficial relationship bet
ween the University and its alumni."
The Association promotes Stanford's in
terests by offering the alumni a variety of
rewarding ways to become involved with
the University. Hopefully, such involve
ment leads to a continuing sense of identifi
cation with the institution and ultimately
to increased support — financial and
otherwise — for Stanford. The Alumni
Executive Board, which governs the As
sociation, is determined that Stanford's ex
cellence shall be maintained and enhanced.
And—let's not kid ourselves—this requires
money.
While the Association is not directly in
volved in fundraising, it supports and
applauds the efforts of the Development Of
fice and of the thousands of alumni volun
teer workers who are.

Nonetheless, the University cannot ap
proach the alumni solely with a collection
plate. Those who have attended Stanford in
the past must be kept abreast of the exciting
new developments on campus, and — more
important — must have opportunities to
partake of the stimulating intellectual and
social substance of the present-day Univer
sity.
Publications
This is where the Alumni Association
comes in. It offers an impressive array of
publications (the handsome Stanford
Magazine, the award-winning Portable
Stanford reading series, the Alumni Al
manac)-, superb recreational facilities at the
Stanford Sierra Camp and the Stanford Al
pine Chalet; a stimulating Travel/Study
program; a host of educational offerings
ranging from the 10-day Summer Alumni
College on campus to more than a dozen
"Day Colleges" in cities throughout the
country. It supports some 80 Stanford clubs
and works with classes on their reunions. It
also provides headquarters for the student
directed Stanford-in-Covernment program,
and maintains the "Career Exposure" and
the "Alumni Contact Service" programs to
assist currently enrolled students with their
career planning.
Mr. Sullivan complains that the Associa
tion does not provide job placement assis-

tance for alumni. Were it not for the fact that
the University has an excellent, profession
ally staffed Career Planning and Placement
Center which stands ready to help alumni, I
expect the Alumni Association would be
doing this, too.
Dues pay
But virtually, all of what the Association
does do is financed by membership dues —
not by "donations." It is the dues paid by
our more than 41,000 members that enable
the Association to provide publications,
programs, and facilities for the enjoyment
and edification of alumni. And if the As
sociation did not provide them, then the
University would have to do so — at consid
erable expense to Stanford.
To imply that the Stanford Alumni As
sociation is not concerned with "the de
velopment of the University," is, in a word,
wrong. If we've not convinced Mr. Sullivan
of this, then I'm afraid we'regoing to have to
inundate him with some more irresistibly
persuasive literature. It's our hope, though,
that he — and indeed all present and former
Stanford students — will see that member
ship in the Alumni Association is one
means of maintaining a rewarding, life-long
tie with Stanford.
