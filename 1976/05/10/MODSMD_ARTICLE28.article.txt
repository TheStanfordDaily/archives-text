# Waste of resources should be reduced

How can people be made to remember
that everything we have is ours because
we are fortunate enough to have been
born in a land of abundance? How
can it be stressed that every act of waste
fulness we commit brings us closer to the
time when our precious gift will be de
pleted?
The problem of waste is particularly
acute on campus. Many students come
from reasonably fortunate backgrounds;
certainly no student here has suffered as
have some in less materially fortunate
areas of the world.
The problem is aggravated by the fact
that many of these resources are available
here free (or at least prepaid), and conser
vation offers no immediate prospect of
material gain. Conservation becomes a
voluntary, conscious effort on the part of
the individual, an effort which is often
inconsistently made by even the most
concerned person.
Three examples of waste on campus

come quickly to mind. They are: wasted
electricity, failure to recycle food and be
verage containers and wasted paper.
Wasted electricity
Wasted electricity is a prime example
of negligence brought about by the idea
that "I'm not paying for it." Indirectly
students do indeed pay for the electricity
they use. but that is not the point. Even if
we could afford to waste this resource in
terms of money, we cannot afford to waste
the irreplacable resources used to gener
ate it.
Few people think of this when they
waste electric power; a field of natural gas
in Texas is simply too far removed from
the bathroom light switch to concern us.
Cans and bottles are fairly easily recy
cled by dorms. Cardboard boxes can be
placed in laundry rooms or other easily
accessible areas, and dorm members can
take the volume material to recycling cen
ters. It is far too easy (and thus common)

to toss these items in the garbage and
think no more of them.
Paper wastage
Paper wastage manifests itself in
numerous ways on campus, yet it could
be minimized through the exercise of a
little self-control.
Thefood service supplies paper cups in
addition to glasses; most students invari
ably opt for the former. The problem is
that glasses must be washed and stored,
while paper need only be disposed of.
Here the food service could help by en
couraging the use of glasses, or by
eliminating paper cups altogether.
Paper towels in the restrooms consti
tute an unnecessary luxury; more end up
being wasted than used. Since it is neces
sary to take a towel to the bathroom when
showering, why can't this be done when
washing one's face and hands? A towel is
far more effective and comfortable than
those scratchy, non-absorbent sheets of

fiber anyway.
To be sure, each individual should do
what he can to cut down on his personal
waste of resources. But there is something
more which can be done.
Each person should help others to be
come less wasteful. A gentle reminder
should be enough. It may at first seem that
a person has the right to do as he wishes
and should not bebothered. But it must be
realized that no one has the right to waste
needlessly that which is his by fortune
and which should be made to last for fu
ture generations, so they too might share in
the prosperity of our portion of the globe.
If enough people take an attitude of
concern toward the problem of conserva
tion, it will become unfashionable to be
wasteful and a major step will have been
taken toward the appreciation and con
servation of our limited natural resources.

material gain. Conservation becomes a
voluntary, conscious effort on the part of
the individual, an effort which is often
inconsistently made by even the most
concerned person.
Three examples of waste on campus

come quickly to mind. They are: wasted
electricity, failure to recycle food and be
verage containers and wasted paper.
Wasted electricity
Wasted electricity is a prime example
of negligence brought about by the idea
that "I'm not paying for it." Indirectly
students do indeed pay for the electricity
they use. but that is not the point. Even if
we could afford to waste this resource in
terms of money, we cannot afford to waste
the irreplacable resources used to gener
ate it.
Few people think of this when they
waste electric power; a field of natural gas
in Texas is simply too far removed from
the bathroom light switch to concern us.
Cans and bottles are fairly easily recy
cled by dorms. Cardboard boxes can be
placed in laundry rooms or other easily
accessible areas, and dorm members can
take the volume material to recycling cen
ters. It is far too easy (and thus common)

to toss these items in the garbage and
think no more of them.
Paper wastage
Paper wastage manifests itself in
numerous ways on campus, yet it could
be minimized through the exercise of a
little self-control.
Thefood service supplies paper cups in
addition to glasses; most students invari
ably opt for the former. The problem is
that glasses must be washed and stored,
while paper need only be disposed of.
Here the food service could help by en
couraging the use of glasses, or by
eliminating paper cups altogether.
Paper towels in the restrooms consti
tute an unnecessary luxury; more end up
being wasted than used. Since it is neces
sary to take a towel to the bathroom when
showering, why can't this be done when
washing one's face and hands? A towel is
far more effective and comfortable than
those scratchy, non-absorbent sheets of

fiber anyway.
To be sure, each individual should do
what he can to cut down on his personal
waste of resources. But there is something
more which can be done.
Each person should help others to be
come less wasteful. A gentle reminder
should be enough. It may at first seem that
a person has the right to do as he wishes
and should not bebothered. But it must be
realized that no one has the right to waste
needlessly that which is his by fortune
and which should be made to last for fu
ture generations, so they too might share in
the prosperity of our portion of the globe.
If enough people take an attitude of
concern toward the problem of conserva
tion, it will become unfashionable to be
wasteful and a major step will have been
taken toward the appreciation and con
servation of our limited natural resources.

How can people be made to remember
that everything we have is ours because
we are fortunate enough to have been
born in a land of abundance? How
can it be stressed that every act of waste
fulness we commit brings us closer to the
time when our precious gift will be de
pleted?
The problem of waste is particularly
acute on campus. Many students come
from reasonably fortunate backgrounds;
certainly no student here has suffered as
have some in less materially fortunate
areas of the world.
The problem is aggravated by the fact
that many of these resources are available
here free (or at least prepaid), and conser
vation offers no immediate prospect of
material gain. Conservation becomes a
voluntary, conscious effort on the part of
the individual, an effort which is often
inconsistently made by even the most
concerned person.
