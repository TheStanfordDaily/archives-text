# USE to submit proposals demanding improved wages, benefits, working conditions
## 
### Bill Sing 
The United Stanford Employees
(USE) will submit their formal written
contract proposals to University offi
cials sometime today, according to
USE President Jim Berk.
USE will seek major changes and
additions in its current three year con
tract with the University which ex
pires August 31. No date has been set
for the start of formal contract negotia
tions.
USE represents approximately 1400
technical, maintenance, and service
personnel.
Among the major changes and addi
tions USE seeks in its pay package
with the University are:
—retroactive cost-of-living pay
ments to workers from the last three
years, amounting to $1858 per worker;

—initial cost-of-living raises of $65
per month per worker;
—cost-of-living raises of $65 per
month per worker;
—cost-of-living adjustments in fu
ture pay based on quarterly Consumer
Price Index changes;
—range adjustments to meet com
munity wage standards;
—minimum pay of $774 per month
or $4.47 per hour with cost-of-living
adjustments.
Major revisions
USE will also seek major revisions in
benefits and working conditions from
the University. These include merging
vacation and sick-leave allowances
and provision for payoff of excess not
used, all health and dental plan costs
to be paid by the University, with im
proved benefits, minimization of

layoff's and departmental seniority for
selection in layoffs.
Other revisions sought by the USE
include no forced overtime, increases
in severance pay benefits, strengthen
ing protection of union stewards in
discipline cases and adding more ste
wards, strengthening the union's role
in safety and prohibiting non-unit
workers from doing unit work. The
USE also seeks to tighten control over
outside contracting.
Trade off
Berk said that during the present
contract period, worker's wages have
held their own against inflation, but
that increases in worker productivity
and promotions have "traded off with
inflation."
"Union wages have yet to meet
equity with wages paid for the same
work outside the University." said
Berk. Union members have looked at
the proposals and there has been no
great "earthshaking" feedback on any
major changes or additions to them, he
said.
University Chief Counsel for
Employe Relations Douglas Barton
said that the University will give no
official response to the union's formal
proposals until it actually receives
them. However, a preliminary list of
important proposals, along with USE's
proposed unit agreement, was submit
ted to Barton on April 30.
Barton called the initial union prop
osals "voluminous and unreasona
ble."
'Not realistic'
"It is not what I was hoping to see as
a reasonable attempt on their part to
work toward a settlement. It's just not a
realistic way to start," said Barton.
"Economically, the proposals are far
from reasonable," he continued.
"Anybody looking at t hem would have
to agree."

NEGOTIATIONS TO BEGIN — United Stanford Employees (USE) President
Jim Berk foresees tough bargaining with the University administration over
union demands. The USE contract expires this August.
Barton said that retroactive cost-ol
living payments of $1858 to each
worker would amount to about 20 per
cent of the average yearly wage of USE
employees, quite a "substantial fi
gure."
"Many of their demands are quite
similar in nature to those the last time
around," he said. "The union appa
rently hasn't learned anything from
the past two years. Their demands
haven't learned anything from the past
two years. Their demands weren't ac
ceptable then and there's no reason
why they should be acceptable now.
"It's not clear to me why they want
to replow that same ground again,"
said Barton.
During contract negotiations two

years ago, USE members struck for
three weeks before reaching agree
ment on their current contract with the
University, now soon to expire.
Berk said that he expects the Univer
sity's attitude toward the union to be
the same as two years ago. "History is
repeating itself," said Berk, but it is
still "too early to be thinking strike."

NEGOTIATIONS TO BEGIN — United Stanford Employees (USE) President
Jim Berk foresees tough bargaining with the University administration over
union demands. The USE contract expires this August.
Barton said that retroactive cost-ol
living payments of $1858 to each
worker would amount to about 20 per
cent of the average yearly wage of USE
employees, quite a "substantial fi
gure."
"Many of their demands are quite
similar in nature to those the last time
around," he said. "The union appa
rently hasn't learned anything from
the past two years. Their demands
haven't learned anything from the past
two years. Their demands weren't ac
ceptable then and there's no reason
why they should be acceptable now.
"It's not clear to me why they want
to replow that same ground again,"
said Barton.
During contract negotiations two

years ago, USE members struck for
three weeks before reaching agree
ment on their current contract with the
University, now soon to expire.
Berk said that he expects the Univer
sity's attitude toward the union to be
the same as two years ago. "History is
repeating itself," said Berk, but it is
still "too early to be thinking strike."
The United Stanford Employees
(USE) will submit their formal written
contract proposals to University offi
cials sometime today, according to
USE President Jim Berk.
USE will seek major changes and
additions in its current three year con
tract with the University which ex
pires August 31. No date has been set
for the start of formal contract negotia
tions.
USE represents approximately 1400
technical, maintenance, and service
personnel.
Among the major changes and addi
tions USE seeks in its pay package
with the University are:
—retroactive cost-of-living pay
ments to workers from the last three
years, amounting to $1858 per worker;

—initial cost-of-living raises of $65
per month per worker;
—cost-of-living raises of $65 per
month per worker;
—cost-of-living adjustments in fu
ture pay based on quarterly Consumer
Price Index changes;
—range adjustments to meet com
munity wage standards;
—minimum pay of $774 per month
or $4.47 per hour with cost-of-living
adjustments.
Major revisions
USE will also seek major revisions in
benefits and working conditions from
the University. These include merging
vacation and sick-leave allowances
and provision for payoff of excess not
used, all health and dental plan costs
to be paid by the University, with im
proved benefits, minimization of

layoff's and departmental seniority for
selection in layoffs.
Other revisions sought by the USE
include no forced overtime, increases
in severance pay benefits, strengthen
ing protection of union stewards in
discipline cases and adding more ste
wards, strengthening the union's role
in safety and prohibiting non-unit
workers from doing unit work. The
USE also seeks to tighten control over
outside contracting.
Trade off
Berk said that during the present
contract period, worker's wages have
held their own against inflation, but
that increases in worker productivity
and promotions have "traded off with
inflation."
"Union wages have yet to meet
equity with wages paid for the same
work outside the University." said
Berk. Union members have looked at
the proposals and there has been no
great "earthshaking" feedback on any
major changes or additions to them, he
said.
University Chief Counsel for
