Why do slugs fizzle when you pour suit on
them? J.Y.
According to Asst. Professor of Biology Ward
Watt, a slug is a moist object without a good water
barrier. "A big problem for a slug is drying out,"
says Watt, and that's why most of his action goes
on at night.
With a high concentration of salt on the outside
of the slug, water is sucked out of him — "whether
he likes it or not, and he doesn't," adds Watt. This
osmosis "literally dehydrates the slug and virtu
ally causes him to collapse."
As for the "fizzling," this is caused by air bub
bling out during this tasty little process. Watt
speculates it may also have something to do with
the fact that the "slug is very displeased" with
what's going on. Incidently, he adds, "It's a grue
some thing to do to a slug."
On a recent pilgrimage to McDonald's, it occur
ed to me that the containers for many of their
products, for instance the "Quarter-Pounder,"
appear to consist of very non-biodegradable mute
rial. Does such an insane situation really exist? H.

According to an environmental information
pamphlet issued by McDonald's, their containers
are a form of plastic called expanded polystyrene.
Although it's not biodegradradable, polystyrene

foam "makes excellent landfill because, unlike
biodegradable waste, there is no danger of secon
dary pollution due to decomposed materials
being leached into the soil and water table.
In addition," says McDonald's "polystyrene
can be readily compacted and provides stable
landfill so that later construction will not settle."
McDonald's also says they "asked the prestigi
ous Stanford Research Institute" (hmmph) to re
view data comparing their packaging with paper
packaging. The study found polystyrene packag
ing to be "environmentally superior to paper pac
kaging.," because it weighs less and its produc
tion creates less water and air pollution and fewer
waste substances than the production of paper
products.
"Even the scraps resulting from trimming and
cutting are re-used in the production process,"
adds McDonald's. (Remember — they do it all for
you ... )
Why are there so many stop signs around cam
pus which apparently serve no purpose?
Sorry, but Master Planner Oscar Nelson says
there are no superfluous stop signs on campus.
The reason for so many signs, he said, is because
of the mix of traffic, and because of requests from
people for particular signs. "They aren't there for
the convenience of motorists — we've got alot of
other kinds of traffic to consider," says Nelson.

are a form of plastic called expanded polystyrene.
Although it's not biodegradradable, polystyrene

foam "makes excellent landfill because, unlike
biodegradable waste, there is no danger of secon
dary pollution due to decomposed materials
being leached into the soil and water table.
In addition," says McDonald's "polystyrene
can be readily compacted and provides stable
landfill so that later construction will not settle."
McDonald's also says they "asked the prestigi
ous Stanford Research Institute" (hmmph) to re
view data comparing their packaging with paper
packaging. The study found polystyrene packag
ing to be "environmentally superior to paper pac
kaging.," because it weighs less and its produc
tion creates less water and air pollution and fewer
waste substances than the production of paper
products.
"Even the scraps resulting from trimming and
cutting are re-used in the production process,"
adds McDonald's. (Remember — they do it all for
you ... )
Why are there so many stop signs around cam
pus which apparently serve no purpose?
Sorry, but Master Planner Oscar Nelson says
there are no superfluous stop signs on campus.
The reason for so many signs, he said, is because
of the mix of traffic, and because of requests from
people for particular signs. "They aren't there for
the convenience of motorists — we've got alot of
other kinds of traffic to consider," says Nelson.


Why do slugs fizzle when you pour suit on
them? J.Y.
According to Asst. Professor of Biology Ward
Watt, a slug is a moist object without a good water
barrier. "A big problem for a slug is drying out,"
says Watt, and that's why most of his action goes
on at night.
With a high concentration of salt on the outside
of the slug, water is sucked out of him — "whether
he likes it or not, and he doesn't," adds Watt. This
osmosis "literally dehydrates the slug and virtu
ally causes him to collapse."
As for the "fizzling," this is caused by air bub
bling out during this tasty little process. Watt
speculates it may also have something to do with
the fact that the "slug is very displeased" with
what's going on. Incidently, he adds, "It's a grue
some thing to do to a slug."
On a recent pilgrimage to McDonald's, it occur
ed to me that the containers for many of their
products, for instance the "Quarter-Pounder,"
appear to consist of very non-biodegradable mute
rial. Does such an insane situation really exist? H.
