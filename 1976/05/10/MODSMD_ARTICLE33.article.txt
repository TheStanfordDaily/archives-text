RA selection
I would like to clear up some
inaccuracies inPhilip Feder's ar
ticle on RA selection (Daily, May
6)- ,
Feder correctly quotes me as
saying that "rumors of injustice
are rampant" in RA selections;
however, he quotes me out of
context. I very carefully chose
the word "rumors," and 1 added
that while some of them were
probably true, I was sure that
many of them were false. I also
said that in any case, it was im
possible to evaluate the veracity
of these rumors. None of these
remarks were published.
Further, 1 never meant to
imply that the primary source of
inequity in selection procedures
was the panel overseeing round
one interviews. While I have ex
pressed my discontent with the
panel's procedures to Feder and
to Karen Murray, I am only
familiar with one case where a
person was, in my opinion,

treated unfairly.
I do feel that a major problem
with the selection process is that
candidates who are friends of a
particular resident fellow are
awarded jobs over more qual
ified applicants. However, 1
never stated that resident fel
lows have "too much control"
over the process. 1 see little al
ternative to resident fellows
making the primary recommen
dations, since they are best able
to select a staff for their resi
dence.
Further, it is unfortunate that
Feder's article dwelled upon
Florence Moore Halls, where 1
said that many of the RAs are
chosen because of their friend
ships with the resident fellow.
The problem is not limited to Flo
Mo, and although 1 cited that
dorm's staff as an example, they
should not be singled out.
Finally, Feder excluded from
his article the most important
remark that 1 made. That is, I
have no solution to the in

equities of RA selection.

Forgetting Nixon
Last week, it was reported that
President Ford has stopped
using Richard Nixon's name in
speeches. He said in explanation
that he regards the years 1969-73
as an unfortunate period in
American history that should be
forgotten as soon as possible.
Elie Wiesel appeared at Stan
ford to remind us of the tragedies
of Kent State and horror of the
Holocaust. He repeatedly ad
monished us not to forget the
past.
What has the world come to?
Six years ago, students were
hurling stones at buildings;
policemen were laying clubs
into young kids. Where are those
policemen today? Where is the
"administration" that students
felt was pressing them down? A
war is gone; snatched from our
sight. Was that the only "injus

lice" being fought? Did the
hundred thousand protesting
youths retire quietly home with
smiles of victory?
Nixon's name is painful to him
and us not because of what
Nixon did, but because it is a
painful reminder of what we let
him do to us and to the world.
Would Ford have us forget so
that we would as easily let
another man walk over us?

Westbound traffic on Galvez

Concerning your "Through

Westbound traffic on Galvez
Street will continue to be quite
difficult even without the posts
in front of Meyer. Westbound (or
eastbound) traffic is always dif
ficult on a street that runs north
south. Perhaps you might issue
compasses to your reporters.

RA selection
I would like to clear up some
inaccuracies inPhilip Feder's ar
ticle on RA selection (Daily, May
6)- ,
Feder correctly quotes me as
saying that "rumors of injustice
are rampant" in RA selections;
however, he quotes me out of
context. I very carefully chose
the word "rumors," and 1 added
that while some of them were
probably true, I was sure that
many of them were false. I also
said that in any case, it was im
possible to evaluate the veracity
of these rumors. None of these
remarks were published.
Further, 1 never meant to
imply that the primary source of
inequity in selection procedures
was the panel overseeing round
one interviews. While I have ex
pressed my discontent with the
panel's procedures to Feder and
to Karen Murray, I am only
familiar with one case where a
person was, in my opinion,

treated unfairly.
I do feel that a major problem
with the selection process is that
candidates who are friends of a
particular resident fellow are
awarded jobs over more qual
ified applicants. However, 1
never stated that resident fel
lows have "too much control"
over the process. 1 see little al
ternative to resident fellows
making the primary recommen
dations, since they are best able
to select a staff for their resi
dence.
Further, it is unfortunate that
Feder's article dwelled upon
Florence Moore Halls, where 1
said that many of the RAs are
chosen because of their friend
ships with the resident fellow.
The problem is not limited to Flo
Mo, and although 1 cited that
dorm's staff as an example, they
should not be singled out.
Finally, Feder excluded from
his article the most important
remark that 1 made. That is, I
have no solution to the in

equities of RA selection.

Forgetting Nixon
Last week, it was reported that
President Ford has stopped
using Richard Nixon's name in
speeches. He said in explanation
that he regards the years 1969-73
as an unfortunate period in
American history that should be
forgotten as soon as possible.
Elie Wiesel appeared at Stan
ford to remind us of the tragedies
of Kent State and horror of the
Holocaust. He repeatedly ad
monished us not to forget the
past.
What has the world come to?
Six years ago, students were
hurling stones at buildings;
policemen were laying clubs
into young kids. Where are those
policemen today? Where is the
"administration" that students
felt was pressing them down? A
war is gone; snatched from our
sight. Was that the only "injus

lice" being fought? Did the
hundred thousand protesting
youths retire quietly home with
smiles of victory?
Nixon's name is painful to him
and us not because of what
Nixon did, but because it is a
painful reminder of what we let
him do to us and to the world.
Would Ford have us forget so
that we would as easily let
another man walk over us?
