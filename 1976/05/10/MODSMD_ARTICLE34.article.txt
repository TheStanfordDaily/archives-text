Is there any remedy for getting over-lubricated
during intercourse?
Unfortunately, this predicament is out of your
hands. According to Fundamentals of Human
Sexuality, the bulk of vaginal lubrication ema
nates as diffuse secretion from the vaginal walls
themselves. And since the physiology of such sec
retory mechanisms is as yet undetermined,"vagi
nal weeping," according to Dr. John Dorman at
Gowell, cannot be regulated. Dr. Dorman added,
however, that "if this problem occurs only at in
tercourse, then there are many women who would
love to have (her) problem. If, however, a profuse
amount of moisture is present at all times, the
possibility of vaginal infections should be inves
tigated."
Oh, well, you can always take an optimists ap
proach and realize that "oil's well that ends well!"

My lover and I have discovered a rather unusual
erogenous zone —the ear!! When caressed by the
fingers or I more appropriately) the lips or tongue,
the results are titillating. We are delighted with

our discovery (naturally!) but are somewhat baf
fled as to the reason why this rather unassuming
appendage contains such hidden pleasure. Can
you offer any explanation for this phenomenon?
I'm afraid 1 don't know the etiology of "aural
sex," but Desmond Morris, zoologist and author
of The Naked Ape, hypothesizes that the "ear
lobes . . . appear to have evolved exclusively" to
"become highly sensitized to erotic tactile stimu
lation." Thus Morris asserts that the ear lobe is not
an evolutionary remnant but in fact is an active
erogeneous zone which "under the influence of
sexual arousal . . . becomes engorged with
blood . . . and hyper-sensitive." Furthermore,
Morris asserts that there are instances where
"both males and females have reached orgasms as
a result of ear lobe stimulation."
As an interesting aside, Morris mentions that,
"The side walls of the nose contain a spongy erec
tile tissue that leads to nasal enlargement . . . dur
ing sexual arousal." Orgasm from tactile stimula
tion of the olfactory appendage? Who nose?
