# Adoption today: a tighter 'market'

Although adoptable infants
are becoming more and more
scarce, illegitimate births are at
an all time high of more than
400,000 per year, says Raymond
Leber, assistant chief of adoption
services in Sacramento.
According to Department of
Health records, one out of every
seven babies born in California is
born to an unwed mother. And
almost all of these mothers,
Leber says, are keeping their
babies.
"Every study seems to indi
cate that while the number of il
legitimate births is rising, the
number of mothers who seek
agency or independent place
ment of their babies is down," he
said.
Society's gradual acceptance
of unwed mothers is, in part, re
sponsible. "There isn't the
stigma there once used to be
about having an out of wedlock
child," Leber said. "And in the
case of couples living together,
people seem to regard the fact
that they may have illegitimate
kids as almost irrelevant."
A recent article in Time
magazine states there are one

million U.S. families headed by
women who have never been
married, and 400,000 of these
women are still in their teens.
But often these situations
don't work out ideally. Says
Janet LeFevre of the Children's
Home Society, a private adop
tion agency, "Babies are darling
when they're young, but they do
grow up." And when they reach
school age they sometimes be
come a problem for their
mothers, who then realize they
"have to settle down."
"We are beginning to see this
with kids born in 1970, who are
now six years old. Sometimes
the mother can't handle it, so she
turns her child over to an
agency," said Leber. By that time
the child is usually too old for
easy placement.
Often couples in their mid
thirties who would be ideal for
raising older children have ad
justed themselves to not having
a fafhily. "To take a child would
be to disrupt the lifestyle they're
used to," Leber continued.
In limbo
And as a result, the child may
be in limbo for a long time.
According to Foster Care
Supervisor Carol Prussia there

are currently about 1350 chil
dren under foster care in Santa
Clara County. 90 percent of
which are ten years old or over,
including "a 14-year-old boy we
may never find a home for,"
Prussia said.
Only five percent of the 357
children in California placed by
the Children's Home Society last
year were school age, noted
LeFevre.
About 70 children are pre
sently in the County Shelter, a
"holding spot" for children
waiting to be placed in foster
homes.
"We always need more foster
families," says Shelter Super
visor Marsha Peterson. "Some of
these kids have been here as long
as four months," she said.
Changes
Foster family situations have
changed significantly in recent
years. According to Prussia, for
the past 10 years foster families
were told they were not eligible
to adopt the child they were fos
tering."
"We used to move the chil
dren every year so they wouldn't
get attached," she added. But
now it is possible for families to
adopt the child they foster, pro
vided the child is released from
his natural parents.
However, most adopters are
looking for an infant. "They
want to be in the act from the
beginning," notes Leber. "They
envision themselves going
through the diaper and learning
to walk and talk stage."
New abortion laws, wide
spread contraception, and more
unwed parents have made
adoptable infants a scarcity.
County Social Worker Annabel
McNamara said, "Although the
amount of kids we have changes
every day, at this moment we
only have about three children
under the age of eight that are
free for adoption.
However, most experts agree
that the true "baby shortage"
only refers to healthy, caucasian
infants. For this type demand
exceeds supply, and the waiting
period can last from three to five
years.
There are "several hundreds"
of people waiting for this kind of
child. "Some agencies won't
even accept applications right
now," added LeFevre.

Thus the healthy white baby
has become a profitable com
modity in a black market where
willing customers are reportedly
charged anywhere from $5000 to
$50,000 for an illegal adoption.
In a recent article, Associated
Press reported that "Children's
Agency officials estimate one
baby is sold on the black market
for every 20 who find a home
through legal adoption proce
dures," with the amount higher
in California because the popu
lation density provides more
buyers and merchandise.
"But you can't say there aren't
any babies," continued LeFevre.
Because while the waiting
period for a white baby can last
for years, a person can adopt a
black baby in about nine months.
According to LeFevre, many
people in the San Jose area adopt
racially mixed or ethnic minor
ity children. Statewide, about 40
percent of children placed last
year were non-caucasian.
Adjustment problems in inter
racial adoptions depend largely
on what Leber calls the "com
plexion of the community." If
the community is accepting,
there won't be many problems. If
not, says Leber, "the child is
doomed."
Harrassment
"When the family lives in a
fairly integrated community
they shouldn't have many seri
ous problems. But if the com
munity isn't integrated, usually
there will be lots of harassment
for both the parent and the
child," Leber said.
Although non-caucasian chil
dren are fairly abundant, pros
pective parents must go through
the regular adoption process: an
exhaustive number of applica
tions, interviews, and references
designed to match the right fam
ily with the right child.
"We don't really buy it when
people say 'we'll take anything,
we'll love any kind of child,' "
commented McNamara.
Leber says criteria for evaluat
ing a family interested in an in
terracial adoption is based on
"what their motivation is."
"We're not interested in help
ing them with their political
views, like if they just want to
show their friends that they are
liberal. We want what will be
best for the child."

STANFORD INDIANS? — Scouts gathered at a Scoutarama on campus this weekend to display their
skills in crafts, athletics and acting. These scouts, possibly unaware of the social issues involved, are
doing a skit on Indians.
