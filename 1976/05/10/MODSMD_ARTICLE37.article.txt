# TBZB: for Dylan 'freaks'
## 
### Chuck Hirsch 
With a brand new album, an
extensive tour, and an urgent cry
of protest on behalf of boxer
Rubin "Hurricane" Carter, Bob
Dylan is once again a name at the
top of American rock. Many
claim that it's like a resurrection
or a return to the sixties. But for
the editors of Talkin Bob Zim
merman Blues. (TBZB), a
magazine "published and edited
for the enjoyment ofDylanfans,"
Dylan has never left.
The magazine was started at
Boston University (BU), in 1975
by editor Brian Stibal. It was
originally planned as a newslet
ter to be published whenever he
got the time, and distributed
mainly to friends who were
"into" Dylan.
But those friends spread the
word to their friends, and it was
soon clear that there were still a
great many "Dylan freaks"
around. Since then, production
has increased enormously, and
TBZB is now distributed
nation-wide.
The usual reaction when
someone runs across TBZB for
the first time is "How can any
one print 26 pages an issue about
one man?" But the editors seem
to have no difficulty finding ar

tides or contributors. The
magazine contains album re
views, song critiques, and just
about anything you could possi
bly want to know about the man
or his music. Yet, the editors
shy away from "fan
type" news, such as the color of
Dylan's socks.
The editors admit that one of
their early goals was to get a
copy to Dylan himself, just to
have him comment on it. They
reached that goal this past fall,
but the only comment they got
was a "Thanks a lot."
Says Stibal, "Now we're
shootin' for a song. Just imagine,
"Talkin' Talkin' Bob Zimmer
man Blues Blues."
Stibal is still a full-time stu
dent, so free time is a big factor in
publication. So far he's been able
to keep up with both, with issues
being distributed three times a
year.
Recently, Stephen Pickering,
author of a number of books on
Dylan, happened upon a copy of
the latest issue. He was impre
ssed to the point of phoning Sti
bal and requesting a staff posi
tion. Stibal says Pickering has
been made Contributing Editor
and will publish in the next is
sue.
