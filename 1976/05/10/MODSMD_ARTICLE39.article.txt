# 'High level of sophistication'
## Human bio program: innovative learning experience 
### Dave Treinis 
"To students in the Core:
Human Biology has had, since
its inception, a special concern
with the interface between sci
ence and public policy. The first
two quarters have, we hope,
supplied the basic framework of
biological and social sciences to
allow you to engage specific is

sues as policy makers."
Thus begins the information
sheet addressing students enrol
led in Human Biology 4, a course
which as part of the human biol
ogy "core", emphasizes that
"science ultimately deals with
human beings and embodies as
pects other than pure biological
data," according to course co

organizer Richard Strauss.
Strauss, administrative assis
tant to human biology program
chairman Donald Kennedy,
explained that the new science
and public policy course "at
tempts to get back to the original
purpose of human biology — not
to cater to pre-professional
study."
Integration
The human biology program
was originally developed in

1969 to facilitate the "integra
tion of the pure sciences with the
social sciences," he said.
The methodology involved in
such an attempt employs infor
mal seminars and extensive dis
cussion within student "policy
groups," as well as class lec
tures. Each of the 16 policy
groups is comprised of 10 to 12
students who collectively work
on a given policy-making prob
lem.

Course reading is consoli
dated into "case books" which,
according to Strauss, are a
"compilation of primary source
material" followed by a state
ment of a policy-making prob
lem. The case books have been
edited by upper-division under
graduates who have completed
the human biology core.
Two modules
On the organizational level,
the course is divided into two
"modules" — one regarding
human health and one dealing
with environmental problems —
which are further subdivided
into two issue areas.
The issue areas being studied
this quarter are: abortion and
fetal research; health care in
America; Agriculture and En
vironmental quality; and ocean
resources.
Each policy problem is consi
dered independently by two pol
icy groups during a four week
period. The group outlines its

policy findings to the class in a
10 minute presentation followed
by a class discussion and ques
tion session.
Amniocentesis
Sophomore Jack Connelly, a
member of the policy group
which outlined guidelines for
amniocentesis (the sampling of
the amniotic fluid surrounding a
fetus to obtain information about
its genes), noted that the format
of the course is "a lot more 'real
life,' since someday the student
may be determining policies
similar to these."
Contrasting the course to con
ventional instruction, Connelly
stated that "the time spent in the
course is with the group, work
ing out policy, not in the clas
sroom."
Sharing Connelly's views,
sophomore Sherry Cassedy
added that "we (members of
her policy group) were living,
breathing and even dreaming
human biology."
Strauss stressed that "human
biology strives to present an in

terdisciplinary approach to edu
cation, rather than the tradi
tional multidisciplinary ap
proach."
Debbie Sloss, a junior Human
Biology major, presently in the
core, reflected Strauss' view.
"Rather than sitting down and
memorizing material to regurgi
tate it for the tests — as in most
classes — I was given the oppor
tunity to participate in innova
tive learning," she said.
Sophistication
"The level at which these stu
dents deal with these policy
challenges is on a level of
sophistication virtually equiva
lent to policy-making groups in
Washington, D.C.," Strauss re
marked.
Strauss feels that the course as
outlined is successful in its de
sign and that it will be continued
next year. "Human Biology 4 is
an ambitious experiment," he
said. "We think it has enormous
potential as an educational ex
perience."

sues as policy makers."
Thus begins the information
sheet addressing students enrol
led in Human Biology 4, a course
which as part of the human biol
ogy "core", emphasizes that
"science ultimately deals with
human beings and embodies as
pects other than pure biological
data," according to course co

organizer Richard Strauss.
Strauss, administrative assis
tant to human biology program
chairman Donald Kennedy,
explained that the new science
and public policy course "at
tempts to get back to the original
purpose of human biology — not
to cater to pre-professional
study."
Integration
The human biology program
was originally developed in

1969 to facilitate the "integra
tion of the pure sciences with the
social sciences," he said.
The methodology involved in
such an attempt employs infor
mal seminars and extensive dis
cussion within student "policy
groups," as well as class lec
tures. Each of the 16 policy
groups is comprised of 10 to 12
students who collectively work
on a given policy-making prob
lem.

Course reading is consoli
dated into "case books" which,
according to Strauss, are a
"compilation of primary source
material" followed by a state
ment of a policy-making prob
lem. The case books have been
edited by upper-division under
graduates who have completed
the human biology core.
Two modules
On the organizational level,
the course is divided into two
"modules" — one regarding
human health and one dealing
with environmental problems —
which are further subdivided
into two issue areas.
The issue areas being studied
this quarter are: abortion and
fetal research; health care in
America; Agriculture and En
vironmental quality; and ocean
resources.
Each policy problem is consi
dered independently by two pol
icy groups during a four week
period. The group outlines its

policy findings to the class in a
10 minute presentation followed
by a class discussion and ques
tion session.
Amniocentesis
Sophomore Jack Connelly, a
member of the policy group
which outlined guidelines for
amniocentesis (the sampling of
the amniotic fluid surrounding a
fetus to obtain information about
its genes), noted that the format
of the course is "a lot more 'real
life,' since someday the student
may be determining policies
similar to these."
Contrasting the course to con
ventional instruction, Connelly
stated that "the time spent in the
course is with the group, work
ing out policy, not in the clas
sroom."
Sharing Connelly's views,
sophomore Sherry Cassedy
added that "we (members of
her policy group) were living,
breathing and even dreaming
human biology."
Strauss stressed that "human
biology strives to present an in

terdisciplinary approach to edu
cation, rather than the tradi
tional multidisciplinary ap
proach."
Debbie Sloss, a junior Human
Biology major, presently in the
core, reflected Strauss' view.
"Rather than sitting down and
memorizing material to regurgi
tate it for the tests — as in most
classes — I was given the oppor
tunity to participate in innova
tive learning," she said.
Sophistication
"The level at which these stu
dents deal with these policy
challenges is on a level of
sophistication virtually equiva
lent to policy-making groups in
Washington, D.C.," Strauss re
marked.
Strauss feels that the course as
outlined is successful in its de
sign and that it will be continued
next year. "Human Biology 4 is
an ambitious experiment," he
said. "We think it has enormous
potential as an educational ex
perience."
"To students in the Core:
Human Biology has had, since
its inception, a special concern
with the interface between sci
ence and public policy. The first
two quarters have, we hope,
supplied the basic framework of
biological and social sciences to
allow you to engage specific is

sues as policy makers."
