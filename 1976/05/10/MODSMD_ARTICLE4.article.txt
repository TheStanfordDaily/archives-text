# Fire department merger foreseen
## Official says 27 staffers will be cut from Stanford station 
### Jacob Young 
A proposed merger between the
Stanford and Palo Alto fire depart
ments has been agreed upon "in prin
cipal" Plant Services Director Jason
Mavis said Friday.
Mavis said the final details of the
contract should be ready by the end of
this week and will then be passed on to
Vice President for Business and Fi
nance Robert Augsburger for final
negotiation with the city.
Under the proposed plan, the Uni

versity fire station and equipment
would become part of the Palo Alto fire
department and would answer calls
here and in Palo Alto. All members of
the Stanford department would be
employes of the City of Palo Alto.
27 positions cut
According to Mavis, the plan would
involve cutting 27 positions from the
station staff. No specific dates for the
cuts were given, but Mavis said that
the normal turnover rate in the de
partment should take care of the reduc
tion within three years.
The reduction would be possible be
cause of overlap and duplication with
the two departments, Mavis said.
"We don't want to see any of our
people hurt," Mavis said, adding that
"it is the goal" that no present depart
ment employes be fired.
The merger would mean that the
University department would gain one
pumper and one ladder truck. The
ladder would be able to reach the top ol
the buildings in Escondido Village,
which present University equipment
cannot do. Mavis said.
Full force
The proposed plan of action would
keep a full force of 32 personnel on
duty at all times. The full force would
include seven engine companies, two
truck companies, one salvage and a
paramedical unit and unmanned re
serve vehicles available for backup in
the event of a major fire.
The University would be responsi
ble for maintaining the fire hydrants
and alarm boxes. The dispatching
center would be moved to Palo Alto.
