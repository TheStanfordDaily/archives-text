# Fire department merger foreseen
## Official says 27 staffers will be cut from Stanford station 
### Jacob Young 
A proposed merger between the
Stanford and Palo Alto fire depart
ments has been agreed upon "in prin
cipal" Plant Services Director Jason
Mavis said Friday.
Mavis said the final details of the
contract should be ready by the end of
this week and will then be passed on to
Vice President for Business and Fi
nance Robert Augsburger for final
negotiation with the city.
Under the proposed plan, the Uni

versity fire station and equipment
would become part of the Palo Alto fire
department and would answer calls
here and in Palo Alto. All members of
the Stanford department would be
employes of the City of Palo Alto.
27 positions cut
According to Mavis, the plan would
involve cutting 27 positions from the
station staff. No specific dates for the
cuts were given, but Mavis said that
the normal turnover rate in the de
partment should take care of the reduc
tion within three years.
The reduction would be possible be
cause of overlap and duplication with
the two departments, Mavis said.
"We don't want to see any of our
people hurt," Mavis said, adding that
"it is the goal" that no present depart
ment employes be fired.
The merger would mean that the
University department would gain one
pumper and one ladder truck. The
ladder would be able to reach the top ol
the buildings in Escondido Village,
which present University equipment
cannot do. Mavis said.
Full force
The proposed plan of action would
keep a full force of 32 personnel on
duty at all times. The full force would
include seven engine companies, two
truck companies, one salvage and a
paramedical unit and unmanned re
serve vehicles available for backup in
the event of a major fire.
The University would be responsi
ble for maintaining the fire hydrants
and alarm boxes. The dispatching
center would be moved to Palo Alto.

OVER AND OUT — The student firefighter program will probably be discon
tinued under a proposed merger of the Stanford and Palo Alto fire depart
ments. Some of the student firepeople are Gregg Nanni, Dennis Leybold, Linda
Bammann, Ken Egusa, Scott Smith and Dave Evans.
The new program includes no pro
vision for the continuation of the stu
dent firefighter program. At present,
there are 14 student firefighters. These
students live at the station, receiving
free lodging and a salary.
They serve 24 hour shifts on alter
nate days. The program, part of the
financial aids program,includes "14 of
the best jobs on campus" according to
Scott Smith, one of the student
firefighters.
The student firefighters have ex
pressed concern about the proposal to
cut the program and according to Dave
Evans, another student fireman, the
group feels "a little bit like they aren't
getting a fair shake."
'Not cheap*
Mavis said that the student firefigh
ter program "is not cheap" and that the
program "would probably be elimi
nated" under the new contract.
Evans said that the students have
"almost no input at all" in the deci
sion, and that "there are no disadvan
tages to the student fire labor prog
ram."
Evans also said that the Committee
on Services to Students (COSS) had
recommended that the program be
maintained and that their recommen
dations had been sent to James Lyons,
dean of student affairs.
Evans said Lyons has sent a memo to
President Richard' Lyman supporting
the continuation of the student
firefighter program.

According to Mavis, the plan would
involve cutting 27 positions from the
station staff. No specific dates for the
cuts were given, but Mavis said that
the normal turnover rate in the de
partment should take care of the reduc
tion within three years.
The reduction would be possible be
cause of overlap and duplication with
the two departments, Mavis said.
"We don't want to see any of our
people hurt," Mavis said, adding that
"it is the goal" that no present depart
ment employes be fired.
The merger would mean that the
University department would gain one
pumper and one ladder truck. The
ladder would be able to reach the top ol
the buildings in Escondido Village,
which present University equipment
cannot do. Mavis said.
Full force
The proposed plan of action would
keep a full force of 32 personnel on
duty at all times. The full force would
include seven engine companies, two
truck companies, one salvage and a
paramedical unit and unmanned re
serve vehicles available for backup in
the event of a major fire.
The University would be responsi
ble for maintaining the fire hydrants
and alarm boxes. The dispatching
center would be moved to Palo Alto.

OVER AND OUT — The student firefighter program will probably be discon
tinued under a proposed merger of the Stanford and Palo Alto fire depart
ments. Some of the student firepeople are Gregg Nanni, Dennis Leybold, Linda
Bammann, Ken Egusa, Scott Smith and Dave Evans.
The new program includes no pro
vision for the continuation of the stu
dent firefighter program. At present,
there are 14 student firefighters. These
students live at the station, receiving
free lodging and a salary.
They serve 24 hour shifts on alter
nate days. The program, part of the
financial aids program,includes "14 of
the best jobs on campus" according to
Scott Smith, one of the student
firefighters.
The student firefighters have ex
pressed concern about the proposal to
cut the program and according to Dave
Evans, another student fireman, the
group feels "a little bit like they aren't
getting a fair shake."
'Not cheap*
Mavis said that the student firefigh
ter program "is not cheap" and that the
program "would probably be elimi
nated" under the new contract.
Evans said that the students have
"almost no input at all" in the deci
sion, and that "there are no disadvan
tages to the student fire labor prog
ram."
Evans also said that the Committee
on Services to Students (COSS) had
recommended that the program be
maintained and that their recommen
dations had been sent to James Lyons,
dean of student affairs.
Evans said Lyons has sent a memo to
President Richard' Lyman supporting
the continuation of the student
firefighter program.
A proposed merger between the
Stanford and Palo Alto fire depart
ments has been agreed upon "in prin
cipal" Plant Services Director Jason
Mavis said Friday.
Mavis said the final details of the
contract should be ready by the end of
this week and will then be passed on to
Vice President for Business and Fi
nance Robert Augsburger for final
negotiation with the city.
Under the proposed plan, the Uni

versity fire station and equipment
would become part of the Palo Alto fire
department and would answer calls
here and in Palo Alto. All members of
the Stanford department would be
employes of the City of Palo Alto.
