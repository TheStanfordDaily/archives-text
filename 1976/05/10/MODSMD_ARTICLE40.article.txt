"I could do nothing but play
great!"
Spoken by Tom Okker, the
ni nth ranked tennis player in the
world? Perhaps two-time Wimb
ledon doubles champ Frew
McMillan?
Nope.
Would you believe the
number six man on Stanford's
tennis ladder, the incomparable
Perry Wright?
Wright and freshman Matt
Mitchell teamed up for a doubles
set against Okker and McMillan
to steal the show from the WTT
Golden Gaters Friday night be
fore 3550 people. The Gaters
won the exhibition against the
men and women netters with an
overall game score of 25-21, but
Wright and Mitchell beat Okker
and McMillan 6-4 in a perfor
mance that brought women's
coach Anne Hill to her feet.
Wright was able to hold his
serve and had several aces in
dazzling the duo recently ranked
number one in the world.
Wright on
"It was the onset of Maples
Madness," Wright said after the
upset. "Just the energies of the
whole crowd really got me up.
This was the first time I've ever
played indoor Maples. I was
hot."
"They played better than I
thought they could," a stunned
Okker said. "They played very
well — very keen."

Another crowd pleaser was
the mixed doubles set pitting
Mark Mitchell and Susie Hagey
against Raquel Giscafre and
McMillan. Although the two
Cards have never played to
gether, "Mitch" took command
of the match against the Gaters
and he and Hagey looked like
seasoned veterans. He hit deter
mined overhead smashes that
caused a seemingly perplexed
Giscafre to wonder what she had
done to deserve such rough
treatment.
"Mitch" and Hagey scored a
6-1 win, but because of a WTT
"overtime" rule their win went
almost unnoticed.
Since the WTT format is five
sets (one each of women's sing
les, men's singles, women's
doubles, men's doubles, and
mixed doubles), scoring is done
by games rather than matches.
An overtime rule was recently
instigated in the event that the
mixed doubles set is won by the
team who is down in total
games. Play continues until the
team behind loses a game. If the
"underdog" wins games with a
tie in the game score results,
then a nine point tie breaker is
played.
Disheartening clincher
The total score following the
mixed doubles was 24-21 with
the Gaters on top. However, the
first game was won by the Gaters
in overtime and they clinched
the exhibition. Stanford coach

Dick Gould said, "The overtime
rule keeps people at the match.
The final score was still very re
spectable."
Gould told his players before
the Gaters exhibition that they
had "nothing to lose" and to
"have fun," but not all his
players enjoyed their perfor
mances.
Stanford's number one wo
man, Lele Forood took a 6-0 beat
ing in her set with Francoise
Durr, the number one women's
player of France.
"It all happened so fast,"
Forood admitted. The WTT for
mat allows only a few minutes
between sets. "I didn't even have
time to warm-up. I only had time
to hit a few practice serves. It
usually takes me an hour to
warm-up."
A-mazing
Bill Maze lost 6-3 to Jeff
Borowiak, the 1970 NCAA sing
les and 1971 NCAA doubles
champ from UCLA. The profi
ciency of Maze impressed
Borowiak.
"Maze has improved,"
Borowiak said. "He is already
very fast. He's got good control.
I'm sure he'll continue to im
prove."
In women's doubles Diane
Morrison and Barbara Jordan
took on Durr and Betty Stove.
However, the six-foot, 150
pound Stove did not use her size
to overpower the Card women.
Morrison and Jordan teamed up

to hit controlled balls that led to
a 6-6 set. The Gaters won the
tie-breaker 5-1.
Gould was pleased with the
teams' performances but disap
pointed in the size of the crowd.
"It should have been the Gat
ers largest crowd. We wanted to
expose them to the people on
this side of the Bay," he said.
"We wanted to play indoors
again and show the area that our
team is not just Lele, Pat, and
Bill. Maybe we don't have the
big names like Whitlinger and
Delaney which you need to draw
a crowd, but I think we showed
the fans we've got people who
are on their way up and just as
good.
"Frankly, 1 think the USC and
UCLA matches were more excit
ing because of the natural
rivalry. But as a spectator I like
the WTT format. There is no lull
— it's not so long and drawn out.
It's just boom, boom, boom.
"I earned a lot of respect for
the Gaters. It's hard to play as
many matches as some of their
players have this week (some
have been playing steadily since
Wednesday) and not look put
upon to play us in an exhibi
tion."
Tennis Notes:
Senior Craig Johnson, the Cards'
no. 8 man turned pro last week.
He won about $150 at the Cal
State Championships in Pebble
Beach.
Freshman Susie Hagey lost in
the quarterfinals of the Cal State
Championships Friday. She was
beaten by Charlene Murphy, a 14
year old from Alameda who
plays on the Alameda High
School team.
The fate of junior Gene Mayer
will be decided early this week,
Gould said. Mayer has been
hampered most of the season by
a pulled back muscle and most
recently by a virus. "Gene prac
ticed a bit last week but has little
stamina. I'm going to work him
full blast — three hours straight
— Monday and Tuesday. If he's
not in the shape he should be, he
won't play in the NCAAs."

overall game score of 25-21, but
Wright and Mitchell beat Okker
and McMillan 6-4 in a perfor
mance that brought women's
coach Anne Hill to her feet.
Wright was able to hold his

dazzling the duo recently ranked
number one in the world.

"It was the onset of Maples
Madness," Wright said after the
upset. "Just the energies of the

This was the first time I've ever
played indoor Maples. I was
hot."
"They played better than I
thought they could," a stunned
Okker said. "They played very
well — very keen."

Another crowd pleaser was
the mixed doubles set pitting
Mark Mitchell and Susie Hagey
against Raquel Giscafre and
McMillan. Although the two
Cards have never played to
gether, "Mitch" took command
of the match against the Gaters
and he and Hagey looked like
seasoned veterans. He hit deter
mined overhead smashes that
caused a seemingly perplexed
Giscafre to wonder what she had
done to deserve such rough
treatment.
"Mitch" and Hagey scored a
6-1 win, but because of a WTT
"overtime" rule their win went
almost unnoticed.
Since the WTT format is five
sets (one each of women's sing

by games rather than matches.
An overtime rule was recently
instigated in the event that the
mixed doubles set is won by the
team who is down in total
games. Play continues until the
team behind loses a game. If the
"underdog" wins games with a
tie in the game score results,
then a nine point tie breaker is
played.
Disheartening clincher
The total score following the
mixed doubles was 24-21 with
the Gaters on top. However, the
first game was won by the Gaters
in overtime and they clinched
the exhibition. Stanford coach

Dick Gould said, "The overtime
rule keeps people at the match.
The final score was still very re
spectable."
Gould told his players before
the Gaters exhibition that they
had "nothing to lose" and to
"have fun," but not all his
players enjoyed their perfor
mances.
Stanford's number one wo
man, Lele Forood took a 6-0 beat
ing in her set with Francoise
Durr, the number one women's
player of France.
"It all happened so fast,"
Forood admitted. The WTT for
mat allows only a few minutes
between sets. "I didn't even have
time to warm-up. I only had time
to hit a few practice serves. It
usually takes me an hour to
warm-up."

In women's doubles Diane
Morrison and Barbara Jordan
took on Durr and Betty Stove.
However, the six-foot, 150
pound Stove did not use her size
to overpower the Card women.
Morrison and Jordan teamed up

to hit controlled balls that led to
a 6-6 set. The Gaters won the
tie-breaker 5-1.
Gould was pleased with the
teams' performances but disap
pointed in the size of the crowd.
"It should have been the Gat
ers largest crowd. We wanted to
expose them to the people on
this side of the Bay," he said.
"We wanted to play indoors
again and show the area that our
team is not just Lele, Pat, and
Bill. Maybe we don't have the
big names like Whitlinger and
Delaney which you need to draw
a crowd, but I think we showed
the fans we've got people who

good.
"Frankly, 1 think the USC and

It's just boom, boom, boom.

Okker said. "They played very
well — very keen."

Another crowd pleaser was
the mixed doubles set pitting
Mark Mitchell and Susie Hagey
against Raquel Giscafre and
McMillan. Although the two
Cards have never played to
gether, "Mitch" took command
of the match against the Gaters
and he and Hagey looked like
seasoned veterans. He hit deter
mined overhead smashes that
caused a seemingly perplexed
Giscafre to wonder what she had
done to deserve such rough
treatment.
"Mitch" and Hagey scored a
6-1 win, but because of a WTT
"overtime" rule their win went
almost unnoticed.
Since the WTT format is five
sets (one each of women's sing
les, men's singles, women's
doubles, men's doubles, and
mixed doubles), scoring is done
by games rather than matches.
An overtime rule was recently
instigated in the event that the
mixed doubles set is won by the
team who is down in total
games. Play continues until the
team behind loses a game. If the
"underdog" wins games with a
tie in the game score results,
then a nine point tie breaker is
played.
Disheartening clincher
The total score following the
mixed doubles was 24-21 with
the Gaters on top. However, the
first game was won by the Gaters
in overtime and they clinched
the exhibition. Stanford coach

Dick Gould said, "The overtime
rule keeps people at the match.
The final score was still very re
spectable."
Gould told his players before
the Gaters exhibition that they
had "nothing to lose" and to
"have fun," but not all his
players enjoyed their perfor
mances.
Stanford's number one wo
man, Lele Forood took a 6-0 beat
ing in her set with Francoise
Durr, the number one women's
player of France.
"It all happened so fast,"
Forood admitted. The WTT for
mat allows only a few minutes
between sets. "I didn't even have
time to warm-up. I only had time
to hit a few practice serves. It
usually takes me an hour to
warm-up."
A-mazing
Bill Maze lost 6-3 to Jeff
Borowiak, the 1970 NCAA sing
les and 1971 NCAA doubles
champ from UCLA. The profi
ciency of Maze impressed
Borowiak.
"Maze has improved,"
Borowiak said. "He is already
very fast. He's got good control.
I'm sure he'll continue to im
prove."
In women's doubles Diane
Morrison and Barbara Jordan
took on Durr and Betty Stove.
However, the six-foot, 150
pound Stove did not use her size
to overpower the Card women.
Morrison and Jordan teamed up

to hit controlled balls that led to
a 6-6 set. The Gaters won the
tie-breaker 5-1.
Gould was pleased with the
teams' performances but disap
pointed in the size of the crowd.
"It should have been the Gat
ers largest crowd. We wanted to
expose them to the people on
this side of the Bay," he said.
"We wanted to play indoors
again and show the area that our
team is not just Lele, Pat, and
Bill. Maybe we don't have the
big names like Whitlinger and
Delaney which you need to draw
a crowd, but I think we showed
the fans we've got people who
are on their way up and just as
good.
"Frankly, 1 think the USC and
UCLA matches were more excit
ing because of the natural
rivalry. But as a spectator I like
the WTT format. There is no lull
— it's not so long and drawn out.
It's just boom, boom, boom.
"I earned a lot of respect for
the Gaters. It's hard to play as
many matches as some of their
players have this week (some
have been playing steadily since
Wednesday) and not look put
upon to play us in an exhibi
tion."
Tennis Notes:
Senior Craig Johnson, the Cards'
no. 8 man turned pro last week.
He won about $150 at the Cal
State Championships in Pebble
Beach.
Freshman Susie Hagey lost in
the quarterfinals of the Cal State
Championships Friday. She was
beaten by Charlene Murphy, a 14
year old from Alameda who
plays on the Alameda High
School team.
The fate of junior Gene Mayer
will be decided early this week,
Gould said. Mayer has been
hampered most of the season by
a pulled back muscle and most
recently by a virus. "Gene prac
ticed a bit last week but has little
stamina. I'm going to work him
full blast — three hours straight
— Monday and Tuesday. If he's
not in the shape he should be, he
won't play in the NCAAs."

Nope.

Perry Wright?
Wright and freshman Matt
Mitchell teamed up for a doubles
set against Okker and McMillan
to steal the show from the WTT
Golden Gaters Friday night be
fore 3550 people. The Gaters
won the exhibition against the
men and women netters with an
overall game score of 25-21, but
Wright and Mitchell beat Okker

coach Anne Hill to her feet.
Wright was able to hold his
serve and had several aces in
dazzling the duo recently ranked
number one in the world.
