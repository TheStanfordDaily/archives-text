# Davises lead the way
## Cards sweep twinbill 
### Linda Buddenberg 
The sunny skies of Santa Bar
bara must have proved too dis
tracting for the Stanford baseball
team Friday during a 5-3 loss,
but the Card nine settled down
and came back to win both ends
of a Saturday doubleheader, 5-3
and 15-5.
In taking the two games on
Saturday, the team equaled the
school record for most wins in a
season, 39, set by the 1971
squad.
Highlighting the double
header sweep the UC-Santa
Barbara (UCSB) were two home
runs by Stanford shortstop Steve
Davis.
His first blast, a grand slam in
the fourth inning of the first
game, put the Cards ahead for
the first time in the series. His
second shot broke a 5-5 tie in the
nightcap. Davis now has a sea
son total of 12 homeruns, only
one shy of the season record set
last year by Bruce Robinson.
Nightcap comeback
In the second game, leftfielder
Pepe Hinojosa put the Cards
ahead with a bases-loaded triple
in the sixth inning. The UCSB
Gauchos caught up in the
seventh, but Davis' home in the

eighth put the Cards ahead for
good, 6-5. Then, just for good
measure, Stanford came up with
nine more runs in the ninth.
Third baseman Gary Pitchford
highlighted the scoring in the
ninth with the team's second
grand slam of the day. His shot
over the left field fence was so
well hit that, as teammate Rusty
DuQuette said, "He started trot
ting as soon as he left the plate."
The big Card rally also in
cluded a clutch single by
DuQuette, his first hit of the sea
son. The Gauchos also came
through for the Cardinals with
two errors and four walks in the
inning.
Help from the pen
Two of the bullpen veterans —
Bruce Davis and Mike William
son — picked up the wins Satur
day. Davis came in to relieve
Williamson in the second inning
of the first game and held the
Gauchos for the rest of the game.
Mystifying them with his
hard-breaking slider, Davis al
lowed only four scattered hits.
Williamson picked up the win
in the second game. He pitched
the last three innings after starter
Rob Irwin and reliever Brian
Harrison had given up five runs.

Williamson held the Gauchos to
only one hit and struck out two.
In Friday's 5-3 loss, Bernie
Hittner allowed seven hits over
nineinnings. A weak first inning
was enough to beat Hittner
though, as the Card offense
never really woke up in time to
make up for a three-run Gaucho
first inning.
Stanford closes out its season
this week against Cal. The Cards
will be in Berkeley for a game
Thursday before returning to
Sunken Diamond for a
leheader on Saturday.
Four seniors — Davis, Hittner,
Williamson, and Gary Bei will be
playing their final games with
Stanford.
