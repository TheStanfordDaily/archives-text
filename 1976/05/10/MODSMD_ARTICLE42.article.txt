# Injuries hamper Barons

Stanford's showing at the an
nual West Coast Relays Saturday
in Fresno is better represented as
a casualty list than a track sum
mary.
Steeplechaser Stacy Geiken
hit one of the hurdle barriers
Saturday, banging his knee and

scraping his legs and hands.
"His knee swelled up quite a bit
and he will be shelved for the
year," track coach Payton Jordan
said of Geiken's injury.
Distance star Tony Sandoval
had his shoe kicked off by
another runner going into the
first turn of the 1500 meters.
Sandy suffered a small spike
wound on his heel from the inci
dent and had to drop out of the
race.
High hurdler John Foster
bruised a hamstring when he
came down on top of the hurdle
in the 110-meter highs. How
ever, both Foster and Sandoval
are expected to be at full strength
for the Pacific-8 Championships
this weekend at Cal
Another of this weekend's
casualties was Stanford long
jumper James Lofton. While the
sophomore from Los Angeles
suffered no physical injuries, his
undefeated record for the season
was broken when he failed to
qualify for the meet finals.
But cindermen did bring back
some good news from the valley.
Senior John Macrorie flung the
javelin a lifetime best of 219-7
feet while recording three
throws of more than 217 feet.
Coach Jordan continues to
prove an excellent model for his
team. The age-group world re
cord holder took the Masters 100
yard dash in 10.96 seconds, with
his nearest challenger crossing
the tape at 12.66.
