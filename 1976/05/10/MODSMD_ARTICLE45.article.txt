The Stanford women's golf
team turned in a 39 stroke vic
tory Friday at the Stanford Golf
Course to improve its Northern
California Intercollegiate Athle
tic Conference (NCIAC) record to
4-0.
The Cards totalled 324 to
runner-up Santa Clara's 363.
Pat Cornett led the field with a
two under par 74. Teammate
Pam Palmieri finished second
with a 77. Margaret Leonard and
Jana Garland of Santa Clara
deadlocked for third with 82.
Stanford's third and fourth
scores were supplied by Sally
Voss, who shot an 84, and Ellen
Sale, who contributed an 89.
Carroll Diaz, the women's golf
coach, said the teams performed
well. The home course, though
difficult at times because of
ravines, trees and tough dog
legs, proved an advantage. "I'm
pretty satisfied," she said. "Stan
ford is a course that requires
local knowledge." Comparing
the Stanford course to others in
the conference Diaz said, "It is
one of the toughest ones we've
played so far."
