Women booters win
The Stanford women's soccer
team placed first in its own tour
nament this weekend. The
women faced teams from UC-
Santa Cruz, UC-Santa Barbara
and Cal.
The booters won their opener
Saturday against Santa Cruz by a
score of 9-0. Four goals were
scored by Ellen Griep, while
Pam Krone, Noni Desmond,
Kathy Kelley, Vicki Hamilton
and Maria Duryea each added
one.
Stanford's second game was
again a shutout as the Cards
downed Cal. 1-0. With 10 mi
nutes left in the second half, the
Cards' Kathy Kelley broke
through to score on an assist by
Julie Zender. Quick action and

strong kicking by goalie Susan
Phelps kept Cal scoreless.
The women went on to defeat
three foes Sunday. The scores
were: Stanford 2, UCSB 0; Stan
ford 4, Santa Cruz 0; and in the
championship game, Stanford 1,
Cal 0.
Coach Phil Wright com
mented after the tourney, "To a
certain extent 1 expected us to
win. It was really good to see that
when Berkeley came on strong,
both the team and fans were pa
tient, and just had a good time."
Speaking on the women's re
sponse to soccer, Wright, a
former Stanford varsity soccer
player himself, said, "Their de
dication and desire shows they
love the sport. They are not
going to accept any comments

that its just a man's sport."
Cal sinks crew
Cal prevailed in all four crew
races against Stanford Saturday
at Redwood Shores. The
freshmen eight group came
closest to victory, losing by eight
seconds. Despite this setback,
Stanford coach Dick Dreis
sigacker praised the freshmen,
saying that they are "doing
pretty well." He added, "Cal is
pretty tough this year."
