# Johnson, Nixon ordered wiretaps
## Report says FBI eavesdropped on congressmen, other officials 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Information
regarding contacts between members
of Congress and foreign officials was
picked up by FBI wiretaps and bugs
and forwarded to Presidents Johnson
and Nixon according to a Senate intel
ligence committee staff report.
Eavesdropping material involving
members of Congress was first sent to
the Johnson White House in March
1966 in response to a request from the
President "that the FBI should con
stantly keep abreast of the actions of
representatives of these foreign offi
cials in making contacts with senators
and congressmen," according to a
bureau memo quoted in the report.
Johnson felt that many of the pro
tests against his Vietnam policies, par
ticularly hearings in the Senate, had
been generated by the foreign officials,
the memo said.
"As a result of the President's re

quest, the FBl. prepared a chronologi
cal summary of the contacts of each
senator, representative or staff member
who communicated with selected
foreign establishments," the report
said.
The practice was reinstituted by the
Nixon administration in July, 1970,
when White House aide Larry Higby
informed the bureau that chief of staff
H.R. Haldeman "wanted any informa
tion possessed by the FBI relating to
contacts between certain foreign offi
cials and members of Congress and its
staff," according to an FBI memo cited
in the report.
The report cited the eavesdropping
as an example of a situation in which
"even properly authorized electronic
surveillances directed against foreign
targets . . . may result in possible
abuses involving American citizens."
