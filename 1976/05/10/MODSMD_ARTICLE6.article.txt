# Departmental change
## Sociology committee potent says chairman 
### Sharyl Van Winkle 
"Five recommendations â€” one
week later, four were in operation."
That's the recent record of the sociol
ogy department's student-faculty
committee on academic reform, ac
cording to Dept. Chairman Sandy
Dornbusch. "The students have a
sense of potency," he said.
The committee, composed of three
undergraduates, four professors and a
graduate student, "keeps coming up
with ideas, and the faculty keep ap
proving them," said Dornbusch.
The committee, which was ap
pointed this fall, has with faculty ap
proval changed major requirements,

instituted a rule that every tenured
professor must teach one low level
sociology class a year and developed
two new classes.
"Supersociology," one of the clas
ses. is being taught this quarter. It is an
introductory sociology course which
uses the department's "terrific ex
perts" to lecture on their specialties,
said Dornbusch.
The plan for the other course calls
for two-student tutorials taught by the
"Oxford Plan": the two students each
write a short paper every week and
discuss their papers with their profes
sor during a weeklv meeting. Sociol
ogy majors will have first priority for
these seminars, but they will be open
to others, he said.
According to Dornbusch, part of the
spur for these new programs is sharply
decreased enrollments in sociology
classes.
He feels not enough persons in other
fields are aware of the value of sociol
ogy. Sociology courses teach "abstract
knowledge that is generally applica
ble," he said. For instance, a
sociologist's evaluation techniques
can be applied to "football teams, to
bacco factories and the Catholic
Church."
"We have the resources to do more
for our undergraduates and we're
going to do it," said Dornbusch, exp
laining why the department wants to
attract more students.
"We require more person power
than we have persons," he added, be
cause of the small number of graduate
students in the department.
There is "a lot of research money"
and many opportunities for under
graduate participation in research, he
said.
