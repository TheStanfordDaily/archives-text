# ARLO may relocate; lack of space cited

### Lori Matsukawa 
The possible relocation of the Ac
tion Research Liaison Office (ARLO)
will be discussed in at least three meet
ings this week between University
administrators, the Council of Presi
dents (COP) and the directors of
ARLO, according to ARLO co-director
Edith Eddy.
Space limitations and the introduc
tion of new programs by the COP may
force ARLO to vacate its present office
in the ASSU Offices at Tresidder Un
ion, said Hill Leland, ARLO's other
co-director.
"Essentially, it is an ongoing situa
tion at this point." said Leland. "The
ASSU is faced with space problems."
ASSU Financial Manager Chris
Cline said that since the ASSU budget
will be cut by the Dean of Student Af
fairs Office next year, "office space is
valuable."
"We'd like to have those projects
that make revenue kept in the (ASSLJ)
office. ARLO is not a money-making
project," he said.
The Course Guide, presently housed
in Tresidder. is also a non-profit pro
ject. but Cline said it would remain in
Tresidder next year.
ARLO coordinates and matches up
students with research projects spon
sored by community groups This is
ARLO's second year of service and ac

cording to its interim progress report
(released last month) has coordinated
80 projects with 54 different local
community groups this year alone.

ASSU off ice is tight for space. The lec
ture notes service may be expanded
next year. And (Assistant Financial
Manager) Chris Mathe is planning
more services for next year," said COP
President Vic Petroff.
"Second, ARLO isn't in the tradi
tional sense of the word an affiliate of
the ASSU. It is similar to the Legal
Counseling Office in that it needs an
office to conduct business hours. But
there are other projects that need this
central space," said Petroff.
No new location for ARLO has been
found yet, although Petroff said the
Old Firehouse may be a possibility.
A T-shirt embossing service may
be located in Tresidder next year, ac
cording to Cline.
"This problem happens every year.
It's one of the effects of having a con
tinually rotating COP come in with no
real experience in these matters," said
Eddy.
"They all feel a need to rejuggle the
offices. That's good in that it provides
a learning process for the people who
are chosen for the COP, but it is ineffi
cient because it is often a repetition of
past experiences."

"Second, ARLO isn't in the tradi
tional sense of the word an affiliate of
the ASSU. It is similar to the Legal
Counseling Office in that it needs an
office to conduct business hours. But
there are other projects that need this
central space," said Petroff.
No new location for ARLO has been
found yet, although Petroff said the
Old Firehouse may be a possibility.
A T-shirt embossing service may
be located in Tresidder next year, ac
cording to Cline.
"This problem happens every year.
It's one of the effects of having a con
tinually rotating COP come in with no
real experience in these matters," said
Eddy.
"They all feel a need to rejuggle the
offices. That's good in that it provides
a learning process for the people who
are chosen for the COP, but it is ineffi
cient because it is often a repetition of
past experiences."
The possible relocation of the Ac
tion Research Liaison Office (ARLO)
will be discussed in at least three meet
ings this week between University
administrators, the Council of Presi
dents (COP) and the directors of
ARLO, according to ARLO co-director
Edith Eddy.
Space limitations and the introduc
tion of new programs by the COP may
force ARLO to vacate its present office
in the ASSU Offices at Tresidder Un
ion, said Hill Leland, ARLO's other
co-director.
"Essentially, it is an ongoing situa
tion at this point." said Leland. "The
ASSU is faced with space problems."
ASSU Financial Manager Chris
Cline said that since the ASSU budget
will be cut by the Dean of Student Af
fairs Office next year, "office space is
valuable."
"We'd like to have those projects
that make revenue kept in the (ASSLJ)
office. ARLO is not a money-making
project," he said.
The Course Guide, presently housed
in Tresidder. is also a non-profit pro
ject. but Cline said it would remain in
Tresidder next year.
ARLO coordinates and matches up
students with research projects spon
sored by community groups This is
ARLO's second year of service and ac

cording to its interim progress report
(released last month) has coordinated
