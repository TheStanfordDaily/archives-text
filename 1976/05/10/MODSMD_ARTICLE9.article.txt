# Woman turns 'Moonie';

The fiancee of a resident here left to
spend an Easter weekend at the Unifi

Kidd contacted numerous recently

her Palo Alto apartment to remove her
belongings to Booneville.
"Concerned friends and I invented a

the Moonie farm to find out when
Alice was due to return to Palo Alto,"
he explained.
