# Woman turns 'Moonie';
## Unification Church intends to recruit entire campus? 
### Dave Treinis 
The fiancee of a resident here left to
spend an Easter weekend at the Unifi
cation Church's New Ideal Ranch three
weeks ago. She did not return at the
scheduled time and an attempt to re
move the young woman from the
ranch by a group of her friends has
failed.
The woman, identified as Alice, is
still at the ranch, according to her fian
ce , John Kidd, a hoarder in a profes
sor's house here.
The New Ideal Ranch, located in
Booneville, houses a branch of the
church founded by native Korean Re
verend Sun Myung Moon. Moon's fol
lowers, nicknamed "Moonies," are
taught a mixture of Christianity, Ko
rean faiths and anti-Communism.
When Alice did not return from
Booneville Easter Sunday, Kidd tried
to reach her by telephone. After several
fruitless calls, Kidd contacted rep
resentatives of "Eclipse" and "Moonie
Watchers", two Bay Area groups re
cently formed in an attempt to aid con
cerned families of Unification Church
recruits.
'Every minute counted'
"1 was advised to get her out as soon
as possible," Kidd said, "(and) that
every minute counted."
Kidd contacted numerous recently
returned ex-recruits of the church to
confirm Alice's whereabouts and
learned that Alice planned to return to
her Palo Alto apartment to remove her
belongings to Booneville.
"Concerned friends and I invented a
plot whereby two of us would infiltrate
the Moonie farm to find out when
Alice was due to return to Palo Alto,"
he explained.
Expert 'deprogrammer'
"We'd be waiting at the apartment to
escort her out the back door to a safe
location," he said, adding that "we
hoped to straighten her out ourselves
but were prepared to take her to an
expert 'deprogrammer' in Santa Cruz if
necessary."
Two co-plotters were chosen to infil
trate the New Ideal Ranch. They pre
pared and signed affadavits attesting
to their sanity and stating that "if
(they) did not not return before a
specified time, they were being held
against their will and the sheriff was
authorized to come after them," Kidd
said.
"They never made it to Booneville,"
he said. The motorcycle they were rid
ing to the ranch was involved in an
accident and the pair sustained minor
injuries.
"They spent the night in the hospi
tal, so I had no idea when to expect
Alice," he added.
"The Moonies showed up Monday
afternoon with three tremendous fel
lows — all of which were at least
6-foot-2 — and a woman who helped
Alice get her stuff. They were gone
before anyone was aware of what was
happening," he said.
"1 don't know how she fell for it,"
Kidd said. "We were in the Coffee
House a month before all this hap
pened when some Moonies came in
and informed us that they intended to
take over Stanford."
"They got her for sure," he added.
"She's not even aware of what she's
doing."
