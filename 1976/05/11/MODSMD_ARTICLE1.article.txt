# Does ASSU have blahs of spring?
## 
### Lori Matsukawa News analysis 
The ASSU Senate adjourned its
meeting last night without conducting
any business due to its failure to form
an 11-member quorum. No date was
set for another meeting.
By 8 p.m., a half-hour after the set
meeting time, the only members pre
sent were Senators Tim Conway, Brad
Krevoy, Kevin McDermott, Bob Ottilie,
Barbara Rizzardi, Bill Tyndall, Sheron
Veach and Steve Westly, and senate
chairman Bill Hoke.
Sen. Dan Livingston arrived later,
but the senate was still unable to reach
the quorum necessary to conduct any
official business and adjourned at 8:30
p.m. Sen. Elizabeth Larkam arrived
shortly after the adjournment.
Last night's "meeting" was just the
latest evidence of a "spring quarter
slump" which has actually plagued
the senate since winter. Hoke has often
had to leave meetings to call senators
and convince them to attend the meet
ings. Many times during the year, the
senate has just barely achieved
quorums.
Feeling of guilt
"Maybe it's good that no one
showed up," said Tyndall. "Maybe
people will feel guilty and come to the
next meeting."
"The senate used to be a really seri
ous student group," said Westly, "but
that was because it discussed heated
issues like the Bonfire where everyone
got involved. Now ..." he shrugged.
Hoke has tried to run his meetings
strictly according to Robert's Rules of
Order. Some senators say this is a
good, orderly system but others say it
makes Hoke seem like a teacher-figure.
"It's like, 'Now class, we shall do
this,' " said one senator. "The success
of a senate meeting depends largely on
the chairman."
The senate has often been accused of
being a "Mickey Mouse" organization.
When it indulges in birthday cupcakes
and wine during meetings or when
senators break quorum with over
dramatized walkouts to prevent resol
utions from passing, one wonders
whether this criticism is not well
deserved.
Frustrated
Perhaps the most justifiably frus
trated persons last night were those
senators, ASSU project managers,
University committee members and
interest group representatives who
came to testify on behalf of certain
proposals on the senate agenda.
The agenda for last night's meeting
included a presentation concerning
senate endorsement of a Human Rights
Policy; the financial manager's report
