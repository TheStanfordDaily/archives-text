# Russian invasion: solution to problems

I have a plan. If implemented its direct
effects would be to end Stalinist com
munism forever, to liberate Eastern Europe,
to transform all current American problems
into assets and to end all possibility of nuc
lear war.
Indirectly, it would lead to international
economic cooperation and solutions to all
major world problems. It has been troubling
my conscience a little that I haven't told
anybody about the plan.
In its essence the plan is very simple: the
Soviet Army must be induced to invade and
occupy the United States.
Only token resistance should be offered at
first. There is no point in anybody getting
hurt, even though the end result would rep
resent a distinguished martyrdom.
Must be Russians
There are a couple of provisoes. It must be
the Russians (corrupt, inefficient, brutal)
and not the Chinese (egalitarian, fanatical,
hard-working). Too much about the
Chinese way of life appeals to important
strands of American culture and a Chinese
invasion could cause serious divisions in
American society.
Also, we neither want nor need the Rus
sians in Western Europe, so they must be
persuaded to come by the back route, across
the Bering Sea.
I take it as obvious, militarily speaking,

that the United States will take a fair bit of
occupying. Thetask will stretch theßussian
Army,big thoughit is, to its limits — which
will be very good for the rest of us.
How should the American people behave
under occupation?
It must be a mixture of coercive subver
sion (a kind of specifically American guer
rilla warfare) and moral subversion. It is not
necessary to develop a plan for moral sub
version; it will happen automatically.
Prove superb
Whatever the failings of the United States
at playing away games (like Vietnam) 1 have
every confidence that in a guerrilla war
fought at home the American people will
prove superb. The Russian authorities have
little experience beyond pushing around a
bunch of Slavic peasants.
They will find a Mob, the Syndicate, the
Daughters of the American Revolution and
the Menlo Park Ladies Karate Association a
very different proposition. Nor will the
American guerrillas have any problem with
supply lines.
A hundred million hand guns, mail order
bazookas and 15 million Citizens' Band
radios will be ample equipment. ("Mer
cysakes, good buddy, ah'm a goin' huntin'
bear" will take a new meaning.)
But, of course, the real aim is not to defeat
the Russian Army; it is to subvert it. Here

again, the evidence suggests that it will
prove a pushover.
After all, it is rumored that a few Russians
became a little confused in Prague in 1968j
And in 1974,1 myself saw a Russian border
guard subverted into a considerable derelic*
tion of duty by an American youth.
Frisbee attack
The American achieved this effect simply
by throwing an object called a "Frisbee" at
the Russian. Imagine the effect when they
are faced with the real thing — Big Macs;
banana splits, call girls, payoffs an' all.
How should coercive and moral subver
sion be combined? In the American Way, of
course, by a system of incentives. Local
forces and commanders who respond easily
to Americanisation can be rewarded with
free ice cream sundaes, packaged tours to
Hawaii and appearances on Celebrity.
Squares. Those who are obstinate in the face
of history (who refuse to accept bribes, foij
instance) can be given the St. Valentines
Day treatment or be ignored at the country
club.
I can see no flaws in the plan and its
beneficial effects are too numerous to list
here. Come on, Henry old chap, think big for
once ....
