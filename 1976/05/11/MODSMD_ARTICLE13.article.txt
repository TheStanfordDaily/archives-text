# Letters: Pound, 'Moonies,' cruise

### 
Pound debate
I have written two books to de
fine where I stand in relation to
Ezra Pound's poetry, his person
ality and his politics. I am not
going to start doing it for a third
time in the Daily, so as to educate
Robert Cohn and Sidney Hook.
If these gentlemen had done
me the elementary courtesy of
looking at my published record
on these matters, the one of them
would not suppose that I en
dorse an "art for art's sake" de
fense of Pound, nor would the
other suppose that I need to be
reminded how "even the
greatest of poets is ultimately
called to account in moral
terms." For calling Pound to ac
count in those terms in Ezra
Pound: Poet as Sculptor (1964), I
have been assailed by Pound's
partisans.
The most revealing and shock
ing thing in Sidney Hook's
statement comes when he says of
Pound: "He escaped a traitor's
death because he was adjudged
technically insane ..." Thus
Mr. Hook is sure what the verdict
would have been if Pound had
been brought to trial; what a
mockery that makes of judicial
process, and what cynicism it
reveals about the rule of law in
the United States!
Pound might have been found
innocent; some of his friends be
lieve that he would have been
and bitterly regret that he was
not allowed to stand trial. Be
cause he did not stand trial, his
guilt cannot be assumed.
Thus Cohn and Hook want to
treat as closed a case that in fact
is perplexingly open. It is that
attitude, not mine, that has much
in common with the attitudes of
those who sent Jews and others
to the gas-chambers.
And from people who hold
that attitude I am certainly not
prepared to take instruction
about what constitutes "the life
of reason." Moralistic bullying
and emotional blackmail will
not get their way on this campus,
if I can help it.

There are a number of reasons
why I must object to the article
"Woman turns 'Moonie.' "
First of all, the use of the term
"Moonie" to describe a member
of the Unification Church is
equivalent to calling a Roman
Catholic a Jesus Freak, or
perhaps it is more analogous to
calling a Jew a kike. Second, the
woman voluntarily went to the
ranch and, as far as anyone
knows, joined the community
voluntarily.
Followers of the Reverend Sun
Myung Moon are different from
me but, when one asks them if
they are happy, they say "yes."
They enjoy being in a commun
ity where their role is clearly de
fined and the ambiguities of in
terpersonal relationships are
minimized.
The selfishness of the con
vert's fiance is clearly evident.
For his own reasons he cannot
cope with his friend's change of
lifestyle so he concocted a kid
nap theory. The only kidnap
ping described in the story was
the one which would have oc
curred had the woman needed
"deprogramming."
In our society people are sup
posed to have the freedom to
choose their lifestyles and relig
ions. Just because I feel I would
not be happy as a member of the
Unification Church doesn't give
me, or anyone else, the right to
kidnap and program its mem
bers into altering their orienta
tions.

Inept criticism
Constructive criticism is es
sential to the growth and de
velopment of any serious publi
cation. But Richard Cross' April
23 Daily review of S/HE
magazine is an embarrassingly
biased and superficially consi
dered attempt at analysis.
It contributed little to the pub
lic's understanding of the
magazine, an objective primary

to the work and integrity of most
reviewers.
Cross is a textbook example of
the bad critic — one who
criticizes the writer and not the
work.
His comments on Andrew
Leuchter's article, "Affirmative
action," were nothing short of
vitriolic, directed as much at
Leuchter as at the article itself.
His critique of Mary Ingersoll's
book review demonstrates his
absolute intolerance for ideas
which differ from his own.
Even Cross' praise of Laura
Coverson's article on gynecolog'-
calcare is predicated solelyonhis
agreement with her conclusions.
Cross' review has done nothing
to help the public evaluate S/HE.
Light has been shed only on
his own personal biases.

Bargain cruise
A week ago I received the

Stanford Alumni Association's
leaflet inviting reservations on
the "Alaska Oceans College
1976" leaving San Francisco
June 19 aboard the Pacific
Princess. Price (double occu
pancy): Fiesta Deck, $1650;
Aloha Deck, $1725 per person J
Most appealing.
In the same mail I received a
brochure for the "Travel with
Goren Alaska Bridge Cruise'!
leaving San Francisco June 19
aboard the Pacific Princess!
Price (double occupancy): Fiest4
Deck, $1428 (or $1176); Aloha
Deck, $1500 (or $1236) per per»
son.
If we make our reservations for
the plebeians' bridge cruise, will
it be permissible to rub elbows
with the patricians who havf
signed up for the alumni cruise?
