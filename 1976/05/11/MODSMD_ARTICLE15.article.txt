'My partner and / are getting tired of using rubbers and foam for
birth control. Is there anywhere we could get more information
about different methods and how they work?
This is worth repeating: For any birth control information, talk to
either a doctor at Cowell or a counselor at the Peer Counseling
service upstairs in Cowell. Both are free of charge.

Reader response:
Vou might like to know that the woman to whom you refer in
your April 6 article (about the ability to blow out candles with her
vagina) also pops walnuts out to her audience and has been prose
cuted in Philadelphia for this and the activity which you men
tioned. Something about obscenity ....
