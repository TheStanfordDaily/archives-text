# Church heads for showdown with Chile's junta?
## 
### 
SANTIAGO (PNS) — Tensions that
have simmered for two years between
church and state in Chile may be about to
erupt into a climactic showdown.
With the government accusing high
church officials of crimes close to treason,
rumors abound that church leaders are
threatening government functionaries
with excommunication.
Most recently, a government
controlled newspaper accused the
Catholic Vicariate of Solidarity — succes
sor to the ecumenical Committee for
Peace disbanded by the junta last year of
arranging the itinerary of three U.S. con
gressmen who spent a week in Chile this
March to investigate human rights viola
tions.
According to the paper, all those who
gave information to the "enemies of
Chile" committed an act of "lesa patria"
— akin to treason. They include Cardinal
Raul Silva and former President Eduardo
Frei.
One of them, lawyer Jose Zalaquett, his
si nee been expel led from the country, and
government publication of a list of others
who spoke to the congressmen is seen
here as a thinly veiled threat against the
rest.
The three Democratic congressmen —
George Miller of California, Thomas Ha-r
-kin of lowa and Toby Moffet of Connec
ticut — said on their return to the U.S. in
March that they had collected proof of
continued arbitrary arrests without
charges, torture and assassination.of op
ponents of the military junta. They are

working to build support in Congress for
total elimination of military aid to Chile
and a review of all programs of economic
assistance.
Attack on church
Meanwhile a sharp attack on the pre
sent church hierarchy is being pressed by
an extreme rightwing political-religious
lay group called the Chilean Society for
the Defense of Tradition, Family and
Property (FIDUCIA).
Believed by many in the church hierar
chy to be working at the command of the
junta, FIDUCIA has published a 500-page
book, The Silent Church in Chile, charg
ing Cardinal Silva and the church hierar
chy with betraying Christian principles
and "paving the way for a Marxist return
to power."
The book says the church is "currently
serving as the spearhead for the extreme
left's program of overthrowing the junta
and establishing a communist dictator
ship in its place."
The, church, the only remaining or
ganized and powerful source of opposi
tion to the junta, has been publicly critical
since September 1974, when church offi
cials refused to send a representative to
the celebration of the regime's first an
niversary.
At that time an official spokesman for
Cardinal Silva explained that the
church's criticism was based on three
points: "the violation of human rights
and liberties, the present economic
policies and the educational plan.
"We will never tire in exposing and

denouncing the cruel punishment and
torture of political prisoners," he said.
"We oppose the economic policies of
the junta which make the poorest classes
bear the brunt of the present crisis. And
finally, we object to the militarization of
the educational system . . . from the
grammar school level up to the univer
sities."
While The Silent Church in Chile is
being widely distributed throughout San
tiago, sometimes free of charge, gigantic
signs have begun to appear across major
thoroughfares calling on Catholics to "re
sist" the church hierarchy.
Many in the church see the FIDUCIA
effort as a final attempt by the junta to
divide the Catholics and stifle their criti
cism of the retime. They point out that the
huge signs have appeared in spots previ
ously occupied by government prop
aganda and that the third edition of the
new book was ordered printed in the Uni
versity of Chile's shop by its new
government-designated rector.
One Catholic parish leader in
downtown Santiago said, "FIDUCIA is a
front group for the government. It has no
mass following. Its only members are
former organizers of the Fatherland and
Freedom Party"—an openly fascist group
that actively opposed the former Allende
government.
Another, a Catholic relief organization
worker, asked, "What better proof is there
that the government's hand is behind
FIDUCIA when it allows this slanderous
book to circulate but has banned some

thing as innocuous as The Call of the
Wild on the grounds that it was anti-
Christian?"
So far the church has formally attacked
only FIDUCIA. Both Cardinal Silva and
the Hope's representative in Chile have
condemned the book, while the high
level Bishop's Permanent Committee is
sued a statement which, according to
canon lawyers, may be the beginning of
an excommunication process against
those involved in its writing, editing and
distribution.
If the FIDUCIA book is proven a junta
project, however, this move toward ex
communication could lead to a final
showdown between church and state.
The church is already rumored to be
planning to excommunicate government
functionaries accused of torturing politi
cal prisoners.
