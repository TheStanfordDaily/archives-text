# South Vietnamese refugees have problems adjusting

### 
SAN FRANCISCO (PNS) —
After a full year, the largest
single wave of refugees ever to
hit the United States is still try
ing to find its place in America.
Most of the 130,000 Viet
namese who frantically left their
own shores in April 1975 are still
living in virtual isolation here.
Of all Vietnamese, these re
fugees would seem to be best
able to make the traumatic ad
justment to American life.
Largely from Saigon, most
worked in the military,in profes
sions, or for the U.S. government
or American businesses.
They were more heavily
Catholic than the general popu
lation, and many had abandoned
their homes once before when
they fled from North to South
Vietnam in the mid-19505.
Yet hundreds of personal in
terviews with refugees in
Pennsylvania and San Francisco
draw a picture of more distance
and alienation from this culture
than history records for any pre
vious group of refugees.
They feel cut off despite efforts
by the government, private
groups and independent spon
sors to provide them with funds,
jobs, language training and other
essential services.
The reasons lie in the times
and the nature of their own cul
ture — special problems that re
fugees in past decades from
other countries did not face.
A different America
The huddled humanity which
arrived here from the 19th to
mid-20th centuries came to a
very different America. They set
tled into already existing com
munities of their own
nationalities, with people who
already knew the ropes.
However tough and menial
the work, jobs were usually av
ailable that provided a source of
pride. The new immigrants
could practice their English
daily with the butcher, the
grocer, the iceman and the
postman, and still fall back on
their native tongues in their own
communities.
The Vietnamese, however,
have been slow both to find jobs
that pay well and to learn the
English language.
According to the Department
of Health, Education and Wel
fare (HEW), 80 percent of the

heads of refugee families are
now employed. Yet the percen
tage of refugee families on pub
lic assistance has been rising
since September 1975. As of
mid-March this year, one quarter
were receiving welfare pay
ments.
Even among those who have
found jobs, many pay so mea
gerly that the refugees still qual
ify for some form of public assis
tance. In an October 1975 sur
vey, three-quarters of the 1500
families polled were earning less
than $5000 a year, with an aver
age of over five persons per fam
ily.
HEW and volunteer agencies
have placed top priority on job
placement programs and voca
tional training. But competition
for jobs is especially keen in the
warm-climate states, where most
of the refugees have migrated.
Two fifths of them have settled
into five states, three of which —
California, Florida and
Washington — rank in the top 10
in unemployment. Of the 50,000
refugees who are living in
California, nearly half are receiv
ing welfare.
In Vietman one restaurant
owner liked to quote a
proverb summing up Viet
namese preference for self
employment, even if it means
making less money and working
longer hours.
"It is better to be the head of a
chicken than the tail of an
elephant," he would say.
The Vietnamese stress pros
perity through community or
family-run enterprises rather
than individual success and
status. And they prefer owning
land or working in partnerships
to life as urban wage earners.
One Catholic priest who has
sponsored 600 refugees — an en
tire village of Catholic fishing
people — has tried to help them
start a new cooperative life here.
His vision calls for a self
contained village near Port Ar
thur, Tex., complete with its
own school, medical dispensary
and fish-sauce factory to serve its
inhabitants, who would fish the
waters and grow crops on the
land there.
For other refugees without
such partnership properties,
there is a harder road ahead. But
many have gone to extraordinary

lengths to achieve it. Twenty re
fugees have gone into debt to en
roll in a private electronics
school near San Jose, some work
ing days and studying at night.
After the first two exams, none
had failed and none had drop
ped out, despite language prob
lems.
Language barrier
Communication has been a
major stumbling block in find
ing employment. Despite their
year in the U.S., many Viet
namese still can't use the tele
phone well enough to leave their
names and numbers tu be called
back. Many have not yet learned

the names of streets they live on.
They didn't need to learn En
glish in their first months here in
refugee camps. But even those
who now have jobs and study
English in class often don't prac
tice the new language outside
the classroom.
One big reason, they say, is
their feeling of isolation amid
the hurried, impersonal life of
American cities, where others
show impatience toward their
faltering English and they can
run their daily errands without
speaking to a single soul.
Forced to live in lower rent
areas, the Vietnamese find that

their neighbors are often the
least educated and least able to
help them. Often members of
minority groups themselves,
their neighbors may be compet
ing for the same limited training
programs and jobs.
The Vietnamese, for their part,
do not identify with other minor
ity groups. They see the doors to
success as controlled by the
majority population.
Many refugees complain that
they feel very alone. Americans
lack feelings, they say; they are
cold; they are naive about life.
The refugees seem to have little
confidence in and little wish to
emulate their new countrymen.
Decision to return
It is too early to say whether
most Vietnamese refugees will
eventually decide to return
home.
Their reasons for leaving in
the first place — fear of being
caught in the fighting or in a
bloodbath — no longer seem to
exist. Numerous refugees even
say they had no idea they were
coming to America at all. They
just wanted to go out to sea or to
another part of Vietnam until the
fighting ended.
One 20-year-old unemploy
able recently said, "I lived near
the Khu Dan Sinh market (in
Saigon) on the river. Many
people were getting into boats,
so my friend and I went to see;
we got pushed further and
further onto boats further out in
the river.
"I got separated from my
friend, and I couldn't get back.
We sailed five days, and the next
thing I knew, I was in Singapore.
Then we sailed to Guam. My
family still doesn't know what
happened to me."
Vietnamese have a 4000-year
history of loyalty to their country
and successful defense of its in
dependence. Their sovereignty
as a people and a culture is a
central source of their identity
and pride.
