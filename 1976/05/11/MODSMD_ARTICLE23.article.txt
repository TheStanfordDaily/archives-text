# Capitalist concepts pervade Soviets' arms dealings
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Soviet Union is using some of
capitalism's business practices,
including price cuts, in ped
dling arms to third world coun
tries, Pentagon officials say.
Soviet arms are priced lower
than comparable Western
equipment, and weapons cus
tomers are offered discounts of
nearly 20 percent, these officials
say.
The price factor in U.S. foreign
arms sales arose recently when
Jordanian officials said they may
turn to the Soviets for air defense
weapons because U.S. Hawk an
tiaircraft missiles are too costly.
Earlier, the Iranian govern
ment decided to reduce its
purchase of new destroyers from
the United States, in part be
cause of sharply increased
prices. The Iranians, however,
are unlikely to buy from the
Soviets but may purchase ships
from the British instead, some
officials say.
Pentagon specialists say the
U.S. government is barred by
law from selling arms to foreign
countries at prices less than it
costs the American forces to buy
such equipment for their own
use. Credit sales must be at pre
vailing bank interest rates, these
specialists say.
"Moscow has been willing to
provide military equipment and
training with a minimum of
conditions and on attractive fi
nancial terms," Lt. Gen. H.M.
Fish, the Pentagon's arms sales
chief, told Congress recently.
"We are unaware of a single
Russian turndown of a prospec
tive arms client."
Fish said the list price of Rus
sian weapons "appears to be

based primarily on Soviet esti
mates of what the market will
bear."
According to Pentagon
specialists, the degree of Soviet
price discounting probably is
determined by a customer na
tion's ability to pay, as well as by
political considerations.
They say the Russians usually
extend arms sales c-edits at
about two percent interest with
payments stretched over eight to
10 years. »
Despite Russia's growth t£
second place behind the United
States in arms sales, officials say
there have been some minuses
for the Soviet Union.
One of these minuses, officials
report, involves complaints from
such customer nations as India .
about the quality of some of the '
aircraft and weapons they re-!
ceive and about a lack of spare
parts and technical follow-up
after these sales are completed.
As a result, officials say, some
countries that in the past have
welcomed Soviet arms are now
turning to Western nations such
as France and Britain.
