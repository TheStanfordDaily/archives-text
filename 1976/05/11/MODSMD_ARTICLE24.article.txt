## Blues and boogie hit campus Top-notch blues shows at Tresidder 
### Stacy Geiken 
A small group of people wit
nessed some of the finest blues
in the Bay Area in Tresidder's
large lounge last Monday night.
The Gary Smith Band headlined
what surprisingly turned out to
be an all star gathering of local
blues masters. 1 say "surpris
ingly" because no less than three
blues musicians showed up un
expectedly to watch and eventu
ally jam with the scheduled per
fomers.
The Gary Smith Band opened
the first set with a tight version
of a tune entitled, "Ghicken
Shack." After the first few bars it
became apparent that the Gary
Smith Band was not an average
Bay Area band. Gary Smith's
tasteful harmonica solos were
backed up by his thoroughly
professional five piece band
which included; the tight sax
duo of Ken Baker on alto and
Brad Johnson on tenor, playing
rhythm and biting lead guitar
was Mike Mangello, on the bass
was a man who has been with the
band since its inception five
years ago, Steve Gomes and on
drums, Harold Banks.
Gary dedicated the second
song of the set, "Killing Floor"
to, . . the late, great Chester
Barnett, otherwise known as
'The Wolf' (Howlin' Wolf)."
After "Killing Floor," Gary de
dicated the next tune, "Blues
With a Feeling," to "My main
influence on the harp, Little
Walter." He showed what an in
fluence Little Walter is by dis
playing a large tattoo on his right
forearm that read, "Blues With a
Feeling, Little Walter."
Then Gary introduced what
ws to be the first of three sur
prises. A "former alumnus"
from the old Gary Smith Band,
Jim Gordon, just happened to be
in the audience. Gordon con
sented to play piano with the
band for the next few tunes. Gor
don's distinct blues piano style
enhanced the already fine back

up on "Eyesight to the Blind"
(by Sonny Boy Williamson 11,
widely know for the Who's ver
sion in the rock opera. Tommy)
and "Going Down Slow."
Gary Smith and his band
finished the set with "Killing My
Love," which contained backup
vocals by Ken Baker and Harold
Banks.
Texas
Smith opened the next set by
introducing the second surprise
of the evening, Floyd Dixon.
Dixon had just flown back from a
concert at the University of
Chicago and he consented to
play a few numbers for the ap
preciative crowd. Dixon pro
ceeded to delight the audience
with his Texas based rhythm and
blues style piano. He played
such classics as "Kansas City,"
"What I say?" and "Stormy
Monday."
Sonny Rhodes opened the
next set on lead guitar and voc
als. Rhodes was backed by the
Gary Smith Band in a set which
featured his own tunes. Rhodes'

clear, mellow vocals coupled
with his original lyrics ("You
know a woman is like a highway/
She's got soft shoulders and
dangerous curves.") made for a
highly enjoyable set.
Hightide Harris capped off the
final set with his hard driving
guitar and vocals and the intro
duction of yet another surprise
guest. After playing several high
energy solos, Hightide smiled
showing his shiny gold capped
teeth and said, "I got a friend I'd
like you to meet. He and I go way
back. I'd like you to welcome,
Baby Dave."
Baby Dave stepped up and
plugged his guitar into an old
hand made amp. Hightide called
the next song a "guitar get
down," which included solos by
Baby Dave, Gary Smith's Mike
Mangello and Hightide.
Standing ovation
The "guitar get 'down"
brought the crowd to its feet.
Hightide obliged by getting
everybody together on the last
tune which was called, "Wee

Baby Blues." "Wee Baby Blues"
ended in another standing ova
tion.
If you missed the concert you
still have two more chances to
catch the Bay Area's finest blues
musicians on this campus.
First, be sure to catch the Dave
Alexander Trio (Dave is the
finest boogie woogie pianist in
the Bay area) with special guest
J.C. Burris (fine harp player,
nephew to the legendary Sonny
Terry) tomorrow. Then Monday,
Charlie Musslew r hite's All-Stais
featuring Luther Tucker, Skip
Rose, Freddy Roulette and
Robert Lowery will perform. All
concerts will be held at the large
lounge on the 2nd floor of Tre
sidder.
The concerts are being given
in conjunction with a class enti
tled, "history of the Blues,"
which is being taught by "Guitar
Player" magazine columnist and
Stanford graduate, Dan Forte.
Fortunately, the public is in
vited to attend these concerts at
the modest price of $2.50.

dicated the next tune, "Blues
With a Feeling," to "My main
influence on the harp, Little
Walter." He showed what an in
fluence Little Walter is by dis
playing a large tattoo on his right
forearm that read, "Blues With a
Feeling, Little Walter."
Then Gary introduced what
ws to be the first of three sur
prises. A "former alumnus"
from the old Gary Smith Band,
Jim Gordon, just happened to be
in the audience. Gordon con
sented to play piano with the
band for the next few tunes. Gor
don's distinct blues piano style
enhanced the already fine back

up on "Eyesight to the Blind"
(by Sonny Boy Williamson 11,
widely know for the Who's ver
sion in the rock opera. Tommy)
and "Going Down Slow."
Gary Smith and his band
finished the set with "Killing My
Love," which contained backup
vocals by Ken Baker and Harold
Banks.
Texas
Smith opened the next set by
introducing the second surprise
of the evening, Floyd Dixon.
Dixon had just flown back from a
concert at the University of
Chicago and he consented to
play a few numbers for the ap
preciative crowd. Dixon pro
ceeded to delight the audience
with his Texas based rhythm and
blues style piano. He played
such classics as "Kansas City,"
"What I say?" and "Stormy
Monday."
Sonny Rhodes opened the
next set on lead guitar and voc
als. Rhodes was backed by the
Gary Smith Band in a set which
featured his own tunes. Rhodes'

clear, mellow vocals coupled
with his original lyrics ("You
know a woman is like a highway/
She's got soft shoulders and
dangerous curves.") made for a
highly enjoyable set.
Hightide Harris capped off the
final set with his hard driving
guitar and vocals and the intro
duction of yet another surprise
guest. After playing several high
energy solos, Hightide smiled
showing his shiny gold capped
teeth and said, "I got a friend I'd
like you to meet. He and I go way
back. I'd like you to welcome,
Baby Dave."
Baby Dave stepped up and
plugged his guitar into an old
hand made amp. Hightide called
the next song a "guitar get
down," which included solos by
Baby Dave, Gary Smith's Mike
Mangello and Hightide.
Standing ovation
The "guitar get 'down"
brought the crowd to its feet.
Hightide obliged by getting
everybody together on the last
tune which was called, "Wee

Baby Blues." "Wee Baby Blues"
ended in another standing ova
tion.
If you missed the concert you
still have two more chances to
catch the Bay Area's finest blues
musicians on this campus.
First, be sure to catch the Dave
Alexander Trio (Dave is the
finest boogie woogie pianist in
the Bay area) with special guest
J.C. Burris (fine harp player,
nephew to the legendary Sonny
Terry) tomorrow. Then Monday,
Charlie Musslew r hite's All-Stais
featuring Luther Tucker, Skip
Rose, Freddy Roulette and
Robert Lowery will perform. All
concerts will be held at the large
lounge on the 2nd floor of Tre
sidder.
The concerts are being given
in conjunction with a class enti
tled, "history of the Blues,"
which is being taught by "Guitar
Player" magazine columnist and
Stanford graduate, Dan Forte.
Fortunately, the public is in
vited to attend these concerts at
the modest price of $2.50.

JAZZ —Dave Alexander is one of San Francisco's most brilliant and creative artists. He is well known
for his passionate yet elegant brand of jazz piano. The Dave Alexander Trio, and J.C Burris, a Fine
harmonica player, will play tomorrow evening at Tresidder.
A small group of people wit
nessed some of the finest blues
in the Bay Area in Tresidder's
large lounge last Monday night.
The Gary Smith Band headlined
what surprisingly turned out to
be an all star gathering of local
blues masters. 1 say "surpris
ingly" because no less than three
blues musicians showed up un
expectedly to watch and eventu
ally jam with the scheduled per
fomers.
The Gary Smith Band opened
the first set with a tight version
of a tune entitled, "Ghicken
Shack." After the first few bars it
became apparent that the Gary
Smith Band was not an average
Bay Area band. Gary Smith's
tasteful harmonica solos were
backed up by his thoroughly
professional five piece band
which included; the tight sax
duo of Ken Baker on alto and
Brad Johnson on tenor, playing
rhythm and biting lead guitar
was Mike Mangello, on the bass
was a man who has been with the
band since its inception five
years ago, Steve Gomes and on
drums, Harold Banks.
Gary dedicated the second
song of the set, "Killing Floor"
to, . . the late, great Chester
Barnett, otherwise known as
'The Wolf' (Howlin' Wolf)."
After "Killing Floor," Gary de
dicated the next tune, "Blues

such classics as "Kansas City,"
"What I say?" and "Stormy
Monday."
Sonny Rhodes opened the
next set on lead guitar and voc
als. Rhodes was backed by the
Gary Smith Band in a set which
featured his own tunes. Rhodes'

clear, mellow vocals coupled
with his original lyrics ("You
know a woman is like a highway/
She's got soft shoulders and
dangerous curves.") made for a
highly enjoyable set.
Hightide Harris capped off the
final set with his hard driving
guitar and vocals and the intro
duction of yet another surprise
guest. After playing several high
energy solos, Hightide smiled
showing his shiny gold capped
teeth and said, "I got a friend I'd
like you to meet. He and I go way
back. I'd like you to welcome,
Baby Dave."
Baby Dave stepped up and
plugged his guitar into an old
hand made amp. Hightide called
the next song a "guitar get
down," which included solos by
Baby Dave, Gary Smith's Mike
Mangello and Hightide.
Standing ovation
The "guitar get 'down"
brought the crowd to its feet.
Hightide obliged by getting
everybody together on the last
tune which was called, "Wee

Baby Blues." "Wee Baby Blues"
ended in another standing ova
tion.
If you missed the concert you
still have two more chances to
catch the Bay Area's finest blues
musicians on this campus.
First, be sure to catch the Dave
Alexander Trio (Dave is the
finest boogie woogie pianist in
the Bay area) with special guest

Terry) tomorrow. Then Monday,
Charlie Musslew r hite's All-Stais
featuring Luther Tucker, Skip
Rose, Freddy Roulette and
Robert Lowery will perform. All
concerts will be held at the large
lounge on the 2nd floor of Tre
sidder.
The concerts are being given
in conjunction with a class enti
tled, "history of the Blues,"
which is being taught by "Guitar
Player" magazine columnist and
Stanford graduate, Dan Forte.
Fortunately, the public is in
vited to attend these concerts at

JAZZ —Dave Alexander is one of San Francisco's most brilliant and creative artists. He is well known
for his passionate yet elegant brand of jazz piano. The Dave Alexander Trio, and J.C Burris, a Fine
harmonica player, will play tomorrow evening at Tresidder.
A small group of people wit
nessed some of the finest blues
in the Bay Area in Tresidder's
large lounge last Monday night.
The Gary Smith Band headlined
what surprisingly turned out to
be an all star gathering of local
blues masters. 1 say "surpris
ingly" because no less than three
blues musicians showed up un
expectedly to watch and eventu
ally jam with the scheduled per
fomers.
The Gary Smith Band opened
the first set with a tight version
of a tune entitled, "Ghicken
Shack." After the first few bars it
became apparent that the Gary
Smith Band was not an average
Bay Area band. Gary Smith's
tasteful harmonica solos were
backed up by his thoroughly
professional five piece band
which included; the tight sax
duo of Ken Baker on alto and
Brad Johnson on tenor, playing
rhythm and biting lead guitar
was Mike Mangello, on the bass
was a man who has been with the
band since its inception five
years ago, Steve Gomes and on
drums, Harold Banks.
Gary dedicated the second
song of the set, "Killing Floor"
to, . . the late, great Chester
Barnett, otherwise known as
'The Wolf' (Howlin' Wolf)."
After "Killing Floor," Gary de
dicated the next tune, "Blues
With a Feeling," to "My main
influence on the harp, Little
Walter." He showed what an in
fluence Little Walter is by dis
playing a large tattoo on his right
forearm that read, "Blues With a
Feeling, Little Walter."
Then Gary introduced what
ws to be the first of three sur
prises. A "former alumnus"
from the old Gary Smith Band,
Jim Gordon, just happened to be
in the audience. Gordon con
sented to play piano with the
band for the next few tunes. Gor
don's distinct blues piano style
enhanced the already fine back

up on "Eyesight to the Blind"
(by Sonny Boy Williamson 11,
widely know for the Who's ver
sion in the rock opera. Tommy)
and "Going Down Slow."
Gary Smith and his band
finished the set with "Killing My
Love," which contained backup
vocals by Ken Baker and Harold
Banks.
Texas
Smith opened the next set by
introducing the second surprise
of the evening, Floyd Dixon.
Dixon had just flown back from a
concert at the University of
Chicago and he consented to
play a few numbers for the ap
preciative crowd. Dixon pro
ceeded to delight the audience
with his Texas based rhythm and
blues style piano. He played
such classics as "Kansas City,"
"What I say?" and "Stormy
Monday."
Sonny Rhodes opened the
next set on lead guitar and voc
als. Rhodes was backed by the
