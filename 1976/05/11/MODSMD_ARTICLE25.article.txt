# Graham Central, Byrd, Blackbyrds to play Maples
## 
### 
It was Graham and his group's special rock/soul
blend of gutsy instrumental sounds and beautiful
four-part harmony lead by the throaty vocals of
Larry Graham which has made Graham Central
Station one of the "hottest," most popular musical
organizations, today, and now in Europe.
Graham Central Station is bringing that distinc
tive "unlimited energy" sound with its unique
mixture of guitar, bass and clavinet to Maples
Pavilion on Saturday night.at 8. Also appearing
will be Donald Byrd and his talented group, the
Blackbyrds.
One of America's most innovative musicians, as
well as a magnetic performer whose hard driving
bass gave Sly and the Family Stone its own dis
tinctive quality, Larry created his unique Graham
Central Station with California's finest musicians
and a sound that is ever evolving — but always
with Larry's unmistakable signature.
"Chocolate," the group's female vocalist, was
singing with her preacher-father in Los Angeles at
age four. She later toured the.U.S. for two years as
one of the Doodletown Pipers, then joined "Hot
Chocolate," a group produced by Larry Graham.
Little Sister
Hershall "Happiness" Kennedy left three years
of college majoring in music to join Little Sister,
playing keyboards and trumpet, then "Hot Choco
late," and finally Graham Central Station,
specializing in clavinet.
Robert "Butch" Sam started playing piano and
organ in church at the age of six. By age 12 he was
directing the choir. He played keyboards with

Billy Preston for two years before joining Graham
Central Station.
Gaylord Birch played drums for several years
with the Pointer Sisters before joining Graham
Central Station.
David "Dynamite" Vega played lead and
rhythm guitar with several groups around the San
Francisco Bay Area, including "Hot Chocolate."
Larry Graham himself has been in show busi
ness since he was five years old, tap-dancing his
way through age eight. Before his teens, he had
learned all keyboards, guitars, drums, harmonica
and bass and later developed a three and one-half
octave vocal range.
Sly
Sly Stone saw Graham and invited him to join
what was to become Sly and the Family Stone. Six
years later, Graham left the "family" and with
some friends formed a group called "Hot Choco
late," which he produced that evolved into
Graham Central Station, with the addition of
Robert Sam and Larry.
In a little more than two years, the sextet from
Oakland, California (spawning grounds for Tower
of Power, Sly and Lenny Williams, among others)
have two hit records behind them ("Can You
Handle It"and "Feel the Need"), several coast
to-coast tours of the United States, three albums
tor Warner Brothers Records (the newest is "Ain't
No Bout A-Doubt It"), and a recent nine-city tour
of Europe with the Warner Brothers Music Show,
capped with an appearance at New York's famed
Radio City Music Hall on their return.
