# For the record...

AMIGOS, Santanci; Capitol
In pre-release publicity for
Santana's latest, Amigos, man
ager Bill Graham gushed that the
music was "back in the streets
and earthy once more. He (San
tana) is playing for the people
again, and put his heart in front
of his head."
From this, one might expect a
return to the raucous rough
edged Latin rock ofSuntana and
Abraxas and an abandonment of
the jazz-propelled space flights
executed so tastefully on albums
like Welcome.
In actuality, Devadip Carlos
Santana has not passed through
the lofty musical worlds of
McLaughlin and Coltrane with
out being permanently influ
enced. His decision to return to
the music of the streets therefore
results, not in a complete revi
sion to his earlier musical style,
but rather in an incredibly appe
aling album of dance rhythms
tempered to velvety smoothness
by jazz influences.
Amigos is much more lush
and lofty than the first Santana
albums. There are wispy female
choruses, an abundant use of
harp string ensemble, and a soft
airy tone in most of Greg
Walker's lead vocals.
Craftsmanship
One feels various musical
styles woven thoughtfully and
with care. "Take Me With You,"
an instrumental, exemplifies
this craftsmanship. From a
somewhat atonal organ prelude,
the piece suddenly explodes
into a feverish Latin beat, then
treats us to jazz from Tom Cos
ter's organ and rock from San
tana. It concludes in a slower,
more soulful guitar solo re
miniscent of Earth, Wind, and
Fire's instrumentals.
Similarly, numbers like
"Dance Sister, Dance" and
"Europa" excite both the mind
and the body. The former is an
irresistable piece of reggae
influenced Latin energy, simple
in construction but exciting in
execution; Santana's guitar
seems to dance sensuously to the
beat. The latter is an instrumen
tal which begins with a lovely
legato passage and builds ex
pertly to a furious and fiery
guitar-picking climax.
The album's weak point is the
abundance of synthesizer
powered disco numbers present,
such as "Let Me" and "Let It
Shine." Though Santana's

musicianship and tasty instru
mental passages make these
songs more palatable than most
of their type, they still fall
prey to the monotonous repeti
tion so characteristic of this
genre.
Generally, however, intelli
gent funk and beautiful instru
mental characterize Amigos.
Santana's own guitar improves
in control and technique with
each album, and his band here is
tight and disciplined. Santana
maybe putting his heart first, but
Amigos is proof that he has not
forgotten his head.
GIVE US A WINK, Sweet,
Capitol
The delicious raunch energy
which characterized last year's
Desolation Boulevard was mar
red only by a conflict in
songwriting abilities between
numbers composed by British
hit-makers Chapman and Chinn
and those written by Sweet
themselves. The former pro
vided a vastly superior medium
for the conveyance of the group's
furious punk-rock potency.
Sweet has since split with the
Chapman-Chinn team al

together, determined to produce
a self-written and -produced
album superior to all past efforts.
This vision of independence has
resulted in Give Us a Wink, an
album best characterized by in
consisteny.
While the group does, in fact,
provide us with a few extraordi
narily tasty moments, the album
as a whole merely reemphasizes
Sweet's inability to produce the
high-energy writing so neces
sary for their musical success.
Hedonistic
Sweet's sound is charac
terized by piercing falsetto har
monies, sweeping synthesizer
openings and transitions,
hedonistic lyrics, and an abun
dance of internal electricity.
These elements combine beauti
fully in the album's opening cut,
"Action," which surpasses even
last year's "Ballroom Blitz" in
sheer exhuberant commitment
to the emotional release so inhe
rent in rock 'n' roll. It is cleverly
and always aggressively de
veloped into a punching musical
statement: "Everybody wants a
piece of the action/Everybody
needs a main attraction."
Although this cut is beauti

fully executed, no other song can
begin to match it, or Desolation
Boulevard's staples: "AC/DC," "I
Want to be Committed." and
"Ballroom Blitz." Most of the
rest of Give Us a Wink is pedest
rian; its energy is bogged down
in ever-repeating bass riffs and
boring instrumental effects, as in
numbers like "Healer," which is
seven and one-quarter minutes
of pure sedation.
Side two picks up a bit, par
ticularly in a refreshing ballad,
"Lady Starlight," and in a quasi
jazz piano solo by Trevor Griffin
(not a member of the four-man
band) on "4th of July." Even the
bst numbers on this side, how
ever, lack the dynamic force of
the Chapman-Chinn composi
tions and are more reminiscent
of last year's less-satisfying "Fox
on the Run."
Sweet has said that it will
never return to doing non
original material, even if this re
sult's in the group's death. I
hope, therefore, that the four
members can somehow improve
the quality of their writing, for it
will be a shame to lose a band
with Sweet's intensity and pas
sion.

BLACK AND BLUE, The Rolling Stones; Rolling
Stones Records
For Stones devotees, there's cause to celebrate
in the release of their new album, Black and Blue.
Harking back to Exile on Mainstreet and It's Only
Rockand Roll, the Stones' newest is a high voltage
album that proves the old boys to be holding their
own. For those disappointed with the rather static
and nostalgic Metamorphosis album. Black and
Blue should restore faith in the Stones' creativity.
It's a consistent, sophisticated album that boasts a
varied and tightly-meshed group of tracks.
Like David Bowie, Jagger makes a concession to
the popular market in his disco-sounding "Hot
Stuff." Although it's the most dismissable cut on
the album, the Stones' disco song gleans interest
from Richards' wah-wah and Jagger's punkish
panting. Similarly motivated by a spirit of fun is
"Cherry Oh Baby," which is raised from the ranks
of half-breed reggae by Nicky Hopkins' cascade of
organ notes.
The Stones are more successful with the full
fledged rock of "Hand of Fate," "Crazy Momma,"
and "Hey Negrita." The first is a toned-down
"Brown Sugar," the second a characteristically
reeling number wherein Jagger yells, and
Richards weaves a many-layered guitar back-up
with help from Jagger, and later, Ron Wood. "Hey
Negrita," the best of the hard rock cuts, offers
Jaggers' devilish chanting and Richards'
punctuated back-up. This is a purgingly-rowdy
song whose insistent beat is just repetitive and

insistent enough to appease the rock and roll sen
sibility.
Indulgent
Yet the enduring tracks from this album may
well be the slower ones. In "Fool to Cry," a
marketable-sounding song, the Stones are
perhaps overly indulgent. Sentamentality eeks
over the airways when this catchy tune is aired;
one has to be a Jagger-lover to appreciate Mick's
sobbing through his poor man's persona, as he did
in "Luxury," that he's a fool. The lyrics sound
more truthful in "Memory Motel,"a soothing bal
lad in which Mick reminisces without becoming
maudlin.
The most interesting cut on this diverse LP is a
non-Stonesque number. "Melody" is a down-beat
blues piece graced by the soulful vocals of Jagger
and Billy Preston. In this muted and well
controlled song, everything cries: the tinkling of
the piano, the brush of the drums, the wailing of
horns emphasize the emotional content of the
singers' minimal lyrics and nonverbal scat sing
ing-
The Stones have done well to put out an album
that offers the fruit of experiment as well as that of
experience. Watts' dependable drum work,
Wood's competent guitar back-up and Wyman's
bass are the building blocks of the Jagger-
Richard's fluency. In addition, the Stones are
aided on Black and Blue by the shining contribu
tions of Nicky Hopkins and Billy Preston. This is
an album for admirers of the Stones, past and
present.
