Carter to meet with Meany
WASHINGTON — Democratic front-runner
Jimmy Carter, maneuvering to close party ranks
behind his presidential candidacy, has arranged a
private meeting with AFL-CIO President George
Meany.
The two men, who talked once on the telephone
but who have never met, will get together Friday in
Meany's office across Lafayette Park from the White
House.
An aide to the 81-year-old labor leader, confirm
ing the arrangements yesterday, said that Carter
"took the initiative" in setting up the session. The
aide said only that the two would "get together and
talk."
"There'll be no photographers, and Meany will
have nothing to suy afterward." said the aide,
AFL-CIO spokesman A 1 Zack.
Meany, who controls the AFL-CIO political ac
tivities, has met with all Democratic presidential
candidates except Alabama Gov. George Wallace.
Meany has said all but Wallace are acceptable to
labor.
Brown supports nuclear regulation
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. is
endorsing legislation that would strictly regulate
nuclear power plant development in California,
chief aide Gray Davis said yesterday.
Hut the legislation does not go as far as Prop. 15,
which critics say would cause a shutdown of nuc
lear generators.
Davis said legislative leaders would be notified
today of Brown's decision.
He said Brown made up his mind after consider
able* study.
The Democratic governor "believes the whole
question of nuclear power should be approached
with caution and great care," Davis said.
Ray's appeal to court rejected
CINCINNATI — James Earl Ray's bid to overturn
his guilty plea in the slaying of civil rights leader
Martin Luther King Jr. was rejected yesterday by the
6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
The court said Ray's contention that he antici
pated a reopening of his case "is at best highly
implausible."
"It is more likely that he simply reasoned that a
shrewd attorney might find a way to overturn his
conviction regardless of the voluntariness of the
plea," the court said in rejecting Ray's appeal for a
new trial.
One of Ray's attorneys, Robert Livingstonn said
he will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the
appeal.
The unanimous decision concluded that U.S.
District Judge Robert Mcßae of Memphis, Tenn.,

was correct in February 1975 when he refused an
appeal after a hearing on the events that led to Ray's
March 10, 1969, guilty plea in Shelby County,
Tenn.
Ray is serving a 99-year prison term.
Military beef purchases investigated
WASHINGTON — A Senate panel investigating
fraud in military meat purchasing heard testimony
yesterday that one meat-packer made up to
$192,000 a day in illegal profits by substituting
tough for tender cuts of beef.
The substitution of knuckle for sirloin-tip butts
was disclosed by Edward Kehl, former supervisor
for the now-defunct G&G Packing Co. of Boston.
Kehl testified that the substitution was never de
tected by young, inexperienced military inspec
tors.
Four present or former military meat inspectors
admitted receiving gifts, bribes and favors, includ
ing the services of prostitutes, for refraining from
nitpicking and not creating disputes at G&G and at
Blue Ribbon Frozen Foods of Hamden, Conn.
Sen. Lawton Chiles (D-Fla.), chairman of the
Government Operations subcommittee on federal
spending practices, said the situation discovered in
the Boston area is not "just one isolated case."
Estimating the "gross fraud" to total millions of
dollars each year, Chiles said subcommittee inves
tigators are continuing their nine-month study
"pursuing allegations of similar activities in Texas,
California, Illinois and elsewhere."
Public hearings, concentrating on the Boston dis
trict of the Army Veterinary Inspection Service,
will continue tomorrow and Thursday, with Army
Secretary Martin Hoffmann and high-ranking
military officers among the witnesses.
Small plane crashed on Bayshore
SAN FRANCISCO — Two men were injured
slightly yesterday as a light plane crashed and
burned on the Bayshore Freeway, narrowly missing
cars and power lines.
"There was normal traffic so it didn't hit any
cars," said a Highway Patrol spokesman. "It would
have hit cars for sure if the crash happened during
commute hours."
The 11 a.m. crash stalled traffic for nearly two
hours in the northbound lanes of the eight-lane
freeway. Traffic was diverted to an offramp while
the fusilage was removed from the roadway.
British party leader resigns
LONDON — Jeremy Thorpe quit yesterday as
leader of Britain's Liberal party after what he called
a "sustained witch hunt" connected with allega
tions he had a homosexual relationship with a male

model.
"No man can effectively lead a party if the greater
part of his time has to be devoted to answering
allegations as they arise and countering continuing
plots and intrigues." Thorpe wrote in a letter to
David Steel, acting chief whip of the party.
The Liberals have 13 members in the 635-
member House of Commons, which is dominated
by the Labor and Conservative parties.
The 46-year-old lawmaker again denied the
charges relating to his association with model
Normal Scott.
Thorpe had also been accused officially of an
error of judgment in taking a non-executive direc
torship in a secondary banking concern that
crashed.
But it was his relationship with Scott that caused
the big uproar, not only in the party but in the
country.
Radioactive waste hazards decline
WASHINGTON — The safe management of
radioactive wastes given off in increased nuclear
energy production is feasible, according to a federal
government report issued yesterday.
The report, prepared by the Energy Resources
Council, also states that radioactive waste volume
is small, when compared with other waste pro
ducts, and that "even substantial costs that could be
required for careful disposal of such wastes will not
have substantial impact on the cost of electricity."
"The means exist for reducting to a very low level
of risk each step in the process," said Commerce
Secretary Elliot Richardson the council's chairman.
"I don't think anyone can say it is reduced to zero,
but... we can say we are dealing with a lower level
of risk than in other areas of energy production."
Richardson testifying before the Joint Atomic
Energy subcommittee on environment and safety,
said that mistakes in dealing with nuclear waste
over the past 10 years have not produced health or
safety problems, "but with the benefit of technol
ogy and experience, we should do even better in the
future."
