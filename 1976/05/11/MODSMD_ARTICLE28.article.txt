Funny water
The funny taste in campus water
yesterday may have been caused by the
University's switching back to its
standard water supply, Utilities Man
ager Robert McKnight said last night.
He cautioned that his explanation
was just a guess and would be verified
this morning.
According to McKnight, the Univer
sity is usually supplied by the San
Francisco water system, which origi
nates at Hetchhetchy in the high Sier
ras. However, after the San Francisco
strike began four weeks ago, the Uni
versity began getting its water from
supplies in Alameda County, which
come from wells, he said.
The water from the San Francisco
system may have been sitting in the
pipes for the past few weeks.
McKnight said.
The Hetchhetchy system was estab
lished around 1900 and supplies ex
tremely soft water to San Francisco via
conduits that are 30 inches or larger in
diameter, he said.
Winter grades
Statistics on winter quarter grade
distribution will not be released until
late this week, according to Registrar
Sally .vlahoney.
A report on winter grades has been
compiled, Mahoney said, but the com
puter program may contain errors.
The Registrar's Office plans to run
the program through again, and
Mahoney said she hopes to have it
ready before Thursday.
Autumn quarter grade data were re
leased the first week of winter quarter.

Correction:
The 27 jobs to be eliminated in the
merger of Stanford and Palo Alto Fire
Departments will come from both de
partments, rather than Stanford's
alone as reported in yesterday's Daily.
According to Plant Services Director
Jason Mavis, responsibility for making
fire dispatches will shift to the com
bined group, but the campus dispatch
ing center itself will not move.
Funny water
The funny taste in campus water
yesterday may have been caused by the
University's switching back to its
standard water supply, Utilities Man
ager Robert McKnight said last night.
He cautioned that his explanation
was just a guess and would be verified
this morning.
According to McKnight, the Univer
sity is usually supplied by the San
Francisco water system, which origi
nates at Hetchhetchy in the high Sier
ras. However, after the San Francisco
strike began four weeks ago, the Uni
versity began getting its water from
supplies in Alameda County, which
come from wells, he said.
The water from the San Francisco
system may have been sitting in the
pipes for the past few weeks.
McKnight said.
The Hetchhetchy system was estab
lished around 1900 and supplies ex
tremely soft water to San Francisco via
conduits that are 30 inches or larger in
diameter, he said.
Winter grades
Statistics on winter quarter grade
distribution will not be released until
late this week, according to Registrar
Sally .vlahoney.
A report on winter grades has been
compiled, Mahoney said, but the com
puter program may contain errors.
The Registrar's Office plans to run
the program through again, and
Mahoney said she hopes to have it
ready before Thursday.
Autumn quarter grade data were re
leased the first week of winter quarter.
