# Med students must draw again
## Clerkships 'maldistributed' 
### Jack Vaughn 
Because of technical errors in the
lottery held last week, students at the
Medical School will have to apply a
second time for third and fourth-year
clerkships at area hospitals, a group of
students, faculty members and ad
ministrators dccided last night.
The clerkships assigned in last Fri
day's draw contained an "acute mal
distribution problem" in which some
students received the maximum
number of clerkships (eight) while
others received only one, according to
medical student William Benitz.
Clerkships, the equivalents of medi
cal courses for upper-division medical
students, are clinical studies in par
ticular areas of medicine. Students
may take up to eight six-week clerk
ships during each year of their upper
division medical training.
The maldistribution, Benitz
explained, resulted from the disap
pearance of 56 surgical positions from
the draw, the assignment of several
students to lower or higher priorities
than those to which they were entitled
and the assignment of all eight of the
first student's choices before moving
on to the next student.
Plan reached
To alleviate the problem, medical
school student leaders and adminis
trators met over the weekend and de
cided on a plan for partially re
enacting the lottery procedure. The
leaders obtained approval of the plan
from a gathering of medical students

in the Medical Center last night.
Students graduating next year who
1) need a clerkship in a specific area to
qualify for residency in their field and
2) must complete a clerkship before
next fall so it will be included in the
medical dean's letter or recommenda
tion, will receive a special (A-plus)
classification in the new draw under
the plan.
These clerkships will be assigned
first, followed by clerkships for stu
dents in their final priority year in
cluding students who received A-plus
classification for one of their clerk
ships.
The A-priority students will receive
one clerkship in the order of the origi
nal draw to retain some of the advan
tage of originally receiving a good
number and will receive remaining
clerkships in several rounds ofrandom
distribution.
Same accommodation
Students not yet in their final year
will be accommodated in the same
way once the A-priority clerkships
have been filled.
Several students at the meeting ob
jected to keeping the original draw's
order for assigning clerkships.
However, a medical student
explained that the student leaders did
not want to make either students who
had done well or those who had done
poorly in the original draw object to
the plan, and so combined the two
draws.
Medical School Assoc. Dean of Stu

dent Affairs William Creger pointed to
long-term problems of finding enough
clerkships for medical students.
"We have to come up with addi
tional clerkship opportunities," Cre
ger said. "There's no method of draw
ing that will make up for a lack of
slots."
