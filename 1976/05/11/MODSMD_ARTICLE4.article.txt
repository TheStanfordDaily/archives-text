# Judge to block SF settlement?

### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A legal
challenge threatens to upset the deli
cate accord that brought an end to the
38-day city workers strike.
Nine citizens have obtained a court
order blocking the Board of Super
visors' removal of two antilabor mea
sures from the June 8 election ballot.
The removal of Props. E and K was part
of a compromise agreement that sent
1800 striking employes back to work
over the weekend and allowed the
strikebound Municipal Railway to re
store bus service.
However, nine citizens, who con
tend the supervisors don't have the au
thority to remove measures from the
ballot, obtained a temporary restrain
ing order Sunday from Superior Court
Judge Robert Drewes.
Vigo Nielsonn, a lawyer represent
ing the group, said, "It is our strong
belief that what the board did was il
legal." If private citizens had gathered
enough signatures to place the mea
sures on the ballot, they would not
have been legally allowed to later
withdraw them, he said.
Propositions
Prop. E, if passed, would require city
officials to fire striking employes.
Prop. K would set a low wage scale for
striking employes. Both measures
were authored by the supervisors.
Quentin Kopp, president of the
board and one of two supervisors to
oppose the removal of the proposi
tions, said the citizen's petition "has
some good basis and logic.
"For example, you can't take a can
didate's name off the ballot under

similar circumstances even if he with
draws it or he dies," said Kopp, who
speculated that both propositions had
a good chance for passage.
Other supervisors defended the
withdrawal, saying it was necessary to
reach a compromise with labor and re
store city services.
Hearing tomorrow
Another hearing on the citizens' pet
ition is scheduled tomorrow. Mean
while, the propositions remain on the
ballots for absentee voting which
began yesterday.
The compromise, reached early
Saturday, called for the .withdrawal of
the propositions, a return to work by
striking employes and an 11-man
factfinding committee to study the
controversial pay cuts which remain
unresolved.
The strike began March 31 when
carpenters.electricians, plumbers and
other trades union members represent
ing about one tenth of the city's 18,000
employes walked off their jobs rather
than accept $5.7 million in pay cuts.
Municipal bus drivers honored the
picket lines, forcing some 250,000
daily riders to find other transporta
tion. Service was restored Saturday
about nine hours after the accord was
reached, and Municipal Railway offi
cials said their fleet was at full strength
for yesterday's commuter rush.
"People out there today are applaud
ing and shouting hooray for the
Muni," said Curtis Green, the system's
general manager. "It's the first time the
equipment was idle for that long, but
everything is running smoothly."

cials said their fleet was at full strength
for yesterday's commuter rush.
"People out there today are applaud
ing and shouting hooray for the
Muni," said Curtis Green, the system's
general manager. "It's the first time the
equipment was idle for that long, but
everything is running smoothly."
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A legal
challenge threatens to upset the deli
cate accord that brought an end to the
38-day city workers strike.
Nine citizens have obtained a court
order blocking the Board of Super
visors' removal of two antilabor mea
sures from the June 8 election ballot.
The removal of Props. E and K was part
of a compromise agreement that sent
1800 striking employes back to work
over the weekend and allowed the
strikebound Municipal Railway to re
store bus service.
However, nine citizens, who con
tend the supervisors don't have the au
thority to remove measures from the
ballot, obtained a temporary restrain
ing order Sunday from Superior Court
Judge Robert Drewes.
Vigo Nielsonn, a lawyer represent
ing the group, said, "It is our strong
belief that what the board did was il
legal." If private citizens had gathered
enough signatures to place the mea
sures on the ballot, they would not
have been legally allowed to later
withdraw them, he said.
Propositions
Prop. E, if passed, would require city
officials to fire striking employes.
Prop. K would set a low wage scale for
striking employes. Both measures
were authored by the supervisors.
Quentin Kopp, president of the
board and one of two supervisors to
oppose the removal of the proposi
tions, said the citizen's petition "has
some good basis and logic.
"For example, you can't take a can
didate's name off the ballot under

similar circumstances even if he with
draws it or he dies," said Kopp, who
speculated that both propositions had
a good chance for passage.
Other supervisors defended the
withdrawal, saying it was necessary to
reach a compromise with labor and re
store city services.
Hearing tomorrow
Another hearing on the citizens' pet
ition is scheduled tomorrow. Mean
while, the propositions remain on the
ballots for absentee voting which
began yesterday.
The compromise, reached early
Saturday, called for the .withdrawal of
the propositions, a return to work by
striking employes and an 11-man
factfinding committee to study the
controversial pay cuts which remain
unresolved.
The strike began March 31 when
carpenters.electricians, plumbers and
other trades union members represent
ing about one tenth of the city's 18,000
employes walked off their jobs rather
than accept $5.7 million in pay cuts.
Municipal bus drivers honored the
picket lines, forcing some 250,000
daily riders to find other transporta
tion. Service was restored Saturday
about nine hours after the accord was
reached, and Municipal Railway offi
cials said their fleet was at full strength
for yesterday's commuter rush.

ing and shouting hooray for the
