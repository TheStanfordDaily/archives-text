# Student Government Interchange to offer 'an outside perspective'
## 
### Lori Matsukawa 
The Council of Presidents (COP), the ASSU Senate and
the Office of Student Activities will host a Student Gov
ernment Interchange here this Friday.
The purpose of the interchange is to bring students from
different schools in California together to discuss the role
and effectiveness of student government and address the
problem of student apathy, according to ASSU Vice Presi
dent Carole Houck.
The Interchange is open to all interested students.
Houck urged all Stanford students, especially those not
currently involved in the student government process
here, to participate and offer an outside perspective of
what student government should be doing for them.
There will be no registration fee. Each participant will
be taken to lunch at a campus dormitory by a Stanford
student.
Registration for visitors begins at 9 a.m. in the Tresidder
Union Reading Room. Copies of each school's constitu
tion will be available to familiarize participants with vari
ous student government structures.
At 9:30 a.m., Vice Provost for Budget and Planning

Raymond Bachetti will give the keynote speech on "The
Individual and Student Governance" in Tresidder room
282.
Participants will then form discussion groups to discuss
how well student government represents student in
terests. The discussions will be led by M. Scott Smith, a
junior communication major.
After lunch, a second discussion group will be led by
ASSU Sen. Bill Washburn on "Legislative Effectiveness."
The Interchange will end at approximately 3:15 p.m.
with a panel presentation by ex-ASSU officers.
Organizers estimate that six or seven schools will par
ticipate, including UC-Berkeley, USC, Fresno State. San
Jose State and Occidental College.
Thomas Massey, assistant dean of student affairs, has
suggested that some discussion center around the student
activism of the '60s and the lessons they offer students
today on mobilization around important issues.
"Although there is no Vietnam War to rally about, there
is the issue of the quality of education at Stanford," said
one organizer. "That's what student government should
be concerned with."
