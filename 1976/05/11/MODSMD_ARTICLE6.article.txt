# CHaS: A children's hospital kids don't hate
## 
### Mary Ingersoll 
Most kids hate being in the hospi
tal. They know they're sick but no
one tells them with what or why.
Their clothes and personal belong
ings are taken away and they have
to wear ugly backless robes. They
have to stay in bed most of the time.
They get behind in school, their pa
rents leave, they're alone.
But Children's Hospital at Stan
ford (CHaS) is different. Kids like it.
Seventeen-year-old Betten says she
would rather "come here" than any
other hospital, and she has been to
several. Fifteen-year-old Lisa says
it's a "good place" and doesn't want
to leave.
What's so special about CHaS? It
doesn't look like an ordinary hospi
tal. Trees and flowering bushes de
corate the grounds. Inside, floors
are carpeted and walls are deco
rated with children's artwork, not
sickly green paint. It even smells
good.
"It's a place for them to live,"
says Carol Ivy, public relations di
rector. It's not just a place to get
well. Life is so relaxed and
homelike that, to one accustomed to
a more orderly hospital, it seems
like chaos.
But behind this chaos lies a plan:
that each patient live to the fullest
whatever years he has. Each child is
his own master, says Debby
Freeman, a volunteer. And the plan
seems to work.
Gowns missing
Hospital gowns are noticeably
missing. The patients don't dress
like patients — they dress like chil

dren. They wear their own clothes,
because "gowns make them feel
icky," says Director of Recreation
Therapy Michele Bennett.
She says that most hospitals re
quire gowns to make doctor's
examinations easier, but patients
don't like them. "It's crazy to wear
them," she says, so at CHaS they
don't.
Patients have a day full of ac
tivities that would tire the health
iest child. After breakfast they at
tend six hours of classes — at the
hospital. CHaS has its own school,
affiliated with the Palo Alto Unified
School District. Attendance is
mandatory unless the child is defi
nitely too sick to attend. Ivy says
that most children want to go even
if they're feeling particularly ill; it
helps them feel like they're sticking
to a regular routine.
After school, there's therapy —
occupation, recreation, music.
These fill out a child's "work" day
the same way an adult goes to a job.
It also keeps them from wallowing
in "I'm sick" feelings. Therapy may
include making crafts, singing to
guitar accompaniment, or quietly
playing alone. Parents can join in
too.
"Play therapy."or role playing.is
considered important by the staff.
Donna Politi, registered occupa
tional therapist, says it "helps them
deal with fears of the unknown and
vents aggressions."
Children act out the parts of doc
tors, nurses, patients and therapists
to help understand why they're
being poked and prodded and why
it sometimes hurts.

Ivy says that CHaS is unique in
that it is the only hospital in the
country specifically geared for the
care of catastrophically ill children.
And ill they are, with cancer, child
hood arthritis, cystic fibrosis, cere
bral palsy, hemophilia and severe
asthma.
The hospital's facilities are fully
used. There are 60 inpatients and
2500 outpatient visits a month. The
patients, who range in age from in
fancy to early adulthood, come
mainly from northern and central
California, but some are from other
parts of the U.S. and other coun
tries.
At CHaS, the staff says it believes
in helping the child "get on with
the business of living." But first,
fears of the hospital should be al
leviated. Because a child might feel
alone, parents, particularly those of
the cancer patients, are encouraged
to stay at the hospital with the
child. Few other hospitals allow
this.
A philosophy of complete hon
esty shows the child that he is re
spected and considered an intelli
gent human being capable of mak
ing decisions about his own body.
"It's better to be honest, and not
deny their illness," says Margery
Cook, a social worker for patients
with cystic fibrosis. Children are
told what they have, how it is being
treated and their chances of living a
normal life.
Read charts
Some patients may read their
own charts; some may write on
them. If the child might not live, he
knows. He mav refuse treatment. If

he wishes, he may choose to die.
Whatever happens, the staff av
oids pessimism, says Ivy. "We treat
the patient as if he will live a regular
life span as most people do. We try
all we can; a combination of un
usual types and dosages of drugs
that may or may not work, a team
approach so that the patient, his pa
rents and staff are all involved to
gether."
It's the little things that make the

child's stay more comfortable. Pa
rents are taught to give shots and
therapy. They may eat meals with
their child. Everyone participates
in partying. At Easter, Mickey and
Minnie Mouse danced and helped
distribute Easter baskets at a color
ful, noisy gig. A visit by a local rock
group was a big hit with the pa
tients.
Patients may play pool and pin
ball with music blasting in the

background. Special wheel chairs
are made to suit each child's life
style and needs. One boy, with poor
muscle tone because of cerebral
palsy, was teased by neighborhood
kids. The hospital made him a
racing-car "chair" complete with
control panel. Now he's the most
popular kid on the block.
None of this, says the staff, would
be allowed in a "normal" hospital.


PLAYTIME — Many children laugh and play and live
their entire lives at the Children's Hospital ai Stanford

— Daily photo by Linda GossacK
(CHaS). But CHaS is unlike most other children's hos
pitals — the patients like it.
It has its disadvantages. On one oc
casion a doctor was driven so crazy
by all the noise that he yelled at the
kids, then calmed down and com
mented that he "felt better" after
letting go.
The hospital's maverick ap
proach to medical care has evolved
during the past 60 years. Adminis
trator John Williams reports that it
first began in 1917 when the chap
lain of Stanford University and sev
eral faculty wives wanted to pro
vide children from Stanford Lane
Hospital in San Francisco a summer
place to convalesce.
In 1919, it became a "year round,
residential, therapeutic program"
and moved into the home of Uni
versity founders Leland and Jane
Stanford. It became the Stanford
Children's Convalescent Hospital.
Then "convalescent" became a
misnomer. Medical advancements
had made hospital stays shorter so
the hospital had come to emphasize
the care of seriously ill children. In
1970 it became the Children's Hos
pital at Stanford, an independent,
non-profit organization. Today,

Cook says that if a child is "eligi
ble," he is treated regardless of his
parents' ability to pay.
A 'utopia'
The staff calls it a "utopia" com
pared to other hospitals. Children
become so secure that they don't
want to leave. The outside world is
cruel to a child who has lost his hair
or a limb because of cancer treat
ment, whose muscle coordination
is poor, whose face is scarred from
surgery. At the hospital, such con
ditions are common.
The children develop a wry sense
of humor about their conditions.
One day, while on a trip to Mc-
Donald's, a boy pressed the release
button on his prosthetic leg so it
would fall off. He thought it was
funny. The people in the restaurant
didn't.
Patients and staff are often emo
tionally drained in the intense at
mosphere of ailing and dying chil
dren. It's okay for patients to cry or
scream when it hurts. No one insists
that they be brave. Registered Oc
cupational Therapist Ida Lou Coley
says that once a boy who had just
received treatments was so tense,

and in such pain, that she played
basketball with him until he was
exhausted.
Emotionally involved
Many of the staff are young with
no children of their own. They be
come emotionally involved with
patients, as if they were part of the
family, and are just as hurt as pa
rents if the child dies.
The hospital does make mistakes.
Bennett says that "sometimes con
fidentiality and privacy are stepped
upon. We don't have enough space,
and we overdo keeping them busy.
They're often pushed into function
ing. Sometimes they need to be left
alone. They almost have to vomit to
have a day to themselves." And in
fact, it's not unusual for patients to
feign nausea.
But the atmosphere isn't depres
sing. Student volunteer Mary
Frances Edwards says "when you
look at a disfigurement or amputa
tion, you look at the fact that the
child has one leg and can get
around, not that something's mis
sing." The hospital teaches chil
dren that to be sick isn't an ano
maly. They're not alone.

THE ACTIVE LIFE — Patients at CHaS don't lead a life of ficial admitted. But the patients, all children, have the
leisure. "They're often pushed into functioning," one of- final say on all treatments.
