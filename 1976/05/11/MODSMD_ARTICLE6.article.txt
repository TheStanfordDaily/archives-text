# CHaS: A children's hospital kids don't hate
## 
### Mary Ingersoll 
Most kids hate being in the hospi
tal. They know they're sick but no
one tells them with what or why.
Their clothes and personal belong
ings are taken away and they have
to wear ugly backless robes. They
have to stay in bed most of the time.
They get behind in school, their pa
rents leave, they're alone.
But Children's Hospital at Stan
ford (CHaS) is different. Kids like it.
Seventeen-year-old Betten says she
would rather "come here" than any
other hospital, and she has been to
several. Fifteen-year-old Lisa says
it's a "good place" and doesn't want
to leave.
What's so special about CHaS? It
doesn't look like an ordinary hospi
tal. Trees and flowering bushes de
corate the grounds. Inside, floors
are carpeted and walls are deco
rated with children's artwork, not
sickly green paint. It even smells
good.
"It's a place for them to live,"
says Carol Ivy, public relations di
rector. It's not just a place to get
well. Life is so relaxed and
homelike that, to one accustomed to
a more orderly hospital, it seems
like chaos.
But behind this chaos lies a plan:
that each patient live to the fullest
whatever years he has. Each child is
his own master, says Debby
Freeman, a volunteer. And the plan
seems to work.
Gowns missing
Hospital gowns are noticeably
missing. The patients don't dress
like patients — they dress like chil

dren. They wear their own clothes,
because "gowns make them feel
icky," says Director of Recreation
Therapy Michele Bennett.
She says that most hospitals re
quire gowns to make doctor's
examinations easier, but patients
don't like them. "It's crazy to wear
them," she says, so at CHaS they
don't.
Patients have a day full of ac
tivities that would tire the health
iest child. After breakfast they at
tend six hours of classes — at the
hospital. CHaS has its own school,
affiliated with the Palo Alto Unified
School District. Attendance is
mandatory unless the child is defi
nitely too sick to attend. Ivy says
that most children want to go even
if they're feeling particularly ill; it
helps them feel like they're sticking
to a regular routine.
After school, there's therapy —
occupation, recreation, music.
These fill out a child's "work" day
the same way an adult goes to a job.
It also keeps them from wallowing
in "I'm sick" feelings. Therapy may
include making crafts, singing to
guitar accompaniment, or quietly
playing alone. Parents can join in
too.
"Play therapy."or role playing.is
considered important by the staff.
Donna Politi, registered occupa
tional therapist, says it "helps them
deal with fears of the unknown and
vents aggressions."
Children act out the parts of doc
tors, nurses, patients and therapists
to help understand why they're
being poked and prodded and why
it sometimes hurts.

Ivy says that CHaS is unique in
that it is the only hospital in the
country specifically geared for the
care of catastrophically ill children.
And ill they are, with cancer, child
hood arthritis, cystic fibrosis, cere
bral palsy, hemophilia and severe
asthma.
The hospital's facilities are fully
used. There are 60 inpatients and
2500 outpatient visits a month. The
patients, who range in age from in
fancy to early adulthood, come
mainly from northern and central
California, but some are from other
parts of the U.S. and other coun
tries.
At CHaS, the staff says it believes
in helping the child "get on with
the business of living." But first,
fears of the hospital should be al
leviated. Because a child might feel
alone, parents, particularly those of
the cancer patients, are encouraged
to stay at the hospital with the
child. Few other hospitals allow
this.
A philosophy of complete hon
esty shows the child that he is re
spected and considered an intelli
gent human being capable of mak
ing decisions about his own body.
"It's better to be honest, and not
deny their illness," says Margery
Cook, a social worker for patients
with cystic fibrosis. Children are
told what they have, how it is being
treated and their chances of living a
normal life.
Read charts
Some patients may read their
own charts; some may write on
them. If the child might not live, he
knows. He mav refuse treatment. If

he wishes, he may choose to die.
Whatever happens, the staff av
oids pessimism, says Ivy. "We treat
the patient as if he will live a regular
life span as most people do. We try
all we can; a combination of un
usual types and dosages of drugs
that may or may not work, a team
approach so that the patient, his pa
rents and staff are all involved to
gether."
It's the little things that make the

child's stay more comfortable. Pa
rents are taught to give shots and
therapy. They may eat meals with
their child. Everyone participates
in partying. At Easter, Mickey and
Minnie Mouse danced and helped
distribute Easter baskets at a color
ful, noisy gig. A visit by a local rock
group was a big hit with the pa
tients.
Patients may play pool and pin
ball with music blasting in the

background. Special wheel chairs
are made to suit each child's life
style and needs. One boy, with poor
muscle tone because of cerebral
palsy, was teased by neighborhood
kids. The hospital made him a
racing-car "chair" complete with
control panel. Now he's the most
popular kid on the block.
None of this, says the staff, would
be allowed in a "normal" hospital.
