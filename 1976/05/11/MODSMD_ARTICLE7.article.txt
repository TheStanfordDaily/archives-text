On April 30 State Senator Al Alquist said he
would "lead an intensive five-week Northern
California campaign to defeat Prop. 15, the Nuc
lear (Safeguards) Initiative." He made several
blatantly false statements, among them his asser
tion that passage of Prop. 15 could "possibly dou
ble unemployment in California and adversely
affect the state's'environmental, social and
economic future."
It is absolutely untrue that passage of Prop. 15
would adversely affect California's environmen
tal future. The sole purpose of the Nuclear
Safeguards Initiative is to assure that California's
nuclear plants are safe, that wastes will be stored
properly, and that the public will be fully com
pensated in the event of a reactor accident.
It is equally false that passage of Prop. 15 will
increase unemployment.
Common sense tells us that energy and
machines replace workers. The energy industry
and energy-intensive industries are not job
intensive but capital-intensive.
In 1971 the energy industry accounted for only
three percent of total employment; the five most
energy-intensive industries for accounted for 7.3
percent. From 1950-1971 total employment in the

United States increased 41 percent (gasoline ser
vice station employment accounting for most of
this), while total employment in the five most
energy-intensive industries remained constant.
Clearly, we cannot look to such industries to
help solve our unemployment problem.
In a recent paper, "Conservation and peak
power — cost and demand," Prof. A. Rosenfeld
and D. Goldstein of UC-Berkeley show that a
dollar spent on electricity produces fewer jobs
than almost any other investment. Por example, a
dollar spent in improving the energy-efficiency of
an applicance produces about twice as many jobs
as the same dollar spent on extra electricity to
operate an inefficient one.
That is, efficient energy use and economy of
operation can produce more jobs and save energy.
Alquist does not seem to be interested in either
safety, energy efficiency or jobs for California
workers — except those workers in the General
Electric Corporation (part of the nuclear industry)
in his own senatorial district. It is irresponsible of
him to promote his own political future by risking
the future of all Californians.
