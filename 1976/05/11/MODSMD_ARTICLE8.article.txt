# Recent tenure denials

Inflation-induced budgetary cutbacks, coupled
with increasingly scarce employment oppor
tunities for college graduates, have served to
erode the mystique which once enveloped high
education. The line of distinction between a trade
school and a university is fast fading.
This is not to say that higher education has not
always prepared young minds to work for (or
placidly accept) big business. Rather such prep
aration has, especially during the late sixties, at
least some non-obvious aspects.
The brief spate of widespread dissatisfaction
with the content of education which emerged
jointly with the stirrings of a social critique gave
some minimal credibility to the "free marketplace
ot ideas" metaphor, as well as prompting a
reexamination of the role of the educator in the
educational process. Though increasingly silent
on the issue, the Stanford community once de
bated such topics as whether a professor should
encourage students to question the rationality of
our social system at all levels or whether the
proper task of the academician was to provide

answers to largely irrelevant questions while con
centrating on the more important task of publish
ing a path to tenure.
Stanford's response to such queries has been
semi-quarterly denials of the demise of the liberal
arts.
The final aspect of the ongoing mystification of
the educational process is evident in recent deci
sions on faculty members well-recognised for
their superior teaching abilities. The latest name
in what threatens to be a never-ending list of
educators sacrificed to the demon "Research" is
Economics Assoc. Prof. Duncan Foley.
My intellectual and personal contact with Foley
has been the highpoint of my undergraduate
career at Stanford. My tuition dollars could at
least provide access to an education.
Unless students organize to gain a voice in te
nure decisions, they will not fare nearly so well.
To see Stanford as a high status trade school is not
to deny it a potential for being the site of a genuine
educational process.
