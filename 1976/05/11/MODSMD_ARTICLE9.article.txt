# More representation needed
##

The form of electoral politics,
neo-populism, can only lead to a
breakdown of the representative
structure. Instead of electing a
politician on the basis of his
program, citizens can only vote
on the basis ofa candidate's per
sonality, his charisma, and, even
it seems, his smile.
The solution to the rise of
neo-populism is to diversify the
politically representative groups
in order that they might properly
represent the interests of people.
The present two major parties
cannot possibly reflect the
specific interests of all the
groups in this country.
Unfortunately, the present re
sponse of many of the disinher
ited groups has been to support
Jimmy Carter in the mistaken be
lief that his program will cer
tainly support them. Such was
the experience of the Ceorgia
rascists who backed Carter's bid
for the Georgia statehouse.
After the election he took a

strong stand against seg
regationist policies in his home
state. Should anyone be tempted
to vote for him because of this
change of policy, he should bear
in mind that Carter's change of
heart was dictated more by
pragmatism than ideology.
Likely to change
And Carter would be equally
likely to change stands in the fu
ture should the change prove
politically feasible.
Carter is not himself a danger.
Continued lack of effective rep
resentation for the various
groups presently underrepre
sented is the real danger.
As long as this problem re
mains, neo-populists of Carter's
genre will continue to plaguethe
American political system.
On May 7 in Dearborn, Michi
gan, two leading figures in the
automotive industry, United
Auto Workers (UAW) President
Leonard Woodcock and Ford
Chairman Henry Ford 11, praised

Carter in his candidacy for the
Democratic presidential nomi
nation.
Speaking for the UAW Wood
cock officially endorsed Carter.
Further, Ford approved the Car
ter nomination, saying that Car
ter "deserves" to be the Democ
ratic nominee.
Tacit approval
Thus, Carter has received at
least tacit approval from rep
resentatives of two very econom
ically diverse elements of soci
ety. As Carter refuses to be iden
tified as either a liberal, a moder
ate or a conservative, and as he
derives support from such
economically antagonistic ele
ments, one must surely question
the bases of Carter's support.
As Hannah Arendt wrote:
"Democratic freedoms may be
based on equality of all citizens
before the law; yet they acquire
their meaning and function or
ganically only when the citizens
belong to and are represented by
groups, or form social and polit
ical hierarchy."
The rise of Carter shows a de
cline in the representative struc
ture of American government.
The Democratic and Republican
parties can no longer maintain
their many constituents within
the framework of a consistent
ideology.
However, Carter is able to pro
vide an "alternative" to the pre
sent leadershipby appealing not
on the issues but on "believabil
ity." Unable to reconcile the in
terests of his constituency, he
runs on his personal appeal.
