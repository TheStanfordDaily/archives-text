ATTENTION:
SENIOR RND ORRD
STUDENTS
Ever thought about becoming a Peace Corps Volunteer? No
question, Peace Corps positions overseas are a lot different from
traditional first jobs out of college. There are long hours, low pay
and a certain amount of frustration.
But being a Peace Corps Volunteer apparently offers some
rewards. At least, most of the 65,000 Americans who have served
since 1961 seem to think so.
And Stanford grad students and seniors who will have a degree by
June can get first hand information on current Peace Corps
opportunities easily. >
Peace Corps recruiters from San Francisco will be on campus next
Monday thru Wednesday, May 17-19. They'll be headquartered at
the Career Planning and Placement Office, from 8:45 a.m. to 4:45
p.m. daily. Although you don't have to sign up in advance to talk
I with the recruiters, your chances for a better, more comprehensive
interview are enhanced if you do. The sign-up sheets are available
at the Career Planning and Placement Center now.
