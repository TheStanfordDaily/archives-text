# Galbraith evaluates economics

Harvard Economics Prof. John Ken
neth Galbraith advocated "direct in
tervention on wages and prices" as a
solution to our nation's economic
troubles in a speech at Cubberley Au
ditorium last night.
Galbraith advised his audience of
some 800 persons to get comfortable,
because they would be "very much
older as well as very much wiser" fol
lowing his talk.
Refuting the notion that economics
is a stable, static science, Galbraith
contended that "change is constant
and very rapid. Obsolescence in
economic knowledge is very high."
Four major factors have influenced
change in the economic state, accord
ing to Galbraith. These factors include
the growth of the modern corporation,
the growth of large Unions as an "off
setting power" to the corporations, a
change of consumption claims and a
transition in the nature and scale of the
state.
'Bimodai tendency'
A "bimodai tendency" characterizes
a modern corporate structure, Gal
braith said. "Aggregate production is
at two poles." It is "roughly equally
divided between a couple of thousand
corporations and 12 million small en
trepreneurs," Galbraith continued.
The result is a "concentration in in
stitutional economic power and a dif
fusion of personal economic power,"
he said. Large corporations have
bypassed the market, claiming discre
tion over prices, costs, production
schedules and consumer preferences,
he explained.
A "technostructure" has allowed
the diffusion of personal economic
power, said Galbraith, noting that
power has moved to the management
of the corporation, and then down to
specialists.
"The most rewarding feature of the
modern industrial structure," said
Galbraith, is "the development of large
numbers of people with claims to au
thority in the community."
Benefits
The large flow of trained and
specialized personnel into the
technostructure has "greatly en
hanced educational standards and sus
tained the intellectual and cultural
community," he commented.
Changes in "the class structure of
consumption," as described by Gal
braith, have made "income a poor
index of consumption. There are no
"intrinsic class lines of consumption,"
he said. A blue collar worker may
consume much as a white collar
worker, he explained.
Analyzing the inflation employ
ment crisis in light of "pressure for
income to sustain consumption," Gal
braith said this pressure "is dealt with
hv modern corporations by increasing
the price" to reduce demand.
In the modern economy Galbraith
said he believes there must be a
