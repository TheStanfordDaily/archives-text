# Faculty selected on merit, need

Two recent events suggest that a restate
ment of the University's basic policies and
objectives with respect to faculty appoint
ments and promotions is in order. I have in
mind the article in the April 15 Daily entitled
"Under the Tenure Gun," and the letter
from Richard Thomas to me requesting a
policy statement that Stanford will not dis
criminate in faculty and academic staff
employment actions on the basis of sexual
orientation. This is not in reply to these
specifically, but rather addresses some
basic questions that were raised by them.
Stanford's "Statement on Academic
Freedom" declares that faculty personnel
actions "shall be made without regard to a
person's political, social, or other respon
sibilities (and) without regard to the con
duct of a person . . . unless such conduct is
directly related to academic values or to the
assumption of academic responsibilities."
In transmitting the statement to the Board
of Trustees, Richard Lyman emphasized
that, "The University's processes of search
and evaluation are designed to produce the
best possible persons for membership on
the faculty."
The University's objective is to find, ap
point and promote the best faculty available
for our programs in teaching, research and
scholarship. Our policies wisely do not at
tempt to list all of the possible views and
kinds of conduct that would be improper to
consider in our evaluation processes.
Such an approach would be both difficult
and dangerous, for exclusion from the list
can be argued to give sanction to the use of
the excluded item. Rather, they impose a
test, namely that views and conduct of any
kind may be properly considered only if
they are directly related to academic values
and academic responsibilities.
Succession of steps
'The process of making academic and
program judgments involves a succession
of steps; evaluation by the department, the
dean, the provost and the advisory board.
The process is one of winnowing by means
of which successive reviews are aimed at
providing, in the aggregate, the very best
judgments that are humanly possible.
The original academic judgment is made
by the department. The evidence is re
viewed at higher levels to see that the judg
ments flow reasonably from the evidence.

Sometimes additional questions are asked
or referees consulted during the review pro
cess.
From extensive personal involvement
with this process I can state categorically
that "rewards" are not forthcoming nor are
"punishments" meted out on the basis of
political or other factors unrelated to
academic merit and program. This would
not only be against policy but would run
counter to the strongly held personal views
of those making the judgments.
The nature of the process of finding and
keeping the best persons suggests that a de
finitive negative judgment anywhere in the
chain of reviews should have a strong pre
sumption of finality.
At the same time, it is incumbent upon
the reviewer to be prepared to state the
reasons for the decision and to defend them
on appeal or in the grievance process
should that be necessary. It also is worth
pointing out that each reviewer but the last
must describe and defend positive judg
ments to the next higher level in the chain.
The existence of grievance machinery
generates an essential difference between a
system of informed judgment, however
rigorous, and one that deserves the alleged
label of "blackballing." Blackballing oper
ates without stated reasons and with no
possible recourse. We would not tolerate
such a system here, and we do not have it.
Merit and need
Faculty employment actions here are
based on academic merit and program need.
Other factors are irrelevant. The list of such
factors need not be cataloged. The Universi
ty's written policies reaffirm certain non
discriminary postures required by law (e.g.,
ethnic origin and sex), but the list is not
intended to be, nor is it, exhaustive.
Denial of a promotion or other considera
ton on the basis of any "view not directly
related to academic values or to the assump
tion of academic responsibility" constitutes
grounds for a grievance. No further state
ment is necessary. Indeed, adding many
more factors to the list of "non
discriminatory items" only would weaken
the fundamental standard of judgments
made purely on academic grounds.
There is no doubt that human costs are
associated with a system, such as the Uni-

versity's, which seeks to find and keep the
very best. These problems are increased
when the opportunities for tenure are con
stricted. We must be alert to and under
standing of these problems, and do every
thing we can to minimize them and mitigate
their effects. For example, periodic meet
ings between junior faculty and department
or division heads may reduce anxiety and
demonstrate the genuine concern that
senior colleagues clearly feel. Forthright
communication is not a panacea, but it
helps.
Unwarranted charges
There have been a few charges that politi
cal , personal and other factors already have
eroded the University's intellectual stan
dards. 1 am convinced that these charges are
unwarranted but, if true, they would be
serious indeed. If the University commun
ity loses confidence in the process of
academic judgment the maintenance of in
tellectual trusteeship wold be very difficult.
I do not believe this has happened or even
is close to happening.
Most people recognize that judgments
made in good faith can and do differ, and
know that disappointment can produce
dissonance-reducing attitudes. The faculty
grievance procedure is crucial because both
the judged and the judges in the regular
evaluation process know that review is pos
sible — in fact it is likely if there is any real
evidence of influence by factors unrelated
to academic criteria.
The University's policy and the objec
tives of those who participate in the faculty
appointment and promotion process should
be vigoious and fair to all concerned. It is
important for this to be widely understood,
and for challenges to be directed through
the grievance procedure where a reasoned
assessment of all the evidence can be made.
It also is important for those in the com
munity who agree that the University's pro
cesses of search and evalution should be
designed to produce the best possible per
sons for membership on the faculty to be
unswerving in their support and to serve as
teachers and examples in the cause of intel
lectual trusteeship as well as in their par
ticular academic disciplines.

point and promote the best faculty available
for our programs in teaching, research and
scholarship. Our policies wisely do not at
tempt to list all of the possible views and
kinds of conduct that would be improper to
consider in our evaluation processes.
Such an approach would be both difficult
and dangerous, for exclusion from the list
can be argued to give sanction to the use of
the excluded item. Rather, they impose a
test, namely that views and conduct of any
kind may be properly considered only if
they are directly related to academic values
and academic responsibilities.
Succession of steps
'The process of making academic and
program judgments involves a succession
of steps; evaluation by the department, the
dean, the provost and the advisory board.
The process is one of winnowing by means
of which successive reviews are aimed at
providing, in the aggregate, the very best
judgments that are humanly possible.
The original academic judgment is made
by the department. The evidence is re
viewed at higher levels to see that the judg
ments flow reasonably from the evidence.

Sometimes additional questions are asked
or referees consulted during the review pro
cess.
From extensive personal involvement
with this process I can state categorically
that "rewards" are not forthcoming nor are
"punishments" meted out on the basis of
political or other factors unrelated to
academic merit and program. This would
not only be against policy but would run
counter to the strongly held personal views
of those making the judgments.
The nature of the process of finding and
keeping the best persons suggests that a de
finitive negative judgment anywhere in the
chain of reviews should have a strong pre
sumption of finality.
At the same time, it is incumbent upon
the reviewer to be prepared to state the
reasons for the decision and to defend them
on appeal or in the grievance process
should that be necessary. It also is worth
pointing out that each reviewer but the last
must describe and defend positive judg
ments to the next higher level in the chain.
The existence of grievance machinery
generates an essential difference between a
system of informed judgment, however
rigorous, and one that deserves the alleged
label of "blackballing." Blackballing oper
ates without stated reasons and with no
possible recourse. We would not tolerate
such a system here, and we do not have it.
Merit and need
Faculty employment actions here are
based on academic merit and program need.
Other factors are irrelevant. The list of such
factors need not be cataloged. The Universi
ty's written policies reaffirm certain non
discriminary postures required by law (e.g.,
ethnic origin and sex), but the list is not
intended to be, nor is it, exhaustive.
Denial of a promotion or other considera
ton on the basis of any "view not directly
related to academic values or to the assump
tion of academic responsibility" constitutes
grounds for a grievance. No further state
ment is necessary. Indeed, adding many
more factors to the list of "non
discriminatory items" only would weaken
the fundamental standard of judgments
made purely on academic grounds.
There is no doubt that human costs are
associated with a system, such as the Uni-

versity's, which seeks to find and keep the
very best. These problems are increased
when the opportunities for tenure are con
stricted. We must be alert to and under
standing of these problems, and do every
thing we can to minimize them and mitigate
their effects. For example, periodic meet
ings between junior faculty and department
or division heads may reduce anxiety and
demonstrate the genuine concern that
senior colleagues clearly feel. Forthright
communication is not a panacea, but it
helps.
Unwarranted charges
There have been a few charges that politi
cal , personal and other factors already have
eroded the University's intellectual stan
dards. 1 am convinced that these charges are
unwarranted but, if true, they would be
serious indeed. If the University commun
ity loses confidence in the process of
academic judgment the maintenance of in
tellectual trusteeship wold be very difficult.
I do not believe this has happened or even
is close to happening.
Most people recognize that judgments
made in good faith can and do differ, and
know that disappointment can produce
dissonance-reducing attitudes. The faculty
grievance procedure is crucial because both
the judged and the judges in the regular
evaluation process know that review is pos
sible — in fact it is likely if there is any real
evidence of influence by factors unrelated
to academic criteria.
The University's policy and the objec
tives of those who participate in the faculty
appointment and promotion process should
be vigoious and fair to all concerned. It is
important for this to be widely understood,
and for challenges to be directed through
the grievance procedure where a reasoned
assessment of all the evidence can be made.
It also is important for those in the com
munity who agree that the University's pro
cesses of search and evalution should be
designed to produce the best possible per
sons for membership on the faculty to be
unswerving in their support and to serve as
teachers and examples in the cause of intel
lectual trusteeship as well as in their par
ticular academic disciplines.

Two recent events suggest that a restate

with this process I can state categorically
that "rewards" are not forthcoming nor are
"punishments" meted out on the basis of
political or other factors unrelated to
academic merit and program. This would
not only be against policy but would run
counter to the strongly held personal views
of those making the judgments.
The nature of the process of finding and
keeping the best persons suggests that a de
finitive negative judgment anywhere in the
chain of reviews should have a strong pre
sumption of finality.
At the same time, it is incumbent upon
the reviewer to be prepared to state the
reasons for the decision and to defend them
on appeal or in the grievance process
should that be necessary. It also is worth
pointing out that each reviewer but the last
must describe and defend positive judg
ments to the next higher level in the chain.
The existence of grievance machinery
generates an essential difference between a
system of informed judgment, however
rigorous, and one that deserves the alleged
label of "blackballing." Blackballing oper
ates without stated reasons and with no
possible recourse. We would not tolerate
such a system here, and we do not have it.
Merit and need
Faculty employment actions here are
based on academic merit and program need.
Other factors are irrelevant. The list of such
factors need not be cataloged. The Universi
ty's written policies reaffirm certain non
discriminary postures required by law (e.g.,
ethnic origin and sex), but the list is not
intended to be, nor is it, exhaustive.
Denial of a promotion or other considera
ton on the basis of any "view not directly
related to academic values or to the assump
tion of academic responsibility" constitutes
grounds for a grievance. No further state
ment is necessary. Indeed, adding many
more factors to the list of "non
discriminatory items" only would weaken
the fundamental standard of judgments
made purely on academic grounds.
There is no doubt that human costs are
associated with a system, such as the Uni-

versity's, which seeks to find and keep the
very best. These problems are increased
when the opportunities for tenure are con
stricted. We must be alert to and under
standing of these problems, and do every
thing we can to minimize them and mitigate
their effects. For example, periodic meet
ings between junior faculty and department
or division heads may reduce anxiety and
demonstrate the genuine concern that
senior colleagues clearly feel. Forthright
communication is not a panacea, but it
helps.
Unwarranted charges
There have been a few charges that politi
cal , personal and other factors already have
eroded the University's intellectual stan
dards. 1 am convinced that these charges are
unwarranted but, if true, they would be
serious indeed. If the University commun
ity loses confidence in the process of
academic judgment the maintenance of in
tellectual trusteeship wold be very difficult.
I do not believe this has happened or even
is close to happening.
Most people recognize that judgments
made in good faith can and do differ, and
know that disappointment can produce
dissonance-reducing attitudes. The faculty
grievance procedure is crucial because both
the judged and the judges in the regular
evaluation process know that review is pos
sible — in fact it is likely if there is any real
evidence of influence by factors unrelated
to academic criteria.
The University's policy and the objec
tives of those who participate in the faculty
appointment and promotion process should
be vigoious and fair to all concerned. It is
important for this to be widely understood,
and for challenges to be directed through
the grievance procedure where a reasoned
assessment of all the evidence can be made.
It also is important for those in the com
munity who agree that the University's pro
cesses of search and evalution should be
designed to produce the best possible per
sons for membership on the faculty to be
unswerving in their support and to serve as
teachers and examples in the cause of intel
lectual trusteeship as well as in their par
ticular academic disciplines.

Two recent events suggest that a restate
ment of the University's basic policies and
objectives with respect to faculty appoint
ments and promotions is in order. I have in
mind the article in the April 15 Daily entitled
"Under the Tenure Gun," and the letter
from Richard Thomas to me requesting a
policy statement that Stanford will not dis
criminate in faculty and academic staff
employment actions on the basis of sexual
orientation. This is not in reply to these
specifically, but rather addresses some
basic questions that were raised by them.
Stanford's "Statement on Academic
Freedom" declares that faculty personnel
actions "shall be made without regard to a
person's political, social, or other respon
sibilities (and) without regard to the con
duct of a person . . . unless such conduct is
directly related to academic values or to the
assumption of academic responsibilities."
In transmitting the statement to the Board
of Trustees, Richard Lyman emphasized
that, "The University's processes of search
and evaluation are designed to produce the
best possible persons for membership on
the faculty."
The University's objective is to find, ap
point and promote the best faculty available
for our programs in teaching, research and
scholarship. Our policies wisely do not at
tempt to list all of the possible views and
kinds of conduct that would be improper to
consider in our evaluation processes.
Such an approach would be both difficult
and dangerous, for exclusion from the list
can be argued to give sanction to the use of
the excluded item. Rather, they impose a
test, namely that views and conduct of any
kind may be properly considered only if
they are directly related to academic values
and academic responsibilities.
Succession of steps
'The process of making academic and
program judgments involves a succession
of steps; evaluation by the department, the
dean, the provost and the advisory board.
The process is one of winnowing by means
of which successive reviews are aimed at
providing, in the aggregate, the very best
judgments that are humanly possible.
The original academic judgment is made
by the department. The evidence is re
viewed at higher levels to see that the judg
ments flow reasonably from the evidence.

Sometimes additional questions are asked
or referees consulted during the review pro
cess.
