# Women eligible for Cap and Gown
## 
### 
Sophomore, junior and senior women are eligible to apply for
membership in Cap and Gown. Interested women should submit a
brief letter about themselves and their involvement at Stanford and
in the community, including any ideas they have for future Cap and
Gown activities.
Letters should be submitted before this Friday to:
Cap and Gown
P.O. Box 4484
Stanford, CA 94305
Membership in Cap and Gown involves active participation,
with past activities including a 1970 focus on Planned Parenthood
volunteer work and last year's sponsorship of women alumni
speakers. Goals and activities are redefined each year to make them
responsive to the new members.
Cap and Gown will be hosting the Stanford Alumni Conference
on May 22 and 23. The annual Cap and Gown luncheon will occur
that weekend so that Cap and Gown alumni from all over the world
can attend.
