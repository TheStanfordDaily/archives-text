# Prop. 15 endorsements cause public confusion

From the Pacific News Service
Both sides in the debate over the June 8 Califor
nia nuclear initiative have enlisted eminent scien
tists to lend their authority and prestige to their
causes.
What the public isn't told is that many of these
scientists, far from being detached observers,
have major stakes of their own in the nuclear
power controversy.
The proponents of nuclear power most often
cite a "Scientists' Statement on Energy Policy"
authored last year by 32 well known scientists, 12
of them Nobel laureates, that received wide
spread exposure in the media. Twenty-six of the
scientists were identified with a major university;
only two with private industry and two as former
directors of Atomic Energy Commission
laboratories. (Two had no institutional affilia
tion.)
"Nuclear power has its critics," the statement
read in part, "but we believe they lack perspective
as to the feasibility of non-nuclear power sources
and the gravity of the fuel crisis. ... If we look at
each possible energy source separately, we can
easily find fault with each of them, and rule out
each one. Clearly, this would mean the end of our
civilization as we know it."
False impression
But according to a study by Charles Schwartz, a
physics professor at the University of California-
Berkeley, the impression that the 25 university
associated scientists were independent from spe
cial interests is a false one.
Schwartz, whose specialty is the social role of
science, presented his findings at legislative hear
ings on the nuclear initiative. Most of the profes
sors signing the statement, he contended, had
significant connections with the atomic

industrial complex.
Of the 26 signers, Schwartz found, nine have
held high-ranking positions within the AEC sys
tem; four have been consultants to major busines
ses — including the nuclear reactor companies
General Electric and General Atomics — and 14
other have been members of the boards of direc
tors of major corporations, including Exxon, IUM,
Research Cottrell, Texas Instruments, URS Sys
tems, Detroit Edison and lowa Electric Light and
Power. All of those companies belong to the
Atomic Industrial Forum — the lobbying organi
zation of the nuclear power industry.
Politically active
The opponents of nuclear power also have eli
cited sympathetic statements from groups of sci
entists — many of whom have long been politi
cally active.
The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS),
"concerned about the impacj of advanced
technology on society," has issued a declaration
on nuclear power signed by about 2300 scien
tists, including two Nobel Prize winners.
"The country must recognize," it reads, "that it
now appears imprudent to move forward with a
rapidly expanding nuclear power plant construc
tion program. . . . The risks of doing so are al
together too great."
Among its signers are MIT physicist Henry
Kendall and MIT economist Daniel Ford, who
have been prominent in a long debate with the
AEC over nuclear safety.
Another group endorsing the California initia
tive, the Los Angeles Federation of Scientists —
which includes Nobel laureate Linus Pau'ing.—
has been active against the Vietnam war and nuc
lear weapons.
