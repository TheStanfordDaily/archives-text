## The
						number of female executives is increasing

"I make money, or I'm counting it.
"I have a total commitment to what I do, and
I'm happiest when I'm in this office creating
more business," says Marilyn LaMarche, vice
president of New York City's Citibank in the
investment division.
LaMarche is one of a small but growing
number of women in management and an even
smaller number of women in senior manage
ment.
Cultivating customers
"I work from 8:30 in the morning to 9:30 at
night. I work six days a week and spend
weekends cultivating new customers," says
LaMarche,who shares with other highly suc
cessful men and women a high level of energy,
dedication and sacrifice.
Her devotion to the bottom line has earned
her the nickname "net net."
According to a recently released U.S. Census
Bureau report on the status of women, the
number of women managers and adminis
trators increased by about 22 percent in recent
years. But there were still about five times as
many men as women in managerial positions.
Much discussion
The whys are much discussed: discrimina
tion by men, complacency of women, lack of
qualified women entering business, lack of
seasoned women already in the management
pipeline.
"Women are not risk-takers and not willing
to give up a lot of social and personal life," says
LaMarche, who gives her age as between 29

and 50. "The things you have to sacrifice are
the things most normal people enjoy.
"Once you become committed to move along
to senior management you give up friends, so
cial life, opportunity to have a family," she
says."It would be terrible to give up those
things, make those sacrifices and only end up
in middle management."
Total commitment
Her total commitment also means the days
between Christmas and New Year's, when bus
iness is almost nil,-are "10 lousy days, depres
sing."
"The top guns in the corporation are really in
favor of women in senior management," she
says, "but there's a certain group of men who
still cannot stomach the aggressive woman."
With some bitterness she notes, "when a
man is aggressive, ambitious and driving, it is
considered a fine thing, but when a woman is,
it is considered unattractive.
"I'm not going to be stomped on or pushed
around," says LaMarche.
"Incubation period"
The president of an executive recruiting firm
in New York says there usually is a 15-to-20-
year "incubation" period in developing an
executive.
"When you ask why we don't have more
women in top positions, the reason is basically
that they were not introduced in sufficient
numbers 20 years ago to enable them to
work up."
Twenty years ago, he notes, the number of
women graduates from business school was

trifling.
John Barch, director of admissions at the
Columbia University School of Business, says
the number of women enrolled has increased
from six percent in 1971 t035 percent this year.
He says women MBAs do at least as well as
men in getting jobs.
"They are venturing into very demanding
jobs and breaking some traditional, if archaic
societal patterns and whether they stay re
mains to be seen," Barch says."It has not yet
been proved that women will be allowed to
ascend to the highest levels in business in
proportion to their numbers."
The National Organization for Women
(NOW) says that discrimination still exists
against women.
Tokenism present
"There is still an enormous amount of to
kenism," says Lynn Darcy, coordinator of
NOW's employment compliance task force.
"Very often, companies will create a totally
irrelevant job, not on any career ladder, put a
woman in that job and call her a manager."
Companies often scrutinize a woman's qual
ifications far more than a man's, she says, ad
ding: " 'Qualified woman' has almost become
one word. But when was the last time you
heard someone ask for a 'qualified white
male'?"
"There is a small cadre of superwomen in
business," says Barry Meyers, head of the Con
sortium, a New York executive recruiting firm.
"But the vast majority are more complacent.
They are not as aggressive as men and they are

not risk-takers.
"Again and again we have to push qualified
women to move ahead."
"I have a love-hate relationship with the bus
iness world," says Faye Whitfield, 25, a black
stockbroker who was recruited and trained by a
major brokerage firm.
"I don't think most women are prepared for
the constant pressure, and 1 think they have a
rough time emotionally dealing in business,"
says Whitfield.
"I was rarely ill," she says, "but now I have
an ulcer." Whitfield believes management pos
itions would be open to her.
"But you have to give so much," she says,
"and it doesn't appear that your male counter
part has to give so much.
'Good career'
"I want a good career," she says, "But I also
want to go home and chit-chat with my hus
band about nothing and fix a nice dinner."
She sometimes has nightmares about her job,
saying: "1 dream that a stock I had a large posi
tion in is falling. And I can't get to the tele
phone to tell my clients to sell.
"Once 1 prove to myself that I do the job as
well or better than the next man, then I can
leave," she says.
Margot Caruso has stuck a balance between
her life as a mother and her life as a market
manager in petroleum processing in New York
for Union Carbide. The job was traditionally
handled by men. Margot, 32, who prefers her
first name in lieu of courtesy titles, describes
her work as exciting and herself as "ambitious,

a perfectionist, a competitor."
"The male managers and I were both chal
lenged, abashed and confused at first," Margot
says, "while nevertheless aiming to ac
complish the same business objectives.
"After a lot of effort was expended on both
si des, the male managers realized that a female
manager, although initially 'foisted* upon
them against their will, could not only 'cut the
mustard' in business but could also add 'pi
quancy' and a spark of excitement to the busi
- riess ambience."
Margot says she is tired of cliches about the
assertive woman and the business world. "If 1
. have something to say, I speak up. I stand my
■ ground if I'm right," she says. "Essentially, I'm
o pen enough to talk, and so are the men 1 work
with.
> "If women can't hold on for the growing
■ pains, maybe they shouldn't be there."
Her work takes her on trips about 40 percent
. cif the time. She frequently works one evening a
■ week and half a day on weekends.
A live-in babysitter helps Margot,who is di
vorced, care for her two children. She still has
s time for music and the theater.
