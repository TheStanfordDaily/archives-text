President Richard Lyman and /ormer President Ray Lyman Wilbur
have unusualJy similar names. Is there any relationship between
the two? -J.B.V.
Not only do the two have similar names, but their initials are
identical, when juggled a bit. The present officeholder's are R.W.L.
("W" for Wall, a family name).
Ray Lyman Wilbur says in the first chapter of his autobiography
that he's descended from the first Richard Lyman who came to this
country in 1631. Unfortunately, the current Lyman doesn't know
whether he is.
"1 can't trace my ancestors back that far," Lyman said. "I don't
think my parents knew anything about that first Richard Lyman,
and I have no idea whether we're related."

Your response to R. W. in the May 7 column was incorrect. Stanford
University is not port of Palo Alto. Virtually all of the University,
including the academic buildings, faculty/staff/student housing
areas, stadium, Arboretum, etc. lies in unincorporated Santa Clara
County outside the Palo Alto city limits. However, Stanford's
commercially developed lands -the Industrial Park, the Shopping
Center,and the Professional Center -as wellas most of the Medical
Center have long been annexed to the city. Hence the physical
development of Stanford academic ureas outside the Med Center is
under the political control of Santa Clara County, while the de
velopment of the commercial/medical center areas is under the
control of Palo Alto. To confuse things still further, a bit of the golf
course, the Stanford Hills subdivision, some land near SLAC and
Auto How on El Caminoare Stanford lands in MenloPark. -A.M.D.
I stand corrected.

Did you know that nonmetered first-class mail that is mailed from
the so-called Stanford post office bears a Palo Alto postmark? Look
in the telephone book. "Stanford University branch" is a subhead
ing under Palo Alto. Postmarks from the prepaid postage meters
mailed by the University will say "Stanford, CA" but this is wrong.
it is a mistake tolerated by the Palo Alto post office. Attached is a
salted and peppered copy of your May column so that eating your
words won't be so unpleasant. -D.B.
Before I take knife and fork in hand, consider this: An employe
at the Palo Alto post office denies your assertion that "Stanford,
CA" is a mistake. He said the reason that mail bears a Palo Alto
postmark is a matter of money. In fact, at one time mail from the
Stanford post office was indeed postmarked "Stanford."
