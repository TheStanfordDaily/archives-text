# Pro-nuclear forces stage spending blitz
## 
### 
From the Pacific News Service
The June 8 California nuclear
initiative, which has focused na
tional and international atten
tion on the state, has been
targeted fora "media blitz" by its
opponents — who may spend up
to $4 million in the effort.
Following an April state Sup
reme Court decision ending
limits on campaign spending, a
consortium of industrial giants
has jumped into the fray to pool
its resources against the mea
sure.
The initiative would give the
state legislature power to decide
whether nuclear plant systems
have been properly tested for
safety and whether radioactive
wastes can be stored without en
vironmental hazard. It also calls
for an end to federal limits on
nuclear liability insurance.
The opposition
Among those opposing the in
itiative are Pacific Gas and Elec
tric Co., Southern California
Edison, Bechtel Corp., General
Atomic Co., General Electric,
Westinghouse, San Diego Gas
and Electric and most of the big
oil companies.
According to San Francisco at
torney Davis Pesonen, a leader in
the campaign to approve the
measure (Proposition 15 on the
primary election ballot), propo
nents will be far outstripped in
spending.
As a result of the state court
campaign spending ruling
(which echoed a similar January
30 U.S. Supreme Court deci
sion), the initiative opponents
"aregoing to spend $3 to $4 mill
ion on a media blitz—a com
plete, overwhelming public rela

tions campaign," Pesonen said.
As much as $3 million of that
"no" money might come from
the Atomic Industrial Forum
(AIF), a national organization of
big corporations in the nuclear
energy business, Pesonen esti
mated. Pesonen said he had seen
an "internal memo" of the AIF to
that effect.
Figures given by the anti
initiative forces were somewhat
lower.
$2 million or under
"I think we'll spend $2 million
or under, and we haven't raised
that yet," said Don Solem,
northern California manager
for the "No on 15" campaign.
"We'll spend what we can raise
— but we don't think we'll raise
beyond, or much beyond, $2
million . . . from all sources."
Solem said there had been dis
cussion of national pro-nuclear
funding through the AIF, "but
that's been dropped. There was
discussion of a national prop
osal, but it was killed."
In any event, both sides con
ceded that the anti-initiative,
pro-nuclear forces have the
money to outspend the other
side by a wide margin.
Financial statements
That estimate was born out by
financial statements filed with
the secretary of state in early
May. Opponents of the initiative
listed contributions totalling
more than $1.5 million — most
of it from corporations. The
highest single contribution was
$70,000 from Westinghouse, fol
lowed at $50,000 each by GE,
PG&E and Bechtel, a worldwide
engineering firm. The state
AFL-CIO Building and Con

struction Trades Council has
given $20,000.
Proponents of Proposition 15,
on the other hand, listed
$561,331 in campaign funds,
none from corporations. Of
10,469 individual contributions,
only 1229 were for $50 or more.
Supporters of the measure in
clude the Committee for Nuclear
Safeguards and Project Survival
— the key groups in the "yes"
campaign — backed by such
conservation organizations as
the Sierra Club and Friends of
the Earth.
According to Pesonen, the
combined environmental
groups will "be lucky" to make
their budget of $800,000.
Court decision
The state Supreme Court rul
ing removing campaign spend
ing limits followed a lawsuit
filed with the high court in De
cember 1975 by Citizens for Jobs
and Energy — the organization
coordinating the anti-initiative
campaign. One of the group's
co-chairmen is former California
Gov. Edmund (Pat) Brown,
father of current Gov. Jerry
Brown.
Under California's State Polit
ical Reform Act of 1974, each
side would have been limited to
campaign expenditures of no
more than $1.2 million.
Attorneys for the opposition
group argued that the spending
limits were unconstitutional and
a "severe and direct infringe
ment" on the right to dissemi
nate political ideas.
The California court agreed,
quoting the U.S. court's similar
conclusion.
In a hearing before the state

Supreme Court, Citizens for Jobs
and Energy had testified that it
wanted to send out at least one
mailing to every registered voter
in the state — and that in itself
would nearly exhaust the origi
nal $1.2 million spending limit.
Backers of the measure got
398,000 valid signatures (they
needed 312,500) on petitions to
qualify the proposition for the
ballot.
Proponents say in effect that
public safety is the overriding
issue in nuclear power, and that
the nuclear program should be
slowed until safety has been de

monstrated beyond a reasonable
doubt.
Opponents, contending that
nuclear power is safe, cheap and
non-polluting, insists that if the
initiative were passed and up
held by the courts it would effec
tively end the use of nuclear
power plants in the state.
If there is one thing the experts
on both sides agree on, it is this:
the California initiative con
troversy is of such importance
that it is being followed closely
by scientists and environmen
talists everywhere.
