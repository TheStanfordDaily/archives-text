WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President Ford yesterday signed a bill
re-establishing the White House Office of Science and Technology
Policy, dismantled three years ago by President Nixon.
Saying that "a strong federal effort in science, engineering and
technology is critical to our future," Ford signed the legislation in
an East Garden ceremony attended by several leading American
scientists and engineers.
"This new office will provide an important source of advice on
the scientific, engineering and technical aspects of issues that
require attention at the highest levels of government," he said.
The office will have a budget of $3 million for fiscal 1977. The
bill also includes $750,000 to support the office between now and
the end of the current fiscal year in June and $500,000 for the
transitional quarter, from July 1 until the new fiscal year begins
Oct. 1.
The President is expected soon to name a director for the office
who also will serve as Ford's science adviser. There will be four
associate directors and a staff of about 15.
The office will advise the President on all aspects of science and
technology, including energy, agriculture, medicine, the economy,
the environment and use of resources. It also will advise the Na
tional Security Council on military research.
