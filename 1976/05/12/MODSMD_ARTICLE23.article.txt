## In Pacific-8 track championships Sandoval, Lofton eye titles 
### Bruce Anderson 
Although the Stanford con
tingent at this weekend's
Pacific-8 Track and Field
Championship is not going to
obstruct the path for either USC
or UCLA in their quests for the
team crown, the Robber Barons
are legitimate threats to take sev
eral of the individual titles.
Payton Jordan's troops are led
into Berkeley's Edwards
Stadium Friday and Saturday by
long jumper James Lofton and
distance runner Tony Sandoval.
Both Lofton and Sandoval
scored in last year's Pac-8 meet,
Lofton placing sixth in the long
jump and Sandoval finishing
second in the six-mile run.
Lofton, a California state prep
champ, was undefeated this year
during the dual meet season.
The sophomore from Los
Angeles has beaten USC's
Gerald Hardemann and UCLA's
Willie Banks, who are ranked

one-two in the league, in meets
earlier this season. Lofton, in
addition to trying to gain the
Pac-8 title, will be seeking to
meet the NCAA qualifying mark
of 25-0.
"To win or place high you're
go/ngto have to jump 25 feet Fri
day, ' Lofton said. He said he
feels he can win the jump "if I
can do the little things, like hit
the board right."
Sandoval returns
Sandoval finished second last
year to Washington State's John
Ngeno in the six-mile. Sandoval
is back this year, and so is
Ngeno. The Kenyan, and fellow
countryman and teammate,
Samson Kimombwa, have the
league's two best times at 10,000
meters (6.21 miles). Should
Sandoval decide to run the 5,000
on Saturday, another WSU Ke
nyan, Joshua Kimento, holds the
conference's best mark at that
distance.

"Historically, I can't afford a
quick pace early," said the
senior from Los Alamos, N.M. "I
have to go out reasonable and
come in hard."
Distance men Jack Bellah, Jeff
Parietti and Roy Kissin will join
Sandoval in Berkeley. Bellah, a
senior from Los Altos, will run
the 3000 meter steeplechase
Friday and the 5000 Saturday.
Bellah owns the third best time
ever (9:06.0) by a Stanford run
ner in the steeplechase. Parietti
is scheduled to double, also,
having been entered in the 5000
and the 1500, Kissin, who re
cently heard that he has been as
signed by Runner's World
magazine to cover the Olympics
in Montreal, is running in the
5000.
In the shorter distances, John
Foster is in both hurdle events,
and Marvin Holmes (100), Alan
Sheats (200) and Scott Wingo
(400) are running in the sprints.

In the 400 intermediate field
with Foster is Tom Andrews of
USC, who two weeks ago turned
in the nation's fastest time (49.4)
this season.
Foster teams up with Holmes,
Sheats and Lofton to form Stan
ford's 400 meter relav auartet.
School record threat
Lofton and Sheats pair up
again in the mile relay, this time
with Wingo and Matt Hogsett.
The four ran a 3:11.0 mile last
Saturday and have a season's
best of 3:10.8. If things mesh
right, they are a definite threat to
break the school record (3:10.5).
Although Lofton is Stanford's
premier field event man, the Ba
rons will also be represented in
the pole vault, weight events and
high jump. Senior Bob Flint,
third on Stanford's list of all
time vaulters, clearing 16-6
Saturday, was the California
junior college champion two
years ago. Flint will have a shot

Friday at becoming the first
Stanford vaulter to ever clear 17
feet.
In the throws, Stanford is rep
resented by freshman Brad Slin
kard in the shot put, sophomore
Mark Hill in the discus and
senior John Macrorie in the jave
lin.
Although this is freshman
Kent Doyle's first Pac-8 champ
ionship, his two appearances at
the California high school track
and field championship give the
young high jumper some needed
experience for this weekend. His
6-8 jump against Cal made him
the sixth best Stanford high
jumper ever.
What's the Stanford strategy
this weekend?
"You can't tell them much
when they are going into a
championship meet such as
this," Jordan said. "We'll just try
to maximize our results both in
dividually and collectively."

have to go out reasonable and
come in hard."
Distance men Jack Bellah, Jeff
Parietti and Roy Kissin will join
Sandoval in Berkeley. Bellah, a
senior from Los Altos, will run
the 3000 meter steeplechase
Friday and the 5000 Saturday.
Bellah owns the third best time
ever (9:06.0) by a Stanford run
ner in the steeplechase. Parietti
is scheduled to double, also,
having been entered in the 5000
and the 1500, Kissin, who re
cently heard that he has been as
signed by Runner's World
magazine to cover the Olympics
in Montreal, is running in the
5000.
In the shorter distances, John
Foster is in both hurdle events,
and Marvin Holmes (100), Alan
Sheats (200) and Scott Wingo
(400) are running in the sprints.

In the 400 intermediate field
with Foster is Tom Andrews of
USC, who two weeks ago turned
in the nation's fastest time (49.4)
this season.
Foster teams up with Holmes,
Sheats and Lofton to form Stan
ford's 400 meter relav auartet.
School record threat
Lofton and Sheats pair up
again in the mile relay, this time
with Wingo and Matt Hogsett.
The four ran a 3:11.0 mile last
Saturday and have a season's
best of 3:10.8. If things mesh
right, they are a definite threat to
break the school record (3:10.5).
Although Lofton is Stanford's
premier field event man, the Ba
rons will also be represented in
the pole vault, weight events and
high jump. Senior Bob Flint,
third on Stanford's list of all
time vaulters, clearing 16-6
Saturday, was the California
junior college champion two
years ago. Flint will have a shot

Friday at becoming the first
Stanford vaulter to ever clear 17
feet.
In the throws, Stanford is rep
resented by freshman Brad Slin
kard in the shot put, sophomore
Mark Hill in the discus and
senior John Macrorie in the jave
lin.
Although this is freshman
Kent Doyle's first Pac-8 champ
ionship, his two appearances at
the California high school track
and field championship give the
young high jumper some needed
experience for this weekend. His
6-8 jump against Cal made him
the sixth best Stanford high
jumper ever.
What's the Stanford strategy
this weekend?
"You can't tell them much
when they are going into a
championship meet such as
this," Jordan said. "We'll just try
to maximize our results both in
dividually and collectively."

EASY STRIDER— Stanford's James Lofton grins his way into the
tape in a recent meet. Lofton leads the tracksters in the Pacific-8
championships this weekend.
Although the Stanford con
tingent at this weekend's
Pacific-8 Track and Field
Championship is not going to
obstruct the path for either USC
or UCLA in their quests for the
team crown, the Robber Barons
are legitimate threats to take sev
eral of the individual titles.
Payton Jordan's troops are led
into Berkeley's Edwards
Stadium Friday and Saturday by
long jumper James Lofton and
distance runner Tony Sandoval.
Both Lofton and Sandoval
scored in last year's Pac-8 meet,
Lofton placing sixth in the long
jump and Sandoval finishing
second in the six-mile run.
Lofton, a California state prep
champ, was undefeated this year
during the dual meet season.
The sophomore from Los
Angeles has beaten USC's
Gerald Hardemann and UCLA's
Willie Banks, who are ranked

one-two in the league, in meets
earlier this season. Lofton, in
addition to trying to gain the
Pac-8 title, will be seeking to
meet the NCAA qualifying mark
of 25-0.
"To win or place high you're
go/ngto have to jump 25 feet Fri
day, ' Lofton said. He said he
feels he can win the jump "if I
can do the little things, like hit
the board right."
Sandoval returns
Sandoval finished second last
year to Washington State's John
Ngeno in the six-mile. Sandoval
is back this year, and so is
Ngeno. The Kenyan, and fellow
countryman and teammate,
Samson Kimombwa, have the
league's two best times at 10,000
meters (6.21 miles). Should
Sandoval decide to run the 5,000
on Saturday, another WSU Ke
nyan, Joshua Kimento, holds the
conference's best mark at that
distance.

"Historically, I can't afford a
quick pace early," said the
senior from Los Alamos, N.M. "I
have to go out reasonable and
come in hard."

feet.
In the throws, Stanford is rep
resented by freshman Brad Slin
kard in the shot put, sophomore
Mark Hill in the discus and
senior John Macrorie in the jave
lin.
Although this is freshman
Kent Doyle's first Pac-8 champ
ionship, his two appearances at
the California high school track
and field championship give the
young high jumper some needed
experience for this weekend. His
6-8 jump against Cal made him
the sixth best Stanford high
jumper ever.
What's the Stanford strategy
this weekend?
"You can't tell them much
when they are going into a
championship meet such as
this," Jordan said. "We'll just try
to maximize our results both in
dividually and collectively."
