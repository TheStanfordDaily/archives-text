What do Ray Young, Jim
Gaughran, Bud Finger, Howie
Dallmar, Pete Kmetovic, Dick
Gould and Anne Hill have in
common? Right. All of them cur
rently are, or have been, Stanford
head coaches.
But they have another distinc
tion, that of being star athletes in
their undergraduate days at
Stanford. In fact, Young, Gaug
hran, Finger, Dallmar and
Kmetovic all are members of the
school's sports Hall of Fame.
Young, in his 10th season as
head Card baseball coach, star
red for three years on the varsity
diamond squad as a pitcher and
a sometimes outfielder.
His 24 career wins and 310 1/3

innings pitched are both Stan
ford records.
Young was honored as the
most valuable player of the
California Intercollegiate
Baseball Association (CIBA) in
1954 and '56, and was selected to
the 1954 U.S. Pan American
team.
Swim coach Jim Gaughran, a
1954 graduate of the Stanford
Law School, captained both the
swimming and water polo teams
during his senior year and was
twice a swimming Ail-
American.
He played on the AAU na
tional water polo squad from
1955 through 1959 and was a
member of the 1956 U.S. Olym
pic water polo team.
In his 16th year as Stanford
swim coach, Gaughran says he
knew he wanted to be a coach
about "halfway through my
senior year."
Does the fact that he attended
Stanford help in his coaching

duties today? "I think it helps
quite a bit," says Gaughran.
"You are able to better under
stand the problems the athletes
face here."
What has changed most since
his own college days? "The
training methods have primarily
changed," he says."The warm
ups we do now used to be our
workouts when I was swim
ming."
Bud Finger, in his 28th year as
Stanford golf coach, was an ex
cellent player in his day, playing
on NCAA championship teams
in 1939 and '41.
Finger once fired a 64 on the
Stanford course, just one stroke
above the course record.
As a coach, Finger's 1953
squad won the NCAA title.
Howie Dallmar, former bas
ketball coach and now a special
assistant to the Stanford athletic
director, was a standout guard
and a member of Stanford's 1942
NCAA championship team.

He played several years with
the Philadelphia Warriors before
starting his coaching career at
age 25 at the University of
Pennsylvania, where he was
head basketball and baseball

coach for six years.
What was different between
Dallmar's era and the present
era? "Well, there was no jump
shot then, the players used the
one hand set shot," says
Dallmar.
Rose Bowl hero
Rugby coach Pete Kmetovic
starred on the 1940 Wow Boys
and gained 141 yards in 14 car
ries in the 1941 Rose Bowl to
earn the game's outstanding
player award as Stanford beat
Nebraska, 21-13.
Kmetovic says he had a pretty
good idea that he wanted to
coach when he was in school. As
for changes in sports, he says
"the biggest change is that all
sports have become more
specialized, especially football."
Tennis coach Dick Gould
competed at Stanford in the late
1950s and early '60s. He re
ceived the Buck Club leadership
award for tennis in 1960 while a
member of the varsity squad.
As a coach, Gould guided
Stanford teams to consecutive
NCAA net championships in
1973 and '74.
Conference championships
Anne Hill is the most recent
Stanford undergraduate. She
played on the Card tennis team
from 1968-71 and was a member
of conference championship
squads in 1969-71.
Hill competed at No. 1 doubles
and her own players believe the
fact she competed here helps her
coaching.
"She knows that we're going
through," says team member Pat
Varga. "She understands the
pressure we're under."
So, there you have it, seven
Stanford coaches and all Stan
ford products.
So, remember, the next time
you see a present day Stanford
athlete perform, who knows, he
or she may be a Stanford coach of
the future.
