# Team doctor heals athletes
## Behling- a smooth operator 
### Jan Miller 
Followed by a smatter of applause, the
injured football player is assisted to the
sideline. Inconspicuous prior to the de
molition play and absently taking a draw
on his pipe, the team physician, loyally
dficked in a red shirt accented by his
35mm camera, readily turns his eyes
from the action to the injury.
Dr. Fred Behling has followed Stan
ford sports injuries as team physician
since the day 18 years ago when Dr. Earl
Frederick "Fritz" Roth, then a veteran of
the position for 35 years, suggested that
Behling come down to the bench for a
game.
Behling missed the first game of the
1958 season to attend a wedding, but he's
since built his life around sports
schedules. The amount of time he de
votes to his work hasn't interfered with
his family, who enjoy their association
with Stanford.
Recalling the first game he attended,
Behling says"I was properly scared and
nervous about all the noise and clacking
of pads," noise which he since has be
come accustomed to.
The University of Minnesota graduate
is currently the head of the sports

medicine department of the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic, where he specializes in
sports medicine and orthopedic surgery.
The clinic is affiliated with Stanford's
Athletic Department on a contractual
basis; thus Behling receives the same
salary regardless of the amount of opera
tions he performs. He leaves time during
his regular office hours, usually 12:30 to
2 p.m., solely for treating his athlete pa
tients.
Behling treats patients who have suf
fered serious knee, shoulder or arm in
juries, while less severe ailments are
handled by the trainers under his direc
tion.
He labels knee surgery as the most
common surgical operation he performs
during the football season. Behling be
lieves that football is the most dangerous
sport in Stanford's program because it is
"much more intense with far and away
the most injuries per season." Rugby is
second to football in high injury inci
dence.
Behling asserts that his athlete pa
tients enjoy a high recovery rate. "That's
the super part about treating such
people," Behling says. "They're ex

tremely well motivated to get better.
Since they're athletically skilled and
wise about their muscle systems, they
invariably do extremely well at re
habilitating properly."
Among the more prominent Stanford
football players to make their way into
Behling's office have been San Francisco
49er quarterback Jim Plunkett and
Tampa Bay tight end Bob Moore, but
Behling contends that "All are promi
nent when they're patients, they're all
number one."
Behling is the absolute authority on
when an athlete may resume participa
tion in a sport after an injury. His ability to
control when an athlete may resume play
is different from the relationship existing
in professional football, where he says
the management exercises control over
when an athlete returns to play, in spite
of the doctor.
"I assume they try to get more out of
their players' in professional football,"
Behlingcomments. In his own profes
sional experience, as a physician for the
San Francisco Giants, he says he had no
problems with anyone telling him who
should play and when.

Stanford's head trainer Dave Blan
chard says Behling is "a real sports fana
tic who's dedicated and tireless." As
Stanford's team physician, Behling at
tends all of the Cards' football games.
His most memorable experiences in
his position were the team bus trips
home from the Rose Bowl after Stan
ford's conquests over Ohio State and
Michigan in 1971 and '72 respectively,
memories that are constantly wi th him in
the presence of a gold watch and ring he
wears daily.
His favorite sport is emphatically foot
ball, primarily because he says he feels
"so intimately involved with it."
He admits "I'm pretty well footballed
out during the season, but I can hardly
wait for it to begin again in the fall and
can hardly wait for it to end January 1."
Already looking toward the '76-77
season, Behling confidently predicts that
"It's going to be a great year, they've got a
lot of returning talent."
But on reflection he confides: "Hon
estly, I never know how they look. They
always look super to me."
Another Rose Bowl? "You'd better be
lieve it!" says Behling.

Dr. Fred Behling has followed Stan
ford sports injuries as team physician
since the day 18 years ago when Dr. Earl
Frederick "Fritz" Roth, then a veteran of
the position for 35 years, suggested that
Behling come down to the bench for a
game.
Behling missed the first game of the
1958 season to attend a wedding, but he's
since built his life around sports
schedules. The amount of time he de
votes to his work hasn't interfered with
his family, who enjoy their association
with Stanford.
Recalling the first game he attended,
Behling says"I was properly scared and
nervous about all the noise and clacking
of pads," noise which he since has be
come accustomed to.
The University of Minnesota graduate
is currently the head of the sports

medicine department of the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic, where he specializes in
sports medicine and orthopedic surgery.
The clinic is affiliated with Stanford's
Athletic Department on a contractual
basis; thus Behling receives the same
salary regardless of the amount of opera
tions he performs. He leaves time during
his regular office hours, usually 12:30 to
2 p.m., solely for treating his athlete pa
tients.
Behling treats patients who have suf
fered serious knee, shoulder or arm in
juries, while less severe ailments are
handled by the trainers under his direc
tion.
He labels knee surgery as the most
common surgical operation he performs
during the football season. Behling be
lieves that football is the most dangerous
sport in Stanford's program because it is
"much more intense with far and away
the most injuries per season." Rugby is
second to football in high injury inci
dence.
Behling asserts that his athlete pa
tients enjoy a high recovery rate. "That's
the super part about treating such
people," Behling says. "They're ex

tremely well motivated to get better.
Since they're athletically skilled and
wise about their muscle systems, they
invariably do extremely well at re
habilitating properly."
Among the more prominent Stanford
football players to make their way into
Behling's office have been San Francisco
49er quarterback Jim Plunkett and
Tampa Bay tight end Bob Moore, but
Behling contends that "All are promi
nent when they're patients, they're all
number one."
Behling is the absolute authority on
when an athlete may resume participa
tion in a sport after an injury. His ability to
control when an athlete may resume play
is different from the relationship existing
in professional football, where he says
the management exercises control over
when an athlete returns to play, in spite
of the doctor.
"I assume they try to get more out of
their players' in professional football,"
Behlingcomments. In his own profes
sional experience, as a physician for the
San Francisco Giants, he says he had no
problems with anyone telling him who
should play and when.

Stanford's head trainer Dave Blan
chard says Behling is "a real sports fana
tic who's dedicated and tireless." As
Stanford's team physician, Behling at
tends all of the Cards' football games.
His most memorable experiences in
his position were the team bus trips
home from the Rose Bowl after Stan
ford's conquests over Ohio State and
Michigan in 1971 and '72 respectively,
memories that are constantly wi th him in
the presence of a gold watch and ring he
wears daily.
His favorite sport is emphatically foot
ball, primarily because he says he feels
"so intimately involved with it."
He admits "I'm pretty well footballed
out during the season, but I can hardly
wait for it to begin again in the fall and
can hardly wait for it to end January 1."
Already looking toward the '76-77
season, Behling confidently predicts that
"It's going to be a great year, they've got a
lot of returning talent."
But on reflection he confides: "Hon
estly, I never know how they look. They
always look super to me."
Another Rose Bowl? "You'd better be
lieve it!" says Behling.
