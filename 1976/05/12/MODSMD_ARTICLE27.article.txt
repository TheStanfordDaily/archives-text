### Jill Lieber 
"This was a joke," Pat Varga of
the Stanford women's tennis
team said following the wo
men's 8-1 victory over Foothill
College yesterday.
Varga described the match
well, but coach Anne Hill had
some milder words about the JC
team. "Foothill is undefeated in
the junior college league, but re
latively speaking they're not that
strong."
The Cards outclassed the
Foothill team, even without the
help of four of their top players.
Lele Forood, Barb Jordan, Susie
Hagey and Diane Morrison left

yesterday for Merrifield, Va. to
compete in the Seventeen
Magazine Championships. Hill
also kept Marcy O'Keefe out of
the contest because of the rela
tive insignificance of the match.
Rudd wins
Playing at the No. 1 spot for
the first time this year, sopho
more Nancy Rudd crushed
Foothill's Julie Jacklich, 6-0,6-0.
Varga easily defeated Annette
Havens in the No. 2 slot, 6-0,6-1,
while the Cards' Nancy Ander
son overcame Carolyn Yauman,
6-4, 6-1 at No. 3 singles and Pat
Delaney beat Foothill's Connie

Playing for the first time in
nearly two months, freshman
Marianne Ingard, at No. 5,
downed Noreen Ford, 6-2, 6-4.
Ingard has been hampered by a
pulled ligament in her leg.
The Cards' No. 6 player,
sophomore Alison Carlson also
saw her first action of the season.
Carlson, the manager of the wo
men's team, suffered the Cards'
only defeat as she fell, 7-5,6-0 to
Teresa Itaya.
Hill pleased
Hill was pleased with the
team's performance. "It's great
to have Marianne and Pat (De

the match.
Probably the only serious ten

teen Magazine tournament. The
top female amateur players from

California in the 18 category.

Hill pleased
Hill was pleased with the
team's performance. "It's great
to have Marianne and Pat (De

laney) playing," she said after
the match.
Probably the only serious ten
nis that any of the Card women
will play this week is the Seven
teen Magazine tournament. The
top female amateur players from
each state in the U.S. compete in
four age divisions: 21-and
under, 18, 16 and 14.
Susie Hagey will represent
California in the 18 category.
Forood, Florida's representative,
Jordan, Pennsylvania's rep
resentative, and Morrison,
California's representative, will
all compete in the 21-and-under
age group.
"The tournament is
sanctioned by the United States
Tennis Association (USTA),"
Hill said. "So the girls will be
taking it seriously as the tour
nament counts for rankings."
"This was a joke," Pat Varga of
the Stanford women's tennis
team said following the wo
men's 8-1 victory over Foothill
College yesterday.
Varga described the match
well, but coach Anne Hill had
some milder words about the JC
team. "Foothill is undefeated in
the junior college league, but re
latively speaking they're not that
strong."
The Cards outclassed the
Foothill team, even without the
help of four of their top players.
Lele Forood, Barb Jordan, Susie
Hagey and Diane Morrison left

yesterday for Merrifield, Va. to
compete in the Seventeen
Magazine Championships. Hill
also kept Marcy O'Keefe out of
the contest because of the rela
tive insignificance of the match.
