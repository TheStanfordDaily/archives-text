# Chilled water units not working

I Because several chilled-water units are not working, the University will
be operating with only half its chilled water capacity for at least the next few
days, according to Robert McKnight, manager of utilities.
The units are part of the University's central refrigeration system, which
provides the chilled water used in the cooling systems of most of the major
buildings on campus.
McKnight explained that one large, older unit will be out for repairs
during the next three or four days, while two newer units are awaiting parts
in a manufacturer's retrofit. A retrofit is a facility where parts of a system are
replaced at the manufacturer's expense, either because the parts have
proven troublesome or faulty, or because an improved version has been
made.
Buildings served by the central refrigeration system include the Center for
Research and Development in Teaching, Cummings Art Building, the Law
School, Jordan Hall and the Lou Henry Hoover annex.
Research and animal care facilities requiring cooling and campus compu
ter installations will have first priority for chilled water, McKnight said.
Buildings affected by this policy include McCullough, earth sciences, Her
rin laboratories and Varian physics.
In allocating the remaining chilled water, "We'll be working with people
in each building, trying to see what's acceptable and feasible," commented
McKnight.
