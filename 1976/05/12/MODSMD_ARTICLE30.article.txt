Candidates' funds released
WASHINGTON — President Ford signed a bill
yesterday restructuring the Federal Election Com
mission and restoring its power to release up to $3.8
million in federal funds for money-starved presi
dential candidates.
Ford, who said he opposes some provisions of the
bill, will be the chief beneficiary. He has a pending
request for $1.4 million in matching funds before
the commission.
His Republican challenger, Ronald Reagan, has
requested $603,000. Among other presidential con
tenders. Jimmy Carter is on the books for $520,000
and Morris Udall for $386,000.
In his signing statement, Ford said the bill com
manded widespread support in both houses of
Congressbut "I still have serious reservations about
certain aspects of the present amendments."
He said that after the 1976 elections he will sub
mit legislation "that will correct problems created
by the present laws and make additional needed
reforms in the election process."
The President said his main concern is that the
amendments jeopardize the independence of the
Federal Election Commission by permitting either
house of Congress to veto regulations which the
commission, as an executive agency, issues.
He said this provision not only circumvents the
original intent of campaign reform, but, "in my
opinion violates the constitution."
Che's 'assassin' shot down in France
PARIS — Gunmen claiming to be avengers of the
late Che Guevara yesterday shot and killed
Bolivia's ambassador to France, who nine years ago
commanded the successful manhunt for the Cuban
revolutionary.
Gen. Joaquim Zentenu Anaya, 53, was fatally
wounded as he walked to his car at lunchtime near
the Seine River, in view of the Eiffel Tower, by a
group calling itself the International Che Guevara
Brigades. He was the third ambassador killed in
Europe since last October.
In a statement issued to news media about three
hours after the attack, the brigades called the gen
eral "the man behind the murder of Che Guevara"
and warned that "those who oppress their people or
harbor former Nazis will be treated in a manner
they merit."
The group said it was also acting to commemo
rate the Nazi surrender May 8, 1945. Zenteno
Anaya was described in its communique as having
defended Bolivia's refusal to extradite Klaus Bar
bie, a Nazi war criminal, to France.
Guevara, the Argentine-born Cuban revolutio
nary, was killed in October 1967 by the4th Bolivian
Rangers Division commanded by Zenteno Anaya.
He was tracked down after an'unsuccessful attempt
to rally Bolivian peasants around his guerrilla
force.
More earthquakes hit Italy, Greece
UDINE, Italy — A strong earth tremor shook the
devastated areas of northeastern Italy minutes be
fore midnight last night, causing more destruction
and injury, police reported.

The tremor knocked down buildings in Geinona,
Maiano and Peonis di Trasaghis already damaged
by last Thursday's killer quake, according to pre
liminary reports reaching the national police head
quarters in Rome. An officer said a number of per
sons were injured, but how many was not known
immediately.
Last week's quake left 914 persons dead by offi
cial count, with more than 3000 injured and about
400 unaccounted for.
In Washington, President Ford asked Congress to
provide $25 million in relief funds for the quake
victims and the Senate approved the measure.
Last night's strong tremor capped a day of ten
sion and fear of a typhoid outbreak after a fireman
was hospitalized in Udine with symptoms of the
often-fatal disease.
A tremor was felt yesterday evening in Taranto,
on the Gulf of Tacanto in southern Italy, but no
casualties or damage were reported.
The tremor was felt strongly on the Greek island
of Zakinthos in the lonian Sea and thousands of
residents fled into the streets.
New Hughes will found, questioned
LAS VEGAS — The late Howard Hughes' Summa
Corp., named executor in a purported Hughes will
that surfaced yesterday, did not exist at the time the
will was dated, a Summa spokesman said.
Nevertheless, the newly found document, which
apportions the multibillion-dollar Hughes estate to
relatives, charitable causes and 10 "living Ameri
cans" identified only by Social Security numbers,
was filed with the Clark County clerk yesterday by
Summa officials as a matter of routine.
The three-page neatly handwritten document
was dated June 22, 1969. It did not state the total
value of the Hughes estate. Summa Corp. did not
exist before December 1971, nor was the name even
under consideration much before then,according to
Summa spokesman Arelo Sederberg.
The purported will was received in the mail by
the clerk's office. It was addressed to the Summa
Corp., care of the Clark County clerk.
Panel blocks nuclear safety bills
SACRAMENTO — A package of nuclear safety
bills was blocked late yesterday by a state senate
committee which abruptly adjourned without tak
ing a final vote.
The Senate Public Utilities, Transit and Energy
Committee's action was called "a sham" by As
semblyman Charles Warren (D-Los Angeles), the
leading supporter of the three bills.
The key action was the rejection by the commit
tee chairman, Sen. Alfred Alquist (D-San Jose), of a
Republican member's request for a roll call ad
journment decision. Alquist halted the 4V2-hour
hearing on the bills, that had only a day earlier won
an endorsement from Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.
Warren told reporters that he doubted if Alquist
would schedule another hearing on the package
early enough for a vote that would permit the legis
lation to survive. If not, the bills would effectively
be killed.
The package has been described as a moderate
alternative to the Nuclear Power Plants Initiative,
Prop. 15 on the June 8 primary ballot.
At the hearing, representatives of public utilities

criticized the requirement for legislative approval
for nuclear fuel recycling and waste storage
methods, and also sought exemptions for four nuc
lear reactors now in the early planning stages.
"There's evidence tonight that at least one
house, the Senate, is incapable of legislative re
view," said Warren, chairman of the Assembly Re
sources, Land Use and Energy Committee that
drafted the proposals.
Judge bans nets for tuna fishing
WASHINGTON — Environmentalists won a
major fight against tuna fishermen yesterday as a
federal judge banned the use of nets that kill more
than 100,000 porpoises each year. The judge said
the decision may raise the price of tuna to consum
ers.
"It could mean an end to the industry," August
Felando, general manager of the American
Tunaboat Association, said in San Diego. But the
Environmental Defense Fund praised the decision
and said it would not raise the price of tuna to
consumers.
Under the order by U.S. District Judge Charles R.
Richey, tuna fishermen can no longer use nets that
ensnare porpoises along with the tuna. It bans a
method, known as "fishing on porpoise," by which
speedboats surround schools of porpoises with
large nets to trap the yellowfin tuna that swim be
neath the mammals.
Drought cuts hydroelectric power
SAN FRANCISCO — Because of a serious
drought, less than a third of the normal mountain
water runoff is available for electrical power gener
ation in Northern California, Pacific Gas & Electric
Co. reported yesterday.
"The numerous snow courses utilized by PG&E
forecasters have an overall historic May 1 average
of 31 inches of water content. This year's water
content dropped to nine inches," the utility re
ported in a news release.
"Translated, the forecast means that runoff avail
able for PG&E hydroelectric generation will proba
bly be the lowest since 1930-31 and that the com
pany will have to rely heavily on costly imported
low-sulfur oil at its thermal power plants," the
company said.
PG&E operates 65 hydroelectric generating
plants in the survey area stretching from the Pit
River to the North Fork of the Kings River. They are
generating an average of 880,000 kilowatts, com
pared to a capacity of 2.5 million kilowatts, PG&E
spokesman Paul Girrard said.
A city the size of San Francisco uses about
750,000 kilowatts.
PG&E noted the Pacific Northwest has recorded a
better than average water year, and the surplus hyd
roelectric generation in Oregon and Washington is
being purchased by PG&E and other utilities for
delivery to California.
"Some areas are in worse condition than others,
but if everybody uses water wisely and coopera
tively, we should not experience any major domes
tic water shortage," the company said.
Today's weather
Fair and warm through tomorrow. Lows both
nights in the 50s and highs in the upper 80s.
Northwest winds 10 to 20 mph afternoons and
evenings.
