teacher. 1 haven't had him, however, so
I have no basis to judge on my own."
While at VOT, however, Foley won
the Baker Award for excellence in
teaching, and students have cited him
as an outstanding teacher here.
Graduate student James Brander ag
reed that "Duncan is the best teacher

I've ever had. What I find unique about
Duncan is that he's perfectly honest
intellectually. He's at his best while
describing and explaining difficult
and highly technical material."
Foley has of late written on Marxist
approaches to economics. His paper,
"Towards a Marxist Theory of
Money," is still in working form.
Throughout the tenure controversy,
Foley has said that the department has
given "no reasons" for the decision not
to grant him tenure except that "some
members of the department have
doubts about my future productivity."
But Hickman said, "I communicated
the sense of the department's ques
tions (above Foley's qualifications) to
the best of my ability."
Foley also said that his work in his
first two years here — four papers,
three of which were published in
"major journals" — is close to his own
average output level.
