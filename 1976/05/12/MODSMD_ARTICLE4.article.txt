Ford wins W. Virginia; Carter victor in Conn.

OMAHA (AP) â€” Ronald Reagan
beat President Ford in the Nebraska
presidential primary election last
night. President Ford won in West
Virginia.
In Democratic competition, Idaho
Sen. Frank Church scored an upset he
called a miracle, defeating frontrunner
Jimmy Carter in Nebraska.
That outcome stalled, at least tem
porarily. the nomination drive of the
former Ceorgia governor. Carter won
narrowly over Rep. Morris Udall in the
Connecticut Democratic: primary.
The two contests were sure to
nourish the stop-Carter hopes of
Democrats who want somebody else
atop their partv ticket.
HHH revival?
And that could point to a revival of
the long-shot effort to promote Sen.
Hubert Humphrey, who has shunned
the primaries but has declared he's
still available should the party want
him to run again.
The day's Republican balloting
pointed to a likely split decision, an
outcome that would not produce a
major change in the COP picture as the
President and conservative challenger
headed into a crucial contest in Michi
gan next Tuesday.
Reagan, in Boise, Idaho, said he had
won "a legitimate test in the Republi
can party" with his Nebraska victory.
He refused to speculate about the pos
sible outcome in Michigan next week.
Reagan already had established
himself as the Republican leader and
RogersC. B.Morton,the Ford manager,
said that momentum was a key factor

in the Nebraska verdict.
Morton said he hoped it wouldn't
carry over into Michigan where, he
acknowledged, Ford will have to win
to prove himself a viable candidate.
Church said a Nebraska win in his
first primary test would be a miracle, a
showing that would establish his cre
dentials as a real contender for nomi
nation.
Udall contended the Carter band
wagon had been slal led in Connecticut
and Nebraska.
Nebraska
With 61 percent of the precincts
counted, it was:
Reagan 66,575 or 53 percent;
Ford 60,143 or 47 percent.
Only 30 percent of the precincts had
been counted in the separate delegate
competition. Reagan led for 14, Ford
for 11.
In the Democratic primary:
Church 45,975 or 40 percent:
Carter 41,337 or 36 percent.
Sen. Hubert Humphrey was getting
seven percent of the vote, with eight
other names dividing the balance.
Carter led for 14 Democratic dele
gates, Church for eight, with one un
committed entry leading. The
statewide popular vote had no bear
ing on the delegate competition.
West Virginia
With 42 percent of the precincts re
porting, the count:
Ford 34,431 or 44 percent:
Reagan 27,364 or 44 percent.
In the Democratic primary there, it
was:
Favorite son Sen. Robert Byrd
122,513 or 89 percent;
Alabama Cov. Ceorge Wallace
14,744 or 11 percent.
The popular vote did not affect dele
gates there, either. The 28 Republican
and 33 Democratic delegates are, by
state law, uncommitted.
Ford managers said most of the COP
delegates would side with the Presi
dent.
Connecticut
Final returns in a party-run primary
were as follows:
Carter 35,415 or 33 percent;
Udall 32,959 or 31 percent;
Sen. Henry Jackson of Washington
18,962 or 18 percent.
Thirteen percent of the vote was for
uncommitted delegates.

That was one step in a complex
delegate-choosing process.
When the 51-member delegation is
selected next month, Carter probably
will gain 17 delegates, Udall 15 and
Jackson 5, with the balance likely to be
uncommitted.
Total delegates
Carter thus had 586 delegates,
counting his projected Connecticut
share. It will take 1505 to select a
Democratic nominee.
Reagan gained three delegates in a
Louisiana caucus last night, running
his total tu 399. Ford has 309.
The target in that contest is 1130 de
legate votes for nomination.
