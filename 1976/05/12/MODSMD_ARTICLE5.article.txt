# Foley tenure dispute stirs econ department
## 
### Philip Feder 
The possible resignation of Assoc.
Economics Prof. Duncan Foley may
"influence two or three faculty mem
bers to seek alternatives" to the
Economics Department here, said
economics graduate student Deric
Jennings yesterday.
Foley's senior colleagues postponed
a decision on his tenure last December
and again last month. The department
has not made a final decision concern
ing tenure for Foley.
It decided last fall quarter to recom
mend him for reappointment for a
three-year term as an associate profes
sor without tenure.
Jennings, a newly elected member of
the ASSU Council of Presidents, said
at an open meeting attended by nearly
70 economics students that those fa
culty members may "leave if Duncan
leaves and go where Duncan goes."
Students yesterday discussed possi
ble protests against the department's
decision not to grant tenure at this
time, calling for a possible one- or
two-day boycott of economics classes.

(Recent reports also suggest that the
department will suffer next year from
the resignation of Prof. Joseph Stiglitz,
who is going to England, and from the
retirement of Prof. Tibor Scitovsky.)
Opposition
Former graduate student Jens Chris
tiansen, now teaching at UC-Santa
Cruz, said at the meeting, "There is a
small group of senior faculty members
opposed to him (Foley), and they are
able to instill this on the rest of the
faculty."
Foley said he plans to remain here
through the end of the next academic
year and then to accept a tenured posi
tion at another school in September
1977.
He has studied advanced economic
theory and recently began to write
about Marxist alternatives to
economics.
In an interview with the Daily last
week,Foley said that at the time of his
appointment three years ago he was
given "the promise of an early deci
sion on tenure with a lot of enthusiasm
for my work."
Consideration for tenure
Assoc. Economics Prof. James Rosse,
vice chairman of the department three
years ago, said last night that Foley
was "told we (the department) would
consider him for tenure during the
time of his appointment."
The department ruled again last
week that "... this is not the approp
riate time to propose tenure for Dun
can Foley," in a statement prepared by
Economics Department Chairman Bert
Hickman yesterday.
Hickman added, "As before, by this
action the department left open the
question of promotion during the com
ing three years of his renewed ap
pointment."
The department reconsidered its
earlier decision in light of offers Foley
had received from other schools.
The department's decision to refuse
Foley's tenure request last fall quarter
represented a rejection of the depart

ment's search committee recommen
dation. The committee voted unanim
ously that Foley be promoted to a te
nured full professorship, according to
Christiansen.
Scitovsky, the committee chairman,
confirmed Christiansen's claim.
Soliciting opinions
Following standard procedure, the
search committee, composed of Sci
tovsky, Assoc. Prof. David Starrettand
Prof. John Curley, solicited the opin
ions of professors outside the Univer
sity.
One outside professor, Yale
Economics Department Chairman
James Tobin, a leading U.S.
economist, told the Daily yesterday."I
have very high regards for his (Foley's)
scholarship. He's obviously a fine
economist." But Tobin refused to
comment further on the department's
decision.
Asst. Economics Prof. Karen
Johnson, an expert in monetarism who
studied under Foley while he was a
professor at MIT, said yesterday, "1
have a great deal of respect for him
(Foley) and his work. I woould say that
