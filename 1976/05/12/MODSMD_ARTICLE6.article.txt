# Round One draw results out today?
## 
### 
Round One housing draw results
will "probably" be distributed this af
ternoon, according to Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton.
The results were due yesterday, ac
cording to previously published
schedules. Horton said the draw's
complexity caused the delay.
"It just takes a long while to process
and check things — but things are
moving along," he said.
Horton declined to speculate on
what Round One cutoffs for next year's
seniors will be. Last year, the cutoff
figures were 2001 for men and 3125 for
women.
Based on last year's draw figures,
cutoffs for next year's seniors could be
as much as 25 percent lower than last
year's cutoffs. Under such a cir
cumstance, a disproportionate number
of seniors would be unassigned at the
end of Round One. but the normal
number would receive assignments by
the end of Round Two.
"(Thip) doom-and-gloom scenario, I
think, is unlikely," Horton said. "Even
though people say 'what if'—these
things haven't happened in the past,"
Horton said.
"We have been looking at this. We
have considered that this might hap
pen; we hope it won't."
Housing Office workers were seen
doing paperwork behind closed doors
yesterday morning "working out the
mistakes," a secretary said.
Horton insisted that all students
with guaranteed housing for next year
would receive assignments today.
"We will house all guaranteed
people with ease," he commented.
