# Lyman discusses gay issues
## 'Lyons was misunderstood' 
### Geoff Samuels 
President Richard Lyman said yes
terday that there has been "substantial
misunderstanding" over Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons' statements
on the problems of gay students.
Interviewed on KZSU' Campus Con
ference, Lyman said that Lyons was
misconstrued as "dismissing the
whole problem as unimportant, or
dismissing the idea that gay people
had difficulties as in some way unreal,
or not worth dealing with."
However, what Lyons has resisted,
Lyman said, is an attempt to "form a
coercive practice toward employers
who won't declare in legal form that
they do not discriminate on that basis
(sexual preference)."
The existence of intolerance toward
gay people on campus is not surpris
ing, Lyman said. "In fact," he added. "I
would be surprised not to find it."
Lyman emphasized the need to dif
ferentiate between violations of civil
rights and expression of individual in
tolerance.
"It isn't clear," he said, "that every
category of behavior that causes
people to behave in intolerant ways
toward those who exhibit that be
havior necessarily falls under civil
rights."
Last week on Campus Conference,
Richard Thomas, community relations
coordinator for the Gay Peoples I Jnion

(GPU), said that the University was
less tolerant toward gay people than
several local communities. He cited
the greater tolerance at a couple of
local high schools.
Lyman responded by criticizing the
method of comparison employed by
Thomas. Lyman said that he doubted
the validity of comparing high schools
to a university, and that he knew of no
serious study which undertook such a
comparison.
"Whether this community is more or
less tolerant I have no way of know
ing," Lyman said.

The possibility of increased under
standing of thecondition of gay people
is not likely to be much increased in an
emotionally charged atmosphere, he
said.
It is important, Lyman added, that
arguments are not presented "based on
accusations which are not only un
proven, but unprovable—such as
claims about a lack of courage."
On other matters. Lyman said the
recent ability of the University of Vir
ginia to attract some top-flight scho
lars was due less to a slightly higher
pay scale than to the lack of teaching
commitments during the first couple
of years.
In letters to the Daily, French Prof.
Robert Cohn has emphasized the dif
ference in pay. rather than in teaching
commitments, Lyman said. "I think
that Prof. Cohn has emphasized too
much the issue of money, rather than
the extent of teaching commitments."
Although there is presently not as
much money available as before for
"raiding" other institutions for scho
lars, Lyman added that there is some
benefit to universities from a reduction
in "raiding."
The search for better offers, Lyman
said, "certainly played some part in
influencing the tendency of faculty
members to identify more with fellow
scholars across the country, rather
than with the institutions in which
they taught."
