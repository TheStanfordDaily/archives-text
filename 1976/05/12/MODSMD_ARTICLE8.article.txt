# Kissinger strengthens U.S.
## 
### 
Let's hear some cheers for
Henry Kissinger!
Not because Kissinger is a
saint. He isn't. As has been
amply pointed out by "liberals,"
Kissinger is a creator of various
wiretap schemes, is occasionally
an outright liar and is an ac
complice in some outrageous
policies, such as the Christmas
1972 Hanoi bombing to appease
Nguyen Van Thieu.
But right now, Kissinger is
pursuing some policies which
can do nothing but strengthen
the U.S. in this post-Cold War
and anti-imperialist era. Kis
singer might be doing even bet
ter if it were not for the attacks of
Ronald Reagan, and the silence
of those who should agree with
him.
For example, Panama. All of
Latin America seems united on
wanting the United States out of
the Canal Zone. The extent to
which Latin Americans want
Panamanian self-rule is de
monstrated by the fact that all
Latin American nations — in
cluding both Castro's Cuba and
the Chilean junta — nearly got
together to urge an end to the
U.S. presence. The conference
didn't quite come off, but it
might, next year.
Retreat needed
It didn't take the Ford-
Kissinger administration long to
figure out that the U.S. needs to
gracefully retreat from the Canal
Zone to ensure good relations
with Latin American nations —
even the military dictatorships.
But when the administration
began sending out feelers,
Reagan began attacking. Joined
by such hardliners as California
candidate Alphonso Bell (whose
answer to questions ®n Panama
is "We paid for it, didn't we?")
Reagan has been making politi
cal hay out of being Panamanian
It's obvious that the U.S.
should negotiate a settlement be

fore it's too late and we're em
broiled in a guerrilla war. But
where are the people who think
so? Can it be that Ford and Kis
singer are more progressive on
this issue than anyone else,
Democrat, Republican, socialist
or independent?
Arms race
Reagan's other big issue is that
we've been falling short of the

Russians in the arms race. His
dimly concealed threat is that
unless we pick up, we'll be sub
ject to nuclear blackmail.
This is also preposterous.
There is no Soviet anti-missile
system, operative, under con
struction or dreamed about in
the Kremlin, which can possibly
stop U.S. MIRVs from obliterat
ing the U.S.S.R. The mutual ba
lance of terror is assured for a
long, long time.
But where are the liberal lead
ers to back up Ford and Kis
singer when they say the United
States is in no danger? In hiding,
apparently. A recent New York
Times-CBS poll showed that
even more Democrats than Re
publicans believe that Kissinger
is giving too much away to the
U.S.S.R.
Other than Frank Church,
there is no Democratic leader to
attack Reagan. To do so, after all,
would be a defense of Kissinger.
And that's not politic.
Africa policy
An example of how Reagan
has affected U.S. foreign policy
is the recent warning of Ford and

Kissinger to Cuba to stay out of
Africa or else.
This warning, hypocritical for
a nation which is known to
meddle in everyone's affairs,
was forced by the Reaganites.
Luckily, the Cubans elected not
to call the Ford-Kissinger bluff,
or we would either be in a war or
be proven as paper tigers.
Now Kissinger, having
pacified the Reaganites on the
issue of Africa, is busy begin
ning what could be an enorm
ously beneficial new policy to
ward that continent.
For the first time, the U.S. has
committed itself to majority rule,
stated firmly that it is in favor of
a power transition in Zirnbawe
and proposed a loan bank for the
development of Africa.
Not sufficient
These proposals aren't enough
to satisfy the leaders of pan-
Africanist leaders. The U.S. still
isn't willing to commit itself to
aiding the development of Af
rica under the pan-Africanists
socialist terms.
But it's certainly a big step
forward. Instead of shooting
down Lumumba, and tacitly aid
ing the Rhodesian minority,
we showsigns that we're on the
side of the majority of Africans.
It doesn't really matter what
Kissinger does, though. He's ob
viously a lame duck whether
Ford is elected or not. And a new
Republican administration
would probably change our Af
rican policy back to an im
perialist one again, under the
guise of "stopping the com
munists."
And if all that happens, some
liberals will probably protest
vainly. The same ones who
should have been out applaud
ing Kissinger in the first place.
