## Campus won't look different in 1996 
### Dave Ansley Bonny Rodden 
In 20 years, when you escort your youngster up Palm
Drive to his freshman year at Stanford, will the Farm
look very different to you? Will you be driving your 1996
equivalent of a Buick stationwagon past high-rise
dorms instead of palm trees?
Will the parking lot exodus have re-located the dorms in
Mountain View? Will the computer center still be six miles from
everywhere?
"Well, nobody knows," says Oscar Nelson, Stanford's mas
ter planner. But according to the best forecasts, Stanford will
seem remarkably unchanged 20 years from now.
No new "stars" like Hoover Tower are on the horizon; few
new academic buildings are planned. Your son or daughter
could even be living in the same dorm as you are now. ("See
the dart holes in that closet? Why, I remember back in ... ")
No major construction is even on the drawing boards past
1978. In that year, as many as four different ribboncutting
ceremonies will bring to a close 30 years of continuous con
struction and expansion.
By 1979. workmen will have completed four new buildings-
Frederick Terman engineering, Sherman Fairchild neurc
sciences, Seeley Mudd chemistry and Herbert Hoover Memo
rial — as well as finishing major additions to the Bookstore, the
Main Library and the hospital, according to present plans.
Besides spendmg $2.8 million to expand the Bookstore, the
University needs $20 million to build the Main Library addition
which will be the same size as the present building. The Uni
versity has raised only $8 million, however, for the addition
which will also be connected to the Meyer library underground
stacks. — -



The hospital expansion costs
about S5O million, according to the
Facifities Plan and Capital Fund
ing Forecast: 1976-1981.
There are also plans to refur
bish existing buildings dunng the
next few years, Nelson says.
Building 460, now housing the
Physiology Department, is being
renovated to accommodate the
Computer Science Department.
Physiology will move to the new
neurosciences building, accord
ing to Assoc. Provost Edward
Shaw.
There are plans to renovate the
evacuated History Corner and the
Engineering and Geology Cor
ners when the University can raise
the necessary money.
Problems raising money
Shaw said the University is hav
ing particular difficulty raising the

needed $8 million for the recon
struction of the History Corner.
"We may not be able to recon
struct the History Corner. We still
need to acquire the funds,'' he
admitted.
Once the Engineering Depart
ment moves into the Terman
building (which should be com
pleted in a year), the vacated
space will probably be used for
humanities and sciences. The
most likely departments to move
in are foreign languages or En
glish. according to Shaw.
Shaw says he also hopes to
eventually move the Communica
tion Department into the Quad.
"It would be advantageous to
bring that department closer to the
people with which it deals," Shaw
said.
Once all the immediately
necessary construction and reno

vation of buildings is completed in
the late '70s, the Funding Fore
cast notes that plans for addi
tional buildings for the Music and
Medical Microbiology Depart
ments may begin.
The University has been under
construction continually since
1947.
Since then, the University has
built Stern, Florence Moore, Wil
bur and Crothers Halls; the
Physics tank; Vairan labs; the
Pearce Mitchell building; the
Graduate School of Business;
Dinkelspiel Auditorium; Tresid
der Memorial Union; the
Bookstore; the Post Office; Meyer
Library; Maples Pavilion and the
Law school to cite an incom
plete list.
But after 1978 major construc
tion will essentially stop.
"We think it will be a catch

your-breath' period," says Nel
son. "We haven't had a chance to
do as much advance planning as
we'd like, so we would like to use
the time to develop a master
plan."
What might be included in that
master plan?
Student housing would be vir
tually unchanged 20 years hence.
Barring some large disaster, stu
dents will still be living in all the
same dormitories. Row and clus
ter houses should be able to last
that long as well. However, dor
mitories, Row and cluster houses
will need their utility systems up
dated during the 20 years.
Manzanita Park
The prime target ! n the resi
dence system will be replacing
Manzanita Park, according to
Shaw. The trailers, long a
favorite among holders of high

draw numbers, were originally ac
quired as an "emergency action"
six years ago to help solve the
housing crunch.
They were only intended to be
used for five years, according to
Shaw, but that projection was later
expanded to six years. The prob
lem hampering replacement con
struction is the übiquitous "money
question," Shaw says. Previous
plans to build replacement build
ings were dropped for program
ming and financial reason.
While Nelson doubts that the
trailers will survive another 20
years, he says,"I guess we're
going to have them around for a
long while. I suppose they'll be
kept in use as long as they hold
together."
Shaw wants first to determine
whether the present number of
beds on campus reasonably

genuine steel and paint, there will be twice as much space in the Main library. The addition will connect the Main library and the underground stacks in Meyer library.

What might be included in that

Student housing would be vir

Barring some large disaster, stu

Manzanita Park
The prime target ! n the resi
dence system will be replacing
Manzanita Park, according to
Shaw. The trailers, long a
favorite among holders of high

draw numbers, were originally ac
quired as an "emergency action"
six years ago to help solve the
housing crunch.
They were only intended to be
used for five years, according to
Shaw, but that projection was later
expanded to six years. The prob
lem hampering replacement con
struction is the übiquitous "money
question," Shaw says. Previous
plans to build replacement build
ings were dropped for program
ming and financial reason.
While Nelson doubts that the
trailers will survive another 20
years, he says,"I guess we're
going to have them around for a
long while. I suppose they'll be
kept in use as long as they hold
together."

whether the present number of

In 20 years, when you escort your youngster up Palm
Drive to his freshman year at Stanford, will the Farm
look very different to you? Will you be driving your 1996
equivalent of a Buick stationwagon past high-rise
dorms instead of palm trees?
Will the parking lot exodus have re-located the dorms in
Mountain View? Will the computer center still be six miles from
everywhere?
"Well, nobody knows," says Oscar Nelson, Stanford's mas
ter planner. But according to the best forecasts, Stanford will
seem remarkably unchanged 20 years from now.
No new "stars" like Hoover Tower are on the horizon; few
new academic buildings are planned. Your son or daughter
could even be living in the same dorm as you are now. ("See
the dart holes in that closet? Why, I remember back in ... ")
No major construction is even on the drawing boards past
1978. In that year, as many as four different ribboncutting
ceremonies will bring to a close 30 years of continuous con
struction and expansion.
By 1979. workmen will have completed four new buildings-
Frederick Terman engineering, Sherman Fairchild neurc
sciences, Seeley Mudd chemistry and Herbert Hoover Memo
rial — as well as finishing major additions to the Bookstore, the
Main Library and the hospital, according to present plans.
Besides spendmg $2.8 million to expand the Bookstore, the
University needs $20 million to build the Main Library addition
which will be the same size as the present building. The Uni
versity has raised only $8 million, however, for the addition
which will also be connected to the Meyer library underground
stacks. — -



The hospital expansion costs
about S5O million, according to the
Facifities Plan and Capital Fund
ing Forecast: 1976-1981.
There are also plans to refur
bish existing buildings dunng the
next few years, Nelson says.
Building 460, now housing the
Physiology Department, is being
renovated to accommodate the
Computer Science Department.
Physiology will move to the new
neurosciences building, accord
ing to Assoc. Provost Edward
Shaw.
There are plans to renovate the
evacuated History Corner and the
Engineering and Geology Cor
ners when the University can raise
the necessary money.
Problems raising money
Shaw said the University is hav
ing particular difficulty raising the

needed $8 million for the recon
struction of the History Corner.
"We may not be able to recon
struct the History Corner. We still
need to acquire the funds,'' he
admitted.
Once the Engineering Depart
ment moves into the Terman
building (which should be com
pleted in a year), the vacated
space will probably be used for
humanities and sciences. The
most likely departments to move
in are foreign languages or En
glish. according to Shaw.
Shaw says he also hopes to
eventually move the Communica
tion Department into the Quad.
"It would be advantageous to
bring that department closer to the
people with which it deals," Shaw
said.
Once all the immediately
necessary construction and reno

vation of buildings is completed in
the late '70s, the Funding Fore
cast notes that plans for addi
tional buildings for the Music and
Medical Microbiology Depart
ments may begin.
The University has been under
construction continually since
1947.
Since then, the University has
built Stern, Florence Moore, Wil

Graduate School of Business;
Dinkelspiel Auditorium; Tresid

evacuated History Corner and the
Engineering and Geology Cor
ners when the University can raise
the necessary money.
Problems raising money
Shaw said the University is hav
ing particular difficulty raising the

needed $8 million for the recon
struction of the History Corner.
"We may not be able to recon
struct the History Corner. We still
need to acquire the funds,'' he
admitted.
Once the Engineering Depart
ment moves into the Terman
building (which should be com
pleted in a year), the vacated
space will probably be used for
humanities and sciences. The
most likely departments to move
in are foreign languages or En
glish. according to Shaw.
Shaw says he also hopes to
eventually move the Communica
tion Department into the Quad.
"It would be advantageous to
bring that department closer to the
people with which it deals," Shaw
said.
Once all the immediately
necessary construction and reno

vation of buildings is completed in
the late '70s, the Funding Fore
cast notes that plans for addi
tional buildings for the Music and
Medical Microbiology Depart
ments may begin.
The University has been under
construction continually since
1947.
Since then, the University has
built Stern, Florence Moore, Wil
bur and Crothers Halls; the
Physics tank; Vairan labs; the
Pearce Mitchell building; the
Graduate School of Business;
Dinkelspiel Auditorium; Tresid
der Memorial Union; the
Bookstore; the Post Office; Meyer
Library; Maples Pavilion and the
Law school to cite an incom
plete list.
But after 1978 major construc
tion will essentially stop.
"We think it will be a catch

your-breath' period," says Nel
son. "We haven't had a chance to
do as much advance planning as
we'd like, so we would like to use
the time to develop a master
plan."
What might be included in that
master plan?
Student housing would be vir
tually unchanged 20 years hence.
Barring some large disaster, stu
dents will still be living in all the
same dormitories. Row and clus
ter houses should be able to last
that long as well. However, dor
mitories, Row and cluster houses
will need their utility systems up
dated during the 20 years.
Manzanita Park
The prime target ! n the resi
dence system will be replacing
Manzanita Park, according to
Shaw. The trailers, long a
favorite among holders of high

draw numbers, were originally ac
quired as an "emergency action"
six years ago to help solve the
housing crunch.
They were only intended to be
used for five years, according to
Shaw, but that projection was later
expanded to six years. The prob
lem hampering replacement con
struction is the übiquitous "money
question," Shaw says. Previous
plans to build replacement build
ings were dropped for program
ming and financial reason.
While Nelson doubts that the
trailers will survive another 20
years, he says,"I guess we're
going to have them around for a
long while. I suppose they'll be
kept in use as long as they hold
together."
Shaw wants first to determine
whether the present number of
beds on campus reasonably

genuine steel and paint, there will be twice as much space in the Main library. The addition will connect the Main library and the underground stacks in Meyer library.
In 20 years, when you escort your youngster up Palm
Drive to his freshman year at Stanford, will the Farm
look very different to you? Will you be driving your 1996
equivalent of a Buick stationwagon past high-rise
dorms instead of palm trees?
Will the parking lot exodus have re-located the dorms in
Mountain View? Will the computer center still be six miles from
everywhere?
"Well, nobody knows," says Oscar Nelson, Stanford's mas
ter planner. But according to the best forecasts, Stanford will
seem remarkably unchanged 20 years from now.
No new "stars" like Hoover Tower are on the horizon; few
new academic buildings are planned. Your son or daughter
could even be living in the same dorm as you are now. ("See
the dart holes in that closet? Why, I remember back in ... ")
No major construction is even on the drawing boards past
1978. In that year, as many as four different ribboncutting
ceremonies will bring to a close 30 years of continuous con
struction and expansion.
By 1979. workmen will have completed four new buildings-
Frederick Terman engineering, Sherman Fairchild neurc
sciences, Seeley Mudd chemistry and Herbert Hoover Memo
rial — as well as finishing major additions to the Bookstore, the
Main Library and the hospital, according to present plans.
Besides spendmg $2.8 million to expand the Bookstore, the
University needs $20 million to build the Main Library addition
which will be the same size as the present building. The Uni
versity has raised only $8 million, however, for the addition
which will also be connected to the Meyer library underground
stacks. — -



The hospital expansion costs
about S5O million, according to the
Facifities Plan and Capital Fund
ing Forecast: 1976-1981.
There are also plans to refur
bish existing buildings dunng the
next few years, Nelson says.
Building 460, now housing the
Physiology Department, is being
renovated to accommodate the
Computer Science Department.
Physiology will move to the new
neurosciences building, accord
ing to Assoc. Provost Edward
Shaw.
