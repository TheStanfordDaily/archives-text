## Campus won't look different in 1996 
### Dave Ansley Bonny Rodden 
In 20 years, when you escort your youngster up Palm
Drive to his freshman year at Stanford, will the Farm
look very different to you? Will you be driving your 1996
equivalent of a Buick stationwagon past high-rise
dorms instead of palm trees?
Will the parking lot exodus have re-located the dorms in
Mountain View? Will the computer center still be six miles from
everywhere?
"Well, nobody knows," says Oscar Nelson, Stanford's mas
ter planner. But according to the best forecasts, Stanford will
seem remarkably unchanged 20 years from now.
No new "stars" like Hoover Tower are on the horizon; few
new academic buildings are planned. Your son or daughter
could even be living in the same dorm as you are now. ("See
the dart holes in that closet? Why, I remember back in ... ")
No major construction is even on the drawing boards past
1978. In that year, as many as four different ribboncutting
ceremonies will bring to a close 30 years of continuous con
struction and expansion.
By 1979. workmen will have completed four new buildings-
Frederick Terman engineering, Sherman Fairchild neurc
sciences, Seeley Mudd chemistry and Herbert Hoover Memo
rial — as well as finishing major additions to the Bookstore, the
Main Library and the hospital, according to present plans.
Besides spendmg $2.8 million to expand the Bookstore, the
University needs $20 million to build the Main Library addition
which will be the same size as the present building. The Uni
versity has raised only $8 million, however, for the addition
which will also be connected to the Meyer library underground
stacks. — -
