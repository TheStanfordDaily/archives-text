## Key primaries to come

Four Political Science professors here agree r hat
in light of Tuesday s results in the RepuDlican ana
Democratic primaries, next week s votes in Michi
gan and Maryland are crucial for the major conten
ders in both parties.
If President Gerald Ford "doesn't carry his home
state(Michigan)it will raise guestions about the viabil
ity of his candidacy,'' Political Science Department
Chairman Richard Brody commented.
Political Science Professors John Manley, Robert
Horn and Robert Keohane agreed that Ford would
be in serious trouble if he could not carry the state in
which he has been elected to Congress for 13 terms.
Former California Gov. Ronald Reagan's
chances in Michigan appear to depend upon
whether he can induce Democrats who support
George Wallace to cross party lines, a maneuver
which has helped him win recent primaries in Texas
and Indiana.
Whopping percentage
Four years ago Wallace won a whopping 51 per
cent of the vote in the Michigan Democratic primary
the day after he was shot while campaigning in
Maryland.
A recent Los Angeles Times analysis consi
dered the Maryland primary, with 43 electoral votes,
a toss-up. Cross-over votes are not allowed in Mary
land. The same analysis said Ford was leading in
Michigan.
Brody, Horn, Keohane and Manley consider the
Republican nomination up in the air. But Manley
said he has a "hard time conceiving of the Republi

cans dumping i-'ord at this summer s convention
neither candidate nas a clear majority of commi: -;i
delegates entering the convention.
Reagan currently has more than 400 delegates,
about 100 more than Ford. More than 350 selected
delegates are officially uncommitted. A candidate
must receive votes from 1130 delegates o receive
the nomination.
Large blocks
Brody said that he can t envision 'he large Dlock o.
officially uncommitted delegates, including 154 from
New York and 103 from Pennsylvania, supporting
Reagan at the convention. He added that he
couldn't tell how crucial these blocks would be.
Manley noted that if neither candidate emerged
before the convention with enough delegates to win,
the "question will turn on the electability" of the
candidates in November.
He noted that "any perceived true conservative
will do well in the Republican party primaries," com
pared to a candidate perceived as more moderate.
This might help to explain why the most recent
Gallup poll showed 60 percent of the Republicans
favoring Ford, while only 35 percent favored
Reagan despite the fact that Reagan has won five of
the last six primaries.
Keohane noted that the California primary — 167
delegates, winner-take-all, party cross-overs not al
lowed — will be crucial, though probably not fatal, to
either candidate.
The most recent Mervyn Field poll of California
Republican votes showed that Reagan has moved
ahead of Ford.

Democratic nomination sewed up?)
