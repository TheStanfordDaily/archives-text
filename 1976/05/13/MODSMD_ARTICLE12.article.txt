# Round One draw results due Friday
## 
### 
Next fall's housing assignments
will probably not be available unt!
tomorrow, Assoc. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Larry Horton said yes
terday.
The results of the first round ot
the Spring Housing Draw assign
ing undergraduates to on campus
housing were originally due Tues
day.
"I think it's safe to say we'll have
them out by Friday," Horton said,
cautioning that he could give "no
hard and fast deadlines" for hous
ing assignments.
Horton and Phil Curry, staff as
sistant to the registar, pointed to
problems in the computer draw
program as responsible for the de
lay.
Curry said that a new "set of
programs that operate our prog
rams" at the computer center,
known as Program Language 1
(PL 1), had been installed which
could not produce the output of
assignment cards for students,
printouts for residences and hous
ing office statistics.
It was necessary to locate the
PL 1 used previously in the sys
tem's libraries at the computer
center and rerun the program
using the old methods. Curry said.
However, the draw assign
ments themselves were success
fully made, Curry said. "The in
formation was in there, but no one
could get at it not even us." he
said.
Horton said locating the prob
lem in the program and re-running
the output phase of the assign
ment draw took up two days. In
addition he said, the housing of
fice has spent a large amount of
time checking data put in by stu
dents on preference cards and will
check results carefully after a suc
cessful computer readout
"It's not like an assignment for
class where you get an "A for
having 90 percent correct," Hor
ton said. "It has to be totally accu
rate."
