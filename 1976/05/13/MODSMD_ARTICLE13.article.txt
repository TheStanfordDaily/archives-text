# Single women at home: Are they trapped?

From the Associated Press
A chill breeze blew through the
open window Ann reached au
tomatically for the sweater at the
foot of her bed Her mother always
leaves it there.
"Really, I wouldn't know how to
take care of myself if I didn't live at
home," says Ann, a 23-year-old
medical student who, like almost
half of the 8.6 million single
women in this country, still lives
with her family. "It would be very
hard for me to cook, shop and
clean for myself. I've always had
somebody who looked after me."
Carla, a chain-smoking, 34-
year-old school administrator,
lives with her parents on New
York s Long Island Says Carla:
"I'm a much more deve'oped
woman than others with their

freedom and fantastic apartments
because they don't have two
people to come home to who love
and care for them."
'If I got a raise. .
But Laura DiDio, 22, a TV news
assistant who lives in New York
City's Queens, says: "If I got a
raise tomorrow, I'd be out. I want
the independence, the freedom. I
want the phone to ring at 3 a.m.
without worrying about disturbing
somebody."
Ann and Carta and Laura.
Three women of the more than
four million women between 18

and 34 who the U.S. Census
Bureau says lived at home with
parents or relatives as of last year.
Some, such as Ann, seem res
igned to the arrangement for the
time being. They say they want to
leave eventually, but aren't doing
much about it. Others,such as
Carla, have probably, in their early
30s, reached a point of no return
— they will never leave. Parental
illness or old age sometimes
keeps them there. Sometimes
they are just afraid to leave.
Some seem embarrassed or

even ashamed they are still at
home. Both Ann and Carla, for
example, didn't want their real
names used.
But most women at home are
like Laura DiDio. In their late teens
or early 20s, they can't wait to get
out on their own but often find
themselves trapped by
economics — their jobs don't pay
enough.
Despite progress in job oppor
tunities for women, many young
women find only low-paying jobs
which don't permit them to leave
home without a drastic lifestyle

change, specially if they live near
a large city and its high rents.
Old fashioned
Living at home — whether by
choice or circumstance — often
means a more traditional, old
fashioned lifestyle which harks
back to an era when a single
woman living alone was consi
dered sinful.
It means restrictions, curfews,
calls home when you're going to
be late. It may mean no smoking
or drinking. It can even mean mom
and dad insinuating themselves
into your love life or your politics
"I have seen a marked differ
ence between the woman who
lives at home and other single
women in the way they relate to
issues and what's happening in
the outside world." said Ann
Leibermann, an associate profes
sor of education at Columbia Uni
versity's Teacher College.
Says sociologist Gunhild
Hagestad of the University of
Chicago: "Single women who live
with their parents are more likely
to be women who want a more
traditional lifestyle. These women
are not committed to the sinqle
life."
Most psychologists interviewed
said it is extremely difficult for an
adult daughter to remain totally
independent and live comfortably

at home with her parents.
"This is a very chaotic society
we live in. and it may be a practical
accommodation economically,
and it might be a very safe and
intelligent decision for some
women because lonely women
suffer," said Leiberman "But
the question remains: Can you be
emotionally independent and re
main with your parents?"
Big room
"The social restrictions can be
stifling," said a 23-year-old New
York graduate student who didn't
want to be identified.
"It's frustrating, but I have a
beautiful, big room, plus a smal
ler room and a bath. It's very nice
and very clean" and it's wonderful
to come home to people. I
wouldn't like to be alone."
She said living at home allows
her to afford travel and clothes.

somebody who looked after me."
Carla, a chain-smoking, 34-
year-old school administrator,
lives with her parents on New
York s Long Island Says Carla:
"I'm a much more deve'oped
woman than others with their

freedom and fantastic apartments
because they don't have two
people to come home to who love
and care for them."

But Laura DiDio, 22, a TV news
assistant who lives in New York
City's Queens, says: "If I got a

the independence, the freedom. I
want the phone to ring at 3 a.m.
without worrying about disturbing
somebody."
Ann and Carta and Laura.
Three women of the more than
four million women between 18

and 34 who the U.S. Census
Bureau says lived at home with
parents or relatives as of last year.
Some, such as Ann, seem res
igned to the arrangement for the
time being. They say they want to
leave eventually, but aren't doing
much about it. Others,such as
Carla, have probably, in their early
30s, reached a point of no return
— they will never leave. Parental
illness or old age sometimes
keeps them there. Sometimes
they are just afraid to leave.
Some seem embarrassed or

even ashamed they are still at
home. Both Ann and Carla, for
example, didn't want their real
names used.
But most women at home are
like Laura DiDio. In their late teens
or early 20s, they can't wait to get
out on their own but often find
themselves trapped by
economics — their jobs don't pay
enough.
Despite progress in job oppor
tunities for women, many young
women find only low-paying jobs
which don't permit them to leave
home without a drastic lifestyle

change, specially if they live near
a large city and its high rents.
Old fashioned
Living at home — whether by
choice or circumstance — often
means a more traditional, old
fashioned lifestyle which harks
back to an era when a single
woman living alone was consi
dered sinful.
It means restrictions, curfews,
calls home when you're going to
be late. It may mean no smoking
or drinking. It can even mean mom
and dad insinuating themselves
into your love life or your politics
"I have seen a marked differ
ence between the woman who
lives at home and other single
women in the way they relate to
issues and what's happening in
the outside world." said Ann
Leibermann, an associate profes
sor of education at Columbia Uni
versity's Teacher College.
Says sociologist Gunhild
Hagestad of the University of
Chicago: "Single women who live
with their parents are more likely
to be women who want a more
traditional lifestyle. These women
are not committed to the sinqle
life."
Most psychologists interviewed
said it is extremely difficult for an
adult daughter to remain totally
independent and live comfortably

at home with her parents.
"This is a very chaotic society
we live in. and it may be a practical
accommodation economically,
and it might be a very safe and
intelligent decision for some
women because lonely women
suffer," said Leiberman "But
the question remains: Can you be
emotionally independent and re
main with your parents?"
Big room
"The social restrictions can be
stifling," said a 23-year-old New
York graduate student who didn't
want to be identified.
"It's frustrating, but I have a
beautiful, big room, plus a smal
ler room and a bath. It's very nice
and very clean" and it's wonderful
to come home to people. I
wouldn't like to be alone."
She said living at home allows
her to afford travel and clothes.

A chill breeze blew through the
open window Ann reached au
tomatically for the sweater at the
foot of her bed Her mother always
leaves it there.
"Really, I wouldn't know how to
take care of myself if I didn't live at
home," says Ann, a 23-year-old
medical student who, like almost
half of the 8.6 million single
women in this country, still lives
with her family. "It would be very
