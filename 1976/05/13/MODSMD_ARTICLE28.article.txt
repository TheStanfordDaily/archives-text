meets the demands of students
before he begins planning re
placement housing for Manzanita.
However, he could not define
what he meant by "reasonable."
' We are not sure we even know,"
Shaw said. He said he, as well as
members of the Dean of Students
Office and other departments,
would have to get together after
the results of this year's draw are
released to determine what
"reasonable" means.
700 more beds
The long-range plans for the re
sidence system contain a prop
osal for 700 more beds on cam
pus. Since Shaw does not see
student enrollment increasing in
the next few years, the decision to
follow-through with the proposal
will depend on the demand of stu
dents for on-campus housing.
Nelson, however, thinks stu
dents will always want the extra
700 beds. Whatever the housing
choices available, there will al
ways be enough students to fill
them, says Nelson.
He foresees an increase in the
desirability of on-campus living,
as housing in the surrounding
communities becomes scarcer
and more expensive.
Nelson sees student demand
for housing as going through a
"series of fads." At various times,
they have wanted big dorms,
high-rises, apartments, frater
nities and Row houses. There is
no telling what will be popular a
few years from now. It is doubtful,
though, that one 700-bed facility
will be built, Nelson adds.
Where might one find the new
housing in 1996? There are three
likely sites: in Manzanita Park,
behind the Knoll and on an unde
veloped area between Lake
Lagunita and the golf course.
This last possibility offers "ideal
sites" for housing, says Nelson.
While the quail who reside there
now might disapprove, several
acres of land are available to the
University. Access roads and
utilities would have to be provided,
however.
Few new buldings
After you've dropped off junior
at his room, you decide to walk
around campus and reminisce.
You will find few strange sights to
disturb your thoughts. The ivy will
be taller on the law school, of
course, and they might have
found a way to clean the windows

on Meyer by then, but not many
new edifices will block your path.
Not only are there no definite
plans for new academic buildings
during the next couple of decades,
but there aren't even many places
left to put them.
Two rectangles of grass (per
fect for Frisbees) now flank the
Escondido Street entrance to
Meyer. They could be used for a
couple of small buildings.
The weed-filled empty lot field

beside Memorial Auditorium
might be replaced by a companion
drama building.
An expansion for Dinkelspiel
Auditorium is a possibility, al
though an addition planned sev
eral years ago was shelved.
Five separate plots of land
might be used for expansion of the
physics, chemistry or biology de
partments. None of the building
expansion would require remov
ing existing buildings except if the

physics building were expanded.
If it were moved towards Via
Palou, Sequoia Hall may have to
be removed. Nelson explained
Architectural look
Will the new buildings fit into the
present facade?
"We'll probably keep the red tile
roofs," says Nelson. "They re very
practical if installed properly, and
will last indefinitely."
The designs of any new con
struction will be "compatible and
sympatico" with current struc
tures, he says.
One change you will notice in
1996 is an increased emphasis on
wide malls like White Plaza. One
will be constructed soon between
the Storke Publications Building
and the Terman Center.
Planners foresee improvement
of the mall between the Main Lib
rary and the Quad and the crea
tion of an open area where Galvez
Street now exists behind the Main
library.
There will also be an effort to
add more trees to the campus,
Nelson says. Many trees are
dying from the Dutch elm dis
ease and are being replaced.
Bicentennial ginkgos
Also Nelson says the University
is planting 100 ginkgo trees in
groves near the top of the Oval
and in small clusters around cam
pus.
"We are planting them in the
bicentennial spirit," Nelson said,
explaining that one of the trees,
originally found in China, was
planted in the United States in
1876. The ginkgo is "one of the
oldest forms of flora that is exist

ing," Nelson remarked
Where will you park your vehi
cle while you're walking through
the spacious plazas that will re
place today's parking lots?
Most likely somewhere near
Campus Drive, says Nelson. He
predicts that that street will serve
as a "ring-road" surrounding
campus, and that parking will be
concentrated in large lots near it.
"I look for a public transit sys
tem," to carry people from the lots
and dorms to places within the
Campus Drive "circle."
The ring is only three-fourths
completed now Within 20 years,
the final connecting section will
probably be constructed. It would
run from the Medical Center
south-west through some fields
between the golf driving range
and the stables and connect with
the other end of Campus Drive
near Junipero Serra Boulevard.
Between that extension, new
housing, and utilities and access
roads, the Farm could lose a lot of
farm. But Nelson maintains that
one area will never be plowed
under — the Arboretum. We'd
like to maintain that as our front
yard'."
The master planner reports that
alumni who return to Stanford
after many years say that despite
the amount of construction this
campus has seen, it still looks
familiar.
Considering the few changes
likely to be made in the next
couple of decades, you should
have no trouble showing your
youngsters around Stanford when
they arrive.

HOOVER'S NEXT ERECTION—This schematic drawing artfully

under construction next to the pay parking lot and the Lou Henry
Hoover building, will look like when completed.
