Primary campaigns continue
DETROIT — Democrats and Republi
cans seeking votes in the next round of
presidential primaries criss-crossed the
country yesterday. President Ford and
Rep. Morris Udall were in Michigan, a cru
cial testing ground for both.
Ford, who lost his sixth primary in Neb
raska on Tuesday, began a series of ap
pearances in the Detroit area.
Udall also campaigned in Detroit where
he got an enthusiastic welcome from 250
striking rubber workers.
Yet to win his first primary, Udall said
Sen. Frank Church's first-place finish in
Nebraska showed that Carter was more
vulnerable than many people thought.
Ford, meanwhile,promised to "look at a
large number of people" as potential vice
presidential nominees. He said earlier he
would not rule out Reagan for the second
spot on the ticket.
Reagan, in Kansas City, said he did not
want to be Ford's running mate, nor did he
think Ford would accept a place on a
Reagan ticket.
The President said he had "done a good
job' in the White House and said his new
campaign slogan of " peace, prosperity and
trust" is "a good program."
On the Democratic side, California Gov.
Edmund G. Brown Jr. was renewing his
campaign in Maryland, trying to prove Car
ter's vulnerability in that state, which also
holds its pnmary next Tuesday.
Carter campaigned in Maryland yester
day morning. His schedule also included a
New York City meeting with Democratic
Gov. Hugh Carey, who has yet to endorse
any candidate.
New earthquakes jolt Italy
UDINA, Italy, — Seven new tremors
jolted northeast Italy yesterday panicking
people and crumpling more homes. An ex
pert said aftershocks from last week's mas
sive earthquake could continue for months.
One of the new tremors registered a

strong 5.4 on the Richter scale. No new
casualties were reported, but the jolts col
lapsed another batch of old one-and two
story stone houses in Gemona, a town of
6000 in the eastern Alps foothills.
At the Trieste Observatory, a seis
mologist declared that the end of the after
shocks following last Thursday's major ear
thquake was nowhere in sight.
The official casualty toll stood at 914
dead, 3000 injured and nearly 90,000
homeless.
Tax crackdown on wealthy?
WASHINGTON — The Senate Finance
Committee voted yesterday to close a
loophole that allows many wealthy Ameri
cans to escape the income tax.
By a 10-0 vote, the panel approved a
package that would benefit upper-bracket
Americans who now pay a hefty tax and
would assure that rich investors who now
avoid taxation will pay some tax.
The committee's version however, is
somewhat more favorable to rich Ameri
cans than is the plan approved by the
House.
The committee, working on a broad
House-passed tax bill, voted to toughen the
minimum tax, which was enacted in 1969 to
reach wealthy nontaxpayers, and to loosen
the maximum tax to benefit those rich per
sons who already are paying a large
amount in taxes.
Separate trial for Hearst
LOS ANGELES — A judge said yester
day that Patricia Hearst will not stand trial
with her former fugitive traveling compan-

ions, and agreed to hear possible evidence
that the convicted heiress is incompetent to
enter a plea in the case.
Hearst was passive and expressionless
at her first meeting with William and Emily
Harris since their capture last September.
She stood mute, refusing to enter a plea,
and Superior Court Judge Mark Brandler
scheduled a possible hearing May 28 on
her mental competency.
The hearing, however, was dependent
on her attorney's ability to produce witnes
ses — presumably private psychiatrists —
to speak of her mental state.
IRS: enough campaign money
WASHINGTON — One of every four tax
payers is contributing to the presidential
campaign fund this year, apparently assur
ing sufficient funds to finance the campaign,
according to Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) figures.
The tax contributions to the fund could
total at least $95 million for the four tax
years of 1972 to 1976.
The funds could be flowing to the candi
dates again less than 24 hours after Presi
dent Ford nominates the members of the
new Federal Election Commission. Ford
signed the new election law Tuesday and
the nominations could come as early as
today. Confirmation by the Senate has to
come next.
Packers bribed inspectors?
WASHINGTON — The Army's practice
of paying up to $3.85 a pound for beef —

some substituted by lower grades after
meat packers bribed Army inspectors —
was defended yesterday by key Army offi
cials.
In an exchange with Sen. Lawton Chiles
Col. Edgar Eckermann chief of the
Army's Veterinary Sciences Division, said
the military pays more for beef because it
insists only on the best.
The testimony was before Chiles' Gov
ernment Operations subcommittee, which
is probing what Chiles has called a
multimillion-dollar military meat fraud.
Meanwhile, attorneys for officials of twc
defunct packing houses being investigated
by the subcommittee said the reputations of
their clients had "been smeared for the
sake of publicity" by the panel.
