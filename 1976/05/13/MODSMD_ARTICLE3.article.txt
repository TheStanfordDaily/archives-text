# Prop. 15 misinterpreted

Carolyn Kovacevic's article on Proposition 15 in
the Daily May 5 is full of inconsistencies caused by
either voluntary or involuntary misinterpretations of
the text of the initiative. Let me mention three of
these.
First, stop this noise about the pretended "per
manent shutdown" effect of Prop. 15. The proposi
tion demands no such thing. Section 67503(b) reads
"(A nuclear fission power plant may be permitted
land use in California if) (1) the effectiveness of all
safety systems, including but not limited to the
emergency core cooling system, of any nuclear fis
sion power plant operating or to be operated in the
State of California is demonstrated, by comprehen
sively testing in actual operation substantially simi
lar physical systems, to the satisfaction of the Legis
lature and (2) the radioactive wastes from such a
plant can be stored or disposed of, with no reasona
ble chance, as determined by the legislature. . of
intentional or unintentional escape of such waste or
radioactivity into the natural environment."
The proposition later continues, "Unless the
Legislature determines that it is reasonable to ex
pect that the conditions specified in Section 67503
(b) will be met, then nuclear fission power plants
shall be a permitted land use in California only if
such existing plants and such plants under construc
tion are operated at no more than 60 percent of their
licensed core power level."
The fact that the decision rests with the reasona
ble judgment of the legislature clearly demonstrates
that Prop. 15 is far from being a permanent ban on
nuclear fission power. Rather I wonder what makes
Kovacevic so sure that the safety requirements
suggested by the proposition will not be met.
Liablity
Second, she discusses the problem of liability
(Sect 67503 (a) of Prop. 15) in case of accidents,
and she compares the operation of the nuclear
power system with a single isolated structure like the
Golden Gate Bridge: this is simply dishonest.
Although I believe that civil engineers are much
better able to master the safety component of a
bndge than that of a single nuclear plant, this cer
tainly does not prevent bridge failures leading to
major accidents.
However, a bridge failure is always a "limited"
accident which will not affect the life and health
(cancer, malformations) of thousands of people for
years to come, as it would if radioactive materials
were to escape from a damaged nuclear plant, or
from a leaking storage facility, or from as yet non
existent reprocessing plant or simply from a truck
damaged in a common traffic accident! (If present
plans are carried out. there will be in the year 2000
some 100,000 truckloads of radioactive materials
traveling the U.S. highway network.)
A nuclear accident at any of the links of the pro
cess is by nature an "unlimited" accident. But the
insurance coverage is limited for the nuclear indus
try thanks to the Price-Anderson Act (ceiling $560

million), although estimates of possible damage
from a nuclear plant accident range around $15
billion.
Why? Contrary to what Kovacevic believes,there
is assurance of full compensation for people using
the Golden Gate Bridge should an accident occur,
as there is for hazardous industries such as chemi
cal manufacturing. Even car insurance policies pro
vide unlimited coverage! If the nuclear industry is so
sure of the safety of its product, why not put its
corporate assets behind it?
Testing installations
Finally, concerning the testing of nuclear installa
tions, please again refer to the text of Prop. 15, Sect.
67503(b)( 1) which speaks of "comprehensively test
ing in actual operation substantially similar physical
systems, to the satisfaction of the Legislature..ln
other words a physical simulation of the system
close enough to reproduce actual operating condi
tions would be required.
Such tests have already been planned for some
time at the government s LOFT (Loss of Fluid Test
ing) reactor in Idaho. These tests should be carried
out, not put off. I do not know if the aeronautic
industry test-crashes its aircraft prototypes, but I do
know that auto manufacturers conduct extensive
and comprehensive test-crashes of their cars
(especially with Nader looking over their shoulders),
and I believe cars are safer today.
No, in fact Prop. 15 is not a trouble-making mea
sure for the nuclear industry provided that that in
dustry will accept that it is time to stop playing with
the lives and the health of the public and will decide
to work in earnest on the safety of its operations.
Prop. 15 would simply ensure a time-schedule for
that. More importantly the proposition allows the
public, through its elected representatives, to par
ticipate in a process which is sure to affect the lives
of many generations to come.
What do you prefer? A peaceful, careful, com
prehensive and reasonable set of decisions by the
people's representatives (hence you and me), or the
bombing of nuclear plant construction sites, like in
France, or sit-ins by 20,000 people, like in Germany,
with police involvement and the possibility of vio
lence?
