## Lebanese labels 
### 
The civil strife in Lebanon has
been raging for over a year now
and throughout this period the
U.S. media have portrayed the
conflict as one between Christians
and Moslems. These labels are
completely misleading and aim to
give the impression that no two
different religious communities
can coexist in the Arab world.
The role of the CIA is not to aid
one party against another as
Jonathan Marshall claims in his
April 23 Daily column. Its aim is to
use the situation for the global
strategic aims of U.S. diplomacy
as illustrated by the following two
examples which are very close to
the Lebanese case in time and
space.
First, in 1974, the CIA-backed
Greek junta sent few training of
ficers to Cyprus who instigated a
coup against Archbishop
Makarios in order to achieve union
with Greece, thus setting the
stage for the Turkish invasion
which went unopposed by the Un
ited States. This, in turn, led to the
return to democracy in Greece by
getting rid of the embarassing ally
which the colonel's regime had
become.

Second, the same CIA "helped"
the Kurds in Iraq through the Shah
of Iran and then withdrew its sup
port as soon as an agreement was
reached between Iraq and Iran.
This has been the lot of many
minorities who have been used as
pawns in the big power chess
game.
In November 1974, when Yaser
Arafat of the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) was at the Un
ited Nations tribune, he gave his
response to Zionism by bringing
up the example of Lebanon as a
country where different religious
groups could coexist.
The conservative regimes
in the Middle East find their in
terests converging with those who
want to liquidate the Palestinian
problem by involving them into the
internal affairs of Lebanon, hoping
to "fix" them there definitely.
Now, a final question deserves
to be asked: Are we witnessing
the "solution" to the Palestinian
problem being implemented in
Lebanon in the same way that the
Jewish problem in Europe was
"solved" in Palestine?
