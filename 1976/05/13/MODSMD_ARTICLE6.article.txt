## Finch stresses 'experience' 
### Kathryn Ma Jeff Tanji 
"Of the 10 Republican and nine
Democratic candidates that are
running, I am the only one who
has run and won a statewide elec
tion," California Republican can
didate for U.S. Senate, Bob Finch,
said yesterday at a campaign ap
pearance at Bowman Grove.
"I have held local, state and
federal office, but what I would like
to stress is that most of my life has
been spent in the private sector —
as a lawyer and in corporations,"
the former California Lt. Governor
said.
Finch, a former Secretary of
Health, Education, and Welfare
under Richard Nixon, spoke
primarily about the other candi
dates in the race for the senate
chair.
"Mr. (5.1.) Hayakawa (former

President of San Francisco State
University) is an extraordinary in
dividual, profoundly bright, but
also turning 70 in July," he com
mented.
"The question is, can he carry a
vigorous campaign against
Senator John Tunney? Can he
hold more than one term of office?
The senate is a system built on
seniority; I don't regard it very
strong for a candidate to run for
only one term and not be able to
build up the clout of seniority."
He later explained that he used
Tunney's name as the probable
Democratic candidate for the se
nate because Tunney has the ad
vantage of incumbency. He ad
ded, however, that he would be
"happy to face either Tunney or
Hayden."
Finch declined to endorse any

Republican candidate for the
presidency, although he did
offer an opinion on Jerry
Brown's bid for the Democratic
nomination.
"When you are governor of
the largest state in the nation,"
said Finch, "you are entitled to
go on whatever ego trip that
you want."
He added that Brown has not
yet attended to several
"chores" in the state. "I don't
think that it is fair that he should
go around saying how much
has been accomplished in
California when he has over
250 appointments yet to
make," claimed Finch.
Finch responded to ques
tions of state and national in
terest in an interview at KZSU
after his talk in Bowman Grove,
suggesting that big govern
ment and big business must be
"held accountable" to the indi
vidual citizen for their actions
on all levels of government.
He advocated bringing

health care and welfare prog
ram administration to a state
level, noting that "the federa'
system of health is just too un
wieldly. When you bring in the
feds to monitor the system,
ihen you run into problems."
Finch's social agenda in
cludes an examination of
California's energy priorities.
He has endorsed a "no" vote
on Proposition 15, the Nuclear
Safeguards Initiative, because
it "is simply unenforceable."
He also advocates votes in
favor of California Propositions
one and four, both school bond
issues, but warned that state
funds being channeled into
educational institutions must
also take into account a de
crease in the birth rate of the
American population.
"Until we get these and other
problems sorted out," he said,
"we will still find ourselves in
the state of neo-isolationism,
with our bodies pulled back in
the fetal position safely behind
the American image."

seniority; I don't regard it very
strong for a candidate to run for
only one term and not be able to
build up the clout of seniority."
He later explained that he used
Tunney's name as the probable
Democratic candidate for the se
nate because Tunney has the ad
vantage of incumbency. He ad
ded, however, that he would be
"happy to face either Tunney or
Hayden."
Finch declined to endorse any

Republican candidate for the
presidency, although he did
offer an opinion on Jerry
Brown's bid for the Democratic
nomination.
"When you are governor of
the largest state in the nation,"
said Finch, "you are entitled to
go on whatever ego trip that
you want."
He added that Brown has not
yet attended to several
"chores" in the state. "I don't
think that it is fair that he should
go around saying how much
has been accomplished in
California when he has over
250 appointments yet to
make," claimed Finch.
Finch responded to ques
tions of state and national in
terest in an interview at KZSU
after his talk in Bowman Grove,
suggesting that big govern
ment and big business must be
"held accountable" to the indi
vidual citizen for their actions
on all levels of government.
He advocated bringing

health care and welfare prog
ram administration to a state
level, noting that "the federa'
system of health is just too un
wieldly. When you bring in the
feds to monitor the system,
ihen you run into problems."
Finch's social agenda in
cludes an examination of
California's energy priorities.
He has endorsed a "no" vote
on Proposition 15, the Nuclear
Safeguards Initiative, because
it "is simply unenforceable."
He also advocates votes in
favor of California Propositions
one and four, both school bond
issues, but warned that state
funds being channeled into
educational institutions must
also take into account a de
crease in the birth rate of the
American population.
"Until we get these and other
problems sorted out," he said,
"we will still find ourselves in
the state of neo-isolationism,
with our bodies pulled back in
the fetal position safely behind
the American image."

"Of the 10 Republican and nine
Democratic candidates that are
running, I am the only one who
has run and won a statewide elec
tion," California Republican can
didate for U.S. Senate, Bob Finch,
said yesterday at a campaign ap
pearance at Bowman Grove.
"I have held local, state and
federal office, but what I would like
to stress is that most of my life has
been spent in the private sector —
as a lawyer and in corporations,"
the former California Lt. Governor
said.
Finch, a former Secretary of
Health, Education, and Welfare
under Richard Nixon, spoke
primarily about the other candi
dates in the race for the senate
chair.
"Mr. (5.1.) Hayakawa (former

President of San Francisco State
University) is an extraordinary in
dividual, profoundly bright, but
also turning 70 in July," he com
mented.
"The question is, can he carry a
vigorous campaign against
Senator John Tunney? Can he
hold more than one term of office?
The senate is a system built on
seniority; I don't regard it very
strong for a candidate to run for
only one term and not be able to
build up the clout of seniority."
He later explained that he used
Tunney's name as the probable
