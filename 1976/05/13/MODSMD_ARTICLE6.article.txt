"Of the 10 Republican and nine
Democratic candidates that are
running, I am the only one who
has run and won a statewide elec
tion," California Republican can
didate for U.S. Senate, Bob Finch,
said yesterday at a campaign ap
pearance at Bowman Grove.
"I have held local, state and
federal office, but what I would like
to stress is that most of my life has
been spent in the private sector â€”
as a lawyer and in corporations,"
the former California Lt. Governor
said.
Finch, a former Secretary of
Health, Education, and Welfare
under Richard Nixon, spoke
primarily about the other candi
dates in the race for the senate
chair.
"Mr. (5.1.) Hayakawa (former

President of San Francisco State
University) is an extraordinary in
dividual, profoundly bright, but
also turning 70 in July," he com
mented.
"The question is, can he carry a
vigorous campaign against
Senator John Tunney? Can he
hold more than one term of office?
The senate is a system built on
seniority; I don't regard it very
strong for a candidate to run for
only one term and not be able to
build up the clout of seniority."
He later explained that he used
Tunney's name as the probable
Democratic candidate for the se
nate because Tunney has the ad
vantage of incumbency. He ad
ded, however, that he would be
"happy to face either Tunney or
Hayden."
Finch declined to endorse any
