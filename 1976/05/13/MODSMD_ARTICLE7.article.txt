# USE election petition reaches halfway mark
## 
### Bill Sing 
A petition circulating among
workers in the bargaining unit of
the United Stanford Employees
(USE) requesting that the Na
tional Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) conduct an election
among the workers to determine
whether they still wish to be rep
resented by USE in collective bar
gaining now has over 275 signa
tures, according to Physical Sci
ences and Engineering Techni
cian Geoff Jones, coordinator of
the petition drive.
The petition needs approxi
mately 420 signatures, or 30 per
cent of USE's bargaining unit by
July 2 in order to be validated by
the NLRB, according to Jones.
An election was held in 1973 in
which USE was originally certified
as the bargaining agent for vari
ous technical, maintenance and
service workers employed by the
University.
USE is currently in the process
of negotiating a new contract with
the University. The NLRB only
permits decertification elections
when the contract of the union in
question expires.
New workers
"In the '73 election there were
some 460 votes against USE, and
about 300 didn't vote at all," Jones

said. "And since then some 100
new workers have been hired and
have had to join the union. There
fore, we feel that another vote,
either for no union or a vote of
confidence for the union, is in or
der."
"A lot of workers feel the USE is
not doing a good job of represent
ing them."
Jones said that if the petition
drive succeeds "it will let (USE
President Jim) Berk and the union
know that within the bargaining
unit there is some dissatisfaction.
We hope that then he will bargain
in good faith."
Bargaining stance
Jones said that a lot of support
behind the petition drive lies in
discontent with the union's current
bargaining stance with the Uni
versity.
"I don't think there's a doubt in
the world that the union will be
going on strike," said Jones.
"Just look at their contract de
mands. A $1858 retroactive
cost-of-living payment to each
worker would amount to $2.5 mill
ion in a single payment from the
University.
Their new minimum wage de
mand of $774 per month is an
$188 increase over the present
minimum wage.

"The union is also asking that
each worker be given 20 days
paid vacation per year, 15 days
paid sick leave per year, 48 hours
(or 6 full work days) personal time
oft per year plus 10 days paid holi
days per year. This amounts to 51
days that workers will be paid but
not actually working, or roughly
one in every five days each year.
Economic suicide
"For the University to accept
these demands would be
economic suicide." he <;airl
"We just want a vote amont the
workers to see if this is really what
they want the union to be doing for
them," said Laboratory Mechanic
Albert Ames.
USE President Jim Berk noted
that if the union were to win by a
large margin, its position would be
a lot stronger. A smaller percen
tage, said Berk, would probably
lessen the likelihood of a strike.
Higher-paid workers
Jones said that most of the sup
port so far shown for the petition
has been from higher-paid work
ers, primarily technicians, and
workers at SLAC.
"But an awful lot of workers ha
ven't heard about the petition,"
added Jones.
