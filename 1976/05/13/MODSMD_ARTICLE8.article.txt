# Fuchs: 'folk hero' of health world
## Health economics specialist at med school 
### Loie Sauer 
When public health care and public health
economics are discussed these days, the name
Victor Fuchs often creeps into a dialogue as a
point of unity between people who otherwise dis
agree on many issues.
Consumer and community groups have made
him almost a folk hero; medical school students
and faculty frequently quote him; people in
Washington, D.C. take his suggestions very
seriously.
In 1975 the health economics specialist cap
tured national attention with his book Who Shall
Live?— Health, Economics and Social
Choice.
Fuchs, 52, holds a joint appointment as pro
fessor of economics here and of community
medicine at the Stanford Medical School. He is
also co-director of the western branch of the Na
tional Bureau of Economic Research.
Demanding load
It's a demanding load for any person to carry,
but Fuchs manages to do it, looking both relaxed
and dynamic as he makes good impressions all
around.
A friend describes the 6-foot-5 former New
Yorker as "a big man and very charismatic. At a
cocktail party he's likely to be the center of one of
the circles."
Another friend said, "He's not the stereotype of
a superintellectual professor; he's a professional
as well as an academic person."
Fuchs says of himself, "I wasn't very scholarly
when I was young. In fact, I was a very mediocre
high school student. I started life as a
businessman and went back to graduate school
when I was 26."

Who Shall Live? is Fuchs' first book written for
the general public. In it he concludes that we can
make better choices as a nation to improve the
quality, efficiency and accessibility of health
care.
Future health
His recommendations for future health policy
include national health insurance, competition
among alternative health plans and greater use
of non-physician health personnel.
The present system of payment for health care
is a significant factor in overall health costs,
Fuchs says in Who Shall Live?
Most doctors in America are now paid on a
fee-for-service basis he says. The doctors, who
make the decisions regarding drugs, surgery and
hospitilization, may prescribe unnecessary
treatment, causing an increase in medical and
insurance costs.
Alternatively, there is no personal incentive for
a doctor to prescribe treatment not called for by
medical necessity in prepaid health systems so
costs tend to be lower, he concludes.
Tremendous reviews
"The book has gotten tremendous reviews,"
Fuchs said. "It's had a lot of impact in
Washington and in medical schools. It's very
gratifying to think that many people arereadingit,
especially a lot of young people and a lot of
doctors.
"The doctors think I've been fair," con
tinued, "and that I understand the problem. So
many books are written with anger and hostility to
the medical profession. They realize that when
I'm critical it's not because I'm angry, hostile or
jealous. That seems to come through."
