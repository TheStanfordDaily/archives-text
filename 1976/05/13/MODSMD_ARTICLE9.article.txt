# Heat wave hits campus
## 
### 
Afternoon temperatures in the mid-90s yesterday made sun
bathing and swimming the only tolerable pursuits on campus.
Out-of-service chilled-water units at the University's central
refrigeration system, which provide air conditioning for most of
the major buildings on campus, did not help. Utilities Manager
Robert Mc Knight said air conditioning in the Cummings Art
Building and teaching as well as office portions of the new Law
School had to be shut down during the day.
Cooler temperatures predicted for tomorrow, he said, may
help matters and added that he plans to keep all buildings air
conditioned as long as possible tomorrow before cutting anyone
off.
