# Presidential candidates invited
## 
### Kathryn Ma 
Six presidential hopefuls have been
invited to attend a candidates'forum
next Thursday as part of a week-long
program organized by the Stanford
Committee on Political Education
(SCOPE).
The days May 18-21 have been de
signated as "political orientation
week" by students actively involved in
the 1970 presidential campaign who
want to "awaken the political con
sciousness of the Stanford commun
ity."
Democratic candidates Jerry Brown.
Jimmy Carter, Frank Church and Mor
ris Udall and Republican candidates
Cerald Ford and Ronald Reagan have
been contacted through the ASSU
Speakers Bureau and SCOPE in the
hope that they will take part in the
program, "Campaign *7(> — Presiden
tial Perspectives."
A schedule of "Campaign '76" ac
tivities issued by the SCOPE staff
states that "written confirmation (that
they will appear here) has been re
ceived from Carter, Udall and
Church."
No guarantees
However, students who head indi
vidual campaign Organizations on
campus agree that no absolute guaran
tees from the candidates have been
secured.
Shea Dixon, campus coordinator ot
Carter's campaign in northern Califor
nia, clarified the situation. "We have
received a confirmation of the possi
bility" that Carter will appear, Dixon
said, adding that "part of what every
thing is lingering on is the Maryland
primary."
He noted that if that primary,
scheduled for next Tuesday, is a close
race between California Gov. Jerry
Brown and former Georgia Gov. Jimmy
Carter, Carter may visit Stanford in
order to drum up support "in Brown's
home territory."
Annette Lantos, head ot the Frank
Church for President Committee, de
nied that her organization has received
any written promise that Church will
come to the orientation program.
Strong possibility
"I'm afraid there isn't a written con
firmation that Church is going to ap
pear." said Lantos, although there is "a
very strong possibility that he will."
An active leader in Morris Udall's
campus campaign, Jeff Boot he. ex
pressed doubt that Udall will show.
"Don't count on it." said Boothe,
adding that "to my knowledge we
didn't receive any (written confirma
tion)."
"It's hard to say if they ever did or
didn't confirm," said SCOPE Co
chairman Rick Weber. "The schedule
is very, very tentative," he explained,
blaming the shaky situation on the rise
and fall of primary results.
'Zero chance'
"With Udall, it's a 50-50 chance (he
will come)," Weber added, but noted
that there is "zero chance" that Carter.
Brown, Ford and Reagan will attend,
although "prominent representatives"
will most likely appear in their places.
Last minute schedule changes have
brought added attractions to the prog
ram. Former California Gov. Edmund
Brown will be speaking in Tresidder
270 on Wednesday afternoon.

OPEN TRUSTEE MEETINGS?—LegaI Adviser to the President James Siena is
currently investigating whether a state open meetings act is applicable to the
University. If it is decided that the University must comply with the state act.
then Stanford's trustees could be required to hold open meetings except under
certain circumstances.
ford Democrats, "Campaign 76" was
broadened to include bipartisan ac
tivities.
The Stanford Republicans, the
ASSU Senate and Speakers Bureau,
the American Studies Student Associ
ation and student committees for the
individual candidates are among the
many groups that have pledged their
support for the program.
Six presidential hopefuls have been
invited to attend a candidates'forum
next Thursday as part of a week-long
program organized by the Stanford
Committee on Political Education
(SCOPE).
The days May 18-21 have been de
signated as "political orientation
week" by students actively involved in
the 1970 presidential campaign who
want to "awaken the political con
sciousness of the Stanford commun
ity."
Democratic candidates Jerry Brown.
Jimmy Carter, Frank Church and Mor
ris Udall and Republican candidates
Cerald Ford and Ronald Reagan have
been contacted through the ASSU
Speakers Bureau and SCOPE in the
hope that they will take part in the
program, "Campaign *7(> — Presiden
tial Perspectives."
A schedule of "Campaign '76" ac
tivities issued by the SCOPE staff
states that "written confirmation (that
they will appear here) has been re
ceived from Carter, Udall and
Church."
No guarantees
However, students who head indi
vidual campaign Organizations on
campus agree that no absolute guaran
tees from the candidates have been
secured.
Shea Dixon, campus coordinator ot
Carter's campaign in northern Califor
nia, clarified the situation. "We have
received a confirmation of the possi
bility" that Carter will appear, Dixon
said, adding that "part of what every
thing is lingering on is the Maryland
primary."
He noted that if that primary,
scheduled for next Tuesday, is a close
race between California Gov. Jerry
Brown and former Georgia Gov. Jimmy
Carter, Carter may visit Stanford in
order to drum up support "in Brown's
home territory."
Annette Lantos, head ot the Frank
Church for President Committee, de
nied that her organization has received
any written promise that Church will
come to the orientation program.
Strong possibility
"I'm afraid there isn't a written con
firmation that Church is going to ap
pear." said Lantos, although there is "a
very strong possibility that he will."
An active leader in Morris Udall's
campus campaign, Jeff Boot he. ex
pressed doubt that Udall will show.
"Don't count on it." said Boothe,
adding that "to my knowledge we
didn't receive any (written confirma
tion)."
"It's hard to say if they ever did or
didn't confirm," said SCOPE Co
chairman Rick Weber. "The schedule
is very, very tentative," he explained,
blaming the shaky situation on the rise
and fall of primary results.
'Zero chance'
"With Udall, it's a 50-50 chance (he
will come)," Weber added, but noted
that there is "zero chance" that Carter.
Brown, Ford and Reagan will attend,
although "prominent representatives"
will most likely appear in their places.
Last minute schedule changes have
brought added attractions to the prog
ram. Former California Gov. Edmund
Brown will be speaking in Tresidder
270 on Wednesday afternoon.
