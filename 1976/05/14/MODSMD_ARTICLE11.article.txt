It's that time of year again.
Spring football is over and the usual four
or five players are, or soon will bfe, going
under the knife to repair unnecessary in
juries sustained in the past four weeks of
"meaningful evaluation" by the coaching
staff. Everyone has hung up his cleats
until late summer and the rail-birds have
gone home for awhile. Ah, and yes, it's time
for speculation on next fall's football en
deavors and who will be the team's quarter
back.
Having been a not-too-active participant
in the grid scene here in recent years, I've
always marveled at this time of year, mainly
because of the benevolent attitude adopted
by usually vindictive sports writers towards
the events revolving around Card football
these last couple of seasons. The about-face
they assume is really astounding to me, and
to be honest, I don't believe it is merited.
For instance, take Jeff Parietti's article in
the May 5 Daily. In his infinite optimism, he
assumes that Jor some unknown reason this
coming year ip going to differ radically from
the past two. Sorry Jeff, I wish I could share
your convictions. Here's why I can't.
First off, despite the fact that next sea
son's squad, personnel-wise, is probably
better than either of the University's most

recent Rose Bowl teams, the three factors
which have kept the last two teams from
going to Pasadena are still around: namely,
Mike Cordova, Guy Benjamin and Jack
Christiansen.
'Quarterback controversy'
Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying
the first two are personally responsible, and
maybe not the third. What I am saying is that
as long as the infamous "quarterback con
troversy" continues, Stanford's chances of
going south on New Year's day for more
than a vacation are about as good as a 20
percent decrease in tuition next year. In
other words, no football team can function
at top performance in the Pac-8 conference
while playing musical QBs.
Secondly, not only do such mind games
play havoc with the offense, as is readily
observable both from the field and the
stands, they also affect the performance of
the defense. That is to say this approach of
"guess who will play next" hurts the whole
team, and I know that from personal experi
ence.
Thus, if it hurts the team, it hurts recruit
ing, alumni input (both moral and monet
ary) and fan support. In short, it hurts the
entire athletic program. With all that going

against you, it seems hard to conceive o!
roses for the football team next season.
Constructive suggestions
So what's a mother to do? Save for Glenn
Dickey (who really is a mother!), few have
had any constructive suggestions. At the
risk of losing some of my 1
hereby submit a solution to Jack Christian
sen.
Think.
It is as simple as that. Think of what it is
that has overwhelmed the Cardinal gridiron
squad. Think of what potential exists in that
team. And most of all think of who the hell
the quarterback is; pick him and play him. If
Christiansen is honest with himself, he will
play the right one. And even if he doesn't,
he will still have the chance to substitute in
time to save games and possibly the season.
At worst he will have the satisfaction of his
convictions, which to date have been
somewhat obscure. Uninviting as it may
seem, now is the time to make that choice.
Whether wrong or right it must be made
before the start of next season.
It's going to be a long hot summer for
Chris, and since he is basically a sincere
man I wish him luck, for his sake and
everyone else's concerned.

maybe not the third. What I am saying is that
as long as the infamous "quarterback con
troversy" continues, Stanford's chances of
going south on New Year's day for more
than a vacation are about as good as a 20
percent decrease in tuition next year. In
other words, no football team can function
at top performance in the Pac-8 conference
while playing musical QBs.
Secondly, not only do such mind games
play havoc with the offense, as is readily
observable both from the field and the
stands, they also affect the performance of
the defense. That is to say this approach of
"guess who will play next" hurts the whole
team, and I know that from personal experi
ence.
Thus, if it hurts the team, it hurts recruit
ing, alumni input (both moral and monet
ary) and fan support. In short, it hurts the
entire athletic program. With all that going

against you, it seems hard to conceive o!
roses for the football team next season.
Constructive suggestions
So what's a mother to do? Save for Glenn
Dickey (who really is a mother!), few have
had any constructive suggestions. At the
risk of losing some of my 1

It is as simple as that. Think of what it is
that has overwhelmed the Cardinal gridiron
squad. Think of what potential exists in that
team. And most of all think of who the hell
the quarterback is; pick him and play him. If
Christiansen is honest with himself, he will
play the right one. And even if he doesn't,
he will still have the chance to substitute in
time to save games and possibly the season.
At worst he will have the satisfaction of his
convictions, which to date have been
somewhat obscure. Uninviting as it may
seem, now is the time to make that choice.
Whether wrong or right it must be made
before the start of next season.
It's going to be a long hot summer for
Chris, and since he is basically a sincere
man I wish him luck, for his sake and
everyone else's concerned.

It's that time of year again.
Spring football is over and the usual four
or five players are, or soon will bfe, going
under the knife to repair unnecessary in
juries sustained in the past four weeks of
"meaningful evaluation" by the coaching
staff. Everyone has hung up his cleats
until late summer and the rail-birds have
gone home for awhile. Ah, and yes, it's time
for speculation on next fall's football en
deavors and who will be the team's quarter
back.
Having been a not-too-active participant
in the grid scene here in recent years, I've
always marveled at this time of year, mainly
because of the benevolent attitude adopted
by usually vindictive sports writers towards
the events revolving around Card football
these last couple of seasons. The about-face
they assume is really astounding to me, and
to be honest, I don't believe it is merited.
For instance, take Jeff Parietti's article in
the May 5 Daily. In his infinite optimism, he
assumes that Jor some unknown reason this
coming year ip going to differ radically from
the past two. Sorry Jeff, I wish I could share
your convictions. Here's why I can't.
First off, despite the fact that next sea
son's squad, personnel-wise, is probably
better than either of the University's most

recent Rose Bowl teams, the three factors
which have kept the last two teams from
going to Pasadena are still around: namely,
Mike Cordova, Guy Benjamin and Jack
Christiansen.
'Quarterback controversy'
Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying
the first two are personally responsible, and
maybe not the third. What I am saying is that

troversy" continues, Stanford's chances of
going south on New Year's day for more
