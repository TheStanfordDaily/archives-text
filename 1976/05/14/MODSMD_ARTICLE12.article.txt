Many students have com
plained that a Stanford educa
tion is not practical; it offers little
more than a prestigious diploma
and a mountain of debt. To
counter this deficiency, some
individuals have suggested that
the University offer classes to
prepare its wards for the "out
side world." Class suggestions
have ranged from auto
mechanics to xylophone repair.
These classes might be benefi
cial for the Stanford masses. If
these "practical" classes are in
ftituted, the first one should
teach geography to native
Californians. One can always tell
a native Californian by his in
abiliy to name or describe any
thing in that amorphous void
east of Lake Tahoe.
The class would be called,
"Remedial Geography for Native
Californians," and would be re
quired for all the indigenous de

nizens of Beach Boy Land. This
class would try to sort out the
various components that consti
tute the term "back East." As an
innovative first here, this
class will offer neither a Marxist
nor a feminist perspective.
Even Stanford's native
Californians, who are the pick of
the herd and the cream of the
crop, lack the most cursory
knowledge of lands beyond the
San Joaquin. One learned Stan
fordite from California warned
me not to travel too far east on
Interstate 80 because 1 might
"fall off the edge of the world
and be swallowed by sea
monsters."
Some of you might be uncon
viced that such a class is needed,
bet me prove my case. I'm from
Minnesota. Ask a non-
Californian what he knows about
Minnesota and you will get an
answer like this:

"Minnesota, the 32nd state,
was admitted to he Union in
1858. The state is bordered by
Wisconsin, North and South
Dakota, lowa, Canada and Lake
Superior. The state population is
3,917,000 and the capital is St.
Paul. The state contains 15,291
lakeland is home to the Mayo
Clinic, Tonka Toys, Hubert
Humphrey, John Denver and
Bob Dylan."
If you ask a native Californian
what he knows about Minnesota,
you will get a variety of answers:
"Minnesota is cold."
"Minnesota is part of
Canada."
"Minnesota is by New York"
(the 14th colony?).
"Minnesota is where Mary
Tyler Moore lives."
"Minnesota?"
The main purpose of the class
would be to shatter popular
Californian myths about the rest

of the United States. The class
would show that Pensacola is
not a Florida soft drink, that
Cheyenne is not a bashful lass
from the Rockies, that Michigan
is not a French tire company and
that Vermont is not a martini in
gredient.
The biggest practice of
Californians hoped to be cor
rected by this innovative class
will be to stop the prostitution of
the term "East." Referring to ev
erything from Nevada to Dela
ware as "back East" is an unfor
givable sin to most non-
California ns.
If Stanford pioneers this class,
educators all over California, yes
even all over the world, vvill
marvel at the University's in
novative trailbla/.ing in practical
education. This class might very
well put Stanford on the map.
