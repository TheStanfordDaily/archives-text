# Drought threatens California

SACRAMENTO (AP) — Californians
looking for fun in the sun this summer bet
ter get out early and enjoy it while they can.
It's possible that boaters, bikers, campers,
hunters and fishermen could be up a dry
creek, so to speak, because of the near record
drought.
After the Fourth of July holiday, boaters
may find even longer lines for launching
boats, and they may even find themselves in
strange-looking surroundings: islands
where there used to be plenty of room for
skiing.
Consequences
At lakes and reservoirs, the shorelines
will be farther from the parking lots — as
much as a quarter of a mile in some spots.
Deer hunters this fall may find less public
land open for stalking.
Fishermen should wet their lines early,
because late summer trips could be rather
disappointing, says George McCammon,
head of inland fisheries for the state De
partment of Fish and (lame.
Overall, thanks to California's system of
dams, California's sportsman's paradise
will survive this year's drought. That's the
consensus of experts. But they also say
another dry year will create, as McCammon
put it. "a tragedy."
It already has been a bum year for many
snow skiers. The resorts around Lake Tahoe
have closed for skiing early, most of them
running out of good snow about Easter
time.
What can the camper and hiker expect?
Fire hazards
Northern California woodsmen may ex
perience what southern Californians find as
routine: late summer restrictions because of
fire hazards.
"In some parts of southern California
there are standard closures." says Ross Wri
ter of the U.S. Forest Services, which ad

ministers 22 million acres of land, one-fifth
of the state.
"It's now possible there will be some
northern California forest areas, on a situa
tion basis, restricted."
That would affect the woodcutter, the
hiker, the off-road vehicle enthusiast and
the hunter.
"It could have a real impact on hunters,"
said Writer, looking ahead to the September
deer season.
State parks
As far as state parks are concerned, the
drought should have no major impact, says
Larry Payntor of the StateParksand Recrea
tion Department.
However, just Wednesday the state had to
close Mt. Diablo in the east San Francisco
Bay area because the heat wave and lack of
rainfall combined to create an extremely
high fire danger.
"All of our lakes are expected to be still
navigable, at least through the Fourth of
July," Payntor said. "Some of the launch
ramps will be below the water line later on
in the summer and into the fall."
Southern Californians generally will be
better off, ironically, than their normally
wetter northern neighbors, says Dave Pelgen,
who oversees recreation on the "world's
longest fishing stream."
That's the more than 400 miles of the
California Water Project aqueduct open to
fishing. Pelgen said the southern California
reservoirs will be in fine shape all year, but
those to the north will be drawn down.
"Fish will survive the summer nicely in
the reservoirs," said Pelgen. There are 20
reservoirs in the system, and somefour mill
ion Californians have fun at them annually.
"I'm sure many northern Californians
say. 'Not only do the southern Californians
get all our water, they have all the fun in a
dry year, too,' " Pelgen said, adding he

doesn't want to start a civil war.
Jerry King of the U.S. Bureau of Reclama
tion said one of the hardest hit lakes from
the drought is Folsom, near Sacramento.
"We expect Brown's Ravine to be out of
the water by the middle of July, and that's a
principal recreation area," he said.
Where lakes have two or three boat
launching ramps, there may be one reach
ing the water by the middle of the summer,
he said.
However, at Lake Shasta, he said, "resort
owners complain there has been no beach.
This year they're going to have some
beach."
About the usual 12 million visitors are
expected to utilize waters behind federal
dams this year, King said.
Southern Calfornians who play on the
Colorado River will have no problems. King
said, because "all those storms that sailed
right over California wound up in the Col
orado River range."
Officials are urging boaters to watch out
for snags and islands in lakes where they've
always been well below the water level in
past years.
California's three million fisherman may
have a bonanza, if they go out early.
Good news
"The good news first," says McCammon.
"We don't see there will be any impact at all
on high elevation lakes. They will be in
good shape.
"There will be quite a few of the reservoirs,
both trout and warm water, drawn down
appreciably, and that probably will make
fishing pretty good."
He added however that the normal clear
water of late summer will be accentuated
this year, making fish extremely wary of
anglers.
"Take my advice, and plan to fish early,"
he said.
