will be filed against freshmen James Dodd and
Michael McKenna for strongarm robbery, the
preliminary charge the two men were booked
on Tuesday.
A third pledge arrested, a 17-year-old stu

juvenile authorities. Spokesmen tor both the

district attorney's office and the Juvenile Au

a minor's status violates state law.
Zeta Psi President Brian Avery said Tuesday

gathering decorations for a fraternity luau this

Palo Alto police have said one of the pledges

seeing them removing lamps from the El Pes
cador seafood restaurant.
Legal Adviser to the President James Siena
