husband, Neil,quoted her as say

"Even when 1 stick to lettuce
leaves and other foods supposed
to be slimming, 1 keep getting
fatter," she told her husband.
"If it goes on like this, it'll
mean 1 went through hell for no

thing. But I'm not going back to
having my jaws stuck together."
Mrs. Turner, the mother of two
normal-sized daughters, made
headlines when she decided to
trim her 44-32-44 figure by hav

International

places like the United States,
Canada, Italy, India and Ceylon
wrote to her asking for advice.

and some persons still write to
her.

again Mrs. Turner has been on a
special high-protein diet of eggs,
cheese, milk and salads. She
