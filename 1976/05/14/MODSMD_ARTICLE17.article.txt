A year or sougo, you published a ( olumn outlin
ing the requirements for Phi Beta Kappa AI
though I harbor no illusions about my chances for
obtaining one of those priceless gold kc\ s. I won
dered whether you could reprint the column.
A.A.H.
Certainly. That long-ago column (tin* present
staff's first, by the way) ran like this
Brilliant students who've taken "Exposition"
and "Human Sexuality" to fulfill distribution re
quirements should forget about Phi Beta Kappa,
according to Don Price, the organization's secret
ary.
Students must have "substantive courses" in
the humanities, social sciences and natural sci
ences. And to make sure that no prospective Phi
Beta Kappan is sneaking through the University
taking the standard micks, a committee: of shi
dents in the organization painstakingly
scrutinizes each transcript.
But this is only part of a long, laborious process
to ferret out the so-called "cream of the crop" of
each Stanford class. The search begins after
winter quarter when a computer list identifies
those students in each department with ,i grade
average of 3.40 or higher, and the number of ex
pected degrees in each department.
Only 12 percent of any class can be in Phi Beta
Kappa. A few are elected as juniors (those "obvi
ously superior") and the rest as seniors. There
fore. a committee reviews the list and knock-; oft
those elected as juniors. After that the top 12 per
cent of each department (by grade average) is de
termined. Occasionally, one department has
slightly more or less than 12 percent.
From here, the 3.40 list goes to ,i department
representative who identifies those students i on
sidered most outstanding (up to 12 percent of the
department). The representative may solicit let
ters from faculty if he feels that he cannot evaluate
certain students.
But this isn't the end. Within each department

the top transcripts of 20 percent of its students are
pulled. Here's where the all-important mick
checking comes in. The student committee re
views the anonymous transcripts and submits its
recommendations for the top 12 percent.
The various recommendations finally arrive at
their hallowed destination — the officers of Phi
Beta Kappa, a committee of four faculty members.
They review everything, and make their choices.
Price admits that the whole process is ex
tremely subjective. Courses like sculpture, paint
ing or music performance are eliminated because
they are "talent courses." And there apparently
isn't a consensus on what a "talent course" is.
Price said that he might classify creative writing
courses this way, although others on the commit
tees might not.
"We're getting into very thin ice ht• re."he ad
mitted.
The committees also get into great trouble with
SCIRE courses, honors essays, independent study
and directed reading. And transfer students may
well be out of luck.
"If they're transferring from Harvard, we can
say 'Well, that's kind of good.' But if they transfer
from Ohio State, we don't know," said Price.
Activities play no part in selection of Phi Beta
Kappa members. And, interestingly enough,
neither does a 4.0 grade average.
"Let's face it. It's pretty easy to get straight 'A's
at Stanford now," Price said.
It you were somehow overlooked by this magi
cal, mystical process, what can you do? If you're a
junior, you can spend your next few quarters fran
tically taking "substantive courses" outside your
department. If you're a senior, you can petition for
reconsideration as 17 unfortunates did last year.
But if you don't make it, don't give up hope.
Believe it or not, lots and lots of non-Phi Beta
Stanford graduates have been extremely success
ful. And most of them lead normal lives, too.
