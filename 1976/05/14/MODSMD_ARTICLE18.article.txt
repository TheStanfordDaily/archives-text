Relatively new to the area, Liaison
Restaurant on El Camino Way in Palo Alto
specializes in French and Italian cuisine.
Their dishes primaily use land animals,
with a seafood item listed occasionally. The
decor on the interior suggests a villa in Italy
or Southern France. Tables are covered with
white tablecloths, and the dim lighting adds
a touch of refinement. Service is pleasant
and the tuxedoed waiters are helpful with
any questions. Since Liaison is fairly new,
the silence early in the evening is notice
able, but on towards 7() (on a weeknight,
assuredly earlier on weekends), the tables
begin to fill and the atmosphere becomes
much more congenial.
A choice
Bypassing the appetizers, we managed to
sample both the soup du jour and the salad,
though usually one is offered a choice be
tween the two. The cream of celery soup is
smooth and flavorful.
The salad, prepared in thedining area, is
also tasty, with freshly ground pepper and a
house herb dressing. Lettuce was a bit on
the non-crisp side, but not to an extreme.

Also in the pre-entree lineup is the ever
present bread and butter, mentioned only
because it was a bit tough-crusted — chewy,
to say the least.
The entrees of our choice were the noi
sette of lab with a dijonaise sauce, and the
pepper steak. Both were commendable. The
lamb comes in two chunks, each wrapped
with a bacon strip, and covered with the
mild, but very appetizing, dijonaise sauce.
European tradition
In the European tradition the lamb is on
the rare side, contrary to American practices
of cooking it until well-done. The pepper
steak is similarly rare, but totally differet in
taste.
In anoter tableside production, the steak
is quickly braised a la flambe, with heat
from a small sterno. Then, after removing
the steak and leftover liqueur from the pan, a
gravy is quickly heated and added over the
meat just prior to serving. The pepper aroma
and taste penetrated the whole piece of beef.
While a distinctive dish, it isn't overly spicy
or hot — just an excellent means of enjoying
the true flavor of pepper.
We noted items other patrons were

ordering; there was quite a bit of tableside
preparation. It's always nice to be able to
have some entertainment while dining out
and also comforting to see what goes into
the food that goes into you.
For dessert we tried the caramel custard
and cassata alia Sicilian, adding a touch of
the Italian to our primarily French dinner
thus far. The custard is a modest portion,
with a hint of caramel in the sauce.
The cassata isn't quite so simple. Under
the chocolate frosting were four thin layers
of pound cake. For interlayer filling there
was a fruit mixture, which, questioning re
vealed, included more than a touch of Tri
ple Sec. A delicious combination of flavors,
though needless to say, quite rich.
Overall. Liaison is well under way for one
so new. The entrees range from under $7 to
$9, excluding the Chateaubriand for two.
The portions are medium sized, and gener
ally tender cuts of meat. One can easily
enjoy the salad, the dinner and the dessert
without being unpleasantly stuffed. Do
watch out for the bread. Desserts are extra,
and with the entree sizes, are probably in
order.
