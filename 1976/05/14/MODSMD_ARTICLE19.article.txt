# Try Magic Pan for great crepes
## 
### 
For a switch from the French, Spanish, American or whatever
cuisine, The Magic Pan offers crepes that run the gamut. With
restaurants in San Mateo, San Jose and San Francisco at Ghirar
delli Square and at Sutter Street, you can catch a crepe coming or
going, before or after a show, etc.
The whole idea of The Magic Pan is that anything you might get
on a plate somewhere else, you get in a crepe here. And, if you go at
noon at most of these locations, you can watch the crepes being
made with their special revolving "magic pans," a patented
method.
Dinner can get under way with a drink and hors d'oeuvres while
waiting in the lounge. Once seated, perhaps a salad would be in
order, paticularly as you see others getting portions of only two
crepes. But don't be misled. The crepes are filling, and if you are
tempted by any of the desserts, you might not want to fill up on
salad. However, it is a good salad if you decide to have one.
For the entrees, the crepes come filled with ham, chicken, beef
bouguignon. seafood, mushrooms and more. For the indecisive,
you can choose one from each of two varieties. We sampled the
beef, chicken, spinach souffle and mushroom.
The spinach and mushroom were by far the best. The chicken
tasted more like a chicken pot pie, and the beef had an odd twist to
it. The spinach, in fact, was favored, with a light filling, not totally
masking the delicate taste of the crepe.
For dessert, the variety is just as tempting. We narrowed down
the choices to the mocha crepe and the strawberry crepe supreme.
Both were delicious. The mocha crepe had a scoop of vanilla ice
cream and mocha sauce in a hot crepe, topped with whipped
mocha cream and some bittersweet chocolate.
The crepe idea is what makes The Magic Pan different. Good
service, hanging plants, the old-Europe drindles on the waitresses,
can be found at other places. But the main thing is the crepe.
