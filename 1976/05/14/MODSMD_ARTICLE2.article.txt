# Closed trustee meetings illegal?
## 
### Kathy Batts 
The President's Office is investigat
ing the possibility that the University
may be violating state law by conduct
ing closed meetings of the Board of
Trustees.
The California Ralph M. Brown Act
requires that meetings of local agen
cies and the governing bodies of those
agencies be open to the public.
A 1967 amendment to the act ex
pands the definition of "local agency"
to include "all private nonprofit or
ganizations that receive public money
to be expended for public purposes
pursuant to the (federal) 'Economic
Opportunity Act of 1904.' "
Legal Adviser to the President James
Siena said yesterday that the"research
administration"!n the Office of Busi
ness and Finance is "looking into" the
question of possible University viola
tions of the act.
Lynne Mason, assistant director of
financial aids in charge of work-study,
confirmed yesterday that the Univer
sity does receive federal funding for
the work-study program here under
the Higher Education Act of 1965. The
1975-76 grant to Stanford totals
$315,000, Mason said.
Uncertain funding
Mason and other University officials
were uncertain whether the University
receives direct funding from the
Economic Opportunity Act of 1964.
Robert Simmons, manager of the
Sponsored Projects Office here, said,
"Many times we're not sure of our
funding's source."
However, Robert Vandagriff, man
ager of funds and general accounting,
said "I'm sure we do" when asked if
Stanford receives funds under the act.
Vandagriff did not specify particular
grants or their amounts.
"To find those records would take a
four-day staff search," he explained.
In 1968, Congress amended the

Higher Education Act of 1965 to place
all work-study funding under the au
spices of that act, rather than under the
Economic: Opportunity Act of 1964.
The 1966 amendment also states
that "any reference to any provision of
(the work study-program of) the
Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 in
any law of the United States shall be
deemed to be a reference to the corres
ponding provision of (the work-study
program of) the Higher Education Act
of 1965 as amended by this section."
Siena said the matter was brought to
his attention April 29.
"At the moment we're looking into
it,"he said. "There are a lot of am
biguities written into the Brown act,
such as the phrase.'public purposes.'
What does that mean? There's also the
question of whether the Economic
Opportunity Act is still on the books,
since the Office of Economic Oppor
tunity (OHO) has been dismantled."
Mason said the funding for the
work-study program is now adminis
tered through the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare. Other
OEO programs are now under the au
spices of the Community Services
Administration.
Interpretation
Santa Clara County Deputy District
Attorney Albert Bender said that in
terpretation of the Brown Act was up
to the attorneys for the individual
agencies.
"If they decide it applies to them,
then they've got to comply. If they de
cide it doesn't apply to them, well,
then they take their chances," he said.
Bender reiterated that anyone violat
ing the Brown Act is guilty of a mis
demeanor.
Reporters for the University of
Southern California (USC) Daily Tro
jan were barred enlrv into the April 14
USC Board of Trustees meeting by the
trustees there.
Daily Trojan Editor Sherry Stern
claims that USC does fall under the
Brown Act as a "local agency," since
she has been informed that USC re
ceives several grants totaling at least
$600,000 under the Economic Oppor
tunity Act of 1964.
Decision expected
Stern said the matter has been
turned over to the Los Angeles city
attorney's office for investigation. A
decision as to whether the city will
take the case is expected this week, she
said.
Stern added that the Daily Trojan
may sue the university if the city attor
ney refuses to take action. The Univer
sity publishes the Daily Trojan.
"Just because they serve as our pub
lisher doesn't mean they don't have to
comply with the law," Stern said.
The final issue of the Daily Trojan
for this academic year appears today.
The meetings of both the Board of
Regents of the University of California
and tin* Trustees of theCalifornia State
Colleges and Universities are open to
the public.
The Brown Act does allow a local
agency to hold executive sessions
which are closed to the public. Execu
tive sessions include "the appoint
ment, employment or dismissal of an
officer or employee or to hear com
plaints or changes brought against
such officer or employee by another
officer, person or employee unless
such officer or employee requests a
public hearing."

"At the moment we're looking into
it,"he said. "There are a lot of am
biguities written into the Brown act,
such as the phrase.'public purposes.'
What does that mean? There's also the
question of whether the Economic
Opportunity Act is still on the books,
since the Office of Economic Oppor

Mason said the funding for the
work-study program is now adminis

Health, Education and Welfare. Other
OEO programs are now under the au

Administration.
Interpretation
Santa Clara County Deputy District
Attorney Albert Bender said that in
terpretation of the Brown Act was up
to the attorneys for the individual
agencies.
"If they decide it applies to them,
then they've got to comply. If they de
cide it doesn't apply to them, well,
then they take their chances," he said.
Bender reiterated that anyone violat
ing the Brown Act is guilty of a mis
demeanor.

Daily Trojan Editor Sherry Stern
claims that USC does fall under the
Brown Act as a "local agency," since
she has been informed that USC re
ceives several grants totaling at least
$600,000 under the Economic Oppor
tunity Act of 1964.
Decision expected
Stern said the matter has been
turned over to the Los Angeles city
attorney's office for investigation. A
decision as to whether the city will
take the case is expected this week, she
said.
Stern added that the Daily Trojan
may sue the university if the city attor
ney refuses to take action. The Univer
sity publishes the Daily Trojan.
"Just because they serve as our pub
lisher doesn't mean they don't have to
comply with the law," Stern said.
The final issue of the Daily Trojan
for this academic year appears today.
The meetings of both the Board of
Regents of the University of California

The Brown Act does allow a local
agency to hold executive sessions
which are closed to the public. Execu

officer or employee or to hear com
plaints or changes brought against
such officer or employee by another
officer, person or employee unless
such officer or employee requests a
public hearing."
The President's Office is investigat

may be violating state law by conduct

The California Ralph M. Brown Act
requires that meetings of local agen

agencies be open to the public.
A 1967 amendment to the act ex

to include "all private nonprofit or

to be expended for public purposes
pursuant to the (federal) 'Economic

Lynne Mason, assistant director of
financial aids in charge of work-study,
confirmed yesterday that the Univer
sity does receive federal funding for
the work-study program here under
the Higher Education Act of 1965. The
1975-76 grant to Stanford totals
$315,000, Mason said.
Uncertain funding
Mason and other University officials
were uncertain whether the University
receives direct funding from the
Economic Opportunity Act of 1964.
Robert Simmons, manager of the
Sponsored Projects Office here, said,
"Many times we're not sure of our
funding's source."
However, Robert Vandagriff, man
ager of funds and general accounting,
said "I'm sure we do" when asked if
Stanford receives funds under the act.
Vandagriff did not specify particular
grants or their amounts.
"To find those records would take a
four-day staff search," he explained.
In 1968, Congress amended the

Higher Education Act of 1965 to place
all work-study funding under the au
spices of that act, rather than under the
Economic: Opportunity Act of 1964.
The 1966 amendment also states
that "any reference to any provision of
(the work study-program of) the
