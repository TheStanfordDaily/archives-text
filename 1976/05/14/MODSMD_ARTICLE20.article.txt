# Butterfield's offers a diverse menu, fine food

### 
Up El Camino Real in Menlo Park, Butterfield's
Restaurant sits just off the road on the right.
Perhaps less well known than many of its
neighboring competitors, Butterfield's presents a
diverse menu, fine foods and a pleasant atmos
phere, without going overboard for elegance. The
result is a more relaxed, casual dining area, with
out becoming commonplace.
Heading up the selection of entrees is a list of
many seafood dishes. Among them is the abalone
almondine — definitely good, tender, and best of
all, lots of it.
Prawns recommended
Following the seafood choices are shellfish, beef
and poultry. Recommended by our waiter are the
prawns.
My selection was the medallion of beef with a
bernaise sauce. Again, a most generous portion of
tender beef, cooked tci order, with a fine, subtle
bernaise sauce. Each of the two five-ounce
medallions were served atop a round of toast.
With the entrees were crisply fried, small,
whole potatoes and a tomatoe provencale —
cooked and stuffed with cheese. Both were indeed
tasty meal companions.
Preliminary salad
Also included in the price of the entree is a
preliminary salad, with a choice of dressings The
salads are fairly standard; the bleu cheese dres
sing was suitably loaded with chunks of cheese.
Aside from the entrees, we enjoyed appetizers
and dessert. For the former we chose both the bay
shrimp cocktail and the prawn cocktail. The

prawn cocktail was somewhat unsatisfying with
only five prawns, leaving the dish with much
cocktail sauce and parsley. The bay shrimp
cocktail, by contrast, came filled with many tiny
bay shrimp, a better choice. On the post entree side,
we went for the strawberries maison and the
cheesecake. The strawberries were abundant,
with a soupy sauce, and topped with a dab of
cream. The cheesecake was good, but perhaps too
much after such a large entree.
Just the entree
While looking over Butterfield's menu, don't
feel compelled to order much more than the en
tree. These range from $7 to $9-plus, the portions
are well sized — so you get lots of whatever you
ordered.
But beyond that, unless you have an extremely
large appetite, the extra $2.50 or more,.for ap
petizers, add about the same for a dessert, tend to
overstuff.
A better idea might be to select your entree and
choose from among their ample wine list for
something suitable, and enjoy that much of the
meal. Then, if still yearning for more, try a dessert.
Though not exceptional, they will cetainly not
detract from the fine entrees.
A final word on Butterfield's — the service is
very good, with friendly, helpful waiters who
are sharp but not too hasty. And something I par
ticularly enjoyed was a good sturdy steak knife for
cutting the meat. Perhaps not the latest in sterling
silver, but I much preferred slicing off bite sizes of
beef insead of sawing off chunks.
