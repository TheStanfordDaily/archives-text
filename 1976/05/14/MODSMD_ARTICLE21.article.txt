# Labor Department reveals computers to aid job-hunters
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The
government is going into the
computer-dating business, but
for jobs not mates.
Within a few years, you will be
able to walk into a U.S. Employ
ment Service office and feed an
application into a computer.
Zap, it will tell you where in the
United States there is a job for
you.
The Labor Department an
nounced yesterday it is going
ahead with a five-year effort to
develop and install a nationwide
computer system to match job
seekers with job openings. The
computer also will be used to
speed the processing of un
employment insurance claims.
The job-matching system has
already been tried in a few cities
on an experimental basis.

In Portland, Ore., for example,
employers can place a job order
with the local government
employment office and have its
computer search the file for
compatible applicants.
On the other hand, individu
als looking for a job can walk in,
give a clerk information about
their work experience, educa
tion and skills, and receive a
printout of appropriate job open
ings.
Instant job referral
William Kolberg, an assistant
secretary of labor, said the sys
tem will provide instant or over
night service in job referrals on a
local and statewide basis when it
is completely in operation in any
state.
He said when all states are tied
in, a job seeker in Boston eventu

ally will be able to learn about a
job opening in San Francisco.
The job matching system is
scheduled to be completed
nationwide in five years. How
ever, in three years the comput
ers will be able to process un
employment insurance claims.
The total cost: estimated at
more than $100 million.
Criticism
During the recession, the gov
ernment job agency was
criticized for delays in proces
sing claims and in finding jobs
for the unemployed. Surveys
showed employers looking for
skilled workers were reluctant to
list job openings with employ
ment offices because they said
the referrals often were unqual
ified.
The new computer system

drew criticism even in the plan
ning stage. Private, fee-charging
employment agencies have ex
pressed concern that it will cut
into their business.
In Milwaukee, one of the cities
where an experimental compu
ter job-matching program has
been tried, Rep. Bob Kasten (R
-VVis.) questioned its effective
ness.
