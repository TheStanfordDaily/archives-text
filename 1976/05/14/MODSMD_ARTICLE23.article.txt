# Bell makes bid for Senate
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — It is late morning at
the San Fernando Valley country club and Al
phonzo Bell, Republican congressman, mil
lionaire ex-oil man and U.S. Senate hopeful, is
delivering the speech.
It is the same talk he'll give later at another
country club, before another Republican wo
men's group, and Bell is proceeding "like a
knife through butter," as one newsman puts it.
The speech is a good one for the conservative
audience: a blast at defense budget cuts by the
Democratic controlled Congress and the Ford
administration's Soviet policy.
Detente
"Even now the Soviets are moving re
lentlessly to build a global empire," he says."I
think the idea that true detente has occurred
between our nations is a sham."
Then comes the clincher, the message that
Bell hopes the GOP women will heed and pass
on to others: Democrat John Tunney must be
defeated in November and Bell, with 16 years
in Congress, is the best one to do it.
The pitch might be called the experience
factor and Bell mentions it several times in
speeches and interviews during the long day of
campaigning.

It is what distinguishes him from the other
three major candidates in a June H Republican
primary where differences in views often are
measured in millimeters — if they exist at all.
Best prepared
"I personally like the other candidates," he
says. "But in this particular year, for this par
ticular office, against this particular Democrat,
I think I am the best prepared to lead the Re
publican campaign.
"I know John Tunney. I have had more ex
perience in the U.S. Congress than all of the
other candidates combined — including
Tunney. ..
Actually Bell andTunneyand the only can
didates on either side who have served in Con
gress.
"I have been able to be as thorough as I have
been on the issues because I have been working
with them for 15 years."
There is probably no way to tell how heavily
the experience factor will weigh with Republi
can voters on June 8, but Bell is long on it.
But despite the long congressional record
the 61-year-old lawmaker is not well known
outside the inner Republican party circles and
the Los Angeles area.
