# Coastline policy too costly?
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) —
Thousands of construction jobs
and millions of dollars in wages
have been lost already because of
restrictions set up to save
California's coastline, a building
industry report said yesterday.
The report said that each year
from 1973 to 1975, from 20.000
to 28,000 construction industry
jobs were lost because of con
trols imposed by the 1972 state
Coastal Zone Conservation Act.
Ben Bartolotto, director of the
Construction Industry Research
Board of Los Angeles, estimated

the total loss between $800 mill
ion and $1.1 billion in building
activity because of permit de
nials. mandatory project modifi
cations, project withdrawals and
projects "not attempted" due to
tighter regulations.
The loss in market value of
those projects was between $1.1
billion and $1.5 billion for the
three-year period, the survey
said.
"The decline in building ac
tivity attributed to coastal regu
lations has not been offset by in
creased building activity

elsewhere in the state," the re
port said, adding that the losses,
in wages, building activity and
market values amounts to "a net
loss to the entire state's
economy."
Melvin Carpenter, executive
director of the South Coast Reg
ional Coastal Zone Commission,
said he can't dispute the overall
thrust of the report, "except they
haven't shown the positive side.
They say how many jobs we have
cost them. Nowhere do they
point out how many man-days or
man-years we have authorized.
"Building permits issued in
the coastal zone are as high as
200 percent over 1973, so to me
that doesn't sound like it's cost
ing them jobs," Carpenter said.
"We have had a big surge in
applications for construction in
the zone. The rate of approval is
running at about 98 percent.
We've had very few refusals this
year," Carpenter remarked.
"Those are awfully big num
bers," said Los Angeles County
Supt. of Building John Mauld
ing. "There's no question that
certain construction has been af
fected along the coastline," but
he declined to verify the figures.
The study contended that the
regulatory precedents set by the
state coastal commission anH its
six regional commissions would
cause greater losses over the next
decade.
"Should the existing regula
tions now governing coastline
construction remain essentially
the same, the calculated loss in
building activity from now
through 1985 would be between
$3.4 billion and $4.5 billion,"
said Bartolotto.

certain construction has been af
fected along the coastline," but
he declined to verify the figures.
The study contended that the
regulatory precedents set by the
state coastal commission anH its
six regional commissions would
cause greater losses over the next
decade.

construction remain essentially
the same, the calculated loss in
building activity from now
through 1985 would be between
$3.4 billion and $4.5 billion,"

LOS ANGELES (AP) —
Thousands of construction jobs
and millions of dollars in wages
have been lost already because of
restrictions set up to save
California's coastline, a building
industry report said yesterday.
The report said that each year
from 1973 to 1975, from 20.000
to 28,000 construction industry
jobs were lost because of con
trols imposed by the 1972 state
Coastal Zone Conservation Act.
Ben Bartolotto, director of the
Construction Industry Research
Board of Los Angeles, estimated

the total loss between $800 mill
ion and $1.1 billion in building
activity because of permit de
nials. mandatory project modifi
cations, project withdrawals and
projects "not attempted" due to
tighter regulations.
The loss in market value of
those projects was between $1.1
billion and $1.5 billion for the
three-year period, the survey
said.
"The decline in building ac
tivity attributed to coastal regu
lations has not been offset by in
creased building activity

elsewhere in the state," the re
port said, adding that the losses,
in wages, building activity and
market values amounts to "a net
loss to the entire state's
economy."
Melvin Carpenter, executive
director of the South Coast Reg
ional Coastal Zone Commission,
said he can't dispute the overall
thrust of the report, "except they
haven't shown the positive side.
They say how many jobs we have
cost them. Nowhere do they
point out how many man-days or
man-years we have authorized.
"Building permits issued in
the coastal zone are as high as
200 percent over 1973, so to me
that doesn't sound like it's cost
ing them jobs," Carpenter said.
"We have had a big surge in
applications for construction in
the zone. The rate of approval is
running at about 98 percent.
We've had very few refusals this
year," Carpenter remarked.
"Those are awfully big num
bers," said Los Angeles County
Supt. of Building John Mauld
ing. "There's no question that
certain construction has been af
fected along the coastline," but
he declined to verify the figures.
The study contended that the
regulatory precedents set by the
state coastal commission anH its
six regional commissions would
cause greater losses over the next
decade.
"Should the existing regula
tions now governing coastline
construction remain essentially
the same, the calculated loss in
building activity from now
through 1985 would be between
$3.4 billion and $4.5 billion,"
