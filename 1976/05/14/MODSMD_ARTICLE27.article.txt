# Klamath tribe strives to hold territory

### 
CHILOQUIN, Ore. (PNS) — On a hilltop
above Chiloquin, Ore., Edison Chiloquin,
grandson of a Klamath chief, threw hay, a
pinecone and willowsticks into a firepit
and set them ablaze.
From his pouch he sprinkled a mixture
of kinni-kinnick (native American to
bacco), berries and seeds into the fire. To
participants in the ceremony he said the
fire was sacred and will keep burning
until the land of his grandfather's people
is restored to them.
Edison Chiloquin is the only Klamath
to refuse payment for tribal territory
liquidated since the 1954 Termination
Act. A check for $108,000 waits for him in
the U.S. National Bank of Portland;
Chiloquin leaves it there.
Sacred land
"To me the land is sacred, the money
can't replace it,"he said.
Of the 1.3 million acres acknowledged
as Klamath country by an 1864 treaty
signed by his grandfather, Chief Tselakin,
Chiloquin wants a 640-acre parcel put
back in the status of the original treaty
lands to be recognized as Klamath
native American land for all time to
come.
That parcel, known as the Arrowhead,
is bounded by a three-and-a-half mile
bend of the Sprague River and represents
what was once the center of the Plaikni
(Klamath) Nation. It was the site of his
grandfather's village, Ktai-Tupaksi
(Standing Rock).
Told of the perpetual fire there, Robert
Mezger, forestry management expert for
the U.S. National Bank, remarked,
"They'll have a long time to wait."
Chiloquin, 52, has already waited. The
Termination Act gave all Klamaths listed
on tribal rolls before 1954 the choice of
individually selling their claim to part of
the reservation or retaining land under a
trust arrangement.
Twenty-two percent of the Klamaths

eligible chose land instead of cash; Chief
Tselakin's grandson was among them.
Trustees
When U.S. National became trustee
over the remaining tribal lands 15 years
ago it announced plans to develop an
"ideal forest over a 30-year period." even
tually yielding as much as 40 million
board feet annually.
The shareholders in this multimillion
dollar estate had no say in what the bank
did with Klamath land since the trustees,
Mezger maintained, "have to take re
sponsibility for what happens." While
the bank made $92,000 a year for manag
ing the ponderosa forest, the trust's be
neficiaries received less than $100 a year
each.
Meanwhile the federal termination
money was having a devastating impact
on the Klamath community. Per capita
payments of $43,000 to the 78 percent of
the tribe which had sold its claims created
bitter resentments between those born be
fore 1954 and their younger brothers and
sisters, who received nothing.
Young Klamaths dropped out of school
and left home. Businessmen rushed to
Chiloquin to sell refrigerators to people
whose homes lacked electricity; luxury
cars and snowmobiles to a people unac
customed to saving money.
While some Klamaths squandered vast
sums, others, receiving no payments,
were unable to make a living. The murder
rate among Klamaths shot upward. Sud
den affluence proved destructive to
native American lives.
In 1969 the Klamaths who had not sold
out their membership in the tribe voted to
end the trust agreement with the bank.
They intended to set up another trust that
would better serve their intersts by put
ting the profitable management role in
the hands of the shareholders, rather than
the bank.
However, U.S. National responded to
the threat by exercising a little-known op

tion in the original agreement entitling it
to dispose of the trust by returning the
land to the Klamathsorby selling the land
and paying the shareholders in cash.
Without consulting tribal leaders, the
bank sold the land to various parties in
cluding lumber companies and the U.S.
Interior Department. The latter incorpo
rated parcels into the Winema National
Forest and a wildlife refuge.
Motherland
Elnathan Davis, secretary of the Com
mittee to Save the Remaining Klamath
Lands, said at the time, "People who grow
up on this land feel like it is a part of us, a
mother to us. If this land is sold it is the
end of us as a tribe — we're lost."
The gradual destruction of the Klamath
Nation — the chipping away at its once
vast lands — has continued since the
1864 treaty guaranteeing them
sovereignty.
Under that treaty the Klamaths ceded
13 million acres of what is now southern
Oregon and northeastern California to the
U.S. government. Still, the Klamaths
were more fortunate than many tribes,
having a reservation on the same land
they had inhabited for at least 10,000
years.
The Dawes Act of 1887 further cut into
tribal holdings by converting the com
munally held land into 160-acre parcels
which individuals could sell. By 1950
white businessmen had purchased nearly
a fourth of the Klamath reservation.
The 1954 Termination Act virtually
liquidated the reservation by paying off
tribal members who voted to receive
money rather than hold a share of their
land under a trust agreement.
With all but 145,000 acres of the land
sold off by 1960, the Klamath culture —
rooted so deeply in land — had nearly
disappeared. What remnants remain
threatened to vanish with the 1969 sale of
the remaining land by the U.S. National
Bank for $51.4 million.

From that sale came the $103,000 per
capita the bank paid members of the trust.
All except Edison Chiloquin accepted the
money, and the Klamaths were again em
broiled in heavy spending.
Preserve culture
Instead of money Edison Chiloquin
wants the Arrowhead parcel — now
owned by the U.S. Forest Service — main
tained perpetually as Klamath land. His
plan is to "preserve the culture of my tribe
by re-creating my grandfather's old vil
lage of my people at Ktai-Tupaksi (Stand
ing Rock). I want traditional Indian
people to be able to live there in the tradi
tional way while the knowledge of the old
ways is still in our mind and heart."
In the meantime, the Forest Service
has promised the Chiloquins a temporary
land use permit, enabling them to put up
teepees and sweat lodges but not perma
nent structures such as earth lodges.
Bob Chadwick of the Forest Service
told the press he likes the idea of this land
being a "living Indian museum," but
his conditions — that there be a govern
ing body and public access roads — en
sure that the ancestral lands would be
come a tourist attraction beyond control
of traditional leaders.
In keeping with his museum concept
Chadwick insisted that 640 acres would
be more than required. A few acres for
buildings and a parking lot are as much
sacred land as the forest can spare.
But the Chiloquins are confident they
can obtain the land legally, if not by an
exchange then by a congressional bill
promised by Rep. Al Ullman (D-Ore.),
should all else fail.
As the only Klamath who has not sold
his land and treaty rights, Chiloquin says
he will live to be a hundred if necessary to
preserve his claim. To dramatize his pur
pose, he and his supporters have set up
teepees and lit a fire. They plan to keep it
burning until they receive title to the
land.
