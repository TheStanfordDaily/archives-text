## Coaches laud Morrison Women netter called best No. 5 ever by Gould 
### Chris Kamel 
When she was 15, her high school coach
called her "one of the finest young women
talents" he had ever seen.
This March, the cover story in Bluck Sports
said she has the ability to follow the ac
complishments of Althea Gibson (a one-time
Wimbledon champion.)
And Diane Morrison, No. 5 singles player on
th(! women's tennis team, has the credentials to
back up those claims.
At 12, she was already ranked 11th among
southern California under-lHs. According to
Morrison,her parents gave her a great deal of
backing during the early >**ars.
This backing paid off. While attending Be
verly Mills High School, Morrison was one of
two to play on the previously all-male
high school team, tinder coach Hal Seiling at
Beverly Hills, she earned a No. 7 ranking na
tionally among 18-year-olds.
'No trouble adjusting'
"I've had no trouble adjusting from high
school to college play," said Morrison. "The
good thing is that there are other girls on the
team as young as I am." She is 17.
And, according to women's coach Anne Hill,
Morrison's youth has provided no obstacles in
her dedication to tennis. "She is very mature
for her age," said Hill, "and this is reflected in
her game."
Morrison said she practices at least three
hours a day, and claims enjoyment is her main
drive.-," When I go to play tournaments, people
always think that I am too serious," she said.
"Hut this is just seen in my concentration. Un
derneath, I just want to have fun."
Morrison's "fun" has frustrated many an op
ponent. As the No. 5 player on the women's
team, and"the best 5 you'll ever see," men's
tennis coach Dick Gould hastens to add, Diane
is undefeated in singles play.
Hill attributes Morrison's success to an ex
cellent volley and overhead and fine mobility
on the court. "She moves very well," Hill re
marked. "She also is a fine doubles player and
she complements (partner) Sue (Hagey) very
well."
Walk on
Morrison, a walk-on, first met a Card tennis
coach at the Ojai Tournament in late April

1975, when she saw Could.
"She had already been accepted and I
noticed that she was quite successful in ten
nis," he explained, "so I went down to talk to
her."
"She was rated 24th in her first year in the
18-year-old girls singles last year, which is fan
tastic," Gould said. "But what makes her so
special is that she is one of the finest individu
als that I have met on or off the court and her
attitude reflects that."
