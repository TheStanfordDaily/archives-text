# Ford dislikes budget plan of Congress
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Congress
passed a resolution setting a tentative
federal spending ceiling of $413.3 bill
ion yesterday.
Democratic backers said the mea
sure would spur the economy by
boosting employment and continuing
tax cuts through fiscal 1977.
President Ford immediately issued a
statement criticizing the budget,
which is nearly SIH billion more than
ho proposed. He vowed to trim expen
ditures.
Passage of the measure marked the
first time Congress enacted its own
budget rather than simply acting on a
president's proposals.
Republicans opposing the resolu
tion said the proposed budget could
spark inflation.
Ford said, "1 hope everybody
realizes that this resolution does not
come to the President for action. If it
did, I would veto it."
Possible hike
But even before the measure was
given final approval by the House, Re
publicans and Democrats agreed that
higher interest rates might hike the
total bv $4 billion for the fiscal year

beginning Oct. 1. They differed, how
ever. as to who should take the blame
for any hike.
House Budget Committee Chairman
Brock Adams (D-Wash.) said a $4-
billion increase in interest on govern
ment debts would depend on whether
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ar
thur Burns raises interest rates.
"If he increases interest rates. Burns
will bust the budget." Adams said.
Rep. Herman T. Schneebeli (R-Pa.),
ranking Republican on the House
Ways and Means Committee, said that
Congress' high spending will drive up
interest rates.
Significant approval
"The very fact that we're approving
$17.5 billion more than the President
wants itself causes interest to rise."
Schneebeli said.
The $413.3 billion federal spending
target envisions a deficit at the end of
the year of $50.8 billion compared to
Ford's estimate of a $44.8 billion de
ficit from his $395.8 billion proposed
budget.
Congress' target assumes continua
tion cf this year's tax cuts through
1977.
