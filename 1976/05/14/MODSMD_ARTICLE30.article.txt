# Mayer to miss tennis NCAAs
## 
### Paul Bauman 
It looks like Gene Mayer's ten
nis season is over â€” before it
ever really got started.
Men's tennis coach Dick
Gould announced Wednesday
that Mayer will not play in this
weekend's UCLA Invitational
Tournament and that it is "very
unlikely" he will play in the
NCAA Championships May
24-30 at Corpus Christi, Texas.
"Gene and I decided mutually
that if he couldn't go full blast
Monday that he wouldn't be a
factor in the NCAAs," Gould
said. "And he couldn't."
Pulled back muscle
Mayer has been bothered all
season by first a pulled back
muscle and then a virus. He is
now healthy enough to play, but
lacks endurance due to inactiv
ity. The junior has played no
dual-match singles this season
and just a few doubles matches.
Gould said it was "very impor
tant" Mayer play at UCLA if he
were to compete in the NCAAs.
"1 don't think his first competi
tion should be in the NCAAs,"
Gould said. "It's not in the best
interests of the team."
Mayer's loss is a big blow to
Stanford's NCAA hopes because
he's the third-ranked player in
college behi nd UCLA stars Brian
Teacher and Peter Fleming.
Sort of successor
The UCLA Invitational, be
ginning today and concluding
tomorrow, is the successor to the
Pacific-8 Championships. Sort
of.
Some of the gloss of the invita
tional, between Stanford,
California, UCLA and USC, is
removed when you consider that

no league title is at stake. The
Pac-8 was dissolved in tennis
after last year and there isn't
even an official Pat:-4. Stanford
is a member of no league.
Each school has sent four si ng
les players and two doubles
teams to the UCLA tournament.
Stanford's singles representa
tives are, in order, Bill Maze
(8-6), Matt Mitchell (11-4), Mark
Mitchell (11-3) and John Rast.
Gould's doubles teams are
Maze-Mark Mitchell and Matt
Mitchell-Perry Wright.
Rejoin the Cards
Pat DuPre is still playing in an
independent tournament in
North Carolina but will rejoin
the Cards in time for the NCAAs.
Gould and his players left for
Los Angeles yesterday after
noon, leaving the Card "second
stringers" to play UC-Davis
under the guidance of women's
coach Anne Hill. Hill won her
men's coaching debut as Stan
ford breezed past Davis, 7-2.
The Cards won five of six sing
les matches to ice the victory be
fore any doubles bouts began.
The men are now 13-3.
