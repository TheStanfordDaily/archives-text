# In Pacific-8 meet
## Can trackmen avoid last? 
### Chris Baker 
Preventing USC from winning
its third consecutive Pacific-8
track and field crown at the con
ference tnick meet today will he
almost as impossible as telling
the weatherman to lower the
scorching temperatures which
have plagued the Hay Area this
week.
The showdown will be in
UC-Berkeley's Edwards
Stadium, beginning at 10 ii.rn.
"USC should walk away with
the Pac-B conference track and
field championship," UCLA
coach Jim Bush told a press con
ference yesterday.
The Trojans finished tin; dual
meet season with a perfect 6-0
mark. USC ended UCLA's string
of 42 dual meet wins when the
Trojans beat the Bruins 88-02.
"I talked to some coaches from
the Northwest and they agreed
that USC should win," said
Hush. "But there should he a

three-way battle for second place
among Washington State, Ore
gon and IJCLA.
NCAA mee?
"I'm looking forward to the
NCAA championships," said
Bush. The UCLA coach thinks
his Bruins have a better shot at
winning the national track
crown than they do of winning
the Pac-8 crown, because of the
added competition the presence
of Texas-El Paso should bring.
The key to a conference title
for the Trojans is in the sprints.
IJSC is loaded, with defending
champion James Cilkes in both
the 100 and 200. He won the
NCAA 220 while at Fisk College
and captured the Pan American
Cames last fall.
Despite his team's depth, USC
coach Vern Wolfe thinks the
conference meet will be a four
way affair. "My dope sheet rates
USC, UCLA and Washington
State in that order, with only six
points separating the three
teams," said Wolfe. "We also
feel Oregon has a chance."
Stanford doesn't figure to be in

the race for the conference
crown, but the Robber Barons
could avoid the embarrassment
of a fourth straight last place
finish in the Pac-8 meet.
Baron long jumper James Lof
ton, undefeated in dual meets
this year, has a good shot at win
ning the conference crown in his
specialty.
The times probably won't be
that good this weekend, because
for once the conference's cin
dermen will actually be running
on cinders.
New track
Cal Athletic Director Dave
Maggard had hoped to have a
new surface installed in time for
the conference championships
but he couldn't quite pull it off.
Maggard announced yester
day, however, that Cal will in
stall a new $190,000 track this
year. The Bears have opted for a
Chevron surface, which is less
expensive than the popular tar
tan surface.
Track Notes: Today's meet
gets underway with the de
cathlon. The first non-decathlon
event is scheduled for 2:30
p.m. . . . Finals in tin; field
events and the 10,000 meter run
will be held today.


DON'T ROCK THE BOAT — The men's
crew team will close its season this
weekend when it races in the Western
Sprints at the San Pablo Reservoir near
Berkeley.
The Robber Barons will field a varsity
eight, freshman eight, jV eight and a

Baron coach Dick Dreissigacker said
he is hopeful all his boats will make the
grand finales, "especially the way we've
been rowing the last two weeks."
