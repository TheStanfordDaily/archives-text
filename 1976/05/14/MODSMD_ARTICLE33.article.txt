# Pitchers sparkle in final season

### Linda Buddenberg 
Eighth inning, Stanford one
run ahead. Bases loaded, no
outs, and the visitors' clean up
hitter at the plate. A conference
at the mound and a call to the
bullpen.
Kilter one of Stanford's ace
senior relievers — either Mike
Williamson or Bernie Hittner.
Williamson and Hittner have
not only come in to save games
for Stanford, they've "saved" the
season for the baseball team.
While many members of the
Cardinal pitching staff have
been inconsistent or plagued by
sore arms, the two veterans have
played well enough to now gain
positions in the starting rotation.
Coing into yesterday's game
against UC-Berkeley, William
sou was 4-2 with a 2.HH ERA and
1 littner was 3-1 with a 3.38 ERA.
'Arm problems'
"Both of them had arm prob
lems before," said baseball
coach Ray Young earlier in the
season. Young said they're both
line now: "Hittner's arm is the
best it's been in four years."
Young added that their per
formances would be important
for the team's chances this sea
son, because "they're the two
with experience."
"It's simply experience that
helps," agreed Williamson. "I
can cope with a pressure hitter
better now. I also think I have
more pitches and more control
than as a freshman."
"My confidence really helped
this year," added Hittner.
"You're best when you're
cocky."
Crisis
Both pitchers said they agreed
it's easier to pitch a whole game
than to enter in the middle of a
crisis.
"It's tough on your nerves to
relieve," Hittner explained.
"When you're relieving, you just
go in and try to save the game.
You don't feel like you've con
tributed as much to the win."
Williamson said he was frus
trated earlier in the season be
cause he wasn't pitching much.
"I felt I had a lot to offer and
wasn't being given a chance," he
said. "Now, all of a sudden, I'm
back pitching."

While they perform similar
roles at Sunken Diamond,
they've had different baseball
experiences outside Stanford.
Williamson, a chemistry major,
spent last summer playing in
Alaska and credits much of his
improvement to playing for the
Fairbanks team there.
Draft choice
In I) 72, Hittner was chosen by
the Cincinnati Reds in the fifth
round of the pro draft of high
schoolers, but hasn't played
summer ball due to arm injuries.
Last summer, he managed a
Shakey's Pizza Parlor in West
Covina.
Both have similar goals for the
future, though. They're nerv
ously waiting for the baseball
draft this year.
"If it weren't for the last three
or four games, 1 wouldn't even
consider going into baseball,"
said Hittner, a biology major.
"My dad played for the Braves a
little, so he's given me advice
about scouts and signing and
stuff."
"Now, if 1 could, I'd sign —
otherwise, I'd always wonder if I
could have made it."

TELL THE BlRD—Former Stanford baseball players Dave Baker
and Bruce Robinson thought that when teammate Mike William
son pitched, he looked like Big Bird on Sesame Struct. So Baker
and Robi .son tagged Williamson with the nickname "Bird."

argues with his "good luck" mascot.
