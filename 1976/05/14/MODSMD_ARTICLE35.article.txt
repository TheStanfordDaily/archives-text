# Poor closing rounds
## plague men golfers

It there is something that the
men's golf team has to improve
on, it's preserving early leads.
For the past few weeks, Stan
ford has led in tournaments after
36 holes of play, only to fall be
hind in the final round.
Most recently, the Cards led
going into the final round Tues
day of the Pacific-8 Southern Di
vision Championships at Los
Angeles, only to finish second,
12 strokes behind winnerUSC.
"We have notoriously not
finished strong," said coach
Bud Finger. "We have the talent,
but the question is whether we
will mature."
Leading the Cards were Jay
Johnston, who tied for second
with Paul Rekers of USC at 217,
and Mike Peck, who tied for
fifth. Both Johnston and Peck are

vying for All-American honors,
but Peck's first string All-
American hopes dimmed with
last week's performance.
"Mike still has a good chance,
but (tourney winner) Scott
Simpson just outplayed him,"
Finger said. "I think that Mike is
one of the best golfers on the
western slope, but he has yet to
prove it against Simpson."
The Cards will travel to the
NCAAs in three weeks and face
the likes of No. 1 ranked Wake
Forest, along with Brigham
Young, Oklahoma State and
Houston. According to Finger, if
the Cards' "flashes of brilliance"
can be sustained longer, they
will do well.
"Interestingly enough, we
beat USC when you compare our
six-manteamtotal," said Finger.
"What we need is strong perfor
mances from our top four men."
