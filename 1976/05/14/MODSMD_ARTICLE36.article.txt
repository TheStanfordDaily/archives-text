# Bruce, Steve Davis star
## Card nine edges Cal 
### Linda Buddenberg 
Stanford bats weren't as hot as
the weather in Berkeley yester
day, but two Davises came
through again for the baseball
team to start off the series against
UC-Berkeley with a 4-3 win.
Shortstop Steve Davis con
tinued to come out of a long
slump, going 2 for 3. and stole
two bases.
Bruce Davis pitched the last
three innings for the Cards, al
lowing only one hit and striking
out two.
The one hit, though, a triple by
Dennis Barfield in the ninth in
ning, put the tying run for Cal on
third. But Card catcher Bruce
Walters relieved the threat when
he put out Barfield on a fielders'
choice, running him down bet
ween home and third.
'Too exciting'
"I felt pretty good about my
pitching," Bruce Davis said after
the game. "Jtgota littletoo excit
ing at the end, though."
The other Davis, Steve, said he
hasn't been doing anything dif
ferently to break out of his
slump. "First you're not hitting
and then you are," he said. "It
just happens."
Cal's 10 game winner, Larry
Kowalishen, and subsequent re
lievers didn't allow Stanford
many hits, but the Cards made
the most of six singles.
Right fielder Mike Codoroli
scored the first Stanford run in
t he t hi rd inning, leading off with
infidld hit, stealing second and
scoring on a fielder's choice by
Larry Reynolds.
Wild pitch
Stanford went ahead the next
inning and kept its lead for the
rest of the game. First baseman
Tom Cuardino opened the in

ning with a single to center and
then scored on a two-base error
and a wild pitch.
Designated hitter Randy
Wong walked, stole second and
came home on a long single to
right by Steve Davis. Davis him
self scored minutes later on
another stolen base and single by
Kevin Triggs.
For the rest of the game, the
Cardinals apparently didn't
want to exert themselves in the
heat, as they left 13 men
stranded on base, failing to take
advantage of 12 walks given up
by Cal pitchers.
Hurlers came through
After the fourth inning scor
ing, the Card offense left it up to
the pitching staff to beat the
Bears. The hurlers came
through, holding the Bears to

three runs on five hits for the
game.
Brian Harrison came in to re
lieve Bernie Hittner in the sec
ond inning and came out with
his sixth win of the season.
Harrison was lifted after mis
sing the strike zone on his last
six pitches, and said he was not
completely pleased with his per
formance. He commented, "1
didn't really want to end the
season with six straight balls."
Stanford's last games of the
season will be played in a Sun
ken Diamond doubleheader
against Cal Saturday at noon.
