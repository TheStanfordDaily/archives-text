# Econ students vote to boycott for Foley
## 
### Philip Feder 
Students in the Economics Depart
ment decided yesterday to boycott
both undergraduate and graduate
economics classes next Wednesday to
protest the department's postpone
ment of a decision as to whether to
grant tenure to Assoc. Prof. Duncan
Foley.
With one dissenting vote, an open
meeting of about 75 students approved

a plan of "cessation of business as
usual" on Wednesday with picketing
outside each economics class.
Discussions concerning Foley and
the tenure issue in general will take
place outside the classroom.
In addition, research and teaching
assistants (RAs and TAs) supporting
the action will not work that day.
Sign of support
"On Wednesday we (the organizing
students) want to encourage students
to join in discussions. The picketing
will be a sign of support for Professor
Foley," said graduate student Bill
Behn, an organizer of the action.
Economics Department Chairman
Bert Hickman said last night that "a
voluntary boycott of classes by stu
dents next Wednesday would call for
no action on the part of the department
beyond an expression of regret for the
resulting educational losses."
He added, "I believe that teaching
assistants should weigh carefully the
ethical question of withholding their
own services from students who wish
to attend classes during the boycott,
but I would not recommend punitive
action against TAs who took such ac
tions. The same applies to research as
sistants."
No coercion
The boycott will involve no coercion
of students to avoid class. Picketing
students will be there "to urge people
to give serious thought to the tenure

issue and to Foley," Behn said.
Legal Adviser to the President James
Siena said yesterday that so long as the
picketing "is merely exhortation, they
(the picketers) are exercising their
right of free speech. If it turns to coer
cion, it's a whole new kettle of fish."
According toofficial University pol
icy on campus disruption, it is a viola
tion of University rules for a member of
the faculty, staff or student body to
prevent or disrupt the effective tarry
ing out of lectures.
In addition to the class boycott,
economics students decided to devote
today's undergraduate lecture course
section meetings entirely to discus
sions of the tenure issue and Foley
Students have asked faculty mem
bers to discuss the issue with them
next Thursday, the day after the
boycott. The department has not yet
responded to the results.
Hickman promised yesterday, bow
ever, to respond to student demands
"in detail" on Monday, graduate stu
dent Bill Dittenhofer said.
Major issues
Behn outlined the major issues in
the Foley tenure dispute at yesterday's
meeting:
—the economics faculty have ig
nored "widespread student commen
dation of Professor Foley's superior
teaching and guidance of student re
search."
—there are very serious questions
about the criteria applied in the tenure
decision and the consistency with
which the criteria have been applied to
different faculty members.
—there is strong student feeling that
the failure to grant tenure "was rooted
inpolitical discrimination against Pro
fessor Foley for recent research on
Marxian monetary theory."
Some professors contacted yester
day said that they would teach as usual
next Wednesday although others re
fused to comment before learning
more about the situation.
Asst. Economics Prof. Alexander
Field said, "If students wish to exer
cise a protest, that's fine, it's their
right. But 1 will be in class for those
who wish to attend."
