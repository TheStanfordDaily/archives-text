Reagan, Carter woo delegates
LOUISVILLE — George Wallace came to
bluegrass country looking for Democratic votes
yesterday. Ronald Reagan was here, too, seeking
GOP support.
Some Kentucky politicians say the men are
"like two peas in the same pod."
Some Wallace supporters don't mind saying
that if the Alabama governor doesn't win the
Democratic nomination they will vote for
Reagan should the former California governor
win the GOP nomination.
Meanwhile Jimmy Carter's campaign for the
Democratic campaign for the Democratic presi
dential nomination was endorsed yesterday by
Missouri Democrats who will lead a 71-vote de
legation to the national convention.
Ronald Reagan opened the split in New York
State's Republican ranks a little wider, winning
the endorsement of 15 delegates from Brooklyn.
Other presidential contenders had no new en
couragement in their search for delegates.
They joined Carter and Reagan in wooing re
sidents of states which will hold primaries in the
next two weeks.
President Ford, working hard to derail Reagan
by winning next week in Michigan, his home
state, was endorsed for the Republican nomina
tion by Henry Ford 11, who had said earlier he
things )immy Carter would make the best Demo
cratic nominee. The Ford Motor Co. chairman
declined to say which man he would support in
November.
California Gov. Jerry Brown campaigning for
next week's Democratic primary in Maryland,
said he will add Oregon to his active campaign
schedule. The state holds its primary May 25.
Kissinger reports to Senate
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger said yesterday that the administra
tion's new southern Africa policy has reduced
substantially the chance of further intervention
by Soviet-backed Cuban troops.
Kissinger also said his recent two week tour of
Africa and the policies he offered have bought
time and staved off immediate serious armed
conflict in Rhodesia.
Reporting to the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee on the trip, Kissinger said:
"I believe that many African leaders now see
that there is an alternative and that they can
coalesce around a peaceful approach which will

deprive the Soviets and Cubans of any plausible
reason for remaining in force in Africa ... I be
lieve that it is becoming more unlikely that other
African countries will invite Cuban troops."
Sen. Harry Byrd (Ind-Va.) said that attempts to
carry out all elements of the new policy of aid in
Africa inan election year may lead to a bruising
political and legislative battle.
Byrd is the author of the so-called Byrd
amendment, now law, which exempts importa
tion of Rhodesian chrome from U.S. participa
tion in a global trade embargo of the white
minority regime running Rhodesia.
Appearing at the end of Kissinger's testimony,
Byrd, who is not a committee member, accused
the Ford administration of "intellectual dishon
esty" and "hypocrisy" in its new Africa policy.
Senate approves schools bill
SACRAMENTO — The state senate over
whelmingly approved a $250 million school fi
nance bill yesterday, setting the stage for a pos
sible battle with Gov. Jerry Brown.
"The administration is not in support of the
bill," said its author, Sen. Albert Rodda (D-
Sacramento) before a 30-1 vote sentthebill to the
assembly. "We're going to have to negotiate."
Last year Brown succeeded in cutting $27
million out of a $115 million school aid bill, also
carried by Rodda, after long negotiations and a
legislative attempt to restore the money.
The Democratic governor has been reluctant
to approve large amounts of new money for
schools, saying declining student test scores
show they need reform more than money.
But Rodda said the bill was needed to give
schools some inflation relief. He said current
law requires local property taxpayers to pay
schools' inflation costs.
Rodda said the measure would "narrow the
gap between low-wealth and high-wealth dis
tricts" and represented "a very modest attempt
to achieve compliance" with the Serrano court
decision, though it doesn't fully satisfy the deci
sion.
The Serrano decision, now on appeal before
the state Supreme Court, declared that the sys
tem of financing schools based on local property
taxes discriminated against low-wealth dis
tricts, and ordered the state to equalize the dis
tricts' money-raising ability.
Kennedy case to be reopened?
WASHINGTON — The Senate intelligence

committee voted without objection yesterday to
recommend a congressional investigation of
why Lee Harvey Oswald killed President John
Kennedy.
Chairman Frank Church (D-Idaho) said the
committee voted to turn over its materials on the
Nov. 22, 1963, assassination to the proposed
new panel to monitor intelligence activities.
In addition, Church said, the committee au
thorized Senators Gary Hart (D-Colo.) and
Richard S. Schweiker (R-Pa.) to prepare a writ
ten report on their investigation of the perfor
mance of the CIA, FBI and other intelligence
agencies in connection with the assassination.
The report would be completed by the end of
the month but must be approved by the full
committee before it is made public, Church said.
Butz testifies in Callaway case
WASHINGTON — Agriculture Secretary Earl
Butz accused members of Congress yesterday of
applying "the same kind of pressure" on gov
ernment agencies that Howard Callaway used
on behalf of his Rocky Mountain ski resort.
Butz told a Senate hearing he saw nothing
wrong with the former army secretary's efforts to
win favorable Forest Service approval for the
expansion of the Crested Butte, Colo., ski resort
onto federal land nearby.
Callaway has a financial interest in the resort.
Butz's role in Callaway's efforts was "ex
tremely limited," Butz told a Senate Interior
subcommittee.
And he said the Forest Service, which is part
of the Agriculture Department, is no stranger to
efforts by public figures to influence decisions.
Most of these requests come from Congress, he
said.
Butz said that during the first three months of
this year, the chief of the Forest Service received
698 congressional inquiries.
Sen. Floyd Haskell (D-Colo.), chairman of the
subcommittee which is conducting a probe into
Callaway's actions, himself made 38 such in
quiries from March 1975 through March 1976,
Butz said.
"Applying pressure to the administrative
agencies of the executive branch is nothing new
or unusual to most congressmen and senators —
as you well know," Butz said. "It is the same
kind of pressure that we're talking about in the
Bo Callaway case."
Government destroys pamphlet
WASHINGTON — The government is de

stroying 22,500 copies of a publication intended
for nationwide distribution because it may have
violated the Federal Privacy Act by reproducing,
without permission, a poor woman's plaintive
letter requesting emergency assistance.
"We're going to junk it,"the press aide to
Secretary David Mathews of Health, Education
and Welfare said yesterday.
"If there's some question about the law,
there's no question about the propriety of this,"
said the aide, Sanford Winston. "We feel very
strongly that the letter should not be repro
duced."
The first issue of the new 32-page publication,
"HEW Digest," cost about $3000 but destroying
all copies would be cheaper than removing the
offensive page from each one, he said.
Oil spill threatens Spain
LA CORUNA, Spain — The spreading ooze of
crude oil from a wrecked supertanker yesterday
threatened tourist beaches and choice shellfish
grounds which form the economic mainstays of
northwestern Spain.
The Spanish-owned vessel Urquiola struck a
reef, exploded, cracked open and released
nearly half a million barrels of oozing black oil
in the first 24 hours after the accident Wednes
day at the northwest corner of the Iberian Penin
sula, authorities said.
Battering waves forced even more oil from the
still-burning, sinking tanker at the mouth of La
Coruna Bay yesterday as ships and planes
sprayed detergent trying to break up the fast
spreading slick.
The wreck of the Urquiola menaced fishing
and tourist industries supporting the entire re
gion. Biologists said the oil already might have
poisoned much of the valuable fish and marine
life providing food and livelihood for hundreds
of thousands.
A thick layer of oil covered the sands and
blackened the sea at two of La Coruna's main*
beaches, Santa Christina and Bastagueiro.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except patchy night
and morning low clouds. Cooling trend. Lows in
the 60s. Highs in the 80s. Northwest winds 10 to
20 mph afternoons and evenings.
