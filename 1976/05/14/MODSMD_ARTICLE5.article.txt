### Geoff Samuels Faculty Senate reporter 
The F'aculty Senate authorized the
recognition of an East Asian studies
major leading to an A.B. degree yes
terday.
With a total course requirement of
70 units, the major will require 30
units of an East Asian language, 10
units of East Asian history. 20 units of
"substantive concentration" in non
language East Asian studies and 10
units of related course work.
Chairman of the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies James Rosse said
that "while 30 units of East Asian lan
guage will not have overwhelming
popularity," there would be sufficient
interest to.warrant the establishment
of the major.
The intent of the major, defined in a
statement prepared by the committee
is "to provide students with a more
structured but less complicated option
th*Â»n the independent major."
'Prerequisite for the major are either
111 units of East Asian history or 10
units of Chinese or Japanese language.
These units will count toward comple
tion of the major requirement.
The 20 units of "substantive" con
centration will reflect a disciplinary,
an interdisciplinary thematic or a his
torical focus.
Examples of substantive concentra
tions include: traditional Chinese cul
ture, modern Japanese culture, tradi
tional Japanese society, modern
Chinese society and contemporary
East Asian culture.
