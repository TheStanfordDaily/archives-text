# Poli sci professors predict Carter will carry Democratic nomination
## 
### Bruce Kadden News Analysis (Second of two parts) 
Unless Jimmy Carter's loss to Sen. Frank Church (D-
Idaho) in the Nebraska primary is followed by other set
backs, the former Georgia governor will win the Democra
tic nomination, four political science professors here ag
ree.
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Robert Keohane said that
Carter is "very strong" as the "odds-on favorite" to win the
nomination. He pointed out that Church spent far more
time and money in Nebraska, and only won by one percen
tage point.
Not only will Carter carry the convention, Keohane pre
dicted, but he could go all the way against either Ford or
Reagan.
Keohane called California Gov. Jerry Brown an "unpre
dictable factor" in the primaries, however, and said
Brown could hurt Carter's chances for a first ballot victory
by winning in California.
Political Science Prof. John Manley pointed out that
Representative Morris Udall's (D-Ariz.j strong showing in
Connecticut, where he trailed Carter by just two percen
tage points,could "rekindle Udall's campaign."
faking Carter on "one on one" could hurt his chances
for the nomination. Political Science Prof. Robert Horn

'said.
With this in mind, attention focuses on next Tuesday's
race in Maryland where Brown debuts in primary compet
ition. He is believed to "have a good chance" of beating
Carter, according to Manley.
Following Carter's poorer-than-expected showings in
Nebraska and Connecticut, Manley speculated that a loss
in Maryland would "make what was all wrapped up very
problematic."
Keohane predicted that Carter, with strong labor sup
port, would swamp Udall in the Michigan primary, just as
he easily won the Pennsylvania primary.
If the stop-Carter movements are successful, Manley
doubts that the Democrats will turn to Sen. Hubert Hum
phrey (D-Minn.). He predicted that they will compromise
instead on one of the newer faces: I Jdall, Church or Brown.
Political Science Dept. Chairman Richard Brody
pointed out that a large number of delegates will be tech
nically uncommited. "They want their support to be cru
cial to the eventual nominee," he explained.
Brody speculated that Carter will have about 1000
committed delegates by the time of the convention. He
currently has about 600 delegates.
If Carter is able to get 41 percent of the first ballot votes
(about 1230) he will almost assuredly be nominated.
Brody said, judging by statistics from previous conven
tions.
