Church investigation
A startling number and variety
of illegal CIA and FBI activities
have been brought to light by the
Senate Select Committee on In
telligence. The sampling of
these horrors that has been re
vealed to us seems more than
sufficient to warrant improved
Sente oversight of the CIA and
FBI. Possible details of such
oversight have been spelled out
by Senator Frank Church, the
chairman of the Senate Special
Committee. Yet the possibility of
reform may be jeopardized by
the Senate old guard.
Many of us, made cynical as a
consequence of government "ir
regularities" over the past few
years, suppose that thereare still
more CIA and FBI skeletons in
the closet. is being
criticized by some for not having
let them all hang out.
May I suggest that Church is
more deserving ofagroundswell
of public appreciation for the re
sponsible effectiveness of his
committee in bringing forth a
great deal of information with
out any leaks or other high jinks.
Were Church to receive substan-

tial recognition from the public,
the success of his oversight
proposals in the Senate would be
favored. And were he to succeed
in gaining the presidency, we
would have ample opportunity
both for further investigation
and for enforcing oversight. No
one is in a better position than
he.
In the primary election, Juneß,
Californians will have an oppor
tunity to show their support for
Church, both with respect to his
surveillance of our secret intelli
gence organizations, and no less
for his farsighted stands and ac
tion in the areas of foreign pol
icy, conservation, civil rights,
care for the aging, control of
supernational corporations and
you name it. Can any other
Democratic candidate offer this
clear record of accomplishment?

Regarding Douglas Wood
worth's letter in the May 11
Daily, he would be passing up a
very good deal by skipping over

the Alumni Association's Alaska
Oceans College in favor of the
"Travel with Goren" bridge
group on board the Pacific Prin
cess in June.
The Alaska Oceans College is
part of the Alumni Association's
Continuing Education programs
and has attracted over 60 par
ticipants. It is essentially a
mini-college. During the 12-day
cruise through the Canadian/
Alaskan Inside Passage, par
ticipants in the college will at
tend a series of lectures and dis
cussion about the oceans, on to
pics ranging from geologic for
mation and history, to ocean life.
The lecturers are outstanding:
Jerry van Andel (noted
geologist who will be at the
School of Earth Sciences in the
fall), Dixy Lee Ray (Univer
sity alumna and former AEC
chairman, a life-long student
and teacher of marine biology)
and Jon Lindbergh, (University
alumnus and renowned
oceanographer).
Besides this unique academic
program, the Alaska Oceans Col
lege will provide several extras
not part of "Travel with Goren,"
including a narrow-gauge rail
extension from Skagway to Lake
Bennett.
The Alaska Oceans College
costs approximately 10 percent
more than the "Travel with Go
ren" package and we believe it is
a significantly more stimulatng
and memorable experience.

Pound's guilt
In his rejoinder to my com
ments in the Daily May 11 on the
case of Ezra Pound, Donald
Davie has confused the concepts
of moral and legal guilt. He
writes: "Because he (Pound) did
not stand trial, his guilt cannot
be assumed." Because Hitler did
not stand trial is it unjustified to
charge him with murderous
crimes? Benedict Arnold was
never brought to trial. Is it there
fore unjustifiable to call him "a
traitor"?
As a citizen of the United
States at war with the Axis Pow
ers, Pound was morally guilty of
treason in his broadcasts beamed
at American soldiers among
others. Had he been brought to
trial I am convinced that he
would also have been found leg
ally guilty of treason as was Lord
Haw Haw although his sentence
would probably have been
commuted.
Even if Pound had renounced
his American citizenship, as a
propagandist for the Nazi-
Fascist cause and its murderous
programs or racism, Pound was
guilty of betraying the ideals of
liberal civilization. He stuck
with Mussolini, then a ward of
Hitler, to the bitter end.
The issue originally raised by
Prof. Robert Cohn did not in
volve the technical question of
Pound's legal guilt but the rele
vance of Pound's ardent support
of the Nazi-Fascist powers in as
sessing his life-work. Davie in
forms us that he has been as
sailed by Pound's partisans for
calling Pound "to account in
moral terms."
That is precisely what Cohn
did in his original communica
tion which elicited Davie's diat
ribe against him. When Davie
states that the case against
Pound is "perplexingly open,"
he can only do so by disregard
ing the fanatically racist content
of Pound's broadcasts and
abandoning the moral
standpoint to which he now
proudly makes claim. He cannot
have it both ways.

of illegal CIA and FBI activities
have been brought to light by the
Senate Select Committee on In
telligence. The sampling of
these horrors that has been re
vealed to us seems more than
sufficient to warrant improved
Sente oversight of the CIA and
FBI. Possible details of such
oversight have been spelled out
by Senator Frank Church, the
chairman of the Senate Special
Committee. Yet the possibility of
reform may be jeopardized by
the Senate old guard.
Many of us, made cynical as a
consequence of government "ir
regularities" over the past few
years, suppose that thereare still
more CIA and FBI skeletons in
the closet. is being
criticized by some for not having
let them all hang out.
May I suggest that Church is
more deserving ofagroundswell
of public appreciation for the re
sponsible effectiveness of his
committee in bringing forth a
great deal of information with
out any leaks or other high jinks.
Were Church to receive substan-

tial recognition from the public,
the success of his oversight
proposals in the Senate would be
favored. And were he to succeed
in gaining the presidency, we
would have ample opportunity
both for further investigation
and for enforcing oversight. No
one is in a better position than
he.
In the primary election, Juneß,
Californians will have an oppor
tunity to show their support for
Church, both with respect to his
surveillance of our secret intelli
gence organizations, and no less
for his farsighted stands and ac
tion in the areas of foreign pol
icy, conservation, civil rights,
care for the aging, control of
supernational corporations and
you name it. Can any other
Democratic candidate offer this
clear record of accomplishment?

Regarding Douglas Wood
worth's letter in the May 11
Daily, he would be passing up a
very good deal by skipping over

the Alumni Association's Alaska
Oceans College in favor of the
"Travel with Goren" bridge
group on board the Pacific Prin
cess in June.
The Alaska Oceans College is
part of the Alumni Association's
Continuing Education programs
and has attracted over 60 par
ticipants. It is essentially a
mini-college. During the 12-day
cruise through the Canadian/
Alaskan Inside Passage, par
ticipants in the college will at
tend a series of lectures and dis
cussion about the oceans, on to
pics ranging from geologic for
mation and history, to ocean life.
The lecturers are outstanding:
Jerry van Andel (noted
geologist who will be at the
School of Earth Sciences in the
fall), Dixy Lee Ray (Univer
sity alumna and former AEC
chairman, a life-long student
and teacher of marine biology)
and Jon Lindbergh, (University
alumnus and renowned
oceanographer).
Besides this unique academic
program, the Alaska Oceans Col
lege will provide several extras
not part of "Travel with Goren,"
including a narrow-gauge rail
extension from Skagway to Lake
Bennett.
The Alaska Oceans College
costs approximately 10 percent
more than the "Travel with Go
ren" package and we believe it is
a significantly more stimulatng
and memorable experience.

Pound's guilt
In his rejoinder to my com
ments in the Daily May 11 on the
case of Ezra Pound, Donald
Davie has confused the concepts
of moral and legal guilt. He
writes: "Because he (Pound) did
not stand trial, his guilt cannot
be assumed." Because Hitler did
not stand trial is it unjustified to
charge him with murderous
crimes? Benedict Arnold was
never brought to trial. Is it there
fore unjustifiable to call him "a
traitor"?
As a citizen of the United
States at war with the Axis Pow
ers, Pound was morally guilty of
treason in his broadcasts beamed
at American soldiers among
others. Had he been brought to
trial I am convinced that he
would also have been found leg
ally guilty of treason as was Lord
Haw Haw although his sentence
would probably have been
commuted.
Even if Pound had renounced
his American citizenship, as a
propagandist for the Nazi-
Fascist cause and its murderous
programs or racism, Pound was
guilty of betraying the ideals of
liberal civilization. He stuck
with Mussolini, then a ward of
Hitler, to the bitter end.
The issue originally raised by
Prof. Robert Cohn did not in
volve the technical question of
Pound's legal guilt but the rele
vance of Pound's ardent support
of the Nazi-Fascist powers in as
sessing his life-work. Davie in
forms us that he has been as
sailed by Pound's partisans for
calling Pound "to account in
moral terms."
That is precisely what Cohn
did in his original communica
tion which elicited Davie's diat
ribe against him. When Davie
states that the case against
Pound is "perplexingly open,"
he can only do so by disregard
ing the fanatically racist content
of Pound's broadcasts and
abandoning the moral
standpoint to which he now
proudly makes claim. He cannot
have it both ways.

Senate Select Committee on In
telligence. The sampling of
these horrors that has been re
vealed to us seems more than
sufficient to warrant improved
Sente oversight of the CIA and
FBI. Possible details of such
oversight have been spelled out
by Senator Frank Church, the
chairman of the Senate Special
Committee. Yet the possibility of
reform may be jeopardized by
the Senate old guard.
Many of us, made cynical as a
consequence of government "ir
regularities" over the past few
years, suppose that thereare still
more CIA and FBI skeletons in
the closet. is being
criticized by some for not having
let them all hang out.
May I suggest that Church is
more deserving ofagroundswell
of public appreciation for the re
sponsible effectiveness of his
committee in bringing forth a
great deal of information with
out any leaks or other high jinks.
Were Church to receive substan-

tial recognition from the public,
the success of his oversight
proposals in the Senate would be
favored. And were he to succeed
in gaining the presidency, we
would have ample opportunity
both for further investigation
and for enforcing oversight. No
one is in a better position than
he.
In the primary election, Juneß,
Californians will have an oppor
tunity to show their support for
Church, both with respect to his
surveillance of our secret intelli
gence organizations, and no less
for his farsighted stands and ac
tion in the areas of foreign pol
icy, conservation, civil rights,
care for the aging, control of
supernational corporations and
you name it. Can any other
Democratic candidate offer this
clear record of accomplishment?

Regarding Douglas Wood
worth's letter in the May 11
Daily, he would be passing up a
very good deal by skipping over

the Alumni Association's Alaska
Oceans College in favor of the
"Travel with Goren" bridge
group on board the Pacific Prin
cess in June.
The Alaska Oceans College is
part of the Alumni Association's
Continuing Education programs
and has attracted over 60 par
ticipants. It is essentially a
mini-college. During the 12-day
cruise through the Canadian/
Alaskan Inside Passage, par
ticipants in the college will at
tend a series of lectures and dis
cussion about the oceans, on to
pics ranging from geologic for
mation and history, to ocean life.
The lecturers are outstanding:
Jerry van Andel (noted
geologist who will be at the
School of Earth Sciences in the
fall), Dixy Lee Ray (Univer
sity alumna and former AEC
chairman, a life-long student
and teacher of marine biology)
and Jon Lindbergh, (University
alumnus and renowned
oceanographer).
Besides this unique academic
program, the Alaska Oceans Col
lege will provide several extras
not part of "Travel with Goren,"
including a narrow-gauge rail
extension from Skagway to Lake
Bennett.
The Alaska Oceans College
costs approximately 10 percent
more than the "Travel with Go
ren" package and we believe it is
a significantly more stimulatng
and memorable experience.

Pound's guilt
In his rejoinder to my com
ments in the Daily May 11 on the
case of Ezra Pound, Donald
Davie has confused the concepts
of moral and legal guilt. He
writes: "Because he (Pound) did
not stand trial, his guilt cannot
be assumed." Because Hitler did
not stand trial is it unjustified to
charge him with murderous
crimes? Benedict Arnold was
never brought to trial. Is it there
fore unjustifiable to call him "a
traitor"?
As a citizen of the United
States at war with the Axis Pow
ers, Pound was morally guilty of
treason in his broadcasts beamed
at American soldiers among
others. Had he been brought to
trial I am convinced that he
would also have been found leg
ally guilty of treason as was Lord
Haw Haw although his sentence
would probably have been
commuted.
Even if Pound had renounced
his American citizenship, as a
propagandist for the Nazi-
Fascist cause and its murderous
programs or racism, Pound was
guilty of betraying the ideals of
liberal civilization. He stuck
with Mussolini, then a ward of
Hitler, to the bitter end.
The issue originally raised by
Prof. Robert Cohn did not in
volve the technical question of
Pound's legal guilt but the rele
vance of Pound's ardent support
of the Nazi-Fascist powers in as
sessing his life-work. Davie in
forms us that he has been as
sailed by Pound's partisans for
calling Pound "to account in
moral terms."
That is precisely what Cohn
did in his original communica
tion which elicited Davie's diat
ribe against him. When Davie
states that the case against
Pound is "perplexingly open,"
he can only do so by disregard
ing the fanatically racist content
of Pound's broadcasts and
abandoning the moral
standpoint to which he now
proudly makes claim. He cannot
have it both ways.
