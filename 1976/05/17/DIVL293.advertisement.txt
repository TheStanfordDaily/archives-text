U.S.E. PETITION
Do you feel that USE has your confidence? Do you like the
prospect of a strike hanging over your head this summer? If
not sign and date this form and send to P.O. Box 64, La Honda
CA 94020.
I, the undersigned employee of Stanford University, do not
wish to have United Stanford Employees, Local 680, 5.E.1.U.,
represent me for the purposes of collective bargaining and I
wish the National Labor Relations Board to conduct an
election to determine if the majority of the Employees still
want United Stanford Employees to represent them.
