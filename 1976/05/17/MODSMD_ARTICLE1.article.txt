# Golfers criticize tee-off priorities

Extensive play at the Stanford Golf
Course as a result of mild weather this
winter has prompted some members of
the women's golf team to complain
about problems in getting on the
course and inadequate practice time
there.
"Most of the team plays about a
quarter as much as they should. The
varsity team members don't have
priority with respect to starting
times," said Fam Falmieri, a member
of the women's golf team.
According to course rules, persons
wishing to play golf on the course
must arrange for a time when they can
tee off. Golf club members can phone
to make reservations and are also given
priority for starting times before 11
a.m. on weekends and holidays.
According to men's golf coach Bud
Finger, golf club members are given
these privileges for two reasons: they
cannot play during the week because
they are working and their member
ship fees are used to maintain the golf
course.
Members important
Assoc. Director of Athletics Robert
Young said, "Without the private
members, there would be no couTsefor
the golf team."
Membership fees for 1974-75 pro
vided $350,000 of the golf course's
$580,000 income. Other income is
from gross sales at the pro-shop and
revenue from the driving range.
Expenses for 1974-1975 amounted
to $425,000 and were principally for
salaries, supplies and goods for the
pro shop.
Young explained that the expenses
did not accurately reflect all the ex
penses because some salaries were
charged to the athletic department
rather than the golf course. He said this
would be changed this year.
The golf course did generate more
income than its costs, Young said.
"The course is a profit-center for the
(athletic) department and the Univer
sity," he said. He added that the extra
funds go to the whole department and
are not earmarked for any special pro
grams.
'Detrimental effect'
Pat Cornett, another member of the
women's golf team said, "There's no
doubt that not being able to play
enough has had a detrimental effect on
the team. When you call up at 8:15 and
can't get a starting time until 2:15,
there's no way you can play 18 holes. 1
haven't been able to play 18 holes un
less it was in a match."
Women's golf coach Carroll Diaz
said she thought it was more a matter
of convenience. "They can get on the

course, but sometimes not until later in
the day. They think this has a detri
mental effect on their play," she said.
She added that the course is shared
with club members who pay for the
upkeep with their membership fees,
and she said she thought it was equita
ble for club members to have priority
on weekends.
"Right at the moment, 1 would leave
things as they are. I'd like to wait until
we have more time to discuss it with
club members. We are definitely going
to discuss it for next year," said Diaz.
No complaints
Finger said that he had not received
any complaints about starting times
from any team member he has
coached. "I have not had a (team)
member who has complained about
(starting) times to me. There was a
complaint from a girl member which is
now being worked out," he said.
jay Johnston, a member of the men's
golf team,said, "The coach would like
to give us earlier starting times, but he
doesn't want to do something that
would upset the club members. It's my
feeling that the (club) members should
be able to use the course in the morn
ing on weekends because they have no
other chance."
Giving priority to varsity golf team
members would probably only take a
few starting times away from the
members, Johnston added.
Other members of the golf team gen
erally agreed that access to the course
was not a serious problem. Glenn
Goethals, a member of the men's team,
said, "There's no problem getting on if
you wait."
Teammate Mike Peck said "It's not
that the team members can't get on —
there's just trouble getting on in the
morning on weekends. It could be
serious if you want to play a lot."
No problems
Women's team member Sue Hoover
said,"l've never had any problem get
ting on." Darragh Davis, also on the
women's team said, ''I seem to have an
easy time getting on. It's not too dif
ficult getting a starting time."
Several members who left the golf
team said that getting on the course
was not a serious problem and denied
that difficulty in getting to play was a
factor in their decision to leave the
team.
"The problem is that there are so
many different entities using the
course — students, faculty, staff and
club members," said Young. "With all
of them, we play more (rounds) than
any other course in the area. Club
members support the course. There is
no way that students, faculty and staff
could maintain it."

TEED OFF — Several members of the varsity golf team here are complaining
they can't get on the golf course to practice until 2 p.m. on the weekends —
even if they call ahead at 8 a.m. The problem, they say, is that the golf club
members keep the tees crowded. Unfortunately for the complainants, they're
also the ones whose fees keep the course maintained.
