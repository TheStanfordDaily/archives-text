# Another look at the Bill of Rights
## 
### 
In just a few weeks that
much l heralded day of July 4 will
be upon us. businesses and the
tourist industry are ready to reap
quite a bonanza in profits;
Americans and foreigners are
ready to enjoy quite a celebra
tion, and some groups (like the
People's Bicentennial Commis
sion) are ready to stage their own
counter-bicer.tennial.
All this enthusiasm tends to
obscure the events and princi
ples of 200 years ago. Even
though CBS and Shell have done
their best to keep us informed of
our glorious past via the Bicen
tennial Minute, most Americans

are pretty hazy about their na
tion's past — especially the
colonial-revolutionary period.
Thus, maybe Americans
should take a few minutes bet
ween now and that Sunday in
July to look at what happened
around July 1776. Since most
Americans prefer to have every
thing presented on television or
the silver screen, a few short
documents might suffice to
make us all aware of what we are
doing here today.
The first document people
will reach for is the Declaration
of Independence. After you have
read Thomas Jefferson's
eloquent prose and the euphoria
of all those has maxims has sub
sided, let me suggest one docu
ment that is more important and.
Declaration of Independence
aside, is the document that
makes America what it is.
States principles
Some may argue that the Con
stitution wasn't ratified until
1789 and so this column
shouldn't mention it simul
taneouly with the Declaration of
Independence. Yet the Constitu
tion succinctly states the princi
ples of which a group of col
onists rebelled against their
motherland and founded a new,
different nation.
For you ambitious people out
there the entire Constitution is
ready to be perused. However,
for those of you who are always
busy the amendments to the
Constitution will prove suffi
cient for enlightenment.
The First Amendment was
originally the Third Amend
ment but the first two never pas
sed so it became the first. And in
a way it is the First Amendment
for it guarantees the rights of
freedom of religion, press,
speech and assembly.
Very few countries have
guarantees of any of these rights.
Americans not only possess all
of these rights but they also can

actually exercise them to a de
gree which is unparalleled.
Let officials know
If you're intrigued by the ideas
of freedom of speech and press,
perhaps you can let your elected
officials know how you feel — in

the past few years it appears that
government officials think free
speech is only for themselves.
For those interested in the
Saturday Night Special debate,
the Second Amendment will
provide adequate food for
thought.
The Fourth Amendment is the
one which the FBI, CIA and IRS
have apparently never heard of
or read. For those of you who like
privacy and want government
out of your lives, here's some in
teresting reading.
The Fifth Amendment is a
fairly long one, but it deals with
everything from the right of not
incriminating yourself to grand
jury indictments.
Fair trial
The Sixth Amendment has
been referred to as the most im
portant, since it provides for a
public (and fair) trial — the only
way the other amendments can
be enforced. Anyone interested
in gagging the news media will
find this amendment particu
larly intriguing.
The Ninth and Tenth
Amendments remind govern
ment that there are other rights
which can't be subverted besides

those already mentioned.
The Fourteenth Amendment
guarantees due process and
equal protection, those words
bandied about with increasiiv
frequency these days.
The Fifteenth and the Thir
teenth Amendments will remind
you about another era of Ameri
can history-
Income taxes
The Sixteenth Amendment al
lows income to be taxed.
The Eighteenth and the
Twenty-First Amendments
brought about Prohibition and
its repeal, respectively. This is
required reading for those still
arguing the Saturday Night Spe
cial debate.
The Nineteenth and the
Twenty-Sixth Amendments in
creased the number of Ameri
cans who could vote.
And' of course, there is the
Twenty-Fifth Amendment,
which gave us Gerald Ford and
Nelson Rockefeller.
By using the above mentioned
words (and the amendments in
between) as a starting point, you
will find that there are volumes
discussing these few phrases
awaiting you. However, if all
those books scare you off, at least
read these 26 amendments.
enough people read them now,
they might still be around in
another 100 years.
