## Cards finish winning season 'Battling' nine sweeps Cal 
### Linda Buddenberg 
"We didn't set any goals," said
baseball coach Kay Young about
this season. "All year, it's been a
matter of pride."
In two games Saturday played
only for pride, the Cardinals beat
both the heat and the IJC-
Berkeley Hears in a grueling
marathon which lusted almost
seven hours.
Mike Williamson pitched an
11 inning complete game to win
the opener, 3-2, and the whole
team battled to come from be
hind and take the second game,
12-8.
The victories closed out a 65
game season for the baseball
team, as it went 42-23, with a
14-10 record in California Inter
collegiate Baseball Association
(CIBA) play.
"They never give up." said
Young about his players.
"They're a 'battling bunch of
kids,' as (assistant) coach (Mark)

Marquess says. The thing that's
kept us in games is that we run a
lot," he added.
True to form
True to form, the Cardinals
stole 12 more bases during the
doubleheader to bring their sea
son total to 194, a team record.
Senior Williamson, pitching
his last game in a Stanford un
iform said. "It's nice to go out a
winner," in a postgame inter
view on KZSU's Hedbird
Wrap-Up. "Especially after such
a slow start — at first the coach
really had nowhere to put me in.
"The coaches talked to some
scouts, though," he added.
"They said I'll probably get
drafted in June."
Williamson's 11 inning totals
were two runs and nine hits
given up. three walks, seven
strike-outs, and a very tired arm.
Deadlock
After a 2-2 deadlock since the
fifth inning, the Cards finally

came through with the game
winning run on two i3ear errors
and a clutch single to. right by
designated hitter Randy Wong.
Tom Guardino, first baseman,
made it to first on the first error,
advanced to second on Wong's
single, moved up another 90 feet
when Gary Pitchford walked,
and finally scored when the
California third baseman bob
bled a grounder by Gary Bei.
The Cards wouldn't have been
able to go ahead, however, with
out an incredible throw by left
fielder Pepe Hinojosa in the top
of the 11th so that catcher Bruce
Walters could nail Cal's go
ahead run at the plate.
In the second game, senior
starter Bernie Hittner and re
liever Brian Harrison gave up
seven runs to leave the Cards
down, 7-1, in the fourth inning.
Bruce Davis pitched three shut
out innings to pick up his third
win.
Comeback
The Cards came back wi th four
runs in the fourth and six more
in the sixth inning.
After a Hinojosa single to right
the Cal battery contributed three
walks, a passed ball, and al
lowed a sacrifice fly by Guardino
to score the first two runs. Then
pinch hitter Kevin Triggs deli
vered the crushing blow with a
triple to center bringing two
more runners home.
Cal still couldn't get a third
out, as catcher Rusty DuQuette
singled home Triggs, took sec
ond on an error and then scored
on a Gary Bei single.
• Bei, another graduating
senior, made the most of his last

game, hitting 4-for-6 with 2
RBl's.
No visit to Omaha
Since the team won't be mak
ing any trips to Omaha, Neb.
(where the College World Series
is played) this summer, most
Cardinals said they are already
looking forward to next year.
Young said he is optimistic
about next year, since most of
this year's young lineup will be
coming back. He also said that
"recruiting has gone very well."
Team members said they are
also enthusiastic about the 1977
season.
"They'll really be getting
themselves together next year,"
commented Williamson.
"They've got a lot of speed and
they'll be more experienced."
"We've got a good shot to take
it (the CIBA title) next year,"
added junior Gary Pitchford.
Cardinal Notes: Talking about
playing pro baseball, Steve
Davis said, "I've heard from
friends playing in the minors
that it's pretty rough — one
shower a week and McDonald's
every night," said Davis, laugh
ing. "I'm ready to direct all my
efforts into pro baseball,
though."
