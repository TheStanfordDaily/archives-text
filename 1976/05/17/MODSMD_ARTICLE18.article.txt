## 
### Marshall Payne 
A women's open four placed
the highest for Stanford at the
Western Sprints crew races this
weekend at the San Pablo Reser
voir. The four finished second in
a field of 11 boats, 0.4 seconds
behind winner UC-Berkeley.
The highest finishes by any
other Robber Baron crew came
from the men's JV and freshman
eights, which both took fifth.
The final Stanford entry — the
men's varsity eight — took
ninth.
Commenting on the men's var
isty eight race, Baron coach Dick
Dreissigacker said, "It was a fast
field of varsity crews, with a
good number of crews with simi

lar speeds as us. It just happened
that we didn't get our best race
when it counted, while the other
crews did."
The men finished third in a
qualifying heat Friday, thus put
ting them in the petite finale, or
consolation race, on Saturday.
In the petite finale, the varsity
passed three boats in the last ,500
meters of the 2000 meter race,
missing second by inches. The
boat was timed at 6:32.0.
Washington and California
were the dominant teams in the
taking first or second in
all but one race.
In the freshman eight race, the
Barons edged UC-Irvine in Fri
day's qualifying heat to make the

finals.
On Saturday, the Barons held
third most of the race, but were
passed by Orange Coast and
Oregon State in the last 500 met
ers. The freshmen missed third
by 0.8 seconds.
The sprints were the final race
for the men and women this
year. Reviewing the men's sea
son, Dreissigacker said it
"turned out really well."
