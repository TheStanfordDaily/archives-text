# Education questioned
## Japanese business concepts challenged 
### Ann Amioka 
"Population dynamics" is probably
the most "crucial element in all the
developed countries today," accord
ing to Peter Drucker, Clarke Professor
of Social Science and Management at
Claremont Graduate School.
Speaking Saturday on "Japanese
Business: Past and Future," Drucker
told his audience of 170 at Bishop Au
ditorium that population dynamics,
rather than ideology or economics,
would be the motivating force for some
"very great changes" in Japanese bus
iness.
These changes will challenge "fun
damental Japanese concepts" concern
ing Japan's relationship with the
world, the relation between govern
ment and business and the relation be
tween small and large, old and new
enterprises, Drucker said.
Perhaps most important, the "tradi
tional respect for education" as a major
means of building a modern society
will be questioned, he predicted.

Drucker explained that in all the de
veloped countries, there is a "rapidly
shrinking" supply of young people for
work because of the drop in the birth
rates. Moreover, the "people who
come in (to the work force) and the
people who go out are different," he
said.
"Eighty percent of the people who
reach retirement age are blue collar
men or workers and about 70 percent
of the people who come in at the other
end have sat so long in school desks
they are disqualified for honest work,"
Drucker said with a smile.
Of the non-communist countries,
Japan is the most affected by such de
mographics, he said.
He pointed out that the birth rate in
Japan dropped 46 percent after the
boom of the '40s and 50's, while that of
the United States decreased by 25 per
cent. Inaddition, although "lifeexpec
tancy in Japan is longer than ours
the Japanese "are just beginning to
face up to the fact that older people exist and have to be
supported," he said.
Illusion
Drucker described Japan's tremendous productivity in
the past 25 years as a "demographic illusion" caused by
the structure of Japanese wages, which are correlated to
seniority so that the labor cost of a 30-year employe is 4'/2
times that of a beginning employe.
Half of what seemed to be productivity was actually the
"impact of age structure," he said.
The working population in Japan has been getting
younger for the last 30 years, Drucker said. As a result,
senior workers will outnumber beginning ones in the fu
ture}. Therefore, "productivity increases in Japan must
become smaller and smaller," he predicted.
In addition, Drucker said he would expect the "extraor
dinary rate of Japanese capital formation to go down very
sharply."
Reaction
The Japanese are already beginning to react to such
problems along traditional lines, such as "pushing auto
mation at a very high rate" as well as shifting export
priorities, he noted.
However, some of the solutions that are likely to come
up may violate such traditions, he said. Such solutions
would include the development of production sharing,
which "implies a shift from developed countries to de
veloping ones," he said.
Developing countries hold "unbelieyeable large num
bers of young people" who need jobs, Drucker said.
"The Japanese are the last people who are likely to bring
in outsiders" to fill labor needs, so they will be "forced to
go where the labor is," he said.
Drucker's speech was the featured address in a Friday-
Saturday conference on "Japan as a Business Society."
The conference was sponsored by the Stanford-Berkeley
Joint East Asia Language and Area Center and the Center
for East Asian Studies at Stanford.

"Population dynamics" is probably
the most "crucial element in all the
developed countries today," accord
ing to Peter Drucker, Clarke Professor
of Social Science and Management at
Claremont Graduate School.
Speaking Saturday on "Japanese
Business: Past and Future," Drucker
told his audience of 170 at Bishop Au
ditorium that population dynamics,
rather than ideology or economics,
would be the motivating force for some
"very great changes" in Japanese bus
iness.
These changes will challenge "fun
damental Japanese concepts" concern
ing Japan's relationship with the
world, the relation between govern
ment and business and the relation be
tween small and large, old and new
enterprises, Drucker said.
Perhaps most important, the "tradi
tional respect for education" as a major
means of building a modern society
will be questioned, he predicted.

Drucker explained that in all the de
veloped countries, there is a "rapidly
shrinking" supply of young people for
work because of the drop in the birth
rates. Moreover, the "people who
come in (to the work force) and the
people who go out are different," he
said.
"Eighty percent of the people who
reach retirement age are blue collar
men or workers and about 70 percent
of the people who come in at the other
end have sat so long in school desks
they are disqualified for honest work,"
Drucker said with a smile.
Of the non-communist countries,
Japan is the most affected by such de
mographics, he said.
He pointed out that the birth rate in
Japan dropped 46 percent after the
boom of the '40s and 50's, while that of
the United States decreased by 25 per
cent. Inaddition, although "lifeexpec
tancy in Japan is longer than ours
the Japanese "are just beginning to
face up to the fact that older people exist and have to be
supported," he said.
Illusion
Drucker described Japan's tremendous productivity in
the past 25 years as a "demographic illusion" caused by
the structure of Japanese wages, which are correlated to
seniority so that the labor cost of a 30-year employe is 4'/2
times that of a beginning employe.
Half of what seemed to be productivity was actually the
"impact of age structure," he said.
The working population in Japan has been getting
younger for the last 30 years, Drucker said. As a result,
senior workers will outnumber beginning ones in the fu
ture}. Therefore, "productivity increases in Japan must
become smaller and smaller," he predicted.
In addition, Drucker said he would expect the "extraor
dinary rate of Japanese capital formation to go down very
sharply."
Reaction
The Japanese are already beginning to react to such
problems along traditional lines, such as "pushing auto
mation at a very high rate" as well as shifting export
priorities, he noted.
However, some of the solutions that are likely to come
up may violate such traditions, he said. Such solutions
would include the development of production sharing,
which "implies a shift from developed countries to de
veloping ones," he said.
Developing countries hold "unbelieyeable large num
bers of young people" who need jobs, Drucker said.
"The Japanese are the last people who are likely to bring
in outsiders" to fill labor needs, so they will be "forced to
go where the labor is," he said.
Drucker's speech was the featured address in a Friday-
Saturday conference on "Japan as a Business Society."
