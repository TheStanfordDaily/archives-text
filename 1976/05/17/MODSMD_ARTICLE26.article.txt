# Class List Sign-Up Autumn Quarter 1976-77
## 
### 
There will not be Advance Registration in Spring
Quarter for Autumn Quarter 1976-77. Instead there
will be a Class List Sign-Up for current students to
sign class lists for those courses requiring it. Courses
will be listed on Autumn Program Cards that will be
available at the "Autumn Program Cards" window in
the lobby of the Old Union beginning May 18. Sign
ing of Class Lists will begin May 18 according to the
schedule in the Time Schedule (available at the In
formation window in the lobby of the Old Union).
Each student should bring his or her ID to get a
Program Card. No advisors' signatures will be required
on the Autumn Program Cards and only courses that
require signing class lists should be shown. Students
who do not need to sign class lists should not fill out
and turn in Autumn Program Cards. The last day to
pick up Program Cards is May 28, but Class Lists can
be signed through June 1. The cards should be turned
in at the Class List windows by June 1 and will be
returned to students at Autumn Quarter Registration.
