# Sandoval wins upset; Barons last in Pac-8
## 
### Bruce Anderson 
Shortly before the 10.000 meter finals Friday at
the Pacific-8 Track and Field Championships in
Berkeley, a sign was taped up below the Edward
Stadium pressbox which read: "WSU 3: Watch
out for el NMF."
While the "WSU 3" was clearly Washington
State's Kenyan distance running trio of defending
NCAA 3- and 6-mile champion John Ngeno,
Joshua Kimetoand Samson Kimombwa, for a time
the identity of "el NMF" was a bit hazy.
As the race developed, however. Stanford's An
thony "NMF" Sandoval left no doubt to whom the
sign was referring.
Sandoval (the "New Mexico Flash") took
nearly 25 seconds off his personal best to upset
Ngeno. bidding for his fourth consecutive Pac-8
6-mile (10,000 meter) title, and his two country
men.
Record total
USC accumulated a record 180 points on the
way to its third consecutive team crown. Stanford
finished the two-day competition in eighth place
with 21 points, nine points more than last year's
total. But the senior pre-med removed any tarnish
from the team performance with his victory in the
10.000.
As expected, the race developed into battle be
tween the Kenyans and Sandoval. At the four
mile mark Kimombwa broke from his two coun
trymen and Sandoval went with him.
By the time Sandoval took the lead on the 22nd
lap, it was essentially a two-man race between
Kimombwa and he. When the Stanford senior
moved to tlie front, teammate Jack Bellah
exclaimed, "Now that he's got it (the lead) he
doesn't know what to do with it."
But Sandy soon quieted any fears among his
now joyous, but hoarse, teammates as he crossed
the 6 mile mark in a Pacific-8 meet record of
28:03.8 and then burned out Kimombwa bv turn

ing in a scorching 62 second last lap. Sandoval
broke the tape at 28:55.6, kimombwa at 29:00.2.
Enthusiastic crowd
Sandoval said the crowd's enthusiastic (and
nationalistic) support had helped him.
"This race gives me a lot of confidence." said
Sandoval, who will he competing in the U.S.
Olympic Marathon Trials this weekend in
Eugene. Ore.
Overshadowed, but not overlooked was senior
Jack Bellah's fifth-place finish in the steeplechase.
Bel lab's time of 9:00.4 was a personal best anil
came close to the school record of 8:59.6.
Stanford long jumper James Lofton finished
fourth in his specialty with a leap of 24-3V4. Tin;
sophomore from Los Angeles will get his last
chance to meet the NCAA qualifying mark of 25-0
this weekend at the California Relays in Modesto.
Tired Foster
Hurdler John Foster had run three times in two
days by the time he entered the blocks for the 110
meter high hurdle finals. It may have been one
time too many as Foster, who won his heat Friday,
failed to place in Saturday's finals.
"1 blew my legs out in the intermediates," Fos
ter said of his run in Friday's 400 intermediate
hurdle trials. "I had enough left for one good race
today." Foster said he felt lie had run a good leg in
the4oo relay, but then simply had nothing left for
the highs.
The Robber Barons picked up a point in the
decathlon, however, as sophomore Carl Johnk
turned in a lifetime best of 5649 points.
The 1000 meter relay foursome of Scott Wingo,
Alan Sheats, Matt Hogsett and Lofton placed
fourth in the meet's concluding event.
"This was their best race of the year," Stanford
coach Payton Jordan said after the meet. "There
were no mistakes in techniques and they ran flat
out."
Jordan summed up his feelings on the team's
performance by saying. "I was pleased as punch."
