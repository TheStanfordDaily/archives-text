Senate report: Pentagon still spies
WASHINGTON,- — The Pentagon, which once kept files
on the political activities of some 100,000 Americans, still
spies on citizens thought to pose a "threat" to the military,
a Senate intelligence committee staff report said yester
day.
Although the report stressed that military spying "has
been greatly reduced," it said that Pentagon directives are
"so ambiguous" that widespread surveillance of civilians
could resume.
According to the report, military agents have been au
thorized to penetrate civilian groups on nine occasions
since the new directives went into effect in 1971.
Most of the mil itary spying since 1971 has been done by
the Navy at bases in Charleston, S.C., and San Diego and
Long Beach, Calif., the report indicated.
In addition, military intelligence agencies continue to
spy on American civilians living near military installa
tions in Japan and West Germany.
Reagan gains delegates
WASHINGTON — Ronald Reagan made gains during
the weekend that will koi.p him ahead of President Gerald
Ford in the delegate vote count regardless of what hap
pens in the Maryland and Michigan primaries tomorrow.
Reagan picked up support Saturday from a total of 44
delegates to the Republican National Convention, giving
him a total of 476. Ford added eight, giving him a total of
33 1 out of the 1130 needed to nominate.
Until this weekend, there was at least a statistical
chance that Ford could be ahead after tomorrow's
primaries. But now, even if Ford were to win all 43 of the
Republican delegate votes at stake in Maryland and all 84
to be selected on the basis of the Michigan voting, he
would still trail Reagan.
Meanwhile, in a joint appearance yesterday from
Washington on ABC-TV's Issues and Answers, California
Gov. Kdmund Brown |r. and Rep. Morris IJdall (D-Ariz.)
charged that the Democratic frontrunner, Jimmy Carter, is
fuzzy on the issues.
"You never know where he stands on any issue," Udall
said. "Nobody could be less specific than Jimmy Carter."
Brown agreed and claimed that when Carter was ques
tioned about a plan to reorganize government agencies, he
refused to give specifics.
Carter picked up eight delegate votes Saturday in New
Mexico, giving him 602 of the 1505 needed for the nomi
nation.
