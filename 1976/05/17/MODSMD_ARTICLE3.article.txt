# Play-by-play on draw delay
## 
### John Freed 
"I've been doing this for six years.
This is the most nerve-wracking one
we've had so far."
That's how Larry Horton, associate
dean of student affairs, described the
delayed Round One of this year's
draw.
The last straw in the delay occurred
when the final draw program — the
one which lists the results — failed to
operate properly on the University's
new IBM 370 computer.
But a series of previous and sub
sequent machine failures also contri
buted to the three-day delay. Horton
accepted responsibility for not consid
ering all the possible failures which
happened.
"We'll take our lumps. Don't make it
look like we're trying to blame some
one else," he said.
First problem
The first problem, according to Phil
Curry, a staff assistant to Horton who
supervised all computer programming
for this year's draw, began with a
machine called an "interpreter."
An interpreter reads punched cards
produced by a computer. The compu
ter makes the punches, but does not
produce writing across the top of the
card. The interpreter writes the infor
mation on the card across the top.
An interpreter at Encina Hall wrote
the information for one student's draw
across the top of another, according to
Curry. When the second student com-
students. These students would expect
to spend the year off campus anyway,
he explained.
Cause for disparity
Some of the disparity in this year's
cutoff figures may be caused by wo
men's having less desire to live on
campus than men, Horton said.
Housing spaces are now allocated by
gender on the basis of total enrollment
rather than perceived demand.
"It appears that men desire on cam
pus housing at a greater rate than wo
men. If we had demand figures over
time that were truly reliable, then we
could allocate housing on demand
rather than on composition of student
body," Horton said.
The American studies and Italian
theme houses have been given a green
light because of the high demand for
spaces in them. Horton also expressed
satisfaction that so-called minority
theme houses did very well in the
draw.
"I think there was surprising
strength in the first-choice (ratios) of
minority theme houses — especially
Junipero (Asian American) and Casa
Zapata (chicano)," Horton concluded.
