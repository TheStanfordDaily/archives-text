# Draw cutoff 579 for senior men
## 
### John Freed 
Surprises aplenty resulted from the long-overdue Round One spring housing
draw assignments, released Friday.
The information, originally due last Tuesday, showed cutoffs of 579 for "H"
men (not covered by the Guaranteed Housing Program — all of whom are
seniors next year) and 4018 for "H" women. Also, the draw left five men's
spaces and five women's spaces unfilled — all in Jordan co-op.
The Housing Office has put Jordan "on notice." according to Larry Horton,
associate dean of student affairs.
"Even with no cutoff, it is very unlikely it (Jordan) would have filled with
women. It reminds us a little of Stanford-in-Stanford last year. Hut that was a
more severe case," Horton said.
Stanford-in-Stanford was an ill-fated proposal for an on-campus residential
college. At the end of last year's Round One, two men's and nine women's
spaces remained unfilled, and the program was canceled.
Special priority
Jordan House will issue a special priority before Round Two. According to
Horton, this special priority (ranked just below existing priorities) should
generate sufficient interest to fill the house next round.
Only students who express specific interest are assigned to special signup
houses such as Jordan, Horton explained.

Only five women above the cutoff
expressed interest in Jordan — and one
ranked it as her eighth and last choice.
"let's say that just over the cutoff
were 51) women who wanted Jordan.
Then we probably wouldn't have put
them on notice," Horton explained.
"We have to be very careful in
analyzing situations like Jordan." he
said.
The wide disparity between men's
and women's Round One cutoffs re
sulted from the "considerable number
of men . . . currently choosing bet
ween housing in the draw system and
the all-male fraternity system," ac
cording to Morton. These men, most ot
whom will be sophomores next year
"are in effect occupying spaces in both
systems at once."
Spaces vacated
Asa result. Round Two this year will
be held largely for the benefit of next
year's senior men, for whom spaces
will be freed by persons joining
the fraternity system.

Other spaces will be released lor
Round Two by persons who would
rather live off campus than accept the
assignment they received in Round
One.
Because of the strength of this year's
fraternity rush, which should free
large numbers of spaces for Round
Two, final cutoff figures should be the
highest in the draw's history, accord
ing to Horton.
Based on results of previous years'
draws, Round Two cutoffs could be as
high as 4400 for women and 3000 for
men.
Horton said the quality of housing
available to senior men should not be
much below average. Men who drew
between 579 (this year's Round One
cutoff) and 2000 (a typical previous
cutoff) will have no shot at spaces al
ready assigned in Round One to
guaranteed students with worse draw
numbers. But, they will have a head
start on spaces being freed in Round
Two.
According to Horton, some of these
spaces are in locations such as Lambda
Nu.Adelfa and Florence Moore.
Poor choices
But Mark Dexter, a senior majoring
in political science who worked on
this year's draw, said that the spaces
available to senior men will be below
average.
"I think they're going to end up with
slightly less choice locations." he re
marked.
Horton dismissed the problem.
"The problem will bea modest one if
it is a problem at all. We did a quick
check of the first 106 fraternity cards
turned in. They seem to be distributed
fairly evenly throughout the (housing)
system," he claimed.
Horton predicted even wider var
iances for cutoffs in future years, but
pointed out that cutoff figures would
apply onlv to "N" (non-guaranteed)

plained he didn't receive a card, a dup
licate was produced for him.
Thus, the computer "saw" the same
student drawing twice, although diffe
rent information appeared at the top ot
the cards.
"We needed another pass through
the draw cards to check that this error
had not happened again," Curry said.
This second check was finished by
Tuesday night. The original draw
schedule showed that all checking
would he finished by Sunday night.
Another snag
"Then we ran the draw program and
beganchecking them (theresults). One
output primarily used for internal use
gave us ABENDs," Curry said.
An ABEND denotes "abnormal
end" — indicating the computer can
not process the information given to it.
Curry said he doubted the problem
was within the draw program itself.

which Horton has described as "flaw
less." The problem probably was
caused by a new version of the prog
ramming language used in the draw
program. Currv said.
This language. PL/I. was altered
"within the last five weeks." accord
ing to Curry. The last test run of the
draw program was made April 1.
"We spent a day and a half trying to
locate the problem under the new PL/I.
Finally we began (considering) several
courses of action." Curry explained.
One possibility was to try running
the draw on a different computer off
campus. Curry said.
Another possibility was running the
program elsewhere. The last was to lo
cate the old PL/I, "which we did in half
a day," Curry said.
It was 1:45 a.m. on Friday. Norton
said, when the final decision was
made to get the draw listings using the
old PL/I — "come what may."
Power failure
Then a power failure killed the IBM
370.
"The computer was 'down' (inac
tive) until 12:30" Friday afternoon.
Curry explained. As soon as the com
puter began working, the draw results
were printed and distributed to dor
mitories.
but the draw cards still sat undistri
buted Friday afternoon. The reason?
"Well, the interpreter at Encina —
the same one we had trouble with be
fore — blew a fuse," Curry explained.
As a result, the Housing Office had
thousands of punched cards — which
no one could read because no writing
had been printed across the top.
Horton said he expected draw cards
to be distributed today, after having
them interpreted in Burlingame over
the weekend.
