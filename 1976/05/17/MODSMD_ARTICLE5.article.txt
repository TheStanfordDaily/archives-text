# Native Americans stage powwow
## A 						weekend of sunning, dancing and song 
### 
Families and old friends came to
gether for a weekend of sunning,
dancing and enjoying native
American food at the fifth annual
Stanford Powwow hosted by the
Stanford American Indian Organi
zation (SAIO) Friday, Saturday and
yesterday.
This year's theme was "Bay Area
Unity." Hurley Quoetone of the
Kiowa tribe served as master of
cermonies for the program of cere
monies, dances and songs on a
powwow ground constructed on
the intramural fields.
Participants camped nearby in
tents, teepees and campers.
In addition to statewide native
American representation at the fete,
native Americans from Oregon, Ok
lahoma. Nevada and elsewhere
joined in the festivities.
"People like to come here," said
powwow organizer Steve Kane.
"We've got good grounds here and
nobody bothers anybody while
we're here."
Dancing
Dances, both participatory and
competitive, highlighted the
three-day event. Young and old,
male and female alike joined in the
dances after donning outfits rang
ing from simple beaded dresses and
cloaks to elaborate feathered shirts
and headdresses.
The War Dance, which originated
with the Omaha tribes of Nebraska,
was the main dance. Originally per
formed to honor warriors and vete
rans, the dance has evolved into a

colorful and exciting rite allowing
participants maximum freedom in
body and foot movements.
A slower dance, more concerned
with poise and the dignity of tribal
position was the Straight Dance,
originally performed only by the
greatest warriors.
Several dance forms were di
vided into northern and southern
types representing a "blending of
all different types of tribes" but
mainly reflecting the Sioux and Ok
lahoma tribes respectively, Kane
said.
Key difference
A key difference between the two
styles is their musical pitch, Kane
explained. Higher-pitched sounds
reflect the northern style while
music in the lower ranges is found
in the southern variety.
Dance contests grouped particip
ants by age and sex,and prizes were
awarded winners in each category
of dance and division.
Nativefoods, including stews, fry
bread, corn on the cob and "Indian
tacos" were cooked on the powwow
site. In addition, families sold na
tive American crafts and clothing at
booths surrounding the dance ring.
A damper on festivities, Kane
said, came Friday when the field's
automatic sprinkler system came
on around 9 p.m. Costumes, prog
rams and booths were drenched for
20 minutes before a spectator found
the appropriate valve and shut it
off. Kane said.

Dances, both participatory and
competitive, highlighted the
three-day event. Young and old,
male and female alike joined in the
dances after donning outfits rang
ing from simple beaded dresses and
cloaks to elaborate feathered shirts
and headdresses.
The War Dance, which originated
with the Omaha tribes of Nebraska,
was the main dance. Originally per
formed to honor warriors and vete
rans, the dance has evolved into a

colorful and exciting rite allowing
participants maximum freedom in
body and foot movements.
A slower dance, more concerned
with poise and the dignity of tribal
position was the Straight Dance,
originally performed only by the
greatest warriors.
Several dance forms were di
vided into northern and southern
types representing a "blending of
all different types of tribes" but
mainly reflecting the Sioux and Ok
lahoma tribes respectively, Kane
said.
Key difference
A key difference between the two
styles is their musical pitch, Kane
explained. Higher-pitched sounds
reflect the northern style while
music in the lower ranges is found
in the southern variety.
Dance contests grouped particip
ants by age and sex,and prizes were
awarded winners in each category
of dance and division.
Nativefoods, including stews, fry
bread, corn on the cob and "Indian
tacos" were cooked on the powwow
site. In addition, families sold na
tive American crafts and clothing at
booths surrounding the dance ring.
A damper on festivities, Kane
said, came Friday when the field's
automatic sprinkler system came
on around 9 p.m. Costumes, prog
rams and booths were drenched for
20 minutes before a spectator found
the appropriate valve and shut it
off. Kane said.
