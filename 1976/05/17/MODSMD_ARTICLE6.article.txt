This Thursday, our Sexism in
Education class is holding an af
ternoon program, "Research on
women: beginning a network."
Women will be sharing their
work, establishing contracts and
considering the future of
women-related studies here.
All undergraduate and
graduate students, faculty and
staff are welcome and urged to
come. The following is a policy
statement concerning research
on women at Stanford.
At Stanford, there area grow
ing number of people involved
with or interested in conducting
research on women. We are a
group dissatisfied with the pre
sent climate of academic re
search and interested in explor
ing new ways to pursue intellec
tual questions in a more collec
tive and cooperative manner.
We feel the present University
structure fosters research done
in isolation and research often
motivated by competitive pres
sures to "get the grant," to pub
lish in quantity at the expense of
quality, to market quickly the re
sults and to gain recognition on
an individual basis only. We see
this competitive drive for "suc
cess" as a corporate, hierarchical
model adapted only slightly for
use in an academic setting.
Competition dominated
People interested in pursuing
research on women are now ex

pected to do so in this tradition
ally male- and competition
dominated context. We feel
there is a clear need for an alter
native means of conducting all
types of research, be they under
graduate papers or long-term
funded projects.
First, we believe that the pro
cess of doing research is itselt a
learning experience and should
be one of sharing and coopera
tion. Since many people in
terested in research on women
are now isolated within
academic departments, we need
to establish a cross-disciplinary
support system involving stu
dents (both undergraduate and
graduate), staff and faculty.
Second, we envision an alter
native network for organizing,
sharing and conducting research
that is original, high quality and
accessible to people outside
academia. We need to evaluate
proposed research in terms of its
feasibility for future implemen
tation.
Through support groups we
will be able to question the in
tegrity and methodology of cur
rent research, as well as formu
late our own projects according
to real personal and political in
terests. Too often, we believe re
search is undertaken because the
topic is "the latest thing," or

"where the department is head
ing."
Ally themselves
Third, those involved- in re
search on women need to ally
themselves with other minority
groups who face similar difficul
ties and restraints in the present
academic setting. In addition,
we need to recognize and resist
efforts that force emerging
groups to compete for grants and
jobs.
Finally, in our search for al
ternative research structures, we
need to break down on imposed
academic hierarchy which di
vides people into categories of
"student," "staff," etc. A net
work of exchange and coopera
tive effort cannot support dis
tinctions which keep us isolated
and working alone.
Together we need to examine
what research on women is for,
where it is going and how we can
collectively determine that
course.

learning experience and should
be one of sharing and coopera
tion. Since many people in
terested in research on women
are now isolated within
academic departments, we need
to establish a cross-disciplinary
support system involving stu
dents (both undergraduate and
graduate), staff and faculty.
Second, we envision an alter
native network for organizing,
sharing and conducting research
that is original, high quality and
accessible to people outside
academia. We need to evaluate
proposed research in terms of its
feasibility for future implemen
tation.
Through support groups we
will be able to question the in
tegrity and methodology of cur
rent research, as well as formu
late our own projects according
to real personal and political in
terests. Too often, we believe re
search is undertaken because the
topic is "the latest thing," or

"where the department is head
ing."
Ally themselves
Third, those involved- in re
search on women need to ally
themselves with other minority
groups who face similar difficul
ties and restraints in the present
academic setting. In addition,
we need to recognize and resist
efforts that force emerging
groups to compete for grants and
jobs.
Finally, in our search for al
ternative research structures, we
need to break down on imposed
academic hierarchy which di
vides people into categories of
"student," "staff," etc. A net
work of exchange and coopera
tive effort cannot support dis
tinctions which keep us isolated
and working alone.
Together we need to examine
what research on women is for,
where it is going and how we can
collectively determine that
course.

This Thursday, our Sexism in
Education class is holding an af
ternoon program, "Research on
women: beginning a network."
Women will be sharing their
work, establishing contracts and
considering the future of
women-related studies here.
All undergraduate and
graduate students, faculty and
staff are welcome and urged to
come. The following is a policy
statement concerning research
on women at Stanford.
At Stanford, there area grow
ing number of people involved
with or interested in conducting
research on women. We are a
group dissatisfied with the pre
sent climate of academic re
search and interested in explor
ing new ways to pursue intellec
tual questions in a more collec
tive and cooperative manner.
We feel the present University
structure fosters research done
in isolation and research often
motivated by competitive pres
sures to "get the grant," to pub
lish in quantity at the expense of
quality, to market quickly the re
sults and to gain recognition on
an individual basis only. We see
this competitive drive for "suc
cess" as a corporate, hierarchical
model adapted only slightly for
use in an academic setting.
Competition dominated
People interested in pursuing
research on women are now ex

pected to do so in this tradition
ally male- and competition
dominated context. We feel
there is a clear need for an alter
native means of conducting all
types of research, be they under
graduate papers or long-term
funded projects.
First, we believe that the pro
cess of doing research is itselt a
learning experience and should
be one of sharing and coopera
tion. Since many people in
terested in research on women
are now isolated within
academic departments, we need
to establish a cross-disciplinary
support system involving stu
dents (both undergraduate and
