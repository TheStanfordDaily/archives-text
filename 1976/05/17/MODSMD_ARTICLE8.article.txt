Despite much publicity to the
contrary, the principles behind
the Nuclear Safeguards Initia
tive have nothing to do with nuc
lear power.
One's position on the use of
nuclear energy should have no
bearing on his vote on Prop. 15.
The proposition is basically a
consumer protection measure
and does not attempt to deal
with the philosophical concepts
of American energy consump
tion. the nuclear arms race or
anything else that has been
brought up in the argument over
its passage.
It simply seeks to ensure the
health and safety of every
Californian: something we
should not have to ask for.
Those opposing the initiative
maintain that its passage will in
evitably lead to cutbacks in elec
tricity, from the shutdown of
California's three operating and
— at least — seven planned nuc
lear power plants. But, only if
nuclear power is proven unsafe

will the reactors be gradually
phased out.
If power reactors are as safe as
their proponents insist, then
they have nothing to worry a
bout; Prop. 15 will only prove
their assertions.
While reading Upton
Sinclair's The Jungle, Theodore
Roosevelt threw up. Then, he
began an iinvestigation which
led to the pure food acts and,ul
timately, the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).
Suppose he had kept right on
eating his sausages, thinking
that interference with the meat
packing industry would mean
less meat on American tables.
Today, not only would there be
no FDA, but we'd all probably be
eating a lot more moldy rat.
Those opposing Prop. 15
should be convinced of the infal
libility of American industry. I,
for one, am not.
