# Hoover Institution:
## Layoffs spark questions 
### Bert Bower News Analysis 
"This structure is dedicated to
the use and preservation of the col
lection of hooks and manuscripts
on ivur, revolution and peace
gathered by Herbert Hoover -
thirty-first president of the United
States."
Chisled into the imposing marble
entranr.eway to Hoover Tower,
these words have assured scholars,
researchers and students for 35
years that the Institution's primary
responsibility is for the care of one
of the nation's unique collections of
materials on political, economic
and social change in the 20th cen
tury.
General University budget cuts
will force the Institution to lay off
seven library employes in August,
according to Hoover Institution Di
rector VV. Glenn Campbell.
There is considerable disagree
ment as to what effect the layoffs
will have on the library's service to
the public.

The Institution's administration
contends the layoffs are a "manage
rial problem" with no serious re
percussions. Several scholars and
researchers, however, are afraid the
staff reductions will have an ad
verse effect on the library.
Degradation
"The reduction of the technical
processing staff will probably tend
to degrade the quantity and quality
of support for acquisitions and pro
cessing," Assistant Director of Col
lections Development Paul Mosher
said.
Serial Librarian Marie Schutz is
among those who will be laid off.
According to Research Associate
Milorad Popov, this could "prove
quite harmful." He said the elimi
nation of Schutz's position could
causea seriousbackup in the serials
department which might lead to
long delays for researchers and pos
sible loss of materials.
The layoff of Head of Cataloging
and Acquisitions Adorjan de
Galffy, along with three clerical

workers on his staff, will probably
result in similar operational delays
and a reduction in acquisitions.
The two remaining layoffs,
those of Research Fellow William
Rati iff and Library Assistant to the
Latin American collection Julia
Ball, will probably weaken that col
lection.
A precise and detailed assess
ment of the effects which the seven
layoffs will have on the library is,
however, difficult to obtain.
Staffers reluctant
Hoover staffers, best qualified to
predict the consequences of the
layoffs, are reluctant to discuss the
matter.
"Hoover people have warned me
that if I talked to the Daily 1 might be
black-listed," Ball said.
Staffers who aren't scheduled to
be laid off seem to be afraid to offer
anything but the most general and
vague predictions about the futures
of their areas.

trust," and "1 really don't have the
authority to inform you on this mat
ter," are given to questions about
straight-forward library operations.
While Campbell asserts that the
layoffs are only "cuts at t he margin"
others feel the loss of staff members
will have a marked affect on library
operations. This basic disagree
ment has raised the question: What
responsibility does the Hoover lib
rary have to the University com
munity?
"It is legitimate to ask whether or
not the Hoover Institution should
have the authority to make unilat
eral library decisions when the ef
fects will be felt by others on cam
pus," Senior Research Fellow Ale
xander Dallin said.
Campbell is accountable only to
President Richard Lyman and the
Hoover Board of Overseers. Any
decisions he and his staff make
about the library are not subject to
University scrutiny.
According to Associate Director
for Library Operations Richard
Staar, the library is technically pri
vately owned but "has a responsi
bility to national and international
scholars."
Regarding the library's responsi
bility to the University Popov
commented, "Although the library
is private, it is a tax exempt institu
tion and should thus be considered

a servant of the public."
Shaw said that the "feeling that
Hoover doesn't belong to the Uni
versity" is not valid because it is "a
research institute within the Uni
versity."
Many people feel that despite the
University's $209,000 cut in library
support, the Institution should
make a special effort to provide the
necessary funds to prevent the
layoffs.
"I can't arbitrarily allocate funds
from others areas (of the Institution)
to the library," Campbell said.
Others have suggested that the
Institution may be shifting its em
phasis. They point to the expanding
Domestic Studies Program and the
new Hoover building.
"The question is one of
priorities," Dallin said. "They sim
ply prefer to spend their money for
other things rather than the lib
rary."
The Hoover administration de
nies that this is the case.
Pounding the table to assert his
point. Campbell said that funds
don't "drop like manna from
heaven" and that he and his staff
work hard to raise at least $4 mill
ion a year for the library.
Nonetheless, as one critic put it:
"The administration hasn't been
able to dispel the suspicion that
they are more interested in domes
tic studies and research than in the
library."

Chisled into the imposing marble

these words have assured scholars,
researchers and students for 35
years that the Institution's primary
responsibility is for the care of one
of the nation's unique collections of
materials on political, economic
and social change in the 20th cen
tury.
General University budget cuts
will force the Institution to lay off
seven library employes in August,
according to Hoover Institution Di
rector VV. Glenn Campbell.
There is considerable disagree
ment as to what effect the layoffs
will have on the library's service to
the public.

The Institution's administration
contends the layoffs are a "manage
rial problem" with no serious re
percussions. Several scholars and
researchers, however, are afraid the
staff reductions will have an ad
verse effect on the library.
Degradation
"The reduction of the technical
processing staff will probably tend
to degrade the quantity and quality
of support for acquisitions and pro
cessing," Assistant Director of Col
lections Development Paul Mosher
said.
Serial Librarian Marie Schutz is
among those who will be laid off.
According to Research Associate
Milorad Popov, this could "prove
quite harmful." He said the elimi
nation of Schutz's position could
causea seriousbackup in the serials
department which might lead to
long delays for researchers and pos
sible loss of materials.
The layoff of Head of Cataloging
and Acquisitions Adorjan de
Galffy, along with three clerical

workers on his staff, will probably
result in similar operational delays
and a reduction in acquisitions.
The two remaining layoffs,
those of Research Fellow William
Rati iff and Library Assistant to the
Latin American collection Julia
Ball, will probably weaken that col
lection.
A precise and detailed assess
ment of the effects which the seven
layoffs will have on the library is,
however, difficult to obtain.
Staffers reluctant
Hoover staffers, best qualified to
predict the consequences of the
layoffs, are reluctant to discuss the
matter.
"Hoover people have warned me
that if I talked to the Daily 1 might be
black-listed," Ball said.
Staffers who aren't scheduled to
be laid off seem to be afraid to offer
anything but the most general and
vague predictions about the futures
of their areas.

straight-forward library operations.
While Campbell asserts that the
layoffs are only "cuts at t he margin"
others feel the loss of staff members
will have a marked affect on library
operations. This basic disagree

responsibility does the Hoover lib
rary have to the University com
munity?
"It is legitimate to ask whether or
not the Hoover Institution should
have the authority to make unilat
eral library decisions when the ef
fects will be felt by others on cam
pus," Senior Research Fellow Ale
xander Dallin said.
Campbell is accountable only to
President Richard Lyman and the
Hoover Board of Overseers. Any
decisions he and his staff make
about the library are not subject to
University scrutiny.
According to Associate Director
for Library Operations Richard
Staar, the library is technically pri
vately owned but "has a responsi
bility to national and international
scholars."
Regarding the library's responsi
bility to the University Popov
commented, "Although the library
is private, it is a tax exempt institu
tion and should thus be considered

a servant of the public."
Shaw said that the "feeling that
Hoover doesn't belong to the Uni
versity" is not valid because it is "a
research institute within the Uni
versity."
Many people feel that despite the
University's $209,000 cut in library
support, the Institution should
make a special effort to provide the
necessary funds to prevent the
layoffs.
"I can't arbitrarily allocate funds
from others areas (of the Institution)
to the library," Campbell said.
Others have suggested that the
Institution may be shifting its em
phasis. They point to the expanding
Domestic Studies Program and the
new Hoover building.
"The question is one of
priorities," Dallin said. "They sim
ply prefer to spend their money for
other things rather than the lib
rary."
The Hoover administration de
nies that this is the case.
Pounding the table to assert his
point. Campbell said that funds
don't "drop like manna from

work hard to raise at least $4 mill

"The administration hasn't been
able to dispel the suspicion that
they are more interested in domes
tic studies and research than in the
library."
"This structure is dedicated to
the use and preservation of the col
lection of hooks and manuscripts
on ivur, revolution and peace
gathered by Herbert Hoover -
thirty-first president of the United
States."
Chisled into the imposing marble
entranr.eway to Hoover Tower,
these words have assured scholars,
researchers and students for 35
years that the Institution's primary
responsibility is for the care of one
of the nation's unique collections of
materials on political, economic
and social change in the 20th cen
tury.
General University budget cuts
will force the Institution to lay off
seven library employes in August,
according to Hoover Institution Di
rector VV. Glenn Campbell.
There is considerable disagree
ment as to what effect the layoffs
will have on the library's service to
the public.

The Institution's administration
contends the layoffs are a "manage
rial problem" with no serious re
percussions. Several scholars and
researchers, however, are afraid the
staff reductions will have an ad
verse effect on the library.
Degradation
"The reduction of the technical
processing staff will probably tend
to degrade the quantity and quality
of support for acquisitions and pro
cessing," Assistant Director of Col
lections Development Paul Mosher
said.
Serial Librarian Marie Schutz is
among those who will be laid off.
According to Research Associate
Milorad Popov, this could "prove
quite harmful." He said the elimi
nation of Schutz's position could
causea seriousbackup in the serials
department which might lead to
long delays for researchers and pos
sible loss of materials.
The layoff of Head of Cataloging
and Acquisitions Adorjan de
Galffy, along with three clerical

workers on his staff, will probably
result in similar operational delays
and a reduction in acquisitions.
The two remaining layoffs,
those of Research Fellow William
Rati iff and Library Assistant to the
Latin American collection Julia
Ball, will probably weaken that col
lection.
A precise and detailed assess
ment of the effects which the seven
layoffs will have on the library is,
however, difficult to obtain.
Staffers reluctant
Hoover staffers, best qualified to
predict the consequences of the
layoffs, are reluctant to discuss the
matter.
"Hoover people have warned me
that if I talked to the Daily 1 might be
black-listed," Ball said.
Staffers who aren't scheduled to
be laid off seem to be afraid to offer
anything but the most general and
vague predictions about the futures
of their areas.

trust," and "1 really don't have the
authority to inform you on this mat
ter," are given to questions about
straight-forward library operations.
While Campbell asserts that the
layoffs are only "cuts at t he margin"
others feel the loss of staff members
will have a marked affect on library
operations. This basic disagree
ment has raised the question: What
responsibility does the Hoover lib
rary have to the University com
munity?
"It is legitimate to ask whether or
not the Hoover Institution should
have the authority to make unilat
eral library decisions when the ef
fects will be felt by others on cam
pus," Senior Research Fellow Ale
xander Dallin said.
Campbell is accountable only to
President Richard Lyman and the
Hoover Board of Overseers. Any
decisions he and his staff make
about the library are not subject to
University scrutiny.
According to Associate Director
for Library Operations Richard
Staar, the library is technically pri
vately owned but "has a responsi
bility to national and international
scholars."
Regarding the library's responsi
bility to the University Popov
commented, "Although the library
is private, it is a tax exempt institu
tion and should thus be considered

a servant of the public."
Shaw said that the "feeling that
Hoover doesn't belong to the Uni
versity" is not valid because it is "a
research institute within the Uni
versity."
Many people feel that despite the
University's $209,000 cut in library
support, the Institution should
make a special effort to provide the
necessary funds to prevent the
layoffs.
"I can't arbitrarily allocate funds
from others areas (of the Institution)
to the library," Campbell said.
Others have suggested that the
Institution may be shifting its em
phasis. They point to the expanding
Domestic Studies Program and the
new Hoover building.
"The question is one of
priorities," Dallin said. "They sim
ply prefer to spend their money for
other things rather than the lib
rary."
The Hoover administration de
nies that this is the case.
Pounding the table to assert his
point. Campbell said that funds
don't "drop like manna from
heaven" and that he and his staff
work hard to raise at least $4 mill
ion a year for the library.
Nonetheless, as one critic put it:
"The administration hasn't been
able to dispel the suspicion that
they are more interested in domes
tic studies and research than in the
library."
