# Hoover Institution:
## Layoffs spark questions 
### Bert Bower News Analysis 
"This structure is dedicated to
the use and preservation of the col
lection of hooks and manuscripts
on ivur, revolution and peace
gathered by Herbert Hoover -
thirty-first president of the United
States."
Chisled into the imposing marble
entranr.eway to Hoover Tower,
these words have assured scholars,
researchers and students for 35
years that the Institution's primary
responsibility is for the care of one
of the nation's unique collections of
materials on political, economic
and social change in the 20th cen
tury.
General University budget cuts
will force the Institution to lay off
seven library employes in August,
according to Hoover Institution Di
rector VV. Glenn Campbell.
There is considerable disagree
ment as to what effect the layoffs
will have on the library's service to
the public.

The Institution's administration
contends the layoffs are a "manage
rial problem" with no serious re
percussions. Several scholars and
researchers, however, are afraid the
staff reductions will have an ad
verse effect on the library.
Degradation
"The reduction of the technical
processing staff will probably tend
to degrade the quantity and quality
of support for acquisitions and pro
cessing," Assistant Director of Col
lections Development Paul Mosher
said.
Serial Librarian Marie Schutz is
among those who will be laid off.
According to Research Associate
Milorad Popov, this could "prove
quite harmful." He said the elimi
nation of Schutz's position could
causea seriousbackup in the serials
department which might lead to
long delays for researchers and pos
sible loss of materials.
The layoff of Head of Cataloging
and Acquisitions Adorjan de
Galffy, along with three clerical

workers on his staff, will probably
result in similar operational delays
and a reduction in acquisitions.
The two remaining layoffs,
those of Research Fellow William
Rati iff and Library Assistant to the
Latin American collection Julia
Ball, will probably weaken that col
lection.
A precise and detailed assess
ment of the effects which the seven
layoffs will have on the library is,
however, difficult to obtain.
Staffers reluctant
Hoover staffers, best qualified to
predict the consequences of the
layoffs, are reluctant to discuss the
matter.
"Hoover people have warned me
that if I talked to the Daily 1 might be
black-listed," Ball said.
Staffers who aren't scheduled to
be laid off seem to be afraid to offer
anything but the most general and
vague predictions about the futures
of their areas.
Responses such as "I feel like I
