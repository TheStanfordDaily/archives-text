# Credit cards misallocate costs
## 
### 
Since the introduction of cre
dit cards some half a century
ago. American consumers have
delved deeply into debt in their
scurry to consume more goods.
However, the transfer from
payment with cash to payment
with credit cards has entailed
some economic costs of which
few are aware — costs which
create a sizable misallocation of
economic burden. In essence,
consumers who do not pay by
credit cards — those who purch
ase goods through simple cash
payments — are being charged
for their brethren who pay
through such arrangements.
Credit card systems can be
grouped into two types.
First, many stores issue their
own credit cards, hoping to
make it easier for the consumer
to buy materials from their
stores. At the same time, stores
hope consumers will fail to pay
their bills within a specified
time peiod aqcl consequently, be
charged on their ac
counts.
Costs raised
Costs to the business are raised
in two ways. By law, businesses
must allow credit card users 25
days after billing to settle their
debt. No interest may be charged
during this period.
As a consequence, businesses
are paying for credit card pay
ments in terms of interest the
business could have earned on
money the consumer owes the
firms.
Second, many private credit
card systems have not been es
tablished on the basis of rigorous
credit checks; rather, cards seem
to have been issued
haphazardly, with little concern
evidenced for dependability of
repayment. Because of such lax
credit terms, firms incur a sub
stantial percentage of credit de
faults.
Both these failures raise the
price businesses must charge to
make a profit. An<J although one
may argue that credit cards have
encouraged consumers to spend
considerably more money at cer
tain businesses, the evidence
presented has shown little to
corroborate such conclusions.
Those benefitting from credit
arrangements are credit card us-

They are receiving what often
times amount to substantial
sums of money, at no interest
cost to themselves. Effectively,
credit users are forcing indi
viduals who pay with cash to ab
sorb the added cost credit cards
impose—both in interest
foregone and in defaults—upon
a business.

The second type of credit
cards are those issued by banks
and other companies, for general
use at a number of stores. These
come in the form of bank cards
(Bank Americard and Master
Charge), and travel and enter
tainment cards (e.g. American
Express. Diner's Club and Carte
Blanche).
Although travel and enter
tainment cards have been in
existence for many years, bank
cards are relative newcomers to
the credit scene. Bank cards
were designed for middle in
come people who could not
qualify for credit under the more
stringent requirements of
travel/entertainment cards.
Numbers involved
The popularity of bank cards
can be seen by the numbers in
volved: Master Charge, with
more than 37 million card hol
ders, had a volume of $11.3 bill
ion last year while Bank
Americard, with some 31 mill
ion card holders, reported $H. 9
billion in volume.
Bank and entertainment/travel
credit systems function some
what differently from private
credit systems.
The issuing party earns re
venue by taking a set percentage
of each sale paid for by credit
card. This percentage of sales
varies from six to seven percent
for the travel/entertainment
cards to about 1.3 to 3.5 percent
for the bank cards.
Although bank card rates used

to hover around five to six per
cent, recent competition has dri
ven them down.
Sizable chunk
As one can readily see, bank
and entertainment/travel cards
add a sizable chunk to a firm's
costs. But even with substantial
percentages from sales, firms is
suing these credit cards have
had trouble breaking even.
Against the slice of sales a
bank receives, the bank must pay
for the interest it foregoes in
waiting for payment on out
standing debt. A large number of
consumers haven't been settling
their debts rapidly and as a con
sequence. many banks estimate
they are losing money on nearly
a third of their active accounts.
Furthermore, costs of com
pleting the necessary transac
tions have steadily mounted.
Consequently, more and more
banks are charging a monthly
service charge to try to recoup
some of their costs. And for
years, travel/entertainment cards
have charged users fairly steep
fees — e.g. American Express
now levies a $20 annual fee on
its holders.
Again, those coming out

ahead u ndersuch credit systems
are consumers paying with cre
dit and then taking a long period
to repay the liability; they are
able to earn interst for as much as
50 days, in some cases, at no cost
to themselves.
And again, consumers who do
not pay with credit cards must
pick up the costs for those who
do. Business' prices must rise to
meet expenses, and everyone
must pay so that a few can take
advantage of credit systems.
Government regulations only
perpetuate such unfair alloca
tion of cost. The Robinson-
Patman Act of 1936 prevents a
firm from charging different
prices for the same product.
However,(Congressional legis
lation under consideration ear
lier this year would have re
moved these restrictions for cre
dit cards. The time for such
legislation is long past; it would
be another small step to a more
equitable allocation of business
costs.
