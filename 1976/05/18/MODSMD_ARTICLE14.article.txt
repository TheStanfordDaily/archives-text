Posts preventing north-south
traffic on Galvez Street at Escon
dido Road were replaced Friday
after construction was com
pleted on Galvez across from En
cina Hall, allowing traffic to
enter Galvez from Serra Street.
Galvez Street will remain
closed until construction begins
either on the Herbert Hoover
Memorial Building or the Main
Library addition, according to
Peter Hopf, facilities engineer
with the Planning Office.
"The intersection at Galvez
<ind Escondido will return to the
condition that existed before
(with Galvez Street closed to au
tomobile traffic) at least until
construction in the area de
mands a change," said Hopf.
1 le added that construction on
the Herbert Hoover Memorial
Building is slated to begin in late
July.
The posts were replaced to
keep Galvez from becoming a
through street, according to
Oscar Nelson, master planner
with the Planning Office.
"It's a University policy to
keep it (Galvez Street) closed for
safety reasons. There is much
traffic by students on bikes and
on foot across that intersection,

and we had Galvez closed years
ago to make the intersection
safer," Nelson said.
Hopf said the posts will defi
nitely remain past graduation
ceremonies.
"Returning the situation to
what it was before will make it
convenient for those people who
are already familiar with the traf
fic pattern," he said.
