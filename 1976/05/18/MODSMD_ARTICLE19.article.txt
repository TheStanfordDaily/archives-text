## CAT's sparkling season closer 'Night's Dream' a success 
### Sue Simmons 
The Demands of May met with vigorous
success these past two weeks when Califor
nia Actors Theatre (or CAT) presented
Shakespeare's poetic comedy, A Midsum
mer Night's Dream, at theOld Town Theatre
in Los Gatos.
Dubbed the best acting ensemble "this
side of San Francisco," CAT proved the
Swan of Avon's midsummer melange to be
the perfect vehicle for their silky stunts.
Guest Director Jack Bender's promise of a
"1976 dreamer's dream" was fulfilled
partly through his ability to tap sensitively
today's sources, and adapt their nuances
and associations without damaging an ex
quisite epithalamium of the 1600's.
Bender's production, in fact, de
monstrated his audiences' abilities to relate
to characters from the 17th century through
successful use of 20th century allusions.
This blend from both antique and contem
porary vials made a drink truly intoxicating
to actors and audience alike.
A ward-winning designer Russel Pyle
must be acknowledged as accomplice in the
production of this "tipsy Bacchanale." His
triple tier of pink and saffron petals served
as the perfect platform for the playwright's
meltwater world of nobles, fairies, and
"hard-handed" men, while costume de
signer Gini Vogel blended Pont Street fash
ion of the 1930's with theflourescent orange
uniforms of 20th-century "hard hats."
Fibre
CAT actors proved themselves as mercu
rial as the fairies they portrayed. Karen Hen

sel, for example, played both Titania
(Queen of the Fairies) and bride-to-be Hip
polyta, yet Saturday night's audience could
scarcely detect the same human fibre be
neath both mortal and supernatural ex
teriors. Double vision came off with double
success. Only Carl Reggiardo's unusual de
piction of Oberon as a menacing fairy
monarch seemed flawed.
Midsummer Night's Dream's "rude
mechanicals" provide Shakespeare's audi
ence with contrasting touches of burlesque
realism. Tom Ramirez, perhaps the most
memorable of CAT's bawdy drew, played

Nick Bottom, megalomanic weaver whose
lust for stardom is surprisingly fulfilled
when he is "translated" into a donkey.
Love makes asses of more than Bottom,
though. Dejected Hermia, played by Joan
Pinkie, presents a wonderful agony in con
trast to the cynical discomforture of Alice
Pirkle's Helena.
Victor Pappas' thumb-sucking Demetrius
and Martin Farraro's blanket-entangled Ly
sander also created magnificently ludicrous
impressions in their lust after Helena. And
well-known character actor Herbert Foster
served as a brilliant intermediary between
the strange and the real in his ageless por
trayal of Puck.
Moods
Just as Shakespeare suffused the dispa
rateness of moods, plots, and characters
with the mystery of nature (emotional and
elemental), so CAT's broad and powerful
artistic talent enabled its audience to ex
perience those "plains bestriding each
other" commonly referred to as "dream"
and "reality" — or if not to experience, then
at least to imagine that "change from sub
stance to subtlety" which characterizes the
poetry of Shakespeare and Wallace Stevens
alike, and makes of all great poetry a reality
neither past nor passing.
CAT, lick your whiskers! May you cap
next year's season of theatrical "musts" as
wonderously well. The play runs through
May 29 at Old Town Theatre, Los Gatos.
Curtain-time is 8 p.m. Tuesdays through
Saturdays, 7 p.m. Sundays with matinees
May 12, 15, 22 and 23.
