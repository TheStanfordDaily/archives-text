# Wiretapped columnist:
## FBI file contained gossip 
### Jeff Parietti 
"I'm one of the few persons to have
seen his complete White House file,
from the first analysis to the last
analysis," said nationally syndicated
columnist Joseph Kraft, who was
wiretapped by the Nixon administra
tion.
Kraft was recently on campus to at

tend conferences on China and arms
control.
"Everything in the file was just
political gossip," said Kraft, whose
column appears in over 150 papers
each week, including the San Fran
cisco Chronicle. "The original
analysis was so pathetic," he added.
Kraft said he was even followed to

Paris, where surveillance was set up by
the FBl's assistant director.
Kraft only threatened to file suit
against the government instead of ac
tually suing because "I would have felt
foolish suing the President and a suit
would have made it difficult for me to
continue writing my column."
Apology
He recently received an apology
from the attorney general and a prom
ise from the government to destroy his
file.
Kraft accompanied Presidents
Nixon and Ford on their trips toChina.
On each trip, he was theonly journalist
allowed an extended stay.
He has also been to the Soviet Union
many times. His experiences in the
two countries have given him some
definite views about each.
Kraft believes that it is time to
negotiate an arms agreement with the
Soviets.
"1 think it's better to get an agree
ment now instead of waiting," he said.
He explained that there is a new
generation of leaders coming in the
Soviet Union. This new generation
will be more aggressive "because
they're less inhibited by memories of
World War II than is the present lead
ership." he said.
High disorder
As for the Chinese situation, Kraft
said that "it's something approaching
high disorder and turmoil which has
resulted from Chou Fn-lai's death.
When Mao dies, it'll probably be much
worse."
The veteran columnist also writes
extensively about the domestic scene,
especially the race for presidential
nominations.
On the Republican side, he said that
"Reagan would be a very, very bad
president, while Ford already is a very,
very bad president."
Kraft said that Ford doesn't have
anyone in his campaign organization
who has ever run a national campaign
before.
"Ford's blowing it, but I still think
he will get the party's nomination,"
Kraft said.
Extraordinary talent
What about the leading Democratic
candidate, Jimmy Carter?
"Carter has strong and weak
points," says Kraft. "His strong points
are that he is very, very bright, ex
tremely hard-working and has an ex
traordinary talent of beating the other
candidates in their supposed strong
areas (Wallace in Florida and Jackson
in Pennsylvania)."
"His weak points," Kraft continued,
"are that he's inexperienced and his
political organization is composed of a
field marshall and five non-coms."
Kraft added that Carter has the feel
ing that "he's the vessel of God: It's a
case of marrying inexperience with the
quest for the Holy Grail."

He says Carter and Reagan are win
ning because of the ineptitude of their
opponents. "Carter and Reagan are
similar in that they both are effective
campaigners, but ineffective gover
nors."
Discussing journalism, Kraft said
that there is a need for more regular
interchange between the academic
and journalistic worlds. "The major
non-governmental source of informa
tion, besides the media, is the
academic world," Kraft said.
He added that the press is out of
touch with the country as a whole.

non-governmental source of informa
tion, besides the media, is the
academic world," Kraft said.
He added that the press is out of
touch with the country as a whole.
"I'm one of the few persons to have
seen his complete White House file,
from the first analysis to the last
analysis," said nationally syndicated
columnist Joseph Kraft, who was
wiretapped by the Nixon administra
tion.
Kraft was recently on campus to at

tend conferences on China and arms
control.
"Everything in the file was just
political gossip," said Kraft, whose
column appears in over 150 papers
each week, including the San Fran
cisco Chronicle. "The original
analysis was so pathetic," he added.
Kraft said he was even followed to

Paris, where surveillance was set up by
the FBl's assistant director.
Kraft only threatened to file suit
against the government instead of ac
tually suing because "I would have felt
foolish suing the President and a suit
would have made it difficult for me to
continue writing my column."
Apology
He recently received an apology
from the attorney general and a prom
ise from the government to destroy his
file.
Kraft accompanied Presidents
Nixon and Ford on their trips toChina.
On each trip, he was theonly journalist
allowed an extended stay.
He has also been to the Soviet Union
many times. His experiences in the
two countries have given him some
definite views about each.
Kraft believes that it is time to
negotiate an arms agreement with the
Soviets.
"1 think it's better to get an agree
ment now instead of waiting," he said.
He explained that there is a new
generation of leaders coming in the
Soviet Union. This new generation
will be more aggressive "because
they're less inhibited by memories of
World War II than is the present lead
ership." he said.
High disorder
As for the Chinese situation, Kraft
said that "it's something approaching
high disorder and turmoil which has
resulted from Chou Fn-lai's death.
When Mao dies, it'll probably be much
worse."
The veteran columnist also writes
extensively about the domestic scene,
especially the race for presidential
nominations.
On the Republican side, he said that
"Reagan would be a very, very bad
president, while Ford already is a very,
very bad president."
Kraft said that Ford doesn't have
anyone in his campaign organization
who has ever run a national campaign
before.
"Ford's blowing it, but I still think
he will get the party's nomination,"
Kraft said.
Extraordinary talent
What about the leading Democratic
candidate, Jimmy Carter?
"Carter has strong and weak
points," says Kraft. "His strong points
are that he is very, very bright, ex
tremely hard-working and has an ex
traordinary talent of beating the other
candidates in their supposed strong
areas (Wallace in Florida and Jackson
in Pennsylvania)."
"His weak points," Kraft continued,
"are that he's inexperienced and his
political organization is composed of a
field marshall and five non-coms."
Kraft added that Carter has the feel
ing that "he's the vessel of God: It's a
case of marrying inexperience with the
quest for the Holy Grail."

He says Carter and Reagan are win
ning because of the ineptitude of their
opponents. "Carter and Reagan are
similar in that they both are effective
campaigners, but ineffective gover
nors."
Discussing journalism, Kraft said
that there is a need for more regular
interchange between the academic
and journalistic worlds. "The major
non-governmental source of informa
tion, besides the media, is the
academic world," Kraft said.
