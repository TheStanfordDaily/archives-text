# Wiretapped columnist:
## FBI file contained gossip 
### Jeff Parietti 
"I'm one of the few persons to have
seen his complete White House file,
from the first analysis to the last
analysis," said nationally syndicated
columnist Joseph Kraft, who was
wiretapped by the Nixon administra
tion.
Kraft was recently on campus to at

tend conferences on China and arms
control.
"Everything in the file was just
political gossip," said Kraft, whose
column appears in over 150 papers
each week, including the San Fran
cisco Chronicle. "The original
analysis was so pathetic," he added.
Kraft said he was even followed to

Paris, where surveillance was set up by
the FBl's assistant director.
Kraft only threatened to file suit
against the government instead of ac
tually suing because "I would have felt
foolish suing the President and a suit
would have made it difficult for me to
continue writing my column."
Apology
He recently received an apology
from the attorney general and a prom
ise from the government to destroy his
file.
Kraft accompanied Presidents
Nixon and Ford on their trips toChina.
On each trip, he was theonly journalist
allowed an extended stay.
He has also been to the Soviet Union
many times. His experiences in the
two countries have given him some
definite views about each.
Kraft believes that it is time to
negotiate an arms agreement with the
Soviets.
"1 think it's better to get an agree
ment now instead of waiting," he said.
He explained that there is a new
generation of leaders coming in the
Soviet Union. This new generation
will be more aggressive "because
they're less inhibited by memories of
World War II than is the present lead
ership." he said.
High disorder
As for the Chinese situation, Kraft
said that "it's something approaching
high disorder and turmoil which has
resulted from Chou Fn-lai's death.
When Mao dies, it'll probably be much
worse."
The veteran columnist also writes
extensively about the domestic scene,
especially the race for presidential
nominations.
On the Republican side, he said that
"Reagan would be a very, very bad
president, while Ford already is a very,
very bad president."
Kraft said that Ford doesn't have
anyone in his campaign organization
who has ever run a national campaign
before.
"Ford's blowing it, but I still think
he will get the party's nomination,"
Kraft said.
Extraordinary talent
What about the leading Democratic
candidate, Jimmy Carter?
"Carter has strong and weak
points," says Kraft. "His strong points
