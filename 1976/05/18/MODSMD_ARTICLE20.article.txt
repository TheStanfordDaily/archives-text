# Barry McGuire resurrected
## 
### Larry Dunn 
The voice that carried Harry
McGuire to the top as a re
cording artist has retained its
powerful resonance in a new
style: Gospel folk music.
Stanford students will have
an opportunity to hear
McGuire sing in Kresge Aud.
on Thursday, May 20, 7 p.m.
Admission is free. Along with
McGuire will be Mario
Murillo, director of Resurrec
tion City in Berkeley.
In 1970, McGuire's life
changed radically. As he puts
it:"It took me thirty-five years
to realize I was walking down
a dead end street. When I met
Jesus, he came into my life
and made me a new person."
McGuire has often com
mented that he felt like a
"walking dead man" before
his Christian experience, de
spite his apparent success in
recording circles.
"I just want to sing and tell
people about Jesus" Mc-
Guire says.
Fred Bailey, member of the
Stanford Christian Fellow
ship's Executive Committee
adds: "Barry has been a real
blessing to me not only
through his songs, but also
through seeing God's love
radiating from him."
