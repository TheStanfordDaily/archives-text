# Genesis: sharp innovators
## 
### Alden Marin 
The music's playing, the notes are right
Put your left foot first and move into the light.
The edge of this hill is the edge of the world
And if you're going to cross you better start doing
it right
better start doing it right
Let the dance begin
"DANCE ON A VOLCANO"
from Trick of the Tail
Genesis. The beginning. After six albums, the
first dating back to 1969, and the masterpiece epic
The Lamb Lies down on Broadway of 1974,
Genesis had developed a sizeable cult following.
With lead singer Peter Gabriel's departure from
the group in mid-1975, Genesis' survival came
into doubt. Despite the group's over-all musical
versatility, Gabriel had proven himself to be the
focal point of live performances acting out the
group's highly thematic songs and epics with var
ied costumes and props.
With the release of Trick of the Tail and their
current tour without Gabriel, Genesis has reas
serted its image and ability to evolve musically
without the former lead singer.
Performing to a sell-out crowd in Berkeley
community theatre, Genesis played a wide range
of their music, demonstrating the unique combi
nation of Science fiction-folklore and parodic
material which has made the group one of the
most interesting and important in contemporary
music.
A crucial issue for Genesis devotess concerned
whether the new lead singer Phil Collins (also the
group's drummer) could fill the void Gabriel had
left as vocalist. The addition of Bill Bruford on
percussion (formerly drummer for "Yes") al
lowed Collins to shift between drums and lead
vocals.
Deliver
The challenging new arrangement not only en
hanced Genesis' delivery, but created an innova
tive and more intimate image for the group. No
longer dominated by Gabriel's presence, the
group enjoyed a greater equality of stage presence
among its members than it had in previous per
formances.
The show opened with "Dance on a Volcano,"
opening cut from the new album, Trick of the
Tale. As in past performances. Genesis continued
its multi-media use of elaborate lighting, slide
shows and films to compliment its musical
themes. Volcanic imagery accompanied the first
song, appropriate for an opening.

Collins then proclaimed the show would be a
"lamb stew" — a mixture of old material with
songs from the Lamb Lies Down and Trick of the
Tail albums. A medley of songs from the Lamb
Lies Down album followed, including the title cut
and"The Carpet Crawlers," highlighted by
panoramas of New York City and surrealists films
of humans writing in slow motion — a visual
interpretation of the carpet crawlers.
Modern
"Cinema Show," from the album Selling Eng
land by the Pound, followed, offering its modern
version of Romeo and Juliet while showcasing
Collins delicate voice on madrigals and a quiet
acoustic-electric background. A combination of
vocals, mellotron, synthesizer acoustic guitars
and bass pedals create for Genesis in "Cinema
Show" a flowing Baroque tone, characteristic of
their quieter numbers.
Unlike Gabriel's vocals in the past, Collins re
lied on back-up vocals and instruments to support
his delivery. Though sufficient and pleasant, his
voice noticeably lacked the power of Gabriel's,
and attempted harmonies were at moments dis
cordant. Dispite the slight technical flaws, the
audience responded wildly to "Cinema Show,"
especially to its lengthy instrumental featuring a
mellotron and synthesizer collage by Keyboardist
Tony Banks.
"Robbery, Assault and Battery" from the new
album followed, allowing Collins to more com
fortably vocalize lyrics and deliver gestures —
free from pre-established patterns set by Gabriel.
Collin's gestures, though less theatrical than Gab
riel's, proved captivating and original.
Intricate
Genesis succeeded in delivering their complex
and intricate repertoire despite the loss of their
celebrated star, Peter Gabriel. Phil Collins as lead
vocalist was not only sufficient in the difficult
vocal role, but effectively conveyed his personal
ity throughout the songs' various themes, while
doubling on drums. They were more eclectic than
in previous shows (which presented albums in
their entirety.)
Genesis offered a choice of songs representative
of their past, while convincingly delivering new
material. The group's well-received performance
confirmed their ability to perform old material,
while insuring their future with a brilliant presen
tation of new material.
Genesis reborn. A new beginning, continuing
its role as one of contemporary music's most in
teresting groups.

The edge of this hill is the edge of the world
And if you're going to cross you better start doing
it right
better start doing it right
Let the dance begin
"DANCE ON A VOLCANO"
from Trick of the Tail
Genesis. The beginning. After six albums, the
first dating back to 1969, and the masterpiece epic
The Lamb Lies down on Broadway of 1974,
Genesis had developed a sizeable cult following.
With lead singer Peter Gabriel's departure from
the group in mid-1975, Genesis' survival came
into doubt. Despite the group's over-all musical
versatility, Gabriel had proven himself to be the
focal point of live performances acting out the
group's highly thematic songs and epics with var
ied costumes and props.
With the release of Trick of the Tail and their
current tour without Gabriel, Genesis has reas
serted its image and ability to evolve musically
without the former lead singer.
Performing to a sell-out crowd in Berkeley
community theatre, Genesis played a wide range
of their music, demonstrating the unique combi
nation of Science fiction-folklore and parodic
material which has made the group one of the
most interesting and important in contemporary
music.
A crucial issue for Genesis devotess concerned
whether the new lead singer Phil Collins (also the
group's drummer) could fill the void Gabriel had
left as vocalist. The addition of Bill Bruford on
percussion (formerly drummer for "Yes") al
lowed Collins to shift between drums and lead
vocals.
Deliver
The challenging new arrangement not only en
hanced Genesis' delivery, but created an innova
tive and more intimate image for the group. No
longer dominated by Gabriel's presence, the
group enjoyed a greater equality of stage presence
among its members than it had in previous per
formances.
The show opened with "Dance on a Volcano,"
opening cut from the new album, Trick of the
Tale. As in past performances. Genesis continued
its multi-media use of elaborate lighting, slide
shows and films to compliment its musical
themes. Volcanic imagery accompanied the first
song, appropriate for an opening.

Collins then proclaimed the show would be a
"lamb stew" — a mixture of old material with
songs from the Lamb Lies Down and Trick of the
Tail albums. A medley of songs from the Lamb
Lies Down album followed, including the title cut
and"The Carpet Crawlers," highlighted by
panoramas of New York City and surrealists films
of humans writing in slow motion — a visual
interpretation of the carpet crawlers.
Modern
"Cinema Show," from the album Selling Eng
land by the Pound, followed, offering its modern
version of Romeo and Juliet while showcasing
Collins delicate voice on madrigals and a quiet
acoustic-electric background. A combination of
vocals, mellotron, synthesizer acoustic guitars
and bass pedals create for Genesis in "Cinema
Show" a flowing Baroque tone, characteristic of
their quieter numbers.
Unlike Gabriel's vocals in the past, Collins re
lied on back-up vocals and instruments to support
his delivery. Though sufficient and pleasant, his
voice noticeably lacked the power of Gabriel's,
and attempted harmonies were at moments dis
cordant. Dispite the slight technical flaws, the
audience responded wildly to "Cinema Show,"
especially to its lengthy instrumental featuring a
mellotron and synthesizer collage by Keyboardist
Tony Banks.
"Robbery, Assault and Battery" from the new
album followed, allowing Collins to more com
fortably vocalize lyrics and deliver gestures —
free from pre-established patterns set by Gabriel.
Collin's gestures, though less theatrical than Gab
riel's, proved captivating and original.
Intricate
Genesis succeeded in delivering their complex
and intricate repertoire despite the loss of their
celebrated star, Peter Gabriel. Phil Collins as lead
vocalist was not only sufficient in the difficult
vocal role, but effectively conveyed his personal
ity throughout the songs' various themes, while
doubling on drums. They were more eclectic than
in previous shows (which presented albums in
their entirety.)
Genesis offered a choice of songs representative
of their past, while convincingly delivering new
material. The group's well-received performance
confirmed their ability to perform old material,
while insuring their future with a brilliant presen
tation of new material.
Genesis reborn. A new beginning, continuing
its role as one of contemporary music's most in
teresting groups.
