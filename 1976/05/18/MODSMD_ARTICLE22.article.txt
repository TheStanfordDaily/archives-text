# Frampton packs 'em in
## Fun in the sun on the Green 
### David Ansley 
The concert was billed as "The
British are Back to Back." The
British had it easy.
Out in the audience, the
Californians were Back to Back
to Shoulder to Elbow to Knee.
"Day on the Green No. 2" on
May 1 featured a day full of rock
stars and a stadium full of
masochists. Some 50,000 fans
suffered through the pushing,
the shoving and the heat just to
see their favorites in the flesh.
But they loved every minute of
it.
"Wow! I can't believe it! This
is the best concert!" screamed
one avid fan as he stood on tip
toes to peer at a miniscule Peter
Frampton on a stage a hundred
yards away. "This is great!"
Sweaty bodies
His wasn't the only voice cry
ing out in pleasure. All around
him, thousands of sweaty bodies
stood squished together in the
burning sun, cheering for heroes
they couldn't even see.
Frampton was joined in his in
visibility by Fleetwood Mac,
Gary Wright, and, UFO.
Bodies occupied every space.
Those who dared not risk the
chaos on the green (What green?
It was pink!) subjected their
posteriors to six hours of torture
on the hard plastic stadium
seats.
The place hadn't always been
so congested. Well before the
concert began, a patchwork of
quilts covered the grass, but
there was plenty of room to
navigate between people.
Munching
Music-lovers sat around,
munching their picnic lunches,
reminiscing about other con
certs, other crowds, and care
fully guarding their claims.
Flags fluttered over the larger
territories, proclaiming the al
legiances of those who sat be
neath them.
"Reno" was spray-painted in
yellow on a banner of blue cloth.
"Milpitas" was draped bet
ween two poles in midfield.
"Happy Birthday, Sherrie"
hung from a railing in the stands.
Flags
The stage and stadium were
festooned with scores of British
flags, to honor the nationality of
the performers. Somebody was a
little confused —a rebel flag was
taped to a wall above third base.
Latecomers not content to sit
in the stands zig-zagged their
way across the grass. Looking for
patches large enough to sit on.
Claim jumpers pushed aside
poorly guarded blankets and
took land as their own.
Eventually, unoccupied real

estate was so rare that fans
walked cross-country, tripping
over every hand, food, head, and
grocery bag in their paths.
Dominoes
But all the maneuvering was
for nought. As soon as the first
group appeared on stage, the
people in the front row stood up
for a better look. Since the sec
ond rank then couldn't see the
stage, it stood up too. Like a film
of falling dominoes played
backward, a wave of people ris
ing to their feet rippled across
the fields.
This left plenty of space for
more people to swarm on. Most
spent the rest of the day in that
tiring position, shifting their
weight from foot to aching foot.
Those watching from the stands
leaned rhythmically left and
right as well.
Oakland Stadium was not de
signed by an acoustics engineer.
The amplified rhythms bounced
of three tiers of flesh and reverb
erated undiminished around the
structure.
Undistorted
Actually, for some fans, the
music was undistorted. Within
about 100 feet of stage, the sound
was loud enough to drown out
the echoes. Of course they paid
for the high fidelity — the crowd
was more densely packed. One
sardine stretched his arm out to a
friend's shoulder and encoun
tered two other shoulders along
the way.
No one minded, though. A
muscular brunette with "Hell
bent" tattooed on her left bicep
strained to get even closer. "Are
you married? Are you married?"
she screamed periodically to
whoever happened to be on
stage.
Everything from opera glasses
to foot-long telephoto lenses
were used in attempts to see the
performers clearly. To those in

the stands, even with a mag
nified view, the performers ap
peared to be colorful dancing
fleas.
Those desiring to actually see
the figures on stage squirmed
closer still. Within about 30 feet
of the stage they found a clear
view of the stars. But it was at the
expense of a clear view of their
own bodies.
Feet
Fans looked for their feet in
vain. The few who had room to
lean their heads forward disco
vered that the area below their
knees was completely black.
Terrestrial bodies were eclipsing
the sun. But the light wouldn't
have helped; most people's feet
were under someone else's.
One reason fans sought their
feet was to check what they were
standing on. If they were fortu
nate, that soft squishy feeling
was just a thick blanket. The less
fortunate stood on well-trod
bananas, Fritos and ham
sandwiches.
But most seemed oblivious to
the dangers of overdoing it. One
blonde, clad in a white halter top
that barely contrasted with the
skin beneath, spent the after
noon perched in the sun on her
boyfriend's shoulders. He went

home with a sore back. she with
a red one.
But t hey loved every ini nute of
it.
