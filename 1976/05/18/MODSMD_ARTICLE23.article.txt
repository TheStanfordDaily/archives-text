# Mindsongs at Tresidder

### 
Herh Moore will perform
Mindsongs and Music Medi
ations at 8 p.m. this Saturday
in the main lounge at Tresid
der. The program will focus
on original compositions and
improvisations on guitar,
piano and assorted bells and
windchimes. According to
Mr. Moore, "Mindsongs are
musical poems which convey
their message through the
combination of music and
words, while music medita
tions touch a non-verbal part
of all of us." The concert is
sponsored by Tresidder Prog
rams.
