WASHINGTON — The Democratic party's plat
form committee switched chairmen yesterday and
elected a drafting subcommittee heavy with sup
porters of presidential contender Jimmy Carter.
Gov. Philip Noel of Rhode Island opened the
committee's final four days of hearings by an
nouncing that he was stepping down to spare the
committee any embarrassment from recently re
ported remarks he made about black ghetto home
life.
Gov. Wendell Anderson of Minnesota then was
elected unanimously, on Noel's recommendation,
as permanent chairman of the platform committee.
Addressing an opening session of the final series
of hearings by ,the party's platform committee,
Party Chairman Robert Strauss said internal bicker
ing had kept the party out of power for eight years
but that Democrats have closed ranks for the 1976
campaign.
"The Democratic party fully understands now
what we couldn't understand in the past — that our
internal bickering and internal warfare brought the
nation nothing but disaster," Strauss said.
"The Democratic party, in myopia, bitterness,
pettiness and often downright stupidity, brought
Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford upon the American
people," Strauss said.
Michigan primary: Test for Ford
WASHINGTON — President Ford and Ronald
Reagan stayed home yesterday, while Democrats
Jimmy Carterand Morris Udall went to Ford's home
state of Michigan.
Michigan is holding Republican and Democratic
presidential primaries* today, and the GOP vote in
his home state is considered a crucial test for Ford,
who has lost five of the last six primaries to chal
lenger Reagan.
Reagan's national campaign chairman Sen. Paul
Laxalt of Nevada, said yesterday a Reagan victory in
Michigan "would be tantamount to a nomination"
for the former California governor.
Quakes hit Russia and Northwest
Two earthquakes jolted a mountainous area in
Russia and a section of the northwest United States
yesterday.
A severe earthquake caused serious damage and
some casualties yesterday in a mountainous part of
Soviet central Asia, officials said, but major cities in
the area appeared unharmed.

The earthquake which struck the sparsely
populated Kulzhuktau area in the Uzbek republic
1500 miles southeast of Moscow was reported to be
several times more powerful than one which devas
tated northeast Italy early this month.
The fourth earthquake to originate in the Strait of
Georgia in six months has shaken an area from
northern British Columbia to Olympia, Wash., a
distance of about 300 miles.
The quake, registering 5.4 on the Richter scale,
caused minor damage but no injuries Sunday, offi
cials said.
In White Rock, 8.C., near the U.S. border, win
dows were broken and people said they were
knocked out of bed. It was about 1:35 a.m.
Ehrlichman's convictions upheld
WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court yes
terday upheld conspiracy and perjury convictions
of former White House assistant John Ehrlichman
for authorizing the break-in of the office of Daniel
Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
The three-judge court also upheld the conviction
of Gordon Liddy, the former White House official
who planned the 1971 burglary against Dr. Lewis
Fielding.
But the court reversed the convictions of Eugenio
Martinez and Bernard Barker, the Cuban exiles who
actually broke into the doctor's office and searched
Fielding's files for material about Ellsberg.
Ellsberg stood trial for leaking the Pentagon pap
ers study of the Vietnam war to the press, but
charges against him were dismissed by a federal
judge.
More money for California
SACRAMENTO—California's booming recovery
from the recession of the past two years will pump
an extra $567 million into state coffers, Gov. Ed
mund Brown Jr.'s finance director said yesterday.
And workers are enjoying a real increase in in
come for the first time si nee 1973, because the infla
tion rate has dipped sharply while personal income
is spurting ahead of estimates, Finance Director
Roy Bell told a legislative committee.
Personal income will rise 10.9 percent, while the
consumer price index will go up only 5.9 percent
this year according to the new estimates.
All of those factors point to an over-all state
budget surplus — including unappropriated re
venue sharing and oil leasefunds — ofsBB2 million
at the end of the new fiscal year in mid-1977, said
nonpartisan Legislative Analyst A. Alan Post.

More money for California
SACRAMENTO—California's booming recovery
from the recession of the past two years will pump
an extra $567 million into state coffers, Gov. Ed
mund Brown Jr.'s finance director said yesterday.
And workers are enjoying a real increase in in
come for the first time si nee 1973, because the infla
tion rate has dipped sharply while personal income
is spurting ahead of estimates, Finance Director
Roy Bell told a legislative committee.
Personal income will rise 10.9 percent, while the
consumer price index will go up only 5.9 percent
this year according to the new estimates.
All of those factors point to an over-all state
budget surplus — including unappropriated re
venue sharing and oil leasefunds — ofsBB2 million
at the end of the new fiscal year in mid-1977, said
nonpartisan Legislative Analyst A. Alan Post.

Democrats elect new chairman
WASHINGTON — The Democratic party's plat
form committee switched chairmen yesterday and
elected a drafting subcommittee heavy with sup
porters of presidential contender Jimmy Carter.
Gov. Philip Noel of Rhode Island opened the
committee's final four days of hearings by an
nouncing that he was stepping down to spare the
committee any embarrassment from recently re
ported remarks he made about black ghetto home
life.
Gov. Wendell Anderson of Minnesota then was
elected unanimously, on Noel's recommendation,
as permanent chairman of the platform committee.
Addressing an opening session of the final series
of hearings by ,the party's platform committee,
Party Chairman Robert Strauss said internal bicker
ing had kept the party out of power for eight years
but that Democrats have closed ranks for the 1976
campaign.
"The Democratic party fully understands now
what we couldn't understand in the past — that our
internal bickering and internal warfare brought the
nation nothing but disaster," Strauss said.
"The Democratic party, in myopia, bitterness,
pettiness and often downright stupidity, brought
Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford upon the American
people," Strauss said.
Michigan primary: Test for Ford
WASHINGTON — President Ford and Ronald
Reagan stayed home yesterday, while Democrats
Jimmy Carterand Morris Udall went to Ford's home
state of Michigan.
Michigan is holding Republican and Democratic
presidential primaries* today, and the GOP vote in
his home state is considered a crucial test for Ford,
who has lost five of the last six primaries to chal
lenger Reagan.
Reagan's national campaign chairman Sen. Paul
Laxalt of Nevada, said yesterday a Reagan victory in
Michigan "would be tantamount to a nomination"
for the former California governor.
Quakes hit Russia and Northwest
Two earthquakes jolted a mountainous area in
Russia and a section of the northwest United States
yesterday.
A severe earthquake caused serious damage and
some casualties yesterday in a mountainous part of
Soviet central Asia, officials said, but major cities in
the area appeared unharmed.

The earthquake which struck the sparsely
populated Kulzhuktau area in the Uzbek republic
1500 miles southeast of Moscow was reported to be
several times more powerful than one which devas
tated northeast Italy early this month.
The fourth earthquake to originate in the Strait of
Georgia in six months has shaken an area from
northern British Columbia to Olympia, Wash., a
distance of about 300 miles.
The quake, registering 5.4 on the Richter scale,
caused minor damage but no injuries Sunday, offi
cials said.
In White Rock, 8.C., near the U.S. border, win
dows were broken and people said they were
knocked out of bed. It was about 1:35 a.m.
Ehrlichman's convictions upheld
WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court yes
terday upheld conspiracy and perjury convictions
of former White House assistant John Ehrlichman
for authorizing the break-in of the office of Daniel
Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
The three-judge court also upheld the conviction
of Gordon Liddy, the former White House official
who planned the 1971 burglary against Dr. Lewis
Fielding.
But the court reversed the convictions of Eugenio
Martinez and Bernard Barker, the Cuban exiles who
actually broke into the doctor's office and searched
