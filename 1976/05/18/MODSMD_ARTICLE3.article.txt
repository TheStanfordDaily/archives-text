WASHINGTON â€” Criminal charges
recently brought against former Chi
lean cabinet minister Fernando Flores
by the Chilean military junta will di
minish the computer scientist's
chances of coming here soon to take
the research position he has accepted.
The junta has held Flores in jail
without charging him with a crime
since shortly after the September 1973
overthrow of Marxist President Sal
vador Allende's government.
Flores is being charged with
smuggling and misuseof publicfunds,
according to Rebecca Shaw, secretary
to the Chilean Ambassador to the Un
ited States.
Various groups and individuals who
are trying to free Flores, including
Amnesty International, Rep. Paul
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) and Presi
dent Richard Lyman, have urged Au
gusto Pinochet, head of the military
junta, to release Flores.
'State of siege 1
Hut the junta will no longer be able
to intervene, according to Shaw.
Flores cannot be released in the same
manner as 49 detainees who were re
cently released during Treasury Sec
retary William Simon's visit to Chile
because "these people were held be
cause of the state of siege, not theft,"
Shaw said.
Shaw said she did not know when
Flores would be brought to trial.
The charges of smuggling arose
from the alleged non-payment of cus
toms duty on "1000 Mercedes-Benz
chassis which he (allegedly) brought
into Chile," Shaw said.
The second charge is for "misuse of
public funds," she added.

Flores may be acquitted when he fi
nally comes to trial on these charges,
according to a U.S. government
source.
"If he goes to civil trial, he's in good
shape. I doubt that they can convict
him," said the source, even though
civil trials in Chile are conducted ac
cording to the Napoleonic code, under
which the accused must prove himself
innocent.
No jury
Trials are conducted by a judge or
panel of judges, not with a jury. The
civil courts are "good and indepen
dent," according to the source. Judi
cial appointments are made by the
executive and confirmed by the legis
lature. A certain amount of training
and various credentials are required of
judges before they can be appointed,
he said.
"If he's convicted." predicted the
source, "there will be such a hue and
cry internationally that they'll have to
let him go."
No harm
McCloskey, in his personal effort to
help free Flores, wrote to the Chilean
Ambassador, Manuel Trucco March
29.
Flores' application to enter the Un
ited States under the parole program
for Chilean detainees and refugees has
been approved by the State Depart
ment.
The State Department has not re
ceived a response from Chilean au
thorities indicating whether they will
allow Flores and his family to depart,
according to Robert McCloskey, Assis
tant Secretary of State for Congres
sional relations.
