### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger says he would
prefer to quit his post after the
November election even if President
Ford were nominated and elected.
Kissingeralso said the United States
would defend the Panama Canal "if
necessary."
Referring to his future in the ad
ministration. Kissinger said: "On the
whole, I would prefer not to stay" even
if Ford were elected.
His comments came in an interview
with Barbara Walters broadcast yes
terday on NBC's Today shovt'. A trans
cript was released Sunday.

"On the other hand, I don't want to
say today, when I don't know the cir
cumstances that exist, the necessities
that the President may feel he has, that
I won't even listen to hiin, but on the
whole I would prefer to leave."
If Ford lost, Kissinger presumably
would not be asked to join the new
administration. Many of the Presi
dent's opponents have criticized some
aspects of Kissinger's policies.
Some of Ford's advisers believe that
one of the President's necessities now,
if he is to win nomination and election,
is to get rid of his controversial secret
ary of state.
Ford's opponent for the Republican
presidential nomination, Ronald
Reagan, has scored a surprising string
of primary victories while flailing at
Kissinger's conduct of foreign policy.
And Ford's campaign manager, Ro
gers Morton, has said it is unlikely that
Kissinger will be in any Ford cabinet
after the election.
"1 don't want to tie the conduct of
foreign policy to me personally," Kis
singer said in the interview. "If a
foreign policy is well designed, then it
should be able to be carried out by
many people. So, on the whole, I
would prefer not to stay."
Kissinger said he did not feel bat
tered by Reagan's slings and arrows.
"Foreign policy is an important as
pect of the lives of Americans and most
secretaries of state have been the sub
ject of attack at one point or another,"
he said. "I don't look at my task as a
political one. I have to do the best I can

for peace and the economic factors of
the United States and I can't worry
about particular political attacks."
But he conceded: "My father, who
collects news clips 011 me, indicates
that he would prefer getting different
ones than the ones he has been receiv
ing. I would prefer more anonymity,
but I can live with what is going on."
Kissinger has not always professed
imperviousness to attack.
He threatened to quit during a news
conference in Salzburg, Austria, in
early 1974 after allegations that he par
ticipated in illegal wiretap activities.
Kissinger had thought about resign

ing even earlier, according to State
Department spokesman John Trattner.
"The secretary had always thought
that he would probably resign after the
Vietnam war was over," Trattner said
last month. "He had decided to leave
as soon as U.S. troops had left Vietnam
and peace looked well on the way to
being established. However, as Water
gate developed he decided he could
not leave."
Turning to the Panama Canal, which
Reagan has made one of the main is
sues in his battle with Ford, Kissinger
said. "If necessary, we will defend the
Panama Canal."
