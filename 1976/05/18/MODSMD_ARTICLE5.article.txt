## 
### Lori Matsukawa ASSU reporter 
The ASSU Senate approved the
nominations committee report which
included the names of newly ap
pointed committee members last
night.
The action was preceded by fierce
debate over a nominations committee
decision to re-open the application
process for the Committee on Educa
tion and fclmplovment of Women
(CEEW).
There are current ly two new appoin
tees to the CEEW, both under
graduates. Six members of the nomina
tions committee proposed to keep the
third position open to a graduate
applicant despite the availability of
"qualified" undergraduate candidates
for that position.

"The duty of the nominations com
mittee is to select the most qualified
students to sit on committees from the
pool of applicants we receive," said
nominations committee member Jor

dan Schwartz in a written statement he
presented at the meeting.
"If and only if we find that we do not
have enough qualified applicants may
we re-open the application process."
Schwartz protested that holding one
spot on the committee open for a
graduate student discriminates
against qualified undergraduates who
applied for the position.
Graduate student Liz Krainer. one of
the committee members who sup
ported the proposal, said that there
was "no one qualified" for the remain
ing spot.
Krainer also said that there was in
sufficient advertising of committee
application deadlines.
Equality
Sen. Bruce Reznick. a supporter of
the proposal, said, "we didn't feel we
could achieve equal student represen
tation (on the CEEW) by choosing
three (candidates) from the five."
Sen. Bob Ottilie said the proposal's
supporters were presenting a "totally
fake argument."
Ottilie claimed that there was suffi
cient advertising. "The people (who
support the proposal) were not on the
(nominations) committee when the
advertising began. Schwartz and
(former nominations member) Tom
Price assured me that they put up
flyers in every residence.
Senators Sarah Alfadl, Elizabeth
Larkam, Tim Conway, Reuben San
chez, Bruce Reznick, Roy Tolles and
Bill Tyndall voted for the re-opening
of the CEEW position to graduate stu
dents while senators Brad Krevoy,
Barbara Rizzardi, Bob Ottilie and Steve
VVestly voted against it.
In other action, the senate approved
a resolution that would force the Pub
lications Board to transfer $1450 to the
Course Guide account by a vote of 9-2
with senators Ottilie and Rizzardi vot
ing against the resolution.
The senate also voted its support for
a human rights policy which would
prohibit discrimination by the Univer
sity on the basis of sexual preference.
At next Monday night's meeting, a
proposed ASSU Constitutional
amendment which would delete all
sexist wording will be discussed.

In other action, the senate approved
a resolution that would force the Pub
lications Board to transfer $1450 to the
Course Guide account by a vote of 9-2
with senators Ottilie and Rizzardi vot
ing against the resolution.
The senate also voted its support for
a human rights policy which would
prohibit discrimination by the Univer
sity on the basis of sexual preference.
At next Monday night's meeting, a
proposed ASSU Constitutional
amendment which would delete all
sexist wording will be discussed.


JOURNALISM'S BIG CHEESE — Political columnist Joseph Kraft, who spoke
here recently, says he threatened suing the government tor wiretapping him
instead of actually filing suit because "I felt foolish suing the President. . .
The ASSU Senate approved the
nominations committee report which
included the names of newly ap
pointed committee members last
night.
The action was preceded by fierce
debate over a nominations committee
decision to re-open the application
process for the Committee on Educa
tion and fclmplovment of Women
(CEEW).
There are current ly two new appoin
tees to the CEEW, both under
graduates. Six members of the nomina
tions committee proposed to keep the
third position open to a graduate
applicant despite the availability of
"qualified" undergraduate candidates
for that position.
Quality
"The duty of the nominations com
mittee is to select the most qualified
students to sit on committees from the
pool of applicants we receive," said
nominations committee member Jor

dan Schwartz in a written statement he
presented at the meeting.
"If and only if we find that we do not
have enough qualified applicants may
we re-open the application process."
Schwartz protested that holding one
spot on the committee open for a
graduate student discriminates
against qualified undergraduates who
applied for the position.
Graduate student Liz Krainer. one of
the committee members who sup
ported the proposal, said that there
was "no one qualified" for the remain
ing spot.
Krainer also said that there was in
sufficient advertising of committee
application deadlines.
Equality
Sen. Bruce Reznick. a supporter of
the proposal, said, "we didn't feel we
could achieve equal student represen
tation (on the CEEW) by choosing
three (candidates) from the five."
Sen. Bob Ottilie said the proposal's
supporters were presenting a "totally
fake argument."
Ottilie claimed that there was suffi
cient advertising. "The people (who
support the proposal) were not on the
(nominations) committee when the
advertising began. Schwartz and
(former nominations member) Tom
Price assured me that they put up
flyers in every residence.
Senators Sarah Alfadl, Elizabeth
Larkam, Tim Conway, Reuben San
chez, Bruce Reznick, Roy Tolles and
Bill Tyndall voted for the re-opening
of the CEEW position to graduate stu
dents while senators Brad Krevoy,
Barbara Rizzardi, Bob Ottilie and Steve
VVestly voted against it.
