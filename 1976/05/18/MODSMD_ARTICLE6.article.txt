Members of the Graduate Student Council (GSC) said
yesterday they feared the University might use money
saved by the implementation of need-based fellowships
for purposes other than financial support for graduate
students.
Council member Paulette Britton said "How do we
make sure that they will not take what we are saving and
put it in a new building?"
Dean of Graduate Studies VV. Bliss Carnochan said he
would not support a need basis for fellowships unless it
would mean an increase in aid for graduate students.
Under the need-based aid plan, Ph.D. candidates' finan
cial resources would be used to determine the amount of
aid they received.
Council Chairman Deric Jennings said that with outside
fellowships drying up, it will he more difficult for the
University to maintain the same level of aid in the future.
A fellowship is support given to a student under the
only condition that the student be enrolled.
Controversial area
Thecouncil discussed the criteria which should be used
to determine a student's financial condition, an area
which Jennings said was very controversial.
In a report to the council Jennings said, "There seems to
be little argument that (a student's financial situation) is
the irreducible minimum for the need criteria."
Thecouncil also discussed the use of parents' resources
in determining the level of support, bast year, the GSC

approved a formula which would take a student's parents'
income and assets into account, as well as the student's
own resources.
The Graduate and Professional Schools Financial Aid
Service (GAPSFAS) was one formula proposed for figur
ing the amount a student and his parents should contri
bute.
Last year the council voted tousetheGAPSFAS formula
as an accounting method only, using a University method
for figuring the level of aid.
According to Jennings, some members said last year
that the GAPSFAS form was too long and required too
much detailed information.
No! flexible
Council member Linda Fields said the GAPSFAS form
did not allow forany unusual circumstances in a student's
situation.
As an alternative. Carnochan mentioned the use of a
plan under which all students would receive tuition and a
set amount for living expenses without filling out any
forms. Only students wishing additional financial sup
port would have to fill out financial statements.
The council recommended last year that a spouses' in
come be taken into account only if the spouse had an
exceptionally high salary.
The Council also outlined exceptions to ths use of the
parents' income in figuring the level of support last year
