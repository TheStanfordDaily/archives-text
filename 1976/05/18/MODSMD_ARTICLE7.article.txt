## Support boycott 
### 
We support the group of economics
graduate and undergraduate students
boycotting all economics classes tomor
row to show their support for Assoc.
Economics Prof. Duncan Foley. We also
encourage all students taking economics
courses not to go to class tomorrow and,
instead, go to scheduled teach-ins on the
tenure question during class time.
After spending six years at MIT as an
assistant and associate professor. Foley
took a job as associate professor of
economics here. When he arrived, he
was promised a decision on tenure
within the span of his three-year ap
pointment.
During the third year of that appoint
ment, the Economics Department de
cided against granting tenure to Foley
and extended his contract three more
years as a non-tenured associate profes
sor.
Foley was then offered tenured posi
tions at other schools and asked the de
partment here to reconsider its decision.
The department refused to budge. So it
appears that Foley will leave after June
1977, and a teacher and a scholar will be
gone.
We encourage the department to re
consider once more its decision on

Foley. His scholarship and teaching re
cord have been superior, not only in his
three years here, but also in his six years
at MIT.
Foley has had 16 papers published in
major economics journals since 1967 —
including four papers during his first
two years at Stanford — three of which
were published in major journals. The
fourth is still in working paper form.
By all accounts, that is a fine record for
any professor. In fact, the Economics
Department's search committee, which
sought recommendations of faculty
members at other schools, unanimously
approved Foley for tenure and voted to
promote him to full professorship status.
As a teacher, Foley has excelled. He
won a prestigious teaching award at MIT
and has been lauded by both under
graduates and graduate students for his
ability to explain difficult and highly
technical subjects.
Unlike many other economics profes
sors here, Foley has taken time to study
the Marxist alternative to neoclassical
and Keynesian economics.
We hope that no one in the Economics
Department would seriously consider
holding this against him in the granting
of tenure.
