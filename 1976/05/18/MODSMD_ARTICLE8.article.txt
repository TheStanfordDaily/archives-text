# Boycott not warranted

A group of economics stu
dents has been leading a protest
against the failure of the
Economics Department to grant
tenure to Assoc. Economics Prof.
Duncan Foley. Though I am un
qualified and consider it impru
dent to extensively discuss the
qualifications of Foley, I would
like to discuss the department's
policy and the protest.
Not having taken any classes
from Foley. I have no basis for
judging his teaching ability
beyond conversations with stu
dents who have taken his clas
ses. And 1 have heard a large
range of views.
Nor do 1 — or any other stu
dent except advanced graduates
— have the necessary experience
to make a judgment of a profes
sor's research.
Personnel decisions are hand
led best by experienced faculty
who are better able to make
judgments concerning the qual
ity of a professor's research, pro
viding of course that they con
sider student opinions of the
professor's teaching ability.
Not actively protest
Because of the difficulty stu
dents have in judging research
and the imprudence of having
them judge their own professors,
students should not actively pro

test tenure decisions unless the
professor involved is unques
tionably an excellent teacher. It
is not clear to me that this re
quirement has been met in this
case.
Some have suggested that the
decision not to grant Foley te
nure at this time was politically
motivated. I doubt that this was
the case.
Last year the department went
to great lengths to hire a Marxist
as a full, tenured professor. The
professor they hired is a hard
line Marxist-Leninist and I do
not mean to suggest that he is not
a valuable addition to the fa
culty.
Foley was promised consider
ation for tenure within three
years, and this he was given. But
consideration for tenure does
not mean a yes-no decision as
the protesting students' leaflet
incorrectly states.
Though I cannot personally
judge the wisdom of the
Economics Department's deci
sion, I respect the department's
judgment and have no reason to
doubt its sincerity.
Others included
Many have objected to the de
partment's refusal to make pub
lic the precise reasons for the te
nure decision. Even assuming
that Foley has no objections to a

public discussion, there are
other people involved.
Another professor was
granted tenure this year; it
would be difficult to avoid com
parisons with this professor in a
public discussion.
However, regardless of the vis
ion of the decision, a student
boycott of classes is a most un
wise means of protest. It is
highly unlikely that the depart
ment will succumb to this sort of
pressure; if anything the protest
is likely to have the opposite ef
fect.
The losers will be the students
who miss their lectures.
Contrary to the implication of
the protesting students' leaflet,
there are other means of protest
remaining, such as a mass letter
campaign or a petition drive.
Hiring and tenure decisions
are difficult and delicate affairs
over which students should be
reluctant to take publicaction. In
this case, at least, 1 am willing to
accept the department's judg
ment.
Of course the above views are
entirely my own and do not
necessarily reflect those of the
Undergraduate Economics As
sociation.
