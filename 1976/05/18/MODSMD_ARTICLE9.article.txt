# Support Foley boycott
## 
### 
Stewart, et. al.

As members of Economics
Prof. Duncan Foley's Economic
53 class, we urge support for the
boycott of all economics classes
on Wednesday, May 19. It is our
judgment, drawn from painful
and personal experience, that
Foley teaches by far the superior
class in the core series (Econoics
1, 51, 52 and 53).
He is unusually responsive to
student questions and criticisms
concerning both course content
and structure. He has gone out of
his way to be innovative in class
format, assignments and his use

of the tutorial method.
He presents economics as a
science of human activity, chal
lenging the standard assump
tions and relating his field to our
own lives at the University. It is
important to us that this kind of
teaching continues at Stanford.
Presently, it appears Foley
will not be here after next year,
due to the tenure decision
handed down by the Economics
faculty on May 3. We demand
that the faculty be held account
able for this decision and pub-

licly explain its reasoning.
The secrecy which surrounds
the tenure process only rein
forces a sense of student impo
tency with respect to the powers
which shape our education. Par
ticipation in the boycott will
show support both for Foley and
for responsible tenure decisions
at Stanford.
Please join with us on Wed
nesday.

and Nick Nvhurt are under
graduates in economics.)
