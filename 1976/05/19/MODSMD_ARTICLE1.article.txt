Two young men and four male
juveniles have been booked on various
charges resulting from incidents last
weekend at the Stanford Powwow,
Sgt. Ronald McLeister of the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Office con
firmed yesterday.
The two adults were identified by
McLeister as Bluch Blackfeather, 18, of
Oakland and Larry Bronson, 22, of
Four Corners, Ariz.
Bronson is registered as a student at
Merritt College, Merritt College Asst.
Dean of Students Ceorge Herring con
firmed Monday.
According to a spokesman for the
Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion, the persons arrested were merely
in attendance at thePowwowand were
;iot involved in organizing it.
Both Blackfeather and Bronson are
being held on charges of strong-arm
robbery and possession of stolen prop
erty.
Two of the four juveniles are being
held on auto theft and possession of
stolen property charges, the third is
being held on strong-arm robbery
charges and the fourth is being held on
strong-arm robbery and possession of
stolen property charges.
As of yesterday morning, the two
adults were being held in the Santa
Clara County main jail after failing to
post bail, McLeister said. He added
that the four juveniles were still in the
custody of Santa Clara County juvenile
authorities.
According to McLeister, the group
was arrested around 1:30 p.m. Sunday
in the oak grove on the north side of the
Stanford Stadium in a car reported sto
len in Oakland.
The strong-arm robbery charges
stem from an incident reported early
Saturday by a male hitchhiker.
McLeister said the hitchhiker claimed
he was beaten and robbed by "five In
dians." The complaintant has iden
tified three of the six males in custody,
McLeister added.
The possession of stolen property
charges stem from two alleged
burglaries at the Powwow. Sgt.
Stephen Lawson of the Department of
Public Safety said a tent and an auto
were broken into over the weekend.
McLeister said some of the property
stolen in those burglaries was reco
vered after the arrests.
According to McLeister, the sheriffs
office is still searching for an adult
female suspect and a male juvenile
suspect. He added that the district at
torney would probably wait until they
are in custody before deciding on final
charges for all of the suspects.
