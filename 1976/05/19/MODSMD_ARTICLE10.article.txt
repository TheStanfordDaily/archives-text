# Present nuclear regulation inadequate

Critics of the Nuclear
Safeguards Initiative, Prop. 15,
will assure you that nuclear
power plants are and have been
operating smoothly and safely
for years. For example, Carolyn
Kovacevic said in the May 5
Daily, "Operating nuclear plant
safety systems are continually
tested and retested year-in and
year-out as a routine matter."
There is, however, substantial
evidence to the contrary.
Let's take a close look at what
happened at the Browns Ferry
Nuclear Generating Plant in
Alabama on March 22, 1975.
First, some background in
formation. Each of the two reac
tors at Browns Ferry was equip
ped with the legally required
emergency core cooling systems
(EECS). The function of these
systems is to keep the reactor
core covered with water in case
the primary cooling system fails.
This is good because if all the
cooling systems of a reactor fail,
even though the reactor may
have been shut down (i.e., all of
the control rods put in), the reac
tor core will nonetheless melt
down and out of the contain
ment vessel.
Clearly then it is important to
primary and back-up
cooling systems as physically
separate as possible. Unfortu
nately, at Browns Ferry the con
trol cables for all these systems
met in a single cramped cable
spreading room underneath the
central control room for the
Browns Ferry reactors. A fire oc
curing in this cable spreading
room could conceivably knock
out all of the cooling systems.
In fact, all 56 operating U.S.
nuclear power plants and all but
13 of the 142 U.S. plants now
being built or planned have
exactly one cable spreading

room. The government's Nuc
lear Regulatory Commission
(then the AEC) tried to get the
nuclear industry to build two
cable spreading rooms per reac
tor but was forced to back down
in its demand in the face of stiff
industry opposition.
At noon on March 22, 1975,
two electricians at Browns Ferry
were next to the cable spreading
room using a lighted candle to
find air leaks in the walls where
the cables went in and out. Just
as had happened a few days ear
lier, the candle flame ignited the
polyurethane foam which was
being used to plug the leaks.
System failed
The resulting fire raged for six
hours during which reactor Unit
One's entire ECCS system failed.
In fact, all the following systems
failed: the normal feed water sys
tem, the reactor core spray sys
tem, the reactor core isolation
cooling system and the low and
high pressure ECCS systems.
Also the fire rendered inopera
tive most of the instrumentation
which tells the control room
what is going on in the reactor.
Just two pumps prevented a
meltdown, but neither one alone
was designed to cool the reactor
and it was impossible to operate
both of them simultaneously.
The men fighting the fire were
plagued with problems too. For
example, the cable room's built
in automatic carbon dioxide fire
extinguishing system had been
previously disabled by the elec
tricians. Persons trying to manu
ally activate this system were
impeded by metal construction
plates placed over the approp
riate boxes.
Advice not followed
Contrary to the advice of the
Athens, Alabama fire chief, the
plant superintendent insisted on

fighting the fire with chemicals.
After six hours and several re
quests from the fire chief, the
superintendant finally had
water put on the fire. It was out
in 20 minutes.
How could so much go
wrong? Doesn't the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission have
any fire inspectors? No. In fact,
as Norman Mosely, the NRC reg
ional director of inspection who
was responsible for Browns
Ferry admits, "Our inspectors
look at less than one percent of
what goes on in a plant." Says
Donald Knuth, the NRC's direc
tor of inspection, "The licensee
is supposed to do his own in
spection."
Browns Ferry happened just

last year. We were lucky then.
We may not be as lucky in the'
future.
Clearly the industry and the
government's regulatory board
are incapable of regulating the
industry in the public's best in
terests. Proposition 15 makes it
possible for the public, through
its representatives, to decide
whether or not nuclear power
plants are as safe as the industry
claims.
For once let's make sure we
have a potentialy dangerous
situation under control before
someone gets hurt, before the
earth gets scarred for a long, long
time.
