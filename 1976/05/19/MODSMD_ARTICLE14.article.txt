What is the kindest method of killing snaiJs? I favor attracting them
with coffee cans filled with beer and buried at ground level so that
they will die happily; however, a friend of mine boils them Maine
lobster style. -V.G.
Although this letter was addressed to Vilia Kakis (how soon they
forget!) our staff will deign to answer it anyway.
Assoc. Biology Prof. Ward Watt feels that there really isn't
a kind method of killing snails. "Any way that you do it they're
dead, and that's probably their main objection," he said. Watt also
doubts that the snails die a blissful death in the beer since he said
they probably don't drink it.
"Snails are scavengers and they're probably attracted to the beer
by its smell, which resembles fermentation," Watt said. Then, once
they get their little heads in, they fall in and drown.
If you don't like the idea of drowning innocent gastropod mol
lusks, you can poison or smother them. Gardening services use
snail bait, which kills instantly. And an employe at the Cambridge
Hardware store recommended placing a thick layer of ashes around
your plants. Crawling through it, the tiny snails choke to death.

Are there duty-free shops at the San Francisco airport? Signs along
101 point at the exit to "Airport Shops," but the only buildngs in
that urea seem to be air-freight terminals. If the duty-free shops
exist, can we buy things? -M.C.
Although the signs along 101 refer only to maintenance shops,
there is a duty-free shop within the airport terminal. However, to
shop there you must produce a boarding pass for a direct interna
tional flight. They will load what you buy on the plane or will hand
it to you as you board.
