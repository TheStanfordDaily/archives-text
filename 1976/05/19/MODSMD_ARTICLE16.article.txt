Where can I buy a vibrator? What different kinds
are there? What is a french tickler? Do Ben-wa
balls really exist?
For your Wednesday titillation, may I offer the
Under Covers Consumer Guide to Sexual Acces
sories.
Dildos are rubber cylindrical objects that bear a
striking resemblance to a popular part of the male
anatomy. They come in various lengths â€”
everywhere from around four inches to as much as
a foot long, depending on the amount of fulfill
ment desired. Contrary to popular opinion, they
are not primarily used by lesbians, but are com
monly used by heterosexuals for vaginal and anal
penetration.
Vibrators are basically vibrating dildos, al
though most are made of hard white plastic. If
your pulsating shower head is worn out, a vibrator
will have you humming with pleasure in no time.
God, I hope my mother doesn't read this. Vibrators

also come in a variety of lengths.
French Ticklers are squiggly-looking rubber
circles that fit around the shaft of the penis. They
supposedly add a little extra stimulation for the
clitoris. They are available in several colors and
shapes.
Ben-wa balls (also known as Rin-no-tama balls)
are a set of two balls inserted into the vagina. But
these are no ordinary balls. One is hollow, and the
other is weighted. One rolling against the other is
supposed to produce interesting vibrations, espe
cially when the owner is walking around. Try
them some morning in Calculus when Sunseri is
especially boring.
All of these items are available at most "adult
book" stores. If you would rather not be seen
within three blocks of those establishments,
check out the the mail-order ads in such finer
publications asPenthouse, Hustler, Screw and the
Berkeley Barb.
