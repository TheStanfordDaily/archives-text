## Mayer unhappy, but plans to stay 
### Jill Lieber 
Doctors haven't yet figured
out what makes Stanford tennis
player Gene Mayer "tick." There
is an aura of mystery to the in
juries that have been hampering
the junior from Mendham, N.J.
this year. Have the injuries been
physical or have they been
psychological?
Most of this season Mayer has
been sidelined with a pulled
back muscle. One of his team
mates says, though, "It's pretty
obvious that Mayer is making up
his injuries because he doesn't
want to play intrasquad chal
lenge matches."
Another team member added

that one injury Mayer had
claimed was a sore nipple, irri
tated by the insignia on a tennis
shirt.
Mayer said a doctor had pre
scribed bedrest for him during
the challenge match period and
that he played all his matches
when having difficulty with the
shirt insignia.
Mayer, however, said his back
has bothered him since he was
15.
After he had finished playing
the pro circuit winter quarter,
Mayer reinjured his back. He
said the injury was never given a
chance to heal because men's
tennis coach Dick Gould had

him play challenge matches.
Gould said Mayer's back prob
ably would have healed faster if
Mayer had not played challenge
matches at the beginning of the
season. However, Gould said
playing Mayer was "important
for team morale."
Mayer said the challenge
matches were unnecessary and
not good for him due to his phys
ical condition. He said he be
lieved that his past tennis ex
perience should have automati
cally placed him above the other
members on the team.
"Saviano turned pro and he
was 24 spaces behind me in the
U.S. rankings. None of the other

guys on the team ranked. None
had as good a Stanford record as
I had. None had as good a world
ranking as 1 — 120 th. The next
closest was in the 3005," Mayer
said.
He said that he has had prob
lems with Gould over his posi
tion on the team ever since his
freshman year, but decided to
remain on the team to retain his
scholarship.
"1 would not quit the team
—not so much out of allegiance
to the team and to Goach, as to
owing the school something. In
that respect, the $24,000 worth
of scholarship is worth some
thing to me. In a sense I have
duties, but on the other hand, 1
find it tough to get really in
spired about playing," Mayer
said.
"Unless you're the top player,
there isn't that much competi
tion. The results aren't that im
portant — they don't really
count!'
Mayer said many college ten
nis coaches "overemphasize"
winning.
"University competition is not
actually essential for a person to
become a professional tennis
player. I don't probaby regard it
as highly as others on the team."
Although many tennis team
members live in fraternities,
Mayer has chosen to live off
campus since the latter part of

his freshman year. He explains
"I think people who are in frats
are those whodidn't get drunk in
high school and now that they're
at Stanford they go all out."
Mayer knows he's got an
image of being cocky but so did
his brother, Sandy, former
NCAA singles and doubles
champ.
"Sandy was thought to be
cocky. He's very sure of himself.
1 was much more outgoing.
People think my walk is cocky —
the way 1 carry myself.
But he says, "You shouldn't
have to hold back the fact that
you thought you played well."
"He's a great guy," said wo
men's tennis coach Anne Hill.
"A lot of people think he's an
ass, but he's really a great guy."
By living alone, Mayer said he
is able to study without distrac
tions. There are moments of si
lence in which he can con
template what he calls a mean
ingful part of his life — Christ
ianity — which Mayer first dis
covered last fall.
"It's enabled me to deal with a
lot of problems I saw with my
self. It's given me a peace of
mind. Your peace of mind off the
court affects your peace of mind
on the court. Lots of times 1 had
trouble relaxing before 1 went on
the court. Now I relax by reading
my Bible."

Gene Mayer
Doctors haven't yet figured
out what makes Stanford tennis
player Gene Mayer "tick." There
is an aura of mystery to the in
juries that have been hampering
the junior from Mendham, N.J.
this year. Have the injuries been
physical or have they been
psychological?
Most of this season Mayer has
been sidelined with a pulled
back muscle. One of his team
mates says, though, "It's pretty
obvious that Mayer is making up
his injuries because he doesn't
want to play intrasquad chal
lenge matches."
Another team member added

that one injury Mayer had
claimed was a sore nipple, irri
tated by the insignia on a tennis
shirt.
Mayer said a doctor had pre
scribed bedrest for him during
the challenge match period and
that he played all his matches
when having difficulty with the
shirt insignia.
Mayer, however, said his back
has bothered him since he was
15.
After he had finished playing
the pro circuit winter quarter,
Mayer reinjured his back. He
said the injury was never given a
chance to heal because men's
tennis coach Dick Gould had

him play challenge matches.
Gould said Mayer's back prob
ably would have healed faster if
Mayer had not played challenge
matches at the beginning of the
season. However, Gould said
playing Mayer was "important
for team morale."
Mayer said the challenge
matches were unnecessary and
not good for him due to his phys
ical condition. He said he be
lieved that his past tennis ex
perience should have automati
cally placed him above the other
members on the team.
"Saviano turned pro and he
was 24 spaces behind me in the
U.S. rankings. None of the other

guys on the team ranked. None
had as good a Stanford record as
I had. None had as good a world
ranking as 1 — 120 th. The next
closest was in the 3005," Mayer
said.
He said that he has had prob
lems with Gould over his posi
tion on the team ever since his
freshman year, but decided to
remain on the team to retain his
scholarship.
"1 would not quit the team
—not so much out of allegiance
to the team and to Goach, as to
owing the school something. In
that respect, the $24,000 worth
of scholarship is worth some
thing to me. In a sense I have
duties, but on the other hand, 1
find it tough to get really in
spired about playing," Mayer
said.
"Unless you're the top player,
there isn't that much competi
tion. The results aren't that im
portant — they don't really
count!'
Mayer said many college ten
nis coaches "overemphasize"
winning.
"University competition is not
actually essential for a person to
become a professional tennis
player. I don't probaby regard it
as highly as others on the team."
Although many tennis team
members live in fraternities,
Mayer has chosen to live off
campus since the latter part of

his freshman year. He explains
"I think people who are in frats
are those whodidn't get drunk in
high school and now that they're
at Stanford they go all out."
Mayer knows he's got an
image of being cocky but so did
his brother, Sandy, former
NCAA singles and doubles
champ.
"Sandy was thought to be
cocky. He's very sure of himself.
1 was much more outgoing.
People think my walk is cocky —
the way 1 carry myself.
But he says, "You shouldn't
have to hold back the fact that
you thought you played well."
"He's a great guy," said wo
men's tennis coach Anne Hill.
"A lot of people think he's an
ass, but he's really a great guy."
By living alone, Mayer said he
is able to study without distrac
tions. There are moments of si
lence in which he can con
template what he calls a mean
ingful part of his life — Christ
ianity — which Mayer first dis
covered last fall.
"It's enabled me to deal with a
lot of problems I saw with my
self. It's given me a peace of
mind. Your peace of mind off the
court affects your peace of mind
on the court. Lots of times 1 had
trouble relaxing before 1 went on
the court. Now I relax by reading
