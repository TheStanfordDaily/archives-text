# DiBiaso signs top prep
## Cards get All-State guard from Colorado 
### Chris Baker 
Stanford basketball coach
Dick Dißiaso has added another
prospect to his already impres
sive list of cage recruits. Doug
Barnes, an All-State guard from
Lakewood, Colo., has signed a
national letter of intent to attend
Stanford, Dißiaso announced
Monday afternoon.
Barnes, a 6-foot-l 180 poun
der, averaged 20.5 points per
game last season at Green Moun
tain High School. A three-year
starter, Barnes had a career scor
ing average of 18.7. He averaged
6.7 rebounds and 3.8 steals per
game last season.
"Doug is an excellent shoo
ter," said Dißiaso. "But he's also
a very fine ballhandler. He's a

strong physical player with out
standing speed. We think he'll
add outside scoring punch and
quickness to our team."
Paul Davis, who tutored
Barnes in high school, had a lot
of praise for his star guard. "I
think the best thing you can say
about him (Barnes) is that he
started every game for three
years," said Davis.
'Premiere guard'
"He's one of the premiere
guards in Colorado," said Davis.
"As a sophomore, he wound up
fourth on the all-time conference
scoring list."
Davis said that his star visited
over six colleges before making
his decision. "Doug has super
respect for both coaches (Di-

Biaso and Card Asst. Coach Bob
Frederick) at Stanford.When he
got back from his visit out there,
he told me that he'd never had
such a good visit," said Davis.
Barnes was heavily recruited
by New Mexico, Michigan State,
Wyoming and several other
schools.
Davis added that he thought
Barnes would have no trouble
making the transition from the
prep ranks to the Pacific-8. "He
played against some very good
competition here. I think he'll do
very well at Stanford."
Track prospect
Barnes is also an excellent
track prospect. He won the dis
trict 220 and placed second in
the 100 last weekend. He is fa
vored to win the 220 in the state
meet.
"When he was out here he ex
pressed an interest in running
track," said Stanford track coach
Payton Jordan. "Obviously he
wouldn't be able to do so (run
track) until after basketball sea
son was over. We're extremely
interested in him though," said
Jordan.
Barnes is the third player Di-
Biaso has signed this year. Last
month he announced that prep
All-Americans Kimberly Belton
and Tom Schmalzried had de
cided to come to the Farm.
Cupertino high prep star Curt
Rambis has been one of the most
heavily recruited players on the
Peninsula since Rich Kelley.
UCLA recruits
Although conference champ
UCLA may be losing Richard
Washington and Marques
Johnson to the ranks of pro bas
ketball next year, the Bruins
won't be hurting.
Coach Gene Bartow recently
announced that three high
school All-Americans are
headed for Westwood. Topping
the list is Los Angeles City
Player of the Year James Wilkes.
Wilkes, a 6-8 forward, averaged
19 points and 18 rebounds per
game last year.
Gig Sims, a 6-10, 200 pound
All-American center, should
help replace Washington. He av
eraged 27 points and 16 re
bounds per game last year for
Redondo Beach High School. He
also blocked six shots per game.
Darrell Alums, a 6-8, 230-pound
center, rounds out the Bruins'
list of All-Americans. Alums av
eraged 18.4 points and 18.4 re
bounds per game last year and
blocked 150 shots.
