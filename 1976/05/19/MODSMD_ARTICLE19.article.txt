# Young reveals baseball recruits
## 
### Linda Buddenberg 
Almost before the last spec
tator had trickled out of Sunken
Diamond following the final
game of the season Saturday,
Stanford baseball coach Ray
Young was already looking for
ward to the 1977 season.
"Recruiting has gone very
well," said Young. He is en
thusiastic about next season, as
some excellent new players will
join a returning lineup almost
intact from this year's season.
"We have a JC kid corning in to
take Steve Davis' place — if
that's possible," Young com
mented.
Todd Ervin, from Citrus JC in
Los Angeles, has "experience at
shortstop," according to Young.
The coach said he hopes that
Ervincan "pull the (Cardinal) in
field together" like Davis did
this year.
Young also added to his col

lection of outfielders with
5-foot-10 speedster Paul Ziegler.
He'll be battling it out with
Randy Wong, Mike Cordiroli,
Pepe Hinojosa and Larry
Reynolds — all pretty fast them
selves — for a place in the
lineup.
"It'll be hard to decide who to
play out there next year," said
Young.
Young also has added a new
battery to his squad. Catcher
Mike Freitas of Fremont and
pitcher Larry Kuhn of Torrance
will both be team members in
'77.
"Kuhn could fill a lot of holes
for us," said Young. "He's one of
the top pitchers in Los Angeles,
averaging 15 strikeouts a game."
Young praised this year's
team, saying he's "pleased with
the season, obviously," but he's
not wasting any time in making
sure he's just as pleased next
vear.
