# Ombudsman Goheen reports
## More students rap teaching 
### Lori Matsukawa 
More students are complaining
about ill-taught courses this year than
last year, according to Ombudsman
John Goheen.
"It's surprising the number of com
plaints we receive about ill-taught
classes, the teaching may be poor, the
course outline may not be followed,
the lectures are not given on schedules
— thingsof that sort," said Goheen last
night on KZSU's Campus Conference.
"I have to advise the student that
there is a process to follow. The stu

dent could talk to the instructor. If the
problem can't be solved, the student
can go to the department chairman, the
dean, the undergraduate dean if the
student is an undergraduate or the
graduate dean if the student is a
graduate," said Goheen.
"That's a long hard process," he ad
ded. "If we can find a short cut, that is
better."
The ombudsman's office, estab
lished in 1969, is "set up to receive
complaints, suggestions, give advice
and find ways of resolving problems

that arise in (this) bureaucratic institu
tion," said Goheen, an emeritus pro
fessor of philosophy. It serves 200-300
persons a year, he said.
"The principal power (of the om
budsman), if you want to call it that, is
persuasion — and of course the ability
to ask for information ... is a very
powerful factor in persuasion," said
Goheen.
He commented that even confiden
tial information can be obtained by the
office if necessary.
Goheen, who is serving his third
year as ombudsman, said that those
against whom complaints are made are
"generally reasonable" about correct
ing problems.
"There might be, and maybe some
times there is, a little resentment (to
wards my) barging into something
where I don't belong," he said. "But
using just ordinary tact avoids that
kind of (feeling)."
Faculty and staff also see him with
complaints, said Goheen. "Faculty
members may ask for procedures to
pursue if they're denied tenure. All
that kind of information we'd be glad
to give," he said.
"The tenure procedural questions
are written down very carefully, but
sometimes there's a problem of in
terpretation. We'd be glad to offer in
terpretations on these questions," said
Goheen. t
"For non-faculty members, there are
problems of status or appreciation of
their services may be overlooked by
the administrators," Goheen said.
"The best procedure is to bring it to the
attention of the personnel department,
who is responsible for that sort of
thing. We try to present (the com
plaint) sympathetically, from the point
of view of that person."

Faculty and staff also see him with

members may ask for procedures to
pursue if they're denied tenure. All
that kind of information we'd be glad
to give," he said.

are written down very carefully, but
sometimes there's a problem of in

Goheen. t
"For non-faculty members, there are
problems of status or appreciation of

THE BtKIK STOPS HERE — Ombudsman John (ioheen, who is in charge of
receiving complaints from disgruntled members of the University commun
ity. appeared on KZSU's Campus Conference last night.He said complaints by
students about poor teaching were on the rise.
More students are complaining
about ill-taught courses this year than
last year, according to Ombudsman
John Goheen.
"It's surprising the number of com
plaints we receive about ill-taught
classes, the teaching may be poor, the
course outline may not be followed,
the lectures are not given on schedules
— thingsof that sort," said Goheen last
night on KZSU's Campus Conference.
"I have to advise the student that
there is a process to follow. The stu

dent could talk to the instructor. If the
problem can't be solved, the student
can go to the department chairman, the
dean, the undergraduate dean if the
student is an undergraduate or the
graduate dean if the student is a
graduate," said Goheen.
"That's a long hard process," he ad
ded. "If we can find a short cut, that is
better."
The ombudsman's office, estab
lished in 1969, is "set up to receive
complaints, suggestions, give advice
and find ways of resolving problems

that arise in (this) bureaucratic institu
tion," said Goheen, an emeritus pro
fessor of philosophy. It serves 200-300
persons a year, he said.
"The principal power (of the om
budsman), if you want to call it that, is
persuasion — and of course the ability
to ask for information ... is a very
powerful factor in persuasion," said
Goheen.
He commented that even confiden
tial information can be obtained by the
office if necessary.
Goheen, who is serving his third
year as ombudsman, said that those
against whom complaints are made are
"generally reasonable" about correct
ing problems.
"There might be, and maybe some
times there is, a little resentment (to
wards my) barging into something
where I don't belong," he said. "But
using just ordinary tact avoids that
kind of (feeling)."
Faculty and staff also see him with
