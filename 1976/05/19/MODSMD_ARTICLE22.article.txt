excellent condition. However,
"They made a mistake in setting
it up. It was 6400 yards."
She explained that the course
should have been about 6200
yards for a women's par 74.
"They made us play men's
tees," she stated. "It was a mons
ter course." She added that the
thin fairways and high roughs
contributed to the high scores.
Palmieri agreed. "It was too
long," she said. "It wasn't set up
properly for women. I was kind
of disappointed."
Discussing her performance,
Cornett said, "Yesterday I
played awful. I think it was my
first round in the 80's in a long
time."
Cornett said that sore arms
plagued her during the tourna
ment. "Pam and I were OD-ing

on Ben-Cay," she said.
The golfers have one more
tournament this year — the
AIAW nationals in June at
Michigan. Cornett said, "I'm re
ally going to start working for
the nationals." Palmieri com
mented, "It'll be nice to have a
rest before the nationals. I think
everyone's a little bit tired."

Stanford's Pat Cornett and

stroke victory yesterday in the
two-day Daisy Duck Invitational
hosted by Oregon State at the
Emerald Valley Course outside
the Eugene area.
Cornett and Palmieri com

competition for a 323 on the par
74 course. The University of

lakson and Chris Aoki teamed
for second with a 340 total. Stan

Voss and Ellen Sale finished
fifth with a 349.
Individually, Rise Alexander

rounds of 76 and 79. Cornett's
scores of 82 and 79 earned her
second. Voss secured fourth
with a total of 163 and Palmieri
grabbed fifth with a 166.
Cornett said the course was in
excellent condition. However,
"They made a mistake in setting
it up. It was 6400 yards."
She explained that the course
should have been about 6200
yards for a women's par 74.
"They made us play men's
tees," she stated. "It was a mons
ter course." She added that the
thin fairways and high roughs
contributed to the high scores.
Palmieri agreed. "It was too
long," she said. "It wasn't set up
properly for women. I was kind
of disappointed."
Discussing her performance,
Cornett said, "Yesterday I
played awful. I think it was my
first round in the 80's in a long
time."
Cornett said that sore arms
plagued her during the tourna
ment. "Pam and I were OD-ing

on Ben-Cay," she said.
The golfers have one more
tournament this year — the
AIAW nationals in June at
Michigan. Cornett said, "I'm re
ally going to start working for
the nationals." Palmieri com
mented, "It'll be nice to have a
rest before the nationals. I think
everyone's a little bit tired."
