# Forood could lose spot in net nationals
## 
### 
After losing to teammate
Diane Morrison in a tournament
last weekend, No. 1 women's
netter Lele Forood will no longer
be guaranteed a spot on the Card
singles delegation to the U.S.
Tennis Association's Collegiate
Nationals next month.
Morrison beat Forood on
Saturday, 0-6, 6-4, 6-4, in the
semifinals of the Seventeen
Magazine Championships in
Merrifield, Va.
Therefore, according to
women netter Susie Hagey,
Forood will be playing in a five
person round-robin tournament
with Hagey, Morrison and
teammates Barb Jordan and
Marcy O'Keefe with the top four
to play singles at the nationals.
Previously, Hagey said,
Forood was guaranteed a singles

berth, while the other four
would have to battle for three
spots.
Forood said Morrison "played
really well" in their match,
while "I didn't play my best."
Forood had led, 4-1, in the sec
ond set, before, as Hagey said
"the whole match switched
around."
At the Seventeen tourney,
Hagey recalled, "all thegirls had
to wear the same dress, which
was kind of a joke."
Forood said there was a 10
p.m. curfew at the champion
ships, but noted "the rules were
never obeyed.
"They knocked one girl out of
the tournament when she didn't
come home at all one night, but
other than that, they didn't do
anything," she explained.
