Egypt, Syria attempt reconciliation
CAIRO — Egypt and Syria open high-level meet
ings today in a bid to end their nine-month feud and
clear a major obstacle from efforts to resolve the
Lebanese and Arab-Israeli disputes.
The prime ministers of the two countries will
meet today in Saudi Arabia to try to iron out differ
ences and arrange a summit meeting next month in
Riyadh between Presidents Anwar Sadat of Egypt
and Hafe Assad of Syria.
The high-level contacts were arranged jointly by
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Egypt and Syria fought
together in the 1973 war against Israel and then
disagreed last September over how to seek peace
with the Jewish state.
From Beirut, the Middle East Economic Survey
reported that one possible reason the Syrians ag
reed to sit down at a conference table with Egyp
tians was Saudi Arabia's offer to replace Iraq as
Syria's supplier of crude oil. Iraq shut off deliveries
to Syria last month in a dispute over an oil pipeline
agreement.
The U.S. State Department has insisted it played
no part in arranging the meeting. However, it is no
secret that Washington and the Saudis have been
cooperating closely in Mideast diplomatic moves.
Giscard d'Estaing defends detente
WASHINGTON — President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing of France defended the concept of detente
with Communist countries yesterday, calling it an
"open and sincere approach" which does not imply
a surrender of Western values.
Addressing a joint session of Congress, Giscard
suggested the United States continue efforts to seek
an accommodation with the Soviet Union despite
renewed tensions between the two countries.
"Detente is an open and sincere approach," Gis
card said on the second day of his Bicentennial
visit. "It requires perserverance; it means we must
keep our eyes open. It must be based on reciproc
ity."
Giscard defined detente as development of com
mon interests and mutual trust with Communist
nations.
Lobbyists attack Democratic leaders
WASHINGTON — Lobbyists accused democratic
congressional leaders yesterday of disregarding
their party's platform and stalling on the reforms it
suggested.

Witnesses in the second day of the platform
committee's final hearings said Democrats in pub
lic office should be made to follow the principles of
the party's platform.
"Your Democratic leadership in Congress has
cynically ignored major planks in your 1972 plat
form," David Cohen, president of Common Cause,
told the committee.
Cohen said the 1972 platform had called for
stringent controls against conflict of interest among
congressmen and executive branch officials.
"The House of Representatives has dragged its
feet on such legislation and continues to allow con
gressmen to serve on committees where they can
advance their personal financial interests, a prac
tice the platform specifically singled out as an
abuse that should be eliminated," Cohen said.
"The Democratic party should hold its leaders in
Congress to account," he said.
San Francisco firm cries "uncle"
SAN FRANCISCO — Radicals may be incited to
new violence by a savings and loan firm's decision
on slum housing repair made after two terrorist
bombings, police said yesterday.
The bombs exploded last week in two offices of
the Bay View Federal Savings & Loan, causing
damage but no injuries.
The bank was on the "scumlord" list of the ter
rorist New World Liberation Front, a group claim
ing responsibility for many recent bombings in
Northern California.
A Bay View official, who declined to be iden
tified, said the firm agreed to the NWLF's terms
because the four dilapidated homes "are just not
worth killing for."
But Elwood Hansen, Bay View's board chairman,
said yesterday that the decision to fix up the homes
and sell them had been made before the blasts.
"We just pushed the announcement ahead a
month to end the bombings," said Hansen.
PUC investigates gas producers
SAN FRANCISCO — All producers of California
natural gas under contract to supply Pacific Gas &
Electric Co. must show why they should not be
regulated as public utilities, the state Public
Utilities Commission (PUC) said yesterday.
The PUC noted that last year the price increase by
California producers jumped from 45 cents per
thousand cubic feet to 75 cents per thousand cubic
feet and that substantial increases are expected in

the future.
"California gas producers have asked for price
increases of up to 213 percent," declared Commis
sioner Leonard Ross.
"Such outrageous demands would increase the
overall PG&E rates for gas customers by 18 percent
or $2.80 per month for the average residential cus
tomer. Today the PUC is taking the first step to
prevent unlimited escalation of California natural
gas prices."
Besides attempting to show why they should not
be regulated, producers and others named are to
supply information within 30 days concerning
rates and other charges.
Arab youth dies in West Bank clash
JERUSALEM — Israeli police killed a 21-year-old
Arab man when they opened fire on a band of riot
ers yesterday near the Church of the Holy
Sepulcher during day-long clashes in the heart of
the Holy City.
He was the third Arab to die in three days of
intensified anti-Israeli unrest on the occupied West
Bank. The latest death and the clashes brought
Israeli-Arab antagonism to a new pitch.
It was the most violent outbreak in Jerusalem in
nearly four months of West Band rioting in which
10 Arabs have been killed by Israeli forces. Officials
have listed most of the deaths as accidental or self
defense.
Levi hears busing arguments
WASHINGTON — Civil rights leaders told Atty.
Gen. Edward Levi yesterday that he could launch a
return to 19th century segregation if he joins an
tibusing forces seeking a Supreme Court review of
court-ordered busing in Boston.
But Boston leaders opposed to busing argued that
Levi could help ease tension in the troubled city if
he joins with them.
Levi made "absolutely no commitments to either
side" and signaled that he won't rush to a decision,
said Justice Department spokesman Robert Havel.
At the White House Press Secretary Ron Nessen
was asked how President Ford feels about the Bos
ton busing case.
"Any decision to intervene in the Boston busing
case will have to be made by the attorney general,"
Nessen said.
