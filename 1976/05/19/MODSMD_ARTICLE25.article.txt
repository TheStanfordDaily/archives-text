### Jenny Olney 
A higher percentage of "A"s was
given winter quarter than autumn
quarter, according to statistics is
sued last Thursday by the Regis
trar's Office. However, the percen
tage of "A"s was still lower than
last year.
The most dramatic increase was
in the School of Earth Sciences,
where 35 percent of all grades given
winter quarter were "A"s, com
pared to 24 percent autumn quarter.
Approximately 900 grades were re
ported each quarter.
In the School of Humanities and
Sciences, "A"s went from 33 per
cent in the autumn to 36 percent in
the winter. Approximately 25,000
grades were reported each quarter.
In the School of Engineering,
"A"s went from 33 percent to 34

percent. Approximately 6600
grades were reported each quarter.
Registrar Sally Mahoney said she
did not think the slight increase
represented a significant change."
The percentage of "D"s given
remained the same as in autumn
quarter: one percent in the
humanities and sciences and less
than one percent in earth sciences
and engineering.
The "D" was reinstituted this fall
as the lowest passing grade.
In the humanities and sciences,
the percentage of "B"s given also
remained the same as in autumn
quarter: 26 percent. In Engineering,
"B"s dropped slightly from 30 per
cent to 29 percent. The largest
change was in Earth Sciences
where "B"s rose from 19 percent to
