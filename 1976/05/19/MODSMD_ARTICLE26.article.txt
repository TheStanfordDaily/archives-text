# Econ boycott today
## 
### 
Economics graduate and under
graduate students opposing their de
partment's move to delay a tenure de
cision on Assoc. Prof. Duncan Foley
will boycott all economics classes to
day.
Along with the boycott of classes,
organizers plan picketing in front of
each economics classroom and teach
ins on the tenure question scheduled
during the regular class time.
The students' demands to the de
partment include:
—reconsideration of Foley's tenure
decision;
—student participation on the
Economics Department's search and
tenure committees;
—making public student evalua
tions of graduate economics classes.
Students wrote a letter to Economics
Department Chairman Bert Hickman
last Friday asking him and other senior
faculty members to discuss the de
partment's tenure decision on Foley in
an open meeting tomorrow at noon.
However, Hickman replied on Mon
day that "in view of the confidential
nature of such discussions under
long-standing departmental and uni
versity policy," he would not attend
the meeting.

Organizers also said they may ask
Foley to appeal the decision to reap
point him. Such an appeal would in
volve a faculty grievance procedure in
which the faculty member could claim
a violation of his academic freedom,
according to Sue Horst, assistant to
Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs Arthur
Bienenstock.
