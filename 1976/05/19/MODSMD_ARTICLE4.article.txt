## Debaters speak out for the candidates 
### Kyra Subbotin 
Representatives for seven presiden
tial candidates met last night inKresge
Auditorium for "Issues and Answers:
A Symposium on the Presidential
Candidates."
The symposium, organized by the
Stanford Committee on Political Edu
cation (SCOPE), was the first in what
will be a series of events focusing on
"Campaign 76"
The representatives described the
candidates' stands on the economy,
foreign policy and government integ
rity to approximately 200 persons.
Candidates represented were
California Gov. Edmund Brown, Jr.,
former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter,
Sen. Frank Church (D-Id.), President
Gerald Ford, Roger MacBride, former
California Gov. Ronald Reagan and
Rep. Morris Udall (D-Ariz.).
Frank Verlot, chairman of the Santa
Clara County Ford Committee, advo
cated voting for Ford, commenting,
"Ford's program includes a plan for
prosperity, peace and trust.
"We've come a long way; Ford is

stressing economic measures to stop
inflation. We've had very high un
employment . . . but it's getting bet
ter."
Verlot went on to say that the
"dreadful chapter" of Southeast Asia
was over and that, "Europe is now
looking to us for leadership."
Church's son, Forrest, a Stanford
alumnus and Ph.D. candidate at Har
vard University, spoke on behalf of his
father.
"What my father has to offer," he
said, "is 20 years of fighting powers in
Was hi ngton."
He said his father's late start was a
result of continuing participation in
the Senate Intelligence Committee.
"He didn't want to leave one job half
finished," Church said.
Peter Boland, a Ph.D. candidate in
urban planning here and a Brown sup
porter, remarked that Brown was the
only candidate who was questioning
the role of government.
"He (Brown) is open about what
government can do . . . what govern
ment should do."

Cohen, a Carter supporter, said,
"Jimmy Carter is not willing to give
simple answers to complex questions.
He has been accused of running
against Washington. But Carter be
lieves that government can be respon
sive."
Cohen continued, "Carter is talking
sense, not ideology. He is not an
ideological candidate; those who are
looking for an ideological candidate in
him are going to be disappointed."
Michael Brady, a Menlo Park attor
ney, supported Reagan and his stand
on the Panama Canal issue. "The issue
here is not whether we should give
back those rights to the canal."

Reagan's philosophy is "simple,"
according to Brady. "It's a libertarian
philosophy," he claimed, ". . . let the
private sector perform, show strength
in national affairs and show suspicion
towards the Soviet Union."
In support of Macßride, the
Libertarian Party candidate for presi
dent, Williamson Evers said Macßride
would try to bring a "better moral qual
ity" to American life.
Political Science Department
Chairman Richard Brody spoke in
favor of Udall, pointing out that the
congressman has served 15 years in
the House of Representatives and has
sponsored important election reform
legislation.

Candidates represented were
California Gov. Edmund Brown, Jr.,
former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter,
Sen. Frank Church (D-Id.), President
Gerald Ford, Roger MacBride, former
California Gov. Ronald Reagan and
Rep. Morris Udall (D-Ariz.).
Frank Verlot, chairman of the Santa
Clara County Ford Committee, advo
cated voting for Ford, commenting,
"Ford's program includes a plan for
prosperity, peace and trust.
"We've come a long way; Ford is

stressing economic measures to stop
inflation. We've had very high un
employment . . . but it's getting bet
ter."
Verlot went on to say that the
"dreadful chapter" of Southeast Asia
was over and that, "Europe is now
looking to us for leadership."
Church's son, Forrest, a Stanford
alumnus and Ph.D. candidate at Har
vard University, spoke on behalf of his
father.
"What my father has to offer," he
said, "is 20 years of fighting powers in
Was hi ngton."
He said his father's late start was a
result of continuing participation in
the Senate Intelligence Committee.
"He didn't want to leave one job half
finished," Church said.
Peter Boland, a Ph.D. candidate in
urban planning here and a Brown sup
porter, remarked that Brown was the
only candidate who was questioning
the role of government.
"He (Brown) is open about what
government can do . . . what govern
ment should do."

Cohen, a Carter supporter, said,
"Jimmy Carter is not willing to give
simple answers to complex questions.
He has been accused of running
against Washington. But Carter be
lieves that government can be respon
sive."
Cohen continued, "Carter is talking
sense, not ideology. He is not an
ideological candidate; those who are
looking for an ideological candidate in
him are going to be disappointed."
Michael Brady, a Menlo Park attor
ney, supported Reagan and his stand
on the Panama Canal issue. "The issue
here is not whether we should give
back those rights to the canal."

Reagan's philosophy is "simple,"
according to Brady. "It's a libertarian
philosophy," he claimed, ". . . let the
private sector perform, show strength
in national affairs and show suspicion
towards the Soviet Union."
In support of Macßride, the
Libertarian Party candidate for presi
dent, Williamson Evers said Macßride
would try to bring a "better moral qual
ity" to American life.
Political Science Department
Chairman Richard Brody spoke in
favor of Udall, pointing out that the
congressman has served 15 years in
the House of Representatives and has
sponsored important election reform
legislation.
