# Brown wins Maryland; Ford triumphs twice
## 
### 
From the Associated Press
President Ford won a Michigan
landslide last night and matched his
vital home state victory over Republi
can challenger Ronald Reagan with
another in the Maryland presidential
primary election.
California Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.
swept past Democratic frontrunner
Jimmy Carter to win easily in the Mary
land primary.
Carter narrowly led Rep. Morris
Udall of Arizona in the Michigan
Democratic contest with the unofficial
vote tally nearing completion. But a
late report of Udall votes in a Detroit
suburb and a mixup in the counting
left a Carter victory in doubt there.
With 96 percent of the precincts
counted, Carter was gaining 44 per
cent and led by 2464 votes.
Ford said in Washington that his
home state triumph "is really going to
put us on the road to that victory" for
the Republican presidential nomina
tion.
"This is going to play very, very well
all over the United States," the Presi
dent said.

Stuart Spencer, deputy manager of
the Ford campaign, said the outcome
would be a tremendous psychological
boost for the President's campaign,
staggered by five losses to Reagan this
month.
Michigan was the election Ford had
to win; he said it was a must. His man
agers had worried that conservative
Democrats might rally to Reagan in the
open Republican primary. But the
President, a 13-term Grand Rapids
congressman before he became vice
president, walked away with it.
Spencer called the outcome a shot in
the arm, said it put Ford within reach
of first-ballot nomination at the Repub
lican National Convention, but added
"it's still going to be a very tough
fight."
As the results poured in, Brown was
already courting delegates in Rhode
Island and New Jersey.
Reagan, after a rest at his Pacific
Palisades home, attended a fundrais
ing meeting in suburban Toluca late
yesterday. He told reporters he wasn't
surprised at the Michigan results, and
said he is still confident of winning the

nomination.
Brown's California campaign
chairman, Assembly Speaker Leo
McCarthy, told the Associated Press he
thought Brown would win in Mary
land "but not by such a wide margin."
"Given the fact that Jerry Brown has
been campaigning only three weeks in
Maryland, and Jimmy Carter has paid
scores of visits there over the past two
years, 1 think it's a serious blow to Car
ter and makes Brown a national con
tender without any doubt," McCarthy
said.
These were the figures:
Michigan
With 90 percent of the precincts re
porting,
Ford 682,892 or 67 percent.
Reagan 329,724 or 32 percent.
The balance was uncommitted.
That had Ford ahead for 57 nominat
ing delegates, Reagan for 27.
Among the Democrats,
Carter 272,195 or 44 percent.
Udall 258.553 or 42 percent.
The rest of the vote was split among
five other candidates.
Carter led for 69 delegates, Udall 58,
because they were apportioned on the
basis of congressional district as well
as statewide vote.
Alabama Gov. George Wallace
was ahead for two delegates, with four
uncommitted Democrats ahead.
Maryland
With all of the precincts reported
counted:
Ford 94,784 or 58 percent.
Reagan 68.916 or 42 percent.
Ford led for 43 delegates, Reagan for
none, because of pluralities in partial
counts from the congressional dis
tricts.
On the Democratic side,
Brown 283,956 or 49 percent.
Carter 216,687 or 37 percent.
The rest of the vote was divided
among five other entries.
In separate balloting for delegates
Carter led for 32 and Udall for 7. The
popular vote primary had no bearing
on delegate selection and Brown had
no delegate slate entered.
