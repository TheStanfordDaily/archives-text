# Solzhenitsyn blasts KGB
## 
### 
Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Aleksandr Solzhenit
syn said yesterday that the Soviet KGB has forged a letter
trying to show that he spied on fellow labor camp prison
ers in 1952.
In a statement issued at the Hoover Institution, the
Nobel laureate called the letter "bunk." A photocopy of
the letter was provided Solzhenitsyn early this week by a
Swiss journalist, who said he assumed it was a KGB
forgery.
"KGB lies are prepared in such a way as to provoke
discord and disrupt harmony in Eastern Europe because it
is precisely the consolidation of our forces that com
munists fear most of all," Solzhenitsyn said.
"Never yet have the authorities of our country displayed
such ridiculous weakness and lack of support in accusing
their enemy of collaboration — with themselves!
"With the Soviet system and its blood-sucking KGB!
With all its military and police might — what an open
exposure of mental confusion!" he stated.
'Caught'
Solzhenitsyn noted that two years ago, "the KGB was
caught falsifying my handwriting on correspondence
with Vassili Orekhov. whom I had never written."
He stated that although Time magazine "presented por
tions of my own handwriting, comparing it with the KGB
fabrication, the KGB have shamelessly persisted on their
course, as I predicted they would do."
The new letter includes names and groups plotting
against guards at the Ekibastuz forced labor camp. It is
signed "Vetrov," a pseudonym used by Solzhenitsyn in
The Gulag Archipelago.

"During the past 14 years, theentirebunglingapparatus
of the Soviets and all of their hired historians were unable
to answer my publications with any facts or logical argu
ments," said Solzhenitsyn.
"Since they have nothing on hand — no evidence, no
ideas of their own — the KGB, in accordance with its
fraudulent ways — recently produced a falsified docu
ment dated 1952 which states that 1 had informed the KGB
about the revolutionary movement in forced labor
camps."
Forged letters
Solzhenitsyn stated that he has "in hand entire letters of
several pages that were forged by the KGB." He said that
the KGB used letters he had written his ex-wife during his
labor camp days and "as well as they could, diligently
copied my handwriting.
"However, brought down from men to beasts, they
could not come up with my ways of expression and my
own image. The fabricators even distorted the realities of
the actual state of affairs in labor camps.
"This distinction can be seen by any human being who
has read Ivan Denisovich or Circle or who would compare
The Archipelago with the KGB's pitiful facsimile. The
third volume of Archipelago portrays the fiery spirit of
those turblent days of the Ekibastuz coup rebellion which
the KGB's latest forgery dares to address itself."
Solzhenitsyn predicted: "There will come a time —
when my Ukrainian fellow-inmates will also get their
chance to speak up and will openly mock these concoc
tions and will talk about our true friendship."
