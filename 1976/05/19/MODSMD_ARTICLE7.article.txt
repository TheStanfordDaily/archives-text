# Committee seats still open

For the pa§t several weeks, the ASSU Commit
tee on Nominations has been interviewing stu
dent applicants for positions on University com
mittees, and it is now continuing this process into
a second round to fill those positions still vacant
after the first round of interviews. The purpose of
this article is to inform students that there are
many committee positions still available, as well
as to shed some light on the operations and
decision-making processes of the committee on
nominations.
University committees are one of the prime
methods for student involvement in University
governance, and offer students the opportunity to
work on the specific issues that most concern
them. For example, a student who wants to have
input on University budgetary cutbacks should
consider an application to the Budget Priorities
Advisory Commission. A student who is particu
larly interested in the operation of the housing
system should consider an application to the
Committee on Services to Students (COSS) Sub
committee on Residences.
Similarly, other students who are concerned
about particular areas of University policy should
investigate which committees interest them and
apply for positions. The point is, 1 think, that
students must take the initiative if they are to have
an impact on University policy. The committee
system is an avenue of student input that all stu
dents — graduates as well as undergraduates —
who are concerned about University policy
should consider.
Function of committee
This brings me to the second portion of this
article, an explanation of how the Committee on
Nominations functions and actually reaches its
decisions as to which students are nominated for
University committees. The Committee is cur
rent y considering its criteria for selection and will
soon publish this information in its entirety so
that students will have a better idea as to how
candidates are selected.
Probably the most important criterion for selec
tion is the applicant's knowledge about the work
ings and subject areas of the particular committee.
Although re-applicants have a distinct advantage
in this respect, students who have not been mem

bers of University committees still have means of
discovering information about the role of a par
ticular committee.
One of the best ways to approach this is to
contact current student members of the commit
tee and question them about the workings of the
committee over the past year. Another
information-gathering method is to examine mi
nutes of past committee meetings, which are gen
erally available on file in the ASSU Office. Both of
these methods can generally provide the in
terested applicant with enough information as to
the workings of the committee.
Records available
With respect to the question of re-applicants, it
is worth noting that committee staff assistants
have provided the past year's committee atten
dance records to the Committee on Nominations
so that it is better able to evaluate re-applicants.
Previous committee experience is generally an
advantage, but a fresh perspective is also given
considerable weight by the Committee on
Nominations.
A second criterion for selection builds on the
first, given the student's knowledge of the role of
the committee, what particular ideas/issues is the
student interested in working on and how specific
proposals might be implemented. This involves a
certain amount of homework on the part of the
applicants, and may even involve talking to relev
ant administrators and faculty members.
What the Committee on Nominations is looking
for are those students who are aware of the work
ings of the committee, but also have some specific
ideas as to what the committee ought to be dealing
with in the upcoming year.
Perhaps a fitting conclusion to this brief de
scription of the committee process is an acknow
ledgement on the Nominations Committee's part
that the process is a subjective one and cannot be
totally devoid of bias. Nonetheless, the Commit
tee attempts to be as fair as possible in placing
what it feels are the most highly-qualified applic
ants on University committees. It is my hope that
all students who are interested in the remaining
committee positions pick up an application at the
ASSU office and return it by this Thursday.

students must take the initiative if they are to have
an impact on University policy. The committee
system is an avenue of student input that all stu
dents — graduates as well as undergraduates —
who are concerned about University policy
should consider.

This brings me to the second portion of this
article, an explanation of how the Committee on
Nominations functions and actually reaches its
decisions as to which students are nominated for
University committees. The Committee is cur
rent y considering its criteria for selection and will
soon publish this information in its entirety so
that students will have a better idea as to how
candidates are selected.
Probably the most important criterion for selec
tion is the applicant's knowledge about the work
ings and subject areas of the particular committee.
Although re-applicants have a distinct advantage
in this respect, students who have not been mem

bers of University committees still have means of
discovering information about the role of a par
ticular committee.
One of the best ways to approach this is to
contact current student members of the commit
tee and question them about the workings of the
committee over the past year. Another
information-gathering method is to examine mi
nutes of past committee meetings, which are gen
erally available on file in the ASSU Office. Both of
these methods can generally provide the in
terested applicant with enough information as to
the workings of the committee.
Records available
With respect to the question of re-applicants, it
is worth noting that committee staff assistants
have provided the past year's committee atten
dance records to the Committee on Nominations
so that it is better able to evaluate re-applicants.
Previous committee experience is generally an
advantage, but a fresh perspective is also given
considerable weight by the Committee on
Nominations.
A second criterion for selection builds on the
first, given the student's knowledge of the role of
the committee, what particular ideas/issues is the
student interested in working on and how specific
proposals might be implemented. This involves a
certain amount of homework on the part of the
applicants, and may even involve talking to relev
ant administrators and faculty members.
What the Committee on Nominations is looking
for are those students who are aware of the work
ings of the committee, but also have some specific
ideas as to what the committee ought to be dealing
with in the upcoming year.
Perhaps a fitting conclusion to this brief de
scription of the committee process is an acknow
ledgement on the Nominations Committee's part
that the process is a subjective one and cannot be
totally devoid of bias. Nonetheless, the Commit
tee attempts to be as fair as possible in placing
what it feels are the most highly-qualified applic
ants on University committees. It is my hope that
all students who are interested in the remaining
committee positions pick up an application at the
ASSU office and return it by this Thursday.

For the pa§t several weeks, the ASSU Commit
tee on Nominations has been interviewing stu
dent applicants for positions on University com
mittees, and it is now continuing this process into
a second round to fill those positions still vacant
after the first round of interviews. The purpose of
this article is to inform students that there are
many committee positions still available, as well
as to shed some light on the operations and
decision-making processes of the committee on
nominations.
University committees are one of the prime
methods for student involvement in University
governance, and offer students the opportunity to
work on the specific issues that most concern
them. For example, a student who wants to have
input on University budgetary cutbacks should
consider an application to the Budget Priorities
Advisory Commission. A student who is particu
larly interested in the operation of the housing
system should consider an application to the
Committee on Services to Students (COSS) Sub
committee on Residences.
Similarly, other students who are concerned
about particular areas of University policy should
investigate which committees interest them and
apply for positions. The point is, 1 think, that
students must take the initiative if they are to have
an impact on University policy. The committee
system is an avenue of student input that all stu
dents — graduates as well as undergraduates —
