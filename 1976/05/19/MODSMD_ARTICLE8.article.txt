# Letters: 'Campaign '76'

Political awareness
I want to commend the Daily
for reporting on the "Campaign
'76" week May 14. I realize that
because of limited space it was
not possible for the Daily repor
ter to explain fully all of the
problems which have been en
countered in trying to arrange
this week's political events.
The confusion which ap
peared prevalent in Stanford
Committee on Political Educa
tion's (SCOPE) organization is
the result of dealings with the
complex planning and strategic
considerations of each candi
date's campaign, rather than that
of an incompetent staff.
Several persons I know have
been working very hard for the
past few weeks trying to or
ganize an informative and excit
ing "Campaign '76" week, but
unfortunately they have con
fronted severe obstacles often in
the form of bureaucratic red
tape.
I think it would be unfair to
those who have expended so
much devoted effort and energy
on the upcoming week's events
to deny its merit if former Gov
ernor Edmund Brown Sr. speaks
instead of his son Jerry or if For
rest Church, who has been very
active in Frank Church's cam
paign. comes to represent his
father.

The success should be mea
sured by how well the "Cam
paign '76" events inform the
campus and the extent to which
the program exposes the Univer
sity's importance in the political
sphere.
The activities are planned
with the purpose of arousing
political consciousness and
concern about relevant issues.
Rather than to see Jimmy Carter
smile for 15 minutes, isn't it
more valuable to listen to a rep
resentative discuss his platform
and entertain questions for an
hour?
1 want to emphasize that
"Campaign '76" is not a week of
breath-taking thrills but rather of
informative intercourse. "Cam
paign '76" is a decisive and
much needed political activity
on a campus which has too often
been criticized for its lack of
political awareness and concern.

False impression
In Jerry Lampton's Daily arti
cle May 10 titled "Swedish taxes
too high" the reader is told that
"Even an individual earning
$12,000 per year pays 70 percent
of it in taxes." Furthermore,
Lampton says that to pay taxes
on incomes at a rate of 139 per

cent is not uncommon for weal
thier Swedes. It would be in
teresting to know where that in
formation comes from.
According to a brochure enti
tled Basic Facts about Sweden
published by Skandinaviska En
skilda Banken of Stockholm
(distributed by Swedish Infor
mation Sevice), the following
income tax applies to income re
ceived in 1975:
Gross income for Tax as per
year (converted centage of
to US $) income
6840 29.2
11,400 38.6
22,800 53.6
45,600 66.1
In my opinion the article by
Lampton is irresponsible and
gives a false impression about
conditions in Sweden.

of it in taxes." Furthermore,
Lampton says that to pay taxes
on incomes at a rate of 139 per

cent is not uncommon for weal
thier Swedes. It would be in
teresting to know where that in
formation comes from.
According to a brochure enti
tled Basic Facts about Sweden
published by Skandinaviska En
skilda Banken of Stockholm
(distributed by Swedish Infor
mation Sevice), the following
income tax applies to income re
ceived in 1975:
Gross income for Tax as per
year (converted centage of
to US $) income
6840 29.2
11,400 38.6
22,800 53.6
45,600 66.1
In my opinion the article by
Lampton is irresponsible and
gives a false impression about
conditions in Sweden.

I want to commend the Daily
for reporting on the "Campaign
'76" week May 14. I realize that
because of limited space it was
not possible for the Daily repor
ter to explain fully all of the
problems which have been en
countered in trying to arrange
this week's political events.
The confusion which ap
peared prevalent in Stanford
Committee on Political Educa
tion's (SCOPE) organization is
the result of dealings with the
complex planning and strategic
considerations of each candi
date's campaign, rather than that
of an incompetent staff.
Several persons I know have
been working very hard for the
past few weeks trying to or
ganize an informative and excit
ing "Campaign '76" week, but
unfortunately they have con
fronted severe obstacles often in
the form of bureaucratic red
tape.
I think it would be unfair to
those who have expended so
much devoted effort and energy
on the upcoming week's events
to deny its merit if former Gov
ernor Edmund Brown Sr. speaks
instead of his son Jerry or if For
rest Church, who has been very
active in Frank Church's cam
paign. comes to represent his
father.

The success should be mea
sured by how well the "Cam
paign '76" events inform the
campus and the extent to which
the program exposes the Univer
sity's importance in the political
sphere.
The activities are planned
with the purpose of arousing
political consciousness and
concern about relevant issues.
Rather than to see Jimmy Carter
smile for 15 minutes, isn't it
more valuable to listen to a rep
resentative discuss his platform
and entertain questions for an
hour?
1 want to emphasize that
"Campaign '76" is not a week of
breath-taking thrills but rather of
informative intercourse. "Cam
paign '76" is a decisive and
much needed political activity
on a campus which has too often
been criticized for its lack of
political awareness and concern.
