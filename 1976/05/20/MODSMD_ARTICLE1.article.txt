As he prepares this summer to leave the
post of dean of undergraduate studies
which he has held for six years, James
Gibbs believes that there "continues to be
a need to keep the University reminded of
the importance of undergraduate educa
tion."
In a report issued prior to the search for a
new dean and released to the public earlier this
quarter, Gibbs wrote that "the ethos of Stanford
continues to be oriented primarily to graduate
training and research."
Justifying the continued need for an under
graduate education officer, Gibbs noted that
"undergraduate education still, in some ways,
is a stepchild that must fight for a proper place
at the table."
Provost William Miller agreed that "during
the build-up of the graduate program, em
phasis has been on graduate teaching and re
search."
He also said that one of the most important
roles of the dean is "to capitalize on the
graduate education features."
Gibbs said in a Daily interview earlier this
week that particularly in this time of budgetary

constraint, the dean's role should be to "help
the University shape undergraduate educa
tion" and relate it to graduate teaching and
research.
Gibbs summarized the five-year review of
the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies (ODUS), commenting about the ac
complishments and problems which have oc
cured since its inception in autumn 1970.
Perhaps Gibbs' most controversial decision
during his tenure was his budget recommenda
tion in 1975, advocating the consolidation of
the extra-departmental programs (EDPs),
which would have eliminated both SWOPSI
and SCIRE.
Following sizable student opposition to this
recommendation, Gibbs appointed an ad hoc
panel on EDPs, whose report influenced the
dean to reverse his stand enabling the prog
rams to remain viable at least through June,
1979.
In his report, Gibbs admits a false assump
tion that the success of the "learning formats"
of the EDPs would be measured by their incor
poration into the regular structures of the Uni
versity.
