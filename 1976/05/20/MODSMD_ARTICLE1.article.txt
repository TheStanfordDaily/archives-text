As he prepares this summer to leave the
post of dean of undergraduate studies
which he has held for six years, James
Gibbs believes that there "continues to be
a need to keep the University reminded of
the importance of undergraduate educa
tion."
In a report issued prior to the search for a
new dean and released to the public earlier this
quarter, Gibbs wrote that "the ethos of Stanford
continues to be oriented primarily to graduate
training and research."
Justifying the continued need for an under
graduate education officer, Gibbs noted that
"undergraduate education still, in some ways,
is a stepchild that must fight for a proper place
at the table."
Provost William Miller agreed that "during
the build-up of the graduate program, em
phasis has been on graduate teaching and re
search."
He also said that one of the most important
roles of the dean is "to capitalize on the
graduate education features."
Gibbs said in a Daily interview earlier this
week that particularly in this time of budgetary

constraint, the dean's role should be to "help
the University shape undergraduate educa
tion" and relate it to graduate teaching and
research.
Gibbs summarized the five-year review of
the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies (ODUS), commenting about the ac
complishments and problems which have oc
cured since its inception in autumn 1970.
Perhaps Gibbs' most controversial decision
during his tenure was his budget recommenda
tion in 1975, advocating the consolidation of
the extra-departmental programs (EDPs),
which would have eliminated both SWOPSI
and SCIRE.
Following sizable student opposition to this
recommendation, Gibbs appointed an ad hoc
panel on EDPs, whose report influenced the
dean to reverse his stand enabling the prog
rams to remain viable at least through June,
1979.
In his report, Gibbs admits a false assump
tion that the success of the "learning formats"
of the EDPs would be measured by their incor
poration into the regular structures of the Uni
versity.



In fact, two of the University's most popu
lar courses, Human Sexuality and Sleep
and Dreams, were first taught as Under
graduate Specials.
But the ad hoc panel's report indicated to
Gibbs that the programs' success should
be measured "by the degree of student par
ticipation" in the programs' decision
making and curriculum-building.
Beginning next year, SWOPSI and
SCIRE will employ half-time under
graduates as co-directors, each working
with an administrator.
Alice Supton, director of SCIRE, said that
whatever differences of opinion" between
Gibbs and EDP supporters, occuring
last year when the programs' existences
were in jeopardy, now have been cleared
up. "This year he has been supportive of
particularly SCIRE's internship program
and tenure task force," she said.
Rally
Indeed, last year was rough for under
graduate education here. A rally in spring
mourned the death of undergraduate edu
cation," in reaction to efforts to end
SWOPSI and SCIRE, lack of emphasis on
teaching in tenure decisions and the tuition
increase.
On top of that, minority students attacked
Gibbs for his support of shifting the basis of
the University's financial aid policy to finan
cial need rather than minority status.
In a memo directed to Director of Finan
cial Aids Robert Huff, Gibbs wrote that the
aid cut would draw minority students "more
attuned to the intellectual goals that we es
pouse and to the elitist nature" of Stanford.
He added that the aid changes would
likely "bring us a different (and I think better)
mix of minority students . .. who have cho
sen Stanford because of its ethos rather
than in spite of it."
Former ASSU Vice President Josie
Jaramillo said the memo "seemed to sum
up the attitudes minority students felt was
and is widespread among the administra
tion."
Distribution requirement
But while controversy over EDPs, tenure
and the University's commitment to minor
ity students occupied the limelight in the last

two years, changes in the distribution re
quirement have also been a controversial
issue. Gibbs has felt pressure from both
students and faculty concerning distribu
tion.
"There is still a substantial segment of
faculty members who feel that the under
graduate curriculum is not sufficiently struc
tured," Gibbs said.
Next year, the requirements for entering
freshmen will be stricter, eliminating certain
courses from fulfilling requirements and
adding coherence to the courses taken.
But a Western culture requirement, re
commended by a presidential committee,
has been "shelved temporarily" by the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies, ac
cording to Gibbs, until the effects of the new
requirements are determined.
"I wouldn't anticipate any further
changes before two or three years at best,"
Gibbs remarked, although there will be con
tinued pressure for Western culture, foreign
language and perhaps non-Western cul
ture requirements.
Advisers
The relaxed course requirements have
had significant impact on the role of advis
ers, Gibbs' report notes, changing their
function from chiefly an information source
to an "avuncular counselor and advocate '
to help students achieve their academic
goals.
One of the innovations instituted by
ODUS in its first year was a "residentially
based format" for freshman advising.
Another change introduced by ODUS,
linked freshman seminars to residences,
with the instructors being members of the
dorm's "advising team" composed of fa
culty, staff and administration from diverse
fields.
But Gibbs perceives that a problem re
mains, especially in recruiting general ad
visers, because it is "not something most
faculty members are trained to do."
Gibbs cites the difficulty in recruiting
general advisers as being partially caused
by the University's "strong focus on re
search and graduate training."
Tenure
Tenure, in which undergraduates have
contended during the last two years that

research and publishing have assumed
disproportionate roles, is an area in which
Gibbs thinks progress is being made.
Gibbs indicated that progress recogniz
ing teaching has been made this year, as
compared to a year ago. (Last year the
Appointments and Promotions (A&P)
Committee denied tenure to then-Asst. Re
ligious Studies Prof. Jerry Irish, a winner of
the Gores award for excellence in teach
ing.)
Last year the A&P Committee denied te
nure to then Religious Studies Prof. Jerry
Irish, a winner of the Gores award for excel
lence in teaching..
Asst. Dean of Undergraduate Studies B.
Michael Closson praised Gibbs for "his out
spoken stand on teaching," although he
said that he did not perceive much effect on
University policy by his stands.
"The School of Humanities and Sciences
(H&S) has made progress toward a multi
faceted evaluation ot teaching," which
Gibbs thinks is an important step toward
having teaching efficiency play a more im
portant role in tenure decisions.
Teaching skills
He emphasized that course evaluations
should not be used just for promotions, but
also to assist members of the faculty to
improve their teaching skills.
Gibbs has also attempted to increase the
recognition of service to undergraduates by
professors who have been resident fellows,
freshman advisers, have taught in EDPs or
have served on committees which involve
undergraduate education.
However, during his term Gibbs has not
been able to clearly delineate the approp
riate role of the dean in the tenure process.
He has served on the A&P Committee of
H&S, provided written imput to the En
gineering School's Executive Committee
and — for all schools — participated at
the provostial level.
After discovering the very strong effect
procedural requirements have on searches
and the type of teaching, research and
scholarship evidence which is presented in
A&P folders, Gibbs has directed his atten
tion to the provostial level.
"These procedures are shaped very
strongly by decisions made by or initiated

by the provost's staff" and the review of
A&P papers by the Advisory Board, said
Gibbs.
Since his second year in office, Gibbs
has directed his attention exclusively to the
provostial level, partially because the H&S
deanery requested he not participate at
both levels, which could put a candidate in
double jeopardy.
But Gibbs has indicated that Psychiatry
Prof. Herant Katchadourian, who will take
over this September, will have to work out
his own role in the tenure process, perhaps
participating at both the school and provos
tial levels.
Katchadourian's position will differ from
Gibbs'. The former will be a vice provost as
well as dean of undergraduate education,
stressing the importance of working in close
conjunction with the provost. (Gibbs has
been a member of Miller's staff.)
Establishing the position dean of under
graduate studies as head of ODUS was
the direct result of the three year Study of
Education at Stanford (SES).
The 1966-1969 study concluded that
"the University should officially recognize
the need for enhanced and better focused
faculty and administrative attention to the
problems of undergraduate education."
The deanship essentially replaced the di
rector of general studies and the former
position of dean of undergraduate educa
tion, which existed in the early '60s.
Coordination
SES proposed a charge to the dean
which enjoined that "the principle functions
would be the coordination of general educa
tion, especially through interdisciplinary
programs and the promotion of continuing
curricular innovation at the undergraduate
level."
But SES also charged the dean as being
"the University's prime advocate for the in
terests of undergraduate education in its
academic or curricular aspect."
Clarifying what he believes his advocacy
role should be has been a crucial problem
for Gibbs in light of past criticism from stu
dents who objected to some of his stands.
Being "an advocate for students and an
advocate for undergraduate education are
not always the same," Gibbs stated. "The
concept of the dean as an 'advocate' for
undergraduate education is a nest for un
clear notions," he wrote.
Gibbs explained that he sees himself "as
being a spokesman for the general faculty
point of view of what undergraduate educa
tion is." (Gibbs is a professor in the An
thropology Department and will return to
teaching full time after a year on sabbati
cal.)
He wrote that undergraduate education
is "better served by my not flying in the face
of institutional consensus to champion
complete change."
Rather, in the long run it is important "to
move with that consensus to strengthen
existing features of undergraduate educa
tion as well as to institute the most needed
and most consequential changes first,"
Gibbs explained
Adversary relationships
"Realism requires" that the dean "not be
unnecessarily adversative in dealing with
the institution" and its prevailing "ethos
which is so strongly oriented to graduate
training and teaching."
But Gibbs recognizes the "advocacy"
role inherent in the position, particularly
with regard to securing adequate resources
— both financial and institutional — for un
dergraduate education.
Closson said that there has been a "big
internal difference" among ODUS person
nel concerning the extent to which the dean
should play an advocacy or catalytic role.
Closson said that he thought the dean
should be "more idea-generating and less
managerial," a problem that Gibbs recog
nizes in his study.
Gibbs wrote that a large amount of man
agerial time is mandated by the number of
ODUS's programs and services and the
"current administrative style" here, refer
ring to concern over budgetary reduction.
Gibbs admits he has been disappointed

not to have had enough time "for free think
ing, for talking to faculty and students with
out a particular agenda or task at hand."
Gibbs said that the new position should
allow the dean to become "more involved in
participation in top-level budget decisions,"
a crucial function during this budget
tightening period.
Miller indicated that there would "not be a
huge difference" between the new position
and Gibbs' functions. The dean has always
been involved in appointments and promo
tions, but only recently has participated in
the overall distribution of positions, Miller
reported.
Increased strength
Gibbs wrote in his report that his mem
bership on the provost's staff "has brought
strength to the deanery.'"
He stated, however, that "the provost's
office has not always understood the needs
of ODUS and, at times, it has been dilatory
in working to forge a solution to pressing
problems."
Gibbs also pointed out that some of his
office's efforts have "languished for lack of

provostial support," and charged that at
times "appropriate consultation . . . has
been eschewed when the Provost's Office
was considering making a major adminis
trative appointment in the area of under
graduate education." m
Closson remarked that the effectiveness
of the dean "depends upon the person in
the job and his or her ability to influence the
provost," who holds a very powerful posi
tion in the administrative hierarchy.
Katchadourian
Closson added that he hoped Katch
adourian would move in the direction of an
advocacy and catalytic role.
Katchadourian, who originated the
human sexuality course in the EDP prog
ram, has been reluctant to talk about ideas
and goals he has for ODUS in order not to
make Gibbs a "lame duck."
He is also concerned with finding out
"what students, faculty and administrators
think are the most salient. .. problems" of
the undergraduate education here, he
noted in an interview following his appoint
ment.
When he takes office, Katchadourian will
find an ODUS that has greatly increased
and improved its service to unoergraduate
education during the last six years through
many diffuse programs usually not as
sociated with the office.
The Academic Information Center (AIC)
opened in 1970 and has expanded from its
original function of providing a comprehen
sive base of academic information about
University courses and requirements as
well as providing catalogues from other
schools.
The AIC currently oversees the
individually designed majors program
started in 1971; offers pre-professional ad
vising for graduate study in medicine, law
and business; handles all non-declared
major advising and new student proces

sing; and prepares publications including
Course Abstracts.
ODUS is currently responsible for inter
school programs of Human Biology (one of
the most popular majors); Values,
Technology and Society: Physical Sci
ences and Urban Studies. In the future,
these programs will report to the dean of a
particular school.
The Learning Assistance Center, offering
courses on learning skills, reading skills
and peer counseling, has greatly expanded
its services during the last five years in the
area of group and individual tutorial.
While other achievements are too
numerous to list. ODUS has had its share of
failures to institute or maintain certain prog
rams. An exchange program with
Morehouse and Spelman colleges of the
predominantly black Atlanta University
complex died after one year, when the At
lanta colleges were unwilling to continue
the program, according to Gibbs report.
An interschool program called Child
hood and Society" floundered when a
senior faculty member was not found to
head the second phase of the program s
development, which would have translated
its blueprint into particular teaching and
budget commitments.
A Teaching Resources Center proposal
failed to gain provostial approval or support
from all the schools deans. Gibbs stated
that he was particularly disappointed in the
failure of this program because of the em
phasis he placed on improving instruction
Reviewing his success establishing new
programs, Gibbs emphasized the need of
the dean to "participate very actively at
each stage of development and rally sup
port for proposed programs."
Gibbs' recommendations for the future
indicated a need for the administration "to
be more explicit and straightforward about
its goals for undergraduate education.
