# Computer scientist takes out all the stops
## Don Knuth-computer scientist, organist...genius 
### Kevin Ohlson 
Donald Knuth, a computer science pro
fessor here, has a list of honors and
awards that rival the Housing Draw Book
let in length, yet his first mathematical
work was published in MAD magazine.
The incident illustrates his form of
humor. Knuth quietly smiles when he re
lates that the printout is still English in a
Romanian translation of a volume of his
computer instructions.
But there is a serious side to him too.
When he is not working on his seven
volume work, The Art of Computer
Programming, he can be found at his
home designed for his two-story $35,000
pipe organ, writing the Library of Con
gress for information on a rare piece of
music.
The organ is Knuth's pride and joy. He
is a member of the American Guild of Or
ganists, and is an associate organist at
Bethany Lutheran Church in Menlo Park.
Standing like a sentinel at the front part
of his house, the 11-month old organ has
been described by Knuth as "the most
successful home organ I've ever played. "
His professional academic career has
taken him to conferences all over the
world, and he always manages to find and
play an organ wherever he is.
Grand piano
He also enjoys his Boesendorfer grand
piano. He often plays duets, with his wife
accompanying on the alternate instru
ment. The piano has an unbelievable
ebony finish. When asked how he pro
tected it against his children, he replied,
"The hardest part is dog-proofing, not
kids."
The musical instruments are not the
only impressive features in the house he
and his wife, Jill, designed. His kitchen is
centered around the garbage receptacle,
when the mathematical model he de
signed told him that "everything in the
kitchen wanted to be next to it."
The floor in the family room is a compo
site of over 150 aerial maps of the San
Francisco Bay Area. One of the walls in
the same room is designed to be written
on (with a special erasable ink). Knuth

holds monthly seminars in this room.
Upstairs in the house is where his two
children, John, 10, and Jennifer, 9, sleep.
Across the stairs from the children's bed
room is his study. Portraits of dozens of
mathematicians decorate the walls. The
balding and bespectacled 38-year-old
Knuth does much of his work there.
On one desk is a terminal that can be
connected to computers at Harvard and
the University of Southern California as
well as Stanford. In the anteroom is a
steamer trunk of material for the fourth
volume of The Art of Computer
Programming.
An art
"The volumes are to summarize every
thing known about computer program
ming. I consider programming as much of
an art as writing," says Knuth. He wrote a
novel while in Norway on sabbatical. It is
about mathematics, but has a plot. Enti
tled Surreal Numbers, the book was
completed in less than a week.
"The idea of the book is anti-text, to
learn how people do research, and see
their mistakes," says Knuth. He notes with
pride that the book, the first of its kind, was
well received.
Computers have been a part of Knuth's
life since the late 19505. While an under
graduate at Case Institute of Technology
(now Case Western Reserve University),
he designed a program on basketball
statistics gathering, and was interviewed
by Walter Cronkite. The program ranked
each player by how much he contributed
overall. For example, a piayer would not
be awarded two points for a basket, as the
ball was turned over to the other team.
Knuth went on to graduate first in his
class, with a B.S. and M.S. in mathema
tics. He received his Ph.D. in mathematics
at Caltech, and stayed there to teach until
1968, when he accepted a professorship
here.
Enjoys teaching
Knuth says he enjoys teaching at the
University. He describes his graduate
students as "sharp," and his under
graduates as "enthusiastic."
His courses are not required, "so I can

make them hard," he says. "Those who
survive like the class," and Knuth gives
them credit. "I try to teach technical writing
in my classes. I guess I'm trying to be sort
of a scientific Strunk and White.
Scott Drysdale, graduate student in
computer science, thinks very highly of
Knuth. "I've TA'd for him. He's brilliant,
and well-liked by most students and pro
fessors. He's fun to talk to .. . not one to
talk all business."
Dick Karp, also a computer science
graduate student, agrees. "Knuth is very
eminent in his field. He understands ev
erything. I think he runs the department, or
influences it a great deal."
Budgets time
Karp admires Knuth's ability to budget
time. "Half the Computer Science Depart
ment wants to see him, yet he takes one
day off a week."
Knuth explains that his "day off" policy
is the result of an ulcer a few years back.
He says he worked too hard, and was
forced to change his lifestyle as a con
sequence. He claimed his personal dead
lines wore him down, and his family life
was suffering. Now he has time to do such

things as take art classes with his wife
(who illustrated Surreal Numbers).
His hard work did not go unnoticed. He
was the first winner of the Grace M. Hop
per Award for distinguished achieve
ments in computer science. Two years
ago he was awarded the Turing Award,
the highest honor of the Association for
Computing Machinery. Last year he was
elected to the National Academy of Sci
ences. and is one of their youngest mem
bers.
Knuth enjoys using the computer for
personal pleasure. He delights in analyz
ing the plots of Agatha Christie's books,
as well as Earle Stanley Gardner's Perry
Mason mysteries. He has almost a com
plete collection of both authors.
Knuth seems to enjoy the Stanford
community. His family enjoys having stu
dents come to the house to practice on the
organ. "These students provide wonder
ful concerts for us and the children," says
Knuth. His work, he says, is "still exciting
for me.
"I guess I've just been riding the crest of
a lot of waves."

Knuth enjoys using the computer for

PROGRAMMING AWAY — Donald Knuth is an avid and expert organist, and he is
shown sitting here playing the $35,000 organ in his home. When he's not playing
the organ, Knuth is a computer science professor here.
Donald Knuth, a computer science pro
fessor here, has a list of honors and
awards that rival the Housing Draw Book
let in length, yet his first mathematical
work was published in MAD magazine.
The incident illustrates his form of
humor. Knuth quietly smiles when he re
lates that the printout is still English in a
Romanian translation of a volume of his
computer instructions.
But there is a serious side to him too.
When he is not working on his seven
volume work, The Art of Computer
Programming, he can be found at his
home designed for his two-story $35,000
pipe organ, writing the Library of Con
gress for information on a rare piece of
music.
The organ is Knuth's pride and joy. He
is a member of the American Guild of Or
ganists, and is an associate organist at
Bethany Lutheran Church in Menlo Park.
Standing like a sentinel at the front part
of his house, the 11-month old organ has
been described by Knuth as "the most
successful home organ I've ever played. "
His professional academic career has
taken him to conferences all over the
world, and he always manages to find and
play an organ wherever he is.
Grand piano
He also enjoys his Boesendorfer grand
piano. He often plays duets, with his wife
accompanying on the alternate instru
ment. The piano has an unbelievable
ebony finish. When asked how he pro
tected it against his children, he replied,
"The hardest part is dog-proofing, not
kids."
The musical instruments are not the
only impressive features in the house he
and his wife, Jill, designed. His kitchen is
centered around the garbage receptacle,
when the mathematical model he de
signed told him that "everything in the
kitchen wanted to be next to it."
The floor in the family room is a compo
site of over 150 aerial maps of the San
Francisco Bay Area. One of the walls in
the same room is designed to be written
on (with a special erasable ink). Knuth

holds monthly seminars in this room.
Upstairs in the house is where his two
children, John, 10, and Jennifer, 9, sleep.
Across the stairs from the children's bed
room is his study. Portraits of dozens of
mathematicians decorate the walls. The
balding and bespectacled 38-year-old
Knuth does much of his work there.
On one desk is a terminal that can be
connected to computers at Harvard and
the University of Southern California as
well as Stanford. In the anteroom is a
steamer trunk of material for the fourth
volume of The Art of Computer
Programming.
An art
"The volumes are to summarize every
thing known about computer program
ming. I consider programming as much of
an art as writing," says Knuth. He wrote a
novel while in Norway on sabbatical. It is
about mathematics, but has a plot. Enti
tled Surreal Numbers, the book was
completed in less than a week.
"The idea of the book is anti-text, to
learn how people do research, and see
their mistakes," says Knuth. He notes with
pride that the book, the first of its kind, was
well received.
Computers have been a part of Knuth's
life since the late 19505. While an under
graduate at Case Institute of Technology
(now Case Western Reserve University),
he designed a program on basketball
statistics gathering, and was interviewed
by Walter Cronkite. The program ranked
each player by how much he contributed
overall. For example, a piayer would not
be awarded two points for a basket, as the
ball was turned over to the other team.
Knuth went on to graduate first in his
class, with a B.S. and M.S. in mathema
tics. He received his Ph.D. in mathematics
at Caltech, and stayed there to teach until
1968, when he accepted a professorship
here.
Enjoys teaching
Knuth says he enjoys teaching at the
University. He describes his graduate
students as "sharp," and his under
graduates as "enthusiastic."
His courses are not required, "so I can

make them hard," he says. "Those who
survive like the class," and Knuth gives
them credit. "I try to teach technical writing
in my classes. I guess I'm trying to be sort
of a scientific Strunk and White.
Scott Drysdale, graduate student in
computer science, thinks very highly of
Knuth. "I've TA'd for him. He's brilliant,
and well-liked by most students and pro
fessors. He's fun to talk to .. . not one to
talk all business."
Dick Karp, also a computer science
graduate student, agrees. "Knuth is very
eminent in his field. He understands ev
erything. I think he runs the department, or
influences it a great deal."
Budgets time
Karp admires Knuth's ability to budget
time. "Half the Computer Science Depart
ment wants to see him, yet he takes one
day off a week."
Knuth explains that his "day off" policy
is the result of an ulcer a few years back.
He says he worked too hard, and was
forced to change his lifestyle as a con
sequence. He claimed his personal dead
lines wore him down, and his family life
was suffering. Now he has time to do such

things as take art classes with his wife
(who illustrated Surreal Numbers).
His hard work did not go unnoticed. He
was the first winner of the Grace M. Hop
per Award for distinguished achieve
ments in computer science. Two years
ago he was awarded the Turing Award,
the highest honor of the Association for
Computing Machinery. Last year he was
elected to the National Academy of Sci
ences. and is one of their youngest mem
bers.

influences it a great deal."
Budgets time
Karp admires Knuth's ability to budget
time. "Half the Computer Science Depart
ment wants to see him, yet he takes one
day off a week."
Knuth explains that his "day off" policy
is the result of an ulcer a few years back.
He says he worked too hard, and was
forced to change his lifestyle as a con
sequence. He claimed his personal dead
lines wore him down, and his family life
was suffering. Now he has time to do such

things as take art classes with his wife
(who illustrated Surreal Numbers).
His hard work did not go unnoticed. He
was the first winner of the Grace M. Hop
per Award for distinguished achieve
ments in computer science. Two years
ago he was awarded the Turing Award,
the highest honor of the Association for
Computing Machinery. Last year he was
elected to the National Academy of Sci
ences. and is one of their youngest mem
bers.
Knuth enjoys using the computer for
personal pleasure. He delights in analyz
ing the plots of Agatha Christie's books,
as well as Earle Stanley Gardner's Perry
Mason mysteries. He has almost a com
plete collection of both authors.
Knuth seems to enjoy the Stanford
community. His family enjoys having stu
dents come to the house to practice on the
organ. "These students provide wonder
ful concerts for us and the children," says
Knuth. His work, he says, is "still exciting
for me.
"I guess I've just been riding the crest of
a lot of waves."


PROGRAMMING AWAY — Donald Knuth is an avid and expert organist, and he is
shown sitting here playing the $35,000 organ in his home. When he's not playing
the organ, Knuth is a computer science professor here.
Donald Knuth, a computer science pro
fessor here, has a list of honors and
awards that rival the Housing Draw Book
let in length, yet his first mathematical
work was published in MAD magazine.
The incident illustrates his form of
humor. Knuth quietly smiles when he re
lates that the printout is still English in a
Romanian translation of a volume of his
computer instructions.
But there is a serious side to him too.
When he is not working on his seven
volume work, The Art of Computer
Programming, he can be found at his
home designed for his two-story $35,000
pipe organ, writing the Library of Con
gress for information on a rare piece of
music.
The organ is Knuth's pride and joy. He
is a member of the American Guild of Or
ganists, and is an associate organist at
Bethany Lutheran Church in Menlo Park.
Standing like a sentinel at the front part
of his house, the 11-month old organ has
been described by Knuth as "the most
successful home organ I've ever played. "
His professional academic career has
taken him to conferences all over the
world, and he always manages to find and
play an organ wherever he is.
Grand piano
He also enjoys his Boesendorfer grand
piano. He often plays duets, with his wife
accompanying on the alternate instru
ment. The piano has an unbelievable
ebony finish. When asked how he pro
tected it against his children, he replied,
"The hardest part is dog-proofing, not
kids."
The musical instruments are not the
only impressive features in the house he
and his wife, Jill, designed. His kitchen is
centered around the garbage receptacle,
when the mathematical model he de
signed told him that "everything in the
kitchen wanted to be next to it."
The floor in the family room is a compo
site of over 150 aerial maps of the San
Francisco Bay Area. One of the walls in
the same room is designed to be written
on (with a special erasable ink). Knuth

holds monthly seminars in this room.
Upstairs in the house is where his two
children, John, 10, and Jennifer, 9, sleep.
Across the stairs from the children's bed
room is his study. Portraits of dozens of
mathematicians decorate the walls. The
balding and bespectacled 38-year-old
Knuth does much of his work there.
On one desk is a terminal that can be
connected to computers at Harvard and
the University of Southern California as
well as Stanford. In the anteroom is a
steamer trunk of material for the fourth
volume of The Art of Computer
Programming.
An art
"The volumes are to summarize every
thing known about computer program
ming. I consider programming as much of
an art as writing," says Knuth. He wrote a
novel while in Norway on sabbatical. It is
about mathematics, but has a plot. Enti
tled Surreal Numbers, the book was
completed in less than a week.
"The idea of the book is anti-text, to
learn how people do research, and see
their mistakes," says Knuth. He notes with
pride that the book, the first of its kind, was
well received.
Computers have been a part of Knuth's
life since the late 19505. While an under
graduate at Case Institute of Technology
(now Case Western Reserve University),
he designed a program on basketball
statistics gathering, and was interviewed
by Walter Cronkite. The program ranked
each player by how much he contributed
overall. For example, a piayer would not
be awarded two points for a basket, as the
ball was turned over to the other team.
Knuth went on to graduate first in his
class, with a B.S. and M.S. in mathema
tics. He received his Ph.D. in mathematics
at Caltech, and stayed there to teach until
1968, when he accepted a professorship
here.
Enjoys teaching
Knuth says he enjoys teaching at the
University. He describes his graduate
students as "sharp," and his under
graduates as "enthusiastic."
His courses are not required, "so I can

make them hard," he says. "Those who
survive like the class," and Knuth gives
them credit. "I try to teach technical writing
in my classes. I guess I'm trying to be sort
of a scientific Strunk and White.
Scott Drysdale, graduate student in
computer science, thinks very highly of
Knuth. "I've TA'd for him. He's brilliant,
and well-liked by most students and pro
fessors. He's fun to talk to .. . not one to
talk all business."
Dick Karp, also a computer science
graduate student, agrees. "Knuth is very
eminent in his field. He understands ev
erything. I think he runs the department, or
influences it a great deal."
