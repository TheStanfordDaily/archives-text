# Civil defense supplies kept only for earthquakes

### Rod Stevens 
Civil defense supplies, a major
concern of the Cold War era, now
sit untended where they were
stacked 14 years ago.
Water, crackers and medicinal
supplies packaged in 1962 and
distributed under a national civil
defense plan remain stocked in
many of the University's base
ments and hallways.
According to Bruce Wiggins,
operations manager at plant ser
vices, no office or agency is
funded to maintain the supplies.
After national civil defense funds
ran out, responsibility for the
supplies was given to the Santa
Clara County Office of Emergency
Services.
However, the county also has
no funding for the upkeep of the
supplies, Wiggins said.
"We've checked with (county)
defense people and they are not

doing anything," he said.
The University has not moved
the supplies since they were first
placed in the shelters in 1962.
"If a leaking water container is
reported, it is disposed of," Wig
gins said, adding that the cost of
removing the supplies prohibits
further action.
"Right now they stay just in
case, the in case' being an ear
thquake," said Wiggins. He com
mented, however, that the proba
bility of a natural disaster or build
ing failure is "extremely slight."
The other possible incident which
might bring the supplies into use is
a break in either Lagunita or
Searsville Lakes, he said.
Most University buildings were
built to strict standards in a day
when few building codes existed,
said Wiggins. For this reason,
many basements across campus

are certified as shelters and con
tain supplies.
A check in the basements of the
political science building (old law
school) and Hoover Tower re
vealed extensive supplies of wa
ter, "all-purpose survival cracker,"
first aid kits and "Sk IV sanitary
kits."
Most of the civil defense signs
which identified the shelters were
removed by students in the late
'60s, according to Wiggins.
A couple of years ago, the
Nicaraguan earthquake spurred
an international plea for aid to the
disaster stricken, Wiggins said.
Transportation would have been
provided free by the airlines, he
added. The University was willing
to donate the civil defense
supplies, but the local cost of re
moving them would have been too
great, he said.

JUST IN CASE — Cold war fears caused these emergency water
containers and other civil defense supplies to be placed on cam
pus in 1962. The supplies, such as those here in the basement of
the political science bulding, are now kept just "in case" of an
eartnquake.
