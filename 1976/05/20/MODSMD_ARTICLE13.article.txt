Running on a hard-line stance
regarding negotiation of fraternity
leases with the University, Delta
Tau Delta member Jordan
Schwartz was eiected president of
the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
yesterday.
"The main issue for next year is
the leases between the frater
nities and the University," he said.
"The University has quite a bit
of power but we're going to use
jur power to get things done," he
said.
Schwartz said he felt the lease
question, as well as other major
fraternity complaints, should be
worked out with the University
under binding arbitration.
A team representing the Uni
versity but not including adminis
trators. such as a group of profes
sors. would be best able to con
duct such arbitration, he said.
The possibility of fraternity sys
tem expansion will be the other

main area of concern for the IFC
next year. Schwartz said.
One way only
"The University's mechanisms
are set up in one direction only,"
he said. "Fraternities can go (into
the University system) but no new
ones can come in.
"I'd like to see a new house
come in through draw. This can be
done. I believe."
Schwartz also said he will
explore the possibility of a frater
nity system food cooperative. Say
ing that fraternity co-ops have
been successful at other univer
sities, Schwartz claimed that
"food can be bought cheaper than
at the (University) commissary."
He admitted that a co-op would
be "difficult to set up ' but said he
felt it could be done.
Schwartz called the Big Game
Bonfire "a minor issue," adding
that he feels other Big Game
events should be considered.
"Some sort of alternative activ
ity that would enable all the

(fraternity) houses to participate
would be preferable, he said.
Other ideas
Other possible innovations
which Schwartz said he will back
next year include "get to know the
freshmen' fraternity social events
in the fall and a fraternity newslet
ter which would be funded by the
ASSU Publications Board. The fall
social events would stress inter
fraternity 'cooperation, not com
petition. Schwartz said.
Schwartz was one of two IFC
members to defend at length
former IFC President Bob Ottilie
two weeks ago when members of
the Theta Xi fraternity attempted
to pass a motion calling for Ot
tilies resignation.
Ottilie said he was "very
pleased'' with the IFC s choice of
officers.
Delta Upsilon President Tom
Gordon was elected vice presi
dent of the IFC. Theta Delta Chi
member Bobby Fisher was
elected treasurer.

said.
Schwartz said he felt the lease
question, as well as other major
fraternity complaints, should be
worked out with the University
under binding arbitration.
A team representing the Uni
versity but not including adminis
trators. such as a group of profes
sors. would be best able to con
duct such arbitration, he said.
The possibility of fraternity sys
tem expansion will be the other

main area of concern for the IFC
next year. Schwartz said.
One way only
"The University's mechanisms
are set up in one direction only,"
he said. "Fraternities can go (into
the University system) but no new
ones can come in.
"I'd like to see a new house
come in through draw. This can be
done. I believe."
Schwartz also said he will
explore the possibility of a frater
nity system food cooperative. Say
ing that fraternity co-ops have
been successful at other univer
sities, Schwartz claimed that
"food can be bought cheaper than
at the (University) commissary."
He admitted that a co-op would
be "difficult to set up ' but said he
felt it could be done.
Schwartz called the Big Game
Bonfire "a minor issue," adding
that he feels other Big Game
events should be considered.
"Some sort of alternative activ
ity that would enable all the

(fraternity) houses to participate
would be preferable, he said.
Other ideas
Other possible innovations
which Schwartz said he will back
next year include "get to know the
freshmen' fraternity social events
in the fall and a fraternity newslet
ter which would be funded by the
ASSU Publications Board. The fall
social events would stress inter
fraternity 'cooperation, not com
petition. Schwartz said.
Schwartz was one of two IFC
members to defend at length
former IFC President Bob Ottilie
two weeks ago when members of
the Theta Xi fraternity attempted
to pass a motion calling for Ot
tilies resignation.
Ottilie said he was "very
pleased'' with the IFC s choice of
officers.
Delta Upsilon President Tom
Gordon was elected vice presi
dent of the IFC. Theta Delta Chi
member Bobby Fisher was
elected treasurer.
