# 'Old boy' tenure system attacked in court
## Sex discrimination charged 
### 
PITTSBURGH (PNS) — The
federal district court here is weigh
ing the merits of a sex discrimina
tion suit that, if successful, could
mean a drastic reorganization of
the academic tenure procedure as
practiced in almost every college
and university in the nation.
At issue is the contention of
Sharon Johnson, assistant pro
fessor of biochemistry at the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh Medical
School, that her denial of tenure
three years ago was the result of
sex discrimination, disguised as
abstract value judgments relating
to teaching and research.
Johnson's attorney, Sylvia
Roberts of the National Organiza
tion for Women (NOW) Legal and
Educational Defense Fund, con
tends her client fell victim to an "old
boy'' system that freezes out
women and minorities from
longterm job security in academia.

Johnson's detractors, including
the deans and chairmen who
wield power over her future, insist
she was denied tenure strictly on
the basis of failure to meet scho
larly and research criteria.
Johnson's suit, filed under the
First and Fourteenth Amend
ments and the 1964 Civil Rights
Act, Title VII, asks for tenure, back
pay and $1.5 million in damages.
Attorney Roberts believes that if
it is successful it will set a prece
dent that could "open the flood
gates" for women into the higher
ranks of academia by forcing the
predominantly male deans and
faculties who judge tenure candi
dates to objectify what are now
abstract standards.
Measure productivity
For example. Roberts will at
tempt to measure individual re
search productivity by the number
and dollar amount of grants re

ceived. She has also developed a
complex system to measure the
number of positive citations of
Johnson's work by her col
leagues. Finally, student evalua
tions have been used to measure
teaching ability.
To date, courts have shied
away from reversing academic
decisions on tenure for fear of in
terfering with academic freedom,
a closely guarded privilege
Roberts believes has been used
to cover up violations of civil
rights.
The Johnson case has already
scored one legal first. In June
1973, when Johnson's contract
ended, U.S. District Judge William
Knox granted a preliminary injunc
tion that forced the university to
keep her on the job until litigation
is completed.
Since the suit was filed
Johnson's costs have exceeded

$50,000, much of which was
raised through the NOW fund.
NOW estimates that the university
has spent over $1 million, includ
ing fees to the two most prestigi
ous law firms in the city.
Women lower
Roberts cites a string of statis
tics to bolster her contention that
women are stuck on the lower
hinges of the academic ladder.
The U.S. Office of Education
has found that 60 percent of male
faculty have tenure as opposed to
only 42 percent of women.
While women made up 24 per
cent of all full-time faculty in this
country, they constitute only 10
percent of the full professors, 17
percent of the associate profes
sors, and 40 percent of the lower
echelon instructors and lecturers.
Johnson believes these figures
result from prejudices built into the
subjective criteria for tenure —
concepts such as "scholarship"
and "esteem."
At most schools, tenure can be
awarded after a six-year trial
period. The senior faculty of the
department — most often domi
nated by white males — meets
and votes on a candidate on
criteria that can change radically
from one department to another,
or even from one candidate to
another.
Criteria shift
In many cases, such as
Johnson's, whatever vague stan
dards are established when a per
son is hired may shift at some
point because the department de

cides to take a new direction. So
six years later, a person may be
denied tenure on the basis of fac
tors he or she could never have
anticipated.
Roberts believes that subjec
tive elements can be eradicated
"by voting on merit, on scholarly
achievements, on ability to teach.
You can measure these things,"
she claims.
Criteria shift
Without such measures — as
Johnson's own record attests —
criteria have strong tendencies to
shift.
When Johnson was hired at the
University of Pittsburgh in 1967
her department chairman told her
that "a few publications" and elec
tion to the American Society for
Biological Chemists would satisfy
tenure requirements.
Between 1967 and 1972 she
was awarded four grants from the
National Institutes for Health and
the National Science Foundation,
totaling $256,000. She published
seven articles and one review and
was elected to the society.
But that chairman left in 1971. In
a meeting soon after, the new
chairman confirmed that the fa
culty had decided not to grant her
tenure.
"Your teaching is a problem,"
he told her, adding that the faculty
deemed her research "irrelevant
to the goals of the department."
"The real problem," says
Johnson, "is that if you don't get
tenure, you'll probably never get a
job again."

Educational Defense Fund, con
tends her client fell victim to an "old
boy'' system that freezes out
women and minorities from
longterm job security in academia.

Johnson's detractors, including
the deans and chairmen who
wield power over her future, insist
she was denied tenure strictly on
the basis of failure to meet scho
larly and research criteria.
Johnson's suit, filed under the
First and Fourteenth Amend
ments and the 1964 Civil Rights
Act, Title VII, asks for tenure, back
pay and $1.5 million in damages.
Attorney Roberts believes that if
it is successful it will set a prece
dent that could "open the flood
gates" for women into the higher
ranks of academia by forcing the
predominantly male deans and
faculties who judge tenure candi
dates to objectify what are now
abstract standards.
Measure productivity
For example. Roberts will at
tempt to measure individual re
search productivity by the number
and dollar amount of grants re

ceived. She has also developed a
complex system to measure the
number of positive citations of
Johnson's work by her col
leagues. Finally, student evalua
tions have been used to measure
teaching ability.
To date, courts have shied
away from reversing academic
decisions on tenure for fear of in
terfering with academic freedom,
a closely guarded privilege
Roberts believes has been used
to cover up violations of civil
rights.
The Johnson case has already
scored one legal first. In June
1973, when Johnson's contract
ended, U.S. District Judge William
Knox granted a preliminary injunc
tion that forced the university to
keep her on the job until litigation
is completed.
Since the suit was filed
Johnson's costs have exceeded

$50,000, much of which was
raised through the NOW fund.
NOW estimates that the university
has spent over $1 million, includ
ing fees to the two most prestigi
ous law firms in the city.
Women lower
Roberts cites a string of statis
tics to bolster her contention that
women are stuck on the lower
hinges of the academic ladder.
The U.S. Office of Education
has found that 60 percent of male
faculty have tenure as opposed to
only 42 percent of women.
While women made up 24 per
cent of all full-time faculty in this
country, they constitute only 10
percent of the full professors, 17
percent of the associate profes
sors, and 40 percent of the lower
echelon instructors and lecturers.
Johnson believes these figures
result from prejudices built into the
subjective criteria for tenure —
concepts such as "scholarship"
and "esteem."
At most schools, tenure can be
awarded after a six-year trial
period. The senior faculty of the
department — most often domi
nated by white males — meets
and votes on a candidate on
criteria that can change radically
from one department to another,
or even from one candidate to
another.
Criteria shift
In many cases, such as
Johnson's, whatever vague stan
dards are established when a per
son is hired may shift at some
point because the department de

cides to take a new direction. So
six years later, a person may be
denied tenure on the basis of fac
tors he or she could never have
anticipated.
Roberts believes that subjec
tive elements can be eradicated
"by voting on merit, on scholarly
achievements, on ability to teach.
You can measure these things,"
she claims.
Criteria shift
Without such measures — as
Johnson's own record attests —
criteria have strong tendencies to
shift.
When Johnson was hired at the
University of Pittsburgh in 1967
her department chairman told her
that "a few publications" and elec
tion to the American Society for
Biological Chemists would satisfy
tenure requirements.
Between 1967 and 1972 she
was awarded four grants from the
National Institutes for Health and
the National Science Foundation,
totaling $256,000. She published
seven articles and one review and
was elected to the society.
But that chairman left in 1971. In
a meeting soon after, the new
chairman confirmed that the fa
culty had decided not to grant her
tenure.
"Your teaching is a problem,"
he told her, adding that the faculty
deemed her research "irrelevant
to the goals of the department."
"The real problem," says
Johnson, "is that if you don't get
tenure, you'll probably never get a
job again."
PITTSBURGH (PNS) — The
federal district court here is weigh
ing the merits of a sex discrimina

At issue is the contention of

three years ago was the result of
sex discrimination, disguised as
abstract value judgments relating
to teaching and research.

gates" for women into the higher
ranks of academia by forcing the
predominantly male deans and
faculties who judge tenure candi
dates to objectify what are now
abstract standards.
Measure productivity
For example. Roberts will at
tempt to measure individual re
search productivity by the number
and dollar amount of grants re

ceived. She has also developed a
complex system to measure the
number of positive citations of
Johnson's work by her col
leagues. Finally, student evalua
tions have been used to measure
teaching ability.
To date, courts have shied
away from reversing academic
decisions on tenure for fear of in
terfering with academic freedom,
a closely guarded privilege
Roberts believes has been used
to cover up violations of civil
rights.
The Johnson case has already
scored one legal first. In June
1973, when Johnson's contract
ended, U.S. District Judge William
Knox granted a preliminary injunc
tion that forced the university to
keep her on the job until litigation
is completed.
Since the suit was filed
Johnson's costs have exceeded

$50,000, much of which was
raised through the NOW fund.
NOW estimates that the university
has spent over $1 million, includ
ing fees to the two most prestigi
ous law firms in the city.
Women lower
Roberts cites a string of statis
tics to bolster her contention that
women are stuck on the lower
hinges of the academic ladder.
The U.S. Office of Education
has found that 60 percent of male
faculty have tenure as opposed to
only 42 percent of women.
While women made up 24 per
cent of all full-time faculty in this
country, they constitute only 10
percent of the full professors, 17
percent of the associate profes
sors, and 40 percent of the lower
echelon instructors and lecturers.
Johnson believes these figures
result from prejudices built into the
subjective criteria for tenure —
concepts such as "scholarship"
and "esteem."
At most schools, tenure can be
awarded after a six-year trial
period. The senior faculty of the
department — most often domi
nated by white males — meets
and votes on a candidate on
criteria that can change radically
from one department to another,
or even from one candidate to
another.
Criteria shift
In many cases, such as
Johnson's, whatever vague stan
dards are established when a per
son is hired may shift at some
point because the department de

cides to take a new direction. So
six years later, a person may be
denied tenure on the basis of fac
tors he or she could never have
anticipated.
Roberts believes that subjec
tive elements can be eradicated
"by voting on merit, on scholarly
achievements, on ability to teach.
You can measure these things,"
she claims.
Criteria shift
Without such measures — as
Johnson's own record attests —
criteria have strong tendencies to
shift.
When Johnson was hired at the
University of Pittsburgh in 1967
her department chairman told her
that "a few publications" and elec
tion to the American Society for
Biological Chemists would satisfy
tenure requirements.
Between 1967 and 1972 she
was awarded four grants from the
National Institutes for Health and
the National Science Foundation,
totaling $256,000. She published
seven articles and one review and
was elected to the society.
But that chairman left in 1971. In
a meeting soon after, the new
chairman confirmed that the fa
culty had decided not to grant her
tenure.
"Your teaching is a problem,"
he told her, adding that the faculty
deemed her research "irrelevant
to the goals of the department."
"The real problem," says
Johnson, "is that if you don't get
tenure, you'll probably never get a
job again."
