# Lopez papers added to chicano collection
## 
### Rachel Moran 
Ignacio Lopez: it's a name you
may never have heard from a his
tory that's largely unwritten â€” the
history of the chicano community
in the United States.
Several collections housed in
the Bender Room of Stanford's
Main Library may help put
chicano history on the books.
The latest addition, the Lopez
collection, is the most complete
set of copies in existence of the
longest running chicano news
paper established in the United
States.
The newspaper. El Espec
tador, was founded and edited by
Ignacio Lopez. Published from
1932 to 1960, the newspaper pro
vides one of the few uninterrupted
chronicles of chicano activities in
California during this period.
Reception held
At a reception on May 3 held to
honor Lopez, David Weber,
director of Stanford libraries, de
clared that "this collection is an
extraordinary acquisition, and it
will be the keystone of our collec

tion of California farm labor and
chicano studies."
Ysidro Ortiz, a research assis
tant who investigated various
methods of indexing El Espec
tador for research purposes,
noted that the collection "has so
few gaps that it is immensely val
uable as a research tool. Nothing
else does it. It is the continuing
story of a community."
According to Florian Shasky,
head of special collections, ac
cess to the collection "will not be
restricted to Stanford faculty and
students but will be available to all
qualified researchers who come
to Stanford."
Shasky says he believes the
collection will be "vital to the de
velopment of historical studies."
Donated collection
Leonor Lopez, widow of the late
Ignacio Lopez, decided to donate
the collection to Stanford because
"he (Lopez) thought of retiring
from government life and coming
to teach at Stanford.
"Since he died before fulfilling
this dream, i think his newspaper

can teach what he would have
taught."
Unfortunately, none of Mr.
Lopez' personal communications
are included in the collection.
Asked why she had not donated
them, Mrs. Lopez replied, "I don't
know I could have made copies,
but it's still a lot of consolation to
me to read them, to have them
myself. Possibly, in the future, I
will donate them as well but not
now. I can't give them up yet."
The absence of his personal
communications is particularly
disappointing because Mr. Lopez
played a central role in the
chicano community.
Born in 1908, Ignacio Lopez

graduated from the University of
California at Berkeley with de
grees in Spanish and history.
After graduation, he returned to
the Pomona Valley where he es
tablished El Espectador.
According to Mrs. Lopez, her
husband viewed the newspaper
as "the only way to communicate
among our people."
Burt Corona, a long-time friend
and close associate of Mrs.
Lopez, believed that for Lopez, El
Espectador was "an arm of the
struggle"' and "an organ or orien
tation, of inspiration, of informa
tion, and also a means of infusing
spirit... so that our people would
begin to fight more intensely for

their rights."
In addition, Lopez' paper fought
discrimination and segregation in
southern California. Corona says
Lopez was in the forefront of at
tempts "to eliminate segregation
in the schools, swimming pools,
and public parks."
Liberty Leagues
During World War 11, Lopez
worked for the government, or
ganizing Liberty Leagues to gain
support from European minorities
for the war effort.
After the war, he utilized the
techniques he had learned to or
ganize Unity Leagues, one of the
first attempts at a chicano grass
