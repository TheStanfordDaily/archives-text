# French 110 is for intellectuals
## 
### 
French 110 won't be just
another French class. In fact, one
might call it a philosophy, litera
ture, linguistics, anthropology
class.
To be off6red next fall at 1:15,
Contemporary French Thought
and Literature came about "Be
cause we had to do it," according
to its mentor, French Prof.
Robert Cohn.
The course, taught in English,
will present the major French intel
lectual movement of the last 25

years, structuralism.
Structuralism views reality as
signs grouped into codes. The
movement was inspired by Saus
sure's linguistics and came to in
clude anthropology with the works
of Claude Levi-Strauss. The
course is designed to clarify this
difficult movement for the non
specialized student.
No knowledge of French is re
quired although some of the op
tional readings may be in French.
"France is such a center for in

tellectual activity," stated
Cohn. "Existentialism had
worldwide importance, and this
new movement is a dominant in
tellectual force."
He added, "The French De
partment is the likely place for a
course like this, and it's hiqh time
for it."
More than a dozen thinkers will
be featured in lectures by profes
sors and graduate students. The
professors include Alphonse Juil
land, Pauline Newman-Gordon,
Leo Weinstein, Raymond Giraud
and David Brostoff.
An hour each week will be de
voted to discussion by a panel and
students. "This should provide a
change of faces and tones, a little
variety,'' Cohn said.
"This is an important move
ment, and the academic commun
ity should be involved in it. The
course should be exciting," he
concluded.
