## Knowledge priests 
### 
Chuck Hirsch

It's been a few years now, since
I first entered the land of Leland
Stanford — the wondrous land of
wisdom and opportunity. In this
land, the High-Priests of Know
ledge are said to stand ready, wil
ling and anxious to pass some of
their knowledge and wisdom on to
those who seek the answers.
For two years I have been
searching for those answers, and
with each new quest I am met by
stronger obstacles. And just this
morning it finally hampened — I
was denied a request for informa
tion by one of the High-Priests.
It happened after my daily
ceremony in honor of Random
Sampling (God of Psychology).
I began to ask about something
he had said during the ceremony
when he asked, Did you read the
book?" I hadn't, but my queston
concerned what went on in the
ceremony.
I told him this, but all he said
was, Don't come to me unless
you've read the book!" Then, he
vanished out the side door.
Somehat stunned, I staggered
ouside. My mind fluctuated bet
ween feelings of guilt and animos
ity.
Was I an insurgent? Was the
High-Priest an asshole? I

couldn't decide.
Deep thinking always makes
me hungry, so I stopped then and
there, reached into my pocket for
some change, and found — no
thing!
Quickly. I reached for my wallet,
opened it.and again — nothing!
And suddenly, it all become clear
to me — the High-Priests had my
money.
It became clear to me that the
High-Priests didn't need me —
they didn't want me to ask for
knowledge. They had spent many
years of their short lives writing
and rewriting the Scriptures — if I
wanted knowledge, I could read
their books. Needless to say, I
was quite disillusioned with my en
lightenment.
But this is not to say that I have
given up my search for the
answers — I have not. I have not
given up, for I have met a number
of very fine High-Priests who have
been very good to me.
But not until more High-Priests
come down from their lofty
thrones and realize what the sig
nificant minority has realized will
the land of Leland Stanford be
come the land it's professed to be.
