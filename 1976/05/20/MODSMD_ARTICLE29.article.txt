# Senators say Israel must return Arab lands
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Four U.S. senators said yester
day that Israel must evacuate Israeli settlers from oc
cupied Arab territories and return the land to former own
ers if a lasting peace is to be achieved.
"In my way of thinking these new settlements are a
prescription for disaster," said Sen. Floyd K. Haskell (D-
Colo.).
"If you want things to blow up, just continue those set
tlements," he told the Senate Foreign Relations Commit
tee.
Haskell and Sens. Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.), and James
Abourezk (D-S.D.) recently returned from a trip to the
Middle East.
The four senators reported that key Arab leaders state
privately that they recognize and accept the right of Israel
to exist as an independent nation.
But they said they are gravely concerned over the pos

sibility that Israeli settlements in the occupied lands is a
sign Israel is seeking expanded permanent borders.
Javits, a long time supporter of Israel, said the new
settlements cannot be permitted to effect the ultimate out
come of a negotiated peace.
"In these new settlements the Israelis are strictly on their
own," Javits said.
Stevenson asked: "How much sense does it make to
establish these new borders with a large, aggrieved, hos
tile minority inside like a Trojan horse?"
Abourezk, who is of Lebanese descent, predicted that
Israel eventually will attempt to expel large numbers of
Arab nationals from the occupied West Bank area "to
make the local population more manageable."
Sen. Charles Percy (R-lll.), a member of the committee,
said, "those who tell Israel they can have large chunks of
occupied territories and peace at the same time are engag

ing in a cruel deception."
Haske! echoed other senators in saying that the Arab
leaders with whom he met were most anxious for a peace
ful solution.
"I got to Israel and I'm sorry to say I found a less
receptive attitude," Haskell said. "There was no receptivity
for anything except the status quo. And I find that depres
sing."
Javits endorsed the policy of a two-step plan for a peace
conference. The first step would involve meetings to estab
lish the agenda and ground rules. The second would con
sist of the actual negotiations.
"I agree thoroughly that it is still not too late, that there is
an opportunity right now that must not be passed up.
Javits said.
Stevenson emphasized that a settlement must be
based on simultaneous Arab-Israeli steps.
