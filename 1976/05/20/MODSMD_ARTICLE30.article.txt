# Local group comes home
## Doobie Bros. shine at Cow Palace 
### Daryl Thomas 
"You don't know how good it
feels, San Francisco!'' screamed
Pat Simmons to the thousands of
up-lifted matches honoring one of
the Bay Area's all time great rock
groups, the Doobie Brothers.
Takin' It To The Street is the
name of their new album and take
it they did last Friday night at the
Cow Palace. Making their first bay
appearance in a year, they quickly
got the audience going by joggling
the memory with a hit from their
first big album, Toulouse Street.
With the opening vocal har
mony of "Jesus Is Just Alright,''
they knew they were home. Mix
ing hits from each of their six al
bums including the new one, they
had the crowd clapping, dancing
and singing along. They per
formed such numbers as "Eyes Of
Silver," "Take Me In Your Arms,"
Music Man" and "Neal's Fan
dango showing their old rocking
style.
Solos
These songs featured the three
guitarists. Tom Johnston, Sim
mons and Ted "Skunk" Baxter,
alternating lead solos. To em
phasize both a change in style and
in the direction of the show an ex
tended version of "I Cheat the
Hangman'' was played.
It was supplemented by some
fantastic light work including a re
volving mirror ball and strobing ef
fects. The highlights were the
guitar work of Simmons and Bax
ter and the amazingly in tune
vocal harmony, given the volume
of the music.
While Baxter continued to hold
the audience's attention with
some fancy acoustical work, the
Memphis Horns, a group from
Memphis who played on the
Doobies latest album, turned up.
When everyone on stage was
ready, Mike McDonald, the
newest member of the group,
launched the show into orbit.
Jazz
Playing "Turn It Loose" and
"Takin' It To The Street" off the
new album, sandwiched around

"Listen To The Music," they fea
tured McDonald on keyboards in a
ja2z-influenced style. The crowd
accepted the new stuff but a low
buzz was circulating demanding
to be fulfilled.
As if on cue, Simmons started a
lazy sounding series of chords.
Everybody knew it was time for
some funky dixieland as "Black
Water" filled the arena. The
showstopper occurred halfway
through this tune as the Horns got
into some good old New Orleans
style jazz. Coupled with
McDonald's piano, this number
got most of the house up on their
feet.
Trying to think of an encore
wasn't hard as two of their biggest
hits had not yet been played. They
started with a cut off the Memphis
Horns new release called Keep
On Doing It, which got Simmons,
Baxter, Johnston, and Ti Porter
(the bassist) doing some strutting
across the stage. Johnston took

over and led the wildly yelling
crowd to "China Grove" by way of
"Long Train Running." The
Doobies had come home.
Hungry
Opening. the show for the
Doobie Brothers is no easy task
any time and playing before them
on a night when the crowd was
hungry could have meant disaster
to many a group. Not, however, for
Pablo Cruise.
The latest in a long line of Bay
Area success stories, they came
ready to play. Mixing songs from
their two albums they won the
crowd over. As a thank you they
played 30 minutes of their big hit,
"Ocean Breeze." They showed
that they intend to be around for
a while.
In final appreciation for the ex
cellent reception given both
groups, they both came on stage
at the end and, tossing carnations
to the crowd, did a chorus line
bow.

ROCK—Master guitarist Roy Buchanan wil headline two upcom
ing shows next week. Next Saturday, May 29, he will appear at
the Berkeley Community Theater. Buchanan will be at the San
Jose Center for the Performing Arts on Sunday, May 30. Firefall
wil open both shows.
"You don't know how good it
feels, San Francisco!'' screamed
Pat Simmons to the thousands of
up-lifted matches honoring one of
the Bay Area's all time great rock
groups, the Doobie Brothers.
Takin' It To The Street is the
name of their new album and take
it they did last Friday night at the
Cow Palace. Making their first bay
appearance in a year, they quickly
got the audience going by joggling
the memory with a hit from their
first big album, Toulouse Street.
With the opening vocal har
mony of "Jesus Is Just Alright,''
they knew they were home. Mix
ing hits from each of their six al
bums including the new one, they
had the crowd clapping, dancing
and singing along. They per
formed such numbers as "Eyes Of
Silver," "Take Me In Your Arms,"
Music Man" and "Neal's Fan
dango showing their old rocking
style.
Solos
These songs featured the three
guitarists. Tom Johnston, Sim
mons and Ted "Skunk" Baxter,
alternating lead solos. To em
phasize both a change in style and
in the direction of the show an ex
tended version of "I Cheat the
Hangman'' was played.
It was supplemented by some
fantastic light work including a re
volving mirror ball and strobing ef
fects. The highlights were the
guitar work of Simmons and Bax
ter and the amazingly in tune
vocal harmony, given the volume
of the music.
While Baxter continued to hold
the audience's attention with
some fancy acoustical work, the
Memphis Horns, a group from
Memphis who played on the
Doobies latest album, turned up.
When everyone on stage was
ready, Mike McDonald, the
newest member of the group,
launched the show into orbit.
Jazz
Playing "Turn It Loose" and
"Takin' It To The Street" off the
new album, sandwiched around

"Listen To The Music," they fea
tured McDonald on keyboards in a
ja2z-influenced style. The crowd
accepted the new stuff but a low
buzz was circulating demanding
to be fulfilled.
As if on cue, Simmons started a
lazy sounding series of chords.
Everybody knew it was time for
some funky dixieland as "Black
Water" filled the arena. The
showstopper occurred halfway
through this tune as the Horns got
into some good old New Orleans
style jazz. Coupled with
McDonald's piano, this number
got most of the house up on their
feet.
Trying to think of an encore
wasn't hard as two of their biggest
hits had not yet been played. They
started with a cut off the Memphis
Horns new release called Keep
On Doing It, which got Simmons,
Baxter, Johnston, and Ti Porter
(the bassist) doing some strutting
across the stage. Johnston took

over and led the wildly yelling
crowd to "China Grove" by way of
"Long Train Running." The
Doobies had come home.
Hungry
Opening. the show for the
Doobie Brothers is no easy task
any time and playing before them
on a night when the crowd was
hungry could have meant disaster
to many a group. Not, however, for
Pablo Cruise.
The latest in a long line of Bay
Area success stories, they came
ready to play. Mixing songs from
their two albums they won the
crowd over. As a thank you they
played 30 minutes of their big hit,
"Ocean Breeze." They showed
that they intend to be around for
a while.
In final appreciation for the ex
cellent reception given both
groups, they both came on stage
at the end and, tossing carnations
to the crowd, did a chorus line
bow.
