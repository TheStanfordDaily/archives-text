# ROCK
## Bad Company dull in concert 
### Sally Young 
As the opening act at Winter
land Friday, Dr. Feelgood per
formed a set of nostalgic rock
harking back to the early '60s.
Looking like they stepped out of
the album cover of Beatles '66, Dr.
Feelgood played their simplistic
numbers at a deafening volume,
though amplification failed to
screen the boring minimalism of
their repertoire, frozen as it were
in the basic blues-rock riffs of a
decade ago.
In order to clarify their an
achronistic act, the band mem
bers appeared in peg-legged suits
and classic Beatle bobs, but their
choreography was comically un
ique. Stomping across the stage
like automatons, Dr. Feelgood
looked like a rock group in cartoon
caricature on the Jetsons. The
most that can be said for their per
formance, indicative of the
mediocre one to follow, is that it
made Bad Company's disappoint
ing set seem tolerable.
Outstanding
Paul Rogers' versatile voice is
the outstanding element of a
rather limited band whose music
has atrophied in each successive
record. The searing guitar licks on
Bad Company's debut album are
sorely absent from their current
work, whose lyrics, which were
never scintillating to start with,
have become embarrassingly
banal.

It is the strength of Rogers ex
pressive, resourceful voice — a
dynamo held in sonorous check
— that holds his group together.
Unfortunately, Bad Company's
unimaginative playing in concert
received no help from the lead
singer, whose notes were re
ndered a thundering buzz by the
poor acoustics.
In performance, Bad Com
pany's energetic instrumentals
came across as blare; different
guitar parts were obscured and
their driving beat became tedious.
The group's slower numbers,
which usually spotlight Rogers'
dramatic crooning, failed to revive
their set because a ballad without
discernible lyrics might more aptly
be called a dirge.
Telecast
If it weren't for the simultaneous
telecast being projected above
the stage, one might have dozed
off in response to an exhaustingly
unpolished doubleheader of blast
sans filler. To the media child, nur
tured on TV and movies, the en
larged image is always more in
teresting than its physical corre
late.
If only the same were true for
music, the amplitude of both
bands might have saved their
modestly musical acts. Still, Bad
Company is a new band and
shouldn't yet be given up for dead.
Dr. Feelgood, however, belongs
on the mortuary list for Liverpool,
1966.

choreography was comically un
ique. Stomping across the stage
like automatons, Dr. Feelgood
looked like a rock group in cartoon
caricature on the Jetsons. The
most that can be said for their per
formance, indicative of the
mediocre one to follow, is that it
made Bad Company's disappoint
ing set seem tolerable.
Outstanding
Paul Rogers' versatile voice is
the outstanding element of a
rather limited band whose music
has atrophied in each successive
record. The searing guitar licks on
Bad Company's debut album are
sorely absent from their current
work, whose lyrics, which were
never scintillating to start with,
have become embarrassingly
banal.

It is the strength of Rogers ex
pressive, resourceful voice — a
dynamo held in sonorous check
— that holds his group together.
Unfortunately, Bad Company's
unimaginative playing in concert
received no help from the lead
singer, whose notes were re
ndered a thundering buzz by the
poor acoustics.
In performance, Bad Com
pany's energetic instrumentals
came across as blare; different
guitar parts were obscured and
their driving beat became tedious.
The group's slower numbers,
which usually spotlight Rogers'
dramatic crooning, failed to revive
their set because a ballad without
discernible lyrics might more aptly
be called a dirge.
Telecast
If it weren't for the simultaneous
telecast being projected above
the stage, one might have dozed
off in response to an exhaustingly
unpolished doubleheader of blast
sans filler. To the media child, nur
tured on TV and movies, the en
larged image is always more in
teresting than its physical corre
late.
If only the same were true for
music, the amplitude of both
bands might have saved their
modestly musical acts. Still, Bad
Company is a new band and
shouldn't yet be given up for dead.
Dr. Feelgood, however, belongs
on the mortuary list for Liverpool,
1966.
