## From Stanford's collection Historic photographs exhibited on campus 
### Angela Miller 
The interest in historic photo
graphy and in the major develop
ments in the art since its begin
nings in the 1940s has grown
rapidly in the last decade. This in
terest has prompted the growth of
private collections and encour
aged major acquisition by univer
sity and public museums.
Contemporary photographers
have gained much from this ac
celerating interest in their art and
the consequent recognition by the
public of the debt which contem
porary photography owes to its
own past.
Both historic and contemporary
photographs are represented
within the expanding collection of
photographs now in the posses
sion of the Stanford Museum.
The collection in fact predates
the foundation of the University. In
1878-79, Leland Stanford com
missioned the English photo
grapher Eadweard Muybridge to
do a fast sequence series of
photographs of galloping horses
in an attempt to prove that all four
feet were off the ground at a given
moment.
Innovation
Muybridge's photographic
analysis of motion in terms of still
shots prepared the way for the in
novation of motion picture
technique not long afterward. It is
therefore fitting that the "revival '
of interest in photography, since
Leland Stanford's first involve
ment with the art. was ushered in
by an exhibition, organized by
Anita Mozley in the winter of 1972,
on Muyridge, featuring the work
he completed for Stanford.
Mozley, since appointed
curator of photography, has sub
sequently organizned another
show of national importance on
the work of Julia Margaret Came
ron. Her acquisitions constitute a
substantial portion of the existing
collection, which hitherto included
important works by Weston and

Stieglitz.
Selections from the collection
are now on show in the Miedel
Room of the museum. The show
is organized in terms of subject,
each section chronologically or
dered. Such an arrangement
gives a sense both of the con
tinuity and the innovations within
the defined boundaries of subject.
The portraiture of the show
reaches from the posed but whim

sical works of Robert Adamson
and David Octavius Hill of Edin
burgh, to the modern grotes
queries of Diane Arbus. A small
gallery of well-known 19th century
French painters is hung beside
the hypnotic portrait of Charles
Baudelaire, their critic and defen
der.
Three Bay Area photographers
are included in this section: Im
ogen Cunningham, Leo Holub

and Margo Davis. Davis portrait
of a seated gentleman, taken from
her recently published book on the
West Indies, Antigua Black
combines technical polish and a

sympathy and familiarity with her
subject.
Intimate
A second portion of the show is
taken up with city and
townscapes, traveling from the
edges of civilization suggested by
the raw mining towns of the West,
to the most cultivated and intimate
scenes of Europe
The most impressive of the
grand scenes of 19th century
Europe is the American photo
grapher Alvin Cobum s vista of St
Paul s, seen through the industrial
smoke and grime of London
Coburn's treatment evokes the
sense of awe and unreality which
the 19th century observer must
have felt in the presence of a
rapidly changing cityscape
A series of mammoth plate
views of Yosemite done by Muy
bndge. Watkins and Jackson, indi
cate the early fascination with
Western landscape, an interest
earned on by Ansel Adams. Also
included is the work of Edward
Curtis, whose 20 volumes of
photographs record in an unpre
cedented way the life and charac
ter of the native American.
Subject and genre photographs
are primarily represented by
modern and contemporary works.
This section of the show shares
some of the concerns of modern
painting, from the abstraction and
revisualization of forms to the sur
realistic superimposition of ele
ments in new and disturbing ways.
This selection of works from the
collection is characteristic both of
the historical and international
scope and the quality of the
photographs owned by the
museum. The show ends on June
21.
