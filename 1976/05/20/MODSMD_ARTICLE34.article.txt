# 'Anything Goes'
## 
### 
The Otero and Rinconada
houses of Wilbur Hall will will pre
sent a bright musical production of
Noel Cowards Anything Goes,
tonight through Saturday evening,
with performances starting at 8:30
p.m. in the Otero-Rinconada din
ing hall.
The madcap musical adventure
features the exploits of two
couples intertwined in a shipboard
romance. Other action incudes a
bumbling gangster disguised as a
minister, and four fallen angels
working their way abroad.
Director Simon Sanchez, who
staged the Otero Music Hall pro
duction of Bye, Bye Birdie last fall,
has assembled large cast of sin
gers, dancers and actors, from
Wilbur Hall, as well as a 26-piece
live orchestra.
The show features a beautiful
bevy of tap dancers who turn the
production into a rollicking ocean
cruise. As is typical of Noel Cow
ard musicals, the tunes are
catchy, the lyrics witty, and the
humour as dry as a shipboard
martini.
