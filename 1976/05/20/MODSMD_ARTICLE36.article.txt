# Transsexual freaks in Transylvania
## Rocky Horror Show decadent, delightful THEATER 
### Mary Anderson 
The Rocky Horror Show,
riong the most provocative and
worthwhile entertainments to ap
pear in years, found an unfortu
nate home at San Francisco's
Montgomery Playhouse
At 622 Broadway, the
Montgomery lowers itself to the
demeanor of the entire North
Beach district. It displays muti
lated manikins and even
employs a barker to coax people
inside. Passersby might under
standably expect The Rocky Hor
ror Show to be a very seedy, S-M
kind of trip. It was not.
Ingeniously written by self
proclaimed "32-year-old juvenile
delinquent" Richard O'Brien, The
Rocky Horror Show combined
slightly obscene yet hilarious sex
ual escapades, the fun of early
rock n' roll, dancing to match,
some incredibly clever lyrics and
profound science fiction themes. It
is a transsexual science fiction
rock musical — and classier than
the Montgomery Playhouse.
The show was very profession
ally done (much more so than the
movie version, excepting Tim Cur
ry's performance as Frank). The
San Francisco production offers a
good band; the band, in fact, re
ceived a more enthusiastic ova
tion from the audience than the
cast, although the cast was quite
capable.
David James got into his role as
Frank N. Furter just fine and can
be very funny. His major difficulty,
unfortunately, was the inevitable
but almost impossible task of
competing with Curry, the lad
in the original touring cast as well
as in the movie.
The role of Frank N. Furter
seems to have been made for
Curry, who was uniquely equip
ped to play up every bit of Frank's
sensual absurdity. David James

admirably imitated Curry's per
formance as well as anyone.
Overplayed
Brad and Janet's naivete was a
bit overplayed by Robert

Reynolds and Needa Greene.
Bob Dulaney is acrobatically
competent as Rocky Horror. Ros
lyn Rosman as Trixie and
Magenta, Richard Gee as the Nar

rator and Buddy King as Riff Raff
also turn in able performances.
Emil Borelli's voice was perfect for
the parts of Eddie and Dr. Scott.
But the show's most sparkling
asset was Kelli Whitehead, new to
the show as the spunky Columbia.
The action of the play itself oc
curs during on adventurous night
in the lives of super-straight Brad
Majors and his virginal fiance.
Janet Weiss— the personificatons
of traditional societal mores.
When their car breaks down in the
middle of nowhere on an eerie,
stormy night (naturally), they find
themselves asking for help at Dr.
Frank N. Furter's hideaway.
He greets them in all his trans
vestite glory;
Don't get strung out by the way '
look;
Don 't judge a book by its cover.
I'm not much of a man ry the light
of day,
But by night I'm on II of a lover.
I'm just a sweet Transvestite,
From Transexual
Transylvania
So begins a generally freaky even
ing for Brad and Janet. They are
"lucky" to arrive on the special
evening when Frank will bring his
creation and prospective sexual
plaything — a blond, tanned
athlete named "Rocky Horror" —
to life.
Out of hand
Frank's lifestyle, however, gets
out of hand. Frank becomes like a
sponge in his quest for pleasure
— he takes and takes but never
gives anything back; so accuses
his girlfriend Columbia. Indeed he
begins to unreservedly dispose of
anyone who ceases to entertain
him.
Frank and his companions

begin to realize that their pleasure
lives (drugs, sex. the constant
party atmosphere) only mask their
pain and loneliness. Frank s ser
vants, Riff Raff and Magenta.turn
against him. As Riff Raff shouts.
"Your mission is a failure Your
lifestyle's too extreme," he de
stroys Frank with a laser and re
turns. with Magenta, to the planet
Transexual in the galaxy Tran
sylvania.
The human dilemma, the strug
gle between societal order and the
"liberating" pursuit of pleasure,
remains unresolved:
And crawling on the planet's face
Some insects called the human
race
Lost in time and lost in space
And meaning.
The Rocky Horror Show's
everpresent sexuality has its en
tertaining yet valid place in the
sphere of "redeeming social
value."
In fact, far more offensive than
any of the show's explicitness was
the mystifying unreceptiveness of
San Francisco to the play. The
Montgomery Playhouse just may
have been the wrong place for The
Rocky Horror Show, since its at
mosphere hinders the attention
the show definitely deserves.

ual escapades, the fun of early
rock n' roll, dancing to match,
some incredibly clever lyrics and
profound science fiction themes. It
is a transsexual science fiction
rock musical — and classier than
the Montgomery Playhouse.
The show was very profession
ally done (much more so than the
movie version, excepting Tim Cur
ry's performance as Frank). The
San Francisco production offers a
good band; the band, in fact, re
ceived a more enthusiastic ova
tion from the audience than the
cast, although the cast was quite
capable.
David James got into his role as
Frank N. Furter just fine and can
be very funny. His major difficulty,
unfortunately, was the inevitable
but almost impossible task of
competing with Curry, the lad
in the original touring cast as well
as in the movie.
The role of Frank N. Furter
seems to have been made for
Curry, who was uniquely equip
ped to play up every bit of Frank's
sensual absurdity. David James

admirably imitated Curry's per
formance as well as anyone.
Overplayed
Brad and Janet's naivete was a
bit overplayed by Robert

Reynolds and Needa Greene.
Bob Dulaney is acrobatically
competent as Rocky Horror. Ros
lyn Rosman as Trixie and
Magenta, Richard Gee as the Nar

rator and Buddy King as Riff Raff
also turn in able performances.
Emil Borelli's voice was perfect for
the parts of Eddie and Dr. Scott.
But the show's most sparkling
asset was Kelli Whitehead, new to
the show as the spunky Columbia.
The action of the play itself oc
curs during on adventurous night
in the lives of super-straight Brad
Majors and his virginal fiance.
Janet Weiss— the personificatons
of traditional societal mores.
When their car breaks down in the
middle of nowhere on an eerie,
stormy night (naturally), they find
themselves asking for help at Dr.
Frank N. Furter's hideaway.
He greets them in all his trans
vestite glory;
Don't get strung out by the way '
look;
Don 't judge a book by its cover.
I'm not much of a man ry the light
of day,
But by night I'm on II of a lover.
I'm just a sweet Transvestite,
From Transexual
Transylvania
So begins a generally freaky even
ing for Brad and Janet. They are
"lucky" to arrive on the special
evening when Frank will bring his
creation and prospective sexual
plaything — a blond, tanned
athlete named "Rocky Horror" —
to life.
Out of hand
Frank's lifestyle, however, gets
out of hand. Frank becomes like a
sponge in his quest for pleasure
— he takes and takes but never
gives anything back; so accuses
his girlfriend Columbia. Indeed he
begins to unreservedly dispose of
anyone who ceases to entertain
him.
Frank and his companions

begin to realize that their pleasure
lives (drugs, sex. the constant
party atmosphere) only mask their
pain and loneliness. Frank s ser
vants, Riff Raff and Magenta.turn
against him. As Riff Raff shouts.
"Your mission is a failure Your
lifestyle's too extreme," he de
stroys Frank with a laser and re
turns. with Magenta, to the planet
Transexual in the galaxy Tran
sylvania.
The human dilemma, the strug
gle between societal order and the
"liberating" pursuit of pleasure,
remains unresolved:
And crawling on the planet's face
Some insects called the human
race
Lost in time and lost in space
And meaning.
The Rocky Horror Show's
everpresent sexuality has its en
tertaining yet valid place in the
sphere of "redeeming social
value."
In fact, far more offensive than
any of the show's explicitness was
the mystifying unreceptiveness of
San Francisco to the play. The
Montgomery Playhouse just may
have been the wrong place for The
Rocky Horror Show, since its at
mosphere hinders the attention
the show definitely deserves.

competing with Curry, the lad
in the original touring cast as well
as in the movie.
The role of Frank N. Furter
seems to have been made for
Curry, who was uniquely equip
ped to play up every bit of Frank's
sensual absurdity. David James

admirably imitated Curry's per
formance as well as anyone.
Overplayed
Brad and Janet's naivete was a
bit overplayed by Robert

Reynolds and Needa Greene.
Bob Dulaney is acrobatically
competent as Rocky Horror. Ros
lyn Rosman as Trixie and
Magenta, Richard Gee as the Nar

rator and Buddy King as Riff Raff
also turn in able performances.
Emil Borelli's voice was perfect for
the parts of Eddie and Dr. Scott.
But the show's most sparkling
asset was Kelli Whitehead, new to
the show as the spunky Columbia.
The action of the play itself oc
curs during on adventurous night
in the lives of super-straight Brad
Majors and his virginal fiance.
Janet Weiss— the personificatons
of traditional societal mores.
When their car breaks down in the
middle of nowhere on an eerie,
stormy night (naturally), they find
themselves asking for help at Dr.
Frank N. Furter's hideaway.
He greets them in all his trans
vestite glory;
Don't get strung out by the way '
look;
Don 't judge a book by its cover.
I'm not much of a man ry the light
of day,
But by night I'm on II of a lover.
I'm just a sweet Transvestite,
From Transexual
Transylvania
So begins a generally freaky even
ing for Brad and Janet. They are
"lucky" to arrive on the special
evening when Frank will bring his
creation and prospective sexual
plaything — a blond, tanned
athlete named "Rocky Horror" —
to life.
Out of hand
Frank's lifestyle, however, gets
out of hand. Frank becomes like a
sponge in his quest for pleasure
— he takes and takes but never
gives anything back; so accuses
his girlfriend Columbia. Indeed he
begins to unreservedly dispose of
anyone who ceases to entertain
him.
Frank and his companions

begin to realize that their pleasure
lives (drugs, sex. the constant
party atmosphere) only mask their
pain and loneliness. Frank s ser
vants, Riff Raff and Magenta.turn
against him. As Riff Raff shouts.
"Your mission is a failure Your
lifestyle's too extreme," he de
stroys Frank with a laser and re
turns. with Magenta, to the planet
Transexual in the galaxy Tran
sylvania.
The human dilemma, the strug
gle between societal order and the
"liberating" pursuit of pleasure,
remains unresolved:
And crawling on the planet's face
Some insects called the human
race
Lost in time and lost in space
And meaning.
The Rocky Horror Show's
everpresent sexuality has its en
tertaining yet valid place in the
sphere of "redeeming social
value."
In fact, far more offensive than
any of the show's explicitness was
the mystifying unreceptiveness of
San Francisco to the play. The
Montgomery Playhouse just may
have been the wrong place for The
Rocky Horror Show, since its at
mosphere hinders the attention
the show definitely deserves.
