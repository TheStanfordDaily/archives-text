told Nevada supporters yesterday he is
shooting for a first ballot victory at the Re
publican convention and that he is not dis
couraged by President Gerald Ford's 2-1
landslide in Michigan.
The former California governor said it
would have taken a "miracle" for him to
beat Ford on Tuesday in the tatter's home
state.

expected there.

No man's land' in South Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa —
South Africa announced yesterday it will
create a 1000-mile-long no man's land
along the border of Angola in an effort to
stem escalating raids by black nationalist
guerrillas into disputed South-West Africa.
The government also announced sweep
ing measures giving authorities powers to
evacuate villagers from prohibited areas,"
order curfews, conduct searches, restrict
travel and arrest suspected terrorists.
The announcements marked a sharp in
tensification of the struggle with guerrillas of
the South-West Africa People's Organiza
tion (SWAPO). They followed reports of a

daylight SWAPO raid Tuesday in which the
guerrillas publicly executed a 70-year-old
black villager.
Senate approves spy monitor
WASHINGTON — The Senate yester
day overwhelmingly approved creation of a
permanent committee designed to monitor
and control the activities of the CIA, FBI and
other American spy agencies.
A resolution creating thel 5-member Sen
ate panel was approved by a 72-22 vote
after an amendment stripping many of its
powers was defeated by a 2-1 margin.
Passage of the resolution marked the
first legislation to result from the Senate
Select Intelligence Committee's 15-month
investigation of spy agencies.
Armed Services Committee chairman
John Stennis (D-Miss.) failed by a 63-31
vote to persuade the Senate toTet his panel
retain its exclusive jurisdiction over the Na
tional Security Agency, the Defense Intelli
gence Agency and other Defense Depart
ment spy agencies.
High court limits warnings
WASHINGTON — A person suspected
of a crime need not be advised of his full
range of constitutional rights before testify
ing to a grand jury, according to a Supreme
Court decision announced yesterday.
The court refused to extend to these so
called "virtual defendants" the Miranda
decision precautions which must be given
suspects being questioned by police.
Chief Justice Warren Burger said apply
ing that rule to grand jury witnesses would
be an "extravagant expansion" of the

Miranda rule.
The court rejected 8-0 the claim of Roy
Mandujano of San Antonio, Tex., that his
testimony before a federal grand jury inves
tigating narcotics violations should be
barred from use in his perjury trial.
Burger, speaking for a four-member
plurality of the court, said extending the
Miranda rule to a grand jury setting "would
require that the witnesses be told that there
was an absolute right to silence, and obvi
ously any such warning would be incorrect,
for there is no such right before a grand
jury."
Students riot in Jerusalem
JERUSALEM — A demonstration by
Arab university students and a counter
demonstration by right-wing Jewish stu
dents erupted into a clash yesterday at
Jerusalem's Hebrew University.
Hadassah Hospital said six students —
four Jews and two Arabs — were injured in
the first confrontation between civilians of
the two groups during the current wave of
Arab unrest.
Police said 150 Israeli Arabs studying at
Hebrew University were demonstrating
against Israel's Arab policies when Jewish
students led by militant American Rabbi
Meir Kahane started a counter
demonstration a few yards away.
The two groups began shouting insults
and hurling rocks at each other. When the
Arabs raised posters of protesters killed in
recent clashes with Israeli soldiers, the
Jewish students rushed forward with clubs,
officials said.

Doctor indicted for murders
HACKENSACK, N.J. — A surgeon was
charged with five counts of murder yester
day in the "Dr. X" case involving a series of
mysterious deaths in a hospital a decade
ago. Prosecutors couldn't prove murder
then, but they say medical advances make
it possible now.
Traces of curare, a muscle-relaxing drug
that can kill when given in large doses, re
portedly were found in laboratory tests of
tissues from the five bodies after they were
exhumed this year. Authorities would not
say whether the surgeon, Mario Jas
calevich, is charged with giving the victims
this drug.
Jascalevich, of Englewood Cliffs, was ar
rested yesterday, en route to work at Christ
Hospital in Jersey City. He pleaded inno
cent at an arraignment and was held for
several hours before being released on
$150,000 bond. He was not available for
comment.

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa —

Select Intelligence Committee's 15-month
investigation of spy agencies.
Armed Services Committee chairman
John Stennis (D-Miss.) failed by a 63-31

High court limits warnings
WASHINGTON — A person suspected
of a crime need not be advised of his full
range of constitutional rights before testify
ing to a grand jury, according to a Supreme
Court decision announced yesterday.
The court refused to extend to these so
called "virtual defendants" the Miranda
decision precautions which must be given
suspects being questioned by police.
Chief Justice Warren Burger said apply
ing that rule to grand jury witnesses would
be an "extravagant expansion" of the

Miranda rule.
The court rejected 8-0 the claim of Roy
Mandujano of San Antonio, Tex., that his
testimony before a federal grand jury inves
tigating narcotics violations should be
barred from use in his perjury trial.
Burger, speaking for a four-member
plurality of the court, said extending the
Miranda rule to a grand jury setting "would
require that the witnesses be told that there
was an absolute right to silence, and obvi
ously any such warning would be incorrect,
for there is no such right before a grand
jury."
Students riot in Jerusalem
JERUSALEM — A demonstration by
Arab university students and a counter

Doctor indicted for murders
HACKENSACK, N.J. — A surgeon was
charged with five counts of murder yester
day in the "Dr. X" case involving a series of
mysterious deaths in a hospital a decade
ago. Prosecutors couldn't prove murder
then, but they say medical advances make
it possible now.
Traces of curare, a muscle-relaxing drug
that can kill when given in large doses, re
portedly were found in laboratory tests of
tissues from the five bodies after they were
exhumed this year. Authorities would not
say whether the surgeon, Mario Jas
calevich, is charged with giving the victims
this drug.
Jascalevich, of Englewood Cliffs, was ar
rested yesterday, en route to work at Christ

High court limits warnings
WASHINGTON — A person suspected
of a crime need not be advised of his full
range of constitutional rights before testify
ing to a grand jury, according to a Supreme
Court decision announced yesterday.
The court refused to extend to these so
called "virtual defendants" the Miranda
decision precautions which must be given
suspects being questioned by police.
Chief Justice Warren Burger said apply
ing that rule to grand jury witnesses would
be an "extravagant expansion" of the

Miranda rule.
The court rejected 8-0 the claim of Roy
Mandujano of San Antonio, Tex., that his
testimony before a federal grand jury inves
tigating narcotics violations should be
barred from use in his perjury trial.
Burger, speaking for a four-member
plurality of the court, said extending the
Miranda rule to a grand jury setting "would
require that the witnesses be told that there
was an absolute right to silence, and obvi
ously any such warning would be incorrect,
for there is no such right before a grand
jury."
Students riot in Jerusalem
JERUSALEM — A demonstration by
Arab university students and a counter
demonstration by right-wing Jewish stu
dents erupted into a clash yesterday at
Jerusalem's Hebrew University.
Hadassah Hospital said six students —
four Jews and two Arabs — were injured in
the first confrontation between civilians of
the two groups during the current wave of
Arab unrest.
Police said 150 Israeli Arabs studying at
Hebrew University were demonstrating
against Israel's Arab policies when Jewish
students led by militant American Rabbi
Meir Kahane started a counter
demonstration a few yards away.
The two groups began shouting insults
and hurling rocks at each other. When the
Arabs raised posters of protesters killed in
recent clashes with Israeli soldiers, the
Jewish students rushed forward with clubs,
officials said.

Doctor indicted for murders
HACKENSACK, N.J. — A surgeon was
charged with five counts of murder yester
day in the "Dr. X" case involving a series of
mysterious deaths in a hospital a decade
ago. Prosecutors couldn't prove murder
then, but they say medical advances make
it possible now.
Traces of curare, a muscle-relaxing drug
that can kill when given in large doses, re
portedly were found in laboratory tests of
tissues from the five bodies after they were
exhumed this year. Authorities would not
say whether the surgeon, Mario Jas
calevich, is charged with giving the victims
this drug.
Jascalevich, of Englewood Cliffs, was ar
rested yesterday, en route to work at Christ
Hospital in Jersey City. He pleaded inno
cent at an arraignment and was held for
several hours before being released on
$150,000 bond. He was not available for
comment.
