# Solution to tenure boycott
## 
### 
Yesterday's boycott of
economics courses by suppor
ters of Assoc. Prof. Duncan Foley
may clue us in to the Final Solu
tion to the teaching vs. tenure
problem which so vexes under
graduates.
Picture this scenario, if you will:
STANFORD—AII 6000 of the
University's undergraduates
today protested the alleged
short-shrift given teaching at Stan
ford by refusing to attend any of
their classes.
Organizers of the walkout said it
would continue until every profes
sor receiving an "above average"
or better rating by the ASSU
Course Guide was immediately
granted tenure.
"You should see those clas
srooms today!" exclaimed walk
out organizer Shirley Fail. "No
body's learnin' nothin'. We sure
gave the University the shaft to
day!"
University Ombudsman John
Goheen reported numerous calls
from despondent faculty mem
bers complaining of "years of re
search and nobody to describe it
to."
Impeding bicycles
President R.W. "Dick" Lyman,
peddling his now-famous brand of
moderation, refused to comment
on the strike, except to mutter
about crowds in White Plaza
which impeded his bicycle path to
Building 10.
Provost William Miller, spend
ing his sabbatical at his house cor
recting a few design mistakes by
Frank Lloyd Wright, said today's
protest "sounds like some sort of
wake." He was alluding to the
death of undergraduate educa
tion, which occurred here last
year.
Legal Adviser to the President
James Siena said he saw no way
the University could force stu
dents to attend class, adding that
if one existed "it would have been
tried some time ago."
Siena ruled out the keeping of
attendance records as a violation
of students' privacy under the
Buckley Amendment.

Students appeared to be taking
the action in stride. Health en
thusiasts were in full stride on the
Angell Field track, but lifters in the
Encina weight room refused to
work out until Assoc. Physical
Education Prof. Wesley Ruff left
the room.
"As long as he's here, it's a
class, and there are no classes
today," one student emphasized
while deadlifting 2000 pounds.

Sporadic violence was reported
around the campus. A physics
student was in serious condition
after being impaled with protrac
tors while attempting to turn in a
problem set.
Most of the campus, however,
enjoyed the respite from the
heavy labors of classroom work.
At a noon rally in White Plaza,
members of the Revolutionary
Brigade celebrated. "We've been
carrying the University on our
backs for 2000 years. It's about
time we threw 'em off."
Impromptu discussions
Students at campus residences
conducted impromptu discus
sions of the tenure process in var
ious saunas and swimming pools.
A resident of ATO said her pool
group discussed the problem "at
great depth — about four feet."
Life was pretty much the same
around Lambda Nu, where resi
dents reported class attendance
patterns were unchanged from
what they have been for 13 years.
At Whitman House, however, a
spokeswoman announced a
series of in-house seminars "so
the intellectual fervor won't die."
As their time was freed from
academic work, students seemed
likely to turn their attention to other
matters. Campus politicos at the
ASSU office feared a lengthy bal

lot in next week's ASSU Senate
election.
ASSU Senate
"Concern over classroom work
is the main reason why a few stu
dents don't run for the senate
each year," said ASSU Vice Pres
ident Al Tomzoahdijilek.
Support for the strike came
from the Stanford Daily, which
editorialized, "While we of course
hope that no crippling damage is
done the University, any continua
tion of this walkout will do just that.
And unless the demands are met,
we urge students to continue the
walkout."
Towards the end of the day, the
sighs of anguished administrators
indicated that the walkout was in
deed having a devastating impact
on the University.
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences Halsey Royden, known for
his Irish temper, shot back at a
reporter: "God damn it all! Don't
these undergraduates know what
loneliness their professors are
suffering? Can they conceive
what it's like standing in front of an
empty room for an hour? Patty
Hearst thought she had it bad in
that closet!"
Rating criteria
Faculty members, although
supporting an increased em
phasis on teaching in tenure deci
sions, have voted not to go along
with the Gourse Guide rating
criteria.
Instead, they have suggested
that teaching evaluations be
made by a three-member panel,
consisting of the professor, his/
her spouse and one guest from
their cocktail party last Friday.
An evaluation compromise is
expected, by which students
would be invited to the cocktail
parties.
When such an agreement is
reached, the pressure brought to
bear may trap the administration.
At that time, student leaders hope
to have won good teaching by re
fusing to receive any of it.
