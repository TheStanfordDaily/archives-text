## Petroff vetoes Senate actions 
### Jack Vaughn 
ASSU President Vic Petroff last
night vetoed two ASSU Senate
actions allocating a total of $2900
to the ASSU Course Guide for
next year.
The first senate action over
turned the ASSU Publication
Board's decision last week to re
fuse the guide's request for
$1450. Board members said too
much course guide money would
go to salaries to justify allocating
board money.
The board's basic policy, ac
cording to Chairman Jeff Stoler, is
to avoid granting funds to publica
tions for staff salaries and to con
centrate allocations on publication
costs other than salaries.
The second senate action allo
cated another $1450 to the guide
from ASSU reserve funds.
The senate approved both ac
tions by a vote of 9-2.
Veto letter
"If the Publications Board had
acted irresponsibly or had based
its decision on discriminatory
grounds, then the senate would
have had a legitimate reason to
reverse the Board s decision,"
Petroff wrote in his veto letter to
Senate Chairman Bill Hoke.

"In this case, however, the Pub
lications Board acted in good faith,
adhering to established, reasona
ble policies" in denying funds to
the guide, Petroff wrote.
Petroff said he vetoed the sec
ond action because "the tradi
tional procedure for the funding of
ASSU projects has been to take
out loans from the reserve of the
ASSU" rather than receiving di
rect grants through senate action.
Petroff proposed that the guide
take out a $2900 loar, from the
ASSU 'to be paid back when the
Course Guide is able."
Later last night, Petroff, Course
Guide Program Manager Greg
Larson and ASSU Financial Man
ager Chris Cline agreed on the
loan proposal. Larson said he
does not plan any attempt to over
ride Petroff's veto.
'Satisfied'
"I'm basically satisfied with the
way it turned out," Larson said,
but added that he still believes the
Publications Board's decision was
wrong.
However, ASSU Sen. Tim
Conway, a member of the Course
Guide Policy Board, said he is un
satisfied with the compromise. "I

don't quite see what Vic's trying to
do," he said. "I just don t like the
sound of it."
Conway said he did not think
Petroff had the power to veto the
action and that he would support
"and probably instigate'' a senate
override attempt next Monday.
ASSU Sen Sarah Alfadl. Course
Guide Policy Board chairperson,
also predicted an override attempt
when contacted prior to the com
promise. but could not be reached
after Larson's decision.
Conway's objection was based
on the fact that the senate actions
came in the form of resolutions
which technically cannot be vet
oed by the ASSU president.
In his veto letter. Petroff wrote
that he had decided to treat the
actions as bills which can be vet
oed.
"The resolution . .. since its di

rective is intended to be binding
on the Publication Board, is either
invalid, or should be interpreted
and treated as a bill," Petroff
wrote. "I will treat it as a bill."
Hoke attributed the procedural
problem to confusing wording in
the ASSU constitution and by
laws.
"The Constitution clearly does
give the COP (Council of Presi
dents) the power to veto a bill, but
no mention is made of what is a
bill," Hoke explained
Hoke added that he thinks
"Vic s interpretation of the veto
power over a senate action which
is coercive and binding is plausi
ble. He said a paradox" exists
for the senate in that, if it decides
to overrule Petroff's action, it will
implicitly accept Petroff's interpre
tation that the original action was a
bill.
Stoler, former business man
ager of the Chaparral, lauded Pet

roff s vetoes. "Vic Petroff has
taken a very unpolitical stand in
this case," he said
Under the Course Guide s
proposal, the program manager
would make $1350 for the
academic year. "That s more than
the editor of the Daily, the
Sequoia, the Quad and the
Chaparral and the business man
agers of the Sequoia, the Quad
and the Chaparral combined, he
said.
