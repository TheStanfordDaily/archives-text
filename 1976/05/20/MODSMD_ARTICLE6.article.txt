## Petroff vetoes Senate actions 
### Jack Vaughn 
ASSU President Vic Petroff last
night vetoed two ASSU Senate
actions allocating a total of $2900
to the ASSU Course Guide for
next year.
The first senate action over
turned the ASSU Publication
Board's decision last week to re
fuse the guide's request for
$1450. Board members said too
much course guide money would
go to salaries to justify allocating
board money.
The board's basic policy, ac
cording to Chairman Jeff Stoler, is
to avoid granting funds to publica

centrate allocations on publication
costs other than salaries.
The second senate action allo
cated another $1450 to the guide
from ASSU reserve funds.
The senate approved both ac

"If the Publications Board had
acted irresponsibly or had based
its decision on discriminatory
grounds, then the senate would

Petroff wrote in his veto letter to
Senate Chairman Bill Hoke.

"In this case, however, the Pub
lications Board acted in good faith,
adhering to established, reasona

the guide, Petroff wrote.
Petroff said he vetoed the sec
ond action because "the tradi
tional procedure for the funding of
ASSU projects has been to take
out loans from the reserve of the
ASSU" rather than receiving di
rect grants through senate action.
Petroff proposed that the guide
take out a $2900 loar, from the
ASSU 'to be paid back when the
Course Guide is able."
Later last night, Petroff, Course
Guide Program Manager Greg
Larson and ASSU Financial Man
ager Chris Cline agreed on the
loan proposal. Larson said he
does not plan any attempt to over
ride Petroff's veto.
'Satisfied'
"I'm basically satisfied with the
way it turned out," Larson said,
but added that he still believes the
Publications Board's decision was
wrong.
However, ASSU Sen. Tim
Conway, a member of the Course
Guide Policy Board, said he is un
satisfied with the compromise. "I
