# Economics boycott gets strong support
## 
### Philip Feder 
Economics graduate and un
dergraduate students yesterday
called their one-day boycott of
economics classes a success as
class attendance fell sharply.
A Daily survey showed
that about 85 percent of stu
dents enrolled in economics clas
ses stayed away yesterday.
Many of those who didn't go to
class attended informal teach-ins
on the tenure question, even
though others just didn't attend
classes. Others picketed in front
of classrooms, holding placards
bearing such phrases as "Tenure
for teaching excellence," "Boycott
classes today to have teachers
tomorrow" and "What's wrong

with Marxian economics?"
The boycott took place as a pro
test against the Economics De
partment's move to delay the te
nure decision of Assoc. Prof.
Duncan Foley, who has written on
Marxist approaches to
economics.
'Strong support'
ASSU Vice President Deric
Jennings, an economics graduate
student and a boycott organizer,
said yesterday,"The boycott has
certainly shown that there is
strong support (for Foley) among
the undergraduates. It's particu
larly impressive to see graduate
students involved in this, consider
ing their normal level of apathy."
He added that the success of

the boycott "is an indication of the
strength of the case in favor of
Duncan Foley. His loss would
have harmful effects on the
Economics Department and
would reflect very badly on Stan
ford itself."
Economics Prof. John Gurley,
an expert in Marxian economics,
said he canceled his class yes
terday because "I was in support
of the boycott.' He rescheduled
the class for tomorrow.
Some professors held class or
remained in the classroom de
spite the poor showing.
Only four students in
Economics 52, taught by Asst.
Prof. Pentti Kouri, showed up for
class. But Kouri remained to an
swer questions. About 60 of the
260 students enrolled in Econ 1
attended that class.
Foley's class
In Foley's Economics 53 class,
no students attended. But outside
the class in the law school's front
courtyard, about 80 students pic
keted and then discussed the te
nure situation for the duration of
the class time. Foley remained in
the classroom during the entire
50-minute period.
Foley refused to comment on
the effect of the boycott on the
department's decision to change
its mind and to give him tenure.
Some students who crossed
the picket lines and attended class
said they thought the graduate
students imposed the boycott on
the undergraduates.
"The graduate students are
using the undergraduate numbers
to get their point across," said
senior Meredith Brittain, an
Economics 111 student. "If you
talk about it (the Foley tenure dis
pute) with a graduate student, he
just raves about Foley."
Senior John Crawford said, "All
of them (those picketing) are grad
students — they are just friends of

economics classes a success as
class attendance fell sharply.
A Daily survey showed
that about 85 percent of stu
dents enrolled in economics clas
ses stayed away yesterday.
Many of those who didn't go to
class attended informal teach-ins
on the tenure question, even
though others just didn't attend
classes. Others picketed in front
of classrooms, holding placards
bearing such phrases as "Tenure
for teaching excellence," "Boycott
classes today to have teachers
tomorrow" and "What's wrong

with Marxian economics?"
The boycott took place as a pro
test against the Economics De

Duncan Foley, who has written on
Marxist approaches to
economics.
'Strong support'
ASSU Vice President Deric
Jennings, an economics graduate
student and a boycott organizer,
said yesterday,"The boycott has
certainly shown that there is
strong support (for Foley) among
the undergraduates. It's particu
larly impressive to see graduate
students involved in this, consider
ing their normal level of apathy."
He added that the success of

the boycott "is an indication of the
strength of the case in favor of
Duncan Foley. His loss would
have harmful effects on the
Economics Department and
would reflect very badly on Stan
ford itself."
Economics Prof. John Gurley,
an expert in Marxian economics,
said he canceled his class yes
terday because "I was in support
of the boycott.' He rescheduled
the class for tomorrow.
Some professors held class or
remained in the classroom de
spite the poor showing.
Only four students in
Economics 52, taught by Asst.
Prof. Pentti Kouri, showed up for
class. But Kouri remained to an
swer questions. About 60 of the
260 students enrolled in Econ 1
attended that class.
Foley's class
In Foley's Economics 53 class,
no students attended. But outside
the class in the law school's front
courtyard, about 80 students pic
keted and then discussed the te
nure situation for the duration of
the class time. Foley remained in
the classroom during the entire
50-minute period.
Foley refused to comment on
the effect of the boycott on the
department's decision to change
its mind and to give him tenure.
Some students who crossed
the picket lines and attended class
said they thought the graduate
students imposed the boycott on
the undergraduates.
"The graduate students are
using the undergraduate numbers
to get their point across," said
senior Meredith Brittain, an
Economics 111 student. "If you
talk about it (the Foley tenure dis

just raves about Foley."
Senior John Crawford said, "All
