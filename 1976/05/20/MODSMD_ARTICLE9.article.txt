## 
### Rosario Delatorre Transportation reporter 
Robert Augsburger, vice presi
dent for business and finance,
yesterday accepted recommen
dations which would eliminate
free unlimited parking on campus
as of September, according to
Phyllis Hughes, Augsburger's
administrative assistant.
She said Augsburger is ex
pected to pass along the recom
mendation from the University
Committee on Parking and
Transportation to President
Richard Lyman in a meeting to
day.
The committee recommended
that existing parking areas be re
classified. that free parking be li
mited to 40 minute zones and that
a free daytime shuttle bus be es

tablished permanently.
Under the committee's recom
mendation, all present parking
categories except for student re
sident permits would be abolished
and replaced by three classes of
paid parking permits, according to
Donald Winbigler, committee
chairman.
"The committee recommends
that the present hierarchical sys
tem, based upon the status of the
operator of the vehicle, be re
placed by a system involving three
categories of parking, differen
tiated by location and by the price
of the permit, but open equally to
faculty, staff and students," the
recommendation states.
Recommended annual fees for
the permits were listed as: S6O for
Category "A" lots closest to func

tional centers, $36 for Category
"B" lots located an intermediate
distance away from the centers,
and $12 for Category "C" lots lo
cated furthest away from the
centers.
Present student resident per
mits will remain unchaged. The $5
per quarter fee will allow students
to park only in parking lots desig
nated for their residences.
The recommendation noted
that holders of student resident
permits would be able to purchase
permits to park in A, B or C lots.
'Down parking'
Winbigler also explained that
"down parking" would be allowed,
that is, holders of A permits could
park in Band C lots and holders of
B permits could park in C lots.
Winbigler stressed that holders

of A, B or C permits would not be
allowed to use lots designated for
student resident permits.
The committee also recom
mended that exclusive parking for
visitors be eliminated and re
placed by 40 minute time zones
Winbigler said the spaces would
be available to anyone and that
the zones would provide free,
rapid-turnover, short-term parking
at critical points on campus.
He said the time-limit parking
would be for persons on quick er
rands and other brief business.
"We're not interested in providing
parking for students going to clas
ses; the (time-limit) parking is in
tended for rapid turnover," said
Winbigler.
He also said that if the recom
