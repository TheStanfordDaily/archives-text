# Committee recommends free parking limitations on campus next year
## 
### Rosario Delatorre Transportation reporter 
Robert Augsburger, vice presi
dent for business and finance,
yesterday accepted recommen
dations which would eliminate
free unlimited parking on campus
as of September, according to
Phyllis Hughes, Augsburger's
administrative assistant.
She said Augsburger is ex
pected to pass along the recom
mendation from the University
Committee on Parking and
Transportation to President
Richard Lyman in a meeting to
day.
The committee recommended
that existing parking areas be re
classified. that free parking be li
mited to 40 minute zones and that
a free daytime shuttle bus be es

tablished permanently.
Under the committee's recom
mendation, all present parking
categories except for student re
sident permits would be abolished
and replaced by three classes of
paid parking permits, according to
Donald Winbigler, committee
chairman.
"The committee recommends
that the present hierarchical sys
tem, based upon the status of the
operator of the vehicle, be re
placed by a system involving three
categories of parking, differen
tiated by location and by the price
of the permit, but open equally to
faculty, staff and students," the
recommendation states.
Recommended annual fees for
the permits were listed as: S6O for
Category "A" lots closest to func

tional centers, $36 for Category
"B" lots located an intermediate
distance away from the centers,
and $12 for Category "C" lots lo
cated furthest away from the
centers.
Present student resident per
mits will remain unchaged. The $5
per quarter fee will allow students
to park only in parking lots desig
nated for their residences.
The recommendation noted
that holders of student resident
permits would be able to purchase
permits to park in A, B or C lots.
'Down parking'
Winbigler also explained that
"down parking" would be allowed,
that is, holders of A permits could
park in Band C lots and holders of
B permits could park in C lots.
Winbigler stressed that holders

of A, B or C permits would not be
allowed to use lots designated for
student resident permits.
The committee also recom
mended that exclusive parking for
visitors be eliminated and re
placed by 40 minute time zones
Winbigler said the spaces would
be available to anyone and that
the zones would provide free,
rapid-turnover, short-term parking
at critical points on campus.
He said the time-limit parking
would be for persons on quick er
rands and other brief business.
"We're not interested in providing
parking for students going to clas
ses; the (time-limit) parking is in
tended for rapid turnover," said
Winbigler.
He also said that if the recom
mendations are accepted, there
would be no free parking for Uni
versity employes.
The current United Stanford
Employees (USE) contract con
tains a provision for free employe
parking, and the union has re
tained a provision regarding park
ing in its proposals for next year's
contract, according to Douglas
Barton, staff counsel for employe
relations.
Winbigler said that the recom
mended elimination of free park
ing would require the removal of
that (free parking) provision from a
USE contract."
USE President Jim Berk said
the union plans to keep the free
parking provision in its contract.
"We aren't going to give up free
parking close to where we work
We're not going to trade it for any
thing," said Berk.
For all-day parking, the commit
tee recommended that three
pay-parking lots be established
One would be located in the Tre
sidder area, one on Memorial Way
near Memorial Auditorium and
one on Serra Street near Herrin
Laboratory.
"The three lots will be located in
three corners of the campus and
their total capacity will expand the
spaces we now have (in the Main
Library pay lot)," said Winbigler
He added that the Main Library
pay lot will probably be eliminated
after January due to construction
on the Main Library addition.

The committee also recom
mended that a free daytime shut
tle bus be established on a year
round basis on the Serra Street
trunk line and that free shuttle ser
vice be established on an experi
mental basis on the southern side
of the central campus
'The free shuttle would bring
people to the inner campus from
Escondido Village and outlying
parking areas," Winbigler
explained
The committee had no firm re
commendation on a nighttime
shuttle. "There are many more
crucial questions right now I? we
have the equipment, we'll proba
bly use it (at night), although the
(nighttime shuttle bus) experiment
was not particularly encouraging,
said Winbigler.
The recommendation noted
that some committee members
thought that a primary reason for
charging for parking was to deter
excessive and indiscriminate use
of automobiles on campus and to
encourage individuals to seek out
alternative modes of transporta
tion.
Another reason for charging
parking fees noted in the recom
mendation was that it would be
appropriate for those who use
vehicles on campus to pay for
providing parking
Winbigler said he thought re
venue under the proposed park
ing system would be about
$120,000 more than the $245,000
generated this year under the pre
sent parking system.

Robert Augsburger, vice presi
dent for business and finance,
yesterday accepted recommen
dations which would eliminate
free unlimited parking on campus
as of September, according to
Phyllis Hughes, Augsburger's
administrative assistant.
She said Augsburger is ex
pected to pass along the recom
mendation from the University
Committee on Parking and
Transportation to President
Richard Lyman in a meeting to
day.
The committee recommended
that existing parking areas be re
classified. that free parking be li
mited to 40 minute zones and that
a free daytime shuttle bus be es

tablished permanently.
Under the committee's recom
mendation, all present parking
categories except for student re
sident permits would be abolished
and replaced by three classes of
paid parking permits, according to
Donald Winbigler, committee
chairman.
"The committee recommends
that the present hierarchical sys
tem, based upon the status of the
operator of the vehicle, be re
placed by a system involving three
categories of parking, differen
tiated by location and by the price
of the permit, but open equally to
faculty, staff and students," the
recommendation states.
Recommended annual fees for
the permits were listed as: S6O for
Category "A" lots closest to func

tional centers, $36 for Category
"B" lots located an intermediate
distance away from the centers,
and $12 for Category "C" lots lo
cated furthest away from the
centers.
Present student resident per
mits will remain unchaged. The $5
per quarter fee will allow students
to park only in parking lots desig
nated for their residences.
The recommendation noted
that holders of student resident
permits would be able to purchase
permits to park in A, B or C lots.
'Down parking'
Winbigler also explained that
"down parking" would be allowed,
that is, holders of A permits could
park in Band C lots and holders of
B permits could park in C lots.
Winbigler stressed that holders

of A, B or C permits would not be
allowed to use lots designated for
student resident permits.
The committee also recom
mended that exclusive parking for
visitors be eliminated and re
placed by 40 minute time zones
Winbigler said the spaces would
be available to anyone and that
the zones would provide free,
rapid-turnover, short-term parking
at critical points on campus.
He said the time-limit parking
would be for persons on quick er
rands and other brief business.
"We're not interested in providing
parking for students going to clas
ses; the (time-limit) parking is in
tended for rapid turnover," said
Winbigler.
He also said that if the recom
mendations are accepted, there
would be no free parking for Uni
versity employes.
The current United Stanford
Employees (USE) contract con
tains a provision for free employe
parking, and the union has re
tained a provision regarding park
ing in its proposals for next year's
contract, according to Douglas
Barton, staff counsel for employe
relations.
Winbigler said that the recom
mended elimination of free park
ing would require the removal of
that (free parking) provision from a
USE contract."
USE President Jim Berk said
the union plans to keep the free
parking provision in its contract.
"We aren't going to give up free
parking close to where we work
We're not going to trade it for any
thing," said Berk.
For all-day parking, the commit
tee recommended that three
pay-parking lots be established
One would be located in the Tre
sidder area, one on Memorial Way
near Memorial Auditorium and
one on Serra Street near Herrin
Laboratory.
"The three lots will be located in
three corners of the campus and
their total capacity will expand the
spaces we now have (in the Main
Library pay lot)," said Winbigler
He added that the Main Library
pay lot will probably be eliminated
after January due to construction
on the Main Library addition.

The committee also recom
mended that a free daytime shut
tle bus be established on a year
round basis on the Serra Street
trunk line and that free shuttle ser
vice be established on an experi
mental basis on the southern side
of the central campus
'The free shuttle would bring
people to the inner campus from
Escondido Village and outlying
parking areas," Winbigler
explained
The committee had no firm re
commendation on a nighttime
shuttle. "There are many more
crucial questions right now I? we
have the equipment, we'll proba
bly use it (at night), although the
(nighttime shuttle bus) experiment
was not particularly encouraging,
said Winbigler.
The recommendation noted
that some committee members
thought that a primary reason for
charging for parking was to deter
excessive and indiscriminate use
of automobiles on campus and to
encourage individuals to seek out
alternative modes of transporta
tion.
Another reason for charging
parking fees noted in the recom
mendation was that it would be
appropriate for those who use
vehicles on campus to pay for
providing parking
Winbigler said he thought re
venue under the proposed park
ing system would be about
$120,000 more than the $245,000
generated this year under the pre
sent parking system.

dent for business and finance,
yesterday accepted recommen
dations which would eliminate
free unlimited parking on campus
as of September, according to
Phyllis Hughes, Augsburger's
administrative assistant.
She said Augsburger is ex
pected to pass along the recom
mendation from the University
Committee on Parking and
Transportation to President
Richard Lyman in a meeting to
day.
The committee recommended
that existing parking areas be re
classified. that free parking be li
mited to 40 minute zones and that
a free daytime shuttle bus be es

tablished permanently.
Under the committee's recom
mendation, all present parking
categories except for student re
sident permits would be abolished
and replaced by three classes of
paid parking permits, according to
Donald Winbigler, committee
chairman.
"The committee recommends
that the present hierarchical sys
tem, based upon the status of the
operator of the vehicle, be re
placed by a system involving three
categories of parking, differen
tiated by location and by the price
of the permit, but open equally to
faculty, staff and students," the
recommendation states.
Recommended annual fees for
the permits were listed as: S6O for
Category "A" lots closest to func

tional centers, $36 for Category
"B" lots located an intermediate
distance away from the centers,
and $12 for Category "C" lots lo
cated furthest away from the
centers.
Present student resident per
mits will remain unchaged. The $5
per quarter fee will allow students
to park only in parking lots desig
nated for their residences.
The recommendation noted
that holders of student resident
permits would be able to purchase
permits to park in A, B or C lots.
'Down parking'
Winbigler also explained that
"down parking" would be allowed,
that is, holders of A permits could
park in Band C lots and holders of
B permits could park in C lots.
Winbigler stressed that holders

of A, B or C permits would not be
allowed to use lots designated for
student resident permits.
The committee also recom
mended that exclusive parking for
visitors be eliminated and re
placed by 40 minute time zones
Winbigler said the spaces would
be available to anyone and that
the zones would provide free,
rapid-turnover, short-term parking
at critical points on campus.
He said the time-limit parking
would be for persons on quick er
rands and other brief business.
"We're not interested in providing
parking for students going to clas
ses; the (time-limit) parking is in
tended for rapid turnover," said
Winbigler.
He also said that if the recom
mendations are accepted, there
would be no free parking for Uni
versity employes.
The current United Stanford
Employees (USE) contract con
tains a provision for free employe
parking, and the union has re
tained a provision regarding park
ing in its proposals for next year's
contract, according to Douglas
Barton, staff counsel for employe
relations.
Winbigler said that the recom
mended elimination of free park
ing would require the removal of
that (free parking) provision from a
USE contract."
USE President Jim Berk said
the union plans to keep the free
parking provision in its contract.
"We aren't going to give up free
parking close to where we work
We're not going to trade it for any
thing," said Berk.
For all-day parking, the commit
tee recommended that three
pay-parking lots be established
One would be located in the Tre
sidder area, one on Memorial Way
near Memorial Auditorium and
one on Serra Street near Herrin
Laboratory.
"The three lots will be located in
three corners of the campus and
their total capacity will expand the
spaces we now have (in the Main
Library pay lot)," said Winbigler
He added that the Main Library
pay lot will probably be eliminated
after January due to construction
on the Main Library addition.

The committee also recom
mended that a free daytime shut
tle bus be established on a year
round basis on the Serra Street
trunk line and that free shuttle ser
vice be established on an experi
mental basis on the southern side
of the central campus
'The free shuttle would bring
people to the inner campus from
Escondido Village and outlying
parking areas," Winbigler
explained
The committee had no firm re
commendation on a nighttime
shuttle. "There are many more
crucial questions right now I? we
have the equipment, we'll proba
bly use it (at night), although the
(nighttime shuttle bus) experiment
was not particularly encouraging,
said Winbigler.
The recommendation noted
that some committee members
thought that a primary reason for
charging for parking was to deter
excessive and indiscriminate use
of automobiles on campus and to
encourage individuals to seek out
alternative modes of transporta
tion.
Another reason for charging
parking fees noted in the recom
mendation was that it would be
appropriate for those who use
vehicles on campus to pay for
providing parking
Winbigler said he thought re
venue under the proposed park
ing system would be about
$120,000 more than the $245,000
generated this year under the pre
sent parking system.
