# Dickinson Symposia
## Profs discuss USSR, China 
### Mark Shibuya Arlene Warmack 
"There are a minimum of 10,000
political prisoners in the Soviet Union
today," attorney and author Leonard
Schroeter said at last night's Dickinson
Symposium on "Human Rights in the
Soviet Union."
Schroeter, who was one of seven
symposium panelists, claimed that
Soviet dissidents are subjected to
psychiatric imprisonment and
harassment and that a "series of horror
stories" regularly emerges from the
Soviet Union.
"No one that I know who has been to
the Soviet Union denies that the most
important thing we can do is to be the
voice of people that don't have a voice
of their own. Protesting is the most
important thing we can do," said
Schroeter.
Foremost importance
Berkeley Law Professor Frank
Newman, a lobbyist for human rights
at the United Nations, agreed with
Schroeter that protesting was of
foremost importance.
"The big question," said Newman,
"is to whom do you speak and to
whom do you protest."
Besides writing to the Soviet gov
ernment, Newman said that "a tre
mendous amount can be done in
Washington, D.C. Another great forum
is the U.N."
Ginetta Sagan of Amnesty Interna
tional said that "prisoners of consci
ence" in the Soviet Union "present an

enormous problem" for human rights.
"We are faced with a need for in
volving more and more people in the
United States as well as other coun
tries," she said.
Sagan said that the first step in ap
pealing for the freedom of political
prisoners is to write to the Soviet gov
ernment. "No matter how tyrranical a
government is they all want to be
loved," she said.
Fearful
Columbia University Law Prof. John
Hazard asked why the Soviets "have to
be so fegrful of people with new
ideas."
He noted that the Soviets "have
come to a crisis mentality." He said
that "they treat every situation as in
volving a clear and present danger.
They feel there is a danger behind
every tree."
Asst. History Prof. Dorothy Atkin
son said that "Soviet women have
achieved full equality under the law.
However, equality under law does not
mean equality in everyday life."
Atkinson said that only one quarter
of the Communist party in the Soviet
Union are women. An example of their
powerlessness is their inability "to di
vert funds from military purposes to
household needs," she said.
The symposium on Wednesday
night dealt with relations between
China and the Soviet Union.
Hazard told an audience of about
100 persons that the Chinese are cut
ting into Soviet influence in the third

world and pose a "military and more
importantly, an ideological threat" to
the Soviet Union.
The Soviets remain concerned
about the bombing of their embassy in
Peking, the seizure and detention of
one of their helicopters, and the New
China Constitution which does not in
clude the clause in the previous con
stitution which dealt with Soviet
friendship, Hazard said.
Ideologically, Chinese communists
accuse the Soviets of "opening the gate
to capitalism." he said.
The Soviets in turn believe that "the
Chinese system created the state of a
military dictatorship rather than one
controlled by the Communist party,"
Hazard said.
Professor of Political Science at
UC-Berkeley John Starr said that the
ideological accusations exchanged by
the two countries are "mirror images."
Each country believes its own struc
ture is legitimate, he said.
The Soviets accuse the Chinese of
being militaristic and the Chinese ac
cuse the Soviets of being capitalistic,
he said.
Mao Tse-Tung plays an important
role in the Sino-Soviet dispute, Starr
said. While vigorously critical of the
Soviet Union, Mao still sup
ported Stalin, Starr said.

Mao sets four basic criteria for a
legitimate leader, according to Starr.
Such a leader must have a good class
background, must accept the dialecti
cal method, must have revolutionary
experience and must integrate himself
with those he leads.
Legitimacy
Mao criticized Stalin for breaking
the link between himself and those he
led and regards the premiership of the
former Soviet leader as a reference
point of legitimacy, after which the
Soviets started to deteriorate, Starr
said.
Asst. Prof, of Political Science Harry
Harding said that the "conventional
wisdom" which holds that the death of
Mao will bring about rapprochement
between the two countries will not be
borne out.
It is clear that Mao has been "un

compromising" in Chinese-Soviet re
lations and that both the Chinese and
the Soviets are "locked into rigid hos
tility," he said.
"The questionable hypothesis" that
there is a group of Chinese leaders
waiting to resume close relations with
the Soviet Union is false; Mao will
have an impact, he said.
Accommodation
University of San Francisco
Economics Department head Yuan-li
Wu said that the Chinese are more
likely to push for accommodation than
rapprochement.
Tremendous increases in Chinese
oil production are creating a need for
more oil refining centers, which
would be "vulnerable to Soviet pres
sure," Wu said.

pealing for the freedom of political
prisoners is to write to the Soviet gov
ernment. "No matter how tyrranical a
government is they all want to be
loved," she said.
Fearful
Columbia University Law Prof. John
Hazard asked why the Soviets "have to
be so fegrful of people with new
ideas."
He noted that the Soviets "have
come to a crisis mentality." He said
that "they treat every situation as in
volving a clear and present danger.
They feel there is a danger behind
every tree."
Asst. History Prof. Dorothy Atkin
son said that "Soviet women have
achieved full equality under the law.
However, equality under law does not
mean equality in everyday life."
Atkinson said that only one quarter
of the Communist party in the Soviet
Union are women. An example of their
powerlessness is their inability "to di
vert funds from military purposes to
household needs," she said.
The symposium on Wednesday
night dealt with relations between
China and the Soviet Union.
Hazard told an audience of about
100 persons that the Chinese are cut
ting into Soviet influence in the third

world and pose a "military and more
importantly, an ideological threat" to
the Soviet Union.
The Soviets remain concerned
about the bombing of their embassy in
Peking, the seizure and detention of
one of their helicopters, and the New
China Constitution which does not in
clude the clause in the previous con
stitution which dealt with Soviet
friendship, Hazard said.
Ideologically, Chinese communists
accuse the Soviets of "opening the gate
to capitalism." he said.
The Soviets in turn believe that "the
Chinese system created the state of a
military dictatorship rather than one
controlled by the Communist party,"
Hazard said.
Professor of Political Science at
UC-Berkeley John Starr said that the
ideological accusations exchanged by
the two countries are "mirror images."
Each country believes its own struc
ture is legitimate, he said.
The Soviets accuse the Chinese of
being militaristic and the Chinese ac
cuse the Soviets of being capitalistic,
he said.
Mao Tse-Tung plays an important
role in the Sino-Soviet dispute, Starr
said. While vigorously critical of the
Soviet Union, Mao still sup
ported Stalin, Starr said.

Mao sets four basic criteria for a
legitimate leader, according to Starr.
Such a leader must have a good class
background, must accept the dialecti
cal method, must have revolutionary
experience and must integrate himself
with those he leads.
Legitimacy
Mao criticized Stalin for breaking
the link between himself and those he
led and regards the premiership of the
former Soviet leader as a reference
point of legitimacy, after which the
Soviets started to deteriorate, Starr
said.
Asst. Prof, of Political Science Harry
Harding said that the "conventional
wisdom" which holds that the death of
Mao will bring about rapprochement
between the two countries will not be
borne out.
It is clear that Mao has been "un

compromising" in Chinese-Soviet re
lations and that both the Chinese and
the Soviets are "locked into rigid hos
tility," he said.
"The questionable hypothesis" that
there is a group of Chinese leaders
waiting to resume close relations with
the Soviet Union is false; Mao will
have an impact, he said.
Accommodation
University of San Francisco
Economics Department head Yuan-li
Wu said that the Chinese are more
likely to push for accommodation than
rapprochement.
Tremendous increases in Chinese
oil production are creating a need for
more oil refining centers, which
would be "vulnerable to Soviet pres
sure," Wu said.
"There are a minimum of 10,000
political prisoners in the Soviet Union
today," attorney and author Leonard
Schroeter said at last night's Dickinson
Symposium on "Human Rights in the
Soviet Union."
Schroeter, who was one of seven
symposium panelists, claimed that
Soviet dissidents are subjected to
psychiatric imprisonment and
harassment and that a "series of horror
stories" regularly emerges from the
Soviet Union.
"No one that I know who has been to
the Soviet Union denies that the most
important thing we can do is to be the
voice of people that don't have a voice
of their own. Protesting is the most
important thing we can do," said
Schroeter.
Foremost importance
Berkeley Law Professor Frank
Newman, a lobbyist for human rights
at the United Nations, agreed with
Schroeter that protesting was of
foremost importance.
"The big question," said Newman,
"is to whom do you speak and to
whom do you protest."
Besides writing to the Soviet gov
ernment, Newman said that "a tre
mendous amount can be done in
Washington, D.C. Another great forum
is the U.N."
Ginetta Sagan of Amnesty Interna
tional said that "prisoners of consci
ence" in the Soviet Union "present an

enormous problem" for human rights.
"We are faced with a need for in
volving more and more people in the
United States as well as other coun
tries," she said.

to capitalism." he said.
The Soviets in turn believe that "the
Chinese system created the state of a
military dictatorship rather than one
controlled by the Communist party,"
Hazard said.
Professor of Political Science at
UC-Berkeley John Starr said that the
ideological accusations exchanged by
the two countries are "mirror images."
Each country believes its own struc
ture is legitimate, he said.
The Soviets accuse the Chinese of
being militaristic and the Chinese ac
cuse the Soviets of being capitalistic,
he said.
Mao Tse-Tung plays an important
role in the Sino-Soviet dispute, Starr
said. While vigorously critical of the
Soviet Union, Mao still sup
ported Stalin, Starr said.

Mao sets four basic criteria for a
legitimate leader, according to Starr.
Such a leader must have a good class
background, must accept the dialecti
cal method, must have revolutionary
experience and must integrate himself
with those he leads.
Legitimacy
Mao criticized Stalin for breaking
the link between himself and those he
led and regards the premiership of the
former Soviet leader as a reference
point of legitimacy, after which the
Soviets started to deteriorate, Starr
said.
Asst. Prof, of Political Science Harry
Harding said that the "conventional
wisdom" which holds that the death of
Mao will bring about rapprochement
between the two countries will not be
borne out.
It is clear that Mao has been "un

compromising" in Chinese-Soviet re
lations and that both the Chinese and
the Soviets are "locked into rigid hos
tility," he said.
"The questionable hypothesis" that
there is a group of Chinese leaders
waiting to resume close relations with
the Soviet Union is false; Mao will
have an impact, he said.
Accommodation
University of San Francisco
Economics Department head Yuan-li
Wu said that the Chinese are more
likely to push for accommodation than
rapprochement.
Tremendous increases in Chinese
oil production are creating a need for
more oil refining centers, which
would be "vulnerable to Soviet pres
sure," Wu said.
