# Alumni to visit Indonesian paradise
## 
### 
This autumn, University alumni are
being offered a unique opportunity to enjoy
a luxury liner tour to "the lush and mysteri
ous island-world of the Java Sea," according
to an Alumni Association brochure.
University Prof. Charles Frake will pro
vide lectures on "this enchanting, little
known, and still unspoiled part of the
world." For a mere $2500, the alumni will
stay at "the beautiful Shangri-La Hotel" in
Hong Kong, see native dances, batik fac
tories and museums in Indonesia, and
finish back in Hong Kong for a banquet and
"final exam."
Since the tour has an educational pur
pose, the alumni might want to add a few
other stops to their itinerary.
While in Jakarta, the alumni will quickly
discover the capital's "20 night clubs, a
dozen massage parlors, three gambling
casinos, race-tracks for horses and
greyhounds, a jai alai stadium, and — just a
few miles south of the Equator — an ice
skating rink."
If they go beyond these sights, however,
they may notice another reality, described
by the Wall Street Journal: "Money pours
in, yet it doesn't seem to trickle to the great
masses of people. New skyscrapers dot Jalan
M.H. Thamrin, Jakarta's main street, but
thousands live on garbage dumps scaveng
ing. .. . And frustration builds as the poor
see the terribly rich in their shiny Mercedes
cars, bought — the masses charge — on sto
len money. Corruption is so widespread . . .
that from the very top generals to the low
liest clerk, huge amounts of money are
siphoned off in innumerable ways before
there is a chance for substantial develop
ment."
Amidst the overwhelming poverty, the

alumni may notice many billboards adver
tising the presence of American and
Japanese firms. As the Indonesian consul in
San Francisco, John Senduk,explained re
cently, Indonesia offers tax breaks, mineral
wealth, stability and women who will as
semble electronic goods for 17 cents an
hour.

"The climate for investment is quite
favorable," Senduk explained. "Law and
order prevails in the country."
The chief enforcer of order in Indonesia is
Kopkamtib, the Command for the Preserva
tion of Peace and Security. Highly respected
for its efficiency in arresting and torturing
suspects without respct for legal niceties,
Kopkamtib should keep things quiet for the
University's visitors. Should the alumni
wish to see more of Kopkamtib, they may try
to visit some of the outlying islands, such as
malaria-infested Buru, which the govern
ment has turned into vast prison camps to
isolate some of the survivors of the 1965
military-inspired massacre which killed a
half million suspected communists and
Chinese and brought General Suharto to
power.
These islands, according to TAPOL, the
British Campaign for the Release of Indone

sian Political Prisoners, hold over 70,000
prisoners, almost none of whom have ever
been brought to trial. The U.S. State De
partment considers Indonesia's "slow prog
ress in dealing with this situation" — the
prisoners have been held for over 10 years
— to be "unfortunate but understandable"
in light of the country's many "managerial
and administrative problems."
However, the United States is working to
overcome the military government's inef
ficiencies. Last year about one-fifth of all
foreign military officers trained in the Un
ited States came from Indonesia. The Ford
administration proposed sending Indonesia
$44.9 million in military aid this fiscal year,
more than double the current $20.9 million.
It also hopes to train another 238 officers to
insure the continued readiness of the re
gime to quell domestic disturbances.
To see if U.S aid has been wisely spent,
the alumni might wish to visit the island of
Timor, near the end of the Indonesian ar
chipelago. Formerly a Portuguese colony,
Timor sought its independence last year —
only to be invaded in December by Indone
sian troops at a cost of nearly 60,000 lives.
President Ford conferred with
Suharto regarding Timor shortly before the
invasion, which was made possible by
American-supplied warships. Ford later
expressed general "concern about the use of
violence," but never criticized the Indone
sian take-over.
A word of caution: those alumni who de
viate from the scheduled itinerary may ar
rive at the final Hong Kong banquet with a
queasy stomach.
