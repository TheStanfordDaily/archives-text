Can you find out how I can order a subscription to
"Soldier of Fortune" magazine?-/.8.
After nearly six months of fruitlessly contacting
every magazine circulation company we could
think of, our staff finally located this elusive
periodical in Arvada, Colorado. Since finding it,
we have received subscription blanks, a publicity
blurb for the "charter issue" (spring, 1975) and
several articles on this new publication, by and for
professional mercenaries.
Our staff also talked to Robert K. Brown, the
magazine's publisher and a real-life mercenary
who has at one time or another worked as a n Army
counterintelligence agent, a pro-Castro activist,
an anti-Castro "adviser" and a Green Beret in
Vietnam.
Brown, and his "select" editorial staff
(specialists in the magazine's varied departments,
including "Handguns/Handgun Hunting,"
Sniping/Counter-Sniping," and, more simply,
"Knives") publish four times a year this magazine
dedicated to "professional adventurers."
Of course, as an article in the Chicago Tribune
points out, there really aren't enough mercenaries
around to account for the magazine's 5000 sub
scriptions. Brown assumes that he sells many to
what he calls the "Walter Mitty market"— guys
who are sick of the same old routine and just like
to dream about parachuting into Africa or Angola.
What do these Walter Mittys read about? Well,
recent features have ranged from descriptions of
exotic weapons (including an explosive flour,
nicknamed the "Aunt Jemima," and a crossbow
which fires steel-tipped darts at 180 feet per sec-

ond), to instructions on underwater knife fighting
("grab . . . opponent's hair from behind, then cut
his throat or air hose") to a graphic photo of a
black Rhodesian soldier with a six-inch hole in
his head.
The magazine's advertisements offer its readers
long-awaited opportunities to buy weapons like
the Springfield Armory MIA which kills at 900
meters and is "virtually identical to that used by
the famed U.S. Army snipers in Vietnam," or the
World War I Mark I Trench Knife, complete with
brass knuckles.
Regretfully, Soldier of Fortune is not sold on
newsstands, so that the only w u y you can "zero in
on the action," as they say, is to subscribe. And
you needn't worry about missing the aforemen
tioned articles, since you can start your subscrip
tion with the first issue. If you decide to take the
big step and say "Yes! I want to join the profes
sionals," write to Soldier of Fortune, P.O. Box

we have received subscription blanks, a publicity
blurb for the "charter issue" (spring, 1975) and
several articles on this new publication, by and for
professional mercenaries.
Our staff also talked to Robert K. Brown, the
magazine's publisher and a real-life mercenary
who has at one time or another worked as a n Army
counterintelligence agent, a pro-Castro activist,
an anti-Castro "adviser" and a Green Beret in
Vietnam.
Brown, and his "select" editorial staff
(specialists in the magazine's varied departments,
including "Handguns/Handgun Hunting,"
Sniping/Counter-Sniping," and, more simply,
"Knives") publish four times a year this magazine
dedicated to "professional adventurers."
Of course, as an article in the Chicago Tribune
points out, there really aren't enough mercenaries
around to account for the magazine's 5000 sub
scriptions. Brown assumes that he sells many to
what he calls the "Walter Mitty market"— guys
who are sick of the same old routine and just like
to dream about parachuting into Africa or Angola.
What do these Walter Mittys read about? Well,
recent features have ranged from descriptions of
exotic weapons (including an explosive flour,
nicknamed the "Aunt Jemima," and a crossbow
which fires steel-tipped darts at 180 feet per sec-

ond), to instructions on underwater knife fighting
("grab . . . opponent's hair from behind, then cut
his throat or air hose") to a graphic photo of a
black Rhodesian soldier with a six-inch hole in
his head.
The magazine's advertisements offer its readers
long-awaited opportunities to buy weapons like
the Springfield Armory MIA which kills at 900
meters and is "virtually identical to that used by
the famed U.S. Army snipers in Vietnam," or the
World War I Mark I Trench Knife, complete with
brass knuckles.
Regretfully, Soldier of Fortune is not sold on
newsstands, so that the only w u y you can "zero in
on the action," as they say, is to subscribe. And
you needn't worry about missing the aforemen
tioned articles, since you can start your subscrip
tion with the first issue. If you decide to take the
big step and say "Yes! I want to join the profes
sionals," write to Soldier of Fortune, P.O. Box
693, Boulder, Colorado 80302.
