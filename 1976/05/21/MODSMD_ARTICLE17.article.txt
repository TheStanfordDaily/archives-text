# Ackerman at Lag
## 
### 
Will Ackerman is a building
contractor. His desk "used to be
covered with building plans, but
now it's covered with record
covers," he says.
For Ackerman is also a con
temporary steel guitarist who
writes, plays and records his
own music. He will perform at
8:30 p.m. Saturday on the lawn
immediately west of Lagunita
Court. Admission is free for
those with Stanford identifica
tion.
While he is always "looking
for people who want to build
houses," Ackerman is currently
committed to making people
aware of the many small private
release record companies pro
ducing "a lot of really fine music
that people just don't know a
bout."
His own record, The Search
for the Turtle's Naval, is so far
the sole release of his company,
Windham Hill Records. He
noted that the 2500 copies sold

so far "doesn't sound like any
thing in Elton John standards,"
but adds that "interest in my re
cord is much broader than 1 ever
would have thought."
Ackerman, a Stanford
graduate who lives in Palo Alto,
must distribute, ship and prom
ote his album himself. He has
found particularly receptive
radio stations and audiences in
Seattle, Portland, Denver, Bos
ton and other cities far from the
Bay Area. The mood around
here, he says, "seems to be Top
40."
Ackerman says he has had of
fers to go to major labels, but is
"frankly not interested." He
fears the loss of artistic control
that accompanies a major-label
contract.
Ackerman says he and the ar
tists who record for Arhoolie,
Tacoma and other private re
lease companies are "not mak
ing any money in it."
