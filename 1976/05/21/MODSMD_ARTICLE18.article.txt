# Tom Robbins: the author as cult hero

Tom Robbins' new novel, Even
Cowgirls Get the Blues, is out.
Copies have been strewn visibly
about in the Bookstore. You may
have seen some pitched into the
impulse bins near the cash
registers. On the cover is a picture
of a naked woman astride an air
borne whooping crane against a
backdrop of deep blue sky. But the
book itself never takes to the air.
Robbins' reputation was solidly
established with the success of his
first novel, Another Roadside At
traction, which became an "under
ground bestseller." And deservedly
so, for the book was electrically joy
ous, lyrically sensuous and
psychedelically irreverent.
Though not by any means per
fect, it was nonetheless exciting,
innovative, and showed tremend
ous promise, for Robbins proved
himself to be a gifted magician with
language. He defended the integrity
of the human spirit in a colorfully
hip fashion. He became a novelistic
messiah for the counterculture.
I was excited by Another Road
side Attraction and looked forward
to his next novel. But Robbins' ini
tial promise has failed to bear sub
sequent fruit. Cowgirls is an embar
rassing flop. Two reasons suggest
themselves: Robbins' early acclaim
and the $50,000 advance from his
publishers for Cowgirls rotted his
mind and/or he was simply a "one
book" author unable to mature ar
tistically.
Superficial guesses
These are superficial guesses and
don't mean much. But beneath
them lies a deeper pattern which
cries for recognition, one we should

recognize: the corruption of artistic
talent by the mass-mindlessness of
an undiscriminating and uncritical
public.
Robbins has been fashioned by
the media and the acclaim of his
young and enthusiastic followers
into a cult hero. There is no impetus
for improvement as long as the
royalties and the fan-letters keep
pouring in.
Even Cowgirls Get the Blues is
the story of Sissy Hankshaw, a
glamorous model for a line of
feminine hygiene products. Sissy is
sensitive and has abnormally large
thumbs. These thumbs make her
"different," and turn her into a
compulsive hitchhiker with a deep
spiritual problem. How to deal with
society's reaction to her thumbs?
How to deal with all the people who
want to get into her panties? How to
find truth and beauty in a Buick
Roadmaster?
This is silly stuff, but Robbins
foolishly persists in trying to make
it serious: "nothing happened to
her 'cause she just kept moving."
Her adventures
Sissy's adventures take place
around the Rubber Rose Ranch,
named after a douche product. The
Ranch has been taken over by some
nubile, rebellious cowgirls who
spend a great deal of time fingering
each other, shouting "yippee!" and
getting into heavy raps about wo
men's liberation.
Robbins' concept of female
emancipation is discomfiting. He
occasionally uses the clitoris, like
Sissy's thumbs, for short flights of
inspired verbiage, but mostly he
prefers to indulge himself in voy
euristic fantasies, imagining the
graphics of hot chicksgetting-it-on
together beneath the North Dakota
skv. There is no substance to Rob

bins' comic vision; his is a world of
smiling, laughing dullness.
Robbins' cowgirls are (he one
dimensional descendants of car
toonist R. Crumb's Honeybunch
kaminski, "the Drug-Crazed
Runaway." Cowgirls is little more
than comic-strip art bloated into a
fictional format. The book is de
signed for folks who like to get high
and avoid "hassles." If you enjoy
hearing John Denver say "far out.
man!" between songs, Cowgirls
may be for you. If you wince at the
mere thought of a John Denver con
cert, you won't likely relish Rob
bins.
But Cowgirls has more to offer

than Sissy's big thumbs. Robbins
enriches his broth with a good dash
of religious mysticism by means of
such characters as "the Chink," a
caricature of a Zen wildmanyguru
who lives above the Rubber Rose
Ranch and operates "the
Clockworks."
Needless to say, "the
Clockworks" is meant to be heavily
metaphorical and mysteriously
metaphysical. But it isn't. "The
Chink" and his Clockworks resem
ble Richard Brautigan's monster
and "chemicals" in The Hawkline
Monster. Both authors use gim
micks to avoid rather than confront
serious problems such as despair,

alienation, sexual frustration, root
lessness, etc.
These are authors who verbally
fiddle while Rome burns: their fic
tional worlds offer the contentment
of a childish fairyland, the warm
grooviness of a good joint and
somethin' lovin' from the oven.
And their art reflects the slackness
of such laid-back philosophies.
1 am angry because 1 expected
more from Robbins. He might rival
Thomas Pynchon if he could grow
out of his puerile "mellowness," if
he would make an effort to exercise
his judgment and discipline his ta
lents.

But he boasts of the fact that he
doesn't rewrite his material. And it
shows. Truman Capote's remark
about Kerouac's writing habits
applies equally to Robbins': "that's
not writing, that's typing."
Robbins writes with the same ar
rogant carelessness which charac
terizes Fatti Smith's singing: it is
the "1 can do nothing wrong be
cause my audience has made me a
god" syndrome. It is pathetic to see
genuine talent squandering itself
this way, rotting in the warmth of
vapid adulation.
If for little else, Robbins deserves
to be praised for his ever-present
mastery of the unexpected simile.

He can describe a summer day in
Richmond, Va.: "Middays, the city
felt like the inside of a napalmed
watermelon."
But Cowgirls as a whole is
clumsy, uneven and amateurish; it
lacks tension and dramatic interest.
It is filled with egotistical asides
which resemble the "raps" that sin
gers dish out between songs.
Sample
Here is a sample of a Robbins rap:
"Well, here we are at Chapter 100.
This calls for a celebration. I am an
author and therefore in the same
business Cod is in: if 1 say this page
is a bottle of champagne, it is a bot
tle of champagne. Reader, will you
share a cup of a bubbly with me?
You prefer French to domestic?
Okay, I'll make it French. Cheers!"
Cheers yourself, Tom! Robbins
may have had in mind the splendid
authorial asides of such authors as
William Thackeray or George Kliot.
But they at least credited their read
ers with a modicum of intelligence
and discernment. Robbins has a
smug confidence of knowing his
readers will lap up anything he
throws-up.
Alexander Pope was not, like
Robbins, a "nice guy." There is
good reason to believe he was some
thing of an obnoxious little runt.
But he just happened to be a genius
as well and worked diligently to
perfect his writing style, Pope cor
rectly observed.
"True ease in writing comes
from art, not chance.
"As those move easiest who
have learned to dance."
Robbins remains a young author
with potential, though for now he
seems content with shuffling his
feet. I hope he learns to dance.

don't mean much. But beneath
them lies a deeper pattern which
cries for recognition, one we should

recognize: the corruption of artistic
talent by the mass-mindlessness of
an undiscriminating and uncritical
public.
Robbins has been fashioned by
the media and the acclaim of his
young and enthusiastic followers
into a cult hero. There is no impetus
for improvement as long as the
royalties and the fan-letters keep
pouring in.
Even Cowgirls Get the Blues is
the story of Sissy Hankshaw, a
glamorous model for a line of
feminine hygiene products. Sissy is
sensitive and has abnormally large
thumbs. These thumbs make her
"different," and turn her into a
compulsive hitchhiker with a deep
spiritual problem. How to deal with
society's reaction to her thumbs?
How to deal with all the people who
want to get into her panties? How to
find truth and beauty in a Buick
Roadmaster?
This is silly stuff, but Robbins
foolishly persists in trying to make
it serious: "nothing happened to
her 'cause she just kept moving."
Her adventures
Sissy's adventures take place
around the Rubber Rose Ranch,
named after a douche product. The
Ranch has been taken over by some
nubile, rebellious cowgirls who
spend a great deal of time fingering
each other, shouting "yippee!" and
getting into heavy raps about wo
men's liberation.
Robbins' concept of female
emancipation is discomfiting. He
occasionally uses the clitoris, like
Sissy's thumbs, for short flights of
inspired verbiage, but mostly he
prefers to indulge himself in voy
euristic fantasies, imagining the
graphics of hot chicksgetting-it-on
together beneath the North Dakota
skv. There is no substance to Rob

bins' comic vision; his is a world of
smiling, laughing dullness.
Robbins' cowgirls are (he one
dimensional descendants of car
toonist R. Crumb's Honeybunch
kaminski, "the Drug-Crazed
Runaway." Cowgirls is little more
than comic-strip art bloated into a
fictional format. The book is de
signed for folks who like to get high
and avoid "hassles." If you enjoy
hearing John Denver say "far out.
man!" between songs, Cowgirls
may be for you. If you wince at the
mere thought of a John Denver con
cert, you won't likely relish Rob
bins.
But Cowgirls has more to offer

than Sissy's big thumbs. Robbins
enriches his broth with a good dash
of religious mysticism by means of
such characters as "the Chink," a
caricature of a Zen wildmanyguru
who lives above the Rubber Rose
Ranch and operates "the
Clockworks."
Needless to say, "the
Clockworks" is meant to be heavily
metaphorical and mysteriously
metaphysical. But it isn't. "The
Chink" and his Clockworks resem
ble Richard Brautigan's monster
and "chemicals" in The Hawkline
Monster. Both authors use gim
micks to avoid rather than confront
serious problems such as despair,

alienation, sexual frustration, root
lessness, etc.
These are authors who verbally
fiddle while Rome burns: their fic
tional worlds offer the contentment
of a childish fairyland, the warm
grooviness of a good joint and
somethin' lovin' from the oven.
And their art reflects the slackness
of such laid-back philosophies.
1 am angry because 1 expected
more from Robbins. He might rival
Thomas Pynchon if he could grow
out of his puerile "mellowness," if
he would make an effort to exercise
his judgment and discipline his ta
lents.

But he boasts of the fact that he
doesn't rewrite his material. And it
shows. Truman Capote's remark
about Kerouac's writing habits
applies equally to Robbins': "that's
not writing, that's typing."
Robbins writes with the same ar
rogant carelessness which charac
terizes Fatti Smith's singing: it is
the "1 can do nothing wrong be
cause my audience has made me a
god" syndrome. It is pathetic to see
genuine talent squandering itself
this way, rotting in the warmth of
vapid adulation.
If for little else, Robbins deserves
to be praised for his ever-present
mastery of the unexpected simile.

He can describe a summer day in
Richmond, Va.: "Middays, the city
felt like the inside of a napalmed
watermelon."
But Cowgirls as a whole is
clumsy, uneven and amateurish; it
lacks tension and dramatic interest.
It is filled with egotistical asides
which resemble the "raps" that sin
gers dish out between songs.
Sample
Here is a sample of a Robbins rap:
"Well, here we are at Chapter 100.
This calls for a celebration. I am an
author and therefore in the same
business Cod is in: if 1 say this page
is a bottle of champagne, it is a bot
tle of champagne. Reader, will you
share a cup of a bubbly with me?
You prefer French to domestic?
Okay, I'll make it French. Cheers!"
Cheers yourself, Tom! Robbins
may have had in mind the splendid
authorial asides of such authors as
William Thackeray or George Kliot.
But they at least credited their read
ers with a modicum of intelligence
and discernment. Robbins has a
smug confidence of knowing his
readers will lap up anything he
throws-up.
Alexander Pope was not, like
Robbins, a "nice guy." There is
good reason to believe he was some
thing of an obnoxious little runt.
But he just happened to be a genius
as well and worked diligently to
perfect his writing style, Pope cor
rectly observed.
"True ease in writing comes
from art, not chance.
"As those move easiest who
have learned to dance."
Robbins remains a young author
with potential, though for now he
seems content with shuffling his
feet. I hope he learns to dance.

Tom Robbins' new novel, Even
Cowgirls Get the Blues, is out.
Copies have been strewn visibly
about in the Bookstore. You may
have seen some pitched into the
impulse bins near the cash
registers. On the cover is a picture
of a naked woman astride an air
borne whooping crane against a
backdrop of deep blue sky. But the
book itself never takes to the air.
Robbins' reputation was solidly
established with the success of his
first novel, Another Roadside At
traction, which became an "under
ground bestseller." And deservedly
so, for the book was electrically joy
ous, lyrically sensuous and
psychedelically irreverent.
Though not by any means per
fect, it was nonetheless exciting,
innovative, and showed tremend
ous promise, for Robbins proved
himself to be a gifted magician with
language. He defended the integrity
of the human spirit in a colorfully
hip fashion. He became a novelistic
messiah for the counterculture.
I was excited by Another Road
side Attraction and looked forward
to his next novel. But Robbins' ini
tial promise has failed to bear sub
sequent fruit. Cowgirls is an embar
rassing flop. Two reasons suggest
themselves: Robbins' early acclaim
and the $50,000 advance from his
publishers for Cowgirls rotted his

Robbins' cowgirls are (he one

may be for you. If you wince at the

cert, you won't likely relish Rob
bins.
But Cowgirls has more to offer

than Sissy's big thumbs. Robbins
enriches his broth with a good dash
of religious mysticism by means of
such characters as "the Chink," a
caricature of a Zen wildmanyguru
who lives above the Rubber Rose
Ranch and operates "the
Clockworks."
Needless to say, "the
Clockworks" is meant to be heavily
metaphorical and mysteriously
metaphysical. But it isn't. "The
Chink" and his Clockworks resem
ble Richard Brautigan's monster
and "chemicals" in The Hawkline
Monster. Both authors use gim
micks to avoid rather than confront
serious problems such as despair,

alienation, sexual frustration, root
lessness, etc.
These are authors who verbally
fiddle while Rome burns: their fic
tional worlds offer the contentment
of a childish fairyland, the warm
grooviness of a good joint and
somethin' lovin' from the oven.
And their art reflects the slackness
of such laid-back philosophies.
1 am angry because 1 expected
more from Robbins. He might rival
Thomas Pynchon if he could grow
out of his puerile "mellowness," if
he would make an effort to exercise
his judgment and discipline his ta
lents.

But he boasts of the fact that he
doesn't rewrite his material. And it
shows. Truman Capote's remark
about Kerouac's writing habits
applies equally to Robbins': "that's
not writing, that's typing."
Robbins writes with the same ar
rogant carelessness which charac
terizes Fatti Smith's singing: it is
the "1 can do nothing wrong be
cause my audience has made me a
god" syndrome. It is pathetic to see
genuine talent squandering itself
this way, rotting in the warmth of
vapid adulation.
If for little else, Robbins deserves
to be praised for his ever-present
mastery of the unexpected simile.

He can describe a summer day in
Richmond, Va.: "Middays, the city
felt like the inside of a napalmed
watermelon."
But Cowgirls as a whole is
clumsy, uneven and amateurish; it
lacks tension and dramatic interest.
It is filled with egotistical asides
which resemble the "raps" that sin
gers dish out between songs.
Sample
Here is a sample of a Robbins rap:
"Well, here we are at Chapter 100.
This calls for a celebration. I am an
author and therefore in the same
business Cod is in: if 1 say this page
is a bottle of champagne, it is a bot
tle of champagne. Reader, will you
share a cup of a bubbly with me?
You prefer French to domestic?
Okay, I'll make it French. Cheers!"
Cheers yourself, Tom! Robbins
may have had in mind the splendid
authorial asides of such authors as
William Thackeray or George Kliot.
But they at least credited their read
ers with a modicum of intelligence
and discernment. Robbins has a
smug confidence of knowing his
readers will lap up anything he
throws-up.
Alexander Pope was not, like
Robbins, a "nice guy." There is
good reason to believe he was some
thing of an obnoxious little runt.
But he just happened to be a genius
as well and worked diligently to
perfect his writing style, Pope cor
rectly observed.
"True ease in writing comes
from art, not chance.
"As those move easiest who
have learned to dance."
Robbins remains a young author
with potential, though for now he
seems content with shuffling his
feet. I hope he learns to dance.

Reviewed by Steven E. Olson
Tom Robbins' new novel, Even
Cowgirls Get the Blues, is out.
Copies have been strewn visibly
about in the Bookstore. You may
have seen some pitched into the
impulse bins near the cash
registers. On the cover is a picture
of a naked woman astride an air
borne whooping crane against a
backdrop of deep blue sky. But the
book itself never takes to the air.
Robbins' reputation was solidly
established with the success of his
first novel, Another Roadside At
traction, which became an "under
ground bestseller." And deservedly
so, for the book was electrically joy
ous, lyrically sensuous and
psychedelically irreverent.
Though not by any means per
fect, it was nonetheless exciting,
innovative, and showed tremend
ous promise, for Robbins proved
himself to be a gifted magician with
language. He defended the integrity
of the human spirit in a colorfully
hip fashion. He became a novelistic
messiah for the counterculture.
I was excited by Another Road
side Attraction and looked forward
to his next novel. But Robbins' ini
tial promise has failed to bear sub
sequent fruit. Cowgirls is an embar
rassing flop. Two reasons suggest
themselves: Robbins' early acclaim
and the $50,000 advance from his
publishers for Cowgirls rotted his
mind and/or he was simply a "one
book" author unable to mature ar
tistically.
Superficial guesses
These are superficial guesses and
don't mean much. But beneath
them lies a deeper pattern which
cries for recognition, one we should

recognize: the corruption of artistic
talent by the mass-mindlessness of
an undiscriminating and uncritical
public.
Robbins has been fashioned by
the media and the acclaim of his
young and enthusiastic followers
into a cult hero. There is no impetus
for improvement as long as the
royalties and the fan-letters keep
pouring in.
Even Cowgirls Get the Blues is
the story of Sissy Hankshaw, a
glamorous model for a line of
feminine hygiene products. Sissy is
sensitive and has abnormally large
thumbs. These thumbs make her
"different," and turn her into a
compulsive hitchhiker with a deep
spiritual problem. How to deal with
society's reaction to her thumbs?
How to deal with all the people who
want to get into her panties? How to
find truth and beauty in a Buick
Roadmaster?
This is silly stuff, but Robbins
foolishly persists in trying to make
it serious: "nothing happened to
her 'cause she just kept moving."
Her adventures
Sissy's adventures take place
around the Rubber Rose Ranch,
named after a douche product. The
Ranch has been taken over by some
nubile, rebellious cowgirls who
spend a great deal of time fingering
each other, shouting "yippee!" and
getting into heavy raps about wo
men's liberation.
Robbins' concept of female
emancipation is discomfiting. He
occasionally uses the clitoris, like
Sissy's thumbs, for short flights of
inspired verbiage, but mostly he
prefers to indulge himself in voy
euristic fantasies, imagining the

grooviness of a good joint and
somethin' lovin' from the oven.
And their art reflects the slackness
of such laid-back philosophies.
1 am angry because 1 expected
more from Robbins. He might rival
Thomas Pynchon if he could grow
out of his puerile "mellowness," if
he would make an effort to exercise
his judgment and discipline his ta
lents.

But he boasts of the fact that he
doesn't rewrite his material. And it
shows. Truman Capote's remark
about Kerouac's writing habits
applies equally to Robbins': "that's
not writing, that's typing."
Robbins writes with the same ar
rogant carelessness which charac
terizes Fatti Smith's singing: it is
the "1 can do nothing wrong be
cause my audience has made me a
god" syndrome. It is pathetic to see
genuine talent squandering itself
this way, rotting in the warmth of
vapid adulation.
If for little else, Robbins deserves
to be praised for his ever-present
mastery of the unexpected simile.

He can describe a summer day in
Richmond, Va.: "Middays, the city
felt like the inside of a napalmed
watermelon."
But Cowgirls as a whole is
clumsy, uneven and amateurish; it
lacks tension and dramatic interest.
It is filled with egotistical asides
which resemble the "raps" that sin
gers dish out between songs.
Sample
Here is a sample of a Robbins rap:
"Well, here we are at Chapter 100.
This calls for a celebration. I am an
author and therefore in the same
business Cod is in: if 1 say this page
is a bottle of champagne, it is a bot
tle of champagne. Reader, will you
share a cup of a bubbly with me?
You prefer French to domestic?
Okay, I'll make it French. Cheers!"
Cheers yourself, Tom! Robbins
may have had in mind the splendid
authorial asides of such authors as
William Thackeray or George Kliot.
But they at least credited their read
ers with a modicum of intelligence
and discernment. Robbins has a
smug confidence of knowing his
readers will lap up anything he
throws-up.
Alexander Pope was not, like
Robbins, a "nice guy." There is
good reason to believe he was some
thing of an obnoxious little runt.
But he just happened to be a genius
as well and worked diligently to
perfect his writing style, Pope cor
rectly observed.
"True ease in writing comes
from art, not chance.
"As those move easiest who
have learned to dance."
Robbins remains a young author
with potential, though for now he
seems content with shuffling his
feet. I hope he learns to dance.
