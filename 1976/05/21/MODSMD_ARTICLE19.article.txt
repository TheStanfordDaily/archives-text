The Modernization of Sex, by
Paul Robinson. Harper 8- Row,
.68.95.
Reviewed by George Powell
It used to be, in the Victorian
dark ages of sex, that everyone
was doing sex, but nobody was
talking about it. Then along
came the sexual modernists, and
the talking and theorizing began
to catch up with the act itself.
But only lately has there been
any serious effort at actually
measuring what goes on bet
ween the sheets. This measuring
effort, by the well-known Wil
liam Masters and Virginia
has been the physiolog
ical capstone of the movement
away from Victorianism and to
ward sexual modernism.
Hence The Modernization of
Sex, by Stanford history profes
sor Paul Robinson, a slim vol
ume that attempts to trace the
intellectual history of the mod
ernization process by examining
the work of three giants in the
field.

Robinson selects Havelock El
lis, Alfred Kinsey and the
aforementioned Masters and
Johnson as the three theorists to
be treated, but because Sigmund
Freud had so much to say about
sex, Robinson is forced to spend
some time comparing the three
sets of ideas to Freud's well
known thoughts on the subject.
The problem with writing
about sex used to be overcoming
the very idea that sex was a
proper matter for discussion —
the left over of a Victorianism
that wanted to keep a discussion
of private parts so private that
the owner didn't even know pre
cisely what was going on.
But now, ever since Masters
and Johnson published Human
Sexual Response, in 1966, there
has been a virtual flood of books
about technique, gourmet
guides to love making, show and
tell,ad infinitum. EventheDaily
has succumbed to the informa
tional pressures, and provides a
sex column for its readers.
So what does The Moderniza

tion of Sex do in the midst of this
informational explosion? It adds
a reasoned, scholarly tone to
what is fast becoming a treat
ment of sex everywhere that
reads like a technical manual for
the starship Enterprise. Today's
literature seems either like that
or the pure erotic fantasy of a
Penthouse magazine (or on a
baser level. Hustler).
Between "placing the female
partner's thumb on the fre
nulum" and"he slammed his
rock-hard pole into her steam
ing, juicy twat" must be a reflec
tive space for examining who
brought us to this particular
point in time. Robinson's book
provides such a space, by care
fully analyzing the major works
of all three sex experts, and con
trasting their ideas with the now
completely discredited Vic
torianism and the Romantic
tradition, which may be making
a comeback of sorts vis the com
mittmentless fucking of the late
19605.
If readers aren't fazed by a few

hundred footnotes and a dry
writing style (that does have
some moments of dry humor) the
book is an excellent overview of
the work of the main sexual
theorists of the 20th century, as
wel 1 as a reasoned critique of the
positions (intellectually) they
have taken.

provides such a space, by care
fully analyzing the major works
of all three sex experts, and con
trasting their ideas with the now
completely discredited Vic
torianism and the Romantic
tradition, which may be making
a comeback of sorts vis the com
mittmentless fucking of the late
19605.
If readers aren't fazed by a few

hundred footnotes and a dry
writing style (that does have
some moments of dry humor) the
book is an excellent overview of
the work of the main sexual
theorists of the 20th century, as
wel 1 as a reasoned critique of the
positions (intellectually) they
have taken.

The Modernization of Sex, by
Paul Robinson. Harper 8- Row,
.68.95.
Reviewed by George Powell
It used to be, in the Victorian
dark ages of sex, that everyone
was doing sex, but nobody was
talking about it. Then along
came the sexual modernists, and
the talking and theorizing began
to catch up with the act itself.
But only lately has there been
any serious effort at actually
measuring what goes on bet
ween the sheets. This measuring
effort, by the well-known Wil
liam Masters and Virginia
has been the physiolog
ical capstone of the movement
away from Victorianism and to
ward sexual modernism.
Hence The Modernization of
Sex, by Stanford history profes
sor Paul Robinson, a slim vol
ume that attempts to trace the
intellectual history of the mod
ernization process by examining
the work of three giants in the
field.

Robinson selects Havelock El
lis, Alfred Kinsey and the
aforementioned Masters and
Johnson as the three theorists to
be treated, but because Sigmund
Freud had so much to say about
sex, Robinson is forced to spend
some time comparing the three
sets of ideas to Freud's well
known thoughts on the subject.
The problem with writing
about sex used to be overcoming
the very idea that sex was a
proper matter for discussion —
the left over of a Victorianism
that wanted to keep a discussion
of private parts so private that
the owner didn't even know pre
cisely what was going on.
But now, ever since Masters
and Johnson published Human
Sexual Response, in 1966, there
has been a virtual flood of books
about technique, gourmet
guides to love making, show and
tell,ad infinitum. EventheDaily
has succumbed to the informa
tional pressures, and provides a
sex column for its readers.
So what does The Moderniza

tion of Sex do in the midst of this
informational explosion? It adds
a reasoned, scholarly tone to
what is fast becoming a treat
ment of sex everywhere that
reads like a technical manual for
the starship Enterprise. Today's
literature seems either like that
or the pure erotic fantasy of a
Penthouse magazine (or on a
baser level. Hustler).
Between "placing the female
partner's thumb on the fre
nulum" and"he slammed his
rock-hard pole into her steam
ing, juicy twat" must be a reflec
tive space for examining who
brought us to this particular
point in time. Robinson's book
provides such a space, by care
fully analyzing the major works
of all three sex experts, and con
trasting their ideas with the now

torianism and the Romantic
