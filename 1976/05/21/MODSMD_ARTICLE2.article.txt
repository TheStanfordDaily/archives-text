# Biologist merges research with firm stand on environment

### Janice Bressler 
As he hunches over a microscope in his lab, dissecting
butterfly genitalia, Paul Ehrlich. the tall, lanky biology
professor, seems the epitome of the dispassionate scientist
— immersed in his research, isolated from the noisy polit
ical and social battles of the outside world.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
With the publication in 1967 of his book The Popula
tion Bomb, which warned that the world was threatening
to breed itself into oblivion. Ehrlich was thrust into the
public scene. Since then he has become a leading figure in
the international crusade for population control and a
passionate spokesman for environmental action.
Father of the Zero Population Growth organization,
Ehrlich has seen tremendous progress towards that
movement's goal: since Population Bomb the U.S. fertility
rate has almost dropped to the point at which each genera
tion just replaces itself.
Recently, two other key threats, the country's reliance
on "faulty technology" and the "environmental degra
dation " embedded in the American way of life, have been
the targets of Ehrlich's vigorous criticism.
Frighteningly erergetic
Described by one secretary as "frighteningly energetic,"
Ehrlich, with his treble role of researcher, professor and
public defender of the environment, is almost impossible
to catch.
This reporter was lucky enough to corner him in his lab
where, although he continued with routine butterfly dis
sections at his microscope, he was willing and eager to
talk.
"Every loud-mouthed professor likes the chance to
spread his views around to more people." he joked.
The most critical environmental battle at this moment,
in Ehrlich's view, is the fight to stop the spread of nuclear
power plants. Because of "catastrophic risks" that include
genetic damage caused by radiation and nuclear arms
proliferation. Ehrlich said that he is convinced that the
unrestrained development of the nuclear reactor industry
"endangers the health and safety not only of America but
of the entire planet, for many future generations."
His rumbling baritone became vehement on the subject
of "the nuclear power establishment." which he charged
"is laced through and through with incompetence."
'Marvelous' computers
Asked about his confidence in the people who build
nuclear reactors, Ehrlich replied wryly, "Westinghouse,
one of the main manufacturers of reactors in this country,
is the same corporation that brought us those marvelous,
fail-safe computers that run BART (Bay Area Rapid
Transit)."

There are a number of "truly brilliant technologists" in
the nuclear industry who, according toEhrlich,"are bur
dened by guilt complexes from having worked on the
atomic bomb and are determined to salvage nuclear
technology by finding peaceful uses for it."
Brandishing his dissecting knife in the air, as if to chal
lenge some invisible nuclear proponent, Ehrlich stresses
that the relatively short history of the nuclear industry has
already included some frightening "near-catastrophes."
"In a fast-breeder reactor near Detroit," Ehrlich said,
"there was an accident that almost destroyed the city,
caused by someone adding a piece of metal to the design
without putting it on the plans. And that's the kind of
accident their fantastic safety record is full of."
Blind faith
Ehrlich said he believes that it is imperative for Ameri
cans to stop placing "blind faith" in science and start
looking critically at any technology proclaimed to be
catastrophe-proof.
"With all the risks involved, no one in his right mind
could advocate nuclear energy if we don't need it,"he
said, adding, "We don't need it."
Ehrlich criticized the utilities' claim that the American
standard of living would drop if nuclear power plant
development were curtailed.
"We do not even need the amount of energy per person
we are using today to maintain what most people think of
as our present standard of living," he insisted.
He noted a recent UC-Berkeley study which showed
that Sweden, which has a standard of living comparable to
that of this country, uses only 65 percent of the energy
used by the U.S.
Energy wasters
Ehrlich's diagnosis of the energy crisis is that Ameri
cans are "energy wasters." The cure, he said, is to elimi
nate energy waste or reduce it.
He argued that the quality of life in America could be
improved while energy is saved by halting the search for
new, complex technologies to solve the country's prob
lems. Existing technologies could be used more crea
tively, he said.
A corollary of America's blind faith in technology is the
"myth that scientists and bureaucrats have some kind of
expertise or wisdom for making society's decisions.
"That's bullshit," he commented.
He was equally skeptical of the nuclear experts' claim
that the nuclear power issue is too complex for lay people
to understand.
"The basic issues in the nuclear power controversy can
be understood by a high school student in a few hours," he
politician."
She said that the Republican party
must begin asserting itself with rep
resentatives such as her father, and
that the United States must also move
up from the "number two" position in
terms of national military defense.
"We must keep our friends, hope
fully intimidate our enemies and keep
the peace," she said, warning that "the
OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Ex
porting Countries) nations will have
the most economic control of the
Western world" during the next 25
years.

dates' Friends," was sponsored by the
Stanford Committee on Political Edu
cation (SCOPE).

to breed itself into oblivion. Ehrlich was thrust into the
public scene. Since then he has become a leading figure in
the international crusade for population control and a
passionate spokesman for environmental action.
Father of the Zero Population Growth organization,
Ehrlich has seen tremendous progress towards that
movement's goal: since Population Bomb the U.S. fertility
rate has almost dropped to the point at which each genera
tion just replaces itself.
Recently, two other key threats, the country's reliance
on "faulty technology" and the "environmental degra
dation " embedded in the American way of life, have been
the targets of Ehrlich's vigorous criticism.
Frighteningly erergetic
Described by one secretary as "frighteningly energetic,"
Ehrlich, with his treble role of researcher, professor and
public defender of the environment, is almost impossible
to catch.
This reporter was lucky enough to corner him in his lab
where, although he continued with routine butterfly dis
sections at his microscope, he was willing and eager to
talk.
"Every loud-mouthed professor likes the chance to
spread his views around to more people." he joked.
The most critical environmental battle at this moment,
in Ehrlich's view, is the fight to stop the spread of nuclear
power plants. Because of "catastrophic risks" that include
genetic damage caused by radiation and nuclear arms
proliferation. Ehrlich said that he is convinced that the
unrestrained development of the nuclear reactor industry
"endangers the health and safety not only of America but
of the entire planet, for many future generations."
His rumbling baritone became vehement on the subject
of "the nuclear power establishment." which he charged
"is laced through and through with incompetence."
'Marvelous' computers
Asked about his confidence in the people who build
nuclear reactors, Ehrlich replied wryly, "Westinghouse,
one of the main manufacturers of reactors in this country,
is the same corporation that brought us those marvelous,
fail-safe computers that run BART (Bay Area Rapid
Transit)."

There are a number of "truly brilliant technologists" in
the nuclear industry who, according toEhrlich,"are bur
dened by guilt complexes from having worked on the
atomic bomb and are determined to salvage nuclear
technology by finding peaceful uses for it."
Brandishing his dissecting knife in the air, as if to chal
lenge some invisible nuclear proponent, Ehrlich stresses
that the relatively short history of the nuclear industry has
already included some frightening "near-catastrophes."
"In a fast-breeder reactor near Detroit," Ehrlich said,
"there was an accident that almost destroyed the city,
caused by someone adding a piece of metal to the design
without putting it on the plans. And that's the kind of
accident their fantastic safety record is full of."
Blind faith
Ehrlich said he believes that it is imperative for Ameri
cans to stop placing "blind faith" in science and start
looking critically at any technology proclaimed to be
catastrophe-proof.
"With all the risks involved, no one in his right mind
could advocate nuclear energy if we don't need it,"he
said, adding, "We don't need it."
Ehrlich criticized the utilities' claim that the American
standard of living would drop if nuclear power plant
development were curtailed.
"We do not even need the amount of energy per person
we are using today to maintain what most people think of
as our present standard of living," he insisted.
He noted a recent UC-Berkeley study which showed
that Sweden, which has a standard of living comparable to
that of this country, uses only 65 percent of the energy
used by the U.S.
Energy wasters
Ehrlich's diagnosis of the energy crisis is that Ameri
cans are "energy wasters." The cure, he said, is to elimi
nate energy waste or reduce it.
He argued that the quality of life in America could be
improved while energy is saved by halting the search for
new, complex technologies to solve the country's prob
lems. Existing technologies could be used more crea
tively, he said.
A corollary of America's blind faith in technology is the
"myth that scientists and bureaucrats have some kind of
expertise or wisdom for making society's decisions.
"That's bullshit," he commented.
He was equally skeptical of the nuclear experts' claim
that the nuclear power issue is too complex for lay people
to understand.
"The basic issues in the nuclear power controversy can
be understood by a high school student in a few hours," he
politician."
She said that the Republican party
must begin asserting itself with rep
resentatives such as her father, and
that the United States must also move
up from the "number two" position in
terms of national military defense.
"We must keep our friends, hope
fully intimidate our enemies and keep
the peace," she said, warning that "the
OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Ex
porting Countries) nations will have
the most economic control of the
Western world" during the next 25
years.

Stanford Committee on Political Edu

butterfly genitalia, Paul Ehrlich. the tall, lanky biology
professor, seems the epitome of the dispassionate scientist
— immersed in his research, isolated from the noisy polit
ical and social battles of the outside world.
Nothing could be further from the truth.

Recently, two other key threats, the country's reliance
on "faulty technology" and the "environmental degra
dation " embedded in the American way of life, have been
the targets of Ehrlich's vigorous criticism.
Frighteningly erergetic
Described by one secretary as "frighteningly energetic,"
Ehrlich, with his treble role of researcher, professor and
public defender of the environment, is almost impossible
to catch.
This reporter was lucky enough to corner him in his lab
where, although he continued with routine butterfly dis
sections at his microscope, he was willing and eager to
talk.
"Every loud-mouthed professor likes the chance to
spread his views around to more people." he joked.
The most critical environmental battle at this moment,
in Ehrlich's view, is the fight to stop the spread of nuclear
power plants. Because of "catastrophic risks" that include
genetic damage caused by radiation and nuclear arms
proliferation. Ehrlich said that he is convinced that the
unrestrained development of the nuclear reactor industry
"endangers the health and safety not only of America but
of the entire planet, for many future generations."
His rumbling baritone became vehement on the subject
of "the nuclear power establishment." which he charged
"is laced through and through with incompetence."
'Marvelous' computers
Asked about his confidence in the people who build
nuclear reactors, Ehrlich replied wryly, "Westinghouse,
one of the main manufacturers of reactors in this country,
is the same corporation that brought us those marvelous,
fail-safe computers that run BART (Bay Area Rapid
Transit)."

There are a number of "truly brilliant technologists" in
the nuclear industry who, according toEhrlich,"are bur
dened by guilt complexes from having worked on the
atomic bomb and are determined to salvage nuclear
technology by finding peaceful uses for it."
Brandishing his dissecting knife in the air, as if to chal
lenge some invisible nuclear proponent, Ehrlich stresses
that the relatively short history of the nuclear industry has
already included some frightening "near-catastrophes."
"In a fast-breeder reactor near Detroit," Ehrlich said,
"there was an accident that almost destroyed the city,
caused by someone adding a piece of metal to the design
without putting it on the plans. And that's the kind of
accident their fantastic safety record is full of."
Blind faith
Ehrlich said he believes that it is imperative for Ameri
cans to stop placing "blind faith" in science and start
looking critically at any technology proclaimed to be
catastrophe-proof.
"With all the risks involved, no one in his right mind
could advocate nuclear energy if we don't need it,"he
said, adding, "We don't need it."
Ehrlich criticized the utilities' claim that the American
standard of living would drop if nuclear power plant
development were curtailed.
"We do not even need the amount of energy per person
we are using today to maintain what most people think of
as our present standard of living," he insisted.
He noted a recent UC-Berkeley study which showed
that Sweden, which has a standard of living comparable to
that of this country, uses only 65 percent of the energy
used by the U.S.
Energy wasters
Ehrlich's diagnosis of the energy crisis is that Ameri
cans are "energy wasters." The cure, he said, is to elimi
nate energy waste or reduce it.
He argued that the quality of life in America could be
improved while energy is saved by halting the search for
new, complex technologies to solve the country's prob
lems. Existing technologies could be used more crea
tively, he said.
A corollary of America's blind faith in technology is the
"myth that scientists and bureaucrats have some kind of
expertise or wisdom for making society's decisions.
"That's bullshit," he commented.
He was equally skeptical of the nuclear experts' claim
that the nuclear power issue is too complex for lay people
to understand.
"The basic issues in the nuclear power controversy can
be understood by a high school student in a few hours," he
politician."
She said that the Republican party
must begin asserting itself with rep
resentatives such as her father, and
that the United States must also move
up from the "number two" position in
terms of national military defense.
"We must keep our friends, hope
fully intimidate our enemies and keep
the peace," she said, warning that "the
OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Ex
porting Countries) nations will have
the most economic control of the
Western world" during the next 25
years.
The forum, called "All the Candi
dates' Friends," was sponsored by the
Stanford Committee on Political Edu
cation (SCOPE).
