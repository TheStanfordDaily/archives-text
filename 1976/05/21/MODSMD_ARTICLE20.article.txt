What Does WoMan (i.e. Humanity)
Want? is Timothy Leary's latest
autobiographical-philosophical "transmis
sion" to earthlings still stuck in the "larval
stags" of impending metamorphosis. It is
the story, cleverly and comically relayed, of
his own evolution towards higher
neurosomatic and energetic intelligence.
He himself "mutates," and undertakes a
Mutation mission primarly concerned with
tne first, "Five-Brained" evolutionary step
— getting individuals to think for them
selves.
In his "science-faction," Leary is the Out
law Agent from T.I.M.E. assigned to "find
the encoded secret that the dying planet
hungers for" — the solution to the enigma
ic "S.M.I. 2 L.E."
His mutation signal is predominantly
sexual ("There's no social unit as powerful
as a couple, sexually secure and erotically
in tune. . ."), but it is constantly being
short-circuited by humanoid insistence on
knowing nothing about the "poly-sensual
capabilities of the brain," let alone how to
pply and control them.
They must be taught, says the man who
"lives in time, not space," the difference
betvVeen "Hedonic" ("Don't be a helpless
Hippy!") and "Erotic" ("Navigate your
somatic time-ship!") Rapture — before
reaching the ultimate telepathic harmony of
"zero-gravity, Tantic-Mated Fusions."
Neuro- politics
His "genetic task" becomes one of "Reve
lation, not Revolution." The issue, says our
Agent, "is not brain-reward drugs, but the
freedom to choose a way of life, to evolve."
Thus, he seeks biological freedom for the
individual: "Foolish is the state which at
tempts to control what or whom its citizens
.vish to put in or expel from their bodies."
The scenes dealing with Commodore
Leri's noble evolutinary assignment take
place during the 1960s to early '70s. As the
first "extra-planetary emigrant" ("both Irish
and Interstellar"), assumes such stellar

cinematic roles as brilliant, notorious Har
vard professor and space-age novitiate, New
Messiah and Political Pawn, worshipped
hero and confused exile, harassed fugitive
and betrayed prisoner.
He is enlightened by a magnetic Tantric
Yogin, by the wise Flora-Lu, by "Electric
Joanna" and eager, spacey neuronauts who
"know how to use chemicals and move
neurons around like chess masters."
He is entangled in "webs of mammalian
deceit" by lawyers, politicians, a mysteri
ous Vatican diplomat and a French "gour
met gangster" ("I eat Swiss police like es
cargot!").
In attempts to foil the "dread Nixon-
Liddy Gang's Operation Intercept," he is
both aided and crippled by a "luscious"
Mayan Banacle and a supporting cast of
some of Terra's most Beautiful People.
Braintwisting intrigue
HlRstory is set on location in New York,
Algeria and Switzerland and is loaded with
braintwisting intrigue, dazzling suspense
and dizzying intervention tactics. Will our
Evolutionary Agent end up in the "Black
Hole" before he discovers What WoMan re
ally Wants?
Although his transmission derives some
of its technical energy from such
craftsmanoids as Vonnegut, Hildebrand,
Pynchon, Joyce, Homer, Dante and the
Catholic Church, his adventures and
philosophical synthesis are uniquely his
own. What Does WoMan Want is a galactic
literary achievement, for its mind
expanded author has managed to both en
lighten and entertain us with a single,
high-energy transmission!
He is convinced that evolution for
WoMan is moving toward a "complete con
sciousness unit," or "dolphin communica
tion." Doctors, he points out, are already
starting to adopt a new definition of marital
death which considers when "the brains
separate" rather than when "two hearts stop
beating together." Furthermore, couples are
now required to wait 30 days after a first
Telo-Encephalogram (TEG) has shown no
"brain fusion." If a second TEG is then as

"disharmonious" as the first, the marriage
can be legally pronounced "dead."
He compares drugs ("neurotransmitters")
with machines. Both are "here to stay" —
and both can be abused. "Sooner or later
humanity will learn how to use (them),"
says the Commodore. "The drug has no
specific effort. It gets you high. And where
you go with it depends on you."
Assume control
Thus, individuals must intelligently as
sume the control of their own "neurosoma
tic circuitry" before "overthrowing the
shackles of gravity." He appeals to us to
think independently rather than constantly
flowing with the mainstream of humanity.
As the ancient slogan goes, "get it together"
before grazing in the grass (or whatever)
with the rest of the herd.
His is an elitist philosophy in many re
spects. Those heterosexuals who have the
time, money and inclination for extra
terrestrial migration are the primary candi
dates for Five-Brained Metamorphosis. But
I think he would also feel that neurosomatic
intelligence is something every individual
can, and should, gain. "Think for yourself"
is a step we can all mutate toward, and, as he
points out, "evolution waits for no one."
So, fellow larvals, this may or may not be
the "Epic of Metamorphosis" you've been
waiting for, but it deserves your attentive
readership. If the book strikes you as being
winking, nudging or condescending in
tone, be assured that the author is not trying
to put one over on us. On the contrary, he's
quite serious. Beneath the bemused brow of
the "far-out" fabulist, there lies a deeply
concerned "humanology buff."
After all Leary's been through, his
"philosophical treatise" could have been an
"ill-tempered convict howl," fervid rather
than funny, heavy rather than anecdotal.
Mercifully, he decided to spare us a frown
ing tirade against blind moralism, instead
offering milestone advice to all larvals and
grounded butterflies searching for the sec
ret of how to S.M.I. 2 L.E.

What Does WoMan (i.e. Humanity)
Want? is Timothy Leary's latest
autobiographical-philosophical "transmis
sion" to earthlings still stuck in the "larval
stags" of impending metamorphosis. It is
the story, cleverly and comically relayed, of
his own evolution towards higher
neurosomatic and energetic intelligence.
He himself "mutates," and undertakes a
Mutation mission primarly concerned with
tne first, "Five-Brained" evolutionary step
— getting individuals to think for them
selves.
In his "science-faction," Leary is the Out
law Agent from T.I.M.E. assigned to "find
the encoded secret that the dying planet
hungers for" — the solution to the enigma
ic "S.M.I. 2 L.E."
His mutation signal is predominantly
sexual ("There's no social unit as powerful
as a couple, sexually secure and erotically
in tune. . ."), but it is constantly being
short-circuited by humanoid insistence on
knowing nothing about the "poly-sensual
capabilities of the brain," let alone how to
pply and control them.
They must be taught, says the man who
"lives in time, not space," the difference
betvVeen "Hedonic" ("Don't be a helpless
Hippy!") and "Erotic" ("Navigate your
somatic time-ship!") Rapture — before
reaching the ultimate telepathic harmony of
"zero-gravity, Tantic-Mated Fusions."
Neuro- politics
His "genetic task" becomes one of "Reve
lation, not Revolution." The issue, says our
Agent, "is not brain-reward drugs, but the
freedom to choose a way of life, to evolve."
Thus, he seeks biological freedom for the
individual: "Foolish is the state which at
tempts to control what or whom its citizens
.vish to put in or expel from their bodies."
The scenes dealing with Commodore
Leri's noble evolutinary assignment take
place during the 1960s to early '70s. As the
first "extra-planetary emigrant" ("both Irish
and Interstellar"), assumes such stellar

cinematic roles as brilliant, notorious Har
vard professor and space-age novitiate, New
Messiah and Political Pawn, worshipped
hero and confused exile, harassed fugitive
and betrayed prisoner.
He is enlightened by a magnetic Tantric
Yogin, by the wise Flora-Lu, by "Electric
Joanna" and eager, spacey neuronauts who
"know how to use chemicals and move
neurons around like chess masters."
He is entangled in "webs of mammalian
deceit" by lawyers, politicians, a mysteri
ous Vatican diplomat and a French "gour
met gangster" ("I eat Swiss police like es
cargot!").
In attempts to foil the "dread Nixon-
Liddy Gang's Operation Intercept," he is
both aided and crippled by a "luscious"
Mayan Banacle and a supporting cast of
some of Terra's most Beautiful People.
Braintwisting intrigue
HlRstory is set on location in New York,
Algeria and Switzerland and is loaded with
braintwisting intrigue, dazzling suspense
and dizzying intervention tactics. Will our
Evolutionary Agent end up in the "Black
Hole" before he discovers What WoMan re
ally Wants?
Although his transmission derives some
of its technical energy from such
craftsmanoids as Vonnegut, Hildebrand,
Pynchon, Joyce, Homer, Dante and the
Catholic Church, his adventures and
philosophical synthesis are uniquely his
own. What Does WoMan Want is a galactic
literary achievement, for its mind
expanded author has managed to both en
lighten and entertain us with a single,
high-energy transmission!
He is convinced that evolution for
WoMan is moving toward a "complete con
sciousness unit," or "dolphin communica
tion." Doctors, he points out, are already
starting to adopt a new definition of marital
death which considers when "the brains
separate" rather than when "two hearts stop
beating together." Furthermore, couples are
now required to wait 30 days after a first
Telo-Encephalogram (TEG) has shown no
"brain fusion." If a second TEG is then as

"disharmonious" as the first, the marriage
can be legally pronounced "dead."
He compares drugs ("neurotransmitters")
with machines. Both are "here to stay" —
and both can be abused. "Sooner or later
humanity will learn how to use (them),"
says the Commodore. "The drug has no
specific effort. It gets you high. And where
you go with it depends on you."
Assume control
Thus, individuals must intelligently as
sume the control of their own "neurosoma
tic circuitry" before "overthrowing the
shackles of gravity." He appeals to us to
think independently rather than constantly
flowing with the mainstream of humanity.
As the ancient slogan goes, "get it together"
before grazing in the grass (or whatever)
with the rest of the herd.
His is an elitist philosophy in many re
spects. Those heterosexuals who have the
time, money and inclination for extra
terrestrial migration are the primary candi
dates for Five-Brained Metamorphosis. But
I think he would also feel that neurosomatic
intelligence is something every individual
can, and should, gain. "Think for yourself"
is a step we can all mutate toward, and, as he
points out, "evolution waits for no one."
So, fellow larvals, this may or may not be
the "Epic of Metamorphosis" you've been
waiting for, but it deserves your attentive
readership. If the book strikes you as being
winking, nudging or condescending in
tone, be assured that the author is not trying
to put one over on us. On the contrary, he's
quite serious. Beneath the bemused brow of
the "far-out" fabulist, there lies a deeply
concerned "humanology buff."
After all Leary's been through, his
"philosophical treatise" could have been an
"ill-tempered convict howl," fervid rather
than funny, heavy rather than anecdotal.
Mercifully, he decided to spare us a frown
ing tirade against blind moralism, instead
offering milestone advice to all larvals and
grounded butterflies searching for the sec
ret of how to S.M.I. 2 L.E.

autobiographical-philosophical "transmis
sion" to earthlings still stuck in the "larval
stags" of impending metamorphosis. It is
the story, cleverly and comically relayed, of
his own evolution towards higher
neurosomatic and energetic intelligence.
He himself "mutates," and undertakes a
Mutation mission primarly concerned with
tne first, "Five-Brained" evolutionary step
— getting individuals to think for them
selves.
In his "science-faction," Leary is the Out
law Agent from T.I.M.E. assigned to "find
the encoded secret that the dying planet
hungers for" — the solution to the enigma
ic "S.M.I. 2 L.E."
His mutation signal is predominantly
sexual ("There's no social unit as powerful
as a couple, sexually secure and erotically
in tune. . ."), but it is constantly being
short-circuited by humanoid insistence on
knowing nothing about the "poly-sensual
capabilities of the brain," let alone how to
pply and control them.
They must be taught, says the man who
"lives in time, not space," the difference
betvVeen "Hedonic" ("Don't be a helpless
Hippy!") and "Erotic" ("Navigate your
somatic time-ship!") Rapture — before
reaching the ultimate telepathic harmony of
"zero-gravity, Tantic-Mated Fusions."
Neuro- politics
His "genetic task" becomes one of "Reve
lation, not Revolution." The issue, says our
Agent, "is not brain-reward drugs, but the
freedom to choose a way of life, to evolve."
Thus, he seeks biological freedom for the
individual: "Foolish is the state which at
tempts to control what or whom its citizens
.vish to put in or expel from their bodies."
The scenes dealing with Commodore
Leri's noble evolutinary assignment take
place during the 1960s to early '70s. As the
first "extra-planetary emigrant" ("both Irish
and Interstellar"), assumes such stellar

cinematic roles as brilliant, notorious Har
vard professor and space-age novitiate, New
Messiah and Political Pawn, worshipped
hero and confused exile, harassed fugitive
and betrayed prisoner.
He is enlightened by a magnetic Tantric
Yogin, by the wise Flora-Lu, by "Electric
Joanna" and eager, spacey neuronauts who
"know how to use chemicals and move
neurons around like chess masters."
He is entangled in "webs of mammalian
deceit" by lawyers, politicians, a mysteri
ous Vatican diplomat and a French "gour
met gangster" ("I eat Swiss police like es
cargot!").
In attempts to foil the "dread Nixon-
Liddy Gang's Operation Intercept," he is
both aided and crippled by a "luscious"
Mayan Banacle and a supporting cast of
some of Terra's most Beautiful People.
Braintwisting intrigue
HlRstory is set on location in New York,
Algeria and Switzerland and is loaded with
braintwisting intrigue, dazzling suspense
and dizzying intervention tactics. Will our
Evolutionary Agent end up in the "Black
Hole" before he discovers What WoMan re
ally Wants?
Although his transmission derives some
of its technical energy from such
craftsmanoids as Vonnegut, Hildebrand,
Pynchon, Joyce, Homer, Dante and the
Catholic Church, his adventures and
philosophical synthesis are uniquely his
own. What Does WoMan Want is a galactic
literary achievement, for its mind
expanded author has managed to both en
lighten and entertain us with a single,
high-energy transmission!
He is convinced that evolution for
WoMan is moving toward a "complete con
sciousness unit," or "dolphin communica
tion." Doctors, he points out, are already
starting to adopt a new definition of marital
death which considers when "the brains
separate" rather than when "two hearts stop
beating together." Furthermore, couples are
now required to wait 30 days after a first
Telo-Encephalogram (TEG) has shown no
"brain fusion." If a second TEG is then as

"disharmonious" as the first, the marriage
can be legally pronounced "dead."
He compares drugs ("neurotransmitters")
with machines. Both are "here to stay" —
and both can be abused. "Sooner or later
humanity will learn how to use (them),"
says the Commodore. "The drug has no
specific effort. It gets you high. And where
you go with it depends on you."
Assume control
Thus, individuals must intelligently as
sume the control of their own "neurosoma
tic circuitry" before "overthrowing the
shackles of gravity." He appeals to us to
think independently rather than constantly
flowing with the mainstream of humanity.
As the ancient slogan goes, "get it together"
before grazing in the grass (or whatever)
with the rest of the herd.
His is an elitist philosophy in many re
spects. Those heterosexuals who have the
time, money and inclination for extra
terrestrial migration are the primary candi
dates for Five-Brained Metamorphosis. But
I think he would also feel that neurosomatic
intelligence is something every individual
can, and should, gain. "Think for yourself"
is a step we can all mutate toward, and, as he
points out, "evolution waits for no one."
So, fellow larvals, this may or may not be
the "Epic of Metamorphosis" you've been
waiting for, but it deserves your attentive
readership. If the book strikes you as being
winking, nudging or condescending in
tone, be assured that the author is not trying
to put one over on us. On the contrary, he's
quite serious. Beneath the bemused brow of
the "far-out" fabulist, there lies a deeply
concerned "humanology buff."
After all Leary's been through, his
"philosophical treatise" could have been an
"ill-tempered convict howl," fervid rather
than funny, heavy rather than anecdotal.
Mercifully, he decided to spare us a frown
ing tirade against blind moralism, instead
offering milestone advice to all larvals and
grounded butterflies searching for the sec
ret of how to S.M.I. 2 L.E.
"What Does WoMan Want?" is available
through 88 Books, San Francisco.
