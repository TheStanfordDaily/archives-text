Seamus Heaney is a contem
porary Irish poet who was born
in 1939. During the last 10 years
he has published four volumes
of poetry that have gradually
earned him a position as one of
the most important living Irish
poets.
Some critics have claimed that
Heaney is the finest Irish poet
since Yeats. My familiarity with
modern Irish literature is not suf
ficient to judge this claim, but
the continual comparison of
Heaney with Yeats does deserve
some comment.
Heaney's work seem much
more characteristically Irish
than Yeats' poetry. Heaney's Ire
land is both more credible and
concrete than the more subjec
tive landscapes of Yeats. Heaney
writes about the farms, pubs,
bogs and boarding schools with
a genuine feeling that makes
them coalesce into a real na
tional landscape in a way that
Yeats' misty glens and country
homes never do.
In his first three books Heaney
wrote largely about rural Ire
land. In North he is expanding
his subject matter in an interest
ing way. Unlike most Irish poets
Heaney does not try to achieve
universality by following British
models. Just as Heaney avoided
Yeats' influence, he eschews en
tering the Anglo-Irish tradition
that Yeats helped perpetuate.
England has dominated Ire
land both politically and cultur
ally for the last four centuries.
Even Ireland's native language
all but vanished under foreign
domination. Irish literary tradi
tions also merged with the
stronger country. Many of Ire
land's greatest writers from
Swift to Wilde have been pro
ducts more of English traditions
than native impulses.
By turning his attention to Ire
land's common roots with Scan
dinavia, Heaney circumvents
England's role in shaping Irish
culture. In North Heaney's "Vik
ing" pieces have the freshness
and excitment of poetry which
has discovered some new ele
ment of national consciousness.
Heaney's writing has two
qualities which clearly mark
him as an important poet —
growth and variety. He has con
tinued to talk about certain im
portant themes with increasing
clarity and depth. And while

moving in this direction, his
work has explored many moods
and forms. The results have been
more than simply four volumes
of excellent poems. He has taken
his readers on an important
journey and kept them in
terested every step along the
way.
From one perspective
Heaney's journey has been to
find Ireland and himself as an
Irishman. The trip has always
been simultaneously personal
and national. It has taken him
through both the landscapes and
history of his country and his
youth. Heaney seems to be talk
ing both about himself and his
country when he writes in
"Bogland":
We have no prairies
To slice a big sun at evening-
Everywhere the eye concedes
to
Encroaching horizon. . .

As a Catholic poet living in
Northern Ireland, it was inevita
ble that Heaney would eventu
ally write on political themes.
What was not inevitable was that
the poetic results would be so
fine.
Writing in deceptively
conversational rhymed stanzas,
Heaney self-critically describes
the inability of Irish intellectuals
to solve the problems of their na
tion:
The liberal papist note sounds
hollow
When amplified and mixed with
the bangs
That shake all hearts and win
dows day and night.
Heaney is an important poet
just reaching his prime. If he
continues to grow as rapidly in
the next 10 years as he has in the
past there will be no question
about who is the greatest Irish
poet after Yeats.

England's role in shaping Irish
culture. In North Heaney's "Vik
ing" pieces have the freshness
and excitment of poetry which
has discovered some new ele
ment of national consciousness.
Heaney's writing has two
qualities which clearly mark
him as an important poet —
growth and variety. He has con
tinued to talk about certain im
portant themes with increasing
clarity and depth. And while

moving in this direction, his
work has explored many moods
and forms. The results have been
more than simply four volumes
of excellent poems. He has taken
his readers on an important
journey and kept them in
terested every step along the
way.
From one perspective
Heaney's journey has been to
find Ireland and himself as an
Irishman. The trip has always
been simultaneously personal
and national. It has taken him
through both the landscapes and
history of his country and his
youth. Heaney seems to be talk
ing both about himself and his
country when he writes in
"Bogland":
We have no prairies
To slice a big sun at evening-
Everywhere the eye concedes
to
Encroaching horizon. . .

As a Catholic poet living in
Northern Ireland, it was inevita
ble that Heaney would eventu
ally write on political themes.
What was not inevitable was that
the poetic results would be so
fine.
Writing in deceptively
conversational rhymed stanzas,
Heaney self-critically describes
the inability of Irish intellectuals
to solve the problems of their na
tion:
The liberal papist note sounds
hollow
When amplified and mixed with
the bangs
That shake all hearts and win
dows day and night.
Heaney is an important poet
just reaching his prime. If he
continues to grow as rapidly in
the next 10 years as he has in the
past there will be no question
about who is the greatest Irish
poet after Yeats.

Seamus Heaney is a contem
porary Irish poet who was born
in 1939. During the last 10 years
he has published four volumes
of poetry that have gradually
earned him a position as one of
the most important living Irish
poets.
Some critics have claimed that
Heaney is the finest Irish poet
since Yeats. My familiarity with
modern Irish literature is not suf
ficient to judge this claim, but
the continual comparison of
Heaney with Yeats does deserve
some comment.
Heaney's work seem much
more characteristically Irish
than Yeats' poetry. Heaney's Ire
land is both more credible and
concrete than the more subjec
tive landscapes of Yeats. Heaney
writes about the farms, pubs,
bogs and boarding schools with
a genuine feeling that makes
them coalesce into a real na
tional landscape in a way that
Yeats' misty glens and country
homes never do.
In his first three books Heaney
wrote largely about rural Ire
land. In North he is expanding
his subject matter in an interest
ing way. Unlike most Irish poets
Heaney does not try to achieve
universality by following British
models. Just as Heaney avoided
Yeats' influence, he eschews en
tering the Anglo-Irish tradition
that Yeats helped perpetuate.
England has dominated Ire
land both politically and cultur
ally for the last four centuries.
Even Ireland's native language
all but vanished under foreign
domination. Irish literary tradi

stronger country. Many of Ire
