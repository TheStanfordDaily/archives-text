In 1972, the San Diego Char
gers of the National Football
League were desperate. Season
after season of losses were taking
their toll on player morale, own
ership control and, most impor
tantly, fan interest.
Head coach Harland Svare and
principal owner and president
Gene Klein adopted an innova
tive rebuilding policy. Rather
than improve the team through
the college draft, Klein and
Svare traded for the league's
habitual troublemakers.
Duane Thomas, who hadn't
spoken to almost anyone for over
a year, started the growth pro
cess. Deacon Jones, who was
later to get in trouble for drug
problems, followed soon after.
Tim Rossovich, the glass-eating
linebacker star, was another of
the new Chargers.
But the master stroke of the
whole experiment came next.
Arnold Mandell, the co
chairman of the Department of
Psychiatry at the UC-San Diego
Medical School, was convinced
to join the management and
round the players into mental
shape.
Mandell took the job because,

as he writes: "I entered the game
of football thinking I'd be its
Roswell; I'd wind up being its
Nader."
Two wins, 11 losses and
one tie later, Mandell had be
come the league's Benedict Ar
nold. Commissioner Pete
Rozelle banned Mandell from
professional football for the rest
of his life.
In between the glorious be
ginning and ignominous end
ing, Mandell encountered prob
lem after problem. He found the
players immature, the fans
"obscene" and the entire sport
full of contradictions in its pub
lic and private appearance.
Pills, pressure, blood-thirsty
fans and even a bit of sex is told
about in Mandell's chronicle of
"the nightmare season."
Mandell writes with keen in
sight of the dirty tricks the Na
tional Football League is capable
of. The losses, followed by drug
scandals, and then the commis
sioner's decision make great
reading and adds a new view of
professional football.
Mandell still has season seats
to the Charger games, "but it will
never be the same."
