# Proposed changes in campus parking policy
## 
### 
Following is a May 1 7, 1976, memorandum to Robert R.
Augsburger, vice-president for business and finance, from
H.D. Winbigler, chairman of the Committee on Parking and
Transportation, with recommendations of the committee:
After receiving several volumes of correspondence, con
sidering also numerous suggestions submitted orally, conduc
ting three public hearings and deliberating as a committee in
22 separate sessions since August 1975, the University Com
mittee on Parking and Transportation has now reached agree
ment on recommendations for major changes in the parking
regulations which became effective last September.
The Committee still has under consideration a number of
subsidiary questions, some of which involve details in the
implementation of the changes now recommended. However,
the Committee is firm in the support of its recommendations.
They are submitted to you and reported to the Stanford
community at this time in order to provide opportunity for
public comment on them before the close of this quarter.
The recommendations, to be effective in September of
1976, are:
1. That except for rapid-turnover time-limit parking at
appropriate points, free parking from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, in the nonresidential areas of
the campus be discontinued.
2. That the present hierarchal system, based upon the
status of the operator of the vehicle, be replaced by a
system involving three categories of parking, differen
tiated by location and by the price of the permit, but
open equally to faculty, staff, and students.
3. That the present arrangements for student parking
areas for on-campus students be maintained, i.e., with
mandatory registration and the current fee, and with
parking in these areas restricted to holders of student
resident permits.
4. That aside from student resident permits, the annual
fees for permits be:
a. Category "A" (closest to functional centers) $60
b. Category "B" (intermediate) $36
c. Category "C (furthest from functional centers)
$12
Note: holders of student resident permits would be
eligible to purchase also permits for parking in cate
gories "A," "B," and "C" on payment of the appropri
ate additional fees.
5. That free shuttle service be established on a continuing
year-around basis on the Serra Street trunk route.
6. That, in addition, a free shuttle service be established
on an experimental basis on the southern side of the
central campus.
In my interim report of January 26, 1976 (published in
Campus Report of Feb. 25, 1976) I submitted four other
recommendations which, it was recognized, would require
some time for planning and execution. In many respects, the
new recommendations are based upon the assumption that
the earlier ones will be in effect.
The Committee has now reaffirmed the earlier recommen
dations and urges that they be implemented, effective in
September of 1976. These recommendations are:

1. That additional pay lots be established in strategic
locations (Tresidder, Memorial Way and Lot C).
2. That parking designated exclusively for visitors be dis
continued.
3. That arrangements for time-limit parking be revised to
increase the efficiency of its use (maximum 40 min
utes).
4. That visitor information stations be established at
major entrances to the campus.
All of the recommendations presuppose the continuation
of the arrangements for (a) reimbursement for permits for
volunteers and for (b) University Guest permits, which were
established during the past year. They also presuppose the
continuation of special arrangements for carpools and for
parking for the handicapped and disabled.
Although the Committee's deliberations involved exten
sive preoccupation with questions of the rationale for the
present regulations and for possible recommendations for
change, I am not in a position to speak so explicitly for the
Committee on such questions.
Not infrequently, members who came to agree on a given
recommendation, when they articulated their reasons, found
their reasons to be antithetical. The problem, I believe, was
not so much a matter of fundamental differences on practical
solutions as it was the variety of frames of reference in which
questions regarding parking were conceived, ranging from the
most theoretical to the most pragmatic and from the ap
proach which has been labeled "social engineering" to com
plete laissez faire. Consequently, the major issues did not
lend themselves to a single set of nice, logical propositions
equally acceptable to all members.
However, I have set forth below some of the considera
tions which, in various ways and in various degrees, in
fluenced the views of various members. With the caveat that
no consensus is claimed on the relative importance of these
considerations, nor on which of them are crucial, they are:
1. The construction of additional buildings in the central
part of the campus forces parking relentlessly to the
periphery. Including the construction which is sched
uled to begin this autumn, some 1,500 parking spaces
in prime areas of the campus will have been preempted
for construction in the decade between 1967 and 1977.
However it may serve nostalgia, speculation on re
storing the "parking situation" of earlier times is futile.
2. As a practical matter under the circumstances, it ap
pears unavoidable that an increasing proportion of the
parking on the campus will necessarily be located in
areas more remote from bases of campus operations
(offices, classrooms, laboratories, etc.) than in prior
years.
3. Under these circumstances also, differences in the
economic value of close-in parking vis-a-vis remote
parking become increasingly significant. It is appropri
ate that in any fee structure an attempt be made to
reflect these differences.
4. Under these circumstances, furthermore, there is an
increasing need for something like the Marguerite shut
tle serving remote parking lots and supplementing pub
lic transportation.

5. It is appropriate that the operators of motor vehicles
on campus should share in the cost of providing park
ing space, vis-a-vis having it provided exclusively from
general University funds.
6. A significant by-product of charging fees for parking is
that, under the arrangements presently in effect, such
charges allow the acquisition of funds, which would
not otherwise be available, for the support of the
needed shuttle service and for the support of additional
experiments with alternate means of transportation.
7. A second beneficial by-product of charging fees for
parking (thought by some to be the primary justifica
tion) is that it serves as a deterrant to the excessive and
indiscriminate use of motor vehicles on the campus and
as a stimulus to individuals to seek out alternate modes
of transportation.
8. It is consistent with human nature for one to assign the
highest priority to one's own transportation or to trans
portation which is essential to the discharge of one's
own responsibilities. It is not surprising, therefore, that
under any system which includes some free parking
along with some paid parking, large numbers of individ
uals feel that their urgent needs should entitle them to
the privilege of free parking. The numerous requests for
special dispensations attest to the pervasiveness of this
condition. The elimination of free parking would have
the advantage of effectively removing the distinction
between free parking and paid parking as an issue.
9. As for the replacement of the present hierarchal system
which is based on the status of the individual:
a. There was support within the Committee for the
proposition that faculty members should be entitled
to priority in the location of parking because of
unique faculty functions.
b. These functions are not strictly limited to members
of the Academic Council, however, and the present
limitation of eligibility for faculty reserve parking to
members of the Academic Council has introduced
inequities for which remedies would require exces
sively cumbersome and complicated administrative
measures.
c. Fewer than half of the members of the Academic
Council, aside from those in the School of Medicine,
have chosen to purchase faculty reserve permits
under the present system.
d. The prevailing view of the Committee is that the
categorical system now recommended would in gen
eral be more equitable than the present hierarchal
system and would contribute more efficiently to the
solution of the University's parking problems.
By no means are the foregoing intended as an indication
of the scope of the Committee's deliberations. As a matter of
fact, many different alternatives were explored and they
involved widely divergent considerations. However, I believe
that the foregoing were the major considerations underlying
the Committee's decisions in favor of the six newly reported
recommendations.

H. Donald Winbigler
Chairman
Following is a May 1 7, 1976, memorandum to Robert R.
Augsburger, vice-president for business and finance, from
H.D. Winbigler, chairman of the Committee on Parking and
Transportation, with recommendations of the committee:
After receiving several volumes of correspondence, con
sidering also numerous suggestions submitted orally, conduc
ting three public hearings and deliberating as a committee in
22 separate sessions since August 1975, the University Com
mittee on Parking and Transportation has now reached agree
ment on recommendations for major changes in the parking
regulations which became effective last September.
The Committee still has under consideration a number of
subsidiary questions, some of which involve details in the
implementation of the changes now recommended. However,
the Committee is firm in the support of its recommendations.
They are submitted to you and reported to the Stanford
community at this time in order to provide opportunity for
public comment on them before the close of this quarter.
The recommendations, to be effective in September of
1976, are:
1. That except for rapid-turnover time-limit parking at
appropriate points, free parking from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, in the nonresidential areas of
the campus be discontinued.
2. That the present hierarchal system, based upon the
status of the operator of the vehicle, be replaced by a
system involving three categories of parking, differen
tiated by location and by the price of the permit, but
open equally to faculty, staff, and students.
3. That the present arrangements for student parking
areas for on-campus students be maintained, i.e., with
mandatory registration and the current fee, and with
parking in these areas restricted to holders of student
resident permits.
4. That aside from student resident permits, the annual
fees for permits be:
a. Category "A" (closest to functional centers) $60
b. Category "B" (intermediate) $36
c. Category "C (furthest from functional centers)
$12
Note: holders of student resident permits would be
eligible to purchase also permits for parking in cate
gories "A," "B," and "C" on payment of the appropri
ate additional fees.
5. That free shuttle service be established on a continuing
year-around basis on the Serra Street trunk route.
6. That, in addition, a free shuttle service be established
on an experimental basis on the southern side of the
central campus.
In my interim report of January 26, 1976 (published in
Campus Report of Feb. 25, 1976) I submitted four other
recommendations which, it was recognized, would require
some time for planning and execution. In many respects, the
new recommendations are based upon the assumption that
the earlier ones will be in effect.
The Committee has now reaffirmed the earlier recommen
dations and urges that they be implemented, effective in
September of 1976. These recommendations are:

1. That additional pay lots be established in strategic
locations (Tresidder, Memorial Way and Lot C).
2. That parking designated exclusively for visitors be dis
continued.
3. That arrangements for time-limit parking be revised to
increase the efficiency of its use (maximum 40 min
utes).
4. That visitor information stations be established at
major entrances to the campus.
All of the recommendations presuppose the continuation
of the arrangements for (a) reimbursement for permits for
volunteers and for (b) University Guest permits, which were
established during the past year. They also presuppose the
continuation of special arrangements for carpools and for
parking for the handicapped and disabled.
Although the Committee's deliberations involved exten
sive preoccupation with questions of the rationale for the
present regulations and for possible recommendations for
change, I am not in a position to speak so explicitly for the
Committee on such questions.
Not infrequently, members who came to agree on a given
recommendation, when they articulated their reasons, found
their reasons to be antithetical. The problem, I believe, was
not so much a matter of fundamental differences on practical
solutions as it was the variety of frames of reference in which
questions regarding parking were conceived, ranging from the
most theoretical to the most pragmatic and from the ap
proach which has been labeled "social engineering" to com
plete laissez faire. Consequently, the major issues did not
lend themselves to a single set of nice, logical propositions
equally acceptable to all members.
However, I have set forth below some of the considera
tions which, in various ways and in various degrees, in
fluenced the views of various members. With the caveat that
no consensus is claimed on the relative importance of these
considerations, nor on which of them are crucial, they are:
1. The construction of additional buildings in the central
part of the campus forces parking relentlessly to the
periphery. Including the construction which is sched
uled to begin this autumn, some 1,500 parking spaces
in prime areas of the campus will have been preempted
for construction in the decade between 1967 and 1977.
However it may serve nostalgia, speculation on re
storing the "parking situation" of earlier times is futile.
2. As a practical matter under the circumstances, it ap
pears unavoidable that an increasing proportion of the
parking on the campus will necessarily be located in
areas more remote from bases of campus operations
(offices, classrooms, laboratories, etc.) than in prior
years.
3. Under these circumstances also, differences in the
economic value of close-in parking vis-a-vis remote
parking become increasingly significant. It is appropri
ate that in any fee structure an attempt be made to
reflect these differences.
4. Under these circumstances, furthermore, there is an
increasing need for something like the Marguerite shut
tle serving remote parking lots and supplementing pub
lic transportation.

5. It is appropriate that the operators of motor vehicles
on campus should share in the cost of providing park
ing space, vis-a-vis having it provided exclusively from
general University funds.
6. A significant by-product of charging fees for parking is
that, under the arrangements presently in effect, such
charges allow the acquisition of funds, which would
not otherwise be available, for the support of the
needed shuttle service and for the support of additional
experiments with alternate means of transportation.
7. A second beneficial by-product of charging fees for
parking (thought by some to be the primary justifica
tion) is that it serves as a deterrant to the excessive and
indiscriminate use of motor vehicles on the campus and
as a stimulus to individuals to seek out alternate modes
of transportation.
8. It is consistent with human nature for one to assign the
highest priority to one's own transportation or to trans
portation which is essential to the discharge of one's
own responsibilities. It is not surprising, therefore, that
under any system which includes some free parking
along with some paid parking, large numbers of individ
uals feel that their urgent needs should entitle them to
the privilege of free parking. The numerous requests for
special dispensations attest to the pervasiveness of this
condition. The elimination of free parking would have
the advantage of effectively removing the distinction
between free parking and paid parking as an issue.
9. As for the replacement of the present hierarchal system
which is based on the status of the individual:
a. There was support within the Committee for the
proposition that faculty members should be entitled
to priority in the location of parking because of
unique faculty functions.
b. These functions are not strictly limited to members
of the Academic Council, however, and the present
limitation of eligibility for faculty reserve parking to
members of the Academic Council has introduced
inequities for which remedies would require exces
sively cumbersome and complicated administrative
measures.
c. Fewer than half of the members of the Academic
Council, aside from those in the School of Medicine,
have chosen to purchase faculty reserve permits

own responsibilities. It is not surprising, therefore, that
under any system which includes some free parking
along with some paid parking, large numbers of individ
uals feel that their urgent needs should entitle them to
the privilege of free parking. The numerous requests for
special dispensations attest to the pervasiveness of this
condition. The elimination of free parking would have
the advantage of effectively removing the distinction
between free parking and paid parking as an issue.
9. As for the replacement of the present hierarchal system
which is based on the status of the individual:
a. There was support within the Committee for the
proposition that faculty members should be entitled
to priority in the location of parking because of
unique faculty functions.
b. These functions are not strictly limited to members
of the Academic Council, however, and the present
limitation of eligibility for faculty reserve parking to
members of the Academic Council has introduced
inequities for which remedies would require exces
sively cumbersome and complicated administrative
measures.
c. Fewer than half of the members of the Academic
Council, aside from those in the School of Medicine,
have chosen to purchase faculty reserve permits
under the present system.
d. The prevailing view of the Committee is that the
categorical system now recommended would in gen
eral be more equitable than the present hierarchal
system and would contribute more efficiently to the
solution of the University's parking problems.
By no means are the foregoing intended as an indication
of the scope of the Committee's deliberations. As a matter of
fact, many different alternatives were explored and they
involved widely divergent considerations. However, I believe
that the foregoing were the major considerations underlying
the Committee's decisions in favor of the six newly reported
recommendations.
H. Donald Winbigler
Chairman
Following is a May 1 7, 1976, memorandum to Robert R.
Augsburger, vice-president for business and finance, from
H.D. Winbigler, chairman of the Committee on Parking and
Transportation, with recommendations of the committee:
After receiving several volumes of correspondence, con
sidering also numerous suggestions submitted orally, conduc
ting three public hearings and deliberating as a committee in
22 separate sessions since August 1975, the University Com
mittee on Parking and Transportation has now reached agree
ment on recommendations for major changes in the parking
regulations which became effective last September.
The Committee still has under consideration a number of
subsidiary questions, some of which involve details in the
implementation of the changes now recommended. However,
the Committee is firm in the support of its recommendations.
They are submitted to you and reported to the Stanford
community at this time in order to provide opportunity for
public comment on them before the close of this quarter.
The recommendations, to be effective in September of
1976, are:
1. That except for rapid-turnover time-limit parking at
appropriate points, free parking from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, in the nonresidential areas of
the campus be discontinued.
2. That the present hierarchal system, based upon the
status of the operator of the vehicle, be replaced by a
system involving three categories of parking, differen
tiated by location and by the price of the permit, but
open equally to faculty, staff, and students.
3. That the present arrangements for student parking
areas for on-campus students be maintained, i.e., with
mandatory registration and the current fee, and with
parking in these areas restricted to holders of student
resident permits.
4. That aside from student resident permits, the annual
fees for permits be:
a. Category "A" (closest to functional centers) $60
b. Category "B" (intermediate) $36
c. Category "C (furthest from functional centers)
$12
Note: holders of student resident permits would be
eligible to purchase also permits for parking in cate
gories "A," "B," and "C" on payment of the appropri
ate additional fees.
5. That free shuttle service be established on a continuing
year-around basis on the Serra Street trunk route.
6. That, in addition, a free shuttle service be established
on an experimental basis on the southern side of the
central campus.
In my interim report of January 26, 1976 (published in
Campus Report of Feb. 25, 1976) I submitted four other
recommendations which, it was recognized, would require
some time for planning and execution. In many respects, the
new recommendations are based upon the assumption that
the earlier ones will be in effect.
The Committee has now reaffirmed the earlier recommen
dations and urges that they be implemented, effective in
September of 1976. These recommendations are:

1. That additional pay lots be established in strategic
locations (Tresidder, Memorial Way and Lot C).
2. That parking designated exclusively for visitors be dis
continued.
3. That arrangements for time-limit parking be revised to
increase the efficiency of its use (maximum 40 min
utes).
4. That visitor information stations be established at
major entrances to the campus.
All of the recommendations presuppose the continuation
of the arrangements for (a) reimbursement for permits for
volunteers and for (b) University Guest permits, which were
established during the past year. They also presuppose the
continuation of special arrangements for carpools and for
parking for the handicapped and disabled.
Although the Committee's deliberations involved exten
sive preoccupation with questions of the rationale for the
present regulations and for possible recommendations for
change, I am not in a position to speak so explicitly for the
Committee on such questions.
Not infrequently, members who came to agree on a given
recommendation, when they articulated their reasons, found
their reasons to be antithetical. The problem, I believe, was
not so much a matter of fundamental differences on practical
solutions as it was the variety of frames of reference in which
questions regarding parking were conceived, ranging from the
most theoretical to the most pragmatic and from the ap
proach which has been labeled "social engineering" to com
plete laissez faire. Consequently, the major issues did not
lend themselves to a single set of nice, logical propositions
equally acceptable to all members.
However, I have set forth below some of the considera
tions which, in various ways and in various degrees, in
fluenced the views of various members. With the caveat that
no consensus is claimed on the relative importance of these
considerations, nor on which of them are crucial, they are:
1. The construction of additional buildings in the central
part of the campus forces parking relentlessly to the
periphery. Including the construction which is sched
uled to begin this autumn, some 1,500 parking spaces
in prime areas of the campus will have been preempted
for construction in the decade between 1967 and 1977.
However it may serve nostalgia, speculation on re
storing the "parking situation" of earlier times is futile.
2. As a practical matter under the circumstances, it ap
pears unavoidable that an increasing proportion of the
parking on the campus will necessarily be located in
areas more remote from bases of campus operations
(offices, classrooms, laboratories, etc.) than in prior
years.
3. Under these circumstances also, differences in the
economic value of close-in parking vis-a-vis remote
parking become increasingly significant. It is appropri
ate that in any fee structure an attempt be made to
reflect these differences.
4. Under these circumstances, furthermore, there is an
increasing need for something like the Marguerite shut
tle serving remote parking lots and supplementing pub
lic transportation.

5. It is appropriate that the operators of motor vehicles
on campus should share in the cost of providing park
ing space, vis-a-vis having it provided exclusively from
general University funds.
6. A significant by-product of charging fees for parking is
that, under the arrangements presently in effect, such
charges allow the acquisition of funds, which would
not otherwise be available, for the support of the
needed shuttle service and for the support of additional
experiments with alternate means of transportation.
7. A second beneficial by-product of charging fees for
parking (thought by some to be the primary justifica
tion) is that it serves as a deterrant to the excessive and
indiscriminate use of motor vehicles on the campus and
as a stimulus to individuals to seek out alternate modes
of transportation.
8. It is consistent with human nature for one to assign the
highest priority to one's own transportation or to trans
portation which is essential to the discharge of one's
own responsibilities. It is not surprising, therefore, that
under any system which includes some free parking

on campus should share in the cost of providing park
ing space, vis-a-vis having it provided exclusively from
general University funds.
6. A significant by-product of charging fees for parking is
that, under the arrangements presently in effect, such
charges allow the acquisition of funds, which would
not otherwise be available, for the support of the
needed shuttle service and for the support of additional
experiments with alternate means of transportation.
7. A second beneficial by-product of charging fees for
parking (thought by some to be the primary justifica
tion) is that it serves as a deterrant to the excessive and
indiscriminate use of motor vehicles on the campus and
as a stimulus to individuals to seek out alternate modes
of transportation.
8. It is consistent with human nature for one to assign the
highest priority to one's own transportation or to trans
portation which is essential to the discharge of one's
own responsibilities. It is not surprising, therefore, that
under any system which includes some free parking
along with some paid parking, large numbers of individ
uals feel that their urgent needs should entitle them to
the privilege of free parking. The numerous requests for
special dispensations attest to the pervasiveness of this
condition. The elimination of free parking would have
the advantage of effectively removing the distinction
between free parking and paid parking as an issue.
9. As for the replacement of the present hierarchal system
which is based on the status of the individual:
a. There was support within the Committee for the
proposition that faculty members should be entitled
to priority in the location of parking because of
unique faculty functions.
b. These functions are not strictly limited to members
of the Academic Council, however, and the present
limitation of eligibility for faculty reserve parking to
members of the Academic Council has introduced
inequities for which remedies would require exces
sively cumbersome and complicated administrative
measures.
c. Fewer than half of the members of the Academic
Council, aside from those in the School of Medicine,
have chosen to purchase faculty reserve permits
under the present system.
d. The prevailing view of the Committee is that the
categorical system now recommended would in gen
eral be more equitable than the present hierarchal
system and would contribute more efficiently to the
solution of the University's parking problems.
By no means are the foregoing intended as an indication
of the scope of the Committee's deliberations. As a matter of
fact, many different alternatives were explored and they
involved widely divergent considerations. However, I believe
that the foregoing were the major considerations underlying
the Committee's decisions in favor of the six newly reported
recommendations.

Following is a May 1 7, 1976, memorandum to Robert R.
Augsburger, vice-president for business and finance, from
H.D. Winbigler, chairman of the Committee on Parking and
Transportation, with recommendations of the committee:
After receiving several volumes of correspondence, con
sidering also numerous suggestions submitted orally, conduc
ting three public hearings and deliberating as a committee in
22 separate sessions since August 1975, the University Com
mittee on Parking and Transportation has now reached agree
ment on recommendations for major changes in the parking
regulations which became effective last September.
The Committee still has under consideration a number of
subsidiary questions, some of which involve details in the
implementation of the changes now recommended. However,
the Committee is firm in the support of its recommendations.
They are submitted to you and reported to the Stanford
community at this time in order to provide opportunity for
public comment on them before the close of this quarter.
The recommendations, to be effective in September of
1976, are:
1. That except for rapid-turnover time-limit parking at
appropriate points, free parking from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, in the nonresidential areas of
the campus be discontinued.
2. That the present hierarchal system, based upon the
status of the operator of the vehicle, be replaced by a
system involving three categories of parking, differen
tiated by location and by the price of the permit, but
open equally to faculty, staff, and students.
3. That the present arrangements for student parking
areas for on-campus students be maintained, i.e., with
mandatory registration and the current fee, and with
parking in these areas restricted to holders of student
resident permits.
4. That aside from student resident permits, the annual
fees for permits be:
a. Category "A" (closest to functional centers) $60
b. Category "B" (intermediate) $36
c. Category "C (furthest from functional centers)
$12
Note: holders of student resident permits would be
eligible to purchase also permits for parking in cate
gories "A," "B," and "C" on payment of the appropri
ate additional fees.
5. That free shuttle service be established on a continuing
year-around basis on the Serra Street trunk route.
6. That, in addition, a free shuttle service be established
on an experimental basis on the southern side of the
central campus.
In my interim report of January 26, 1976 (published in
Campus Report of Feb. 25, 1976) I submitted four other
recommendations which, it was recognized, would require
some time for planning and execution. In many respects, the
new recommendations are based upon the assumption that
the earlier ones will be in effect.
The Committee has now reaffirmed the earlier recommen
dations and urges that they be implemented, effective in
September of 1976. These recommendations are:

1. That additional pay lots be established in strategic
locations (Tresidder, Memorial Way and Lot C).
2. That parking designated exclusively for visitors be dis
continued.
3. That arrangements for time-limit parking be revised to
increase the efficiency of its use (maximum 40 min
utes).
4. That visitor information stations be established at
major entrances to the campus.
All of the recommendations presuppose the continuation
of the arrangements for (a) reimbursement for permits for
volunteers and for (b) University Guest permits, which were
established during the past year. They also presuppose the
continuation of special arrangements for carpools and for
parking for the handicapped and disabled.
Although the Committee's deliberations involved exten
sive preoccupation with questions of the rationale for the
present regulations and for possible recommendations for
change, I am not in a position to speak so explicitly for the
Committee on such questions.
Not infrequently, members who came to agree on a given
recommendation, when they articulated their reasons, found
their reasons to be antithetical. The problem, I believe, was
not so much a matter of fundamental differences on practical
solutions as it was the variety of frames of reference in which
questions regarding parking were conceived, ranging from the
most theoretical to the most pragmatic and from the ap
proach which has been labeled "social engineering" to com
plete laissez faire. Consequently, the major issues did not
lend themselves to a single set of nice, logical propositions
equally acceptable to all members.
However, I have set forth below some of the considera
tions which, in various ways and in various degrees, in
fluenced the views of various members. With the caveat that
no consensus is claimed on the relative importance of these
considerations, nor on which of them are crucial, they are:
1. The construction of additional buildings in the central
part of the campus forces parking relentlessly to the
periphery. Including the construction which is sched
uled to begin this autumn, some 1,500 parking spaces
in prime areas of the campus will have been preempted
for construction in the decade between 1967 and 1977.
However it may serve nostalgia, speculation on re
storing the "parking situation" of earlier times is futile.
2. As a practical matter under the circumstances, it ap
pears unavoidable that an increasing proportion of the
parking on the campus will necessarily be located in
areas more remote from bases of campus operations
(offices, classrooms, laboratories, etc.) than in prior
years.
3. Under these circumstances also, differences in the
economic value of close-in parking vis-a-vis remote
parking become increasingly significant. It is appropri
ate that in any fee structure an attempt be made to
reflect these differences.
4. Under these circumstances, furthermore, there is an
increasing need for something like the Marguerite shut
tle serving remote parking lots and supplementing pub
lic transportation.
