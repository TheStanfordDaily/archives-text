## The 						inside track Sports need student funding 
### Jeff Parietti 
In the days of ever tightening budgets, I'd
like to suggest that the Athletic Department
consider using student fees to support the
intercollegiate program.
The decision last month to eliminate
wrestling as a varsity sport, effective in
1977, raises the question of possible De
partment budget problems and also the
question of whether there will be further
minor sports eliminations.
My worry is that the Department will start
dropping other minor sports because of a
lack of funds to support them.
I would like to see Stanford try to main
tain a broad program and not wind up just a
football and basketball school.
Minor sports
Student funding of athletics is one way to
keep minor sports, such as wrestling, via
ble. Use of student fees in this manner is by
no means uncommon. UC-Berkeley, for one,
utilizes the fees.
According to Cal Athletic Director Dave
Maggard, his Department received
$500,000 in student fees this year for the
athletic program. The money goes to sup
port what Maggard called "the non-revenue
producing sports" — everything from in
tramurals to track, but not including foot
ball or basketball.
But Stanford Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
said "I'm uncomfortable with student fees,
personally," and said he has never recom
mended their use. "We're fortunate enough
to have a program supported by football and
the general fund."
The reason Ruetz said he's uncomfortable
with the fees is that "if the fees are suddenly
stopped, the program could collapse."
But student fees could be used to supple-

rnent Department revenue, instead of carry
ing the program.
More student input
Student input might also have to be in
creased if fees are used.
At Cal, Maggard said "the Department
has a student intern who reviews the whole
budget process." A committee, including
student representation, decides how much
money should be allocated to the athletic
program from general registration fees.
As Maggard said "the students have a big
say in what goes on in the department."
Ruetz, however, said that "a lot of the
budget is confidential, especially such
things as salaries." Ruetz added though,
that he wouldn't be uncomfortable with
more student representation.
Ruetz admitted there may have to be a
realignment of the program in the future.
"We're going to have to decide what sports
we're going to subsidize from football in
come," he said.
Realignment
But the realignment is still up in the air
because as Ruetz said, "I'm not sure football
can forever bear the burden of supporting
the other sports."
One way to help support other sports is to
use student fees. There are several ways this
could be done. The first is to use the fees to
support minor sports.
The second is to use the money to run
club sports, the physical education and the
intramural programs, all of which the de
partment currently subsidizes.
Ruetz said he believes this proposal to be
feasible. The final idea is to put the money
from fees into a general department fund to
be used for whatever need that exists.

Another way to help save minor sports is
to shave fat from the biggest offender
and spender in the department — football.
For example, the team stays in Rickey's
Hyatt House the night before a home game.
Ruetz said that this costs the department
approximately $4000. Is this luxury or
necessity?
Both Ruetz and Assoc. Director of Athle
tics Bob Young concurred that this is a
necessity and both said coaches like to keep
the players away from campus parties the
night before a game. No other Stanford
teams go to a hotel before a home competi
tion.
As Ruetz said though, "Other schools in
the country do the same thing. If everyone
in the country eliminated this procedure,
then we would do it also. But I'm not going
to do it unilaterally."
The football players often see a movie the
night before a game. The movie is usually
paid for by the department. Luxury or
necessity?
Training table
The football training table is another area
where costs could be cut. Young said train
ing table costs are in the area of $40,000. He
went on to explain that the players get three
meals per day, starting in August and end
ing the day of fall quarter registration. Then
they get six dinners a week until season's
end.
The point is that some fat does exist in the
program and in the Department itself. Now
I'm not knocking football, because it does
bring in revenue that helps support other
sports. But I would hope waste could be
reduced or prevented and that these other
sports could then see more of that footbal.'
revenue.

HEAVE HO — The IM track meet opened yesterday afternoon
at the Stanford Stadium. Most qualifying heats were run, with
the finals to be held Sunday at 1 p.m. in the Stadium. The
Black Student's Union No. 1 team led after yesterday. Here,
