# Clowns, 'ringers' surface at swim meet
## 
### Gary Sprague 
It was a real circus out there. They even
had clowns. There were wild animals.
They were called SAE men. "Hugh,
Hugh, Hugh," they chanted. Hugh
finished second. SAE cheered anyway.
But nobody cheered for the clowns.
There were just four of them, four
freshman women who made up the Lar
kin relay team. Their faces were painted
with red, white and blue grease paint.
Their necks were painted with lighting
bolts. Perhaps the lightning bolts made
them swim faster.
All these and more characterized the
fM swim meets, held Tuesday at the de-
Guerre Pools. Both an all university
meet, open to men and women, and a
women-only meet were held.
The crowd along the pool's edge was
divided into distinct groups. Cheers
came in localized spurts, as Branner, Los
Arcos or SAE would cheer their swim
mer.
The crowd was funny. Tom Angelo
tied the national IM record for the 50
yard butterfly. Scattered cheers. While
waiting for the starter to call the next
heat, a swimmer fell off the starting block
and into the pool. The crowd roared.

The wind was chilly, and the waiting
swimmers shivered in their towels. The
general mood was summed up in white
letters across the back of one women's
warmups. "Brrr!" they read. A guy
walked by in a light blue set of warmups
labeled "Tacoma Swim Club." Obvi
ously a ringer.
Some people studied circuits or read
Gene Therapy for Human Genetic Dis
eases. Some people looked at all the
Speedos. Some people watched the
clowns. A few even watched the meet.
The mood was definitely low-key.
"Katie, what's your last name," droned
the loudspeaker.
But it really didn't matter much what
Katie's last name was. Just about every
body was there for the fun of it. Except
perhaps the wild animals. It's hard to tell
what they were there for.
The color and noise of the main pool
was definitely the center ring, but the
diving competition was no less interest
ing. There were few spectators over at the
diving pool. Only the fellow divers were
there to applaud a well executed forward
one and a half. Or cringe at an entry
nearer the horizontal than the vertical.
Gymnast Ted Marcy was a diver. Un
fortunately, the board didn't have pom

mel handles. Nancy Ditz didn't need
handles. She tried a somersault with two
full twists.
"I ought to get at least a four for try
ing," she told the judges.
The judges agreed. 4, 4V2, 4. But she
scored well enough on difficulty to win.
The individual medley came near the
end of the meet. Individual masochism,
the swimmers called them.
"Go Art Department," yelled a suppor
ter.
On the strength of a pleasing blend of
green, white and light blue in a delicate
floral motif, the Art Department walked
off with the prettiest swimsuit award.
Finally came the relays. This was the
big opportunity for the four women from
Larkin,
The swimmers mounted the blocks for
the women's 200 yard relay. One swim
mer jumped too soon; false start. Anxi
ous to avoid a similar premature commi
tal, the leadoff Larkin swimmer lurched
backwards, ending up supine on the
starting block. A very inauspicious de
but.
But when the cheering and thrashing
were over, the Larkin women had scored
a solid six yard victory. Today, at least,
the clowns were nothing to laugh at.
