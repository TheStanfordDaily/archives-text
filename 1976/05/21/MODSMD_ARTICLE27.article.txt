# 'Super conference' draws criticism here
## 
### Chris Baker 
The "Super Conference"—a
plan to realign some of the 467
football-playing schools of the
NCAA—is fast becoming a real
ity.
The NCAA Classification
Committee, with the approval of
the NCAA Executive Committee,
is proceeding with a plan to
reorganize top two divisions of
football-playing members of the
NCAA.
The NCAA membership is at
present divided into four divi
sions, but only in football. Pre
sent Division I would be divided
into Divisions I — the "Super
Conference" — and lA, with
some members of Division II
probably becoming members of
Division lA.
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
said he is against the reorganiza
tion proposal. "No logic has
been given for it. The very large
schools feel regulations have
hurt their programs."
First proponent
One of the first proponents of
the "Super Conference" was
former (JSC Athletic Director
and Head Football Coach John
McKay. He felt that the present
system of NCAA regulation ena
bled smaller schools to tie down
the larger schools such as USC,
Ohio State and Oklahoma.
A "Super Conference," McKay
believed, would provide less re
strictive rules for major schools.
However, members would re
main in their present athletic
conferences.
President Richard Lyman has
been a strong critic of the prop
osal. When the Classification
Committee mailed a survey to
the executive officers of all
NCAA members, asking for
comments on the plan, Lyman
responded to only two questions
of the survey.
Lyman, in a letter to Arizona
Prof. Louis A. Myers, chairman
of the Classification Committee,
said that the survey was
"biased" in favor of forming the
"Super Conference."
"We see no way to answer (any
but the first two questions) with
out compromising our strong
opposition to a divisional reor
ganization which would pro
duce a super football division,"
Lyman wrote.
"It is, to put the point squarely,
a biased questionnaire-"
Over 17 other college presi
dents also attached letters when

they returned the surveys. But
no one was as harsh as Lyman,
according to Pacific-8 Executive
Director Wiles Hallock, a
member of the Classification
Committee.
Hallock said that while cur
rent Division I members were
split on the issue (87-87),
schools in Division II favored re
classification by a 63-39 margin.
"Because we got such good re
sponse we decided to go ahead
with reorganization," said Hal
lock, "subject to the vote of the
NCAA Executive Committee,"
he added.
The Classification Committee
is currently in the process of dis
tributing a survey to current Di
vision I and II members and will
make its tenative classifications
of schools June 1-2. Appeals will
be heard by the Committee until
June 30, at which time it will
reach its final classification de
cisions.
'Whole conferences'
Tom Hanson, assistant NCAA
executive director, said, "We
won't just take whole confer
ences into Division I. Each
school will be considered indi
vidually."
"The 'Super Conference' bears
the seeds of destruction," Ruetz
maintained. "Our position is
against it, although I suspect that
we would be in Division I."
According to criteria the Clas
sification Committee is using to
reclassify its members, Stanford
would probably be included in
Division I — the "Super Confer

ence.
But Ruetz predicted that a "big
fight" will probably come when
the entire NCAA membership
convenes at its next convention
in January.
Lyman had opposed the re
classification plan because of the
possibility of members of the
new Division I passing legisla
tion keeping athletic scholar
ships independent of financial
need.
At the last NCAA convention,
Lyman fought for making scho
larships dependent on need.
'Watered down'
Lyman said that the reclassifi
cation plan had been "enorm
ously watered down."
The Classification Committee
decided that when considering
legislation pertaining only to
football, Divisions I and IA
would vote together except
when considering (a) member
ship criteria for either division
in football; (b) number of finan
cial aid awards in football; (c)
establishment of a football
championship.
Hanson, of the NCAA, said he
expects the biggest fight will
come when the Classification
Committee assigns schools.
"Some schools have been placed
in Division I because of histori
cal accident."
If and when the NCAA estab
lishes a "Super Conference" it
certainly won't be an accident —
the result will probably be the
most carefully conceived plan in
NCAA history.

in January.
Lyman had opposed the re
classification plan because of the
possibility of members of the
new Division I passing legisla
tion keeping athletic scholar
ships independent of financial
need.
At the last NCAA convention,
Lyman fought for making scho
larships dependent on need.
'Watered down'
Lyman said that the reclassifi
cation plan had been "enorm
ously watered down."
The Classification Committee
decided that when considering
legislation pertaining only to
football, Divisions I and IA
would vote together except
when considering (a) member
ship criteria for either division
in football; (b) number of finan
cial aid awards in football; (c)
establishment of a football
championship.
Hanson, of the NCAA, said he
expects the biggest fight will
come when the Classification
Committee assigns schools.
"Some schools have been placed
in Division I because of histori
cal accident."
If and when the NCAA estab
lishes a "Super Conference" it
certainly won't be an accident —
the result will probably be the
most carefully conceived plan in
NCAA history.
The "Super Conference"—a
plan to realign some of the 467
football-playing schools of the
NCAA—is fast becoming a real
ity.
The NCAA Classification
Committee, with the approval of
the NCAA Executive Committee,
is proceeding with a plan to
reorganize top two divisions of
football-playing members of the
NCAA.
The NCAA membership is at
present divided into four divi
sions, but only in football. Pre
sent Division I would be divided
into Divisions I — the "Super
Conference" — and lA, with
some members of Division II
probably becoming members of
Division lA.
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
said he is against the reorganiza
tion proposal. "No logic has
been given for it. The very large
schools feel regulations have
hurt their programs."
First proponent
One of the first proponents of
the "Super Conference" was
former (JSC Athletic Director
and Head Football Coach John
McKay. He felt that the present
system of NCAA regulation ena
bled smaller schools to tie down
the larger schools such as USC,
Ohio State and Oklahoma.
A "Super Conference," McKay
believed, would provide less re
strictive rules for major schools.
However, members would re
main in their present athletic
conferences.
President Richard Lyman has
been a strong critic of the prop
osal. When the Classification
Committee mailed a survey to
the executive officers of all
NCAA members, asking for
comments on the plan, Lyman
responded to only two questions
of the survey.
Lyman, in a letter to Arizona
Prof. Louis A. Myers, chairman
of the Classification Committee,
said that the survey was
"biased" in favor of forming the
"Super Conference."
"We see no way to answer (any
but the first two questions) with
out compromising our strong
opposition to a divisional reor
ganization which would pro
duce a super football division,"
Lyman wrote.
"It is, to put the point squarely,
a biased questionnaire-"
Over 17 other college presi
dents also attached letters when

they returned the surveys. But
no one was as harsh as Lyman,
according to Pacific-8 Executive
Director Wiles Hallock, a
member of the Classification
Committee.
Hallock said that while cur
rent Division I members were
split on the issue (87-87),
schools in Division II favored re
classification by a 63-39 margin.
"Because we got such good re
sponse we decided to go ahead
with reorganization," said Hal
lock, "subject to the vote of the
NCAA Executive Committee,"
he added.
The Classification Committee
is currently in the process of dis
tributing a survey to current Di
vision I and II members and will
make its tenative classifications
of schools June 1-2. Appeals will
be heard by the Committee until
June 30, at which time it will
reach its final classification de
cisions.
'Whole conferences'
Tom Hanson, assistant NCAA
executive director, said, "We
won't just take whole confer
ences into Division I. Each
school will be considered indi
vidually."
"The 'Super Conference' bears
the seeds of destruction," Ruetz
maintained. "Our position is
against it, although I suspect that
we would be in Division I."
According to criteria the Clas
sification Committee is using to
reclassify its members, Stanford
would probably be included in
Division I — the "Super Confer

ence.
But Ruetz predicted that a "big
fight" will probably come when
the entire NCAA membership
convenes at its next convention
in January.
