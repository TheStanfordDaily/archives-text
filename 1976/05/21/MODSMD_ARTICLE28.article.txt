# Sandoval, Berka seek Olympic berths

### Bruce Anderson 
A spot on the Olympic team?
Yes, that's just what seniors
Chris Berka and Tony Sandoval
are seeking tomorrow at the U.S.
Olympic Marathon Trials in
Eugene, Ore. They will be com
peting with 70 of America's
finest distance runners for one of
three spots that will send them to
Montreal to represent the United
States in the 21st Olympiad.
Tomorrow's field begins its
assault on the 26-mile, 385-yard
distance at 4:30, the same time
the marathon is scheduled to be
run in Montreal.
Berka sat out this year's track
season to concentrate solely on
training for the marathon trials.
A veteran runner from Los Altos,
he ran a 2:22:09 marathon to -
qualify for tomorrow's trials.
Sandoval, dubbed the New
Mexican Flash, has recently
been grabbing headlines for his
upset win in the Pacific-8 10,000
meter championship. He qual
ified for the trials in his first-ever
marathon, a 2:19:35 running of
the Fiesta Bowl Marathon last
December in Scottsdale, Ariz.
The two are up against some of
the best in the world tomorrow.
Runner's World said, "To list

this as the best marathon in U.S
history is an understatement."
Tomorrow's race will include
1972 Olympic gold medalist
Frank Shorter. Joining Shorter as
co-favorite will be Bill Rodgers,
winner of the 1975 Boston
Marathon in the fist sub-2:10:00
marathon ever run by an Ameri
can. Tomorrow is the first time
the two have run head-to-head.
Joe Henderson, editor of Run
ner's World and the marathon
trials chairman, said "Sandoval
is one of a dozen who could slip
into that third spot. He will have
the most track speed of anyone
there. Nooneelsecan run 1:51 in
the 800 (meters)."
Sandoval explained, "I have to
be careful between the 13th and

18th miles. Last time, I ran them
at a five minute pace and it took
it out of me at the end."
Stanford's Jack Bellah and Roy
Kissin are also competing in
Eugene this weekend. Bellah
and Kissin are in Oregon for the
annual Twilight Meet. Bellah
will be after the school record in
the 3000 meter steeplechase. He
came within a second of the re
cord last week during the Pac-8

finals in Berkeley. Kissin will
run the 5000 meters.
Two other Stanford athletes,
James Lofton and John Foster,
are remaining in state to com
pete in the California Relays in
Modesto. Lofton is seeking to
meet the NCAA qualifying mark
of 25-0 in the long jump. Foster
is running the high hurdles and
will try to lower his personal
best of 13.9.
