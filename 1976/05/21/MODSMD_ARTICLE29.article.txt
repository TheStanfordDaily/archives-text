# Men golfers take second at Reno
## 
### Chris Kamel 
"1 was just standing there,"
said a still unbelieving men's
golfer Mike Peck. "1 blinked, and
it popped out."
What Peck was referring to
was a contact lens which drop
ped out of his right eye with five
holes to play in thefinal round of
the Nevada-Reno Invitational
last Tuesday.
That one blink probably cost
Peck first place individually and
the Cardinal golf squad first as a
team. Stanford finished second,
five strokes behind Fresno State
in the two-round tournament
with 779.
After Peck lost his contact, the
sophomore double-bogied one
hole and bogied the other four.
He moved from one stroke off the
pace to a total of 154, which tied
him for sixth place with Mike
Gove of Weber State.
No depth perception
"It's just one of those things,"
coach Bud Finger explained.
"By losing his right contact,
Mike lost all his depth percep
tion."
While all this was happening,
however, Stanford senior Wade
Nonnenberg, making his first
varsity appearance in weeks,
sneaked by to win the tourna
ment, shooting a two-day total of
150.

Nonnenberg seemed out of the
race with nine holes to play, as
he shot a 44 on the front nine
holes of the final round. Nonnen
berg came back, however, to
shoot a back nine score of 35 to
give him the tournament, one
stroke ahead of second place
finisher Jim Hill of Fresno.
"That's experience for you,"
said Finger commenting on
Nonnenberg's performance. "He
didn't throw in the towel after
his first nine, but came back to
play fine golf."
Rough conditions
According to the Card golf
coach, the score reflected the
rough conditions the course
threw at them.
"There were very strong
winds and the course itself is
very tough, marked by quite a
few trees and lakes," he said.
Stanford comes back to play
more familiar conditions as the
Cards host Cal today. Stanford
lost 15-12 in the teams' only
other meeting earlier in the sea
son.
But according to Finger, the
Cards are a much improved team
than the one that lost earlier.
"We have settled down quite a
bit since that earlier meeting,"
he said. "It's going to be a lot
closer this time."
