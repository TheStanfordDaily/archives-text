# Econ faculty refuses comment on Foley tenure decision
## 
### Philip Feder 
Economics Department faculty
members refused yesterday to respond
to charges by students that the move to
postpone a decision on tenure for As
soc. Prof. Duncan Foley was politically
motivated.
At an open meeting attended by
about 75 students. Economics Profes
sors John Gurley and Don Harris sat
silently while graduates and under
graduates discussed Foley's tenure
situation.
Prof. Mordecai Kurz came to the
meeting briefly but refused to speak
with students. No other economics

professors attended.
One student presentation outlined
Foley's teaching and research record.
Another presentation suggested that
the department has acted inconsis
tently in applying teaching and re
search standards in various tenure
cases.
"We (economics students) don't see
how the guidelines of research and
teaching excellence have been applied
in this case," said graduate student
Gita Sen.
"All of Duncan's past research
seems to have been erased by one
paper he has written on a Marxist ap
proach. Are they (the department)
judging all future research according
to this paper?"
Students yesterday also approved
four resolutions concerning Foley and
the tenure issue. (Text on p. 2)
All but one of the resolutions passed
with only one or two dissenting votes.

There were 10 votes against having
students sit on admissions commit
tees.
Meanwhile, Undergraduate
Economics Association President Bill
MacDougall, graduate student Sandy
Thompson and Director of Research in
the Dean of Student Affairs Office John
Black discussed the Foley situation on
KZSLJ last night.
MacDougall said he wasn't "sure
how he would feel about having a stu
dent on the admissions committee:
there are problems of confidentiality
there."
He also said he didn't want students
on department tenure committees
"because of the possible bias of some
students who might have had certain
professors."
Thompson replied that the "charac
ter of the (economics) department is
determined by the faculty and by the
students."
