G.E. may sell uranium fuel to South Africa
WASHINGTON —The State Department has decided to
support General Electric's request to sell two atomic
power plants and 1.4 million pounds of enriched uranium
fuel to South Africa, it was learned yesterday.
The controversial $2-billion sale is the first involving
nuclear reactors for South Africa, which has not signed
the nuclear nonproliferation treaty designed to prevent
the spread of atomic weapons.
State Department witnesses will tell the Senate African
Affairs subcommittee next week that blocking the sale,
which can be held up by the Nuclear Regulatory Commis
sion, or even to attach special restrictions would be un
wise.
This is likely to touch off a fight on both technological
and political grounds. Some members of Congress are
prepared to argue the sale would serve to undercut the
Ford administration's newly declared policy of active
support for the black majorities driving for political con
trols in southern Africa.
Other congressional sources said if the deal cannot be
blocked there may be a move to prevent the Export-Import
Bank from guaranteeing American bank loans to South
Africa. Without such a financing arrangement, one of the
sources said, the project would fall through.
State Department officials said they saw no inconsis
tency in the move with administration efforts to further
majority rule in South Africa.
Humphrey nomination committee drafted
WASHINGTON — Whether Sen. Hubert Humphrey
likes it or not, a committee was formed yesterday to draft
him for the Democratic presidential nomination.
"Our aim is to meet the needs of the nation, not to
accommodate the wishes of an individual," Rep. Paul
Simon (D-Ill.), chairman of the committee, told a news
conference.
There are times, he added, "when the office must seek
the candidate."
Both Simon and Joseph Crangle, Erie County, N.Y. ,
Democraticchairman, said the Minnesota senator had not
authorized formation of the committee.
Humphrey has declared repeatedly that he would not
enter any Democratic presidential primaries. He has said
he would reassess his inactive candidacy after the last
primaries are held on June 8.
Humphrey has also said he would be available if the
Democratic convention offered him the nomination.
Crangle met with Humphrey on Wednesday to inform
him that the committee was being established and that
they planned to go ahead no matter what he said.
Asked if Humphrey asked him not to proceed, Crangle
replied, "If he did, I didn't hear him."
Israel offers new Mideast peace plan
LONDON — Israel is offering a new approach to a
Mideast peace settlement, calling for an end to the
Mideast arms race and a disarmament program, the Israeli
ambassador to Britain said yesterday.
Ambassador Gideon Rafael said the contents of the

eight-point approach have been made known to key gov
ernments, including the United States and Britain.
Most of Israel's Arab neighbors have refused to
negotiate on a peace settlement until Israel agrees to sur
render all lands it won in the Arab-Israeli wars.
Some of the elements of the eight-point package out
lined by Rafael in an interview have long been guidelines
of Israeli policy, but others are new.
One new element in the plan described by Rafael is a
proposed moratorium by both Israelis and Arabs on their
multi-billion dollar weapons programs.
Such a moratorium, he said, would allow the two sides
to set up a second new item — a "peace fund" for resettle
ment of refugees and development of the region.
Rafael stressed that each element of the Israel program
for peace would be negotiable, which means the Arabs
"would have the option to put forward their own ideas
and solutions" for each given situation.
Ford ponders limitations on busing
WASHINGTON — President Ford is considering seek
ing new legislation limiting the use of busing to desegre
gate schools, administration sources said yesterday.
Ford disclosed that he is considering three busing alter
natives While awaiting Atty. Gen. Edward Levi's decision
on whether to use the Boston school desegregation case as
a vehicle for seeking new Supreme Court guidelines limit
ing busing.
In an interview with news reporters and executives
from Kentucky, the President said he is considering three
busing alternatives which "appear to be constructive and I
hope will be effective."
He declined to discuss details but said the measures
were proposed by the Justice Department and the Depart
ment of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW).
NATO policy will remain 'unchanged'
OSLO, Norway — American foreign policy will remain
essentially unchanged no matter who is elected president,
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told a North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) meeting, according to dip
lomats who heard his speech.
Kissinger also told the group that Soviet leaders are
under some temptation from ideologists to use their grow
ing military strength, but he does not think the Soviet
Union is bent on world domination.
Kissinger, the first speaker at the meeting, gave his
address behind closed doors to foreign ministers of the
15-member NATO alliance.
Conference rules prohibit delegates from giving state
ments to the press. But, as usual at NATO meetings, the
ban was widely violated. U.S. representatives were among
the few who refused to discuss what went on.
