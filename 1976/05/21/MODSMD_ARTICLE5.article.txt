Representatives of the leading pres
idential contenders spoke on the polit
ical records and platforms of their
candidates as part of a program on
presidential perspectives which began
last Tuesday.
The evening's discussion was
opened by Assemblyman Willie
Brown (D-San Francisco), who has
endorsed California Governor Jerry
Brown for the presidency.
Brown acknowledged that he was
formerly "a leading critic of Governor
Brown," but said that he has chosen to
support him in light of the governor's
"noble achievements'' on the state
government level.
"Brown has the fantastic ability to
bring outside people in" to the state
government. Brown said, citing the
candidate's slate of appointed officers
as evidence that Brown has sought out
ethnic minority and female represen
tation on the state level.
Lower expectations
Brown also commented on the can
didate's view that "we must lower our
expectations."
The governor is referring to "people
who attend Stanford," Brown said,
"not those who go to community col
leges."
California State Chairman of Sen.
Frank Church's (D-Idaho) campaign,
Dr. Thomas Lantos, cited his candi
date's political experience in the U.S.
Senate.
"The presidency is not a proper
place for on-the-job training," claimed

Lantos, noting that Brown's experi
ence as governor is "not comparable to
20 years of experience in Washington,
D.C."
Lantos stressed Church's active role
in opposition to the Vietnam war. The
Idaho senator first spoke out against
the war in 1964.
Lantos also called attention to
Church's recent activity as chairman
of the Senate Intelligence Committee,
whose recommendation for the estab
lishment of an intelligence oversight
committee was approved by the Senate
earlier this week.
David Brower, executive director of
the Friends of the Earth and an active

ELECTION '76

member of the Sierra Club, spoke on
behalf of Congressman Morris Udall
(D-Ariz.).
"Mo is the man who can give us the
new perspective that we need right
now," Brower said, citing Udall's
political record as a conservationist as
an example of how Udall acts upon the
"crucial issues" facing the United
States today.
Brower asserted that Udall has a
well-balanced political record and ex
perience in Washington which is an
asset in office. "Knowing political
facts and how to get things moving
through Congress," is important,
Brower said.

Former Georgia Governor Jimmy
Carter was represented by California
Congressman Leo Ryan (D-San Mateo),
the second congressman to endorse
Carter for the presidency.
Ryan claimed that there are only two
candidates left in the Democratic pres
idential field: Jimmy Carter and Morris
Udall.
By the rules
"Only those two have gone by the
rules and are left to fight," said Ryan,
noting that "important changes" have
taken place "in the manner in which
we pick a presidential candidate."
Ryan also noted that Carter has not
evaded key issues, as many of his cri-

tics claim.
"Carter appeals to the broadest spec
trum" of voters, he said, adding that
"he won't give you something in pub
lic when he's doing something else
backstage."
Assemblyman Jerry Lewis (R-San
Bernardino) represented President
Gerald Ford at the forum.
Two conservatives
Lewis dismissed recent comments
that Ford is the more liberal of the two
Republican contenders, stating that
"(Former California) Governor Reagan
and Gerald Ford are both men with
experience as conservatives."
Ford, however, has had experience
in dealing with a largely Democratic
Congress, Lewis said, while Reagan
made some "mistakes in dealing with
liberal leadership" as California gov
ernor.
Lewis called Reagan's statements on
the U.S. presence in the Panama Canal
Zone "not helpful in terms of foreign
policy."
Ford's position on the Panamanian
issue is one in which it is "our inten
tion to willingly protect our sovereign
territory," Lewis said.
'Objective politician'
Reagan was represented by his
daughter, actress Maureen Reagan,
who sees herself as a "fairly objective
