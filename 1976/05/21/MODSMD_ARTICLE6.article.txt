# Alumni will give job advice
## 
### 
The Senior Class Officers and the
Alumni Association have set up a file
listing alumni willing to talk to stu
dents about job opportunities.
This Alumni Contact Service (ACS)
will "give undergraduates the oppor
tunity to meet and talk with a profes
sional in a field of work which they
anticipate entering," according to a
letter sent to alumni clubs across the
country by program coordinator Ram
say McGee, an administrative assistant
at the Alumni Association, and Senior
Class President Walt Spevak.
In an interview, McGee emphasized
that the service is not a job placement
program, but rather one which offers
students "the opportunity to get good
information from alumni."
She said she has received and filed
some 65 responses to a request for the
names of interested alumni which ran
in the early April edition of the
Alumni Almanac, which is inserted in
The Stanford Observer. Each response
gives the alumnus' name, address,
phone number and a short description
of the alumnus' work.
Respondents included representa
tives from 12 fields, ranging from bus
iness, engineering and medicine to the
military, the arts and onn housewife.
Lieut. Gov. Mervin Dymally's press
secretary, Robert Holmes, is one of the
alumni who replied.
Use of the service's files is not re
stricted to seniors; in fact, the service is
"ideally aimed at sophomores and
juniors who have less pressure on
them to find jobs and who may wish to
gain help in deciding what direction to
take," McGee said.
Although she admitted that some
potential meetings with alumni could
be unsatisfactory, she maintained that
"alumni are a great untapped re
source."
McGee said she encourages students
interested in contacting alumni to.stop
by the Bowman Alumni House and
talk to her. The files of responses will
be made available and students can get
the information they need to contact
the appropriate alumni, she said.
