## Senate action in error 
### 
The ASSU Senate at its Monday night
meeting voted to override a decision of
the ASSU Publications Board concern
ing the funding of the ASSU Course
Guide.
The Pub Board, at its May 13 meeting,
voted 6-5-2 not to grant the request of
Course Guide Project Manager Greg Lar
son for a $1450 allocation salary.
The Pub Board based this decision on
its policy that Pub Board funds, which
are totally derived from this year's $1, 2
quarter student fee assessment, should
pay only the production costs of publica
tions and not the salaries of a publica
tion's staff.
The senate, in its legal overturning of
the Pub Board's decision, has nonethe
less committed several grave and atroci
ous errors.
First, the senate has defeated the spirit
and intent of the fee assessment which
students approved last spring. Those
students who voted in favor of the Pub
Board fee assessment were told that the
funds would be allocated to campus
publications and that they would be al
located by the Pub Board.
Second, the senate has overruled the
Pub Board for implementing the board's
sound policy that fee assessment money
be allocated only for production costs
and not for salaries. The board reasona
bly, in good faith and in a non
discriminatory manner applied this pol
icy to the Course Guide.
Third, the senate decided to overrule
the Pub Board and reallocate the money
in a resolution, not a bill. Neither the
ASSU Constitution nor the ASSU By-
Laws mention that the ASSU president
can veto a resolution — the president
may only veto bills. In fact, resolutions
are only mentioned in the Standing
Rules of the ASSU Senate.
Thus, the senate has given the validity

of law to one of its actions — the alloca
tion of student funds — in a manner
which cannot be vetoed. Either such a
resolution is non-binding and has no
force of law, or it must be subject to the
same veto provisions in the constitution
as is a bill. It is difficult to believe that the
senate would try to make law in the form
of a resolution. By this action the senate
has shown either a blatant and gross ig
norance or a callous disregard for its es
tablished rules.
Fourth, the money which the senate
allocated to the Course Guide would
have been allocated in future years to
other campus publications, such as Real
News, Against the Grain, Chaparral,
Sequoia and Arena.
The senate, by removing these funds
from the Pub Board, will considerably
affect in a few years these publications
which are so dependent on Pub Board
allocations.
Depriving a publication of its revenue
is as effective a method of destroying it
as smashing its presses. Thus the se
nate's action would have led to an ab
ridgment of freedom of expression and a
diminution of the many and divergent
views on campus.
Fifth, we support ASSU President Vic
Petroff's veto of the senate's action. His
reasoning for vetoing the "resolution" is
sound and shows the necessary concern
for the students which the senate has
been unwilling or unable to show all
year.
Last, the senate's action, if it had not
been vetoed, would have been a tre
mendous detriment to the Pub Board.
The board's major function is to allocate
funds, and by unfairly overturning the
board's action, the senate attempted to
emasculate the board. Petroff's veto is a
necessary and welcome vindication of
the Pub Board.

ous errors.
First, the senate has defeated the spirit
and intent of the fee assessment which
students approved last spring. Those
students who voted in favor of the Pub
Board fee assessment were told that the
funds would be allocated to campus
publications and that they would be al
located by the Pub Board.
Second, the senate has overruled the
Pub Board for implementing the board's
sound policy that fee assessment money
be allocated only for production costs
and not for salaries. The board reasona
bly, in good faith and in a non
discriminatory manner applied this pol
icy to the Course Guide.
Third, the senate decided to overrule
the Pub Board and reallocate the money
in a resolution, not a bill. Neither the
ASSU Constitution nor the ASSU By-
Laws mention that the ASSU president
can veto a resolution — the president
may only veto bills. In fact, resolutions
are only mentioned in the Standing
Rules of the ASSU Senate.
Thus, the senate has given the validity

of law to one of its actions — the alloca
tion of student funds — in a manner
which cannot be vetoed. Either such a
resolution is non-binding and has no
force of law, or it must be subject to the
same veto provisions in the constitution
as is a bill. It is difficult to believe that the
senate would try to make law in the form
of a resolution. By this action the senate
has shown either a blatant and gross ig
norance or a callous disregard for its es
tablished rules.
Fourth, the money which the senate
allocated to the Course Guide would
have been allocated in future years to
other campus publications, such as Real
News, Against the Grain, Chaparral,
Sequoia and Arena.
The senate, by removing these funds
from the Pub Board, will considerably
affect in a few years these publications
which are so dependent on Pub Board
allocations.
Depriving a publication of its revenue
is as effective a method of destroying it
as smashing its presses. Thus the se
nate's action would have led to an ab
ridgment of freedom of expression and a
diminution of the many and divergent
views on campus.
Fifth, we support ASSU President Vic
Petroff's veto of the senate's action. His
reasoning for vetoing the "resolution" is
sound and shows the necessary concern
for the students which the senate has
been unwilling or unable to show all
year.
Last, the senate's action, if it had not
been vetoed, would have been a tre
mendous detriment to the Pub Board.
The board's major function is to allocate
funds, and by unfairly overturning the
board's action, the senate attempted to
emasculate the board. Petroff's veto is a
necessary and welcome vindication of
the Pub Board.
The ASSU Senate at its Monday night
meeting voted to override a decision of
the ASSU Publications Board concern
ing the funding of the ASSU Course
Guide.
The Pub Board, at its May 13 meeting,
voted 6-5-2 not to grant the request of
Course Guide Project Manager Greg Lar
son for a $1450 allocation salary.
The Pub Board based this decision on
its policy that Pub Board funds, which
are totally derived from this year's $1, 2
quarter student fee assessment, should
pay only the production costs of publica
tions and not the salaries of a publica
tion's staff.
The senate, in its legal overturning of
the Pub Board's decision, has nonethe
less committed several grave and atroci
ous errors.
