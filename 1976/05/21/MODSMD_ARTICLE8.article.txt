# Carter's record stands out

Jimmy Carter is in many re
spects an enigma to California
voters; not because he is "fuzzy"
on the issues, but because he is a
relative newcomer to the na
tional political scene and the
bulk of his campaigning to date
has been concentrated
elsewhere in the country.
As Tom Wicker wrote in the
March 29 New York Times,
"those who have followed the
campaign know that his views
are at least as clear and often
more specific than those of Sen.
Henry Jackson (D-Wash.) or Rep.
Morris Udall (D-Ariz.)." 1 grant
that this does not compare Carter
with all the candidates relevant
today, but the portent remains
clear.
Moreover, it is especially frus
trating when students unfamil
iar with Carter's stands harbor
certain misperceptions of what
they are, perceptions which do
no justice to his record as gover
nor. His achievements in the
areas of environmental protec
tion and civil rights seem to be
especially ignored in this matter,
and this article constitutes an at
tempt to present an accurate pic
ture of those aspects of Carter's
record.
Carter's concern for the envi
ronment is unquestionable; his
efficacy in protecting it is lauda
ble. The League of Conservation
Voters, a non-partisan umbrella
organization of national conser
vation groups (including the
Sierra Club and the Friends of
the Earth), recently released the
results of a six-month study of
the presidential candidates.
They rated Carter "outstand
ing" on environmental and
energy issues, giving him "A"s
on coastline protection for off
shore drilling, energy strategy,
land-use planning, public lands
policy and stands against

damaging damming of rivers.
They also deemed "excellent"
his opposition to the building of
a nuclear power plant (he went
to court to block it).
Carter also came out to
California to help in the fight to
save the Stanislaus River and he
has already been endorsed by
several leading California con
servationists, among them Larry
Moss, who recently resigned
from his post as deputy secretary
of resources in the Brown ad
ministration; and Janet Adams,
executive director of the Coastal
Alliance,
Equally progressive is his re
cord with respect to civil rights,
an area in which his advocacy
was clear long before he held any
state office. During the 1950s
Carter was the only white adult
male in his community who re
fused to join the racist White
Citizen's Council, and because
of this, his business was sub
jected to an economic boycott.
Carter's commitment to civil
rights is borne out by a look at his
record: the number of blacks
serving on state statutory or con
stitutional boards increased
from three to 53; he appointed
the first black to the civil court
bench; he strongly supported
Georgia's first fair housing law,
which in part expanded the
powers of the Georgia Real Es
tate Commission (to which he
appointed the first black in the
commission's history); he gave a
grant out of the governor's
emergency fund to the Sickle
Cell Anemia Foundation; since
Georgia did not have federal re
ferees to enforce the Voting
Rights Act of 1965, Carter de
putized all high school princi
pals so they could sign up voters
at school; and he insisted, over
bitter protest, that a portrait of
Martin Luther King, Jr. be placed

in a position of honor in the state
capitol.
One could just have easily
written about the comprehen
sive bureaucratic reorganizaton
Carter instituted, the prison re
forms implemented, the over
150 new centers for mental
health care established or the
consumer protection programs
for which he fought.
Any public official, especially
a governor, has to stand on his
record. Nothing reflects one's
philosophy more accurately
than one's actions, and Jimmy
Carter's actions have been both
clear and decisive.
