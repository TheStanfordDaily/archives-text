# Letters: Foley tenure
## 
### 
Resolutions
These four resolutions to the
economics faculty were passed
at an open meeting of students in
the Economics Dept. yesterday.
I. A Tenure Decision Must be
Made on Prof. Duncan Foley.
The economics faculty must
make a responsible, democratic
decision on tenure before this
September when Foley will
choose among other tenure of
fers. We strongly urge granting
tenure to Foley.
The tenure decision must in
clude a positive demonstration
that political discrimination did
not occur so there remains no
question whether the depart
ment's decision should be the
subject of an investigation by the
American Economic Associa
tion's Committee on Political
Discrimination and by the dean
of humanities and sciences.
11. Students should be ap

pointed as regular members to
all faculty search, tenure, and
student admission committees.
The students would participate
in tenure decisions as full voting
members, and would be ap
pointed by the undergraduate
and graduate student economics
associations. Remuneration of
students for assuming these re
sponsibilities would be approp
riate.
111. Public student evaluation
of teaching. Responses to a rede
signed course and teacher
evaluation should be made pub
lic by the department soon after
the end of each quarter with the
evaluations available to students
and faculty alike.
IV. Implementation. A com
mittee of economics students is
to be appoi nted to provide liaison
with the economics faculty and
to ascertain the faculty's re
sponse to our recommendations.

The economics faculty must
provide an indication by May 27
that they will act on tenure for
Foley before September 1976.
In the process, they must ad
dress the issues we have raised
on the criteria for tenure deci
sions, the consistency of appli
cation of these criteria and polit
ical discrimination against
Foley in the tenure decision.
If the committee receives no
response or no adequate sign
that indicates in their judgment
that meaningful faculty action is
forthcoming on these issues,
the committee is mandated by
the students to proceed to meet
with the dean of humanities and
sciences to present in full detail
the history of the tenure decision
and to request a University in
vestigation.
