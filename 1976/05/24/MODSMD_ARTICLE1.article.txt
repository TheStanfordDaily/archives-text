# 'Fun country' a real logjam for students
## 
### Tanya Penny 
Several weeks ago, 50 Stanford students went to
Great America amusement park in Santa Clara
searching for "fun country," as the park has
nicknamed itself. Although most found just that, a
few were not so lucky.
The students were trapped 65 feet in the air atop
the "Logger's Run," a roller coaster on water. Ac
cording to John Foimiroo, director of park public
ity, "one car jammed itself and caused about seven
other boats to jam up."
Cyndi Macon, one of the trapped students, said
"people were laughing and making fun of the situa
tion at first. But after about an hour had passed, we
began getting cold and growing impatient."
Donna Champ said that the ride attendant kept
saying it would be fixed in "two more minutes,"
but didn't release a boat until 45 minutes later."
Karen McAlmon, who was on the released boat,
said that the boat continued on its route and merely
"crashed into the jammed boats below and stalled
for another 25 minutes."
No communication
In the boat with McAlmon were Lisa Kuida and
Eric Hellstrom. Kuida said that there was no com
munication and that "no one knew what was going
on."
Still trapped in the air were Champ. Macon, Greg
Pieschala and John Walsh. Pieschala said that
there were about 10 other people experiencing
what he described as the "two-hour ordeal."
When the four students finally reached the bot
tom, they were united with Kuida, McAlmon and

Kellstromand, according to Pienciala, they decided
to do something about "the terrible inconveni
ence."
They were escorted to Guest Services. "We re
ceived a bureaucratic run-around. They wouldn't
give us a complaint form and nobody even
apologized." Champ said.
"They kept telling us there was nothing we can
do about it," Walsh said. But "we persisted, and4s
minutes later we were given forms and allowed to
see Vanessa Winston in the Guest Services Depart
ment," he said.
Pieschala described Winston as "flippant and not
at all nice."
Charm said that Winston told them "she just
didn't need all this" — referring to the incident.
Comment
Commenting on the conversation, Winston said,
"1 probably said something like that, but there was
nothing 1 could do about it at the time."
Champ said that while the students were trying
to get reimbursed for the tickets, "we were pushed
aside" so that an older couple's complaint could be
heard.
"I felt that we were gypped because we're
younger and weren't dressed as well and didn't
look as sophisticated," Kuida said. She said that the
personnel were "incapable of handling a crisis-type
situation."
Poimiroo said that Winston "would be talked to
by her superiors." He said that the students have
now been sent letters of apology and complimen
tary tickets.

General reaction to the park is mixed.
Debbie Foulks, who describes herself as an
"amusement park expert," said the park had "really
good rides" and that the entire atmosphere prom
oted "having a good time."
Clean and safe
Martin Treu said that "they did a superb job" on
designing the park. "It was clean and the rides
seemed safe." He said that the "theme was diffe
rent" from most parks and "unusual."
"I enjoyed the park," it was really nice," com
mented Phil Garcia adding, he would like to go
back again, because the rides were "so imagina
tive."
Leon Orr said that he thought the park was "good
fun."
"I got the impression they were trying to imitate
Disneyland," said Leana Ciannini, "and the lines
were ridiculous."
Betsy Brown said that she thought the "place
wasn't laid out very well to handle crowds. We had
to wait an hour just to eat."
'Bad' job
Stanford students are employed as park vendors,
shopkeepers and parking lot attendants at the park.
• Marsha Fong describes her job as "sort of bad." She
said she thought the employe turnover rate was
high and that she could never plan anything be
cause hours are never scheduled beforehand.
Poimiroo said that the park is only open on
weekends until the summer seasons begins, which
makes scheduling hours difficult.

NOT SO GREAT — This waterlogged roller coaster at Marriott's new Great
America in Santa Clara may look innocent, but several Stanford students say
they were trapped at the top for two hours when they visited the amusement
park. Student reactions to Great America have been decidedly mixed.

the "Logger's Run," a roller coaster on water. Ac
cording to John Foimiroo, director of park public
ity, "one car jammed itself and caused about seven
other boats to jam up."
Cyndi Macon, one of the trapped students, said
"people were laughing and making fun of the situa
tion at first. But after about an hour had passed, we
began getting cold and growing impatient."
Donna Champ said that the ride attendant kept
saying it would be fixed in "two more minutes,"
but didn't release a boat until 45 minutes later."
Karen McAlmon, who was on the released boat,
said that the boat continued on its route and merely
"crashed into the jammed boats below and stalled
for another 25 minutes."
No communication
In the boat with McAlmon were Lisa Kuida and
Eric Hellstrom. Kuida said that there was no com
munication and that "no one knew what was going
on."
Still trapped in the air were Champ. Macon, Greg
Pieschala and John Walsh. Pieschala said that
there were about 10 other people experiencing
what he described as the "two-hour ordeal."
When the four students finally reached the bot
tom, they were united with Kuida, McAlmon and

Kellstromand, according to Pienciala, they decided
to do something about "the terrible inconveni
ence."
They were escorted to Guest Services. "We re
ceived a bureaucratic run-around. They wouldn't
give us a complaint form and nobody even
apologized." Champ said.
"They kept telling us there was nothing we can
do about it," Walsh said. But "we persisted, and4s
minutes later we were given forms and allowed to
see Vanessa Winston in the Guest Services Depart
ment," he said.
Pieschala described Winston as "flippant and not
at all nice."
Charm said that Winston told them "she just
didn't need all this" — referring to the incident.
Comment
Commenting on the conversation, Winston said,
"1 probably said something like that, but there was
nothing 1 could do about it at the time."
Champ said that while the students were trying
to get reimbursed for the tickets, "we were pushed
aside" so that an older couple's complaint could be
heard.
"I felt that we were gypped because we're
younger and weren't dressed as well and didn't
look as sophisticated," Kuida said. She said that the
personnel were "incapable of handling a crisis-type
situation."
Poimiroo said that Winston "would be talked to
by her superiors." He said that the students have
now been sent letters of apology and complimen
tary tickets.

General reaction to the park is mixed.
Debbie Foulks, who describes herself as an
"amusement park expert," said the park had "really
good rides" and that the entire atmosphere prom
oted "having a good time."
Clean and safe
Martin Treu said that "they did a superb job" on
designing the park. "It was clean and the rides
seemed safe." He said that the "theme was diffe
rent" from most parks and "unusual."
"I enjoyed the park," it was really nice," com
mented Phil Garcia adding, he would like to go
back again, because the rides were "so imagina
tive."
Leon Orr said that he thought the park was "good
fun."
"I got the impression they were trying to imitate
Disneyland," said Leana Ciannini, "and the lines
were ridiculous."
Betsy Brown said that she thought the "place
wasn't laid out very well to handle crowds. We had
to wait an hour just to eat."
'Bad' job
Stanford students are employed as park vendors,
shopkeepers and parking lot attendants at the park.
• Marsha Fong describes her job as "sort of bad." She
said she thought the employe turnover rate was
high and that she could never plan anything be
cause hours are never scheduled beforehand.
Poimiroo said that the park is only open on
weekends until the summer seasons begins, which
makes scheduling hours difficult.

NOT SO GREAT — This waterlogged roller coaster at Marriott's new Great
America in Santa Clara may look innocent, but several Stanford students say
they were trapped at the top for two hours when they visited the amusement
park. Student reactions to Great America have been decidedly mixed.
Several weeks ago, 50 Stanford students went to
Great America amusement park in Santa Clara
searching for "fun country," as the park has
nicknamed itself. Although most found just that, a
few were not so lucky.
The students were trapped 65 feet in the air atop
the "Logger's Run," a roller coaster on water. Ac
cording to John Foimiroo, director of park public
ity, "one car jammed itself and caused about seven
other boats to jam up."
