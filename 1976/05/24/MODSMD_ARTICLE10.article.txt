# Delts run amok
##

James Ross Gaughran

On Thursday morning at 12:30 a.m., a group of
about 12 Delts (members of the Delta Tau Delta
fraternity) entered my room so that I might be a
part of their evening's entertainment.
Those good old boys from the Delt house then
proceeded to entertain themselves.
They tore a tapestry from the ceiling, ripped
posters off the wall, dumped garbage and hun
dreds of beer cans on the floor, threw all the
clothes out of my closet, broke the closet door,
ripped fixed cushions off a window seat, knocked
over a table and tore pictures and a pad off the
door. I was then pulled out from hiding behind
my pillow and dragged to the floor.
These great guys seemed intent on continuing
their celebration when another Delt, despite all
the fun we were having, decided to save his
newly elected Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) pres
idential neck by looking wormed and sayingthey
shouldn't break anything. This seemed to take all
the fun out of the party, so they left.
Now, this is all well and good, and the Univer
sity will probably tell me to chalk it up as just
another part of my Stanford experience. But what
1 find hard to understand is their warm-up act.

Those same fun-loving Dults knocked over
bikes in front of the house, tossed furniture
around the house, stole equipment from the pool
table, emptied a garbage can on the third floor
carpet, destroyed a potted plant, put a hole a foot
across in the wall and emptied the house fire
extinguishers into my room and the rest of the
first, second and third floors. Of course, they
couldn't just take the extinguishers off their hol
ders, they had to rip one out of the wall.
Then to add insult to injury, our quick-witted
police took my name and told us that there was
really nothing we could do. When the officer was
told that the same people who had trashed the
house were across the street, he mumbled some
thing about someone not having a light on his
bicycle on the other side of the campus and left.
Thanks.
Minutes after Kojak left, the new IFC President,
a Delt, came over and told us how sorry he was
that all this had happened on the day .of his elec
tion, and that the Delts would pay for any damage
to the house. You're damn right they will.
