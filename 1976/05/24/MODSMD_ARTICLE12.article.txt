# Defense of decision on Foley

The Council of Presidents''
statement on Duncan Foley is an
eloquent expression of the justi
fiably high regard in which
Foley is held by many students.
His faculty colleagues share this
high regard for his qualities as
scholar and teacher and will be
saddened if he decides that he
must leave Stanford despite his
reappointment for another three
year term â€” and before the ques
tion of tenure can be resolved.
Maintaining and improving
the quality of the department's

teaching and research are the
highest collective respon
sibilities of the economics fa
culty. Ideological considera
tions cannot and have not played
a role in achieving these objec
tives.
The effectiveness of the de
partment's careful review and
evaluation procedures is de
monstrated by the number of
quality appointments made at
Stanford in recent years. For
example, since 1973 Profs.
Alexander Field, Duncan Foley,
Victor Fuchs, Sandy Grossman,
Don Harris, Karen Johnson,
Pentti Kouri, Robert Michael,
Bruce Owen, Nathan Rosenberg,
John Shoven, David Starrett and
Joseph Stiglitz have joined the
economics faculty.
Our procedures are carefully
designed to bring to bear all re
levant information in these deci
sions. With regard to tenure ap
pointments, an evaluation
committee is constituted to as
semble the information on
which the decision will be based
by the senior faculty and to pro
vide its own assessment to that
body concerning the candidate's
potential future productivity
and record of accomplishments.
All materials which they as
semble, such as external and in
ternal evaluations of scholarship
and teaching (including student
letters and classroom ques
tionaires) are made available for
study by the senior faculty. After
receiving the evalution commit
tee report, the strengths and
weaknesses of the candidate are
thoroughly discussed and
evaluated by the entire faculty
before a decision is taken.

The principle of confidential
ity in such proceedings is essen
tial to protect the rights of pri
vacy of the candidate and the
outside referees, and to secure
the moral obligation of each fa
culty member to state forth
rightly any reservations he may
have concerning a candidate's
qualifications.
Thus, the limited participa
tion of faculty in recent open
meetings should not be attri
buted to indifference to student
concerns, but rather to faculty
recognition thatthe specifics of a

given decision are not a proper
subject for public discussion.
A meeting of students last
Thursday passed several resolu
tions concerning Foley and gen
eral student input to departmen
tal decisions. Students at the
meeting also appointed a com
mittee to provide liaison with
the faculty.
1 will be meeting with this
committee Tuesday and will, of
course, be bringing the resolu
tions before the faculty for its
consideration.
(Bert Hickman is chairman of
the Economics Department.
