# Human rights rally set for tomorrow
## 
### 
An informational rally and
demonstration of support for a
human rights policy will be held
at noon tomorrow. The White
Plaza rally is being planned by
the Ad-Hoc Committee on
Human Rights.
On April 19, the Gay People's
Union at Stanford proposed that
the university adopt a policy
stating that it would not dis
criminate against students, staff,
or faculty on the basis of race,
sex, sexual orientation, age, re
ligion, national origin or physi
cal disability.
Several weeks later the
Ad-Hoc Committee on Human
Rights was formed. The commit
tee includes students, faculty
and staff as well as members of
the Black Students Union,
Hillel, the Alliance for Radical
Change, the Women's Center,
United Campus Ministries, the
Men's Center and United Stan
ford Employees.
Dan Howard, a junior biology
major, said, "We formed the
committee to make the commun
ity aware of the existence of the
proposal and to build a broad
base of support for it."
GPU
Stressing the need for the
human rights policy, Richard
Thomas, a committee member
and the community relations
coordinator of GPU, com
mented "Even though the fa
culty may already enjoy most or

all of the protections afforded by
the policy, staff and students do
not.
"Also, we think it's desirable
to have a single, concise non
discrimination statement rather
than have a number of policies
scattered throughout university
regulations, each applying only
to limited segments of the cam
pus community," he added.
Lise Giraud, a university libra
rian and a member of the Ad-Hoc
Committee, said, "1 think the
university needs a policy like
this. There's evidence that in
vidious discrimination has oc
curred in the past on the basis of
sexual orientation, and this will
make it known that discrimina
tion on that basis isn't going to
be ignored at Stanford any
more."
Diverse support
The committee has lined up a
group of supporters who will
present short statements at the
rally. Included in the list and in
keeping with the theme of "Sol
idarity Day" are Father Eugene
Boyle of St. Ann's Catholic
Church, Manfred Bahmann
of Lutheran Campus Ministry,
and Rabbi Mark Cartun. Al To
maszczuk of the Council of Pres
idents of the Associated Stu
dents, Keith Archuleta of the
Black Students Union, and John
Lind, a lecturer in chemical en
gineering,will also express their
support for the policy.

"I think it's really great that
individuals from so many diffe
rent groups are uniting and get
ting behind this," Joel Roberts,
another member of the commit
tee, said.

Representative Pete McClos
key, a Stanford alumnus, is pre
paring a statement in favor of the
proposal which he has asked to
be read at the rally.
In addition to planning the

rally, the Ad-Hoc Committee has
also been circulating petitions
and obtaining resolutions of
support for the proposed human
rights policy from voluntary
campus organizations.
