## Gould hopes for upsets Men netters eye NCAAs 
### Paul Bauman 
The NCAA Tennis Champion
ships, which get under way
Wednesday at Corpus Christi,
Tex., mean different things to
different people.
For men's tennis coach Dick
Gould, the tournament means a
chance to bound from a disap
pointing fourth-place finish last
year.
For Card senior Pat DuPre, it
means a chance to make up for
lost time. DuPre hasn't played in
the NCAAs since his freshman
year because of tendonitis in his
right wrist.
For Card captain Mark Mitch
ell, it means an opportunity to
play NCAA singles for the first
time.

And for Stanford Perry
Wright, the 1976 NCAAs mean a
chance to "go scuba diving in
the Gulf of Mexico."
Of course, Wright wants to
win as much as the next guy, and
maybe more, but nobody ever
accused him of having a narrow
perspective.
Second-ranked team
Stanford (13-3) goes into the
NCAAs as the second-ranked
men's team in the country.
UCLA is strongly favored to win
its second straight national
championship.
Gould says he's "not confi
dent, but cautiously optimistic"
about beating out the Bruins for
the team title.
"Anything this team (Stan-

v:

ford) could do wouldn't surprise
me," he said. "1 wouldn't put
anything past them. If anybody
can do it, it's us, (JSC or Trinity
— nobody else.
"We could finish anywhere
from first to fifth. It would be a
crime for this team, the way it
has played, to finish out of the
top two. It was a crime last year."
Singles entries
Stanford's singles entries this
year are DuPre, Bill Maze, Matt
Mitchell and Mark Mitchell. Of
the four, only Maze played sing
les for the Cards in the NCAAs
last season. In doubles, Stanford
will go with the teams of
DuPre-Maze and Matt
Mitchell-Wright.
Gould declared what his team
would have to do to win the
tournament, which fields 128
singles players and 64 doubles
teams.
"Bill and Pat are going to have
to do at least as well as they are
supposed to. And Mark and Matt
are going to have to knock some
body off."
There are some facts indicat
ing that Stanford is capable of
going all the way:
—Matt Mitchell defeated
USC's Bruce Manson, who will
probably be seeded second or
third in the NCAAs, in straight
sets two weekends ago in the
UCLA Invitational.
—Mark Mitchell, No. 4 for
Stanford, came within two
games of beating Peter Fleming,
who will almost certainly be the
NCAA first seed, at UCLA.
—Matt Mitchell and Wright
have beaten the top-ranked taam
in college, Fleming and Brian
Teacher of UCLA, and, for that
matter, pros Tom Okker and
Frew McMillan, a couple of the
best doubles players in the
world.
—When he's on his game,

Maze can beat anyone in college
tennis, as he proved when he
wiped out Teacher in April.
—Stanford came within two
games in the deciding ninth
match of beating UCLA in
Maples Pavilion.
Adverse weather
The Cards may also be aided
by adverse weather conditions
in Corpus Christi. This friendly
coastal community is well
known for its heat, humidity and
gale-force wind. Rumor has it
that next year the NCAA is going
to move the championships to
Jakarta during monsoon season.
Mark Mitchell explained that
Stanford may be able to adjust to
the Corpus Christi weather a lit
tle easier than the Bruins be
cause the Card men are generally
more willing to stay back and
slug the ball from the baseline.
Fleming and Teacher, on the
other hand, are big hitters who
have had trouble in the wind be
fore.
Mitchell said the wind "to
tally equalizes" the tourna
ment. The result is a lot of up
sets. Last year, defending singles
and doubles champion John
Whitlinger and four-time All
- Jim Delaney, both of
Stanford, were knocked out be
fore the quarterfinals by tennis
immortals DaleOgdenand Fran
cisco Conzales, respectively.
It shouldn't be surprising,
then, that Mitchell considers the
opening rounds of the NCAAs
critical for Stanford.
"I think the key will be if
everybody is still in (the tour
nament) after the first day. You
get rid of the shakiness and the
guys you don't know."
If Stanford isn't able to score a
few upsets this week, instead of
suffer them, Perry Wright may
get to frolic in the gulf a bit
sooner than he'd like.
