# Sandoval takes 4th
## Baron runner will be Olympic alternate 
### Bruce Anderson 
Another near miss was all
Stanford trackman Tony San
doval could come up with
Saturday when he tried to beat
out former Robber Baron runner
I )on Kardong, this time for a spot
on the U.S. Olympic team.
Sandoval finished fourth in
the U.S. Olympic Marathon
trials in Eugene, Ore., as the first
three finished —including third
place Kardong — qualified for
the Olympics. Sandoval will be
an alternate for the team.
During the last two seasons,
Sandoval has also moved to sec
ond on the school's list of all
time three and six milers —be-
hind No. 1 Kardong.
As expected, defending
Olympic gold medalist Frank
Shorter and Boston Marathon
record holder Bill Rodgers cap
tured the top two places. It was
the battle for third between Kar
dong and Sandoval which
caused surprise.
Robber Baron cross country
coach Marshall Clark said,
"Sandy looked real good at 15
miles. He made his move at 18
miles and was sixth when they
announced the positions at 20
miles.
"The next time they an
nounced positions Shorter and
Rodgers were leading and then
thev announced Sandoval was

in third. Don passed Sandy at 23
miles. It crushed him when he
(Kardong) passed."
Shorter crossed the tape at
2:11:51.1, with Rodgers seven
seconds back.
Kardong was two minutes
back at 2:13:54. And Sandoval
became only the 12th American
ever to run under 2:15 when he
crossed the finish at 2:14:58.
Clark said that Sandoval "is a
very disappointed young man. It
was a very hard thing to take,
being that close."
Stanford senior Chris Beka ran
impressively in the trials, plac
ing 2 Ist among the 70 who
started the race and the 49 who
finished with a time of 2:22:50.
Senior Jack Bellah also made
the trip to Eugene. Bellah ran in
the annual Twilight Meet while
the marathon was in mid-course.
His trip north was rewarded
with a school record, 8:58.4 in
the 3000 meter steeplechase.
And while Bellah was setting
one school record in Oregon,
John Foster remained in Califor
nia to tie another. The senior
from Los Altos matched the re
cord of 13.7 set by Rick Tipton in
1971 as he finished fourth in the
110 meter high hurdles at the
California Relays in Modesto.
Sophomore James Lofton
leapt a lifetime best of 25-7 to
place third in the long jump at

Modesto. His markqualifiedhim
to jump in the NCAA and AAU
championships, as well as in the
Olympic track and field trials
next month in Eugene.
"I concentrated on more speed
down the runway," Lofton said.
"I think that made the main dif
ferences in my jumps."

Kardong was two minutes
back at 2:13:54. And Sandoval
became only the 12th American
ever to run under 2:15 when he
crossed the finish at 2:14:58.
Clark said that Sandoval "is a
very disappointed young man. It
was a very hard thing to take,
being that close."
Stanford senior Chris Beka ran
impressively in the trials, plac
ing 2 Ist among the 70 who
started the race and the 49 who
finished with a time of 2:22:50.
Senior Jack Bellah also made
the trip to Eugene. Bellah ran in
the annual Twilight Meet while
the marathon was in mid-course.
His trip north was rewarded
with a school record, 8:58.4 in
the 3000 meter steeplechase.
And while Bellah was setting
one school record in Oregon,
John Foster remained in Califor
nia to tie another. The senior
from Los Altos matched the re
cord of 13.7 set by Rick Tipton in
1971 as he finished fourth in the
110 meter high hurdles at the
California Relays in Modesto.
Sophomore James Lofton
leapt a lifetime best of 25-7 to
place third in the long jump at

Modesto. His markqualifiedhim
to jump in the NCAA and AAU
championships, as well as in the
Olympic track and field trials
next month in Eugene.
"I concentrated on more speed
down the runway," Lofton said.
"I think that made the main dif
ferences in my jumps."
Another near miss was all
Stanford trackman Tony San
doval could come up with
Saturday when he tried to beat
out former Robber Baron runner
I )on Kardong, this time for a spot
on the U.S. Olympic team.
Sandoval finished fourth in
the U.S. Olympic Marathon
trials in Eugene, Ore., as the first
three finished —including third
place Kardong — qualified for
the Olympics. Sandoval will be
an alternate for the team.
During the last two seasons,
Sandoval has also moved to sec
ond on the school's list of all
time three and six milers —be-
hind No. 1 Kardong.
As expected, defending
Olympic gold medalist Frank
Shorter and Boston Marathon
record holder Bill Rodgers cap
tured the top two places. It was
the battle for third between Kar
dong and Sandoval which
caused surprise.
Robber Baron cross country
coach Marshall Clark said,
"Sandy looked real good at 15
miles. He made his move at 18
miles and was sixth when they
announced the positions at 20
miles.
"The next time they an
nounced positions Shorter and
Rodgers were leading and then
thev announced Sandoval was

in third. Don passed Sandy at 23
miles. It crushed him when he
(Kardong) passed."
Shorter crossed the tape at
2:11:51.1, with Rodgers seven
seconds back.
