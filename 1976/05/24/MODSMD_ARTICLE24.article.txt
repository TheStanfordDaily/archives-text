### 
Paced by a 75 from Mike Peck,
the men's varsity and JY golf
teams combined to beat a team
from the San Francisco Golf and
Country Club on Friday, 32V2-
2V/2.
Other varsity scores were
Glenn Goethals, 77; Bruce
McDonald, 78; Jay Johnston,
79; Wade Nonnenberg, 80; and
Kim Cater, 83.
"It was really windy." Peck
said, explaining the high scores.
His was three over par.
The Cards were scheduled to
play UC-Berkeley on Friday, but.
Finger said, the match was for
feited to Stanford when an
employe of Cal's home country
club called Friday afternoon to
say the Bears would not be play
ing.
Flabbbergasted
"They (Cal) never did explain
why they didn't show up,"
Finger said. "I've never had any
thing like this happen before. 1
was really flabbergasted."
In the match against San Fran
cisco, Peck played against San
Francisco's Sandy Tatum. Peck
tied the front nine, then won the
back nine as he birdied the last
two holes. Tatum closed with a
79.
Finger stressed that the match
was "a friendly thing."
The match also represented

the first leg of a six round playoff
to determine which Cards will
be playing in the NCAA Champ
ionships next month at New
Mexico.
Battling for spots
Finger said McDonald, Non
nenberg and Cater will be battl
ing for two spots, while
Johnston, Peck and Coethals
should have berths on the five
man delegation to the NCAAs.
The playoft will entail five
more rounds, with one of them
being incorporated Tuesday in a
match between the varsity and a
Pebble Beach All-Stars team.
The contest will be held at the
Monterey Golf and Country
c :iui).
The other four rounds will be
played during the week at the
Stanford Golf Course.
Finger said Nonnenberg "has
been playing much better golf in
the last three weeks than he did
in the five weeks before." Non
nenberg had been off the varsity
for a period. The change was due
to Nonnenberg's increased ex
perience, Finger said.
Peck, a sophomore, was the
Missouri Junior Champion in
1971 and 1972. He also was the
Kansas City Junior Champion in
1972,1973 and 1974. In 1974, he
was a quarter finalist in the Mis
souri Amateur tournament.
