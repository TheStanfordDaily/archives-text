Northeast delegates go for Ford
WASHINGTON — The Republican presidential
see-saw has tilted again and this time President
Gerald Ford is upas pivotal Northeast delegations
swing his way. He should stay ahead this week no
matter what happens in tomorrow's six primaries.
Ford picked up 55 delegates in Saturday's state
conventions to 14 for Ronald Reagan and 88 previ
ously uncommitted members of the Pennsylvania
delegation declared for the President. That gives
him a 578-540 lead in committed delegates.
More than 100 New York delegates are expected
to follow the Pennsylvania exampletoday, substan
tially adding to the lead and making it just about
impossible for Reagan to overtake him tomorrow,
when 170 GOP delegates are at stake.
There were 113 Democratic delegates selected in
various state caucuses on Saturday, and they were
split. The largest chunk, 41, was uncommitted, but
front-runner Jimmy Carter picked up 27, giving
him 741 delegates, almost halfway to the 1505
needed for the nomination.
Carter will add to that total tomorrow. He claims
he will get more than 100 pfthe 191 delegates to be
picked in primaries in Kentucky, Tennessee, Ore
gon. Idaho, Nevada and Arkansas.
Concorde will land in Washington
LONDON —Cleared by I J.S. Chief Justice Warren
Burger for landings, the British and French Con
corde jetliners head for Washington today in the
first supersonic commercial flight to the United
States —and the start of a crucial test for the planes.
A 10-month trial schedule is expected to show
whether 20 years of joint effort have produced a
money-making status symbol lor world airlines ora
super-expensive museum piece.
British Airways and Air France plan to have their
Concordes take off separately from London and
Paris and taxi side by side up to the Dulles Interna
tional Airport terminal after landing around mid
day in Washington. The flight is expected to take
about four hours at a cruising speed of 1350 miles
an-hour.
Burger cleared the way on Saturday when he
refused a request by officials of Fairfax County, Va.,
where Dulles is located, to set aside the order of
Secretary of Transportation William Coleman per
mitting the 16-month trial period for Concorde
flights.
To many Frenchmen and Britons the cost of the
Concordes, which will be gobbling three times as
much money per seat per mile as a subsonic 747
jumbo jet, is more important than environmental
arguments.

The French and British governments have spent
and are spending about $3 billion on research and
development of a plane that — with lares consider
ably higher than regular first class — is not likely to
carry,many middle or working-class taxpayers.
13 die in hijack battle
MANILA. The Philippines — Soldiers stormed a
hijacked jetliner yesterday at Zamboanga as frantic
passengers leaped from the burning plane to escape
grenades, bullets and tear gas.
Ten passengers and three hijackers were killed in
the ensuing battle, officials said.
The gunbattle broke out when several passengers
tried to escape from the plane, ending a 48-hour
hijack attempt by six young Moslems. The Moslems
had commandeered the twin-engine Philippine
Airline (PAL) jet Friday as it took off from Davao, on
the island of Mindanao*
Two Americans among the hostages were un
harmed, officials said. An American woman had
been freed Friday.
Philippine Airline sources indicated tfjere were
about 87 hostages aboard the plane when the shoot
ing began. A government statement said 18 passen
gers and one soldier were treated for wounds at
local hospitals.
A Swedish passenger, Max Heuttner, was re
ported in critical condition.
The battle blazed suddenly after tense negotia
tions between the hijackers and military officials
who were refusing all demands. The nose wheels of
the plane had been deflated to keep it from taking
off.
Rightists warn of communism
BONN, West Germany — The growing strength
of the Communist parties of Italy and France has
been injected into the early stages of West Ger
many's national election campaign.
The Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the con
servative opposition party which hopes to regain
power from Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's Social
Democratic Party (SPU) in October, raised the spec
ter of a Communist threat at home to match the old
threat from the East and a neweroneseen approach
ing from the West.
The slogan chosen by the CDU for their congress
this week is: "Out of love for Germany — freedom
instead of socialism." The conservatives charge
that Marxist factions are gaining power within the
SPD.
Critics from several parties said the CDU slogan
brings back memories of the super-nationalism of
the early 1930s and plays on fears of communism
and inflation.

Although West Germans now have the lowest
inflation rate in Western Europe — 5.4 percent —
they are haunted by the inflation that befell them
after two world wars. Unemployment has topped
the million mark for more than a year, although it
has dropped in recent months.
Schmidt, who is in the right wing of his party and
governs in coalition with the Free Democrats, ac
cused the opposition headed by Helmut Kohl of
posing a "phony alternative" and of attempting to
"manipulate" the electorate into confusing the
democratic socialism of his SPD with the com
munism ol East Germany.
The chancellor claimed the Marxist upsurge in
Italy, France, Portugal and Spain is the result of
decades of conservative or reactionary rule.
France may send troops to Lebanon
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Moslems and Christians
fought on in Lebanon yesterday with heavy artil
lery duels in the north and east and machine gun
exchanges in the capital despite peacemaking ef
forts.
A French proposal to send several thousand
French soldiers into Lebanon to try to police a
cease-fire was denounced by leaders in Libya and
Kuwait and an Israeli newspaper.
Libyan chieftain Col. Moammer Khadafy, on an
official visit to the Mediterranean island of Malta,
said on television, "the French are committing a
violent military intervention in an Arab country."
The Kuwaiti state minister, Abdul Aziz Hussein,
said the French should stay out and the Lebanese
should settle the conflict by themselves.
Maariv, a major newspaper Aviv, charged
that the French offer could be an attempt by Paris
"to gain a foothold in the Middle East."
An editorial said France "is not anxiousabout the
existence of Lebanon, or the peace of the Christian
community there . . . but Paris apparently hopes
that in the race between the two superpowers
America and Russia for influence in the Middle
East it can also earn a few crumbs."
Police in Beirut reported 45 persons were killed
in scattered fighting along the front lines. The 14-
month civil war has taken more than 25,000 lives by
official estimates.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow but patchy morn
ing cloudiness. Little temperature change. Lows in
the mid 40s to low 50s. Highs in the upper 60s and
70s. Winds mostly northwest 10 to 20 mph after

ter of a Communist threat at home to match the old
threat from the East and a neweroneseen approach
ing from the West.
The slogan chosen by the CDU for their congress
this week is: "Out of love for Germany — freedom
instead of socialism." The conservatives charge
that Marxist factions are gaining power within the
SPD.
Critics from several parties said the CDU slogan
brings back memories of the super-nationalism of
the early 1930s and plays on fears of communism
and inflation.

Although West Germans now have the lowest
inflation rate in Western Europe — 5.4 percent —
they are haunted by the inflation that befell them
after two world wars. Unemployment has topped
the million mark for more than a year, although it
has dropped in recent months.
Schmidt, who is in the right wing of his party and
governs in coalition with the Free Democrats, ac
cused the opposition headed by Helmut Kohl of
posing a "phony alternative" and of attempting to
"manipulate" the electorate into confusing the
democratic socialism of his SPD with the com
munism ol East Germany.
The chancellor claimed the Marxist upsurge in
Italy, France, Portugal and Spain is the result of
decades of conservative or reactionary rule.
France may send troops to Lebanon
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Moslems and Christians
fought on in Lebanon yesterday with heavy artil
lery duels in the north and east and machine gun
exchanges in the capital despite peacemaking ef
forts.
A French proposal to send several thousand
French soldiers into Lebanon to try to police a
cease-fire was denounced by leaders in Libya and
Kuwait and an Israeli newspaper.
Libyan chieftain Col. Moammer Khadafy, on an
official visit to the Mediterranean island of Malta,
said on television, "the French are committing a
violent military intervention in an Arab country."
The Kuwaiti state minister, Abdul Aziz Hussein,
said the French should stay out and the Lebanese
should settle the conflict by themselves.
Maariv, a major newspaper Aviv, charged
that the French offer could be an attempt by Paris
"to gain a foothold in the Middle East."
An editorial said France "is not anxiousabout the
existence of Lebanon, or the peace of the Christian
community there . . . but Paris apparently hopes
that in the race between the two superpowers
America and Russia for influence in the Middle
East it can also earn a few crumbs."
Police in Beirut reported 45 persons were killed
in scattered fighting along the front lines. The 14-
month civil war has taken more than 25,000 lives by
official estimates.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow but patchy morn
ing cloudiness. Little temperature change. Lows in
the mid 40s to low 50s. Highs in the upper 60s and
70s. Winds mostly northwest 10 to 20 mph after
noons.
Northeast delegates go for Ford
WASHINGTON — The Republican presidential
see-saw has tilted again and this time President
Gerald Ford is upas pivotal Northeast delegations
swing his way. He should stay ahead this week no
matter what happens in tomorrow's six primaries.
Ford picked up 55 delegates in Saturday's state
conventions to 14 for Ronald Reagan and 88 previ
ously uncommitted members of the Pennsylvania
delegation declared for the President. That gives
him a 578-540 lead in committed delegates.
More than 100 New York delegates are expected
to follow the Pennsylvania exampletoday, substan
tially adding to the lead and making it just about
impossible for Reagan to overtake him tomorrow,
when 170 GOP delegates are at stake.
There were 113 Democratic delegates selected in
various state caucuses on Saturday, and they were
split. The largest chunk, 41, was uncommitted, but
front-runner Jimmy Carter picked up 27, giving
him 741 delegates, almost halfway to the 1505
needed for the nomination.
Carter will add to that total tomorrow. He claims
he will get more than 100 pfthe 191 delegates to be
picked in primaries in Kentucky, Tennessee, Ore
gon. Idaho, Nevada and Arkansas.
Concorde will land in Washington
LONDON —Cleared by I J.S. Chief Justice Warren
Burger for landings, the British and French Con
corde jetliners head for Washington today in the
first supersonic commercial flight to the United
States —and the start of a crucial test for the planes.
A 10-month trial schedule is expected to show
whether 20 years of joint effort have produced a
money-making status symbol lor world airlines ora
super-expensive museum piece.
British Airways and Air France plan to have their
Concordes take off separately from London and
Paris and taxi side by side up to the Dulles Interna
tional Airport terminal after landing around mid
day in Washington. The flight is expected to take
about four hours at a cruising speed of 1350 miles
an-hour.
Burger cleared the way on Saturday when he
refused a request by officials of Fairfax County, Va.,
where Dulles is located, to set aside the order of
Secretary of Transportation William Coleman per
mitting the 16-month trial period for Concorde
flights.
To many Frenchmen and Britons the cost of the
Concordes, which will be gobbling three times as
much money per seat per mile as a subsonic 747
jumbo jet, is more important than environmental
arguments.

The French and British governments have spent
and are spending about $3 billion on research and
development of a plane that — with lares consider
ably higher than regular first class — is not likely to
carry,many middle or working-class taxpayers.
13 die in hijack battle
MANILA. The Philippines — Soldiers stormed a
hijacked jetliner yesterday at Zamboanga as frantic
passengers leaped from the burning plane to escape
grenades, bullets and tear gas.
Ten passengers and three hijackers were killed in
the ensuing battle, officials said.
The gunbattle broke out when several passengers
tried to escape from the plane, ending a 48-hour
hijack attempt by six young Moslems. The Moslems
had commandeered the twin-engine Philippine
Airline (PAL) jet Friday as it took off from Davao, on
the island of Mindanao*
Two Americans among the hostages were un
harmed, officials said. An American woman had
been freed Friday.
Philippine Airline sources indicated tfjere were
about 87 hostages aboard the plane when the shoot
ing began. A government statement said 18 passen
gers and one soldier were treated for wounds at
local hospitals.
A Swedish passenger, Max Heuttner, was re
ported in critical condition.
The battle blazed suddenly after tense negotia
tions between the hijackers and military officials
who were refusing all demands. The nose wheels of
the plane had been deflated to keep it from taking
off.

first supersonic commercial flight to the United
States —and the start of a crucial test for the planes.
A 10-month trial schedule is expected to show
whether 20 years of joint effort have produced a

British Airways and Air France plan to have their
Concordes take off separately from London and
Paris and taxi side by side up to the Dulles Interna
tional Airport terminal after landing around mid
day in Washington. The flight is expected to take
about four hours at a cruising speed of 1350 miles
an-hour.
Burger cleared the way on Saturday when he
refused a request by officials of Fairfax County, Va.,
where Dulles is located, to set aside the order of
Secretary of Transportation William Coleman per

flights.
To many Frenchmen and Britons the cost of the
Concordes, which will be gobbling three times as
much money per seat per mile as a subsonic 747
jumbo jet, is more important than environmental
arguments.

The French and British governments have spent
and are spending about $3 billion on research and
development of a plane that — with lares consider
ably higher than regular first class — is not likely to
carry,many middle or working-class taxpayers.
13 die in hijack battle
MANILA. The Philippines — Soldiers stormed a
hijacked jetliner yesterday at Zamboanga as frantic
passengers leaped from the burning plane to escape
grenades, bullets and tear gas.
Ten passengers and three hijackers were killed in
the ensuing battle, officials said.
The gunbattle broke out when several passengers
tried to escape from the plane, ending a 48-hour
hijack attempt by six young Moslems. The Moslems
had commandeered the twin-engine Philippine
Airline (PAL) jet Friday as it took off from Davao, on
the island of Mindanao*
Two Americans among the hostages were un
harmed, officials said. An American woman had
been freed Friday.
Philippine Airline sources indicated tfjere were
about 87 hostages aboard the plane when the shoot
ing began. A government statement said 18 passen
gers and one soldier were treated for wounds at
local hospitals.
A Swedish passenger, Max Heuttner, was re
ported in critical condition.
The battle blazed suddenly after tense negotia
tions between the hijackers and military officials
who were refusing all demands. The nose wheels of
the plane had been deflated to keep it from taking
off.
Rightists warn of communism
BONN, West Germany — The growing strength
of the Communist parties of Italy and France has
been injected into the early stages of West Ger
many's national election campaign.
The Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the con
servative opposition party which hopes to regain
power from Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's Social
Democratic Party (SPU) in October, raised the spec
ter of a Communist threat at home to match the old
threat from the East and a neweroneseen approach
ing from the West.
The slogan chosen by the CDU for their congress
this week is: "Out of love for Germany — freedom
instead of socialism." The conservatives charge
that Marxist factions are gaining power within the
SPD.
Critics from several parties said the CDU slogan
brings back memories of the super-nationalism of
the early 1930s and plays on fears of communism
and inflation.

Although West Germans now have the lowest
inflation rate in Western Europe — 5.4 percent —
they are haunted by the inflation that befell them
after two world wars. Unemployment has topped
the million mark for more than a year, although it
has dropped in recent months.
Schmidt, who is in the right wing of his party and
governs in coalition with the Free Democrats, ac
cused the opposition headed by Helmut Kohl of
posing a "phony alternative" and of attempting to
"manipulate" the electorate into confusing the
democratic socialism of his SPD with the com
munism ol East Germany.
The chancellor claimed the Marxist upsurge in
Italy, France, Portugal and Spain is the result of
decades of conservative or reactionary rule.
France may send troops to Lebanon
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Moslems and Christians
fought on in Lebanon yesterday with heavy artil
lery duels in the north and east and machine gun
exchanges in the capital despite peacemaking ef
forts.
A French proposal to send several thousand
French soldiers into Lebanon to try to police a
cease-fire was denounced by leaders in Libya and
Kuwait and an Israeli newspaper.
Libyan chieftain Col. Moammer Khadafy, on an
official visit to the Mediterranean island of Malta,
said on television, "the French are committing a
violent military intervention in an Arab country."
The Kuwaiti state minister, Abdul Aziz Hussein,
said the French should stay out and the Lebanese
should settle the conflict by themselves.
Maariv, a major newspaper Aviv, charged
that the French offer could be an attempt by Paris
"to gain a foothold in the Middle East."
An editorial said France "is not anxiousabout the
existence of Lebanon, or the peace of the Christian
community there . . . but Paris apparently hopes
that in the race between the two superpowers
America and Russia for influence in the Middle
East it can also earn a few crumbs."
Police in Beirut reported 45 persons were killed
in scattered fighting along the front lines. The 14-
month civil war has taken more than 25,000 lives by
official estimates.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow but patchy morn
ing cloudiness. Little temperature change. Lows in
the mid 40s to low 50s. Highs in the upper 60s and
70s. Winds mostly northwest 10 to 20 mph after
noons.
Northeast delegates go for Ford
WASHINGTON — The Republican presidential
see-saw has tilted again and this time President
Gerald Ford is upas pivotal Northeast delegations
swing his way. He should stay ahead this week no
matter what happens in tomorrow's six primaries.
Ford picked up 55 delegates in Saturday's state
conventions to 14 for Ronald Reagan and 88 previ
ously uncommitted members of the Pennsylvania
delegation declared for the President. That gives
him a 578-540 lead in committed delegates.
More than 100 New York delegates are expected
to follow the Pennsylvania exampletoday, substan
tially adding to the lead and making it just about
impossible for Reagan to overtake him tomorrow,
when 170 GOP delegates are at stake.
There were 113 Democratic delegates selected in
various state caucuses on Saturday, and they were
split. The largest chunk, 41, was uncommitted, but
front-runner Jimmy Carter picked up 27, giving
him 741 delegates, almost halfway to the 1505
needed for the nomination.
Carter will add to that total tomorrow. He claims
he will get more than 100 pfthe 191 delegates to be
picked in primaries in Kentucky, Tennessee, Ore
gon. Idaho, Nevada and Arkansas.
