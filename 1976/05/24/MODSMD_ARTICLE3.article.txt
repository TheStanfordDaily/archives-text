didate for the Republican party's pres
idential nomination. She originally
opposed her father's bid for the presi
dency for what she calls "selfish, per
sonal reasons," but now is busy cam
paigning for him throughout Califor
nia.
Reagan has been a television-radio
actress for 15 years. She has been a
broadcaster for Los Angeles radio sta
tion KABC and appeared on programs
such as Marcus Welby, M.D. She says
she hopes her father's political future
will not interfere with her career,-but
predicts a November victory for him.
Defining issues
One of the biggest problems with the
1976 election is "being able to clearly
define issues," says Reagan, adding
that her father is "best able to articulate
these problems."
"When he was in Sacramento, he
brought experts from outside of the
government in," Reagan says. Using
non-government "problem-solvers" is
the "kind of system that works," she
notes, because it "returns the idea of
government to the people."
Although she defends her father's
position on many issues, Reagan
strongly advocates ratification of the
Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), a

us work on taking a fetus as early as
possible, and taking it alive."
Reagan says she agrees with
recently aired criticism that California
Governor Edmund Brown Jr. is neg
lecting his state duties by campaign
ing for the presidency across the coun
try. She notes that he has not yet made
over 200 state appointments.
"California is a well-running politi
cal machine." says Reagan, adding
that she hopes Brown's actions do not
hold up state government activity.
Reagan says she perceives Brown's
demand that the American people
must "lower our expectations" as an
indication that "there are problems we
cannot solve."
According to Reagan, "There is no
problem we cannot solve, or at least try
to solve. Our society should be one in
which there is a floor but no ceiling.
"This country is people, not things.
Let's find the people who can solve the
problems."
She suggests that government posi
tions should "all be part-time jobs for a
prescribed period of time."
