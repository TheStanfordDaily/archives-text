didate for the Republican party's pres
idential nomination. She originally
opposed her father's bid for the presi
dency for what she calls "selfish, per
sonal reasons," but now is busy cam
paigning for him throughout Califor
nia.
Reagan has been a television-radio
actress for 15 years. She has been a
broadcaster for Los Angeles radio sta
tion KABC and appeared on programs
such as Marcus Welby, M.D. She says
she hopes her father's political future
will not interfere with her career,-but
predicts a November victory for him.
Defining issues
One of the biggest problems with the
1976 election is "being able to clearly
define issues," says Reagan, adding
that her father is "best able to articulate
these problems."
"When he was in Sacramento, he
brought experts from outside of the
government in," Reagan says. Using
non-government "problem-solvers" is
the "kind of system that works," she
notes, because it "returns the idea of
government to the people."
Although she defends her father's
position on many issues, Reagan
strongly advocates ratification of the
Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), a

us work on taking a fetus as early as
possible, and taking it alive."
Reagan says she agrees with
recently aired criticism that California
Governor Edmund Brown Jr. is neg
lecting his state duties by campaign
ing for the presidency across the coun
try. She notes that he has not yet made
over 200 state appointments.
"California is a well-running politi
cal machine." says Reagan, adding
that she hopes Brown's actions do not
hold up state government activity.
Reagan says she perceives Brown's
demand that the American people
must "lower our expectations" as an
indication that "there are problems we
cannot solve."
According to Reagan, "There is no
problem we cannot solve, or at least try
to solve. Our society should be one in
which there is a floor but no ceiling.
"This country is people, not things.
Let's find the people who can solve the
problems."
She suggests that government posi
tions should "all be part-time jobs for a
prescribed period of time."

American foreign policy with the as
sumption that the United States is

"number two" in the world in terms of
military defense. She says her evalua
tion is based on "armament statistics,
negotiations and attitudes" and advo
cates "winning through intimidation."
Necessary question
Says Reagan. "We must start asking:
'How do we get what we need?' " This
is not a selfish statement because
"This nation has produced and distri
buted more wealth than any other na
tion," she says.
"How far are they going to push us,"
she asks, "to Long Beach?"
Church is the son of presidential
candidate Sen. Frank Church (D-
Idaho).
The Church family has long been
connected with the University. The
senator graduated Phi Beta Kappa in
1947 and was in the Law School Class
of '50.
The younger Church, currently a
graduate student in early religious his
tory at Harvard University, was here
from 1966-1970.
A history major here, he ran (and
lost) a race for student body vice presi
dent during his freshman year, but
later participated in ASSU programs
as well as the anti-war movement. He
even managed to take some time off,
"moving to Woodside to put my head
together."
Church, who is also a Unitarian
minister in Boston, says he feels it is
very important for his father to run for
president because "the basic issues are
not being addressed."
Despite his father's late entry into
the race,"theresponse of the American
people to my father's campaign has
been very heartening," says Church,
referring to his father's victory in the
Nebraska primary. "We feel that we
can win half of the primaries we run
in."
Victory for Church
Church says there is a "strong" pos
sibility of a victory for his father "if
Carter is defeated on the first ballots,"
commenting that currently the most
viable candidates for president are
"Carter, Sen. Hubert Humphrey and
Frank Church."
On issues of personal interest,

Church points out that his father favors
decriminalizing marijuana, supports
unconditional amnesty and would
support the Supreme Court decision to
allow states to decide on the availabil
ity of abortion on the state level.
Since he has been campaigning for
his father, "my life has been in sus
pended animation," says Church,
"I've taken sabbatical from my thesis,
my church and perhaps my marriage."
Church characterizes the pace of the
campaign trail as "back breaking. . .
Earlier today 1 was in Sacramento. 1
spent the afternoon in San Francisco
and Berkeley. Tomorrow I'll be in Las
Vegas."
