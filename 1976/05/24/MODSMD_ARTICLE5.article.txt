# Librarians may form union
## 
### Jacob Young 
Members of the Stanford University
Librarians Association (SULA) met
Friday to discuss a proposal to form a
collective bargaining unit.
The group also heard from three
speakers who discussed collective
bargaining and its benefits.
The process for forming a collective
bargaining unit here would involve
getting approval from a percentage of
the library workers, holding a rep
resentative election, getting certifica
tion from the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) and negotiating a con
tract with the University.
Joan Dillon, a San Francisco Public
Library employe and president of San
Francisco City Employee's Local 400,
urged SULA members to form a collec
tive bargaining unit and join a union.
San Franisco librarians joined the
union because "we knew all the ser
vices the union could give us," said
Dillon. "The only strength we had dur
ing our 1970 strike was with the other
city workers."
Part of the problem
Part of the problem with San Fran
cisco labor troubles is that "the people
at the City do not know how to bar
gain," she said. "At times it's embar
rassing. ... It takes a long time now,
but they're learning."
Dillon ended her comments by say
ing, "They've done it to you. Now
what are you going to do?"
It was also announced during the
meeting that the SULA's executive
board has prepared a statement of pro
test to be sent to President Richard
Lyman, pointing out SULA's objection
to the recent layoffs at the Hoover In
stitution Library.
Plans were announced last week to
layoff seven Hoover employes in Au
gust due to budget cuts at Hoover.
Eric Ewen, a representative of the
collective bargaining unit at the Uni
versity of San Francisco (USF), said
the collective bargaining unit there
was formed because "the University
became more and more reluctant to in
clude the faculty and staff in the
decision-making process."
The library staff joined the unit "not
only to support the faculty, but be
cause we ourselves had been frustrated
for several years; we had tried to make
changes. .. . We felt we had nothing to

lose by joining the collective bargain
ing unit," Ewen said.
Wanted protection
"We wanted to be protected against
what we considered arbitrary action,"
he said, adding that "common profes
sional interests" had united the library
staff with the USF faculty.
Ewen commented that joining the
unit had "established an adversary re
lationship between the two sides" and
that "perhaps a bit of our professional
dignity has been tarnished by this pro
cess."
He called for a revision of the model
used during library contract negotia
tions. "We currently use an industrial
model; we need an academic model
soon," he said.
The final member to address the
meeting was Glenda Jones, a represen
tative from United Stanford

Employees (USE).
"When you got your raises last Sep
tember, you were affected by collective
bargaining. . . . Everybody benefited
from the fact that there is a collective
bargaining unit at Stanford," Jones
said.
She also credited the USE contract
for other improvements in employe
benefits, notably free parking and im
proved safety standards.
Acknowledging that USE and the
University often have "different in
terests," Jones said, "They (the Uni
versity) don't want any more bargain
ing units at Stanford. That's why you
have the cost of living raise."
She emphasized that the librarians
could maintain some independence
from USE. "The librarians could have
complete control over its own contract
and contract negotiations," Jones said.

She also credited the USE contract
for other improvements in employe
benefits, notably free parking and im
proved safety standards.
Acknowledging that USE and the
University often have "different in
terests," Jones said, "They (the Uni
versity) don't want any more bargain
ing units at Stanford. That's why you
have the cost of living raise."
She emphasized that the librarians
could maintain some independence
from USE. "The librarians could have
complete control over its own contract
and contract negotiations," Jones said.
Members of the Stanford University
Librarians Association (SULA) met
Friday to discuss a proposal to form a
collective bargaining unit.
The group also heard from three
speakers who discussed collective
bargaining and its benefits.
The process for forming a collective
bargaining unit here would involve
getting approval from a percentage of
the library workers, holding a rep
resentative election, getting certifica
tion from the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) and negotiating a con
tract with the University.
Joan Dillon, a San Francisco Public
Library employe and president of San
Francisco City Employee's Local 400,
urged SULA members to form a collec
tive bargaining unit and join a union.
San Franisco librarians joined the
union because "we knew all the ser
vices the union could give us," said
Dillon. "The only strength we had dur
ing our 1970 strike was with the other
city workers."
Part of the problem
Part of the problem with San Fran
cisco labor troubles is that "the people
at the City do not know how to bar
gain," she said. "At times it's embar
rassing. ... It takes a long time now,
but they're learning."
Dillon ended her comments by say
ing, "They've done it to you. Now
what are you going to do?"
It was also announced during the
meeting that the SULA's executive
board has prepared a statement of pro
test to be sent to President Richard
Lyman, pointing out SULA's objection
to the recent layoffs at the Hoover In
stitution Library.
Plans were announced last week to
layoff seven Hoover employes in Au
gust due to budget cuts at Hoover.
Eric Ewen, a representative of the
collective bargaining unit at the Uni
versity of San Francisco (USF), said
the collective bargaining unit there
was formed because "the University
became more and more reluctant to in
clude the faculty and staff in the
decision-making process."
The library staff joined the unit "not
only to support the faculty, but be
cause we ourselves had been frustrated
for several years; we had tried to make
changes. .. . We felt we had nothing to

lose by joining the collective bargain
ing unit," Ewen said.
Wanted protection
"We wanted to be protected against
what we considered arbitrary action,"
he said, adding that "common profes
sional interests" had united the library
staff with the USF faculty.
Ewen commented that joining the
unit had "established an adversary re
lationship between the two sides" and
that "perhaps a bit of our professional
dignity has been tarnished by this pro
cess."
He called for a revision of the model
used during library contract negotia
tions. "We currently use an industrial
model; we need an academic model
soon," he said.
The final member to address the
meeting was Glenda Jones, a represen
tative from United Stanford

Employees (USE).
"When you got your raises last Sep
tember, you were affected by collective
bargaining. . . . Everybody benefited
from the fact that there is a collective
bargaining unit at Stanford," Jones
said.
