# In GPU fire
## Arson suspected 
### Randy Keith 
Arson is suspected as the cause of
the May 15 fire in the Gay People's
Union (GPU) office, Santa Clara
County Fire Marshal Brent Bornmann
said late last week.
Bornmann said there was "no evi
dence to support that it was an acci
dental fire," and that the fire had been
started by placing papers from a desk
on the floor and then lighting them.
The Stanford Fire Department was
called around 4 p.m. on May 15 by a
woman returning to work in an office
on the first floor of the Old Firehouse.
According to Stanford Fire Chief
Frank Jurian, the fire department put
the fire out using a hand extinguisher
from the GPU office.
Richard Thomas, GPU community
relations coordinator, said the GPU re
ceived a threatening phone call some
time during the evening of Monday,
May 17. He said no one was in the
office and the call was recorded on the
answering machine.
The male caller said, "You're going
to burn . . . (unintelligible). .. going to
burn down your fucking firehouse."
The caller called the gays "queers"and
threatened to beat them up and knife

and stab parts of their bodies if he ever
saw them "fucking around."
Frank Fitch, an employe of Gay
Community of Concern, a state-funded
project sponsored by the GPU, said
"once or twice a month we get either a
belligerent call or a prank call."
He added that this call was unusual
because the caller "knew of the firt.
before the Daily came out with it." The
Daily printed a brief report on the fire
last Tuesday.
Thomas said, "Some members of the
GPU feel that this (fire and phone call)
casts doubt upon the accuracy of Pres
ident (Richard) Lyman's contention
that the Stanford University commun
ity is no more intolerant of gay people
than any other campus community."
Carlos Jackson, student activities
adviser, said the Office of Student Ac
tivities is looking into the incident and
hopes to prevent a recurrence by ask
ing the Department of Public Safety to
increase surveillance in the area and to
encourage the occupants of the Old
Firehouse to be more vigilant.
Jackson said the office is also
"exploring the idea" of putting a door
on theGPU officeand installing smoke
detectors in the buildinc.
