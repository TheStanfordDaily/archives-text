# Brown first choice for VP spot
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — California
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. is the top
choice for the No. 2 spot on the Democ
ratic ticket among the first batch of de
legates selected for the party's conven
tion, an Associated Press survey
shows.
Most of Brown's support for a vice
presidential bid comes from delegates
pledged to Jimmy Carter, whom
Brown defeated in Brown's first prim
ary effort last week in Maryland.
Interviews with about one-fourth of
the delegates who will pick the presi
dential candidate in New York City in
July indicate Carter may face some dif
ficulty in getting the nomination if he
does not take it on the first ballot.
The AP survey found little support
for Carter as a second choice among
uncommitted delegates or delegates
pledged to other candidates.
Most of the delegates surveyed re
fused at this time to name a second
choice for the top spot or a choice for
vice president.
Of those who did give a second
choice, Sen. Hubert Humphrey is the
choice of about 40 percent, six times
the number who would pick Carter.
Humphrey's support as a second
choice came about evenly from Carter
delegates, Jackson delegates and Il
linois delegates formally committed to
Sen. Adlai Stevenson 111 as a favorite
son.
Rep. Morris Udall, an active conten
der with Carter and Brown for the
nomination, was the second choice for
about half as many delegates as named
Humphrey.
