# Reverse Foley decision
## 
### 
Petroff, et al

The recent refusal of the
Economics Department to grant
tenure to Assoc. Prof. Duncan
Foley is yet another revealing
example of the continued untler
evaluation of exceptional
educators at this University.
Foley seems eminently qualified
for a permanent position in the
faculty not only on the basis of
his research and publication re
cord (he has had four papers in
respected economic journals
during 1975 alone) but also be
cause the degree of his devotion
to students both in lectures and
conferences is nearly without
precedent among the economics
faculty.
Apparently the evaluation
committee of three senior faculty
appointed by the department
chairman, after soliciting pro
fessional opinions from nation
ally known academic leaders in
Foley's specialities and review
ing alternative candidates for the
position, concurred with this
judgment. They unanimously
recommended not only that
Foley should be offered a te
nured faculty appointment, but
also that he be promoted to a ful 1
professorship in the Economics
Department.
Foley is singular in his general
openness to new approaches in
classroom presentation and at al 1
times conducts his lectures with
enthusiasm and imagination. He
is also unique in having more
undergraduate advisees than
anyone else in economics, more
than double the average number
per professor, as well as super
vising at least 11 graduate ad
visees who are preparing their
dissertations.
It is no surprise that
economics students are outraged
by the prospect of losing such a
valued educator and are de
manding a positive decision by
the Economics Department — or
barring that, explanation of a
move that appears so patently
unjustified. Thus far the de
partment has responded only
with silence to these requests,
merely exacerbating current
speculation as to the political
basis of this action.
Direct violation
Tenure decisions on politi
cally discriminatory grounds are
in direct violation of the regula
tions of the American Associa
tion of University Profssors.
They also contradict the spirit
and intent of the tenure process
itself, designed precisely to pro
tect academic expression from
pressures of this kind.
The student boycott of
economics classes last Wednes
day was an appropriate and
hopefully effective response to
the present situation, but one
can only deplore the fact that in
most departments this is the sole
avenue for students to gain input
to faculty decisions of this kind.
However, we hope that this
particular incident — as lament
able as it is — will be recognized
as only one (admittedly blatant)
example of general attitudes
which have been allowed to per
sist at Stanford for far too long. It
merely reflects the continuation
of a sorry tradition of failures on
the part of this institution to rec

ognize and respond to the needs
of Stanford students for
educators devoted to their in
terests.
Yet, at the same time, the ad
ministration is developing
long-term plans to dip ever more
deeply into the pockets of these
students and their families in the
form of escalating- tuition as
sessments.
Protect interests
This process will end only
when students themselves take
concerted action to protect and
defend their long-term interests
wherever decisions of this
character are concerned.
Students with voting power
should be included on the search
committees for all 27 relevant
departments in the School of
Humanities & Sciences (H&S),
instead of for the 16 departments
which reportedly accept such
input at present. A similar case
should be made for placing vot
ing students on tenure commit
tees —as is done now in only
one H&S department.
Just as fellow faculty members
may be in the most appropriate
position to evaluate a candi
date's research abilities, so is it
equally proper that students
should be the ones to judge a
professor's teaching perfor
mance.
Also, teaching evaluation pro
cedures should be expanded and
opened up to public perusal.
Those departments which dis
tribute their own forms should
be encouraged to make them ac
cessible to students and faculty
without editing or abridgment.
As an alternative, students
should assist in the current ef
forts to expand the ASSU Course
Guide to courses not now co
vered, particularly those in the
graduate curriculum. Teachers
—and the quality of their teach
ing efforts — should not be invis
ible, either to their prospective
students or to those who deter
mine faculty hiring, promotions
and assignments to the different
courses in a department.

Students are in a position to
bring effective pressure on these
decisions through their course
enrollments. All they need is the
proper information, and the
votes they will cast in their
choice of courses and professors
will be heard by departments.
We support all efforts to con
vince the Economics Depart
ment to offer Foley the tenured
full professorship that he so
richly deserves, in accord with
the recommendations of the de
partment's tenure evaluation
committee. Barring that, we
strongly urge that the Economics
Department lift the shroud of
secrecy which has been placed
over this decision and clarify its
basis for the benefit of all con
cerned.
If the decision has been made
on credible grounds, the de
partment should be willing to
stand behind them openly. If it is
not so willing, then the inference
is compelling that other less
legitimate factors lay behi nd this
decision.
