# Bill passes assembly
## Health plan to broaden? 
### Ann Amioka 
A bill requiring the University's
student health plan to extend its
coverage to include childbirth costs
has been passed by the State Assem
bly.
According to Cowell Student Health
Center Director James McClenahan,
more than one fourth of the students
here subscribe to a supplementary
health plan provided by Blue Cross
which covers services which students
can not get at Cowell, such as hos
pitalization.
Assemblyman Alister McAlister
(D-San Jose), sponsor of the bill, said
the University's optional health plan
should cover maternity costs because
it also pays for abortions.
McClenahan said the abortion
coverage was instituted several years
ago in response to a recommendation
by a student advisory committee.
He said that as far as health insur
ance is concerned it is "not completely
accurate to equate an unwanted pre
gnancy" with the birth of a child.
'Elective event'
Describing health insurance as a
"pooling of the risk to cover what's
unexpected," McClenahan noted that
in recent times having a child has be
come an "elective event."
If the bill does become law, he said,
it will probably affect few under
graduates. The average single student
buys just one policy, he said, while
outpatient care for children and
spouses as well as hospitalization are
covered under an additional policy.
Adding childbirth to the coverage
would "primarily affect the cost of the
additional premium*" he said.
Larry Rodriggs, spokesman for Blue
Cross, said the premium cost would
i ncrease if maternity coverage is added
to the benefits. The amount of the in
crease would be determined by un
derwriters who would look into the
service and "estimate its usage in ad
vance," he said.
He noted that most of the persons
who would subscribe to the plan
would be of childbearing age, but
added that the company would also
take into consideration the trend away
from early childbearing and the possi
bility that degree seekers might tend to
postpone having children.
Maternity relief
The University's plan is the only
Blue Cross health plan which "pays for
abortion but does not cover maternity
relief," Rodriggs said.
Leah Kaplan, psychiatric social
worker at Cowell, said she did not
think more students would plan to
have children just because maternity
costs would be covered by the health
plan.
"Most students plan very carefully,"
deciding if and when they want chil
dren, coordinating the event with their
degree schedules, she said.
McAlister's bill passed by a 41-33
vote last Wednesday. It must be passed
by the state senate and signed by the
governor before it goes into effect. As
semblyman, Ken Meade (D-Berkeley)
had said he would call for a reconsid
eration of the bill on Friday, but did
not do so.
