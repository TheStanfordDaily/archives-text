# The 						good things about Stanford
## 
### 
A column on "25 Good Things
About Stanford" sounds sus
piciously like a story in the Ob
server. But since I've spent the
last tour years primarily criticiz
ing this place, it's time, before I
leave, to say some nice things.
1. The weather. Too good tor
Earth, especially if we keep get
ting one snowfall a year.
2. The Main Library. Not only
is the selection of books over
whelming, but the stairs are fun
to skip down.
3. The tolerence of different
lifestyles here. U.S. mainstream,
counter-minority, and intellec
tual culture exist side-by-side,
retaining individuality without
crowding out the others.
4. The nice people all around,
especially older secretaries.
5. Enough space to be alone,

lying under a eucalyptus, gazing
at the shimmer of green on blue,
wondering how anyone could
not love the world.
6. The art department, not

only for Rodin, but for not forget
ting Stanford and California's
tradition, and for thriving in the
Mecca of technocracy.
7. Stanford alumni. While I'd
like to throw a rotten egg at every
car with an Indian sticker, most
alumni are great people, willing
to help students.
8. The efficiency and courte
ous treatment given by the Fi
nancial Aids Office. 1 may be
broke, but I'm not mad at them.
9. Tresidder Union. It's still
not the most exciting place, but
it's a lot better than when I came
here, thanks to good manage
ment.
10. The architecture of the
older buildings on campus. The
Knoll. Memorial Church,
Lagunita . . . Will better struc
tures ever be built?
11. Computer science freaks,
for having a sense of humor as
well as genius. It would be a
shame if stodgy people were
going to run our lives.
12. The adequate space given
student publications at this
school. Most college publica
tions run out of a broom closet:
thanks to Tom Storke, ours
don't.
13. Trustworthy dope dealers.
We're still alive.
14. The University's anti-auto
policy. I don't like the impossi
bility of parking, but it's rela
tively safe to walk or bicycle.
15. Richard Thomas and the
Cay People's Union, for daring
to fight.

16. The commitment of the
Athletic Department to women's
sports. Women athletes may not
be equal, but Stanford treats
them better than just about any
one else.
17. The Overseas Studies
program, and Mark Mancall for
struggling to keep it going
against massive odds.
18. All the good pizza places.
Also the bars.
19. Gadflies at the University.
USE President )im Berk, French
Prof. Robert Cohn and Liberta
rian Bill Evers come to mind. We
need them.
20. Jack Christiansen. Yes. I
still like him, even if he is a stub
born old bastard on the quarter
back question.
21. All the students trying to
keep political action alive in a
time of apathy, among them
members of ARC, SCOPE, the
Libertarians, the BSU, the con
servatives.
22. The Searsville bicvcle

trails, and the foothills. All the'
horses and cows have kept me
sane by reminding me of home.
23. The ASSU Christmas char
ters, for saving me hundreds.
24. Those courses that made
me read Faulkner, Rousseau,
Mill, DeToquevi lie, Dos
toevesky, Homer, Whitman,*
Camus, Marx ... 1 only wish
there were more courses, more
authors.
25. The Stanford Band. To
some extent the Band doesn't
represent the students as well
now as when I was a freshman, j
We're more serious, they aren't.
So 1 like them all the more.
I guess 1 could pair this list
with 25 things I don't like about
Stanford. But why? I've joined
enough crusades. Sometimes it's
better just to enjoy.

A column on "25 Good Things
About Stanford" sounds sus
piciously like a story in the Ob
server. But since I've spent the
last tour years primarily criticiz
ing this place, it's time, before I
leave, to say some nice things.
1. The weather. Too good tor
Earth, especially if we keep get
ting one snowfall a year.
2. The Main Library. Not only
is the selection of books over
whelming, but the stairs are fun
to skip down.
3. The tolerence of different
lifestyles here. U.S. mainstream,
counter-minority, and intellec
tual culture exist side-by-side,
retaining individuality without
crowding out the others.
4. The nice people all around,
especially older secretaries.
5. Enough space to be alone,

lying under a eucalyptus, gazing
at the shimmer of green on blue,
wondering how anyone could
not love the world.
6. The art department, not

only for Rodin, but for not forget
ting Stanford and California's
tradition, and for thriving in the
Mecca of technocracy.
7. Stanford alumni. While I'd
like to throw a rotten egg at every
car with an Indian sticker, most
alumni are great people, willing
to help students.
8. The efficiency and courte
ous treatment given by the Fi
nancial Aids Office. 1 may be
broke, but I'm not mad at them.
9. Tresidder Union. It's still
not the most exciting place, but
it's a lot better than when I came
here, thanks to good manage
ment.
10. The architecture of the
older buildings on campus. The
Knoll. Memorial Church,
Lagunita . . . Will better struc
tures ever be built?
11. Computer science freaks,
for having a sense of humor as
well as genius. It would be a
shame if stodgy people were
going to run our lives.
12. The adequate space given
student publications at this
school. Most college publica
tions run out of a broom closet:
thanks to Tom Storke, ours
don't.
13. Trustworthy dope dealers.
We're still alive.
14. The University's anti-auto
policy. I don't like the impossi
bility of parking, but it's rela
tively safe to walk or bicycle.
15. Richard Thomas and the
Cay People's Union, for daring
to fight.

16. The commitment of the
Athletic Department to women's
sports. Women athletes may not
be equal, but Stanford treats
them better than just about any
one else.
17. The Overseas Studies
program, and Mark Mancall for
struggling to keep it going
against massive odds.
18. All the good pizza places.
Also the bars.
19. Gadflies at the University.
USE President )im Berk, French
Prof. Robert Cohn and Liberta
rian Bill Evers come to mind. We
need them.
20. Jack Christiansen. Yes. I
still like him, even if he is a stub
born old bastard on the quarter
back question.
21. All the students trying to
keep political action alive in a
time of apathy, among them
members of ARC, SCOPE, the
Libertarians, the BSU, the con
servatives.
22. The Searsville bicvcle

trails, and the foothills. All the'
horses and cows have kept me
sane by reminding me of home.
23. The ASSU Christmas char
ters, for saving me hundreds.
24. Those courses that made
me read Faulkner, Rousseau,
Mill, DeToquevi lie, Dos
toevesky, Homer, Whitman,*
Camus, Marx ... 1 only wish
there were more courses, more
authors.
25. The Stanford Band. To
some extent the Band doesn't
represent the students as well
now as when I was a freshman, j
We're more serious, they aren't.
So 1 like them all the more.
I guess 1 could pair this list
with 25 things I don't like about
Stanford. But why? I've joined
enough crusades. Sometimes it's
better just to enjoy.
