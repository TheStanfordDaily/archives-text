naissance <uul Enlightenment"
.iiul "Romantic and Modern."
The courses will be taught, re
spectively during the fall, winter
and spring quarters and will be
worth five units each.
"We are putting a great deal of
effort into trying to make this a

successful and popular course
series," comments English Prof.
George Dekker, who was instru
mental in planning the series.
"Realizing that this may be
many students' last opportunity
to he exposed to great literature
on a classroom level, we will be
using some of the departments
best teachers."
The courses will be team
taught with lectures and sec
tions placing an emphasis on an
in-depth study of a compara
tively small number of crucial
U:xts, rather than on a rapid sur
vey of many.
Diverse views

team teaching to be successful,"

comments Dekker. "Not only
does it encourage the presenta
tion of diverse views, but it also
insures a high level of expertise
