# Lesbian feminist decries discrimination
## 
### Mark Shibuya 
"In essence heterosexuality is a way of
giving every woman a stake in male
supremacy," stated lesbian feminist
Charlotte Bunch at a SWOPSI presenta
tion in Jordan Hall last Wednesday.
"Women are discriminated against in
that we are assumed to be marginal in the
work place. This is built on the assump
tion that every woman will be with a man
and so every woman's maintenance will
be through a man," charged Bunch.
While noting that the primary opposi
tion to "patriarchal capitalism" has been
the socialist and Communist movements,
Bunch said that those movements had not
"dealt adequately with the question of
women."

I Hunk the socialist movement must
still be defined as a patriachial
socialism," said Bunch. «
Fundamental questions
Bunch, who teaches at George
Washington University, listed money
sex, and power as three fundamental
questions that feminists must confront.
"Lesbians ask 'Why do gay men have so
much money and lesbians don't?' " said
Bunch. She noted that underlying this
was the question "what should in fact be
the means of ownership of production."
Questioning why, in standard
economic analysis, "reproduction has
never been dealt with as an essential fea
ture of production." Bunch said that
answers that were not based on the "male

perspective of what keeps the- world go
ing" were needed.
Realization
In discussing the question of sex.
Burch said the feminist realizes
that "the personal is political a brilliant
beginning," but noted that overextension
of this approach had caused it to "bog
down."
"In every woman's experience are the
seeds of the analysis that we have to de
velop." said Bunch.
Calling this a "heterosexual rape cul
ture," Bunch agreed with the notion that
"rape is a means of control of women and
not an aberration."
"Heterosexualism as an institution and
ideology upholds male supremacy," said

Bunch who charged that "no matter what
happens it is not okay to be a queer in
patrimony."
Feminist anlaysis
In referring to feminist analysis of
power, Bunch felt that it was "abstract
because women have had so little experi
ence with it."
Powerlessness is "frequently used as an
excuse because woman are really afraid of
power because it brings with it responsi
bility and the need for action," she said.
"Part of the appeal of lesbian feminism
is that it is not boring," said Bunch. "1
believe we may be able to come up with
some new synthesis that will open our
perception of the world and our role as
feminists."

of this approach had caused it to "bog
down."
"In every woman's experience are the
seeds of the analysis that we have to de
velop." said Bunch.
Calling this a "heterosexual rape cul
ture," Bunch agreed with the notion that
"rape is a means of control of women and
not an aberration."
"Heterosexualism as an institution and
ideology upholds male supremacy," said

Bunch who charged that "no matter what
happens it is not okay to be a queer in
patrimony."
Feminist anlaysis
In referring to feminist analysis of
power, Bunch felt that it was "abstract
because women have had so little experi
ence with it."
Powerlessness is "frequently used as an
excuse because woman are really afraid of
power because it brings with it responsi
bility and the need for action," she said.
"Part of the appeal of lesbian feminism
is that it is not boring," said Bunch. "1
believe we may be able to come up with
some new synthesis that will open our
perception of the world and our role as
feminists."
