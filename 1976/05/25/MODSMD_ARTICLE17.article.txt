# Tennessee Valley called 'nuclear haven'
## 
### 
TENNESSEE, (PNS) — The nuclear
power industry, facing rising public op
position and ballot initiatives requiring
strict safety standards in California and
several other states, has found a haven in
the Tennessee Valley.
The federal Tennessee Valley Author
ity (TVA) plans to build 17 nuclear reac
tors by 1985, mostly in eastern Tennessee
and northern Alabama — nearly a third of
all plants now operating in the U.S. Site
clearance began recently near Hartsville,
Tenn., for the fifth plant, projected to be
the largest in the world, which General
Electric will help build.
There is litle anyone can do to stop
them. No state governments or public
utility commission have jurisdiction over
the federally owned sites. Though Con
gress could act, it voted only recently to
increase TVA's borrowing limit from $5
to $15 billion.
Realistic path
Only the courts offer a realistic path for
citizen opposition to TVA plans. Al
though the plants must be licensed by the
federal government, no TVA plant has
had trouble at that level.
Edward Spitzer, director of the Tennes
see Energy Office, says the TVA's ability
to build nuclear reactors witout political
interference will make the region the
"energy oasis for the United States."
The federal Nuclear Regulatory Com
mission (NRC) recently completed a
feasibility study of Tennessee as one of
four possible sites for "nuclear parks" —
heavy concentrations of nuclear facilities
on one site.
TVA spokesmen do not admit to an in
tention to develop an "energy oasis" for
the nation. Yet their plans call for more

than doubling their power output by 1985
— all through nuclear expansion. And the
energy needs of the TVA area are not ex
pected to increase that rapidly.
Outside service
Observers like Dr. Ruth Neff of the Ten
nessee Environmental Council, a non
partisan information gathering agency,
think the TVA's multi-billion dollar ex
pansion plans make little sense unless
they are to provide power outside the
TVA service area.
According to C. Ron Culberon of the
Tennessee Department of Public Health.
TVA's system of interconnections with
neighboring utilities is only one step
away from a national power grid.
"And it's no secret that TVA wants to
run such a system," he said. "Thus their
projections, which seem high, could ac
tually reflect a planned excess to be used
for feeding a national electric grid sys
tem."
"We're not too happy with that plan,"
says Culberosn. "Hut there's nothing we
can do."
Environmental fears
A citizens group has already brought
suit to stop construction of the Hartsville
plant. Among their fears are its proximity
to Nashville in case of accident or
radioactive contamination of theCumber
land River, Nashville's water supply.
Hartsville lies 29 miles upriver from
Nashville.
The Tennessee Valley Authority was
created by the Roosevelt Administration
in 1933. Aimed at what Roosevelt called
"the nation's number one economic prob
lem" — the southern Appalachians — it
covers Tennessee, southern Kentucky,
northern Mississippi and Alabama and

small portions of Georgia, North Carolina
and Virginia.
In 1933 per capita income in this
largely hill and mountain country —
whose rich "bottomlands" were regularly
flooded — was 40 percent of the national
average. Today it is 7b percent.
Roosevelt set up TVA for flood control,
reforestation, reclamation of marginal
land and agricultural and industrial de
velopment. Yet today expenditures on
TVA's power program are more than 25
times those for its non-power budget.
And in a region largely without elec
tricity in 1933, electrical power is abun
dant and cheap. Chattanooga claims to be
the world's most "electrified" city —
using electricity to power virtually every
thing.
TVA curently employs 28,000 of the
region's three million people — and con
struction of the new Hartsville plant
alone will require five to eight thousand
more.
Culberson is worried about the possible
ill effects residents might experience if
TVA constructs a large enough grid of
high tension wires across the state.
A recent Soviet study, he points out,
indicated that "long-time work at 500-
kilowatt substantions results in a shatter
ing of the dynamic state of the central
nervous system, heart and blood-vessel
system and in changing blood structure.
Young men complained of sexual impo
tency."
Environmentalists also worry that TVA
may go on to develop the breeder reactor,
which creates more fissionable fuel than
it consumes and creates the problem of
storing radioactive waste. TVA spent $2
million last year on the Clinch River

Breeder Reactor Power Project, a joint re
search venture of the federal government
and the utilities industry.
Guinea pig
Chris Eckle, a TV A spokesperson in
Knoxville, brushed aside environmental
fears. "If we just sit around and do no
thing because we're not 100 percent sure
of what's going to happen." he said,
"we'll be in a terrible fix in a few years. . .
People say Tennessee is being made the
guinea pig for nuclear power. But we
wouldn't do it if we didn't think it was
safe."
But TVA and the NRC, formerly the
Atomic Energy Commission, do not have
a particularly strong track record in
health and safety. For instance:
—No one knows what type or how
much radioactive material is buried in
one of the six atomic waste burial sites on
the federal Oak Ridge reservation. Re
cords were destroyed in a 1957 fire.
—TVA "almost lost Alabama," as one
physicist at the plant put it. in a March
1975 fire at the Brown's Nuclear Plant.
The NRC estimated the plant came close
to a "meltdown" — the possible consequ
ences of which are considered to include
an explosion which would spread
radioactive material.
—According to the state of Tennessee,
there has been continuous radioactive
leakage into nearby rivers from the Oak
Ridge facility — possibly from the "lost"
waste burial site. State health officials
complain they are not allowed to monitor
the radioactivity inside the federal reser
vation.
—TVA has repeatedly refused to com
ply with ERA regulations on emission
control at some of its coal-fired plants.
