## Graham Central rocks 'em 
### Jim O'Callahan 
Maples Pavillion was turned
into a huge disco last week as the
Blackbyrds and Graham Central
Station boogyed up a storm in a
concert co-sponsored by the
Black Activities Committee, the
Black Students Union, and
ASSU Special Events.
The audience was almost as
funky as the groups themselves.
The latest fashions were strutted
about the pavillion in time to the
soulful rhythms.
The opening act was Donald
Byrd and the Blackbyrds. This
six piece ensemble deviated
from their usual jazz-oriented
style to put on a show that
moved the audience's hips as
well as their feet.
Sequined suit
Donald Byrd was resplendent
in a sequined suit that was a
match for any of his decked-out
fans bumping and jumping on
the gymnasium floor. Byrd's
trumpet was almost as hot as his
wardrobe, but not quite as loud.
Graham Central Station, a soul
band led by former Sly Stone
bassist Larry Graham, capped off
the evening with a blazing set of
danceable tunes. With enough
funk to fuel a locomotive, the
Station boogyed up a storm.
Suited in an orange satin
gown, the female vocalist of
Graham Central Station, Ms.
Chocolate, was a treat for the
eyes, as well as the ears. When
she tunefully asked the men in
the audience, "Can you handle
it?", the males purred a soft, un
intelligible response.
Disco beat
Such luxuries as melody and
harmony took a second seat to
the incessant disco beat.
However. no group
can be supported by a bass alone,
so the spotlight on Graham was
accomplished at the sacrifice of
the act's general cohesiveness.
By the end of each song, the
huge speaker columns were ac
tually swaying back and forth in
time to the rhythmic vibrations.
The fans loved it. Ten
thousand hips bumped in un
ison as Larry Graham led a mass
sing-a-long led by his ever
present bass guitar and jubilent
stage presence. The concert pro
vided a party-like night of good
vibes and slimmer waistlines,
and that's all that most of the au
dience was looking for.
