# Grad council members split on use of spouse income

Members of the Graduate Student
Gouncil (GSC) divided yesterday over
the question of how a spouse's income
and assets should be computed if fel
lowship support for graduate students
were decided on a financial need basis.
In its last meeting of the quarter, the
council debated what factors should
be considered for determining the fi
nancial need of a student.
The question of increasing financial
aid to graduate students will be
worked on through the summer, and
could go to the University next fall,
according to council president Deric
Jennings. The council also took unof
ficial non-binding votes on a series of
questions submitted by Jennings.
Some council members said that as
sessing spouses' financial resources
penalized married students. Council
member Paulette Britton said that stu
dents might live together instead of
marrying to avoid the increased as
sessment. She added that including
income from the spouse would place
more of a strain on marriages where
one member is in school.
In his report to the council, Jennings
said that while assessing spouses
"could have a harmful effect on an al
ready notoriously unstable situation,"
he added that "some assessment of the
resources of student spouses does
seem appropriate."
Exceptional income
Last year the council recommended
that spouse's income be considered
only if the spouse "enjoys exceptional
income and assets with respect to the
bulk of the graduate student popula
tion."
Assoc. Dean of Graduate Studies Ar
thur Walker said there is no legal way
to separate the spouse's income from
the student's own. From a legal view,
marriage means a pooling of resources,
according to Walker.
A straw vote on the issue split the
council evenly.
GSC members also split on the ques
tion of whether parent's resources
should be figured into the student's
financial standing.
Britton said that she felt some sort of
emancipation clause should be in
cluded in any graduate financial aid
plan if the parents' income and assets
were to be used in a financial need

formula. Such a clause would allow
exemption for students in cases of
emancipation or estrangement from
parents.
Last year's GSC voted to recommend
that parental resources be included in
the determination of financial need
except for cases in which a student
could demonstrate that he has no con
nection with his parents.
Special awards
A system which would give all stu
dents on fellowships minimum sup
port with special awards for needy
students received a favorable response
from GSC members. Under such a sys

tem, students would be given tuition
and possibly some living support
funds, regardless of their financial
situation.
The council also split on the ques
tion of the best method for increasing
total aid. One proposal calls for need
based fellowships while the other calls
for an increase in the number of teach
ing and research assistantships availa
ble to graduate students. While Jen
nings conceded that the two were not
mutually exclusive, he asked that a
vote be taken to see which method the
council thought more feasible.
