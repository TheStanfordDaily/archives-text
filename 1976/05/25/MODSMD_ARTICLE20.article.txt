# Talisman: quality jazz-rock
## 
### Keith Calhoun 
Talisman. The name implies magic, a symbol
invoking the forces of the unknown, harking
things mystical. A group claiming that title has
emerged on campus recently and from all indica
tions it appears that there is indeed something i 11 a
name.
Talisman is a musical group composed primar
ily of Stanford undergrads who came together
three years ago and have since evolved to the
point of catching the eye and ear of promoter Don
Riot/., one of the main men responsible for the
musical career of Sly Stone. They are scheduled to
begin recording in the next few weeks and the
tapes will be taken to prospective labels in L.A.
Jonathan Ivy (senior, Economics), Micheal
Mcßay (senior, Biology). Keith Copeland (junior,
International Relations), Henry Woods (sopho
more, Biology) and Wynn Bieslie (sophomore in
music at Cal State Hayward) comprise the musi
cians while David Smith (sophomore, Electrical
Engineering) provides the technical expertise
needed to "balance the complex changes in
volved in the music."
Melodic
All of their music is originally composed and is
described by the group as a mixture of jazz, rock
and soul utilizing a series of "layered vocal har
monies, and inspired instrumental technique
ranging from melodic ballads to high energy ex
cursions." In their April 30 concert in White Plaza
they showed just that.
Relying heavily on individual instrumentation
and synchronized, precise timing the group gen
erated a concert that was harmonious and cooked.
Jonathan Ivy on keyboards has been playing for 14
years and was originally trained in classical piano
and pipe organ in his hometown of Memphis
Tennessee.
Beginning first with church choirs, Ivy now
plays acoustic piano, fender Rhodes, univox
organ and synthesizer. In White Plaza and their
Old Union appearance during the Spring Festival
he exhibited deft manipulation of the keyboards,
coaxing from it a gamut of dynamic sound in
rapid succession.
Henry Woods, the self taught lead guitarist, has

been playing for seven years and has also released
a single with his own jazz quartet, "Inner Flight"
back in St. Louis, Missouri. The song, "Ruffian"
has climbed to Number 18 in the St. Louis area.
Atlanta
Micheal Mcßay, playing a right handed bass
upside down carries the rhythm at times with
uncanny speed. He does not attribute this to his
seven years of playing or to his experience with
small bands around Atlanta but rather to the de
mands of their present music.
Lead vocalist Keith Copeland is out of
Washington D.C. and first began harmonizing
with a neighborhood group called the "Commun
ity Singers," a community oriented group that he
characterized as one that "used to go around
neighborhoods singing in languages that no one
could understand." Copeland has since switched
to English and also plays incidental percussion
for the group.
The band is rounded out by VVynn Bieslie who
joined recently after playing some 12 years in
New York and along with his experience adds
driving percussions and solid rhythms to the
group.
Parties
Because some of their songs are almost 20 mi
nutes long and there is "a lot of information at one
time" the group feels a concert format is best
suited for its enjoyment. "The type of music we
play can't do the regular route of playing at par
ties" Copeland remarked. "The difficulties lie in
the exposure stage, getting our music to the point
where people are familiar with it."
"We are playing an extention of Black music."
added Mcßay, but it is also "impressionistic in
that it encompasses any style that is appropriate to
convey the idea at hand. We might try to convey a
sun setting."
Talisman will be appearing at Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium this Friday, May 28, at 8:30 for a full
length concert to paint their audio images. Tickets
are $1.50 for students, $2 general admission.
Their high speed instrumentation, synchronized
breaks and intermittent jamming should make it a
night worthwhile.

seven years of playing or to his experience with
small bands around Atlanta but rather to the de

Lead vocalist Keith Copeland is out of
Washington D.C. and first began harmonizing
with a neighborhood group called the "Commun
ity Singers," a community oriented group that he
characterized as one that "used to go around
neighborhoods singing in languages that no one
could understand." Copeland has since switched
to English and also plays incidental percussion
for the group.
The band is rounded out by VVynn Bieslie who
joined recently after playing some 12 years in
New York and along with his experience adds
driving percussions and solid rhythms to the
group.

Because some of their songs are almost 20 mi
nutes long and there is "a lot of information at one
time" the group feels a concert format is best
suited for its enjoyment. "The type of music we
play can't do the regular route of playing at par
ties" Copeland remarked. "The difficulties lie in
the exposure stage, getting our music to the point
where people are familiar with it."
"We are playing an extention of Black music."

Talisman will be appearing at Dinkelspiel Au

FUSION—A group of Stanford undergraduates has formed a jazz-rock fusion band called Talisman.
The group will play Dinkelspiel Auditorium this Friday, at H:3() p.m. Members of the group,
pictured from left to right are: Wynn Hieslie, Michael Mcßay, Jonathan Ivy. Keith Copeland, David
Smith, and Henry Woods.
Talisman. The name implies magic, a symbol
invoking the forces of the unknown, harking
things mystical. A group claiming that title has
emerged on campus recently and from all indica
tions it appears that there is indeed something i 11 a
name.
Talisman is a musical group composed primar
ily of Stanford undergrads who came together
three years ago and have since evolved to the
point of catching the eye and ear of promoter Don
Riot/., one of the main men responsible for the
musical career of Sly Stone. They are scheduled to
begin recording in the next few weeks and the
tapes will be taken to prospective labels in L.A.
Jonathan Ivy (senior, Economics), Micheal
Mcßay (senior, Biology). Keith Copeland (junior,
International Relations), Henry Woods (sopho
more, Biology) and Wynn Bieslie (sophomore in
music at Cal State Hayward) comprise the musi
cians while David Smith (sophomore, Electrical
Engineering) provides the technical expertise
needed to "balance the complex changes in
volved in the music."
Melodic
All of their music is originally composed and is
described by the group as a mixture of jazz, rock
and soul utilizing a series of "layered vocal har
monies, and inspired instrumental technique
ranging from melodic ballads to high energy ex
cursions." In their April 30 concert in White Plaza
they showed just that.
Relying heavily on individual instrumentation
and synchronized, precise timing the group gen
erated a concert that was harmonious and cooked.
Jonathan Ivy on keyboards has been playing for 14
years and was originally trained in classical piano
and pipe organ in his hometown of Memphis
Tennessee.
Beginning first with church choirs, Ivy now
plays acoustic piano, fender Rhodes, univox
organ and synthesizer. In White Plaza and their
Old Union appearance during the Spring Festival
he exhibited deft manipulation of the keyboards,
coaxing from it a gamut of dynamic sound in
rapid succession.
Henry Woods, the self taught lead guitarist, has

been playing for seven years and has also released
a single with his own jazz quartet, "Inner Flight"
back in St. Louis, Missouri. The song, "Ruffian"
has climbed to Number 18 in the St. Louis area.
Atlanta
Micheal Mcßay, playing a right handed bass
upside down carries the rhythm at times with
uncanny speed. He does not attribute this to his
seven years of playing or to his experience with
small bands around Atlanta but rather to the de
mands of their present music.
Lead vocalist Keith Copeland is out of
