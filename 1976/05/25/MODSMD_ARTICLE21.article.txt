# At the Boarding House
## Goodman in folksy show 
### Tom Scarpino 
Looking like Paul Simon's
lemur eyed cousin with a three
day wood cutter's beard, Steve
Goodman danced, shook,
scratched, and mugged his way
through an exciting eighty mi
nute show at the Boarding 1 louse
on Friday night.
Goodman indirectly received
his first nod of national attention
two years ago with his song "The
City of New Orleans." John Prine
and Kris Kristofferson both cal
led it the "best damn train song,"
Arlo Guthrie whined it into a
minor AM hit, and even Geraldo
Rivera brought it a little late
night listening as the theme for
his TV show.
But this low key tale about the
Illinois Central Railway
sounded out of place with the
rest of his material. He ap
parently does it because it has
become synonymous with him
and marked the only dead spot
in his whole performance.
With his hometown Chicago
influences, Goodman's songs
fall into three basic types: offbeat
blues songs like "Chicken Cor
don Bleus" and"The 1 Don't
Know Where I'm Going But I'm
Going Nowhere In A Hurry

Blues"; Tom Lehrerish folk tales
like "Banana Republic" (dedi
cated to Sydney Greenstreet),
and some casino lounge jazz bal
lads like "Sin To Tell A Lie" and
"Old Fashioned."
His vocals are clear and en
thusiastic but often,* inspite of
his clever and humorous lyrics,
take background to his fine
guitar playing. His lead lines are
fast, crisp, and intelligent: he
does not play only scales like so
many flash guitarists do.
Energy
Sometimes, though, even his
guitar playing becomes over
shadowed by his manic visual
performing. With one song he is
a bouncing emphatic child, head

rolling like Taj Mahal, ready to
burst with energy.
Goodman really performs in
the best tradition of tolk music.
He plays alone on a bare black
stage. relying on his musical ta
lents and his ability to interact
with the audience.
He follows no pre-selected
song list taped on his guitar, but
sings whatever occurs next to
him, often running several songs
together, or whatever the audi
ence calls out (and
crowd successfully requested
songs throughout the show.)
This spontanaity generates a lot
of excitement but sometimes his
leads and inter-song bridges, be
cause they are improvised,
sound similar or out of place in a
particular song.
Goodman will never become a
big name star simply because
Ik; does uot want it. He enjoys,
and feeds off, the intimacy af
forded by a small club like the
Boarding House. I le may not be a
star that populates the People
section of Time Magazine, but he
is surely worth a night the next
time he is in town.
Appearing this week at the
Hoarding House will be blues
man Taj Mahal.

particular song.
Goodman will never become a
big name star simply because
Ik; does uot want it. He enjoys,
and feeds off, the intimacy af
forded by a small club like the
Boarding House. I le may not be a
star that populates the People
section of Time Magazine, but he
is surely worth a night the next
time he is in town.
Appearing this week at the
Hoarding House will be blues
man Taj Mahal.

BLUES SHOW—Over 200 people crammed intoTresidder Lounge
to see a truly outstanding blues performance by some of its
greatest exponents. Shown here are from left to right Luther
Tucker, Harold Banks, Steve Gomes, and Charlie Musselwhite.
This memorable event was produced by writer, teacher and
Stanford graduate Dan Forte.
Looking like Paul Simon's
lemur eyed cousin with a three
day wood cutter's beard, Steve
Goodman danced, shook,
scratched, and mugged his way
through an exciting eighty mi
nute show at the Boarding 1 louse
on Friday night.
Goodman indirectly received
his first nod of national attention
two years ago with his song "The
City of New Orleans." John Prine
and Kris Kristofferson both cal
led it the "best damn train song,"
Arlo Guthrie whined it into a
minor AM hit, and even Geraldo
Rivera brought it a little late
night listening as the theme for
his TV show.
But this low key tale about the
Illinois Central Railway
sounded out of place with the
rest of his material. He ap
parently does it because it has
become synonymous with him
and marked the only dead spot
in his whole performance.
With his hometown Chicago
influences, Goodman's songs
fall into three basic types: offbeat
blues songs like "Chicken Cor
don Bleus" and"The 1 Don't
Know Where I'm Going But I'm
Going Nowhere In A Hurry

Blues"; Tom Lehrerish folk tales
like "Banana Republic" (dedi
cated to Sydney Greenstreet),
and some casino lounge jazz bal
lads like "Sin To Tell A Lie" and
"Old Fashioned."
His vocals are clear and en
thusiastic but often,* inspite of
his clever and humorous lyrics,
take background to his fine
guitar playing. His lead lines are
fast, crisp, and intelligent: he
does not play only scales like so
many flash guitarists do.
Energy
Sometimes, though, even his
guitar playing becomes over
shadowed by his manic visual
performing. With one song he is
a bouncing emphatic child, head

rolling like Taj Mahal, ready to
burst with energy.
Goodman really performs in
the best tradition of tolk music.
He plays alone on a bare black
stage. relying on his musical ta
lents and his ability to interact
with the audience.
He follows no pre-selected
song list taped on his guitar, but
sings whatever occurs next to
him, often running several songs
together, or whatever the audi
ence calls out (and
crowd successfully requested
songs throughout the show.)
This spontanaity generates a lot
of excitement but sometimes his
leads and inter-song bridges, be
cause they are improvised,
sound similar or out of place in a
particular song.
