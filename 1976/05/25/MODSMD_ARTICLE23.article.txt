Ford, Carter hold delegate leads
NEW YORK — Even from sunny Califor
nia, New York looked mighty bright to President
Gerald Ford yesterday, the eve of six more prim
ary elections. New York's uncommitted Repub
lican delegation gave Ford another 119 dele
gates to the national convention.
The boost put the President even farther ahead
of challenger Ronald Reagan for the party's pres
idential nomination. Ford now has 697 dele
gates and Reagan 541. It takes 1130 to win the
nomination.
Of New York's 154 GOP delegates, 119 de
cided yesterday to follow the urgings of Vice
President Nelson Rockefeller and the party's
state chairman and switch to Ford. Eighteen
reaffirmed who had previously announced for
Reagan. Fifteen remained uncommitted and two
didn't show up.
Reagan has done well in the South, however,
and three of today's primaries are in that region.
The former California governor ran ahead of
Ford in an Idaho poll released Sunday and is
also regarded as a challenge in Nevada.
Meanwhile, campaigning in Reagan's home
state yesterday, Ford told a peace of
ficer's convention he favors the death penalty
under certain circumstances in cases involving
sabotage, murder, espionage and treason.
"The harsh fact is that passivity and permis
siveness invite crime and the certainty of
punishment prevents crime, and I mean posi
tive, swift and just punishment," the President
declared.
Ford told a Navy audience in California that
112 ree use of the seas is fundamental to America's
economy and security.
"We and our allies must maintain our freedom
to move over, across and beneath the seas," Ford
said.
In the Democratic race, there are 191 delegates
at stake in the six states with primaries and in
Alabama runoff elections for eight delegates not
decided in the April 6 primary.
The elections are in Idaho, Oregon, Nevada,
Arkansas, Tennessee and Kentucky. Sen. Frank
Church (D-Idaho) looked like a strong opponent
in his own state and Oregon. In Nevada it looked
like the dice might turn hot again for California
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.
Democrat Jimmy Carter, far ahead of his rivals
in committed delegates, faced challenges in at
least three of the six primaries but again pre
dicted he would pick up 100 more delegates

today.
Jet mars Concorde U.S. debut
WASHINGTON — Two British-French Con
cordes brought faster than sound passenger
flight to the United States yesterday but their
debut was marred when a private plane came
within 400 feet of one of the big jets during the
landing.
Racing — and beating — the sun in their jour
ney across the Atlantic, the first of the two sleek
jets landed at Dulles International Airport at
11:54 a.m., the second aircraft was only one mi
nute behi nd.
The British Airways plane, the first to land,
made the journey from London in three hours
and 53 minutes or slightly more than half the
time it takes a conventional jet. The Air France
plane took slightly less time to fly from Paris.
Because they crossed four time zones during
their flight, the planes actually landed before
they took off in local time measurements.
Did 'Bigfoot' kidnap woman?
EUREKA — A 23-year-old woman supposedly
spirited off into the mountains by an ape-like
creature called Bigfoot was found late last night.
The Humboldt County Sheriff's office said
Cherie Darvell was found screaming outside the
Bluff Creek Resort, about five air miles from
where she mysteriously disappeared on Satur
day.
Deputies said she was taken to the Humboldt
Medical Center at Hoopa. Her condition was not
immediately known.
Sgt. Harold Reed of the Humboldt County
Sheriff's Department said the Redding woman,
who used both the names Cherie Darvell and
Cherie Nelson, was part of a five-member film
crew camping in the mountains and hoping to
photograph Bigfoot.
Two members of the "expedition," Ed Bush,
45, and his 18-year-old daughter, Kathleen, said
they were walking with Darvell along a creekbed
Saturday when a large, furry animal pushed
Miss Bush to the ground, grabbed Darvell and
headed back into the woods.
Reed said Bush, head of the filming operation
was the only one who said he saw the monster.
By yesterday, the only clues found by search
parties were a tennis shoe and some large foot
prints near the spot where the incident occurred.
Her companions identified the shoe as belong

ing to Darvell, and Bigfoot "experts" identified
the prints as similar to others found in the area
where the animal has been reported sighted.
Pope appoints cardinal to Vietnam
VATICAN CITY — Pope Paul VI gave Vietnam
its first cardinal yesterday and at the same time
blasted both rightist and leftist extremists in the
Roman Catholic church.
The elevation of Archbishop Joseph Marie
Trinh Nhu Khue of Hanoi and also of Ar
chbishop Laszlo Lekai of Hungary raised the
number of cardinals from Communist countries
to five. The others are Alfred Cardinal Bengsch
of Berlin and Stefan Cardinal Wyszunski and
Karol Cardinal Woytyla of Poland.
The selection of Cardinal Khue, the 76-year
old archbishop of Hanoi, was revealed for the
first time at a consistory at which Pope Paul
formally elevated 20 men to the Sacred College
of Cardinals, the body which chooses popes.
Supreme Court reverses Utah law
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court ruled
yesterday that states may not require parental
consent before minors on welfare can be given
free contraceptives.
In a brief order, the court held that such a
requirement, imposed by the state of Utah, was
inconsistent with the federal Social Security
Act.
The justices expressed no view on whether the
Utah requirement was constitutional but said
they decided the issue on the basis of conflict
with the federal statute.
Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justice Wil
liam Rehnquist dissented from the order, saying
they favored hearing arguments on the case be
fore reaching a decision.
Utah officials had appealed a 2-1 decision by a
three-judge federal court in Salt Lake City strik
ing down the state regulation. The federal court,
ruling in a suit brought by a Utah teenager, said
the requirement violated the girl's privacy
rights.
The Ford administration, which was asked by
the high court for its views on the question, said
full-scale review appeared to be warranted but
the decision should be upheld.
The Department of Health, Education and
Welfare said Alabama, Colorado, Georgia,
Hawaii and South Dakota also require parental

consent before family planning assistance can
be given minors under Medicaid.
Kissinger admits to U.S. mistakes
STOCKHOLM, Sweden — Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger said yesterday that "in retros
pect grave mistakes were made" by the United
States in its Vietnam policy.
Speaking in a country that was among the
most critical of the U.S. actions in Southeast
Asia of the non-Communist countries of the
world, Kissinger appeared almost anguished
when asked about the war at a news conference.
"Fifty thousand Americans were killed in Vie
tnam," he said.
"It was a very painful period for many Ameri
cans. Successive administrations, wisely or not,
felt that they were serving a good cause. They
had made mistakes. One would have to say in
retrospect grave mistakes were made."
The secretary was not completely contrite,
however, suggesting that the critics of today are
engaging in second-guessing. The war "was
perhaps more painful for those directly involved
than for those who have the advantage of
perspective," he said.
American people supported the war, he ad
ded, "in the belief that the freedom of other
people depended on it."
