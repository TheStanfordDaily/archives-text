# Tunney defends record, stresses Nixon attacks
## 
### Mike Bailey 
"There is one basic issue in this
campaign: dishonesty — whether or
not we can exorcise the lack of credi
bility in high government officials and
make them accountable," Sen. John
Tunney (D-Ca.) told a crowd of about
250 in White Plaza at noon yesterday.
Seeking renomination in the June 8
primary, Tunney defended the record
of his first term in the Senate by em
phasizing his early opposition to rep
ressive actions of the Nixon administ
ration.
Referring to the former president as
the "most fetid evil in our political his
tory," California's junior senator
claimed that his work to stop the ap
pointment of Pat Gray as FBI director
and to challenge the power of ITT "set
the groundwork for" the Watergate in
vestigations.
Tunney also stressed his own role in

cutting off U.S. military involvement
in Angola. Attempts by the Ford ad
ministration to intervene, he said,
show that "the lessons of Vietnam
have not been learned."
Distortion
In response to questions from the
crowd concerning the impact of his
principal challenger, Tom Hayden. on
the campaign, Tunney claimed that
his opponent has been "distorting" his
achievements and his policy stances.
"In my view we should have learned
from Watergate that no person who
misrepresents his opponent should be
let into high public office," he said.
In an interview later yesterday the
senator indicated that this "misrep
resentation" by Hayden probably exp
lains his opponent's two to one victory
in last week's straw poll of students.
Threat to liberties
Contrary to Hayden allegations, he
said that he has "consistently op
posed" Senate Bill One (SB 1). He cal
led the amendments to SB 1 written by
former Attorney General John Mitchell
"the greatest threat to our civil liber
ties since McCarthyism."
He said, however, that "all objective
commentators say that it has been de
feated in this session of Congress."
Tunney said that he will vote no on
the California Nuclear Safeguards In
itiative (Prop. 15) and stressed the im
portance that "weighing the future"
played in his decision. He said that
passage of the measure would mean "a
cost of a decreased standard of living
and job opportunities" and said that he
was "convinced it would have a sub

stantial economic impact."
He asserted that it would have to be
"a matter of faith that we will be able to
develop the technology to deal with
nuclear wastes in the future" and
noted that legislation for California
alone would "not make much differ
ence" in coping with world-wide pro
duction of such wastes.
Keagan bellicose
Tunney declined to comment on the
presidential election but did criticize
Ronald Reagan for'his stand on the
Panama Canal. "When Ronald Reagan
says he wants no treaty," Tunney said,
"he says, in effect, he wants war."
Tunney said that his own stand was
"supportive of the efforts of (Ambas
sador to Panama) Ellsworth Bunker to
negotiate: to at one in the same time
give Panama a sense that she,owns the
canal and.guarantee transit of Ameri
can ships."
Turning to economic matters he said
that "the free enterprise system will
work ... by enforcement of tough an
titrust laws." He said he favors deregu
lation of oil prices because "it will
probably result in lower utility rates"
by 1980.
Reconstruction aid to Vietnam, he
said, could only be considered when
we haVe "full information of all
Americans missing in action." But he
said that it was "obnoxious, if not
obscene, of Ford to pardon Nixon" and
not offer unconditional amnesty to re
sisters of the war.
Tunney's appearance was spon
sored by the Stanford Committee on
Political Education.

Reconstruction aid to Vietnam, he

TRUTH IN GOVERNMENT — California Democratic Sen. John Tunney.
stumping here in his renomination battle with Tom Hayden, stressed his early
attacks on the Nixon administration and his opposition to United States
intervention abroad.
"There is one basic issue in this
campaign: dishonesty — whether or
not we can exorcise the lack of credi
bility in high government officials and
make them accountable," Sen. John
Tunney (D-Ca.) told a crowd of about
250 in White Plaza at noon yesterday.
Seeking renomination in the June 8
primary, Tunney defended the record
of his first term in the Senate by em
phasizing his early opposition to rep
ressive actions of the Nixon administ
ration.
Referring to the former president as
the "most fetid evil in our political his
tory," California's junior senator
claimed that his work to stop the ap
pointment of Pat Gray as FBI director
and to challenge the power of ITT "set
the groundwork for" the Watergate in
vestigations.
Tunney also stressed his own role in

cutting off U.S. military involvement
in Angola. Attempts by the Ford ad
ministration to intervene, he said,
show that "the lessons of Vietnam
have not been learned."
Distortion
In response to questions from the
crowd concerning the impact of his
principal challenger, Tom Hayden. on
the campaign, Tunney claimed that
his opponent has been "distorting" his
achievements and his policy stances.
"In my view we should have learned
from Watergate that no person who
misrepresents his opponent should be
let into high public office," he said.
In an interview later yesterday the
senator indicated that this "misrep
resentation" by Hayden probably exp
lains his opponent's two to one victory
in last week's straw poll of students.
Threat to liberties
Contrary to Hayden allegations, he
said that he has "consistently op
posed" Senate Bill One (SB 1). He cal
led the amendments to SB 1 written by
former Attorney General John Mitchell
"the greatest threat to our civil liber
ties since McCarthyism."
He said, however, that "all objective
commentators say that it has been de
feated in this session of Congress."
Tunney said that he will vote no on
the California Nuclear Safeguards In
itiative (Prop. 15) and stressed the im
portance that "weighing the future"
played in his decision. He said that
passage of the measure would mean "a
cost of a decreased standard of living
and job opportunities" and said that he
was "convinced it would have a sub

stantial economic impact."
He asserted that it would have to be
"a matter of faith that we will be able to
develop the technology to deal with
nuclear wastes in the future" and
noted that legislation for California
alone would "not make much differ
ence" in coping with world-wide pro
duction of such wastes.
Keagan bellicose
Tunney declined to comment on the
presidential election but did criticize
Ronald Reagan for'his stand on the
Panama Canal. "When Ronald Reagan
says he wants no treaty," Tunney said,
"he says, in effect, he wants war."
Tunney said that his own stand was
"supportive of the efforts of (Ambas
sador to Panama) Ellsworth Bunker to
negotiate: to at one in the same time
give Panama a sense that she,owns the
canal and.guarantee transit of Ameri
can ships."
Turning to economic matters he said
that "the free enterprise system will
work ... by enforcement of tough an
titrust laws." He said he favors deregu
lation of oil prices because "it will
probably result in lower utility rates"
by 1980.
Reconstruction aid to Vietnam, he
said, could only be considered when
we haVe "full information of all
