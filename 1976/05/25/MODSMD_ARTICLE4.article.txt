# 'Course Guide' gets ASSU funds
## Senate overrides one veto 
### Lori Matsukawa ASSU reporter 
The ASSU Senate overrode last
night by a vote of 9-3 ASSU President
Vic Petroff's veto of a bill which would
grant $1450 to the ASSU Course Guide
from ASSU reserves.
Petroff last Wednesday vetoed both
the bill and a senate resolution which
demanded that the Publications Board
also give $1450 to the Course Guide.
The senate did not act to override the
veto of the resolution at last night's
meeting, the last of the academic year.
The Course Guide will thus receive
$1450 from the ASSU but no money
from the Publications Board.
Course Guide Manager Greg Larson
said that theCourseGuide will instead
take out a low-interest ASSU loan for
the remaining $1450, to be paid back
when the Course Guide is financially
stable.
Sen. Bob Ottilie said the ASSU grant
would set a "bad precedent" but that

theloan would "givetheCourseGuide
the incentive to get on its oWn (achieve
financial independence) because it's
not subsidized (by the Publications
Board)."
There was some question as to
whether Petroff could constitutionally
veto a resolution. Petroff said in a letter
to the senate that he had decided to
consider the resolution a bill and thus,
veto it.
"The Course Guide should get the
money," said Petroff, who said he
simply was protesting the allocation of
Publications Board funds by the se
nate.
"If the senate thinks it's okay to
grant money to an ASSU project (as the
bill would provide) without any con
ditions, that's fine — so long as the
Course Guide gets the money," he
said.
In other action, the senate voted 10-2
against a resolution submitted by Sen.
Brad Krevoy to urge the placement of a

student on the Board of Trustees.
"We should decide what sort of part
we are going to take in this Univer
sity," said Krevoy. "We should know
what will happen with our tuition
money. I'm not willing to let my in
terests be decided by President Ly
man."
Senate Chairman Bill Hoke said that
Lyman has "already turned us down"
on the issue of placement of a student
on the board. He added that one stu
dent on the board would not be rep
resentative of the student body.
"We already have too many students
on committees selling out student in
terests. What we need is access to the
Board of Trustees," Hoke said.
The senate overwhelmingly ap
proved a resolution, also submitted by
Krevoy, to change the "sexist" word
ing in the constitution, with only Ot
tilie voting against the motion.
The senate killed in effect a resolu
tion submitted by Krevoy introducing
a staggered election procedure for the
senate next year. The proposal called
for the election of 10 senators each au
tumn and 10 senators each spring
quarter although all senators would
serve one year terms.
Keith Archuleta, a junior psychol
ogy and communication major, was
approved as the at-large member of the
Nominations Committee and Pat
Flinn, a junior psychology major and
Sen. Steve Westly were approved as
members of the Course Guide Policy
Board.
The senate also approved the Publi
cations Board's allocations to campus
publications. Vice chairperson Kevin
Ohlson said those newsletters which
did not receive money from the board
will each receive funds from a $1000
allocation given to the Publications
Board by the senate for such purposes.
The senate approved a projected
ASSU budget of $38,884 for next year
submitted by next year's financial
manager, Chris Mathe.

The senate overwhelmingly ap
proved a resolution, also submitted by
Krevoy, to change the "sexist" word
ing in the constitution, with only Ot
tilie voting against the motion.
The senate killed in effect a resolu
tion submitted by Krevoy introducing
a staggered election procedure for the
senate next year. The proposal called
for the election of 10 senators each au
tumn and 10 senators each spring
quarter although all senators would
serve one year terms.
Keith Archuleta, a junior psychol
ogy and communication major, was
approved as the at-large member of the
Nominations Committee and Pat
Flinn, a junior psychology major and
Sen. Steve Westly were approved as
members of the Course Guide Policy
Board.
The senate also approved the Publi
cations Board's allocations to campus
publications. Vice chairperson Kevin
Ohlson said those newsletters which
did not receive money from the board
will each receive funds from a $1000
allocation given to the Publications
Board by the senate for such purposes.
The senate approved a projected
ASSU budget of $38,884 for next year
submitted by next year's financial
manager, Chris Mathe.
The ASSU Senate overrode last
night by a vote of 9-3 ASSU President
Vic Petroff's veto of a bill which would
grant $1450 to the ASSU Course Guide
from ASSU reserves.
Petroff last Wednesday vetoed both
the bill and a senate resolution which
demanded that the Publications Board
also give $1450 to the Course Guide.
The senate did not act to override the
veto of the resolution at last night's
meeting, the last of the academic year.
The Course Guide will thus receive
$1450 from the ASSU but no money
from the Publications Board.
Course Guide Manager Greg Larson
said that theCourseGuide will instead
take out a low-interest ASSU loan for
the remaining $1450, to be paid back
when the Course Guide is financially
stable.
Sen. Bob Ottilie said the ASSU grant
would set a "bad precedent" but that

theloan would "givetheCourseGuide
the incentive to get on its oWn (achieve
financial independence) because it's
not subsidized (by the Publications
Board)."
There was some question as to
whether Petroff could constitutionally
veto a resolution. Petroff said in a letter
to the senate that he had decided to
consider the resolution a bill and thus,
veto it.
"The Course Guide should get the
money," said Petroff, who said he
simply was protesting the allocation of
Publications Board funds by the se
nate.
"If the senate thinks it's okay to
grant money to an ASSU project (as the
bill would provide) without any con
ditions, that's fine — so long as the
Course Guide gets the money," he
said.
In other action, the senate voted 10-2
against a resolution submitted by Sen.
Brad Krevoy to urge the placement of a

student on the Board of Trustees.
"We should decide what sort of part
we are going to take in this Univer
sity," said Krevoy. "We should know
what will happen with our tuition
money. I'm not willing to let my in
terests be decided by President Ly
man."
Senate Chairman Bill Hoke said that
Lyman has "already turned us down"
on the issue of placement of a student
on the board. He added that one stu
dent on the board would not be rep
resentative of the student body.
"We already have too many students
on committees selling out student in
terests. What we need is access to the
Board of Trustees," Hoke said.
