## 
### Jack Vaughn 
Almost 90 percent of the under
graduates participating in round two
of the Spring Housing Draw received
housing assignments for next year, the
Housing Office reported yesterday.
Some 89 percent of female and 87
percent of male students received as
signments after 88 females and 402
males dropped out of the draw follow
ing round one.
Males not covered under the
Guaranteed Housing Plan with draw
numbers higher than 4303 did not re
ceive housing assignments. Females
not covered by the plan with draw
numbers higher than 4736 were not
assigned.
Some 10 percent of the participants
were left unassigned after round two,
while two percent were assigned
"off-campus," according to Phil Curry,
a staff assistant in the registrar's office.
Off-campus
Curry explained that students were
assigned off campus in round two if
they had draw numbers below the
cut-off level but requested that they
not be assigned unless given one of
their round two housing assignment
choices.
The percentage of students in the

second round who received a housing
assignment was up nine percent for
last year, when 79 percent of the round
two entrants received assignments.
A total of 1265 females and 1466
males were assigned in this year's sec
ond round, which was enough to fill
all available spaces in the housing sys
tem.
Jordan Co-op, which was put on a
special priority after round one be
cause five male and five female spaces
were empty, was filled in round two.
The procedural problems which
plagued round one were absent in
round two. Curry said. "Things went
much more smoothly this time," he
said.
Waiting list
According to the Spring Housing
Draw guidebook, students who were
unassigned at the end of round two
may place themselves on the summer
waiting list for possible assignment
next year.
Curry said students who were as
signed in round two after being unas
signed or assigned to a different resi
dence than their round one assign
ment must sign and turn in their draw
assignment cards before June 4.
