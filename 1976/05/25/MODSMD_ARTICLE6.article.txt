# Trustee Pike discusses alcoholic past
## 
### Philip Feder 
Thomas Potter Pike seems to have all the qualifica
tions befitting a University trustee.
Pike, 66, a 1931 graduate, is a past student body
president, a business executive, a former assistant
secretary of defense, a former special assistant to Pres
ident Eisenhower, a director of Hewlett-Packard and
the Rand Corporation, a father and a husband.
But he's also a "recovered" alcoholic.
He's been a trustee for 20 years. He hasn't had a
drink for 30 years.
In the 1930s and '40s, he was out of control. "Al
coholism is a progressive disease that gets worse," he
says. "By 1946, 1 was at the end of the line. I didn't
know then that 1 was one for whom one drink is too
many. It's an obsession of the mind."
Alcoholic stigma
Since his "recovery," Pike has been a leader in the
fight against alcoholism. As director of the National
Council on Alcoholism and the founder and director
of the Alcoholism Council of Greater Los Angeles, the
former Board of Trustee president tries "to attack the
stigma of the alcoholic."
Last month. Pike helped organize a gathering of
some 50 prominent Americans who have declared
publicly that they are recovered alcoholics. "We
showed that alcoholism cuts through society like the
common cold," he says.
Actor Dick Van Dyke, Astronaut Edwin "Buzz" Al
drin (the second man to walk on the moon) and former
U.S. Sen. Harold Hughes joined Pike and others in a
press conference to tell of their disease.
"Alcoholism is unjustly looked upon as a moral
weakening," Pike says. "There is fear and a great
feeling of shame among alcoholics to receive treat
ment."
Pikn and thp nthnr rnrnvprnd almhnlirs want

"closet" alcoholics to seek help in the only treatment
known to combat the disease — abstinence.
Teetotaling is the only cure because "the true al
coholic has lost the power of choice as to how much to
drink and when." he says.
Pike says his life began anew after he recovered
from his disease — as he insists on calling alcoholism.
Since he had been fired from the family business, he
started his own.
He organized the T.P. Pike Drilling Company and
served as its president until 1953, when he went to
Washington to work in the Defense Department.
White House
One year later, he was promoted to the post of
assistant secretary, and in 1956 he went to the White
House as Eisenhower's special assistant for adminis
trative liaison with government departments and
agencies.
After returning to private business, he headed the
Pike Corporation of America until 1969 and has
since been vice chairman of the Fluor Corporaton,
based in Los Angeles.
But after his years of success, Pike still recalls his
days of heavy drinking.
"I was an athlete at Stanford. I'm a big man, so I
could drink a lot and never get sick," he says."l didn't
drink until 1928. It was my sophomore year and pro
hibition was still around. I drank 17 bottles of beer in a
contest and won."
While he drank, Pike says he "leaned on alcohol as
a tool of my business. But I drank more on my own
account than for my clients or my business,"
He adds, "If I hadn't gotten sober, I would have
been dead." Now. Pike helps alcoholics in "a very
exciting, uphill, tough battle.
"When you jump into a problem like this, you're
thrilled," he savs.

common cold," he says.
Actor Dick Van Dyke, Astronaut Edwin "Buzz" Al
drin (the second man to walk on the moon) and former
U.S. Sen. Harold Hughes joined Pike and others in a
press conference to tell of their disease.
"Alcoholism is unjustly looked upon as a moral
weakening," Pike says. "There is fear and a great
feeling of shame among alcoholics to receive treat
ment."
Pikn and thp nthnr rnrnvprnd almhnlirs want

"closet" alcoholics to seek help in the only treatment
known to combat the disease — abstinence.
Teetotaling is the only cure because "the true al
coholic has lost the power of choice as to how much to
drink and when." he says.
Pike says his life began anew after he recovered
from his disease — as he insists on calling alcoholism.
Since he had been fired from the family business, he
started his own.
He organized the T.P. Pike Drilling Company and
served as its president until 1953, when he went to
Washington to work in the Defense Department.
White House
One year later, he was promoted to the post of
assistant secretary, and in 1956 he went to the White
House as Eisenhower's special assistant for adminis
trative liaison with government departments and
agencies.
After returning to private business, he headed the
Pike Corporation of America until 1969 and has
since been vice chairman of the Fluor Corporaton,
based in Los Angeles.
But after his years of success, Pike still recalls his
days of heavy drinking.
"I was an athlete at Stanford. I'm a big man, so I
could drink a lot and never get sick," he says."l didn't
drink until 1928. It was my sophomore year and pro
hibition was still around. I drank 17 bottles of beer in a
contest and won."
While he drank, Pike says he "leaned on alcohol as
a tool of my business. But I drank more on my own
account than for my clients or my business,"
He adds, "If I hadn't gotten sober, I would have
been dead." Now. Pike helps alcoholics in "a very
exciting, uphill, tough battle.
"When you jump into a problem like this, you're
thrilled," he savs.

NOT-SO-ANONYMOHS—Trustee Thomas Pike, a "recovered" alcoholic, is
director of the National Council on Alcoholism. He and about 50 other al
coholics last month publicly discussed their affliction.
Thomas Potter Pike seems to have all the qualifica
tions befitting a University trustee.
Pike, 66, a 1931 graduate, is a past student body
president, a business executive, a former assistant
secretary of defense, a former special assistant to Pres
ident Eisenhower, a director of Hewlett-Packard and
the Rand Corporation, a father and a husband.
But he's also a "recovered" alcoholic.
He's been a trustee for 20 years. He hasn't had a
drink for 30 years.
In the 1930s and '40s, he was out of control. "Al
coholism is a progressive disease that gets worse," he
says. "By 1946, 1 was at the end of the line. I didn't
know then that 1 was one for whom one drink is too
many. It's an obsession of the mind."
Alcoholic stigma
Since his "recovery," Pike has been a leader in the
fight against alcoholism. As director of the National
Council on Alcoholism and the founder and director
of the Alcoholism Council of Greater Los Angeles, the
former Board of Trustee president tries "to attack the
stigma of the alcoholic."
Last month. Pike helped organize a gathering of
some 50 prominent Americans who have declared
publicly that they are recovered alcoholics. "We
showed that alcoholism cuts through society like the
common cold," he says.
