## editorials Delts' 'activities' 
### 
Early Thursday morning a group of
members of the Delta Tau Delta frater
nity (Delts) and some of their friends al
legedly trashed four fraternity houses.
In the spring of 1974 it was announced
that the two-year suspension of the Delts
was being reduced to one year and that
the Delts would be allowed to return to
campus in the fall of 1974.
One of the reasons the University
agreed to reduce the suspension was that
the Delts recognized that similar inci
dents in the future could mean perma
nent suspension of the fraternity.
At that time, then-Delt President Brad
Williams said, "I guaranteed you, the
first guy that does anything wrong, as far
as intimidation or rowdiness goes, is
out."
Williams also said, "We're just a
bunch of fun-loving guys who aren't out

to break or destroy everything."
While it's true that the Delts and their
companions who were on "foot patrol"
that morning did not break everything in
sight, damage was rather widespread.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton said two years ago, "They (the
Delts) have assured us that similar con
duct in the future will not be tolerated by
members of the house."
Horton also commented then, "We
have notified them . . . that if such (de
structive) activities do occur, there will
be a prompt and unequivocal response
by the University. .. . Residence
privileges would be withdrawn, this
time perhaps permanently."
We hope the University will re
member these statements from the past
when reviewing the activities of last
Thursday morning.
