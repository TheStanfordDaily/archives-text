We support the recommendation by
the Ad-Hoc Committee on Human
Rights that the University adopt a single
comprehensive statement covering
non-discrimination throughout the
community.
The proposal, which originated from
the Gay People's Union, would entail a
statement by the University that it would
not discriminate against students, fa
culty, or staff, on the basis of race, sex,
sexual orientation, age, religion, na
tional origin or physical disability.

This uniform statement would replace
the various nondiscrimination policies
now covering various segments of the
community. As we have stated before,
simply prohibiting discrimination on
those grounds required by law shirks the
University's moral obligation to protect
its community from discrimination.
The ad-hoc committee is sponsoring
an informational rally at noon today in
White Plaza. We urge all those members
of the community interested in gaining
further information to attend.
