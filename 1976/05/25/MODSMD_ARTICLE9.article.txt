orientation, age. religion, na

ity is a bona fide occupational
qualification)."

Dirty tactics
I was beginning to reconcile
myself to Jimmy Carter's nomi
nation. despite his vague posi
tions this year and his enthusias
tic support four yfears ago for
arch-conservative Henry
Jackson.
But the (Georgian's campaign
has turned very, very ugly.
Last week Detroit Mayor Col
emay Young endorsed Carter be
fore a group of black Michigan
ministers. In that endorsement
Young asked: "Do we want to
support the man from Arizona
whose church won't even let you
in the back door? (Translation:
"Rep. Morris Udyll (D-Ariz.) is a
Mormon and therefore is a
bigot:")
Alert reporters quickly
pointed out that Young's view
was totally false: Udall is neither
a Mormon or a bigot. He left the
church :i() years ago precisely
because he believed its doctrine
was racist.

He has been an unswerving
supporter of civil rights and ra
cial justice 112 rom the outset of his
public career.
Through his press agent. Car
ter issued a statement saying that
"Udall has consistently run a
negative campaign . . . impugn
ing Carter's commitment to ra
cial justice (and) his personal re
ligious beliefs. If Udall is ready
to repudiate these statements, I
am sure Carter would be willing
to consider his request."
When pressed by reporters.
Carter and his PR man admitted
they could cite no evidence to
back up their statements.
jimmy Carter says he will
never tell a lie. Perhaps this is
because he does not need to —
sycophants abound to tell them
on his behalf.
Then he can blissfully con
tinue on his way, smiling
broadly, if vapidly, talking ear
nestly and incessantly of "trust,
honesty and love."

Ignored issues
The recommendations for
changes in the University's park
ing regulations that appeared in
Wednesday's Campus Reports
are a great disappointment. Es
sentially, there is no change in
student resident parking policy
and no rationale for the fees.
Some ideas are tossed around
in Winbigler's memo, but none
fit the circumstances of student
resident parking:
—Encouraging alternative
transportation makes no sense to
those who only want to park at
their home.
—The cost of student parking
is not part of general University
funds, but is paid for by students
in their rents.
—Supporting a shuttle bus is
nice, but those who do not own
cars are as likely to use the bus as
those students who park in front
of their house.
