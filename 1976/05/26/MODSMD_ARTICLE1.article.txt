# Students march to support proposed human rights policy
## 
### Stephen Carter 
About 100 students marched from
White Plaza to Building 10 yesterday
afternoon to present petitions support
ing the proposed Human Rights Policy
to President Richard Lyman.
Joel Roberts of Stanford Lutheran
Ministry and juniors Dan Howard and
Keith Archuleta, led some 60 students
into the anteroom of the president's
office, where Legal Adviser James
Siena and Assistant to the President
William Stone accepted the petitions.
Stone said Lyman was out of the office
at a meeting.
The march came at the conclusion of
the "Solidarity Day" demonstration,
which drew more than 2.50 students to
White Plaza. Some 30 speakers, in
cluding former student body president
David Harris, a candidate for the
Democratic nomination from the 12th
Congressional District, endorsed the
proposal.
Band plays
About 20 members of the Band
played to open the rally, although or
ganizers said later they doubted that
the band significantly increased at
tendance. Fewer than 200 students
were present when the band finished.
Howard, the chief organizer of the
rally, spoke first, noting that Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons had cal
led the proposed policy "a laundry
list." He said. "I'm here to tell Dean
Lyons that he's right when he calls it a
laundry list . . . but he's wrong when
he calls it patently absurd."
The proposed Human Rights Policy
would entail a single statement from
the University that it would not dis
criminate against students, faculty or
staff members on the basis of race, sex,
sexual orientation, age, religion, na
tional origin or physical disability, ex
cept where disability was a "bona
fide" criterion.

Archuleta, who is vice president of
the Black Student Union, received
heavy applause when he told the
crowd, "The game of divide and con
quer has been played too long. . . . The
game of divide and conquer ends
here."
He added, "The seed of community
has been planted today in the spirit of
Harnmbee." Harcimbee is a Swahili
word meaning "all pull together."
Applause for Harris
But the rally reserved its largest ova
tion for Harris, who expressed
"amazement that Stanford is still dis
cussing" the question of individual
rights. He added that this was a
"theoretical, not practical amaze
ment ."
Harris said he believed "rights are
something that people have by virtue
of being born" and "because they are
people." He added that when he was
student body president, "the issue was
heterosexuality, and whether it would
be allowed."
At the rally's conclusion, Howard
and Roberts led students and others
across the plaza and into the Quad,
where they stopped outside of the
President's Office, chanting "support
human rights."
Howard then opened the door, and
he and Archuleta entered the an
teroom. Others hesitated, then fol
lowed. Welcomed by Siena, Stone and
a smiling secretary, Roberts explained.
"Well, we have a number of petitions
here."
'Peacefully disperse'
He added. "We're going to read this,
then we'll peacefully disperse." How
ard then read the petitions, and
handed them to Stone.
Stone, who accepted with a smile,
told the students that Lyman was at a
luncheon meeting, which led Alliance
for Radical Change member Seth

Foldy to grumble, "We should have
made an appointment."
Before the demonstrators left the of
fice, Roger Hardy of the United Stan
ford Employees (USE) told Siena that
the University was discriminating by
offering guarantees of freedom of sex
ual expression only to staff members.
Hardy had earlier told the rally that
members of the USE bargaining unit
already had "legally binding" contract
provision forbidding discrimination
on the basis of sexual orientation, and
that other segments of the community
needed similar protection.
Stone and Siena deferred comment
to Lyman, who was scheduled to ap
pear on KZSU's Campus Conference
last night (see story opposite).
President should lead
Roberts said in response, "This kind
of leadership should come from the
