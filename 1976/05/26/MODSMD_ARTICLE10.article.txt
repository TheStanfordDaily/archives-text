# Ford faces dilemma in election
## 
### 
Gerald Ford faces a real dilemma in this
year's election. In order to defeat Ronald
Reagan in the primaries, he must risk losing
the Democratic and independent votes he
will need to win in the November election.
Of course. Ford can appeal to the party
leadership and uncommitted delegates.
This he is already doing, calling Reagan
another Barry Goldwater who will go down
to smashing defeat in November.
But this appeal will have only limited
effect for two reasons. First, the nominating
system is dominated by primaries which
Reagan has used quite effectively to cir
cumvent the Republican party organiza
tion. In addition, Reagan has used them
quite effectively to build up momentum and
portray himself as a winner.
The second reason has to do with the Re
publican Party itself. The party is divided
and small; Reagan supporters constitute an
important contituency within the party.
These hard-line conservatives are domin
ant because the Republican party has the
allegiance of only 18 percent of the electo
rate. After the VVatergate scandal and the
disillusionment with Richard Nixon, most
moderates left the party, leaving behind the
conservative hard core.
No alternative
Thus, Ford has no alternative but to con
centrate on the primaries, and he must win
the votes of the conservative element of the
Republican party.
That is not to say that Reagan can easily
win the nomination. Rather, Reagan is
likely to siphon off just enough support to
scare Ford and push him to the right in an

effort to stave the challanger off.
These effects can already be seen in the
stands that Ford and Reagan are taking on
the issues. Aside from the Panama issue and
the $90 billion slip-up which Reagan made
at the beginning of his campaign, the Ford
and Reagan positions in the campaign are
very similar.
Inflation important
Both consider inflation to be more impor
tant than unemployment as an economic

problem at this time, and both propose to
reduce government spending to stop it.
Reagan has also forced Ford to become more
conservative on foreign policy and defense.
Consequently, Ford has moved away from
detente with the Russians, and Henry Kis
singer has become a liability rather than an
asset.
In the area of bureaucracy and govern
ment waste, Ford and Reagan both em
phasize the importance of reducing the role,
though Reagan is perhaps more vocal on
this point.
Reagan has forced Ford to shift his posi
tion on most issues to the right to pick up
the votes of conservative Republicans. Be-

cause of this, the image of flexibility and
compromise which Ford brought into the
White House has been replaced by an inflex
ible. hard-line conservative ideology which
does not appeal to most voters.
Show effects
The polls show the effects quite clearly.
Ford gets only 35 percent or so of the vote in
a mock election against Carter's 48 percent,
while Reagan gets 32 percent against Car
ter's 50 percent. v
This is in contrast to earlier polls which
showed Carter losing to Ford or only nar
rowly beating him. What has happened is
quite clear: Ford's attempt to win the Re
publican primaries by out-righting Reagan
has cost him dearly among Democrats and
independents.
What this means is that unless
broadens his appeal, he may win the nomi
nation, but he will lose the election. Unfor
tunately, he cannot afford to broaden his
appeal for fear of losing the conservative
support he desperately needs to win the Re
publican nomination.
That is Ford's dilemma. He is the leader of
a small, sharply divided party, which is
being increasingly dominatecfby hard core
conservatives who are more concerned
about maintaining ideological purity than
putting a man with at least part of that
ideology in the White House. This dilemma
makes it very likely that Ford will have a
very hard time in November regardless of
who is nominated by the Democrats.
