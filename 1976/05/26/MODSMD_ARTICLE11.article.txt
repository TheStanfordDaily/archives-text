# Letters: Prop. 15, education
## 
### 
No deception
Over the past few months, I
have read with interest several
articles in the Daily with regard
to the "nuclear shutdown initia
tive" — Proposition 15. Rather
than present all of the pro
nuclear arguments which will be
followed by line per line rebut
tal, let me instead make a more
personal contribution.
Since 1969, I have been an
Honors Cooperative student in
the Mechanical Engineering De
partment here working towards
my Ph.D. in Applied Mechanics.
For the past 10 years, I have been
actively engaged in the de
velopment and design of nuclear
reactors for commercial power
use at General Electric's Nuclear

Energy Divisions in San Jose.
During that time, I have
worked in safety areas such as
the hypothesized "loss of cool
ant accident." earthquake
resistant design, testing and
analysis and, recently, in flow
induced vibration technology of
advance reactor designs. In the
late 19605, 1 assisted General
Electric in evaluating the vari
ous design concepts suitable for
the forthcoming "breeder"
power reactors.
I have conducted non
destructive dynamic tests at
commercial nuclear power sites
under various stages of construc
tion and assisted the periodic
outage operation of the General
Electric test reactor near Liver

more, California. On occasion, I
have travelled to Bethesda,
Maryland to present to the Un
ited States Nuclear Regulatory
Commission technical informa
tion for their staff to evaluate and
question with regard to General
Electric's Boiling Water Reactor
designs.
Over the years. I have seen this
product continually improve in
safety, reliability and efficiency.
I have never observed any at
tempt or effort by my co-workers
or management to deceive the
regulatory agencies or the public
on any aspect of product quality
or safety.
In summary, I have had a
widely varied experience in
commercial nuclear power reac
tor development and design.
Based on this experience, I make
these conclusions about Prop.
15:
—Prop. 15 is an irresponsible
initiativeand should not become
California law-.
—I recommend a"no"vote on
Prop. 15.

Teaching passivity
The undergraduate
here . . . what should we do with
him? Should we educate him or
help him learn? Instill know
ledge or encourage self
enlightenment? Indoctrinate or
push for independent broaden
ing of intellectual horizons?
Whatever we decide upon, we
know that a strong inquiring
mind needs but little guidance
in its search for knowledge.
Thus, what should be discour
aged is passiveness on the part of
the student, the attitude "I'll sit
back, relax, and be educated."
After all, if learning is to carry
on after college days, the student
will need to be self-reliant. Let us
break away from the high school
concept of education, that of
education meaning the process
in which teachers fill students'
minds.
The university is the perfect
place to learn. Let's not educate
the student into passivity.
