Washington — The Founding Fathers
would be astonished to learn that
150,041.000 Americans will be eligible to
vote in the Presidential election this
November.
At the Nation's beginning that wasn't the
idea at all — giving the vote to every man. let
alone to women, blacks, and citizens only 18
years old.
The way they saw it when Ceorge
Washington was President, a man had to
"have a stake in society" to have a say in
choosing the new nation's leaders. He had to
own property or prove he paid taxes.
And he had to be "free, white and 21."
Nobody gave a second thought about letting
women vote. The brand new Constitution
said nothing about voting rights, only that it
was up to the states to decide.
Ideal Electors
Now. five amendments to the Constitution
later. ele< lion day in the I Jnited States finally
measures up to the way Alexander Hamilton
and |«itiies Madison theorized things should
be. writing in the Federalist Papers in the
early 1800s.
"Who are the electors of the federal rep
resentatives'i*" they asked. "Not the rich, more
than the poor: not the learned, more than the
ignorant; not the haughty heirs of distin
guished names, more than the humblesons of
obscure and unpropitious fortune. The elec
tors are to be the great body of the people of
t hi; I Jnited States."
At that time, the only people with voting
tights, the property owners and taxpayers,
were 50 to 75 percent of the adult male popu
lation, according to records. Some, like the
Federalist (iazzette of Annapolis, felt there
was cause for alarm:
"The truth is." said the paper on August 9.
1800. "the people of Maryland have become
too saucy and are really beginning to fancy
themselves equal to their superiors."
'Coonskin Congressmen'
After a Presidential reception. Martha
Washi ngton blamed greasy handprints on the
wallpaper on uninvited "filthy democrats."
As more got the vote, citified Americans
joked over enfranchising "bipeds of the
forest" and slurred the new "coonskin Con
gressmen" at the Capitol.
By the Civil War. universal male suffrage
was the law. except for slaves. Even the boys
in blue could vote, unlike at least one group
of Yankees during tin; Revolution who were
told thev couldn't vote because thev "had no

will of their own." Their muskets persuaded
the election judges otherwise.
Despite the Emancipation Proclamation,
blacks were not enfranchised until the 15th
Amendment was ratified in 1870. Then five
years later Tennessee enacted the first Jim
Crow law separating blacks and whites in
public places, and in 1890 poll taxes and lit
eracy tests were enacted to disenfranchise
thousands of blacks. The 24th Amendment
finally banned the poll tax in 1964.
Women got the vote in 1869 — in the
Wyoming Territory. Elsewhere the suffraget
tes. as they were soon calling themselves,
began their long battle for enfranchisement.
They faced such arguments as. "If women
were allowed to vote, they would crowd all
men out of office and men would be obliged
to stay home and take care o! the children." In
1910 a suffragette was "one who has ceased to
be a lady and has not yet become a gentle
man."
In 1920 women won the vote with the 19th
Amendment —and a comment: "Thegreatest
thing that came out of the war (World War I)
was the emancipation of women, for which
no man fought."
The 23rd Amendment enfranchised citi
zens of the District of Columbia in 1961. and.
10 years later, the 26th Amendment lowered
the voting age to 18.
10 million more
Today people of American territories or the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico cannot yet
vote in Presidential elections.
The eligible electorate in November —
150.04 1.000 —is nearly 10 million more than
the voting age population at the time of the
1972 Presidential election, according to the
Census Bureau.
At first Presidential elections were held on
different days from one state to the next. But
in 1845 Congress decided on the first Tues
day after the first Monday in November for
Presidential election day.and that is when it
has been ever since.
Voting machines now register 47 percent of
the nation's choices in cities where most
Americans live, paper ballots the rest.
But it was late in the 1800s before secret
paper ballots finally replaced the earlier cus
tom of a voter going to the polls and calling
out his vote in a loud voice for all to hear —
and jeer or cheer.
In fact, in 1829 one Founding Father, John
Randolph, darkly predicted that secret bal
lots would turn the United States into a "na
tion of scoundrels."
