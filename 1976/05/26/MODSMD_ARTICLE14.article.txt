# Sports in China
## Exercise important to Chinese 
### Vivian Lee 
Theslogan"serve the people"
is "the epitome ot China" and
sports practiced there reinforces
this spirit, said Harry Edwards,
assistant professor of sociology
at IJC-Berkelev and organizer ot
the 1968 Olvmpics's black
power salute by athletes Thomas
Smith and John Carlos.
In a lecture and slide show en
titled "Sports. Politics and
Ideology in China." Edwards
told an audience of about 100 in
Annenberg Auditorium Satur
day night that nearly everyone in
China engages in sports "be
cause they see it as their re
volutionary responsibility to
maintain their health and their
bodies."
According to Edwards, a heal
thy Chinese population can con

tribute more actively to the con
struction of their society and He
fend it in case of Soviet attack
In contrast. Edwards, who
wrote his Ph.D. thesis on the re
lationship of sports and societ\
said American sports is totailv
unrelated to one's health.
"it is a commercial commod
ity" connected to the selling m
such things as tickets to a game
and sport equipment, the former
basketball and track star at San
Jose State said.
Emphasizing the "unhealthi
ness" of American sports. Ed
wards noted after the lecture that
for the American athlete, the av
erage life time is 54 years. 10
years less than that of the normal
person.
Earlier this year. Edwards and
a group of "doctors, lawyers and

professors" spent a month-long
trip in China to study the sports
there.
What Edwards found was that
the Chinese, irrespective of age
and sex. engage in "physical cul
ture." as sports is called there,
übiquitously and as part of their
daily lives.
Using slides taken on the trip
to illustrate his points. Edwards
said. "Every morning between
4:.'H) and 7:30. just before the sun
is up. people go to the open
spaces in order to do exercises."
At one public square. Edwards
witnessed several "shifts" of
people using the space to exer
cise.
"The people are not ashamed
to do exercises out in public." he
said. "You see young people
doing exercises on the sidewalk
on the way to school. You see old
pontic out in numbers doing tui
chi (/limn vtiich is Chinese
siiciiiou nosing."
"In the U.S.. once we go past
adolescense. we head for the
European Spa." he told the
well-humored audience. "If we
do exercises, it is an admission
that our bodies are not up to
par." adding that the only
people up to par is somebody
like Racquel Welch or Rock
Hudson, "whose business is
their bodies and their bodies is
their business."
Other slides of pre-school
children managing difficult
gynmastics. middle-aged com
mune members doing calis
thenics. and basketball nets
waiting for workers with a break
at hotels, construction sites and
factories attested to the wide
sprad practice of sports.
Although the people came in
masses to exercise and many
groups seemed organized. Ed
wards said he did not see any
regimentation at all in China.
The people themselves were all
eager to keep fit. he said.
"The most popular sports in
China are swimming, basketball,
volleyball, soccer and ping
pong." Edwards added. They are
selected on the basis that "the
greatest number of people can
participate given the equipment

and facilities."
There are no obese people in
China, as a result of their com
mitment to sports and the
people's health. Edwards
noticed. Moreover, the athletic
level of the people is very high.
Several times. he mistook
factory workers playing in their
spare time for professional
athletes. Edwards said.
Because sports in China is
strictly for the development of
the people's health, many
phenomena taken for granted in
American sports are ostensibly
absent in Chinese sports. Ed
wards observed.
National athletic stars do not
exist in China. Edwards drew
laughs when he said the "special
dispensation" for one
heavyweight champion was "he
was supposed to do twice as
much work because he was
twice as strong" in the factory in
which he worked. Me was also
supposed to help others in im
proving their weight-lifting
techniques.
Nor is there such a thing as
violent sports. Edwards used the
anecdote of the ivii sliu (martial
arts) demonstration in which a
brick was placed on the throat of
one partner so the other could
break it in half with his sword to
point out that "the Chinese are
only interested in perfecting the
art."
There are also no "bench hurl
ing. cheering, hollering and yel
ling audiences" in China. "At
one ping pong exhibition." Ed
wards recalled, "the audience
was clapping for the totality of
the action and not for any indi
vidual because they believe in
'friendship first, competition
second.' "
"This explains why they sent
their third best women's basket
ball team to play in America, and
their sixth best ping pong team,"
Edwards said.
Edwards concluded, "There is
a tremendous amount to learn
from the People's Republic of
China. I saw the spirit of ac
complishment and dedication
that luis long been lost in the
U.S."

at hotels, construction sites and

Although the people came in
masses to exercise and many
groups seemed organized. Ed
wards said he did not see any
regimentation at all in China.
The people themselves were all
eager to keep fit. he said.
"The most popular sports in
China are swimming, basketball,
volleyball, soccer and ping
pong." Edwards added. They are
selected on the basis that "the
greatest number of people can
participate given the equipment

and facilities."
There are no obese people in
China, as a result of their com
mitment to sports and the
people's health. Edwards
noticed. Moreover, the athletic
level of the people is very high.
Several times. he mistook
factory workers playing in their
spare time for professional
athletes. Edwards said.
Because sports in China is
strictly for the development of
the people's health, many
phenomena taken for granted in
American sports are ostensibly
absent in Chinese sports. Ed
wards observed.
National athletic stars do not
exist in China. Edwards drew
laughs when he said the "special
dispensation" for one
heavyweight champion was "he
was supposed to do twice as
much work because he was
twice as strong" in the factory in
which he worked. Me was also
supposed to help others in im
proving their weight-lifting
techniques.
Nor is there such a thing as
violent sports. Edwards used the
anecdote of the ivii sliu (martial
arts) demonstration in which a
brick was placed on the throat of
one partner so the other could
break it in half with his sword to
point out that "the Chinese are
only interested in perfecting the
art."
There are also no "bench hurl
ing. cheering, hollering and yel
ling audiences" in China. "At
one ping pong exhibition." Ed
wards recalled, "the audience
was clapping for the totality of
the action and not for any indi
vidual because they believe in
'friendship first, competition
second.' "
"This explains why they sent
their third best women's basket
ball team to play in America, and
their sixth best ping pong team,"
Edwards said.
Edwards concluded, "There is
a tremendous amount to learn
from the People's Republic of
China. I saw the spirit of ac
complishment and dedication
that luis long been lost in the

DANCE TlME — Senior Bernard Magier and sophomore Lani
Medina will be among those performing dances from the El Norte
and Jalisco regions of Mexico tomorrow night at 8 in the Toyon
Lounge. Performers are members of the beginning dance and
exhibition dance class here. Refreshments and pan dulce. a Mexi
can pastry, will be served at the show. Admission is free.
Theslogan"serve the people"
is "the epitome ot China" and
sports practiced there reinforces
this spirit, said Harry Edwards,
assistant professor of sociology
at IJC-Berkelev and organizer ot
the 1968 Olvmpics's black
power salute by athletes Thomas
Smith and John Carlos.
In a lecture and slide show en
titled "Sports. Politics and
Ideology in China." Edwards
told an audience of about 100 in
Annenberg Auditorium Satur
day night that nearly everyone in
China engages in sports "be
cause they see it as their re
volutionary responsibility to
maintain their health and their
bodies."
According to Edwards, a heal
thy Chinese population can con

tribute more actively to the con
struction of their society and He
fend it in case of Soviet attack
In contrast. Edwards, who
wrote his Ph.D. thesis on the re
lationship of sports and societ\
said American sports is totailv
unrelated to one's health.
"it is a commercial commod
ity" connected to the selling m
such things as tickets to a game
and sport equipment, the former
basketball and track star at San
Jose State said.
Emphasizing the "unhealthi
ness" of American sports. Ed
wards noted after the lecture that
for the American athlete, the av
erage life time is 54 years. 10
years less than that of the normal
person.
Earlier this year. Edwards and
a group of "doctors, lawyers and

professors" spent a month-long
trip in China to study the sports
there.
What Edwards found was that
the Chinese, irrespective of age
and sex. engage in "physical cul
ture." as sports is called there,
übiquitously and as part of their
daily lives.
Using slides taken on the trip
to illustrate his points. Edwards
said. "Every morning between
4:.'H) and 7:30. just before the sun
is up. people go to the open
spaces in order to do exercises."
At one public square. Edwards
witnessed several "shifts" of
people using the space to exer
cise.
"The people are not ashamed
to do exercises out in public." he
said. "You see young people
doing exercises on the sidewalk
on the way to school. You see old
pontic out in numbers doing tui
chi (/limn vtiich is Chinese
siiciiiou nosing."
"In the U.S.. once we go past
adolescense. we head for the
European Spa." he told the
well-humored audience. "If we
do exercises, it is an admission
that our bodies are not up to
par." adding that the only
people up to par is somebody
like Racquel Welch or Rock
Hudson, "whose business is
their bodies and their bodies is
their business."
Other slides of pre-school
children managing difficult
gynmastics. middle-aged com
mune members doing calis
thenics. and basketball nets
waiting for workers with a break

assistant professor of sociology
at IJC-Berkelev and organizer ot
the 1968 Olvmpics's black
power salute by athletes Thomas
Smith and John Carlos.
In a lecture and slide show en
titled "Sports. Politics and
Ideology in China." Edwards
told an audience of about 100 in
Annenberg Auditorium Satur
day night that nearly everyone in
China engages in sports "be
cause they see it as their re
volutionary responsibility to
maintain their health and their
bodies."
According to Edwards, a heal
thy Chinese population can con

tribute more actively to the con
struction of their society and He
fend it in case of Soviet attack
In contrast. Edwards, who
wrote his Ph.D. thesis on the re
lationship of sports and societ\
said American sports is totailv
unrelated to one's health.
"it is a commercial commod
ity" connected to the selling m
such things as tickets to a game
and sport equipment, the former
basketball and track star at San
Jose State said.
Emphasizing the "unhealthi
ness" of American sports. Ed
wards noted after the lecture that
for the American athlete, the av
erage life time is 54 years. 10
years less than that of the normal
person.
Earlier this year. Edwards and
a group of "doctors, lawyers and

professors" spent a month-long
trip in China to study the sports
there.
What Edwards found was that
the Chinese, irrespective of age
and sex. engage in "physical cul
ture." as sports is called there,
übiquitously and as part of their
daily lives.
Using slides taken on the trip
to illustrate his points. Edwards
said. "Every morning between
4:.'H) and 7:30. just before the sun
is up. people go to the open
spaces in order to do exercises."
At one public square. Edwards
witnessed several "shifts" of
people using the space to exer
cise.
"The people are not ashamed
to do exercises out in public." he
said. "You see young people
doing exercises on the sidewalk
on the way to school. You see old
pontic out in numbers doing tui
chi (/limn vtiich is Chinese
siiciiiou nosing."
"In the U.S.. once we go past
adolescense. we head for the
European Spa." he told the
well-humored audience. "If we
do exercises, it is an admission
that our bodies are not up to
par." adding that the only
people up to par is somebody
like Racquel Welch or Rock
Hudson, "whose business is
their bodies and their bodies is
their business."
Other slides of pre-school
children managing difficult
gynmastics. middle-aged com
mune members doing calis
thenics. and basketball nets
waiting for workers with a break
at hotels, construction sites and
factories attested to the wide
sprad practice of sports.
Although the people came in
masses to exercise and many
groups seemed organized. Ed
wards said he did not see any
regimentation at all in China.
The people themselves were all
eager to keep fit. he said.
"The most popular sports in
China are swimming, basketball,
volleyball, soccer and ping
pong." Edwards added. They are
selected on the basis that "the
greatest number of people can
participate given the equipment

and facilities."
There are no obese people in
China, as a result of their com
mitment to sports and the
people's health. Edwards
noticed. Moreover, the athletic
level of the people is very high.
Several times. he mistook
factory workers playing in their
spare time for professional
athletes. Edwards said.
Because sports in China is
strictly for the development of
the people's health, many
phenomena taken for granted in
American sports are ostensibly
absent in Chinese sports. Ed
wards observed.
National athletic stars do not
exist in China. Edwards drew
laughs when he said the "special
dispensation" for one
heavyweight champion was "he
was supposed to do twice as
much work because he was
twice as strong" in the factory in
which he worked. Me was also
supposed to help others in im
proving their weight-lifting
techniques.
Nor is there such a thing as
violent sports. Edwards used the
anecdote of the ivii sliu (martial
arts) demonstration in which a
brick was placed on the throat of
one partner so the other could
break it in half with his sword to
point out that "the Chinese are
only interested in perfecting the
art."
There are also no "bench hurl
ing. cheering, hollering and yel
ling audiences" in China. "At
one ping pong exhibition." Ed
wards recalled, "the audience
was clapping for the totality of
the action and not for any indi
vidual because they believe in
'friendship first, competition
second.' "
"This explains why they sent
their third best women's basket
ball team to play in America, and
their sixth best ping pong team,"
Edwards said.
Edwards concluded, "There is
a tremendous amount to learn
from the People's Republic of
China. I saw the spirit of ac
complishment and dedication
that luis long been lost in the
U.S."
