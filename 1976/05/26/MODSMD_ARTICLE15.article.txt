Enclosed with this letter is un exercise in manual
dexterity -an unused parking sticker. Your mis
sion, should you decide to accept it. is to try to
detach the broivn packing from the sticker. Can
you do it? I cunt, and neither coidd many of my
friends. When wefina llv succeeded, it i\ as gener
ally after tearing the sticker in half. Why can't the
police department buy stickers which have the
broivn paper divided in half down the back? -A.J.
Our staff didn't require any trial efforts to get
your point. After all, most of us have cars.
Captain William Wullschleger, who orders the
stickers, admitted that the police department has
had numerous similar complaints. Unfortunately,
the present stickers are biodegradable and the
company which manufactures them doesn't make
biodegradable stickers with divided backs.

What's the problem in the ASSIJ office? I've been
there on several occasions, and, ivith the excep
tion of the lecture notes window, have had my
questions met with discourteous near-disgust and
absolutely no help. -S.M.
ASSIJ Financial Manager Chris Cline found
your comment "distressing," and promised to
pass it along to others in the office. He said that
he'd had mostly "positive feedback" .(bout the
ASSIJ office help.
Incidentally, our staff has never met with any
discourteous behavior when dealing with the
ASSU. Incompetence and utter disorganization,
yes. Rudeness, no.

Where do all those funny little white carts go (it
nights I mean the ones with University seals on
their sides which dart around campusall day. I've
never seen u hunch of them parked anywhere.

"They certainly don't nest," said )ason Mavis.
Plant Services director. At least not in one place.
IBM repair vehicles and student-operated carts
(used mostly during ski season by injured
daredevils) are stored in the Plant Services yard.
The police store their own carts, and Housing
stores the I.D. mail carts.
UPDATE: Further suggestions on how to kill
snails*, humanely or otherwise, have continued to
Hood our offices. One new idea (ideal for those
with killer instincts), proposed by a biologist at
Berkeley, is to hide a trap board overnight in a
damp place in the garden. The board should be a
four-foot l-by-4 on two-inch thick runners set
sideways, raising it just off the ground. On aris
ing, the budding gardener will find snail colonies
resting on tin; underside, which he can then
scrape into a hole and heartlessly crush.
Those with culinary tendencies will delight in
knowing that garden snails are also edible. The
May 1H Palo Alto Times includes recipes for gar
den snails in wine sauce, garlic butter or just sim
ply fried. Before consuming, you must let the little
mollusks "purge" themselves in a container lined
with cornmeal. After this, plunge them (live) into
boiling water accented with bay leaf.
