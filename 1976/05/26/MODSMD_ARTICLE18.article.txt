"The community support
shown here tonight for the Stan
ford Youth Program is an indica
tion that we are providing a vital
service in our community. The
response was tremendous," said
senior Paul Gibson, director,
after acting as master of cere
monies of the program's second
annual banquet last Thursday
night.
Over 50 alumni and other
supporters of the program at
tended the banquet held at
Ming's Restaurant in Palo Alto.
Gibson stressed that the Youth
Program represents a positive at
titude on the part of the Athletic
Department both towards stu
dents and community.
Paraphrasing former director
Chris Avery, he said that "the
Athletic Program under Joe
Ruetz takes a real interest in its
athletes as individuals and
human beings — and the Youth
Program is proof of that."

The basis of the Youth Prog
ram is to provide a one-to-one
relationship for a youngster,
who is having problems at home
or at school, with a Stanford stu
dent. Originally conceived of as
a matching of Stanford athletes
with pre-delinquent boys, the
idea was first acted upon in the
early '60s by Congressman Pete
McCloskey and Skip Crist, then
attorneys in the aTea. The prog
ram died after three years, and
was only reinstated in 1971
under the sponsorship of Crist,
Dr. Stan Fischman, Chief of
Psychiatry at the Children's
Hospital and Chuck Taylor, Di
rector of Athletics.
In recent years the number of
volunteers working in the prog
ram has grown to 5 men and 25
women — athletes as well as
non-athletes. "We've got every
thing from Olympic Gold medal
winners to KZSIJ disc jockeys"
working as volunteers, Gibson
noted.

A year ago, at the first annual
banquet, Youth Program direc
tors Chris Avery and Duf Sun
dheim solicited financial sup
port for a nation-wide trip which
would establish youth programs
patterned after Stanford's at 12
major universities. Thursday's
banquet was highlighted by a
slideshow depicting the succes
ses of their trip. "We've estab
lished six very strong programs
— including ones at Harvard,
Wisconsin and the University of
Washington," said Sundheim,
"and we hope ultimately to
sponsor a national convention of
youth programs."
The evening's speakers also
included George Salem, a
youngster who has participated
in the program for four years,
who gave a first-hand account of
the impact of the program. "As 1
think back to before I was in the
Youth Program," he said, "I was
in a really troubled time. But
now things have worked out re

ally well." Later Joe Ruetz. di
rector ot athletics, spoke, stres
sing his department's commit
ment to the program and the
need for community support.
Ruetz "commended the program
highly to anyone who is in
terested in young people and
some of the problems they are
facing in today's society" and
pointed out that "it benefits not
only the youngsters, but even
more so the students who volun
teer."
Ten senior volunteers were
present to be honored at the ban
quet — two women and eight
men. Gibson commented on his
own experiences in closing: "1
have learned that growing up is
not justtobeyoung fora while. It
requires love, self-confidence
and friends. The Stanford Youth
Program helps kids grow up and
the community support shown
here tonight will insure our fu
ture successes."

service in our community. The
response was tremendous," said
senior Paul Gibson, director,
after acting as master of cere
monies of the program's second
annual banquet last Thursday
night.
Over 50 alumni and other
supporters of the program at
tended the banquet held at
Ming's Restaurant in Palo Alto.
Gibson stressed that the Youth
Program represents a positive at
titude on the part of the Athletic
Department both towards stu
dents and community.
Paraphrasing former director
Chris Avery, he said that "the
Athletic Program under Joe
Ruetz takes a real interest in its
athletes as individuals and
human beings — and the Youth
Program is proof of that."

The basis of the Youth Prog
ram is to provide a one-to-one
relationship for a youngster,
who is having problems at home
or at school, with a Stanford stu
dent. Originally conceived of as
a matching of Stanford athletes
with pre-delinquent boys, the
idea was first acted upon in the
early '60s by Congressman Pete
McCloskey and Skip Crist, then
attorneys in the aTea. The prog
ram died after three years, and
was only reinstated in 1971
under the sponsorship of Crist,
Dr. Stan Fischman, Chief of
Psychiatry at the Children's
Hospital and Chuck Taylor, Di
rector of Athletics.
In recent years the number of
volunteers working in the prog
ram has grown to 5 men and 25
women — athletes as well as
non-athletes. "We've got every
thing from Olympic Gold medal
winners to KZSIJ disc jockeys"
working as volunteers, Gibson
noted.

A year ago, at the first annual
banquet, Youth Program direc
tors Chris Avery and Duf Sun
dheim solicited financial sup
port for a nation-wide trip which
would establish youth programs
patterned after Stanford's at 12
major universities. Thursday's
banquet was highlighted by a
slideshow depicting the succes
ses of their trip. "We've estab
lished six very strong programs
— including ones at Harvard,
Wisconsin and the University of
Washington," said Sundheim,
"and we hope ultimately to
sponsor a national convention of
youth programs."
The evening's speakers also
included George Salem, a
youngster who has participated
in the program for four years,
who gave a first-hand account of
the impact of the program. "As 1
think back to before I was in the
Youth Program," he said, "I was
in a really troubled time. But
now things have worked out re

ally well." Later Joe Ruetz. di
rector ot athletics, spoke, stres
sing his department's commit
ment to the program and the
need for community support.
Ruetz "commended the program
highly to anyone who is in
terested in young people and
some of the problems they are
facing in today's society" and
pointed out that "it benefits not
only the youngsters, but even
more so the students who volun
teer."
Ten senior volunteers were
present to be honored at the ban
quet — two women and eight
men. Gibson commented on his
own experiences in closing: "1
have learned that growing up is
not justtobeyoung fora while. It
requires love, self-confidence
and friends. The Stanford Youth
Program helps kids grow up and
the community support shown
here tonight will insure our fu
ture successes."

shown here tonight for the Stan
