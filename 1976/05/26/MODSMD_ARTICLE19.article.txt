# Electronic marvels proliferate

From the National Geographic Society
Washington â€” Mickey
Mouse, mysticism and high
style are all part of the calculator
boom.
The small electronic marvels
sweeping the country offer
something for almost everybody.
One recent model designed for
junior math wizards bears an il
lustration of Mickey Mouse as

the Sorcerer's Apprentice. The
manufacturer claims it also
serves as an "excellent conversa
tion piece for young executives
on the way up."
Another new calculator in
cludes a device for charting a
person's physical, emotional
and intellectual cycles dictated
by a theory called "biorhythms."

For the fashion conscious,
there is a smart, new compact
sized model encased in sterling
silver. Price: $150, engraving
extra. The more practical
minded can buy writing and
figuring ability in one instru
ment. A stubby pen with a cal
culator built into its barrel is bil
led as almost "like a gadget from
a Buck Rogers movie."
Calculators have progressed
far beyond the gadgetry stage,
however. Everyone .from scien
tists to school children is using
them. One study predicts sales of
77 million units a year by 198 U.
The figure doesn't seem too
farfetched. Industry sales total
led in the millions last year and
are still climbing.
Married householders use cal
culators to check utility bills and
compute taxes. Farmers estimate
crop yields with them, and they
help businessmen calculate pro
fit and loss. Sports fans rely on
the devices to figure things like
bowling or batting averages.
"Life is too short for long divi
sion." says a contented business
executive who has jumped on
the electronic bandwagon.
Many of the nation's school
teachers tend to agree. By the
end of the eighth grade, students
should have small calculators

available in mathematics clas
ses, according to a report issued
by a group of leading scientists,
mathematicians and teachers.
"Calculators in no way di
minish the importance of school
mathematics instruction," said
the report, "but instead allow
students to feel the power of
mathematics and free time for
teachers to concentrate on the
conceptual aspects of the sub
ject, which are of fundamental
importance."
Some teachers and educators
disagree. Said one: "What we
need is more brain power and
less pocket power."
Despite the controversy, chil
dren and adults alike have be
come fascinated with the games
people can play with cal
culators. Paperback books de
scribe many of the games and
magic tricks possible with the
pocket wizards.
One game ends with eight di
gits which, turned upside down,
spell out the name of a large oil
company. Another involves two
players who take turns trying to
subtract a certain set of numbers
from a grand total. At the end of
the game, the numbers turned
upside down seem to spell out
either BLISS or'l LOSE, depend
ing on who wins the game.
