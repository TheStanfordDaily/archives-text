# Zeta Psi linked to Roble courts damage
## 
### Chris Baker Randy Keith 
Members of the Zeta Psi (Zetes)
fraternity held a tennis tournament
last Friday evening on the Roble
Courts which allegedly left the courts
pock-marked and littered.
"Apparently all they (Zetes) wanted
to do was hold a tennis tournament,"
said Physical Education Director Wes
Ruff, "hut it turned into a beer tennis
tournament."
Ruff said the Zetes removed signs
which were welded to posts. "They
were shot-putting metal beer kegs
around the courts and they left some
pock-marks," said Ruff. But he added
that no damage report has been
finished.
The Zetes also left "empty beer cups,
beer and upchuck," in their wake, he
said.
A student who visited the courts the
next morning took the matter to Uni
versity Ombudsman lohn Goheen,
who referred it to Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons, saying. "It's a matter
for the Dean's office."
Lyons said he has not had a chance
to look into the matter, but, "my first
reaction is that I'm unhappy." He
added that he would investigate the
incident.
Ruff said the Athletic Department
has not received any more complaints
about the condition of the courts, but.
"One student thought it was so bad

that it shouldn't be 'we'll pay the bill
and an apology' sort of thing."
Ruff said he thought the courts will
not have to be totally resurfaced.
The Zete tournament has allegedly
been held in the past at the Varsity
Tennis Courts but there have been no
previous reports of damage.
The University is also investigating
the trashing of four fraternities last
Thursday morning.
According to James Siena, legal ad
viser to the president, the members of
Delta Tau Delta fraternity (Delts) al
legedly involved in the incidents may
be charged under the Fundamental
Standard "if we can get sufficient evi
dence."
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson said he expects to have a re
port on the trashi ngs for Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton by this
morning.
Horton commented yesterday, "1
think we should do something
promptly."
Horton said two years ago that the
University had told the Delts "that if
such (destructive) activities do occur,
there will he a prompt and un
equivocal response by the University
. . . Residence privileges would be
withdrawn, this time perhaps perma
nently."
He commented yesterday that he ag
reed with that stand two years ago and
aerees with it now.
