How common is it for the inner lips of the female
genitals to protrude or hang doivn one-half to one
inch or more? Is this stretching possibly caused by
excess sex or masturbation'.'' I think it looks gross.
Vaginas, 1 ikt; any other portions of the human
anatomy, are available in a myriad of sizes and
shapes. Just because mother nature chose to outfit
your pudendum with the protruding labia minora
option is no reason to be upset. You're lucky you
didn't get a leather-upholstered interior.
Gross-looking or not (have you asked friends
what they think of it?), inner lips which extend
beyond the outer lips are not unusual. They don't
mean you masturbate too much or indulge in too
much sex tor even that your mother was born in
Toledo.

My girlfriend steadfastly refuses to have anal in
tercourse with me. Or with anybody else, for that
matter. I have tried every argument, but to no
avail. Please help me if you can.

Come on, not everybody enjoys the same things
equally. Why force her to do something that she
dislikes? Not only could she get upset if you
coerced her, but anal sex requires the complete
cooperation ofboth parties. It's liabletobe painful
if she is in the least bit nervous or upset.
As one Stanford coed put it."It takes confi
dence, relaxation and about half a tube of Vas
eline."
Look at it this way: Do you appreciate having a
seven-inch dildo shoved into your rectum? If so,
try to explain to her why it's an enjoyable act. If
not, maybe you should stick to the things that
excite you both.
Recently, you referred to u position where the
woman sits on top of the man. For this position,
does she face his feet or his head?
Why don't you try it both ways? This game
doesn't have any official rules, you know. The
only fouls are for causing pain. Or unwanted
babies.
