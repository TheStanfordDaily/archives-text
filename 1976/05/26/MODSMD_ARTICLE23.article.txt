## Can JRA nab IM crown? 
### Marko Fong George Anders 
What's put the Junipero Re
creation Association (JRA) at the
top of the all university IM point
standings?
An amalgam of Junipero resi
dents,their friends and "very
few people who you could call
real ringers," according to Han
son Nuuhiwa, a player on JRA's
"A" league volleyball team.
"A lot of good athletes who
put out a lot" and make up for
the absence of any "superb"
athletes, according to John
Kobashigawa, JRA's coor
dinator.
Whatever the key, JRA leads
perennial IM champion Theta
Delta Chi, and will clinch the IM
crown if it wins "A" league vol
leyball, according to
Kobashigawa.
R for 'Ringers'
It's been said the R in JRA
stands for "Ringers." But
Kobashigawa stated that of the
100 regular players for JRA, 60

are Junipero residents and most
of the others "have lived in the
house."
Mike Yee, another player,
added "we have a lot more
people to draw on, both people
off campus and people whose
dorm doesn't have a team in the
sport they want.
"But we don't really go out
and recruit people. People just
come to us and say they want to
p' a y"
Yee, termed "a great all
around athlete" by
Kobashigawa, said the believes
he has played 10 to 15 sports for
JRA. He did observe, "I don't
swim and I don't pitch horse
shoes."
But others do. Kobashigawa
was unable to estimate how
many teams JRA has fielded this
year, but said teams have com
peted in every event.
He added that JRAflooded
pingpong with 15-20 teams and
badminton with around 10 dou
bles entries. All this even though

only two teams per organization
are allowed to score.
Best and worst
The many JRA entries "in
clude some of the worst teams as
well as some of the best,"
Kobashigawa said. "One of our
basketball teams last year got
beat, 110-21," he recalled.

"A lot of guys want to play
who aren't that good," he added.
"They're just out for fun."
Kobashigawa said many of those
people compete on teams not
being scored for IM points.
Yee agreed, noting "People
who study a lot like to be on
teams where they can miss a
couple games. So we put them
on non-scoring teams."
In scoring events, JRA amas
sed 464 points by the end of
winter quarter, 42 points ahead
of the Theta Delts. A JRA win
this year would follow third
place final standings in 1972-3
and 1974-5 and a second in
1973-4.
Nuuhiwa said he is confident
JRA will win "A" league vol
leyball and the IM crown.
Kobashigawa was slightly more
cautious but pointed out that
JRA has the No. 1 seed in the
playoffs.
The team played quarterfinals
yesterday evening. Before the
game, Kobashigawa predicted
that "things might be very close"
in the race for the IM crown if
JRA does not win "A" league
volleyball.
In any case. JRA's success may
have already spawned an im
itator. Keith Nakada, IM co
ordinator for Burbank, this
year's highest scoring dorm
team, claims there is a semi
serious movement to form a
"Burbank Ringers Association."
