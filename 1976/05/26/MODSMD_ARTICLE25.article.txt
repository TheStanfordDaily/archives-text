# Cards find pay, families
## Alaska lures diamonders 
### Linda Buddenberg 
Looking for something new in
vacation ideas for this summer?
Consider Alaska. Takeinasun
that never sets, streams of rain
bow trout, watching wandering
herds of caribou, majestic peaks
and Stanford baseball players.
Stanford baseball players?
Every summer, there's a mass
exodus of some of the finest
Sunken Diamond talent to the
northern state. Why Alaska?
"There are a lot of summer
baseball programs within the
United States," explained ex-
Cardinal Bruce Robinson, "but
none can compare with those of
Alaska."
"The league up there is pretty
prestigious," said senior pitcher
Mike Williamson. "They only
take good, established varsity
ballplayers."
'Best caliber'
"You're playing against the
best caliber competition," added
freshman center fielder Larry
Reynolds. "You learn a lot play
ing against all those good
players."
"It helped me a lot, attitude
wise, playing against that kind
of competition," said pitcher
John Yandle.
And so, taking advantageof an
opportunity to continue playing
baseball for the summer, several
Stanford players will join vari
ous Alaska clubs for the eight

week season.
Reynolds and teammate Bruce
Fiala a pitcher, will play for
Fairbanks, according to Card
coach Ray Young. Catcher Bruce
Walters will compete for Kenai.
Last summer, second baseman
Dave Perez played for Kenai,
shortstop Steve Davis played in
Anchorage and Yandle, Wil
liamson, Reynolds and Robin
son joined Fairbanks.
For most players, the season
starts with a week-long "spring
training" in Hawaii. Then, the
team plays an eight-week
schedule against other Alaska
teams, followed by regional and
national play-offs, which Alaska
teams usually win.
Bats and balls
However, there's a lot more to
it than bats and balls. Players
said they become an important
part of the Alaskan town they
play for.
"Each player is placed with a
family for the summer at no ex
pense," explained Robinson.
Robinson has spent his past
three summers with the same
Fairbanks family and has
"grown very close to them."
"It's almost like you're doing
them a favor," commented Wil
liamson. "They volunteer to take
you and they want you to have a
good time."
Each town also provides jobs

for baseball players, ranging
from leading baseball clinics to
performing maintenance work
to doing odd jobs in a bank.
Lucrative salaries
Since these jobs come with
fairly lucrative salaries, baseball
players said they find it finan
cially attractive to return to
Alaska every summer.
"They have a lot of money to
give to players, so they can liter
ally buy good teams," said Wil
liamson. "They're really big on
baseball because there's not
much else to do in Fairbanks
during the summer, except
watch the streetwalkers."
Baseball is very important for
the locals â€” "the attendance is
tremendous," Robinson added.
Like any other tourists to
Alaska, the players also have
time to enjoy the Alaska outside
of baseball diamonds.
"Since you're traveling a lot,
you don't get tired of it," said
Yandle. "You get to see a lot of
Alaska."
'Rainbow trout'
"I caught two 20 inch rainbow
trout in an hour," said William
son. Several other players also
went fishing with their families.
Robinson listed "learning to fly
a single engine plane on the way
to and from fishing for 40 inch
pike" as one of his Alaska high
lights. "The old time saloons
with sawdust floors and fat
piano players, beer, pickles and
peanuts were fun, too," he ad
ded.
All of the players said their
summer baseball experience has
helped their seasons here.
Robinson,first round choice of
the Oakland A's in the college
draft last year and now playing
in the Oakland farm system,
noted that excellent competition
"helped speed my growth and
progress in the game."
Davis said that he developed
his power hitting in Anchorage
and then he became a long ball
hitter for the Cards.
Robinson summed up, "With
the nice families, the terrific
playing and traveling condi
tions, and the high wage rates,
it's no wonder that the Alaska
teams can acquire the top col
legiate players every year."
