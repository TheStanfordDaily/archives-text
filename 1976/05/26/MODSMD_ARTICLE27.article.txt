# Teacher to miss net NCAAs
## 
### Paul Bauman 
Surprises are already surfac
ing from Corpus Christi, Tex.,
the site of the 1976 NCAA Ten
nis Championships, and the
tournament has hardly begun.
One player who was supposed
to play won't, and another who
wasn't expected to play, appa
rently will as first-round play
began this morning.
UCLA's Brian Teacher, the
tournament's second seed, has
suffered a pulled muscle in his
right shoulder and isn't even in
Corpus Christi. Bruin freshman
John Austin will take his place
and, because of a new ruling,
will assume Teacher's second
seeding.
Bruins still favorite
Without Teacher, the top
ranking player in college, UCLA
is no longer the overwhelming
favorite to win its second
straight national championship.
Now the Bruins are just the favo
rites. Stanford, the second

ranked team in the country be
hind UCLA, USC (No. 3), and
Trinity (No. 4) are the prime con
tenders.
All-American Hank Pfister of
San Jose State, who has been out
all season with an ankle injury,
will return to competitive play
in the NCAAs. Pfister's reputa
tion alone was good enough to
get him "placed" with 15 other
players behind the 16 seeds.
Cards seeded
Stanford's Pat DuPre and Bill
Maze are among the seeds an
nounced yesterday for the
NCAAs. DuPre is seeded fourth
and Maze ninth. The Cards'
other two singles entries, Mark
and Matt Mitchell, did not make
the seedings, but were placed.
Peter Fleming of UCLA is the
tournament's first seed.
Both of Stanford's doubles
teams have been seeded. Maze
and DuPre are third and Matt
Mitchell and Perry Wright are
seventh.

In opening-round singles
matches today, DuPre plays Phil
Chamberlain of Memphis State,
Maze faces Terry Saunders from
Oklahoma City, Matt Mitchell
will meet Tom Bondohlen of
Georgia and Mark Mitchell goes
against Scott Dillon from North
Carolina State.
If some developments in Cor
pus Christi have been surpris
ing, the weather hasn't been.
Stanford coach Dick Gould said
it was 88 degrees Monday with
94 percent humidity and "toler
able" winds of 20 miles per hour.
