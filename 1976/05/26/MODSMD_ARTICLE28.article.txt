# Macrorie spears victories
## Also suffers disappointments, but throws on 
### Tom Atwood Jeff Parietti 
Javelin thrower John Macrorie strides up the
runway, unleashes his implement and watches
closely as it sails well out into the throwing area.
Macrorie looks on as the meet officials measure
his toss at 218 feet, some 11 feet more than his
previous best.
That was the scene for the Stanford senior at
last year's Pacific Association-AAU meet at the
College of San Mateo. According to Macrorie,
the throw was one of his more memorable. "I
wasn't expected to win there, but I knew I was
going to have a good day when all my warmup
throws were over 210," said Macrorie.
The Robber Baron originally was a long
jumper, leaping 22-9 in high school and 23 feet
at Fullerton JC, where he spent two years.
His first exposure to the javelin came when his
coach at Fullerton convinced Macrorie to take
up the decathlon, which includes a javelin
event.
Threw 200 feet
"My first week out, I threw the javelin over
200 feet," Macrorie said. "Most beginning
throwers start at around 180 feet."
Macrorie said he thought he might do well in
the event because "I figured I had a pretty good
arm. I was a quarterback and a baseball outfiel
der in high school."
He didn't do too bad in the decathlon either,
scoring 5800 points in an abbreviated eight
event decathlon once. He said he thinks he could
score 6200 points in a complete decathlon now.
But he has stuck to the javelin because as he
explained "the decathlon is prettv demanding
and takes a lot of time and work."
While at Fullerton, he concentrated mainly on
the long jump and did the javelin on the side,
registering a best of 205-7.
Won dual meets
This season, the southpaw Macrorie won
every Pacific-8 dual meet, including wins in
the USC and UCLA meets, before finishing a
disappointing last in the conference champion
ships with a toss of 199-9.
"I was disappointed with my performance in
the Pac-B's," he said. "It was the first time all
season that I hadn't thrown over 200." Macrorie
added that he had thrown his lifetime best of
219-9 a week earlier at the West Coast Relays in
Fresno, and said that he was possibly "a little let
down" going into the conference meet.
One person who shares his triumphs and his

disappointments is his wife, Linda, whom he
married while at Fullerton. "She helps me and
gives me support," he said. "She likes it (track).
She's not like other girls that fall asleep at track
meets."
Macrorie said his wife is more important than
javelin throwing. "I guess I tailor my life around
Linda, she's the most important thing in my
life," he said.
Conley helps
Encouragement and coaching also has come
from former U.S. Olympian Phil Conley, who
represented the U.S. in the Games during the
19505.
"Phil has helped me a lot and encouraged
me," said Macrorie. "He's basically a coach. He
gives advice, gives suggestions and tells us what
we are doing wrong, although he is not techni
cally a Stanford coach."
Macrorie especially needed encouragement
his sophomore year. He severely twisted his
right knee throwing the javelin in the first meet
of the season.
"It was a freak accident," he said. "I couldn't
even walk for awhile, but 1 kept throwing be
cause I wanted to get a scholarship somewhere."
Short approach
After the injury, instead of making the usual
running approach of about 30 yards, Macrorie
said "1 went about 10 yards, so I was basically
throwing standing still." He still managed to
throw over 200 feet in all the meets that year.
He didn't get a track scholarship here, but the
political science major did receive a California
State Scholarship.
Macrorie plans to continue throwing after
graduation. "Realistically, I think I can throw
about 260 plus eventually and maybe 240 this
year," he said.
Macrorie said he believes weight lifting helps,
but that technique is almost the most important
aspect of throwing the javelin.
Stanford track coach Payttm Jordan sees good
potential for Macrorie. "I think if time allows
and he continues throwing that he will get much
better. In about two more years, he should reach
his peak. He's really on the threshold of getting a
big throw if he wants to."
"I enjoy throwing the javelin," said Macrorie.
I think I have a long way to go potential-wise, I
don't know if I can do it, but I'll sure try."
Macrorie will be out there trying again at this
year's Pacific Association-AAU meet, to be
held June 6 at the College of San Mateo.

every Pacific-8 dual meet, including wins in
the USC and UCLA meets, before finishing a
disappointing last in the conference champion
ships with a toss of 199-9.
"I was disappointed with my performance in
the Pac-B's," he said. "It was the first time all
season that I hadn't thrown over 200." Macrorie
added that he had thrown his lifetime best of
219-9 a week earlier at the West Coast Relays in
Fresno, and said that he was possibly "a little let
down" going into the conference meet.
One person who shares his triumphs and his

disappointments is his wife, Linda, whom he
married while at Fullerton. "She helps me and
gives me support," he said. "She likes it (track).
She's not like other girls that fall asleep at track
meets."
Macrorie said his wife is more important than
javelin throwing. "I guess I tailor my life around
Linda, she's the most important thing in my
life," he said.
Conley helps
Encouragement and coaching also has come
from former U.S. Olympian Phil Conley, who
represented the U.S. in the Games during the
19505.
"Phil has helped me a lot and encouraged
me," said Macrorie. "He's basically a coach. He
gives advice, gives suggestions and tells us what
we are doing wrong, although he is not techni
cally a Stanford coach."
Macrorie especially needed encouragement
his sophomore year. He severely twisted his
right knee throwing the javelin in the first meet
of the season.
"It was a freak accident," he said. "I couldn't
even walk for awhile, but 1 kept throwing be
cause I wanted to get a scholarship somewhere."
Short approach
After the injury, instead of making the usual
running approach of about 30 yards, Macrorie
said "1 went about 10 yards, so I was basically
throwing standing still." He still managed to
throw over 200 feet in all the meets that year.
He didn't get a track scholarship here, but the
political science major did receive a California
State Scholarship.
Macrorie plans to continue throwing after
graduation. "Realistically, I think I can throw
about 260 plus eventually and maybe 240 this
year," he said.
Macrorie said he believes weight lifting helps,
but that technique is almost the most important
aspect of throwing the javelin.
Stanford track coach Payttm Jordan sees good
potential for Macrorie. "I think if time allows
and he continues throwing that he will get much
better. In about two more years, he should reach
his peak. He's really on the threshold of getting a
big throw if he wants to."
"I enjoy throwing the javelin," said Macrorie.
I think I have a long way to go potential-wise, I
don't know if I can do it, but I'll sure try."
Macrorie will be out there trying again at this
year's Pacific Association-AAU meet, to be
held June 6 at the College of San Mateo.

Javelin thrower John Macrorie strides up the
runway, unleashes his implement and watches
closely as it sails well out into the throwing area.
Macrorie looks on as the meet officials measure
his toss at 218 feet, some 11 feet more than his
previous best.
That was the scene for the Stanford senior at
last year's Pacific Association-AAU meet at the
College of San Mateo. According to Macrorie,
the throw was one of his more memorable. "I
wasn't expected to win there, but I knew I was
going to have a good day when all my warmup
throws were over 210," said Macrorie.
The Robber Baron originally was a long
jumper, leaping 22-9 in high school and 23 feet
at Fullerton JC, where he spent two years.
His first exposure to the javelin came when his
coach at Fullerton convinced Macrorie to take
up the decathlon, which includes a javelin
event.
Threw 200 feet
"My first week out, I threw the javelin over
200 feet," Macrorie said. "Most beginning
throwers start at around 180 feet."
Macrorie said he thought he might do well in
the event because "I figured I had a pretty good
arm. I was a quarterback and a baseball outfiel
der in high school."
He didn't do too bad in the decathlon either,
scoring 5800 points in an abbreviated eight
event decathlon once. He said he thinks he could
score 6200 points in a complete decathlon now.
But he has stuck to the javelin because as he
explained "the decathlon is prettv demanding
and takes a lot of time and work."
While at Fullerton, he concentrated mainly on
the long jump and did the javelin on the side,
registering a best of 205-7.

throw over 200 feet in all the meets that year.
He didn't get a track scholarship here, but the
political science major did receive a California
State Scholarship.
Macrorie plans to continue throwing after
graduation. "Realistically, I think I can throw
about 260 plus eventually and maybe 240 this
year," he said.
Macrorie said he believes weight lifting helps,
but that technique is almost the most important
aspect of throwing the javelin.
Stanford track coach Payttm Jordan sees good
potential for Macrorie. "I think if time allows
and he continues throwing that he will get much
better. In about two more years, he should reach
his peak. He's really on the threshold of getting a
big throw if he wants to."
"I enjoy throwing the javelin," said Macrorie.
I think I have a long way to go potential-wise, I
don't know if I can do it, but I'll sure try."
Macrorie will be out there trying again at this
year's Pacific Association-AAU meet, to be
held June 6 at the College of San Mateo.
