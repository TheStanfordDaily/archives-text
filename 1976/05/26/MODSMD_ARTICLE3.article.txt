# Construction delay possible
## Med Center's addition violates building code 
### Dave Ansley First of two parts 
Building code violations may delay
the completion of the Stanford Medi
cal Center's new $12.6 million wing
until early September, according to the
University's planning office.
Completion of the new facility,
which will expand the hospital's in
tensive care, emergency and postanes
thesia recovery services, had been
scheduled for this month.
Meanwhile, turmoil is stirring over
one construction deficiency — a 60-
foot ramp between the operating
rooms and the recovery rooms —
which some doctors say is dangerous.
Phil Williams, director of planning
for the University, said last week that
an April inspection of the facility by
local, state and federal officials turned
up "50 to 60 relatively minor items"
that did not meet code requirements.
They will have to be corrected before
the building can house patients.
More problems
"There are more problems in this
building than are typical," he said.
Contractors are already correcting
many of the construction mistakes, al
though a complete consolidated report
by all the inspecting agencies has not
yet been released.
Neither Williams nor senior planner
James Brenner expect the report to re
quire that the controversial ramp be
rebuilt, although the planners admit
that it violates one code.
The ramp rises V/ 2 feet, connecting a
second-floor corridor in the old build
ing to one in the new wing. The operat
ing rooms are in the old section; the
recovery rooms in the new section.
The ramp's slope is within legal
standards, Williams said, but regula
tions also require a level section every
30 feet and the ramp does not have one.
Brenner said that the governing
agencies (in this case the U.S. Depart
ment of Health, Education and Wel
fare) "use some discretion" in enforc
ing the codes. He said he does not ex
pect officials to order corrections that
would he "impractical to implement."
He added, "The ramp would be a
major undertaking to change."
'Dangerous'
Del fin J. Beltran. a former director of
the Intensive Care Unit at the hospital,
said that the ramp will be "very
dangerous" for patients who are
wheeled over it. The elevation of a pa
tient's feet or head would amount to
"either eivinß him 500 cc's of blood or

draining 500 cc's," he said.
This "could prove to be very dif
ficult for patients under anesthesia,"
he explained.
"Every patient that has surgery at
Stanford Hospital will at some time
have to go up and down that ramp,"
Beltran said. Last year, some 10,000
persons underwent surgery which re
quired use of the recovery rooms.
Eugene Dong, a cardiac surgeon,
said he is concerned with the "safety
factor" involved in pushing intensive
care patients up and down the slope.
The special beds weigh "at least 600
pounds" with patients in them and
there is "an obvious danger" of runa
way beds, he said.
Upset but hesitant
Many other hospital staff members
are apparently upset with the build
ing's shortcomings, but are hesitant to
discuss the issue publicly. Beltran is
no longer an employe of the medical
center, but often works there with car
diac patients in connection with his

private anesthesiology practice.
The ramp is "not optimum, but it's
workable," said Williams, adding that
he felt "people are being overly criti
cal. Once they begin work in it, they'll
find it's better than average."
Original plans for the wing called
for the new second floor to be level
with the old second floor. Because the
floors in the new wing are farther apart
than in the original building, 3'/2 feet
of extra excavation would have been
necessary before construction could
have begun, according to Brenner.
To cut costs, the excavation was
canceled. The connecting ramp in
question was one of several added dur
ing planning of the building in 1973,
he said.
Decision
Brenner recalled that the decision to
include the ramps was made by the
planning office and medical center of
ficials, including Vice President for
Medical Affairs Clayton Rich, then-

CODE VIOLATIONS — The completion of the Medical Center's new $12.6
million wing may be delayed because of building code violations. Turmoil is
stirring over a construction deficiency on this 60-foot ramp between the
operating rooms and the recovery rooms, which some doctors say is danger
ous.
