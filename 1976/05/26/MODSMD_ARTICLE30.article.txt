Ford defends Kissinger, arms talks
I,OS ANGELES — President Ford, declaring
American foreign policy must not be "political
football," said yesterday he will not let Henry Kis
singer go "because he has been a darn good secret
ary of state."
And the President said if he gets a good nuclear
arms agreement with the Russians, he will submit it
to Congress, "whether it hurts me or helps me in
this election."
Both declarations, made before the Los Angeles
Press Club, responded to attacks on the Ford ad
ministration by the President's Republican chal
lenger, Ronald Reagan.
Reagan consistently has made Kissinger a cam
paign issue and has accused him of giving away too
much to the Soviets in nuclear arms talks and other
matters of detente.
Kissinger has said he would prefer to step down
as secretary of state if Ford wants him to after the
November elections.
The President was campaigning for a third
straight day for votes in California's important June
H primary while awaiting results in six primaries
held in other states yesterday.
Ford reviewed his foreign policy and economic
gains during 21 months as President inhisappear
ance before the Los Angeles Press Club.
He said it was absolutely necessary that the Un
ited States and Russia achieve a second-phase nuc
lear arms agreement "to further reduce the danger
of a runaway arms race and risk of nuclear
holocaust. Whenever I get a good agreement that
protects the interests of the United States, I will
send it to the United States Senate whether it hurts
me or helps me in this election," Ford said.
In a question and answer session he was asked if
he considered Kissinger a political liability. He re
plied, "When you look at the foreign policy of this
country, we have achieved peace, we are maintain
ing it and we have the opportunity to continue it."
Rep. Hays denies paying mistress
WASHINGTON — Rep. Wayne Hays (D-Ohio)
admitted yesterday to having a "relationship" with
a woman who claimed she was paid a $14,000-a
-year congressional salary to serve as Hays' mistress.
Hays, however, in an emotional speech to his
colleagues, denied the woman had been hired for
her sexual favors.
"I was legally separated and single. It was volun
tary on her part and mine," he said.
Mays said he was making the public acknow
ledgement in an attempt to repair the damage to his
six-week-old marriage that stemmed from the as
sertions ofElizabeth Ray, the woman with whom he
had had the relationship.
"Only time will tell if Miss Ray has been success
ful in destroying my career. I pray to God she has
not destroyed my marriage," he said.
Ray's statements concerning her relationship
with Hays were first published in the Washington

Hays' sexual desires.
Hays said he angered Rav when he told her their

relationship would have to end after his April mar

the relationship ended with his marriage. She said
she and Ray have seen each other four times since,
and had been intimate twice.
"I'm not taking anything back," she told CBS.
"I'm telling the truth."
Bomb kills two at Tel Aviv airport
TEL AVIV — A bomb concealed in a suitcase
exploded at Israel's main airport yesterday after a
woman security guard ordered a traveler to open
the luggage, officials said. Both were killed and at
least 10 others were injured.
An airport worker said the blond man carrying
the case was "blown to pieces. The security girl
next to him was crushed like a leaf."
A second suitcase bomb went off a half-hour later
as police dragged it from the arrival hall of Ben
Gurion International Airport. This one caused no
damage or casualties.
In Beirut, the radical Popular Front for the Libera
tion of Palestine claimed responsibility for the blast
and said the attack was carried out in the name "of
the uprising in the occupied lands of Palestine."
Airport police said the man who was carrying the
bag had a Dutch passport in the name of Hugo
Miller.
Airport manager Ezra Ballas told a news confer
ence that "a passenger arriving on a foreign airline
— he was a European — was suspected by security
checkers. He was taken to a search booth and was
asked to open his hand luggage. As he opened the
case it exploded."
The blast, at 2:45 p.m.,5:45 a.m. POT.shattered a
glass wall. A second security guard who was near
the explosion was reported in critical condition at a
Tel Aviv hospital with burns over most of his body.
Police dispute monster kidnap story
EUREKA — Humboldt County authorities,
angered by the silence and mystery surrounding a
young beautician's claim of weekend captivity by a
hairy beast, branded the story a hoax yesterday.
Sheriff Gene Cox called the incident "a fabrica
tion" and his principal associate, Sgt. Frank Wig
ginton, dismissed it as "a bunch of garbage."
Cox said the woman, Cherie Darvell, 23, of Red
ding, has refused to answer questions from officers,
declined a medical examination and rejected a re
quest to take a polygraph examination.
The woman remained hospitalized at Humboldt
Medical Center at Hoopa where she was taken
Monday night when she was found screaming at a
rural resort. A hospital spokesman said she has
refused to receive visitors or telephone calls but
was treated for scratches on her arms.
The woman's friends, who reported the alleged
abduction Saturday, have also been uncooperative,
he said. Darvell, he added, said she does not re
member anything.
"Their total lack of cooperation with investigat
ing authorities indicates that the whole thing is a
fabrication and has no connection with any mysti
cal animal which they alleged kidnaped the girl,"
Cox said.
He said that Darvell, an unemployed beauty oper

ator , was missing a tennis shoe when found. He
said the fact that she was wearing clean and untorn
clothes and had on fresh perfume did not lend
credibility to her story of a terrifying weekend in
rugged mountain terrain.
Grape growers to advertise more?
SACRAMENTO — A bill that would allow the
California Table Grape Growers Commission to
spend $1.5 million a year more on advertising has
reached the Senate floor.
The Senate Finance Committee approved the
measure by Sen. George Zenovich (D-Fresno), that
would increase the assessment limit to 43 cents per
100 pounds of grapes.
The current limit is 19 cents per 100 pounds.
Zenovich compared the promotional campaign
for grapes to that of milk drinking, and said the
grape growers pay the cost.
Sen. Dennis Carpenter (R-Newport Beach), asked
whether consumers would pay the $1.5 million in
the end.
Zenovich said he assumed that the costs would
be passed on to consumers.
The committee approved the bill Monday with
out a dissenting vote.
Concorde jets leave Washington
WASHINGTON —Two British-French Concorde
supersonic passenger planes thundered out of Dul
les International Airport yesterday carrying pas
sengers from the United States to London and Paris
at faster-than-sound speeds for the first time.
The departures came one day after the inaugural
supersonic flights from the two European capitals
to Dulles International outside Washington. A large
crowd of sightseers cheered as the two planes lifted
off for the less-than-four-hour journey across the
Atlantic Ocean.
The planes appeared no noisier than other jets to
persons near the terminal building but the story
was different further down the flight path.
The Federal Aviation Administration's prelimi
nary noise measurements showed the Air France
plane, first to leave, was more than IV2 times louder
than any other plane to use the runway during the
day.
The FAA said the plane registered 129 perceived
noise decibels (PNdßs) when measured under the
flight path about four miles from the takeoff point.
That contrasted with readings of 102, 111 and 113
PNdßs registered earlier by three departing Boeing
707s — generally considered one of the loudest of
the subsonic jets.
Since an increase of 10 decibels on the PNdB
scale means the noise has doubled in intensity, the
Air France Concorde was about 160 percent louder
than the loudest of the Boeing 7075.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. A little warmer today.
Lows both nights in upper 40s to mid 50s. Highs
today and tomorrow in the mid 70s to mid 80s.
Winds mostly northwest 10 to 20 mph afternoons.

Concorde jets leave Washington
WASHINGTON —Two British-French Concorde
supersonic passenger planes thundered out of Dul
les International Airport yesterday carrying pas
sengers from the United States to London and Paris
at faster-than-sound speeds for the first time.
The departures came one day after the inaugural
supersonic flights from the two European capitals
to Dulles International outside Washington. A large
crowd of sightseers cheered as the two planes lifted
off for the less-than-four-hour journey across the
Atlantic Ocean.
The planes appeared no noisier than other jets to
persons near the terminal building but the story
was different further down the flight path.
The Federal Aviation Administration's prelimi
nary noise measurements showed the Air France
plane, first to leave, was more than IV2 times louder
than any other plane to use the runway during the
day.
The FAA said the plane registered 129 perceived
noise decibels (PNdßs) when measured under the
flight path about four miles from the takeoff point.
That contrasted with readings of 102, 111 and 113
PNdßs registered earlier by three departing Boeing
707s — generally considered one of the loudest of
the subsonic jets.
Since an increase of 10 decibels on the PNdB
scale means the noise has doubled in intensity, the
Air France Concorde was about 160 percent louder
than the loudest of the Boeing 7075.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. A little warmer today.
Lows both nights in upper 40s to mid 50s. Highs
today and tomorrow in the mid 70s to mid 80s.
Winds mostly northwest 10 to 20 mph afternoons.
Ford defends Kissinger, arms talks
I,OS ANGELES — President Ford, declaring
American foreign policy must not be "political
football," said yesterday he will not let Henry Kis
singer go "because he has been a darn good secret
ary of state."
And the President said if he gets a good nuclear
arms agreement with the Russians, he will submit it
to Congress, "whether it hurts me or helps me in
this election."
Both declarations, made before the Los Angeles
Press Club, responded to attacks on the Ford ad
ministration by the President's Republican chal
lenger, Ronald Reagan.
Reagan consistently has made Kissinger a cam
paign issue and has accused him of giving away too
much to the Soviets in nuclear arms talks and other
matters of detente.
Kissinger has said he would prefer to step down
as secretary of state if Ford wants him to after the
November elections.
The President was campaigning for a third
straight day for votes in California's important June
H primary while awaiting results in six primaries
held in other states yesterday.
Ford reviewed his foreign policy and economic
gains during 21 months as President inhisappear
ance before the Los Angeles Press Club.
He said it was absolutely necessary that the Un
ited States and Russia achieve a second-phase nuc
lear arms agreement "to further reduce the danger
of a runaway arms race and risk of nuclear
holocaust. Whenever I get a good agreement that
protects the interests of the United States, I will
send it to the United States Senate whether it hurts
me or helps me in this election," Ford said.
In a question and answer session he was asked if
he considered Kissinger a political liability. He re
plied, "When you look at the foreign policy of this
country, we have achieved peace, we are maintain
ing it and we have the opportunity to continue it."
Rep. Hays denies paying mistress
WASHINGTON — Rep. Wayne Hays (D-Ohio)
admitted yesterday to having a "relationship" with
a woman who claimed she was paid a $14,000-a

Hays, however, in an emotional speech to his
colleagues, denied the woman had been hired for
her sexual favors.
"I was legally separated and single. It was volun

Mays said he was making the public acknow

six-week-old marriage that stemmed from the as

Bomb kills two at Tel Aviv airport
TEL AVIV — A bomb concealed in a suitcase
exploded at Israel's main airport yesterday after a
woman security guard ordered a traveler to open
the luggage, officials said. Both were killed and at
least 10 others were injured.
An airport worker said the blond man carrying
the case was "blown to pieces. The security girl
next to him was crushed like a leaf."
A second suitcase bomb went off a half-hour later
as police dragged it from the arrival hall of Ben
Gurion International Airport. This one caused no
damage or casualties.
In Beirut, the radical Popular Front for the Libera
tion of Palestine claimed responsibility for the blast
and said the attack was carried out in the name "of
the uprising in the occupied lands of Palestine."
Airport police said the man who was carrying the
bag had a Dutch passport in the name of Hugo
Miller.
Airport manager Ezra Ballas told a news confer
ence that "a passenger arriving on a foreign airline
— he was a European — was suspected by security
checkers. He was taken to a search booth and was
asked to open his hand luggage. As he opened the
case it exploded."
The blast, at 2:45 p.m.,5:45 a.m. POT.shattered a
glass wall. A second security guard who was near
the explosion was reported in critical condition at a
Tel Aviv hospital with burns over most of his body.
Police dispute monster kidnap story
EUREKA — Humboldt County authorities,
angered by the silence and mystery surrounding a
young beautician's claim of weekend captivity by a
hairy beast, branded the story a hoax yesterday.
Sheriff Gene Cox called the incident "a fabrica
tion" and his principal associate, Sgt. Frank Wig
ginton, dismissed it as "a bunch of garbage."
Cox said the woman, Cherie Darvell, 23, of Red
ding, has refused to answer questions from officers,
declined a medical examination and rejected a re
quest to take a polygraph examination.
The woman remained hospitalized at Humboldt
Medical Center at Hoopa where she was taken
Monday night when she was found screaming at a
rural resort. A hospital spokesman said she has
refused to receive visitors or telephone calls but
was treated for scratches on her arms.
The woman's friends, who reported the alleged
abduction Saturday, have also been uncooperative,
he said. Darvell, he added, said she does not re
member anything.
"Their total lack of cooperation with investigat
ing authorities indicates that the whole thing is a
fabrication and has no connection with any mysti
cal animal which they alleged kidnaped the girl,"
Cox said.
He said that Darvell, an unemployed beauty oper

ator , was missing a tennis shoe when found. He
said the fact that she was wearing clean and untorn
clothes and had on fresh perfume did not lend
credibility to her story of a terrifying weekend in
rugged mountain terrain.
Grape growers to advertise more?
SACRAMENTO — A bill that would allow the
California Table Grape Growers Commission to
spend $1.5 million a year more on advertising has
reached the Senate floor.
The Senate Finance Committee approved the
measure by Sen. George Zenovich (D-Fresno), that
would increase the assessment limit to 43 cents per
100 pounds of grapes.
The current limit is 19 cents per 100 pounds.
Zenovich compared the promotional campaign
for grapes to that of milk drinking, and said the
grape growers pay the cost.
Sen. Dennis Carpenter (R-Newport Beach), asked
whether consumers would pay the $1.5 million in
the end.
Zenovich said he assumed that the costs would
be passed on to consumers.

Concorde jets leave Washington
WASHINGTON —Two British-French Concorde
supersonic passenger planes thundered out of Dul
les International Airport yesterday carrying pas
sengers from the United States to London and Paris
at faster-than-sound speeds for the first time.
The departures came one day after the inaugural
supersonic flights from the two European capitals
to Dulles International outside Washington. A large
crowd of sightseers cheered as the two planes lifted
off for the less-than-four-hour journey across the
Atlantic Ocean.
The planes appeared no noisier than other jets to
persons near the terminal building but the story
was different further down the flight path.
The Federal Aviation Administration's prelimi
nary noise measurements showed the Air France
plane, first to leave, was more than IV2 times louder
than any other plane to use the runway during the
day.
The FAA said the plane registered 129 perceived
noise decibels (PNdßs) when measured under the
flight path about four miles from the takeoff point.
That contrasted with readings of 102, 111 and 113
PNdßs registered earlier by three departing Boeing
707s — generally considered one of the loudest of
the subsonic jets.
Since an increase of 10 decibels on the PNdB
scale means the noise has doubled in intensity, the
Air France Concorde was about 160 percent louder
than the loudest of the Boeing 7075.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. A little warmer today.
Lows both nights in upper 40s to mid 50s. Highs

Ford defends Kissinger, arms talks
I,OS ANGELES — President Ford, declaring
American foreign policy must not be "political
football," said yesterday he will not let Henry Kis
singer go "because he has been a darn good secret
ary of state."
And the President said if he gets a good nuclear
arms agreement with the Russians, he will submit it
to Congress, "whether it hurts me or helps me in
this election."
Both declarations, made before the Los Angeles
Press Club, responded to attacks on the Ford ad
ministration by the President's Republican chal
lenger, Ronald Reagan.
Reagan consistently has made Kissinger a cam
paign issue and has accused him of giving away too
much to the Soviets in nuclear arms talks and other
matters of detente.
Kissinger has said he would prefer to step down
as secretary of state if Ford wants him to after the
November elections.
The President was campaigning for a third
straight day for votes in California's important June
H primary while awaiting results in six primaries
held in other states yesterday.
Ford reviewed his foreign policy and economic
gains during 21 months as President inhisappear
ance before the Los Angeles Press Club.
He said it was absolutely necessary that the Un
ited States and Russia achieve a second-phase nuc
lear arms agreement "to further reduce the danger
of a runaway arms race and risk of nuclear
holocaust. Whenever I get a good agreement that
protects the interests of the United States, I will
send it to the United States Senate whether it hurts
me or helps me in this election," Ford said.
In a question and answer session he was asked if
he considered Kissinger a political liability. He re
plied, "When you look at the foreign policy of this
country, we have achieved peace, we are maintain
ing it and we have the opportunity to continue it."
Rep. Hays denies paying mistress
WASHINGTON — Rep. Wayne Hays (D-Ohio)
admitted yesterday to having a "relationship" with
a woman who claimed she was paid a $14,000-a

Hays, however, in an emotional speech to his
colleagues, denied the woman had been hired for
her sexual favors.
"I was legally separated and single. It was volun

six-week-old marriage that stemmed from the as

Bomb kills two at Tel Aviv airport
TEL AVIV — A bomb concealed in a suitcase
exploded at Israel's main airport yesterday after a
woman security guard ordered a traveler to open
the luggage, officials said. Both were killed and at
least 10 others were injured.
An airport worker said the blond man carrying
the case was "blown to pieces. The security girl
next to him was crushed like a leaf."
A second suitcase bomb went off a half-hour later
as police dragged it from the arrival hall of Ben
Gurion International Airport. This one caused no
damage or casualties.
In Beirut, the radical Popular Front for the Libera
tion of Palestine claimed responsibility for the blast
and said the attack was carried out in the name "of
the uprising in the occupied lands of Palestine."
Airport police said the man who was carrying the
bag had a Dutch passport in the name of Hugo
Miller.
Airport manager Ezra Ballas told a news confer
ence that "a passenger arriving on a foreign airline
— he was a European — was suspected by security
checkers. He was taken to a search booth and was
asked to open his hand luggage. As he opened the
case it exploded."
The blast, at 2:45 p.m.,5:45 a.m. POT.shattered a
glass wall. A second security guard who was near
the explosion was reported in critical condition at a
Tel Aviv hospital with burns over most of his body.
Police dispute monster kidnap story

Bomb kills two at Tel Aviv airport
TEL AVIV — A bomb concealed in a suitcase
exploded at Israel's main airport yesterday after a
woman security guard ordered a traveler to open
the luggage, officials said. Both were killed and at
least 10 others were injured.
An airport worker said the blond man carrying
the case was "blown to pieces. The security girl
next to him was crushed like a leaf."
A second suitcase bomb went off a half-hour later
as police dragged it from the arrival hall of Ben
Gurion International Airport. This one caused no
damage or casualties.
In Beirut, the radical Popular Front for the Libera
tion of Palestine claimed responsibility for the blast
and said the attack was carried out in the name "of
the uprising in the occupied lands of Palestine."
Airport police said the man who was carrying the
bag had a Dutch passport in the name of Hugo
Miller.
Airport manager Ezra Ballas told a news confer
ence that "a passenger arriving on a foreign airline
— he was a European — was suspected by security
checkers. He was taken to a search booth and was
asked to open his hand luggage. As he opened the
case it exploded."
The blast, at 2:45 p.m.,5:45 a.m. POT.shattered a
glass wall. A second security guard who was near
the explosion was reported in critical condition at a
Tel Aviv hospital with burns over most of his body.
Police dispute monster kidnap story
EUREKA — Humboldt County authorities,
angered by the silence and mystery surrounding a
young beautician's claim of weekend captivity by a
hairy beast, branded the story a hoax yesterday.
Sheriff Gene Cox called the incident "a fabrica
tion" and his principal associate, Sgt. Frank Wig
ginton, dismissed it as "a bunch of garbage."
Cox said the woman, Cherie Darvell, 23, of Red
ding, has refused to answer questions from officers,
declined a medical examination and rejected a re
quest to take a polygraph examination.
The woman remained hospitalized at Humboldt
Medical Center at Hoopa where she was taken
Monday night when she was found screaming at a
rural resort. A hospital spokesman said she has
refused to receive visitors or telephone calls but
was treated for scratches on her arms.
The woman's friends, who reported the alleged
abduction Saturday, have also been uncooperative,
he said. Darvell, he added, said she does not re
member anything.
"Their total lack of cooperation with investigat
ing authorities indicates that the whole thing is a
fabrication and has no connection with any mysti
cal animal which they alleged kidnaped the girl,"
Cox said.
He said that Darvell, an unemployed beauty oper

ator , was missing a tennis shoe when found. He
said the fact that she was wearing clean and untorn
clothes and had on fresh perfume did not lend
credibility to her story of a terrifying weekend in
rugged mountain terrain.
Grape growers to advertise more?
SACRAMENTO — A bill that would allow the
California Table Grape Growers Commission to
spend $1.5 million a year more on advertising has
reached the Senate floor.
The Senate Finance Committee approved the
measure by Sen. George Zenovich (D-Fresno), that
would increase the assessment limit to 43 cents per
100 pounds of grapes.
The current limit is 19 cents per 100 pounds.
Zenovich compared the promotional campaign
for grapes to that of milk drinking, and said the
grape growers pay the cost.
Sen. Dennis Carpenter (R-Newport Beach), asked
whether consumers would pay the $1.5 million in
the end.
Zenovich said he assumed that the costs would
be passed on to consumers.
The committee approved the bill Monday with
out a dissenting vote.
Concorde jets leave Washington
WASHINGTON —Two British-French Concorde
supersonic passenger planes thundered out of Dul
les International Airport yesterday carrying pas
sengers from the United States to London and Paris
at faster-than-sound speeds for the first time.
The departures came one day after the inaugural
supersonic flights from the two European capitals
to Dulles International outside Washington. A large
crowd of sightseers cheered as the two planes lifted
off for the less-than-four-hour journey across the
Atlantic Ocean.
The planes appeared no noisier than other jets to
persons near the terminal building but the story
was different further down the flight path.
The Federal Aviation Administration's prelimi
nary noise measurements showed the Air France
plane, first to leave, was more than IV2 times louder
than any other plane to use the runway during the
day.
The FAA said the plane registered 129 perceived
noise decibels (PNdßs) when measured under the
flight path about four miles from the takeoff point.
That contrasted with readings of 102, 111 and 113
PNdßs registered earlier by three departing Boeing
707s — generally considered one of the loudest of
the subsonic jets.
Since an increase of 10 decibels on the PNdB
scale means the noise has doubled in intensity, the
Air France Concorde was about 160 percent louder
than the loudest of the Boeing 7075.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. A little warmer today.
Lows both nights in upper 40s to mid 50s. Highs
today and tomorrow in the mid 70s to mid 80s.
Winds mostly northwest 10 to 20 mph afternoons.
Ford defends Kissinger, arms talks
I,OS ANGELES — President Ford, declaring
American foreign policy must not be "political
football," said yesterday he will not let Henry Kis
singer go "because he has been a darn good secret
ary of state."
And the President said if he gets a good nuclear
arms agreement with the Russians, he will submit it
to Congress, "whether it hurts me or helps me in
this election."
Both declarations, made before the Los Angeles
Press Club, responded to attacks on the Ford ad
ministration by the President's Republican chal
lenger, Ronald Reagan.
Reagan consistently has made Kissinger a cam
paign issue and has accused him of giving away too
much to the Soviets in nuclear arms talks and other
matters of detente.
Kissinger has said he would prefer to step down
as secretary of state if Ford wants him to after the
November elections.
The President was campaigning for a third
straight day for votes in California's important June
H primary while awaiting results in six primaries
held in other states yesterday.
Ford reviewed his foreign policy and economic
gains during 21 months as President inhisappear
ance before the Los Angeles Press Club.
He said it was absolutely necessary that the Un
ited States and Russia achieve a second-phase nuc
lear arms agreement "to further reduce the danger
of a runaway arms race and risk of nuclear
holocaust. Whenever I get a good agreement that
protects the interests of the United States, I will
send it to the United States Senate whether it hurts
me or helps me in this election," Ford said.
In a question and answer session he was asked if
he considered Kissinger a political liability. He re
plied, "When you look at the foreign policy of this
country, we have achieved peace, we are maintain
ing it and we have the opportunity to continue it."
Rep. Hays denies paying mistress
WASHINGTON — Rep. Wayne Hays (D-Ohio)
admitted yesterday to having a "relationship" with
a woman who claimed she was paid a $14,000-a
-year congressional salary to serve as Hays' mistress.
Hays, however, in an emotional speech to his
colleagues, denied the woman had been hired for
her sexual favors.
"I was legally separated and single. It was volun
tary on her part and mine," he said.
Mays said he was making the public acknow
ledgement in an attempt to repair the damage to his
six-week-old marriage that stemmed from the as
sertions ofElizabeth Ray, the woman with whom he
had had the relationship.
"Only time will tell if Miss Ray has been success
ful in destroying my career. I pray to God she has
not destroyed my marriage," he said.
Ray's statements concerning her relationship
with Hays were first published in the Washington
Post on Sunday. She said that she had been retained
<isa member of the House Administration Commit
tee staff but that her only duties were to satisfy
Hays' sexual desires.
Hays said he angered Rav when he told her their

relationship would have to end after his April mar
riage, but in an interview with CBS, Ray denied that
the relationship ended with his marriage. She said
she and Ray have seen each other four times since,
and had been intimate twice.
"I'm not taking anything back," she told CBS.
"I'm telling the truth."
