### 
From the Associated Press
President Cerald Ford won the Ten
nessee, Kentucky and Oregon presi
dential primary elections last night.
Republican challenger Ronald Reagan
easily captured Nevada, Idaho and Ar
kansas.
In Democratic competition, Sen.
Frank Church of Idaho put new punch
into the effort to stop Jimmy Carter by
beating him in the Oregon primary.
Church called it "a tremendous,
gratifying victory."
California Gov. Edmund Brown won
the Democratic primary in Nevada,
leaving Carter a far-back second.
Carter, meanwhile, won by land
slides in Kentucky, Tennessee and Ar
kansas.
Church won as expected in his home
primary in Idaho.
In terms of Republican delegates,
the incomplete returns pointed to a
gain of 100 for Reagan, 76 for Ford. But
