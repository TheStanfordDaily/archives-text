# 'Familiar coalition' led march â€” Lyman
## 
### Geoff Samuels 
President Richard Lyman said last night that it "seems to be an annual event
that we have an issue or a couple of issues that involve a rather familiar
coalition of forces."
Commenting on yesterday's human rights march during KZSU's Campus
Conference, Lyman said, "One is forced to wonder sometimes whether the
issue that is supposedly uppermost is always what's really uppermost in
people's minds.

"The issues may be very different,
but the coalition that lines up bears a
remarkable resemblance to the pre
ceeding year's coalition."
In remarks following a discussion of
the University's position on the rights
and condition of gays here, Lyman
cautioned that he "was not trying to
build any kind of conspiracy theory."
He said, "I don't think that there's
anything particularly ominous about
it. I simply mean that since the issues
vary so much from year to year, one is
led to a certain expectation that, with
out knowing what the issue will be,
there will be one."
'Groups change'
Asked about the continuity of the
groups in the coalition, he said that
"the groups change and develop over
time." He refused to name the various
groups, however.
Lyman said that no decision had
been reached on the (human rights)
petition.
However, he said there has not been
any question as to whether anyone is
not in favor of human rights and non
discrimination.
The issue, he said, revolves around
whether there is an "urgent need of a
single policy, either in place of. or as a
supplement to, the policies we now
have and whether one achieves the
ends people have in mind in signing
these petitions by creating a fresh
mechanism of some kind in protecting
those rights."
Lyman noted that over the past sev
eral years a "great deal" of machinery
had been created to handle grievances
against the University.
"I don't see a case being made, al
though maybe one is forthcoming,
against our present practices sufficient
to justify putting in place a fresh set of
machinery."
Differentiate
Lyman stressed the need to differen
tiate between thu issue of tolerance,
mutual respect and hospitableatmos
phere, and the issue of whether deci
sions are made in the structure of the
University which improperly consider
sexual orientation.
He quoted a memo from Acting Pro
vost William Massy to Richard
Thomas, community relations coor
dinator for the Gay Peoples Union. In
the memo, Massy said that the protec
tion being asked for in the human
rights policy is already here.
Lyman added that he had not heard
of "anybody making, or trying to
make, a case for the proposition that
decisions in various student areas are
now in fact being made on a dis
criminatory basis in relation to any of
the criteria set forth in the statement."
He commented. "General under
standing and tolerance is not always
best met by legislation."

In remarks following a discussion of
the University's position on the rights
and condition of gays here, Lyman
cautioned that he "was not trying to
build any kind of conspiracy theory."
He said, "I don't think that there's
anything particularly ominous about
it. I simply mean that since the issues
vary so much from year to year, one is
led to a certain expectation that, with
out knowing what the issue will be,
there will be one."
'Groups change'
Asked about the continuity of the
groups in the coalition, he said that
"the groups change and develop over
time." He refused to name the various
groups, however.
Lyman said that no decision had
been reached on the (human rights)
petition.
However, he said there has not been
any question as to whether anyone is
not in favor of human rights and non
discrimination.
The issue, he said, revolves around
whether there is an "urgent need of a
single policy, either in place of. or as a
supplement to, the policies we now
have and whether one achieves the
ends people have in mind in signing
these petitions by creating a fresh
mechanism of some kind in protecting
those rights."
Lyman noted that over the past sev
eral years a "great deal" of machinery
had been created to handle grievances
against the University.
"I don't see a case being made, al
though maybe one is forthcoming,
against our present practices sufficient
to justify putting in place a fresh set of
machinery."
Differentiate
Lyman stressed the need to differen
tiate between thu issue of tolerance,
mutual respect and hospitableatmos
phere, and the issue of whether deci
sions are made in the structure of the
University which improperly consider
sexual orientation.
He quoted a memo from Acting Pro
vost William Massy to Richard
Thomas, community relations coor
dinator for the Gay Peoples Union. In
the memo, Massy said that the protec
tion being asked for in the human
rights policy is already here.
Lyman added that he had not heard
of "anybody making, or trying to
make, a case for the proposition that
decisions in various student areas are
now in fact being made on a dis
criminatory basis in relation to any of
the criteria set forth in the statement."
He commented. "General under
standing and tolerance is not always
best met by legislation."
President Richard Lyman said last night that it "seems to be an annual event
that we have an issue or a couple of issues that involve a rather familiar
coalition of forces."
Commenting on yesterday's human rights march during KZSU's Campus
Conference, Lyman said, "One is forced to wonder sometimes whether the
issue that is supposedly uppermost is always what's really uppermost in
people's minds.

"The issues may be very different,
but the coalition that lines up bears a
remarkable resemblance to the pre
ceeding year's coalition."
