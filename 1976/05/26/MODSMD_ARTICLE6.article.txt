## Opinions Non-decision on Foley 
### 
Paul Helliker

The May 3 non-decision by the Economics De
partment faculty on tenure for Prof. Duncan Foley
highlights the continuing controversy of quality
education here. In making this non-decision, the
economics faculty have chosen to ignore wide
spread support for Foley.
This support includes: a petition signed by 86
of 120 economics graduate students, demanding
immediate tenure for Foley, the unanimous re
commendation by the search committee for not
only tenure, but full professorship and the nine
letters from Foley's advisees, along with the 38
from other individual students, which were,
without exception, extremely positive.
The recent highly successful boycott of
Economics classes (only one had over 20 percent
attendance â€” an accounting course) in support of
Foley is another major addition to the obvious
student backing of a quick decision on tenure for
Foley.
Reasons not clarified
The reasons behind the department's non
decision have not been clarified, due to the cloak
of silence the faculty have imposed upon them
selves. It seems, though, that the primary "offi
cial" reason for delaying a final decision is uncer
tainty over Foley's "productivity" in research.
The fact is that, during the past year alone,
Foley has published four major articles in pre
stigious journals. In the past, his research has
been in the fields of monetary theory and mac
roeconomic theory. His book, published in 1971,
sets up a model to analyze macroeconomic theory
which is now commonly borrowed in various
forms by other authors. In fact, the book itself is
used as a textbook at both MIT and Chicago Uni
versity, a major accomplishment in itself.
His most recent work, a working paper titled
"Toward a Marxian Approach to Monetary
Theory," from many indications seems to be the
real issue around which the controversy centers.
The paper itself was very poorly received by the
Economics Department when Foley first pre
sented it, primarily because the paper critically
analyzed not only the foundations of Marxist
monetary theofv, but also the more traditional

approaches of neoclassical and Keynesian
theories of money.
Questionable judgment
However, this initial judgment of Foley's paper
is questionable, in light of the fact that few of the
economics faculty have attempted to become even
slightly knowledgable of Marx and his theories.
Two years ago. when students asked the faculty
to come to an open meeting in Tresidder Union to
explain, from a scientific point of view, their op
position to studying and teaching Marxist theory,
not a si ngle faculty member showed up. The only
plausible reason for this total lack of concern for a
growing area of student interest is that none of the
faculty were able to formulate clearly their oppos
ition to an alternative approach to the field of
economics.
Thus the non-decision appears to be based on a
fear that Foley will continue to indulge in further
scholarship in the area of Marxist analysis. Te
nure decisions which are biased because of politi
cal ideology are clearly in violation of an Ameri
can Association of University Professors (AAUP)
statute which forbids discrimination on the
grounds of political views. This also violates the
University's code against politically biased te
nure decisions.
Serious consideration
The responsibility now rests squarely on the
Economics Department faculty to give Foley's
case the serious consideration he was promised
when he first arrived here. In light of the massive
support from all quarters for Foley, his superior
teaching and his proven brilliance in research, it
is hard to understand how anything but a "yes"
decision on his tenure question could even be
considered.
The faculty also have the responsibility to exp
lain their actions and the criteria used in deciding
on Foley's case. If the faculty fail to reach a defini
tive decision by September, Foley will be leaving.
Not only will the department lose an excellent
teacher and researchist, but the economics facul
ty's commitment to continuing quality education
here will be seriously questioned.
