# Rearrange social goals

The most pressing problem in the world today
is the apathetic nature mankind has adopted to
wards such urgent matters as overpopulation,
widespread hunger and poverty, pollution and
other environmental concerns. Everyone admits
that these are major concerns, and statistical fore
casts indicate they will eventually spell our
doom.
This is not to say they cannot be overcome.
Surely the degree of development capable of put
ting a man on the moon and creating the great
variety of sophisticated weapons which charac
terize our armed forces is able to provide adequate
answers to these problems.
The reason for this apathetic nature can be seen
in light of the principles and objectives of the
society in which we live. Individuals have be
come increasingly self-centered in an "every man
for himself" type of atmosphere, which sees little
direct benefit coming out of solutions to these
problems.
Individual action
Admittedly, there's little that can be done on an
individual level when faced with issues of so
great a magnitude. However those with the finan
cial, technological, and political resources
needed to attack world problems — namely gov
ernment as well as the large corporations which
control an ever-increasing share of our Gross Na
tional Product — have failed to take any action.
Big corporations are guided by the profit mo-

tive, so they have little concern for the effect their
investments on the environment, and little incen
tive to direct their vast resources towards improv
ing the depressing conditions under which more
and more people are forced to live.
They have nothing to gain from helping others,
and the system dictates that investments are not
made unless they yield a profit.
Small contributions
The government, which freely allocates billions
of dollars annually towards the military budget,
has made relatively small contributions towards
aiding underdeveloped countries or restricting
environmental abuses. Policies appear by allow
ing the environment to deteriorate and attaching
strings to foreign aid.
For example, much of the "aid" requires a sig
nificant part of it be spent on U.S. products (a type
of subsidy for U.S. business), and the method of
repaying the loan may do more to hurt the under
developed country in the long run. The fact that
many aid programs are in exchange for allowing
U.S. military bases in the country further indi
cates the selfish motives behind them.
The issue becomes one of reordering our social
objectives away from the selfish motives of ad
vancing one's own position — whether it be on an
individual, corporate, or national level — and
more towards advancing the needs and well
being of society as a whole.
