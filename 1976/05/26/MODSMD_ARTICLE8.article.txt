# 'Daily' reply policy clarified

Serious misuse
The purpose of this letter is to draw the
attention of the University community to
what has been a serious misuse of jour
nalistic license by the editor of the Daily,
Mark Simonian. The implications of this
misuse are of such gravity that we feel
compelled to respond in protest. Allow
us to briefly state the facts.
On April 14, 1976 an article appeared
in the Daily entitled "Student drama re
turns to Mem Aud stage" in which the
author made reference to the revival of
Rams Head and the problems it encoun
tered with various University de
partmental and administrative units in
the preparation ofGuys and Dolls. Ques
tioning the accuracy and purpose of the
article, our signed response was on that
same day personally delivered to thf?
Daily editorial staff, who assured us of its
prompt publication. A month has passed
and the letter has yet to be published.
Our inquiry to Simonian after the first
two weeks of waiting was met with
apologies for his busy schedule, his ina
bility to reach the author regarding the
response, and with the subsequent as
surance that the letter would be printed.
After a full month's wait Simonian was
finally confronted and asked why. all ex
cuses aside, the response was not
printed. At this point a startling discov
ery was made: In Simonian's opinion our
response lacked "substantive" value,
and thus on the basis of a certain Daily
policy (which he characterized as a
year-old, unwritten understanding,
transmitted orally from editor to editor)
he claimed the editorial license to with
old our letter from publication. This pol
icy is tantamount to censorship.

This much is clear:
The Daily has a responsibility to print
intact responses to Daily articles, regard
less of the editor's opinion on the issues.
The very suggestion of a compromise,
wherein he would print our response if it
were rewritten to his satisfaction, a com
promise which we refused, suggests the
arbitrary and autocratic potential of this
policy in the hands of the Daily editor.
It is imperative that the Daily state un
ambiguously in print its editorial and
censorship policies for community
perusal. Second, an immediate written
explanation must be accorded to indi
viduals whose responses to certain Daily
articles have been similarly excluded.
The printing of an investigative article
carries with it the obligation to provide
adequate space for an opposing view.

Constitutional right
In my discussion of this matter with
George McMillan, we agreed that the
Daily policy on letters to the editor
should be clarified. This response is an
attempt to do so.
Simply stated, the Daily policy on mail
critical of news, features, sports and en
tertainment articles (not opinions col
umns or editorials) is that the editor must
personally review the complaint. The
editor is required to take four steps in this
review:
—read each complaint personally;
—confer with the department editor
and reporter concerned to isolate the
background of the story involved;
—determine the validity of the com
plaint; and

—decide on the appropriate method or
response.
In descending order of priority ap
propriate responses are personal letter or
conference, correction (in "Briefly"),
clarification (in "Briefly") or opinions
page space.
The Rams Head piece required a per
sonal letter. I confess that at the time it
came in I was overwhelmed with both
personal and Daily work and I did an
especially poor job in dealing with Rams
Head. For this, I have already personally
apologized to George McMillan.
But in general, the Daily policy of per
sonal review by the editor of critical mail
has worked remarkably wel 1 in its year of
service. The editor must take full respon
sibility for community feedback under
this policy.
The editor must follow up complaints
and correct errors that reporters or
editors are making, rather than just print
ing letters of response on the opinions
page and letting the matters drop.
In examining the Rams Head com
plaint, I found that at no time has any
source quoted in the Daily story said they
had been misquoted.
The Rams Head approach of attacking
an individual Daily reporter and his
honest job of reporting merely to assuage
the injured egos of the Drama Depart
ment or University officials is particu
larly reprehensible.
I feel sorry that Rams Head came under
fire by certain individuals in the Univer
sity for revealing the extent of the dif
ficulties in producing Guys and Dolls.
However, neither the Daily nor its repor
ter can be faulted for relating accurate
statements made by Rams Head staff.

University unhappiness with a posi
tion, as we at the Daily have learned, is
not the most pleasant of circumstances.
But University unhappiness is some
times a necessity if students are to take
stands and work for what they believe in.
McMillan and Carpenter have chosen
to back down and have attempted to use
the Daily as a Rams Head scapegoat.
The Rams Head production of Guys
and Dolls received over one-half page of
quite favorable advance publicity from
the Daily with two photographs — far in
excess of what most campus productions
receive. The play was also favorably re
viewed at some length.
The very idea that the Daily should
publish only favorable material on a
campus group, event or production is it
self an expression of censorship. At
tempting to force a newspaper to publish
something is as much censorship as at
tempting to force a newspaper not to.
The Daily receives quite a bit of mail,
favorable and unfavorable. There is not
enough space on our opinions pages to
run all letters we receive.
Why should the Daily be forced to run
specific letters (such as Rams Head's)
and thus reject others worthy of publica
tion? What criteria should be used to
forcea newspaper to publish something?
Clearly, the First Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution guarantees that a
newspaper alone has the right to decide
what it publishes. The fathers of the Con
stitution did not intend for newspapers
to be forced to print anything. The Daily
reporter's article was honest,
straightforward and accurate. As editor. I
stand behind that article.
