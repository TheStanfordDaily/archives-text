## Poli Sci 138C: United States and Soviet Union Stanford's SALT substitute 
### Kathy Batts 
a~- veryday after lunch a group of students gathers in the
L_ upper recesses of the old law school or in a seminar
room of the business school for their 1:45 political
science class. Should a passerby eavesdrop, it might
sound like a wargames convention:
"There's absolutely no strategic reason for the Soviet
Union to have the SS-9 or any heavy missile. We can't agree
to that."
"But heavy ICBMs are the heart and soul of the Soviet
military force. TheU.S. is unwilling to compromise so we can
come to an agreement here."
"We have compromised! We've already given up MIRVs
and MaRVs."
"And we've conceded on peaceful nuclear explosions and
the mobile issue. The SS-9 has nothing to do with this;
unless, of course, you want to discuss your forward-based
systems..
These 24 undergraduates aren't playing any games.
They're dead serious about trading around their countries'
military systems like chessmen.
They're attempting to solve in one quarter what Henry

Kissinger and Leonid Brezhnev have been talking about
since 1969 — stopping the arms race before it's too late. And
the odds are that by next week, they'll be more successful
than their real world counterparts.
Welcome to SALT 111.
The Stanford version of the third set of the Strategic Arms
Limitation Talks (SALT) may well be the draft of the shape of
things to come in U.S./Soviet relations.
In any event, simulation as an educational tool is shaping
up to be a way of the future of Stanford and other universities
all over the country.
Coordinated by Adjunct Political Science Prof. Lawrence
Weiler, Political Science 138 C is a continuation of 138 A,
"Arms Control and Disarmament." The course is a simula
tion of future SALT negotiations.
"It's got to be the most unique class I have ever had at
Stanford," says "American" class member John Roos. That
easily sums up the unanimous feelings of every student in
138 C.Two years ago, when it was first offered, the course
received the only perfect rating in the history of the ASSU
Course Guide.



"I've never worked so hard and
learned so much as I have in the
simulation," adds "American" Liz
Harrison. "It's just a great class."
Weiler agrees that the simula
tion is "an incredible learning ex
perience." A former member of
the SALT I negotiating team, he
says he finds it hard to compare
the simulation to the actual
negotiations, in terms of reality.
"What's going on in this exer
cise isn't realistic in the current
framework with our current Presi
dent," he says, "but in terms of the
strategic, economic and interna
tional political considerations that
have entered into debate, it's quite
realistic."
The class is divided into two
delegations, American and
Soviet. Bilateral working groups
have been set up to iron out
agreements on treaty issues such
as missile test firing, aggregate
ceilings, anti-submarine warfare,
restricted submarine zones, a
comprehensive test ban, a no
first-use policy, zero anti-ballistic
missiles (ABMs) and maneuvera
ble re-entry vehicles (MaRV).
Continual meetings
Delegation meetings are
scheduled at least two times a
week and formal negotiations
("plenaries ") are conducted two to
three times a week. Meetings ex

tend, however, to all hours of the
day and night.
Delegates have been known to
spend as many as six hours a
day, sometimes every day, on this
one five-unit class. The longest
delegation meeting this quarter
has been a Soviet session which
went to 4:30 a.m., after which
some stayed up until 9 a.m. to type
up a proposal. The longest U.S.
meeting has gone to 1:45 a.m.
"The work the students do is
entirely self-generated," Weiler
says. "Their assigned workload is
actually quite light."
The students are required to
write one five-page position paper
and a two-page "telegram" for
their respective governments.
Two books on arms control are
required reading.
Oral exam
The extra work is generated by
the quarter-long assignment to
both delegations: reach an arms
control agreement, if possible. If
it's not possible, the alternative is
a three-hour oral examination.
"That exam might be a little
hard to conduct," Weiler laughs.
"Most of them now know more
than I do."
The aim of the class, Weiler
adds, is "not to reach an agree
ment for an agreement's sake."
But the time pressure of avoid
ing a final exam might put the

delegates in a state similar to that
of the actual SALT I delegation
experienced. They were trying to
ready a treaty for signing during
former President Nixon's visit to
Moscow in 1972.
"This is a very intense negotia
tion," Weiler says. "But so far only
one friendship has suffered, that I
know of."
The possibility of the students
getting too involved in their role
playing is a consequence of the
simulation. Pam Woods, a
member of the Soviet delegation,
says she finds herself saying
"we," meaning the Soviets, when
talking to her friends about inter
national affairs.
"I get some weird looks that
way," she says."I guess it's a little
confusing for some people."
Once a Soviet. . .
A student of the simulation two
years ago recalls reading about
SALT II one day in the New York
Times, while the real delegations
were squabbling over MIRVs. He
remembers thinking: "Why are
they worrying about MIRVs?
We ve already solved that." And
then he realized that the simula
tion had been far ahead of the ac
tual negotiations.
Two years ago the delegates
took to wearing coats and ties to
class, a situation Weiler claims
made it "easy to tell the students
from the faculty." This year the
Americans appear at each ple
nary in real T-shirts emblazoned
with a map of the U.S. Under the
map are the words "U.S. SALT
TEAM" and on the back is each
delegate's last name.

a~- veryday after lunch a group of students gathers in the

science class. Should a passerby eavesdrop, it might
sound like a wargames convention:
"There's absolutely no strategic reason for the Soviet
Union to have the SS-9 or any heavy missile. We can't agree
to that."
"But heavy ICBMs are the heart and soul of the Soviet
military force. TheU.S. is unwilling to compromise so we can
come to an agreement here."
"We have compromised! We've already given up MIRVs
and MaRVs."
"And we've conceded on peaceful nuclear explosions and
the mobile issue. The SS-9 has nothing to do with this;
unless, of course, you want to discuss your forward-based
systems..
These 24 undergraduates aren't playing any games.
They're dead serious about trading around their countries'
military systems like chessmen.
They're attempting to solve in one quarter what Henry

Welcome to SALT 111.
The Stanford version of the third set of the Strategic Arms
Limitation Talks (SALT) may well be the draft of the shape of
things to come in U.S./Soviet relations.
In any event, simulation as an educational tool is shaping
up to be a way of the future of Stanford and other universities
all over the country.
Coordinated by Adjunct Political Science Prof. Lawrence
Weiler, Political Science 138 C is a continuation of 138 A,
"Arms Control and Disarmament." The course is a simula
tion of future SALT negotiations.
"It's got to be the most unique class I have ever had at
Stanford," says "American" class member John Roos. That
easily sums up the unanimous feelings of every student in
138 C.Two years ago, when it was first offered, the course
received the only perfect rating in the history of the ASSU
Course Guide.



"I've never worked so hard and
learned so much as I have in the
simulation," adds "American" Liz
Harrison. "It's just a great class."
Weiler agrees that the simula
tion is "an incredible learning ex
perience." A former member of
the SALT I negotiating team, he
says he finds it hard to compare
the simulation to the actual
negotiations, in terms of reality.
"What's going on in this exer
cise isn't realistic in the current
framework with our current Presi
dent," he says, "but in terms of the
strategic, economic and interna
tional political considerations that
have entered into debate, it's quite
realistic."
The class is divided into two
delegations, American and
Soviet. Bilateral working groups
have been set up to iron out
agreements on treaty issues such
as missile test firing, aggregate
ceilings, anti-submarine warfare,
restricted submarine zones, a
comprehensive test ban, a no
first-use policy, zero anti-ballistic
missiles (ABMs) and maneuvera
ble re-entry vehicles (MaRV).
Continual meetings
Delegation meetings are
scheduled at least two times a
week and formal negotiations
("plenaries ") are conducted two to
three times a week. Meetings ex

tend, however, to all hours of the
day and night.
Delegates have been known to
spend as many as six hours a
day, sometimes every day, on this
one five-unit class. The longest
delegation meeting this quarter
has been a Soviet session which
went to 4:30 a.m., after which
some stayed up until 9 a.m. to type
up a proposal. The longest U.S.
meeting has gone to 1:45 a.m.
"The work the students do is
entirely self-generated," Weiler
says. "Their assigned workload is
actually quite light."
The students are required to
write one five-page position paper
and a two-page "telegram" for
their respective governments.
Two books on arms control are
required reading.
Oral exam
The extra work is generated by
the quarter-long assignment to
both delegations: reach an arms
control agreement, if possible. If
it's not possible, the alternative is
a three-hour oral examination.
"That exam might be a little
hard to conduct," Weiler laughs.
"Most of them now know more
than I do."
The aim of the class, Weiler
adds, is "not to reach an agree
ment for an agreement's sake."
But the time pressure of avoid
ing a final exam might put the

delegates in a state similar to that
of the actual SALT I delegation
experienced. They were trying to
ready a treaty for signing during
former President Nixon's visit to
Moscow in 1972.
"This is a very intense negotia
tion," Weiler says. "But so far only
one friendship has suffered, that I
know of."
The possibility of the students
getting too involved in their role
playing is a consequence of the
simulation. Pam Woods, a
member of the Soviet delegation,
says she finds herself saying
"we," meaning the Soviets, when
talking to her friends about inter
national affairs.
"I get some weird looks that
way," she says."I guess it's a little
confusing for some people."

write one five-page position paper
and a two-page "telegram" for
their respective governments.
Two books on arms control are
required reading.
Oral exam
The extra work is generated by
the quarter-long assignment to
both delegations: reach an arms
control agreement, if possible. If
it's not possible, the alternative is
a three-hour oral examination.
"That exam might be a little
hard to conduct," Weiler laughs.
"Most of them now know more
than I do."
The aim of the class, Weiler
adds, is "not to reach an agree
ment for an agreement's sake."
But the time pressure of avoid
ing a final exam might put the

delegates in a state similar to that
of the actual SALT I delegation
experienced. They were trying to
ready a treaty for signing during
former President Nixon's visit to
Moscow in 1972.
"This is a very intense negotia
tion," Weiler says. "But so far only
one friendship has suffered, that I
know of."
The possibility of the students
getting too involved in their role
playing is a consequence of the
simulation. Pam Woods, a
member of the Soviet delegation,
says she finds herself saying
"we," meaning the Soviets, when
talking to her friends about inter
national affairs.
"I get some weird looks that
way," she says."I guess it's a little
confusing for some people."

A student of the simulation two
years ago recalls reading about
SALT II one day in the New York

were squabbling over MIRVs. He
remembers thinking: "Why are
they worrying about MIRVs?
We ve already solved that." And
then he realized that the simula

Two years ago the delegates

a~- veryday after lunch a group of students gathers in the
L_ upper recesses of the old law school or in a seminar
room of the business school for their 1:45 political
science class. Should a passerby eavesdrop, it might
sound like a wargames convention:
"There's absolutely no strategic reason for the Soviet
Union to have the SS-9 or any heavy missile. We can't agree
to that."
"But heavy ICBMs are the heart and soul of the Soviet
military force. TheU.S. is unwilling to compromise so we can
come to an agreement here."
"We have compromised! We've already given up MIRVs
and MaRVs."
"And we've conceded on peaceful nuclear explosions and
the mobile issue. The SS-9 has nothing to do with this;
unless, of course, you want to discuss your forward-based
systems..
These 24 undergraduates aren't playing any games.
They're dead serious about trading around their countries'
military systems like chessmen.
They're attempting to solve in one quarter what Henry

Kissinger and Leonid Brezhnev have been talking about
since 1969 — stopping the arms race before it's too late. And
the odds are that by next week, they'll be more successful
than their real world counterparts.
Welcome to SALT 111.
The Stanford version of the third set of the Strategic Arms
Limitation Talks (SALT) may well be the draft of the shape of
things to come in U.S./Soviet relations.
In any event, simulation as an educational tool is shaping
up to be a way of the future of Stanford and other universities
all over the country.
Coordinated by Adjunct Political Science Prof. Lawrence
Weiler, Political Science 138 C is a continuation of 138 A,
"Arms Control and Disarmament." The course is a simula
tion of future SALT negotiations.
"It's got to be the most unique class I have ever had at
Stanford," says "American" class member John Roos. That
easily sums up the unanimous feelings of every student in
138 C.Two years ago, when it was first offered, the course
received the only perfect rating in the history of the ASSU
Course Guide.



"I've never worked so hard and
learned so much as I have in the
simulation," adds "American" Liz
Harrison. "It's just a great class."
Weiler agrees that the simula
tion is "an incredible learning ex
perience." A former member of
the SALT I negotiating team, he
says he finds it hard to compare
the simulation to the actual
negotiations, in terms of reality.
"What's going on in this exer
cise isn't realistic in the current
framework with our current Presi
dent," he says, "but in terms of the
strategic, economic and interna
tional political considerations that
have entered into debate, it's quite
realistic."
The class is divided into two
delegations, American and
Soviet. Bilateral working groups
have been set up to iron out
agreements on treaty issues such
as missile test firing, aggregate
ceilings, anti-submarine warfare,
restricted submarine zones, a
comprehensive test ban, a no
first-use policy, zero anti-ballistic
missiles (ABMs) and maneuvera
ble re-entry vehicles (MaRV).
Continual meetings
Delegation meetings are
scheduled at least two times a
week and formal negotiations
("plenaries ") are conducted two to
three times a week. Meetings ex

tend, however, to all hours of the
day and night.
Delegates have been known to
spend as many as six hours a
day, sometimes every day, on this
one five-unit class. The longest
delegation meeting this quarter
has been a Soviet session which
went to 4:30 a.m., after which
some stayed up until 9 a.m. to type
up a proposal. The longest U.S.
meeting has gone to 1:45 a.m.
"The work the students do is
entirely self-generated," Weiler
says. "Their assigned workload is
actually quite light."
The students are required to
write one five-page position paper
and a two-page "telegram" for
their respective governments.
