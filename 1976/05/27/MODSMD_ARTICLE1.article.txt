## Poli Sci 138C: United States and Soviet Union Stanford's SALT substitute 
### Kathy Batts 
a~- veryday after lunch a group of students gathers in the
L_ upper recesses of the old law school or in a seminar
room of the business school for their 1:45 political
science class. Should a passerby eavesdrop, it might
sound like a wargames convention:
"There's absolutely no strategic reason for the Soviet
Union to have the SS-9 or any heavy missile. We can't agree
to that."
"But heavy ICBMs are the heart and soul of the Soviet
military force. TheU.S. is unwilling to compromise so we can
come to an agreement here."
"We have compromised! We've already given up MIRVs
and MaRVs."
"And we've conceded on peaceful nuclear explosions and
the mobile issue. The SS-9 has nothing to do with this;
unless, of course, you want to discuss your forward-based
systems..
These 24 undergraduates aren't playing any games.
They're dead serious about trading around their countries'
military systems like chessmen.
They're attempting to solve in one quarter what Henry

Kissinger and Leonid Brezhnev have been talking about
since 1969 â€” stopping the arms race before it's too late. And
the odds are that by next week, they'll be more successful
than their real world counterparts.
Welcome to SALT 111.
The Stanford version of the third set of the Strategic Arms
Limitation Talks (SALT) may well be the draft of the shape of
things to come in U.S./Soviet relations.
In any event, simulation as an educational tool is shaping
up to be a way of the future of Stanford and other universities
all over the country.
Coordinated by Adjunct Political Science Prof. Lawrence
Weiler, Political Science 138 C is a continuation of 138 A,
"Arms Control and Disarmament." The course is a simula
tion of future SALT negotiations.
"It's got to be the most unique class I have ever had at
Stanford," says "American" class member John Roos. That
easily sums up the unanimous feelings of every student in
138 C.Two years ago, when it was first offered, the course
received the only perfect rating in the history of the ASSU
Course Guide.
