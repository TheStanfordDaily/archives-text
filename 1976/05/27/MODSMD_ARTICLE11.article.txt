# Junipero fellows to leave position
## 
### Jacob Young 
After several months of tension
in the Asian American theme
house, the current Junipero house
fellows, Sandy and Dennis Chinn,
have decided not to return to their
positions next year.
Chinn, an assistant professor in
the Food Research Institute, said
that problems with his research
and his wife's pregnancy were
major considerations in the deci
sion, but added that "it will proba
bly be better for the (Asian Ameri
can theme) program if someone
else took the (house fellow) posi

tion."
Junipero residents informed the
Daily that the Chinns had re
signed in reaction to a letter sent
to them by some members of the
house which was allegedly abu
sive in tone.
A rebuttal to the letter which
was posted in the Junipero lounge
stated that the Chinns had re
signed "with good reason, in light
of the way they have been mis
treated." The rebuttal was signed
by Dan Poston, a house
associate at the house.
'Highly vocal group'
According to the rebuttal, many
of the problems in the house were
caused by a "highly vocal group '
which felt that the Asian theme of
the house had not been stressed
enough
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton said that calling the
Chinns decision not to return a
"resignation" is "wild misinterpre
tation."
"It was not a resignation," Hor
ton said. "This has never been the
case. It was a decision not to re
turn."
Horton did say that the Chinns
had already signed a contract with
the University to be the Junipero
house fellows next year.
"I'm not going to say that the
conditions at Junipero are not un
usual," Horton said, adding that
the Chinn s decision not to return
next year "came at an unusual
time" but "isn't uncommon "
Horton said that the allegedly
abusive letter received by the
Chinns expressed "frustration
and was a bit overstated."
Chinn said that the letter was
"definitely not the straw which
broke the camel's back," but ad
ded, "our expectations were a bit
different from what the students
expectations were ."
