# 558 Mayfield top choice

### Jack Vaughn 
The new row house at 558
Mayfield Road was the most popu
lar residence in the Spring Hous
ing Draw, according to Phil Curry,
a staff assistant to the registrar.
Almost six times as many men
and four times as many women as
there were spaces available listed
the house as their first choice in
round two. This figure includes
students assigned to 558 Mayfield
in round one who accepted their
assignment.
In round one, more than 24
times as many men and 17 times
as many women as spaces avail
able listed the house first.
Curry said there are three main
methods for determining a
house s popularity: the ratio of the
number of students who listed the
house as their first choice to the
number of spaces available; the
ratio of the number of students list
ing the house as one of their eight
choices to the number of spaces
available; whether a house had
spaces available after round one
because students assigned to the
house asked to be reassigned.

The most popular houses for
women according to the first
method were, in order, 558
Mayfield, the new Italian theme
house (Robert Moore North), the
American Studies theme house
(Robert Moore South), Theta Chi
and Phi Sig. The least popular
were Burbank, Serra and Twain
houses in Stern Hall, Columbae
House and Manzanita Park.
For men, the most popular
houses were 558 Mayfield, the
American Studies theme house,
Lambda Nu, Alpha Tau Omicron
(ATO) and Theta Chi. The least
popular were Twain and Burbank
houses in Stern. Manzanita Park
and Zapata.
Curry cautioned, however, that
judgements of popularity based
on first choices may not be accu
rate because a particular house
may be many students' second or
third choice but few students' first.
Using the second method, the
most popular houses for women
were 558 Mayfield, Lathrop, Theta
Chi and Granada, while Ujamaa,
Columbae, Burbank and Zapata
were least popular.

For men, 558 Mayfield,
Granada, Eucalypto, Lambda Nu
and the American Studies theme
house were the most popular,
while Ujamaa. Zapata, Junipero
and Burbank were least popular.
Although the theme houses
ranked among the least popular
overall, Curry said the fact that
there was little difference between
the ratio in the first and second
methods indicated that most of
next year's residents put the
theme houses as their first or sec
ond choices.
The American Studies theme
house, Durand, and French
theme house, the Italian theme
house, Junipero, Lathrop and Phi
Psi were most popular for women
using the third method of popular
ity determination.
