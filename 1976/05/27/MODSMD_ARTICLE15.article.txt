# Massage: Sensuality or sexuality?
## 
### 
The heat is stifling. The air is
humid to the point of discomfort.
An atmosphere of cigarette
smoke masked by pungent per
fume assails the lungs.
A television sits in one corner of
the small reception room, silently
displaying a movie in shades of
blue and green. The only sounds
are the shrill notes of a "soul
music" radio station coming out of
a tinny speaker.
It's a slow Saturday night in a
Palo Alto massage studio.
The tinkle of the front door bell
announces the arrival of Misty, the
night manager. She bounces
through the reception room and
into the adjoining office.
Misty (not her real name) is an
atypical masseuse: she loves to
talk about massage. She know
ledgeably discusses the differ
ences between Oriental and
Swedish massage, the healing
powers of herbal medicines, and
the use of acu-pressure as a heal
ing art.
For example," she says as she
reaches over to grab the nearest
convenient arm, "these are acu
pressure points." Two strong fin
gers dig into flesh just above the
wrist. "Or —," and her other hand
grips the elbow like a vice.
Incapacitating
"See, and you can use the
same pressure points for de
fense," Misty says as she presses
harder still. "Incapacitating, isn't
it?" she asks.
The lesson is interrupted by the
arrival of the evening's first cus
tomer. Misty runs out to practice
her art, leaving a stack of her favo
rite paperbacks for perusal.
They have titles like Luytie's
Homeopathic Practice,
Biochemistry Up-to-date and
Healing Yourself with Foot Re
flexology.
Misty, who was born in Chicago
26 years ago, has "been around in
massage" most of her life. Her
father, a professional boxer, intro
duced her to massage when she
was a child and she often prac
ticed on his shoulders.
At Ohio State University, she
majored in agriculture biochemis
try, which led to an interest in the
healing herbs that she occasion
ally uses in massage.
She did not apply her massage
skills immediately after gradua
tion. Four years of political ac
tivism were spent with Students

for a Democratic Society (SDS)
and the Young Patriots, where
she rose to third in command.
Misty also "ran with the Weather
men ... until they went under
ground and I chose to stay above
ground."
Meat
She abruptly quit politics in
1972 "because of all the reper
cussions," and moved to the Bay
Area. After rising to the manager's
job at a steak house, she gave up
that profession too.
"Steaks are poison," Misty
says. Two years ago she tried
massage, a field in which she
could continue to earn a comfort
able wage. This is the fifth studio
she has worked at.
Misty returns, finished with 30
minutes of flesh kneading. Her
brunette hair is damp with perspi
ration, but the workout hasn't tired
her trim, muscular body. Still clad
in her work clothes — a pair of
blue jeans and a tight white satin
shirt — she leans back in the
squeaky chair and props her feet
up on the edge of an old couch.
"So you want to know what it's
like to be a masseuse," she says,
unprompted.
Not boring
"Well, it's definitely not boring.
None of us could stand to sit be
hind a desk. I meet people, and I
feel that I have a lot to offer them.
"Whether it involves sensuality
or sexuality, that encounter with
that customer is going to be the
best. A masseuse is best, be
cause she's a professional. She
knows what sensually and sexu
ally stimulates her customers.

Each man is stimulated diffe
rently.
"What goes on in the rooms in
any studio, straight or otherwise,
is up to the discretion of the indi
vidual masseuse. A straight studio
is one that promotes no sex.' We
will not, at any point or time, solicit
a customer at all," she says.
"There are a lot of solid reasons
for that. First of all, soliciting is
against the law. But at least 90

percent of the guys who walk in
the door will solicit me."
Undercovers policemen
Masseuses must always worry
about undercover policemen pos
ing as customers and taping the
conversation with hidden recor
ders. A police officer can not ask a
masseuse to provide any sexual
services. So Misty uses a
technique that requires no verbal
commitment:
"Well, that's the end of your

massage. Did you want any other
kind of massage?"
"Yeah, I had something else in
mind."
"What?"
"Well, how about a local?" (A
local is manual stimulation of the
customer by the masseuse.)
"That's not included in the cost
of the massage "
"How much extra will that
cost?"
"I don't know."
The customer then quotes a
price, and Misty bargains with
head and hand gestures until an
amount is settled upon.
How much does she agree
upon for extras? Misty's voice
drops in volume.
"For a local, it might be. like,
$15. And, uh, for uh, a French, it'd
be," (a short pause), $35. Her
voices becomes softer still. "Inter
course, $50."
Those prices are in addition to
$30 spent on the original hour
long massage.
"It's very hard to be into mas
sage and not be into extras. We d
lose half our customers," she
says.
"You get every kind of man you
can imagine. Truck drivers,
salesmen, just generally horny
guys, athletes with sore muscles,
curiosity seekers." She also regu
larly massages several Stanford
students and "half a dozen pro
fessors."
Unusual interests
Some of the customers with
more unusual interests make ap
pointments for "outcalls." The
masseuse spends 30 minutes to

an hour at the customer's home
"I had this old man one time
who wanted to paddle me. Paid
me 200 bucks to paddle me.
Bare-assed naked with a ping
pong paddle."
She shows off her bank deposit
records. Combining salary, com
missions from massages, and the
money she earns from "extras,"
Misty takes home as much as
$200 some weeks.
The job can be dangerous. Two
weeks ago, she was attacked
while answering a phony outcall
request. She was almost raped
and kidnaped at gunpoint, but
managed to escape. Her face
turns serious when she describes
the incident.
Lucky
"I was lucky. In a few minutes I
would have been on a long road
headed nowhere. I was scared
like I've never been in my life.''
But on the whole, Misty enjoys
her job.
"At first. I had a lot of conflicts,
because of my sexual upbringing
I talked to close friends of mine
who were ministers, and the best
response I got was: It really
doesn't matter what you do." She
pauses for emphasis. "It's how
you do it."
"I take a lot of pride in my mas
sage and what I can do for some
one therapeutically. I feel good
about massage because I know
that my customers don t walk out
of here unhappy. They walk out of
here very happy and contented.
"They get a good massage,
good company, and I try to treat
them the best I can."

gers dig into flesh just above the
wrist. "Or —," and her other hand
grips the elbow like a vice.
Incapacitating
"See, and you can use the
same pressure points for de
fense," Misty says as she presses
harder still. "Incapacitating, isn't
it?" she asks.
The lesson is interrupted by the
arrival of the evening's first cus
tomer. Misty runs out to practice
her art, leaving a stack of her favo
rite paperbacks for perusal.
They have titles like Luytie's
Homeopathic Practice,
Biochemistry Up-to-date and
Healing Yourself with Foot Re
flexology.
Misty, who was born in Chicago
26 years ago, has "been around in
massage" most of her life. Her
father, a professional boxer, intro
duced her to massage when she
was a child and she often prac
ticed on his shoulders.
At Ohio State University, she
majored in agriculture biochemis
try, which led to an interest in the
healing herbs that she occasion
ally uses in massage.
She did not apply her massage
skills immediately after gradua
tion. Four years of political ac
tivism were spent with Students

for a Democratic Society (SDS)
and the Young Patriots, where
she rose to third in command.
Misty also "ran with the Weather
men ... until they went under
ground and I chose to stay above
ground."
Meat
She abruptly quit politics in
1972 "because of all the reper
cussions," and moved to the Bay
Area. After rising to the manager's
job at a steak house, she gave up
that profession too.
"Steaks are poison," Misty
says. Two years ago she tried
massage, a field in which she
could continue to earn a comfort
able wage. This is the fifth studio
she has worked at.
Misty returns, finished with 30
minutes of flesh kneading. Her
brunette hair is damp with perspi
ration, but the workout hasn't tired
her trim, muscular body. Still clad
in her work clothes — a pair of
blue jeans and a tight white satin
shirt — she leans back in the
squeaky chair and props her feet
up on the edge of an old couch.
"So you want to know what it's
like to be a masseuse," she says,
unprompted.
Not boring
"Well, it's definitely not boring.
None of us could stand to sit be
hind a desk. I meet people, and I
feel that I have a lot to offer them.
"Whether it involves sensuality
or sexuality, that encounter with
that customer is going to be the
best. A masseuse is best, be
cause she's a professional. She
knows what sensually and sexu
ally stimulates her customers.

Each man is stimulated diffe
rently.
"What goes on in the rooms in
any studio, straight or otherwise,
is up to the discretion of the indi
vidual masseuse. A straight studio
is one that promotes no sex.' We
will not, at any point or time, solicit
a customer at all," she says.
"There are a lot of solid reasons
for that. First of all, soliciting is
against the law. But at least 90

percent of the guys who walk in
the door will solicit me."
Undercovers policemen
Masseuses must always worry
about undercover policemen pos
ing as customers and taping the
conversation with hidden recor
ders. A police officer can not ask a
masseuse to provide any sexual
services. So Misty uses a
technique that requires no verbal
commitment:
"Well, that's the end of your

massage. Did you want any other
kind of massage?"
"Yeah, I had something else in
mind."
"What?"
"Well, how about a local?" (A
local is manual stimulation of the
customer by the masseuse.)
"That's not included in the cost
of the massage "
"How much extra will that
cost?"
"I don't know."
The customer then quotes a
price, and Misty bargains with
head and hand gestures until an
amount is settled upon.
How much does she agree
upon for extras? Misty's voice
drops in volume.
"For a local, it might be. like,
$15. And, uh, for uh, a French, it'd
be," (a short pause), $35. Her
voices becomes softer still. "Inter
course, $50."
Those prices are in addition to
$30 spent on the original hour
long massage.
"It's very hard to be into mas
sage and not be into extras. We d
lose half our customers," she
says.
"You get every kind of man you
can imagine. Truck drivers,
salesmen, just generally horny
guys, athletes with sore muscles,
curiosity seekers." She also regu
larly massages several Stanford
students and "half a dozen pro
fessors."
Unusual interests
Some of the customers with
more unusual interests make ap
pointments for "outcalls." The
masseuse spends 30 minutes to

an hour at the customer's home
"I had this old man one time
who wanted to paddle me. Paid
me 200 bucks to paddle me.
Bare-assed naked with a ping
pong paddle."
She shows off her bank deposit
records. Combining salary, com
missions from massages, and the
money she earns from "extras,"
Misty takes home as much as
$200 some weeks.
The job can be dangerous. Two
weeks ago, she was attacked
while answering a phony outcall
request. She was almost raped
and kidnaped at gunpoint, but
managed to escape. Her face
turns serious when she describes
the incident.
Lucky
"I was lucky. In a few minutes I
would have been on a long road
headed nowhere. I was scared
like I've never been in my life.''
But on the whole, Misty enjoys
her job.
"At first. I had a lot of conflicts,
because of my sexual upbringing
I talked to close friends of mine
who were ministers, and the best
response I got was: It really
doesn't matter what you do." She
pauses for emphasis. "It's how
you do it."
"I take a lot of pride in my mas
sage and what I can do for some
one therapeutically. I feel good
about massage because I know
that my customers don t walk out
of here unhappy. They walk out of
here very happy and contented.
"They get a good massage,
good company, and I try to treat
them the best I can."


'Misty'
The heat is stifling. The air is
humid to the point of discomfort.
An atmosphere of cigarette
smoke masked by pungent per
fume assails the lungs.
A television sits in one corner of
the small reception room, silently
displaying a movie in shades of
blue and green. The only sounds
are the shrill notes of a "soul
music" radio station coming out of
a tinny speaker.
It's a slow Saturday night in a
Palo Alto massage studio.
The tinkle of the front door bell
announces the arrival of Misty, the
night manager. She bounces
through the reception room and
into the adjoining office.
Misty (not her real name) is an
atypical masseuse: she loves to
talk about massage. She know
ledgeably discusses the differ
ences between Oriental and
Swedish massage, the healing
powers of herbal medicines, and
the use of acu-pressure as a heal
ing art.
For example," she says as she
reaches over to grab the nearest
convenient arm, "these are acu
pressure points." Two strong fin
gers dig into flesh just above the
wrist. "Or —," and her other hand

ally uses in massage.
She did not apply her massage
skills immediately after gradua
tion. Four years of political ac
tivism were spent with Students

for a Democratic Society (SDS)
and the Young Patriots, where
she rose to third in command.
Misty also "ran with the Weather
men ... until they went under
ground and I chose to stay above
ground."
Meat
She abruptly quit politics in
1972 "because of all the reper
cussions," and moved to the Bay
Area. After rising to the manager's
job at a steak house, she gave up
that profession too.
"Steaks are poison," Misty
says. Two years ago she tried
massage, a field in which she
could continue to earn a comfort
able wage. This is the fifth studio
she has worked at.
Misty returns, finished with 30
minutes of flesh kneading. Her
brunette hair is damp with perspi
ration, but the workout hasn't tired
her trim, muscular body. Still clad
in her work clothes — a pair of
blue jeans and a tight white satin
shirt — she leans back in the
squeaky chair and props her feet
up on the edge of an old couch.
"So you want to know what it's
like to be a masseuse," she says,
unprompted.
Not boring
"Well, it's definitely not boring.
None of us could stand to sit be
hind a desk. I meet people, and I
feel that I have a lot to offer them.
"Whether it involves sensuality
or sexuality, that encounter with
that customer is going to be the
best. A masseuse is best, be
cause she's a professional. She
knows what sensually and sexu
ally stimulates her customers.

Each man is stimulated diffe
rently.
"What goes on in the rooms in
any studio, straight or otherwise,
is up to the discretion of the indi
vidual masseuse. A straight studio
is one that promotes no sex.' We
will not, at any point or time, solicit
a customer at all," she says.
"There are a lot of solid reasons
for that. First of all, soliciting is
against the law. But at least 90

percent of the guys who walk in
the door will solicit me."
Undercovers policemen
Masseuses must always worry
about undercover policemen pos
ing as customers and taping the
conversation with hidden recor
ders. A police officer can not ask a
masseuse to provide any sexual
services. So Misty uses a
technique that requires no verbal
commitment:
"Well, that's the end of your

massage. Did you want any other
kind of massage?"
"Yeah, I had something else in
mind."
"What?"
"Well, how about a local?" (A
local is manual stimulation of the
customer by the masseuse.)
"That's not included in the cost
of the massage "
"How much extra will that
cost?"
"I don't know."
The customer then quotes a
price, and Misty bargains with
head and hand gestures until an
amount is settled upon.
How much does she agree
upon for extras? Misty's voice
drops in volume.
"For a local, it might be. like,
$15. And, uh, for uh, a French, it'd
be," (a short pause), $35. Her
voices becomes softer still. "Inter
course, $50."
Those prices are in addition to
$30 spent on the original hour
long massage.
"It's very hard to be into mas
sage and not be into extras. We d
lose half our customers," she
says.
"You get every kind of man you
can imagine. Truck drivers,
salesmen, just generally horny
guys, athletes with sore muscles,
curiosity seekers." She also regu
larly massages several Stanford
students and "half a dozen pro
fessors."
Unusual interests
Some of the customers with
more unusual interests make ap
pointments for "outcalls." The
masseuse spends 30 minutes to

an hour at the customer's home
"I had this old man one time
who wanted to paddle me. Paid
me 200 bucks to paddle me.
Bare-assed naked with a ping
pong paddle."
She shows off her bank deposit
records. Combining salary, com
missions from massages, and the
money she earns from "extras,"
Misty takes home as much as
$200 some weeks.
The job can be dangerous. Two
weeks ago, she was attacked
while answering a phony outcall
request. She was almost raped
and kidnaped at gunpoint, but
managed to escape. Her face
turns serious when she describes
the incident.
Lucky
"I was lucky. In a few minutes I
would have been on a long road
headed nowhere. I was scared
like I've never been in my life.''
But on the whole, Misty enjoys
her job.
"At first. I had a lot of conflicts,
because of my sexual upbringing
I talked to close friends of mine
who were ministers, and the best
response I got was: It really
doesn't matter what you do." She
pauses for emphasis. "It's how
you do it."
"I take a lot of pride in my mas
sage and what I can do for some
one therapeutically. I feel good
about massage because I know
that my customers don t walk out
of here unhappy. They walk out of
here very happy and contented.
"They get a good massage,
good company, and I try to treat
them the best I can."


'Misty'
The heat is stifling. The air is
humid to the point of discomfort.
An atmosphere of cigarette
smoke masked by pungent per
fume assails the lungs.
A television sits in one corner of
the small reception room, silently
displaying a movie in shades of
blue and green. The only sounds
are the shrill notes of a "soul
music" radio station coming out of
a tinny speaker.
It's a slow Saturday night in a
Palo Alto massage studio.
The tinkle of the front door bell
announces the arrival of Misty, the
night manager. She bounces
through the reception room and
into the adjoining office.
Misty (not her real name) is an
atypical masseuse: she loves to
talk about massage. She know
ledgeably discusses the differ
ences between Oriental and
Swedish massage, the healing
powers of herbal medicines, and
the use of acu-pressure as a heal
ing art.
For example," she says as she
reaches over to grab the nearest
convenient arm, "these are acu
pressure points." Two strong fin
gers dig into flesh just above the
wrist. "Or —," and her other hand
grips the elbow like a vice.
Incapacitating
"See, and you can use the
same pressure points for de
fense," Misty says as she presses
harder still. "Incapacitating, isn't
it?" she asks.
The lesson is interrupted by the
arrival of the evening's first cus
tomer. Misty runs out to practice
her art, leaving a stack of her favo
rite paperbacks for perusal.
They have titles like Luytie's
Homeopathic Practice,
Biochemistry Up-to-date and
Healing Yourself with Foot Re
flexology.
Misty, who was born in Chicago
26 years ago, has "been around in
massage" most of her life. Her
father, a professional boxer, intro
duced her to massage when she
was a child and she often prac
ticed on his shoulders.
At Ohio State University, she
majored in agriculture biochemis
try, which led to an interest in the

blue jeans and a tight white satin
shirt — she leans back in the
squeaky chair and props her feet
up on the edge of an old couch.
"So you want to know what it's
like to be a masseuse," she says,
unprompted.
Not boring
"Well, it's definitely not boring.
None of us could stand to sit be
hind a desk. I meet people, and I
feel that I have a lot to offer them.
"Whether it involves sensuality
or sexuality, that encounter with
that customer is going to be the
best. A masseuse is best, be
cause she's a professional. She
knows what sensually and sexu
ally stimulates her customers.

Each man is stimulated diffe
rently.
"What goes on in the rooms in
any studio, straight or otherwise,
is up to the discretion of the indi
vidual masseuse. A straight studio
is one that promotes no sex.' We
will not, at any point or time, solicit
a customer at all," she says.
"There are a lot of solid reasons
for that. First of all, soliciting is
against the law. But at least 90

percent of the guys who walk in
the door will solicit me."
Undercovers policemen
Masseuses must always worry
about undercover policemen pos
ing as customers and taping the
conversation with hidden recor
ders. A police officer can not ask a
masseuse to provide any sexual
services. So Misty uses a
technique that requires no verbal
commitment:
"Well, that's the end of your

massage. Did you want any other
kind of massage?"
"Yeah, I had something else in
mind."
"What?"
"Well, how about a local?" (A
local is manual stimulation of the
customer by the masseuse.)
"That's not included in the cost
of the massage "
"How much extra will that
cost?"
"I don't know."
The customer then quotes a
price, and Misty bargains with
head and hand gestures until an
amount is settled upon.
How much does she agree
upon for extras? Misty's voice
drops in volume.
"For a local, it might be. like,
$15. And, uh, for uh, a French, it'd
be," (a short pause), $35. Her
voices becomes softer still. "Inter
course, $50."
Those prices are in addition to
$30 spent on the original hour
long massage.
"It's very hard to be into mas
sage and not be into extras. We d
lose half our customers," she
says.
"You get every kind of man you
can imagine. Truck drivers,
salesmen, just generally horny
guys, athletes with sore muscles,
curiosity seekers." She also regu
larly massages several Stanford
students and "half a dozen pro
fessors."
Unusual interests
Some of the customers with
more unusual interests make ap
pointments for "outcalls." The
masseuse spends 30 minutes to

an hour at the customer's home
"I had this old man one time
who wanted to paddle me. Paid
me 200 bucks to paddle me.
Bare-assed naked with a ping
pong paddle."
She shows off her bank deposit
records. Combining salary, com
missions from massages, and the
money she earns from "extras,"
Misty takes home as much as
$200 some weeks.
The job can be dangerous. Two
weeks ago, she was attacked
while answering a phony outcall
request. She was almost raped
and kidnaped at gunpoint, but
managed to escape. Her face
turns serious when she describes
the incident.
Lucky
"I was lucky. In a few minutes I
would have been on a long road
headed nowhere. I was scared
like I've never been in my life.''
But on the whole, Misty enjoys
her job.
"At first. I had a lot of conflicts,
because of my sexual upbringing
I talked to close friends of mine
who were ministers, and the best
response I got was: It really
doesn't matter what you do." She
pauses for emphasis. "It's how
you do it."
"I take a lot of pride in my mas
sage and what I can do for some
one therapeutically. I feel good
about massage because I know
that my customers don t walk out
of here unhappy. They walk out of
here very happy and contented.
"They get a good massage,
good company, and I try to treat
them the best I can."
