SAN JOSE (AP) â€” President
Ford ended a day of stumping in
the San Francisco Bay Area by
expressing strong opposition to
California's controversial nuclear
power initiative before a group of
news executives.
"If Proposition 15 was on the
ballot in Michigan I'd vote against
it," Ford told the five officials in an
informal hour-long meeting Tues
day night.
The measure, which is on the
June 8 ballot, would cut back the
output of existing nuclear generat
ing plants and ban new construc
tion within a few years unless lia
bility insurance levels are lifted
and legislative hearings deter
mine that plant safety has been
proven.
Ford contended that nuclear
power plants are as safe as any
other method now being used to
generate mass energy.
"By 1985 we will need 200 such
plants in the United States to get
our independence from the Middle
East," Ford said. Much of Ameri
ca's imported oil comes from the
Middle Eastern nations, which
have been raising prices for that
oil since 1973.
On other subjects, the Presi
dent expressed support for Sec
retary of State Henry Kissinger,
along with the hope that he would
retain his post if Ford was
reelected.

"We have been successful in
the past," he said.
On military matters, Ford said
he was pleased that Cuba was
withdrawing 200 troops a week
from the African nation of Angola,
but said he was unhappy with
Congressional action delaying
development of the manned B-1

supersonic bomber.
Ford said he would not recom
mend any action in connection
with Rep. Wayne Hays (D-Ohio),
who has admitted having an affair
with a paid member of his staff.
"Let the House Ethics Commit
tee do its own housekeeping,'' he
said.
