## COP rhetoric 
### 
William Massy

The recent statement by the
ASSU Council of Presidents
(COP) in the Daily Monday. May
24, expresses outrage at the deci
sion of the Economics Depart
ment not to promote Assoc. Prof.
Duncan Foley. I am concerned
about the rhetoric of the statement
and the fact that it ignores or over
simplifies many significant ques
tions. A concern for maintaining
the University's academic excel
lence (which, after all, is why most
students and faculty come here),
as well as focusing relatively more
attention upon teaching skill,
should lead to a more cool
headed and even-handed ap
proach.
It is said that "tenure decisions
on politically discriminatory
grounds are in direct violation of
the regulations of the American
Association of University Profes
sors." True But why did the au
thors not say also that such
grounds are in direct violation of
explicit written University
policies? (See the Statement on
Academic Freedom on p. 17 of the
Faculty Handbook.) I discussed
this policy extensively in a state
ment carried in the Daily and
Campus Report on May 12. The
Economics Department believes
strongly in this policy and the prin
ciple of academic freedom upon
which it is based, just as I do.
'Sorry tradition'
The COP speaks also of "a
sorry tradition of failures" on the
part of the University on behalf of
good teaching. This statement
fails to recognize the gains that
have been made through such
devices as the Faculty Senate's
legislation on the evaluation of
teaching (November 29, 1973)
and the recent announcement by
Dean Halsey Royden of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences (H&S) of 10 to 15 annual
teaching awards of special salary
increases for H&S faculty.
While there is no doubt that
some recent tenure decisions can
be perceived as negative to teach
ing values, there has been great
progress in getting explicit evalua
tions of teaching, by students
among others, into the tenure re
view. Doubtless more discussion
is needed, but one-sided rhetoric
will not advance this cause.
If the 'concerted action" that is
called for by students is the exer
cise of their good judgement in
choosing courses with an eye to
the quality of teaching as well as
the nature of the subject matter, I
have no quarrel with the idea.

Furthermore, I support the need
for student input into the teaching
evaluation process.
Faculty peers can and must
judge course content from the
standpoint of conceptual design
and, where possible, implementa
tion in the classroom. But students
are in a good position to contribute
judgements about many teaching
attributes, including skills of com
munication and discussion
leading, adequacy of preparation,
and accessibility.
Tenure committees
A demand for mandatory inclu
sion of students as voting mem
bers on tenure committees would
be counterproductive to the cause
of good teaching. What counts in
tenure evaluations by depart
ments. and the successive re
views by dean, provost, and the
Advisory Board, is the quality of
judgement and not relative voting
power. Years of experience in the
field can be very important for
judging both teaching and re
search. Students should provide
input to the evaluation process,
and discussions about the criteria
for promotions always are to be
encouraged in a free institution.
However, "student power" simply
is an inappropriate concept — a
red herring if you will — when it
comes to making tenure judge
ments.
I met with the new COP less
than 24 hours before the release
of their statement. (They did not
raise the Foley issue.) I am ready
to meet with them again to discuss
promotion criteria and methods
for the evaluation of teaching.
If Foley believes the decision in
his case may have been based
upon wrong criteria or inadequate
process. I urge him to seek addi
tional information from the Dean
of H&S and. if he feels it to be
appropriate, to activate the faculty
grievance procedure.

president and provost.)

comes to making tenure judge
ments.
I met with the new COP less
than 24 hours before the release
of their statement. (They did not
raise the Foley issue.) I am ready
to meet with them again to discuss
promotion criteria and methods
for the evaluation of teaching.
If Foley believes the decision in
his case may have been based
upon wrong criteria or inadequate
process. I urge him to seek addi
tional information from the Dean
of H&S and. if he feels it to be
appropriate, to activate the faculty
grievance procedure.

The recent statement by the
ASSU Council of Presidents
(COP) in the Daily Monday. May
24, expresses outrage at the deci
sion of the Economics Depart
ment not to promote Assoc. Prof.
Duncan Foley. I am concerned
about the rhetoric of the statement
and the fact that it ignores or over
simplifies many significant ques
tions. A concern for maintaining
the University's academic excel
lence (which, after all, is why most
students and faculty come here),
as well as focusing relatively more
attention upon teaching skill,
should lead to a more cool
headed and even-handed ap
proach.
It is said that "tenure decisions
on politically discriminatory
grounds are in direct violation of
the regulations of the American
Association of University Profes
sors." True But why did the au
thors not say also that such
grounds are in direct violation of
explicit written University
policies? (See the Statement on
Academic Freedom on p. 17 of the
Faculty Handbook.) I discussed
this policy extensively in a state
ment carried in the Daily and
Campus Report on May 12. The
Economics Department believes
strongly in this policy and the prin
ciple of academic freedom upon
which it is based, just as I do.
'Sorry tradition'
The COP speaks also of "a
sorry tradition of failures" on the
part of the University on behalf of
good teaching. This statement
fails to recognize the gains that
have been made through such
devices as the Faculty Senate's
legislation on the evaluation of
teaching (November 29, 1973)
and the recent announcement by
Dean Halsey Royden of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences (H&S) of 10 to 15 annual
teaching awards of special salary
increases for H&S faculty.
While there is no doubt that
some recent tenure decisions can
be perceived as negative to teach
ing values, there has been great
progress in getting explicit evalua
tions of teaching, by students
among others, into the tenure re
view. Doubtless more discussion
is needed, but one-sided rhetoric
will not advance this cause.
If the 'concerted action" that is
called for by students is the exer
cise of their good judgement in
choosing courses with an eye to
the quality of teaching as well as
the nature of the subject matter, I
have no quarrel with the idea.

Furthermore, I support the need
for student input into the teaching
evaluation process.
Faculty peers can and must
judge course content from the
standpoint of conceptual design
and, where possible, implementa
tion in the classroom. But students
are in a good position to contribute
judgements about many teaching
attributes, including skills of com
munication and discussion
leading, adequacy of preparation,
and accessibility.
Tenure committees
A demand for mandatory inclu
sion of students as voting mem
bers on tenure committees would
be counterproductive to the cause
of good teaching. What counts in
tenure evaluations by depart
ments. and the successive re
views by dean, provost, and the
Advisory Board, is the quality of
judgement and not relative voting
power. Years of experience in the
field can be very important for
judging both teaching and re
search. Students should provide
input to the evaluation process,
and discussions about the criteria
for promotions always are to be
encouraged in a free institution.
However, "student power" simply
is an inappropriate concept — a
red herring if you will — when it
comes to making tenure judge
ments.
