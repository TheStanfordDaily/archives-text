# THEATER
## 'Anything Goes': sharp and fun 
### Paul Jones 
If you were one of the lucky
people to be crammed into the
Otero-Rinconada Dining Hall to
see their production of Cole Por
ter's Anything Goes, you saw a
winner. Any production of this
play, with its excellent music and
lyrics, written by one of America
true theatrical geniuses, is worth
seeing, and the production this
weekend gave the Stanford com
munity a chance to see the art of
the American musical at its
sophisticated height.
The story itself, like that of most
thirties musicals, is rather superfi
cial, to say the least. But then the
plot isn't what you go to a Cole
Porter musical for. It's the music,
and expecially the words, and
Anything Goes is virtually jam
packed with Cole Porter hits.
From the opening number
"You're the Top," through such
favorites as "It's De-lovely,"
"Friendship" and"I Get a Kick Out
of You," the play is brimming with
the witty touch Porter had for the
English language. And of course,

the play also has its share of dou
ble entendres, which the audience
was quick to pick up.
The production itself was very
engaging. The excellent use of the
Otero-Rinconada dining hall al
lowed a fairly large set for a dorm
production, and quite a bit of stage
lighting, too. It all could have been
put to better use with a little more
color in the set, but over all, it was
quite impressive.
Snobby
As in most plays of this period,
the emphasis is not on the plot but
on the characters, and Anything
Goes has plenty to choose from.
There is everything from a seduc
tive night club singer to a delici
ously snobby Englishman (who
eventually wind up in each others'
arms!). Richard Maxwell was ex
cellent in the role of Sir Evelyn
Oakleigh, the high-class English
fiance of Hope Harcourt (Sandy
Efseaff).
His British accent was perfect
and he resisted falling into the
cliche that such characters so eas
ily become. His rendition of "Let s
Misbehave' was especially de
lightful. Duncan Moore was also
very good as Moonface Martin,
"Public Enemy No 13." His
characterization was not only
funny (especially in his number
Be Like the Bluebird"), but also
had an innocence that suited the
character perfectly It is refreshing
to see someone on a university
stage who is not constantly aware
that he is "acting."
The play was kept moving, not
only by the upbeat tempos, but
also by the energy of a chorus of
singers and dancers who backed
up the principals. There were the
problems that are found in any
non-professional production. The
singing was sometimes off-key,
and there was a little too much
mugging for this reviewer s taste.
On the other hand, the leads
were very good at handling dif
ficult material, especially with
problems of vocal range. Marshall
Peterson managed a fine delivery
of "You re the Top. even though it
was not really set within his range.
Finally, a number of lines were lost
under the laughter of the audi
ence. This is a problem that oc
curs frequently in dorm produc
tions, and could be worked out
with better timing.
Moil
A few other members of the
able cast deserve mention.
Teresa Ozoa tapdanced her way
into the audience s heart with her
portrayal of Bonny, the lovable
gun moll. And Marie Williams
made a suitably huffy dowager in
the role of Mrs. Harcourt.
All in all. Anything Goes made a
wonderful weekend entertain
ment. and at popular prices (free).
The only sad part is, all the dor
mitory productions tend to fall on
the same weekend, and this quar

ter there was television-like com
petition for audience choice —
you just couldn't take in them all.
One other show I saw was the
Mirrielees production of You 're A
Good Man Charlie Brown, Satur
day night at the Women's
Clubhouse. If you missed this one,
I'm afraid you missed another

winner. The small cast was de
lightful, and Sandra Jones as
Luch showed she had the natural
timing and wit of a true com
edienne. It is a shame that this
show was only performed one
time, and I can only hope that on a
campus this size, these players
can find the chance to repeat their
triumph of Saturday night.
