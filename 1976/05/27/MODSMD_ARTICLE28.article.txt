## 'Anything Goes': sharp and fun 
### Paul Jones 
If you were one of the lucky
people to be crammed into the
Otero-Rinconada Dining Hall to
see their production of Cole Por
ter's Anything Goes, you saw a
winner. Any production of this
play, with its excellent music and
lyrics, written by one of America
true theatrical geniuses, is worth
seeing, and the production this
weekend gave the Stanford com
munity a chance to see the art of
the American musical at its
sophisticated height.
The story itself, like that of most
thirties musicals, is rather superfi

plot isn't what you go to a Cole
Porter musical for. It's the music,
and expecially the words, and
Anything Goes is virtually jam
packed with Cole Porter hits.
From the opening number
"You're the Top," through such
favorites as "It's De-lovely,"
"Friendship" and"I Get a Kick Out
of You," the play is brimming with
the witty touch Porter had for the
English language. And of course,

the play also has its share of dou
ble entendres, which the audience
was quick to pick up.
The production itself was very
engaging. The excellent use of the
Otero-Rinconada dining hall al
lowed a fairly large set for a dorm
production, and quite a bit of stage
lighting, too. It all could have been
put to better use with a little more
color in the set, but over all, it was
quite impressive.
Snobby
As in most plays of this period,
the emphasis is not on the plot but
on the characters, and Anything
Goes has plenty to choose from.
There is everything from a seduc
tive night club singer to a delici
ously snobby Englishman (who
eventually wind up in each others'
arms!). Richard Maxwell was ex
cellent in the role of Sir Evelyn
Oakleigh, the high-class English
fiance of Hope Harcourt (Sandy
Efseaff).
His British accent was perfect
and he resisted falling into the
cliche that such characters so eas
