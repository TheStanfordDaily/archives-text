# 'Tea and Sympathy'
## Company's cozy show 
### Lori Matsukawa 
Afternoon tea with intimate friends can be love
ly . . .or painful. The Company's production of
Robert Anderson's "Tea and Sympathy" gave its
audiences a cozy look at a New England boarding
school which is suddenly thrust into a rude social
awakening.
A corner of Lagunita Court dining hall, decked
with heavy red velvet drapes served as the setting
for a drama both intense and deceptively serene.
Craig Peters was superb in his portrayal of Tom
Lee, a young and sensitive boy accused of
homosexual tendencies by his peers and instructors
at the all-boy, jock-oriented school.
Tom is seen by some of his classmates swimming
in the buff at the dunes with his music teacher,
played by Ricardo Rodrigues. When the news hits
the school, Tom finds himself lost in a barrage of
scathing false accusations from his classmates, his
otherwise uncaring father and the house fellow, a
P.E. coach named Bill Reynolds.
Laura
The only person who is sensitive to Tom's agony
is Coach Reynolds' wife, Laura, delicately portrayed
by Heidi Hartman. She offers more than tea and
sympathy to Tom. Laura is lonely. Her husband is
always going out with "his boys" despite Laura's
efforts to keep him home. She needs to care for
someone who will care for her also.
Peters' acting was convincing. He wore his role
like a familiar pair of tennis shoes. He was naive and
gentle without being silly. His frustrated outbursts at
his father and friends were never ill-timed and never
blew past the tasteful to the melodramatic.
When Tom decides to visit the local whore Ellie to
prove his manhood and miserably fails, he tries to

take his life. His anguished cry, "I am no man'
makes every heart shnnk with compassion.
Hartman, as the doting coach s wife, maintained a
calm and quietly optimistic personality throughout
the play. Her consistency was admirable but she
seemed kewpie-ish because she smiled all the time.
She could not keep an icy edge in her voice or
release her tormented emotions long enough with
out sliding back into her optimistic voice.
Voice
When Laura drops the bombshell on her husband
that she wished Tom had been to bed with her
instead of Ellie, her voice is as calm as if she's
asking him to take some tea.
A strong second male lead was played by Michael
Gebers as Coach Reynolds. He is a proud man who
finds Laura's attentions meddlesome. Gebers suc
cess as the unfeeling coach could be measured by
the amount of bile and hate he generaged among
the audience.
Bob Gerstmeyer did well as the callous father
Herb Lee by using an effective combination of indif
ferent manner, lounging demeanor and knock-em
dead lines like, ' We wanted him to become a man
we could be proud of, that's why we had him
Jock
Kudos to Mervyn Greene who played Al
Thompson, Tom's baseball jock roommate. Greene
was natural, as if someone plucked him out of this
actual situation.
Director Duncan Proudfoot should be applauded
for his skillful blending of subdued and intense emo
tions to create a timely social commentary for any
one who has ever questioned what it means to be a
man in society or more so, an independent indi
vidual in society.

at the all-boy, jock-oriented school.
Tom is seen by some of his classmates swimming
in the buff at the dunes with his music teacher,
played by Ricardo Rodrigues. When the news hits
the school, Tom finds himself lost in a barrage of
scathing false accusations from his classmates, his
otherwise uncaring father and the house fellow, a
P.E. coach named Bill Reynolds.
Laura
The only person who is sensitive to Tom's agony
is Coach Reynolds' wife, Laura, delicately portrayed
by Heidi Hartman. She offers more than tea and
sympathy to Tom. Laura is lonely. Her husband is
always going out with "his boys" despite Laura's
efforts to keep him home. She needs to care for
someone who will care for her also.
Peters' acting was convincing. He wore his role
like a familiar pair of tennis shoes. He was naive and
gentle without being silly. His frustrated outbursts at
his father and friends were never ill-timed and never
blew past the tasteful to the melodramatic.
When Tom decides to visit the local whore Ellie to
prove his manhood and miserably fails, he tries to

take his life. His anguished cry, "I am no man'
makes every heart shnnk with compassion.
Hartman, as the doting coach s wife, maintained a
calm and quietly optimistic personality throughout
the play. Her consistency was admirable but she
seemed kewpie-ish because she smiled all the time.
She could not keep an icy edge in her voice or
release her tormented emotions long enough with
out sliding back into her optimistic voice.
Voice
When Laura drops the bombshell on her husband
that she wished Tom had been to bed with her
instead of Ellie, her voice is as calm as if she's
asking him to take some tea.
A strong second male lead was played by Michael
Gebers as Coach Reynolds. He is a proud man who
finds Laura's attentions meddlesome. Gebers suc
cess as the unfeeling coach could be measured by
the amount of bile and hate he generaged among
the audience.
Bob Gerstmeyer did well as the callous father
Herb Lee by using an effective combination of indif
ferent manner, lounging demeanor and knock-em
dead lines like, ' We wanted him to become a man
we could be proud of, that's why we had him
Jock
Kudos to Mervyn Greene who played Al
Thompson, Tom's baseball jock roommate. Greene
was natural, as if someone plucked him out of this
actual situation.
Director Duncan Proudfoot should be applauded
for his skillful blending of subdued and intense emo
tions to create a timely social commentary for any
one who has ever questioned what it means to be a
man in society or more so, an independent indi
vidual in society.
Afternoon tea with intimate friends can be love
ly . . .or painful. The Company's production of
Robert Anderson's "Tea and Sympathy" gave its
audiences a cozy look at a New England boarding
school which is suddenly thrust into a rude social
awakening.
A corner of Lagunita Court dining hall, decked
with heavy red velvet drapes served as the setting
for a drama both intense and deceptively serene.
Craig Peters was superb in his portrayal of Tom
Lee, a young and sensitive boy accused of
homosexual tendencies by his peers and instructors
at the all-boy, jock-oriented school.
