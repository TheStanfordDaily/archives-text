## 'Arsenic' excells at Roble Hall 
### Helen Schawlow 
Arsenic And Old Lace, pre
sented by the Roble Players May
20-22, was the perfect blend of
offbeat comedy, fine acting and
good production necessary for an
evening of true entertainment.
The play, a classic by Joseph
Hesselring, is set in the 1940s
Brooklyn home of the rather odd
but terribly sweet Brewster sis
ters. Abby Brewster was deftly
portrayed by Kate Hokanson. Her
co-star, freshman Jodi Curlee as
Martha Brewster, conjured up the
exact formula of her not-so
innocent befuddled character.
The two elderly spinsters have
an unusual hobby: poisoning
lonely old gentlemen with a deadly
glass of elderberry wine. The
dears have three quite diverse
nephews who, each in their own
way, contribute to the humor and
action of the play.
Sane
Mortimer, the only sane main
character, is the hero of Arsenic
And Old Lace. Poor Mortimer has
a night job. He is a New York thea
ter critic. "Please don't think
harshly of Mortimer," Abby
pleads. "Somebody has to do
those things."
Hector Chaparro played Mor
timer as the dashing romantic
hero that Hesselring intended him
to be. Unfortunately, his girlfriend
Elaine Harper, played by Jeannie
Huntsman, was not his equal
dramatically. This is not
Huntsman's fault. After all, there's
only so much you can do with lines
about how good your legs are.
Perhaps the most eccentric
character in Arsenic And Old
Lace is Teddy Brewster. You see,

Teddy thinks he's Teddy
Roosevelt. He enjoys nothing bet
ter than going to "Panama" (the
basement) to dig canals which just
happen to be the standard grave
size. Joe Gattuso looked remark
ably like Roosevelt, especially
when he smiled. His costumes
were perfect. Teddy looked
equally dashing whether drinking
tea in a tuxedo or charging "San
Juan Hill" (the stairs) in his kakhi
safari outfit complete with white pit
helmut and pince-nez.
Shady
Teddy'sand Mortimer's brother
Jonathan is the kind of guy that
"likes to cut worms in two . .. with
his teeth." He is a gangster who
has gone into the illegal face-lift
business with the shady Dr. Eins
tein (that's Herman, not Albert).
Jonathan, played by Joe Dietsen,
was supposed to look like Boris
Karloff. He didn't, but he sure
sounded like him.
The best actor in the Roble pro
duction of Arsenic And Old Lace
was Tom Galligan as Dr. Einstein.
His gestures, facial expressions,
and German accent made the
kinky plastic surgeon come to life.
One almost wonders if Galligan is
that way in real life. "He acts so
natural," commented Sue O'Mal
ley at Thursday's performance.
"I'd like to meet him in real
life ... just to be sure."
The set, designed by Paul Ed
wards, evoked the slightly seedy
Brewster home right down to its
flowered chintz curtains. Paul
Edwards also produced the play
with Director Kurt Cobb. The cos
tumes were good but not up to par
with the rest of the production.

The set, designed by Paul Ed
wards, evoked the slightly seedy
Brewster home right down to its
flowered chintz curtains. Paul
Edwards also produced the play
with Director Kurt Cobb. The cos
tumes were good but not up to par
with the rest of the production.
Arsenic And Old Lace, pre
sented by the Roble Players May
20-22, was the perfect blend of
offbeat comedy, fine acting and
good production necessary for an
evening of true entertainment.
The play, a classic by Joseph
Hesselring, is set in the 1940s
Brooklyn home of the rather odd
but terribly sweet Brewster sis
ters. Abby Brewster was deftly
portrayed by Kate Hokanson. Her
co-star, freshman Jodi Curlee as
Martha Brewster, conjured up the
exact formula of her not-so
innocent befuddled character.
The two elderly spinsters have
an unusual hobby: poisoning
lonely old gentlemen with a deadly
glass of elderberry wine. The
dears have three quite diverse
nephews who, each in their own
way, contribute to the humor and
action of the play.
Sane
Mortimer, the only sane main
character, is the hero of Arsenic
And Old Lace. Poor Mortimer has
a night job. He is a New York thea
ter critic. "Please don't think
harshly of Mortimer," Abby
pleads. "Somebody has to do
those things."
Hector Chaparro played Mor
timer as the dashing romantic
hero that Hesselring intended him
to be. Unfortunately, his girlfriend
Elaine Harper, played by Jeannie
Huntsman, was not his equal
dramatically. This is not
Huntsman's fault. After all, there's
only so much you can do with lines
about how good your legs are.
Perhaps the most eccentric
character in Arsenic And Old
Lace is Teddy Brewster. You see,

Teddy thinks he's Teddy
Roosevelt. He enjoys nothing bet
ter than going to "Panama" (the
basement) to dig canals which just
happen to be the standard grave
size. Joe Gattuso looked remark
ably like Roosevelt, especially
when he smiled. His costumes
were perfect. Teddy looked
equally dashing whether drinking
tea in a tuxedo or charging "San
Juan Hill" (the stairs) in his kakhi
safari outfit complete with white pit
helmut and pince-nez.
Shady
Teddy'sand Mortimer's brother
Jonathan is the kind of guy that
"likes to cut worms in two . .. with
his teeth." He is a gangster who
has gone into the illegal face-lift
business with the shady Dr. Eins
tein (that's Herman, not Albert).
Jonathan, played by Joe Dietsen,
was supposed to look like Boris
Karloff. He didn't, but he sure
sounded like him.
The best actor in the Roble pro
duction of Arsenic And Old Lace
was Tom Galligan as Dr. Einstein.
His gestures, facial expressions,
and German accent made the
kinky plastic surgeon come to life.
One almost wonders if Galligan is
that way in real life. "He acts so
natural," commented Sue O'Mal
ley at Thursday's performance.
"I'd like to meet him in real
life ... just to be sure."
