## 'Fields and Me': A quality tribute 
### Howard Baldwin 
W. C. Fields And Me can only
be superficially compared to its
cousin Gable And Lombard. Al
though both are Hollywood love
stories from the less-than-daring
Universal Studios, there's no fam
ily resemblance whatsoever.
Where Gable and Lombard is im
plausible, IM.C. Fields And Me is
realistic. Where the former brut
ally simplifies its characters into
wooden misfits, the latter shows
the complex and contradictory
sides of its characters.
Both Rod Steiger and W.C.
Fields and Valerie Perrine as his
mistress Carlotta reflect far more
depth than James Brolin or Jill
Clayburgh did. Steiger ingeni
ously produces a glimpse into the
phobias and neuroses of a man
long dismissed as an incurable
misanthrope. The background
into Fields' health, finances and
psyche is handled well by director
Arthur Hiller. Comedy fits well into
the structure because it was a
mainstay of Fields' life, providing
some funny scenes along the
way.
The film shows Fields as a man
of alternate great insecurity and

pompousness. He was capable of
being both loyal and evil to his
friends and lovers, depending on
his mental stature. But above all,
Fields is treated respectfully by
Hitler and Steiger as both a come
dian and a man — something at
which Gable and Lombard failed
miserably.
And, unlike Gable and Lom
bard, it is tasteful in its romanti
cism. Beautifully touching scenes
abound;at the seashore before his
success in Hollywood, Fields
romps in the surf with his midget
companion Ludwig (Billy Barty).
His insecure charm shows
through when Carlotta calmly
asks him one night why he's never

tried to seduce her.
And the final scene, when she
stands outside his bungalow at
the sanitarium and sprays water
on the roof with a garden hose to
simulate rain and cure his insom
nia, is heartwarming in a bit
tersweet kind of way.
Although the credit sequence,
showing Fields' trunk being trans
ported around the world in his
vaudeville days, is imaginative, it
is also ultimately tasteless since
dogs urinate on the trunk every
place it is unloaded. Fortunately,
the film improves.
A bright musical score by Henry
Mancini accentuates the comedy
that ruled Fields' life. Exterior

scenes photographed by David
Walsh are softly focused, produc
ing sparkles of sunlight simulating
a fantasy-like aura, appropriate
because we are looking back in
time at an era when Hollywood
specialized in producing fan
tasies.
The supporting actors portray
such Hollywood celebrities as
John Barrymore (Jack Cassidy),
Gregory LaCava (Allan Arbus),
Dave Chasen (Milt Kamen), Gene
Fowler (Louise Zorich), but the
spotlight is on Steiger as Fields,
who runs away with the picture.
Regrettably, there is one re
semblance to the shoddiness of
Gable and Lombard. In one

scene Fields agent. Dockstedter
(Dana Eicar),is driving Carlotta up
to Field s Beverly Hills mansion. If
one looks carefully out the win
dows of his car. one can see 1975
cars parked along the curb What
realism!
Since it is more a biography
than a plotted story about an event
in Field's life, there are some
scenes that drag. However, they
serve to characterize Fields com
pletely — something that doesn't
always happen in films of this
genre. W. C. Fields And Me is of a
higher quality than the other "tri
butes" Hollywood has been
back-handing itself recently.
