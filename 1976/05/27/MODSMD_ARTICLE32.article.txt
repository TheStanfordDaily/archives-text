this year," says teaching assistant
Frank Hawke, who was also in the
class in 1974. "We've done a lot
more things together this time."
Social events
The two delegations have got
ten together for five social events
this quarter. A reception was held
at Weiler's house at the beginning
of the quarter, to break the ice.
Since then, the negotiators have
had a reception at the American
Embassy in San Francisco and a
Soviet-sponsored dacquiri party
where the delegates later
watched Dr. Stangelove together.
During the movie, each delegation
sat on opposite sides of the room,
cheering for their respective
sides.
Tensions have arisen between
the two delegations. Two weeks
ago, they hit an impasse, where at
one working group session, the
Soviets walked out on the Ameri
cans.
"For nearly two weeks," says
Woods, "I hardly spoke to (U.S.
chairman) Jim Myerson. And he's
a good friend of mine."
Since that walkout, tempers
have cooled, but Weiler says he
still gets phone calls asking if the
negotiations are still on for that
day.
"I had one student come in here
who was so depressed," he says.
"He kept saying 'We were so
close.' But you've got to be more
than close when you negotiate a
treaty."
Hawks, doves
!ntra-delegation squabbles
have many times permeated the
negotiations, for each side has the
fair share of hawks and doves.
"Soviet" Cramolini, considered
a dove within his delegation, says
he found a need for someone to
play the role of the dove.
"There is a faction within the
Soviet Union which is asking the
government to cool it on defense
spending. Their economy just
can't handle it. I've found that, for
purposes of the class, I could quite
easily fill that role."
And the U.S. delegation has its
hawks, such as Roos. "In the
treaty we're going to sign, I guess
you could say the hawks didn't

achieve as much as we should.''
he says. "But I think we made the
treaty more realistic by what we
did gain."
The proposed treaty includes a
testing and deployment ban on
multiple-warhead re-entry vehi
cles(MßVs) onmultiple-warhead
independently-targetable re-entry
vehicles (MIRVs), and on the
more advanced maneuverable
re-entry vehicles (MaRVs). There
is also a comprehensive test ban,
including peaceful nuclear explo
sion and a ban on mobile intercon
tinental ballistic missile (ICBM)
launchers.
Ceilings
In addition, an overall ceiling of
1700 on each country's nuclear
force has been set with various
sub-limits on particular types of
missiles and bombers.

The Vladivostok accords for
SALT II set a total nuclear ceiling
of 2400.
For Hawke. this quarter has
been a deja vu. A first-year
graduate student in political sci
ence, he serves as advisor to the
Soviet delegation. Two years ago,
he was a member of the American
delegation.
"I purposely chose the Soviet
side this time," he says. "It's like a
double learning experience."
The idea of negotiating as either
a Soviet or an American "is com
pletely different from that of a
Stanford student," Hawke adds.
"Last quarter probably 90 percent
of these students were your basic
university liberals. Now they're
haggling over 300 SS-95."
John Harris, chairman of the
Soviet delegation, says he has

found it easier to be a Soviet than
he thought it would be.
"After a while it becomes au
tomatic to start thinking the way
the Soviets do," he says."I think
the American side would be much
harder — they have more irons in
the fire."
All the Soviets agree that the
biggest obstacle to overcome was
the lack of information about
Soviet life and attitudes.
"In the beginning, a lot of it had
to be guesswork," Cramolini
adds.
Dan Caldwell is the advisor to
the American delegation. This is
his second graduate year at Stan
ford, but he has previously con
ducted simulations on a smaller
scale while in the Navy.
The faculty's role is that of an
advisory body, including their par

ticipation as a "Senate Foreign
Relations Committee for the U.S.
and a "full Politburo" for the
Soviets. Besides Weiler. Physics
Prof. Sidney Drell, deputy director
of SLAC, and Political Science
Prof. John Lewis, director of the
Stanford Arms Control Program,
serve as faculty for the course.
' Weiler is the key to the simula
tion," Hawke asserts.
"Drell and Weiler are unbeliev
able," Woods adds. "Drell lets us
call him up any time about any
problem. He even comes over to
our dorms to see us."
Weiler laughingly says he
thinks "they're going to drive Sid
Drell crazy" but Hawke claims that
"Drell loves it anyway."
Weiler worked in the State De
partment for 20 years, becoming
counselor to the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency in 1969.
until his appointment at Stanford
in 1973.
Drell has served as technical
consultant to the SALT I delega
tion and the Department of De
fense, and has been a member of
the President's Science Advisory
Committee Lewis is a specialist in
Chinese politics.
The negotiations have attracted
interest from various government
officials. Weiler says a copy of the
treaty, which is to be signed next
Thursday, is being sent out to 50
institutions and to some govern
ment agencies.
But sometimes the students'
sophistication has blended into
exhausted giddiness, the simula
tion becomes reality and for the 24
students the initial fascination be
comes a permanent part of their
lives. Perhaps it is the perfect
class, a different way to learn.
As Caldwell puts it though, for
those who may feel hardening of
the arteries setting in from count
less lectures and seminars, "simu
lation may provide a healthy and
enjoyable SALT substitute."

chairman Jim Myerson and Soviet delegation chairman John Harris.
this year," says teaching assistant
Frank Hawke, who was also in the
class in 1974. "We've done a lot
more things together this time."
Social events
The two delegations have got
ten together for five social events
this quarter. A reception was held
at Weiler's house at the beginning
of the quarter, to break the ice.
Since then, the negotiators have
had a reception at the American
Embassy in San Francisco and a
Soviet-sponsored dacquiri party
where the delegates later
watched Dr. Stangelove together.
During the movie, each delegation
sat on opposite sides of the room,
cheering for their respective
sides.
Tensions have arisen between
the two delegations. Two weeks
ago, they hit an impasse, where at
one working group session, the
Soviets walked out on the Ameri
cans.
"For nearly two weeks," says
Woods, "I hardly spoke to (U.S.
chairman) Jim Myerson. And he's
a good friend of mine."
Since that walkout, tempers
have cooled, but Weiler says he
still gets phone calls asking if the
negotiations are still on for that
day.
"I had one student come in here
who was so depressed," he says.
"He kept saying 'We were so
close.' But you've got to be more
than close when you negotiate a
treaty."
Hawks, doves
!ntra-delegation squabbles
have many times permeated the
negotiations, for each side has the
fair share of hawks and doves.
"Soviet" Cramolini, considered
a dove within his delegation, says
he found a need for someone to
play the role of the dove.
"There is a faction within the
Soviet Union which is asking the
government to cool it on defense
spending. Their economy just
can't handle it. I've found that, for
purposes of the class, I could quite
easily fill that role."
And the U.S. delegation has its
hawks, such as Roos. "In the
treaty we're going to sign, I guess
you could say the hawks didn't

achieve as much as we should.''
he says. "But I think we made the
treaty more realistic by what we
did gain."
The proposed treaty includes a
testing and deployment ban on
multiple-warhead re-entry vehi
cles(MßVs) onmultiple-warhead
independently-targetable re-entry
vehicles (MIRVs), and on the
more advanced maneuverable
re-entry vehicles (MaRVs). There
is also a comprehensive test ban,
including peaceful nuclear explo
sion and a ban on mobile intercon
tinental ballistic missile (ICBM)
launchers.
Ceilings
In addition, an overall ceiling of
1700 on each country's nuclear
force has been set with various
sub-limits on particular types of
missiles and bombers.

The Vladivostok accords for
SALT II set a total nuclear ceiling
of 2400.
For Hawke. this quarter has
been a deja vu. A first-year
graduate student in political sci
ence, he serves as advisor to the
Soviet delegation. Two years ago,
he was a member of the American
delegation.
"I purposely chose the Soviet
side this time," he says. "It's like a
double learning experience."
The idea of negotiating as either
a Soviet or an American "is com
pletely different from that of a
Stanford student," Hawke adds.
"Last quarter probably 90 percent
of these students were your basic
university liberals. Now they're
haggling over 300 SS-95."
John Harris, chairman of the
Soviet delegation, says he has

found it easier to be a Soviet than
he thought it would be.
"After a while it becomes au
tomatic to start thinking the way
the Soviets do," he says."I think
the American side would be much
harder — they have more irons in
the fire."
All the Soviets agree that the
biggest obstacle to overcome was
the lack of information about
Soviet life and attitudes.
"In the beginning, a lot of it had
to be guesswork," Cramolini
adds.
Dan Caldwell is the advisor to
the American delegation. This is
his second graduate year at Stan
ford, but he has previously con
ducted simulations on a smaller
scale while in the Navy.
The faculty's role is that of an
advisory body, including their par

ticipation as a "Senate Foreign

Soviets. Besides Weiler. Physics
Prof. Sidney Drell, deputy director
of SLAC, and Political Science
Prof. John Lewis, director of the
Stanford Arms Control Program,

' Weiler is the key to the simula
tion," Hawke asserts.
"Drell and Weiler are unbeliev
able," Woods adds. "Drell lets us
call him up any time about any
problem. He even comes over to
our dorms to see us."
Weiler laughingly says he
thinks "they're going to drive Sid
Drell crazy" but Hawke claims that
"Drell loves it anyway."
Weiler worked in the State De
partment for 20 years, becoming
counselor to the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency in 1969.

in 1973.
Drell has served as technical
consultant to the SALT I delega
tion and the Department of De
fense, and has been a member of
the President's Science Advisory
Committee Lewis is a specialist in
Chinese politics.
The negotiations have attracted
interest from various government
officials. Weiler says a copy of the
treaty, which is to be signed next
Thursday, is being sent out to 50
institutions and to some govern
ment agencies.
But sometimes the students'
sophistication has blended into
exhausted giddiness, the simula

chairman Jim Myerson and Soviet delegation chairman John Harris.
this year," says teaching assistant
Frank Hawke, who was also in the
class in 1974. "We've done a lot
more things together this time."
Social events
The two delegations have got
ten together for five social events
this quarter. A reception was held
at Weiler's house at the beginning
of the quarter, to break the ice.
Since then, the negotiators have
had a reception at the American
Embassy in San Francisco and a
Soviet-sponsored dacquiri party
where the delegates later
watched Dr. Stangelove together.
During the movie, each delegation
sat on opposite sides of the room,
cheering for their respective
sides.
Tensions have arisen between
the two delegations. Two weeks
ago, they hit an impasse, where at
one working group session, the
Soviets walked out on the Ameri
cans.
"For nearly two weeks," says
Woods, "I hardly spoke to (U.S.
chairman) Jim Myerson. And he's
a good friend of mine."
Since that walkout, tempers
have cooled, but Weiler says he
still gets phone calls asking if the
negotiations are still on for that
day.
"I had one student come in here
who was so depressed," he says.
"He kept saying 'We were so
close.' But you've got to be more
than close when you negotiate a
treaty."
Hawks, doves
!ntra-delegation squabbles
have many times permeated the
negotiations, for each side has the
fair share of hawks and doves.
"Soviet" Cramolini, considered
a dove within his delegation, says
he found a need for someone to
play the role of the dove.
"There is a faction within the
Soviet Union which is asking the
government to cool it on defense
spending. Their economy just
can't handle it. I've found that, for
purposes of the class, I could quite
easily fill that role."
And the U.S. delegation has its
hawks, such as Roos. "In the
treaty we're going to sign, I guess
you could say the hawks didn't

achieve as much as we should.''
he says. "But I think we made the
treaty more realistic by what we
did gain."
The proposed treaty includes a
testing and deployment ban on
multiple-warhead re-entry vehi
cles(MßVs) onmultiple-warhead
independently-targetable re-entry
vehicles (MIRVs), and on the
more advanced maneuverable
re-entry vehicles (MaRVs). There
is also a comprehensive test ban,
including peaceful nuclear explo
sion and a ban on mobile intercon
tinental ballistic missile (ICBM)
launchers.
Ceilings
In addition, an overall ceiling of
1700 on each country's nuclear
force has been set with various
sub-limits on particular types of
missiles and bombers.

The Vladivostok accords for
SALT II set a total nuclear ceiling
of 2400.
For Hawke. this quarter has
been a deja vu. A first-year
graduate student in political sci
ence, he serves as advisor to the
Soviet delegation. Two years ago,
he was a member of the American
delegation.
"I purposely chose the Soviet
side this time," he says. "It's like a
double learning experience."
The idea of negotiating as either
a Soviet or an American "is com
pletely different from that of a
Stanford student," Hawke adds.
"Last quarter probably 90 percent
of these students were your basic
university liberals. Now they're
haggling over 300 SS-95."
John Harris, chairman of the
Soviet delegation, says he has

found it easier to be a Soviet than
he thought it would be.
"After a while it becomes au
tomatic to start thinking the way
the Soviets do," he says."I think
the American side would be much
harder — they have more irons in
the fire."
All the Soviets agree that the
biggest obstacle to overcome was
the lack of information about
Soviet life and attitudes.
"In the beginning, a lot of it had
to be guesswork," Cramolini
adds.
Dan Caldwell is the advisor to
the American delegation. This is
his second graduate year at Stan
ford, but he has previously con
ducted simulations on a smaller
scale while in the Navy.
The faculty's role is that of an
advisory body, including their par

ticipation as a "Senate Foreign
Relations Committee for the U.S.
and a "full Politburo" for the
Soviets. Besides Weiler. Physics
Prof. Sidney Drell, deputy director
of SLAC, and Political Science
Prof. John Lewis, director of the
Stanford Arms Control Program,
serve as faculty for the course.
' Weiler is the key to the simula
tion," Hawke asserts.
"Drell and Weiler are unbeliev
able," Woods adds. "Drell lets us
call him up any time about any
problem. He even comes over to
our dorms to see us."
Weiler laughingly says he
thinks "they're going to drive Sid
Drell crazy" but Hawke claims that
"Drell loves it anyway."
Weiler worked in the State De
partment for 20 years, becoming
counselor to the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency in 1969.
