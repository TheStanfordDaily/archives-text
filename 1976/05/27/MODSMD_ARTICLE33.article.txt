LOS ANGELES — Gov. Edmund Brown
Jr. said yesterday he has a "hunch" Jimmy
Carter's bandwagon will go downhill, and
Frank Church said he has come to Califor
nia to try to lower Brown's expectations.
Idaho Sen. Church, fresh from his Ore
gon primary triumph over Carter and
Brown, told students at UCLA that Brown's
strong wnte-in campaign kept him from a
bigger Oregon victory.
Church said he is not "rash enough" to
say that anyone except Brown would win
California's Democratic primary.
In Sacramento, Brown told a news con
ference that his 23 percent showing in the
Oregon primary, just five percentage
points behind runnerup Carter, was the
strongest wnte-in in any election involving
voting machines.

In fact, he said "there's still some possi
bility that I'll edge out Carter'' when all the
write-ins are counted. Oregon officials said
that could be today.
Illinois scandal surfaces
CHICAGO — The scandal-plagued Il
linois legislature is involved in new trouble
— testimony that many lawmakers got
payoffs from the ready-mix concrete indus
try.
Witnesses at a trial in U.S. District Court
have told of $500 in payoff money ex
changed furtively in a speeding car on a
lonely highway and of crisp $100 bills
pressed into legislative palms in a men's
room at the Statehouse.
Former state Sen. Donald Carpentier
testified this week that he mailed payoff
money to nine lawmakers after they voted
for 1972 legislation to increase the legal
weight of ready-mix concrete trucks.
Carpentier said he sent $500 to the floor
manager of the bill, former state Sen. Jack
Walker, and $100 each to eight other Re
publican senators, two of whom have been
indicted.
Chief prosecutor Dan Webb said the in
vestigation of others is continuing.
'Nixon should talk'
NEW YORK — John Ehrlichman,
onetime adviser to former President
Richard Nixon, says Nixon has an obliga
tion to step forward and tell everything
about his involvement in Watergate.
The once tight-lipped and brusque pres-

idential deputy said he wants to tell of his
own involvement in the scandel, but said
he doesn't have access to his records
since they were seized by the FBI the day
he resigned.
"I don't see any other way to finish the
Watergate chapter except for the people to
come forward," Ehrlichman said in an in
terview Tuesday.
Ehrlichman was in town promoting his
novel, The Company, a politics and es
pionage thriller.
Hays: 'I was blackmailed'
WASHINGTON — Rep. Wayne Hays
(D-Ohio) said yesterday that Elizabeth Ray
"blackmailed me for cash, U.S. currency,"
and that she threatened suicide if he re
fused to take her out to dinner. He gave few
details and she denied it.
Declaring "I am not a liar," Hays told a
reporter that for 18 months he was a victim
of monetary and emotional blackmail.
Ray, 33, has said she was paid a
$14,000-a-year government salary and
performed no chores except as the 65-
year-old Hays' mistress. On Tuesday,
Hays said she was hired to perform Ad
ministration Committee clerical duties and
nothing more.
Ray continued to dispute Hays' descrip
tion of their relationship after he said that
she had blackmailed him for an un
specified amount of money.

dant Louie Wilson, testified yesterday he is

still be transformed into the world's best
fighting men," Gen. Wilson told the House
military personnel subcommittee.
The commandant told the congressmen
he wished he could say the incidents were
"aberrations in an otherwise perfect sys
tem.
"Unfortunately, I cannot," he said.
Wilson was referring to the alleged beat

Illinois scandal surfaces
CHICAGO — The scandal-plagued Il
linois legislature is involved in new trouble
— testimony that many lawmakers got
payoffs from the ready-mix concrete indus
try.
Witnesses at a trial in U.S. District Court
have told of $500 in payoff money ex
changed furtively in a speeding car on a
lonely highway and of crisp $100 bills
pressed into legislative palms in a men's
room at the Statehouse.
Former state Sen. Donald Carpentier
testified this week that he mailed payoff
money to nine lawmakers after they voted
for 1972 legislation to increase the legal
weight of ready-mix concrete trucks.
Carpentier said he sent $500 to the floor
manager of the bill, former state Sen. Jack
Walker, and $100 each to eight other Re
publican senators, two of whom have been
indicted.
Chief prosecutor Dan Webb said the in
vestigation of others is continuing.
'Nixon should talk'
NEW YORK — John Ehrlichman,
onetime adviser to former President
Richard Nixon, says Nixon has an obliga
tion to step forward and tell everything
about his involvement in Watergate.

idential deputy said he wants to tell of his
own involvement in the scandel, but said
he doesn't have access to his records
since they were seized by the FBI the day
he resigned.
"I don't see any other way to finish the
Watergate chapter except for the people to
come forward," Ehrlichman said in an in
terview Tuesday.
Ehrlichman was in town promoting his
novel, The Company, a politics and es
pionage thriller.
Hays: 'I was blackmailed'

reporter that for 18 months he was a victim
of monetary and emotional blackmail.

$14,000-a-year government salary and
performed no chores except as the 65-
year-old Hays' mistress. On Tuesday,
Hays said she was hired to perform Ad
ministration Committee clerical duties and
nothing more.
Ray continued to dispute Hays' descrip
tion of their relationship after he said that
she had blackmailed him for an un
specified amount of money.

N.Y. Demo chairman indicted
NFW YORK — State Democratic
Chairman Patrick Cunningham, host to his
party's national convention this summer,
was indicted yesterday on a charge of sel
ling a judgeship for an unspecified price.
In separate indictments, he and his law
partner, Joseph Kaming, were accused of
attempting to cover up $50,000 in influ
ence payoffs from banks handling state
funds to mislead a special grand jury inves
tigation Cunningham's affairs.
In Albany. Democratic Gov. Hugh Carey
indicated that he thinks his hand-picked
state chairman should step down. Carey
questioned whether in light of the indict
ments Cunningham "can fulfill his party
responsibilities."
Maurice Nadjari, a Republican, pro
cured the long-expected indictment as the
climax to an investigation which he
claimed placed Cunningham "at the center
of the corrupt marketplace of judgeships"
in the Bronx, where Cunningham also is
county Demociatic leader.

LOS ANGELES — Gov. Edmund Brown
Jr. said yesterday he has a "hunch" Jimmy
Carter's bandwagon will go downhill, and
Frank Church said he has come to Califor
nia to try to lower Brown's expectations.
Idaho Sen. Church, fresh from his Ore
gon primary triumph over Carter and
Brown, told students at UCLA that Brown's
strong wnte-in campaign kept him from a
bigger Oregon victory.
Church said he is not "rash enough" to
say that anyone except Brown would win
California's Democratic primary.
In Sacramento, Brown told a news con
ference that his 23 percent showing in the
Oregon primary, just five percentage
points behind runnerup Carter, was the
strongest wnte-in in any election involving
voting machines.

In fact, he said "there's still some possi
bility that I'll edge out Carter'' when all the
write-ins are counted. Oregon officials said
that could be today.
