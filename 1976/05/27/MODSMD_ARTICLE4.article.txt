# Re-examine candidates' stands

It was unfortunate that space
limitations kept the Daily from re
porting what, to me. was the high
light of the May 18 "Campaign
76" symposium that featured the
representatives of seven presi
dential candidates.
The pointed questions of Bill
Evers, who spoke on behalf of
Libertarian Party candidate Roger
Mac√üride, initiated a lively debate
that resulted in elusive replies and
a preponderance of vague
generalities that were intent upon
avoiding the specific issues.
For example. Michael Brady,
who represented former Governor
Ronald Reagan, said that Reagan
is "essentially" Libertarian. But
how can Reagan consider himself
a Libertarian, queried Evers,
when Reagan is "opposed to the
legalization of marijuana, op
posed to the legalization of gambl
ing, supported the building of a
government subsidized SST,
favors conscription in wartime and
opposes amnesty for war resis
ters?"
The response was typically
political. "Well, it depends upon
your definition of Libertarian." He
proceeded to avoid the specifics

and never answered the charges.
Gov. Jerry Brown's rep
resentative was anxious to have
us know that Americans need to
respect developing countries and
realize that we must limit our
economic expectations in accor
dance with material reality. Evers
asked Peter Boland, who rep
resented Brown, to reconcile
Brown's position with his recent
statements on foreign policy.
What kind of respect is Brown
purporting when he speaks of
"third-rate" countries "pushing
America around"? His real feel
ings seem better capsulized in his
threat that "if countries think they
can thwart our pride, they will do it
at their peril."

Evers also questioned Carter s
position favoring a pardon for
draft evaders but not for deser
ters. Carter has said, "people
should fight in a war although they
think it's totally immoral" and that
they should be held responsible
for failing to do so. I suspect this
may be a forewarning of Carter's
political compromises on crucial
human rights issues.
The other representatives
faired no better under Evers' inci
sive questioning. I hope bringing
up these issues will lead people to
re-examine the candidates'
stands. Kudos to Evers for point
ing out their inconsistencies.
