Parent-substitute
I can't work up much sympathy
for Chuck Hirsch, whose bleat ap
peared in the Daily May 20. That
wasn't a high priest he was talking
to. It was what he hoped would be
a parent-substitute, there to feed
him ire-digested pablum and save
him the trouble of chewing for
himself.
Most likely, though, Hirsch's
bugbear was neither priest nor pa
rent, but just a teacher insisting
that he take some responsibility
for his own education.
