The University will probably file
charges against the Stanford Band
for playing in Meyer Library (UGLY)
Monday night, Legal Adviser to the
President James Siena said yes
terday.
Siena said, "we're still in the
process of investigating the mat
ter" but predicted that a decision
to prosecute before the Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC) would be

made today or tomorrow 'by the
latest."
"It's almost a certainty that
charges will be filed, the question
is against whom," Siena said.
Those band members who will
be charged will probably be cited
"mainly for disruption charges,
under the Campus Disruption Pol
icy," Siena said.
Other charqes may also be
filed.

"Vtfe haven't really refined the
legalities of the matter yet," Siena
explained.
He added that notices stating
that disruptions in Meyer Library
would make students liable for
campus disruption prosecution
had been posted in the library ear
lier this quarter.
The possible charges stem
from an incident Monday night
when about 50 band members
and the Dollies entered the library
shortly before 10 p.m. The band
gathered in the second floor lobby
and on the third and fourth floor
balconies and played two songs.
The band left the library about
10:05 p.m.
Rich Johnson, a band member,
said last night the band has de
cided to keep the incident "low
key."
"We've kind of mellowed .out
and want to solve it within the Uni
versity, without a student rally to
support the band," Johnson said.
Johnson said the band does not
see this as big an issue as the
alleged trashing of four fraternity
houses by members of the Delta
Tau Delta fraternity.
Johnson said that band mem
bers will deal with charges
brought against them as soon as
they are charged.
"If there are prosecutions, that's
a whole other story at this point as
far as we're concerned," he said.
Johnson said the band mem
bers have not yet considered what
they would do if taken before the
SJC, which hears campus disrup
tion policy violation cases.
"We'll have to contend with that
(the SJC) when we get to that,"
said Johnson.
