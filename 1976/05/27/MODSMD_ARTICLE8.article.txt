## Backcharges asked for hospital addition 
### Dave Ansley Last of two parts 
The University has sent a claim
for "a substantial amount" of
"backcharges" to the architectural
firm which designed the Stanford
Hospital's new wing, according to
Staff Counsel Cassius Kirk.
The University contends that
the design is not in accordance
with what was "anticipated," Kirk
said Tuesday. It is asking for the
compensation from the firm
Caudill Rowlett Scott because it
feels the firm is responsible for de
lays in the project and particular
problems in the building, Kirk said.
Construction was to be com
pleted this month and the first pa
tients were to be admitted to the
wing early in July.
An April inspection by 16 fed
eral state and local agencies un
covered 50 to 60 construction er
rors which must be corrected be
fore the facility can open.
A tentative schedule prepared
by the Planning Office now pre
dicts a September completion
date and an operational date of
Nov. 1. Director of Planning Phil
Williams said that these dates are
tentative. It may be December be
fore patients use the facility.
Inadequacies
Among the problems being cor
rected are:
—bathrooms which lack
facilities for the handicapped;
—a few sprinkler heads which
hang too low into hallways;
—inadequate labeling of fire
doors and exists; and
—inadequate fire-proofing in
some hallways.
The building's budget includes
a contingency fund of $400,000,
according to Senior Planner
James Brenner, "which we hope
will cover the corrective steps
necessary."

One mistake which he says is
too expensive to correct is that the
elevators in the one wing are not
large enough to hold any of the 25
new intensive care beds.
The gurneys used to transport
most patients will fit into the
elevators but intensive care pa
tients will be wheeled through a
corridor to the old building's
elevators.
Controversial ramp
Thus intensive care patients will
be transported down a controver

sial ramp joining the two buildings,
which some doctors say is
dangerous.
Transfering intensive care pa
tients between floors is not
routine, according to several
sources but does occur and would
be the means of escape used in
an emergency.
One of the inspectors who
examined the building in April said
that the mistakes were made in
the planning of the building, not its
execution.
"The contractors have done a
beautiful job. The problems are in
the design of the place," the in
spector said.
According to Williams, the ar
chitectural firm worked directly
with the staff at the hospital and

produced the design and specifi
cations for the building. In addi
tion, a project representative did
supervise the actual construction.
The project was reviewed by
the planning office, which acted as
project manager, along with other
University departments, including
hospital officials, Williams said.
Although the final authority for
the project rested with the Board
of Trustees, the planning office
gave initial approval to proceed,
he added.
The architect is relied upon to
comply with the various codes,
Kirk said. The planning staff is
"not necessarily expert" on build
ing codes, he said.
Kirk added that the
backcharges would include all
items found to be in violation of
statutes or construction codes. He
refused to announce the exact
amount being sought.
Hiring for the wing has been put
into a "holding pattern," according
to Hospital Director Paul Hof
mann. As many as 250 persons
will be hired for the building; ap
proximately half of them will be
nurses.
A program for recruiting nurses
had been in operation, but "less
than 20 percent" have already
been hired, he said.
Hofmann indicated that the
wing's late opening will create "no
srious problems" with hiring, since
the nurses already hired to staff
the new wing can be used to tem
porarily fill normal turn-over vac
ancies in the hospital.
"We intend to fulfill all commit
ments," he said.
