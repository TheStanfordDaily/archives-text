## Backcharges asked for hospital addition 
### Dave Ansley Last of two parts 
The University has sent a claim
for "a substantial amount" of
"backcharges" to the architectural
firm which designed the Stanford
Hospital's new wing, according to
Staff Counsel Cassius Kirk.
The University contends that
the design is not in accordance
with what was "anticipated," Kirk
said Tuesday. It is asking for the
compensation from the firm
Caudill Rowlett Scott because it
feels the firm is responsible for de
lays in the project and particular
problems in the building, Kirk said.
Construction was to be com
pleted this month and the first pa
tients were to be admitted to the
wing early in July.
An April inspection by 16 fed
eral state and local agencies un
covered 50 to 60 construction er

A tentative schedule prepared
by the Planning Office now pre

date and an operational date of
Nov. 1. Director of Planning Phil
Williams said that these dates are
tentative. It may be December be
fore patients use the facility.

Among the problems being cor

—bathrooms which lack
facilities for the handicapped;
—a few sprinkler heads which
hang too low into hallways;
—inadequate labeling of fire
doors and exists; and
—inadequate fire-proofing in
some hallways.
The building's budget includes
a contingency fund of $400,000,
according to Senior Planner
James Brenner, "which we hope
will cover the corrective steps
necessary."

One mistake which he says is
too expensive to correct is that the
elevators in the one wing are not
large enough to hold any of the 25
new intensive care beds.
The gurneys used to transport
most patients will fit into the
elevators but intensive care pa
tients will be wheeled through a
corridor to the old building's
elevators.
