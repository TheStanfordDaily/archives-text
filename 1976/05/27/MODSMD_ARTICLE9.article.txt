# Columnist Kilpatrick:
## Daily newspaper in trouble 
### Mark Shibuya 
"The daily newspaper is in trou
ble," syndicated columnist James
Kilpatrick said Tuesday night in
Kresge Auditorium.
"The daily newspaper is in peril
from the courts, in peril from tele
vision, in peril from the consequ
ences of the educational system
and in peril from the things we
journalists have failed to do," he
said.
Kilpatrick. who is the 1976 Kate
Herrick Maddox distinguished lec
turer in professional journalism
and a regular commentator on the
CBS news program Sixty Mi
nutes, read a list of newspapers
which are being prosecuted for
gag rule violations.
"The question is do the courts
have the power, under the con
stitution, to enjoin publication, to
impose prior retstraint?' My posi
tion, and I think the position of
every professional newspaper
man. is no," he said.
"In gag rules and prior restraint.

judges are saying 'thou shalt not
print or I will send you to jail,' " he
said. "In this pernicious doctrine
we face the oligarchical rule of
judges."
Turning to television, Kiloatrick
lamented the increasing "percen
tage of the total advertising dollar
that is seeping away from the

printed media to the television
medium."
"The third peril," said Kilpat
rick, "is that we're in peril from the
educational system of the last 25
years."
He linked declining reading
skills and "an indifference to liter
ary values and to reading to the
advent of television. "We have
grown up a generation, that is
satisfied to get its intellectual
stimulation from the boob tube,"
he said.
Kilpatrick claimed that Ameri
can journalists have failed in their
"primary job which is to sell the
people of a free country on the
importance of a free press."
He charged that journalists
have allowed themselves to be
come "participants" and celeb
rities," noting that "there is a
widespread feeling among the
people of the United States that
we have grown too big for our
britches. We are not popular."
