## Soviets to admit U.S. inspectors to nuclear test sites 
### 
WASHINGTON (AF) — President Gerald Ford and
Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev will sign an unpre
cedented agreement today to permit American inspection
of some Russian nuclear testing sites.
The twin ceremonies here and in Moscow close out 18
months of complex negotiations to limit peaceful under
ground testing and clear the way for Senate ratification of
a parallel treaty restricting weapons tests.
Neither power will he permitted to conduct under
ground nuclear explosions exceeding 150 kilotons — the
equivalent of 150,000 tons of TNT. Also, for the first time,
American and Russian observers will be on hand to check
for violations.
Barred inspections
Until now, the Russians have been steadfast in barring
any inspection on Soviet soil. Under the agreement to be
signed here by Ford and in Moscow by Brezhnev, the
observers will be allowed to check only on tests designed
for peaceful purposes.
Still, the accord, projected two years ago at the Moscow
summit, is of major significance since it both establishes
the precedent of foreign inspection and comes at a time of
strain in U.S.-Soviet relations.
Negotiations arc lagging in Geneva on an agreement to
impose ceilings on the two superpowers' nuclear
weapons arsenals. The two sides have exchanged sharp
rhetoric over Africa and over compliance with arms and
security accords.
Little meaning
While establishing the principle of on-site inspection,
the treaty appears to have little practical meaning for the
United States.
Years ago American scientists gave up the idea of exper
imenting with underground nuclear explosions as a
means for changing the course of rivers or for mineral
excavations. But the Soviets remained (interested in such
projects.
Terms of the treaty permit that work may go forward,
provided no blast exceeds 150 kilotons. A series of explo
sions may total up to 1500 kilotons — provided they are
spaced no more than five seconds apart.
Technical reasons
The treaty actually was completed early last month.
White House and State Department officials said that
"technical reasons" caused the delay in the signing and
denied that political considerations played any part.
Privately, administration sources said the signing was
delayed after Ford's advisers told him it would be politi
cally damaging to sign a treaty with the Russians just
before the Michigan primary.
In competing for the GOP presidential nomination
Ronald Reagan has attacked Ford's policy toward the
Soviet Union.
