Presidential
Democrat — Morris Udall
We endorse Arizona Rep. Morris Udall
for the Democratic Presidential nomina
tion. In his 15 years in the House, and
five months of campaigning, Udall has
shown himself to be a man of great integ
rity.
Udall has become a leader of liberal
House Democrats in efforts to pass en
vironmental regulations and reform the
internal procedures of the House. He
has, during the campaign, taken firm
stands on issues — for amnesty, against
strip mining and for Democratic
supported full employment measures.
Udall has campaigned hard and with
humor against the righteous anti-
Washington fervor of Jimmy Carter.
While newcomers Frank Church and
Jerry Brown may share most of Udall's
positions, we believe the Democratic
nomination should go to a man who has
proven his integrity during the long
primary road, and not to a new entrant
hoping for a brokered convention.
Republican — Gerald Ford
We endorse President Gerald Ford in
his bid to take the California Republican
presidential primary. While Ford's per
formance in office has scarcely been
spectacular, his opponent (Ronald
Reagan) has dangerous views.
Reagan's bellicose attitude toward the
delicate situation in Panama is a case in
point. Ford's "move to the Right" in
mimicking Reagan's opinions on this
and other issues is unfortunate; perhaps
a big win in California would allow Ford
to take the more moderate stances he has
previously advocated.
Senatorial
Democrat — Tom Hayden
We endorse challenger Tom Hayden
for the Democratic Senatorial nomina
tion. Hayden is by no means a dangerous
radical, as he has been painted, nor even
a socialist.
Hayden is, however, opposed to cor
porate tax breaks and U.S. armed inter
vention in Africa or Panama. He strikes
us as a man who has thought about the
issues and is willing to work tirelessly to
implement legislation.
While not totally agreeing with
Hayden, we think it would be good to
have a man of his background (as an an
tiwar movement leader), intelligence
and drive in the Senate.
Republican — Robert Finch
We endorse Robert Finch for the Re
publican nomination to the U.S. Senate
because we believe that he is the most
qualified Republican candidate for the
office. He has served as U.S. Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare and as
Lieutenant Governor of California and
has distinguished himself in these posts.
Representative
Democrat — David Harris
We endorse David Harris for the
Democratic nomination in the 12th Con
gressional District because of his fine re
cord as a student leader and political
activist. Harris has backed up his politi
cal beliefs with actions beginning with
his refusal to participate in U.S. inter
vention in Vietnam to his involvement
with the fight for civil rights in Missis
sippi.
Republican — Paul N. McCloskey
We endorse Rep. Paul N. McCloskey
Jr. (R-Menlo Park) for the Republican
nomination in the 12th Congressional
District because McCloskey has shown
himself an effective legislator. McClos
key has gone to bat for Stanford causes
many times in his congressional career
and he is sensitive to student concerns.
PA Municipal Judge
Richard Such
We endorse challenger Richard Such
for the seat on the Palo Alto Municipal
Court bench. Such, a young public de
fender, offers an impressive platform,
which states that he would try to im
prove the muddled probation system. He
has obviously thought about issues ever
since he was here leading efforts to
reform the campus judicial system.
State propositions
Proposition 1 — Yes
This measure provides for a bpnd

issue of $200 million to provide capital
outlay for much-needed construction
and improvement of public schools
faciliies.
Proposition 2 — Yes
The Veterans Bond Act of 1976 would
provide for a bond issue of $500 million
to provide farm and home aid for
California veterans.
Proposition 3 — Yes
This proposition, entitled the
"California Safe Drinking Water Bond
Law of 1976," will provide for a
$175 million bond issue to provide
money for improvement of domestic
water systems in order to meet minimum
drinking water standards.
Proposition 4 — Yes
This measure would provide a bond
issue of $150 million to assist local pub- ,
lie community colleges to fund build- <
ings related to growth requirements.
Proposition 5 — Yes
This legislative constitutional
amendment would reduce from two
thirds to a majority vote of each house of
the Legislature, the requirements to
change state tax laws on banks and cor
poration and to change the state tax rate
on insurance companies.
Proposition 6 — Yes
This proposition, a legislative con
stitutional amendment will eliminate
the home or principal office deduction
currently available to insurance com
panies.
Proposition 7 — No
This legislative constitutional
amendment would give the Legislature
authority to define property of historical
significance, specify how such property
would have to be restricted, and require
assessors to appraise historical property
according to its restricted use rather than
its fair market value. This measure gives
the Legislature unwarranted power
to authorize tax exemptions to prop
erty.
Proposition 8 — Yes
A legislative constitutional amend
ment, this proposition allows the Legis
lature to provide for the deposit of public
moneys in any bank in the state, includ
ing savings and loan associations, which
are currently excluded.
Proposition 9 — Yes
This legislative constitutional
amendment would allow the Legislature
to authorize cities and counties to permit
bingo for charitable purposes. We be
lieve that this measure is a step in the
right direction of legalizing all gambl
ing.
Proposition 10 — Yes
This proposal would allow the Legis
lature, by a two-thirds vote of each
house, to authorize the issuance of gen
eral obligation refunding bonds without
referring each separate issue to a vote of
the people, as must currently take place.
Proposition 11 — Yes
This proposition would allow cities
and counties to use excess land, purch
ased from the state originally for road
purposes, for public park and recrea
tional areas.
Proposition 12 — Yes
This proposition would restructure
the interest rate limitation on loans by
business firms.
Proposition 13 —No
This measure would allow senior
homeowners with low or moderate in
comes to postpone payment of property
taxes on their principal place of resi
dence.
Proposition 14 — Yes
This measure will reorganize the state
constitution, but in no way will change
its substantive meaning.
Proposition 15 — Yes
The nuclear energy industry has asked
to reap all the profits of a nuclear
technology while assuming few of the
risks. The federal Price-Anderson Act
limits corporate liability in the event of
an accident to just $560 million; even the
now-defunct Atomic Energy Commis
sion conceded that damages from acci
dents could run into the billions.
We support repeal of Price-Anderson
and cannot tolerate the unchecked pro
liferation of nuclear power plants. If the
nuclear industry were to accept all its
own risks, it is very unlikely that nuclear
power would spread. State subsidizing
of what should be private risks has
placed all citizens in danger of possibly
huge losses of life and property.

has obviously thought about issues ever

reform the campus judicial system.
State propositions
Proposition 1 — Yes
This measure provides for a bpnd

issue of $200 million to provide capital
outlay for much-needed construction
and improvement of public schools
faciliies.
Proposition 2 — Yes
The Veterans Bond Act of 1976 would
provide for a bond issue of $500 million
to provide farm and home aid for
California veterans.
Proposition 3 — Yes
This proposition, entitled the
"California Safe Drinking Water Bond
Law of 1976," will provide for a
$175 million bond issue to provide
money for improvement of domestic
water systems in order to meet minimum
drinking water standards.
Proposition 4 — Yes
This measure would provide a bond
issue of $150 million to assist local pub- ,
lie community colleges to fund build- <
ings related to growth requirements.
Proposition 5 — Yes
This legislative constitutional
amendment would reduce from two
thirds to a majority vote of each house of
the Legislature, the requirements to
change state tax laws on banks and cor
poration and to change the state tax rate
on insurance companies.
Proposition 6 — Yes
This proposition, a legislative con
stitutional amendment will eliminate
the home or principal office deduction
currently available to insurance com
panies.
Proposition 7 — No
This legislative constitutional
amendment would give the Legislature
authority to define property of historical
significance, specify how such property
would have to be restricted, and require
assessors to appraise historical property
according to its restricted use rather than
its fair market value. This measure gives
the Legislature unwarranted power
to authorize tax exemptions to prop
erty.
Proposition 8 — Yes
A legislative constitutional amend
ment, this proposition allows the Legis
lature to provide for the deposit of public
moneys in any bank in the state, includ
ing savings and loan associations, which
are currently excluded.
Proposition 9 — Yes
This legislative constitutional
amendment would allow the Legislature
to authorize cities and counties to permit
bingo for charitable purposes. We be
lieve that this measure is a step in the
right direction of legalizing all gambl
ing.
Proposition 10 — Yes
This proposal would allow the Legis
lature, by a two-thirds vote of each
house, to authorize the issuance of gen
eral obligation refunding bonds without
referring each separate issue to a vote of
the people, as must currently take place.
Proposition 11 — Yes
This proposition would allow cities
and counties to use excess land, purch
ased from the state originally for road
purposes, for public park and recrea
tional areas.
Proposition 12 — Yes
This proposition would restructure
the interest rate limitation on loans by
business firms.
Proposition 13 —No
This measure would allow senior
homeowners with low or moderate in
comes to postpone payment of property
taxes on their principal place of resi
dence.
Proposition 14 — Yes
This measure will reorganize the state
constitution, but in no way will change
its substantive meaning.
Proposition 15 — Yes
The nuclear energy industry has asked
to reap all the profits of a nuclear
technology while assuming few of the
risks. The federal Price-Anderson Act
limits corporate liability in the event of
an accident to just $560 million; even the
now-defunct Atomic Energy Commis
sion conceded that damages from acci
dents could run into the billions.
We support repeal of Price-Anderson
and cannot tolerate the unchecked pro
liferation of nuclear power plants. If the
nuclear industry were to accept all its
own risks, it is very unlikely that nuclear
power would spread. State subsidizing
of what should be private risks has
placed all citizens in danger of possibly
huge losses of life and property.
Presidential
Democrat — Morris Udall
We endorse Arizona Rep. Morris Udall
for the Democratic Presidential nomina
tion. In his 15 years in the House, and
five months of campaigning, Udall has
shown himself to be a man of great integ
rity.
Udall has become a leader of liberal
House Democrats in efforts to pass en
vironmental regulations and reform the
internal procedures of the House. He
has, during the campaign, taken firm
stands on issues — for amnesty, against
strip mining and for Democratic
supported full employment measures.
Udall has campaigned hard and with
humor against the righteous anti-
Washington fervor of Jimmy Carter.
While newcomers Frank Church and
Jerry Brown may share most of Udall's
positions, we believe the Democratic
nomination should go to a man who has
proven his integrity during the long
primary road, and not to a new entrant
hoping for a brokered convention.
Republican — Gerald Ford
We endorse President Gerald Ford in
his bid to take the California Republican
presidential primary. While Ford's per
formance in office has scarcely been
spectacular, his opponent (Ronald
Reagan) has dangerous views.
Reagan's bellicose attitude toward the
delicate situation in Panama is a case in
point. Ford's "move to the Right" in
mimicking Reagan's opinions on this
and other issues is unfortunate; perhaps
a big win in California would allow Ford
to take the more moderate stances he has
previously advocated.
Senatorial
Democrat — Tom Hayden
We endorse challenger Tom Hayden
for the Democratic Senatorial nomina
tion. Hayden is by no means a dangerous
radical, as he has been painted, nor even
a socialist.
Hayden is, however, opposed to cor
porate tax breaks and U.S. armed inter
vention in Africa or Panama. He strikes
us as a man who has thought about the
issues and is willing to work tirelessly to
implement legislation.
While not totally agreeing with
Hayden, we think it would be good to
have a man of his background (as an an
tiwar movement leader), intelligence
and drive in the Senate.
Republican — Robert Finch
We endorse Robert Finch for the Re
publican nomination to the U.S. Senate
because we believe that he is the most
qualified Republican candidate for the
office. He has served as U.S. Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare and as
Lieutenant Governor of California and
has distinguished himself in these posts.
Representative
Democrat — David Harris
We endorse David Harris for the
Democratic nomination in the 12th Con
gressional District because of his fine re
cord as a student leader and political
activist. Harris has backed up his politi
cal beliefs with actions beginning with
his refusal to participate in U.S. inter
vention in Vietnam to his involvement
with the fight for civil rights in Missis
sippi.
Republican — Paul N. McCloskey
We endorse Rep. Paul N. McCloskey
Jr. (R-Menlo Park) for the Republican
nomination in the 12th Congressional
District because McCloskey has shown
himself an effective legislator. McClos
key has gone to bat for Stanford causes
many times in his congressional career
and he is sensitive to student concerns.
PA Municipal Judge
Richard Such
We endorse challenger Richard Such
for the seat on the Palo Alto Municipal
Court bench. Such, a young public de

has obviously thought about issues ever
since he was here leading efforts to

limits corporate liability in the event of
an accident to just $560 million; even the
now-defunct Atomic Energy Commis
sion conceded that damages from acci
dents could run into the billions.
We support repeal of Price-Anderson
and cannot tolerate the unchecked pro
liferation of nuclear power plants. If the
nuclear industry were to accept all its
own risks, it is very unlikely that nuclear
power would spread. State subsidizing
of what should be private risks has
placed all citizens in danger of possibly
huge losses of life and property.
Presidential
Democrat — Morris Udall
We endorse Arizona Rep. Morris Udall
for the Democratic Presidential nomina
tion. In his 15 years in the House, and
five months of campaigning, Udall has
shown himself to be a man of great integ
rity.
Udall has become a leader of liberal
House Democrats in efforts to pass en
vironmental regulations and reform the
internal procedures of the House. He
has, during the campaign, taken firm
stands on issues — for amnesty, against
strip mining and for Democratic
supported full employment measures.
Udall has campaigned hard and with
humor against the righteous anti-
Washington fervor of Jimmy Carter.
While newcomers Frank Church and
Jerry Brown may share most of Udall's
positions, we believe the Democratic
nomination should go to a man who has
proven his integrity during the long
primary road, and not to a new entrant
hoping for a brokered convention.
Republican — Gerald Ford
We endorse President Gerald Ford in
his bid to take the California Republican
presidential primary. While Ford's per
formance in office has scarcely been
spectacular, his opponent (Ronald
Reagan) has dangerous views.
Reagan's bellicose attitude toward the
delicate situation in Panama is a case in
point. Ford's "move to the Right" in
mimicking Reagan's opinions on this
and other issues is unfortunate; perhaps
a big win in California would allow Ford
to take the more moderate stances he has
previously advocated.
Senatorial
Democrat — Tom Hayden
We endorse challenger Tom Hayden
for the Democratic Senatorial nomina
tion. Hayden is by no means a dangerous
radical, as he has been painted, nor even
a socialist.
Hayden is, however, opposed to cor
porate tax breaks and U.S. armed inter
vention in Africa or Panama. He strikes
us as a man who has thought about the
issues and is willing to work tirelessly to
implement legislation.
While not totally agreeing with
Hayden, we think it would be good to
have a man of his background (as an an
tiwar movement leader), intelligence
and drive in the Senate.
Republican — Robert Finch
We endorse Robert Finch for the Re
publican nomination to the U.S. Senate
because we believe that he is the most
qualified Republican candidate for the
office. He has served as U.S. Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare and as
Lieutenant Governor of California and
has distinguished himself in these posts.
Representative
Democrat — David Harris
We endorse David Harris for the
Democratic nomination in the 12th Con
gressional District because of his fine re
cord as a student leader and political
activist. Harris has backed up his politi
cal beliefs with actions beginning with
his refusal to participate in U.S. inter
vention in Vietnam to his involvement
with the fight for civil rights in Missis
sippi.
Republican — Paul N. McCloskey
We endorse Rep. Paul N. McCloskey
Jr. (R-Menlo Park) for the Republican
nomination in the 12th Congressional
District because McCloskey has shown
himself an effective legislator. McClos
key has gone to bat for Stanford causes
many times in his congressional career
and he is sensitive to student concerns.
PA Municipal Judge
Richard Such
We endorse challenger Richard Such
for the seat on the Palo Alto Municipal
Court bench. Such, a young public de
fender, offers an impressive platform,
which states that he would try to im
prove the muddled probation system. He
has obviously thought about issues ever
since he was here leading efforts to
reform the campus judicial system.

its substantive meaning.
Proposition 15 — Yes
The nuclear energy industry has asked
