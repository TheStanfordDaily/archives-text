# Prof evaluation needs student input
## 
### 
Johnson, Coughlan, et al.

The economics faculty meets today to
consider resolutions adopted by students
on May 20 addressing the failure of the de
partment to offer tenure to Prof. Duncan
Foley and the need for increased student
participation in departmental decision
making.
While it is apparent from the widespread
support of the boycott of economics classes
that the faculty misjudged student opinion
in the Foley tenure decision, students do
not realize how easy it is for faculty to mis
judge student evaluation of teaching.
In the Economics Department, student
course evaluations are kept secret from stu
dents and potentially from faculty as well.
Only the course evaluations which indi
vidual faculty teachers choose to place in
their files are reviewed by the department in
tenure decisions. Other information availa
ble on teaching are letters from the profes
sor's graduate advisees, unsolicited letters,
and faculty observations.
Faculty observation is likely to be in
adequate. They rarely attend the candi
date's classes so they only have shared
seminar experiences upon which to person
ally evaluate teaching.
The faculty can and should evaluate re
search first-hand. They can also draw upon
other economists outside the University to
obtain assessments of the candidate's re
search. But almost all of the information
obtained on teaching is indirect.

The faculty realize the inadequacy of pre
sent procedures on the evaluation of teach
ing, and it is therefore understandable that
they give it little weight. The only way to
resolve this is to have students participate
as regular members on all tenure and search
committees.
The student stake in the quality of faculty
here is beyond doubt. Yet the present pro
cedures to obtain student input are clearly
inadequate to achieve their professed goals.
Moreover, once decisions have been made
that adversely affect the quality of teaching,
students have no formal grievance proce
dures open to them to seek a remedy.
Procedures used to evaluate research are
also evidently in need of revision. Prior to
the meeting of the senior faculty to decide
on the question of tenure, a faculty tenure
committee undertakes a critical review of
the candidate's research, solicits evalua
tions of the candidate from economists
ouside the University and reviews available
data on teaching.
Presently, faculty within the department
who wish to raise important questions on
the candidate's record are not asked to pre
sent such questions to the tenure committee
This leads to the possibility of confusion at
the faculty meeting itself over factual mat
ters which could easily be cleared up be
forehand. The faculty meeting is the place
to weigh the evidence, not to introduce new
evidence or raise fundamental objections to
the evaluation committee's report.

Current tenure decision procedures im
pair responsible evaluation of both teaching
and research. But even if these failings are
remedied, the potential for political dis
crimination remains.
In the past here, any record of the applica
tion of Marxian economic methodology to a
field of inquiry in economics has biased fa
culty appointment decisions and raised
problems of academic freedom. The recent
use of a Marxian analytic approach by Foley
has served to erase the merit of his highly
significant prior research on mic
roeconomics and monetary theory utilizing
neoclassical economic methodology.
Moreover the decision to reappoint Foley
rather than to decide on tenure can reasona
bly be interpreted to mean faculty who op
pose him for tenure aim to insure confor
mity in his future research and teaching to
their own preferred analytic approach if he
is to win their support.
The responsibility lies with the
economics faculty to demonstrate that polit
ical discrimination did not occur, as such
questions have arisen. Admittedly,
academic freedom is not easy to secure, but
it does a disservice to the University com
munity to turn away from the very signific
ant problems that do exist.
