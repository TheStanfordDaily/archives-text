Not demanding action
I am writing in an attempt to
clear up an apparent misun
derstanding. I would like to state
emphatically that the Beta
House is not demanding any ac
tion be taken against the indi
viduals who entered our house
and proceeded to "trash" it. If
any prosecution comes as a re
sult of the events which occur
red May 19 it will be the matter
of the appropriate deans, attor
neys and the SJC.
Personally, I would be disap
pointed to see the Delt House
thrown off campus. If the frater
nity system here is to remain
healthy, all the member houses
must be viable, including Delta
Tau Delta. I believe that if the
University is looking for a deter
rent to similar, future actions,
dealing with individuals on a
personal basis should more than
suffice; collective action against
the house would only serve to
create unnecessary hard feel
ings.
Finally, I would like todefend
the actions of newly elected
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
President Jordan Schwartz. He
did try to make amends im
mediately after the incident and
he did subject himself to hostile
questioning by Beta House
members.
Although some may call me
naive, I believe that the Beta
House will not have to suffer
through another Delt "foot
patrol."
Hopefully summer break will
give both us and the Delts an op
portunity to realize that it is time
to put ill-feelings aside the work
toward the betterment of the
fraternity system.

Speaking for ourselves as of
ficers of the Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC), we implore offi
cials of the University to recon
sider yesterday's action sus
pending Delta Tau Delta from
campus for three years.
We make the request on four
grounds:
1. Any complaints against in
dividuals reportedly involved in
the "trashings" of last week have
been dropped by the alleged vic
tims.
2. The Delts themselves have
taken extremely swift and sure
punitive actions against mem

bers reportedly involved in the
activities.
3. The damage done last week,
which amounted to less than
$150, was committed by indi
viduals, some of whom happen
to be Delts, some of whom don't.
We see no clear evidence that the
actions of these individuals re
sulted from the existence of
Delta Tau Delta on campus.
4. The length of the suspen
sion will effectively destroy the
fraternity chapter.
We contest Assoc. Dean of Re
sidential Education Larry Hor
ton's claim that the Delts are a
"blemish" on the fraternity sys
tem here. The house regularly
holds parties open to the entire
campus which frequently serve
to assist the athl(?tic department
in recruiting efforts.
Delt membership includes the
IFC president, an ASSU senator,
staffers at KZSU and members
of several University commit
tees, as well as numerous varsity
athletes.
The actions taken by the Delts
to punish their own members are
unprecedented in recent Stan
ford fraternity history.
Three members have been ex
pelled from the fraternity, three
others have been fined $125, and
all others who were simply pre
sent at the May 19 incident have
been fined $50. All those fined
will be automatically expelled if
involved inany futureincidents.
Additionally, all members liv
ing in the house next year would
be required to post a bond which
would be forfeited at the
slightest hint of their involve
ment in illegal acts.
No such actions, to our know
ledge, were taken three years ago
when the Delts were suspended
for one year. Thus we are not
being asked to travel "down the
same road" again, as Uorton has
claimed.
We condemn acts of violence
against persons and property at
the University. And judging by
the actions it has already taken,
so does Delta Tau Delta.

Earthquake aid
Shortly after the tragic ear
thquakes in Guatemala this past
February, the three Guatemalan
students here mobilized them
selves into an ad hoc group to
raise relief funds within the
University community. As a re

sult of their untiring efforts and
efficient procedures, more than
$8000 was collected from stu
dents, faculty, staff and alumni.
These funds have been for
warded to the Committee for the
Relief of Guatemala, a San
Francisco-based organization
which has channeled our con
tributions to institutions such as
medical clinics and schools, to
assist in the reconstruction pro
cess.
On Tuesday evening, June 1,
at 7:30 p.m. at the International
Center, a slide presentation of
earthquake relief and recon
struction activities will show
those of us who contributed how
our donations are being used.
All interested persons are in
vited.
I wish to thank not only Sergio
Aragon, Eduardo Navas and
Juan Maegli, but all those who
helped in the fund drive and
who gave so generously. Our li
mited resources and desire not to
spend any of the funds received
on local overhead prevented our
sending personal replies of
thanks to the many contributors
throughout the campus.

Always an issue
Heading the article in the
Daily May 26 concerning Rich
ard Lyman's statement to the
University community concern
ing the human rights rally made
me stop to speculate a moment.
One is forced to wonder some
times whether the issue that is
supposedly uppermost is always
what's really uppermost in
people's minds. The issues may
be very different, but the coali
tion that lines up bears a remark
able resemblance to the preced
ing year's coalition.
I'm not trying to see that
there's any kind of conspiracy or
anything, but the administration
acts in such a manner that since
the issues vary so much from
year to year, one is led to a cer
tain expectation that, without
knowing what the issue will be,
there will be one.

P.S. Many thanks to the Prez. for
helping me to find the words.
