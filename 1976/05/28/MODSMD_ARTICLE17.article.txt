# Davis, biochemistry prof, receives Lilly award

### Phyllis Amabile 
Ronald W. Davis, assistant
professor of biochemistry at the
School of Medicine, is the 1976
recipient of the Eli Lilly and
Company Award in Microbiol
ogy and Immunology.
Davis, who has done research
in physical genetics and electron
microscopy, received a medall
ion, $1000 and expenses to the
annual meeting of the American
Society for Microbiology (ASM).
The award is given by the
Indiana-based Lilly pharmaceut
ical company each year to a
young scientist whose research
is judged innovative and prom
ising.
Davis was raised in Maroa, 111.,
and received his undergraduate
education at Eastern Illinois
University. Erom 1964 to 1970,
he attended the California Insti
tute of Technology, where he
had a National Institute of
Health (NIH} Predoctoral
Traineeship.
Grad student
While a graduate student,
Davis independently developed
the electron microscope
hetero-duplex method, which
has become an important proce
dure for investigating sequence
relations of nucleic acids (RNA
and the genetic material DNA).
Jill Eerguson, a graduate stu
dent in biochemistry, and David
Benton, a visiting graduate stu
dent from the University of Min
nesota, have both worked
closely with Davis.
In explaining his technique,

they first describe the structure
of the DNA molecule as a double
helix "spiral staircase" held to
gether by hydrogen bonds. Nor
mally, the two strands are iden
tical. or 100 percent "homolog
ous." All bases in the two
strands are perfectly paired.
Davis' technique involves the
creation of "heteroduplex"
molecules, consisting of two un
ited strands of DNA from two
different organisms. When these
molecules are examined under
the electron microscope, the
strands are perfectly joined
where bases are identical. Where
the bases are not identical, loops
or "bubbles" appear.
Melting process
The extent to which the bases
in the new DNA molecule are
matched (its "percentage of
sequence homology") is then de
termined in a melting process.
The temperature at which a
molecule melts (breaks apart)
depends upon its degree of
homology. The higher the per
centage of identical base pairing,
the higher the temperature
needed to melt the molecule.
In 1971, Davis came here as an
assistant professor in the De
partment of Biochemistry,
where he began his work on gene
manipulation in vitro (outside
the organism). His research in
volves the artificial rearrange
ments of fragments of DNA that
have been cleaved by certain en
zymes.
Often the new fragments of

DNA are "viable," or able to re
produce. The viable, recon
structed DNA molecules are
grown in large numbers and
mounted for electron micros
copy so that the contours of vari
ous regions of the new
molecules can be carefully mea
sured.
One of the most unusual out
comes of these studies is the
construction of a strand of gene
tic material that can multiply
only if it has incorporated a
foreign segment of DNA. This
type of work has opened a new
field of biochemical and genetic
research.
Gene manipulation
Methods of gene manipula
tion are applied to genetic en
gineering in plant as well as in
animal organisms. A naturally
occurring mutation qt a laborat
ory "rearrangement" of genetic
material in a fruit or vegetable
plant might result in a species
that could, for example, produce
a higher percentage of its nut
rient requirements.
Presently a large amount of the
world's petroleum is used in the
production of fertilizers. More
"self-sufficient" crops would
mean a lower demand for synth
etic fertilizers and less of a drain
on petroleum reserves.
Aside from his research,
Davis' work here includes teach
ing part of a graduate course in
biochemistry and various semi
nars. He and his wife, Janet
Dafoe, a graduate student in
psychology, are backpackers
and cross-country skiers.

production of fertilizers. More
"self-sufficient" crops would
mean a lower demand for synth

on petroleum reserves.
Aside from his research,
Davis' work here includes teach

biochemistry and various semi

Ronald W. Davis, assistant
professor of biochemistry at the
School of Medicine, is the 1976
recipient of the Eli Lilly and
Company Award in Microbiol
ogy and Immunology.
Davis, who has done research
in physical genetics and electron
microscopy, received a medall
ion, $1000 and expenses to the
annual meeting of the American
Society for Microbiology (ASM).
The award is given by the
Indiana-based Lilly pharmaceut
ical company each year to a
young scientist whose research
is judged innovative and prom
ising.
Davis was raised in Maroa, 111.,
and received his undergraduate
education at Eastern Illinois
University. Erom 1964 to 1970,
he attended the California Insti
tute of Technology, where he
had a National Institute of
Health (NIH} Predoctoral
Traineeship.
Grad student
While a graduate student,
Davis independently developed
the electron microscope
hetero-duplex method, which
has become an important proce
dure for investigating sequence
relations of nucleic acids (RNA
and the genetic material DNA).
Jill Eerguson, a graduate stu
dent in biochemistry, and David
Benton, a visiting graduate stu
dent from the University of Min
nesota, have both worked
closely with Davis.
In explaining his technique,

they first describe the structure
of the DNA molecule as a double
helix "spiral staircase" held to
gether by hydrogen bonds. Nor
mally, the two strands are iden
tical. or 100 percent "homolog
ous." All bases in the two
strands are perfectly paired.
Davis' technique involves the
creation of "heteroduplex"
molecules, consisting of two un
ited strands of DNA from two
different organisms. When these
molecules are examined under
the electron microscope, the
strands are perfectly joined
where bases are identical. Where
the bases are not identical, loops
or "bubbles" appear.
Melting process
The extent to which the bases
in the new DNA molecule are
matched (its "percentage of
sequence homology") is then de
termined in a melting process.
The temperature at which a
molecule melts (breaks apart)
depends upon its degree of
homology. The higher the per
centage of identical base pairing,
the higher the temperature
needed to melt the molecule.
In 1971, Davis came here as an
assistant professor in the De
partment of Biochemistry,
where he began his work on gene
manipulation in vitro (outside
the organism). His research in
volves the artificial rearrange
ments of fragments of DNA that
have been cleaved by certain en
zymes.
Often the new fragments of

DNA are "viable," or able to re
produce. The viable, recon
structed DNA molecules are
grown in large numbers and
mounted for electron micros
copy so that the contours of vari
ous regions of the new
molecules can be carefully mea
sured.
One of the most unusual out
comes of these studies is the
construction of a strand of gene
tic material that can multiply
only if it has incorporated a
foreign segment of DNA. This
type of work has opened a new
field of biochemical and genetic
research.
Gene manipulation
Methods of gene manipula
tion are applied to genetic en
gineering in plant as well as in
animal organisms. A naturally
occurring mutation qt a laborat
ory "rearrangement" of genetic
material in a fruit or vegetable
plant might result in a species
that could, for example, produce
a higher percentage of its nut
rient requirements.
