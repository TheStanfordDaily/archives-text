# New ASSU financier
## Mathe views position of manager 
### Lori Matsukawa 
"1 just sort of fell into business school,"
said future ASSU Financial Manager Chris
Mathe. However, the first year business
school student seems to have no fear of
falling out of his new position, a position
he finds "intriguing."
Mathe officially becomes the financial
manager on June 13 when current man
ager Chris Cline graduates. Mathe will
work full-time throughout the summer
and part-time throughout next year.
An early triumph for Mathe was his re
cently released 1976-77 ASSU projected
budget of $88,884, $7575 less than this
year's budget.
Slicing
Mathe admits to doing a lot of adminis
trative account slicing.
"For example, this office was budgeted
for $1800. We cut it down to $800, 1 don't
need that much in my administrative ac
count."
"I don't see the financial manager's role
as merely an investor of funds," said
Mathe, who received his undergraduate
degrees in political science and
economics at Occidental College.
"My role is to make things run here . . .
to keep the projects going. We're here to
give as much service to others as possi
ble."
When asked what sort of investment
role he would play, Mathe said, "We're not
looking for greater, aggressive earnings.
When you do that, you run risks and the
school tends to look down on that."
"The money is here to keep projects go
ing, not to make big bucks," he added.
Stocks and bonds
Mathe explained that half of the ASSU's
stocks and bonds will be invested into a
University endowment fund (merge pool
B) "as early as this summer." The rest of

the ASSU's investment portfolio will be
invested in a Wells Fargo index fund.
"This way. we'll have good returns, the
management fees are low and we know
(the investments) will be well-managed,"
said Mathe.
Earlier this year, the ASSIJ senate voi
ced fear at having ASSU funds handled by
"professional" companies. Mathe replied
that the ASSU Investments Committee, set
up this quarter by Cline and composed of
the University director of finance, the as
sistant director of students, the two finan
cial managers, a student representative to
the trustee committee on investments and
a student-at-large, will decide how the
ASSU funds will be invested.
"It works like a mutual fund," said
Mathe. The actual picking of stocks and
bonds is left to experts, he said.
Mathe, who is currently on a George F.
Baker scholarship, says he is currently "ty
ing down the loose ends" of the proposed
T-shirt embossing service for next year.
He is writing a report to be sent to Asst.
Dean of Students Thom Massey showing
that the service would be "within the
bounds of the ASSU academic services
policy."
"We can possibly offer embossed shirts
for fifty or sixty cents less than outside
retailers," said Mathe.
Asked about the possibility of lowering
Sunday Flicks admission, Mathe gave an
emphatic "yes!"
"If we keep on making profits next year
like we did this year, we may even lower
the general admission prices," he said.
Lecture notes
"Lecture notes will be expanding. We
plan to cover over 20 classes next year
with no increase in price or decrease in

quality," Mathe said.
Mathe was slightly hesitant about the
special events project, which, as of last
quarter, showed a net contribution to re
serve of only $90.45.
"Special Events is such a volatile de
partment. Some years it does well, some
years not. It does look like we'll be having
a good summer," said Mathe, who pre
dicted a few "good draw" concerts.
'Superstar'
Cline said Mathe is a "superstar" and
expects that he will do a good job for the
ASSU. "We wouldn't have chosen him
otherwise," said Cline.
Cline himself feels his year as financial
manager was a "tremendous learning ex
perience."
"I'm most happy about the convening of
the Investments Committee," said Cline,
who plans to work with King Productions
after graduation. King productions is
owned by Billie Jean King.
"We're taking an in-depth look at the
long term financial security of the ASSU.
We want to learn how to predict the cash
flow in and out of the ASSU in the future."
Cline cited a few project setbacks such
as some loss of funds by the travel service
during the airlines strike and the "un
realized income generating potential" of
special events.
"But, I am happy that we will be able to
deal with next year's budget problem,"
said Cline. The ASSU funds have been re
duced by the Dean of Student Affairs Of
fice by about $42,000. "Through the coop
eration with the Dean of Student Affairs
Office, we will be able to maintain our
programs with very little change in terms
of student expense," he commented.
