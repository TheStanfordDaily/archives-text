### 
REDDING (AP) â€” Cherie Dar
vell insisted yesterday that her
Story of abduction at the hands of
a hairy ape-like monster is au
thentic and she is willing to
submit to a lie detector test to
help prove it.
Darvell, 23, said in an inter
view, however, that she could
remember little of the weekend
incident. But she reaffirmed that
she had been carried away
Saturday by a legendary creature
called Bigfoot who apparently
abandoned her unharmed

shortly thereafter.
She said she stumbled around
the wilderness until Monday
night.
The woman, who was part of a
film crew attempting to get shots
of the creature, said she and a
friend were scattering marsh
mallows in a clearing on a hill
in dense woods near Eureka
when she suddenly saw "a big
black beast."
She said her friend, Kathi
Bush, 19, was knocked down the
hill,and she was scooped up by
the beast. She passed out in fear
but woke up during the night,
alone, somewhere in the forest.
"1 don't think it meant to hurt
me at all," Darvell told a repor
ter. "It could have if it had
wanted to."
The woman said she never got
a good look at the creature's face.
"It was iust hie and hairv."

Humboldt County Sheriff
Gene Cox has disputed Darvell's
story and has threatened to press
charges if he can prove it was a
hoax.
Cox said the woman was wear
ing fresh perfume and clean
clothes when she turned up at a
rural resort Monday night-,
screaming hysterically.
Darvell speculated that the
perfume of a woman who had
held her close to calm her at the
resort had rubbed off on her. "I
smelted bad, let me tell you," she
said testily.
She also insisted that her
clothes were slightly soiled,
suggesting that the carpet of
leaves in the forest prevented her
from getting very dirty.
Darvell said she wandered
aimlessly for a day and a night in
the northern California woods
before she found a highway.
"Nobody would pick me up."
she comolained. She said she

walked until she came to the
lodge. .
The sheriff said earlier in the
week that Darvell had refused to
take a polygraph test. But she
said yesterday that she had vol
unteered to take one and her
suggestion was turned down.
Cox was not available for
comment on her report.
Darvell was interviewed at ,i
friend's home in Redding by the
Redding Record-Searchlight.
