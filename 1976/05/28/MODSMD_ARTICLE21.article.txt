STANFORD (AP) â€” The heart of a teen-aged
boy fatally injured in California's worst school
bus crash has given new hope for life to a 33-
year-old New York man in a transplant operation
at Stanford Medical Center.
Daniel Wright, 15, was on the bus carrying
Yuba City High School choir members when it
careened through a freeway offramp guardrail last
Friday near Martinez and landed upside down 30
feet below. Twenty-seven students and a teacher
died the same day. Wright died last Monday.
Alameda County coroner's deputy Kenneth
Pollard confirmed that the body of Wright, whose
father is a physician, was taken to Stanford Medi
cal Center soon after his death. His vital organs
were kept functioning with mechanical aids.

Stanford officials do not release information on
heart donors but confirmed that a transplant took
place in a lengthy operation Tuesday.
The recipient was described as a New York re
sident who had spent some time in Israel before
returning to the United States.
In addition to his heart, young Wright's kidneys
and corneas were also used in transplant opera
tions before his body was returned to Oakland for
an autopsy. Pollard said.
Twenty-three other students and driver Evan
Prothero were injured in the disaster. Yester
day.the injured students were considered out of
immediate danger. Prothero, 50, was listed in crit
ical but stable condition in the intensive care unit
of a hospital near the crash scene.
