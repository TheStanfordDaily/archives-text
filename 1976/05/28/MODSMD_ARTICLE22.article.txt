# Drought to raise food prices?
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) — The state warned
yesterday that another year of drought in
California could force a cutback in irriga
tion farming and drive food prices even
higher.
Some irrigation districts will use all their
water this summer, with no carry-over for a
dry 1977, said a report issued by the state
Water Resources Department.
Water Director Ronald Robie said 1976
was the third driest year in California's his
tory, behind 1924 and 1931. He said odds
are 1977 won't be as dry. but there's no way
to be sure, and urged people to plan for the
worst.
He said some irrigation districts have "ta
ken greater risks in the use of water this dry
year than were intended in the design of

their projects."
Robie would not name the districts, but
the report said: "Water project operators
are, for the most part, using all available
water in their reservoirs for irrigation in
1976. leaving most reservoirs at dead stor
age in the fall of 1976.
"Exceptions are the Central Valley Pro
ject. State Water Project System, the Col
orado River reservoirs, Don Pedro and
McClure reservoirs in the San Joaquin Val
ley, and San Antonio and Nacimiento reser
voirs in the Salinas Valley."
The report said the State Water Project
will be able to meet all its commitments in
1977, even if it is as dry as 1976 — unless
federal projects stop helping protect water
quality in the Sacramento-San Joaquin

Delta.
In that case, the report said, the state
would have to cut water for agriculture by
50 percent.
The report said that the state Department
of Food and Agriculture warns that more
drought in 1977 "would cause complex and
serious problems for the state's agricultural
industry."
It might force a cutback in plantings of
rice, cotton, sugar beets, alfalfa and other
crops that require substantial irrigation.
"As usual," the Food and Agriculture
Department said, "the consumer would
again be asked to pay the price, responding
to an unbalanced supply-demand ratio for
goods over whose production he has no
control."
