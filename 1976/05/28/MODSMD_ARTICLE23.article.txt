# 'Star Trek' watching: a campus ritual?
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
Each decade of television leaves be
hind a representative of its major charac
teristics when it goes. The Fifties are still
with us in constant reruns of / Love Lucy,
an example of innovative and domestic
hilarity on a shoestring budget. The first
half of the Seventies bequeathed us syn
dicated reruns of All In The Family,
which broke down all of television's
taboos, from miscarriages to homosexu
ality.
The Sixties were as innovative as the
years around them. Cinematic tricks
were employed to produce a rash of
supernatural science fiction, with both
comedies and dramas dealing with ex
traterrestrial and abnormal people. They
ranged in intelligence from Batman and
The Green Hornet to My Living Doll,
Time Tunnel,The Addams Family, Lost
In Space, My Favorite Martian, The
Munsters, Land Of The Giants, The In
vaders, and Voyage To The Bottom Of
The Sea, all the way up to Star Trek, the
most popular one of all. It is the only one
still being broadcast in syndicated re
runs regularly, visible even more than
when it was broadcast on prime time be
tween 1966 and 1968.
It is seen on Channel 2 (San
Francisco-Oakland) and Channel 40
(Sacramento) weeknights at 6 o'clock
and shows no signs of slackening in
popularity. Its conventions and fan clubs
seem to increase rather than to decrease.
Star Trek is the representative of the far
out Sixties just as I Love Lucy and All In
The Family belong to their respective
decades. It is the only television series to
have been reinstated after its cancella
tion by a massive letter-writing cam
paign to NBC.
Ritualistic
And those of us here at Stanford, for all
our sophistication, are just as fascinated
by Star Trek as the rest of the country. In
some fraternities, viewing it has become
intensely ritualistic.
Trying to find a pattern in campus Star
Trek viewing habits is like driving
through campus when classes are being
dismissed — dangerous and ultimately
frustrating. An easy but empty generali
zation would be that there are more trek
kies in fraternities because there are
more communal television sets (watch
ing it with wise-cracking friends is half

the fun, they say). Unfortunately, that's
not true because some fraternity televi
sion sets are dark between six and seven.
Also, some dorms have very avid trek
kies. Determining a pattern is impossible
because there isn't one.
There is a fine line between those stu
dents who watch Star Trek at 6 o'clock
and those who simply watch television
at 6 o'clock. Some protest that there's
nothing to do at 6, and that Trek is "the
perfect opportunity not to do anything
until seven." One fraternity member in
sisted, "It's not the show, it's the time.
We used to watch The Wiid Wild West
they just switched shows on us."
Another said, "If it was Bewitched, you
wouldn't find anybody in here."
But more often, it's Star Trek that spec
ifically drags them in for personal
reasons, which range from"I like the
bitchin' chicks!" Jo "We only watch to
pick out the flaws." Searching out the
mistakes, especially for those who have
seen each episode innumerable times,
seems to be a favorite activity.
Once, according to one fraternity
member, "They beamed aboard seven
people — but they only have six pods."
One instance that slipped past the
creators to their dismay was Captain Kirk
(William Shatner) requesting Sulu
(George Takei) to increase their speed
one to the 10th power, which, as any
third grader should know, is still one. It
just sounds fast.
Some point to Star Trek as a show of
suspense and drama. "It's more interest
ing than any other dramatic show on
television," said one student. This
stance is in direct contrast to the student
who cynically claimed that "there's a
certain perverse fascination, because by
and large the shows themselves are so
bad — in some cases, it seems, inten
tional parodies of themselves."
But the show's popularity, for what
ever reason, cannot be doubted. A
member of Sigma Chi went so far as to
suggest "the campus is addicted to it."
Mr. Spock
A lot of Star Trek's popularity can be
directly traced to the character of Mr.
Spock. Leonard Nimoy portrays him as
the logical, unemotional contrast to the
hyper-emotional Dr. McCoy (DeForest
Kelley). Of all the actors, Nimoy is consi
dered the best. He has played in stage

versions of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's
Nest (as McMurphy), The Man In The
Glass Booth, as well as in Shakespeare.
Yet it is sometimes difficult for some to
accept him in other roles. Ironically,
when he played Paris on Mission: Impos
sible, he and Lesley Ann Warren re
placed Martin Landau and Barbara Bain,
who are now starring in a syndicated im
itation of Star Trek-Space 1999.
Kevin Chapman, a member of Kappa
Sigma, where the show is especially
popular, says, "Spock seems to exert a
special appeal. He's got his shit together
better than anybody else on the show. All
the humans seem indecisive and stupid
by comparison. In a weird way, he em
bodies the stoic side of the machismo
bag. He's never perturbed, even when
everyone else is losing it." Another
member added, "Nobody has even seen
anyone like Spock before. He is half
human (his mother was human, his
father Vulcan) and yet alien enough —
that makes him, if I may use his own
word, fascinating."
One student analyzed the attraction
even more carefully. "Spock is popular
to people around Stanford, because he is
fully in control of his emotions.
Everyone wants to feel they're in control
of themselves. He is the natural link to
experiences we can never have. With his
pointy ears and eyebrows, the difference
is accentuated."
Bones
It is indicative of Spock's popularity
that his opposite, Dr. McCoy, is un
iformly despised by the campus audi
ence. Various solutions to his existence
have been suggested, ranging from the
vague "They could get rid of him" to the
violent "He should be Shot" to the sadis
tic "He should be put in the transporter
with the controls set on wide dispersal."
An identification exists between the
"macho-stud" Kirk, the rational Spock,
and the student body. One student
explained,"(The show) provides an out
let for a vicarious pleasure in futuristic
achievement." The Starship Enterprise's
goal is apparently to make the galaxy safe
for democracy and capitalism. The 1967
social morality that pervades the show is
sometimes the source for the comedic
reputation it has. Captain Kirk's Prime
Directive from Starfleet while searching
out new life is "One shall not attempt to
modify a healthy culture." Many stu

dents gleefully point out that the direc
tive has been violated at least 10 times.
Kirk is an expert at making splitsecond
decisions on what constitutes a"healthy"
culture.
20th century ethics
It is the future achievement that stu
dent spoke of that sometimes causes
questions and doubts. In 600 years, will
there really be a Starfleet traveling
through the galaxy spreading the 20th
century American way of democracy and
male chauvinism and the Christian work
ethic? While it is easy for us to second
guess the writers 10 years later, it is still
amusing to watch men of the supposed
future advocating the 1967 imperialistic
class morality.
Asked if he considered that aspect bad.
Randy Stokes, a senior economics major,
replied, "That was the context in which
the show was written and created. The
producers were trying to come up with a
show that was entertaining and accepta
ble. If projection of what was to be were
possible, if would probably be unaccept
able to the 1967 audience."
Another flaw, Theta Delt Steve Dow
adds, is with the basic plot structure.
"What military system would beam
down its captain, its first officer and its
surgeon?"
Concentrating on Star Trek in a room
full of avid watchers is often impossible.
Every so often someone will enter the
room, watch one scene or one line of
dialogue, murmur, "Oh, this one," and
either depart and sit down depending on
the show's quality and how much they
wish to procrastinate. Sometimes if
you're lucky, there'll be a sadist present
whose main objective is to precede each
actor's line with a duplicate of his own to
demonstrate his memory skills. A dis
cernible echo is produced. However, all
generally agree that it's not as much fun
watching it alone.
Star Trek is an unusual anachronism
— it was mada in a recent yet distant past
and imagines a distant yet unlikely fu
ture. In a sense, it doesn't belong in the
1970s in which it's so firmly entrenched,
but it still survives, a peek into both the
past and the future. Its creator, Gene
Roddenberry, terms its appeal "future
nostalgia." It's a novelty — one that is
sometimes archaic in its sexual and so
cial politics. But above all, it's still attrac
tive escapism.


McCOY AND KIRK — The Star
Trek craze is alive and well on
campus as students flock to
television screens to view re
runs of their favorite series. Dr.
Leonard McCoy (DeForest
