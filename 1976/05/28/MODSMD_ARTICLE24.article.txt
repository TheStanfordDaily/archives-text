# Minnesota devastated by drought
## 
### 
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The
corn and hay are stunted, the
earth powder dry. Minnesota
farmers have already suffered
$600 million in crop losses this
spring in the state's worst
drought since 1910.
"Those are irrevocable los
ses," said Jon Wefald, Minneso
ta's agriculture commissioner.
"Kiss it good-bye. it's gone."
The drought began last sum
mer. Winter snows were light,
and spring rains lighter. Now
farmers hire rain makers, dairy
men talk of cutting back their
herds, and the forest lands of
northern Minnesota are desert
dry.
"It gets worse every day there
is no rain," said Wefald, whose
$600-million estimate of crop

losses Wednesday was three
times the estimate made only
five days before.
Losses
In an average year, Minnesota
farms produce crops worth $4
billion to $5 billion. They won't
this year, said Wefald, and he
spelled it out this way: $200
million in losses to the hay
crops, $200 million to the corp
crop and $200 milllion in small
grains — oats, rye and barley.
"No one knows how severe the
losses actually are," he added.
"We've never had one like this
before."
As the Minnesota farm season
swings into its crucial stage,
four-fifths of the state has
rceived below normal rainfall.
There is an eight-inch to 12-inch

rainfall deficit over wide areas
since last fall, and another
three-inch to four-inch deficit
this spring,
Half an inch of rain has fallen
in Minneapolis so far in May;
two and a half inches is normal.
The federal-state crop reporting
service said this week that sub
soil at some farms showed no
significant moisture nine feet
below ground.
Bad forecast
Weather forcasts call for no
substantial rain for the next sev
eral days in southern and central
Minnesota. So farmers in a six
county area around St. Cloud in
the center of the state raised
$75,000 and hired a rain maker.
Cloud seeding began Wednes
day, but there was no word of

successful results.
In the northern two-thirds of
the state, forestlands and grass
lands, there has been no sig
nificant rain in eight weeks and
logging has been banned in most
of the 3.4 -million-acre Superior
National Forest. The U.S. Forest
Service said some of the loggers,
laid off because of the ban, will

be used as standby firefighers.
The harshest effects of the
drought so far have been limited
to Minnesota, But the timber
lands of western Wisconsin are
dry and agricultural officials in
North Dakota said Wednesday
that farmers there would begin
losing crops if they don't get rain
soon.

farmers have already suffered
$600 million in crop losses this
spring in the state's worst
drought since 1910.
"Those are irrevocable los
ses," said Jon Wefald, Minneso
ta's agriculture commissioner.
"Kiss it good-bye. it's gone."
The drought began last sum
mer. Winter snows were light,
and spring rains lighter. Now
farmers hire rain makers, dairy
men talk of cutting back their
herds, and the forest lands of
northern Minnesota are desert
dry.
"It gets worse every day there
is no rain," said Wefald, whose
$600-million estimate of crop

losses Wednesday was three
times the estimate made only
five days before.
Losses
In an average year, Minnesota
farms produce crops worth $4
billion to $5 billion. They won't
this year, said Wefald, and he
spelled it out this way: $200
million in losses to the hay
crops, $200 million to the corp
crop and $200 milllion in small
grains — oats, rye and barley.
"No one knows how severe the
losses actually are," he added.
"We've never had one like this
before."
As the Minnesota farm season
swings into its crucial stage,
four-fifths of the state has
rceived below normal rainfall.
There is an eight-inch to 12-inch

rainfall deficit over wide areas
since last fall, and another
three-inch to four-inch deficit
this spring,
Half an inch of rain has fallen
in Minneapolis so far in May;
two and a half inches is normal.
The federal-state crop reporting
service said this week that sub
soil at some farms showed no
significant moisture nine feet
below ground.
Bad forecast
Weather forcasts call for no
substantial rain for the next sev
eral days in southern and central
Minnesota. So farmers in a six
county area around St. Cloud in
the center of the state raised
$75,000 and hired a rain maker.
Cloud seeding began Wednes
day, but there was no word of

successful results.
In the northern two-thirds of
the state, forestlands and grass
lands, there has been no sig
nificant rain in eight weeks and
logging has been banned in most
of the 3.4 -million-acre Superior
National Forest. The U.S. Forest
Service said some of the loggers,
laid off because of the ban, will

be used as standby firefighers.
The harshest effects of the
drought so far have been limited
to Minnesota, But the timber
lands of western Wisconsin are
dry and agricultural officials in
North Dakota said Wednesday
that farmers there would begin
losing crops if they don't get rain
soon.
