# Arms bill splits Congress
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Final Senate approval
ot a $31.8-billion weapons bill shifts a congres
sional battle over Navy ships and the controver
sial Bl bomber to a House-Senate conference
committee.
The Senate refused Wednesday night to reverse
its earlier decision, criticized by Gerald Ford, to
delay production of the first three Bl bombers at
least until Feb. 1, which is 12 days after the next
presidential inauguration.
An amendment by Sen. Robert Taft (R-Ohio) to
allow Ford to order the planes if he determined it
would help in negotiations with Russia for limita
tions on strategic nuclear arms, was rejected 47 to
30.
The Senate then approved the weapons bill 76
to 2, sending it to a conference with the House,
which passed a $33.3-billion bill April 9.
The House refused to impose restrictions on
Pentagon plans to order the first three of a $21-
billion fleet of 244 Bis about Nov. 1.
Major differences in the House and Senate ver
sions over Navy shipbuilding authorizations also
remain to be settled in conference.
The House has approved a $7.1-billion authori

zation for 20 new ships, with emphasis on
nuclear-powered vessels. The Senate allowed $6
billion for 16 new ships and settlement of back
claims from shipbuilders for cost escalations,
which the House voted to defer.
The Senate bill includes a $317-million au
thorization for 60 additional Minuteman 111 mis
siles and new larger warheads.
The Mi nuteman procurement, designed to keep
the only U.S. production line in operation, was
requested by the administration on April 28, after
the bill had been passed by the House.
The only major money change in the bill as
recommended by the Senate Armed Services
Committee was the elimination of a $120-million
authorization for the purchase of 24 A7D close
support tactical aircraft for the Air National
Guard.
The administration has sought $34.2 billion in
its revised budget for military items covered by
the bill, compared with $33.3 billion voted by the
House and $31.8 approved by the Senate.
An amendment by Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.), to
boost the Naval Reserve by 12,500 to a total of
92,000, was adopted 39 to 35.
