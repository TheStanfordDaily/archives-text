# Adelfa presents
## Battle of the sexes 
### 
Lysistrata, written by Aris
tophanes, will be presented
by Adelfa House on the grass
at Lagunita Courtyard tonight
and tomorrow at 7.
An anti-war satire, this
modern version by Dudly
Fitts is an irrepressible farce
concerning the classic "battle
of the sexes."
The heroine of the comedy
is a brilliant Athenian wife
who battles to end a war
through the use of women's
ultimate resource. Her deal
ings with the men and

women of Greece are unique
and at times off-color, but al
ways hysterical.
Under the direction of Dor
rie Braun, the members of the
cast have relinquished their
reputations for the love of
comedy and the pursuit of
true absurdity.
"We invite the Stanford
community to come frolic in
the grass and indulge in a bit
of the decadence of ancient
Greece," said Matthew Be
nito, a member of the cast.
