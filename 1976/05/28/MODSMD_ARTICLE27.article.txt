Could you tell me what flavor of soup Professor Barton Bernstein
drinks during every History 165 lecture? If it isn't soup, what sort of
liquid is it? -B.C.
It's coffee.Although our staffwas never able to get in touch with
Bernstein, both his wife and former students reported that Berns
tein's brew is heavily milked coffee. Apparently he began this
custom by drinking juice when he had a cold and has continued.

As I watched the tennis mutches this season, I noticed a camera
man, with all of his equipment, running around. I'm curious what
this filming was for. -DM.
Women's Tennis Coach Ann Hill said that the film is a documen
tary on the tennis team, produced by a communications graduate
student. The film, emphasizing the merger between t he men's and
women's teams, will be used for recruiting.

I have been trying to find professional resume writing services in
the immediate vicinity. Please help. -A.S.
Although there are serveral services listed in the Palo Alto phone
book, their representatives insisted that it is unlikely that you could
use them, assuming you are a student. The average fee for a com
plete resume is $150, which involves many services a student
couldn't use. Instead, they suggested that you use samples of a
standard resume (there are many in the placement center) to com
pile your information and then have the resume typed by a secreta
rial service.

NOTE: Those readers who squeamishly resisted saying "Yes! I
want to join the professionals," by subscribing to Soldier of For
tune magazine can put their fears to rest. It now surfaces that the
magazine's staff includes both a former teacher at Stanford (Mel
Tappan, survival editor) and a cum laude graduate of Harvard Law
School (Major Alex M.S. McColl, military affairs). The information
on Tappan comes from the June edition of Reason magazine, al
though no one at Stanford has been able to confirm that he was
here.
