# 'Flower man' likes independence
## 
### Meika Fang 
The ditty goes . . doctor, lawyer, Indian
chief," but not for Larry Tarquinio, the
lanky, bespectacled flower man of White
Plaza. He would rather sell flowers than
pursue a traditional career.
The 26-year-old Tarquinio and his out
door stand of flowers are familiar sights to
students scurrying between classes. Can
after can of carnations, roses, daffodils and
even birds of paradise balance on wooden
stands to beckon the buyer after a bargain
pleasing to the eye and heart.
Many of his student customers, sub
merged in pre-professional studies, don't
realize that Tarquinio was like them a few
years ago. He was taking social work
courses at San Jose State University until he
discovered the flower business.
"In the back of my mind, 1 can hear my
father saying, 'you were going to be a
lawyer, I thought,' " he recalls.
Likes independence
Tarquinio, however, enjoys being a
flower seller, even if it doesn't have much
status. He likes being independent and free
from usual business hassles.
He's been at Stanford for 2Vz years. Only
this year has been profitable because of the
good weather and students stuck here for
Christmas and Easter.
"Larry is into self-sufficiency and could
make more money doing something else or
expanding," notes Mike Rowan, his
housemate and occasional helper.
Tarquinio has considered expanding but
says,"I really don't have the temperament
for that."
High-pressured
"It's too high-pressured," he notes. "I
would be rearranging my life so that busi

ness would come first and everything else
after that."
Instead of the 40-hour-week routine, Tar
quinio spends about 60 hours a week at his
business. This also entails getting up early
— very early.
"Larry is up by 3 a.m., preparing to go to
San Francisco to get the best flowers,"
Rowan says.
Buying flowers is the one part of the job
Tarquinio dislikes.
"It's a chore," he says, because the people
selling him flowers are often unscrupulous.
Dead merchandise
The flower merchants frequently sell him
"dead" merchandise — the flowers, stored
in the refrigerator too long, look normal yet
shrivel in water. The dealers don't let him
see the flowers he's buying nor do they
guarantee them.
He also notes that "there's one guy who
charges 50 different prices for 50 different
people."
"Florists hate people like me because
we're undercutting them," Tarquinio says.
"My overhead is my losses."
Florists can keep flowers longer under
refrigeration; Tarquinio loses flowers dam
aged by the wind and sun.
At a flower market, one florist was
amazed that Tarquinio sold carnations out
doors. The man thought it was not possible
since "they would die in a day."
His start
"But I said, 'I'm doing it.' "
Tarquinio traces his start in the flower
business to his sales experiences at college.
He was part of a San Jose State coopera
tive selling fruit and making "rotten
money."
"It was probably between $1 - 1.50 an
hour," he says. "To me, that wasn't worth it.

The only way I could rationalize it was by
remembering that we were doing a good
service to the students."
While pedding fruit, he met another stu
dent, Bruce Labadie, setting up a flower and
plant business to pay off a truck. Labadie
hired him to sell flowers at San Jose State.
Similar stand
In the summer of 1973, Labadie opened a
similar stand at Stanford. When Labadie left
for school in the fall, Tarquinio, already out
of school, took over.
"At that time, I was selling mostly plants.
That year was really amazing. That was the
year of the plant fad," he recalls.
Plants, he notes, required so much care
that at times all he did was sleep and work.
They needed to be watered, protected from
the cold and bagged.
"I was working 80 hours a week. I don't
know why I did it. I was crazy," Tarquinio
explains.
He's often asked whether he grows the
flowers he sells.
Silly question
"No!" Tarquinio retorts with a grin to the
"silly" question. He notes that flower grow
ing is a highly competitive business requir
ing much land, staff, distasteful bookkeep
ing and carefully controlled conditions.
He prefers the long hours and hard work
to peddle, not grow, flowers. Moreover, he
doesn't regret leaving college for the flower
business because he's "not a sitter."
Tarquinio doesn't want to trade his job for
anything else. Hegets to meet peopleand be
independent by selling flowers.
His customers are glad he's happy.
As one man said as he pedaled away with
bouquets of sweet william and bachelor's
buttons in hand, "Who can resist?"

Instead of the 40-hour-week routine, Tar
quinio spends about 60 hours a week at his
business. This also entails getting up early
— very early.
"Larry is up by 3 a.m., preparing to go to
San Francisco to get the best flowers,"
Rowan says.
Buying flowers is the one part of the job
Tarquinio dislikes.
"It's a chore," he says, because the people
selling him flowers are often unscrupulous.
Dead merchandise
The flower merchants frequently sell him
"dead" merchandise — the flowers, stored
in the refrigerator too long, look normal yet
shrivel in water. The dealers don't let him
see the flowers he's buying nor do they
guarantee them.
He also notes that "there's one guy who
charges 50 different prices for 50 different
people."
"Florists hate people like me because
we're undercutting them," Tarquinio says.
"My overhead is my losses."
Florists can keep flowers longer under
refrigeration; Tarquinio loses flowers dam
aged by the wind and sun.
At a flower market, one florist was
amazed that Tarquinio sold carnations out
doors. The man thought it was not possible
since "they would die in a day."
His start
"But I said, 'I'm doing it.' "
Tarquinio traces his start in the flower
business to his sales experiences at college.
He was part of a San Jose State coopera
tive selling fruit and making "rotten
money."
"It was probably between $1 - 1.50 an
hour," he says. "To me, that wasn't worth it.

The only way I could rationalize it was by
remembering that we were doing a good
service to the students."
While pedding fruit, he met another stu
dent, Bruce Labadie, setting up a flower and
plant business to pay off a truck. Labadie
hired him to sell flowers at San Jose State.
Similar stand
In the summer of 1973, Labadie opened a
similar stand at Stanford. When Labadie left
for school in the fall, Tarquinio, already out
of school, took over.
"At that time, I was selling mostly plants.
That year was really amazing. That was the
year of the plant fad," he recalls.
Plants, he notes, required so much care
that at times all he did was sleep and work.
They needed to be watered, protected from
the cold and bagged.
"I was working 80 hours a week. I don't
know why I did it. I was crazy," Tarquinio
explains.
He's often asked whether he grows the
flowers he sells.
Silly question
"No!" Tarquinio retorts with a grin to the
"silly" question. He notes that flower grow
ing is a highly competitive business requir
ing much land, staff, distasteful bookkeep
ing and carefully controlled conditions.
He prefers the long hours and hard work
to peddle, not grow, flowers. Moreover, he
doesn't regret leaving college for the flower
business because he's "not a sitter."
Tarquinio doesn't want to trade his job for
anything else. Hegets to meet peopleand be
independent by selling flowers.
His customers are glad he's happy.
As one man said as he pedaled away with
bouquets of sweet william and bachelor's
buttons in hand, "Who can resist?"
The ditty goes . . doctor, lawyer, Indian
chief," but not for Larry Tarquinio, the
lanky, bespectacled flower man of White
Plaza. He would rather sell flowers than
pursue a traditional career.
The 26-year-old Tarquinio and his out
door stand of flowers are familiar sights to
students scurrying between classes. Can
after can of carnations, roses, daffodils and
even birds of paradise balance on wooden
stands to beckon the buyer after a bargain
pleasing to the eye and heart.
Many of his student customers, sub
merged in pre-professional studies, don't
realize that Tarquinio was like them a few
years ago. He was taking social work
courses at San Jose State University until he
discovered the flower business.
"In the back of my mind, 1 can hear my
father saying, 'you were going to be a
lawyer, I thought,' " he recalls.
Likes independence
Tarquinio, however, enjoys being a
flower seller, even if it doesn't have much
status. He likes being independent and free
from usual business hassles.
He's been at Stanford for 2Vz years. Only
this year has been profitable because of the
good weather and students stuck here for
Christmas and Easter.
"Larry is into self-sufficiency and could
make more money doing something else or
expanding," notes Mike Rowan, his
housemate and occasional helper.
Tarquinio has considered expanding but
says,"I really don't have the temperament
for that."
High-pressured
"It's too high-pressured," he notes. "I
would be rearranging my life so that busi

ness would come first and everything else
after that."

remembering that we were doing a good
service to the students."
While pedding fruit, he met another stu
dent, Bruce Labadie, setting up a flower and
plant business to pay off a truck. Labadie
hired him to sell flowers at San Jose State.
Similar stand
In the summer of 1973, Labadie opened a
similar stand at Stanford. When Labadie left
for school in the fall, Tarquinio, already out
of school, took over.
"At that time, I was selling mostly plants.
That year was really amazing. That was the
year of the plant fad," he recalls.
Plants, he notes, required so much care
that at times all he did was sleep and work.
They needed to be watered, protected from
the cold and bagged.
"I was working 80 hours a week. I don't
know why I did it. I was crazy," Tarquinio
explains.
He's often asked whether he grows the
flowers he sells.
Silly question
"No!" Tarquinio retorts with a grin to the
"silly" question. He notes that flower grow
ing is a highly competitive business requir
ing much land, staff, distasteful bookkeep
ing and carefully controlled conditions.
He prefers the long hours and hard work
to peddle, not grow, flowers. Moreover, he
doesn't regret leaving college for the flower
business because he's "not a sitter."
Tarquinio doesn't want to trade his job for
anything else. Hegets to meet peopleand be
independent by selling flowers.
His customers are glad he's happy.
As one man said as he pedaled away with
bouquets of sweet william and bachelor's
buttons in hand, "Who can resist?"
