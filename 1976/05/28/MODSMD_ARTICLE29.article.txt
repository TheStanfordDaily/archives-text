# Housing bill to relieve job crunch
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” A
$4.9-billion omnibus housing
bill approved by the House
would provide federal funds to
local governments in areas hit by
high unemployment.
The bill, passed on Wednes
day by a 332-27 vote, would pro
vide $1.3 billion in aid to
localities with high unemploy
ment rates. The money would be
used to carry out public works
projects stalled because of
economic problems.
Gommunity development
funds would go to areas with un
employment rates of more than
eight percent, if the national job
less rate is six percent or more.
The unemployment rate in April

was 7.i percent.
Neither of the chief sponsors.
Reps. Garry Brown (R-Mich.)
and John LaFalce (D-N.Y.), could
estimate how many jobs would
be created by the public works
section.
The Senate has also passed its
own housing bill.
The House deleted a section

that would have mandated the
Department of Housing and
Urban Development to spend at
least $140 million for construc
tion of new public housing units
or substantial rehabilitation of
existing units.
The Senate bill requires HUD
to spend at least $200 million for

new public-housing projects.
Senate Banking Chairman
William Proxmire (D-Wis.) said
after Senate passage of the bill
last month that it would provide
up to one million construction
jobs.
The sponsors of the House bill
made no similar claims.
