# Marines to change image?

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The image of the fierce,
bellowing drill instructor standing nose-to-nose
with a scared young recruit will disappear as part
of an effort to end boot camp training abuses,
Marine Commandant Louis Wilson claims.
"I do not believe in yelling nose-to-nose and all
of these other things we have heard about," the
commandant told a House committee on Wed
nesday. "And we're going to put a stop to it."
vVilson spelled out his reforms in testimony
before the House personnel subcommittee, which
is investigating alleged abuses. During two days

of hearings, the panel was told details of the al
leged beating death of one recruit and the bullet
wounding of another by a drill instructor armed
with a rifle.
Wilson said he has added psychiatric screening
to the tests boot camp instructors must take to
determine if they are likely to abuse trainees.
He also says he has eliminated drill instructor
awards, which he suggested have been a cause for
drill instructors putting excessive pressure on re
cruits to perform well, even though some of them
were unable to do so.
