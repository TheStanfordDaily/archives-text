# Unemployed youth
## Job-seekers face obstacles 
### Riv Weber 
Jose is 23 years old and out of work. He is col
lecting $247 each month from the Santa Clara
County Welfare Department under the General
Assistance plan. Jose is unable to find a job be
cause he has no marketable skills.
Sheila, age 16, is in high school in San Jose. She
comes from a low-income family, is unskilled,
and is looking for a part-time job to supplement
the family's income.
Robert is 19. He will graduate from a South
County high school this spring, with no marketa
ble skill. He does not expect to continue his edu
cation. Robert's family is also in the "disadvan
taged" classification of the Welfare Department.
Jose, Sheila and Robert are not alone with their
problems. Nationally, youth unemployment has
reached severe proportions. As of January 1975,
unemployment among 16- to 21-year-olds was at
24.8 percent for whites and 42.4 percent for
minorities, as reported by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics.
Target groups
This year, the Department of Labor released a
list of target groups for employment aid, citing
those most in need of manpower services nation
wide. Youth ranked sixth on this list of national
priorities.
In Santa Clara County, 37 percent of the popula
tion was under the age of 20 in 1975. Nationally,
this figure is more than 20 percent of the popula
tion under the age of 20.
Where can the unemployed youth turn to for
help? Although the Employment Development
Department (EDD) of California aids the un
employed of all ages, no special consideration is
given unemployed youth.
With the disbanding of the Youth Oppor
tunities Program earlier this decade, youth ser
vices under EED are limited to the Job Corps.
Serving youth aged 16 through 21 "with li
mited educational, vocational and social skills
who are out of school, out of work and living in
impoverished surroundings," Job Corps is a fed
erally funded EDD program. It offers away-from
home residential training experience.
Maximum assistance
For maximum assistance, the unemployed
youth should turn to the programs organized by
the Santa Clara Valley Employment and Training
Board (CETA). CETA is designed to aid all un
employed persons of the community.
Operating on an annual budget of more than
$14 million, the Santa Clara Valley CETA "prize
sponsor" administers programs for the entire
county, exclusive of Sunnyvale.
CETA youth services are divided into three
major operations. The Career Opportunity Prog
ram for Youth (COPY) is designed to aid out-of
school youths like Jose. COPY encompasses train
ing and placement for persons between the ages of
17V2 and 24.
The Santa Clara Valley Youth Employment
Service (YES) is designed for people like Sheila.
YES offers placement services for youths ages 14
through 21.
The Vocational Opportunities in Career Educa
tion (VOICE) offers an outlet for high school
seniors like Robert. The work-experience prog
rams are geared for disadvantaged youths, aged
17 through 19, who do not plan to continue their

education.
COPY director Tony Morales explained the
screening process for choosing 100 persons to
enter the work experience and classroom training
slots of the COPY program each year.
Applicant referrals
"Applicants (for COPY) are mainly referred
from friends. EDD or Social Services. If they're
forced to apply, they won't be committed to the
program. We screen for those forced to apply by a
social worker or probation officer," said Morales.
While in a work-experience program, particip
ants receive $2.30 per hour, the minimum wage.
This wage is also paid for time spent in classroom
training, if the paticipant is not collecting welfare.
For those receiving aid, 75 cents per hour is the
wage. This pay is to cover indirect training ex
penses such as baby sitting for AFDC mothers or
transportation costs.
Placement rate
The placement rate for COPY is 75 percent.
COPY also conducts a 30-day, 60-day and six
month follow-up, to determine job retention.
Ninety-one percent of those placed remain in
their jobs, reported Morales. Those who train at
San Jose Hospital, in a work-experience program,
may later be hired at a starting salary of $7.50,
explained Morales.
For the unemployed senior in high school,
VOICE is the program to enter for training.
Paticipants are selected from low-income homes
based on Affirmative Action guidelines. Fifty
three percent chosen are of Spanish surname, 34
percent are Anglo, seven percent are black and the
remaining six percent are classified as "other."
VOICE operates two programs, one during the
school year and a summer program. During the
school year, VOICE trains 150 students annually.
In operation since 1965, VOICE is funded by
CETA with the Superintendent of Santa Clara
Schools Office serving as a supervisory body.
Unlike COPY, the VOICE program is relatively
easy to enter. Recruitment is done through the
high schools. Applications are available in the
career centers.
Students enroll in related classes and are then
placed in public and non-profit organizations for
work-experience training. Working 15 hours per
week they receive a salary of $2.30 as well as five
units per semester for the two semesters of the
senior year.
VOICE Director Hector Rosendrin reported that
80 percent of the students who have completed
the program are now in full-time jobs or further
ing their education. Sixty-four percent of the par
ticipants enter the labor market immediately.
This CETA youth placement service placed 800
students last year. Six thousand have entered ap
plications which are presently on file. The service
works mainly with high school students. The as
sumption is that college students can get their
own jobs, explained Youth Employment Coun
selor Tom Medley.
CETA youth training programs and placement
services are reporting high success rates. As of
March, 1976, COPY's placement rate was 76 per
cent, with an average starting wage of $3.33. YES
total placements were reported by CETA as 91
percent of planned. CETA is successfully handl
ing the youth unemployment problem which EDD
has been unable to reduce.

reached severe proportions. As of January 1975,
unemployment among 16- to 21-year-olds was at
24.8 percent for whites and 42.4 percent for
minorities, as reported by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics.
Target groups
This year, the Department of Labor released a
list of target groups for employment aid, citing
those most in need of manpower services nation
wide. Youth ranked sixth on this list of national
priorities.
In Santa Clara County, 37 percent of the popula
tion was under the age of 20 in 1975. Nationally,
this figure is more than 20 percent of the popula
tion under the age of 20.
Where can the unemployed youth turn to for
help? Although the Employment Development
Department (EDD) of California aids the un
employed of all ages, no special consideration is
given unemployed youth.
With the disbanding of the Youth Oppor
tunities Program earlier this decade, youth ser
vices under EED are limited to the Job Corps.
Serving youth aged 16 through 21 "with li
mited educational, vocational and social skills
who are out of school, out of work and living in
impoverished surroundings," Job Corps is a fed
erally funded EDD program. It offers away-from
home residential training experience.
Maximum assistance
For maximum assistance, the unemployed
youth should turn to the programs organized by
the Santa Clara Valley Employment and Training
Board (CETA). CETA is designed to aid all un
employed persons of the community.
Operating on an annual budget of more than
$14 million, the Santa Clara Valley CETA "prize
sponsor" administers programs for the entire
county, exclusive of Sunnyvale.
CETA youth services are divided into three
major operations. The Career Opportunity Prog
ram for Youth (COPY) is designed to aid out-of
school youths like Jose. COPY encompasses train
ing and placement for persons between the ages of
17V2 and 24.
The Santa Clara Valley Youth Employment
Service (YES) is designed for people like Sheila.
YES offers placement services for youths ages 14
through 21.
The Vocational Opportunities in Career Educa
tion (VOICE) offers an outlet for high school
seniors like Robert. The work-experience prog
rams are geared for disadvantaged youths, aged
17 through 19, who do not plan to continue their

education.
COPY director Tony Morales explained the
screening process for choosing 100 persons to
enter the work experience and classroom training
slots of the COPY program each year.
Applicant referrals
"Applicants (for COPY) are mainly referred
from friends. EDD or Social Services. If they're
forced to apply, they won't be committed to the
program. We screen for those forced to apply by a
social worker or probation officer," said Morales.
While in a work-experience program, particip
ants receive $2.30 per hour, the minimum wage.
This wage is also paid for time spent in classroom
training, if the paticipant is not collecting welfare.
For those receiving aid, 75 cents per hour is the
wage. This pay is to cover indirect training ex
penses such as baby sitting for AFDC mothers or
transportation costs.
Placement rate
The placement rate for COPY is 75 percent.
COPY also conducts a 30-day, 60-day and six
month follow-up, to determine job retention.
Ninety-one percent of those placed remain in
their jobs, reported Morales. Those who train at
San Jose Hospital, in a work-experience program,
may later be hired at a starting salary of $7.50,
explained Morales.
For the unemployed senior in high school,
VOICE is the program to enter for training.
Paticipants are selected from low-income homes
based on Affirmative Action guidelines. Fifty
three percent chosen are of Spanish surname, 34
percent are Anglo, seven percent are black and the
remaining six percent are classified as "other."
VOICE operates two programs, one during the
school year and a summer program. During the
school year, VOICE trains 150 students annually.
In operation since 1965, VOICE is funded by
CETA with the Superintendent of Santa Clara
Schools Office serving as a supervisory body.
Unlike COPY, the VOICE program is relatively
easy to enter. Recruitment is done through the
high schools. Applications are available in the
career centers.
Students enroll in related classes and are then
placed in public and non-profit organizations for
work-experience training. Working 15 hours per
week they receive a salary of $2.30 as well as five
units per semester for the two semesters of the
senior year.
VOICE Director Hector Rosendrin reported that
80 percent of the students who have completed
the program are now in full-time jobs or further
ing their education. Sixty-four percent of the par
ticipants enter the labor market immediately.
This CETA youth placement service placed 800
students last year. Six thousand have entered ap
plications which are presently on file. The service
works mainly with high school students. The as
sumption is that college students can get their
own jobs, explained Youth Employment Coun
selor Tom Medley.
CETA youth training programs and placement
services are reporting high success rates. As of
March, 1976, COPY's placement rate was 76 per
cent, with an average starting wage of $3.33. YES
total placements were reported by CETA as 91
percent of planned. CETA is successfully handl
ing the youth unemployment problem which EDD
has been unable to reduce.
Jose is 23 years old and out of work. He is col
lecting $247 each month from the Santa Clara
County Welfare Department under the General
Assistance plan. Jose is unable to find a job be
cause he has no marketable skills.
Sheila, age 16, is in high school in San Jose. She
comes from a low-income family, is unskilled,
and is looking for a part-time job to supplement
the family's income.
Robert is 19. He will graduate from a South
County high school this spring, with no marketa
ble skill. He does not expect to continue his edu
cation. Robert's family is also in the "disadvan
taged" classification of the Welfare Department.

employed of all ages, no special consideration is
given unemployed youth.
With the disbanding of the Youth Oppor
tunities Program earlier this decade, youth ser
vices under EED are limited to the Job Corps.
Serving youth aged 16 through 21 "with li
mited educational, vocational and social skills
who are out of school, out of work and living in
impoverished surroundings," Job Corps is a fed
erally funded EDD program. It offers away-from
home residential training experience.
Maximum assistance
For maximum assistance, the unemployed
youth should turn to the programs organized by
the Santa Clara Valley Employment and Training
Board (CETA). CETA is designed to aid all un
employed persons of the community.
Operating on an annual budget of more than
$14 million, the Santa Clara Valley CETA "prize
sponsor" administers programs for the entire
county, exclusive of Sunnyvale.
CETA youth services are divided into three
major operations. The Career Opportunity Prog
ram for Youth (COPY) is designed to aid out-of
school youths like Jose. COPY encompasses train
ing and placement for persons between the ages of
17V2 and 24.
The Santa Clara Valley Youth Employment
Service (YES) is designed for people like Sheila.
YES offers placement services for youths ages 14
through 21.
The Vocational Opportunities in Career Educa
tion (VOICE) offers an outlet for high school
seniors like Robert. The work-experience prog
rams are geared for disadvantaged youths, aged
17 through 19, who do not plan to continue their

education.
COPY director Tony Morales explained the
screening process for choosing 100 persons to
enter the work experience and classroom training
slots of the COPY program each year.
Applicant referrals
"Applicants (for COPY) are mainly referred
from friends. EDD or Social Services. If they're
forced to apply, they won't be committed to the
program. We screen for those forced to apply by a
social worker or probation officer," said Morales.
While in a work-experience program, particip
ants receive $2.30 per hour, the minimum wage.
This wage is also paid for time spent in classroom
training, if the paticipant is not collecting welfare.
For those receiving aid, 75 cents per hour is the
wage. This pay is to cover indirect training ex
penses such as baby sitting for AFDC mothers or
transportation costs.
Placement rate
The placement rate for COPY is 75 percent.
COPY also conducts a 30-day, 60-day and six
month follow-up, to determine job retention.
Ninety-one percent of those placed remain in
their jobs, reported Morales. Those who train at
San Jose Hospital, in a work-experience program,
may later be hired at a starting salary of $7.50,
explained Morales.
For the unemployed senior in high school,
VOICE is the program to enter for training.
Paticipants are selected from low-income homes
based on Affirmative Action guidelines. Fifty
three percent chosen are of Spanish surname, 34
percent are Anglo, seven percent are black and the
remaining six percent are classified as "other."
VOICE operates two programs, one during the
school year and a summer program. During the
school year, VOICE trains 150 students annually.
In operation since 1965, VOICE is funded by
CETA with the Superintendent of Santa Clara
Schools Office serving as a supervisory body.
Unlike COPY, the VOICE program is relatively
easy to enter. Recruitment is done through the
high schools. Applications are available in the
career centers.
Students enroll in related classes and are then
placed in public and non-profit organizations for
work-experience training. Working 15 hours per
week they receive a salary of $2.30 as well as five
units per semester for the two semesters of the
senior year.
VOICE Director Hector Rosendrin reported that
80 percent of the students who have completed
the program are now in full-time jobs or further
ing their education. Sixty-four percent of the par
ticipants enter the labor market immediately.
This CETA youth placement service placed 800
students last year. Six thousand have entered ap
plications which are presently on file. The service
works mainly with high school students. The as
sumption is that college students can get their
own jobs, explained Youth Employment Coun
selor Tom Medley.
CETA youth training programs and placement
services are reporting high success rates. As of
March, 1976, COPY's placement rate was 76 per
cent, with an average starting wage of $3.33. YES
total placements were reported by CETA as 91
percent of planned. CETA is successfully handl
ing the youth unemployment problem which EDD
has been unable to reduce.
Jose is 23 years old and out of work. He is col
lecting $247 each month from the Santa Clara
County Welfare Department under the General
Assistance plan. Jose is unable to find a job be
cause he has no marketable skills.
Sheila, age 16, is in high school in San Jose. She
comes from a low-income family, is unskilled,
and is looking for a part-time job to supplement
the family's income.
Robert is 19. He will graduate from a South
County high school this spring, with no marketa
ble skill. He does not expect to continue his edu
cation. Robert's family is also in the "disadvan
taged" classification of the Welfare Department.
Jose, Sheila and Robert are not alone with their
problems. Nationally, youth unemployment has
reached severe proportions. As of January 1975,
unemployment among 16- to 21-year-olds was at
24.8 percent for whites and 42.4 percent for
minorities, as reported by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics.
Target groups
This year, the Department of Labor released a
list of target groups for employment aid, citing
those most in need of manpower services nation
wide. Youth ranked sixth on this list of national
priorities.
In Santa Clara County, 37 percent of the popula
tion was under the age of 20 in 1975. Nationally,
this figure is more than 20 percent of the popula
tion under the age of 20.
