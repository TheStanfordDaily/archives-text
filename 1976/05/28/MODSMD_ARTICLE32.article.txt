## Steak and Ale A 						touch of old England 
### 
Reviews by Nancy Wilson
Steak and Ale restaurant on East Bayshore is
well worth trying. It includes both a bar lounge
and a dining area, both set in an old English decor.
The atmosphere is calm, relaxed and enjoyable.
There is a gas fireplace in the dining room, stained
glass windows to soften the outside light and
amicable waiters and waitresses dressed in Three
Musketeer era barhouse garb.
There is a crab cocktail for appetizers, but of
primary interest is the long list of beef entrees.
Heading the list is roast beef (King and Queen
portions), steak and lobster, Alaskan King crab
and steak, top sirloin, steak and chicken, and
more. The names indicate the theme: Duke's filet,
Prince and Pauper, Pauper's Platter, Kensington
Club.
The prices range from $(i to $8, going up to $10
for the steak and lobster. All things considered,
the meals are rather inexpensive. The servings of
meat are generous. The steak and Alaskan King

Crab had both a healthy portion of steak, done as
ordered, and a good long arm of crab. The queen's
size roast beef was also a good serving, even for
queens.
What makes the dinner really worth the price is
the extras — choice of baked potato or rice,
warmed bread and butter, a salad bar with plenty
of condiments, a delicious sour cream-garlic dres
sing and self-serve onion soup.
Dessert choices are Tumbleweed, Charlie Brown
Pie, Bavarian Cream pie and cheese cake. Coing
for the familiar and the foreign we ordered cheese
cake and the Tumbleweed. The cheese cake was
happily familiar, moist, creamy, rich. The
Tumbleweed is made with vanilla ice cream,
Kahlua and creme de cocoa. After a large meal it
was perfect — cold, sweet, not too heavy, with all
the ingredients whipped together forming a fro
zen ice, then topped with whipped cream. Prices
here stay close to $1. To accompany your dessert
Steak and Ale offers plain or jazzy coffees, like
Irish, Swiss, etc.
