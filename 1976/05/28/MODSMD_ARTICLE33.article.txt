# Two Sisters'
## Crepes with a Swiss touch 
### 
In a quaint section of Los Altos, two sis
ters, Kay and Elaine, have set up a small
restaurant â€”The Two Sisters' Greperie.
Open for lunch and dinner, they offer cre
pes. omelets, quiche and drinks. The set up
is small, "cute," with just a bit of a Swiss
feeling. Where other creperies rely on the
idea of crepes alone, Two Sisters' manages
to combine two techniques, both light cre
pes and flavorful stuffings.
The list of entree crepes numbers 16.
Choices are made easier by allowing you to
order one each of two kinds instead of just
two of one kind. From the top of the list we
tried Pippin's Pride and crepe ratatouille.
Pippin's Pride was practically dessert for
dinner. The filling is cheddar cheese and
apples sauteed in brown sugar and cinna
mon. It is also one of the few entree crepes
without the white sauce which is found
everywhere else. The ratatouille filling is a
combi nation of 7.11 cchini, tomatoes, broccoli
and Gruyere cheese, and topped with the
faithful white sauce.

Other entree crepes samples were the
Florentine crepe and the Four Star crepe.
The Florentine is spinach and Swiss cheese
blended with mushrooms, topped with
sauce. One of their popular choices, The
Four Star crepe, was stuffed with cubed
ham, gruyere cheese and mushrooms wi th a
white wine sauce inside, and the standard
sauce on top. Again, the stuffings are quite
tasty, but the sauce topping lacked intrigue.
Before the entree I helped myself to the
salad bar. The lettuce was a bit on the limp
side and the toppings weren't special, but
the oil and vinegar dressing, which had a
touch of mustard, was very good. My guest
tried the potato leek soup, which was just a
little on the bland side.
After dinner, there are 13 dessert crepes.
Most feature fresh fruit of some sort, or pre
serves, with a couple of chocolate varieties
mixed in. We ordered the strawberry confi
ture and the Jamaican pleasure. The confi
tures come with a choice of fruit preserves,

topped with whipped cream. The Jamaican
pleasure crepe was filled with banana slices
sauteed in brown sugar, butter, rum and
almond slices. While not hot in thecore, it is
sweet and delicious.
On the whole, you probably can't go
wrong with a dessert crepe. Add to it one of
their coffees, say cafe Royale, a blend of
coffee and brandy, or Empress coffee, crerne
de Cacao and coffee, and you've got quite a
filling after dinner course.
Prices at Two Sisters' range around $3 for
one entree crepe (or just over $4 for two of
the same kind), under $3 for non crepe en
trees and just under $2 for the dessert cre
pes. A plentiful meal for one person would
be two entree crepes, one dessert crepe and
something to drink, running around $8. The
comfort is being able to order only what you
want to eat and paying for only what you
order. Two Sisters' isn't too far away, and
offers nice flavor in crepes at a not
unreasonable price.
