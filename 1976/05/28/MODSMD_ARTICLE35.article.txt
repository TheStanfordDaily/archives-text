## Women netters to face UCLA 
### Jill Lieber 
Tomorrow's match here
against UCLA should provide
the women's tennis team with its
tirst "competitive" contest in a
month, according to Card coach
Anne Hill.
Play will begin on the Varsity
Courts at 1 p.m.
Coing into tomorrow's
matches, the Stanford women
are unbeaten in eight dual en
counters, while UCLA has a re
cord of 17-2. The Bruins' two
losses came against Stanford and
Arizona State.
Hill called the UCLA squad
"one of the top five teams in the
country" and cited the Bruins'
top two netters, Paula Smith and
Cindy Thomas, as the Cards'
toughest opponents.
In the 1975 junior rankings.
Smith was ranked third in pr >'
18 doubles with partner
Hagey (now a Card).
Lacks depth
I iill pointed out that although
UCLA has a few good players, it
lacks the depth the Cards pos
sess.
In their last meeting, Stanford
beat UCLA 8-1 with the Cards'
No. 1 woman Lele Forood suffer
ing the only loss. Smith beat
Forood in three sets 6-7,6-4,6-3.
Forood, who missed practice
Wednesday due to a mild case of
the flu, hopes to beat Smith in
this meeting.
"When we played at UCLA it
was very windy and she (Smith)
played incredibly well," Forood
recalled. "It came down to a
couple of points in the last set.
That's been the story of all my
losses this year."
The Cards' biggest threat will
come in No. 1 doubles when
Smith and Thomas team against
Forood and Barb Jordan.
Four titles
The UCLA duo has won four
tournament titles this year —
Ojai Doubles Open Division,
Southern California Sectionals,
Southern California Women's
Intercollegiate Conference and
the Arizona Invitational. They
racked up 19 straight doubles
victories on their way to the
tournament titles.
Against the Bruins, Forood
will play No. 1 singles and Liza
Pande will be the No. 5 slot. Hill
said she had yet to set the re
maining lineup, but stated that
Jordan, Hagey and Diane Morri
son will also play singles.
This week, Jordan, Hagey,
Morrison and Marcy O'Keefe

played a round robin to aid Hill
in deciding which three will go
to the U.S. Tennis Association's
Collegiate Nationals next
month.
Forood guaranteed
The Cards will send four sing
les players, with Forood already
guaranteed a berth. The results
of the round robin are puzzling.
Hill said. She pointed out that
Jordan, the No. 2 player this year,
lost her three matches.
However, Hill praised the
round robin matches, saying
they were "invaluable as a type
of practice. You can't imitate
match competition in practice.
"After playing these, we can
sit down and analyze the game.
They (round robin matches) are
important because I can see how
the girls do under pressure."
Hill also said the intrasquad
matches offered the Card women
stiffer competition by playing
their teammates than the women
have encountered since the Ojai
tourney, April 22-25.
As Hill said, "We haven't re
ally played a good match in a
long time."

lacks the depth the Cards pos
sess.
In their last meeting, Stanford
beat UCLA 8-1 with the Cards'
No. 1 woman Lele Forood suffer
ing the only loss. Smith beat
Forood in three sets 6-7,6-4,6-3.
Forood, who missed practice
Wednesday due to a mild case of
the flu, hopes to beat Smith in
this meeting.
"When we played at UCLA it
was very windy and she (Smith)
played incredibly well," Forood
recalled. "It came down to a
couple of points in the last set.
That's been the story of all my
losses this year."
The Cards' biggest threat will
come in No. 1 doubles when
Smith and Thomas team against
Forood and Barb Jordan.
Four titles
The UCLA duo has won four
tournament titles this year —
Ojai Doubles Open Division,
Southern California Sectionals,
Southern California Women's
Intercollegiate Conference and
the Arizona Invitational. They
racked up 19 straight doubles
victories on their way to the
tournament titles.
Against the Bruins, Forood
will play No. 1 singles and Liza
Pande will be the No. 5 slot. Hill
said she had yet to set the re
maining lineup, but stated that
Jordan, Hagey and Diane Morri
son will also play singles.
This week, Jordan, Hagey,
Morrison and Marcy O'Keefe

played a round robin to aid Hill
in deciding which three will go
to the U.S. Tennis Association's
Collegiate Nationals next
month.
Forood guaranteed
The Cards will send four sing
les players, with Forood already
guaranteed a berth. The results
of the round robin are puzzling.
Hill said. She pointed out that
Jordan, the No. 2 player this year,
lost her three matches.
However, Hill praised the
round robin matches, saying
they were "invaluable as a type
of practice. You can't imitate
match competition in practice.
"After playing these, we can
sit down and analyze the game.
They (round robin matches) are
important because I can see how
the girls do under pressure."
Hill also said the intrasquad
matches offered the Card women
stiffer competition by playing
their teammates than the women
have encountered since the Ojai
tourney, April 22-25.
As Hill said, "We haven't re
ally played a good match in a
long time."

Tomorrow's match here
against UCLA should provide
the women's tennis team with its
tirst "competitive" contest in a
month, according to Card coach
Anne Hill.
Play will begin on the Varsity
Courts at 1 p.m.
Coing into tomorrow's
matches, the Stanford women
are unbeaten in eight dual en
counters, while UCLA has a re
cord of 17-2. The Bruins' two
losses came against Stanford and
Arizona State.
Hill called the UCLA squad
"one of the top five teams in the
country" and cited the Bruins'
top two netters, Paula Smith and
Cindy Thomas, as the Cards'
toughest opponents.
In the 1975 junior rankings.
Smith was ranked third in pr >'
18 doubles with partner
Hagey (now a Card).
