Tuning up for the NCAA
Championships, which begin
June 9, the men's golf team beat
the Pebble Beach All-Stars
Tuesday, 14-13, in a match at
Monterey.
Recalling the Cards' showing
in 1975, coach Bud Finger said,
"We missed the first cut by only
one stroke, being beaten out by

Houston. That placed us 17th in
the nation."
According to Finger, however,
the tournament will consist of
three rounds before the initial
cut. He feels that had the Cards
made the two-round cut last year
they might have been able to
finish in the top 10.
Things have changed over this
year. Stanford's squad a year ago
was an older team, and Finger
admits that this year's squad is
less experienced than last year's
team of five.
The five
Just who are the five who will
make the trip to New Mexico?
Well, according to Finger,
Mike Peck, Glenn Goethals and
lay Johnston will automatically
make the trip with the other two
spots decided in the playoff bet
ween Bruce McDonald, Wade
Nonnenberg and Kim Cater.

At the halfway point of the
six-round playoff, McDonald led
with a three-round total of 227,
while Nonnenberg and Cater
had 229 and 237, respectively.
Along with the team's na
tional standing, the Ail-
American hopes of Peck and
Johnston also ride on the
NCAAs.
"I'm sure that the two will
make some team," said Finger,
"but it'stoo bad that the two mis
sed their chances in the last two
tournaments."
Top three
According to Finger, Peck has
a chance to make first team All-
American but probably must
place in the top three at NCAAs.
Peck last year finished 18th in
the nation.
Against the All-Stars, it took
strong performances from fifth
and sixth men Cater, 80, and
Mark Mcßride, 77, to bring Stan
ford back from a 11 -7 deficit to a
14-13 win.
Cater and Mcßride each won
their individual matches by
identical 2V2-V2 scores.
McDonald, 76, turned in the
other match win while Nonnen
berg tied his opponent at 76.
Ex-Stanford golfer Conrad
Nielmeyer played for the Pebble
Beach All-Stars and was pitted
against No. 2 man Coethals.
Nielmeyer squeaked by with a
two-stroke match win.
