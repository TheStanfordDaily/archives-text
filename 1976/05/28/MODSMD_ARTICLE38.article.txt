# Men lead net NCAAs; undefeated in singles
## 
### Paul Bauman 
Things look very good for the
men's tennis team and very dim
for UCLA in the 1976 NCAA
Championships at Corpus
Christi, Tex.
The Cards lead all teams with
18 points and have placed all
four of their singles players in
today's round of 16. USC is close
behind Stanford with 16 points,
while UCLA, on the verge of
being knocked out of serious
contention, is third with 13
points. Trinity's 12 points put
the Tigers in fourth place.
Stanford, shooting for its third
national title in four years, has
lost only two singles sets in ad
vancing through the first three
rounds.
Matt Mitchell has looked as
impressive as any of the Cards so
far. Yesterday, the freshman de
feated llth-seeded John Lucas of
Maryland in thethird round, 6-4,
6-1.
Nichols gets whipped
In other third-round matches,
Card senior Pat DuPre, the tour
nament's fourth seed, whipped
UCLA's Bruce Nichols. 6-0, 6-2;
Stanford's Bill Maze, the ninth
seed, came from behind to beat
Chris Gunning of Pepperdine,
6-7, 6-1, 6-1; and Card captain
Mark Mitchell defeated 16th
seeded Joe Meyers from San Jose
State, 6-3, 6-4.
None of the Cards had much
trouble in the first two rounds
Wednesday against a group of

fairly obscure opponents. DuPre
defeated Phil Chamberlain of
Memphis State. 6-1, 4-6, 6-1. and
then Dave Presslv of Florida, 6-2.
7-5.
Matt Mitchell beat Tom Von
Dohlen of Georgia, 6-3, 6-0, and
then crushed Richardo Eynaudi
of Pan American, 6-0, 6-0. Maze
eliminated Terry Saunders of
Oklahoma City. 6-4.6-4. and An
tonio Hartmann from Pan
American, 6-3, 6-2.
Mark Mitchell defeated Scott
Dillon of North Carolina State,
6-3, 6-0, and then edged Tim
Creenberg of Utah, 7-6, 6-4.
Critical matches
Today's singles matches are
critical for the leading teams as
all players but the elite are gone.
Each of Stanford's men will be
facing seeds.
Maze has drawn Peter Flem
ing of UCLA, the top seed, and
Mark Mitchell meets UCLA
All-American Ferdi Taygan.
DuPre goes against No. 10 seed
Steve VVedderburn of Oklahoma
City and Matt Mitchell takes on
eighth-seeded Jaoa Soares of
Pepperdine.
One of Stanford's two doubles
teams is still alive and faces
the round of 16 today.
DuPre and Maze, the third
seeds, topped Scott Smith and
Jack Webb of Kentucky, 6-0, 1-6,
6-3, in the first round and Tom
Mull ins and Kent Crawford of
Utah in the second, 6-1, 6-4, to
earn a shot at the quarterfinals.

Matt Mitchell and Perry
Wright, seeded seventh, were
polished off in the opening
round by YVedderburn and
Dennis Morgan, 6-4, 6-2.
Minimal damage
Whereas Stanford has sur
vived the first three rounds with
a minimum of damage, the ros
ters of UCLA, USC and Trinity
have been pretty well depleted.
UCLA has two singles players,
Fleming and Taygan, and one
doubles team still in the tourna
ment.
Second-seeded Brian Teacher,
who wasn't supposed to play be
cause of a pulled muscle in his
right shoulder, was upset in the
first round by Cary Albertine of
Louisiana State, 6-3, 7-5.
Teacher took a 5-1 lead in the
second set, but dropped the next
six games and the match.
USC has both its doubles
teams left, but only one singles
man, third-seeded Bruce Man
son. Trinity's sole remaining
representative is Bill Scanlon.
In other tennis news from
Corpus Christi, DuPre won the
Rafael Osuna Award, the highest
honor given to a college player.
The award goes to the player
"best exemplifying sportsman
ship, competitive ability and
contribution to tennis." Candi
dates were nominated by players
and the winner was selected by a
coaches' committee.
