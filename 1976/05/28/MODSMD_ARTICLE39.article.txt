# Mayan ball strikes campus

"1 think this is the first time this game's
been played since the 1700s," said Asst. An
thropology Prof. Ezra Zubrow at Wilbur Field
Thursday afternoon.
Zubrow, who teaches the class "Great Sites
and Lost Peoples," was talking about the
Mayan ball court game in which the "shirts"
team, composed mainly of Lambda Nudies,
won, 6-4, as Marc "Mayan" Judson tallied the
winning goal.
Mayan ball court game is played, at least at
Stanford, with a soccer ball and combines
Ultimate Frisbee and soccer rules. The ball
must be moved soccer-style in two "end
zones" where goals are made by kicking the
ball through any of the three goals at that end
zone.
In the middle "fairway," the ball is passed,
but players can't run with the ball. Game

winning goals are made by punting the ball
through hoops on the sides of the fairway.
In real Mayan games, scorers were exe
cuted as a reward for these goals, but no Stan
ford players were skilled enough to make
points that way.
"I was pleased with the way we played,"
said Judson after the game. "However we've
got a lot of improvement before we go to the
Nationals in Mazatlan."
The players said they are also making plans
for next year's season. A 20-foot high wall is
allegedly scheduled to go up in Stanford
Stadium this summer, and the coaches said
they are already excited about some recruits
coming up from Central America for next
year.
The game was organized by "Great Sites"
members Kristie Habbard and Hallie Katz as
a class project.

I HE LATEST CRAZE — A Mayan ball court game took over Wilbur Field yesterday afternoon.
The game, a blend of soccer and Ultimate Frisbee, saw the "shirts" beat the "skins," 6-4. Here,
Mark Whiting (far left) passes off to Ron Beck (far right). Mark Mcßride, Scott Setrakian and Ed
Geary (1. to r.) look on. The ring in front serves as a special goal — a kicked shot through it is an
automatic game-winner.
