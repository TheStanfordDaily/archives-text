### Dan Fiduccia Stephen Crolius 
The Delta Tau Delta (Delt) fraternity has been suspended from using its
on-campus house for at least three years. Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton announced yesterday.
The suspension stems from a May 19 incident when 15 Delts and 12 friends
trashed four other fraternity houses after a bachelor party for a Delt at the Delt
house.
University judicial charges have also been brought against 12 students in
volved in the incident for violating the University's Fundamental Standard,
Legal Adviser to the President James Siena said last night.
Three Delts have been expelled from both the chapter and the national
organization of that fraternity, Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) officials con-

firmed yesterday.
Three other Delts have been fined
$125 each and all other Delts who were
"simply present" at the May 19 oc
currences have been fined $50 each,
according to an IFC statement.
Horton, in his letter to Delt President
Art Estrada advising him of the sus
pension, said there was both indi
vidual and also "group accountability
of the Stanford residence from which
the marauders sallied forth" involved
in the incidents.
Horton said if the matter at hand
were "a first offense by a residence
group, the gravity would still be very
great and the matter might result in the
termination of group residence
privileges."
'Chronic offender'
Horton continued, "But we are not
dealing with a first offense. Delta Tau
Delta in recent years has been a
chronic offender."
Horton discussed the suspension of
the Delts in 1973-74 and the formal
probation of the house during 1974-75,
when "there were incidents within the
house."
The Delts were given written notice
in February 1975 concerning possi
ble University action if there were fu
ture incidents, according to Horton.
Delts explained to Horton after the
trashings that those most responsible
will be graduating, that pledges and
remaining members hold values con-
