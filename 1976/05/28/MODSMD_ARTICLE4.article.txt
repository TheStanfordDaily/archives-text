# Delts suspended for 3 years
## Horton boots fraternity after trashing episode 
### Dan Fiduccia Stephen Crolius 
The Delta Tau Delta (Delt) fraternity has been suspended from using its
on-campus house for at least three years. Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton announced yesterday.
The suspension stems from a May 19 incident when 15 Delts and 12 friends
trashed four other fraternity houses after a bachelor party for a Delt at the Delt
house.
University judicial charges have also been brought against 12 students in
volved in the incident for violating the University's Fundamental Standard,
Legal Adviser to the President James Siena said last night.
Three Delts have been expelled from both the chapter and the national
organization of that fraternity, Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) officials con-

firmed yesterday.
Three other Delts have been fined
$125 each and all other Delts who were
"simply present" at the May 19 oc
currences have been fined $50 each,
according to an IFC statement.
Horton, in his letter to Delt President
Art Estrada advising him of the sus
pension, said there was both indi
vidual and also "group accountability
of the Stanford residence from which
the marauders sallied forth" involved
in the incidents.
Horton said if the matter at hand
were "a first offense by a residence
group, the gravity would still be very
great and the matter might result in the
termination of group residence
privileges."
'Chronic offender'
Horton continued, "But we are not
dealing with a first offense. Delta Tau
Delta in recent years has been a
chronic offender."
Horton discussed the suspension of
the Delts in 1973-74 and the formal
probation of the house during 1974-75,
when "there were incidents within the
house."
The Delts were given written notice
in February 1975 concerning possi
ble University action if there were fu
ture incidents, according to Horton.
Delts explained to Horton after the
trashings that those most responsible
will be graduating, that pledges and
remaining members hold values con-
sistent with the University's, that
members involved had been discip
lined and that members were willing
to work to keep their house in good
standing.
Horton said last night, "1 think it's
clearly a matter of collective responsi
bility."
Thus, Horton wrote the Delts, "Delta
Tau Delta will not be permitted to exist
as a Stanford residence group for at
least three years."
Fraternity commitment
Horton emphasized in his letter that
"the University remains committed to
the maintenance of a healthy fraternity
system within the University resi
dence program, and we believe that
the current Delta Tau Delta is a
blemish on the entire fraternity sys
tem."
Siena said charges against 12 stu
dents were delivered to Dean of Stu
dent Affairs lames Lyons earlier this
week.
"That's all (of the students) that can
be identified at this time," said Siena.
The 12 students are charged with
violating the Fundamental Standard.
Depending on how the students
their cases will be heard by either
Lyons or the Stanford Judicial Council.
Those students fined $125 must for

feit $25. The $100 balance will be held
in abeyance as long as they are under
graduates. Those fined $50 will also
have the money held in abeyance, ac
cording to an IFC spokesman.
Horton said he had been advised of
the Delts' disciplinary actions before
reaching his decision.
Peter Sylvester, deputy director for
major gifts in the General Secretary's
Office, said the suspension is "bound
to make some (fraternity alumni) tem
porarily unhappy."
If the Delts were allowed to con
tinue, then all fraternities might suffer,
said Sylvester. "To keep a strong
fraternity system, it (the suspension)
may have been best."
Fundraising effect
Sylvester said alumni would want to
support the University if it shows it
will not tolerate these activities.
The IFC in its statement said "we
condemn acts of violence against per
sons and property at the University.
And judging by the (disciplinary) ac
tions it has already taken, so does Delta
Tau Delta."
The IFC also pointed out that these
disciplinary actions are "unpre
cedented in recent Stanford fraternity
history."
The IFC also said the Delt house
holds parties which assist athletic de
partment recruiting efforts.
Football coach Jack Christiansen
said last night, "I don't think it will
affect recruiting that much. At one
timea bunch of football players used to
beZetes. I don't think anyone comes to
Stanford because of the parties."
Horton told the Delts "all current re
sidents must vacate the premises at the
end of this quarter."
The house will be put into the wait

ing list program in August and then
into the Housing Draw next spring,
said Morton.
Horton also said Delts may petition
to return to their "current residence
beginning in the Autumn of 1979 . . .
between December 1, 1978, and
January 15, 1979."
A report prepared for Horton by
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson said damage at the Beta
Theta Pi house, one of those trashed,
included emptied fire extinguishers, a
hole in a wall, garbage spread on two
floors and widespread destruction in
one room.
The Delts lost their lease in 1973
after a series of incidents involving
rock and bottle throwing through
windows at Synergy and Theta Xi
houses and shooting BB guns at car
windows.
