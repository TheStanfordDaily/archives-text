# Ottmar leads Zetes to softball win
## 
### Rick Brand Linda Buddenberg 
Dave Ottmar, "the kid from
Gilroy," led Zeta Psi's "A"
league softball team to the IM
title yesterday. Ottmar's two to
wering homers to the left field
weeds accounted for all Zete
RBIs in their 4-3 triumph over
the Graduate School of Educa
tion (GSE).
When questioned about his
homers, Ottmar commented,
"The first one was better because
it was a three-runner."
With SteveGarvey-like play at
first base, Ottmar was'rated the
most valuable player by players
from both teams. "
After an explosive first inning
marked by GSE's first tally and
Ottmar's three-run blast, the
game became a pitching duel be
tween the Zete's Bob Allegrotti
and GSE's Rusty Slay.
GSE, led by second baseman
Paul Grippa and leftfielder Bob
Pruitt, looked like it was going to
break the game wide open in the
third. It loaded the bases with
one out after having scored one
already. The Zete cause was
saved however, by a diving
shoestring catch from center
fielder Scott "Wheels" Kirby.
"The game was over if I didn't
catch the ball," said Kirby, who
was acting as player-coach.
Other fielding gems were

turned in by the Zete leftfielder,
who made an over-the
shou lder-thru-t he-soccer-goal
frame catch of a GSE drive. (IM
field improvements should be
scheduled for next year.)
GSE scored again in the top of

the seventh, but Ottmar's second
round-tripper in the bottom of
the sixth had already put the
game out of reach.
The "B" league softball finals
will be held today at 5:30 p.m.,
on the IM fields. The Miracles,

having edged Alpha Sigma Phi,
will play The Ducks, who beat
the Emerson Muthas.
In the women's finals, the B
Bailers face either Lathrop or
Zapata in a contest on the 1M
fields at 6:30 p.m. today.
