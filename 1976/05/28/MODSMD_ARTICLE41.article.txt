# Diamonders add honors, mustaches at banquet

### Linda Buddenberg 
You can tell Stanford's
baseball season is over — the
players' mustaches, or attempts
thereof, are back.
Many of the Cards were sport
ing a new, hirsute look at a post
season awards banquet Wed
nesday night at Ming's Restaur
ant.
Senior Steve Davis didn't sur
prise anyone by picking up the
most valuable player award for
being, according to coach Ray
Young,a "leader both on and off
the field."
Pepe Hinojosa was finally re
warded for "doing a lot more
than driving the tractor around,"
Young said.
The left fielder learned he has
been named to the All-California
Intercollegiate Baseball Associa

tion team, and also received a
suitcase almost as big as himself
for being the most inspirational
Cardinal.
"How Pepe went, so did the
ballclub," said Young.
In a team that "just had to im
prove because they were so
young," Young named senior
Mike Williamson as the most
improved player.
While "everyone in this room
qualifies," for the best attitude
award, Young said, the honor
went to senior Gary Bei, for put
ting in "150 percent effort, even
on the last day of the season."
Larry Reynolds and Bruce
Walters won the most valuable
freshman player awards.
"Someday they'll both be most
valuable players," predicted

Young.
The Bruce Cameron award—
for excellence physically, men
tally and scholastically— went
to junior pitcher Bruce Davis.
The team presented Young,
"the director of Stanford
baseball," with a red director's
chair. Team captain Steve Davis
said the team wanted to give
Young the chair "to show our
esteem, and because the one in
the dugout is about to fal 1 apart."
Young then presented assis
tant coach Mark Marquess with a
lawn edger, so "he can do as wel 1
in his new home as he's done at
the Sunken Diamond."
Before any eyes could get too
misty, Young reminded
everyone but the seniors that fall
ball starts Oct. 1.
