# Coaches favor 'Pac-10'

The Pacific-10?
It may become a reality within
the next few years. The Pac-8
conference announced Tuesday
that it is investigating the possi
bility of expanding. UCLA
Chancellor Charles Young said
the conference has invited the
University of Arizona and
Arizona State to discuss mem
bership in the Pac-8.
Young, chairman of the Pac
-B's Presidents and Chancellors
Croup, has sent letters to the
presidents of both Arizona
schools to discuss the "possibil
ity and desirability" of joining
the Pac-8.
Stanford Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz said the proposal is just in
the "discussion stages." Ruetz
said, "We're going to exchange
information about academics
and ticket sales."
Denials
Pasadena Star News Sports
Editor Joe Hendrickson touched
off a flurry of denials last month,
when he said that the Pac-8 was
investigating expansion.
Ruetz said that he thought it
was good for the Pac-8 to move

the matter out into the open.
"You can't keep things like this a
secret."
Pac-8 Executive Director
Wiles Hallock said Stanford
President Richard Lyman was a
"major force" in making the an
nouncement public. "The presi
dents' group felt that the matter
should be studied in detail."
said Hallock, who served as
commissioner of the Western
Athletic Conference (WAC). of
which Arizona and ASU are
members, before coming to the
Pac-8.
But there are many problems
to be worked out. 'We'd have to
look at our 15-year schedules in
football," said Ruetz. Hallock
said one of the reasons the two
schools are being considered,
though, is that most of our mem
bers have scheduled Arizona
and Arizona State already."
Bowl contract
Bob Young, associate athletic
director here wondered whether
an expanded conference would
affect the Pac:-B's lucrative Rose
Bowl contract. "We'd have to
check this out with the Tourna
ment of Roses people and NBC,"

sand Young.
Hallock said expansion would
not effect the Rose Bowl televi
sion contract. "1 don't think NBC
and the Rose Bowl people would
be upset," said Hallock. who was
instrumental in securing NCAA
approval for the WAC's Fiesta
Bowl, which is played at
Arizona State.
Most Stanford coaches said
they would welcome the added
competition Arizona and ASU
would bring to the conference.
"They both have good football
programs." said Assistant Foot
ball Coach Pete Kattela. "Finan
cially it would help the league.
But I don't know how feasible it
would be. You might get a situa
tion like Houston." (It took the
Southwest Conference almost
eight years to work Houston into
the league.)
Second-ranked
"Between the two of them"
said Kattela, "I'm sure they play
at least half of the schools in the
Pac-8. ABC. announced recently
that it will kick off its foot
ball elecasts with the UCLA-
Arizona State clash on Sept. 7.
The Sun Devils, who knocked off

Nebraska in the Fiesta Bowl,
finished as the second-ranked
team in the nation.
Moving the two Arizona
schools into the Pac-B's cage
ranks would not be as difficult,
said Assistant Basketball Coach
Hob Frederick. "We're
scheduled two to three years in
advance." 1 he Qirds will take on
Arizona, which bowed to UCLA
in the NCAA Western Regional
Tournament this year.
"Certainly Arizona and
Arizona State have fine basket
ball programs and from my view
point they have pretty fine
overall programs," said Fre
derick.
Baseball coach Kay Young
thinks there is almost no possi
bility of ASU and Arizona,
which are nationally-ranked
baseball powers, being added to
form a west coast baseball as
sociation.
"In my opinion there's no
chance of this happening in
baseball. If you're talking about
having a round-robin schedule,
then you'll have to make two
trips to Arizona and that would
cost $5000-7000."
