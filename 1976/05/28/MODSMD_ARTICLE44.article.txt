Immunity for Hearst?
SAN FRANCISCO — Prosecutors in four northern
California counties have agreed informally to grant im
munity to Patricia Hearst in return for her testimony
against her former underground companions, the San
Francisco Chronicle reported yesterday.
"The lone holdout is Los Angeles where Hearst is
scheduled to be tried on 11 felony counts arising from a
shooting outsidea suburban sporting goods store in April
1974." the Chronicle said.
The newspaper said it learned the information from "a
high federal source."
The 22-year-old newspaper heiress was convicted here
two months ago of federal bank robbery charges and is
currently undergoing psychiatric evaluation in San Diego
pending final sentencing.
Hearst "has been given 'informal* grants of immunity by
Marin. Sacramento, San Francisco and Alameda coun
ties," the Chronicle said.
"The Chronicle's informant said Hearst might be called
as a witness while she is undergoing psychiatric evalua
tion," the newspaper said.
Tunney-Hayden debate set
LOS ANGELES — In a dramatic campaign encounter.
I J.S. Sen. John Tunney agreed yesterday to debate Democ
ratic primary challenger Tom Hayden after Hayden made
an apology to him in a face-to-face encounter.
The agreement came after Tunney asked Hayden at the
Los Angeles Press Club to apologize for comments he had
made and for comments made by Hayden's wife, Jane
Fonda.
Hayden, a former antiwar activist running against Tun
ney in the June 8 California primary for the Democratic
Senate nomination, retracted a comment he made about
Tunney in Fresno earlier in the campaign.
Hayden had said Tunney was "a Chappaquidick wait
ing to happen" — referring to the episode where Mary Jo
Kopechne died when the car she was riding in with Sen.
Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.J crashed into the ocean.
Tunney was making a speech at press club when
Hayden, who had scheduled a news conference there,
confronted her. The debate was tentatively set for June 4,
said Sam Hurst, a Hayden spokesman.
During their exchange, Tunney also asked Hayden to
apologize for misrepresenting his stands on the issues.
Tunney said Hayden did apologize, but Hurst said
Hayden's apology only covered the Fresno remark.
Syria, Israel extend U.N. peace force
DAMASCUS, Syria — Syria joined Israel yesterday in
approving a six-month extension of the United Nations
peacekeeping force separating their opposing forces on
the Golan Heights.
U.N. Secretary-General Kurt VValdheim announced
after meeting with Syrian President Hafez Assad that
"Syria has now given its consent to the prolongation . . .
without attaching any political conditions."
Israel announced last week it would agree to continuing
the 1194-man IJ.N'. Disengagement Observer Force (UN
DO!') beyond its scheduled expiration Monday, provided
no new political conditions were demanded.
VValdheim left Damascus for New York where a Security
Council meeting was scheduled for today to approve ex
tending the UNDOF mandate.
Waldheim told newsmen at Damascus airport that

Assad "is very keen to progress in the way of peace." He
said his talks with Assad, which began Wednesday, were
"very cordial and constructive." He added Assad asked
for "clarifications" on the Mideast situation, and wanted
"intensification of negotiations."
Slaying endangers Lebanese peace
BEIRUT — The slaying by unidentified gunmen of Mos
lem leftist leader Kemal Jumblatt's sister yesterday in a
Christian section of Beirut jeopardized new efforts at a
negotiated settlement of the Lebanese civil war.
Gunmen burst into the apartment of 55-year-old Linda
al-Atrash and killed her outright with a hail of bullets.
Police said her two daughters were seriously wounded by
the gunfire.
The killing brought at least a temporary halt to the
ef forts of Christian President-elect Elias Sarkis to get the
leftists to the negotiating table.
A hospital spokesman said of the elder daughter Noha,
27, that "medically, she is still alive, but her life is in great
danger."
The younger daughter, 18-year-old Samar, also was re
ported in critical condition.
Congressman calls for Hays' resignation
WASHINGTON — A fellow House member called on
Rep. Wayne Hays (D-Ohio) yesterday to resign his seat as a
move to restore public esteem for Congress.
"The only way I can see for the House to be relieved of
this ignominy ... is to have a dramatic act," said Rep.
Romano Mazzoli (D-Ky.) in a speech on the House floor.
Mazzoli said accusations from Elizabeth Ray, who said
she was Hays' mistress and was kept on the government
payroll solely to provide Hays with sexual favors, have
become a symbol of the public's general opinion of wide
spread corruption among elected public officials.
Hays first denied but later admitted having had a "per
sonal relationship" with Ray but said there was no con
nection between that and her congressional committee
staff job.
Guerrillas approach Rhodesian capital
SALISBURY, Rhodesia — Black guerrillas fighting
Rhodesia's white minority government have penetrated to
within 32 miles of Salisbury, their deepest thrust yet,
informed sources said yesterday.
Two of the guerrillas were shot and an African tribes
woman was killed in the crossfire after the gang evaded
military patrols and reached the nearby Mermaid's Port
resort this week, the sources said.
Military authorities have closed the three-year-old hotel
there, a popular weekend retreat for people from the capi
tal, but gave no official confirmation of guerrilla activity
in the area.
Neither the state-owned radio and television stations
nor the newspapers have reported the advance of
nationalist guerrillas operating from bases in neighboring
Mozambique.
