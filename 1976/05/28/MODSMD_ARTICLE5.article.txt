# IFC to rally against move
## 
### Stephen Crolius 
The Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
voted last night to hold a rally next
Tuesday in White Plaza protesting As
soc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry Mor
ton's decision to suspend the Delta
Tau Delta (Delt) fraternity from use of
the Delt house.
Ex-IFC President Bob Ottilie, who
proposed the rally, said that the IFC is
"going on the offensive."
Ottilie called for a show of fraternity
system solidarity, saying that "Hor
ton's decision displays callow disre
gard for the fraternity system."
He claimed that unless the fraternity
system acts now to oppose the deci
sion to suspend the Delts, Horton will
suspend other houses in the future "at
the drop of a pin."
Serious trouble
IFC Vice President Tom Gordon said
that "the implications of this action
(the suspension) could put the Zetes
(members of Zeta Psi fraternity) in
serious trouble."
Members of Zeta Psi allegedly
"trashed" the Roble tennis courts last
Friday.
Gordon also warned the IFC that the
Delt suspension could have adverse ef
fects on the three fraternity houses
which had not met their housing quota
10 days ago. It is not known whether
these houses have since met their
quota, according to IFC Rush Chair
man Tim Ferguson.
Gordon said that University actions
against the Delts and the Zetes could
open the way for houses to be "picked
off" by Horton.
Several fraternity representatives at
the meeting expressed support for the
Delts. Statements from two of the al
leged victims of the Delts' actions were
read.
Nauseation
John Olenchalk, a Delt living in the
Delta Upsilon (DU) house, whose room
was allegedly entered by several Delts,
wrote that "any animosity generated
against the Delts is exceeded by far by
my lack of respect for and nauseation
with the unrealistic response of Hor

ton and Co."
IFC President Jordan Schwartz, a
Delt, said only that he felt "it is neces
sary to decide what the IFC position is
(regarding the suspension)."
He declined to make any further
comment on the grounds that he has
too much "personal bias" in the matter
to speak objectively.
Schwartz admitted that because he
was along on the Delts* "raid." he will
pay the $50 fine levied by the Delts
against those present during the inci
dent.
"I will go before the SJC (Stanford
Judicial Council) if they want to prose
cute me for turning a garbage can right
side up and putting the garbage back
in," he said.
jurisdiction
Phi Delta Theta President Chad Hus
ton raised the question of whether I lor
ton has the power to suspend the Delts.
ASSU President Vic Petroff, a new
member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity,

said that he has discussed the matter
with Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons.
Although the Fundamental Stan
dard is probably not applicable to stu
dent groups, thereisa provision forthe
suspension in the lease for the Delts'
house, according to Petroff.
The house is owned by the Univer
sity.
Nonetheless, ASSU Sen. Brad Kre
voy, a Zete member, asserted that
"clearly Horton has superseded his
powers."
"It's our right to go to the SJC," he
said.
Patrick Kline, staff liaison between
the administration and the fraternities,
said that "there are several basic stan
dards of conduct which have clearly
been violated."
Morton's decision can be appealed to
Lyons, followed by President Richard
Lyman and finally the Board of Trus
tees, according to Kline.

"It's our right to go to the SJC," he
said.
Patrick Kline, staff liaison between
the administration and the fraternities,
said that "there are several basic stan
dards of conduct which have clearly
been violated."
Morton's decision can be appealed to
Lyons, followed by President Richard
Lyman and finally the Board of Trus
tees, according to Kline.
The Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
voted last night to hold a rally next
Tuesday in White Plaza protesting As
soc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry Mor
ton's decision to suspend the Delta
Tau Delta (Delt) fraternity from use of
the Delt house.
Ex-IFC President Bob Ottilie, who
proposed the rally, said that the IFC is
"going on the offensive."
Ottilie called for a show of fraternity
system solidarity, saying that "Hor
ton's decision displays callow disre
gard for the fraternity system."
He claimed that unless the fraternity
system acts now to oppose the deci
sion to suspend the Delts, Horton will
suspend other houses in the future "at
the drop of a pin."
Serious trouble
IFC Vice President Tom Gordon said
that "the implications of this action
(the suspension) could put the Zetes
(members of Zeta Psi fraternity) in
serious trouble."
Members of Zeta Psi allegedly
"trashed" the Roble tennis courts last
Friday.
Gordon also warned the IFC that the
Delt suspension could have adverse ef
fects on the three fraternity houses
which had not met their housing quota
10 days ago. It is not known whether
these houses have since met their
quota, according to IFC Rush Chair
man Tim Ferguson.
Gordon said that University actions
against the Delts and the Zetes could
open the way for houses to be "picked
off" by Horton.
Several fraternity representatives at
the meeting expressed support for the
Delts. Statements from two of the al
leged victims of the Delts' actions were
read.
Nauseation
John Olenchalk, a Delt living in the
Delta Upsilon (DU) house, whose room
was allegedly entered by several Delts,
wrote that "any animosity generated
against the Delts is exceeded by far by
my lack of respect for and nauseation
with the unrealistic response of Hor

ton and Co."
IFC President Jordan Schwartz, a
Delt, said only that he felt "it is neces
sary to decide what the IFC position is
(regarding the suspension)."
He declined to make any further
comment on the grounds that he has
too much "personal bias" in the matter
to speak objectively.
Schwartz admitted that because he
was along on the Delts* "raid." he will
pay the $50 fine levied by the Delts
against those present during the inci
dent.
"I will go before the SJC (Stanford
Judicial Council) if they want to prose
cute me for turning a garbage can right
side up and putting the garbage back
in," he said.
jurisdiction
Phi Delta Theta President Chad Hus
ton raised the question of whether I lor
ton has the power to suspend the Delts.
ASSU President Vic Petroff, a new
member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity,

said that he has discussed the matter
with Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons.
Although the Fundamental Stan
dard is probably not applicable to stu
dent groups, thereisa provision forthe
suspension in the lease for the Delts'
house, according to Petroff.
The house is owned by the Univer
sity.
Nonetheless, ASSU Sen. Brad Kre
voy, a Zete member, asserted that
"clearly Horton has superseded his
powers."

said.
