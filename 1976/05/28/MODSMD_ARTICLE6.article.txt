# Minority grad enrollment down
## 
### Geoff Samuels 
Total graduate and professional
school enrollment of ethnic minorities
this year fell slightly for the second
straight year. Dean of Graduate Studies
W. Bliss Carnochan said yesterday.
In a report released to the Faculty
Senate, Carnochan reported that there
were49l minority students enrolled in
1975, whilethereweres22 in 1974and
533 in 1973.
"The sharpest decline." Carnochan
wrote, "is almost entirely in black stu
dents; it is sharpest among black stu
dents in engineering."
Furthermore, "the most conspicu
ous" decrease in minority enrollment
is in the humanities, which registered
a drop from 22 enrolled in 1972 to five
in 1975.
Minority applications for the
academic degrees (as opposed to the
professional degrees of law, business
and medicine) dropped for the fourth
straight year. There were 322 applic
ants for the class entering this past fall,
compared with 496 applications in
1972.
Professional schools encouraging
"In the professional schools," Car
nochan wrote, "the situation is some

what more encouraging."
He reported 70 new enrollments in
the business, medicine and law
schools, compared with 71 in 1974, 80
in 1973 and 61 in 1972.
In contrast to the ethnic minorities,
"the proportion of women receiving
advanced degrees is up in every area
except engineering," the report noted.
The sharpest percentage increases
are in women receiving MBA, MD and
JD degrees.
Interpreting the data, Carnochan
wrote that "the statistical data on
minority admission strongly suggest
that the principal cause for low minor
ity enrollment in academic degree
programs is the small number of
applicants."
Establish goals
Suggesting methods to increase the
number of applicants, Carnochan
stressed the need to "establish affirma
tive action goals for applications."
"We plan to switch the emphasis in
the graduate division," he wrote,
"from general recruiting to specific ef
forts in cooperation with individual
departments and schools."
This would partly entail encourag
ing faculty to develop professional

contacts with colleagues in institu
tions with substantial enrollments of
ethnic minorities or women.
The goal is to "help develop the
applicant pool of outstanding minor
ity group students and women before
students enter their senior year," he
said.
Comparing the performance here
with comparable universities, Car
nochan found that "rough data ... in
dicate that Stanford is doing well, at
least relatively, in enrolling ethnic
minorities; and somewhat less well,
relatively, in enrolling women."
While the data only apply to schools
of humanities and sciences and their
equivalents, only the University of
Chicago, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) and Princeton Uni
versity have a higher enrollment per
centage of blacks.
The University is second to Yale
University in the percentage of
Spanish-American students enrolled
while only Brown University has a
higher percentage of native Ameri
cans.
However, in the enrollment of wo
men, the University ranks seventh of
the 10 universities compared.
