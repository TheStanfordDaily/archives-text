# Most students Y-A-W-N at 'Campaign '76' program

Student political loaders here have
mixed reactions on student response
to "Campaign '76: Presidential
Perspectives," the week-long political
orientation program sponsored by the
Stanford Committee on Political Edu
cation (SCOPE).
"1 was really pleased with the turn
out during the week." said SCOPE
Co-chairperson Lisa Foster. "I think
that attendance, except for Thursday
night (a forum for the candidates' rep
resentatives), was excellent."
Foster added that students are "not
totally apathetic, but voting is the ex
tent of their involvement." The pur
pose of SCOPE and its program is to
"encourage activism," said Foster, "so
that students realize their political ac
tivities mean something."
Hrad Krevoy another SCOPE co

chairperson, disagreed with Foster.
"Stanford students are very apathe
tic," said Krevoy, but "there is a poten
tial for them to lose that apathy."
He noted that voter turnout for the
straw ballot election ran close to the
average turnout for an ASSU Senate

election, and that average attendance
at each event was "about 200 people."
"We made a dent in student political
awareness," said Krevoy. "When we
were polling in the dorm dining
rooms, everywhere we were, people
were talking about the primaries and

presidential campaigns. Before, they
weren't even talking."
"SCOPE is still new and it's not that
well known," Krevoy said, "but the
concept is one that students can really
benefit from."

Kent Thiry, former campus rep
resentative for former Georgia Gov.
Jimmy Carter, agreed with Krevoy that
apathy is a problem, but refused to
limit it to students here.
"I think all students are (apathetic),"
said Thiry, pointing out the difference

between the number of students regis
tered to vote and those who actually
show up at the polls.
Voter turnout is "about half of what
it is for any other age group," he said.
"Students just don't feel they can make
a difference."
Thiry called the SCOPE program
"moderately successful. The crowds
were disappointing," he said, "but
they got more information than they
would have otherwise."
A campaign worker for Rep. Morris
Udall (D-Ariz.), Keith Ehrrnan, also
questioned the impact of "Campaign
76."
"It only reached the people who
were interested in politics in the fitst
place," commented Ehrman. He added
that the "people who went out of their
way" to attend were those already in
volved in individual campaigns.

Many students who are not actively
involved in specific campaigns were
"just too busy" to attend the week's
events, according to several under
graduates.
The lack of publicity and end-of
the-quarter scholastic pressures were
common explanations for most stu
dents' avoidance of forum discussions
and the straw ballot election.
However, a crowd of over 350
people packed into Annenberg Au
ditorium Friday night for a screening
of the movie The Candidate, which
featured Robert Redford in the title
role.
"We may have to entice students to
have at least a modicum of political
awareness," admitted Foster. "Hut we
did generate publicity. Hopefully, it
will make some difference in the gen
eral election."
