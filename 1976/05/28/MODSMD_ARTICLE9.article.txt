# Coffee House gets OK from health officials
## 
### 
University health officials have
given the Tresidder Coffee House "a
clean bill of health" following the re
moval of food damaged in a fresh water
pipe leak found May 6, according to
Tresidder Food Services (TDS) man
ager Bob Caselli.
Water from the leak, which Caselli
said came "essentially from the
plumbing of a sink in a restroom
above" the Coffee House, filtered
down into the refrigerator in the re
staurant's kitchen.
Caselli said TDS contacted Univer
sity Insurance/Risk Management
Safety and Health Specialist Harold
Wilson immediately after the leak was
discovered. He later examined the area
for building and health code viola
tions, Caselli said.
"They (health officials) were en
tirely satisfied with our remedial re
pairs," Caselli said. "A great many
products were thrown away — a large
amount of meat and cheese," Caselli
said.
"Since the leak was from a domestic
water line, there was not any violation
of the building code as was originally
thought," Wilson said.
"There was actually a very insig
nificant amount of damage — there
was no gross contamination of food
stuffs, and of course much (food) was
disposed of," he added.
Caselli said the leak was "initially
thought to be a break in the sewage
system." When the actual source was
discovered, Caselli said,"it was not as
bad as it could have been, yet we still
threw out a lot of food not to take any
chances."
The Coffee House served food dur
ing the repair period, Coffee House
Asst. Manager Heidi Crose said. "Not
all our suppliers could deliver by the
next day," she said, "but we managed
to get everything in our regular supply
back to normal by the following
week."
Coffee House Manager Malcolm
Young said he did not know the tech
nical nature of the repairs, but said re
staurant employes have "been assured
that it won't happen attain."
