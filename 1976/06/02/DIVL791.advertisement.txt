Thank you
Thank you to all of the
Daily staff, (business and
editorial) and ASSU typeset
ting staff that have helped to
make this volume possible
and enjoyable. Many people
have put in long hours of in
tense work over the past four
months. They've taken pride
in their jobs and have come
up with some intelligent sol
utions to tough problems.
Personally, I will never
forget the support and under
standing I have received from
both staffs as an all-too
human editor. The cynical
humor, the late meals, the
reassuring talks â€” these have
all been part of my Stanford
experience, and I am grateful.
i wish luck to John Freed,
my successor, and I am confi
dent he will continue to im
prove the somehow never
perfect product we all read.
