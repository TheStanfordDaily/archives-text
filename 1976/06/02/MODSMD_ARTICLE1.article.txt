Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) representatives col
lected 485 signatures supporting the suspended frater
nity Delta Tau Delta (Delts) at a rally yesterday organized
on behalf of the Delts.
New steps were also taken yesterday in the prosecu
tion of individuals involved in the alleged disturbances
on May 19.
Seven of the 12 cases against individual students have
been dropped, and another student has been charged
with violating the Fundamental Standard, according to
Legal Adviser to the President James Siena.
Siena said 'it appears that they (the six students) will
be going before the SJC (Stanford Judicial Council)."
The Daily estimated attendance at the noon event in
White I'laza to have been about 4!io.
Copies of a letter addressed to Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons were distributed with a space left blank for a
signature.
Meeting
The 4H5 signed letters were then presented to Lyons at
a meeting attended by Inter-Fraternity Alumni Council
(IFAC) representatives, IFC representatives, Delt mem
bers. Lyons. Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton
and Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Norm Robinson.
"The first line of discussion (at the meeting)," accord

ing to an IFC source, "was along the due process ques
tion: did the (Delt) house receive due process when the
decision was made?"
"What the alumni (representatives) were interested in
was setting up some sort of process for these problems in
the future and possibly this situation," the source said.
"Most of the talking was done by the alumni," Lyons
admitted.
"Just prior to the meeting the officers of the Delts
presented a written appeal of the decision.to me," Lyons
said.
Delt member Kevin McDermott explained what action
was taken by the Delts to make amends for the "raid."
according to the source.
'Not aware'
"The University was not aware" of many of the actions
taken by the Delts against their own members, the source
said. "The University impression was that the alumni
(IFAC) were not contacted until Tuesday." when in fact
they were contacted on the Thursday after the distur
bance, the source said.
"Some positive action is going to be taken with regard
to the general situation," the source added, but Lyons
"did not leave us optimistic that the decision would be
changed.'''
