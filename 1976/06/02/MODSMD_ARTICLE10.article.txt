# USE, University will battle
## 
### Bill Sing News Analysis 
Anybody sticking around or
visiting the Stanford scene this
summer should find it worth
while to follow what is promis
ing to be a hard-fought battle be
tween two formidable "teams,"
each taking the field hoping to
"score" favorably over the other
in their many anticipated
matchups over the next few
months.
The "teams" in this strange
battle are the contract negotiat
ing team of the United Stanford
Kmployees (USE), and opposing
them, a team of University offi
cials. The "field" will be at some
negotiating table. The event is
t he bargai ni ng process for a new
contract for the union's 1400
maintenance, technical and
service workers with theUniver
sity. The current contract ex
pires August ') 1, but still no date
has been set for I he official open
i n<> matchup.
There is a "striking" re
semblance in this year's trading
of preliminary accusations and
counter accusations to those
of two years ago, when a three
week long strike finally ended in
an initial agreement on the soon
expiring current contract. Hack
then the battle had the makings
more of a David and Co! iafh con
frontation, with a new and small
union trying to make headway
against the large university es
tablishment. Then the union
ended up getting a lot less than it
had originally demanded, but in
the two years since it has become
<1 much more powerful force to
be reckoned with.
• So far the union has initially
demanded major pay and be
nefits improvements, ranging
from $1858 retroactive cost-of
living payments for each worker

in the bargaining unit to a new
minimum pay level of $774 per
month, considerable increases
in workers' health and pension
plans, plus numerous other
changes.
Chief "play-caller" for the
union negotiating team, USE
President Jim Berk, has accused
the University of maintaining its
same insensitive and intolerant
attitude toward the union,
which has led to the major dif
ficulties of the past two years.
Union officials threaten the 'in
evitability" of a strike should the
University fail to recognize the
union's major contract demands.
Meanwhile, University chief
counsel for employe relations
Douglas Barton, the University's
chief play-caller, has labeled the
union's demands "clearly un

reasonable."
Both sides do agree that if their
differences are not resolved, a
strike is very likely.
Cooperation has been hard to
come by so far this year. Back in
January when the University
laid off USE Vice President
Reynolds from his machinist job
at 1 lansen Labs, due to what they
called a "belt-tightening effort."
the union responded with ac
cusations of foul-play and
"union-busting" tactics on the
part <jf the University. Sub
sequently, union members pro
tested by carrying signs and
placards in front of Encina Hall
and the Old Pavilion, and the
University charged the union
with illegal picketing.
Both sides have sued each
other for unfair practices. In fact

several days-after USE filed a suit
against the University for failing
to carry out arbitration proce
dures according to the contract,
theUniversity countered with its
own suit against USE, alleging
the union had illegally forced
three workes to become union
members. Both cases are still
pending decision.
To complicate matters, Berk
has also to contend with dissent
within the union. A petition cir
culating within the bargaining
unit aimed at calling a decertifi
cation election could effectively
alter the union's bargaining pos
ition if successful.
No one reasonably expects the
University to give in to all the
union's initial demands. But
then again, no one expected
David to beat Goliath.

expiring current contract. Hack
then the battle had the makings
more of a David and Co! iafh con
frontation, with a new and small
union trying to make headway
against the large university es
tablishment. Then the union
ended up getting a lot less than it
had originally demanded, but in
the two years since it has become
<1 much more powerful force to
be reckoned with.
• So far the union has initially
demanded major pay and be
nefits improvements, ranging
from $1858 retroactive cost-of
living payments for each worker

in the bargaining unit to a new
minimum pay level of $774 per
month, considerable increases
in workers' health and pension
plans, plus numerous other
changes.
Chief "play-caller" for the
union negotiating team, USE
President Jim Berk, has accused
the University of maintaining its
same insensitive and intolerant
attitude toward the union,
which has led to the major dif
ficulties of the past two years.
Union officials threaten the 'in
evitability" of a strike should the
University fail to recognize the
union's major contract demands.
Meanwhile, University chief
counsel for employe relations
Douglas Barton, the University's
chief play-caller, has labeled the
union's demands "clearly un

reasonable."
Both sides do agree that if their
differences are not resolved, a
strike is very likely.
Cooperation has been hard to
come by so far this year. Back in
January when the University
laid off USE Vice President
Reynolds from his machinist job
at 1 lansen Labs, due to what they
called a "belt-tightening effort."
the union responded with ac
cusations of foul-play and
"union-busting" tactics on the
part <jf the University. Sub
sequently, union members pro
tested by carrying signs and
placards in front of Encina Hall
and the Old Pavilion, and the
University charged the union
with illegal picketing.
Both sides have sued each
other for unfair practices. In fact

several days-after USE filed a suit
against the University for failing
to carry out arbitration proce
dures according to the contract,
theUniversity countered with its
own suit against USE, alleging
the union had illegally forced
three workes to become union
members. Both cases are still
pending decision.
To complicate matters, Berk
has also to contend with dissent
within the union. A petition cir
culating within the bargaining
unit aimed at calling a decertifi
cation election could effectively
alter the union's bargaining pos
ition if successful.
No one reasonably expects the
University to give in to all the
union's initial demands. But
then again, no one expected
David to beat Goliath.
