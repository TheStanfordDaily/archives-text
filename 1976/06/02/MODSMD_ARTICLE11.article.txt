# Senate ends year of management and reform
## 
### Lori Matsukawa News Analysis 
The ASSIJ Senate ended its term last Monday night
with little fanfare; At its most well-attended meeting in
two quarters, the 15 senators who showed up for the
meeting finished off old business and ended a year that
can be best summed up as one dedicated to taking care
of run-of-the-mill ASSU management and planning re
form measures for future senates.
"We are merely a legislative body," Senate Chairper
son Bill Hoke once said, implying quite correctly that
the senate's purpose was to see to the proper manage
ment of ASSU committees, projects and funds.
Some of the more successful projects approved and
carried out by the senate include the initiation of a night
shuttle-bus service between on-campus dormitories
and campus libraries and the approval of two guest
professorships for Angela Davis and Claude Steiner.
There was some attempt by the senate to investigate
the possibility of changing the University parking sys
tem and placing students on departmental budget
committees. These investigations however, have not
blossomed into plans of action and have instead been
pushed into the kettle for keeping until next year.

I he uproar generated by the school mascot and Big
Game Bonfire issues can be looked upon with some
amusement. As of now, there is still no official mascot.
The senate has instead recommended that those who
want to use a certain name (i.e., Robber Barons) should
simply use it and, in that way, establish its validity.
Plans are under way within the Inter-Fraternity Council
tor next year's Bonfire despite this year's protest by en
vironmentalists of the fire's polluting effects.
Despite its sparse list of "achievements" as rep
resented by established projects, the senate deserves
credit for dedicating much of its energies to critical
introspection in an effort to make government run more
smoothly.
The Senate Finance Committee, under chairperson
Sen. Kevin McDermott, should be especially noted for
its handling ot all senate financial requests from Uni
versity interest groups.
By interviewing all groups that desired senate fund
ing prior to senate meetings, the Finance committee
saved the senate from prolonged debates on funding
from those groups.
Hoke has written many letters to the senate suggest

ing amendments to the senate by-laws concerning the
conduct of senate meetings so that debate will be
smooth and conducive to efficient decision-making.
Most of the controversies that surrounded the senate
this year were over constitutional irregularities. The
senate's approval of amendments to the constitution
legitimizing theStanford Judicial Council (SJC) despite
the lack of a 2/3 student body approval, challenged the
senate's vacillating adherence to its constitution.
The senate, in approving a resolution that ordered the
Publications Board to give $145U to the ASSIJ Course
Guide, raised the ire of Council of Presidents (COP)
head Vic Petroff, who pointed out that first, funds can
only be allocated through senate bills and second, that
as an ASSU Project, the Course Guide should receive
funds from the senate and not from the Publications
Board. At its last meeting, the senate did approve a
$1450, low-interest load for the Course Guide and did
not consider reinstating the Publications Board order.
While the senate can be accused of not crusading for
many new projects, it cannot be accused of ignoring its
normal in-house duties or not taking itself seriously.
The introspective re-evaluation of this year's senate will
indeed be useful to the senates to come.
