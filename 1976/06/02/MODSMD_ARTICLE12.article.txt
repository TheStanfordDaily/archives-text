# SJC underworked during its first year
## 
### Ann Amioka News Analysis 
Now nearing the end of the
first year of its revised existence,
the Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC) has so far heard only one
case and has a second pending .it
the hearing officer stage.
The student majority on the
SJC. in honor code cases appa
rently has not moved students to
choose the SJC route instead of
going before Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons, even though a
student must admit his guilt he
fore Lyons will hear the case.
Out of 17 students charged
with Honor Code, violations,
only one chose to go to the S)C.
This is the second which is still
pending.

In the first case, the student
had no choice but to go to the SJC
because of procedures outlined
in the Student Conduct Penalty
Code. This case involved a
former undergraduate who was
petitioning for an end to the in
definite suspension placed upon
that student in 1972.
The scarcity of cases for the
SJC is neither new nor astonish
ing. In the last two years of the
Campus Judicial Panel (created
by President Richard Lyman in
1971 when the ASSU Senate re
fusd to appoint members to the
SJ(I in protest of the non-student
majority), most of the students
charged with violating campus
rules had chosen to go before
Lyons.
Lyons said he did not know
exactly why this is so. but noted
that several reasons are often gi
ven. These include allegations
that going before Lyons rather
than the seven-member SJC is "a
little less complicated" and
"quicker."
As long as most of the cases
that come up involve alleged
I lonor Code violations, chances
are that the present trend toward
little work for the SJC] will con
tinue. Hut the SJC may see action
soon.
Last week 12 students were
charged with violating the Fun
damental Standard during the
trashings of at least three frater
nities-by members of the Delta
Tau Delta fraternity and their
friends.
Also up in the air is the fate of
the band members who partici
pated in a brief serenade inside
the Meyer Undergraduate Lib
rary on Mav 24.
