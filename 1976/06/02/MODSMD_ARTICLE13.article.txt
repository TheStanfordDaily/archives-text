# Rosenbaum COP's student advocacy evaluated
## 
### Rosario Delatorre News Analysis 
Lee Rosenba urn's Council of
Presidents (COP), now out of of
fice, agrees with its opponents
that the lack of student interest
and the lack of any major issues
was responsible, at least in part,
for the lack of effectiveness of
that COP.
The former COP blames the
lack of student interestfor its dif
ficulty in getting projects ac
complished. They found that
without issues that were close to
the students, students have no

interest in how the University
operates.
Where the two factions differ
is how this problem should be
dealt with. Rosenbaum's group
claims it attempted to increase
input from the students, while
opponents claim the COP was
removed from students' view
points.
ASSU Sen. Dan Livingston
says he felt the COP was un
realistic in this belief that they
would have student support for
their proposals. He also accuses
the COP of not seeking the ad

vice of the ASSU Senate or of
using an effective means to de
termine students' views, such as
a referendum.
Former COP members point
out that they established a
Communication Committee to
increase interaction with stu
dents through dorm representa
tives. They also claim that they
informally received input from
the different groups that each
COP member dealt with.
The effectiveness of these
channels has been questioned by
opponents as well as by mem

bers of the Communication
Committee. Opponents say the
channels did not foster represen
tation. Rosenbaurn's COP was
accused of being of one political
orientation, therefore, foes say.
those it chose to deal with shared
similar views.
Members of the Communica
tion Committee felt it was not as
much a vehicle for input to the
COP as it could have been and
that its composition was not rep
resentative of the student popu
lation. Members were also ac
cused of presenting only COP

views.
Livingston cites the bonfire
issue as one case where t he COP
did get involved but then mis
judged student sentiment. In the
"Indian" mascot issue, he
claims. Rosenbaum overstepped
his authority in demanding Palo
Alto stores not sell "Indian"
stickers.
"They (COP) alienated .1 lot of
people with the bonfire and 'In
dian' decisions: that hurt them
for the rest of the year."
Livingston notes.
Relations between the COP

and the ASSU Senate were also
strained, and some even claim
they were nonexistent. Critics of
the COP claim that COP mem
bers refused to attend senate
meetings and had no reports for
the senate when they did.
Former ASSU Vice President
|osie Jaramillo says that three
COP members were at most se
nate meetings and that sum
maries of their activities were
presented. She also notes that it
was difficult to work with the
senate because it did not meet
frequently enough and claimed
that the senate was not a cohe
sive group to deal with.
The COP's stress was on advo
cacy. with most of their cam
paign "proposals" consisting of
long-range projects. COP mem
bers concede they probably
couldn't have been ac
complished in one year.
Opponents agree Rosen
baum's COP did lay the
groundwork for such projects as
a student member on the Hoard
of Trustees and getting more
student input on departmental
decisionmaking, but noted the
lack of any actual results.
"They were a lot of campaign
rhetoric and very little action."
Livingston says.
A camp of students feels that
student advocacy should not be

the exclusive role of the COP.
The ideal COP should be con
cerned both with immediate
goals for students us well as ad
vocates of long-range proposals,
they argue.
The COI\ which is paid from
student fees, should be con
cerned with providing tangible
results for the majority of its con
stituents. ASSU Sen. Hob Ottilie
feels.
The former COP disagrees
with the belief that it should
have devoted its energies to es
tablishing specific services for
students.
"It's a waste to elect people
vvith service.ideas: you don't
have to be elected to start up a
new student service." says
Rosenbaum.
The COP members admit that
they had become disillusioned
with their effectiveness during
their term of office. They explain
that when they went into office
they were naive about what they
could accomplish. Their prop
osals were therefore idealistic
and possibly too optimistic. To
ward the end of their term, COP
members say. they became cyni
cal about the degree of power the
ASSU had.
They had concluded that the
ASSU's power was limited to it
self.
