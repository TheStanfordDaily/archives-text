# Tenure issue lives again, and will grow
## 
### Andrew Leuchter News Analysis 
When first interviewed about
the tenure system last fall. Dean
ol Humanities and Sciences
llalsey Royden remarked with a
smile, "I thought the editor of
the Daily said that tenure was a
'dead issue' this year."
Hut by this spring, the con
troversy over appointments and
promotions was anything but
dead. On the night of his (.'lec
tion, ASSU President Vic Petroff
called evaluation of the tenure
system his slate's "number one
priority."
Why has tenure come to he
forefront of campus concerns?
Campus observers agree that no
new issues have arisen. The only
factor which has changed is the
I 'diversity's position on the sub
ject. As one faculty member put
it,"the administration is on the
defensive."
University administrators are
now going through a period
when they must seriously de
fend the quality of a Stanford
'.'ducation. With tuition ap
proaching $5000 a year, Stan
ford cannot afford the reputation
of an institution where teaching
skill is not valued. And such a
reputation began to spread this
year.
Teaching secondary
For the first time, Royden,
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Cibbs, and Vice Provost
for Faculty Affairs Arthur
Bienenstock went on the public
record saying that the quality of
a professor's teaching was a sec
ondary factor in tenure deci
sions. Royden and Cibbs
claimed that this was due to

"lack of standardized
mechanisms for the evaluation
of teaching"; Provost William
Miller then admitted on KZSU
that a Faculty Senate resolution,
calling for the development of
such mechanisms, had been ig
nored for two-and-a-half years.
Last quarter, it began to appear
that political considerations also
outweighed proven teaching
ability. Asst. Prof. Doug Daetz,
who was denied tenure by the
Department of Industrial En
gineering, claimed that he was
told by his department chair
man that lie was on the dean's
"troublemakers list." Daetz sub
sequently found that a "controv
ersial memorandum" he had au
thored was included in his
employment file without his
knowledge.
Early this quarter, the Univer
sity started trying to counter the
image of an unfair tenure pro
cess. which ignored student in
terests. Shortly after Miller ap
peared on KZSU, Royden sent a
memorandum to all department
chairmen in Humanities and
Sciences instructing them to
"focus attention on methods for
improving and evaluating teach
ing." In an additional memoran
dum, the dean declared his "in
tention to make 10 to 15
awards each spring" for superior
teaching.
But these moves did little to
quiet dissatisfaction with the te
nure process. One student leader
charged that Royden's teaching
awards "are selected by a panel
that is under the president's
thumb. They can't control who
gets the Cores (Award), so they
create a new set of awards and

give them to the people who are
going to get tenure anyway." At
least one professor shared this
sentiment: "It's obvious that
they did it to discredit the Cores
Award. Teaching awards at
Stanford won't mean anything
any more."
Foley
The complaints of faculty and
students intensified even more
this spring with the case of As
soc. Economics Prof. Duncan
Foley. Foley, rated an outstand
ing teacher by both graduates
and undergraduates in his de

partment. was denied promotion
by the economics faculty.
The protest which followed
the Foley decision the most suc
cessful class boycott in recent
times. Eighty-five percent of the
economics students refused to
attend classes during the
boycott. Many actively picketed
the classrooms.
But the furor over tenure will
not die down with the departure
of Duncan Foley. The events of
this year have served to forge a
coalition working to change the
tenure system. Undergraduates,

long concerned about the lack of
attention paid their education,
are being joined by graduate
students who realize that their
interests are suffering as well.
Faculty have started to air their
complaints about the process,
and many are coming out in
support of student complaints.
One administrator states that
members of the Hoard of Trus
tees have been expressing con
cern about the tenure process as
well. Just perhaps, with all this
pressure, the system will actu
ally change next year.
