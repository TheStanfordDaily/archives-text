## SCOPE'S efforts 
### 
We commend members of the Stanford Committee
on Political Education (SCOPE) for their week-long
presentation on "Campaign '76: Presidential Perspec
tives." Their efforts brought to campus a group of dis
tinguished and informative representatives of the pres
idential candidates and encouraged students to par
ticipate in this year's campaign activities.
In the midst of popularity contests and the usual
flood of campaign rhetoric, SCOPE attempted to draw
the attention of the University community to the perti
nent issues of the presidential campaign. We ap
preciate the time and energy devoted by its members to
present a non-partisan program of political education.
We are disappointed that the University community
did not take full advantage of this opportunity for
increasing its political awareness. An audience of only
75 people at an open forum, where such qualified
representatives as Assemblyman Willie Brown (D-San
Francisco) and David Brower, executive director of
Friends of the Earth spoke, demonstrates the political
apathy of students and faculty when compared to an
audience of over 350 persons who were at the screen
ing of the movie The Candidate.
We hope that before the June 8 primary and the
November election, members of the University com
munity find the time to examine the issues of every
campaign and the platforms of every candidate.
