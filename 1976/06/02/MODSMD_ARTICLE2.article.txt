The Zeta Psi(Zete)fraternity may be
suspended because of recent activities
of Zete members and pledges. Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton
announced yesterday.
Horton informed the Zetes that the
University is reviewing both the recent
alleged Zete trashing of the Roble ten
nis courts and the arrests of three Zete
pledges in Palo Alto on May 11, during
preparations for the Zete traditional
luau.
Horton told the Zetes, "Our review
of Zeta Psi is not yet completed, but it
is now clear that the withdrawal of re
sidence privileges is a conceivable
outcome."
Horton asked the Zetes for a reporl
on the tennis courts incident, "an
explanation of any indirect house re
sponsibility for the disturbing events
connected with the preparations for
the recent luau," and a report on what
internal disciplinary action the Zetes
are considering.
Horton had a meeting yesterday
with some of the frat members, includ
ing Zete President Brian Avery.
Horton termed the meeting "wholly
.satisfactory" and said it was "a good
response."
Avery said yesterday, "We will
make a concerted effort to write a re

sponse to prove to the University" that
the University has changed its posi
tion and is '.'cracking down hard on
fraternities."
Horton said "measures short of their
removal depend on this response."
Avery said the Zetes "in the future
will try to consider activities before
going through with them and will con
sider not whether they're traditional
but whether it's the right thing to do."
Avery agreed that the Zetes should
be held collectively responsible for ac
tions of their members "up to an ex
tent."
Horton has given the Zetes until
June 14 to respond.
