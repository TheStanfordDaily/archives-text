'Familiar forces'
President Richard Lyman's
reaction to the May 25 rally in
support of the Human Rights
Policy was shocking because it
side-stepped the issue of human
rights and denigrated those who
supported it as "a rather familiar
coalition of forces." In actual
fact, however, this rally showed
a coalition of forces that has not
been witnessed in recent years.
One might have expected
support from the Gay People's
Union, political forces such as
the Alliance for Radical Change,
David Harris, Pete McCloskey,
and the Black Student Union, as
well as the United Stanford
Employees. But what was truly
amazing was the support show
from quarters which tradition
ally have not been known to de
fend the rights of homosexuals.
All the rights of, among
others, their gay brothers and
sisters: Wendy Smith, the Asst.
Dean of Memorial Church, Rabbi
Mark Cartun from Hillel Found
ation, Faher Eugene Boyle from
St. Ann's, Jinx Stonestrom rep
resenting United Campus Chris
tian Ministry, Pastor Manfred
Bahmann from the Stanford
Lutheran Center and Miriam

Cherry from the Stanford Survi
val Ministry.
There has not been a single
issue in the recent past that was
strong enough to produce such a
spiritual unity among Jews,
Catholics and Protestants on this
sort of massive scale.
The question is: How is it pos
sible that an historian, like Ly
man, would both side-step the
real issue and overlook such a
significant change in the "famil
iar forces"?

Regarding President Richard
Lyman's remarks concerning the
march in support of the prop
osed human rights policy: I
think it interesting that our Pres
ident has chosen to attack those
who participated in the march as
"a rather familiar coalition of
forces," rather than address
himself to the issue of whether
such a policy should be im
plemented here. I regard this as
an attack ad hominem; an eva
sive (if not all too typical) re
sponse to the issue being raised
by some concerned students and
members of the faculty.
I also wonder how I, as a
freshman here, can be classed as
part of this "rather familiar coali
tion." I don't consider myself (or
the others who participated in
the march) to be someone who is
simply looking for a cause to
support, as the President seems
to imply.
Indeed, if there does seem to
be a "rather familiar coalition" it
is because these are the only
people that care enough about
what goes on here to voice their
concerns; the only people who
haven't become so petrified that
they no longer givea damn about
anything except beating Cal or
what they're eating for dinner.
As to whether such a policy is
necessary, the recent fire at the
Gay People's Union would seem
to indicate that the tolerance
purported to exist here isn't all
that it ought to be. Finally, I hope
that our President will see fit to
address himself to this problem,
rather than writing me off as
• some tired old radical.

Foley research
As advanced graduate stu
dents in economics and par
ticipants in Assoc. Economics
Prof. Duncan Foley's mac
roeconomic theory seminar, we
find it very difficult to under
stand the department's decision
to postpone tenure for Foley.
Since we each concentrate in
macro and monetary theory, we
feel competent to evaluate
Foley's theoretical contributions
to the field.
We believe that his publica
tions have been outstanding
seminal works, exploring the
roots of monetary theory; there is
no doubt in our minds that Foley
is one of the finest young monet
ary theorists.
We are not only familiar with
Foley's scholarship through his
publications, but we have also
had direct contact with him both
as a participant in the seminar
and as an advisor to our own re
search. The sharpness and intui
tive content of his comments and
guidance have been most
stimulating and productive.
Foley has not confinded him
self to monetary theory and mac
roeconomics. His fnany con
tributions to other fields — from

mathematical economics and
public finance to alternative ap
proaches and Marxian
economics — have show re
markable creativity, a constant
concern for the basic problems
and a rare intellectual integrity.
Our working relationship
with Foley has been a privilege;
we cannot but consider his pos
sible departure from the Univer
sity as an extremely severe loss
for the Economics Department.
We hope that the senior fa
culty will reconsider its deci
sion.

Student input
We disagree with Bill Mac-
Dougall's opinion in the May 8
Daily that students do not be
long in tenure decisions and
other policy matters of the
Economics Department. That
students, lacking wisdom and
privileged information, should
instead confide in some notion
of professional infallibility, as
MacDougall implies, is untena
ble to us.
Insofar as economics students
share the burden of those "infal
lible" decisions which go awry,
their presence in the decision
process is warranted.
We therefore support the cur
rent recommendation of
economics graduates and un
dergraduates that students be al
lowed formal participation in
department policy and tenure
decisions and we will pursue
this objective in the Under
graduate Economics Association
(UEA) in 1976-1977.

Kudos to Marshall
Jonathan Marshall certainly
deserves great thanks from read
ers of the Daily for the excellent
columns he has written this year.
His latest reports, delineating
the links between U.S. policies,
and Japanese and Indonesian
corruption, are particularly
noteworthy.
Marshall's columns stand out
in my mind as the most astute,
best researched, most convinc
ing and certainly the most dis
turbing I have read in four years
here.
. His meticulousness and his
concerns made me grateful for
the press freedoms which still
exist in this nation. If only the
news he has brought us were en
couraging enough to indicate
that voting in the 1976 elections
could reform our foreign
policies!

Honest fun
As a fraternity member, I op
pose the move to suspend the
Delts. What is this campus com
ing to. when us frat guys have to
worry about suffering penalties
for destroying publicand private
property?
This thing isn't just the Delts.
you know.
What about the Zetes? Now
they will be afraid to go out and
throw beer kegs around on the
tennis courts. It's just like Bob
Ottilie says, they'll suspend us at
the drop of a keg — or was it pi n?
What good is a fraternity if the
boys can't have a little honest
fun? It's all a part of growing up
and now the University is trying
to take it away from us.

Larry Horton has no right to
make frats accountable for their
actions. I think the Stanford
community should be aware that
if Horton persists in his decision,
he just might prevent us frat
guys from doing this kind of
stuff in the future.
All I can say is: What kind of
place would this be without it?

Tacky situation
Today for the second time this
year, I patched up a thumbtack
puncture in my bicycle tube.
What irritates me the most is that
I saw the head of the tack, a re
volving silver disc, appear on
my front tire immediately after 1
passed the kiosk between Meyer
and the corner of Cubberley.
I later removed 13 active tacks
(points up and unbent) sur
rounding three of those cylidri
cal bulletin boards on campus.
Numerous inactive thumbtacks
(points broken, bent or facing
down) also encircled the kiosks.
I can only speculate on the
number of flats these tacks must
cause every year.
Now 1 don't advocate a boycott
of all events posted with
thumbtacks or the formation of
a Soc : .ety for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Bicycle Tubes, but I do
wish that those students who
post notices on the kiosks would
show a little consideration for
bicycle riders and use staples or
tape.

Support O'Grady
In the June 8 Palo Alto-Mt.
View Municipal Court election,
voters are presented with an un
common kind of candidate — an
incumbent who deserves to be
returned to office.
In his five years on the bench,
judge James O'Grady has proven
himself a knowledgeable and
capable jurist. A precedent
setting ruling he made in a new
area of family law was recently
upheld by the State Supreme
Court 7-0.
Equally important in a profes
sion that has received much
criticism recently for the laxity
of its working hours, O'Grady
has gained a reputation as a
hard-working and conscientious
public servant.
O'Grady has actively sought to
improve the service of justice in
the courts. He was instrumental
in introducing the concept of
"compulsory community ser
vice" sentences in lieu of fines or
jail terms where justice could be
better served by such an alterna
tive.
O'Grady is supported by both
the Democratic and Republican
Party County Chairmen and re
ceived over two-thirds of the
votes in a poll of the County Bar
Association.
Being of progressive political
inclinations, we share many of
the criticisms of the legal system
that have been voiced in this
campaign. However, we believe
that those who are concerned
with the failings of our present
system would do well to support
an individual who has sought to
initiate change where he could
and who has discharged his re
sponsibilities to the public as
commendably as has O'Grady.
