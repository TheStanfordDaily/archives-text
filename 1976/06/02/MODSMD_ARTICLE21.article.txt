# Cleaner nuclear alternatives
## 
### 
Roland Verney

Opponents of Prop. 15 often
claim that if we do not proceed
with nuclear energy, we'll have
to build and operate coal-fired
power plants that will destroy
the air qualty in California.
First of all, coal is not the only
alternative to nuclear power
here. Presently nuclear power
only provides three percent or so
of this state's energy needs. The
vast geothermal potential here is
just beginning to be tapped.
A recent study by the Stanford
Environmental Law Society
claims that this relatively clean,
renewable energy source has
been thwarted in its develop
ment by the "selfish interests of
the developers, the utilities and
by indifference of government
regulatory bodies."
California has more geother
mal potential than all the other
48 continental states combined.
But geothermal aside, if the in
dustries and utilities were to
turn their attention to methods
of cutting energy use (thereby
eliminating the need for new
power plants), coal and uranium
would become equally extrane
ous.
Reworking rate structures to
make peak-period electricity
more expensive, charging the
heaviest users more rather than
less than everyone else, insulat
ing homes (and charging a
monthly fee to pay off the cost
plus interest), renting solar col
lectors to home-owners — all
these are being tried or consi
dered seriously now by Califor
nia utilities. But it is not the
norm for a company selling
power to attempt to convince its
customers to use less of its pro
duct.
Nuclear pollution
My second response to the op
position is that although nuclear
plants do not produce the same
type of pollution as do coal-fired
plants, they do pollute. Radioac
tive pollutants are released by
any nuclear facility in normal
operation.
First of all, some low-level
radioactive gases (i.e. krypton
85) are emitted regularly from
the smokestacks of these plants.
Secondly, there is no engineer
ing device capable of maintain
ing a 100 percent efficient seal
for a combustion chamber. So
Once in the environment,
r'.dionuclides concentrate as
1 icy progress up the food chain.
Strontium 90 escapes and is ab
sorbed by grass, which is then
eaten by cows. Because this
strontium is a radioactive twin of
calcium, it is concentrated in the
cow's body in teeth, in bones,
and in milk. Some of it ends up
in cereal bowls and breakfast ta
bles. Humans incorporate stron
tium as do cows. Once in our
bones, this can produce
leukemia, especially in
youngsters.
Produce pollutants
At the same time it is true that
coal-fired plants produce hun
dreds of tons of pollutants per
day. But what are these pollut
ants? Mainly sulphur dioxide,
particulates and oxides of nitro
gen, which are considered
health-damaging. But it is inac
curate to compare the dangers
associated with these pollutants
and those established for
radioactive particles.
Radionuclides remain toxic
for anywhere from hundreds
(krypton 85, strontium 90) to
hundreds of thousands of years
(plutonium). Further, the
thorough enforcement of air
quality emission standards for
fossil fuel plants has already
achieved a stabilization of the
pollutant levels in places like t he
Bay Area.

Nuclear pollution
My second response to the op
position is that although nuclear
plants do not produce the same
type of pollution as do coal-fired
plants, they do pollute. Radioac
tive pollutants are released by
any nuclear facility in normal
operation.
First of all, some low-level
radioactive gases (i.e. krypton
85) are emitted regularly from
the smokestacks of these plants.
Secondly, there is no engineer
ing device capable of maintain
ing a 100 percent efficient seal
for a combustion chamber. So
Once in the environment,
r'.dionuclides concentrate as
1 icy progress up the food chain.
Strontium 90 escapes and is ab
sorbed by grass, which is then
eaten by cows. Because this
strontium is a radioactive twin of
calcium, it is concentrated in the
cow's body in teeth, in bones,
and in milk. Some of it ends up
in cereal bowls and breakfast ta
bles. Humans incorporate stron
tium as do cows. Once in our
bones, this can produce
leukemia, especially in
youngsters.
Produce pollutants
At the same time it is true that
coal-fired plants produce hun
dreds of tons of pollutants per
day. But what are these pollut
ants? Mainly sulphur dioxide,
particulates and oxides of nitro
gen, which are considered
health-damaging. But it is inac
curate to compare the dangers
associated with these pollutants
and those established for
radioactive particles.
Radionuclides remain toxic
for anywhere from hundreds
(krypton 85, strontium 90) to
hundreds of thousands of years
(plutonium). Further, the
thorough enforcement of air
quality emission standards for
fossil fuel plants has already
achieved a stabilization of the
pollutant levels in places like t he
Bay Area.

Opponents of Prop. 15 often
claim that if we do not proceed
with nuclear energy, we'll have
to build and operate coal-fired
power plants that will destroy
the air qualty in California.
First of all, coal is not the only
alternative to nuclear power
here. Presently nuclear power
only provides three percent or so
of this state's energy needs. The
vast geothermal potential here is
just beginning to be tapped.
A recent study by the Stanford
Environmental Law Society
claims that this relatively clean,
renewable energy source has
been thwarted in its develop
ment by the "selfish interests of
the developers, the utilities and
by indifference of government
regulatory bodies."
California has more geother
mal potential than all the other
48 continental states combined.
But geothermal aside, if the in
dustries and utilities were to
turn their attention to methods
of cutting energy use (thereby
eliminating the need for new
power plants), coal and uranium
would become equally extrane
ous.
Reworking rate structures to
make peak-period electricity
more expensive, charging the
heaviest users more rather than
less than everyone else, insulat
ing homes (and charging a
monthly fee to pay off the cost
plus interest), renting solar col
lectors to home-owners — all
these are being tried or consi
