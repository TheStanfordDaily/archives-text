# Arguments contradictory

The latest Field opinion poll has shown that
many Californians concerned about nuclear reac
tor safety will vote "no" on Proposition 15. Appa
rently, the $7 million advertising campaign being
waged by the opposition has successfully con
vinced many voters that the initiative will shut
down nuclear power.
But a careful analysis of the arguments for shut
down reveals their gross weaknesses and suggests
that voters who want nuclear safety and nuclear
energy should vote "yes,"
Opponents of the initiative falsely assert that it
will generate a shutdown because: (1) the word
ing is overly stringent, and prevents any state
legislator from finding reactors and their waste
disposal systems "safe"; and (2) the $560 million
liability limit currently imposed by the federal
Price-Anderson Act could be neither waived nor
repealed within a year, as the initiative demands.
Ask a pro-nuclear friend these two questions to
disprove the first shutdown argument:
—Do you believe that radioactive waste can be
stored without any reasonable chance of leakage
for the next half-million years?
—Do you believe that safety systems have been
satisfactorily tested in substantially similar sys
tems?
Not overly stringent
The likely "yes" answers to both questions
(which contain the initiative's basic wording)
suggest that the initiative's wording is not overly
stringent.
The key phrases urr "reasonablystore wastes"
and "satisfactorily test safety sysems." 1 suggest
that if "reasonable" and "satisfactory" are too
stringent for our local representatives, then
perhaps reactors are overly dangerous and de
serve to be de-rated (slowly shut down.)
The second common shutdown argument im
plies that three unlikely ifs will all occur:
1) If the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRG) refuses to require California nuclear
utilities to waive their limited liability . . .
One clause in Price-Anderson does allow the
NRC to force any utility to give up its limited
liability. Such a requirement would not only be
binding, but would also fulfill the initiative's
conditions.
Doing nothing
The only possibility of nuclear power being
de-rated lies in the possibility of the NRC doing
nothing. But the NRC has consistently acted to
maintain the full operation of nuclear reactors.
Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the NRC
would refuse to require such a waiver and let
California nuclear power plants be de-rated.
2) If Congress fails to repeal the limited liability

provisions of Price-Anderson by June 1977 . . .
The opposition claims that Congress will be
unable to repeal these provisions since it recently
renewed the Price-Anderson Act by an "over
whelming" margin. That is a very naive political
analysis.
The crucial vote to consider is not the Price-
Anderson vote in general, but the Bingham
amendment in particular, which dealt specifi
cally with eliminating limited liability provisions
from the Price-AndersOn Act. That vote was ex
tremely close.
Freshmen supported
And last year's vote demonstrated that
freshman Congresspeople almost unanimously
support the Bingham amendment. Next year's
entry of at least 52 more new Congresspeople
suggests that the needed four percent shift to
eliminate the industry's limited liability is likely.
3) If the Supreme Court fails to declare federal
preemption of one particular section of the initia
tive . . .
Stanford Law Professors Charles Meyers and
John Barton concluded that federal supremacy in
the area of nuclear liability is likely.
Curiously, the initiative's opposition agrees,
implying that we shouldn't vote for a bill that we
"know"the courts will knock down. But wouldn't
we still vote fore the new unconstitutional cam
paign spending limits of the old Prop. 9?
Violation of Fifth
Another possible event is that once Price-
Anderson is given standing in the federal courts,
its liability limitation provisions might be de
clared unconstitutional by their violation of the
Fifth Amendment's guarantee of due process. Pre
liminary reports from a case currently in progress
in North Carolina suggest that Price-Anderson's
constitutionality may already be in jeopardy.
In sum, the chance of all three unlikely ifs oc
curring is very slim. The utilities want us to be
lieve that they will complacently allow them
selves to be de-rated.
Yet, we know they are extremely cunning lin
guists and can afford the best lawyers to exploit
every possible political pressure point and legal
loophole to prevent such unwanted conse
quences. Thus, the opposition's shutdown argu
ments are complete fabrications.
To assume a shutdown only means that the
nuclear industry concedes its inability to prove its
boisterous claims of safety.
Prop. 15 is a safety measure, not a "deceptively
worded" attempt to shut down nuclear power
plants. Vote "yes" on Prop. 15.
