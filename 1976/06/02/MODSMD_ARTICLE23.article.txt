# Inability to see real issues

President Richard Lyman's
lament over the eternal return of
what he calls a "familiar coali
tion" is bemusing, to say the
least. Who has ever seen a "coali
tion" including the Stanford
Band and the Gay People's Un
ion, Dianne Feinstein and the
Campus Ministries, Alliance for
Radical Change and the Daily
editors with the ASSU Presi
dents, Hillel and the Black Stu
dents Union, Libertarians and
United Stanford Employees, as
well as Pete McCloskey and
David Harris? ,
Now, assuredly, since Lyman
assumed the powers of his office,
he has provided many occasions
for many people to express their
disagreement with his policies.
And if he were simply remind
ing us that the spectacle of a
large group of people trying
futilely to persuade him to in
corporate social and economic
justice into this already highly
corporate institution is a familiar
one, we should be in agreement.
For Lyman's stance as chief
nay-sayer to modest and reason
able progressive proposals for
change is also most "familiar" to
those of us who have differed
with him in the past (mostly te
nured professors, because others
have a way of leaving Stanford,
sometimes involuntarily).
The idea of a "familiar coali
tion," however, with its hint of
some secret long-lived cabal, re
born each year in a new form,
with a new name, a new color, a
new sex perhaps, busily invent
ing new issues with which to
harass Lyman, is really an ad
hominem argument, even if the
names are missing.
It subordinates the importance
of the issues to some undefined
mysterious preoccupation that is

"what's really uppermost in
people's minds." This inability
to see substance in the issues,
this viewing of them as evanes
cent appearances, ephemeral
symbols of a hidden abiding
spirit, the new year's fashionable
cloth covering the real raw secret
blood and guts somewhere
down out of sight: this is a
perspective that may illuminate
the viewer more than the vie
wed.
It suggests at least a mind thqt
cannot understand or acknow
ledge how all these apparently
diverse issues can possibly mat
ter so much and how more than
one of them can matter to the
same person or group.
But they do. ' .
1 might mention here a few of
those that have mattered enorm
ously in the years of Lyman's
Presidency and, if my incom
plete catalogue suggests that
"plus ca change, plus c'est la
meme chose," it certainly, in
view of many departures, does
not mean there is the same
"familiar coalition," but might
well mean that in many essential
respects the administration's
outlook has not changed sub
stantially in the past decade.
Here then are a few sample is
sues:
—Should the University au
thorize secret research or the de
velopment of weapons for use in
Indochina? Should we punish
students who peacably protested
recruitment here by the CIA, the
Marines. Honeywell, el al.?
—Should we sponsor and pro
fit from contracts for quasi
scientific experimentation on
Iramians and Indonesians? Can
we protect students,"faculty and
staff from political suspensions,
firings and denials of tenure?

—Indeed, should we not de
clare that the Bill of Rights of the
U.S. Constitution should have
the same binding validity for
Stanford as it does for the gov
ernment? . . .The list could get
very long.
These are not shadow or phan
tom issues, and an administra
tion that consistently undere
stimates their importance in
vites enduring criticism and
promotes adversarial relation
ships. I might also say that such
criticism may seem contrived or
a product of spontaneous gener
ation to administrators immured
in their executive suites in
Building 10, with little com
munication with faculty, stu
dents and staff, and when large
numbers of these groups feel ef
fectively excluded from partici
pation in decision making and
the shaping of University policy.
If Lyman saw Stanford more as
an intellectual community to
lead than as a corporate structure
to manage, and if he had enough
confidence in democracy to nur
ture it here where we all live, he
might be less mystified and even
less afflicted by the spirit of pro
test at Stanford.

justice into this already highly
corporate institution is a familiar
one, we should be in agreement.
For Lyman's stance as chief
nay-sayer to modest and reason
able progressive proposals for
change is also most "familiar" to
those of us who have differed
with him in the past (mostly te
nured professors, because others
have a way of leaving Stanford,
sometimes involuntarily).
The idea of a "familiar coali
tion," however, with its hint of
some secret long-lived cabal, re
born each year in a new form,
with a new name, a new color, a
new sex perhaps, busily invent
ing new issues with which to
harass Lyman, is really an ad
hominem argument, even if the
names are missing.
It subordinates the importance
of the issues to some undefined
mysterious preoccupation that is

"what's really uppermost in
people's minds." This inability
to see substance in the issues,
this viewing of them as evanes
cent appearances, ephemeral
symbols of a hidden abiding
spirit, the new year's fashionable
cloth covering the real raw secret
blood and guts somewhere
down out of sight: this is a
perspective that may illuminate
the viewer more than the vie
wed.
It suggests at least a mind thqt
cannot understand or acknow
ledge how all these apparently
diverse issues can possibly mat
ter so much and how more than
one of them can matter to the
same person or group.
But they do. ' .
1 might mention here a few of
those that have mattered enorm
ously in the years of Lyman's
Presidency and, if my incom
plete catalogue suggests that
"plus ca change, plus c'est la
meme chose," it certainly, in
view of many departures, does
not mean there is the same
"familiar coalition," but might
well mean that in many essential
respects the administration's
outlook has not changed sub
stantially in the past decade.
Here then are a few sample is
sues:
—Should the University au
thorize secret research or the de
velopment of weapons for use in
Indochina? Should we punish
students who peacably protested
recruitment here by the CIA, the
Marines. Honeywell, el al.?
—Should we sponsor and pro
fit from contracts for quasi
scientific experimentation on
Iramians and Indonesians? Can
we protect students,"faculty and
staff from political suspensions,
firings and denials of tenure?

—Indeed, should we not de
clare that the Bill of Rights of the
U.S. Constitution should have
the same binding validity for
Stanford as it does for the gov
ernment? . . .The list could get
very long.
These are not shadow or phan
tom issues, and an administra
tion that consistently undere
stimates their importance in
vites enduring criticism and
promotes adversarial relation
ships. I might also say that such
criticism may seem contrived or
a product of spontaneous gener
ation to administrators immured
in their executive suites in
Building 10, with little com
munication with faculty, stu
dents and staff, and when large
numbers of these groups feel ef
fectively excluded from partici
pation in decision making and
the shaping of University policy.
If Lyman saw Stanford more as
an intellectual community to
lead than as a corporate structure
to manage, and if he had enough
confidence in democracy to nur
ture it here where we all live, he
might be less mystified and even
less afflicted by the spirit of pro
test at Stanford.

President Richard Lyman's
lament over the eternal return of
what he calls a "familiar coali

least. Who has ever seen a "coali

Band and the Gay People's Un

Campus Ministries, Alliance for
Radical Change and the Daily
editors with the ASSU Presi

United Stanford Employees, as
well as Pete McCloskey and
David Harris? ,
Now, assuredly, since Lyman
assumed the powers of his office,
he has provided many occasions
for many people to express their
disagreement with his policies.

large group of people trying
futilely to persuade him to in
corporate social and economic
justice into this already highly
