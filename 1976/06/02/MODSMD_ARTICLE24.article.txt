# Stopping out: a chance to think

Chris Hendricks

It seems that one's "enlightened" aware
ness of the meaning I essness and restric
tiveness of status takes flight as one ap
proaches graduation. It is often frightening
as well as unimpressive to say that I "donT
know" or that I'm going to "just live" after
June 13.
It is not (|iiite the same as "going to Boalt,
Stanford Biz, or, even, a Bolivian med
school." After-all, a Stanford student has
probably been "going" somewhere for most
of his life.
But I am declaring my freedom. I am
going to do what I should have done long
ago — stop-out. I am getting off that track
that started with "acceleratedmath"in the
fifth grade.
But I am not just pausing to decide which

major or grad school to weld myself to. I am
through with that system for now — the
blinders are off.
Not that I do not appreciate the time I have
spent at Stanford. On the contrary, I have
loved acquiring a liberal education.
The great variety of subjects I have
studied, not specializing until the last mi
nute, has truly made life all the more fas
cinating. But that variety did not come
about by design as. perhaps, it should have.
It rose accidentally from the struggle to
find that one narrow area in which I should
concentrate my aptitude and ambition.
But I no longer leave my welfare to the
system, my fulfillment to accident. I am
joining the thousands of "underemployed"

liberal arts graduates who sit on the
periphery seeing out as well as in and, hope
fully, providing some sanity to and check
on that system.
It would be nice to have a fulfilling, mean
ingful job in and of itself. I have confidence
that that will come in time and. perhaps,
from within.
Meanwhile, while working at the corner
liquor store or driving a truck. I am going to
read, yes, for pleasure; join a city-legue bas
ketball team; find that group to sing for; and
write that book I will have meaning In and
of myself — my integrity no longer violated
by a system.
