# Thoughts of an aging activist

Spring has arrived at Stanford.
Spring can be as cruel a season lor the
aging and aged as it is a glorious time for the
young. For the young it stimulates thoughts
of the tremendous potential of life ahead; for
the aged, i suspect, it calls up images of lost
chances, compromised values and time
wasted.
In my thirty-second spring, lodged all too
briefly in the crevasse between youth and
old age, the season tears at me from these
two ages of man and compels me to try and
reconcile the two.
I have an advantage, here at the dead
center of my life, near enough to the days of
my youth to appreciate its strengths and
close enough to the end of life to view with
some objectivity youth's shallownesses.
Labor union
I am an active member of a labor union,
lately arrived to the movement from the
ranks of student involvement. Like others of
my time (Tom Hayden, David Harris, et al.)
age has changed the vehicle and the tactics
of my activities without changing the val
ues which motivate those actions.
Our goals were racial and economic jus
tice, international brotherhood, decent
humane treatment of all people. Our tactics
were mass protests, national boycotts,
strikes, voter registration, civil disobedi
ence and, ultimately, martyrdom of life or
freedom.
What has brought me to the labor move
ment is the realization that, although the
values were righteous, the tactics and goals
were too broad.
We have the potential to achieve, to some

extent, those goals (of justice, equality and
humanity) in our immediate environment,
in individual coses. And that may be a start
ing point for extending those gains outside
our environment.
By impatiently attempting to jump the
hurdle of setting our own house in order
and immediately arriving at rearranging the
world, vve were "copping out." By attacking
instituions from the outside we were doom
ing ourselves to failure (and, not inciden
tally, the current generation of youth to
apathy generated by our failure) from the
start.
Protest made easy
In a sense, it made protest easy to know
we could never achieve our ends. Wecould
avoid the bothersome and unromantic
"nuts and bolts" work of recruiting, or
ganizing, writing copy, knocking at doors,
doing surveys, attending meetings, clean
ing offices, filing papers and doing re
search.
Our time could be gloriously spent being
gassed, busted, clubbed, photographed,
fingerprinted, tried, expelled and finally
ignored or dismissed as radicals.
One cannot help but wonder if H. Bruce
Franklin would have done better to stay at
Stanford, not for the cause of international
Marxism but for the stimulation of debate,
revolution and ultimately perhaps the
opening of a crack in Stanford's stone wall
of corporate mentality, through which
human values could have been crammed by
others.
But Franklin sought the larger goal and
now he is gone, the faculty is docile, the
trustees are in firm control, and interna-

tional capitalism, as far as 1 can see, has not
been scratched by the flailings of a brilliant,
magnetic unemployed college professor.
Unify community
1 view the United Stanford Employees at
Stanford as the only practical way to unify
the community to combat the microcosmic
model of money-and-power-above-people
mentality which is the weakness of
America.
If we, as workers, can achieve social jus
tice, equal and fair economic payment for
our labor, and the right to be treated with
dignity, it will open the door for students,
faculty and other members of the commun
ity to gain like considerations. Then
perhaps the time will come when buildings
will be less important around here than
people and every grievance will not be
answered by a legal opinion.
Perhaps even thetrustees will not hesitate
to listen to oppressed minorities seeking
fair treatment.
If all this comes about, it will only be
through the drudgery of meetings, cau
cuses, recruitment, organizing and the sup
port of all members and friends. If we fail —
and if the University prevails through the
force of its legal and monetary resources
and its virtually supra-legal power over us
all — it will be the defeat not only of the
workers, but of the students, faculty ad
ministrators and, yes, even the power brok
ers themselves, who degrade themselves
daily in their lack of concern for their
brothers and sisters.
