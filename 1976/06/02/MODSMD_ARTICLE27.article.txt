# Arguments against Prop. 15 lack validity

Craig Ritchey

I find it difficult to understand
the perspective of Carolyn
Kovacevic as expressed in her
May 6 opinions article in the
Daily May 6.
It is very important that the
public know that Prop. 15 is a
safety measure which does no
more than request that our most
directly elected and accountable
public officials, with the aid of
competent technical experts, de
termine that the present nuclear
power plant technology is safe
enough for us to encourage rapid
development in the state.
If these safety standards are
"neither practical nor neces
sary" as Kovacevic states, then
indeed the public should vote
"no" on Prop. 15. If, on the other
hand, the public believes that
these very minimum safeguards
should be established, then
Prop. 15 is the reasonable and
proper response.
It would be important to the
voter who is not familiar with all
of the details of the campaign to
be aware that the "No On 15
Committee" has received 90
percent of its money from in
dustrial corporations and the
utility companies directly in
volved economically in nuclear
power.
The reactor builders and
operators at first attempted to

ignore completely the technical
and public criticisms of nuclear
power. When this strategy failed
and over 500,000 registered vot
ers in California voted to place
Prop. 15 before the voters, the
industry attempted to discredit
those who criticized and raised
significant questions about the
technology.
After this too did not work and
the polls showed an increasing
public concern, the industry
placed its most articulate and
learned spokespersons before
the California State Legislature
in an attempt to convince the
legislature that there was no
reasonable basis to be concerned
about the safety of nuclear
power. That showing by the in
dustry did not convince the as
sembly committee chaired by
Assemblyman Charles Warren.
After three months of exhaus
tive hearings where both sides
presented their facts and opin
ions, that committee promul
gated four bills in the State legis
lature, which address some of
the concerns of Prop. 15. Three
have now passed the Assembly.
Ever since that time when the
industry lost the safety debate,
hundreds-of-thou sands and
millions of dollars have been
poured into a public relations
campaign to attempt to convince
the vo'ers that a "yes" vote on
Prop. 15 would be a vote to shut
down nuclear power and to
create economic disruption in
the state.
This argument by the No On
15 Committee is purely one of
political expediency and a fabri
cation The opinions recently
expressed by the chairman of the
California Energy Commission,
together with the results from a
study from the University of
Texas soon to be released and
comments by Prof. Martin
Hrown in a recently published
University work on Prop. 15,
demonstrate the falsity of the in
dustry's shutdown and
economic disruption claims.
One does not have to be con
vinced that nuclear power is bad
or that nuclear power is unsafe to
vote for Prop. 15. One must only
be convinced that there is a seri
ous controversy about the safety
of nuclear power and there are

reputable and reasonable people
who believe that it is not safe.
It is in light of this uncertainty
that the public is being asked
whether or not some reasonable
form of analysis and testing
should be done before
we become irrevocably commit
ted to nuclear power.
Civen the large surplus of
electrical energy in California
and the absence of plans to build
new nuclear power plants in the
state for the next several years, I
submit that the only reasonable
course is to vote "yes" on Prop.
15 while we have the opportun
ity for reexamination.
Kovacevic's economic

analysis is totally wrong as evi
denced by the recent an
nouncement by the Director of
the Sacramento Municipal Util
ity District that they are sus
pending plans for the construc
tion of a second nuclear power
plant, principally because of
economic considerations. The
statement indicated that geoth
ermal is now cheaper than nuc
lear power and that there was no
significant difference in price
between electricity generated by
coal and by nuclear power.
Proposition 15 is the only
reasonable response to our nuc
lear power questions.
