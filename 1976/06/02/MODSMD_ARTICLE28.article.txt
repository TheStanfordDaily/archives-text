### Bruce Kadden 
Ronald Reagan returns next
Tuesday to the state which twice
elected him governor for his
most important primary of the
presidential campaign.
Ahead in the polls. Reagan
needs to capture the lf>7
winner-take-all delegates in
order to prevent incumbent Pres
ident Cerald Ford from garner
ing the necessary committed de
legates to be assured of a first
ballot victory.
Ford looked like a sure win
ner. and Reagan an early drop
out after the first month of
primaries, but the challenger's
attacks have elicited heavy
White II oust; response, as we 11 as
support from a fairly conserva
tive Republican electorate.
The issue grabbing the head
lines and which Reagan has be
nefited from is the Ford ad
ministration's renegotiation of
the treaty over the Panama
Canal.
Whether or not the con
iroversy has been blown out of
iioportion, as lord supporters
< laim. it has captured the head
i ncs a nd has caused some voters
to question Ford's defense pol
icy.
'Reagan's Folk
Reagan's objects to lord's wil
lingness to yield outright domi
nation of thi! waterway to
Panama, calling the canal /one
.is much ol a sovereign United
Slates territory as Alaska.
lord's renegotiation efforts
(.tune .it a time when ant i
\merican sentiments in Panama
threaten to become riots if the
Central American country does
aot yet morn control over the
* anal.
Hut lord's position on re

negotiation consists of a shift of
sovereignty over the next 50
vears. at the end of which time
:he I 'nited States would still re
tain passage rights, share opera
l ion.il duties and help defend the
canal.
Reagan argues that the U.S.
should not he pushed around on
its own continent. Currently, the
U.S. doesn't own the canal out
right. hut pays S2 million per
year rent to Panama.
Anti-detente
Reagan has also been critical
ot I 'ord's foreign policy efforts in
other areas, specifically oppos
ing Secretary ol State I lenry kis
si user's detente approach. Ford
li.is rejected recent calls from
various sources for firing Kis
singer, and has supported his re
cent jaunt to Africa.
Keagan has also questioned
America's military supremacy,
charging that the United States
is now second to the Soviet
Union in defense strength.
lord, though, submitted the
largest defense hill ever to Con
gress. 5112.7 billion, and has
since asked for an additional
$:i22 million for BO Minuteman
111 missies. Me has also sup
ported building the B-l super
sonic strategic bomber.
While Keagan has benefited
from keeping foreign policy in
the spotlight. Ford has been em
phasizing his effective handling
of the nation's economy.
Ford's figures
During the first quarter, the
real Cross National Product rose
7.5 percent, the inflation rate
was at a three-and-a-half year
low of it.7 percent and consumer
prices were up just 2.9 percent.
I lowever. unemployment is still
at 7.5 percent.

It was the release of this data
that forced Reagan to stop attack
ing the Ford administration for
deficit spending and switch the
attack to the foreign policy issue.
Another area of difference is
tilt; negative income tax to
supplant the current welfare sys
tem. a position which former
Secretary of Defense Melvin
Laird has gotten Ford to support.
Reagan opposes the negative
income tax. and has come up
with a counter-proposal of his
own: shifting many federally
funded social services to state
level. I le has claimed this would
save t he government $90 billion.
Ford also supports a decen
tralized national health insur
ance plan, which Reagan op
poses. His positions on
economic issues have led some
Keagan supporters to call him a
libertarian, but his positions on
other issues buck this
philosophy.
Both he and Ford are opposed
to the legalization of marijuana.
Reagan calling it a successor to
alcohol as a crutch for the
younger generation.
Abortion
The candidates differ on abor
tion. with Ford favoring the
status quo which allows abor
tion on demand up to the third
month of pregnancy, and Reagan
favoring a constitutional
amendment which would pro
hibit abortions except for health
reasons.
Keagan also opposes the
Kqual Rights Amendment, while
l ord has not expressed a posi
tion on the issue.
Confidence
Keagan's confidence of a
California victory led him to
leave the state earlier this week,
journeying East, where two
other crucial primaries will
occur in Ohio and New Jersey.
With officially uncommitted
slates in Pennsylvania and New
York indicating their intention
to support ford, the President
has moved back into a 701-541
lead in delegate count. An upset
in California, along with ex
pected wins in the other two
states, could probably give ford
the nomination, which requires
1 130 votes.
But if Keagan wins his state it's
likely that the fight will be
waged on the convention floor,
as each candidate attempts to
lure the remaining uncommitted
delegates.
