# Republican candidates
## 4 race for Senate seat 
### 
The four top candidates for the
Republican nomination in the
racefor the seat now held by Sen.
John Tunney (D-Calif.) represent
a cross section of the California
Republican party in the 19705.
There is an unabashed conser
vative. a pair of moderates with
experience in national politics
and a former Democrat who
thinks his party left him in the
19605.
Former Lt. Gov. John Harmer's
credentials as a southern
California conservative are
beyond question.
The 42-year-old former state
senator was appointed in 1974
by former Gov. Ronald Reagan to
complete former Lt. Gov. Ed
Reinecke's term. He boasts of his
conservative record in the state
legislature and openly endorses
Reagan's candidacy in the presi
dential race.
Lean to the right
Harmer cashed in on his lean
to the right during the 1974
primary when he was nominated
to be then-Controller Houston

Klournoy's running mate in the
gubernatorial race to succeed
Reagan. Conservatives in
California are known for bring
ing out the kind of supporters
who will pound pavements for
their candidates, and Harmer's
throng was no exception.
This year, however. Harmer's
right-wing charm has failed to
excite the Republicans. He is
now running fourth in the Field
Foil.
Rep. Alphonzo Bell (D-Los
Angeles) has served eight terms
in Congress and has been known
as a moderate to liberal Repub
licans.
His support for the Equal
Rights Amendment and federal
aid to education have not en
deared him with the conserva
tive wing of his party and have
made him vulnerable to anti-Big
Government and anti-
Washington rhetoric from his
opponents.
John Wayne
Recently, Bell has tried to play
down his moderate image.
While he accepted support from
Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park), he also received an en
dorsement from conservative
actor John Wayne and has em
phasized strong national de
fense and a hard line with the
Soviet Union in recent speeches.
In addition, Bell has waged an
expensive media campaign in
recent weeks which has moved
him up and away from Harmer
and toward former Health, Edu
cation and Welfare (HEW) Sec
retary Robert Finch's second
place stand in the Field poll.
Finch became prominent in
state politics in 1965 when he
began his race for lieutenant
governor. Eventually he became
Reagan's running mate and held

the second spot until Richard
Nixon became president in 1969.
Considered one of the Repub
lican's "fair-haired boys" in the
late 19605, Finch was briefly
considered for the vice presiden
tial position at the 1968 Republi
can Convention in Miami.
Unelectable?
Despite his disassociation
from Watergate and his moder
ate politics. Finch's opponents
continue to say his position on
the first Nixon Cabinet will make
him unelectable in a race against
Tunney.
Finch counters that his ex
perience as an administrator at
HEW, combined with criticism
of federal deficit spending.
Proposition 15 and proposals to
cut military spending will over
shadow his short career in the
Nixon Administration.
Finch has been running a close
second to S.I. Hayakawa, former
president of San Francisco State
College. Hayakawa, a Democrat
until 1973, has gained support
from name identification stem
ming from his stand against de
monstrations in the late 1960s
and early 1970s at the college.
Dissatisfied with the course of
the Democratic party in the
19605, Hayakawa claims he still
supports the goals of Adlai
Stevenson in Stevenson's 1956
presidential campaign.
But affirmative action, racial
quotas and what he considers a
"thumbs down on America" ap
proach by liberals drove him to
the Republicans.
A forceful speaker, the seman
ticist and former conservative
columnist remains in an ever
more-tenuous lead for the Re
publican nomination.
