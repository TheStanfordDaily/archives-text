# Four remaining Demos eye Calif, vote

### Stephen Carter News Analysis 
Next Tuesday's presidential
primaries in California, Ohio and New
Jersey formally close a Democratic
primary season which has whittled an
enormous field down to a solid front
runner and a few stubborn challen
gers.
Only four serious contenders for the
nomination remain, and all will try for
,i share of California's 280 convention
delegates, the nation's single largest

bloc. Current polls favor Gov. Edmund
G. Brown Jr. to win the bulk of those
delegates, with Jimmy Garter, the
former Georgia governor and clear
candidate to beat, finishing a strong
second. But Idaho Sen. Frank Church
and Arizona Rep. Morris Udall could
also gain more delegates to add to their
support.

Surveys indicate that voters in
Democratic primaries this year have so
far been more concerned with per
sonalities and generalities than with
concrete issues. Although none of the
candidates has offered detailed
proposals for solving the nation's
problems, all have outlined those
problem areas which they consider
crucial, and have identifiable stands
on these issues.
Remarkably, despite intra-party
squabbling and charges of vagueness,
the candidates' stands — except for a
few glaring differences — tend to be
fairly similar on most issues.
Foreign policy and defense
Carter, Church and Udall have all
vowed to slash the defense budget if
elected. They point especially to the
development of unnecessary or obso
lete weapons and systems. Brown,
however, has refused to take a firm
stance on whether he would cut the
defense budget, but has said in the past
that there is "an illusion that one can
reduce our defense appropriations."
Udall. Brown and Church were early
opponents of United States' involve
ment in Indochina. Carter, who says
"We must never again keep secret the
evolution of our foreign policy from
the Congress and the American
people." joins those three in attacking
unnecessary U.S. intervention abroad.
Udall in particular, while opposing
"brushfire wars." sees the need for a
"lean and efficient" military.
All the candidates apparently agree
with Carter's statement that theUnited
States "has an inevitable role of lead
ership to play within the community
of nations." FJrown has been critical of
the government's handling of that role,
calling the United States "a sap,"

which is easily bullied by smaller
countries. Udall has explicitly expres
sed his admiration for former United
Nations Ambassador Daniel Moyni
han's "tough approach" to the nations
of the third world.
All four candidates put heavy em
phasis on continuing United States
support of Israel, while calling forcon-

tinued negotiations in the Middle East.
Udall wants negotiations between Jor
dan, Israel and elected representatives
of the West Bank residents to establish
a Palestinian state there. At the same
time, he favors Israeli retention of the
Golan Heights. Carter has condemned
the United Nations' resolution on Is
raeli "racism" as a slur.
Brown sees the necessity of the Un
ited States' maintaining "a strong
economic and military presence" in
the Sinai, and says the nation must
"minimize" Soviet influence in Pales
tine.
Church's campaign emphasizes his
experience in foreign affairs. He is
third ranking member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, and
chaired the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence. He also chairs a sub
committee on multinational corpora
tions, although his work there has fre
quently been criticized as more
publicity-generating than legis
lation-generating.
Church has proposed that the gov
ernment purchase all oil for domestic
distribution after secret competitive
bidding, and that it resell oil to Ameri
can companies.
Church has opposed what he calls
"indiscriminate" foreign aid since
1971 and voted against resumption of
United States aid to Turkey. He also
co-authored the Cooper-Church and
Case-Church amendments, which li
mited United States participation in
Indochina combat.
Carter supports the development of
nuclear free zones and would prohibit
any nuclear matrials being shipped to
countries which have declined to sign
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
He believes the United States should
propose to the Soviet Union a prog

ram of mutually monitored step-by
step reduction to zero, nuclear
weapons. Carter also favors a single
international stockpile of nuclear
fuels. He would continue detente, but
drive a harder bargain with the Soviet
Union.
Brown has in the past expressed
support for majority rule in Africa and
criticized the United States for paying
it lip-service, while doing little to
further it. His overall international
conception calls for "planetary
realism," which involves all nations'
recognizing their common problems
and goals, and the necessity of their
working together to solve them.
Udall has supported foreign aid and
opposed covert actions by the Central
Intelligence Agency. But he has said.
"We need a professional CIA," and has
indicated he has no objections to spies
"in the Kremlin, in the P.L.0., and in
the Portuguese army." He says third
and fourth world countries deserve a
larger role in international decision
making.
