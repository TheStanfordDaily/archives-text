# Four remaining Demos eye Calif, vote
## 
### Stephen Carter News Analysis 
Next Tuesday's presidential
primaries in California, Ohio and New
Jersey formally close a Democratic
primary season which has whittled an
enormous field down to a solid front
runner and a few stubborn challen
gers.
Only four serious contenders for the
nomination remain, and all will try for
,i share of California's 280 convention
delegates, the nation's single largest

bloc. Current polls favor Gov. Edmund
G. Brown Jr. to win the bulk of those
delegates, with Jimmy Garter, the
former Georgia governor and clear
candidate to beat, finishing a strong
second. But Idaho Sen. Frank Church
and Arizona Rep. Morris Udall could
also gain more delegates to add to their
support.

Surveys indicate that voters in
Democratic primaries this year have so
far been more concerned with per
sonalities and generalities than with
concrete issues. Although none of the
candidates has offered detailed
proposals for solving the nation's
problems, all have outlined those
problem areas which they consider
crucial, and have identifiable stands
on these issues.
Remarkably, despite intra-party
squabbling and charges of vagueness,
the candidates' stands — except for a
few glaring differences — tend to be
fairly similar on most issues.
Foreign policy and defense
Carter, Church and Udall have all
vowed to slash the defense budget if
elected. They point especially to the
development of unnecessary or obso
lete weapons and systems. Brown,
however, has refused to take a firm
stance on whether he would cut the
defense budget, but has said in the past
that there is "an illusion that one can
reduce our defense appropriations."
Udall. Brown and Church were early
opponents of United States' involve
ment in Indochina. Carter, who says
"We must never again keep secret the
evolution of our foreign policy from
the Congress and the American
people." joins those three in attacking
unnecessary U.S. intervention abroad.
Udall in particular, while opposing
"brushfire wars." sees the need for a
"lean and efficient" military.
All the candidates apparently agree
with Carter's statement that theUnited
States "has an inevitable role of lead
ership to play within the community
of nations." FJrown has been critical of
the government's handling of that role,
calling the United States "a sap,"

which is easily bullied by smaller
countries. Udall has explicitly expres
sed his admiration for former United
Nations Ambassador Daniel Moyni
han's "tough approach" to the nations
of the third world.
All four candidates put heavy em
phasis on continuing United States
support of Israel, while calling forcon-

tinued negotiations in the Middle East.
Udall wants negotiations between Jor
dan, Israel and elected representatives
of the West Bank residents to establish
a Palestinian state there. At the same
time, he favors Israeli retention of the
Golan Heights. Carter has condemned
the United Nations' resolution on Is
raeli "racism" as a slur.
Brown sees the necessity of the Un
ited States' maintaining "a strong
economic and military presence" in
the Sinai, and says the nation must
"minimize" Soviet influence in Pales
tine.
Church's campaign emphasizes his
experience in foreign affairs. He is
third ranking member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, and
chaired the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence. He also chairs a sub
committee on multinational corpora
tions, although his work there has fre
quently been criticized as more
publicity-generating than legis
lation-generating.
Church has proposed that the gov
ernment purchase all oil for domestic
distribution after secret competitive
bidding, and that it resell oil to Ameri
can companies.
Church has opposed what he calls
"indiscriminate" foreign aid since
1971 and voted against resumption of
United States aid to Turkey. He also
co-authored the Cooper-Church and
Case-Church amendments, which li
mited United States participation in
Indochina combat.
Carter supports the development of
nuclear free zones and would prohibit
any nuclear matrials being shipped to
countries which have declined to sign
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
He believes the United States should
propose to the Soviet Union a prog

ram of mutually monitored step-by
step reduction to zero, nuclear
weapons. Carter also favors a single
international stockpile of nuclear
fuels. He would continue detente, but
drive a harder bargain with the Soviet
Union.
Brown has in the past expressed
support for majority rule in Africa and
criticized the United States for paying
it lip-service, while doing little to
further it. His overall international
conception calls for "planetary
realism," which involves all nations'
recognizing their common problems
and goals, and the necessity of their
working together to solve them.
Udall has supported foreign aid and
opposed covert actions by the Central
Intelligence Agency. But he has said.
"We need a professional CIA," and has
indicated he has no objections to spies
"in the Kremlin, in the P.L.0., and in
the Portuguese army." He says third
and fourth world countries deserve a
larger role in international decision
making.
Economic and domestic
policy
All the candidates stress the
importance of lowering the un
employment rate — which will
probably be around seven per
cent at election time — to four
percent or less. They support
federally guaranteed employ
ment if necessary.
Carter says he believes that
both the unemployment and in
flation rates can be reduced bv
like amounts, but Udall says he
is willing to accept higher infla
tion as a temporary effect of full
employment.
All the candidates are some
what vague on specifics for im
plementing their numerous
suggested reforms in domestic
policy. Carter explaining that he
will need "months" in the White
House to come up with concrete
proposals.
Church supports cost-of
living increases in social sec
urity. and would cut inheritance
taxes, so that farms and small
businesses would not be dam
aged by the death of the owner.
He has emphasized consumer is
sues and favors the establish
ment of a Consumer Protection

Agency. He sits on the Senate
Interior Committee, where he
has worked for the interests of
farmers in Idaho and elsewhere.
Stressing the need for "decen
tralization" of government au
thority. Church has proposed
numerous federal budget cuts.
His Select Committee proposed
183 reforms in the laws govern
ing intelligence activities, at
home and abroad. He has op
posed gun control, voting to
table an important bill in H)74.
and has supported the mandat
ory death penalty for certain of
fenses.
Brown has played down
specifics in his campaign far
more than has any other candi
date. "All I guarantee." he has
told supporters, "is a lot of hard
work and to tell you what is
working and what is not." He
has said of politics. "A little
vagueness goes a long way in
this business."
But he has endorsed the
Humphrey-Hawkins bill, which
would require the government to
reduce unemployment to three
percent. He has indicated the
need to "increase the cost of
crime." and has signed legisla
tion as governor stiffening sen
tences for heroin possession and

sale. On the other hand, he sup
ports decriminalization of
marijuana.
Brown has emphasized the
need for reform of the educa
tional system, and has described
forced busing to achieve racial
integration as a matter best left to
the courts, although he has said
that the public's mood on busing
is shifting.
Udall has made much of his
decision to make a formal break
with the Mormon Church some
30 years ago over its stand on
civil rights, and has sponsored
or co-sponsored considerable
civil riglits legislation during his
15 years in Congress.
He has consistently fought for
consumer and environmental is
sues. and the League of Conser
vation Voters, in a ranking of
candidates, gave him an "out
standing" rating. (Carter shared
the highest rating with Udall.
while Brown ranked only "fair."
Church had not then entered the
race, but over the years,the LCV
has credited him with about an
80 percent rating on environ
mental votes, about the same as
Udall's.)
Udall supports government
funded jobs, tax cuts, an increase
in the money supply, and
federalization of welfare. He
says the United States alone
among industrialized nations
fails to provide some form of na
tional health insurance.
He says that environmental
protection will add. not elimi
nate. jobs. He adds that urban
problems will be alleviated if
employment is increased there.
He opposes gun control, and
says that as president he would
work to repeal the right-to-work
provision of the Taft-Hartley Act
— a provision he had earlier en
dorsed. He also sees, as does
Brown, the need for considera
ble reform of the criminal justice
system.
Carter also sees the need for
such reform, although he has
promised to veto the controver
sial S.B. 1 should it reach him as
president. Without going into
specifics, he has also promised
to cut the number of federal
agencies from 1900 to about 200.
He made similar cuts in the
Georgia beaureaucracy.
He has promised lower infla
tion, full employment and a
balaced budget by 1979. To sec
ure this, Carter wants an increase
in the money supply and
emergency authority to institute
wage-price controls. He says he
would prefer business to provide
new jobs, but would use gov
ernment resources if necessary,
agreeing with Udall that there
are jobs in environmental pre
servation and railroad rebuild
ing.
He wants three-year budget
ing for federal agencies, largely
federalized welfare, national
health insurance, and govern
ment regulation of all medical
fees. He supports gun control
and the equal rights amendment,
and opposes federal mandated
low-income housing in suburbs
if the only purpose is changing a
neighborhood's ethnic balance.
He supports voluntary busing,
searches for alternative energy
sources and government fund
ing for mass transit. He endorses
establishment of a Consumer
Protection Agency.
Next Tuesday's presidential
primaries in California, Ohio and New
Jersey formally close a Democratic
primary season which has whittled an
enormous field down to a solid front

Surveys indicate that voters in
Democratic primaries this year have so
far been more concerned with per
sonalities and generalities than with
concrete issues. Although none of the
candidates has offered detailed
proposals for solving the nation's
problems, all have outlined those
problem areas which they consider
crucial, and have identifiable stands
on these issues.
Remarkably, despite intra-party
squabbling and charges of vagueness,
the candidates' stands — except for a
few glaring differences — tend to be
fairly similar on most issues.
Foreign policy and defense
Carter, Church and Udall have all
vowed to slash the defense budget if
elected. They point especially to the
development of unnecessary or obso
lete weapons and systems. Brown,
however, has refused to take a firm
stance on whether he would cut the
defense budget, but has said in the past
that there is "an illusion that one can
reduce our defense appropriations."
Udall. Brown and Church were early
opponents of United States' involve
ment in Indochina. Carter, who says
"We must never again keep secret the
evolution of our foreign policy from
the Congress and the American
people." joins those three in attacking
unnecessary U.S. intervention abroad.
Udall in particular, while opposing
"brushfire wars." sees the need for a
"lean and efficient" military.
All the candidates apparently agree
with Carter's statement that theUnited
States "has an inevitable role of lead
ership to play within the community
of nations." FJrown has been critical of
the government's handling of that role,
calling the United States "a sap,"

which is easily bullied by smaller
countries. Udall has explicitly expres
sed his admiration for former United
Nations Ambassador Daniel Moyni
han's "tough approach" to the nations
of the third world.
All four candidates put heavy em
phasis on continuing United States
support of Israel, while calling forcon-

tinued negotiations in the Middle East.
Udall wants negotiations between Jor
dan, Israel and elected representatives
of the West Bank residents to establish
a Palestinian state there. At the same
time, he favors Israeli retention of the
Golan Heights. Carter has condemned
the United Nations' resolution on Is
raeli "racism" as a slur.
Brown sees the necessity of the Un
ited States' maintaining "a strong
economic and military presence" in
the Sinai, and says the nation must
"minimize" Soviet influence in Pales
tine.
Church's campaign emphasizes his
experience in foreign affairs. He is
third ranking member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, and
chaired the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence. He also chairs a sub
committee on multinational corpora
tions, although his work there has fre
quently been criticized as more
publicity-generating than legis
lation-generating.
Church has proposed that the gov
ernment purchase all oil for domestic
distribution after secret competitive
bidding, and that it resell oil to Ameri
can companies.
Church has opposed what he calls
"indiscriminate" foreign aid since
1971 and voted against resumption of
United States aid to Turkey. He also
co-authored the Cooper-Church and
Case-Church amendments, which li
mited United States participation in
Indochina combat.
Carter supports the development of
nuclear free zones and would prohibit
any nuclear matrials being shipped to
countries which have declined to sign
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
He believes the United States should
propose to the Soviet Union a prog

ram of mutually monitored step-by
step reduction to zero, nuclear
weapons. Carter also favors a single
international stockpile of nuclear
fuels. He would continue detente, but
drive a harder bargain with the Soviet
Union.
Brown has in the past expressed
support for majority rule in Africa and
criticized the United States for paying
it lip-service, while doing little to
further it. His overall international
conception calls for "planetary
realism," which involves all nations'
recognizing their common problems
and goals, and the necessity of their
working together to solve them.
Udall has supported foreign aid and
opposed covert actions by the Central
Intelligence Agency. But he has said.
"We need a professional CIA," and has
indicated he has no objections to spies
"in the Kremlin, in the P.L.0., and in
the Portuguese army." He says third
and fourth world countries deserve a
larger role in international decision
making.
Economic and domestic
policy
All the candidates stress the
importance of lowering the un
employment rate — which will
probably be around seven per
cent at election time — to four
percent or less. They support
federally guaranteed employ
ment if necessary.
Carter says he believes that
both the unemployment and in
flation rates can be reduced bv
like amounts, but Udall says he
is willing to accept higher infla
tion as a temporary effect of full
employment.
All the candidates are some
what vague on specifics for im
plementing their numerous
suggested reforms in domestic
policy. Carter explaining that he
will need "months" in the White
House to come up with concrete
proposals.
Church supports cost-of
living increases in social sec
urity. and would cut inheritance
taxes, so that farms and small
businesses would not be dam
aged by the death of the owner.
He has emphasized consumer is
sues and favors the establish
ment of a Consumer Protection

Agency. He sits on the Senate
Interior Committee, where he
has worked for the interests of
farmers in Idaho and elsewhere.
Stressing the need for "decen
tralization" of government au
thority. Church has proposed
numerous federal budget cuts.
His Select Committee proposed
183 reforms in the laws govern
ing intelligence activities, at
home and abroad. He has op
posed gun control, voting to
table an important bill in H)74.
and has supported the mandat
ory death penalty for certain of
fenses.
Brown has played down
specifics in his campaign far
more than has any other candi
date. "All I guarantee." he has
told supporters, "is a lot of hard
work and to tell you what is
working and what is not." He
has said of politics. "A little
vagueness goes a long way in
this business."
But he has endorsed the
Humphrey-Hawkins bill, which
would require the government to
reduce unemployment to three
percent. He has indicated the
need to "increase the cost of
crime." and has signed legisla
tion as governor stiffening sen
tences for heroin possession and

sale. On the other hand, he sup
ports decriminalization of
marijuana.
Brown has emphasized the
need for reform of the educa
tional system, and has described
forced busing to achieve racial
integration as a matter best left to
the courts, although he has said
that the public's mood on busing
is shifting.
Udall has made much of his
decision to make a formal break
with the Mormon Church some
30 years ago over its stand on
civil rights, and has sponsored
or co-sponsored considerable
civil riglits legislation during his
15 years in Congress.
He has consistently fought for
consumer and environmental is
sues. and the League of Conser
vation Voters, in a ranking of
candidates, gave him an "out
standing" rating. (Carter shared
the highest rating with Udall.
while Brown ranked only "fair."
Church had not then entered the
race, but over the years,the LCV
has credited him with about an
80 percent rating on environ
mental votes, about the same as
Udall's.)
Udall supports government
funded jobs, tax cuts, an increase
in the money supply, and
federalization of welfare. He
says the United States alone
among industrialized nations
fails to provide some form of na
tional health insurance.
He says that environmental
protection will add. not elimi
nate. jobs. He adds that urban
problems will be alleviated if
employment is increased there.
He opposes gun control, and
says that as president he would
work to repeal the right-to-work
provision of the Taft-Hartley Act
— a provision he had earlier en
dorsed. He also sees, as does
Brown, the need for considera
ble reform of the criminal justice
system.
Carter also sees the need for
such reform, although he has
promised to veto the controver
sial S.B. 1 should it reach him as
president. Without going into
specifics, he has also promised
to cut the number of federal
agencies from 1900 to about 200.
He made similar cuts in the
Georgia beaureaucracy.
He has promised lower infla
tion, full employment and a
balaced budget by 1979. To sec
ure this, Carter wants an increase
in the money supply and
emergency authority to institute
wage-price controls. He says he
would prefer business to provide
new jobs, but would use gov
ernment resources if necessary,
agreeing with Udall that there
are jobs in environmental pre
servation and railroad rebuild
ing.
He wants three-year budget
ing for federal agencies, largely
federalized welfare, national
health insurance, and govern
ment regulation of all medical
fees. He supports gun control
and the equal rights amendment,
and opposes federal mandated
low-income housing in suburbs
if the only purpose is changing a
neighborhood's ethnic balance.
He supports voluntary busing,
searches for alternative energy
sources and government fund
ing for mass transit. He endorses
establishment of a Consumer
Protection Agency.
Next Tuesday's presidential
primaries in California, Ohio and New
Jersey formally close a Democratic
primary season which has whittled an
enormous field down to a solid front
runner and a few stubborn challen
gers.
Only four serious contenders for the
nomination remain, and all will try for
,i share of California's 280 convention
delegates, the nation's single largest

bloc. Current polls favor Gov. Edmund
G. Brown Jr. to win the bulk of those
delegates, with Jimmy Garter, the
former Georgia governor and clear
candidate to beat, finishing a strong
second. But Idaho Sen. Frank Church
and Arizona Rep. Morris Udall could
also gain more delegates to add to their
support.

lete weapons and systems. Brown,
however, has refused to take a firm
stance on whether he would cut the
defense budget, but has said in the past
that there is "an illusion that one can
reduce our defense appropriations."
Udall. Brown and Church were early
opponents of United States' involve
ment in Indochina. Carter, who says
"We must never again keep secret the
evolution of our foreign policy from
the Congress and the American
people." joins those three in attacking
unnecessary U.S. intervention abroad.
Udall in particular, while opposing
"brushfire wars." sees the need for a
"lean and efficient" military.
All the candidates apparently agree
with Carter's statement that theUnited
States "has an inevitable role of lead
ership to play within the community
of nations." FJrown has been critical of
the government's handling of that role,
calling the United States "a sap,"

which is easily bullied by smaller
countries. Udall has explicitly expres
sed his admiration for former United
Nations Ambassador Daniel Moyni
han's "tough approach" to the nations
of the third world.
All four candidates put heavy em
phasis on continuing United States
support of Israel, while calling forcon-

tinued negotiations in the Middle East.
Udall wants negotiations between Jor
dan, Israel and elected representatives
of the West Bank residents to establish
a Palestinian state there. At the same
time, he favors Israeli retention of the
Golan Heights. Carter has condemned
the United Nations' resolution on Is
raeli "racism" as a slur.
Brown sees the necessity of the Un
ited States' maintaining "a strong
economic and military presence" in
the Sinai, and says the nation must
"minimize" Soviet influence in Pales
tine.
Church's campaign emphasizes his
experience in foreign affairs. He is
third ranking member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, and
chaired the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence. He also chairs a sub
committee on multinational corpora
tions, although his work there has fre
quently been criticized as more
publicity-generating than legis
lation-generating.
Church has proposed that the gov
ernment purchase all oil for domestic
distribution after secret competitive
bidding, and that it resell oil to Ameri
can companies.
Church has opposed what he calls
"indiscriminate" foreign aid since
1971 and voted against resumption of
United States aid to Turkey. He also
co-authored the Cooper-Church and
Case-Church amendments, which li
mited United States participation in
Indochina combat.
Carter supports the development of
nuclear free zones and would prohibit
any nuclear matrials being shipped to
countries which have declined to sign
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
He believes the United States should
propose to the Soviet Union a prog

ram of mutually monitored step-by
step reduction to zero, nuclear
weapons. Carter also favors a single
international stockpile of nuclear
fuels. He would continue detente, but
drive a harder bargain with the Soviet
Union.
Brown has in the past expressed
support for majority rule in Africa and
criticized the United States for paying
it lip-service, while doing little to
further it. His overall international
conception calls for "planetary
realism," which involves all nations'
recognizing their common problems
and goals, and the necessity of their
working together to solve them.
Udall has supported foreign aid and
opposed covert actions by the Central
Intelligence Agency. But he has said.
"We need a professional CIA," and has
indicated he has no objections to spies
"in the Kremlin, in the P.L.0., and in
the Portuguese army." He says third
and fourth world countries deserve a
larger role in international decision
making.
Economic and domestic
policy
All the candidates stress the
importance of lowering the un
employment rate — which will
probably be around seven per
cent at election time — to four
percent or less. They support
federally guaranteed employ
ment if necessary.
Carter says he believes that
both the unemployment and in
flation rates can be reduced bv
like amounts, but Udall says he
is willing to accept higher infla
tion as a temporary effect of full
employment.
All the candidates are some
what vague on specifics for im
plementing their numerous
suggested reforms in domestic
policy. Carter explaining that he
will need "months" in the White
House to come up with concrete
proposals.
Church supports cost-of
living increases in social sec
urity. and would cut inheritance
taxes, so that farms and small
businesses would not be dam
aged by the death of the owner.
He has emphasized consumer is
sues and favors the establish
ment of a Consumer Protection

Agency. He sits on the Senate
Interior Committee, where he
has worked for the interests of
farmers in Idaho and elsewhere.
Stressing the need for "decen
tralization" of government au
thority. Church has proposed
numerous federal budget cuts.
His Select Committee proposed
183 reforms in the laws govern
ing intelligence activities, at
home and abroad. He has op
posed gun control, voting to
table an important bill in H)74.
and has supported the mandat
ory death penalty for certain of
fenses.
Brown has played down
specifics in his campaign far
more than has any other candi
date. "All I guarantee." he has
told supporters, "is a lot of hard
work and to tell you what is
working and what is not." He
has said of politics. "A little
vagueness goes a long way in
this business."
But he has endorsed the
Humphrey-Hawkins bill, which
would require the government to
reduce unemployment to three
percent. He has indicated the
need to "increase the cost of
crime." and has signed legisla
tion as governor stiffening sen
tences for heroin possession and

sale. On the other hand, he sup
ports decriminalization of
marijuana.
Brown has emphasized the
need for reform of the educa
tional system, and has described
forced busing to achieve racial
integration as a matter best left to
the courts, although he has said
that the public's mood on busing
is shifting.
Udall has made much of his
decision to make a formal break
with the Mormon Church some
30 years ago over its stand on
civil rights, and has sponsored
or co-sponsored considerable
civil riglits legislation during his
15 years in Congress.
He has consistently fought for
consumer and environmental is
sues. and the League of Conser
vation Voters, in a ranking of
candidates, gave him an "out
standing" rating. (Carter shared
the highest rating with Udall.
while Brown ranked only "fair."
Church had not then entered the
race, but over the years,the LCV
has credited him with about an
80 percent rating on environ
mental votes, about the same as
Udall's.)
Udall supports government
funded jobs, tax cuts, an increase
in the money supply, and
federalization of welfare. He
says the United States alone
among industrialized nations
fails to provide some form of na
tional health insurance.
He says that environmental
protection will add. not elimi
nate. jobs. He adds that urban
problems will be alleviated if
employment is increased there.
He opposes gun control, and
says that as president he would
work to repeal the right-to-work
provision of the Taft-Hartley Act
— a provision he had earlier en
dorsed. He also sees, as does
Brown, the need for considera
ble reform of the criminal justice
system.
Carter also sees the need for
such reform, although he has
promised to veto the controver
sial S.B. 1 should it reach him as
president. Without going into
specifics, he has also promised
to cut the number of federal
agencies from 1900 to about 200.
He made similar cuts in the
Georgia beaureaucracy.
He has promised lower infla
tion, full employment and a
balaced budget by 1979. To sec
ure this, Carter wants an increase
in the money supply and
emergency authority to institute
wage-price controls. He says he
would prefer business to provide
new jobs, but would use gov
ernment resources if necessary,
agreeing with Udall that there
are jobs in environmental pre
servation and railroad rebuild
ing.
He wants three-year budget
ing for federal agencies, largely
federalized welfare, national
health insurance, and govern
ment regulation of all medical
fees. He supports gun control
and the equal rights amendment,
and opposes federal mandated
low-income housing in suburbs
if the only purpose is changing a
neighborhood's ethnic balance.
He supports voluntary busing,
searches for alternative energy
sources and government fund
ing for mass transit. He endorses
establishment of a Consumer
Protection Agency.
Next Tuesday's presidential
primaries in California, Ohio and New
Jersey formally close a Democratic
primary season which has whittled an
enormous field down to a solid front
runner and a few stubborn challen
gers.
Only four serious contenders for the
nomination remain, and all will try for
,i share of California's 280 convention
delegates, the nation's single largest

bloc. Current polls favor Gov. Edmund
G. Brown Jr. to win the bulk of those
delegates, with Jimmy Garter, the
former Georgia governor and clear
candidate to beat, finishing a strong
second. But Idaho Sen. Frank Church
and Arizona Rep. Morris Udall could
also gain more delegates to add to their
support.

Surveys indicate that voters in
Democratic primaries this year have so
far been more concerned with per
sonalities and generalities than with
concrete issues. Although none of the
candidates has offered detailed
proposals for solving the nation's
problems, all have outlined those
problem areas which they consider
crucial, and have identifiable stands
on these issues.
Remarkably, despite intra-party
squabbling and charges of vagueness,
the candidates' stands — except for a
few glaring differences — tend to be
fairly similar on most issues.

the government's handling of that role,
calling the United States "a sap,"

which is easily bullied by smaller
countries. Udall has explicitly expres
sed his admiration for former United
Nations Ambassador Daniel Moyni
han's "tough approach" to the nations
of the third world.
All four candidates put heavy em
phasis on continuing United States
support of Israel, while calling forcon-

tinued negotiations in the Middle East.
Udall wants negotiations between Jor
dan, Israel and elected representatives
of the West Bank residents to establish
a Palestinian state there. At the same
time, he favors Israeli retention of the
Golan Heights. Carter has condemned
the United Nations' resolution on Is
raeli "racism" as a slur.
Brown sees the necessity of the Un
ited States' maintaining "a strong
economic and military presence" in
the Sinai, and says the nation must
"minimize" Soviet influence in Pales
tine.
Church's campaign emphasizes his
experience in foreign affairs. He is
third ranking member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, and
chaired the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence. He also chairs a sub
committee on multinational corpora
tions, although his work there has fre
quently been criticized as more
publicity-generating than legis
lation-generating.
Church has proposed that the gov
ernment purchase all oil for domestic
distribution after secret competitive
bidding, and that it resell oil to Ameri
can companies.
Church has opposed what he calls
"indiscriminate" foreign aid since
1971 and voted against resumption of
United States aid to Turkey. He also
co-authored the Cooper-Church and
Case-Church amendments, which li
mited United States participation in
Indochina combat.
Carter supports the development of
nuclear free zones and would prohibit
any nuclear matrials being shipped to
countries which have declined to sign
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
He believes the United States should
propose to the Soviet Union a prog

ram of mutually monitored step-by
step reduction to zero, nuclear
weapons. Carter also favors a single
international stockpile of nuclear
fuels. He would continue detente, but
drive a harder bargain with the Soviet
Union.
Brown has in the past expressed
support for majority rule in Africa and
criticized the United States for paying
it lip-service, while doing little to
further it. His overall international
conception calls for "planetary
realism," which involves all nations'
recognizing their common problems
and goals, and the necessity of their
working together to solve them.
Udall has supported foreign aid and
opposed covert actions by the Central
Intelligence Agency. But he has said.
"We need a professional CIA," and has
indicated he has no objections to spies
"in the Kremlin, in the P.L.0., and in
the Portuguese army." He says third
and fourth world countries deserve a
larger role in international decision
making.
Economic and domestic
policy
All the candidates stress the
importance of lowering the un
employment rate — which will
probably be around seven per
cent at election time — to four
percent or less. They support
federally guaranteed employ
ment if necessary.
Carter says he believes that
both the unemployment and in
flation rates can be reduced bv
like amounts, but Udall says he
is willing to accept higher infla
tion as a temporary effect of full
employment.
All the candidates are some
what vague on specifics for im
plementing their numerous
suggested reforms in domestic
policy. Carter explaining that he
will need "months" in the White
House to come up with concrete
proposals.
Church supports cost-of
living increases in social sec
urity. and would cut inheritance
taxes, so that farms and small
businesses would not be dam
aged by the death of the owner.
He has emphasized consumer is
sues and favors the establish
ment of a Consumer Protection

Agency. He sits on the Senate
Interior Committee, where he
has worked for the interests of
farmers in Idaho and elsewhere.
Stressing the need for "decen
tralization" of government au
thority. Church has proposed
numerous federal budget cuts.
His Select Committee proposed
183 reforms in the laws govern
ing intelligence activities, at
home and abroad. He has op
posed gun control, voting to
table an important bill in H)74.
and has supported the mandat
ory death penalty for certain of
fenses.
Brown has played down
specifics in his campaign far
more than has any other candi
date. "All I guarantee." he has
told supporters, "is a lot of hard
work and to tell you what is
working and what is not." He
has said of politics. "A little
vagueness goes a long way in
this business."
But he has endorsed the
Humphrey-Hawkins bill, which
would require the government to
reduce unemployment to three
percent. He has indicated the
need to "increase the cost of
crime." and has signed legisla
tion as governor stiffening sen
tences for heroin possession and

sale. On the other hand, he sup
ports decriminalization of
marijuana.
Brown has emphasized the
need for reform of the educa
tional system, and has described
forced busing to achieve racial
integration as a matter best left to
the courts, although he has said
that the public's mood on busing
is shifting.
Udall has made much of his
decision to make a formal break
with the Mormon Church some
30 years ago over its stand on
civil rights, and has sponsored
or co-sponsored considerable
civil riglits legislation during his
15 years in Congress.
He has consistently fought for
consumer and environmental is
sues. and the League of Conser
vation Voters, in a ranking of
candidates, gave him an "out
standing" rating. (Carter shared
the highest rating with Udall.
while Brown ranked only "fair."
Church had not then entered the
race, but over the years,the LCV
has credited him with about an
80 percent rating on environ
mental votes, about the same as
Udall's.)
Udall supports government
funded jobs, tax cuts, an increase
in the money supply, and
federalization of welfare. He
says the United States alone
among industrialized nations
fails to provide some form of na
tional health insurance.
He says that environmental
protection will add. not elimi
nate. jobs. He adds that urban
problems will be alleviated if
employment is increased there.
He opposes gun control, and
says that as president he would
work to repeal the right-to-work
provision of the Taft-Hartley Act
— a provision he had earlier en
dorsed. He also sees, as does
Brown, the need for considera
ble reform of the criminal justice
system.
Carter also sees the need for
such reform, although he has
promised to veto the controver
sial S.B. 1 should it reach him as
president. Without going into
specifics, he has also promised
to cut the number of federal
agencies from 1900 to about 200.
He made similar cuts in the
Georgia beaureaucracy.
He has promised lower infla
tion, full employment and a
balaced budget by 1979. To sec
ure this, Carter wants an increase
in the money supply and
emergency authority to institute
wage-price controls. He says he
would prefer business to provide
new jobs, but would use gov
ernment resources if necessary,
agreeing with Udall that there
are jobs in environmental pre
servation and railroad rebuild
ing.
He wants three-year budget
ing for federal agencies, largely
federalized welfare, national
health insurance, and govern
ment regulation of all medical
fees. He supports gun control
and the equal rights amendment,
and opposes federal mandated
low-income housing in suburbs
if the only purpose is changing a
neighborhood's ethnic balance.
He supports voluntary busing,
searches for alternative energy
sources and government fund
ing for mass transit. He endorses
establishment of a Consumer
Protection Agency.
Next Tuesday's presidential
primaries in California, Ohio and New
Jersey formally close a Democratic
primary season which has whittled an
enormous field down to a solid front
runner and a few stubborn challen
gers.
Only four serious contenders for the
nomination remain, and all will try for
,i share of California's 280 convention
delegates, the nation's single largest

bloc. Current polls favor Gov. Edmund
G. Brown Jr. to win the bulk of those
delegates, with Jimmy Garter, the
former Georgia governor and clear
candidate to beat, finishing a strong
second. But Idaho Sen. Frank Church
and Arizona Rep. Morris Udall could
also gain more delegates to add to their
support.

Surveys indicate that voters in
Democratic primaries this year have so
far been more concerned with per
sonalities and generalities than with
concrete issues. Although none of the
candidates has offered detailed
proposals for solving the nation's
problems, all have outlined those
problem areas which they consider
crucial, and have identifiable stands
on these issues.
Remarkably, despite intra-party
squabbling and charges of vagueness,
the candidates' stands — except for a
few glaring differences — tend to be
fairly similar on most issues.
Foreign policy and defense
Carter, Church and Udall have all
vowed to slash the defense budget if
elected. They point especially to the
development of unnecessary or obso
lete weapons and systems. Brown,
however, has refused to take a firm
stance on whether he would cut the
defense budget, but has said in the past
that there is "an illusion that one can
reduce our defense appropriations."
Udall. Brown and Church were early
opponents of United States' involve
ment in Indochina. Carter, who says
"We must never again keep secret the
evolution of our foreign policy from
the Congress and the American
people." joins those three in attacking
unnecessary U.S. intervention abroad.
Udall in particular, while opposing
"brushfire wars." sees the need for a
"lean and efficient" military.
All the candidates apparently agree
with Carter's statement that theUnited
States "has an inevitable role of lead
ership to play within the community

economic and military presence" in

tine.
Church's campaign emphasizes his
experience in foreign affairs. He is
third ranking member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, and
chaired the Senate Select Committee

quently been criticized as more
publicity-generating than legis
lation-generating.

fuels. He would continue detente, but
drive a harder bargain with the Soviet
Union.
Brown has in the past expressed
support for majority rule in Africa and
criticized the United States for paying

recognizing their common problems
and goals, and the necessity of their
working together to solve them.
Udall has supported foreign aid and
opposed covert actions by the Central
Intelligence Agency. But he has said.
"We need a professional CIA," and has
indicated he has no objections to spies
"in the Kremlin, in the P.L.0., and in
the Portuguese army." He says third
and fourth world countries deserve a
larger role in international decision
making.
Economic and domestic
policy
All the candidates stress the
importance of lowering the un
employment rate — which will
probably be around seven per
cent at election time — to four
percent or less. They support
federally guaranteed employ
ment if necessary.
Carter says he believes that
both the unemployment and in
flation rates can be reduced bv
like amounts, but Udall says he
is willing to accept higher infla
tion as a temporary effect of full
employment.

what vague on specifics for im
plementing their numerous
suggested reforms in domestic
policy. Carter explaining that he
will need "months" in the White
House to come up with concrete
proposals.

ing intelligence activities, at
home and abroad. He has op
posed gun control, voting to
table an important bill in H)74.
and has supported the mandat
ory death penalty for certain of
fenses.
Brown has played down
specifics in his campaign far
more than has any other candi
date. "All I guarantee." he has
told supporters, "is a lot of hard
work and to tell you what is
working and what is not." He
has said of politics. "A little
vagueness goes a long way in
this business."
But he has endorsed the
Humphrey-Hawkins bill, which
would require the government to
reduce unemployment to three
percent. He has indicated the
need to "increase the cost of
crime." and has signed legisla
tion as governor stiffening sen
tences for heroin possession and

sale. On the other hand, he sup
ports decriminalization of
marijuana.

need for reform of the educa
tional system, and has described

the courts, although he has said
that the public's mood on busing
is shifting.
Udall has made much of his
decision to make a formal break
with the Mormon Church some
30 years ago over its stand on
civil rights, and has sponsored
or co-sponsored considerable
civil riglits legislation during his
15 years in Congress.
He has consistently fought for
consumer and environmental is
sues. and the League of Conser
vation Voters, in a ranking of
candidates, gave him an "out
standing" rating. (Carter shared
the highest rating with Udall.
while Brown ranked only "fair."
Church had not then entered the
race, but over the years,the LCV
has credited him with about an
80 percent rating on environ
mental votes, about the same as
Udall's.)
Udall supports government
funded jobs, tax cuts, an increase
in the money supply, and
federalization of welfare. He
says the United States alone

protection will add. not elimi
nate. jobs. He adds that urban
problems will be alleviated if
employment is increased there.

says that as president he would
work to repeal the right-to-work
provision of the Taft-Hartley Act
— a provision he had earlier en
dorsed. He also sees, as does
Brown, the need for considera
ble reform of the criminal justice
system.
Carter also sees the need for
such reform, although he has
promised to veto the controver
sial S.B. 1 should it reach him as
president. Without going into
specifics, he has also promised
to cut the number of federal
agencies from 1900 to about 200.
