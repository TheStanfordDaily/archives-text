California voters will face a
formidable array of propositions
on this year's ballot ranging from
bingo games to nuclear power
plants. Each proposition can be
enacted by a majority vote.
Prop. 1: State School Bonds
provides for a $200 million dol
lar bond issue to build local pub
lic schools. For the past 24 years,
the state has helped local school
districts finance construction of
new buildings by selling state
general obligation bonds.
Prop. 1 proposes to finance a
construction aid program under
which the state would be au
thorized to enter into lease
purchase agreements with local
school districts.
Proponents include California
State Superintendent of Public
Instruction Wilson Riles, who
argues that the proposition will
decrease the cost of financing
local school construction.
Opponents claim that it will
reduce the usual two-thirds vote
required to approve school con
struction projects to a simple
majority vote.
Prop. 2: Veterans Bond Act
provides for a bond issue of $500
million to provide aid for
California veterans. It is an ex
tension of the Cal-Vet home and
farm loan program which
Californians have approved for
54 years.
Backers say that Vietnam vete
rans deserve the same oppor
tunities as the .100,000 veterans
of other wars who have secured
property under the(lal-Vet prog
ram and that the bond issue
would stimulate the construc
tion and real estate industries.
Members of the Libertarian
Party oppose the Cal-Vet prog
ram as "a social welfare prog
ram" which helps veterans at the
expense of other California ns.
Prop. 3: Safe Drinking Water
Bonds would provide for a $175
million bond issue for the im
provement of domestic water
systems. It would initiate a new
program of grants and loans to
local agencies responsible for
the improvement of drinking
water.
Supporters say it will elimi
nate bacteriological ly unsafe
drinking water which they claim
runs through "a significant
number of water systems."
The United Organization of
Taxpayers, Inc. argues that the
program should be funded by
California taxpayers on monthly
water bills.
Prop. 4: Community College
Bonds would provide for a bond
issue of $150 million to be used
lor construction grants to the O.'l
community colleges in Califor
nia. The general taxpayers, not
tin; local school districts, then
pay oil the bonds.
Backers say it is needed to
gurantee the state will meet
long-term commitments to
community colleges.

Foes say those commitments
can be met from other annual re
venues, such as the state's
offshore oil, without the interest
costs of long-term bonds.
Prop. 5: Vote on Tax Measures
is a proposed constitutional
amendment which would allow
the legislature to raise or lower
taxes on corporations, banks and
insurance companies by a sim
ple majority instead of a two
thirds vote.
Currently, individual taxes
(income and sales) can be raised
by a simple majority vote, but a
two-thirds vote is needed to raise
or lower tax rates on the groups
mentioned in the proposition.
Backers point out that 150,000

corporations enjoy the two
thirds protection while almost a
million non-corporate busines
ses are affected by a simple
majority vote.
Opponents contend that the
inequity should not be solved by
lowering the two-thirds re
quirement, but by making it
applicable to all forms of taxa
tion.
Prop. 6: Insurance Company
Taxation is a proposed constitu
tional amendment which would
eliminate an income-tax deduc
tion that isavailableto insurance
companies for the property taxes
on their home or principal of
fices in the state.
