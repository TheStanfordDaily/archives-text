# California voters will vote on 15 propositions June 8
## 
### Kathryn Ma 
California voters will face a
formidable array of propositions
on this year's ballot ranging from
bingo games to nuclear power
plants. Each proposition can be
enacted by a majority vote.
Prop. 1: State School Bonds
provides for a $200 million dol
lar bond issue to build local pub
lic schools. For the past 24 years,
the state has helped local school
districts finance construction of
new buildings by selling state
general obligation bonds.
Prop. 1 proposes to finance a
construction aid program under
which the state would be au
thorized to enter into lease
purchase agreements with local
school districts.
Proponents include California
State Superintendent of Public
Instruction Wilson Riles, who
argues that the proposition will
decrease the cost of financing
local school construction.
Opponents claim that it will
reduce the usual two-thirds vote
required to approve school con
struction projects to a simple
majority vote.
Prop. 2: Veterans Bond Act
provides for a bond issue of $500
million to provide aid for
California veterans. It is an ex
tension of the Cal-Vet home and
farm loan program which
Californians have approved for
54 years.
Backers say that Vietnam vete
rans deserve the same oppor
tunities as the .100,000 veterans
of other wars who have secured
property under the(lal-Vet prog
ram and that the bond issue
would stimulate the construc
tion and real estate industries.
Members of the Libertarian
Party oppose the Cal-Vet prog
ram as "a social welfare prog
ram" which helps veterans at the
expense of other California ns.
Prop. 3: Safe Drinking Water
Bonds would provide for a $175
million bond issue for the im
provement of domestic water
systems. It would initiate a new
program of grants and loans to
local agencies responsible for
the improvement of drinking
water.
Supporters say it will elimi
nate bacteriological ly unsafe
drinking water which they claim
runs through "a significant
number of water systems."
The United Organization of
Taxpayers, Inc. argues that the
program should be funded by
California taxpayers on monthly
water bills.
Prop. 4: Community College
Bonds would provide for a bond
issue of $150 million to be used
lor construction grants to the O.'l
community colleges in Califor
nia. The general taxpayers, not
tin; local school districts, then
pay oil the bonds.
Backers say it is needed to
gurantee the state will meet
long-term commitments to
community colleges.

Foes say those commitments
can be met from other annual re
venues, such as the state's
offshore oil, without the interest
costs of long-term bonds.
Prop. 5: Vote on Tax Measures
is a proposed constitutional
amendment which would allow
the legislature to raise or lower
taxes on corporations, banks and
insurance companies by a sim
ple majority instead of a two
thirds vote.
Currently, individual taxes
(income and sales) can be raised
by a simple majority vote, but a
two-thirds vote is needed to raise
or lower tax rates on the groups
mentioned in the proposition.
Backers point out that 150,000

corporations enjoy the two
thirds protection while almost a
million non-corporate busines
ses are affected by a simple
majority vote.
Opponents contend that the
inequity should not be solved by
lowering the two-thirds re
quirement, but by making it
applicable to all forms of taxa
tion.
Prop. 6: Insurance Company
Taxation is a proposed constitu
tional amendment which would
eliminate an income-tax deduc
tion that isavailableto insurance
companies for the property taxes
on their home or principal of
fices in the state.
Sponsors, including Gov.


—Daily pholo by Glenn Hudson
David Harris
Brown, claim it "would repeal a
(is-year old tax loophole which
allows a few big insurance com
panies to escape paying their fair
share of state taxes."
Foes insist insurance com
panies pay twice as much in
state taxes as other businesses
and warn that the tax increase
will be passed on to those who
purchase home, health and auto
insurance.
Prop. 7: Taxation of Historic
Property would authorize the
Legislature to establish a special
property tax system for histori
cal property.
Proponents claim that many
landmarks have already been
destroyed, sold or parceled off
because of our present tax struc
ture and changes must be made
to preserve historical property.
The United Organization of
Taxpayers, Inc. argues that the
taxpayers will pick up the tab of
lost revenues from these historic
sites.
Prop. 8: Deposit of State
Funds would amend the con
stitutional provision which al
lows public funds to be depo
sited in any bank in the state to
allow deposits in banks or sav
ings and loan associations.
Hackers say that taxpayers
would got the benefit of the
higher«interest rates paid by sav
ings and loan associations.
Opponents claim that the
pool of funds available for home
loans would be reduced by pas
sage of this measure. Banks are
also working to defeat the prop
osition.
Prop. 9: Bingo, a proposed
constitutional amend ment,
would exclude bingo games
conducted for charitable pur

poses from the prohibition
against lotteries.
Hackers say that hi ngo is being
played illegally every clay
throughout the state, and ap
proval of the measure will
merely make it legal. They claim
there will be no commercial pro
fit.
Opponents are not opposed to
social or church bingo but do
warn that the legislation con
tains legal loopholes that may
lead to commercialized bingo.
Prop. 10: Bond Refinancing, a
proposed amendments would
allow the legislature, by a two
thirds vote and without voter
approval, to refinance any out
standing bonded debt of the
state.
Sponsors of this proposal,
which include state treasurer
Jesse Unruh and state finance di
rector Roy Bell, claim that it will
decrease the interest rate on
bonds and save the state $2.5
million on $100 million worth of
bonds.
Opponents argue that it could
be used to postpone payment (if
debts and could produce higher,
not lower, interest rates.
Prop. 11: Surplus Land
This measure would allow
counties and cities to use excess
land acquired for transportation
purposes as public park and re
creation areas.
Backers stress that the mea
sure would benefit all members
of a community, not just au
tomobile drivers.
foes claim that money needed
for street and highway purposes
would be depleted if the mea
sure is passed.
Prop. 12: Usury would revise
the present usury law so that in
terest rates could exceed 10 per
cent under certain conditions. It
specifies exemptions in the in
terest rate ceiling for business
loans exclusively.
It is supported by businessand
labor groups who claim the pre
sent 10 percent ceiling makes it
difficult to get loans.
Objections to the measure are
raised by those who feel its pas
sage will lead to additional costs
to the customers of those
businesses borrowing money at
high rates.
Prop. 13: Senior-Citizen Taxa
tion would allow homeowners,
age 02 or over, with low or mod
erate incomes, to postpone pay
ment of property taxes.
Sponsors claim that it will al
leviate the financial burdens of
the senior citizens without bur

dening the general public.
United Organizations of Tax
payers. Inc. has opposed the
proposition on the grounds that
it is a "bandaid approach," in
adequate 11) solve the problem of
property taxes.
Prop. 14: Constitution Revi
sion was placed on the ballot
with unanimous approval of
both houses of the Legislature. It
would clarify and shorten the
language of the state constitu
tion.
Prop. 15: Nuclear Power
Plants would place state limits
on the development and opera
tion of nuclear power plants if
specified safety .and liability
conditions are not met within a
given time period.
The initiative involves a
three-step process over a five
year period: (1) In June 1077, all
liability limitations must he re
moved by law or specific waiver.
II they are not removed, the
power output of nuclear plants
must be reduced to HO percent of
their licensed power level;
(2) By June 1970. the Legisla
ture, by a two-thirds vote, must
determine that all reactor safety
systems will be effective in ac
tual operation and that radioac
tive wastes can he stored or dis
plosed of with no reasonable
leakage to the environment by
June 1981;
(3) in June 1981. the Legisla
ture, by a two-thirds vote, must
confirm the preceding condi
tions do exist. If they do not. the;
power output of nuclear plants
must be reduced to 60 pecent of
the licensed power level, and no
new nuclear plants will be is
sued land-use permits in Califor
nia. Operating plants will be
further reduced 10 percent per
year until safety requirements
are met.
Proponents of the measure
term it the "nuclear safeguards
initiative"and claim that it "will
not shut down nuclear power
plants in California," but will
ensure the state has "the best
possible standards of safety in
any future operation of atomic
power plants."
Opponents contend that the
"nuclear shutdown initiative"
"comes,incredibly,just when we
face critical energy problems."
They believe that "it will not
only halt nuclear energy de
velopment, but will also shut
down California's nuclear
energy, which has been provid

over 12 years."

Bonds would provide for a bond
issue of $150 million to be used
lor construction grants to the O.'l
community colleges in Califor
nia. The general taxpayers, not
tin; local school districts, then
pay oil the bonds.
Backers say it is needed to
gurantee the state will meet
long-term commitments to
community colleges.

Foes say those commitments
can be met from other annual re
venues, such as the state's
offshore oil, without the interest
costs of long-term bonds.
Prop. 5: Vote on Tax Measures
is a proposed constitutional
amendment which would allow
the legislature to raise or lower
taxes on corporations, banks and
insurance companies by a sim
ple majority instead of a two
thirds vote.
Currently, individual taxes
(income and sales) can be raised
by a simple majority vote, but a
two-thirds vote is needed to raise
or lower tax rates on the groups
mentioned in the proposition.
Backers point out that 150,000

corporations enjoy the two
thirds protection while almost a
million non-corporate busines
ses are affected by a simple
majority vote.
Opponents contend that the
inequity should not be solved by
lowering the two-thirds re
quirement, but by making it
applicable to all forms of taxa
tion.
Prop. 6: Insurance Company
Taxation is a proposed constitu
tional amendment which would
eliminate an income-tax deduc
tion that isavailableto insurance
companies for the property taxes
on their home or principal of
fices in the state.
Sponsors, including Gov.


—Daily pholo by Glenn Hudson
David Harris
Brown, claim it "would repeal a
(is-year old tax loophole which
allows a few big insurance com
panies to escape paying their fair
share of state taxes."
Foes insist insurance com
panies pay twice as much in
state taxes as other businesses
and warn that the tax increase
will be passed on to those who
purchase home, health and auto
insurance.
Prop. 7: Taxation of Historic
Property would authorize the
Legislature to establish a special
property tax system for histori
cal property.
Proponents claim that many
landmarks have already been
destroyed, sold or parceled off
because of our present tax struc
ture and changes must be made
to preserve historical property.
The United Organization of
Taxpayers, Inc. argues that the
taxpayers will pick up the tab of
lost revenues from these historic
sites.
Prop. 8: Deposit of State
Funds would amend the con
stitutional provision which al
lows public funds to be depo
sited in any bank in the state to
allow deposits in banks or sav
ings and loan associations.
Hackers say that taxpayers
would got the benefit of the
higher«interest rates paid by sav
ings and loan associations.
Opponents claim that the
pool of funds available for home
loans would be reduced by pas
sage of this measure. Banks are
also working to defeat the prop
osition.
Prop. 9: Bingo, a proposed
constitutional amend ment,
would exclude bingo games
conducted for charitable pur

poses from the prohibition
against lotteries.
Hackers say that hi ngo is being
played illegally every clay
throughout the state, and ap
proval of the measure will
merely make it legal. They claim
there will be no commercial pro
fit.
Opponents are not opposed to
social or church bingo but do
warn that the legislation con
tains legal loopholes that may
lead to commercialized bingo.
Prop. 10: Bond Refinancing, a
proposed amendments would
allow the legislature, by a two
thirds vote and without voter
approval, to refinance any out
standing bonded debt of the
state.
Sponsors of this proposal,
which include state treasurer
Jesse Unruh and state finance di
rector Roy Bell, claim that it will
decrease the interest rate on
bonds and save the state $2.5
million on $100 million worth of
bonds.
Opponents argue that it could
be used to postpone payment (if
debts and could produce higher,
not lower, interest rates.
Prop. 11: Surplus Land
This measure would allow
counties and cities to use excess
land acquired for transportation
purposes as public park and re
creation areas.
Backers stress that the mea
sure would benefit all members
of a community, not just au
tomobile drivers.
foes claim that money needed
for street and highway purposes
would be depleted if the mea
sure is passed.
Prop. 12: Usury would revise
the present usury law so that in
terest rates could exceed 10 per
cent under certain conditions. It
specifies exemptions in the in
terest rate ceiling for business
loans exclusively.
It is supported by businessand
labor groups who claim the pre
sent 10 percent ceiling makes it
difficult to get loans.
Objections to the measure are
raised by those who feel its pas
sage will lead to additional costs
to the customers of those
businesses borrowing money at
high rates.
Prop. 13: Senior-Citizen Taxa
tion would allow homeowners,
age 02 or over, with low or mod
erate incomes, to postpone pay
ment of property taxes.
Sponsors claim that it will al
leviate the financial burdens of
the senior citizens without bur

dening the general public.
United Organizations of Tax
payers. Inc. has opposed the
proposition on the grounds that
it is a "bandaid approach," in
adequate 11) solve the problem of
property taxes.
Prop. 14: Constitution Revi
sion was placed on the ballot
with unanimous approval of
both houses of the Legislature. It
would clarify and shorten the
language of the state constitu
tion.
Prop. 15: Nuclear Power
Plants would place state limits
on the development and opera
tion of nuclear power plants if
specified safety .and liability
conditions are not met within a
given time period.
The initiative involves a
three-step process over a five
year period: (1) In June 1077, all
liability limitations must he re
moved by law or specific waiver.
II they are not removed, the
power output of nuclear plants
must be reduced to HO percent of
their licensed power level;
(2) By June 1970. the Legisla
ture, by a two-thirds vote, must
determine that all reactor safety
systems will be effective in ac
tual operation and that radioac
tive wastes can he stored or dis
plosed of with no reasonable
leakage to the environment by
June 1981;
(3) in June 1981. the Legisla
ture, by a two-thirds vote, must
confirm the preceding condi
tions do exist. If they do not. the;
power output of nuclear plants
must be reduced to 60 pecent of
the licensed power level, and no
new nuclear plants will be is
sued land-use permits in Califor
nia. Operating plants will be
further reduced 10 percent per
year until safety requirements
are met.
Proponents of the measure
term it the "nuclear safeguards
initiative"and claim that it "will
not shut down nuclear power
plants in California," but will
ensure the state has "the best
possible standards of safety in
any future operation of atomic
power plants."
Opponents contend that the
"nuclear shutdown initiative"
"comes,incredibly,just when we
face critical energy problems."
They believe that "it will not
only halt nuclear energy de
velopment, but will also shut
down California's nuclear
energy, which has been provid
ing electricity to consumers for
over 12 years."
California voters will face a
formidable array of propositions
on this year's ballot ranging from
bingo games to nuclear power
plants. Each proposition can be
enacted by a majority vote.
Prop. 1: State School Bonds
provides for a $200 million dol
lar bond issue to build local pub
lic schools. For the past 24 years,
the state has helped local school
districts finance construction of
new buildings by selling state
general obligation bonds.
Prop. 1 proposes to finance a
construction aid program under
which the state would be au
thorized to enter into lease
purchase agreements with local
school districts.
Proponents include California
State Superintendent of Public
Instruction Wilson Riles, who
argues that the proposition will
decrease the cost of financing
local school construction.
Opponents claim that it will
reduce the usual two-thirds vote
required to approve school con
struction projects to a simple
majority vote.
Prop. 2: Veterans Bond Act
provides for a bond issue of $500
million to provide aid for
California veterans. It is an ex
tension of the Cal-Vet home and
farm loan program which
Californians have approved for
54 years.
Backers say that Vietnam vete
rans deserve the same oppor
tunities as the .100,000 veterans
of other wars who have secured
property under the(lal-Vet prog
ram and that the bond issue
would stimulate the construc
tion and real estate industries.
Members of the Libertarian
Party oppose the Cal-Vet prog
ram as "a social welfare prog
ram" which helps veterans at the
expense of other California ns.
Prop. 3: Safe Drinking Water
Bonds would provide for a $175
million bond issue for the im
provement of domestic water
systems. It would initiate a new
program of grants and loans to
local agencies responsible for
the improvement of drinking
water.
Supporters say it will elimi
nate bacteriological ly unsafe
drinking water which they claim
runs through "a significant
number of water systems."
The United Organization of
Taxpayers, Inc. argues that the
program should be funded by
California taxpayers on monthly
water bills.
Prop. 4: Community College

ture and changes must be made
to preserve historical property.
The United Organization of
Taxpayers, Inc. argues that the
taxpayers will pick up the tab of
lost revenues from these historic
sites.
Prop. 8: Deposit of State
Funds would amend the con
stitutional provision which al
lows public funds to be depo
sited in any bank in the state to
allow deposits in banks or sav
ings and loan associations.
Hackers say that taxpayers
would got the benefit of the
higher«interest rates paid by sav
ings and loan associations.
Opponents claim that the
pool of funds available for home
loans would be reduced by pas
sage of this measure. Banks are
also working to defeat the prop
osition.
Prop. 9: Bingo, a proposed
constitutional amend ment,
would exclude bingo games
conducted for charitable pur

poses from the prohibition
against lotteries.
Hackers say that hi ngo is being
played illegally every clay
throughout the state, and ap
proval of the measure will
merely make it legal. They claim
there will be no commercial pro
fit.
Opponents are not opposed to
social or church bingo but do
warn that the legislation con
tains legal loopholes that may
lead to commercialized bingo.
Prop. 10: Bond Refinancing, a
proposed amendments would
allow the legislature, by a two
thirds vote and without voter
approval, to refinance any out
standing bonded debt of the
state.
Sponsors of this proposal,
which include state treasurer
Jesse Unruh and state finance di
rector Roy Bell, claim that it will
decrease the interest rate on
bonds and save the state $2.5
million on $100 million worth of
bonds.
Opponents argue that it could
be used to postpone payment (if
debts and could produce higher,
not lower, interest rates.
Prop. 11: Surplus Land
This measure would allow
counties and cities to use excess
land acquired for transportation
purposes as public park and re
creation areas.
Backers stress that the mea
sure would benefit all members
of a community, not just au
tomobile drivers.
foes claim that money needed
for street and highway purposes
would be depleted if the mea
sure is passed.
Prop. 12: Usury would revise
the present usury law so that in
terest rates could exceed 10 per
cent under certain conditions. It
specifies exemptions in the in
terest rate ceiling for business
loans exclusively.
It is supported by businessand
labor groups who claim the pre
sent 10 percent ceiling makes it
difficult to get loans.
Objections to the measure are
raised by those who feel its pas
sage will lead to additional costs
to the customers of those
businesses borrowing money at
high rates.
Prop. 13: Senior-Citizen Taxa
tion would allow homeowners,
age 02 or over, with low or mod
erate incomes, to postpone pay
ment of property taxes.
Sponsors claim that it will al
leviate the financial burdens of
the senior citizens without bur

dening the general public.
United Organizations of Tax
payers. Inc. has opposed the
proposition on the grounds that
it is a "bandaid approach," in
adequate 11) solve the problem of
property taxes.
Prop. 14: Constitution Revi
sion was placed on the ballot
with unanimous approval of
both houses of the Legislature. It
would clarify and shorten the
language of the state constitu
tion.
Prop. 15: Nuclear Power
Plants would place state limits
on the development and opera
tion of nuclear power plants if
specified safety .and liability
conditions are not met within a
given time period.
The initiative involves a
three-step process over a five
year period: (1) In June 1077, all
liability limitations must he re
moved by law or specific waiver.
II they are not removed, the
power output of nuclear plants
must be reduced to HO percent of
their licensed power level;
(2) By June 1970. the Legisla
ture, by a two-thirds vote, must
determine that all reactor safety
systems will be effective in ac
tual operation and that radioac
tive wastes can he stored or dis
plosed of with no reasonable
leakage to the environment by
June 1981;
(3) in June 1981. the Legisla
ture, by a two-thirds vote, must
confirm the preceding condi
tions do exist. If they do not. the;
power output of nuclear plants
must be reduced to 60 pecent of
the licensed power level, and no
new nuclear plants will be is
sued land-use permits in Califor
nia. Operating plants will be
further reduced 10 percent per
year until safety requirements
are met.
Proponents of the measure
term it the "nuclear safeguards
initiative"and claim that it "will
not shut down nuclear power
plants in California," but will
ensure the state has "the best
possible standards of safety in
any future operation of atomic
power plants."
Opponents contend that the
"nuclear shutdown initiative"
"comes,incredibly,just when we
face critical energy problems."
They believe that "it will not
only halt nuclear energy de
velopment, but will also shut
down California's nuclear
energy, which has been provid
ing electricity to consumers for
over 12 years."
California voters will face a
formidable array of propositions
on this year's ballot ranging from
bingo games to nuclear power
plants. Each proposition can be
enacted by a majority vote.
Prop. 1: State School Bonds
provides for a $200 million dol
lar bond issue to build local pub
lic schools. For the past 24 years,
the state has helped local school
districts finance construction of
new buildings by selling state
general obligation bonds.
Prop. 1 proposes to finance a
construction aid program under
which the state would be au
thorized to enter into lease
purchase agreements with local
school districts.
Proponents include California
State Superintendent of Public
Instruction Wilson Riles, who
argues that the proposition will
decrease the cost of financing
local school construction.
Opponents claim that it will
reduce the usual two-thirds vote
required to approve school con
struction projects to a simple
majority vote.
Prop. 2: Veterans Bond Act
provides for a bond issue of $500
million to provide aid for
California veterans. It is an ex
tension of the Cal-Vet home and
farm loan program which
Californians have approved for
54 years.
Backers say that Vietnam vete
rans deserve the same oppor
tunities as the .100,000 veterans
of other wars who have secured
property under the(lal-Vet prog
ram and that the bond issue
would stimulate the construc
tion and real estate industries.
Members of the Libertarian
Party oppose the Cal-Vet prog
ram as "a social welfare prog
ram" which helps veterans at the
expense of other California ns.
Prop. 3: Safe Drinking Water
Bonds would provide for a $175
million bond issue for the im
provement of domestic water
systems. It would initiate a new
program of grants and loans to
local agencies responsible for
the improvement of drinking
water.
Supporters say it will elimi
nate bacteriological ly unsafe
drinking water which they claim
runs through "a significant
number of water systems."
The United Organization of
Taxpayers, Inc. argues that the
program should be funded by
California taxpayers on monthly
water bills.
Prop. 4: Community College
Bonds would provide for a bond
issue of $150 million to be used
lor construction grants to the O.'l
community colleges in Califor
nia. The general taxpayers, not
tin; local school districts, then
pay oil the bonds.
Backers say it is needed to
gurantee the state will meet
long-term commitments to
community colleges.

Foes say those commitments
can be met from other annual re
venues, such as the state's
offshore oil, without the interest
costs of long-term bonds.
Prop. 5: Vote on Tax Measures
is a proposed constitutional
amendment which would allow
the legislature to raise or lower
taxes on corporations, banks and
insurance companies by a sim
ple majority instead of a two
thirds vote.
Currently, individual taxes
(income and sales) can be raised
by a simple majority vote, but a
two-thirds vote is needed to raise
or lower tax rates on the groups
mentioned in the proposition.
Backers point out that 150,000

corporations enjoy the two
thirds protection while almost a
million non-corporate busines
ses are affected by a simple
majority vote.
Opponents contend that the
inequity should not be solved by
lowering the two-thirds re
quirement, but by making it
applicable to all forms of taxa
tion.
Prop. 6: Insurance Company
Taxation is a proposed constitu
tional amendment which would
eliminate an income-tax deduc
tion that isavailableto insurance
companies for the property taxes
on their home or principal of
fices in the state.
Sponsors, including Gov.


—Daily pholo by Glenn Hudson
David Harris
Brown, claim it "would repeal a
(is-year old tax loophole which
allows a few big insurance com
panies to escape paying their fair
share of state taxes."
Foes insist insurance com
panies pay twice as much in
state taxes as other businesses
and warn that the tax increase
will be passed on to those who
purchase home, health and auto
insurance.
Prop. 7: Taxation of Historic
Property would authorize the
Legislature to establish a special
property tax system for histori
cal property.
Proponents claim that many
landmarks have already been
destroyed, sold or parceled off
because of our present tax struc

to preserve historical property.

Prop. 12: Usury would revise
the present usury law so that in
terest rates could exceed 10 per
cent under certain conditions. It
specifies exemptions in the in
terest rate ceiling for business
loans exclusively.
It is supported by businessand
labor groups who claim the pre
sent 10 percent ceiling makes it
difficult to get loans.
Objections to the measure are
raised by those who feel its pas
sage will lead to additional costs
to the customers of those
businesses borrowing money at
high rates.
Prop. 13: Senior-Citizen Taxa
tion would allow homeowners,
age 02 or over, with low or mod
erate incomes, to postpone pay
ment of property taxes.
Sponsors claim that it will al
leviate the financial burdens of
the senior citizens without bur

dening the general public.
United Organizations of Tax
payers. Inc. has opposed the
proposition on the grounds that
it is a "bandaid approach," in
adequate 11) solve the problem of
property taxes.
Prop. 14: Constitution Revi
sion was placed on the ballot
with unanimous approval of
both houses of the Legislature. It
would clarify and shorten the
language of the state constitu
tion.
Prop. 15: Nuclear Power
Plants would place state limits
on the development and opera
tion of nuclear power plants if
specified safety .and liability
conditions are not met within a
given time period.
The initiative involves a
three-step process over a five
year period: (1) In June 1077, all
liability limitations must he re
moved by law or specific waiver.
II they are not removed, the
power output of nuclear plants
must be reduced to HO percent of
their licensed power level;
(2) By June 1970. the Legisla
ture, by a two-thirds vote, must
determine that all reactor safety
systems will be effective in ac
tual operation and that radioac
tive wastes can he stored or dis
plosed of with no reasonable
leakage to the environment by
June 1981;
(3) in June 1981. the Legisla
ture, by a two-thirds vote, must
confirm the preceding condi
tions do exist. If they do not. the;
power output of nuclear plants
must be reduced to 60 pecent of
the licensed power level, and no
new nuclear plants will be is
sued land-use permits in Califor
nia. Operating plants will be
further reduced 10 percent per
year until safety requirements
are met.
Proponents of the measure
term it the "nuclear safeguards
initiative"and claim that it "will
not shut down nuclear power
plants in California," but will
ensure the state has "the best
possible standards of safety in
any future operation of atomic
power plants."
Opponents contend that the
"nuclear shutdown initiative"
"comes,incredibly,just when we
face critical energy problems."
They believe that "it will not
only halt nuclear energy de
velopment, but will also shut
down California's nuclear
energy, which has been provid
ing electricity to consumers for
over 12 years."
California voters will face a
formidable array of propositions
on this year's ballot ranging from
bingo games to nuclear power
plants. Each proposition can be
enacted by a majority vote.
Prop. 1: State School Bonds
provides for a $200 million dol
lar bond issue to build local pub
lic schools. For the past 24 years,
the state has helped local school
districts finance construction of
new buildings by selling state
general obligation bonds.
Prop. 1 proposes to finance a
construction aid program under
which the state would be au
thorized to enter into lease
purchase agreements with local
school districts.
Proponents include California
State Superintendent of Public
Instruction Wilson Riles, who
argues that the proposition will
decrease the cost of financing
local school construction.
Opponents claim that it will
reduce the usual two-thirds vote
required to approve school con
struction projects to a simple
majority vote.
Prop. 2: Veterans Bond Act
provides for a bond issue of $500
million to provide aid for
California veterans. It is an ex
tension of the Cal-Vet home and
farm loan program which
Californians have approved for
54 years.
Backers say that Vietnam vete
rans deserve the same oppor
tunities as the .100,000 veterans
of other wars who have secured
property under the(lal-Vet prog
ram and that the bond issue
would stimulate the construc
tion and real estate industries.
Members of the Libertarian
Party oppose the Cal-Vet prog
ram as "a social welfare prog
ram" which helps veterans at the
expense of other California ns.
Prop. 3: Safe Drinking Water
Bonds would provide for a $175
million bond issue for the im
provement of domestic water
systems. It would initiate a new
program of grants and loans to
local agencies responsible for
the improvement of drinking
water.
Supporters say it will elimi
nate bacteriological ly unsafe
drinking water which they claim
runs through "a significant
number of water systems."
The United Organization of
Taxpayers, Inc. argues that the
program should be funded by
California taxpayers on monthly
water bills.
Prop. 4: Community College
Bonds would provide for a bond
issue of $150 million to be used
lor construction grants to the O.'l
community colleges in Califor
nia. The general taxpayers, not
tin; local school districts, then
pay oil the bonds.
Backers say it is needed to
gurantee the state will meet
long-term commitments to
community colleges.

Foes say those commitments
can be met from other annual re
venues, such as the state's
offshore oil, without the interest
costs of long-term bonds.
Prop. 5: Vote on Tax Measures
is a proposed constitutional
amendment which would allow
the legislature to raise or lower
taxes on corporations, banks and
insurance companies by a sim
ple majority instead of a two
thirds vote.
Currently, individual taxes
(income and sales) can be raised
by a simple majority vote, but a
two-thirds vote is needed to raise
or lower tax rates on the groups
mentioned in the proposition.
Backers point out that 150,000

corporations enjoy the two
thirds protection while almost a
million non-corporate busines
ses are affected by a simple
majority vote.
Opponents contend that the
inequity should not be solved by
lowering the two-thirds re
quirement, but by making it
applicable to all forms of taxa
tion.
Prop. 6: Insurance Company
Taxation is a proposed constitu
tional amendment which would
eliminate an income-tax deduc
tion that isavailableto insurance
companies for the property taxes
on their home or principal of
fices in the state.
Sponsors, including Gov.


—Daily pholo by Glenn Hudson
David Harris
Brown, claim it "would repeal a
(is-year old tax loophole which
allows a few big insurance com
panies to escape paying their fair
share of state taxes."
Foes insist insurance com
panies pay twice as much in
state taxes as other businesses
and warn that the tax increase
will be passed on to those who
purchase home, health and auto
insurance.
Prop. 7: Taxation of Historic
Property would authorize the
Legislature to establish a special
property tax system for histori
cal property.
Proponents claim that many
landmarks have already been
destroyed, sold or parceled off
because of our present tax struc
ture and changes must be made
to preserve historical property.
The United Organization of
Taxpayers, Inc. argues that the
taxpayers will pick up the tab of
lost revenues from these historic
sites.
Prop. 8: Deposit of State
Funds would amend the con
stitutional provision which al
lows public funds to be depo
sited in any bank in the state to
allow deposits in banks or sav
ings and loan associations.
Hackers say that taxpayers
would got the benefit of the
higher«interest rates paid by sav
ings and loan associations.
Opponents claim that the
pool of funds available for home
loans would be reduced by pas
sage of this measure. Banks are
also working to defeat the prop
osition.
Prop. 9: Bingo, a proposed
constitutional amend ment,
would exclude bingo games
conducted for charitable pur

poses from the prohibition
against lotteries.
Hackers say that hi ngo is being
played illegally every clay
throughout the state, and ap
proval of the measure will
merely make it legal. They claim
there will be no commercial pro
fit.
Opponents are not opposed to
social or church bingo but do
warn that the legislation con
tains legal loopholes that may
lead to commercialized bingo.
Prop. 10: Bond Refinancing, a
proposed amendments would
allow the legislature, by a two
thirds vote and without voter
approval, to refinance any out
standing bonded debt of the
state.
Sponsors of this proposal,
which include state treasurer
Jesse Unruh and state finance di
rector Roy Bell, claim that it will
decrease the interest rate on
bonds and save the state $2.5
million on $100 million worth of
bonds.
Opponents argue that it could
be used to postpone payment (if
debts and could produce higher,
not lower, interest rates.
Prop. 11: Surplus Land
This measure would allow
counties and cities to use excess
land acquired for transportation
purposes as public park and re
creation areas.
Backers stress that the mea
sure would benefit all members
of a community, not just au
tomobile drivers.
foes claim that money needed
for street and highway purposes
would be depleted if the mea
sure is passed.

power output of nuclear plants
must be reduced to 60 pecent of
the licensed power level, and no
new nuclear plants will be is
sued land-use permits in Califor
nia. Operating plants will be
further reduced 10 percent per
year until safety requirements
are met.
Proponents of the measure
term it the "nuclear safeguards
initiative"and claim that it "will
not shut down nuclear power
plants in California," but will
ensure the state has "the best
possible standards of safety in
any future operation of atomic
power plants."
Opponents contend that the
"nuclear shutdown initiative"
"comes,incredibly,just when we
face critical energy problems."
They believe that "it will not
only halt nuclear energy de
velopment, but will also shut
down California's nuclear
energy, which has been provid
ing electricity to consumers for
over 12 years."
