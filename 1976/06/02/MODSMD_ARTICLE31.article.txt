# Hayden gaining on Tunney in Demo senate primary
## 
### Roy S. Johnson News Analysis 
Tho smoke is clearing among tho scramble of
democratic candidates for tho U.S. Senate seat
held by John Tunney.
At one time. Tunney led by as much ;is 4 to 1 in
voter preference polls and seemed destined for an
easy primary victory. Hut, '60s anti-war activist
Tom U;iyden and his wife, actress Jane Fonda,
have been campaigning hard and extending their
political base from far left into the maintstream of
the California Democratic party.
The last Field Poll, taken May 19, showed Tun
ney leading 50 percent to 33 percent, with 17
percent undecided or favoring other candidates.
In March, the poll had shown Tunney 58 percent,
llayden 15.
No fundraising problems
Neither candidate has had any visible trouble
raising money.
Tunney expects to spend between $650,000 and
$700,000 in the primary. He reported campaign
contributions of $479,791 through March 31.
llayden expects to spend $000,000 and has
raised $530,000.
Seven other candidates are waging campaigns
against the incumbent senator but have been un
able to make impressive showings in voter polls.
Campaign issues
Campaign issues have focused on Tunney's al
leged inconsistencies on issues, such as health
care, energy«and gas prices, and I layden's radical
image of the past.
Tunney told a crowd in White Plaza last Tues
day, "There is one basic issue in this campaign:
dishonesty — whether or not we can exorcise the
lifck of credibility in high government officials
and make them accountable."
llayden has said, "The issue that symbolizes
everything is that Tunney has betrayed bis 1970
pledge for a national health program." I le claims
thatTunney has put other priorities above "basic
human needs."
Fifteen years ago, llayden helped found the
Students for a DemocraticSooiety. In 1970, heand
six others were acquitted of conspiring to incite a
riot at the 1969 Democratic convention.
Voter reaction to his past, he says, is divided
into three groups: a smal I group that admires hi in,
a larger group that dislikes him, and the largest
group of all, that reacts to him with "curiosity,
puzzlement, skepticism but with a kind of open
ness I appreciate."

During ;i recent campaign speech, Hayden cal
led himself one of the "people who was right on
tough questions when it was wrong to be right."
Addressing businessmen at a luncheon in Sac
ramento, Hayden was asked if he would behave in
the Senate in the same way that he did in Judge
Julius Hoffman's courtroom. As a member of the
(Chicago Seven, Hayden was accused of disrupt
ing the trial.
"I'll tell you this. If there's another undeclared
war that's being escalated without people in high
office ciriticizing it, I think it would be certainly
justified to organize demonstrations," he said.
I ,ater in his campaign swing came another con
servative oriented question — Is the U.S. losing its
number one position? Hayden used it to
philosophize on international relations.
Number one
"The world is number one," he said. "No one is
going to be number one. The kind of respect
people give you when you're first in nuclear
stockpiles is the kind of respect one gives to a
bully. The future is going to be determined in the
hungrier eyes of the world."
Hut I layden's favorite subject is Tunney — his
contributions from big businesses, his support for
military spending projects like the B-l Bomber
and for deregulation of gas prices.
Tunney claims that his opponent has been "dis
torting" his achievements and his policy stances.
"In my view we should have learned from
Watergate that no person who misrepresents his
opponent should he let into high public office,"
he says.
Opposition (o Nixon
The senator defends his record by emphasizing
his early opposition to the repressive actions of
the Nixon administration. He claims that his work
to stop t he appoi ntment of Pat (I ray as FBI director
and to challenge the power of ITT "set the
groundwork for" the Watergate investigations.
Tunney played a role in cutting U.S. involve
ment in Angola. Declaims that Gerald Ford's
repeated attempts to intervene show that "the les
sons of Vietnam have not been learned."
In a dramatic campaign encounter last week,
Tunney agreed to debate Hayden after Hayden
apologized to him in a face-to-face encounter.
The agreement came after Tunney asked
11 ayd en at the l.os Angeles Press (Hub to apologize
for comments he had made and for comments
made l>v I layden's wife.

military spending projects like the B-l Bomber
and for deregulation of gas prices.
Tunney claims that his opponent has been "dis
torting" his achievements and his policy stances.
"In my view we should have learned from
Watergate that no person who misrepresents his
opponent should he let into high public office,"
he says.
Opposition (o Nixon
The senator defends his record by emphasizing
his early opposition to the repressive actions of
the Nixon administration. He claims that his work
to stop t he appoi ntment of Pat (I ray as FBI director
and to challenge the power of ITT "set the
groundwork for" the Watergate investigations.
Tunney played a role in cutting U.S. involve
ment in Angola. Declaims that Gerald Ford's
repeated attempts to intervene show that "the les
sons of Vietnam have not been learned."
In a dramatic campaign encounter last week,
Tunney agreed to debate Hayden after Hayden
apologized to him in a face-to-face encounter.
The agreement came after Tunney asked
11 ayd en at the l.os Angeles Press (Hub to apologize
for comments he had made and for comments
made l>v I layden's wife.
Tho smoke is clearing among tho scramble of
democratic candidates for tho U.S. Senate seat
held by John Tunney.
At one time. Tunney led by as much ;is 4 to 1 in
voter preference polls and seemed destined for an
easy primary victory. Hut, '60s anti-war activist
Tom U;iyden and his wife, actress Jane Fonda,
have been campaigning hard and extending their
political base from far left into the maintstream of
the California Democratic party.
The last Field Poll, taken May 19, showed Tun
ney leading 50 percent to 33 percent, with 17
percent undecided or favoring other candidates.
In March, the poll had shown Tunney 58 percent,
llayden 15.
No fundraising problems
Neither candidate has had any visible trouble
raising money.
Tunney expects to spend between $650,000 and
$700,000 in the primary. He reported campaign
contributions of $479,791 through March 31.
llayden expects to spend $000,000 and has
raised $530,000.
Seven other candidates are waging campaigns
against the incumbent senator but have been un
able to make impressive showings in voter polls.
Campaign issues
Campaign issues have focused on Tunney's al
leged inconsistencies on issues, such as health
care, energy«and gas prices, and I layden's radical
image of the past.
Tunney told a crowd in White Plaza last Tues
day, "There is one basic issue in this campaign:
dishonesty — whether or not we can exorcise the
lifck of credibility in high government officials
and make them accountable."
llayden has said, "The issue that symbolizes
everything is that Tunney has betrayed bis 1970
pledge for a national health program." I le claims
thatTunney has put other priorities above "basic
human needs."
Fifteen years ago, llayden helped found the
Students for a DemocraticSooiety. In 1970, heand
six others were acquitted of conspiring to incite a
riot at the 1969 Democratic convention.
Voter reaction to his past, he says, is divided
into three groups: a smal I group that admires hi in,
a larger group that dislikes him, and the largest
group of all, that reacts to him with "curiosity,
puzzlement, skepticism but with a kind of open
ness I appreciate."

During ;i recent campaign speech, Hayden cal
led himself one of the "people who was right on
tough questions when it was wrong to be right."
Addressing businessmen at a luncheon in Sac
ramento, Hayden was asked if he would behave in
the Senate in the same way that he did in Judge
Julius Hoffman's courtroom. As a member of the
(Chicago Seven, Hayden was accused of disrupt
ing the trial.
"I'll tell you this. If there's another undeclared
war that's being escalated without people in high
office ciriticizing it, I think it would be certainly
justified to organize demonstrations," he said.
I ,ater in his campaign swing came another con
servative oriented question — Is the U.S. losing its
number one position? Hayden used it to
philosophize on international relations.
Number one
"The world is number one," he said. "No one is
going to be number one. The kind of respect
people give you when you're first in nuclear
stockpiles is the kind of respect one gives to a
bully. The future is going to be determined in the
hungrier eyes of the world."
