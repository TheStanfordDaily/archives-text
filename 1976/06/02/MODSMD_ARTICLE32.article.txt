# Shaskey, Harris compete in Dem. race for Congress
## 
### Kathryn Ma 
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey (R-
Menlo Park) of the 12th Congres
sional District is a figure of con
siderable political influence in
both California and the U.S.
Congress.
Since his outspoken opposi
tion to U.S. participation in the
Vietnamese war, McCloskey has
enjoyed the crucial support of
the Stanford community. This
year, however, he may face con
siderable opposition from the
Democratic contender for his
congressional seat.
Democratic constituents of t he
12th District will choose bet
ween candidates Norman Shas
key and David Harris in the
primary June 8. both candidates
claim to have experience in the
political process and both con
centrate their campaigns on is
sues of immediate domestic in
terest.
Shaskey, an M.A. in
economics and former student
body president of the University
of California at Santa Barbara, is
a governing board member of
I'oothi I l-De An/.a Community
College District.
He says he is better qualified
because he has held an elective
office and Harris has not. How
ever, his opponent, a former stu
dent body president at Stanford,
has involved himself in many
political activities.
Harris left Stanford in his
sophomore year to work in the
Mississippi civil rights move
ment. Soon after his return here
and election to the student body
presidency, he refused to accept
his student deferment to the
draft and an order to report for
induction into the U.S. Army
while American forces con
tinued to fight in Vietnam. Har
ris was sent to federal prison for
20 months. Since his release in
1971, he has worked as an editor
and journalist.
Shaskey positions
Shaskey advocates tax reform,
proposing a negative income tax
system and establishment ol
Educational Trust Accounts
(ETA). He has urged the U.S. Se
nate Committee on Finance to
create ETA by allowing a lax be
nefit for investment in educa
tion.

Parents could deduct up to
Siooo per year, setting aside
funds for the tuition and living
expenses of their children. The
tax-exempt accounts could be
used to pursue both educational
and vocational goals!
Shaskey also calls for extend
ing the processes of initiative
and referendum to the national
level. With these privileges, he
says, citizens would be able to
pass federal laws, but the Sup
reme Court would maintain the
right to declarea law unconstitu
tional.
Dollars and cents
Harris focuses his campaign
on "democracy in dollars and
cents." He quotes income dis
tribution figures and un
employment statistics as evi
dence that the Santa Clara V'al ley
has fallen victim to high taxes
and little public return.
Large oil companies and bank
ing and finance concerns are not
paying their fair share of taxes,
says Harris.
He proposes to begin
"economicreconstruction" with
tax cuts for consumers, lower in
terest rates that will stimulate
the economy and regulation of

prices in those industries where
monopolistic practices have ef
fectively eliminated competi
tion.
Moth promise to work for the
reduction of the present national
defense budget, but disagree on
the amount and areas of cut
backs.
Harris says the budget could
be cut by reducing the number of
U.S. troops overseas and dupli
cation of weapon systems. He
calls for a reorganization of in
dustries to "peacetime produc
tion" ifnd .1 cutback of $20 bill
ion in the defense budget.
Shaskey calls Harris' figures
unrealistic and advocates aâ€žcut
back of no more than $10 billion.
He attacks what he calls a "top
heavy" system of personnel in
tin? armed forces, specifically
noting what he says is a dispro
portionate ratio of admirals and
generals to enlisted men and
women.
Other major issues of Harris'
campaign include a promise to
work for increased social sec
urity benefits, broadened pen
sion plans, more public prog
rams and ending government
surveillance of private citizens.
