How can I go about finding out whether l (irn the only one on
cam/His who's olfended by the Ansley "Under Covers" column.
Whut do you think it moons that I <im? Who in the world is this Dave
Ansley tluit ha is able to write that stuffy Sure/v he makes up 90
pen ant of those questions. Personally I have had no experience
with sex (suspect lam missing a hormonej Inil I am quite certain
now, os a result of that gross column, that I should never wish to
have. Please don't respond with some platitude to the effect that I
don't have to read the column. -A.S.
Frankly, our staff has often pondered how many Daily readers
Haze at the cherubic photo of Ansley and wonder "Should I take sex
advice trom this man?" You're not alone in your worries about the
column. President Richard Lyman once confided in our staff that
his most horrifying nightmare was that Ansley would call him for
information.
Ansley himself remarked that your letter reminded him of a joke
about how to make a hormone. Something about "pulling out
early," but he said you probably wouldn't get the joke. When
pressed for further comment, he responded with that aforemen
tioned platitude.
It might please you to know that Ansley probably won't be
writing the column after this year since next fall he will be at
Stanford in Britain, exploring important English issues like tin;
repercussions of the I'rofumo sex scandal.
However, Ansley has lately been observed ga/.ing wistfully ;it
back issues of the National Enquirer. So perhaps one; day you'll
pick up a story headlined "Child Trapped in Refrigerator Eats Own
Foot!" with the infamous by-line "By Dave Ansley." Then you can
smile fondly and say to the next passerby, "1 knew him when he
was writing about dildos!"

Why does eating asparagus give you smelly urine? -B.li.
You should feel honored to learn that only one-fourth of all
people do undergo this chemical change after consuming the veg
etable. However, that's enough to guarantee that hospitals, on the
request of their nurses, never serve asparagus to bed-ridden pa
tients.
II your urine does, smell bad, you lack an enzyme called as
pariginase, accordi ng to Ed Messing, a resident in urology at Stan
lord I lospi tab I'his enzyme breaks down asparagene (one root word
goes a long way in the medical profession!), an acid found in
asparagus, into aspartic acid.
However, il you don't have this enzyme, asparagene remains
aspragene and smells. Since lack ol the enzyme is a recessive
characteristic, you must have inherited it from both parents. And
you may pass it on to your children.
