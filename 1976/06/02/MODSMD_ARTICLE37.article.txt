Legislature passes nuclear safety bills
SACRAMENTO — A three-bill nuclear safety package
giving California the nation's toughest nuclear regula
tions won narrow state Senate and Assembly approval
yesterday — moving it to the governor's desk.
With two votes to spare, the Senate sent the package to
the Assembly where approval of Senate amendments was
voted later in the day. sending the bills to Gov. Edmund
Brown Jr., who says he'll sign them.
The legislature acted one week before the June 8
California primary when voters decidethe fate of theNuc
lear Power Plants Initiative, Prop. 15. which has far more
stringent safety provisions.
The bills would give the legislature the unprecedented
power to ban new nuclear power plants if the lawmakers
feel further development is too risky.
Sen Alfred Alquist (D-San Jose), a leading foe of Prop.
15, urged passage of the bills because he hoped they
would "influence" voters to reject the initiative.
The bills would;
—Permit the legislature to halt new plant construction
i! either house by majority vote finds that nuclear fuel
recycling and waste storing methods are inadequate.
—Require a study on the feasibility of building reactors
underground, which backers say could minimize the pub
lit. danger from a core meltdown.
The bills exempt existing nuclear plants and those
under constructions main difference between the legisla
tion and the initiative, which is retroactive.
Syrian troops advance on Beirut
BEIRUT. Lebanon — Syrian troops backed by tanks
advanced on Beirut yesterday after crossing into Lebanon
in a major effort to hali I ho Lebanese civil war. Palestinian
guerrillas reported. An Israeli official said the invasion
has not tipped the scale toward Israeli intervention.
The guerrillas said about 7000 troops backed by 150
tanks breached the eastern border overnight while an ad
ditional 2000 Syrian soldiers invaded from the north.
In Washington a Pentagon spokesman said the reports
were exaggerated.
The Palestinians said the Syrian troops halted Moslem
assaults on three Christian towns and disarmed guerrillas
and militiamen on main roads.
Palestinian and Syrian sources said the invasion was
tlit> first step toward the total occupation of Lebanon to
forcibly wrench apart the seemingly irreconcilable right
wing Christians and Moslem leftists. Their 14-month-old
war has killed more than 26,000 persons.
But the Moslem-controlled Beirut Radio said: "Damas
cus has assured Lebanon the intervention is designed only
to help President-elect Elias Sarkis assume the reins of
power under conditions of re-established security."
Previous incursions by smaller Syrian forces have failed
to quell the fighting.
Hays refuses to quit despite scandal
WASHINGTON — Rep. Wayne Hays said yesterday he
won't give up control of two powerful committees without
a fight, despite pressure from congressional colleagues to
do so.
"I havea lot of enemies out Ihere who'want myhead.l'm
not going to give it to them on a silver platter," said the
Ohio Democrat, under federal investigation in a payroll
sex scandal.
Mays spoke to reporters shortly after a federal judge
ordered lawyers not to give inside information to reporters
about the investigation. The judge acted in response to a
Justice Department plea that such statements "might pro
vide fuel and inflame the situation."
House speaker Carl Albert and Democrat Leader
Thomas P. O'Neill refused to say whether they will ask
Hays to resign his committee posts but said they will
speak with him.

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yesterday struck
down a federal regulation which banned permanent resi
dent aliens from government jobs.
The 5-4 decision clears the way for millions of aliens to
seek, federal jobs all over the country, ranging from
janitors to secretaries to middle-level administrators.
In an opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens, the court
ruled that the Civil Service Commission unconstitution
ally deprived aliens of liberty without due process of law.

benefits to aliens only after they have lived in the United
States for at least five years and have been admitted for
permanent residence.
