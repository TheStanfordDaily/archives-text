# Solzhenitsyn hits today's 'freedom'

### Bonny Rodden 
Nobel laureate and Hoover lei low
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn criticized the
tendency of free societies to take
"boundless pleasure in material
goods" as the Valley Forge Freedoms
Foundation presented him with the
American Friendship Award yester
day.
Solzhenitsyn lamented that con
temporary civilized freedom has been
relegated "almost exclusively to free
dom from outside pressure, to freedom
from state coercion — to freedom un
derstood only on the judicial level,
and no higher."
There is little concern with "free
dom that elevates the human kind." he
remarked.
Solzhenitsyn said that it would be
"easiest to give way to rhetoric on the
dark abysms of totalitarianism," but
that it would be more productive to
"take a hard look at ourselves."

Freedom today means freedom for
the media to "impose information,"
for teenagers to "immerse themselves
in idleness and amusements." for
politicians to indiscriminately "bring
about whatever pleases the voter to
day" and for terrorists to escape
punishment, according to Solzhenit
syn.
"All these freedoms are often irrep
roachable judicially, but morally all
are faulty." he said.
The "highest form of freedom . . .
which consists not in maneuvering be
tween articles of laws.but in voluntary
self-restraint and in full consciousness
of responsibility." does not exist any
where in the modern world, Sol
zhenitsyn complained.
Valley Forge Freedoms Foundation
President Robert Miller praised Sol
zhenitsyn for his "fearless and un
swerving commitment to the cause of
world freedom."
