Commencement ceremonies
This year's commencement cere
mony will be different from last year's,

After the main ceremony in Frost
Amphitheatre, the proceedings will
break down into about 30 smaller
groups for the diploma-awarding
ceremonies.
The cost for the diploma-awarding
ceremonies this year will be split bet
ween the Office of Public Events and
the seven schools within the Univer

schools to pay all of the costs for the
diploma-awarding ceremonies next
year.

Addendum
Dave Ansley wrote the May 27 Daily
feature, "Massage: Sensuality or sexu
ality?"
Clarification
In the May 2H Daily, the photo cap
tion accompanying the story on the
Delta Tau Delta (Delts) fraternity sus
pension stated that a wall in the Beta
Theta Pi was kicked in. Actually, the
hole in the wall was caused by one of
the Delts pushing another Delt into the
wall.
