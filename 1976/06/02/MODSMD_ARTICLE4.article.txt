### Lori Matsukawa 
In an emergency meeting last night,
the ASSU Senate passed a resolution
expressing "grave concern" over the
"absence of a judicial proceeding"
prior to the suspension of Delta Tau
Delta (Delts) fraternity from campus.
The senate also approved a report
from the financial manager and ap
proved three amendments to the ASSU
Bylaws.
The resolution, introduced by Sen.
Bob Ottilie. also urged that Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs I.arrv Horton's
decision to suspend the Delts from
campus be reconsidered and over
turned.
"The ones penalized most (bythe de
cision) are the pledges who weren't
involved at all." said Ottilie. "Discip
linary actions should be taken against
individuals, not the fraternity as a
whole."
The resolution passed 11-0-1, with
Sen. Sharon Veach abstaining.
ASSU Financial Manager Chris
Clitie presented an investment policy
written by the Ad-Hoc Investment
Committee recommending that no
more than H5 percent of ASSU long
term assets be invested in common
stock.
"We tried to Find an investment veh
icle that would give us the highest re
turn in the long run within our re
straints," said Cline.
Cline also recommended that a
committee composed of a representa
tive from the Office of the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs, a representative of the di
rector of finance, the chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee, the stu
dent representative to the Board of
Trustee's Committee on Investments
and the student financial manager re
view ASSU investments in April and
October every year.
The bylaws amendments, passed by
a vote of 9-2, officially recognize the
Legal Counseling Office, legally create
the position of committee staff assis
tant and require a 2/3 vote of the senate
to overturn'a decision of the Publica
tions Board.
The senate unanimously approved a
bill submitted by Sen. Kevin McDer
mott awarding Cline a $500 bonus for
"doing a lot (for the ASSU) above and
beyond his duty" as financial man
ager.
