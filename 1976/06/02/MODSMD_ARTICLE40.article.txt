# Baseball star Johnny Bench exudes self- confidence
## 
### Jill Lieber 
The Cincinnati Reds were in town to play
some baseball with the Giants. In the lobby of
San Francisco's Sheraton Palace Hotel, tower
in", powerful men sauntering about in flashy
sports coats were the quarry of numerous fans
and autograph hunters.
The Reds' most popular player hid in his
room until it was al most time to board the team
bus to Candlestick I'ark. When catcher Johnny
Bench finally appeared at the main desk to
check out, he was disguised by a pair of
sunglasses which almost covered his face.
After completing his business he hurried
into the breakfast room, lie was shorter and
stockier than his photographs had indicated.
11(! apologized lor being late and said that he
had a lot of things to take care of and that he
never likes to,feel rushed.
lint Bench has always rushed. He attained

his goals quickly and now is one of baseball's
superstars.
The Reds draf ted the Oklahoma native when
he was 17 and put him in their farm system. At
Peninsula in the Carolina League, his uniform
was retired after he broke the club's home run
record with 22 in 98 games.
Moving up to Buffalo in 1967, he was named
Minor League Player of the Year. The next sea
son he became Cincinnati's No. 1 catcher. He
was the tirst receiver ever to win Rookie of the
Year honors.
"Johnny just does things other catchers can't
do." Sparky Anderson, Bench's manager, has
said. "There is no one who can come up throw
ing quicker than John. Johnny will grab a ball
that is insideand be in a throwing motion all at
the same time. He has a way of fielding a bunt
in tront ot the plate so that as he picks it up he is
bounding back to throw."

Bench admits that he is the best catcher in
the National League.
"I do more things. 1 throw. 1 hit — and I think
hitting adds a great dimension to it overall. I
drive in more runs and hit more home runs."
he says.
What kind of person is a good catcher?
"Somebody that can endure pain, have the
mental concentration and physical ability.
You've got to put up with it everyday."
Bench said that even though baseball gets
"old" to him after seven months of playing day
after day, each game is still exciting.
"When you win, the thrill is always there.
I'm in a different position because being a
catcher I have to get up every time. 1 have to go
out there every time and catch that pitch. If I
don't 1 can look like a monkey running around
in a cage."

Jim Ferguson, director of publicity for the
Reds, has said that Bench has an "infectious
charisma." The 28-year-old Bench has gained
the image of a playboy. His marriage of six
months recently ended in divorce.
When female fans come to the dugout before
games he often wi nksor playfully sticks out his
tongue. Still life is often lonely for Bench. He
has learned to sort out those people who want
to know him because of his stature in the
baseball world. And he has tried to ileal with
the constant deluge of autograph seekers.
"They don't understand that when you're
out there you've got to play baseball." he said.
"They think they're the only ones. You'vegot a
certain time for your own game plan that you
have to prepare yourself. You have to throw,
hit, run. exercise, and there's limited time that
you have to sign autographs. People aren't pa
tient. You just can't sign one autograph — you

start on one and you want to sign them all."
Bench enjoys his success.
"It's something that you cope with on a
reasonable basis. You have to realize exactly
where your feet are and where you're going. If
you have all those things in perspective then
it's easier to cope with. You see some players
who really think they area success and they are
struggling on the borderline of mediocrity. So,
as a result, they really exist in a fantasy world."
Johnny is confident, imperturbable and the
supreme believer in his own worth.
"There are too many false things in the
world," he says, "anil I don't want to be part of
them. It you say what you think, you're called
cocky or conceited. But if you have an object in
life, you shouldn't be afraid to stand up and say
it:
"1 want to be the greatest catcher ever to plav
the game."

had a lot of things to take care of and that he

lint Bench has always rushed. He attained

his goals quickly and now is one of baseball's
superstars.
The Reds draf ted the Oklahoma native when
he was 17 and put him in their farm system. At
Peninsula in the Carolina League, his uniform
was retired after he broke the club's home run
record with 22 in 98 games.
Moving up to Buffalo in 1967, he was named
Minor League Player of the Year. The next sea
son he became Cincinnati's No. 1 catcher. He
was the tirst receiver ever to win Rookie of the
Year honors.
"Johnny just does things other catchers can't
do." Sparky Anderson, Bench's manager, has
said. "There is no one who can come up throw
ing quicker than John. Johnny will grab a ball
that is insideand be in a throwing motion all at
the same time. He has a way of fielding a bunt
in tront ot the plate so that as he picks it up he is
bounding back to throw."

Bench admits that he is the best catcher in
the National League.
"I do more things. 1 throw. 1 hit — and I think
hitting adds a great dimension to it overall. I
drive in more runs and hit more home runs."
he says.
What kind of person is a good catcher?
"Somebody that can endure pain, have the
mental concentration and physical ability.
You've got to put up with it everyday."
Bench said that even though baseball gets
"old" to him after seven months of playing day
after day, each game is still exciting.
"When you win, the thrill is always there.
I'm in a different position because being a
catcher I have to get up every time. 1 have to go
out there every time and catch that pitch. If I
don't 1 can look like a monkey running around
in a cage."

Jim Ferguson, director of publicity for the
Reds, has said that Bench has an "infectious
charisma." The 28-year-old Bench has gained
the image of a playboy. His marriage of six
months recently ended in divorce.
When female fans come to the dugout before
games he often wi nksor playfully sticks out his
tongue. Still life is often lonely for Bench. He
has learned to sort out those people who want
to know him because of his stature in the
baseball world. And he has tried to ileal with
the constant deluge of autograph seekers.
"They don't understand that when you're
out there you've got to play baseball." he said.
"They think they're the only ones. You'vegot a
certain time for your own game plan that you
have to prepare yourself. You have to throw,
hit, run. exercise, and there's limited time that
you have to sign autographs. People aren't pa
tient. You just can't sign one autograph — you

start on one and you want to sign them all."
Bench enjoys his success.
"It's something that you cope with on a
reasonable basis. You have to realize exactly
where your feet are and where you're going. If
you have all those things in perspective then
it's easier to cope with. You see some players
who really think they area success and they are
struggling on the borderline of mediocrity. So,
as a result, they really exist in a fantasy world."
Johnny is confident, imperturbable and the
supreme believer in his own worth.
"There are too many false things in the
world," he says, "anil I don't want to be part of
them. It you say what you think, you're called
cocky or conceited. But if you have an object in
life, you shouldn't be afraid to stand up and say
it:
