The student-faculty committee re
viewing the Honor Code "Is not going
to make any recommendations this
year," according to Philosophy Prof.
Emeritus Philip Rhinelander. the ail
ing chairman of tin; committee.
Rhinelander, who chaired last Fri
day's closed meeting of the Student
Conduct Legislative Council fSCLC)',
said that since the results of ttOO ques
tionnaires on attitudes toward the
Honor (lode have not been completely
tabulated, "we have decided not to
make any recommendation pending
further analysis of the data."
Rhinelander added, however, that
he believes it is likely that (Mathema
tics Dept. Vice Chairman) Paul Berg
(the chairman of tin; SCLC) would
draft some preliminary recommenda
tions and mail them to committee
membets this summer." lit; declined

to speculate on what the recommenda
tions might be. Berg was not available
for comment.
Rhinelander said that slightly over
halt of the student questionnaires have
been returned, "which is," he said,
"statistically significant."
I In said that tin; responses have been
partially tabulated but declined togive
the results. "We feel that if this infor
mation is released piecemeal, it will be
open to misinterpretation," he said.
None of the other committee mem
bers would comment on whether the
incomplete returns indicated approval
or disapproval of the Honor ("ode.
Student member Cregg Densmore
said. "One thing was that people see
themselves as honest, but they see
others as more dishonest than them
selves I guess that's just human na
ture."
