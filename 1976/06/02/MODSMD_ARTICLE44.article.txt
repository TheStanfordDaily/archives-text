# Present residency
## New frosh to lose residence priority 
### Lori Matsukawa 
Freshmen will definitely not receive
present residence housing priority
next ye t ir, according to Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Morton.
The Office of Residential Education
"fully accepted the recommendations
of the COSS (Committee on Services to
Students), Subcommittee on Resi
dences," said Morton.
The subcommittee recommended in
December that freshman housing
priority be eliminated. It also recom
mended changes in residence staff
selection procedures and a re
evaluation of the resident fellow selec
tion process.
Asa result of the decision, freshmen
will not have priority for their resi
dences in next spring's housing draw.
No effect
The elimination of freshman present
residence priority will not affect cur
rently enrolled students.
Next year's prospective freshmen
were told of this new policy "in their
letters" even though "they probably
don't know anything" about its sig
nificance, according to Morton.
COSS Subcommittee on Mousing
Chairperson Paul Sobotka said the
committee "has the option to review
the elimination of the present resi
dence recommendation again next
year" but that next year's freshmen
will "definitely not" have present re
sidence priority.

Jo Sailor, a house associate (KA) at
Branner Hall, a freshman dorm, said
she agreed withCOSS's recommenda
tion, saying that the present residency
priority system was "not fair for the
freshmen who lived in all-freshman
houses."
All or none
"Either everybody should have pre
sent residency priority or no one
should," Sauer said.

C -lark Carrol, an KA at Otero, a four
class coed dorm, said he had "two
reactions" to the decision.
"I have a moral objection to the tak
ing away of the benefits of a few
(freshmen living in four-class houses)
to equalize the situation of the many,"
said Carrol. "I3ul in termsot equality of
housing assignments, I agree with the
COSS subcommittee."
Carrol said the current residence
priority system encourages students to
live in four-class dorms merely to gain
housing priority.
"A freshman shouldn't have to
forego the all-freshman dorm experi
ence just to gain present residence
priority in a four-class dorm," he said.
