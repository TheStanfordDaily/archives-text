# University shifts computing lineup
## Administrative, student users should benefit 
### Dan Fiduccia John Freed 
The University is leasing a new
computer in addition to its present
IHM 10H to handle certain adminis
trative work, according to Charles
Dickens, director of the Stanford
Center for Information Processing
(SCIP).
The new computer, an IHM 135,
processes "student services" data
including registration, grades,
student information and housing.
The lease runs through October.
Plans for transferring all student
services data to the 108 were scrap
ped in February because of an un
expected overload on the 10H and
an apparent "mismatch" of the stu
dent services system with the new
computer. Dickens said then.
Student services had been han
dled on an IHM 145 in the Kncina
Hall computation center. The 145
was sold, with a May 1 removal date
set. before the transfer plans were
killed.
Ultimate plan
"The present plan is to transfer it
(student services) to the 10H," said
Dickens.
However, all plans for transfer
ring student services data are under
review and an outside consulting
firm has been brought in to study
student services computing, said
Dickens.
"We're reviewing the future of
student services systems." Dickens
said.
Registrar Sally Mahoney said the
student services data conversion to
a SPIRES-based software system on
the IHM 370/1 OH was suspended be
cause of "obvious difficulties in re
sponse time."
"Theoperating system on the; 10H
would not sustain an additional
data-based system," said Mahoney.
Mahoney explainer) that the
OASIS-based system which has
been used here for several years
cannot operate on the IHM 1'

can operate on an IHM 135.
SPIRES is a generalized data-base
management system for informa
tion retrieval; OASIS is a more
specialized management system
designed for handling a universi
ty's information.
Mahoney said the University is
currently looking for both an in
terim and a long-range computer
system to replace the current
OASIS system.
Interim system
"We're looking for an interim
system that would do what the
SIMRES-based system was planned
to do but didn't," said Mahoney.
Possible interim system alterna
tives include either continued use
of the IHM 135 or using a different
OASIS system on the IHM 10H.
After an interim system is found
the University will begin studying
possible long-range target systems,
Mahoney explained.
This long-range system could be
the long-awaited conversion to the
IHM 1 OH.
"Our goal has been for three years
to operate on the 10H," said
Mahoney.
Target computer
However, the eventual long
range target system "may not be on
the 10H," Mahoney said.
A SCIP report released in March
1075, authored by Dickens, Assoc.
Provost for Computing Cene
I ranklin and other SCIP personnel,
recommended the purchasing ol
the IHM 10H. The report recom
mended that the University pur
chase "t he IHM 1 OH processor as t he
most attractive choice tor a consoli
dated (computer) center."
The report urged tin; purchase of
the IHM because "the single 10H al
ternative is the only one of the three
alternatives considered which pro

A student-oriented "problem
solving" computer system may be
installed as early as fall quarter, ac
cording to Assoc. Provost for Com
puting Cene Franklin.
The system will be built for gen
eral student access to "interactive,"
or person-to-computer-to-person,
computing.
"We would buy another compu
ter," Franklin said, "with the fol
lowing characteristics:
—primarily devoted to classroom
instruction;
—no specific dollar accounting at
the student user level;
—funded from the University
computing fund."
Access to the present IHM 10H at
the Stanford Center for Information
Processing (SCIP) is controlled by a
system of "credits": persons within
the University, such as computer
science students, must obtain cash
eredi t before t hey are a I lowed to use
the system.
I Jsers not affiliated with the I Jni
versity must pay actual cash to gain
access to the system.
With the present system, "in
stead of getting $20 to get your CS
1 05 programs done, you'll be given
an assignment to do" on the new
machine, franklin said
$400,000 price tag
The new computer, called a Low
Overhead Timesharing System
(I.OTS). would cost about $400,000
to buy and about $250,000 to
$.'{oo,ooo a year to operate. Franklin
estimated.
The expenditure proposal will go
before the Hoard of Trustees at their
meeting June 11. Franklin said he is
"very optimistic" that the trustees
will approve the plan
One critical aspect of the plan is
the "low overhead" mentioned in
the name. Franklin said
"We're going to minimize the
workers involved. We're thinking

ol it stuff of three professionals and
one student wlio might take a year
oil. They would work extensively
with TAs (((Niching assistants) and
students in consulting," he said.
A proposal for a similar system
was made "about two and a half
years ago" by Computer Science
I'rof. John McCarthy, franklin said.
Franklin and McCarthy agreed that
tilt; plan was axed because costs
were higher then.
Hut impetus for I Ik; revised LOTS
system came from dissatisfaction
with SCII' services to students,
McCarthy s;iid.
"As far as dissatisfaction goes, it
has more recently reached a point
where action is impel led," he said.
Students are at the bottom ol the
totem pole at SCII', according to
Steven IJhlir, a junior majoring in
physics.
"As long as it (l,()TS) is not run
by SCII' it'll be okay. SCII' has an
incredible bureaucracy, and unless
you have a bureaucracy ol your own
to fight back with you're out of
luck." I Ihlir claimed.
McCarthy voiced cautious ag
reement.
"SCII' has something like .150
employes (including SI.AC). To try
to make some competitive service
with three (staffers) will require
some tolerance on the part of the
users." McCarthy observed.
'Quite feasible'
"I think the scheme is quite feasi
ble," he added. "The people who
think SCII' has been doing (student
services) incorrectly think SCII'
should not he in any p.irt of tin;
chain of command whatsoever."
Charles I Jickens, director of SCII*,
said I.OTS may not come under the
jurisdiction of S(111'.
No heavy funds
"That hasn't been directly de
cided." he said. "Tim important
thing is the students' and inslruc
tors' participation. It's not a heavily
funded facility. To be successful,
it'll require a lot of student and in
structor involvement."
Dickens said the LOTS concept
has been understudy for some time
at SCIP.
"Even if (LOTS did fall under
SCIP), it would have to retain that
character — not be run by a profes
sional staff. The idea is to provide a
style of computing which is not
predefined," Dickens said.
According to Uhlir, however, the
"character" of LOTS would be lost
in a maze of bureaucrats at SCIP.

"The SCIP bureaucracy would
tend to swallow it." Uhlir charged.
"Also. I know a lot of students who
would refuse to work on it (LOTS) if
it is run by SCIP."
The LOTS system was formally
proposed by a University Advisory
Committee on Computer Science,
composed of "distinguished com
puter science users, professors and
experts from outside the Univer
sity," according to Franklin.
After tin; proposal was made, it
was worked on by Franklin and the
Committee on Computation
Facilities, Franklin said.
