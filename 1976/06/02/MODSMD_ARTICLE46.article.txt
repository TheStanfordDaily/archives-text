The cops-and-robbers aspect
of the Symbionese Liberation
Army's brief existence long ago
ceased to have any meaning.
Certainly there was a time when
it all seemed very mysterious
and exciting, but the toll of
human lives and psyches over
the past two years is anything
but exciting. Seven people are
dead, six are in prison, several
have fled underground, and
countless others are irredeema
bly cynical. frightened or angry.
The seven-headed cobra is gone;
instead, we have the drawn,
pathetic face of I'attv Hearst,
ruthlessly manipulated first by
media-freaking radicals and
then by the very law enforce
ment bureaucracy that was sup
posed to protect her. Excite
ment? There is no longer any
thing but infinite, unhealing
pain.
II is an appropriate time for
Fred Soltvsik's In Search of a
Sister, not so much a book as a
raging, inarticulate scream
against all that happened in that
strange spring of 1974. The sister
is Mizmoon Soltysik — "female
guerilla, perfect love and perfect
hate reflected in stone cold
eyes," as I'attv Hearst described

her on that final tape.
"She moved viciously and
with caution," Patty said of
Mizmoon. "understanding the
peril of the smallest mistake. She
taught me 'keep your ass down
and be bad.' " That is not, of
course, the way Fred remembers
her. His sister was a hard
working president of the Dos
Pueblos High School Usherettes,
puzzled by sex and vaguely in
terested in marijuana, busily
preparing for her first year at
I JC-Berkeley.
Which is real?
Which of those persons is
real? Fred, after his long and an
guished search — literally,
through the streets of the Bay
Area, and figuratively, through
boxes of her poetry and letters —
concludes they both existed.
Sometime during her years in
the ideological cesspool of Ber
keley, Mizmoon concluded that
life was a paradox: She believed
that "there's very little meaning
to anything, while at the same
time feeling that people's suffer
ing means everything."
Unable to cope, unable to take
her brother's advice that "the
.only courageous and meaning
ful action in a world where order
seems absurd or not apparent at
all is to act as if there were some
good and there were some fun

damental values," she decided
to pick up a gun. Mizmoon.
along with Nanrty Ling Perry and
Donald David DeFreeze, became
a major SLA theoretician. She
probably assisted in the Marcus

Foster murder and the Hearst
kidnaping, and cameras in the
Hibernia Bank recorded her pre
sence during the robbery there in
graphic and — for Fred —
frightening detail.

Fred also suspects that Miz
moon's inability to form mean
ingful relationships with other
individuals propelled her to
wards the SLA's suicidal effort
on behalf of the oppressed mas

ses. In high school a boyfriend
called her "catlike . . .a fantastic
and deceiving manipulator of
people." Later she admitted that
she couldn't be faithful to any of
her lovers, and even within the
SLA she found problems.
Among her poems Fred found
this description of Mizmoon's
comrade Willie Wolfe:
Willy ... I hate him
I ivant to scream
next time he touches me
Get your God Damned Hand Off
My Body!
I hut his hands ne\ er were)
damned . . . he's bein' only
friendly. . .
Intellectual understanding
But reaching an intellectual
understanding of what hap
pened doesn't make emotional
comprehension any easier. As he
tramps through Berkeley's seedy
counter-culture, Fred bitterly re
flects on the bitter confronta
tions that took place more and
more olten us her political drift
became clear. Mizmoon was
"going to fucking crucify herself
for the people, the masses, the
third world," he screamed at her
shortly before she disappeared,
"and no one is going to benefit
from it because you're no god
damned Christ. . . your rhetoric,
you know your rhetoric isn't
even yours! You can hear it on a

thousand street corners and it's
worn, it's empty, it's presump
tuous because nothing you do
for people will last because you
did it and not the people them
selves."
Fred finally forces himself to
admit th.it even it he finds Miz
moon, she won't go with him
but it didn't make any differ
ence. really. The Los Angeles
Police Department found her
first, on her 24th birthday. As <1
horrified Soltysik family
watched on live television,
Mizmoon died in the flames of
the house on 54th Street. "My
birthday once again," she had
written the year before. "Every
year it seems to come just after
the beginnings of big change."
In Search of a Sister is in
many ways a poor book. The
writing is cluttered, clumsy, and
often trite; it is filled with un
answered questions, senseless
and mystifying clues that Fred
doesn't bother to follow up. It is
not intended to be a documen
tary study of the SLA, but a rivet
ing narrative of personal an
guish. "I feel compelled to find a
meaning in Mizmoon'? death,"
Fred writes, "but 1 cannot pro
vide one." So many broken lives
later, his words are the best
epitaph for the SLA.
