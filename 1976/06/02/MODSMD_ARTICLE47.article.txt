l-or yearsEugenio Montale has
been recognized as Italy's
greatest living poet. His work
has been translated and discus
sed in virtually every European
language, and he has received
honorary degrees and prizes all
over the continent. Last year his
career reached its slow climax
when Montale received the
world's most prestigious and
lucrative literary honor, the
Nobel Prize.
His output is very small in
deed. I le has published only six
slender volumes of poetry in
over 50 years of writing. Mon
tale's enduring reputation is a
testament to the quality of those
tiny volumes. One can think of
few poets except T.S. Eliot
(whom Montale has translated)
who haveachieved international
reputations on such a small body
of work.
When Montale won the Nobel
Prize, Time displayed more than
its usual ignorance by calling
him an "obscure" poet "virtu
ally unknown" outside his na
tive land. Indeed, virtually every
liv ing poet is obscure even in his

native land. One wonders how
many living European poets the
book editor of Time could name.
Good luck
Lor being "virtually un
known" Montale has had good
luck in English. His translators
have included Robert Lowell.
Mario Prax and James Merrill.
His critical champions have
numbered the indefatigable L.R.
Leavis and Stephen Spender.
Several magazines have devoted
issues to his work, and several
volumes of his poetry have been
translated.
The publication of Montale's
New Poems in English has filled
the one remaining gap. While
much of Montale's recent work
has been translated into English,
it has never been collected be-

Montale has always felt
alienated from life

fore in book form. This new vol
ume! should prove what a loss
that has been. These new transla
tions by (!. Singh (who has also
written an excellent critical
study ol Montale) are excellent
enough that most of the poems'
original strength comes through.
Montale's New Poems is a
stunning volume that makes
most books of contemporary
poetry look trivial in compari
son. These late poems are more
direct and personal than any

thing Montale wrote before. In
their simple, unaggressive way
they show why many people
consider Montale Europe's
greatest living poet.
Personal reflections
When Montale wrote these
poems, he was over 70 years old.
They are deeply personal reflec
tions on his life. He speaks
mostly of loss, specifically the
death of his wife. Mosca:
Your astounding face lingers
still,
carved against the morning's
chalky
background; but a life ivithout
iv ings
can't ivach it and its suffo
cated lire
is no more than the flash of a
lighter
Montale has always felt alien
ated from life. His early work
was suffused vyith a sense of sep
aration from the world. Hut in
these late poems this authentic
and profound feeling of isolation
achieves a more natural outlet.
But living beyond his wife and
friends. Montale's contempla
tive and social lives merged. His
vision and style found a pas
sionate emotional subject in his
unreachable separation from his
dead companions.
These are the poems of an old
man looking back on his life. Yet
they have as much energy as any
poems Montale ever wrote. In
many ways their eloquent
simplicity mhkes them more ef

fective and moving than his
early work. Like Yeats and
Stephens. Montale has broken
new ground in his old age and
produced many of his finest
poems.

These are the poems of
an old man. . .

It was I hen (hat we discovered

with time,
it is something which makes
us say
we are here, a miracle that

trast
youth is the vilest of all illu
sions.
Uselessness

agines' a broken, antique clock
commenting on its uselessness:
I who was Time, abandon it.
and say to you. my only lis
tener.
try to live outside of time
which no one can measure.
In these poems Montale he
comes a philosophic poet in the
best sense of the word. I Le deals
with the chief facts of human
existence, notably th.it time is ir
reversibly running towards
death. But from this bleak basis
he articulates a stoic set of posi
tive values. He seeks a way to

live honestly and fully in the
time he has. In one poem he
writes to a graduate student who
has written a thesis on the de
cline of values:
Tour up your pages, throw
thorn in the sewer,
take no degree in anything,
and you will beable tosay that
you were
perhaps alive for a moment or
an instant.
One problem
There is only one problem
with this edition of Montale's
New Poems. There is no Italian
text facing the translations.
Singh's English versions are
admirable, but there is really no
excuse-for not including the
originals.
Most people, who are in
terested in reading modern
poetry, will know at least one
romance language if not Italian
in particular. In this edition they
are denied the opportunity of
examining the real poem in
Montale's Italian. I am not one of
those who believe that all of a
poem disappears in translation,
but I do feel that it is obviously
diminished even in the best ver
sion.
In recent years Italian poetry
has been gaining a much larger
international audience. Since
Montale's contemporary, the
late Salvatore Quasimodo, won
the Nobel Prize in 1959, transla
tions and criticism of Italian
poets has been increasing. There
is no longer any excuse for

American readers to be ignorant
of this important branch of mod
ern poetry.
This translation of Montale's
New Poems is certainly one of

the most important hooks of
poetry published this year. It of
fers a compelling and direct in
troduction to one of the greatest
poets of our time.

l-or yearsEugenio Montale has
been recognized as Italy's
greatest living poet. His work
has been translated and discus

language, and he has received
honorary degrees and prizes all
over the continent. Last year his
career reached its slow climax
when Montale received the
world's most prestigious and
lucrative literary honor, the
Nobel Prize.
His output is very small in
deed. I le has published only six
slender volumes of poetry in
over 50 years of writing. Mon
tale's enduring reputation is a
testament to the quality of those
tiny volumes. One can think of
few poets except T.S. Eliot
(whom Montale has translated)
who haveachieved international
reputations on such a small body
of work.
When Montale won the Nobel
Prize, Time displayed more than
its usual ignorance by calling
him an "obscure" poet "virtu
ally unknown" outside his na
tive land. Indeed, virtually every
liv ing poet is obscure even in his

native land. One wonders how
many living European poets the
book editor of Time could name.
Good luck

known" Montale has had good
luck in English. His translators
have included Robert Lowell.
Mario Prax and James Merrill.
His critical champions have

Leavis and Stephen Spender.

issues to his work, and several

enough that most of the poems'
original strength comes through.
Montale's New Poems is a
stunning volume that makes
most books of contemporary
poetry look trivial in compari

direct and personal than any

thing Montale wrote before. In
their simple, unaggressive way
they show why many people
consider Montale Europe's
greatest living poet.
Personal reflections
When Montale wrote these
poems, he was over 70 years old.
They are deeply personal reflec

mostly of loss, specifically the
death of his wife. Mosca:

Montale has always felt alien
ated from life. His early work
was suffused vyith a sense of sep
aration from the world. Hut in
these late poems this authentic
and profound feeling of isolation
achieves a more natural outlet.
But living beyond his wife and
friends. Montale's contempla
tive and social lives merged. His
vision and style found a pas
sionate emotional subject in his
unreachable separation from his
dead companions.
These are the poems of an old
man looking back on his life. Yet
they have as much energy as any
poems Montale ever wrote. In
many ways their eloquent
simplicity mhkes them more ef

fective and moving than his
early work. Like Yeats and
Stephens. Montale has broken
new ground in his old age and
produced many of his finest
poems.

existence, notably th.it time is ir

death. But from this bleak basis
he articulates a stoic set of posi

live honestly and fully in the
time he has. In one poem he
writes to a graduate student who
has written a thesis on the de

death. But from this bleak basis
he articulates a stoic set of posi
tive values. He seeks a way to

live honestly and fully in the
time he has. In one poem he
writes to a graduate student who
has written a thesis on the de
cline of values:
Tour up your pages, throw
thorn in the sewer,
take no degree in anything,
and you will beable tosay that
you were
perhaps alive for a moment or
an instant.
One problem
There is only one problem
with this edition of Montale's
New Poems. There is no Italian
text facing the translations.
Singh's English versions are
admirable, but there is really no
excuse-for not including the
originals.
Most people, who are in
terested in reading modern
poetry, will know at least one
romance language if not Italian
in particular. In this edition they
are denied the opportunity of
examining the real poem in
Montale's Italian. I am not one of
those who believe that all of a
poem disappears in translation,
but I do feel that it is obviously
diminished even in the best ver
sion.
In recent years Italian poetry
has been gaining a much larger
international audience. Since
Montale's contemporary, the
late Salvatore Quasimodo, won
the Nobel Prize in 1959, transla
tions and criticism of Italian
poets has been increasing. There
is no longer any excuse for

American readers to be ignorant
of this important branch of mod
ern poetry.
This translation of Montale's
New Poems is certainly one of

the most important hooks of
poetry published this year. It of
fers a compelling and direct in
troduction to one of the greatest
poets of our time.

l-or yearsEugenio Montale has
been recognized as Italy's
greatest living poet. His work
has been translated and discus
sed in virtually every European
language, and he has received
honorary degrees and prizes all
over the continent. Last year his
career reached its slow climax
when Montale received the
world's most prestigious and
lucrative literary honor, the
Nobel Prize.
His output is very small in
deed. I le has published only six
slender volumes of poetry in
over 50 years of writing. Mon
tale's enduring reputation is a
testament to the quality of those
tiny volumes. One can think of
few poets except T.S. Eliot
(whom Montale has translated)
who haveachieved international
reputations on such a small body
of work.
When Montale won the Nobel
Prize, Time displayed more than
its usual ignorance by calling
him an "obscure" poet "virtu
ally unknown" outside his na
tive land. Indeed, virtually every
liv ing poet is obscure even in his

native land. One wonders how
many living European poets the
book editor of Time could name.
Good luck
Lor being "virtually un
known" Montale has had good
luck in English. His translators
have included Robert Lowell.
Mario Prax and James Merrill.
His critical champions have
numbered the indefatigable L.R.
Leavis and Stephen Spender.
Several magazines have devoted
issues to his work, and several
volumes of his poetry have been
translated.
The publication of Montale's
New Poems in English has filled
the one remaining gap. While
much of Montale's recent work
has been translated into English,
it has never been collected be-

Montale has always felt
alienated from life

fore in book form. This new vol
ume! should prove what a loss
that has been. These new transla
tions by (!. Singh (who has also
written an excellent critical
study ol Montale) are excellent
enough that most of the poems'
original strength comes through.
Montale's New Poems is a
stunning volume that makes
most books of contemporary
poetry look trivial in compari
son. These late poems are more
direct and personal than any

thing Montale wrote before. In
their simple, unaggressive way
they show why many people
consider Montale Europe's
greatest living poet.
Personal reflections
When Montale wrote these
poems, he was over 70 years old.
They are deeply personal reflec
tions on his life. He speaks
mostly of loss, specifically the
death of his wife. Mosca:
Your astounding face lingers
still,
carved against the morning's
chalky
background; but a life ivithout
iv ings
can't ivach it and its suffo
cated lire
is no more than the flash of a
lighter
Montale has always felt alien
ated from life. His early work
was suffused vyith a sense of sep
aration from the world. Hut in
these late poems this authentic
and profound feeling of isolation
achieves a more natural outlet.
But living beyond his wife and
friends. Montale's contempla
tive and social lives merged. His
vision and style found a pas
sionate emotional subject in his
unreachable separation from his
dead companions.
These are the poems of an old
man looking back on his life. Yet
they have as much energy as any
poems Montale ever wrote. In
many ways their eloquent
simplicity mhkes them more ef

fective and moving than his
early work. Like Yeats and
Stephens. Montale has broken
new ground in his old age and
produced many of his finest
poems.

These are the poems of
an old man. . .
