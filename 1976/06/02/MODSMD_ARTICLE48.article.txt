Why can't all history books be
as graphically enticing to the eye
and as well-organized and
tightly edited as Judith Papchris
tou's Women Together?
In 255 pages Papachristou
conscientiously summarizes the

woman's movement from its ori
gins in the temperance and abol
ition movements during the
1830s to its present concentra
tion on abortion and the Equal
Rights Amendment (ERA).
Papachristou has collected
numerous documents and
graphics revealing the historical
struggle of American women
and has prefaced them with
analytical introductions.

What is particularly enjoyable
about Women Together is that
Papachristou has defined a liter
ary goal and has not contused
the reader by trying to sidestep
that goal. She clearly aims at giv
ing the reader a complete over
view of the woman's movement.
She does not champion any of
her special heroines or causes by
giving any movement leaders or
issues noticeably more coverage.
Detailed analyses
If you are looking for a de
tailed analysis of the modern day
movement or of the origins ol the
woman's struggle, don't buy the
book. But if you are interested in
seeing the movement put in
perspective with little personal
bias, Women Together certainly
offers what you are searching
for.
Papchristou ties the numerous
documents together with
humorous and dramatic
graphics. She also uses many
headlines within the chapters to
organize the documents and to
separate them from the introduc
tions.
While the headlines and the
clean typeface of the print make
the articles easy to read, the

overall design is somewhat con
tusing. Using the same headline
typeface throughout the book
and altering it by using different
sizes of the same typeface would
rectify the problem.
But the good choice of articles
included in the book outweighs
the graphic problem.
Resolutions and statements
In the first few chapters Pap
christou includes many of the
resolutions and statements
women wrote for the abolition
and temperance movements.
She also gives documents show
ing the opposition most men
outside the movements felt
about women actively cam
paigning on political issues.
Once women spread their
energies to fight for themselves
as well as other oppressed
peoples,editorials in opposition
were written in newspap
ers, which one would expect to
be a forum for progressive ideas.
One such newspaper, the New
York Herald, wrote in 1853:
"We saw a gathering of un
sexed women — unsexed in
mind all of them, and many in
habiliments — publicly prop
ounding the doctrine that they

should be allowed to step out of
their appropriate sphere, and
mingle in the busy walks of
every-day life, to the neglect of
those duties which both human
and divine law have assigned to
them. We do not stop to argue
against so ridiculous a set of
ideas."
In ot her chapters Papachristou
outlines the division within the
woman's movement over the
13th through 15th Amendments
which essentially gave due pro

cess and suffrage for black males
more importance than the same
rights for women.
Many of the men involved in
the progressive abolitionist and
temperance movements ob
jected to the women's demand
for equal recognition with the
blacks.
The final portion of the book
concerns the development of the
modern woman's movement.
She includes documents urging
legalization of distribution birth

control propoganda and attacks
by opponents accusing the birth
control proponents of instigat
ing a Bolshevistik destruction of
the American family.
First discussing the original
push for the ERA in the 19205,
Papachristou then finishes off
her book with a discussion of the
ERA debate in the 19705. She
discusses the liberation move
ment as an outgrowth of the rad
ical movements of the 19605.
