If you haven't yet read a Michael Crichton novel (Andromeda
Strain, Terminal Man, Five Patients and The Great Train Rob
bery), now is the time to start. Crichton's latest. Eaters of the Dead,
is a masterful example of his style which mixes truth and fiction
with perfect impact.
Crichton, a non-practicing doctor out of Harvard Medical
School, bases his plot around the supposed discovery and compila
tion of documents relating the tales of a 10th-century Baghdad
traveler. Ibn Fadlan.
The Arab Fadlan is taken captive by a band of Northmen (Scan
dinavians) while on a mission to the King of the Bulgars. The
Northmen force Fadlan to help them battle the dread "eaters of the
dead" who have been ravaging the Scandinavian population. His
eventual return to Baghdad and official account of his adventures
form the basis for the novel.
The beauty of the entire idea, however, is that, despite the foot
notes referring to historical material, the style, and the appendix
and introduction which lend a great deal of credibility to the story,
the whole plot is a product of Crichton's amazingly keen and vivid
imagination.
The book begins with an introduction explaining the history of
the "Fadlan documents." Then the body of the novel, the "docu
ments" themselves, is based on the various translations of the parts
that have been "discovered" to date. If the whole idea doesn't
sound too clever yet, keep reading.
The documents are kept in the style they were written by F'adlan,
but discrepancies in the various translations are copiously pointed
out in Crichton's footnotes through the text. The notes refer either
to an Arabic translation ostensibly recorded in 1047 or to a Latin
translation written between 1585 and 1595. or to a final text in
Medieval Latin, the origins of which Crichton says are disputed.
The appendix discusses the reliability of Fadlan's observations.
Was Fadlan an early time Tocqueville, or is his account unreliable,
argue the experts created in the author's appendix. Finally,
Crichton credits all the research materials that helped him prepare
Fadlan's text.
The whole concept is fascinating and is marvelously con
structed. The account is suspenseful and worthy of legend status,
as it purports to be. To miss out on this fun novel would be a
mistake.
