Providence, R.l. (AP) — California
Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. gained
startling party support in Rhode Is
land's presidential primary election
last night as the uncommitted line on
the ballot drew more votes than any
Democratic candidate.
It was another setback for Jimmy
Carter. But Carter won the Democratic
primary in South Dakota and added
votes to his runaway lead in total dele
gate strength.
Sen. Frank Church of Idaho
trounced Carter in the Montana prim
ary.

In Republican competition Presi
dent Ford swept Rhode Island, while
challenger Ronald Reagan beat him in
South Dakota and Montana.
But Rhode Island, where the turnout
was tiny, held the day's "surprise.
Brown campaigned for the uncommit
ted line because his name was not
listed on the presidential preference
ballot.
Carter gained 41 percent of the bal
lots in South Dakota with Rep. Morris
K. Udall of Arizona running second.
Church suggested that Udall should
consider withdrawing as a candidate

— after eight second place shovvi ngs in
primary elections.
Udall said he was disappointed but
would go on.
The three primaries awarded a re
laive handful of nominating votes —
but could send signals out to Califor
nia. Ohio and New Jersey, which hold
the big, final primaries next Tuesday.
The odds were that even after those
June 8 elections, neither party would
have a clear winner in the race for pres
idential nomination.
With the returns from Rhode Island
and South Dakota a nearing comple
tion, Carter was adding 16 delegates to
his column, aising the total to 806 of
the 1505 needed for Democratic nomi-
nation.
I'dall was second in delegate
strength, far back at 308.5.
In the Republican delegate competi
tion. Ford's count was 806. Reagan's
653 of the 1130 votes that will make up
a nominating majority.
Rhode Island
With the vote virtually complete:
Ford 9146 or 60 percent;
Reagan 4309 or 31 percent: and
The rest were uncommitted.
Ford led for all 19 Rhode Island Re
publican delegates.
In the Democratic race:
The uncommitted line on the ballot
drew 18,600 or 31 percent;
Carter 17.926 or 30 percent:
Church 16.544 or 28 percent;
The rest of the field was far behind.
That had the uncommitted bloc
ahead for nine delegates. Carter for se
ven, Church for six.
South Dakota
With H6 percent of the precincts
counted;
Reagan 31.726 or 50 percent;
Ford 27,991 or 45 percent.
That put each man ahead for half the
20 South Dakota delegate votes.
In the Democratic competition it
stood:
Carter 18.778 or 41 percent;
Udall 14,888 or 32 percent.
The uncommitted line was drawing
14 percent of the vote there.
The rest of the vote was scattered.
That translated to nine delegates for
Carter, seven for Udall, with one un
committed.
Montana
With 2 percent of thevotein: Reagan
445 or 53 percent;
Ford 340 or 41 percent;
The rest was uncommitted.
The 20 Republican delegates will be
selected later at a state convention.
On the Democratic side, it was;
Church 1668 or 55 percent;
Carter 616 or 20 percent;
The rest was scattered.
That translated into 10 delegates for
Church, four for Carter and three un
committed.
