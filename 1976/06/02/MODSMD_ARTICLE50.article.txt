Stanford Quad, 1976, Vol. HI,
$12.
Reviewed by Ron Beck
If the 1976 Stanford Quad
seems more like a decent high
school yearbook than a polished
university remembrance, take
solace in the fact that, according
to Quad business manager Norm
Halleen, the $12 price on the
book is "very reasonable."
"Most colleges sell theirbooks
forslsors2oor even as high as
$25."said Halleen. so Stanford
students should presumably feel
pleased.
However, this year's book, at
Itiast according to one student,
"shows no imagination and has

no theme."
From people I've spoken to,
the most common complaint is
with the group pictures. Com
ments ranged from "They're bor
ing" to "why don't they stick in
candids instead of those idiot
shots."
Group shots may enhance
sales, but they sure are boring to
look at.
Additionally, the writing is
spotty. Sentences such as "Ex
cellence is not just a word to
(Track) Coach I'ayton Jordan, it
is a philosophy and a goal to
strive for." sound awfully PRish,
and bring down the overall qual
ity of the writing.

Some of the Quad's finer
points include: outstanding
color photo sections — the can
dids are interesting enough in
black and white, and the color
clearly enhances them; the
photo print quality — no wash
outs that plagued last year's edi
tion. The photos, particularly in
the senior section, are of excel
lent quality; and the accuracy of
names and spelling — although

there are some poor errors —
makes it clear that this year's
staff spent more time checking
spellings. It shows.
Perhaps most of the com
plaints are superfluous because
of the nature of yearbooks, but it
seems that with a little more im
agination, this year's Quad
could have-been vastly im
proved. As it stands, it's still far
better than last year's.
