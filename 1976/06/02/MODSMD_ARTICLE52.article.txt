According to On Your Own: Air Siam's Student
Guide to Asia, "Bangkok offers the low-budget traveler
a kaleidoscope of events, celebrations, experiences,
views, almost all of them free â€” the lively weekend
market, kite fighting from February to April, Tai Chi
exercises performed en masse at dawn by Chinese men
in the park, the many varied Buddhist monasteries and,
in addition, such relatively inexpensive sights as snake
feeding and venom extraction, shows of Tai boxing and
trips to the floating market of Bangkok's rural canals."
On Your Own is not an unusual travel guide simply
because it includes activities like snake feeding or
sights such as floating markets. It is unusual because it
is the first guide to Asia written by American students
and because it takes an unusual approach to travel,
stressing the cultures of various countries and life out
side the major cities. It is written for the "low-budget,
adventurous, close to the people" traveler by students
who have worked and traveled in Asia for several
months.

A book cannot instruct someone how to be adventur
ous or close to the local people but On Your Own
suggests many ways to get off the tourist trail. It inter
prets Asian gestures of hospitality and describes places
like East Java which are often skipped by the hurried
traveler.
The guide assumes the most exciting aspect of travel
"revolves as much around the people we meet as the
scenic sights we see" and that Asian traditions, ideals,
values and attitudes are strikingly different than ours.
In its sections on Korea, Japan and the Philippines,
the guide contrasts the customs and appearance of the
major industrialized cities with the countryside where
age-old traditions still predominate.
Because of these traditions, On Your Own cautions
students not to offend people in their host countries. In
places like Malaysia and Singapore so called "hippies"
were banned until immigration laws were amended.
Travelers who flout local customs are disruptive and
make it hard for the visitors who follow them. In addi
tion, they miss the experience of contact with the local
people.
On Your Own introduces the Westerner to the variety

and intricacy ot Asian etiquette. Chinese hospitality
still thrives in Taiwan. "Travelers who intend to stay in
Taiwan for an extended period to work or study are
advised to arm themselves before arriving with a supply
ot small, simple gifts from a foreign country for doing
battle in the ever-raging war of hospitality on the is
land."
In some countries the left hand is considered unclean
and it is an insult to touch someone or hand them an
object with that hand. In other places feet are regarded
as dirty. Touching another person with your feet is a
serious insult.
Although the information provided is excellent, stu
dents should be aware that On Your Own does not
contain a section on India. The guide includes the same
basic information on food, lodging and transportation
as student guides to Europe.
When it discusses food, however, it is apt to include a
section on how to eat as well as what to eat. Eating is a
social activity as well as a physical function.
Because the emphasis is on culture. On Your Own is
an interesting introduction to a variety of Asian coun
tries as well as a useful travel guide. Fine drawings,
maps and photographs complement the text.
