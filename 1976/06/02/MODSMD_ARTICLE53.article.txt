Only recently has any consid
erable attention been given to
ward an understanding of the
unique plights and experiences
women of color have faced in
America. !• om discriminatory
immigration and marriage laws,
which kept them small in num
bers, to exploitation as good
cheap labor or as exotic oriental
sexpots, Asian American
women undergone a mul
titude of different problems of

identity and survival throughout
their existence in America.
Asian American Women at
tempts to deal with the problems
and issues concerning today's
Asian American women. It is the
first journal on the subject ever
published here, and only the
second published in the past five
years anywhere.
The journal is highlighted by
several interesting oral histories
and interviews of individual
Asian American women. Focus
ing on personal experiences, the
journal combines them into a
wide context that collectively
presents a varied picture of
where Asian American women

are now and how far they still
have to go:
"When I was on my way to
America 1 didn't know what
America would be like. I
thought, America must be like
heaven. I thought that there is no
dust, no grass, no trees, no more
working in America. I think that
everything will be beautiful — I
wouldn't have to wash clothes
any more; I wouldn't even have
to cook. It was too much imagi

nation."
Included in the journal is an
autobiography of Wendy
Yoshimura, fugitive companion
of Patty Hearst, in which she
tells about her early experiences
and the development of her
political and revolutionary
perspectives.
The journal, unfortunately
does not venture a statement of
conclusion, nor does it formu
late any positive means for social

or political change in the status
of Asian American women in
this country. It will, however,
succeed as a catalyst for further
thought and discussion of the
political and social issues con
cerning Asian American wo
men, and inevitably concerning
all minority women.
