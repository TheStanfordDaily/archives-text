If this isn't a vanity press book,
I'll eat my shorts. For those who
don't know what the vanity
press is, let me briefly explain.
For a sum of money anyone
can get a book published by this
type of publishing house. It's
pure capitalism — if you've got
the money, they've got the time
and typesetters.
So why do I think this tome is
the product of a vanity press?
Because it is so turgid in writing
style and pedantic enough to
make a professor of abnormal

psychology run gibbering to the
nearest closet.
In short, no regular publishing
firm would waste money paying
an advance to an author for this
type of book. If any author's fees
were paid, I would be shocked
and amazed.
Who would pay money for a
book about an "experiment" in
volving 23 liberal arts profes
sors, who were "indoctrinating"
their students, according to the
author's definition of the term.
The conclusion, naturally, is
that they all should be fired be
cause they were incompetent.
It takes the author 162 pages to
render this theorem (to use a

mathematical term) and the
reader's mind almost totally in
operative. Convoluted syntax
predominates. For example —
"Protecting people from pornog
raphy with censorship is a part
of the problem why pornog
raphy is attractive to some
people."
Thanks to the vanity presses,
there are still really bad books to
review.
