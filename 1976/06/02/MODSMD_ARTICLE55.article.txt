# 'Cosi' features a strong cast

Cosi fan tutte —so do they all.
Mozart meant that everyone has
[lis shortcomings, nobody's per
fect, we're all only human, etc.
This profound philosophy is
actually tile theme of a hilarious
opera, Cosi Fun Tutta. The plot is
absurd but is timely and true to
life — or maybe it's obvious that
one necessarily #oes with the
other.
The plot is this: two young
soldiers claim that their
sweethearts, who are sisters, are
faithful. The soldiers' cynical
bachelor friend claims other
wise. They concoct an elaborate
plan whence the soldiers feign
induction to some battle and
cause .1 tearful departure,
whereas the actual plan is dis
guise as Turks and woo the wo
men.
The soldiers switch girls, woo
and win them, and prepare for
marriage. Meanwhile, the sol
diers inconveniently "reap
pear." They reveal their iden
tities and confess to their slimy
shenanigans and marry thegirls.
Naturally the girls are forgiven
for their "infidelity," the sol
diers for their mistrust, and
everyone lives happily ever af
ter. True love knows no obsta
cles.
Farce
Underlying the humor of this
farce is a very difficult piece of
music both for vocalists and
musicians, and the joint Opera
Theater-Drama Department pro
duction was a pleasure.
John Miller as tln? bachelor
Don Alfonso was a standout.
With exaggerated gestures and
voice to match, his wit and
wily deceit was an approp
riate foil to the sisters' naughty
feminine coquettry.
(iwendolyn Lvtel and Carolyn
Caton (who alternate with Edith

Zitelli and Leslie Richards) as
the sisters Fiordiligi
and Dorabella sang and acted
superbly. They are semi
professionals and it shows; their
voices were strong and lustrous,
and precise intonation and dic
tion added bite to the subtle
comedy that could otherwise
have been easily lost.
The two soldiers. Cerald
Chappell and Karl Schmidt as
lerrando and Cuglielmo respec
tively. were a slight disappoint
ment. They lacked the vocal
power to be very dynamic,
charismatic leads but their voi
ces were finely in tune and both
are obviously accustomed to
singing difficult ensemble.
Prom ise
Elizabeth Dyrud is only a
freshman, but she shows tre
mendous promise. As the cham
bermaid Despina (she alternates
with Nancy Mayans) she not
only sang wel 1 but her acting and
facial expressions added a clever
and alluring slyness. She could
make that part work with her
eyes alone. Her voice was weak
sometimes when she soloed, but
picked up with the chorus. Once
she chose the slightly easier ver
sion of an aria, avoiding particu
larly high and difficult notes, but
no doubt with more experience
she'll sing anything with ease.
As important to opera as the
singers is the orchestral accom
paniment, and this one was ex
cellent. Entrances with the sin
gers weren't together occasion
ally, but only once was it uncom
fortably noticeable. Intonation
and dynamics were consistently
good. Bruce Lamott shone on the
harpsichord, adding clever em
bellishments to the recitatives.
The revolving sets deserve
brief mention, because they were
just that but suggested a look of
18th century aristocratic opu
lence.
