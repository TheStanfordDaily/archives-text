## At Great American Music Hall Bonnie Raitt wails fine country blues 
### David Hwang 
I didn't know they made 'em
that way in West wood. Here's a
native West Los Angelinp,
daughter of two stage stars from
Coldwater Canyon jiving and
jabbing, laughing and loving her
audience with down-home
warmth and spice.
This is the way you feel at 1:()()
a.m. dorm jams, or at your
piano-playing uncle's club de
but. You're not supposed to get
so much humanity from a
rapidly rising blues-pop-rock
star. As far as this Angelino is
concerned, Bonnie Raitt's audi
ence intimacy makes her one of
our warmest exports, just plain
folk with talent of all getup.
There's no pretention here, just
music and care, i don't know;
maybe it's 'cause she never went
to the beach in summer.
Raitt proved at the Great
American Music Hall on May 25
that her rapidly maturing voice
and guitar lose nothing in the
trip from studio to stage. If any

thing, Raitt's own impeccable
stage presence makes the music
sweeter and more sincere.
She is a personality; she loves
her audience, plays with and
teases it and makes it care for her
by treating everyone like bud
dies at a hometown get-down.
"She's having a ball!" a red
gowned queen next to me
laughed to her Marlboro man;
that delight can't help but rub off
on an audience.
Tears
Raitt's own energy lifted the
crowd. She began by warning,
"I'm gonna have a hard time
doin' those depressing numbers
tonight, 'cause I just don't feel
like it." As it turned out. the de
pressing numbers shed their
tears, but Bonnie was more con
cerned with being herself, put
ting the crowd at ease with her
outrageous sexual cracks and
easy showmanship.
Raitt is unwilling to be
"proper" if it means pretending.
And it works; she becomes a real

person by treating her audience
like real people.
Raitt sat tin a stool for much of
her hour and halt set, treating
material from Fred McDowall,
Ray Charles, Little Feat, Sippie
Wallace, and others besides her
self with equal dedication and
taste. She finally kicked away
her chair to rollick through
"Don't Wanna Be Your Sugar
Mama No More," featuring a rag
time tuba solo from bassist
Freebo (former West Penn State
tuba champion — whatever that
is).
She invited Rolling Stone
Senior Editor Ben Fong-Torres,
newlywed ("Can you stand.
Ben?"), to attack the marimbas
on a "salty" Latin shaker. "I Can
Understand Why a Woman
Needs an Outside Man," by
Calypso Rose.
Sippie Wallace
The show's most moving mo
ments, however, were during
Bonnie's eagerly-awaited duet
with Sippie Wallace. Sippie had

been one of the opening acts ear
lier that night; the 77-year old
classic blues singer had charmed
and amazed the audience with
her still-mighty voice and
piano-playing on numbers like
"Mighty Tight Woman."
Bonnie has called Sippie her
"mentor" and "sassy grand
mother;" she helped to encour
age Wallace's comeback despite
heart trouble and arthritis. To
gether, they sang two of Sippie's
compositions now associated
with Bonnie: "You Cot to Know
How" and "Women, Be Wise."
One of the main motivating
forces in Bonnie's career has
been her desire to help still
active blues performers; many
died before she had the chance,
and a victory like Sippie is par
ticularly satisfying. They were
joined on "Women, Be Wise" by
Wallace's 10-year old grand
daughter, and the blues unified
their years: "Women, be wise/
Keep your mouth shut/Don't ad
vertise your man."

While Raitt's guitar, largely
influenced by legendary blues
men like Mississippi Fred
McDowell and Muddy Waters,
has always been powerful and
deft, her voice has only more re
cently shown true maturity in
confidence and command.
She belted out the blues — her
musical blood — with amazing
strength and energy,and could
also invoke tenderness and
warm beauty on numbers like
Mose Alison's "Everybody's
Crying." Raitt keeps the frenzy
under tasteful control on her
up-tempo tunes, such as the
classic "Give It Up or Let Me Go"
and her 'most recent single.
"Good Enough For You." Raitt's
voice has become a true instru
ment, rich in variation and color.
As usual, she delivered tasty
perfection on electric and elec
tric bottleneck guitars, making
her one of the few well-known
female band leaders. Her shim
mering set demonstrated why ar
tists like Waters and Buddy Guy
regard her as a peer.
Warm
Bonnie put down her guitar to
dance away the last number,
Toussani's "What Do You Want
the Boy to Do?" When the band
crashed to a halt, the audience
hopped to its feet with love for
the redheaded energy, who
raised her fist and yelled. "Don't
forget to vote for Tom Hayden."
She encored with a warm,
homey version of "Sweet &
Shiny Eyes." The audience sang
along in communal warmth and
bad harmony, drunk, but also en
thralled with Raitt's own pre
sence and person.
The all-blues show was
opened by Roosevelt Sykes. a
major figure in the development
of blues piano. Sykes, born in
190(S, played mighty and
eloquent boogie-woogie with
strong vocals and an abundance
of energetic charm.


FINK JAZZ AT GREAT AMERICAN—Bonnie Raitt (left) turned in a energetic,
moving performance at the Great American Music; Hall last week. Her versatile act
was tremendously well-received by her equally diversified audience. On June
15-17, Cireat American will feature one of America's foremost jazz trumpeters,


Dizzy Gillespie, (right) Sharing the bill with Gillespie will be the honey-voiced
black jazz vocalist, Carmen Mcßae. Mcßae is widely known for her sensitive,
melodic jazz ballads, and her appearance should provide a rich contrast to Gilles
pie's lively trumpet.
