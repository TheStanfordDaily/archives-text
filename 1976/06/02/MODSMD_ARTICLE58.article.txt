# 'Chorus Line': stunning, brisk musical theatre
## 
### Joel Kohn 
Well, it's true. A Chorus Linn, the musical
everyone's raving about, is as good as they say it
is.
It exploded on Broadway, playing to enthusias
tic audiences and receiving rave reviews. The
show won nine Tony Awards including Best Mus
ical.
Now A Chorus Line has hit the West Coast. The
Civic Light Opera is presenting a seven-week run
at San Francisco's Curran Theater before the com
pany moves to Los Angeles for an open-ended
run. The Civic Light Opera cast includes 14 of the
19 principals from the Broadway cast, including
Tony Award winners Donna McKechnie and
Sammy Williams.
The plot is simple. An audition for the chorus
line in a musical. Seventeen people trying for
eight spots: four boys and four girls. In the course
of the audition, each tells his or her story in
speech, song and dance.
Faceless group
Michael Bennett, who conceived, choreog
raphed and directed A Chorus Line, was a chorus
line dancer himself. His aim in the show is to
show us. not a star, but that usually faceless group
who dance behind the star, whose names appear
in miniscular print in the program, and who go on
performing in obscurity out of sheer tove for the
musical theater.
The show is a revolutionary idea. It grew out ot
real auditions, in which dancers stood up and
talked about themselves. These statements were
culled and reshaped into a cohesive show. In the
process the cast was narrowed to seventeen
characters. Ironically, several of the dancers
whose lives are portrayed in the final version were
not selected to play themselves; other actors play
their lives.
It's a successful experiment. Marvin Hamlisch's
music is both hummable and exciting, the lyrics
by Edward Kleban sparkling and witty.
The fascinating character revelation is enough
to keep the plot moving, and the pace ot the audi
tion hardly slows from the first off-key notes of the
piano, through two-and-a-quarter hours (without
intermission), to the costume tinale. By the end.
the audience is as exhausted as the dancers.
Exhausted
And exhausted they must be. With the spotlight
focused solely on them, it's a dancer's field day
and they take advantage of it.
The routines, designed by Bennet and co
choreographer Bob Avian, are crisp and imagina
tive. The cast performs them with verve and as
surance, artfully convincing us in some numbers
that they have just confronted the steps and are
struggling to learn them.
Set design is effective, consisting only of a
black stage, one white line downstage, and a
backdrop of mirrors. The lighting accentuates the
stark setting.
Motley group
Against this forbidding tableau stands the mot
ley group, unintentionally colorful in their casual

audition costumes. Slowly, through their some
times painfully inarticulate confessions, they
begin to take shape for the audience as individu
als.
Mike (Don Correia) tells how he used to tag
along to his sister's dance class and soon learned
the steps better than she, in "I Can Do That."
Later, three of the female dancers, Sheila (Char
lene Ryan). Bebe (Nancy Lane) and Maggie (Kay
Cole), join to tell of their unhappy childhoods in
"At the Ballet." The common bond is each one's
fantasy wish to become a dancer.
Tragicomic stories
Soon, we come to know all seventeen as they
tell the tragicomic stories of their lives, and in
between, dance their hearts out for a part in the
show.
Cood as it is, this group approach to drama still
needs a focus. This is provided by the virtuoso
performances of Donna Mckechnie, "winner of the
Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical, and
Sammy Williams who won the award for Best
Featured Actor in a Musical.
"I'm putting myself on the line for you," says
Cassie (McKechnie), an aging actress trying, after
an abortive bid for stardom, to begin again where
she started: as a dancer in the chorus line. The
director doesn't believe she can step back into the
anonymity of the chorus and dance the way she
used to. In "The Music and the Mirror," a stun
ning dance scene, she proves him wrong.
Drag queen
Williams, as Paul, adds a new dimension to the
familiar sad-sack character. His confession to hav
ing been a teen-age drag queen on the seamier side
of the New York stage is a masterful performance,
a real heartstring puller.
While the concept is novel, in spirit, A Chorus
Line is a musical in the grand old tradition. It
literally sweeps the audience off its feet and for
the duration, forces us to inhabit the magical
world the actors have created onstage.
It's not a seamless illusion. Viewed with even
the slightest trace of cynicism, the dancers' world
may seem suffocatingly adolescent and narcissis
tic. The mirrored backdrop serves to reinforce the
refrain of "look at me" that runs through each
character's story.
Adolescence
A song by the whole company, "Hello Twelve,
Hello Thirteen, Hello Love," chronicles these
preoccupations with adolescence and with self. In
some ways, the characters, sweating it out on their
white line on the stark black stage seem never to
have outgrown those teen-age dreams.
It is more than their waiflike appearance and
physical agility which make them Peter Pan fi
gures. They, like the immortal elf, refuse to grow
up. That's why they're still in theater.
And it's why the real dancers portraying these
characters go on, night after night agonizing over
whether they'll get "this job." We, the audience,
can only be thankful that they do.
It makes for one hell of a show.
