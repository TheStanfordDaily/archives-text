# What's cookin at ASSU Special Events?
## Phillips sees lively summer 
### John Roos 
Fresh from a hugely success
ful Boz Scaggs concert which
sold out Frost Ampitheater,
Randy Phillips, head of ASSIJ
Special Events, looks forward to
an exciting summer of Stanford
concerts.
The Band, one of America's
most original rock groups, will
appear at Frost Ampitheater on
Saturday, June 26. Tickets for
this performance are already on
sale. David Crosby and Graham
Nash will play at Frost on Satur
day, August 7. In addition. War,
Richie Havens, Dan Fogelberg,
Emmy Lou Harris, and a host of
other popular perfomers will
play concerts at Stanford this
summer.
Phillips explained why
he has scheduled so many con
certs for the summer when many
Stanford students will be away.
"First, our best facility is the
outdoor Frost Amphitheater,
and we can only count on good
weather during the summer

time. Also, most bands tour only
in the summer months."
"We cordially invite the Stan
ford Community who will be in
this area during the summer to
attend these events," Phillips
said. "Discounts for Stanford
students will be available."
If any of the upcoming Stan
ford shows are as enjoyable as
the Boz Scaggs affair last week
then the season will be a glowing
success. Boz put on an elegant
and beautifully paced show that
displayed his unique brand of
smooth white soul to its best ad
vantage.
The sell-out crowd was treated
to warm sunshine and a very
satisfying afternoon of music as
Boz spun out a lengthy set that
drew from all of his albums. Ad
ding sparkle to the show were
the frequent glimpses of Boz's
beautiful mate, Carmella, as she
stood offstage. If this tight and
exciting performance is any
proof, Boz Scaggs should be a
national star soon.

ALWAYS A SWEETHEART — A long-time favorite in the Bay
Area, Boz Scaggs is rising to rapid fame due to his recent national
tour and the release of his fresh recording effort, Silk Degrees. A
sell-out concert at Stanford's Frost Amphitheatre demonstrated
his ample talents and made for some sunburned shoulders in the
crowd.
