J "We had our chance," said a
* dejected Dick Gould, men's ten
|j nis coach, after returning to
♦. California with a third place
{ finish in the 1976 NCAA Champ
* ionships at Corpus Christi, Tex.
' "There were several oppor
i tunities we didn't take advan
' tageof.and you can't do that and
- win."
Just when it seemed likeStan
\ ford was on the way to its third
' national championship in four
! years, everything fell apart for
• the Cards. All Stanford entries
* except one doubles team had ad
! vanced to the round-of-16 Fri
• day. to give the Cards an early
■ lead, hut by Saturday evening,
" everyone had been eliminated.
• Although Stanford did not
" compete in the tournament after
Saturday, the Cards were ir first
place until the next-to-last day of
competition Monday. They still
could have won it all with a lot of

help from Bruce Kleege and
Mike Nissley of Brigham Young
University (BYU).
Before the singles finals and a
semifinal doubles match Mon
day, Stanford. UCLA and USC
were all tied for the team lead
with 20 points. Trinity's Bill
Scanlon prevented UCLA from
taking sole possession of first
place by beating Peter Fleming
in four sets in a three-out-of-five
match to win the NCAA singles
title.
Possible tie
Now if Kleege and Nissley
could have beaten Bruce Man
son and Chris Lewis of USC in
the doubles semis and then
upset Fleming and Ferdi Taygan
in the finals yesterday, Stanford.
UCLA and USC would have
finished in a tie with 20 points
each.
But Manson and Lewis whip
ped Kleege and Nissley in three
straight sets, before falling to

Taygan-Fleming yesterday. 6-0.
6-2, 6-4. By winning doubles,
UCLA tied with USC for the
championship, with 21 points.
Gould wasn't banking on help
Irom BYU. "We knew we were
pretty much out of it when we
left." he said.
Going back to that fateful
round-of-16 Friday, eighth
seeded Joao Soares of Pepper
dine beat Stanford's Matt Mitch
ell, 6-7, 6-2, 6-4; fourth-seeded
Pat DuPre of Stanford defeated
l()th seeded Scott Wedderburn
of Oklahoma City 6-2, 6-1; Ferdi
Taygan, the seventh seed from
UCLA, eliminated Card captain
Mark Mitchell, .1-6, 6-3, 6-,' L and
I'ieming, seeded No. 1. topped
Stanford's Bill Maze, the ninth
seed, 6-1, 7-5.
Doubles results
In the round-of-16 doubles,
DuPre and Maze beat Joe Ellis
and David Dick of Georgia, 6-4,
3-6, 6-3.
In the quarterfinals Saturday,
Scanlon defeated DuPre, 5-7,
6-3, 6-4, and Maze and DuPre
were eliminated by Kleege and
Nissley, 7-6 (5-4 tiebreaker), 6-4.
Kleege and Nissley have
beaten DuPre and Maze two out
of the three times they've met
this year. "They're a good, estab
lished team," Gould said of the
BYU pair. "They've played to
gether more than we (DuPre and
Maze) have."
Gould, who normally smiles
as much as Jimmy Carter, spoke
in a low, melancholy tone. "I'm
disappointed because we really
did have a chance to win the
whole thing. Everybody is ex
tremely disappointed."
Fleming fatigued
One person who's not disap
pointed is Scanlon. His superb
play plus Fleming's fatigue pro
vided the difference in the finals.
The day before, Fleming played
nine sets of singles and doubles
including a three hour and 40
minute, five set semifinal match
against Manson.
Scanlon was near-perfect
against the 6-foot-5 Fleming,
who will turn pro shortly. The
Trinity sophomore repeatedly

passed his listless opponent at
the net with forehand and back
hand shots from the baseline.
Scanlon also out-aced Flem
ing, not a bad server himself.
Most of Scanlon's big serves
went in the corners down the
middle past a motionless Flem
ing.
Tennis Notes: By advancing to
the NCAA singles round-of-16.
DuPre. Maze, Matt and Mark
Mitchell earned 1976 Ail-
American honors. ... It was the
first time any of the four had
been named All-American. . . .
In Gould's 10 years of coaching,
there have only been eight other
All-Americans. No other school
placed as many players on this
year's All-American team. . . .
Brian Teacher of UCLA was
named All-American for the
fourth straight year. . . . Teacher
never won a NCAA singles or
doubles championship during
his college career.
The only other Trinity player
besides Scanlon to win the
NCAA singles title was Dick
Stockton in 1972.

were all tied for the team lead
with 20 points. Trinity's Bill
Scanlon prevented UCLA from
taking sole possession of first
place by beating Peter Fleming
in four sets in a three-out-of-five
match to win the NCAA singles
title.
Possible tie
Now if Kleege and Nissley
could have beaten Bruce Man
son and Chris Lewis of USC in
the doubles semis and then
upset Fleming and Ferdi Taygan
in the finals yesterday, Stanford.
UCLA and USC would have
finished in a tie with 20 points

straight sets, before falling to

Taygan-Fleming yesterday. 6-0.
6-2, 6-4. By winning doubles,
UCLA tied with USC for the
championship, with 21 points.

round-of-16 Friday, eighth

Pat DuPre of Stanford defeated

Doubles results
In the round-of-16 doubles,

Scanlon defeated DuPre, 5-7,

Gould, who normally smiles

in a low, melancholy tone. "I'm

Fleming fatigued
One person who's not disap
pointed is Scanlon. His superb
play plus Fleming's fatigue pro
vided the difference in the finals.
The day before, Fleming played
nine sets of singles and doubles
including a three hour and 40
minute, five set semifinal match
against Manson.
Scanlon was near-perfect
against the 6-foot-5 Fleming,
who will turn pro shortly. The
Trinity sophomore repeatedly

passed his listless opponent at
the net with forehand and back
hand shots from the baseline.
Scanlon also out-aced Flem
ing, not a bad server himself.

went in the corners down the
middle past a motionless Flem

J "We had our chance," said a
* dejected Dick Gould, men's ten
|j nis coach, after returning to
♦. California with a third place
{ finish in the 1976 NCAA Champ
* ionships at Corpus Christi, Tex.
' "There were several oppor
i tunities we didn't take advan
' tageof.and you can't do that and
- win."
Just when it seemed likeStan
\ ford was on the way to its third
' national championship in four
! years, everything fell apart for
• the Cards. All Stanford entries
* except one doubles team had ad
! vanced to the round-of-16 Fri
• day. to give the Cards an early
■ lead, hut by Saturday evening,
" everyone had been eliminated.
• Although Stanford did not
" compete in the tournament after
Saturday, the Cards were ir first
place until the next-to-last day of
competition Monday. They still
could have won it all with a lot of

help from Bruce Kleege and
Mike Nissley of Brigham Young
University (BYU).
Before the singles finals and a
semifinal doubles match Mon
day, Stanford. UCLA and USC
were all tied for the team lead
with 20 points. Trinity's Bill
Scanlon prevented UCLA from
taking sole possession of first
place by beating Peter Fleming
in four sets in a three-out-of-five
match to win the NCAA singles
title.
Possible tie
Now if Kleege and Nissley
could have beaten Bruce Man
son and Chris Lewis of USC in
the doubles semis and then
upset Fleming and Ferdi Taygan
in the finals yesterday, Stanford.
UCLA and USC would have
finished in a tie with 20 points
each.
But Manson and Lewis whip
ped Kleege and Nissley in three
straight sets, before falling to

Taygan-Fleming yesterday. 6-0.
6-2, 6-4. By winning doubles,
UCLA tied with USC for the
championship, with 21 points.
Gould wasn't banking on help
Irom BYU. "We knew we were
pretty much out of it when we
left." he said.
Going back to that fateful
round-of-16 Friday, eighth
seeded Joao Soares of Pepper
dine beat Stanford's Matt Mitch
ell, 6-7, 6-2, 6-4; fourth-seeded
Pat DuPre of Stanford defeated
l()th seeded Scott Wedderburn
of Oklahoma City 6-2, 6-1; Ferdi
Taygan, the seventh seed from
UCLA, eliminated Card captain
Mark Mitchell, .1-6, 6-3, 6-,' L and
I'ieming, seeded No. 1. topped
Stanford's Bill Maze, the ninth
seed, 6-1, 7-5.
Doubles results
In the round-of-16 doubles,
DuPre and Maze beat Joe Ellis
and David Dick of Georgia, 6-4,
3-6, 6-3.
In the quarterfinals Saturday,
Scanlon defeated DuPre, 5-7,
6-3, 6-4, and Maze and DuPre
were eliminated by Kleege and
Nissley, 7-6 (5-4 tiebreaker), 6-4.
Kleege and Nissley have
beaten DuPre and Maze two out
of the three times they've met
this year. "They're a good, estab
lished team," Gould said of the
BYU pair. "They've played to
gether more than we (DuPre and
Maze) have."
Gould, who normally smiles
as much as Jimmy Carter, spoke
in a low, melancholy tone. "I'm
disappointed because we really
did have a chance to win the
whole thing. Everybody is ex
tremely disappointed."
Fleming fatigued
One person who's not disap
pointed is Scanlon. His superb
play plus Fleming's fatigue pro
vided the difference in the finals.
The day before, Fleming played
nine sets of singles and doubles
including a three hour and 40
minute, five set semifinal match
against Manson.
Scanlon was near-perfect
against the 6-foot-5 Fleming,
who will turn pro shortly. The
Trinity sophomore repeatedly

passed his listless opponent at
the net with forehand and back
hand shots from the baseline.
Scanlon also out-aced Flem
ing, not a bad server himself.
Most of Scanlon's big serves
went in the corners down the
middle past a motionless Flem
ing.
