A wiMik after everyone has
finished finals, a group of Stan
ford students will face what may
he its biggest 'est thi; year. The
women's goll team, undefeated
Northern California Intercol
legiate Athletic Conference
champions, vvill he competing
in the AIAVV Nationals begin
ning June 14 at Michigan State.
"Our goal is to he in the top
10," said coach Carroll Diaz.
Pat Cornett, the (lards' No. 1
golfer, says."I think it vvil I be the
best competition in a long time."
Key to success
Team scoring vvill he deter
mined by combining the best
lour individual scores from each
school. Stanford's key to success
"is it Sally Voss and Kllen Sale
can stay in the low 80s," stated
Diaz. "They're capable of it."
Cornell said she thinks Voss
and Sale will do the job, noting,
"Kllen has been hitting the hall
really well recently."
I'am I'almieri. Stanford's sec
ond goiter, said she sees her own
performance as being pivotal for
team success. "I have to play to
my potential." she says.
In addition to the hopes for a
good team finish.Cornet! maybe
in the running for the individual
title. "I think I'at has a real good
chance at it." Diaz stated.
Beat Lopez
"I've been looking forward to
it all year, and now the time's
come," Cornett said. She says
she thinks Nancy Lopez of Tulsa
and Hetli Daniel of Furman. last
year's U.S. Amateur Champion,
will be the persons to beat.
Cornett has been working on
improving her game for the
tournament. "I've made a real
r big swing change; in the last few
' weeks." she said. "It should help
* me hit the ball straighter more
| consistently."
"It's one of the best colleue

courses in the United States,"
Diaz commented. "The Arizona
teams will have a harder time ad
justing to it than us."
Grassy course
Palmieri said that tin; grassy
course should even things out
among the golfers. "The big
thing," she stated, "is that the
desert players gear their game
for hard courses — low shots
with topspin."
According to Palmieri. the
course should negate the 25-
yard advantage desert golfers
sometimes enjoy on their own
courses.
The four-day format will be a
plus, Diaz said. "I think it wil I be
an advantage because each tour
nament we go to we improve
each day." Palmieri added
"there'll be less pressure as long
as you don't blow your first
round." •
