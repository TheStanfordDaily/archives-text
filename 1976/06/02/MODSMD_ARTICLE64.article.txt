# Peck to lead men at golf NCAAs
## 
### Chris Kamel 
If things had worked out a lit
tle differently, men's golfer Mike
Peck might be preparing to lead,
say, Arizona State instead of
Stanford to the NCAA golf
championships in Albuquerque
N.M., June 9.
The sophomore from Prairie
Village. Kan. had numerous
scholarship offers from top golf
powers around the country.
"I actually narrowed it down
to three, including Texas,
Arizona State and Stanford," he
said, but chose Stanford for
academics.
After making his decision,
however. Peck said he didn't
think he would make the varsity
squad his first time out.
"The team had four returning
lettermen along with other more
experienced players," he said.

One of the key differences from
high school was that tourna
ments now consisted of three
rounds, rather than one.
Smooth transition
According to Stanford coach
Mud Finger, however. Peck made
the transition from high school
to college play very smoothly,
and worked for his position.
"He adjusted very well to col
lege play." said Finger, "but
then he had more ability than a
lot of people."
Peck's freshman year turned
out to be the critical point in his
career. The two-time Missouri
Junior Golf Tournament champ
ion started on the Card varsity
squad that was to finish 17th in
the nation.
"Starting on the team as a
freshman gave me a lot of confi
dence and experience that I
couldn't have gained anywhere
else," he said. "It has actually
put me where I am right now."
Shawnee Mission
And where is the graduate of
Shawnee Mission East High
School right now? Peck is con
cerned with improving on his
IHth place finish and Ail-
American honorable mention
title last year.
With a finish in the top three
in the nation, Peck can conceiv
ably be named a first team All-
American.
Peck said the team he will be
making the trip with this year is
a much different team than a
year ago.
"Last year the team was very
well set," he said, "but this year
changes have been occurring so
fast. It helps, but I also think it
puts more pressure on the guys
because they think about beating
members on their own team."
Three in playoff
Even now. right before
NCAAs, intrateam competition
hasn't stopped. Three Cards are
in the middle of a playoff to de
termine who will make the trip
to Albuquerque.
Stanford's five man team will
include Peck and teammates
Clenn Goethals and Jay
Johnston. Competing for the
final two berths are Wade Non
nenberg. Bruce McDonald and
Kim Cater.
After four rounds of the six
round playoff between the three.
Nonnenberg and McDonald are
ahead of Cater.
Coming from the same Kansas
area that gave Stanford ex-Card

and present pro golfer Tom Wat
son. has Peck been put under any
pressure to live up to Watson's
accomplishments?
Longest hitter
"Actually, I think most of that
has been played up by the press
after my victory in the Stanford
Invitational this year." reflected
Peck. The native of Kansas,
whom Finger calls one of the
longest hitters in the game, won
the invitational and broke Wat
son's 1971 mark of 212.
According to Peck, with all
this success many people have

wondered if he would prefer
playing a lower varsity position
on <i higher ranked team instead
of being No. 1 for the Cards.
"It doesn't really matter if you
are first or last on a varsity
team," said Peck. "I regret no
thing. In fact, the team itself is
unique from other teams I have
come in contact with."
According to Peck, teammates
Coethals and Johnston work
along with him to improve each
other's game and have ac
counted for much of Peck's suc
cess this season.

Mike Peck
If things had worked out a lit
tle differently, men's golfer Mike
Peck might be preparing to lead,
say, Arizona State instead of
Stanford to the NCAA golf
championships in Albuquerque
N.M., June 9.
The sophomore from Prairie
Village. Kan. had numerous
scholarship offers from top golf
powers around the country.
"I actually narrowed it down
to three, including Texas,
Arizona State and Stanford," he
said, but chose Stanford for
academics.
After making his decision,
however. Peck said he didn't
think he would make the varsity
squad his first time out.
"The team had four returning
lettermen along with other more
experienced players," he said.

One of the key differences from
high school was that tourna
ments now consisted of three
rounds, rather than one.
Smooth transition
According to Stanford coach
Mud Finger, however. Peck made
the transition from high school
to college play very smoothly,
and worked for his position.
"He adjusted very well to col
lege play." said Finger, "but
then he had more ability than a
lot of people."
Peck's freshman year turned
out to be the critical point in his
career. The two-time Missouri
Junior Golf Tournament champ
ion started on the Card varsity
squad that was to finish 17th in
the nation.
"Starting on the team as a
freshman gave me a lot of confi
dence and experience that I
couldn't have gained anywhere
else," he said. "It has actually
put me where I am right now."
Shawnee Mission
And where is the graduate of
Shawnee Mission East High
School right now? Peck is con
cerned with improving on his
IHth place finish and Ail-
American honorable mention
title last year.
With a finish in the top three
in the nation, Peck can conceiv
ably be named a first team All-
American.
Peck said the team he will be
making the trip with this year is
a much different team than a
year ago.
"Last year the team was very
well set," he said, "but this year
changes have been occurring so
fast. It helps, but I also think it
puts more pressure on the guys
because they think about beating
members on their own team."
Three in playoff
Even now. right before
NCAAs, intrateam competition
hasn't stopped. Three Cards are
in the middle of a playoff to de
termine who will make the trip
to Albuquerque.
Stanford's five man team will
include Peck and teammates
Clenn Goethals and Jay
Johnston. Competing for the
final two berths are Wade Non
nenberg. Bruce McDonald and
Kim Cater.
After four rounds of the six
round playoff between the three.
Nonnenberg and McDonald are
ahead of Cater.
Coming from the same Kansas
area that gave Stanford ex-Card

and present pro golfer Tom Wat
son. has Peck been put under any
pressure to live up to Watson's
accomplishments?
Longest hitter
"Actually, I think most of that
has been played up by the press
after my victory in the Stanford
Invitational this year." reflected
Peck. The native of Kansas,
whom Finger calls one of the
longest hitters in the game, won
the invitational and broke Wat
son's 1971 mark of 212.
According to Peck, with all
this success many people have

wondered if he would prefer
playing a lower varsity position
on <i higher ranked team instead
of being No. 1 for the Cards.
"It doesn't really matter if you
are first or last on a varsity
team," said Peck. "I regret no
thing. In fact, the team itself is
unique from other teams I have
come in contact with."
According to Peck, teammates
Coethals and Johnston work
along with him to improve each
other's game and have ac
counted for much of Peck's suc
