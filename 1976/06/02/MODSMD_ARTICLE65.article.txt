# Morrison to play singles
## Hill selects net nationals team 
### Jill Lieber 
Freshman Diane Morrison's
tennis career is on the rise.
Last month Morrison, No. 5 on
the women's tennis ladder, beat
teammate and No. 1 player Lele
Forood at the Seventeen
Magazine Championships.
Their coach, Anne Hill, said
later it re-enforced her belief that
Morrison should be given a
chance at a singles spot for the
U.S. Women's Collegiate Na
tionals, June 14-19 in Salt Lake
City.
And last week Morrison did
become one of four Card netters
to represent Stanford in singles
at nationals.
While Forood was already
guaranteed a berth, Morrison
competed in a round robin chal
lenge matches against team

mates Susie Hagey, Barb Jordan
and Marcy O'Keefe tor the three
remaining spots.
)ordan ousted
Morrison finished third in the
challenges, beating only Jordan,
who finished last. In an addi
tional match, Morrison beat Jor
dan again. 6-3, 2-6, 6-0, thus
eliminating Jordan from singles
consideration. Jordan has been
the regular No. 2 singles player
for the netters this season.
Morrison has come on strong
the past few weeks, showing
tennis fans the competent play
that helped her win the Ameri
can Tennis Association National
Singles Championship last
summer.
Hill was hesitant in selecting
the four women singles players.
"I'm pleased that the girls

have been playing so well," she
said. "I'm confident in them. It's
sad that all five are so good —
they all deserve to play. Unfor
tunately they all can't."
Mill said that Stanford should
be rated near the top at nationals.
The Cards' biggest threat will be;
Trinity (Tex.). "Stephanie Tolle
son (Trinity's No. 1 player) will
be seeded No. 1 and Lele will be
seeded fairly high." Hill said.
Forood lost toTolleson, 7-5, 6-0
when Trinity visited here in Ap
ril.
'On the ropes'
When asked who she thinks
her biggest competition will be,
Forood said, "Everybody. I'll be
on the ropes first round. I'm in a
major slump. I don't have any
confidence. I'm going to take a
couple of days off. I've got a stale
attitude right now."
Forood, who hasn't had a
major win since the Ojai Inter
collegiate singles crown two
months ago, was defeated last
Saturday by UCLA's Paula
Smith, 6-0, 6-4, in a match
against the Bruins.
Forood was the only Card to
lose as Stanford beat UCLA 6-1,
to finish its season with an unde
feated dual match record of 9-0.
In other matches, Hagey beat
Cindy Thomas, 6-2, 6-2. Morri
son (lowed Kim Nilsson,6-4, 7-5.
Jordan blasted Jenny Ceddes,
6-0. 6-0, and Liza I'ande won
over Cay lee Poliakoff, 6-.1, 6-1.
Doubles wins
In doubles, Forood-Jordan
beat Smith-Thomas 6-1, 6-2,and

Hagey-Morrison defeated
Nilsson-Ceddes 6-1, 7-5.
The doubles team of Forood
and Jordan has beaten tin; na
tion's top doubles teams —
UCLA, IJSC and Trinity. There
fore Mil I said that the duo should
be top seeded.
Forood said she thinks they
have a good chance at nationals,
too. "If Barb and I play pretty
well we should win. It's a matter
of playing pretty good matches.
It should just go along. If we're
playing badly, it will take a lot of
t hi nki ng."
Hill also will enter the doubles
team of Morrison and Hagey.
The coach said that the pair
could "surprise everybody" at
the nationals.
The team will have toadjust to
the high altitude of Salt Lake
City. Since the air is thinner, the
balls travel farther. "It's difficult
playing in altitudes," said
Forood, who won two Pan-
American gold medals in high
elevation Mexico City last fall.
"The ball floats more and car
ries a lot farther," she added.
"You'vegot to stroke the ball dif
ferently. Your serving isn't as
consistent and lobbing is trick
ier."
Hill said the team will go to
nationals three days early to get
used to the altitude. She said
players will find they tire
quicker in the altitude but that
they are <ill in good physical
condition and will be ready by
opening rounds.
