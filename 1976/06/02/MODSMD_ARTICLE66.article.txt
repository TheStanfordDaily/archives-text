# Plowing the Farm
## Men netters deserve third 
### Paul Bauman 
I was daydreaming in my U.S. history
class Friday afternoon, which is par lor tho
course, thinking about the NCAA Tennis
Championships in Corpus Christi, Tex.
It was ironic. The professor was talking
about the United States' involvement in
Vietnam and I was concerned about a ten
nis tournament. He was discussing the
Gulf of Tonkin and my mind was closer to
the Gulf of Mexico.
I was just counting the minutes until I
could go over to the Athletic Department
and find out what happened in the crucial
round-of-llifrom Asst. Sports Information
Director Nancy Peterson.
Naturally, the professor kept us in class
an extra 13 minutes (and 30 seconds). We
were finally released and then I got the bad
news. Three of Stanford's four players lost
in the round-of-16 singles. Only Pat DuPre
made it to the quarterfinals.
News got worse
The news was worse the next day.
DuPre, seeded fourth, lost in the quarters
to Bill Scanlon of Trinity, the sixth seed
and eventual NCAA singles champ, and
the Cards' only remaining doubles team.
DuPre and Bill Maze, was upset. USC had
pulled even with Stanford at 20 poi nts, but
the Cards were out of the tournament and
virtually out of contention.
At first, it seemed disappointing that the
Cards faltered when they had a good
chance to win the tournament. On second
thought, however, they got about as far as
they should have. Stanford simply was not
good enough to be NCAA champion this
year.
To win the title, the Cards would have
had to win all the matches they were sup
posed to plus a few they weren't.
Stanford lost the championship in dou
bles, a weak area for the Cards all year.
Moth Stanford teams in the NCAAs lost

matches they shouldn't have.
Perry Wright and Matt Mitchell, seeded
seventh, lost in the first round to Scott
Wedderburn and Dennis Morgan of Ok
lahoma City. Turning (joint No. 1.
Kleege's and Nissley's upset of DuPre
and Ma/.e was turning point No. 2.
Matt Mitchell did his part in singles by
upsetting Ilth-seeded John Lucas of
Maryland, hut could have put Stanford in
great shape by beating eighth-seeded Joao
Soares of Pepperdine in the round of 1 f>.
Stanford probably needed two wins
from its four players in that round, but
Maze drew top-seeded Peter Fleming of
11(11,A and Mark Mitchell's opponent was
UCLA Ail-American Ferdi Taygan.
In addition to DuPre, who was playing
the l()th-seeded Wedderburn, it appeared
that Matt was the Cards' host hope. It
would have been asking too much to ex
pect Matt, a freshman, to beat Soares,
which he didn't, but Stanford needed it
just the same. Turning point No. ,'L
Doing his part
Mark Mitchell also did his part in his
first NCAA singles competition. The un
seeded Card captain knocked off Ifith
seeded Joe Meyers of San Jose State before
losing to Taygan in the round-of-Ifi.
Maze, the ninth seed, got as far as could
have been expected. He was the victim of
an unlucky draw and lost to Fleming.
It looked like DuPre had a fairly easy
road to the finals with "only" Soares,
Scanlon and unseeded Tim Carcia of New
Mexico in the quarters in his half of the
draw.
The other half of the draw included
Fleming, third-seeded Uruce Manson of
lISC and the seventh-seeded Taygan. Had
Stanford scored a few more doubles
points. DuPre's loss to Scanlon wouldn't

have been so critical. Still, this was turn
ing point No. 4.
Considering all the setbacks Stanford
has suffered in the past year, its third
place N(!AA finish is quite an achieve
ment.
Remarkable resiliency
The (lards showed remarkable resi
liency after losing t heir top four players off
last year's team — Jim Delaney, John Whit
linger. Nick Saviano and dene Mayer. De
laney graduated, Whitlinger and Saviano
turned pro early and Mayer — well, that's
a story in itself. Me hardly played at all this
season and there are two reasons why.
The first, and Mayer's favorite, is that he
suffered a pulled back muscle and caught
a virus. It's hard to believe that a three
month-long season doesn't provide
enough time to overcome those problems
and to play some competitive tennis.
The second, and more unfortunate
reason is that Mayer is concerned about
himself arid not the team. If his body
bruises easily, that's nothing compared to
his pride. Hard as it is for me to believe,
Mayer actually refused to play below sec
ond or third singles against HOILA at
Maples Pavilion in April. Although heal
thy enough to play, he stayed out of sing
les and Stanford lost. 5-4.
Ironically, Mayer said he eventually
wants to play World Team Tennis. If he
joins his brother Sandy on the New York
Sets, coach I'red Stolle should get the
(loach of the Year award just for coexisting
with them both.
Mayer, the third-ranked amateur in the
U.S., said he will play for Stanford next
year, and I hope he really means it. With a
healthy, content Mayer, the'dards might
be the favorites to win the 11177 NdA A
Championships.

Ironically, Mayer said he eventually

Sets, coach I'red Stolle should get the
(loach of the Year award just for coexisting
with them both.
Mayer, the third-ranked amateur in the
U.S., said he will play for Stanford next

Championships.

I was daydreaming in my U.S. history
class Friday afternoon, which is par lor tho
course, thinking about the NCAA Tennis
Championships in Corpus Christi, Tex.
It was ironic. The professor was talking
about the United States' involvement in
Vietnam and I was concerned about a ten
nis tournament. He was discussing the
Gulf of Tonkin and my mind was closer to
the Gulf of Mexico.
I was just counting the minutes until I
could go over to the Athletic Department
and find out what happened in the crucial
round-of-llifrom Asst. Sports Information
Director Nancy Peterson.
Naturally, the professor kept us in class
an extra 13 minutes (and 30 seconds). We
were finally released and then I got the bad
news. Three of Stanford's four players lost
in the round-of-16 singles. Only Pat DuPre
made it to the quarterfinals.
News got worse
The news was worse the next day.
DuPre, seeded fourth, lost in the quarters
to Bill Scanlon of Trinity, the sixth seed
and eventual NCAA singles champ, and
the Cards' only remaining doubles team.
DuPre and Bill Maze, was upset. USC had
pulled even with Stanford at 20 poi nts, but
the Cards were out of the tournament and
virtually out of contention.
At first, it seemed disappointing that the
Cards faltered when they had a good
chance to win the tournament. On second
thought, however, they got about as far as
they should have. Stanford simply was not
good enough to be NCAA champion this
year.
To win the title, the Cards would have
had to win all the matches they were sup
posed to plus a few they weren't.
Stanford lost the championship in dou
bles, a weak area for the Cards all year.
Moth Stanford teams in the NCAAs lost

matches they shouldn't have.
Perry Wright and Matt Mitchell, seeded
seventh, lost in the first round to Scott
Wedderburn and Dennis Morgan of Ok
lahoma City. Turning (joint No. 1.
Kleege's and Nissley's upset of DuPre
and Ma/.e was turning point No. 2.
Matt Mitchell did his part in singles by
upsetting Ilth-seeded John Lucas of
Maryland, hut could have put Stanford in
great shape by beating eighth-seeded Joao
Soares of Pepperdine in the round of 1 f>.
Stanford probably needed two wins
from its four players in that round, but
Maze drew top-seeded Peter Fleming of
11(11,A and Mark Mitchell's opponent was
UCLA Ail-American Ferdi Taygan.
In addition to DuPre, who was playing
the l()th-seeded Wedderburn, it appeared
that Matt was the Cards' host hope. It
would have been asking too much to ex
pect Matt, a freshman, to beat Soares,
which he didn't, but Stanford needed it
just the same. Turning point No. ,'L
Doing his part
Mark Mitchell also did his part in his
first NCAA singles competition. The un
seeded Card captain knocked off Ifith
seeded Joe Meyers of San Jose State before
losing to Taygan in the round-of-Ifi.
Maze, the ninth seed, got as far as could
have been expected. He was the victim of
an unlucky draw and lost to Fleming.
It looked like DuPre had a fairly easy
road to the finals with "only" Soares,
Scanlon and unseeded Tim Carcia of New
Mexico in the quarters in his half of the
draw.
The other half of the draw included
Fleming, third-seeded Uruce Manson of
lISC and the seventh-seeded Taygan. Had
Stanford scored a few more doubles
points. DuPre's loss to Scanlon wouldn't

have been so critical. Still, this was turn
ing point No. 4.
Considering all the setbacks Stanford
has suffered in the past year, its third
place N(!AA finish is quite an achieve
ment.
Remarkable resiliency
The (lards showed remarkable resi
liency after losing t heir top four players off
last year's team — Jim Delaney, John Whit
linger. Nick Saviano and dene Mayer. De
laney graduated, Whitlinger and Saviano
turned pro early and Mayer — well, that's
a story in itself. Me hardly played at all this
season and there are two reasons why.
The first, and Mayer's favorite, is that he
suffered a pulled back muscle and caught
a virus. It's hard to believe that a three
month-long season doesn't provide
enough time to overcome those problems
and to play some competitive tennis.
The second, and more unfortunate
reason is that Mayer is concerned about
himself arid not the team. If his body
bruises easily, that's nothing compared to
his pride. Hard as it is for me to believe,
Mayer actually refused to play below sec
ond or third singles against HOILA at
Maples Pavilion in April. Although heal
thy enough to play, he stayed out of sing

month-long season doesn't provide
enough time to overcome those problems
and to play some competitive tennis.
The second, and more unfortunate
reason is that Mayer is concerned about
himself arid not the team. If his body
bruises easily, that's nothing compared to
his pride. Hard as it is for me to believe,
Mayer actually refused to play below sec
ond or third singles against HOILA at
Maples Pavilion in April. Although heal
thy enough to play, he stayed out of sing
les and Stanford lost. 5-4.
Ironically, Mayer said he eventually
wants to play World Team Tennis. If he
joins his brother Sandy on the New York
Sets, coach I'red Stolle should get the
(loach of the Year award just for coexisting
with them both.
Mayer, the third-ranked amateur in the
U.S., said he will play for Stanford next
year, and I hope he really means it. With a
healthy, content Mayer, the'dards might
be the favorites to win the 11177 NdA A
Championships.

I was daydreaming in my U.S. history
class Friday afternoon, which is par lor tho
course, thinking about the NCAA Tennis
Championships in Corpus Christi, Tex.
It was ironic. The professor was talking
about the United States' involvement in
Vietnam and I was concerned about a ten
nis tournament. He was discussing the
Gulf of Tonkin and my mind was closer to
the Gulf of Mexico.
I was just counting the minutes until I
could go over to the Athletic Department
and find out what happened in the crucial
round-of-llifrom Asst. Sports Information
Director Nancy Peterson.
Naturally, the professor kept us in class
an extra 13 minutes (and 30 seconds). We
were finally released and then I got the bad
news. Three of Stanford's four players lost
in the round-of-16 singles. Only Pat DuPre
made it to the quarterfinals.
News got worse
The news was worse the next day.
DuPre, seeded fourth, lost in the quarters
to Bill Scanlon of Trinity, the sixth seed
and eventual NCAA singles champ, and
the Cards' only remaining doubles team.
DuPre and Bill Maze, was upset. USC had
pulled even with Stanford at 20 poi nts, but
the Cards were out of the tournament and
virtually out of contention.
At first, it seemed disappointing that the
Cards faltered when they had a good
chance to win the tournament. On second
thought, however, they got about as far as
they should have. Stanford simply was not
good enough to be NCAA champion this
year.
To win the title, the Cards would have
had to win all the matches they were sup
posed to plus a few they weren't.
Stanford lost the championship in dou
bles, a weak area for the Cards all year.
Moth Stanford teams in the NCAAs lost

matches they shouldn't have.
Perry Wright and Matt Mitchell, seeded
seventh, lost in the first round to Scott
Wedderburn and Dennis Morgan of Ok
lahoma City. Turning (joint No. 1.
Kleege's and Nissley's upset of DuPre
and Ma/.e was turning point No. 2.
Matt Mitchell did his part in singles by
upsetting Ilth-seeded John Lucas of
Maryland, hut could have put Stanford in
great shape by beating eighth-seeded Joao
Soares of Pepperdine in the round of 1 f>.
Stanford probably needed two wins
from its four players in that round, but
Maze drew top-seeded Peter Fleming of
11(11,A and Mark Mitchell's opponent was
UCLA Ail-American Ferdi Taygan.
In addition to DuPre, who was playing
the l()th-seeded Wedderburn, it appeared
that Matt was the Cards' host hope. It
would have been asking too much to ex
pect Matt, a freshman, to beat Soares,
which he didn't, but Stanford needed it
just the same. Turning point No. ,'L
Doing his part
Mark Mitchell also did his part in his
first NCAA singles competition. The un
seeded Card captain knocked off Ifith
seeded Joe Meyers of San Jose State before
losing to Taygan in the round-of-Ifi.
Maze, the ninth seed, got as far as could
have been expected. He was the victim of
an unlucky draw and lost to Fleming.
It looked like DuPre had a fairly easy
road to the finals with "only" Soares,
Scanlon and unseeded Tim Carcia of New
Mexico in the quarters in his half of the
draw.
The other half of the draw included
Fleming, third-seeded Uruce Manson of
lISC and the seventh-seeded Taygan. Had
Stanford scored a few more doubles
points. DuPre's loss to Scanlon wouldn't

have been so critical. Still, this was turn
ing point No. 4.
Considering all the setbacks Stanford
has suffered in the past year, its third
place N(!AA finish is quite an achieve
ment.
Remarkable resiliency
The (lards showed remarkable resi
liency after losing t heir top four players off
last year's team — Jim Delaney, John Whit
linger. Nick Saviano and dene Mayer. De
laney graduated, Whitlinger and Saviano
turned pro early and Mayer — well, that's
a story in itself. Me hardly played at all this
season and there are two reasons why.
The first, and Mayer's favorite, is that he
suffered a pulled back muscle and caught
a virus. It's hard to believe that a three
month-long season doesn't provide
enough time to overcome those problems
and to play some competitive tennis.
The second, and more unfortunate
reason is that Mayer is concerned about
himself arid not the team. If his body
bruises easily, that's nothing compared to
his pride. Hard as it is for me to believe,

ond or third singles against HOILA at
