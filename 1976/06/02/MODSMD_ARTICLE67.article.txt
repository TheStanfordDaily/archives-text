# How talent, publicity determine All-America teams
## 
### David Georgette 
The world of the All-Americans rejoices
in superlatives and delights in achieve
ments, but some of the time it embodies
ignorance and plays politics.
How does Stanford approach All
- selections? "Our philosophy
here is to try to get recognition for as many
athletes as we can," said Gary Cavalli,
sports information director. "My role is bas
ically to try to distribute material about the
players as widely as possible," he said.
The material may be used by the press
men or coaches when they select about
eight post-season and five pre-season All-
American football teams and four post
season basketball teams, according to
Cavalli.
Critics say that in making the press and
fans aware of a player, schools have occa
sionally pushed a product, not a player.
For example, in 1970, the University of
Mississipi put together a publicity cam
paign for its quarterback and Heisman
Trophy candidate Archie Manning. "Ar
chie" buttons, bumperstickers. posters.
T-shirts and dolls flooded the Magnolia
State.
'Extra effort'
The same season was Jim Plunkett's final
year as Stanford's quarterback. Most of
Plunkett's statistics were superior to Man
ning's. Stanford printed a brochure about
Flunkett and distributed it to sportswriters.
"To give Flunkett a chance to win the Heis

man, we had to put out an extra effort to
compensate what Mississippi did," Cavalli
said, "I wish we hadn't had to do that."
However, Cavalli said, "I'm not sure
where you can draw the line between get
ting recognition for the program and the
player and merchandising the player."
Russ Ewald, assistant sports information
director at USC, said he thinks there's "no
correlation between merchandising" and
getting recognition. He said playing for a
big name university with an intersectional
schedule and getting on television helps
players' chances for All-American.
Cavalli concurred with Ewald's assess
ments, and offers them as the reasons USC
has had almost 75 football All-Americans.
"They've had a succession of great running
backs, they win, they get a lot of recognition
and they are on TV,"said Cavalli.
Because television often emphasizes
"glamor" positions in football, Cavalli said
his office will regularly write features "on a
lot of people who play relatively obscure
positions."
"Some schools direct their attention to
one or two guys,"Cavalli stated, "A lot of
schools will pick a kid from a political
standpoint, and try to pump him up. We
don't operate that way here."
UCLA Sports Information Director (SID)
Vic Kelly said an All-American candidate
"has to have done or have some physical
quality that you can hang your hat on."
Though UCLA has had many basketball

and football players acclaimed as All
- Kelly said it's unfair to charac
terize his office as being strictly for promot
ing the players. "We are hired to disseminate
news about the UCLA teams, and there are
18 of them. We're not hired to make All-
Americans."
While Kelly stated that outstanding phys
ical ability is enough to allow for considera
tion for eventual All-American standing.
Cavalli disagreed. "I object to when an SID
or a coaching staff pumps up a player on the
basis of potential."
Disillusionment
Besides, he added. "If you build up ex
pectations too high, it can cause disillu
sionment among the team's fans" should
the player not perform as well as predicted.
Cavalli said he thinks quarterbacks Mike
Cordova or Cuy Benjamin might have been
mentioned as potential All-Americans this
year except "the fact that they've shared the
job has made it difficult to make a solid case
for either of them."
Sports information offices have their
largest effect on who is chosen to the pre
season football teams, Cavalli said, because
often these squads are selected with a
minimum of first-hand information. "They
rely on information we supply them with."
said Cavalli. "Very few get out and dig."
Cavalli said there are problems with
All-American selection either by coaches or
writers. This is because "a heckuva lot of
sportswriters who vote for All-American

don't know the first thing iibout football"
while the coaches aren't able to see all the
candidates.
But tor national teams. "There will be
politics whether the coaches or sportswrit
ers do the voting." he said. By politics.
Cavalli said he meant incidents where "a
guy will get credit he might not necessarily
deserve."
VlcColl bumped
Cavalli cited the case of defensive end
Duncan McColl.who is studying at Cliveden
this spring, and the Playboy pre-season
All-Ainerican team. Initially selected to the
team. McColl was dropped from the squad
when Playboy decided it would cost to
much to fly the Cardinal from England to
Chicago for the team photo.
"Whether Duncan or receiver Tony Hill
•make Ail-American this year, a lot of people
will blame me or credit me." said Cavalli. "I
really get upset when someone says 'Why
didn't you get so-and-so All-American?'
People are kidding themselves when they
think theSID is responsible for getting a guy
All-American." said Cavalli.
What would be a better way to select
Ail-Americans? Football coach Jack Christ
iansen said bethought a meeting of coaches
which could take its time in evaluating
films of the players would be the best.
As for the present system. Cavalli said.
"It's flawed and overemphasized, but it.'s
still good. It's still important to get the guys
the recognition they deserve."

Sports information offices have their
largest effect on who is chosen to the pre
season football teams, Cavalli said, because
often these squads are selected with a
minimum of first-hand information. "They
rely on information we supply them with."
said Cavalli. "Very few get out and dig."
Cavalli said there are problems with
All-American selection either by coaches or
writers. This is because "a heckuva lot of
sportswriters who vote for All-American

don't know the first thing iibout football"
while the coaches aren't able to see all the
candidates.

Cavalli cited the case of defensive end
Duncan McColl.who is studying at Cliveden
this spring, and the Playboy pre-season
All-Ainerican team. Initially selected to the
team. McColl was dropped from the squad
when Playboy decided it would cost to
much to fly the Cardinal from England to
Chicago for the team photo.
"Whether Duncan or receiver Tony Hill
•make Ail-American this year, a lot of people
will blame me or credit me." said Cavalli. "I
really get upset when someone says 'Why
didn't you get so-and-so All-American?'
People are kidding themselves when they
think theSID is responsible for getting a guy
All-American." said Cavalli.
What would be a better way to select
Ail-Americans? Football coach Jack Christ
iansen said bethought a meeting of coaches
which could take its time in evaluating
films of the players would be the best.
As for the present system. Cavalli said.
"It's flawed and overemphasized, but it.'s
still good. It's still important to get the guys
the recognition they deserve."
The world of the All-Americans rejoices
in superlatives and delights in achieve
ments, but some of the time it embodies
ignorance and plays politics.
How does Stanford approach All
- selections? "Our philosophy
here is to try to get recognition for as many
athletes as we can," said Gary Cavalli,
sports information director. "My role is bas
ically to try to distribute material about the
players as widely as possible," he said.
The material may be used by the press
men or coaches when they select about
eight post-season and five pre-season All-
American football teams and four post
season basketball teams, according to
Cavalli.
Critics say that in making the press and
fans aware of a player, schools have occa
sionally pushed a product, not a player.
For example, in 1970, the University of
Mississipi put together a publicity cam
paign for its quarterback and Heisman
Trophy candidate Archie Manning. "Ar
chie" buttons, bumperstickers. posters.
T-shirts and dolls flooded the Magnolia
State.
'Extra effort'
The same season was Jim Plunkett's final
year as Stanford's quarterback. Most of
Plunkett's statistics were superior to Man
ning's. Stanford printed a brochure about
Flunkett and distributed it to sportswriters.
"To give Flunkett a chance to win the Heis

man, we had to put out an extra effort to
compensate what Mississippi did," Cavalli
said, "I wish we hadn't had to do that."
However, Cavalli said, "I'm not sure
where you can draw the line between get
ting recognition for the program and the
player and merchandising the player."
Russ Ewald, assistant sports information
director at USC, said he thinks there's "no
correlation between merchandising" and
getting recognition. He said playing for a
big name university with an intersectional
schedule and getting on television helps
players' chances for All-American.
Cavalli concurred with Ewald's assess
ments, and offers them as the reasons USC
has had almost 75 football All-Americans.
"They've had a succession of great running
backs, they win, they get a lot of recognition
and they are on TV,"said Cavalli.
Because television often emphasizes
"glamor" positions in football, Cavalli said
his office will regularly write features "on a
lot of people who play relatively obscure
positions."
"Some schools direct their attention to
one or two guys,"Cavalli stated, "A lot of
schools will pick a kid from a political
standpoint, and try to pump him up. We
don't operate that way here."
UCLA Sports Information Director (SID)
Vic Kelly said an All-American candidate
"has to have done or have some physical
quality that you can hang your hat on."
Though UCLA has had many basketball

and football players acclaimed as All
- Kelly said it's unfair to charac
terize his office as being strictly for promot
ing the players. "We are hired to disseminate
news about the UCLA teams, and there are
18 of them. We're not hired to make All-
Americans."
While Kelly stated that outstanding phys
ical ability is enough to allow for considera
tion for eventual All-American standing.
Cavalli disagreed. "I object to when an SID
or a coaching staff pumps up a player on the
basis of potential."
Disillusionment
Besides, he added. "If you build up ex
pectations too high, it can cause disillu
sionment among the team's fans" should
the player not perform as well as predicted.

compensate what Mississippi did," Cavalli
said, "I wish we hadn't had to do that."
However, Cavalli said, "I'm not sure
where you can draw the line between get
ting recognition for the program and the
player and merchandising the player."
Russ Ewald, assistant sports information
director at USC, said he thinks there's "no
correlation between merchandising" and
getting recognition. He said playing for a
big name university with an intersectional
schedule and getting on television helps
players' chances for All-American.
Cavalli concurred with Ewald's assess
ments, and offers them as the reasons USC
has had almost 75 football All-Americans.
"They've had a succession of great running
backs, they win, they get a lot of recognition
and they are on TV,"said Cavalli.
Because television often emphasizes
"glamor" positions in football, Cavalli said
his office will regularly write features "on a
lot of people who play relatively obscure
positions."
"Some schools direct their attention to
one or two guys,"Cavalli stated, "A lot of
schools will pick a kid from a political
standpoint, and try to pump him up. We
don't operate that way here."
UCLA Sports Information Director (SID)
Vic Kelly said an All-American candidate
"has to have done or have some physical
quality that you can hang your hat on."
Though UCLA has had many basketball

and football players acclaimed as All
- Kelly said it's unfair to charac
terize his office as being strictly for promot
ing the players. "We are hired to disseminate
news about the UCLA teams, and there are
18 of them. We're not hired to make All-
Americans."
While Kelly stated that outstanding phys
ical ability is enough to allow for considera
tion for eventual All-American standing.
Cavalli disagreed. "I object to when an SID
or a coaching staff pumps up a player on the
basis of potential."
Disillusionment
Besides, he added. "If you build up ex
pectations too high, it can cause disillu
sionment among the team's fans" should
the player not perform as well as predicted.
Cavalli said he thinks quarterbacks Mike
Cordova or Cuy Benjamin might have been
mentioned as potential All-Americans this
year except "the fact that they've shared the
job has made it difficult to make a solid case
for either of them."
Sports information offices have their
largest effect on who is chosen to the pre
season football teams, Cavalli said, because
often these squads are selected with a
minimum of first-hand information. "They
rely on information we supply them with."
said Cavalli. "Very few get out and dig."
Cavalli said there are problems with
All-American selection either by coaches or
writers. This is because "a heckuva lot of
sportswriters who vote for All-American

don't know the first thing iibout football"
while the coaches aren't able to see all the
candidates.
But tor national teams. "There will be
politics whether the coaches or sportswrit
ers do the voting." he said. By politics.
Cavalli said he meant incidents where "a
guy will get credit he might not necessarily
deserve."
VlcColl bumped
Cavalli cited the case of defensive end
Duncan McColl.who is studying at Cliveden
this spring, and the Playboy pre-season
All-Ainerican team. Initially selected to the
team. McColl was dropped from the squad
when Playboy decided it would cost to
much to fly the Cardinal from England to
Chicago for the team photo.
"Whether Duncan or receiver Tony Hill
•make Ail-American this year, a lot of people
will blame me or credit me." said Cavalli. "I
really get upset when someone says 'Why
didn't you get so-and-so All-American?'
People are kidding themselves when they
think theSID is responsible for getting a guy
All-American." said Cavalli.
What would be a better way to select
Ail-Americans? Football coach Jack Christ
iansen said bethought a meeting of coaches
which could take its time in evaluating
films of the players would be the best.
As for the present system. Cavalli said.
"It's flawed and overemphasized, but it.'s
still good. It's still important to get the guys
the recognition they deserve."
The world of the All-Americans rejoices
in superlatives and delights in achieve
ments, but some of the time it embodies
ignorance and plays politics.
How does Stanford approach All
- selections? "Our philosophy
here is to try to get recognition for as many
athletes as we can," said Gary Cavalli,
sports information director. "My role is bas
ically to try to distribute material about the
players as widely as possible," he said.
The material may be used by the press
men or coaches when they select about
eight post-season and five pre-season All-
American football teams and four post
season basketball teams, according to
Cavalli.
Critics say that in making the press and
fans aware of a player, schools have occa
sionally pushed a product, not a player.
For example, in 1970, the University of
Mississipi put together a publicity cam
paign for its quarterback and Heisman
Trophy candidate Archie Manning. "Ar
chie" buttons, bumperstickers. posters.
T-shirts and dolls flooded the Magnolia
State.
'Extra effort'
The same season was Jim Plunkett's final
year as Stanford's quarterback. Most of
Plunkett's statistics were superior to Man
ning's. Stanford printed a brochure about
Flunkett and distributed it to sportswriters.
"To give Flunkett a chance to win the Heis

man, we had to put out an extra effort to
compensate what Mississippi did," Cavalli
said, "I wish we hadn't had to do that."
