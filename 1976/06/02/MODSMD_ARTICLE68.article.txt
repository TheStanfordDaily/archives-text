# Trackmen head to NCAAs

LaV winter the track press
guide came out with three Rob
ber Barons on the cover. Dis
tance runner Tony Sandoval was
pictured on the front, long
jumper James Lofton on the back
and high hurdler John Foster on
the inside back cover.
Nobody credits Cary Cavalli,
sports information director, with
prescience, but the trio pictured
are the three athletes represent
ing Stanford at the NCAA Track
and Field Championships in
Philadelphia tin; next four days.
This year's championships
carry double importance be
cause this is an Olympic year.
Not only will the meet serve as a
preview for the upcoming U.S.
Olympic Track and Field Trials
in Eugene, but it also features
many top foreign athletes.
Balanced blend
Using a balanced blend of
foreign and domestic talent.
USC is favored by many to take
this year's team title. The Tro
jans. who have won 25 NCAA
track crowns in the past, must
hold off challenges from, among
others, Tennessee and Texas-El
Paso (UTEP), the 1074 and 1075
team winners.
While USC attempts to de
throne UTEP. Sandoval has a
similar goal when helinesupfor
the 10.000 meters against last

year's six-milo champion,
Washington State's John Ngeno.
Sandoval defeated the Ken
yan, 1975's NCAA track athlete
of the year. May 14 at Berkeley in
the Pacific-8 10.000 meter
championshi p.
Sandoval said that perhaps
even more than Ngeno, Illinois'
Craig Virgin is the runner to beat
this year. Virgin, who beat
Ngeno on his way to the NCAA
cross country title last fa 11. is the
man Sandy will key on.
'Sitting game'
"It may be another sitting
game." Sandoval said, referring
to the kind ol strategy he used to
upset Ngeno and his Kenyan
teammates, Joshua Kimeto and
Samson Kimombwa, in Ber
keley.
Sandoval not only has to battle
an excellent field in Philadel
phia, he has to overcome the ef
fects of his run a week and a half
ago in the U.S. Olympic
Marathon Trial.
"I'll be lucky to finish." Tony
joshed as he discussed the wear
suffered from the 26-mile ordeal.
"I don't know whether I'll be
back at full strength by Friday.
But my legs bounced back real
fast after the race, so who
knows?"
Whereas Sandoval is bounc
ing back from a fun that exhausts
most people just to watch, hur
dler Foster is coming off a
lifetime best of 13.7 recorded at
the California Relays in Modesto
May 22.
NCAA veteran
The senior from Los Altos, like
Sandoval and Lofton a veteran of
last year's NCAA meet, antici
pated a good week in the city of
brotherly love.
"It should be just as fun as List
year," Foster says."I have never
been to the East Coast before.
And it should be all different
people this year."
Among the new faces are Dedy
Cooper of San Jose State and
Mike Robertson of Florida,
coholders of the national prep
record for the 12-yard high hur
dles. The two set the record of
13.2 last year.
Although Robertson and
standout Larry Shipp of LSI' run
in the Fast, Foster maintains,
"All of the bod ones are from
back here on the West Coast."
Seeks top eight
Foster, one of the burl ones,
says he would like to be one of
the top eight finishers. A finish
in the top eight picks up points
for the team; a finish in the first
four secures Ail-American
status.

Indeed. Foster declared. "All
three of us should be Ail-
Americans."
Lofton was just a bit short of
Ail-American last spring, and
was even closer to placing. He
finished ninth with a leap of
25-3V4. The sophomore from Los
Angeles finally bested that jump
with a 2F>-7'/4 effort at the
California Relays 11 days ago.
Stanford track coach Payton
Jordan says, "We've been work
ing with James on two things.
First, he has been working on
elevation off the board, and sec
ond, extension of his legs into
the pit."
Jordan, who along with assis
tant coach Marshall ("lark is ac
companying the three out East,
says."The three have enough
experience so that they can
handle anything that will come
up back there."
For Sandoval, who just missed
the third place finish in the
marathon that would have
earned him a spot on the Olym
pic team, there is hope that this
time there will be more magic to
the number three.
