' The University yesterday charged
two members of the Stanford Band for
violating the Campus Disruption Pol
icy when they participated in a May 24
band performance in Meyer Under
graduate Library (UGLY). James Siena,
legal adviser to the president, an
nounced yesterday.
Siena declined to identify the two
individuals, but did say they were in
the "leadership of the band." How
ever. sources say the two charged are
Band manager Kent Blumberg. a
junior, and drum major Jim Jett, a
sophomore.
Siena said he doubted that more
band members would be charged.
"I don't imagine any more evidence
will come to light. This has been
thoroughly investigated," said Siena.
"For our purposes it's sufficient to
proceed with the people we have. This
case is kind of a precedent," he added.
The prosecutions stem from an inci
dent on May 24. About 50 band mem
bers and the dollies entered UGLY
shortly before in p.m. that night. After
playing two songs, the band left UGLY
around 10:05 p.m.
Ellen King, a law student who is rep
resenting the band, said yesterday,"I
haven't seen the charges and haven't
had achanceto talk to those charged."
King said no decision had yet been
made on whether to seek a hearing be
fore Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons or before the Stanford Judicial
Council. Â«
The Legislative and Judicial Charter
of 1968, as amended, provides for the

Dean of Student Affairs to hear cases if
he agrees to do so and if the charged
student pleads guilty.
Rich Johnson, assistant band man
ager, said last Friday that any prosecu
tions would not be "that big a deal."
Johnson said he felt that "any ex
pansion in publicity would hurt those
who would be charged."
Siena also said a student who al
legedly altered a housing priority card
was charged May 24 with violating the
Fundamental Standard.
