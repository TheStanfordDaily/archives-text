# Students to prepare survey on athletics
## 
### George Anders 
After its first quarter of exis
tence, the Student Athletic
Committee is ready to begin a
wide variety of projects, accord
ing to Ceorge Pegelow, a com
mittee member and a kenpo ka
rate instructor here.
Tin? most important project,
Pegelow said, will be a "very
exhaustive survey" of attitudes
here toward many forms of athle
tics.
The committee will decide on
actual questions in a meeting
Monday. Pegelow said. The
questionnaire will be adminis
tered during fall quarter.
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
predicted the results of the sur
vey will be "very helpful in
terms of getting basic input."
Ruetz cautioned, though, that he
was "a little skeptical "as to how
substantive a role the survey will
play in department budget deci
sions.
Vicki Hays, a member of the
committee who competes for the
women's swim team, said the
survey will ask what sort of ba
lance persons would like be
tween intercollegiate. IM and
recreational sports. This infor
mation will be used to look into
facility use and budgeting,

Pegelow said.
Several committee members
will also be given access to some
of the information in the de
partment's budget, Pegelow
said. Although Ruetz noted that
salaries will not be disclosed, he
said this action will "givethem
some conception of how we al
locate resources."
Pegelow added that he be
lieved "if several members are
conversant with the budget, then
we can talk about it on our own
terms."
Another project being consi
dered. Hays said, is to establish
peer counseling for incoming
athletes. She said the counseling
would be "academic â€” con
cerned with the athlete who has
no idea how much time their
sport is going to take. Later, they
find out they can't handle it."
Some informal counseling al
ready exists, Ruetz said, but
Hays said she hopes to extend
counseling to minor and wo
men's sports.
Ruetz said no tensions have
arisen between the department
and the committee, saying "my
general impression is that the
committee members want to be
helpful."
