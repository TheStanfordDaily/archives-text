# Cards seek Olympic berths
## 
### Jeff Parietti 
Former Olympic swimmers
John Hencken and Jo
1 larshbarger lead a contingent of
Stanford athletes trying to qual
ify for the 1976 Olympic sum
mer games in Montreal.
Hencken, who won a gold
medal in the 100 meter
breaststroke and added a bronze
in the2oobreast in Munich, took
spring quarter off to train exten
sively for the games.
"Hencken looks very strong,"
swim coach Jim Gaughran said.
"If anybody's a sure bet, he's the
one." Hencken has bounced
back after suffering from
mononucleosis earlier in the
year.
Hencken and the other swim
mers are shooting for the U.S.
trials, to be held June 16-20 at
Long Beach.
Freshman Harshbarger, a na
tive of Bellevue, Wash., placed
eighth in the 800 meter freestyle
at the '72 Olympics.
Sure bet
Another sure bet is Mike
Bruner, who took the year off
from school to concentrate on
training.
Gaughran said that "Bruner
looks like he should make it,"
noting that "he's in a very com
petitive area." At the trials,
Bruner will probably swim the
400 and 1500 free and has also
qualified for the 200 butterfly,
the 200 free and the 400 Indi
vidual Medley, according to
Gaughran.
Junior Dave Fairbank also has
a good chance. Fairbank, an al
ternate on a relay team in the '72
Games, will swim the 100 free at
the trials.
"Fairbank has made it before,"
said Gaughran, "and we'll just
have to see how it goes."
Another woman swimmer.
Kim Peyton, who will be a
freshman here next fall, will
compete in the 100 and 200 free.
She has consistently finished in
the top three at nationals in these
events.
Less likely candidates are
senior Graig Van Zandt in the
200 free, sophomore Stu Gorliss
in the 200 breast, freshman Jim
Belardi in the 200 butterfly.
Sophomore Bill Ghao will swim
distance freestvle races for

Taiwan.
From the track team, there are
three contenders for Olympic
berths.
Second marathon
Senior Tony Sandoval has al
ready gained a spot as an Olym
pic alternate in the marathon,
after finishing fourth in the
grueling event at the U.S. trials
in Eugene. Running in only his
second marathon, be became the;
12th fastest American ever in the
event.
Sandoval hopes to make the
qualifying standard in the
10,000 meters and run in the
U.S. track and field trials to be
held in Eugene, June 19-27.
Even if Sandoval fails to make
the team in the 10,000 he will
still have an outside chance of
running the marathon in the
Games.
Former Stanford distance
runner Don kardong, who
placed third in the marathon
trials to earn an Olympic spot,
will try to make the squad in the

5000 meters. If he does, he has
said he will cede his marathon
spot to Sandoval. Â«
Sophomore long jumper
James Lofton and senior high
hurdler John Foster both have
qualified for the trials. Lofton
has a best of 25-7. while Foster
has a top mark of 13.7. Both are
rated as having outside chances
of making the team.
In gymnastics, sophomore
Bob Farb will be at t he final U.S.
trials. June 24-25 at I'onn State,
where the top seven finishers
will make the team.
Wrestling coach Joe DeMeo
and 1975 graduate Stanford
Ghris Horpel were back in Il
linois last weekend <it the U.S.
Olympic wrestling camp. Hor
pel has an outside shot at secur
ing a berth. DeMeo is an assistant
coach for the team.
Grew coach Dick Dreis
sigacker will be trying to make
the U.S. crew squad, while
freshman Gathy Thaxton is cur
rently at the women's Olympic

crew camp. Thaxton, who has
been rowing for four years and
has competed in the nationals
twice, is one of 30 women in
vited to try out for 16 spots.
So, if you're watching the
Olympics on TV this summer
and you see a familiar face,
chances are it could be a Stan
ford athlete striving for gold,
silver or bronze.
