# Shuffling the Cards
## Picking athletes of the year 
### Chris Baker 
The Stickney Foundation does it
every month. And in about two weeks
Sports Information Director Gary
Cavalli will do it.
Stickney's hands out an award to its
outstanding Stanford athlete every
month. Cavalli will name the winner of
the Masters Award, which goes to the
senior athlete who has made outstand
ing contributions to his/her team and
has excelled academically; The Athle
tic Department also hands out an award
for athletic excellence alone.
Everybody, from the NFL to Fop
Warner football, has gotten into the
business of handing out awards. The
recipients receive "prizes ranging all the
way from new autos to plaques which
will gather dust.
While I can't afford to give out a
plaque or new car 1 will give a copy of
this'column to two winners of the first
Robber Baron Scholar-Athlete of the
Year Award.
fchy person
Tony Sandoval is probably one of the
shyest persons you'd ever meet. When
you approach the diminutive Sandoval
alter he's just won a race, he'll probably
tell you he didn't do anything special
and that you should go talk to Assistant
Track Coach Marshall Clark.
Three Fridays ago, reporters cor
nered Sandoval on a grassy knoll a few
yards away from the Edwards Stadium
track where he had just upset three
time Pacific:-8 10.000 meter champion

John Ngeno to win the conference
10,000 meter crown.
Although Sandoval had just run over
six miles, he patiently stood there
while reporters asked him everything
except his favorite color.
Two weeks later, running only the
second marathon in his life, Sandoval
won an alternate spot on the U.S.
Olympic team, finishing fourth behind
former Stanford distance runner Don
Kardong in the marathon trials at
Eugene, Ore.
Grueling test
Sandy and kardong had run stride
tor-stride in the grueling endurance
test. When Kardong pulled away from
Sandoval, the senior could see his
hopes for a trip to Montreal (lying
away. He entered the stadium and
waved politely to the crowd.
Clark, sitting in the stands, started to
cry. He was seeing two of his runners —
one who had made it and one who just
missed.
But Sandoval will probably end up
running in Montreal. Kardong plans to
try for a spot in the 5000 meters as well,
and if he makes it, his spot will au
tomatically go to Sandoval.
But Sandoval can still make it on his
own. Sandy will be shooting to meet
the Olympic qualifying standard in the
10,000-meter run at the NCAA track
and field championships.

A premed-engineering major, San
doval plans to turn to his native Los
Alamos, N.M., after he completes med
ical school. He has carried around 20
units while competing in track and
cross country.
He's already been named Northern
California Track Athlete of the Year,
beting out UC-Berkeley's James Robin
son. Sandoval will walk off with the
Master's Award, according to Cavalli.
It couldn't have gone to a finer guy.
And I pick Sandy as one Robber Baron
of the Year.
Senior Ted Marcy won't be in
Montreal this summer, competing for
the U.S. Olympic gymnastic team. But
not because he isn't good enough. •
Marcy capped his Stanford career by
winning his third consecutive NCAA
side horse crown this year. He won the
Pac-8 crown in the event for four
straight years.
Olympic competition is limited to
all-around though. So Marcy will be
staying home next monh. Gymnastics
Coach Sadao Hamada commented that
if specialty competition were held in
the Games, "Marcy would probably
win a gold medal."
Marcy will be attending medical
school at Yale next year. He isn't sure if
he'll compete then. If anyone has
brought recognition to Stanford gym
nastics, it is Marcy. Here are some more
laurels for Marcy, the other Robber
Baron Scholar-Athlete of the Year.
