# PA artist enlivens downtown locales

### Mark Bamberger 
On the corner of University and
Waverly Avenues in Palo Alto, a man
stands in a trench coat with a turned
up collar. His hands are deep in his
pockets and the brim of his hat rests on
his dark glasses. Motionless, he
watches what goes on about him.
At Wideman's men's store on Uni
versity, a masked burglar in a jump
suit has just landed on the roof. He is
looking around, hurriedly trying to
decide which way to go. His partner, a
similarly attired woman, is close be
hind, sliding down a rope that hangs
over the wall from which they diop
ped.
At University and Cowpor, there is a
woman in a heavy coat with a pelican
on a leash.
These are not real people. Rather,
they are t he work of artist (Ireg Brown,
24, of Palo Alto. Since January, he has
painted several similar characters on
the walls of Palo Alto buildings.
Public art
Brown is working on Palo Alto's "art
in public, places" projectand is funded
by a federal Comprehensive Employ
ment Training Act grant.
If you've been in Palo Alto, perhaps
you've seen his "wall people." II you
have, and if you were shocked,
amazed, scared or maybe just amused,
then Brown has achieved his goal.
Brown says he is a "funster" who
enjoys "watching people see some
thing unusual." This shows up not
only in his art but in the rest of his life
as well.
I le is a "master of surprise," aecord
i ng to his wife, Julie. She recalls that in
the San Francisco apartment in which
lit; lived hi; had a coffin for a couch.
Macabre phase
Visitors to his small but comfortable
home are greeted by what Brown says
is part ol the "macabre phase" that he
went through. On a shelf outside the
front door rest two hrittleanimal skulls
with a wax finger sticking out of each.
Inside are many of his own works,
including several from his Recent
"Vegetables on Vacation" show. In
one piece, humanized fruits and veg
etables with arms and legs battle each
other. In the picture, a banana, armed
with a knife, cuts a bell pepper in two,
just as it is about to stab a helpless
tomato with a fork.
All over Palo Alto people enjoy talk
ing about how they wore fooled by
Brown's work. One woman said she
once asked directions from the picture
of the man pushing his cat in a cart.
Another admits that she was once af

raid to cross the street because "the
spy" scared.her.
"The spy" has had the police called
on him three times, and he has been
attacked once. "But he's asking for it."
Brown said proudly.
Mystique
While many people are fascinated
by his work, Brown's identity fre
quently is a mystery. Brown says he
enjoys the mystique, but he sees no
reason for it. as he is not at all secretive.
In broad daylight on YVaverly Avenue,
he finished his latest character, an old
woman watering her plants.
Tall, lean and neatly dressed in a
loose, long-sleeved shirt and a pair of
slim-cut jeans, he casually dabbed
varnish on the arms of the woman.
The piece is his latest surprise, as the
woman is his grandmother. She does
not know about it and will not be told,
he said. However, he expects that she
will see it sooner or later. He chose
his grandmother, he says, "just to
make her happy."
As he worked, passersby constantly
stopped and complimented him.
"Thank you. thank you very much."
Brown responded awkwardly.
"Aw, shucks," he said, attempting
to find a new. cute way to acknow
ledge the praise.
Mustachioed man
Later, he put on his dark glasses,
smoothly lit up a cigaretteand sat com
fortably on a nearby staircase. People
who stopped to look at the new piece
did not realize that the handsome,
mustachioed young man was at all in
volved with the work.
Brown enjoys doing the wall work
because he feels it is "people's art." "It
is something they can relate to," he
said, "and everyone feels a part of it."
Unlike gallery art, he said "people are
not intimidated by it."
Although he has now completed six
wall pieces, he said the project came
about unintentionally. He was simply
"doodling" while working on other
city projects, he said, when he came up
with the trenchcoat man. He "liked
him so much as a character" that he
had to find a place for him.
He says he "conned" the owner of
the Palo Alto Drug Co. into letting him
put the man up outside the store. That
was the only one that he planned to do,
he said.
"That was it as far as I was con
cerned," he said. But people became so
excited about it that Brown continued
to do them.
The attention he has been getting is
new for Brown, and he readily admits

that he enjoys it.
"It is pleasant, to say the least," he
said.
"I was always a super loner," he
said, but this project has "brought me
out of my shell."
"For the first time in my life," he
said, "I have a real sense of commun
ity, and I dig it."
Brown, a Palo Alto High School
graduate, worked in a local gallery
while in high school â€” he said he
"hardly went to school." At 17, when
he graduated, he knew that he wanted
to be an artist. "It was all I was ever
interested in," he said.
A few years ago Brown would not
have believed that today he would be
working for the city. He was involved
with the hippie movement and was
heavily into drugs.

"I was a real druggie," he says,"and
for a while all 1 did was drop acid and
paint."
Brown eventually gave up drugsand
settled down. In this regard, he says, at
one point "1 just decided that it was
time to put my toys away and get some
thing going so I could bring my toys
out.again."
Brown's federal grant terminates in
July, at-which point he will no longer
be working for Palo Alto. Just where
his art will take; him in the future is at
this point uncertain, although he says
he has lined up a few private projects.
Wherever he goes, however. Brown
has seen to it that he and his wife will
not be "leaving" Palo Alto. This is be
cause they are the "Wideman burg
lars."


Caught in the act

downtown storefront. While this passerby appeared unperturbed, others have
