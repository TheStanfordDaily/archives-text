# New frosh played the waiting game

Selected from the largest applicant
pool in the University's history, the
newly admitted class of 1980 was very
concerned with "questions of finan
cial aid and how to make the decision
(of where to go)" before electing to
matriculate at Stanford, according to
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon.
Although the Admissions Office has
"always allowed leeway" for applic
ants to postpone their decision
whether to matriculate here until after
the May 1 deadline. Hargadon "can't
remember in years" in the Admissions
Office more requests for delays from
admitted students.
While he expects such requests to
increase in coming years. Hargadon
defends the flexibility policy.
"We must provide for a strenuous
thinking process." and a period of two
weeks "just isn't reasonable" to decide
between several colleges.
The applicant pool, up three percent
from last year, totaled 10.013. Female
applicants were up four percent versus
a two percent male increase.
42 percent female
Statistics on the new class, tentative
because of anticipated attrition
through the summer, reveal slight in
creases over last year in female en
rollment (to 42 percent), matriculation
from public secondary schools and the
number of applicants accepted from
the waiting list.

The nurpber of minority students in
the class is down from last year.
About 80 black students and as
many chicano students will matricu
late. These figures are down by a few
from last year but up from 1974 Har
gadon linked the decline to a "bidding
game for minority students" by many
colleges.
From 2512 total offers of admission
(including some applicants from the
waiting list). 1562 applicants have in
dicated they will enroll in the fall.
Hargadon anticipates that !U) to4o will
drop out over the summer and is aim
ing for a class size of 1500 in Sep
tember.
Yield'
The ratio of applicants deciding to
enroll to offers of admission (the
"yield") is the same as last year, al
though the Admissions Office had an
ticipated that it would decrease bo
cause of the rise in tuition costs.
Geographic data reveals a decline to
45 percent in the number of applicants
from California. This figure approxi
mates 1 larvard's draw from a similarly
sized region in the East. At the present
time, the class includes "students from
every state." according to Hargadon.
Administartive and computer prob
lems have delayed the compiling of
statistics. The Admissions Office had
planned to use terminals hooked di
rectly to the main campus computer,
but had to return to batch processing
on the registrar's smaller machine.

The ratio of applicants deciding to
enroll to offers of admission (the
"yield") is the same as last year, al
though the Admissions Office had an
ticipated that it would decrease bo
cause of the rise in tuition costs.
Geographic data reveals a decline to
45 percent in the number of applicants
from California. This figure approxi
mates 1 larvard's draw from a similarly
sized region in the East. At the present
time, the class includes "students from
every state." according to Hargadon.
Administartive and computer prob
lems have delayed the compiling of
statistics. The Admissions Office had
planned to use terminals hooked di
rectly to the main campus computer,
but had to return to batch processing
on the registrar's smaller machine.
Selected from the largest applicant
pool in the University's history, the
newly admitted class of 1980 was very
concerned with "questions of finan
cial aid and how to make the decision
(of where to go)" before electing to
matriculate at Stanford, according to
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon.
Although the Admissions Office has
"always allowed leeway" for applic
ants to postpone their decision
whether to matriculate here until after
the May 1 deadline. Hargadon "can't
remember in years" in the Admissions
Office more requests for delays from
admitted students.
While he expects such requests to
increase in coming years. Hargadon
defends the flexibility policy.
"We must provide for a strenuous
thinking process." and a period of two
weeks "just isn't reasonable" to decide
between several colleges.
The applicant pool, up three percent
from last year, totaled 10.013. Female
applicants were up four percent versus
a two percent male increase.
42 percent female
Statistics on the new class, tentative
because of anticipated attrition
through the summer, reveal slight in
creases over last year in female en
rollment (to 42 percent), matriculation
from public secondary schools and the
number of applicants accepted from
the waiting list.

The nurpber of minority students in
the class is down from last year.
About 80 black students and as
many chicano students will matricu
late. These figures are down by a few
from last year but up from 1974 Har
gadon linked the decline to a "bidding
game for minority students" by many
colleges.
From 2512 total offers of admission
(including some applicants from the
waiting list). 1562 applicants have in
dicated they will enroll in the fall.
Hargadon anticipates that !U) to4o will
drop out over the summer and is aim
ing for a class size of 1500 in Sep
tember.
