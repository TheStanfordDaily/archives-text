# Brown delivering final sermon before leaving
## 
### Bruce Kadden 
Robert McAfee Urown will be
preaching his last sermon .it Stanford.
Saturday afternoon at 2::H) in Memo
rial Church during the traditional bac
calaureate service prior to graduation.
The religious studies professor, an
ordained Presbyterian minister who
served as Acting Dean of Chapel in
1*172-197,'! is ending a 14-year stint
here to return to New York's Union
Theological Seminary to become Pro
fessor of Ecumenics and World Christ
ianity.
Mrown will be speaking about "The
Need for Passion." which he believes
will be a crucial issue "on the
academic scene in the next few years."
At universities there! is a "need to be;
engaged in the truth one investigates
and not simply a matter of impersonal
research." Urown said, admitting that
many persons here do not agree with
him.
Put Brown is used to being a con
troversial figure, dating back to his in
volvement in the civil rights move
ment and anti-Vietnam War activism.
In fact, when the Board of Trustees
was approving his appointment here
as a full professor. Brown, unknown to
its members, was in a Mississippi jiiil
coll for participating in a civil rights
demonstration.
"I try to make a preaching/teaching
distinction," he explains. They are
"interrelated for me. but I can't de

m;i in I thiit t he students bring into class
wh.it they would bring into a chapel."
Teaching, doing
Sometimes, though, teaching and
doing become interrelated. In 19f>5 ra
cial tensions were building in Selma.
as Brown prepared to lecture on race
relations in his Christian Ethics
course.
Brown immediately went to Selma
to gain a deeper insight into the issue,
which he believes allowed him to have
a better impact on the students.
Urown has had more than his share
of trips from which to bring back first
hand information, the most notable

probably being when he was a Protes
tant observer at Vatican. II.
More recently. Brown traveled to
Southeast Asia, visiting Phnom Penh
two weeks before the capital city of
Cambodia fell to to Khmer Rouge.
On that some trip he was scheduled
to travel with other clergy to South
Vietnam, but was denied a visa to enter
the country, undoubtedly because of
his anti-war activity in the states.
In Nairobi
Last fall Brown gave the keynote ad
dress at t he World Council of Churches
meeting in Nairobi. Africa.
Hrown will he involved with impro
ving relationships between clergy in
tin; United States and in Third World
countries ;is part of his new job at Un
ion. He is planning to travel to Latin
America early next year to set up a
student and faculty exchange between
semenaires there and Union.
His wife, Sydney, will be working
with him on the ecumenics program,
and will also be exploring alternative
ways of working and job patterns.
A major part of the reason for
Brown's leaving was a yearning to re
turn to seminary involvement, which
he began this year by teaching hall
time at Berkeley's Pacific School of Re
ligion.
Irish catalyst
But the catalyst in his decision oc
cured last year when a fellow member
ol the religious studies faculty known
for his outstanding teaching abiitv.
Jerry Irish, was denied tenure.

Brown is also known for his excel
lent teaching and diverse subjects.
This past quarter he taught courses on
Liberation Theology, a recent religious
movement developed in Latin
America, and on Elie YViesel, a Jewish
survivor of Auschwitz who writes on
post-1 folocaust morality.
Brown cites the Wiesel course as an
example of one which can't help but
"engage people at a much more basic
level than just intellectual. Anyone
who takes a religion course might be
changed." he added.
Wiesel course
Brown will be teaching a course on
Wiesel at Union in the fall, and hopes
to pursue a dialogue with the Jewish
community, particularly persons at
the Jewish Theological Seminary ac
ross the street from Union.
Brown also said that he hopes to be
come involved in the Protestant-
Catholic. an interest of his which dates
back to 1952 when he campaigned for

Eugene McCarthy, before most people
knew who McCarthy was.
Dean of Chapel Robert Hamerton-
Kelly selected Brown to speak at this
year's baccalaureate.
Hamerton-Kelly explained that the
service is a "recognition of the
spiritual opportunities and obliga
tions that education opens up to us.
"Education is more than learning a
number of skills and storing knowlege
and insight into one's culture," he
sta ted.
The service allows persons to "reaf
firm one's sense of intangible good
that is part of genuine civilization."
Recently awarded the B'nai Brith
Palo Alto chapter's Man of the Year
Award. Hamerton-Kelly said that
"baccalaureate is an oportunity for
those who want to affirm gratitude to
the source of that good and an inten
tion to serve fellow human beings."
Hamerton-Kelly praised Brown, as a
"fine example" of the kind of person
who fulfills these roles.
