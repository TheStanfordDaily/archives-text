## 
### Bruce Kadden 
Robert McAfee Urown will be
preaching his last sermon .it Stanford.
Saturday afternoon at 2::H) in Memo
rial Church during the traditional bac
calaureate service prior to graduation.
The religious studies professor, an
ordained Presbyterian minister who
served as Acting Dean of Chapel in
1*172-197,'! is ending a 14-year stint
here to return to New York's Union
Theological Seminary to become Pro
fessor of Ecumenics and World Christ
ianity.
Mrown will be speaking about "The
Need for Passion." which he believes
will be a crucial issue "on the
academic scene in the next few years."
At universities there! is a "need to be;
engaged in the truth one investigates
and not simply a matter of impersonal
research." Urown said, admitting that
many persons here do not agree with
him.
Put Brown is used to being a con
troversial figure, dating back to his in
volvement in the civil rights move
ment and anti-Vietnam War activism.
In fact, when the Board of Trustees
was approving his appointment here
as a full professor. Brown, unknown to
its members, was in a Mississippi jiiil
coll for participating in a civil rights
demonstration.
"I try to make a preaching/teaching
distinction," he explains. They are
"interrelated for me. but I can't de

m;i in I thiit t he students bring into class
wh.it they would bring into a chapel."
Teaching, doing
Sometimes, though, teaching and
doing become interrelated. In 19f>5 ra
cial tensions were building in Selma.
as Brown prepared to lecture on race
relations in his Christian Ethics
course.
Brown immediately went to Selma
to gain a deeper insight into the issue,
which he believes allowed him to have
a better impact on the students.
Urown has had more than his share
of trips from which to bring back first
hand information, the most notable

probably being when he was a Protes
tant observer at Vatican. II.
More recently. Brown traveled to
Southeast Asia, visiting Phnom Penh
two weeks before the capital city of
Cambodia fell to to Khmer Rouge.
On that some trip he was scheduled
to travel with other clergy to South
Vietnam, but was denied a visa to enter
the country, undoubtedly because of
his anti-war activity in the states.
In Nairobi
Last fall Brown gave the keynote ad
dress at t he World Council of Churches
meeting in Nairobi. Africa.
