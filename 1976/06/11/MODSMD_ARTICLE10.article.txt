# Financing for graduate study available, but difficult to get
## 
### Kit Warfield 
The pamphlet on financing graduate
study distributed by the Stanford
Graduate Awards office assures the
single graduate student that "a modest
individual budget . . for three quar
ters of study" will be over $»ilBo.
Furthermore, it explains applying for
graduate aid involves filing a
GAPSFAS form in three parts includ
ing a statement of individual and
parents' financial resources.
In addition the graduate aids office
informs the prospective graduate that
the "Bay Area is seventh highest
among 42 metropolitan area for cost of
living" and of course "it is recognized
that few students will be supported in
the style which they might find desir
able."
Aid conditions at other graduate
schools are much the same but don't be
discouraged. A high percentage of
graduate students at Stanford and
other schools hold fellowships won in
national competition from outside
agencies such as the National Science
Foundation or the Danforth Founda
tion. Many states also provide finan
cial aid for graduates, such as the
California StateGraduateFellowships.
'Money lying around*
Lora Caldwell, an information ser
vice coordinator in the Academic In
formation Center, is very encouraging
about graduate aid. Although finding
money "definitely isn't easy,"
Caldwell says that "there's money just
lying around. The trick is to be perse
verent enough to spend a few hours
going through all the materials and
finding out what part of it you are elig
ible for."
Caldwell points out two full shelves
of particularly useful books and
brochures outlining practically any
fellowship or assistantship a
graduatestudent cares to apply for.
The first digest she recommends is
the Annual Register of Grant Support,

which has four extensive indexes, —
one can look up subjects, organiza
tions and programs, geographic areas
and personnel.
"No matter what kind of fellowship
you've heard about, or what graduate
aids officer you know, this book will
have it indexed," says Caldwell.
CRIS lists fellowships
The Center for Research in Interna
tional Studies (CRIS) on campus lists
over 100 fellowships available
throughout the United States and the
world. Everything from the well
known Rhodes, Fulbright-Hays and
Marshall Fellowships to the American
School of Classical Studies in Athens
grant and grants for study in Western
Europe, Brazil, India and East Asia are
there to be applied for.
Women, as well as minorities have
quite a few fellowships available. The
Rhodes Scholarship Trust has just
been opened to women, and there are
the Danforth Fellowships for Women
to be used toward teaching careers.
The Woodrow Wilson Interna
tional Center for Scholars sponsors fel
lowships for women, which are
granted "to encourage original and
significant contributions to the body of
knowledge concerning women. Em
phasis of the program is on topics of
women's role in society and particu
larly contemporary America."
Black, chicanoand native American
minorities are provided the opportun
ity for special fellowships at the major
ity of graduate schools in the country.
Widespread minority grants-in-aid in
clude Graduate Fellowships in Busi
ness Administration for Minorities,
American Indian Scholarships, Inc..
and National Medical Fellowships for
Minority Group Students.
If you are still discouraged, go to the
Academic Information Center on the
third floor of Old Union and read Mak
ing It: A Guide to Student Finances,
and Grants: How to find out about
them and what to do next.
