Undergraduates at Stanford looking to business
related careers are flocking to the economics de
, irtment to increase their chances of being hired,
according to D. L. Wormlev. assistant director of
liberal arts career advising at the Career Planning
and Placement Center (CPPC).
"Economics is by far the most popular major of
students looking for positions in business."
Wormley said, "but it is not a necessity to major in
economics in order to get a good job." Interviewers
jok for a good balance of classes." she explained.
One girl majored in art history and now she has a
job with First National Bank in New York. "But."
Wormley added, "she took plenty of classes in
economics, statistics and computer science."
Five years ago students were not as interested in
business. Students nowadays are aware of the many
options offered by jobs in business. Wormley
xplained that one reason for the popularity of bus
iness is that "companies can identify jobs six to
seven months in advance and contact us about
them."
The CPPC helps graduating seniors attain paid
jobs in management training programs with retail
ing companies, banking firms, grain industries, in
surance companies and technical firms. "About
ne-third of the students we counsel seek training
positions before they enter business school." she
said, "and another one-third of the students are
thinking about business school but would also like
to work first."
Wormley stresses that extracurricular activities,
summer jobs related to business fields of interest
and volunteering are most important to interview
rs. "Knowing where you are headed is very impor
tant." she said. She explained that a student need
not know where he or she wants to be in 10 years,
but that it is a good idea to be aware of what one
wants to do within three or four years after gradua
tion.
Mary Toman, class of '76, Bradley Jones, class of
'76 and Janet Swanherg. class of '75 all know what

they want to do. Toman says that she has been
planning on entering business since she came to
Stanford. She graduates this June with a bachelor of
arts degree in economics. Although she was ac
cepted to Harvard Business School for next fall.
Toman has decided to wait two years and work for
Bain and Co.. a management consulting firm in
Boston.
While she was at Stanford, she was a member of
the ASSU Senate for one year. "My work in the
senate helped me see people come to compromises
and 1 used the experience to learn about financial
operations." she said. She attributes the three uni
versity committees on which she served as valuable
learning experiences also.
With her involvement with the University Lib
rary Committee, she observed a lot of budgeting
and figuring. "I saw how much money was in
volved and where all the money goes," she said.
"When I worked on the Tresidder Student Union
committee as a freshman. 1 had the opportunity to
see how Tresidder was able to get out of a deficit. I
had a chance to look at cost deficits and manage
ment." she said.
Toman planned her summer jobs to give her ex
perience for future positions. Last summer she was
an intern at Standard Oil of California in manage
ment training. Her other experiences include work
ing in retailing at The Broadway and working in
marketing at Asdic Arena, a bathing-suit manufac
turer.
Bradley Jones will attend Stanford's Graduate
School of Business in the fall after graduating in
June with a bachelor of arts degree in economics. "I
feel that I'm ready for graduate school now," he
said.
Jones said that he is open-minded about what
area of business to enter. "I'm interested in going
into either management consulting or finance." he
said, "but I'll wait until after next year to decide."
While at Stanford and majoring in communica
tion. Janet Swanberg took many different classes.
She said that the computer science class she took

was essential in getting her an initial job with Na
tional Information Systems. She began as a techni
cal writer writing a manual in computer language
before being promoted to manager of publications.
Her job has sent her on business trips to Arkansas,
New York and Boston.
"I haven't dedicated my life to one narrow goal,"
she emphasized. She says that she has done many
different things which have directed her to many
goals. Swanberg went to Germany with the Stan
ford Overseas program and she worked there one
summer. She was also a travelling salesman for
Vick's Chemical Co. one summer and another
summer she taught organ. Swanberg added that in
the future she might attend business school.
Current Stanford students who are planning bus
iness careers will find that many of their predeces
sors have made it to the top. Stanford alumni domi
nate many top executive positions in businesses
such as, Union Bank. Standard Oil of Calif., Levi-
Strauss and Co., American Express, Times-Mirror
Co., Pacific Telephone, VVente Bros. Winery,
TransamericaCorp. and Jantzen Inc., to namea few.
William Hewlett and David Packard, co-founders
of the multi-million dollar Hewlett-Packard Co.

of the Los Angeles Times also went to Stanford.
Successful alumni have entered the business
world directly after gaining an undergraduate de
gree or after having completed other degrees. Some
have walked into family businesses.
Robert Roth, who graduated in 1944, went right
to work for Jantzen Inc. In 1968. he was elected
president and chief executive officer. Jack Heidt is
currently president of Union Bank inCalifornia. He
