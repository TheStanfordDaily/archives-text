# Minorities, women have better chance

### Laura Coverson 
An article appearing in a recent issue of a national magazine proclaimed the
scarcity of johs for the class of 1976 in general. However, it held some hope for
minorities. Time stated: "Industry is eager to employ women and blacks.
Companies canvassed by Frank Endicott. retired placement director of North
western University, intend to hire 45 percent moregraudates from both groups
than they did last year."
What are the real job possibilities for minorities and the women of the class of
'76? What are the practical implications of any type of affirmative action
program? D.L. Wormley. assistant to the director of Liberal Arts Placement, at
Stanford's Career Planning and Placement Center (CPPC). offered her insights.
Wormley expressed concern over the tact that minority students essentially
do not use the placement center. In fact about a "handful" currently use the
CP PC's facilities. Wormley noted that a number of career workshops have been
offered to chicano and black students, but they are virtually unattended.

Affirmative Action programs have in
creased desire for women and minorities
among businesses and also percen
tages of those employed. One recruiting
officer stated that of the 30,000
employes, 45 percent are women and 20
percent minorities.

Further.she expressed concern about minorities becoming hooked into the
pre-professional arena as soon as. if not before, they reach Stanford. Wormlev
added that she would like to see more minorities investigating alternatives to
graduate and professional schools . . . before they receive their rejection
notices.
Last year an Asian-American male who was rejected from medical school
came to the CPPC asking "What will I do?" After exploring the student's
interests, work experiences, and skills, he and a counselor pulled together a
resume. The student was a human biology major with a strong research
background. After a significant letter and telephone campaign, in search of
employment, the young man was placed. He is currently employed with an
engineering firm, researching the fluid dynamics of blood.
Wormley noted that for the entire placement year, beginning September 1.
there were no more than 12 minorities signed upon the liberal arts or engineer
ing interview lists.
She cites the availability of internship programs (e.g. summer employment
programs in busineses and technology) and the recruitment of minorities
through pre-professional student organizations, as usurping the role ot the
CPPC in minority job placement.
One black woman, a senior who did use the services of the CPPC, came out
very well. A political science major, she was interested in para-legal work.
After two interviews set up by the placement center, she was offered two
positions within a week.
On the subject of women. Wormley is optimistic. "Business and industry are
interested in women . . . especially Stanford women." she notes. There are. she
claims, 15-20 percent more Stanford women than males registered with the
liberal arts division of the CPPC. "Overall." states Wormley, "Stanford women
seem more interested in business, which makes sense, given the current
economic situation in this country."
Wormley sees the positive turnout of women as reflective of the national
increases in women desiring work. "It is possible," she adds, "that fewer
women are going the graduate school or pre-professional route, directly after
their undergraduate educations."
Wormley scoffed at the notion that minorities — especially black women —
have it made. "It's a myth to some degree," she said. "Sure, business and
industry are eager to have minorities and women. The question is, however,
once you get your foot in the door, the rest can be fairly unpredictable."
She proceeded, pointing out important questions, such as: What are the real
possibilities for promotion once inside a firm? What will be your relationship
to supervisors and other employes? Answers to these sorts of questions usu
ally cannot be anticipated simply because a company has an affirmative action
policy- Wormley noted that companies who have minorities doing the recruit
ment are more likely to be sincere in a committment to hiring qualified
minorities.

Rumor has it that both minorities and
women 'have it made' in the job market.
Is that really true? Only partially, accord
ing to industry and placement center
sources.

The recruiting officer in charge of minority and women for a local electronics
firm, said that of the 30.000 employes about 45 percent are women, primarily
employed in clerical or production line work; and about 20 percent were
minorities working mainly in clerical, maintenance or production line
capacities.
The goal of what is termed "affirmative action policy," is to increase the
number of qualified minorities and women in the professional and managerial
levels of the company. The biggest disparity, noted this spokesman, is between
this goal and reality.
To encourage the interest of minorities and women, the company offers a
variety of employment opportunities. There are summer programs for training
and employing minorities, as well as "co-op" programs of alternate work and
study.
He noted that minorities seldom use the services of a placement center. In
fact, recruitment officers will often bypass placement offices and go directly to
student organizations. Such groups as the Society of Women Engineers, or
various pre-professional groups for minorities are sources of qualified human
capital.
He stated that minorities are very concerned about upward mobility in a job.
"A minority candidate," he noted, "is usually not too excited about being
placed in a small arm of a firm out in the boonies." Industry has to establish
credibility in relation to minorities; sincere efforts and committments must be
made to get minorities and women in positions of advancement, he said.

What are the real job possibilities for minorities and the women of the class of
'76? What are the practical implications of any type of affirmative action
program? D.L. Wormley. assistant to the director of Liberal Arts Placement, at
Stanford's Career Planning and Placement Center (CPPC). offered her insights.
Wormley expressed concern over the tact that minority students essentially
do not use the placement center. In fact about a "handful" currently use the
CP PC's facilities. Wormley noted that a number of career workshops have been
offered to chicano and black students, but they are virtually unattended.

Affirmative Action programs have in
creased desire for women and minorities
among businesses and also percen
tages of those employed. One recruiting
officer stated that of the 30,000
employes, 45 percent are women and 20
percent minorities.

Further.she expressed concern about minorities becoming hooked into the
pre-professional arena as soon as. if not before, they reach Stanford. Wormlev
added that she would like to see more minorities investigating alternatives to
graduate and professional schools . . . before they receive their rejection
notices.
Last year an Asian-American male who was rejected from medical school
came to the CPPC asking "What will I do?" After exploring the student's
interests, work experiences, and skills, he and a counselor pulled together a
resume. The student was a human biology major with a strong research
background. After a significant letter and telephone campaign, in search of
employment, the young man was placed. He is currently employed with an
engineering firm, researching the fluid dynamics of blood.
Wormley noted that for the entire placement year, beginning September 1.
there were no more than 12 minorities signed upon the liberal arts or engineer
ing interview lists.
She cites the availability of internship programs (e.g. summer employment
programs in busineses and technology) and the recruitment of minorities
through pre-professional student organizations, as usurping the role ot the
CPPC in minority job placement.
One black woman, a senior who did use the services of the CPPC, came out
very well. A political science major, she was interested in para-legal work.
After two interviews set up by the placement center, she was offered two
positions within a week.
On the subject of women. Wormley is optimistic. "Business and industry are
interested in women . . . especially Stanford women." she notes. There are. she
claims, 15-20 percent more Stanford women than males registered with the
liberal arts division of the CPPC. "Overall." states Wormley, "Stanford women
seem more interested in business, which makes sense, given the current
economic situation in this country."
Wormley sees the positive turnout of women as reflective of the national
increases in women desiring work. "It is possible," she adds, "that fewer
women are going the graduate school or pre-professional route, directly after
their undergraduate educations."
Wormley scoffed at the notion that minorities — especially black women —
have it made. "It's a myth to some degree," she said. "Sure, business and
industry are eager to have minorities and women. The question is, however,
once you get your foot in the door, the rest can be fairly unpredictable."
She proceeded, pointing out important questions, such as: What are the real
possibilities for promotion once inside a firm? What will be your relationship
to supervisors and other employes? Answers to these sorts of questions usu
ally cannot be anticipated simply because a company has an affirmative action
policy- Wormley noted that companies who have minorities doing the recruit
ment are more likely to be sincere in a committment to hiring qualified
minorities.

Rumor has it that both minorities and
women 'have it made' in the job market.
Is that really true? Only partially, accord
ing to industry and placement center
sources.

The recruiting officer in charge of minority and women for a local electronics
firm, said that of the 30.000 employes about 45 percent are women, primarily
employed in clerical or production line work; and about 20 percent were
minorities working mainly in clerical, maintenance or production line
capacities.
The goal of what is termed "affirmative action policy," is to increase the
number of qualified minorities and women in the professional and managerial
levels of the company. The biggest disparity, noted this spokesman, is between
this goal and reality.
To encourage the interest of minorities and women, the company offers a
variety of employment opportunities. There are summer programs for training
and employing minorities, as well as "co-op" programs of alternate work and
study.
He noted that minorities seldom use the services of a placement center. In
fact, recruitment officers will often bypass placement offices and go directly to
student organizations. Such groups as the Society of Women Engineers, or
various pre-professional groups for minorities are sources of qualified human
capital.
He stated that minorities are very concerned about upward mobility in a job.
"A minority candidate," he noted, "is usually not too excited about being
placed in a small arm of a firm out in the boonies." Industry has to establish
credibility in relation to minorities; sincere efforts and committments must be
made to get minorities and women in positions of advancement, he said.
An article appearing in a recent issue of a national magazine proclaimed the
scarcity of johs for the class of 1976 in general. However, it held some hope for
minorities. Time stated: "Industry is eager to employ women and blacks.
Companies canvassed by Frank Endicott. retired placement director of North
western University, intend to hire 45 percent moregraudates from both groups

do not use the placement center. In fact about a "handful" currently use the
CP PC's facilities. Wormley noted that a number of career workshops have been
offered to chicano and black students, but they are virtually unattended.

Affirmative Action programs have in
creased desire for women and minorities
among businesses and also percen
tages of those employed. One recruiting
officer stated that of the 30,000
employes, 45 percent are women and 20
percent minorities.

Further.she expressed concern about minorities becoming hooked into the
pre-professional arena as soon as. if not before, they reach Stanford. Wormlev
added that she would like to see more minorities investigating alternatives to
graduate and professional schools . . . before they receive their rejection
notices.
Last year an Asian-American male who was rejected from medical school
came to the CPPC asking "What will I do?" After exploring the student's
interests, work experiences, and skills, he and a counselor pulled together a
resume. The student was a human biology major with a strong research
background. After a significant letter and telephone campaign, in search of
employment, the young man was placed. He is currently employed with an
engineering firm, researching the fluid dynamics of blood.
Wormley noted that for the entire placement year, beginning September 1.
there were no more than 12 minorities signed upon the liberal arts or engineer
ing interview lists.
She cites the availability of internship programs (e.g. summer employment
programs in busineses and technology) and the recruitment of minorities
through pre-professional student organizations, as usurping the role ot the
CPPC in minority job placement.
One black woman, a senior who did use the services of the CPPC, came out
very well. A political science major, she was interested in para-legal work.
After two interviews set up by the placement center, she was offered two
positions within a week.
On the subject of women. Wormley is optimistic. "Business and industry are
interested in women . . . especially Stanford women." she notes. There are. she
claims, 15-20 percent more Stanford women than males registered with the
liberal arts division of the CPPC. "Overall." states Wormley, "Stanford women
seem more interested in business, which makes sense, given the current
economic situation in this country."
Wormley sees the positive turnout of women as reflective of the national
increases in women desiring work. "It is possible," she adds, "that fewer
women are going the graduate school or pre-professional route, directly after
their undergraduate educations."
Wormley scoffed at the notion that minorities — especially black women —
have it made. "It's a myth to some degree," she said. "Sure, business and
industry are eager to have minorities and women. The question is, however,
once you get your foot in the door, the rest can be fairly unpredictable."
She proceeded, pointing out important questions, such as: What are the real
possibilities for promotion once inside a firm? What will be your relationship
to supervisors and other employes? Answers to these sorts of questions usu
ally cannot be anticipated simply because a company has an affirmative action
policy- Wormley noted that companies who have minorities doing the recruit
ment are more likely to be sincere in a committment to hiring qualified
minorities.

Rumor has it that both minorities and
women 'have it made' in the job market.
Is that really true? Only partially, accord
ing to industry and placement center
sources.

The recruiting officer in charge of minority and women for a local electronics
firm, said that of the 30.000 employes about 45 percent are women, primarily
employed in clerical or production line work; and about 20 percent were
minorities working mainly in clerical, maintenance or production line
capacities.
The goal of what is termed "affirmative action policy," is to increase the
number of qualified minorities and women in the professional and managerial
levels of the company. The biggest disparity, noted this spokesman, is between
this goal and reality.
To encourage the interest of minorities and women, the company offers a
variety of employment opportunities. There are summer programs for training
and employing minorities, as well as "co-op" programs of alternate work and
study.
He noted that minorities seldom use the services of a placement center. In
fact, recruitment officers will often bypass placement offices and go directly to
student organizations. Such groups as the Society of Women Engineers, or
various pre-professional groups for minorities are sources of qualified human
capital.
He stated that minorities are very concerned about upward mobility in a job.
"A minority candidate," he noted, "is usually not too excited about being
placed in a small arm of a firm out in the boonies." Industry has to establish
credibility in relation to minorities; sincere efforts and committments must be
made to get minorities and women in positions of advancement, he said.
