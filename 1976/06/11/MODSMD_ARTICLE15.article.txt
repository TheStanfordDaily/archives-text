In the University's earlier
years, the mood was cheery, in
nocent and hopeful. In 1901. tor
example, the biggest concern ot
commencement week seemed to
be keeping the electric lights
going until 2:HO a.m. "so there
will be no possibility ot not
completing the entire program"
of tilt; social event of the week.
Senior Ball.
Those were the days when
hard work still got one places
and C.M. Richardson gave
graduates a Yew words on "The
(lospel of Work."
The Class of 06. knocked a bit
off course by an earthquake,
picked up the pieces in time to
hold a somewhat belated cere
mony on Sept. 15.
Tradition was held firmly in
line, although the class presi
dent attempted an innovation:
getting the faculty to appear in
caps and gowns.
The request was rejected; the
Committee on Public Exercises
said it considered the time "in
auspicious for such an action on

the part of the faculty." The
graduates did appear in caps and
gowns, however.
By 1917 there was a war going
on and the graduating class was
very much aware of it.
War Class
They called themselves "The
War Class" and the cover of the
commencement edition of The
Daily Palo Alto (predecessor of
The Stanford Daily) showed a
row ot uniformed young men
standing at attention next to the
U.S. flag.
Class orator W. Leslie Miller,
speaking on "The College Man
and the War." urged fellow
classmates to serve the nation.
The class will, written bv A.M.
Emery, left "to all the generation
of Stanford students who are.to
come . . . the example of service
to the nation in time of need. . .
"The memory of the im
mediate response to the gov
ernment's call . . . is an evidence
of the value of that stirring inde
finablethi ng which we call Stan
ford Spirit."
Military training
The Class of '17 also left "the
institution of Stanford military
training . . . for the benefit of
those who are to follow. We hope
and indeed know that they will

take full advantage of its benefits
and that they will be better Staiv
ford men and better citizens
therefore."
The commencement address,
delivered by Dr. John Maxson
Stillman. the retiring vice presi
dent of the University, discussed
"Idealism and National Policy."
The "brightest hope for the
near future." according to
Stillman. was the establishment
of a world court "which shall
unite the nations in an agree
ment that shall make forever im
possible such a catastrophe as
we now experience."
However, he warned, "we
should not forget that the world
has many opportunities to
realize the devastations ot
war. . . Nor should we forget that
history teaches that the horrors
of war are soon forgotten by suc
ceeding generations, while the
glory of victory and rancor of de
feat appeal all too powerfully to
the imagination of men. . .."
Maintain ideals
During the war and after, "it is
our duty to maintain our high
ideals. . . . Success must not
tempt us to grasp for imperial
prizes." he cautioned.
"Always we must strive to
bring nearer those Utopias lor

which the world of humanity
ever yearns, and always should
we cherish those dreamers of
great dreams whose visions
foreshadow the better times to
come."
When the United States began
to feel the Great Depression,
some may have douted that "bet
ter times" would ever come. The
Class of 'HO. however, made no
mention of the hard times.
President Herbert Hoover took
time out from his respon
sibilities. "Forgetting the prop
osed new Tariff Hill which lies
on his desk, the ardent pleas of
prohibitionists and anti
probhitionists and even the call
of the trout in the Kapidan
Kiver." he wired "cordial greet
ings and warm congratulations
to the graduating Seniors at
Stanford University and my best
wishes for a life of active service
upon which they now embark."
Secretary Wilbur
The class was also honored
with a special greeting from Sec
retary of the Interior Ray Lyman
Wilbur, president of the Univer
sity.
"We hope that you will always
carry with you sweet memories
of the charm of the Stanford


JUNIOR BIRDM AN?—This senior of the class of 1!J71 looks better prepared than some
to face the "real world" out there ready to devour graduates. Rumor has it that he was hoping lor a
spot on the "Howdy Doodv Show" and was extremely disappointed when he found out it was no
longer being done, ilndaunted. he later garnered a position in the "Mv Me" advertising campaign.
campus. . said Wilbur, who
was detained in Washington.
P.C. by legislative work.
In the spirit of the patriotism
shown by the other "war class."
the ("lass of '42 gave $1900 in
war bonds to the senior scholar
ship fund.
Because the war effort ruled
out the use of brass for the class
plate in front of Memorial
Church, the class had one in ide
of two-color reinforced concrete.
Miller graduated
Among the 1150 persons
graduating was a )ohn Day Mil
ler.executive of A. Schilling Co..
importers of spices and coffee in
San Francisco. Miller was the
only one to receive a Bacehlor of
Arts at Large Degree.
He had left the University in
April 1935. two units short of the
180 required for graduation. Not
having a diploma did not ad
versely effect him until an oppor
tunity to be commissioned as a
lieutenant in the Naval Air Corps
came up and he learned that he
needed a college degree to qual
ify.
So the young executive came
back to the University and was
allowed to prepare a study on
"The Effect of the War on the
Spice Business" for two units.
Another graduate. Martha
Hartwig Tootle, received a u
nique graduation present—the
ripcord from the parachute
which saved her husband's lite
in the Battle of Midwav.

The commencement crowd,
reduced to 5000 by Army regula
tions. was given reasons for
"The Preservation of the Univer
sity" by Monroe Emanuel
Deutsch. vice president and pro
vost of the University of Califor
nia.
"There is great danger that we
may look at all university educa
tion through glasses clouded by
the mist of war." said Deutsch.
"We must take the long look —
and not let the 1042 scene blind
us to the fact th.it there will be a
world after 1042 and 1943."
Deutsch reminded listeners
that the country would need pro
fessionals and scholars in all
fields after the war. "And unless
those who are not summoned to
he immediate service of our na
tion devote themselves to their
training." he said, "we may
enter the postwar era a genera
tion taught hut one thing —
war."
Morale needed
Wilbur (still president at this
point) noted that "military
might does not lie alone in guns
and ships and all that goes with
them, but in the morale and
brain power of a people."
Ile told tlit? ('lass of '42. "You
have one of those great oppor
tunities in human history actu
ally and personally to do some
thing which will determine for
as to come just what kind of life
human beings will have on this
earth. . .
"Associated with the youth of

the United Nations, you are to set
the old human race on better
paths, with more human dignity,
more justice, more freedom and
less prejudice than ever before."
Again, hopes for continued
peace were shattered. The Un
ited States came up with varia
tions on a theme: there was the
('.old War. the Korean War .. .
and the undeclared war in Viet
nam.
War protests
By 1969. antiwar sentiment
was rising. The former speaker
of the student legislature arrived
at commencement exercies in an
academic robe and coolie hat.
Other graduates sported anti-
ABM stickers on robes and mor
tarboards.
There were threats of disrup
tion from the Students for a
Democratic Society group
(which did not materialize).
Contrasts to the earlier "war
classes" continued to appear. In
1970. some 300 of 1500 graduat
ing chose not to rent caps and
gowns for commencement to
show their opposition to the
Vietnam war. The $5 that would
have gone to rental fees went to
peace causes.
Money to charity
Members of the class of '71
continued the effort. Some 200
of tin? 1000 students attending
ceremonies did not rent gowns,
contributing the $r> to groups
such as the Committee of Re
sponsibility. which provided
medical care in the United States
for war-injured children; the
Agape Foundation, the San
Francisco area project for non
violent change; and Draft Re
fuser support, a newly-formed
group aiding men facing prison
terms for refusing the draft.
Although radicals handed out
Black Panther newspapers at the
entrances to the stadium, they
made no effort to enter. There
were no disruptions, as had been
feared. The University had ban
ned carrying signs or banners
into the ceremonies, but one
graduate wore a peace symbol on
bis cap.
The cremonies went smoothly
and some newspapers referred to
1971 as the year of "return to
tradition," or the year in which
"innovation became tradition."
Nevertheless President
Richard Lyman seemed to
acknowledge that the Univer
sity had not been left untouched
by the changing times. Noting
that it is customary for the Uni
versity to wish the departing
graduates well through its pres
ident, commented. "Now one
wonders whether the roles ought
not to be reversed, whether it
ought not to be the departing
graduates who wish the Univer
sity well." His remark drew
laughter and applause.
Sevareid on dissent
CBS commentator and chief
Washington correspondent Eric
Sevareid, the commencment
speaker, also had a few words on
the subject of unrest.
"Dissent is right and proper —
indeed, vital to our life — but it
does not follow that therefore the
more dissent the better." he said.
"It is an eternal error to believe
that a cause considered righte
ous sanctifies unrighteous
methods."
Like the graduating class. Flric
Sevareid, expressed doubts
about the United States' infalli
bility.
"Our political leaders are
learning, "...that America's
reach in the world has exceeded
its grasp; that we can really give
little to other societies that they
can take," he said.


COMMENCEMENT, 1971—Eric Sevareid. a CBS commentator
and chief Washington correspondent, spoke to the graduates of
IH7I on the usefulness of dissent. He also said "what Americans

must find again is their sense of trust. We have to trust others even
those we fear and think may wish us harm. We have, each of us. to
take this risk. That is what built this country — risk and trust."
