At least onceayeartheoutside
world conies to "the Farm." as
families, triends and other
guests gather tor commence
ment exercises.
In the University's earlier
years, the mood was cheery, in
nocent and hopeful. In 1901. tor
example, the biggest concern ot
commencement week seemed to
be keeping the electric lights
going until 2:HO a.m. "so there
will be no possibility ot not
completing the entire program"
of tilt; social event of the week.
Senior Ball.
Those were the days when
hard work still got one places
and C.M. Richardson gave
graduates a Yew words on "The
(lospel of Work."
The Class of 06. knocked a bit
off course by an earthquake,
picked up the pieces in time to
hold a somewhat belated cere
mony on Sept. 15.
Tradition was held firmly in
line, although the class presi
dent attempted an innovation:
getting the faculty to appear in
caps and gowns.
The request was rejected; the
Committee on Public Exercises
said it considered the time "in
auspicious for such an action on

the part of the faculty." The
graduates did appear in caps and
gowns, however.
By 1917 there was a war going
on and the graduating class was
very much aware of it.
War Class
They called themselves "The
War Class" and the cover of the
commencement edition of The
Daily Palo Alto (predecessor of
The Stanford Daily) showed a
row ot uniformed young men
standing at attention next to the
U.S. flag.
Class orator W. Leslie Miller,
speaking on "The College Man
and the War." urged fellow
classmates to serve the nation.
The class will, written bv A.M.
Emery, left "to all the generation
of Stanford students who are.to
come . . . the example of service
to the nation in time of need. . .
"The memory of the im
mediate response to the gov
ernment's call . . . is an evidence
of the value of that stirring inde
finablethi ng which we call Stan
ford Spirit."
Military training
The Class of '17 also left "the
institution of Stanford military
training . . . for the benefit of
those who are to follow. We hope
and indeed know that they will

take full advantage of its benefits
and that they will be better Staiv
ford men and better citizens
therefore."
The commencement address,
delivered by Dr. John Maxson
Stillman. the retiring vice presi
dent of the University, discussed
"Idealism and National Policy."
The "brightest hope for the
near future." according to
Stillman. was the establishment
of a world court "which shall
unite the nations in an agree
ment that shall make forever im
possible such a catastrophe as
we now experience."
However, he warned, "we
should not forget that the world
has many opportunities to
realize the devastations ot
war. . . Nor should we forget that
history teaches that the horrors
of war are soon forgotten by suc
ceeding generations, while the
glory of victory and rancor of de
feat appeal all too powerfully to
the imagination of men. . .."
Maintain ideals
During the war and after, "it is
our duty to maintain our high
ideals. . . . Success must not
tempt us to grasp for imperial
prizes." he cautioned.
"Always we must strive to
bring nearer those Utopias lor

which the world of humanity
ever yearns, and always should
we cherish those dreamers of
great dreams whose visions
foreshadow the better times to
come."
When the United States began
to feel the Great Depression,
some may have douted that "bet
ter times" would ever come. The
Class of 'HO. however, made no
mention of the hard times.
President Herbert Hoover took
time out from his respon
sibilities. "Forgetting the prop
osed new Tariff Hill which lies
on his desk, the ardent pleas of
prohibitionists and anti
probhitionists and even the call
of the trout in the Kapidan
Kiver." he wired "cordial greet
ings and warm congratulations
to the graduating Seniors at
Stanford University and my best
wishes for a life of active service
upon which they now embark."
Secretary Wilbur
The class was also honored
with a special greeting from Sec
retary of the Interior Ray Lyman
Wilbur, president of the Univer
sity.
"We hope that you will always
carry with you sweet memories
of the charm of the Stanford


JUNIOR BIRDM AN?â€”This senior of the class of 1!J71 looks better prepared than some
to face the "real world" out there ready to devour graduates. Rumor has it that he was hoping lor a
spot on the "Howdy Doodv Show" and was extremely disappointed when he found out it was no
longer being done, ilndaunted. he later garnered a position in the "Mv Me" advertising campaign.
