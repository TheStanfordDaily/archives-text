# Wedding bells to ring for many grads
## 
### Kit Warfield 
As the traditional story goes, a
man and woman who were en
gaged in college met when he
was a junior and shea freshman,
,md thev were married soon after
his graduation. Normally at that
poi nt thi! woman quit school and
either went to work to put her
husband through graduate
school, or immediately became a
loving and industrious house
wife and mother.

There came a time in the 70s,
what with the liberation of
women and such, that women
dropping out to marry a frater
nity man they met at college, or
even marrying at all, was
thought among some young col
lege women to be definitely out
of style.
Times have indeed changed,
but not as drastically as some
would have us believe. At Stan
ford, at least 20 graduates of the

Class of' 76 will marry — or have
married in the last few weeks —
someone they got to know at
Stanford. Many more plan to
marry someone they met in the
Stanford area or at home, soon
after graduation.
Marry soon
Why have these couples cho
sen to marry within a few
months of graduation rather
than a year or two before — as
some 50 have in the last two
years — or after completing
graduate school?
The common answer, "Why
wait any longer?", was
supplemented by very practical
considerations. Karen Walz,
who met her fiance Kris in Santa
Clara, wanted to finish her
schooling first. After that. "I
didn't see any point in waiting
any longer."
Eleanor Campbell said that
marriage to Russell Ritter, who

has one more year at Stanford,
made the most sense for them in
August. She says the two of them
plan to go into the Peace Corps
after Hitter's graduation next
June, and"the Peace Corps re
quires you to be married at least
six months before you enter."
European basketball
Basketball player Tim Patter
son had another good reason for
marrying Ruth Bromiley, who
just completed the Stanford
Teacher Education Program
(STEP) after graduating two
years ago. Tim says he plans to
seek out basketball teams in
Europe, and if he and Bromiley
marry in July they can go to the
Continent together to live if he
gets a job there.
These couples' situations il
lustrate another striking differ
ence in the traditional course of
engagement and marriage. In at
least ten cases this year, the

woman had already graduated,
and her future husband will re
ceive his degree Sunday.
Carol Celum. who graduated
last year, and Kim Anderson,
Class of '76, will marry in Au
gust. This makes sense, Ander
son says, because he and Celum
"still havea million things to do,
and a marriage in June would
have been too rushed." August is
also good for them because An
derson will enter Scribe School
at the Peninsula Bible Church in
the fall.
Ted McCluskey, who married
senior Katie Henry three weeks
ago, is already going to the same
Scribe School as Anderson.
Seminary students
Mac Taylor will also go to
seminary, but not until after his
fiance Debbie, a junior, has
graduated. He says they want to
be married in August for a sim
ple reason — he "wants to start

his life with her now." Other
wise, he says."I would have
begun seminary training this
fall, and we would have been
apart for a year. This way. we can
both go to seminary at the same
time, and it will work out much
better."
Erica Williams and Stephen
Lawry, who met in the campus
Christian group Seminar 70, will
also attend seminary together
next year, and she will join him
in the teaching/counseling job
he has with the campus minis
try.
The trend toward women at
tending graduate school with
their husbands or fiances appears
to be strong.
Jeff Ogden and Susie Malouf.
both graduating Sunday, are en
gaged to be married next June.
She will enter Northwestern
University's master's program in
drama, while Jeff either works in
the Chicago area or attends
Northwestern Business School.
Ogden and Malouf began dat
ing during sophomore year. A
majority of the other couples to
be married also began going to
gether that year. Harb Hoey and
Mike Nelson, whose wedding is
next Monday, began going out
after he saw her in a Junipero
Mouse play. L'il A brier. They
will be living in Mountain View.
Hoey will work at Intel Corpora
tion, and Mike Nelson for Union
Bank in San Francisco. After a
few years they plan to apply to
the same business school.
A number of those to be mar
ried this summer were high
school sweethearts, or met in
their home towns.
Oeorge McMillan met his
fiance in their home town of Sac
ramento, while he and Janna
were in high school. She will
work in Boston to help put her
husband through Harvard Law
school after they are married in
July.
