# Alumni Association promoting support for University, activities

### 
"Alumni associations" tend to
he stereotyped «is organizations
of sentimental old grads whose
interest in their alma maters is
confined to their football teams
and to periodic class reunions.
Most stereotypes are distortions
— and this is a particularly dis
torted description of the Stan
lord alumni association.
The purposes of the indepen
dent Alumni Association, to
quote its articles of incorpora
tion. are "to promote the in
terests of Stanford University
and to establish and maintain a
mutually beneficial relationship
between the University and its
alumni."
The Association promotes
Stanford's interests by offering
the alumni a variety of reward
ing ways to become involved
with the University. Hopefully,
such involvement leads to a con
tinuing sense of identification
with the institution, and. ulti
mately. to increased support —

financial and otherwise — for
St inford. While the Association
is not directly involved in fund
raisi ng. it supports and applauds
the efforts of the Development
Office and of the thousands of
alumni volunteer workers who
are.
Not only money
Nonetheless, the University
cannot approach the alumni sol
ely wih a collection plate. Those
who have attended Stanford in
the past must be kept abreast of
the exciting new developments
on campus, and — more impor
tant — must have opportunities
to partake of the stimulating in
tellectual and social substance of
the present-day University.
This is where the Alumni As
sociation comes in. It offers an
impressive array of publications
(the handsome Stanford
Magazine, the award-winning
Portable Stanford reading series,
the Alumni Almanac); superb
recreational faci Ii ties all he Stan

undergone significant changes,

these difficult times.
Consequently, the Association
has increased markedly its edu
cational offerings. Naturally, it
draws principally on Stanford's
distinguished faculty, which has
evidenced an extraordinary wil

to alumni. This movement is
evident, not merely in more and
more varied alumni "colleges."

in the publications program, as
