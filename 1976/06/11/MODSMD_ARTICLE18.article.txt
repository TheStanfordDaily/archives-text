# Star football players find problems in pros
## 
### Jill Lieber 
Stanford athletes are of a diffe
rent breed. At a school more
known for academics than athle
tics. its athletes, from recruits to
graduating seniors, want the
total Stanford experience —
good education, a lively social
lite and participation on a team
that can withstand the pressure
of the competitive Pacific Eight
Conference.
Fred Hargadon. dean of ad
missions. has said Stanford does
not admit people who won't be
able to handle the academics
here. The high school grade
point average of recruited
athletes is about 3.0 and SAT
scores total close to 1100.
Many older athletes maintain
a B average while at Stanford.
Their sights are on busi ness. law
or medical schools. Yet there are
athletes at Stanford who excel in
their respective sport and pass
up the challenge of further edu
cation. They are those drafted by
professional teams.
Rowen Cut
Keith Rowen and Fete
Lazetich are Stanford alumns —
both political science majors —
who were drafted into the pro
football ranks. Rowen. an offen
sive lineman who played for
Stanford from 1970-74. was the
fourth pick of the Philadelphia
Eagles last year. He was one of
the last rookies cut from the
squad before the pro season
started.
Lazetich, a member of the de
fensive line from 1967-71, was
drafted by the San Diego Char
gers in 1971 and played with
them for three years. He was
traded to the Miami Dolphins
and cut. Last season he played
for the British Columbia Lions.
"Initially I thought 'this is
going to be great — right out of
college and you don't have to
hustle right away and settle
down with a job and get trapped
in it.' But in football you get in
volved inthegameand it doesn't
seem likeyou'regoinganywhere
— especially from Stanford.
Most of my friends are finishing
up law school. I'm getting to the
end of my career and I can see
them just starting out," Lazetich
said.
Rowen said the Eagles asked
him to try out again this summer,
but he told them he would rather
begin the Secondary Teaching

Education Program (STEP) at
Stanford in June.
"When 1 went into it (rookie
camp) 1 said. I'm going to give
everything I have and that's
going to be it.' 1 just have too
many other things I'd like to do."
he said.
Football factory?
"And I think that's something
that separates a Stanford person
from one at a football factory
type of institution. You will find
more guys at other institutions
who will keep on playing and
trying out because that's all they
art? qualified to do. The Stanford
guys have so many different
things that even a person like
Jackie Brown (running back on
the 1971 Rose Bowl team) who
was drafted in the seventh round
by t he Oakland Raiders, can turn
it down to go to law school.
"Most people in the sports
world will say. 'That's crazy,
you've got to play.' The Stanford
community can look at it and
say. 'What has more value —
being an attorney or a football
player?' I think there's a better
perspective on life's goals at
Stanford."
Author James A. Michener
said in his book. Sports in
America:"I remember the bit
terness with which one
professional-football scout told
me. 'So help me Cod. I'll never
again draft a football player from
Stanford. You scout 'em. talk
with 'em, keep records on 'em,
and remind yourself that John
Brodie and Jim Plunkett
graduated from Stanford and
made it big. You advise your
team to draft 'em high. But after
you waste a high draft choice on
'em. the Stanford kid suddenly
realizes that he'd be a damned
fool to waste a bunch of years
playing professinal football
when he can move right into a
good firm or profession. We've
drafted three, and didn't get a
damned one of 'em. From now
on, it's Grambling for me. Those
guys need the money. They'll
report.' "
Education first
"Stanford kids are more con
cerned with their future." said
Head Football Coach Jack Chris
tiansen. "Their first desire was to
come to Stanford for the educa
tion, not for pro football. If they
want to play profootball they say
'I think if I go to this school
rather than Stanford I have a bet

ter chance ot going into pro
ball.* "
"The football program here is
based on what is good for the
student athlete." Rowen said.
"It's still a major college football
program and it's also highly
competitive. We had a lot of
players miss spring practice be
cause of classes. In the fall we've
had players miss practices. It's
not uncommon (during the sea
son) to see football players on the
bus on rriday nights, when
we're going to the movies, with
books. They study the night be
fore games."
Lazetich said. "1 always felt
that the other teams kind of
thought we were inferior on the
field just due to the fact that
Stanford was -an intellectual
school. All my life 1 had read
about players that had gone to
Notre Dame or Ohio State — you
never heard too much about
Stanford ball players.
All-star games
"Well. I even felt that same
way until my last year of playing
football when 1 had a chance to
play in some all-star games and
I thought — 'These guys are re
ally going to be something.' Ac
tually when 1 got back there I was
really disappointed. 1 was
amazed at the quality of athletes
we had here at Stanford."
Rowen and Lazetich are
highly motivated men who want
to excel to the utmost in their
fields. Rowen. who will be spe
cial teams coach for the Stanford
football team next year, said that
the ultimate thrill for him will 1m;
to coach the winning team of the
Super Bowl.
Lazetich plans to own a small
ranch in his home state of Mon
tana after he retires from pro
football. He said he will play pro
ball a while longer because there
are still things the game can give
him.
"I've always wanted to score a
touchdown. Hut I guess the
biggest thrill in pro football is
being introduced and going
through the goal posts before the
game. After that it's all down hill
— you just get beaten up."
