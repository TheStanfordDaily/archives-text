# Graduate meets only rebuffs, stone walls in job hunting
## 
### Katherine Rambo 
Although we treated the idea as a
joke, many people in my college
graduating class wanted to bel ieve that
on the day of graduation, employers in
our chosen fields of work would learn
bv osmosis of our entry to the job mar
ket. and appear with offers of fascinat
ing and lucrative careers.
"Recession" and "unemployment"
had been seriously discussed in our
social, economic and political science
classes, but the realities belonged to a
world that most of us had had as yet no
part of.
Several months later I returned and
found that most people who had not
immediately attained law school, med
school or a few other guaranteed posi
tions. were desperately treading water
in a society where bright, ambitious,
qualified college graduates are
cheaper by the dozen.
Spam, powdered milk
A few had succeeded in obtaining
footholds in desired careers, but most
(if they worked at all) existed on sub
sistence incomes, hope, parental char
ity. Spam and powdered milk.
I, too. was unemployed, but not yet
overly concerned. I was confident that
something would turn up.
However, I soon regreted not having
taken advantage of seminars that had
been offered on job-hunting and re
sume writing. Such knowledgeable
advice might have prevented tactical
mistakes made through inexperience
that were costly in terms of time and
opportunities.
But I also realized that seminars and
good advice could never adequately
prepare a person for the frustrating,
debilitating, often humiliating experi
ence of the daily door-to-door search
for work.
Excuses vary
It involves walking in off the street
to a place of business and being
turned out again with a variety of ex
cuses ranging from kind to indifferent
to cruel to contemptuous.
It is a process consisting of three
basic situations.
The first takes only a few minutes. It
involves initial contact with the per
son in charge of personnel and im
mediate rejection on grounds often
obscure and/or confusing to the person
being turned away.
Exhiiiration
The second situation involves initial
contact, and an exhilirating moment

when the applicant finally breaks
through the baliwick of scretarial
myrmidons to secure an interview.
Hut the interview is usually short,
basic and done out of the goodness of
the interviewer's heart.
The company is not hiring because
they are: a) fully staffed, b) in financial
difficulties c) moving the main offices
to Boston. Pittsburg, and/or Clatsop.
New Mexico, or d) all of the above.
The third situation involves initial
contact, interview, favorable response
and rejection days, weeks and occa
sionally months later.
Mangled plans
This situation can mangle a person's
personal plans. Often the jobs most de
sired are the slowest to answer, and
decisions must be made in the interim
on offers of lesser jobs, and whether or
not to stay in the area in case a favora
ble response arrives and must be
answered immediately.
In any situation, days become tedi
ous and virtually identical to one
another. A typical day usually begins
early.
(8:30 a.m.) I have been to this
magazine three times before and have
yet to see the personnel assistant. Hut I
called yesterday and was assured that
she would have time today.
Too busy
The secretary calls the personnel as
sistant to remind her that 1 am here.
She relays a message that the assistant
is too busy today with meetings, but if I
want to leave a phone number she
might call me tomorrow.
In the past three months I have been
here three times, scheduled two inter
views. written one ingratiating letter
and received unlimited encourage
ment to try again sometime.
The receptionist at the next publish
ing house adivses me to wait in the
editor's office: the editor chases me out
to wait in the hall.
Twenty minutes later the editor am
bles out and interviews me in front of
the paste-up and lay-out staff, all of
whom listen intently and make semi
inaudible comments.
Not hiring
But the editor seems to like me and
agrees that I might be useful on the
staff. Unfortunately they aren't hiring
at the moment, so I might try again in a
year or so.
(11:00 a.m.) 1 return to a printing and
graphics company 1 approached once
before. They called again last week

about the possibility of a job in the film
and lay-out department.
They postponed the interview yes
terday without explanation, and toda\
1 am informed that another person was
hired for the job.
Over my third cup of cmfee. an old
memory comes swimming up from the
depths of my mind.
Years ago
Four years ago I traveled to Arizona
to write an independent study paper
on land use and abuse in a town near
Flagstaff.
It was a good paper, and 1 tried sel
ling it to various publications in the
I'hoenK Scottsdale Tempe area.
One publication in Scottsdale was
housed in a small, white, clapboard
one story house, complete with wis
teria hanging from the front porch.
I ambled in through the screen door
and sought out the most official look
ing person in the room.
When 1 finished my pitch, there was
a long silence and she asked "Is it so
cial?"
Exclusive people
She explained patiently that the
magazine was oriented towards .1 very
exclusive set of people, and the
magazine did not accept free-lance
work from people not personally
known to them.
That was my first lesson in job
hunting; know the place and product
you are applying to.
If I had first examined the latest is
sue, 1 would have been warned by a
front cover depicting fat littlegirls rid
ing fat little ponies, with ads in the first
three pages selling yachts, town
houses and private schools for trouble
some children.
(1:00 p.m.) I return to an art gallery
that once advertised for a framing and
gallery sales trainee.
No women
1 had applied and was not hired be
cause the man did not wish to hire
women, who. he said, were not strong
enough to work the frame-cutting
equipment.
1 demonstrated my ability to cut the
frames quite successfully, but 1 still
was not hired. Women, he said, were
not as trustworthy as men in running
an art gallery.
(4:00 p.m.) I finally return home
after being told at one publishing
house that I am under-qualified, and
discouraged from work in a pet store
because I am over-qualified.
