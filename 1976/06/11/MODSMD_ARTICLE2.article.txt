# Seniors donating many small gifts
## 
### Sue King 
A hand-control led golf cart, a spe
cial pulse reader for Children's Hospi
tal and a TV monitor for the Bridge
counseling center are three of the
senior class gifts this year, according
to senior co-president Walt Spevak.
The golf cart will be for "physically
handicapped students who can't use
the foot-operated carts." said Spevak.
The TV monitor is an "immediate
feedback mechanism for counselors at

the Bridge," he added. "It's used in
self-evaluation sessions so people can
see right away how they act in certain
situations." Co-president Marie Fiata
rone said that the gift to Children's
Hospital will be an Abbott monitor,
which measures pulse rates through
plaster casts.
Funds from cap and gown deposit
waivers will be contriuted to Ram's
Head, club sports and solar heating for
deCuerre pools.
Spevak said that there was a "choice
of presenting one large or many smal
ler (gifts). YVe thought it would help
more people if the senior class donated
several gifts."
Fiatarone explained that the officers
"took all the suggestions that were
feasible" from a senior poll held in Ap
ril. The ideas were all researched and
the officers "cut out the ones" that
couldn't be done, such as "planting
grass in the Quad for $20,000."
Money for the gifts comes from cap
and gown deposit waivers, the Senior
Class treasury, and profits from Class
Day activities, senior tee-shirt sales
and graduation announcement sales.
Spevak was critical of Bookstore
workers, who distribute caps and
gowns, saying that those in charge
were making only a "feeble effort" to
inform seniors about the deposit
waiver.
"Eldon Speed, the manager of the
Bookstore, was nice, helpful and
cooperative," said Spevak. But he
added that Jim Virgin who is in charge
of Bookstore merchandise was "not
aiding us as much as we had hoped
regarding cap and gown waivers.
Virgin said that his "main concern is
getting graduates their cap and gown."
