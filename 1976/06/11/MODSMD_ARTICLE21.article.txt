### 
Welcome to the Farm. And
welcome to the Stanford Sum
mer Guide.
This is the first time we've
tried such a publication, and we
hope you enjoy it. Our intention
is to help tin; summer visitors to
Stanford Ijecome familiar with
the campus and the Peninsula in
the short period of time they will
be here.
This is a great place to be dur
ing the summer, and we don't
want you to miss any of the op
portunities. One problem we
had with this guide was trying to
cover the wide variety of in
terests you all have. A very di
verse group of people is reading
this issue, and we've tried to
provide you all with sugges
tions.
This guide is being given to
everyone who is at Stanford for
any sort of workshop, confer
ence, convention or special
school, and that includes
everyone from high school
cheerleaders to successful
businessmen.
Some of the articles are brand
new and others are updated re
prints of Daily stories. By no
means' have we told you every
thing — we've tried to cover the
major attractions. If you've got
time and transportation (and the
"pink section" of the Sunday

Chronicle) go explore on your
own.
Check out the music attrac
tions. Go to the beach. Ride
HART for fun. Take the tour to
Alcatraz Island. Enjoy the
weather (Hope it's sunny while
you're reading this).
For information on campus at
fairs in general, be sure to read
the Summer Daily, which, con
trary to its name, is published
Tuesdays and Fridays during
summer quarter. You can find
stacks of them distributed all
over the University.
(If you'll be here for several
weeks and would like to gain
some valuable journalism ex
perience. be sure to stop by the
Daily offices and volunteer.
Writers, photographers, libel
lawyers: we can use you all.)
Let us also plug the alternate
Stanford mass medium — KZSIJ
radio. V)(). I FM and 881) AM (only
in the dorms). They don't have as
many pretty pictures as we do.
but we play lousy music.
Please let us know how well
we have served you with this is
sue. We just might do this again,
and we would like to know what
needs improvement.
Enjoy your stay.
