						Pictorial Tour of Stanford

### 

Memorial Church, located in
the Inner Quadrangle at the
center of campus, was built in
1903 by Jane Stanford as a
memorial to her husband, be
hind Sr.
It was badly damaged by the
1900 earthquake, and was en
tirely rebuilt with a strengthen-

ing steel skeleton. A large tower
with clocks and chimes that
originally topped the building
was destroyed by the quake and
never replaced.
The church offers Bible
studies, prayer groups, informal
courses, counseling, workshops
and discussions with visiting

preachers and lecturers.
The University Public Wor
ship. given at 11 a.m. each Sun
day is Protestant. A small Com
munion Service convenes at 7 :U()
p.m., except for the first Sunday
of each month, when it is at 1 1
a.m. A Roman Catholic Mass is
held at 4:30 p.m.


Main Library, thecentral library for the
University, was built in 1919. It houses
800,000 volumes in seven levels of
stacks, and an overflow of 480,000 vol
umes is shelved in the basement of
Meyer Library. Main Library's facilities
include a reference room, map collec
tion, government documents library, a

rare book collection and a microtext
reading room.
All faculty, staff and registered stu
dents may use the library; others should
contact the Service Desk, in the Central
Circulation Department of the library for
information on special borrowing
privileges.


Tresidder Memorial Union,
named for Donald Tresidder.
Stanford's fourth president,
serves as a campus service
center. It contains a cafeteria cal
led the Transition (which, at the

age of two is fairly permanent),
the Coffee House, a store, barber
shop. travel agency, pastry shop,
bowling alley, bank, ticket office
and several lounges and art
exhibits.


I loover Tower, the most prom
inent landmark on campus, is
285 feet high. The view from the
top is impressive â€” on a clear
day one can easily see the Hast
Hiiy and occasionally parts of
San Francisco.
The elevator ride to the obser -
vation platform is free to people
associated with Stanford and to
their immediate families. It costs
25 cents for all others.
The building houses the

Hoover Institution on War, Re
volution and Peace, and con
tains the vast uollections begun
by the late President Herbert
Hoover, a Stanford alumnus.
A collection of Hoover
memorabilia and documents is
displayed in two rooms adjoin
ing the lobby at the base of the
tower. The facility is open 10-12
a.m. and 1-4 p.m. Mondays
through Saturdays and 1-4 p.m.
Sundays.


Sorry folks, but Lake Lagunita
doesn't really look like this. At
least not this year. We're print
ing this picture just to prove that
Lake bag does actually exist
sometimes. The photograph was
taken in May of 1975. Right now,
the dry lake-bed bears a strong
resemblance to the world's
largest cross-country roller
skating rink.
