# The 						Flicks: a Stanford tradition since Robert Redford was born
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
Now that you're here, you
should know of our traditions.
One as time-honored as the
Academy Awards is the Sunday
Night Flicks, sponsored by the
ASSU. This ritual has occurred
every Sunday since 1937 (except
for some World War 11 years),
making it as old as Robert Red
ford. Stanford students, along
with an assortment of Palo Alto
high school students, go into
Memorial Auditorium, across
from Hoover Tower, and pretend
to watch the movie.
Often it is no more than an ex
cuse to leave one's studying for a
few hours, and it always re
freshes, making one ready to re
turn to the books — or to the
Frankie& Johnny & LuigiToo
pizza parlor, depending on how
infectious the atmosphere is and
who one runs into.
The Flicks, as they are affec
tionately referred to, were the
brainchild of Oley Kil
lingsworth, who still works here
as the communications super
visor in the Plant Services De
partment. He remembers some
very interesting facts about the
first years of the Flicks, which
should raise some eyebrows,
even among seniors.

Did you know . . . that the
Flicks were originally shown in
the History Corner for a dime?
They are now 75 cents, up from
50 cents last year.
. . . that when enough money
had been collected for the rental
of the quarter's films, admission
wasn't charged? Today the
Flicks are an extremely profita
ble institution upon which
ASSU depends for a hefty chuck
of revenue.
. . . that there wasn't the
choice or variety that we have
now? In the so-called "good old
days," there were many repeats
of the films which were easiest to
get, as well as serials. Those
were the days of block
booking, when if an organization
rented one Paramount film, it
rented only Paramount films,
Thus many independent films
were shown, according to Kil
lingsworth.
There were often difficulties
with the Fox Theatre in
downtown Palo Alto (which the
Flicks have outlived). The man
agers detested the thought of lost
revenue — after all, the Flicks
were 15 cents less than the Fox
in those days. They made it im
possible for the ASSU to get a

film unless a certain period of
time had elapsed since its en
gagement at the Fox.
Today, however we have any
thing and everything we want —
almost. On Dec. 9. 1973, X-rated
Behind The Green Doorwas the
scheduled film. Someone in the
Santa Clara County District At
torney's office frowned on the
idea of pure Stanford students
being subjected to such immoral
degradation up there on the
screen and threatened to arrest
the projectionist and confiscate
the film.
The film was one of the 10
most popular on a survey list of
45 films, and the Flicks manager
at that time, Bob Sisson, said he
"would like to show the film just
because of the great demand for
it. But I'll be in finals that week
and I don't want to be a test
case."
So, instead of fighting legal
battles. Sisson replaced the con
troversial film with Easy Rider.
Most of the time, though, the
dramatics are on the screen.
Nevertheless, something hap
pens to 1501) people left to their
own devices for two hours in the
dark. A mysterious spell enters
and overcomes.
Evervone is allowed to be the

aerodynamics expert one
dreamed of being as a child, or
the witty comedian from Mod
magazine inserting unlikely
comments at unlikely times dur
ing the movie. The Flicks are a
time away from the books and
from the entire academic struc
ture, where, since it is dark, and
one's identity is safe, anyone can
do — and does do — strange
things.
During the sock-hop scene in
American Graffiti, a group of
dancers in 1962 garb climbed
onto the state and danced, mak
ing it the first three-dimensinal
movie in years.
During Ali McGraw's death
scene in Love Story — the per
fect movie for the Flicks, accord
ing to Sisson, someone in the
balcony took out a violin and
began playing appropriately
tear-jerking music.
When Ryan O'Neal started
crying in the same movie, some
one else grabbed a mop, went on
stage, and tried to wipe away his
tears.
For Easy Rider, no sooner had
Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda
roared onto the screen than three
cyclists tore in one side of
Memorial Auditorium and out
the other.

And of course, the Flicks
wouldn't be the Flicks without
the afore-mentioned paper
airplane regattas. The planes
take off from the balcony and
hopefully land on the stage.
More often than not, though,
they nosedive and crash in the
tenth row, usually in some un
suspecting person's lap.
Applause greets any airplane
that makes it to the stage, and
sighs of disappointment meet
those that crash along the way.
One-upmanship is not un
known here. Not to be outdone
by the upper-classmen, some

freshmen attempted to sail an in
flated toy 747 down to the stage.
It worked almost as well as the
DC-lOs.
If a movie is good, it will be
met with rapt attention. Occa
sionally some enterprising per
son, bored with the affair, will
attempt a wisecrack at which no
one will laugh, and said person
will retreat into silence with em
barassment, content with the
knowledge that his identity is
unknown.
However, when a movie is
bad, boring or otherwise unten
able, don't expect to hear any of

it, which is just as well. The
Wisecracks from the wits in the
audience are often more enter
taining.
The Flicks will very likely be
here long after we are all gone —
traditions have a habit of doing
things like that. It is a momentar
ily stunning idea to think that
our children and grandchildren
will be sitting in Memorial Au
ditorium years from now watch
ing movies with superstars who
aren't yet gleams in their fathers'
eyes.
However, that won't come to
mind when Paul Newman
shoots Robert Redford, or when
Jack Nicholson slaps Faye
Dunaway. That is the intent of
the Flicks and movies in general
— to, for a few hours, take our
minds off our past, our present,
and our future. They succeed.


HERE'S THE LINEUP — Every Sunday evening. Memorial Auditorium is Filled with students and
the air is filled with paper airplanes. During the summer, Saturday screenings are also scheduled, in
Cubberley Auditorium.
