# Hoover Tower: library, landmark
## 
### Sandy White 
Everyone knows that once
you're a Stanford graduate, you
get hit for money for the rest of
your life. Sooner or later,
everyone coughs up a couple
thousand here and there. Some
even volunteer money, perhaps
as a good loophole. Hut with
most alumni it stops there. Her
bert Hoover was one of the ex
ceptions.
Not only did Hoover offer
money, he also offered ideas —
such as founding the Food Re
search Jnstituteand encouraging
the development of a business
school.
Probably his greatest contribu
tion to Stanford was the creation
of one of the world's most com
plete collections of information
on 20th century wars and revolu
tion.
The Hoover Institution on
War, Revolution and Peace,
known to most Stanford stu
dents only as that great land
mark in the sky. is a major center
for advanced scholarship in
political science, history,
economics and international
law.
As student guides in the tower
point out to visitors, the institu
tion is the third largest archives
in the nation — the largest pri
vate archives.
It contains over 1,250,000 vol
umes, including government
documents, as well as 3000 arc
hives units, which are private
collections of papers, letters,
memos, pamphlets, diaries and
other documents. Subscriptions
to newspapers and periodicals
have netted over 30.000 titles on
file.
Investigative opportunities
What all these numbers sig
nify to scholar is the possibility
to thoroughly investigate a sub

ject — whether it be an intensive
study of a particular country,
war, or revolution, or a broad,
comparative look, at a political or
historical phenomenon. The in
stitution has published 275 vol
umes since 1919 when Hoover
founded it.
Examples of recent publica
tions are: "The Stalinist Terror
in the Thirties." "The North Ko
rean Economy," "Truman, the
Jewish Vote, and the Creation of
Israel," "Yearbook on Interna
tional Communist Affairs: 197 M
(seventh in a series)," and "A
Chinese-English Dictionary of

Communist Chinese Terminol
ogy-"
As American Relief Administ
ration Director in Europe during
World War I, Hoover began his
collection with the help of Stan
ford professors Ephraim Adams
and Ralph Lutz. He hoped that
the materials they gathered
would provide the data with
which future historians could
work. Lutz became the institu
tion's director in 1925.

Until 1939, the collected
materials were stored in various
places on campus — mcnv in the
main librarx. The library was not
really prepared to store the mas
ses of documents tin; collecting
team sent back at the end of the
war.
Recognizing the need for a
separate building, tin; founders
set about raising money. By
1939. they were ready to start the
tower, which was dedicated in
1941.
With a permanent base and
storage space, the institution
was freed for further acquisition

and expansion. The Lou Henry
Hoover Building was dedicated
in 1967 and houses the East
Asian and newspaper collec
tions and also 36 research of
fices.
A third building is currently
under construction.
285-foot tower
The 285-foot tower holds the
library and main archives —
there are 17 levels of stacks — as
well as administrative and re

search offices, two reading
rooms, two display rooms of
Hoover memorabilia and a 35-
bell carillon.
The bells were cast in Belgium
for the 1939-40 World's Fair and
were later donated to Hoover by
the Belgian American Educa
tional Foundation. Hoover gave
them to the institution, which
placed them on top of the tower.
Electrical Engineering Profes
sor James Angell plays the caril
lon occasionally in the evening
during the summer.
'Angell's music'
As "Angell's music" descends
from the heights above. Hoover
staffers are constantly seeking
new items for all their collec
tions. Although the institution
began as a vehicle to study
World War 1. Hoover's statement
of purpose that it "promote
peace" throughout the world led
to its expansion and constant ac
quisitions.
The Soviet and Chinese col
lections are especially large.
Hoover particularly encouraged
three areas of interest which are
still pursued today: domestic
problems, international studies
and scholarship fellowships.
The library is divided into reg
ional and special collections: Af
rica, East Asia, Eastern Europe.
Latin America. Middle East.
Western Europe, the British
Labor Collection, the
Nicolaevsky Collection and the
New Left Collection.
That same call for the promo
tion of peace has led to the in
stitution's striving to serve as a
dynamic force, attempting to
diagnose problems, suggest sol
utions and uncover trends in the
world through its research and
publications.
As well as employing a staff of
permanent researchers and ar

chivists. the institution makes
its holdings available to Stan
ford students and faculty and all
other scholars. Many authors
and researchers come from all
over the world to use the institu
tion.
Recently a fellows program
has been established in three
ireas: public affairs, peace and
national affairs.
The fellowships are given to
selected applicants and allow
them to spend time "in unre
stricted and creative work." The
national fellowshi ps are given to
approximately 10 people a year.
For one year they are free to
use the institution's resources.
They may discuss their projects
with any of the scholars con
nected with the institution.
Peace fellows
The projects of the three peace
fellows must investigate "the
phenomena of peace," the fel
lowship founders decreed. Pub
lic affairs fellowships are de
signed to train about three
people a year to work for legis
lators and national adminis
trators.
The staff and administration
of the institution cover a wide
spectrum. The director. W.
Glenn Campbell, is also a
member of the University of
California board of regents. The
staff, which represents 20 diffe
rent countries and 30 languages,
numbers 150.
The board of overseers of the
institution, which sets policy
and helps in the selection of a
director, consists of corporate
businessmen and notables from
all over the nation.
Donated money
The institution was blessed
from the very beginning with
more money than a comparable
public archives might find.

Hoover was always on hand to
provide funds, and in 1922 he
gave $200,000 through the
Commission for Relief in Bel
gium.
Endowment and reserve funds
are now over $12,000,000. Gifts
to the institution have risen to
over $2,000,000 a year. In 1971.
alumnus David Packard (co
founder of Hewlitt-Packard)
gave $1.2 million.
The institution is now consi
dered <in independent body
wit hi n the I Jniversity. not just its
stepchild in the backroom. The
hundreds of visitors who enter
its glass doors every day see only

*i small part of the many facets of
the institution.
The stacks, which lurk mys
teriously in the middle floors of
t he building, are open only to the
eyes of the librarians and ar
chivists. Even library patronsare
not free to browse — they must
request specific books, then wait
for the search crew to bring
them.
Visitors in the elevator may
get ,i glimpse of the director's of
fice. on the same floor where
Hoover himself'once kept an of
fice;. But the wealth of materials
in the archives hold a secret no
one can ever learn completely.
