# Campus area filled with cycling attractions

### Dave Ansley 
If you'll lift your head from that book for a
moment, you'll notice that summer has finally
come to the Farm. It is that season for flowers and
birds and sun and mumblety-peg, and neither
Clod nor Little Leland. in their infinite wisdom,
intended that we spend every afternoon of it in the
library.
So drop that pen from your sweaty grip, flex
your fingers a few times, wrap them around the
handlebars of your bicycle and head for the hills.
Ci'wan. Git.
(let away from the musty halls of academe and
enjoy a few hours of fresh air and sun.
Me it a Schwinn tank with coaster brakes or a
(titane lightweight with 10speeds, your bike is an
inexpensive way to see a lot of beautiful coun
tryside, and this area is plentiful in that commod
ity.
for every combination of bicycle, leg strength
and free time that exists, there is a bike route
around here to match it perfectly.
Follow your nose
The most enjoyable way to find these routes is
to follow your nose. Go out Campus Drive to
lunipero Serra Boulevard and turn either right or

left.
Take Palm Drive. Galvez Street or Serra Street
into Palo Alto and explore.
Or you can follow El Camino into any nearby
town, and turn onto any side street that strikes
your fancy. The higher-class residential districts
in Menlo Park and Atherton offer twisty shaded
streets and little traffic.
If you prefer cows and horses to kids and
houses, Sand Hill Road. Page Mill Road and Al
pine Road all cross Interstate 2HO and wind
through the farms and wooded hills in thePortola
Valley area.
Huv the book
Buy the Stanford Area Bicycle Trip
Guidebook, it you want to research the topic first.
Availableat the bookstore for $ 1.50, it lists 50bike
trips for all levels of ability.
Everything from half-mile jaunts to Palo Alto
parks to 120-mile overnight marathons are
suggested, all with complete directionsand travel
tips.
Published by the Stanford Conservation Group,
it divides the Midpeninsula into six regions and
offers a choice of tours in each.
For example, under "Local Rides," the pam-

phlet tolls you how to get to the "Sharon Heights
Picnic Spot":
"This is a pleasant grassy area with a small
pond. Leave campus via the Searsville hike path,
turning left onto Willow Road. Willow become
Sand Hill Road as it crosses Alpine Road. Con
tinue 2/3 of the way up Sand Hill, turning right
onto Monte Rosa Drive. The park is on the left at
the intersection with Sharon Park Drive. Distance
2 miles."
The more industrious will like Hill Country,
which describes the "King's Mountain Loop." It
includes "a pretty four mile climb to the Skeggs
Point Lookout (el. 2300 feet)."
Accessories
Wherever you go and however you gt there,
remember to take along a few accessories to make
the ride more enjoyable.
A small tube patch kit and a bike pump are
necessities, unless you truly enjoy walking your
crippled bike home. Local road maps come in
handy for long trips, since neither the sun nor the
North Star are always around to help out.
If you purchase the guidebook, there are a few
maps inside illustrating the routes. For a more
complete street directory, the Stanford Bookstore
also sells a street map of Midpeninsula cities. Or

find a gas station that still hands them out.
To find out where the hills are in advance, buy a
topographic mapofthearea from U.S.Geographic
Survey Map Center in Menlo Park.
Any bike riders who plan to be away from their
favorite food service for several hours should con
sider carrying some sustenance. Light foods that
provide quick energy are a must.
Try fresh fruits, candy bars or gorp. Corp. long a
favorite of hikers, is a mixture of nuts, dried fruits
and chocolate chips.
For liquid refreshment, water or fruit juices .ire
best.
And of course, one of the most important acces
sories is a companion, of whichever sex you pre
fer.
Pay attention
But don't pav so much attention to your partner
that you stop paying attention to the road. Bicycle
riders will come on the losing end in any confron
tation with a motor vehicle.
According to the guidebook, cyclists are enti
tled to five feet at the right-hand edge of any road,
except where bicycles are prohibited by signs.
The bicycle is the most efficient form of trans
portation around. Use it.
