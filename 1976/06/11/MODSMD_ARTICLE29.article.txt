The Leland Stanford Junior
Museum stands majestically at
t lie end of Museum Wav; a grace
ful arched sculpture at its en
trance heckons visitors and
mimics tin) arches above the
doors.
Like any museum, it is full of
the paintings, sculpture, and
pottery of the past: priceless tes
timony of lost civilizations or
examples of more contemporary
artists.

Hut the Stanford Museum
claims a legacy of which no
other is so blessed; an entire
room is devoted to the history of
the family who founded the
University and built a museum
to hold their treasures for others
to enjoy.
Leland and Jane Lathrop Stan
ford built the museum and the
University as memorials to their
son Leland Jr.. who died at 16.
The museum, built in stages
from IHH4. was modeled after a

building in Athens, Greece. It
was originally much larger than
it is now, extending into what is
now the anatomy building. But
the 1906 earthquake destroyed
the back section; the remaining
front section survived because it
was built of reinforced concrete.
Much of the pottery and
sculpture were destroyed.
Business . . . and pleasure
Were it not for the quake, the
museum would have been the
largest private museum in the
world.Today, the Historical As
sociation of American Public
Works considers it one of the
most significant buildings west
of the Mississippi for its struc
ture and historical content.
The Stanford room, and other
parts of the museum, detail
much of the history of the family,
from its early business ventures
to little Leland's playthings.
Married in 1850. the couple
moved to Sacramento from the
upper Midwest, where Stanford
purchased his brother's store.
lie later helped build, and was
president of. the Southern
Pacific Railroad. At first seen as a
risky financial venture, it later
proved to be a most lucrative in
vestment and helped to support
the University.
As a tribute to Stanford's ven
ture, the museum has a safe dis
playing a gold and silver spike,
symbols of the joining of the
Central and Union Pacific in
Promontory, Utah, which
formed the first transcontinental

line. Stanford was present at the
ceremony.
Photography
He also became involved in
the basics of motion pictures.
Stanford hired the services of
San Francisco photographer
Edweard Muybridge to prove
that when a horse is in motion,
all its hoofs can be off the ground
at once.
Muybridge placed, under a
layer of dirt, a wire connected to
a camera; when the horse ran
over the wire, a photograph was
taken. A series of photographs
was placed on a disc, which
when rotated, looked likea horse
in motion. A sequence of photos,
on display in the Stanford room
show that Stanford was correct.
During theCivil War. Stanford
kept California on the Union
side and organized the Republi
can party for Lincoln. He was
governor of California at the
time; after that, in 1885, he was
elected Senator. His blue Civil
War uniform with gold buttons
and epaulets is preserved under
glass in the room. •
'Precious jewel'
The Stanfords had been mar
ried 1H years before their only
child, Leland Jr., was born in
1 808, in Sacramento. Mrs. Stan
ford was 40 at the time of his
birth, and according to museum
docent C.lenda Northway. her
son was her "precious jewel."
At 18, Leland Jr. planned to
enter Harvard and learn how to
run museums — they were his
passion. But before he got to

Harvard in 1884, while with his
parents in Florence, he died of
typhoid fever.
Museum memorial
When his son died. Stanford
sank into a coma from the shock.
Legend has it that in his father's
dreams, Leland |r. appeared and
said, "live for humanity." When
he awoke, Stanford thought.
"California's children shall be
my children." This led to the es
tablishment of Leland Stanford
Junior University. Mrs. Stanford,
as a memorial to her son and to
carry out his dream, built the Le
land Stanford Junior Museum.
Mrs. Stanford also took her
son's death very hard, and her
husband was happy she had a
project to keep her busy" While
the museum was being built,
museum docent and chairman of
the Stanford Family Portfolio
Peg Haneberg relates, Jane
drove the contractors crazy mak
ing changes in the design. The
contractors told Leland the de
sign changes would cost an ad

ditional $11,000. He paid, be
lieving that "if you get the best
first, it only hurts once when you
get the bill."
The Stanford room in the
museum, then, is full of Leland
Ir.'s travel mementos and toys.
Through the mementos one can
especially see how he gradually
became more sophisticated.
His bicycle, with remarkably
well-preserved rubber tires,
dominates much of the room.
Another eye-catcher is a paint
ing of the family, entitled "Sun
day afternoon at Stanford." that
shows the family, friends and re
latives at the Stanford's Palo
Alto home.
Mummified alligator
Leland Jr.'s childhood toys
begin with wooden soldiers,
paint sets, games, wood carv
ings and drawings of ships he
did at age 10.
His early travel mementos in
clude 16th century German
knives and forks, a corner of a
stove from a ninth century Bava

rian castle, and a miniature Hank
at America safp.
He later collected scrolls froin
Constantinople, elaborately de
tailed Roman. Florentine and
Venetian mosaics, arrowheads,
jewelry and a mummified hand
and alligator.
In his teens, he enjoyed shoot
ing birds and small animals on
the Palo Alto grounds; the
mounted creatures occupy a
whole section of cabinet.
Many of the other museum ar
tifacts were collected and do
nated by Jane. A visitor favorite
is an Egyption mummy dated
663-525 B.C. She also gave a
Cypress pottery collection. In
dian weavings and a set of 11th
Century Italian columns, to
name a few items.
Otherwise. 1 laneberg said that
the museum acquires pieces
through acquisition funds, pro
ceeds from the Committee for
Art's "treasure mart" are al 1 used
for purchase of museum pieces.
Haneberg said that pieces art?
also donated by friends of the
museum. The museum has re
cently acquired a permanent col
lection of Rodin sculpture, total
ling 90 pieces, from M. Cerald
Cantor, a Beverly Hills invest
ment banker. The sculptures are
now cramped together in a small
wing of the museum, but exten
sive funds will be spent to
earthquake-proof the rotunda for
permanent exhibition. Cantor
has also set up a 10-year fellow
ship for Rodin study.

coins, pottery shards, and mummified alligators.
