# THE
						CITY
## How to sightsee San Francisco 
### 
San Francisco is the; biggest
tourist attraction in northern
California, and it deserves to be
treated with respect. No matter
how long one plans to be in the
Bay Area this summer, one
should pav respect to the City at
■ oast once.
The descriptions and sugges
tions offered here are by no
means complete, and are written
primarily for the sight-seer. For
more details (and lots of
brochures), we suggest contact
ing tin: San Francisco Conven
tion and Visitors Bureau. 1390
Market St.. (415) 626-5500.
On )lily 1. the bureau will
open <i Visitor Information
Center in Benjamin H. Swig

Pavilion. liallitiie Plaza. Powell
iul Market Streets. Located on
the lower level—directly oppo
site t he BART station — it will be
open from a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
There's one important t hi ng to
remember while visiting San
Prancisco. The worst thing one
i.in do while there is identify
oneself to t he natives as a tourist.
\nd the best way to look like a
tourist is to refer to the place as
"Prisco." Calling it "SP" won't
get one much further. Only Herb
Caen can get away with
"Baghdad by the Bay."
While "San Prancisco" may
ound unwieldy when used in
e\ cry other sentence, it is the ac
cepted term.
To save a little breath, "the
City" is permitted. True, there
art; dozens of cities around here,
but only one merits capitaliza
tion..
While we're on the topic of
things one doesn't do in San
Prancisco. perhaps we should
discuss one more. While on the
i able cars, do not sing the Kice
a-Roni theme song. Don't even
whistle it. no matter how strong
he temptation. It's considered
very tacky.
Now. What (iocs one do in the
City ?
Cable Cars: Three different
lines serve the City and its vis
itors. The fare is 25 cents, and
