## 'The San Francisco treat' 
### Bonny Rodden 
If you think cable cars are just
a San Francisco tourist trap,
you're on the wrong track.
Businessmen board the cars,
straightening out their ties, on
their way to the financial dis
trict. Old women, arms cradling
bags of groceries, struggle onto
the outside bench on their way
home from shopping.
And then there are those who
make a living jerking brakes and
collecting fares — the gripman
and the conductor.
Robust romanticists on their
first day of cable training soon
learn "it's not as glamorous as
they thought," chuckles Sam
McDaniel, a 26-vear veteran.
Those first 25 days of training
are exhausting, he explains as he
pulls the brake, his muscles
bulging with strength.
Lots of exercise
"You operate a cable car with
your feet and hands. It takes
body coordination; it's a lot of
exercise."
The car stops at the crest of
Powell and California. People
clamber off, dragging cameras
and hesitating mates. People
clamber on, pushing and shov
ing for the breezy outside
benches.
"Please move from behind the
brake," McDaniel asks of the
newcomers.
As the car jerks to a start he
continues. "The work's a little
too rugged for a girl. A woman
can't handle it. It's even too rug
ged for a lot of men."
A few of the passengers glare.
A woman who fits the 175-
pound weight requrement
would probably be allowed to
run a cable car, he adds, qualify
ing his first statement.
Loves work
But even though the work is
rigorous. McDaniel loves it."I
feel I'm contributing to the
City." he remarks. He acts as tour
guide, restaurant connoisseur
and lost and found administrator
for his passengers.
Strangers to the City often
don't realize that there are two
branches to the Hyde Street line.
Frequently families get split up.
with some members ending up
near Fisherman's Wharf while
the rest of the crew take another
car which deposits them at
Ghirardelli Square.

"White shoes are a very good
thing to look for," McDaniel re
marks in a discussion on how to
discern tourists. A few glances
are shot his way from bodies en
sconced in maps.
McDaniel comments that he
doesn't mind most tourists'
questions. "They're more jolly,
interested in what's going on
that most passengers."
He prefers foreigners as pass
negers because "most of the
foreigners enjoy this country
more than we do."
The most embarrassing ques
tion he has ever been asked is

"Do they have runaways?" And
nearly everyone asks it.
McDaniel remarks that cable
cars don't just go "flying down
the hill out of control." There is
an elaborate safety device which
grabs the six-strand cable. If one'
of the strands is frayed the cable
immediately stops running.
Lack of experience
Most of the t able car accidents
have been caused by "lack of ex
peiience on the part ot the grip
man." McDaniel states. "Some

of the younger peopledon't just
heed to responsibility; they're
not concerned enough," he la
ments.
At an intersection, the cable
car jerks to a stop, the cable still
humming. McDaniel explains
the cable has hit a "dead spot."
He and the conductor jump off
and push the car over the void
area.
McDaniel is always jumping
or jerking or just watching. Run
ning cable cars is a busy job and
he has to be alert. But the most
hectic part of the job comes on
Dec. 31 every vear.

Jubilant party-goers, holding
onto the poles in front of the
benches, hang out over the traf
fic. They climb on top of the car.
"You can't do anything but
hope they don't fall off."
McDaniel laughs half-heartedly.
Nights of Shriners c.onvi n
tions or "nights when the fleet's
in" can be harrowing when the
passengers become rowdy. "You
just have to be carefree and let if
go." he says.
McDa.iiel remarks th.it niuht

shifts are easier because "people
aren't pushed for time."
But he especially enjoys the
first run of the morning — start
ing off about 5:45. "That's when
San Francisco is the most beauti
ful."
And he's right. At dawn,
streaks of orange and pink high
light a stark Transamerica
Pyramid. Flashes of sunlight
bounce off the brown windows
of the Bank of America building.
As the cable car rocks slowly
from side to side on its way up

the hill, lone passengers stare at
discarded paper skipping across
deserted streets.
Newspaper delivery trucks
and taxis occasionally dart along
the streets. Single men. unsha
ven from the night before, lean
■ gainst stop signs.
And .is the car peaks a hilltop,
the Oakland-Hav Bridge glows
majestically in front of rolls ot
clouds th.it look like folds ot a
regal while robe.

trict. Old women, arms cradling

And then there are those who
make a living jerking brakes and
collecting fares — the gripman
and the conductor.
Robust romanticists on their
first day of cable training soon
learn "it's not as glamorous as
they thought," chuckles Sam
McDaniel, a 26-vear veteran.
Those first 25 days of training
are exhausting, he explains as he
pulls the brake, his muscles
bulging with strength.
Lots of exercise
"You operate a cable car with
your feet and hands. It takes
body coordination; it's a lot of
exercise."
The car stops at the crest of
Powell and California. People
clamber off, dragging cameras
and hesitating mates. People
clamber on, pushing and shov
ing for the breezy outside
benches.
"Please move from behind the
brake," McDaniel asks of the
newcomers.
As the car jerks to a start he
continues. "The work's a little
too rugged for a girl. A woman
can't handle it. It's even too rug
ged for a lot of men."
A few of the passengers glare.
A woman who fits the 175-
pound weight requrement
would probably be allowed to
run a cable car, he adds, qualify
ing his first statement.
Loves work
But even though the work is
rigorous. McDaniel loves it."I
feel I'm contributing to the
City." he remarks. He acts as tour
guide, restaurant connoisseur
and lost and found administrator
for his passengers.

near Fisherman's Wharf while
the rest of the crew take another
car which deposits them at
Ghirardelli Square.

"White shoes are a very good
thing to look for," McDaniel re
marks in a discussion on how to
discern tourists. A few glances
are shot his way from bodies en
sconced in maps.
McDaniel comments that he
doesn't mind most tourists'
questions. "They're more jolly,
interested in what's going on
that most passengers."
He prefers foreigners as pass
negers because "most of the
foreigners enjoy this country
more than we do."
The most embarrassing ques
tion he has ever been asked is

"Do they have runaways?" And
nearly everyone asks it.
McDaniel remarks that cable
cars don't just go "flying down
the hill out of control." There is
an elaborate safety device which
grabs the six-strand cable. If one'
of the strands is frayed the cable
immediately stops running.
Lack of experience
Most of the t able car accidents
have been caused by "lack of ex
peiience on the part ot the grip
man." McDaniel states. "Some

of the younger peopledon't just
heed to responsibility; they're
not concerned enough," he la
ments.
At an intersection, the cable
car jerks to a stop, the cable still
humming. McDaniel explains
the cable has hit a "dead spot."
He and the conductor jump off
and push the car over the void
area.
McDaniel is always jumping
or jerking or just watching. Run
ning cable cars is a busy job and
he has to be alert. But the most
hectic part of the job comes on
Dec. 31 every vear.

Jubilant party-goers, holding
onto the poles in front of the
benches, hang out over the traf
fic. They climb on top of the car.
"You can't do anything but
hope they don't fall off."
McDaniel laughs half-heartedly.
Nights of Shriners c.onvi n
tions or "nights when the fleet's
in" can be harrowing when the
passengers become rowdy. "You
just have to be carefree and let if
go." he says.
McDa.iiel remarks th.it niuht

shifts are easier because "people
aren't pushed for time."
But he especially enjoys the
first run of the morning — start
ing off about 5:45. "That's when
San Francisco is the most beauti

And he's right. At dawn,

make a living jerking brakes and
collecting fares — the gripman
and the conductor.
Robust romanticists on their
first day of cable training soon
learn "it's not as glamorous as
they thought," chuckles Sam
McDaniel, a 26-vear veteran.
Those first 25 days of training
are exhausting, he explains as he
pulls the brake, his muscles
bulging with strength.
Lots of exercise
"You operate a cable car with
your feet and hands. It takes
body coordination; it's a lot of
exercise."
The car stops at the crest of
Powell and California. People
clamber off, dragging cameras
and hesitating mates. People
clamber on, pushing and shov
ing for the breezy outside
benches.
"Please move from behind the
brake," McDaniel asks of the
newcomers.
As the car jerks to a start he
continues. "The work's a little
too rugged for a girl. A woman
can't handle it. It's even too rug
ged for a lot of men."
A few of the passengers glare.
A woman who fits the 175-
pound weight requrement
would probably be allowed to
run a cable car, he adds, qualify
ing his first statement.
Loves work
But even though the work is
rigorous. McDaniel loves it."I
feel I'm contributing to the
City." he remarks. He acts as tour
guide, restaurant connoisseur
and lost and found administrator
for his passengers.
Strangers to the City often
don't realize that there are two
branches to the Hyde Street line.
Frequently families get split up.
with some members ending up
near Fisherman's Wharf while
the rest of the crew take another
car which deposits them at
Ghirardelli Square.

"White shoes are a very good
thing to look for," McDaniel re
marks in a discussion on how to
discern tourists. A few glances
are shot his way from bodies en
sconced in maps.
McDaniel comments that he
doesn't mind most tourists'
questions. "They're more jolly,
interested in what's going on
that most passengers."
He prefers foreigners as pass
negers because "most of the
foreigners enjoy this country
more than we do."
The most embarrassing ques
tion he has ever been asked is

"Do they have runaways?" And
nearly everyone asks it.
McDaniel remarks that cable
cars don't just go "flying down
the hill out of control." There is
an elaborate safety device which
grabs the six-strand cable. If one'
of the strands is frayed the cable
immediately stops running.
Lack of experience
Most of the t able car accidents
have been caused by "lack of ex
peiience on the part ot the grip
man." McDaniel states. "Some

of the younger peopledon't just
heed to responsibility; they're
not concerned enough," he la
ments.
At an intersection, the cable
car jerks to a stop, the cable still
humming. McDaniel explains
the cable has hit a "dead spot."
He and the conductor jump off
and push the car over the void
area.
McDaniel is always jumping
or jerking or just watching. Run
ning cable cars is a busy job and
he has to be alert. But the most
hectic part of the job comes on
Dec. 31 every vear.

Jubilant party-goers, holding
onto the poles in front of the
benches, hang out over the traf
fic. They climb on top of the car.
"You can't do anything but
hope they don't fall off."
McDaniel laughs half-heartedly.
Nights of Shriners c.onvi n
tions or "nights when the fleet's
in" can be harrowing when the
passengers become rowdy. "You
just have to be carefree and let if
go." he says.
McDa.iiel remarks th.it niuht

shifts are easier because "people
aren't pushed for time."
But he especially enjoys the
first run of the morning — start
ing off about 5:45. "That's when
San Francisco is the most beauti
ful."
And he's right. At dawn,
streaks of orange and pink high
light a stark Transamerica
Pyramid. Flashes of sunlight
bounce off the brown windows
of the Bank of America building.
As the cable car rocks slowly
from side to side on its way up

the hill, lone passengers stare at
discarded paper skipping across
deserted streets.
Newspaper delivery trucks
and taxis occasionally dart along
the streets. Single men. unsha
ven from the night before, lean
■ gainst stop signs.
And .is the car peaks a hilltop,
the Oakland-Hav Bridge glows
majestically in front of rolls ot
clouds th.it look like folds ot a
regal while robe.

guide to lost-and-found service.
