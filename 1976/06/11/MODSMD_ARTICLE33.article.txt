# Disco fever: get dancin', get it up and get down
## 
### Perry Simon Alex Left 
In the middle of the dance
floor, a bare-chested black, his
hips encircled by a silver Indian
belt, bumps with a sleek redhead
dressed in clinging orange satin
pants, a low-cut yellow blouse,
and an orange scarf. They stare at
each other and let their bodies do
the talking.
Suddenly, she drops to her
knees and alternately brushes
one cheek and then the other
against her partner's crotch.
He pumps his pelvis slightly
but stares straight ahead. She
stands up and he spreads his
knees, arching his back slightly
as the redhead wedges her hips
sideways between his thighs.
Their hips pulsate in time to the
disco beat. They challenge each
other to back down. But the
music won't let them.
Dance discipline
Like a well-disciplined army,
scattered dancers fall into forma
tion. With mechanical precision
they dance the L.A. Hustle.

Eventually, the discipline be
comes too confining; the dancers
must break away and attempt to
release their excess energy in
whatever manner suits them
best.
This is the disco scene: bodies
churning as if the floor were a
giant mixmaster, motion spur
red by music, strobes pulsating
in a storm of fire. Some say it's
the Big New Thing that has
given a transfusion to a
moribund rock and roll industry.
Although dancing to records
has been around as long as the
discs themselves, the first dis
cotheques were born in Paris and
New York 10 years ago. These,
however, were overshadowed by
the emergence of live rock shows
in places like the Fillmore East
and West.
"People danced like crazy
when Bill Graham first opened."
one disco owner said. "But then
they got mellow. The drug scene
had a lot to do with it."
Few agree on how the new
disco craze began to dent the

stoned reverence of the rock
concert. Both blacks and gays
claim credit.
"Blacks have always danced
to records," shouts Leon Harris
as he bumps hip to hip with his
girlfriend at San Francisco's
Ricksha Bistro. "We invent the
dances — you white boys just
steal 'em." .
But a disc jockey at a promi
nent San Francisco gay disco
says,"The very first disco in
town was the Cabaret: it was to
tally gay. Gay people have al

ways been more progressive."
Airwave rave
Whoever is right, disco music
unquestionably is taking over
the AM airwaves, pushing more
sophisticated rock forms off the
charts.
Classics of the genre include:
"Hustle" by Van McCoy. "Get
Down Tonight" bv K.C. and the
Sunshine Band and "Fight the
Power" by the Isley Brothers.
Once the discos spun the records
that AM pop stations played.
Now. radio stations check the

disco play lists first.
The disco market is so impor
tant that "disco versions" of re
cords, with more pronounced
rhythm sections and sound de
signed for high volume, are pre
pared specially for the clubs.
Although mainstream whites
are flooding the floor, some of
the most successful clubs remain
predominantly gay. The End-up,
the City's foremost gay disco,
isn't exactly comfortable, but it
stresses quality and good vibes.
'Intellectual' clients
"We're the best dance and
cruise bar in the city," claims
Tom, an End-up disc jockey.
"Other discos cater to welfare
people; the clientele here is a lot
more intellectual — lawyers,
doctors . . . heh, even a few Stan
ford professors."
Tom says that End-up wel
comes women "as long as
they're ladies. There's a differ
ence between a lady and a
broad." Asked if heterosexual
males are welcome, he replied,
"The only thing all of us in here
don't like is discrimination."
Not all patrons come to dance.
"I hate to dance and the music is
awful," one client said. Tom
says that there's not much drink

ing, either: "In fact, many pat
rons favor fruit juice."
What brings people in. Tom
says, is "the other people." But
aside from the socializing on the
sidelines, there's plenty to
watch. A caged go-go boy
bumps, grinds and teases with
the zipper ot his baggy army
surpllis pants. Across the room a
sign reads: "Jockey Shorts Dance
Contest . . . Sundays . . . $100
First Prize."
At Dance Your Ass Off, re
garded as thestraightest and best
Frisco Disco, DJ Pete Struve sits
20 leet above the frenzy encased
in a glass booth with a control
panel that makes a 747
dashboard look modest. Struve.
the DJ's pilot, controls the dance
lloor environment. He directs
both the music and the flashing
lights.
Struve denies rumors of
play list payola and says."I de
cide what I play solely on the
basis of what I like and what the
floor gets off on."

intense. Faces glisten with sweat
and no bell signals the end of a
round. One record punches into
the next; to stop dancing, even
for a moment, is to lose. Littered
on the sideline couches are bat
tered bodies that have spun off
the floor. After a few minutes re
cuperation, they get up again.
A stunning brunette with a
Vidal Sasson wedge cut sips a
Brandy Alexander in the com
paratively quiet disco bar. "Why
do I come here? Because there's
foxy men."
Her blonde frrend, Geneva, is
approached by a Romeo in a
white suit. How does she decide
whether to dance with him?
"Confidentially, I like his ass."
More patrons dance the Hustle
than the Bump, which some say
is too suggestive when per-

formed on the dance floor with a
stranger. "The bump's not out."
a bystander explains. "Hut only
real tight couples do it."
A woman who looks like a
secretary-by-day giggles outside
the men's room. "I'm waiting for
my boyfriend to come out of the
bathroom from doing some
coke, she says. Why won't she
stop dancing? "I can't."
Youthtul energy
Although many disco patrons
are expending sheer youthful
energy, the blazing disco
machine is noticably stoked
with amphetamines, cocaine
and amyl nitrite.
Why the disco craze?
Mike, an End-up 1)J. says. "It's
all escape. They don't have to
spend too much money, you
know, to go out, buy a few
drinks, dance, have a good time
... and lorget about what's
going on."
The sexual overtones of San
Francisco clubs disturbed one
New York disco veteran:
"People out here are trying to get

laid. In gay discos in New York 4
. . . all they want to do is dance."
As tor the difference between
the Los Angeles and San Fran
cisco disco scene, an End-up l)J
explained: "In L.A. they play
anything new: we throw away
the shit."
Lauren, a veteran ot the Dance 4
Your Ass Off floor, says t li.it
pickup undertones shouldn't
keep anyone from checking out
the disco scene. "You only get
picked up if you want to be." she
insists.
"It's friendly here," says Wil
lie. a Frisco Disco waiter. "It's
not a pickup scene. People come,
they meet each other, dance,
come back, maybe see each other
again. Then maybe, they go
home and f— each others' brains
out."
