## 
### Steve Hefter 
Three middle-aged men sit and ogle in the front
•>w. The room is dark.
Musty barmaids with halter tops and hot pants
shuttle drinks to the dozen or so spectators and
the three-piece band grinds out some barroom
striptease.
On stage, Carol Doda is topless. Forty-four in
r.hes of the most famous mammary glands Mother
Natureand men of science haveever produced are
<iii display.
The music swells.
Carol strokes the microphoneand slowly brings
it to her glossy-red lips. "Sit back and relax," she
suggests, with an impudent wiggle in her voice,
"aiul don't turn the knobs, 'cause it hurts."
Well-trained dog
l or 10 years people have been coming to San
rancisco's Condor Club to see Carol Doda. She
was America's first topless dancer and a decade
later her silicone-injected breats still perform

tri< ks just like a well-trained dog
For five shows, six nights a
week, the famed twosome jerk
and jiggle and bounee in time to
vVie music. They sway from side
io side along the piano top and
( oyly hide behind a peignoir.
After I In; show, ensconced in a
plus black leather chair in the
basement office of the Condor,
(iartil talks about what it was like
the.-first night. "I felt shy for a
linute and I thought — 'Can I
really go down there without a
lop on?' But then I thought. '1
really don't know any other way
ot breaking into show business.'
"I was very naive. 1 was only
HO years old at t he time and I was
very stupid." she laughs. "But 1
si knew that 1 had the incentive
to df) il and the feeling, you
know. I wanted to do some
thing." .
Silicone Injections
Six months after she started
topless, Carol had silicone injec
tions which built her np from 34
. iches to 44 inches.

"lt didn't change me as a performer." Carol
notes, "It just enhanced the act, so to speak. I find
lots of people like to look at them."
Carol describes her act as entertainment. "I'm
.in entertainer. I'm not a stripper. 1 stripin my act.
hut I also sing and also dance and also talk to the
audience."
She adds with emphasis. "I like to make people
happy, .ind il I can make people happy it gives me
a thrill."
"!*m very aware of what I'm doing upthere. You
have to he A lot of it's sensual and happy vibra
tions;." she says smiling.
A family show
In-recent years.Carol notes that the show has
"become a family show. More couples, more
lamrlies and a lot of long-hairs have come here."
' At one time." she shrugs, "I thought it was just
for Ijusi nessmen."
Carol sinks low in her chair. Her amply en
dowed frame is swathed in a temporary restrain

ing blouse and the cleavage is well-defined. She
shakes some platinum-blonde hair from her face
and thinks back on how her career began.
"I started here (the Condor) at 17 as a cocktail
waitress and began dancing when I was 20. But
people don't know that." she confides, "because
you're not supposed to work in an alcoholic place
under the age of 21."
Laurels
Today. Carol Doda enjoys the laurels that come
with hard work. She marches in parades, poses for
nude magazines and does station breaks and
editorials for Channel 36 in San Jose.
Doda smiles as she looks ahead to the future.
"I'm preparing for big night clubs in Las Vegas. 1
want to sing, dance and tell jokes. You know, I've
taken voice lessons for eight years." she con
cludes.
Though her act may offend some women's
liberationists. Doda reacts. "I've helped women's
liberation by taking off my clothes. 1 mean, they
don't wear bras any more, do they?" She con-

tinues, "Being liberated is being free in your own
mind. They're free to take their clothes off.
"Everybody's an individual as far as I'm con
cerned."
Rowdy customer
Carol Doda gets up. She's got another show in
10 minutes and has to get ready. As she prepares
to go on stage she talks of a problem she had the
night before with a rowdy customer.
"This guy comes on stage," she explains. "We
have panties on. you know, and I was in my act
and he came up and kissed me on my panties.
Instead of freaking out. I just looked at him and
said. 'I'm sorry I had my pants on!' And then I —
he was really drunk — and then I said." she rolls
her voice. " 'That's what you call a half-assed
job.' "
The band strikes up and the stage lights go out.
Carol Doda bares her breasts for the second time
this night, the 30th time this week and about the
15.000 th time in the last 10 years.
