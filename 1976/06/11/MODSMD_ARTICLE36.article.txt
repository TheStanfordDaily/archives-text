# Restaurants
## A
						sampling of local eateries From fast food to fancy fare 
### Nancy Wilson Dave Ansley 
The restaurants described on
t his page arc not the only ones in
the area, nor are they necessarily
the best ones. But they are ones
which we think you'll enjoy.
They've been divided into three
price ranges, based on the ap
proximate cost for an individual
meal. However, due to the wide
variations in both restaurant of
ferings and individual taste,
these prices are estimates.
Inexpensive (less than $5)
Cafe Mcursault
(>5l Kmerson. Palo Alto
A wine restaurant. Main fea
ture is iin extensive wine-list.
Kn trees made mostly to accom
pany tin? fine wines. Very casual.
I lave many varieties of cheese
and ham or turkey crepes. Very
filling and about $.'i. Try the
qui< lie or thi; cheese and ham
crepe.
Don't ask for the house Wine.
Check out the wi lie list or ask the
waiter for help.
Frankie & Johnnie & Fuigi Too
939 El Camino Real West.
Mountain View
He prepared to wait a long
time in line — the Italian food
here is popular, but the restaur
ant is small. It's easier to get in
side if you come in a smal I group
they have difficulty accom
modating more than four or five.
Everything is served steaming
hot and in huge portions — be
careful of how much you order.
The pizzas are known for their
fluffy wheat flour crusts. An

tipasto salad is a good appetizer,
but share it two or three ways.
They serve every kind of Italian
dish you can imagine and like to
use giant mushrooms.
You're in tight quarters and it
is kind of noisy, but you can't

beat the $4-$5 price. And you
can watch them making the piz
zas while you stand in line.
Genghis Khan Mongolian Bar
beque
Alma Plaza, on Alma St.. Palo
Alto
Do-it-yourself cooking over a
gas hibachi at your own table.
Sparse decor, very casual.
Can choose from beef, lamb,
pork, shrimp or scallops to be
served to you raw and plain and
then you cook them yourself. A
milk "Mongolian" sauce to dip
in after cooking. Pork, beef, and

shrimp are the best. Order by
weight, V-i to ;t /j lb. servings- run
no more than $5. mostly around
$4.
Nothing fancy, but the prices
aren't either. (Jives you some
thing to do while you're eating.

Henry's
482 University Ave., Palo Alto
Casual atmosphere, bar deco
rated like a "New York Style
pub." Dining areas beyond the
bar.
Most entrees are around $4.
The menu is surprisingly di
verse lor such a small restaurant.
Good choice are petrale, quiche,
cold salads and other fish or
meat dishes.
Really a bargain, and a grow
ing favorite. Casual and not ex
pensive for an evening of good
food.

Jack-in-the-Box
Nearest one — 2280 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto
For those of you from back
East, Jack's is just like Mac's.
Jose's Pizza and Salteneria
2275 El Camino Real, Palo Alto
(Across from Jack in the Box)
Cuban and Bolivian food,
pizza. Music nightly, or some
other entertainment. Walk-up
service. To go, or order to eat in.
Try something besides the
pizza, if you like. Good saltenas
[Bolivian) —meat or shrimp co
vered with a bread crust. Prices
around $3-$5. Also good fried
bananas for dessert. Serve wine
and beer.
Pizza can be a bit greasy. And
the sausage is strong. Talk to
Jose, the owner— a really per
sonable guy. He's the one with
no hair and the chef's hat.
Ea Fortuna
3180 Middlefield Rd.. Palo Alto
As authentic a Mexican re
staurant as you're likely to find
around here. Not at all fancy, but
once the waiter has figured out
what you've ordered, you'll get a
good meal.
A filling combination (you can
choose from dozens) costs about
$3.50.
Marie Callender's Pies
4710 El Camino Real, Eos Altos
Good inexpensive food, in a
slightly bright and noisy atmos
phere. Save some room for the
pies — they're good, fresh and
smothered with meringue.
The servings don't look too
big, but they're filling. The veg
etable soup has whole vegeta

bles. Quiche with a small salad is
a decent buy — try the fresh
spinach in the salad bar.
A good place to take the fam
ily. If the kids don't like the tuna
stack, they can order a ham
burger. On weekends there is
usually a 10-15 minute wait for
seats, so go early.
McDonald's
Nearest one — 3128 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto
What can one say about Mac's?
They're there, the food is edible,
and you can watch them punch
the fancy calculator/ordering
pads.
Round Table Pizza
Twelve locations — see the
phone book
A Stanford tradition. Good
selection, reasonable prices. It's
your basic pizza parlor, and a
nice place to run into friends at
about 10 p.m. A combination for
two costs about $4.25,
Togo's Eatery
4131 El Camino Way. Palo Alto
One of the best food bargains
anywhere on HI Camino Real.
Except that it's actually on El
Camino Way. It's a converted
massage parlor, and it serves in
credible submarine sandwiches.
They have 24 different kinds,
each comes in three sizes: small
(about $1.20), large ($1.60) and
family size ($4.40). You have to
see them to believe them.
Best by far is the roast beef
sandwich, which comes with
lettuce, tomatos. pickles, pep
pers and more meat than you
can eat.
The surroundings are a bit
sparse— wood paneling and an
occasionally dirty floor, but the
food is well worth it.

U.S. Chinese Restaurant
1039 El (.amino Real. Menlo
Park
Chinese food to eat in or to go.
Ne.it, authentic Chinese decor.
Mo Shu Pork and Hot and Sour
Chicken are the best choices. So
are tin; fried bananas for dessert.
Each selection is about $2.25
for enough for two people. Or
order the U.E. dinner, offering a
bit of each for $.'J .75.
Some of th(! entrees have more
sauce and vegetable than meat.
Intermediate ($5 to $8)
The Antique
2700 El Camino Real. Palo Alto
A cozy, romantic atmosphere,
even though most people .ire sit
ting in booths. Very efficient and
friendly waitresses.
Best bets are the dinner pi«-s or
the sausage sandwiches. Most
people can't finish either. A
meal will cost you $4-$5 each.

Cricchio's Restaurant Sicilian*)
El Camino Real & San Antonio
Road. Los Altos
Sicilian food and decor. A
combination of southern France
and Italy. Lots of seafood.
Try the Seafood Canneloni
it's seafood in a crepe, topped
with cheese and a sauce — good
and filling. House dressing 011
the salad is good. Entrees are
Walch out for tin; poor man's
abalone—Cabalone. It's squid
meat and c'nmes as a bit of a sur
prise.
L'Ommies
4170 El Camino Real, Palo Alto
Continental cuisine. A bar
with fireplace, and fireplace in
the dining-rooms. Music on
weekends in bar.
Try the brochette of seafood,
the cordon bleu and the steaks.
French onion soup is well made.
Entrees run $4.50 to $7.50.
A special touch — cheese fon
due served before dinner instead
of just bread and butter. Can
order that and <1 salad lor two and
be satisfied.
Magic Pan Creperie
San Mateo. San Jose, San Fran
cisco and Ghirardelli Square.
A casual atmosphere, for din
ing in crepes. Almost everything
is served in a crepe, except the
salad. Crepes fire made with a
special magic pan. and are made
for your entertainment.
Crepe fillings are not very in
teresting on tbn whole, though
some stand out — the spinach
souffle and the mushroom were
good. Dessert crepes are also
good. Try the mocha or straw
berry crepe supreme. Crepes run
around $4, or a bit more if you
get two varieties.

The Red Pepper
4125 El Camino Way. Palo Alto
Mexican food, and mexica'n
villa decor.
Prices run about $5 for a
couple of dinner choices. Try the
chile relleno. and the beef en
chilada. with guacamole sauce.
Sangria is $3.50 a pitcher and a
bit weak. Stick to the beer <md
wine.
Not the place for those liking
spicy mexican food. Dishes .ire
tame, unless you add their very
spicy hot sauce
Saint Michael's Alley
HOC) Kmerson. Palo Alto
International cuisine, old En
glish decor. Informal, sin.ill.
verv nice cozy atmosphere. (In

staurant. Many friends have
adopted it as their favorite.
Shirt Tail
2515 El Camino Real, Palo Alto
Steaks and seafood, with .1 re
laxed atmosphere. Fairly new
management, and still not up to
par.
Good choices are the fried
prawns, and the more bash
meats. Abalone is a bit tough
green goddess dressing is good.
Entrees run $5 to $0. though
some as high as $10.
Sirloin and Brew Unlimited
500 El Camino Real, Belmont
Very relaxed place. May
theme is to provide you with
dinner at a minimum cost.
Has a salad bar, unlimited
beer, wine or sangria (or cham
pagne on weeknights), unli
mited bread and butter. The din
ner costs $5 to $7. The cuts of
meat aren't exceptional, and pv|
t ions aren't huge, but there is lots
of salad and bread. Stick to the
unmarinated varieties of meat.
While it's all fine and good to
cut costs, this restaurant may have
gone too far and cut the things
you go out for. Good for an even
-1 ng of drinking and bread.
Steak and Ale Restaurant
2300 East Bayshore Rd., Palo
Alto
(across from Ming's)
Old English decor, adjoining
bar, in a casual atmosphere. In
eludes .1 serve-yourself soup and

around $B-SH.
Not inexpensive, but reallv >1
bargain. Included with dinner is

generous servings of meat. Des
serts are also good, especially
