# It's the real cream
## Gaylord's sells 'natural' cones 
### Howard Baldwin 
This may come as a shock to
you, but very few of us have had
real ice cream more than a few
times in our lives.. Your first
question may very well be.
"Then just what is it that I've
been taking out of the freezer at
the supermarket all these
years?"
It's what the dairy industry
has convinced a gullible public
to believe is ice cream. Hut it's
not. Because real ice cream, the
kind that was consumed before
1927, is a far cry from the
chemical-laden, air-injected.
synthetic garbage we've been
stuffing our faces with all this
time.
The man in a frenzy over the
proliferation of this plastic

mock-up of ice cream is Gaylord
W. Willis, 20 percent owner of
•ind 100 percent supplier to Old
Uncle (iavlord's Ice Cream Par
lours (one of which opened on
Emerson St. in Palo Alto last
month).
A self-proclaimed "ice cream
revolutionaryWillis has
started what is most likely the
most unorthodox way of man
ufacturing and selling ice cream
the modern United States has
ever seen.
What went wrong
To appreciate what VVillis is
doing, one must understand
what went wrong with icecream
about 50 years ago. Ice cream
was irrevocably changed in that
banner year of 1927 when Ihe
air-inject freezer was invented. It
became possible to manufacture

ice cream less expensively, with
as much as fit) percent air.
However, air does not simply
stay in ice cream — it must be
kept there, courtesy of chemical
stabilizers. Artificial colors and
flavorings were added to cover
up the taste of the chemicals, and
it became far more profitable to
make chemcially treated ice
cream than the real thing.
Eventually, as Willis' own
Old UncleGaylord's IceOeam
Hook states, "Ice cream became
the garbage dump of the dairy
industry."
It is Willis and his
small string of shops around the
Hay Area who is changing all
this. In all of the United States,
only his ice cream contains none

of the usual ingredients found in
regular ice cream made from
mixes.
Ingredients listed
All of Old Uncle Gaylord's Ice
Cream Parlours proudly display
a list of their ice cream's ingre
dients. Think now — when was
the last time you saw a list of
ingedients on an ice cream pac
kage? You probably didn't, he
cause the FDA doesn't require
the dairy industry to list the gar
bage they put into their product.
Uncle Gaylord's ice cream con
tains no preservatives, no mixes,
no chemicals — absolutely no
thing unnatural. Othericecream
contains such mouth-waterng
delicacies as carregeenan (found
to cause cancer in rats);
piperanol (a commercial louse
killer); amylphenvl acetate (the

substitute for chocolate); and
glucose (the grandfather of the
empty calorie family).
Willis' words of condemna
tion come in waves like Sherman
tanks, verbally indicting and
machine-gunning Government,
Big Business, the Dairy Industry,
Corruption and anything else
that has the misfortune to get
into his line of fire.
Two years ago he would have
been called a crackpot, but now
there is no doubt at all to his ac
cusations. His battle is waged
on two fronts — manufacture
and distribution. He has but one
factory, next to his parlour on
Mission Street in San Francisco.
He walks there from his house
three miles away every morning.
The "offices" behind the factory
are large, sparsely furnished
rooms with canyon-like echoes.
One of the rules of the company,
Willis says, is that nothing is
ever thrown away — it's recy
cled and put back into use in
some other efficient way. As the
parlours are converted, so is the
furniture far from shiny and
new.
Watch its creation
One can stand outside the
windowand watch the icecream
being created. Nothing is hid
den, because there is nothing to
hide. The factory puts out 300
gallons a day, five gallons at a
time. It uses real old-fashioned
ice cream freezers, with rock salt
and crushed ice.
The process is outlined in the
aforementioned Old Uncle
Gaylord's Ice Cream Hook by
Willis and Ted Benhari. which is
available at all the parlours. It is
an interesting little indictment
of all that is wrong with ice
cream in America, which has
nurtured an unusual ice cream
culture, more than any other
country.
On the business side. Willis is
preparing Uncle Gaylord's Book
of Business, containing his for
mulas for survival in a deadly
busines world where profits play
King Kong to the common
good's Fay Wray.
"Business," says Willis, "is
the ability to enforce your will
on others by peaceful means."
The book is meant to provide a
contrast to theoreticians who.
according to Willis, are "full of
shit."
Unorthodox methods
Willis' rather unorthodox bus
iness methods are exemplified
by his employes. All of them
own a percentage of the com
pany. Although Willis is
middle-aged, 95 percent of the

partners are under 30, and one is
as young as 20 (kinda makes you
wonder what you're doing here,
doesn't it?).
At the stores, the employes
own as much as 40 percent, with
40 percent going to the partner
with the finances and 20 per
cent to Uncle Gaylord. Before
you jump to the conclusion that
Uncle Gaylord is getting shafted
on this deal, remember that he's
supplying the ice cream, so the
percentages all work out evenly.
This is opposed to franchises
which, says Willis, "don't be
nefit anyone but the fat cats."
Partnerships are given to long
time employes who have shown
management potential. Willis
shies away from middle class
offspring (that's us, kids) who
"don't know what hard work is,
and can't take it when the going
gets rough," which it often does.
A partner cannot expect to make
a profit for about five years, but
after that, it's smooth sailing.
The company uses no adver
tising other than word-of
mouth. It's one of those rare
things that doesn't need adver
tising. The Hershey Chocolate
Company didn't advertise until
it had been in business for 50
years. Uncle Gaylord's has its
customers Willis equates
people who have fallen in love
with his ice cream with religious
missionaries, who, with good
reason, rush around .fanatically
gathering converts.
Neighborhood atmosphere
For the stores, Willis prefers a
neighborhood atmosphere. He
and his partners usually get 20-
year leases and transform what
may have been anything from a
machine shop to a gas station
into a clean, homey place to
enjoy a rare delicacy — a
"wholesome product in a
wholesome environment." Wil
lis says.
In San Rafael, he and his
partners converted an old gas
station and its lot into a parlour
and garden, furnishing the city
with a park — after, believe it or
not, a lengthy fight with the
planning commission.
Gaylord Willis doesn't mind.
He thrives on challenge. He be
lieves that "a revolution starts
with one person and one idea." If
he can change a few people's
minds about the junk Americans
are consuming, he will be satis
fied.
In the meantime, it is not such
a bad idea to remember a sugges
tion from his book — "If you
can't pronounce it. don't eat it."


AT GAYLORD'S you get just desserts. No preservatives or artifi
rial ingredients are added to the home-style recipe.
