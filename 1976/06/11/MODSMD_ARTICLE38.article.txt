Half an hour south of Stanford is a new
amusement park called Marriott's Great
America. Open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. each
day, it offers $50 million worth of rides, re
staurants, craft shops, live shows and games.
The park is divided into five American his
torical theme areas: Hometown Square, Yukon
Territory, Yankee Harbor, Midwest County
Fair, and Orleans Place. Each has its own re
staurants, theaters and shops.
If publicity handouts can be believed, "more
than 385 shades, hues and tones were used in
painting the park," and 276,696 stuffed ani
mals will be given away this year as prizes in
the game arcades.
Visitors may find the price a little unusual â€”
adults are charged $7.05 and children (4-11)
pay $6.95. But all of the rides and entertain
ment inside are free.
The only drawback is waiting in line for the
more popular attractions like the Turn of the
Century roller coaster. However, its 90-foot
drop and double cork-screw are worth the
half-hour wait.
To get there, take highway 101 south to the
Great America Parkway exit and follow the
signs.
