# San Jose's Winchester House mystifies mortals
## 
### Carlin Chrisman 
Imagine climbing a staircase
that takes you up 44 steps and
makes seven winding turns, yet
rises a total of only nine feet. Or
opening doors that lead into the
wall. Or seeing a chimney that
stops four inches from the ceil
ing.
These are only the beginnings
of the countless oddities to be
found in the Winchester Mystery
House.
The 160-room mansion, lo
cated on six acres of land in San
)ose. was built at a cost of over
$5.5 million, according to tour
director Keith Kittle. It is one of

the most famous houses in the
world — famous for its exquisite
workmanship and famous for
the mysteries enshrouding it.
explanations of which are a mix
ture of legend and conjecture.
The most probably explana
tion of the mansion is a bizarre
and strangely sad tale of a wo
man's desperate effort to escape
evil spirits which she believed
caused the death of her husband
and daughter, says Kettle.
Safe from spirits
Sara Winchester's husband
was the son of the famous rifle
manufacturer. When he died of
tuberculosis in 1881. he lett her

with $20 million and a terror of
the spirits of those who were kil
led by the Winchester rifles.
Soon after her husband's
death, a seeress told her that she
would be safe from the spirits as
long as she continued a building
project.
The young widow moved
West and began building the
house in the early 1900s. It was
still not completed when she
died 38 years later. Day and
night, year after year, a team of
about 16 carpenters carried out
the instructions which she al
legedly received from the spirits
in her seance room every night.

The house which began as an
eight-room farmhouse mush
roomed into a 160-room.
seven-storv mansion. (The pre
sent structure has only four
stories, however, due to destruc
tion caused by the San Francisco
earthquake.)
The hour-long tour of the
house covers over a mile but
doesn't even begin to show all of
the rooms. Some of the oddities
that are shown during the tour
are the staircase that goes
straight up to the ceiling, win
dows which face brick walls,
skylights in the floors where
Winchester could spy on her

servants, the pantry cupboad
that is only an inch deep and the
room whose floor is made en
tirelv of trap doors.
Inlaid silver
The mansion is also a show
case for some of the most expen
siveand beautiful materials to be
assembled in one house. Kittle
savs. There are shi ni ng gold and
silver chandeliers, art glass win
dows from Tiffany's inlaid with
bronze and silver (valued at
$10.000 each), parquetry tloors
and French wallpaper.
Every kind of material tli.it
went into the building of the
house was the finest that money
could buy.
Not only is the Winchester
House a mystery, but tin l strange
and tormented owner is also a
puzzle to the more than one mill
ion people that have viewed her
home. The few people who knew
her said she was "eccentric but
not crazy." Kittle notes.
She always veiled her face and
scurried through the halls so that
no one would see her. Once,
when two of her servants acci
dentally encountered her with
out her veil, she dismissed them
— with a year's wages in their
pockets.

the Winchester Mystery House, like a stairway that goes nowhere
