# Local bars serve more than beer
## 
### George Powell 
Oh Lord, won't you buy me u
nigh! on the town - famous say
ing inscribed in the grooves of
many 455.
A night, or even an afternoon
on the town will cost the most
frugal Stanford student a few
bucks these days. But the prolif
eration of new drinking estab
lishments has made it less costly
to enjoy one.
It's still a good sweaty bike
ride to the Alpine Beer Gardens
on Alpine Road, Also known as
"Zot's," its outdoor table are oc
cupied by an eclectic crowd of
businessmen on long lunch
hours, students, dogs and people
who live in the hills of Fortola
Valley.
Picnic tables
Inside, a few pi nbal I machines
occupy those who don't like the
outdoors. A small space at the
bar and a few tables wait for
rainy days, but the bulk of the
crowd is usually in tin; spacious
beer garden, which consists of
many old picnic tables and
benches.
A compliment of dogs always
resides inside; and outside the
fence that encloses the outdoor
garden. The dogs are ac
complished beggars, getting
more meat a day than from a

six-pack of Alpo.
"I come up here to catch some
sun and drink some beer," said a
Stanford undergrad who re
quested anonymity. "I should
spend more time studying." he
said, and laughed. In his hand
was a plastic cup full of beer, a
Zot's trademark.
The Antique
Trademarks of a different kind
are plentiful at one of the newest
drinking spots near Stanford.
Antiques are the trademark of
the Antique Restaurant, which
serves plenty of beer, wine and
music to apredominantlyyoung
crowd.
On a recent weekend evening,
a guitarist performing that even
ing was heard to say, "There's a
lot of college coeds here," in a
matter-of-fact way.
Matter-of-fact is the way many
of the antiques are treated. Wait
ers carry them around and set
them up as if they were
aluminum folding chairs.
Enclosed booths take up much
of the restaurant area, leaving lit
tle space for the entertainers or
dancers. However, lack of space
doesn't seem to impede custom
ers or the waitresses, who even
tually get to everyone.
"It beats the Muzak at the
bank, and it's a lot looser here,"a

willowy waitress remarked as
she balanced a trayful of beer
bottles and glasses. Loose but
rustic seems to have made a suc
cess of this newest addition to
Stanford's drinking places.
Harder spirits
The Gatehouse, another new
spot, features harder spirits in
addition to wine and beer. It's
full of antiques, but they are
treated in a less cavalier fashion
than those in the Antique. Here
the mood is more subdued, even
dressy, although no special cos
tume is needed for admission to
the bar.
"This is the closest thing to
going to San Francisco," said a
dark-haired Stanford coed, en
joying a late-night libation. "It's
not nearly so raucous as some
other places," she continued,
"so it's more relaxing to come
here."
Indeed, everything is refined,
and it's not the place to come for
any whooping and hollering. It's
for quiet conversations and more
intimate moments. The bar, visi
ble from the street, always looks
neat and clean, and the seats al
ways seem to be occupied.
Beer heaven?
The closest, most talked-about
beer-drinkers haven (or is it
heaven?) is the Oasis, just over

the San F rancisquito creek in
Menlo Park. The sign is very
small for a place serving such a
large volume of beer and burgers.
At any time of the day burgers
are frying and beer is being
quaffed. In addition, there are
always a few under-21 types try
ing to bluff their way in without
proper identification.
But it's all part of the ambience
of the place, where generations
of Stanford students have left
calling cards carved in the
booths and tables. Carving is en
couraged. not frowned upon, so
when alums come back for their
10th or 25th reunion, they can
still locate the message they left
in their undergrad days.
Nothing is falling apart, but
everything is carved up and
looks well used. There is a small
outdoor garden, not nearly as
large as at Zot's, but it's burgers
and beer that people come to eat
and drink from miles around.
