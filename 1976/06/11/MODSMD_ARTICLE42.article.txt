# On local vintner tours
## Wine tasting a treat 
### Mary Ingersoll 
"Wine is constant proof that God loves to see us
happy."
That witticism by Benjamin Franklin hangs in
the tasting room of the Hrookside Winery, on El
(...amino Real in Mountain View. The Brookside
and other local wineries are proof that one doesn't
have to drive two hours to Napa Valley to visit
good wineries.
Brookside is a quiet, low-pressure winery: vis
itors are under no pressure to buy. but are encour
aged to browse; taste and ask questions.
Visitors may taste virtually anything they want,
except for the brandies, and manager Claude
Anisodon's friendliness and thorough knowledge
make Brookside a worthwhile trip.
Something for everyone
Brookside features over 100 varieties of wine,
which it sells through its own outlets, restaurants
or to churches for altar wines. This keeps the
prices down and the prices are extremely reason
able. The variety also means that there is some
thing for everyone; as wine-tasting host Michael
Miller says, "We make wine for everybody. No
matter what types you're looking for. here you can
find it."
And Brookside will buy back for 10 cents its old
half-gallon and gallon bottles for recycling — a
feature unique to that winery.
Brookside's estate wines are among its best.
These are original to Brookside. and one, called
"Guasti Chocolate," has won a gold medal at the
Los Angeles Fair.
Masson commercial
The Paul Masson Winery in Saratoga offers a
totally different experience from Mrookside. Its
operations are much bigger and cater to tourists,
and hence, are'much more commercial.
While the tour is excellent, Mason's tasting
room is not. In spite of the many varieties of
wines, only a few are available for tasting on any
given day — it depends on what type the winery
linens that day.
A little-known but wonderfully quaint winery
lies in the Los Gatos hills. Called the Novitiate, it
was founded in IHBB by Jesuit priests, who still do
much of the work.
The Novitiate is strictly a non-profit enterprise,
supplying altar wines for Catholic churches in the

U.S. and supporting retirement homes for old
priests.
The priests run a very small, personal opera
tion: their volume is about 1U5.()()() gallons a year
and they only makr- about 20 types of wine. But
visitors can taste as much as they like of anything
they like — with free breadstick's to make a light
meal.
And unlike the completely modern equipment
at Paul Masson. the Novitiate has a small, classic
wine cellar with old barrels in racks. One of their
larger barrels was recently sold to a man who built
a house from it.
Specialty truit wines
Bargetto's winery, in Soquel. offers a mixture of
the Italian family touch large factory operations.

Tours are informal — just ask.
I he tasting room is worth the hour's drive.
Senior wine counselor Pat Ballard handles the
always-busy room with remarkable dexterity;
every customer is given a completely organized
tour through wines, from "vin ordinaire" to
truit and dessert wine. \ isi tors can taste anything
but the most expensive wines.
Fruit wines are Bargetto's specialty. Made of
only "natural" ingredients, the cherry, straw
berry. honey, brambleberrv and olalliebeiry were
top prize winners in the 11)74 Los Angeles County
Fair. Another wine unique to Bargetto's is an ex
cellent red wine called Barbers.
Bargetto's volume runs about 150.000 gallons
yearly, and it only sells through its own outlets.
