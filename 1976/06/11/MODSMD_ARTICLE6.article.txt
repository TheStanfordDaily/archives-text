# Does that $22,000 diploma really help?

This year's Stanford graduates will
probably find it easier to secure
employment than will most '76college
graduates.
That is the conclusion of most
employers as well as career placement
administrators, in the Hay Area.
"In general, the overall reaction
from employers indicates a degree
from Stanford will mean a little more
than a degree from many other
schools." stated Dick Palomba. the
new director of the Career Planning
and Placement Center at the Univer
sity of San Francisco.
lie said this is because of the long
standing tradition of quality instruc
tion at Stanford, and because of "the
quality of people Stanford has turned
out in the past."
Easier job-hunting
Ralph Keller, director of the Stan
ford Career Planning and Placement
Center,agreed that it will be somewhat
easier for Stanford graduates to find
jobs than it will be for most other
graduates. "That's not my opinion,
that's fact." he claimed, citing evi
dence from past years.
He said that a recent study, con
ducted by the Western College Place
ment Association, asked employers
how Stanford students measured up to
their requirements compared with
students from other institutions.
"Stanford students measured up at the
highest levels." said Keller.
He also maintained that while edu
cational career placement was down
drastically last year on a nationwide
basis, it was up two-and-a-half percent
at Stanford.
According to the annual report of
the placement center, employment of
college graduates nationwide last year
was down about 1H pecent compared

to 1973-74. However, employment of
Stanford's candidates was down only
3.8 percent, and this decrease followed
several years of increasing employ
ment.
Degree helps
Most employers agreed that, while
being from Stanford will not be a de
termining factor, a Stanford applicant
may have a slight advantage over other
graduates.
"As far as the initial impression on
an employer is concerned, it helps
being from Stanford," claimed Joel
Lee, manager of the San Francisco
agency of The Prudential Life Insur
ance Company of America.
"We are generally more receptive of
Stanford graduates," he said. "They
might have more on the ball because
they had to have more on the ball to get
into Stanford in the first place.".
'Quality programs'
"You may get listened to,"
explained Judie Neetz, college recruit
ing coordinator for Hewlett-Packard,
"whereas if you weren't from Stanford,
you may not even be seen. It's not the
prestige that helps, it's the quality of
the programs at the school."
"If all things were equal between
two applicants, which never happens,
a Stanford applicant would have an
advantage because of the reputation
and curriculum of the school." stated
Robert Denison. personnel manager at
Ampex Corporation. He also said that
some employers (Amplex not in
cluded) have higher starting salaries if
their employes come from a "premium
school." Stanford is one of these
schools, he said.
Michael Davis, assistant vice presi
dent at Bank of America, said. "It
might be an advantage being from
Stanford because it's a quality school,"

but he added that it is not as pervading
a factor as it used to be. "Just being
from Stanford doesn't mean as much
as it used to."
Stanford grads may face one disad
vantage in that they got less practical
job training at Stanford. However,
most employers said this is only a
minor disadvantage.
'Good learners'
Davis mentioned that students from
other schools may not have to be
trained as much as Stanford students,
but added that. "People from Stanford
are generally good learners and highly
trainable."
"Stanford is a more theoretical
school and if I have a practical job, I
may not even go to Stanford," said A.J.
Barela. an employment representative
for IBM.
Edward Clements, director of the
San Jose State t Jniversity Career Plan
ning and Placement Center. said that
employers will have to make a value
judgment on what is more important: a
strong academic education from Stan
ford or a practical-oriented education
from another school.
"The Stanford label itself won't
mean that much to employers," stated
Clements. "What an individual has
gained from Stanford might."
Senior Mob DeCrasse said he felt
there is an advantage in being from
Stanford when looking for a job. "The
fact that we have tin? Career Planning
and Placement Center gives .in advan
tage in that employers are attracted to
Stanford through the placement
center."

Petersmeyer that her < redmitials were
impressive. She said she bel ieves that,

are generally good learners and highly

"Stanford is a more theoretical
school and if I have a practical job, I
may not even go to Stanford," said A.J.
Barela. an employment representative
for IBM.
Edward Clements, director of the
San Jose State t Jniversity Career Plan
ning and Placement Center. said that
employers will have to make a value
judgment on what is more important: a
strong academic education from Stan
ford or a practical-oriented education
from another school.
"The Stanford label itself won't
mean that much to employers," stated
Clements. "What an individual has
gained from Stanford might."
Senior Mob DeCrasse said he felt
there is an advantage in being from
Stanford when looking for a job. "The
fact that we have tin? Career Planning

This year's Stanford graduates will
probably find it easier to secure
employment than will most '76college
graduates.
That is the conclusion of most
employers as well as career placement
administrators, in the Hay Area.
"In general, the overall reaction
from employers indicates a degree
from Stanford will mean a little more
than a degree from many other
schools." stated Dick Palomba. the
new director of the Career Planning

lie said this is because of the long
standing tradition of quality instruc
tion at Stanford, and because of "the
quality of people Stanford has turned
out in the past."
Easier job-hunting
Ralph Keller, director of the Stan
ford Career Planning and Placement
Center,agreed that it will be somewhat
easier for Stanford graduates to find
jobs than it will be for most other
graduates. "That's not my opinion,
that's fact." he claimed, citing evi
dence from past years.
He said that a recent study, con
ducted by the Western College Place
ment Association, asked employers
how Stanford students measured up to
their requirements compared with
students from other institutions.
"Stanford students measured up at the
highest levels." said Keller.
He also maintained that while edu
cational career placement was down
drastically last year on a nationwide
basis, it was up two-and-a-half percent
at Stanford.
According to the annual report of
the placement center, employment of
college graduates nationwide last year
was down about 1H pecent compared

to 1973-74. However, employment of
Stanford's candidates was down only
3.8 percent, and this decrease followed
several years of increasing employ
ment.
Degree helps
Most employers agreed that, while
being from Stanford will not be a de
termining factor, a Stanford applicant
may have a slight advantage over other
graduates.
"As far as the initial impression on
an employer is concerned, it helps
being from Stanford," claimed Joel
Lee, manager of the San Francisco
agency of The Prudential Life Insur
ance Company of America.
"We are generally more receptive of
Stanford graduates," he said. "They
might have more on the ball because
they had to have more on the ball to get
into Stanford in the first place.".
'Quality programs'
"You may get listened to,"
explained Judie Neetz, college recruit
ing coordinator for Hewlett-Packard,
"whereas if you weren't from Stanford,
you may not even be seen. It's not the
prestige that helps, it's the quality of
the programs at the school."
"If all things were equal between
two applicants, which never happens,
a Stanford applicant would have an
advantage because of the reputation
and curriculum of the school." stated
Robert Denison. personnel manager at
Ampex Corporation. He also said that
some employers (Amplex not in
cluded) have higher starting salaries if
their employes come from a "premium
school." Stanford is one of these
schools, he said.
Michael Davis, assistant vice presi
dent at Bank of America, said. "It
might be an advantage being from
Stanford because it's a quality school,"

but he added that it is not as pervading
a factor as it used to be. "Just being
from Stanford doesn't mean as much
as it used to."
Stanford grads may face one disad
vantage in that they got less practical
job training at Stanford. However,
most employers said this is only a
minor disadvantage.

other schools may not have to be
trained as much as Stanford students,
