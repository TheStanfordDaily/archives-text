# Tight market causes shift
## Big business jobs becoming more acceptable 
### Janel Hopper 
Is big business an acceptable
employer? You may not t hi nk so.
but according to the Career
Planning and Placement Center
(CPPC) an increasing number ot
Stanford University graduting
seniors are entering the job mar
ket in business and industry.
I).I,. Wormley. assistant direc
tor of liberal arts career advising,
reported that the number ot lib
eial arts students interested in
business-related fields, such as
banking, finance, marketing,
management and sales, has
"mushroomed" since 1973. The
jump in economics majors and
the growing number of applic
ants to the Craduate School of
Business in recent years are
flirt her indicators of t ho Inisi ness
boom among Stanford students.
There has been a dramatic in
crease in tin; use of the place
ment center to check out busi
ness job possibilities. Meetings
designed to explain business
career choices have had record
attendance. Studented inter
vinwing with companies at the
CPPC reached a high of 8733 in
1074-75 with .117 companies —
the largest turnout since the
1007-08 academic year.
"Peoplearebeginning to (hi nk
about tho necessary skills to
enter the job market." Wormley
said.
As recently as 1908. student!-
were rejecting traditional
middle-class values, including
tin; prospects of a career with a
corporate enterprise. Big busi
ness was seen as linked to U.S.
involvement in Southeast
Asia.
Concerns shift
Currently, students at Stan
ford seem to have shifted their
concerns from social reform to
self-interest in careers. At the
same time, however, students in
terviewed indicated a strong in
clination to achieve a union be
tween personal values and feel

ings about careers with big
businesses.
Ralph Keller, director of
CPPC. said that 80 percent ol all
jobs arc; in business and indus
try. The economic recession has
forced students to take jobs
where they can find them. "A
student feels today that: 'I can
live in the world much better if I
act according to my own self
interest and at the same time try
to change things from the in
side.' " Ik; added. Keller said he
feels the current generation of
Stanford students is more prag
matic and less idealistic.
Steve Berthene is a senior
graduating in economics who
will soon join Continental drain
Co.. a major U.S. agribusiness,
as a grain merchandiser. With
nine months summer and part
time experience in city and state
agencies. Berthene stated that.
"I've become less entranced
with government agencies as a
means of accomplishing some
thing. and the fact I've studied
theagricultural set-up in Eastern
Europe has given me a more
positive reaction to U.S. busi
ness and the incentive ideology
on which it's based." Berthene
also remarked that he would not
go to work for a company if he
could not morally defend it.
'Flowers in face'
Nancy Stockholm, a graduat
ing senior, said she would go to
work for a big business, but be
cause of her interest in environ
mental studies she'll join the
Environmental Protection
Agency this summer. Stockholm
stated that she believes students
are entering business in order to
integrate themselves into the
decision-making positions
which can affect change. "No
longer art; we waving flowers in
the face of Hewlett-Packard and
Lockheed; we're getting into the
power structure and making de
cisions." she averred.
The sentiment of a sampling of

graduating seniors seems to he
supportive of big business, but
most say they've changed their
attitudes since they first came to
Stanford.
Keller stated that about 50
percent ol this year's liberal arts
graduates will enter business,
lie explained that many indus
trial organizations are hiring
persons with less education than
they required in the past. About
100 engineering students will
also enter business-related
fields, according lo Keller,
job market
Increasing acceptance of jobs
in big business seems to come
from many factors. An important
one is today's tight market for

jobs. Keller reports there are
more job opportunities in busi
ness than teaching, law and
medicine.
Some seniors said they plan to
work in business for a year or
two to improve their chances for
admission to graduate schools.
But as acceptance to graduate
programs becomes more and
more difficult, busi ness becomes
the only feasible alternative for a
majority of Stanford students
who wish to perpetuate the
lifestyle to which they're accus
tomed.
Present undergraduates were
not largely affected by the threat
ot the draft and the stigma of big
business involvement in the
Vietnam War. Declining public
ity ot defense contractor ac
tivities makes these corporations

somewhat more acceptable for
employment also.
Many seniors said they feel
that businesses have become
more socially conscious due to
anti-war. consumer and ecology
movements. A majority of those
interviewed, who plan to enter
business, expressed a desire to
work within business and com
pel it to be more socially con
cerned.
'Core of capita Ism'
On the other hand. Larry Lit
vak. a graduating senior and
member of the Alliance for Radi
cal Change (ARC,), who will
enter the Public Policy program
in the Harvard School of dov
ernment. condemns bigbusi ness
as the "core of the capitalist
structure." But. he said, he is
aware that Stanford students are

finding it more acceptable. Lit
vak said he believes that stu
dents are favoring business more
and more because "semi
authoritative forces" of the CPPC
as well as news ads. parents and
corporations encourage busi
ness goals.
Litvak. and ARC members,
dary Thorne and Terry Bright,
attribute the rise in Stanford
grads joining business to the
type student which the Univer
sity admits. "There is an em
phasis on admitting students
who are more likely to accept the
kind of job offered in the corpo
rate structure." Thorne stated.
According to a recent nation
wide study by the American
Council on Education, however,
the growing interest in business
at Stanford is characteristic of

the nation at large. The study
found that: "Business now is the
major field of study chosen by
the largest number of both male
and female undergraduates and
there is no close second."
Some Stanford students have
been business-directed since
they entered the University, like
John Crawford who will be
working towards his MBA at the
University of Chicago as well as
participating in the First Scholar
Program with the Frist National
Bank of Chicago after gradua
tion. Crawford, a math major,
said he is fascinated bv business,
because its "challenges are so
broad and diverse you can't even
define all of them. ... It appeals
to me, because I can't under
stand it all — 1 don't think any
body can."
