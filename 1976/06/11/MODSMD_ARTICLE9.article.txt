# Job opportunities vary for graduates
## PhDs compete for limited openings

Is a Ph.l), a guarantee of a liftime high-salary job? Not necessarily, as some of
today's recipients will verify. Some of the 4H7 men and women, the lowest
number of recipients since 1970. are experiencing anxiety and frustration in
their attempts to find jobs in their fields.
"Ph.D. graduates art; in many fields having considerable difficulty." accord
ing to Ralph Keller, director of Stanford's Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC). Although "we won't know until September." Keller said in
regards to the final statistics on placement, he predicted that the percentage
would be close to last years, when placement percentages were slightly down.
Keller said that the most difficult fields to find jobs in are the humanities and
social sciences.
While the number of jobs for engineering and science Ph.D.s has remained
relatively constant for tin; last lew years, the number of Ph.D.s in social sciences
and humanities has dropped. In somes fields, prospects arcs particularly grim.
Richard Ruiz will receives his Ph.D. in philosophy of education this fall. Hut
as tar as a job is cone:esrneel lie is unsure. "I don't have a firm job opening." Ruiz
said, [jointing to this two openings in the country and more than 100 applicants.
"Anybody in philosophy ol education should have a second specialty." he;
said. Nevertheless Ruiz remains optimistic. "I'm vesry hopeful." lies said.
Some departments, howesvesr. haves little or no difficulty finding jobs for their
doctoral candidates. "We haves beesn able to place all our s+tudesnts." said Lillian
Xabahon. an assistant in the; economic department. Economics majors, thes
fourth largesst department constituency in 1075. are quickly-absorbed into
government and industry jobs.
The most popular area of study for Ph.D.s by far is engineering. There were
Ll2 Ph.D.s conferred last year in the various arcsas of engineering with nearly
half of them in elesctrical engineering. Chemical and mechanical are the two
other popular esnginesesring degrees.
The School of Education also boasts of a solid record of placing its students.
Last vesar this School of Education graduated 47 Ph.D.s. second only to En
gineering. Somes of its doctorate students have encountered a situation exactly
opposite; to Ruiz'.
"I found a lot of jobs." said Concepcion Valdez-Love. who will receive her
Ph.D. in bilingual education this fall. She has turned down three jobs from
' California state schools to takes an assistant professorship at Stanford. She sees
threes assets in hesr favor: the gresat demand of bilingual education Ph.D.s.
contacts with influential people;, and the; names of hesr school. "Stanford helps."
shes maintained.
This year's total of 467 Ph.D. recipients represents a drop of 2H from last year
and 80 from thes a I l-times high of 507 in 1071. The number of Ph.D.s is correlated
to the; state of the esconomy and the: availability of jobs. There was a tremendous
rises in the prosperous 1000s from 234 in 1962 to 503 in 1969. The number

'Jobs are not plentiful so people are not
hurrying through. The number of reci
pients will decrease until the job situation
gets better.'

peaked in 1971 and lias declined steadily since then with the recession.
"Jobs are not plentiful so people are not hurrying through," explained Jane
Ladd of the Graduate Studies Division. The number ( 112 recipients will continue
to decrease, Ladd said, "until the job situation gets better."
Anot her noticeable trend is thegrowi ng number of women receiving Ph.D.s.
i'liere has been a steady increase from 2'A women, or nine percent of the total,
receiving I'll.I).s in 19(i7. to H9. or 17.2 percent of the total, last year.
However, it was not her being a woman that helped Valdez-Love the most.
She feels that her minority status was more of a plus. "Any Chicano going into
bilingual education is in great demand," she adds. Terrill Lautz, who will
receive his Ph.D. in history t his summer, agreed. "Affirmative Action Programs
have helped women and minorities." he said.
The doctoral candidate seeking a job is not short of resources. The candidate
notifies the Cll'PC! of his interest in job placement about a year in advance.
Throughout the year, the CPPC sends out the candidate's resume and looks for
openings. When an opening is found, the candidate is notified and contact with
the potential employer is established. In the meantime, the department itself
and the candidate's adviser are using their influence to try to help him out.
As far as permanent employment right here at Stanford goes, prospects are
slim. "It is very, very rare." said Zabahon, "there is no inbreeding." Most
departments are reluctant to hire their own Ph.D. students. Although occasi
nallv Stanford Ph.D.s are given temporary positions on the faculty here, "there
is not much chance of a permanent job." according to Lautz.
Kven though many experience frustration looking for jobs, Keller remains
optimistic. Stanford's placement rate has been "highly successsful" compared
to the national average. Of-the 12.1 of last year's engineering Ph.D.s. 102 found
employment and of the rest only six were still looking for jobs when last polled.
Hut to he one of those six can be very disheartening. James Civens received
v.is Ph.D. in medieval history in January, but has yet to find a job. "I've been
looking for two years." he said, but "this year has been very bad." He will go to
City University of New York undera Post Degree Fellowship next year and he
will work on his second book. But. he concedes, "there is no money in writing."
(livens is disillusioned but not bitter. He said that if he had the chance to
choose again, he would still opt for the Ph.D. "Even if I don't get the job." he
said. "I've got a lot out of it." Hut. he admits, "it is personally discouraging."

"Jobs are not plentiful so people are not hurrying through," explained Jane

i'liere has been a steady increase from 2'A women, or nine percent of the total,
receiving I'll.I).s in 19(i7. to H9. or 17.2 percent of the total, last year.
However, it was not her being a woman that helped Valdez-Love the most.
She feels that her minority status was more of a plus. "Any Chicano going into
bilingual education is in great demand," she adds. Terrill Lautz, who will
receive his Ph.D. in history t his summer, agreed. "Affirmative Action Programs
have helped women and minorities." he said.
The doctoral candidate seeking a job is not short of resources. The candidate
notifies the Cll'PC! of his interest in job placement about a year in advance.
Throughout the year, the CPPC sends out the candidate's resume and looks for
openings. When an opening is found, the candidate is notified and contact with
the potential employer is established. In the meantime, the department itself
and the candidate's adviser are using their influence to try to help him out.
As far as permanent employment right here at Stanford goes, prospects are
slim. "It is very, very rare." said Zabahon, "there is no inbreeding." Most
departments are reluctant to hire their own Ph.D. students. Although occasi
nallv Stanford Ph.D.s are given temporary positions on the faculty here, "there
is not much chance of a permanent job." according to Lautz.
Kven though many experience frustration looking for jobs, Keller remains
optimistic. Stanford's placement rate has been "highly successsful" compared
to the national average. Of-the 12.1 of last year's engineering Ph.D.s. 102 found
employment and of the rest only six were still looking for jobs when last polled.
Hut to he one of those six can be very disheartening. James Civens received
v.is Ph.D. in medieval history in January, but has yet to find a job. "I've been
looking for two years." he said, but "this year has been very bad." He will go to
City University of New York undera Post Degree Fellowship next year and he
will work on his second book. But. he concedes, "there is no money in writing."
(livens is disillusioned but not bitter. He said that if he had the chance to
choose again, he would still opt for the Ph.D. "Even if I don't get the job." he
said. "I've got a lot out of it." Hut. he admits, "it is personally discouraging."

Is a Ph.l), a guarantee of a liftime high-salary job? Not necessarily, as some of
today's recipients will verify. Some of the 4H7 men and women, the lowest

their attempts to find jobs in their fields.
"Ph.D. graduates art; in many fields having considerable difficulty." accord

Center (CPPC). Although "we won't know until September." Keller said in
regards to the final statistics on placement, he predicted that the percentage
would be close to last years, when placement percentages were slightly down.
Keller said that the most difficult fields to find jobs in are the humanities and
social sciences.
While the number of jobs for engineering and science Ph.D.s has remained
relatively constant for tin; last lew years, the number of Ph.D.s in social sciences
and humanities has dropped. In somes fields, prospects arcs particularly grim.

The doctoral candidate seeking a job is not short of resources. The candidate

Throughout the year, the CPPC sends out the candidate's resume and looks for

As far as permanent employment right here at Stanford goes, prospects are
slim. "It is very, very rare." said Zabahon, "there is no inbreeding." Most
departments are reluctant to hire their own Ph.D. students. Although occasi
nallv Stanford Ph.D.s are given temporary positions on the faculty here, "there
is not much chance of a permanent job." according to Lautz.
Kven though many experience frustration looking for jobs, Keller remains
optimistic. Stanford's placement rate has been "highly successsful" compared
to the national average. Of-the 12.1 of last year's engineering Ph.D.s. 102 found
employment and of the rest only six were still looking for jobs when last polled.
Hut to he one of those six can be very disheartening. James Civens received
v.is Ph.D. in medieval history in January, but has yet to find a job. "I've been
looking for two years." he said, but "this year has been very bad." He will go to
City University of New York undera Post Degree Fellowship next year and he
will work on his second book. But. he concedes, "there is no money in writing."
(livens is disillusioned but not bitter. He said that if he had the chance to
choose again, he would still opt for the Ph.D. "Even if I don't get the job." he
said. "I've got a lot out of it." Hut. he admits, "it is personally discouraging."

Is a Ph.l), a guarantee of a liftime high-salary job? Not necessarily, as some of
today's recipients will verify. Some of the 4H7 men and women, the lowest
number of recipients since 1970. are experiencing anxiety and frustration in
their attempts to find jobs in their fields.
"Ph.D. graduates art; in many fields having considerable difficulty." accord
ing to Ralph Keller, director of Stanford's Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC). Although "we won't know until September." Keller said in
regards to the final statistics on placement, he predicted that the percentage
would be close to last years, when placement percentages were slightly down.
Keller said that the most difficult fields to find jobs in are the humanities and
social sciences.
While the number of jobs for engineering and science Ph.D.s has remained
relatively constant for tin; last lew years, the number of Ph.D.s in social sciences
and humanities has dropped. In somes fields, prospects arcs particularly grim.
Richard Ruiz will receives his Ph.D. in philosophy of education this fall. Hut

said, [jointing to this two openings in the country and more than 100 applicants.
"Anybody in philosophy ol education should have a second specialty." he;
said. Nevertheless Ruiz remains optimistic. "I'm vesry hopeful." lies said.
Some departments, howesvesr. haves little or no difficulty finding jobs for their
doctoral candidates. "We haves beesn able to place all our s+tudesnts." said Lillian
Xabahon. an assistant in the; economic department. Economics majors, thes
fourth largesst department constituency in 1075. are quickly-absorbed into
government and industry jobs.
The most popular area of study for Ph.D.s by far is engineering. There were
Ll2 Ph.D.s conferred last year in the various arcsas of engineering with nearly
half of them in elesctrical engineering. Chemical and mechanical are the two
other popular esnginesesring degrees.
The School of Education also boasts of a solid record of placing its students.
Last vesar this School of Education graduated 47 Ph.D.s. second only to En
gineering. Somes of its doctorate students have encountered a situation exactly
opposite; to Ruiz'.
"I found a lot of jobs." said Concepcion Valdez-Love. who will receive her

This year's total of 467 Ph.D. recipients represents a drop of 2H from last year
