# Zeta Psi removal 'unlikely'

### Jan Miller 
Suspension of the Zeta Psi
(Zete) fraternity for the "trash
ing" of the Roble tennis courts
May 21 "is unlikely," according
to Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton.
Horton said that the Zetes as a
group are being held responsible
for the trashing incident, which
he believes is a violation of the
University's Fundamental Stan
dard.
"The tennis court incident is
wholly reprehensible" under the
Fundamental Standard, Horton
stated.
However, the Zete house will
not be held collectively respon
sible for the arrest of three Zete
pledges last May 11 in associa
tion with the preparations for the
Zete's annual luau, Horton said.
Horton said he will not com
plete his review of the Zetes
until he receives "all of the in
formation I'm expecting from
the Zetes," which is to include
what internal disciplinary ac
tion the Zetes intend to take.
Zete president Brian Avery
said that the Zetes "turned most
of it (their response) in" last
Tuesday.
The three-year suspension of
the Delta Tau Delta fraternity
will have no effect on Horton's
judgement of the Zete incident,
said Horton, who asserted that
he is treating the two cases as
entirely "separate incidents."
Horton said that there is "no
end time line" on the matter, al
though he hopes to complete his
review by the middle of this
week. Horton plans to leave the
University at the end of this
week for a one year sabbatical,
and Asst. Dean of Student Af
fairs Norm Robinson will be
come acting associate dean in
his absence.
If Horton leaves before the
situation is resolved, Robinson
will make the final decision.
