# Board won't admit a student trustee
## 
### Pan Demetrakakes 
Students should not serve on
the Board of Trustees because
they represent a special-interest
group, the board ruled unanim
ously June 11.
Board Chairman Robert Minge
Brown, who will relinquish his
office on July 1, notified the
Council of Presidents (COP) of
the decision in a letter dated
June 15.
The letter stated, "The Board
strongly believes that maintain
ing a position of detached con
cern is essential if it is to dis
charge its trust and to do so it is
essential for members of the
Board to come to it as individu
als and not as representatives of
an interest or constituency."
The letter noted that although
a growing number of colleges
and universities now have stu
dent trustees, "what may be ap
propriate for those institutions is
not necessarily so for Stanford."
The request for a student trus
tee was made in April by the
COP, then headed by Lee Rosen
baum.
Deric Jennings, a member of
the current COP, said that al
though the COP has not yet had
time to take an official stand on
the matter of a student trustee,
"we're probably not going to

pursue it."
Jennings indicated that he ag
reed with the board's reasoning.
"It seems that the only way a
student can get on the board now
is as an alumnus, and the reason
for it is that the trustees should
be making decisions with no
special interest involved," he
said.
Jennings added that although
the COP has not discussed the
issue in epth, "my present feel
ing is that the COP is skeptical
that a student member could
make that much difference."
He pointed out that all stand
ing committees of the boad have
student members.
"Since the Board of Trustees
generally rubber stamps deci
sions made by the committees,
it's in the committees that you
have the power, and 1 don't feel
that a student member on the
Board of Trustees proper could
achieve that much," he com
mented.
The rejection of student mem
bership came at the end of the
academic year because the Board
of Trustees did not meet in May,
according to Frederic Glover,
secretary to the board.
A similar appeal for a student
trustee was rejected by the board
in 1969.
