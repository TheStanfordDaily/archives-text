No SJC decision on band
Charges that two Stanford Band members viol
ated the Campus Disruption Policy have not yet
been acted upon, according to Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC) faculty co-chairman Jonathan
Casper.
Ellen King, a law school graduate who has
served as defense counsel for Kent Blumberg and
Jim Jett of the band, said the SJC has probably
already reached a decision.
"It's my understanding that they've arrived at a
decision. They just haven't written it down," she
said.
The case stems from an incident on May 24
when about 50 band members and the Dollies
performed in Meyer Library for about five mi

nutes.
"We're in the process of coming out with an
opinion that we'll recommend to the president
(Richard Lyman)," Caspersaid.
