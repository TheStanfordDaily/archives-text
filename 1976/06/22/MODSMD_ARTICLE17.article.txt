# Women netters miss national title by a point
## Hagey and Morrison win doubles crown 
### Dave Smith 
Freshman Diane Morrison and
Susie Hagey captured the na
tional collegiate doubles champ
ionship, but the Stanford wo
men's tennis team still came up
one point short in last week's na
tional collegiate championships
in Salt Lake City.
Suffering the same fate as this
year's Cardinal men's team, the
women netters finished national
runners-up, one point behind
the winners. Defending champ
ion Trinity University, which
had shared the top national rank
ing with the Cards all season,
lost its singles and doubles
championships but scored 32
points, enough to win the team
title.
Three freshmen on the Cards'
five-women team helped make
this year's tournament nothing
like last year's Trinity runaway.
Hagey and Morrison, both top

ranked junior players from
Southern California, entered the
tournament as the Cards' second
doubles team, third-seeded
overall.
Upset Tigers
Advancing easily to the semi
finals. they upset Trinity's top
pair, Sandy Stap and Stephanie
Tolleson, and then scored a
straight-set win over Paula
Smith and Cindy Thomas of
UCLA. The two freshmen be
came the first Stanford women
since 1967 to win a national title.
The third Stanford freshman,
Barb Jordan, was left out of the
singles lineup after a series of
challenge matches conducted by
Stanford coach Anne Hill. But
Jordan teamed with the Cards'
top singles player. Lele Forood.
to form the top-seeded doubles
team. They got as far as the semi
final before falling in three sets
to Smith and Thomas.whom they

had defeated easily two weeks
before.
Fourth-round blues
If the Cards had done as well
in singles, they would have won
the tournament. But. just as the
Stanford men had done in May,
all the Card women advanced to
the round of 16 — and then were
all eliminated by the semifinal
round.
Junior Macy O'Keefe, with
Forood one of only two veterans
of last year's runner-up Stanford
team, won her first three
matches before falling to Trini
ty's Stap. 6-3, 0-6, 0-6.
Hagey, who had played sec
ond singles for Stanford during
the last half of the season, also
reached the round of 16 where
she was upset by unseeded Caro
lyn Ishii of UC-Davis.
Big surprise
Morrison's play was the most
pleasant surprise for the Cards.
Hailed as the best black woman
player since Althea Gibson, she
had started slowly in the spring.
But in May she won a national
tournament sponsored by Se
venteen magazine, and she
stayed hot in last week's play.
She advanced to the quarterfinal
round, where she lost a close
match to the eventual singles
champion, Barb Hallquist of
use.
When Trinity's Mary Hamm
knocked off Forood, last year's
national runner-up and Pan
American Games champion.
Trinity clinched the title, since it
had three of the four singles
semifinalists.
But Stephanie Tolleson, last
year's winner, fell to Hamm,
who lost the final to Hallquist.
And after Hagey and Morrison
had won their title, that left the
Cards just one point behind.
Such a near miss by a team
with no seniors in the Jineup
should be an encouraging sign
for future seasons, however.
Four of Trinity's players were
seniors, and Tolleson. a sopho
more. may turn professional this
summer.
USC and UCLA, the third- and
fourth-place teams, finished far
behind the Cards, so Stanford
will almost surely be favored to
escape the runner-up spot next
season.
Tennis notes: Stanford senior
Gene Mayer qualified for the
Wimbledon tournament, only to
lose in the first round yesterday
to Alex Metreveli of Russia. 2-6,
0-5 retired. Former Stanford
players in the All-England

Tournament include Jim De
laney, Chico, Hagey. Sandy
Mayer and Roscoe Tanner. . .
All five players on the Cards'
national runner-up women's
team were named All -
Americans. Four Card men were
earlier named to the All-America
team, giving Stanford nine of the
50 men and women players
named...
Recent graduate Fat DuPre
won the Birmingham Tennis

Classic in his home state of
Alabama Sunday, defeating
Charlie Owens, 7-6, 6-1. . .
Three top high-school tennis
players have signed letters of in
tent to attend Stanford next sea
son. They are Jim Hodges of
Chevy Chase, Md., Lloyd Bourne
of Pasadena and Peter Reunert of
Creat Neck, N.Y. Men's coach
Dick Gould says Hodges, the
lOth-ranked national junior, has
a good chance to break into the
starting lineup next spring.

team. They got as far as the semi
final before falling in three sets
to Smith and Thomas.whom they

had defeated easily two weeks
before.
Fourth-round blues
If the Cards had done as well
in singles, they would have won
the tournament. But. just as the
Stanford men had done in May,
all the Card women advanced to
the round of 16 — and then were
all eliminated by the semifinal
round.
Junior Macy O'Keefe, with
Forood one of only two veterans
of last year's runner-up Stanford
team, won her first three
matches before falling to Trini
ty's Stap. 6-3, 0-6, 0-6.
Hagey, who had played sec
ond singles for Stanford during
the last half of the season, also
reached the round of 16 where
she was upset by unseeded Caro
lyn Ishii of UC-Davis.
Big surprise
Morrison's play was the most
pleasant surprise for the Cards.
Hailed as the best black woman
player since Althea Gibson, she
had started slowly in the spring.
But in May she won a national
tournament sponsored by Se
venteen magazine, and she
stayed hot in last week's play.
She advanced to the quarterfinal
round, where she lost a close
match to the eventual singles
champion, Barb Hallquist of
use.
When Trinity's Mary Hamm
knocked off Forood, last year's
national runner-up and Pan
American Games champion.
Trinity clinched the title, since it
had three of the four singles
semifinalists.
But Stephanie Tolleson, last
year's winner, fell to Hamm,
who lost the final to Hallquist.
And after Hagey and Morrison
had won their title, that left the
Cards just one point behind.
Such a near miss by a team
with no seniors in the Jineup
should be an encouraging sign
for future seasons, however.
Four of Trinity's players were
seniors, and Tolleson. a sopho
more. may turn professional this
summer.
USC and UCLA, the third- and
fourth-place teams, finished far
behind the Cards, so Stanford
will almost surely be favored to
escape the runner-up spot next
season.
