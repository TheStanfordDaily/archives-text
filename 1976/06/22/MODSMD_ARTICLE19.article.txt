medalist, was appointed to the position of assis
tant swimming coach. Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
announced last week.
The 23-year old former Arden Hills coach will
assist head coach Jim Gaughran with both the
men's and women's teams.
"Debbie is one of the greatest swimmers of all
time," Ruetz said, "and she's also proven herself
to be a very fine coach. Obviously, we feel she'll be
a tremendous asset to our swimming program."
In the 1968 Olympic Games, she became the
first swimmer — male or female — to win three
individual gold medals. Her victories came in the
200. 400 and 800 meter freestyles.

Individually, freshman outfielder Larry
Reynolds shattered a 23-year old Stanford record
by stealing 38 bases in 1976. He broke the former
season record of 25 thefts, set by All-American
shortstop Warren Goodrich in 1953.
Shortstop Steve Davis, a four-year starter, set
four individual career records. Davis took over as
Stanford's all-time leader in total games (214), at
bats (772), runs (141) and hits (237).
