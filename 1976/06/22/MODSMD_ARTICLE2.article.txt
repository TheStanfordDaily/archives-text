# Lyons upholds Delt suspension
## 
### Kit Warfield 
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons has upheld the decision
by Assoc. Dean of Student Af
fairs Larry Horton to suspend the
Delta Tau Delta (Delt) fraternity
from its on-campus residence for
three years.
The suspension stemmed
from a May 19 incident when 15
Delts and 12 friends trashed four
other fraternity houses after a
bachelor party for a Delt at the
Delt house.
In a letter to former Delt presi
dent Kevin McDermott released
yesterday, Lyons said "I concur
with the decision to deny resi
dence privileges to Delta Tau
Delta for three consecutive years
beginning with Autumn 1976."
McDermott has been the prim
ary spokesman for the Delts in
requesting a review of Horton's
determination.
Lyons added, however, that he
may consider the possibility of
an earlier reinstatement, with a
number of conditions.
"Because of the positive signs
seen in the interest de
monstrated by alumni, faculty,
the Inter-Fraternity Council and
some active members," said
Lyons, "I am willing to entertain
a petition for reinstatement for
the Autumn 1977 quarter."
This decision would be made

"only if we are convinced that
the past patterns of behavior will
have been completely elimi
nated," the letter continued.
A letter with 485 signatures
presented to Lyons on June 1
protested that "actions . . taken
by the (Delt) house (against its
members involved in the inci
dent) were not given the proper
level of consideration" by Hor
ton when he made his decision.
McDermott had written a let-

ter to Horton explaining that the
Delts had "expel(led) three
members because of their ac
tions, fine(d) three more,
and . . . put everyone who par
ticipated on a probationary
period with a suspended fine."
Lyons was also asked to con
sider the fairness of rendering a
judgment on the Delts which af
fects many who had little or no
thing to do with the incident.
Lyons made it clear in his let
ter upholding the decision that
the University considers the
trashing a "collective responsi
bility" of the fratejnity.
"Collective responsibility
means that an organized group is
responsible in part for the ac
tions of its individual mem
bers," said the letter. "The
fraternity is responsible for what
emanates from the house as well
as what transpires in it." Lyons
added, "I believe that the notion
of collective responsibility does
apply to the May 19 'patrol.' "
No discrimination
Lyons also emphasized that
the University will not discrimi
nate against Delts in terms of
other on-campus housing.
The letter said that "no

member of Delta Tau Delta is
being denied the opportunity to
seek other on-campus housing.
Those covered by the Guaran
teed Housing Plan will have
their remaining guaranteed
years honored in the draw sys
tem. They may also seek housing
in other fraternities that still
have space available."
In order for the Delt house to
"return (after one year) to the
status of a resident fraternity
committed to the educational
and fraternal goals on which it
was founded" Lyons set a
number of criteria.
