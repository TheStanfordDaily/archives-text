# Lyons upholds Delt suspension
## 
### Kit Warfield 
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons has upheld the decision
by Assoc. Dean of Student Af
fairs Larry Horton to suspend the
Delta Tau Delta (Delt) fraternity
from its on-campus residence for
three years.
The suspension stemmed
from a May 19 incident when 15
Delts and 12 friends trashed four
other fraternity houses after a
bachelor party for a Delt at the
Delt house.
In a letter to former Delt presi
dent Kevin McDermott released
yesterday, Lyons said "I concur
with the decision to deny resi
dence privileges to Delta Tau
Delta for three consecutive years
beginning with Autumn 1976."
McDermott has been the prim
ary spokesman for the Delts in
requesting a review of Horton's
determination.
Lyons added, however, that he
may consider the possibility of
an earlier reinstatement, with a
number of conditions.
"Because of the positive signs
seen in the interest de
monstrated by alumni, faculty,
the Inter-Fraternity Council and
some active members," said
Lyons, "I am willing to entertain
a petition for reinstatement for
the Autumn 1977 quarter."
This decision would be made

"only if we are convinced that
the past patterns of behavior will
have been completely elimi
nated," the letter continued.
A letter with 485 signatures
presented to Lyons on June 1
protested that "actions . . taken
by the (Delt) house (against its
members involved in the inci
dent) were not given the proper
level of consideration" by Hor
ton when he made his decision.
McDermott had written a let-

ter to Horton explaining that the
Delts had "expel(led) three
members because of their ac
tions, fine(d) three more,
and . . . put everyone who par
ticipated on a probationary
period with a suspended fine."
Lyons was also asked to con
sider the fairness of rendering a
judgment on the Delts which af
fects many who had little or no
