## The 						real Henry 'Fonzie' Winkler 
### Howard Baldwin 
"If I wasn't an actor, I would be
a child psychologist" â€” Henry
"Fonzie" Winkler, from ABC's
Happy Days.
Winkler would have made an
outstanding child psychologist.
At a recent ninety-minute press
conference for the under-21
journalism set, Winkler handled
himself and his interviewers
with patience, charm and an in
destructable sense of humor. I
have never seen any actor sub
ject himself to questions that
ranged from the repetitive to the
embarrassing for so long, prov
ing Winkler's patience. He may
very well be the most impressive
interviewee I've ever had the
privilege of seeing in action.
Winkler relates to children,
from the lofty plateau of age 30,
yet. He spends some of his free
time visiting juvenile halls. The
show Happy Days is in the top
ten because of the charismatic
character of Arther "Fonzie"
Fonzarelli. Asked why the show
is a success, Winkler sparkled, "I
attribute the success to the fact
that I am really a cutie." Then,

turning serious, he analyzed its
popularity. "I attribute it to the
fact that we have a fast and funy
show ... a family show .. . ab
out the universality of growing
up," no matter in what time
period it takes place.
Winkler took great pains to
stress the difference between
himself and the Fonz. "Arthur
Fonzarelli is my imagination.
When I present myself as Henry,
you can see that I'm different.
My life does not imitate my art.
My art imitates my life."
Dressed in contemporary,
comfortable clothing, along
with a modern hairstyle and a
moustache, Winkler was almost
unrecognizable at first. Other
contrasts are equally striking.
The Fonz is a drop-out. Winkler
is, in his own words, "a cultured
mutha," having gone to Yale for
four years, followed by three ad
ditional years to earn a Master's
Degree in drama. He emphasized
that students should stay in
school and not try acting, espe
cially because "to act you have to
have lived."
The Fonz drives a motorcycle.
Winkler, in his generous way,
answered the question. What do
you drive?, with "I drive an Audi
100 LS. I use regular gas."
asked how he relates to Fon
zie, Winkler answered, "We
make out sometimes." And as for
all his success as the Fonz,
Winkler states, "What you have
to keep in proportion is that
you're not what they think you
are.
"My overall theme for the
Fonz is, 'You can be cool, but it's
got to come from integrity.' No
matter what bravado he has
going for him, he's got some
humanity in him. It is my job. It
is not my life."
As for the future, Winkler said
he had rejected offers of his own
series and wanted to do feature
films. He has been on Happy
Days for two years. "If I played
the same character for nine
years, I'd be typecast. After two
more years, I'll take my marbles
and go home."
In a likable, unegotistical way,
Winkler described his early
schooling with a charming sense
of both humor and timing. "I
played a mushroom in nursery
school. I was so good that I re
created the part in first grade."

Later. "I wore a blue blazer and
gray slacks. 1 was a 'preppie'. A
teacher once said to me, 'Wink
ler, if you ever get out of here,
you'll be okay. Of course, after 1
left, the school went co-ed."
His idols at the moment, he
are "people who make
music," Pheobe Snow and Paul
Simon especially. He has no
hobbies, because "at this mo
ment, I don't have time for a
hobby. I'm a workaholic." He
did mention that he'd just read
Ragtime by E.L. Doctorow, and
highly recommended it. His
favorite actors, who reveal his
cultured tastes, are Alec Guin
ness, Robert DeNiro, Robert
Duvall and Marlon Brando.
As for his own experience in
films, he calls his appearance in
the television movie Katherirte
his "finest moment on cel
luloid."On his theatrical film,
The Lords Of Flatbush, Winkler
says, "We worked a thirty-hour
week on the streets of New York
on a shoestring budget. I had
cold cups of soup for lunch. We
wrapped ourselves in sound
blankets for warmth. I would do
it again. The finished product,
though, I am not proud of."
