"If I wasn't an actor, I would be
a child psychologist" â€” Henry
"Fonzie" Winkler, from ABC's
Happy Days.
Winkler would have made an
outstanding child psychologist.
At a recent ninety-minute press
conference for the under-21
journalism set, Winkler handled
himself and his interviewers
with patience, charm and an in
destructable sense of humor. I
have never seen any actor sub
ject himself to questions that
ranged from the repetitive to the
embarrassing for so long, prov
ing Winkler's patience. He may
very well be the most impressive
interviewee I've ever had the
privilege of seeing in action.
Winkler relates to children,
from the lofty plateau of age 30,
yet. He spends some of his free
time visiting juvenile halls. The
show Happy Days is in the top
ten because of the charismatic
character of Arther "Fonzie"
Fonzarelli. Asked why the show
is a success, Winkler sparkled, "I
attribute the success to the fact
that I am really a cutie." Then,

turning serious, he analyzed its
popularity. "I attribute it to the
fact that we have a fast and funy
show ... a family show .. . ab
out the universality of growing
up," no matter in what time
period it takes place.
Winkler took great pains to
stress the difference between
himself and the Fonz. "Arthur
Fonzarelli is my imagination.
When I present myself as Henry,
you can see that I'm different.
My life does not imitate my art.
My art imitates my life."
Dressed in contemporary,
comfortable clothing, along
with a modern hairstyle and a
moustache, Winkler was almost
unrecognizable at first. Other
contrasts are equally striking.
The Fonz is a drop-out. Winkler
is, in his own words, "a cultured
mutha," having gone to Yale for
four years, followed by three ad
ditional years to earn a Master's
Degree in drama. He emphasized
that students should stay in
school and not try acting, espe
cially because "to act you have to
have lived."
