# Eclectic jazz at the Paramount
## Jarrett shows artistic brilliance 
### Perry Simon 
The audience at Oakland's Paramount
Theatre was a particularly discriminat
ing group, characterized by sophisti
cated and eclectic musical tastes. But
their sophistication was mprely a hum
ble tribute to the awesome talents of the
evening's star performer, pianist and
composer Keith Jarrett.
Jarrett's performance ten days ago
marked a high-point in the attempts of
San Francisco's Fine Arts Development
to live up to its name. Just as this promo
tional group brought the finest in profes
sional ballet to the Bay Area in the form
of the American Ballet Theatre, Fine Arts
Development did a great service to all
music-lovers lucky enough to attend the
sold-out Jarrett concert by presenting
this unique artist in a rare local appear
ance.
The concert marked the West Coast

premiere of newly composed music for
piano and string orchestra by Jarrett. The
music, titled "Arbour Zena," had previ
ously been performed in Minneapolis
and in Europe with the Stuttgart String
Orchestra.
At the Paramount, Jarrett performed
with his trio, consisting of Charles
Haden on contra bass and Jan Garbarek
on tenor and soprano saxophones. The
trio was augmented by a string ensemble
from the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra
led by Paul Shure, the orchestra's con
certmaster.
Diverse but coherent
"Arbour Zena" was a rich blend of
classical, swing, and jazz motifs. The
music was diverse, but coherent. It slid
from one style to another, with the lyrical
swing tunes punctuating the often dis
cordant jazz interludes. The entire trio
and orchestra surged back and forth with

Jarrett. but the pianist was as clearly in
control of the concert as his piano was
dead-center stage.
The audience's energy was simultane
ously divided between admiration of Jar
rett's technical mastery and empathy
with his emotional expressiveness.
Toward the close of the first half, Jar
rett's keyboard artistry came to the fore as
his arms literally cascaded down upon
the piano keys, appearing like the
tenades of a raving mad octopus.
Throughout the concert he would stand,
gesticulate, grimace, and cringe, but his
movements were not for show. One
could sense the physical movement
transcent itself into musical emotion.
Steady bass
Bass player Charles Haden provided a
steady undercurrent, tending to tie to
gether Jarrett's complex and diverse

styles. Though his solo was a tedious
interlude, his bass protruded through the
musical patchwork in a melodic and
satisfying manner.
Jan Garbarek. a Norwegian appearing
in his first American concert tour, was
excellent on the tenor saxophone. His
tenor sax solo was one of the highpoints
of the concert, and the rest of his tenor
sax performance admirably com
plemented Jarrett's piano. However,
Garbarek could not handle the higher re
gisters of the soprano sax. Many soprano
sax notes that were clearly written to
shine through brilliantly sounded weak
and strained, and the entire score suf
fered because of them.
The audience reaction was ecstatic,
despite Jarrett's haughty air and preten
tious comments. Apparently, the crowd
believed that this temperament befitted
such an avant garde artistic genius.

of the American Ballet Theatre, Fine Arts
Development did a great service to all
music-lovers lucky enough to attend the
sold-out Jarrett concert by presenting
this unique artist in a rare local appear
ance.
The concert marked the West Coast

premiere of newly composed music for
piano and string orchestra by Jarrett. The
music, titled "Arbour Zena," had previ
ously been performed in Minneapolis
and in Europe with the Stuttgart String
Orchestra.
At the Paramount, Jarrett performed
with his trio, consisting of Charles
Haden on contra bass and Jan Garbarek
on tenor and soprano saxophones. The
trio was augmented by a string ensemble
from the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra
led by Paul Shure, the orchestra's con
certmaster.
Diverse but coherent
"Arbour Zena" was a rich blend of
classical, swing, and jazz motifs. The
music was diverse, but coherent. It slid
from one style to another, with the lyrical
swing tunes punctuating the often dis
cordant jazz interludes. The entire trio
and orchestra surged back and forth with

Jarrett. but the pianist was as clearly in
control of the concert as his piano was
dead-center stage.
The audience's energy was simultane
ously divided between admiration of Jar
rett's technical mastery and empathy
with his emotional expressiveness.
Toward the close of the first half, Jar
rett's keyboard artistry came to the fore as
his arms literally cascaded down upon
the piano keys, appearing like the
tenades of a raving mad octopus.
Throughout the concert he would stand,
gesticulate, grimace, and cringe, but his
movements were not for show. One
could sense the physical movement
transcent itself into musical emotion.
Steady bass
Bass player Charles Haden provided a
steady undercurrent, tending to tie to
gether Jarrett's complex and diverse

styles. Though his solo was a tedious
interlude, his bass protruded through the
musical patchwork in a melodic and
satisfying manner.
Jan Garbarek. a Norwegian appearing
in his first American concert tour, was
excellent on the tenor saxophone. His
tenor sax solo was one of the highpoints
of the concert, and the rest of his tenor
sax performance admirably com
plemented Jarrett's piano. However,
Garbarek could not handle the higher re
gisters of the soprano sax. Many soprano
sax notes that were clearly written to
shine through brilliantly sounded weak
and strained, and the entire score suf
fered because of them.
The audience reaction was ecstatic,
despite Jarrett's haughty air and preten
tious comments. Apparently, the crowd
believed that this temperament befitted
such an avant garde artistic genius.
The audience at Oakland's Paramount
Theatre was a particularly discriminat
ing group, characterized by sophisti
cated and eclectic musical tastes. But
their sophistication was mprely a hum
ble tribute to the awesome talents of the
evening's star performer, pianist and
composer Keith Jarrett.
Jarrett's performance ten days ago
marked a high-point in the attempts of
San Francisco's Fine Arts Development
to live up to its name. Just as this promo
tional group brought the finest in profes
sional ballet to the Bay Area in the form
of the American Ballet Theatre, Fine Arts
