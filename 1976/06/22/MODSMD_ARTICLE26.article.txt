Christian Democrats win Italy
ROME—The ruling Christian Demo
cratic Party won Italy's closest post-war
election yesterday, but the Communist
Party scored huge gains which will
probably assure it a share in the country's
new government.
With more than 86 percent of the vote
counted, the Christian Democrats held a
four percent lead over the Communists
in the most important race, that for the
chamber of deputies.
But the Christian Democrats were
gaining only 39 percent of the vote,
probably not enough to assure them
power without including the Com
munists.
Leaders of the Socialist Party, the
third-place finishers in the election with
about 10 percent of the vote, said they
would not enter any government unless
the Communists were included.
The Christian Democrats recorded a
clear-cut victory in the race for Senate
seats. The ruling party has controlled the
Senate for three decades, but maneuver
ing in the chamber of deputies will de
cide the shape of the Italian government.
A spokesman for Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger said he would make no
direct comment on the elections. But in
an address to the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Develop
ment in Paris yesterday, Kissinger
warned that Western industrialized na
tions were being victimized by com
munist nations and by third-world gov
ernments.
Officials of the Catholic Church had
been among the most vocal opponents of
the Communists in the election cam
paigns. Pope Paul VI made no comment
on the elections last night, but in a
speech marking the 1 Jth anniversary of
his papacy he warned that communist
regimes in other parts of the world had
closed off Christians from the Roman
Catholic Church.
More riots in South Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa-
New violence broke out in South Africa
yesterday after a weekend of relative
calm Black rioting spread to the area of

Pretoria, the nation's capital, and mobs
burned three schools, a hospital and ad
ministration buildings in the black
township of Mabupane.
Police fired into the mobs and killed at
least two blacks, bringing the death toll
in five days of violence to 139. At least 41
of the dead were killed by police, and
many others died in "drunken brawls,
according to South African officials. All
but two of the dead were blacks.
Insurance companies said the damage
in last week's rioting amounted to more
than 34 million dollars. Over 1100 per
sons have been injured so far in the riot
ing, which has caused the South African
army to be put on a full alert.
South African Prime Minister John
Vorster met with his ambassadors yes
terday to determine global reaction to the
violence. Vorster plans to meet with U.S.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to
morrow to discuss the South African
situation.
New judge in Hearst case
SAN FRANCISCO—U.S. District
Judge William Orrick Jr. has been named
to take over the bank robbery case of
newspaper heiress Patty Hearst. Orrick
replaces Oliver Carter, the trial judge
who had ordered a 90-day psychiatric
examination of Hearst. Carter died last
week.
Carter had said he would reduce his
sentence, which gave Hearst the
maximum penalty of 35 years in prison,
after he read the psychiatric report on
her. Now final sentencing will be in the
hands of Orrick.
Meanwhile in Los Angeles yesterday,
jury selection got under way in the kid
nap and robbery trial of former Sym
bionese Liberation Army members Wil
liam and Emity Harris. Hearst is named
as co-defendant in the case, which in
volves 11 counts of assault, kidnap and
robbery.

Lebanon truce-keepers
BEIRUT—Two battalions of Syrian
and Lebanese troops flying white flags
rolled into Lebanon's capital city yester
day in a truck convoy and separated bat
tle lines at the battered, looted airport in
a new truce in Lebanon's civil war.
A roar of machine-gun and anti
aircraft fire shot into the air to celebrate
the arrival of the troops, the vanguard of
an all-Arab army to enforce Lebanon's
39th truce in 14 months of civil war. Pre
sently there are over 16.000 Syrian
troops in the country.
Despite the arrival of the truce-keeping
force, new fighting broke out yesterday
between Moslem and Christian forces in
Lebanon's "traditional war," which first
prompted Syrian intervention.
Refugees fleeing the country aboard
the U.S.S. Spiegel Grove arrived last
night at a Greek port near Athens. The
ship carried 263 people, many of them
Americans, evacuated under U.S. Navy
supervision.
No troops for Philadelphia
HARRISBURG, Pa. —Pennsylvania
governor Milton Shapp said today that
he would not ask for Federal troops or
call out the national guard to provide
security for Philadelphia during the July
4 celebration.
Shapp thus denied a request by
Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo, who
claimed the city could become a
"battleground" between extremists and
police during the celebration of the na
tion's bicentennial.
Shapp's decision followed an an
nouncement from Washington that Fed
eral officials were not convinced Rizzo
needed 15.000 Army troops to protect
the city and its visitors from de
monstrators.

Panama wants U.S. out
PANAMA ClTY—Panamanian
Foreign Minister Aquilino Boyd said
yesterday that his country wants the Un
ited States out of the Canal Zone by the
year 2000. At a meeting of the Organiza
tion of American States, Boyd gave am
bassadors what appeared to be a promise
that Panama would perpetuate current
U.S. policies on international use of the
canal.
The foreign minister referred to the
joint resolution he worked out with
Henry Kissinger in which both Panama
and the U.S. pledged to work for a new
treaty on the Canal Zone, which the U.S.
currently leases from Panama.
