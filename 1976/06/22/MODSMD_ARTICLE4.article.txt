# Medical center installs aids for security
## 
### Kit Warfield 
Four closed circuit television
cameras costing $20,000 have
been installed in Medical Center
parking lots since January as part
of an expanding hospital sec
urity system.
The plan also includes a 12-
passenger building-to-parking
lot escort van purchased early
this year and five "safety sec
urity supervisors" with author
ity over 20 other security guards
at the center.
An incident in the parking lot
last Jan. 7 may have prompted
the development of better sec
urity. A 45-year-old dietary
worker at Hoover Pavilion was
"knocked down and robbed of
her purse" by two suspects at
6:40 p.m. However, officials say
this incident, one of only two
"muggings" at the Medical
Center in the last five years, had
nothing to do with the installa
tion of the cameras.

"We had already requested the
cameras before that incident and
were waiting for the money to
come through," said Larry Jor
dan, facilities protection assis
tant in charge of security. He also
noted that escort service, availa
ble long before the new security
van was purchased, had not been
requested by the woman.
"She walked right past the
guard at the door on the way to
her car and did not ask for an
escort." said Jordan.
According to Facilities Protec
tion Officer Hilary Ryniewicz,
the money for the expanded sec
urity measures came from a joint
hospital/medical school fund.
Designed for deterrence
Ryniewicz, also this year's
chairman of the Bay Area chap
ter of the International Associa
tion for Hospital Security, be
lieves that the new additions
have been "more than effective. "
He emphasizes, however, that

they are designed for deterrence
rather than apprehension.
"It is not a question of how
many suspects we have caught,
but how many we have deter
red," he explained. "Compared
to any other comparably sized

institution, we have had a very
low number of incidents."
Since the cameras were instal
led they have been instrumental
in two apprehensions. One man
was spotted apparently after
stealing some radios from BMW

cars. He was caught in the park
ing lot after a chase and arrested
by Palo Alto police. Medical
Center guards do not carry guns
and the Palo Alto police are al
ways called in to make arrests.
The second incident involved
a man seen walking out of the
hospital with allegedly stolen
hospital property-

The four cameras, sifting on
light poles at each corner of the
Medical Center complex, are
equipped with tilt and panning
devices and rotate continuously
to scan a 359-degree area. They
also have zoom lenses which can
pick up license plate numbers
and use infrared equipment at
night for clearer viewing.
The cameras are controlled
from the Facilities Protection
Department's communication
station in the Med Center base
ment. There is an officer on duty
