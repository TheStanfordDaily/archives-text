# Solzhenitsyn misguided

Concerning his knowledge of Russian and
Soviet history and the art of writing I respect
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn as much as anyone aware
of his works. But about some of his recent pro
nouncements I wish to express my serious and
very sincere dismay.
Let me focus on a couple of ideas advanced by
this famous and respected person. In a recent
speech we were told by Mr. Solzhenitsyn that he
"is an advocate of the view that the aim of life for
each of us is not to take boundless pleasure in
material goods, but to take our departure from the
world as better persons than we arrived at it. better
than our inherited instincts would have made us;
that is. to travel over the span of life on one path or
another of spiritual improvement."
This announcement is eloquent, but what
exactly does it mean? First, it assumes gratuit
ously that most Americans believe that the aim of
life is to take boundless pleasure in material
goods. Hardly anyone believes this. Even the most
materialistic professionals of them all. the
economists, fail to limit the pleasures we seek to
material ones.
And with the art world booming, the theatres
jammed, the book stores flourishing, and the
churches full, spiritual concerns exist in our cul
ture aplenty. It is their quality that is of some
legitimate concern! So to whom is Mr. Solzhenit
syn addressing himself? Not to most Americans.
Moral concern
The area of Mr. Solzhenitsyn's concern we
should all share pertains to what being a better
person means. He does not say. But here and there
it appears that he is refering to what he construes
to be the Christian conceptions of the morally
good human life. Unfortunately for us. there are
now about 1000 different Christian conceptions of
the morally good life, what with American host
ing approximately 700 Christian religious de
nominations on its soil.
In general, we have every reason to challenge
Mr. Solzhenitsyn's apparent reverence for relig
ion and mysticism. There are no sound, logical
arguments for the most basic aspects of religious
truth. The essence of religion is. even by admis
sion of those devoutly religious, unquestioning,
undoubting faith in the existence of Cod and the
truth of those commandments said by some
people to be his!
But this shakey support has only produced war
after war. hostilities and misunderstandings one
after the other. For someone like Mr. Solzhenit
syn. who sees the sham of Marxism quite clearly,
the sham of the essence of the bulk of what is
called religion might be obvious. Yet is this divi
sive. mysterious road that he recommends to us as
the path of virtue.

What inherited instincts is Mr. Solzhenitsyn
talking about? To my knowledge the controversy
over instincts in human beings is still alive but the
anti-instinct arguments appears better supported.
No one can claim to be in support of rational and
peaceful human life while still refering to our
insticts.
Surely such notions, along with original sin. are
of dubious value for purposes of achieving better
understanding among us and greater justice
throughout the world.
What, again, is spiritual improvement? Is it to be
a religious person par excellence? But there are
hundreds of versions of that, so what else can we
learn than confusion from such urgings upon us?
True, there are many who not only feel disdainful
toward moral matters but actually lead an im
moral life. But it won't do just to say this much,
especially because of widespread confusion over
these issues.
Inadequate
From Mr. Solzhenitsyn who urges us to seek
truth, such inadequate reminders are surprising.
What we need is a clear explanation of what it is to
be morallv good and why. When that has been
provided, then we can denounce those who turn
away from the clear and precise message. Until
then we might best lie low.
On Mr. Solzhenitsyn's remarks about liberty: of
course Americans are celebrating political liberty,
not the existence of the freedom of the human
will. And thus this year they are not talking all
that much about moral responsibility but a lot
about the liberty to lead one's life as one judges
best. While some of Mr. Solzhenitsyn's remarks
are undoubtedly poignant in this area, much of
their substance is an affront to the American
people who have tended to be better at living
decent, peaceful lives than the peoples of most
countries, including pre-Soviet Russia!
Finally, one must appreciate that Mr. Sol
zhenitsyn is committed to a return-to-nature
philosophy, so when he urges us to be good, he
has as one of his requirements the calls of the
ecologists. As an anti-technologist, joining those
who hate progress. Mr. Solzhenitsyn might wish
to discuss his views, argue them out, instead of
announce them with a shaking finger as if we all
were his naughty children.
We. \Ti\ Solzhenitsyn, have done mighty well,
thank you. and even without some of your less
carefully considered advice. We thank you for
your warning about the Communist â€” some of us
were about to forget. And we thank you for the
superb writing you have produced. But we really
are quite good in many areas ourselves.
