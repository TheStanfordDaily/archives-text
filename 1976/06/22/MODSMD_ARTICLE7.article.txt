If your Mr. Steven E. Olson,
who just could not find enough
sour grapes to squeeze on my
novel. Even Cowgirls Get the
Blues, honestly is in search of
fiction that deals with his "de
spair, alienation, sexual frustra
tion, rootlessness, etc.," then I
bring good news.
I know for a fact that the
shelves of libraries and shops
are crammed with just such
books, nearly all of them by au
thors who have confused som
berness with seriousness, pain
with truth and low spirits with
high art.
In choosing to base my style
on playfulness, in electing to
spend more time exploring the
bloom of joy than the roots of
despair, in deciding to investi
gate the possibilities of an ecsta
tic literature and life, it would
seem that I am reaching further
and taking greater risks than any
novelist in America today, with
the possible exception of
Ishmael Reed — and Reed is sub
jected to even more vicious at
tacks from the academic intel
ligentsia than am I.
So the pompous "profession
als" cannot tolerate the notion
that shamanic playfulness is
both a form of wisdom and a
means of survival? What else is

new? They are lyelcome to take
their preterit pleasures in the
fossilized genius of Pope, Thac
keray and Forester; they are wel
come to rate social problems
ahead of more liberating con
cerns,they are welcome to their
tight-lipped disapprovals of my
work.
They are not welcome to lie
about me, however, and in say
ing that I have "boasted" that I
never rewrite. Olson is a liar.
True, I do little revision, but
that is because 1 write slowly,
very slowly, trying never to
leave a sentence until I am satis
fied with it. It is not rare for me to
spend days on a single parag
raph. As those who know me
will testify. I bust my butt at
tempting to improve the quality
of my craft.
If I do not labor quite as hard at
it as did Pope, perhaps that is
because Pope was a loveless lit
tle sociopath who had no fun or
magic in his life to distract him.
And it is those two qualities,
fun an 4 magic, that are missing
in Pope's verse, in the Stanford
University creative writing
program and in Steven Olson's
criticism.
See ya in the funny papers!

ing that I have "boasted" that I
never rewrite. Olson is a liar.
True, I do little revision, but
that is because 1 write slowly,
very slowly, trying never to
leave a sentence until I am satis
fied with it. It is not rare for me to
spend days on a single parag
raph. As those who know me
will testify. I bust my butt at
tempting to improve the quality
of my craft.
If I do not labor quite as hard at
it as did Pope, perhaps that is
because Pope was a loveless lit
tle sociopath who had no fun or
magic in his life to distract him.
And it is those two qualities,
fun an 4 magic, that are missing
in Pope's verse, in the Stanford
University creative writing
program and in Steven Olson's
criticism.
See ya in the funny papers!
