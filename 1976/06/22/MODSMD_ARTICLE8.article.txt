Lots of things change on the Stanford campus during the
summer months. The student body is full of new faces, the
weather becomes even nicer, and there's a more relaxed
atmosphere than during the regular academic year.
But some things remain constant and we hope that the
Stanford Daily is one of them. You'll probably notice a
number of aesthetic changes, and our twice-weekly publish
ing schedule is a decided change. But we hope we don't fall
short in trying to maintain our high standard of excellence
in reporting.
If there are ways that you feel the paper can be improved,
or if we missed a big story or even if you want to compliment
us about something we've written, please come by our of
fices or call us at 497-4632. Your response is needed.
