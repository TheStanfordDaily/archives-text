# Palms extended to campus

It's out with the old and in
with the new at the Stanford
Shopping Center. Nine 60-
foot palm trees are being
moved to the central campus
in order to make the renova
tion of the shopping center
possible.
James E. Nelson, Director of
Facilities and Properties, said
that when the architects
couldn't find a way to let the
palm trees remain where they
were, a new course had to be
taken.
"It was then we realized
what beautiful specimens
they were," Nelson said.
"The first place we thought of
(planting them) was the Stan
ford campus . . . The general
public will enjoy them more
at their new location than at
their old location."
Because of the height of the
architecture in both the new
and old shopping centers, the
trees went by virtually un
noticed. Nelson, who ques
tioned many shoppers as to
how they felt about the palm
trees being moved, said a
common response was "What
palm trees?"

PALMED OFF—The palm trees pictured here will soAn have
company. The Stanford Shopping Center's nine palm trees take
up space needed for renovation, so they will soon be uprooted
and donated to the central campus.
