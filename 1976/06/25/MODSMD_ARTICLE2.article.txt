# Four chairmanships unfilled
## Med School teaching: 'spotty' 
### Bill Sposato 
Although tuition at the Stanford Medical
School is "probably as high as any school in
the country," according to Associate Dean
for Student Affairs John P. Steward, some
are questioning whether shortages of fa
culty and facilities are affecting the teach
ing.
Medical student William Benitz said that
for the high cost of tuition, the level of
teaching is not what it should be. He added
that while some of the teaching is good, "it
is spotty."
The Medical School does seem to be hav
ing its problems. Four of the 17 departments
have no chairman, the American Medical
Association gave the school a two year ac
creditation instead of the usual five and
there is an acute shortage of clerkship posi
tions for students.
Associate Dean of Student Affairs Wil
liam Creger said that many schools are
given only a two year the AMA.
"No school perfect'
"No school is perfect, and i think the ac
creditation committee is doing its best to
improve all of them," he said.
Creger said that Stanford received two
year accreditation not because of any prob
lems in the education process, but for the
very specific problem of having seven vac

ant department chairmanships. (Three have
since been filled.)
Many faculty members said that a shor-.
tage of space and resources has made it
very difficult to fill some of the vacancies.
Acting head of surgery James Mark said
that many people in the surgical field are
used to a great number of beds at their dis
posal.
'Need beds'
"We desperately need more beds and
operating rooms," he said.
Steward admitted it is difficult to find the
first-rate type of surgeon that Stanford
wants because of the shortage of facilities*
but they exist, Steward said. The shortage of
beds is compounded in surgery because the l
Cardiovascular Surgery Department exists
as a separate department and would not be (
under the control of any Surgery Depart
ment head.
Lawrence Mathers, acting department
chairman in Anatomy, said that a lack of
resources made the search for a new
Anatomy Department chairman difficult.
He said that the recent appointment of
Lubert Stryer as chairman is directly related
to the movement of the department from the
old anatomy building to the new Fairchild
Building. Anatomy had been without a
chairman for more than three years.

Anatomy also faces the problem of a de
clining number of tenured professors. Only
one faculty member has tenure. Mathers
said that the department has been able to
maintain a high level of teaching by the use
of visiting professors. Research was the area
most affected by the gradual attrition of fa
culty, he added.
Physiology is likewise suffering from a
lack of faculty and no chairman. The de
partment has only two tenured members,
neither of which are involved in teaching
medical students. The physiology courses
are now taught by the Department of
Medicine "out of default," as one student
called it.
The acting chairman, Maurice Krahl, con
tends the quality of teaching has improved
since being taken over by the Medicine De
partment. He said that for many years the
physiology courses were taught by
physiologists without much regard for the
needs of the medical students. The profes
sors were oriented toward basic sciences
and did not worry about the clinical rele
vance, Krahl said.
He said the attrition of faculty in physiol
ogy and anatomy has been deliberate, so an
incoming chairman could bring in new
people who would add vitality to the de
partment.
