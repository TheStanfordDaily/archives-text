# Four chairmanships unfilled
## Med School teaching: 'spotty' 
### Bill Sposato 
Although tuition at the Stanford Medical
School is "probably as high as any school in
the country," according to Associate Dean
for Student Affairs John P. Steward, some
are questioning whether shortages of fa
culty and facilities are affecting the teach
ing.
Medical student William Benitz said that
for the high cost of tuition, the level of
teaching is not what it should be. He added
that while some of the teaching is good, "it
is spotty."
The Medical School does seem to be hav
ing its problems. Four of the 17 departments
have no chairman, the American Medical
Association gave the school a two year ac
creditation instead of the usual five and
there is an acute shortage of clerkship posi
tions for students.
Associate Dean of Student Affairs Wil
liam Creger said that many schools are
given only a two year the AMA.
"No school perfect'
"No school is perfect, and i think the ac
creditation committee is doing its best to
improve all of them," he said.
Creger said that Stanford received two
year accreditation not because of any prob
lems in the education process, but for the
very specific problem of having seven vac

ant department chairmanships. (Three have
since been filled.)
Many faculty members said that a shor-.
tage of space and resources has made it
very difficult to fill some of the vacancies.
Acting head of surgery James Mark said
that many people in the surgical field are
used to a great number of beds at their dis
posal.
'Need beds'
"We desperately need more beds and
operating rooms," he said.
Steward admitted it is difficult to find the
first-rate type of surgeon that Stanford
wants because of the shortage of facilities*
but they exist, Steward said. The shortage of
beds is compounded in surgery because the l
Cardiovascular Surgery Department exists
as a separate department and would not be (
under the control of any Surgery Depart
ment head.
Lawrence Mathers, acting department
chairman in Anatomy, said that a lack of
resources made the search for a new
Anatomy Department chairman difficult.
He said that the recent appointment of
Lubert Stryer as chairman is directly related
to the movement of the department from the
old anatomy building to the new Fairchild
Building. Anatomy had been without a
chairman for more than three years.

Anatomy also faces the problem of a de
clining number of tenured professors. Only
one faculty member has tenure. Mathers
said that the department has been able to
maintain a high level of teaching by the use
of visiting professors. Research was the area
most affected by the gradual attrition of fa
culty, he added.
Physiology is likewise suffering from a
lack of faculty and no chairman. The de
partment has only two tenured members,
neither of which are involved in teaching
medical students. The physiology courses
are now taught by the Department of
Medicine "out of default," as one student
called it.
The acting chairman, Maurice Krahl, con
tends the quality of teaching has improved
since being taken over by the Medicine De
partment. He said that for many years the
physiology courses were taught by
physiologists without much regard for the
needs of the medical students. The profes
sors were oriented toward basic sciences
and did not worry about the clinical rele
vance, Krahl said.
He said the attrition of faculty in physiol
ogy and anatomy has been deliberate, so an
incoming chairman could bring in new
people who would add vitality to the de
partment.
Creger agreed, saying "We do
have some departments that
need improving, and we need
new blood to do it."
Krahl said he was not entirely
happy with the new method of
teaching physiology. He said
that the courses are now taught
with "too heavy a clinical slant."
Medical student Raul Zim
merman said that while the
physiology courses are excel
lent, the Department of
Medicine acts like it is not really
its job to teach these courses and
does not have much concern for
any problems that might de
velop.
There was a lack of responsi
bility in the supervision of clini
cal teaching, which is the practi
cal experience for third and
fourth-year students, according
to students. One claimed there
was a lack of responsiveness to
the student's needs in the way
the clinical positions, known as

clerkships, were handed out.
Benitz said that some students
received numerous clerkships of
good quality, while some stu
dents received only one inferior
position. He said the problem
was critical because of an overall
shortage of available clerkships.
Old problem
Creger, who is in charge of
clerkships, said the problem is
not new and has been growing
for some time. He said that be
cause of the shortages that came
up a few years ago, students
were forced to put off some
clerkships which they should
have been completing in their
third year, to their fourth year.
This drove the system "into
debt according to Creger, and
this year "all of a sudden the
water has gone over the dam."
Creger said that while stu
dents cannot obtain whatever
clerkships they want when they
want them, he said that "no
one's graduation will be inter
fered with and there will be no
lessening of requirements."
He said that shortages for stu
dents graduating in 1977 have

been eliminated, while "some
fairly gross shortages exist" for
those students graduating in
1978.
Creger said that an effort has
been made to increase the
number of clerkships, and while
not everyone is ecstatic, "the
amount of displeasure is dis
tinctly less than last year."
Whatever problems beset
Stanford Medical School, it does
not seem to be affecting hopeful
physicians. Steward said that
more than 5200 applications
have been received for next
year's 86 slots.

tends the quality of teaching has improved
since being taken over by the Medicine De
partment. He said that for many years the
physiology courses were taught by
physiologists without much regard for the
needs of the medical students. The profes
sors were oriented toward basic sciences
and did not worry about the clinical rele
vance, Krahl said.
He said the attrition of faculty in physiol
ogy and anatomy has been deliberate, so an
incoming chairman could bring in new
people who would add vitality to the de
partment.
Creger agreed, saying "We do
have some departments that
need improving, and we need
new blood to do it."
Krahl said he was not entirely
happy with the new method of
teaching physiology. He said
that the courses are now taught
with "too heavy a clinical slant."
Medical student Raul Zim
merman said that while the
physiology courses are excel
lent, the Department of
Medicine acts like it is not really
its job to teach these courses and
does not have much concern for
any problems that might de
velop.
There was a lack of responsi
bility in the supervision of clini
cal teaching, which is the practi
cal experience for third and
fourth-year students, according
to students. One claimed there
was a lack of responsiveness to
the student's needs in the way
the clinical positions, known as

clerkships, were handed out.
Benitz said that some students
received numerous clerkships of
good quality, while some stu
dents received only one inferior
position. He said the problem
was critical because of an overall
shortage of available clerkships.
Old problem
Creger, who is in charge of
clerkships, said the problem is
not new and has been growing
for some time. He said that be
cause of the shortages that came
up a few years ago, students
were forced to put off some
clerkships which they should
have been completing in their
third year, to their fourth year.
This drove the system "into
debt according to Creger, and
this year "all of a sudden the
water has gone over the dam."
Creger said that while stu
dents cannot obtain whatever
clerkships they want when they
want them, he said that "no
one's graduation will be inter
fered with and there will be no
lessening of requirements."
He said that shortages for stu
dents graduating in 1977 have

been eliminated, while "some
fairly gross shortages exist" for
those students graduating in
1978.
Creger said that an effort has
been made to increase the
number of clerkships, and while
not everyone is ecstatic, "the
amount of displeasure is dis
tinctly less than last year."
Whatever problems beset
Stanford Medical School, it does
not seem to be affecting hopeful
physicians. Steward said that
more than 5200 applications
have been received for next
year's 86 slots.
Although tuition at the Stanford Medical
School is "probably as high as any school in
the country," according to Associate Dean
for Student Affairs John P. Steward, some
are questioning whether shortages of fa
culty and facilities are affecting the teach
ing.
Medical student William Benitz said that
for the high cost of tuition, the level of
teaching is not what it should be. He added
that while some of the teaching is good, "it
is spotty."
The Medical School does seem to be hav
ing its problems. Four of the 17 departments
have no chairman, the American Medical
Association gave the school a two year ac
creditation instead of the usual five and
there is an acute shortage of clerkship posi
tions for students.
Associate Dean of Student Affairs Wil
liam Creger said that many schools are
given only a two year the AMA.
"No school perfect'
"No school is perfect, and i think the ac
creditation committee is doing its best to
improve all of them," he said.
Creger said that Stanford received two
year accreditation not because of any prob
lems in the education process, but for the
very specific problem of having seven vac

ant department chairmanships. (Three have
since been filled.)
Many faculty members said that a shor-.
tage of space and resources has made it
very difficult to fill some of the vacancies.
Acting head of surgery James Mark said
that many people in the surgical field are
used to a great number of beds at their dis
posal.
'Need beds'
"We desperately need more beds and
operating rooms," he said.
Steward admitted it is difficult to find the
first-rate type of surgeon that Stanford
wants because of the shortage of facilities*
but they exist, Steward said. The shortage of
beds is compounded in surgery because the l
Cardiovascular Surgery Department exists
as a separate department and would not be (
under the control of any Surgery Depart
ment head.
Lawrence Mathers, acting department
chairman in Anatomy, said that a lack of
resources made the search for a new
Anatomy Department chairman difficult.
He said that the recent appointment of
Lubert Stryer as chairman is directly related
to the movement of the department from the
old anatomy building to the new Fairchild
Building. Anatomy had been without a
chairman for more than three years.

Anatomy also faces the problem of a de
clining number of tenured professors. Only
one faculty member has tenure. Mathers
said that the department has been able to
maintain a high level of teaching by the use
of visiting professors. Research was the area
most affected by the gradual attrition of fa
culty, he added.
Physiology is likewise suffering from a
lack of faculty and no chairman. The de
partment has only two tenured members,
neither of which are involved in teaching
medical students. The physiology courses
are now taught by the Department of
Medicine "out of default," as one student
called it.

Although tuition at the Stanford Medical
School is "probably as high as any school in
the country," according to Associate Dean
for Student Affairs John P. Steward, some
are questioning whether shortages of fa
culty and facilities are affecting the teach
ing.
Medical student William Benitz said that
for the high cost of tuition, the level of
teaching is not what it should be. He added
that while some of the teaching is good, "it
is spotty."
The Medical School does seem to be hav
ing its problems. Four of the 17 departments
have no chairman, the American Medical
Association gave the school a two year ac
creditation instead of the usual five and
there is an acute shortage of clerkship posi
tions for students.
Associate Dean of Student Affairs Wil
liam Creger said that many schools are
given only a two year the AMA.
"No school perfect'
"No school is perfect, and i think the ac
creditation committee is doing its best to
improve all of them," he said.
Creger said that Stanford received two
year accreditation not because of any prob
lems in the education process, but for the
very specific problem of having seven vac

ant department chairmanships. (Three have
since been filled.)
Many faculty members said that a shor-.
tage of space and resources has made it
very difficult to fill some of the vacancies.
Acting head of surgery James Mark said
that many people in the surgical field are
used to a great number of beds at their dis
posal.
'Need beds'
"We desperately need more beds and
operating rooms," he said.
Steward admitted it is difficult to find the
first-rate type of surgeon that Stanford
wants because of the shortage of facilities*
but they exist, Steward said. The shortage of
beds is compounded in surgery because the l
Cardiovascular Surgery Department exists
as a separate department and would not be (
under the control of any Surgery Depart
ment head.
Lawrence Mathers, acting department
chairman in Anatomy, said that a lack of
resources made the search for a new
Anatomy Department chairman difficult.
He said that the recent appointment of
Lubert Stryer as chairman is directly related
to the movement of the department from the
old anatomy building to the new Fairchild
Building. Anatomy had been without a
chairman for more than three years.

Anatomy also faces the problem of a de
clining number of tenured professors. Only
one faculty member has tenure. Mathers
said that the department has been able to
maintain a high level of teaching by the use
of visiting professors. Research was the area
most affected by the gradual attrition of fa
culty, he added.
Physiology is likewise suffering from a
lack of faculty and no chairman. The de
partment has only two tenured members,
neither of which are involved in teaching
medical students. The physiology courses
are now taught by the Department of
Medicine "out of default," as one student
called it.
The acting chairman, Maurice Krahl, con
tends the quality of teaching has improved
since being taken over by the Medicine De
partment. He said that for many years the
physiology courses were taught by
physiologists without much regard for the
needs of the medical students. The profes
sors were oriented toward basic sciences
and did not worry about the clinical rele
vance, Krahl said.
He said the attrition of faculty in physiol
ogy and anatomy has been deliberate, so an
incoming chairman could bring in new
people who would add vitality to the de
partment.
Creger agreed, saying "We do
have some departments that
need improving, and we need
new blood to do it."
Krahl said he was not entirely
happy with the new method of
teaching physiology. He said
that the courses are now taught
with "too heavy a clinical slant."
Medical student Raul Zim
merman said that while the
physiology courses are excel
lent, the Department of
Medicine acts like it is not really
its job to teach these courses and
does not have much concern for
any problems that might de
velop.
There was a lack of responsi
bility in the supervision of clini
cal teaching, which is the practi
cal experience for third and
fourth-year students, according
to students. One claimed there
was a lack of responsiveness to
the student's needs in the way
the clinical positions, known as

clerkships, were handed out.
Benitz said that some students
received numerous clerkships of
good quality, while some stu
dents received only one inferior
position. He said the problem
was critical because of an overall
shortage of available clerkships.
Old problem
Creger, who is in charge of
clerkships, said the problem is
not new and has been growing
for some time. He said that be
cause of the shortages that came
up a few years ago, students
were forced to put off some
clerkships which they should
have been completing in their
third year, to their fourth year.
This drove the system "into
debt according to Creger, and
this year "all of a sudden the
water has gone over the dam."
Creger said that while stu
dents cannot obtain whatever
clerkships they want when they
want them, he said that "no
one's graduation will be inter
fered with and there will be no
lessening of requirements."
He said that shortages for stu
dents graduating in 1977 have

been eliminated, while "some
fairly gross shortages exist" for
those students graduating in
1978.
Creger said that an effort has
been made to increase the
number of clerkships, and while
not everyone is ecstatic, "the
amount of displeasure is dis
tinctly less than last year."
Whatever problems beset
Stanford Medical School, it does
not seem to be affecting hopeful
physicians. Steward said that
more than 5200 applications
have been received for next
year's 86 slots.
