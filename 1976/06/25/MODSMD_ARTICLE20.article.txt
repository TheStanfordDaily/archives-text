As thermometers topped the 90's at Stanford
Wednesday and yesterday, the Farm's inhabitants
found different ways to fight the heat.
A couple at the Old Union found comfort by
dangling their feet in the fountain, above, while two
others, left, cooled off at the deGuerre oasis. The
fellow below visited another Oasis and, with the
help of several pitchers of beer, simply forgot about
the heat.
There doesn't appear to be much relief in sight
from the warm weather as the National Weather
Service predicts area highs to again be in the 90s,
and possibly reach into the 100's.
