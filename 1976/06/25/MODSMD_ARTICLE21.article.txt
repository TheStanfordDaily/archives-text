# Joffrey Ballet hits beach

During the Joffrey Ballet's
brief visit to San Francisco, the
troupe demonstrated that they
are not only daring innovators,
'but are able to carry off their en
deavors with discipline and
style.
They opened with an original
composition by the new darling
of dance, Twyla Tharp, entitled
Deuce Coupe 11. You guessed it,
the music was by the Beach
Boys. The piece was a catchy al
malgam of different styles — all
stirred together in Twarp's inim
itable fashion.
Although the music was pun
chy, the dancers caught the mel
low waves of harmony that swell
through the Beach Boys music,
and they rode them out in
smooth arabesques.
However, in moments the
choreography seem scattered,
and the visual madcap effect of
parts of the piece gradually be
came tiring to the senses.
Yet, original music may take
away some of the stunning im
pact of this piece, since it is the
clash between the old familiar
Beach Boy tunes such as
"Wouldn't it be Nice" and "Lit
tle Deuce Coupe" and their
avant-garde Tharp interpreta
tion that powers the number
along.

The second piece on opening
night was Secret Places. Gerald
Arpino choreographed this love
duo to the Mozart Concerto No.
21 in C Major, and the result is a
deliciously floating and elegant
dance. The famous ballerina,
Lisa Bradley, danced as one of
the partners, she looked ravish
ing in her role as a coy lover.
The final piece of the evening
was The Green Table, a black sa

tire on diplomats who coolly talk
while war in raging. Choreog
raphed by Kurt Joos, the piece
was originally performed in the
early 1930'5. Perhaps the touch
of triteness inherent in the piece
was due to its age and not its
current dancers.
In summation, the Joffrey put
on a varied and intriguing per
formance that night, and we look
forward to their next annual ap
pearance.
