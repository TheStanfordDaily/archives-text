# For the record...
## The 						Tubes stand out, Rick Wakeman's disc falls flat 
### David Hwang YOUNG RICH; The Tubes; A M 
Buried under the Tubes' smoking amps,
trapeze artists, video screens and black leather
was always a schizoid second personality that
owed nothing to tract houses and frosted flakes.
The Tubes' more public image, centered around
showman Fee Waybill, won them critical acclaim,
an okay from musicians like Jagger and Rolling
Stone's "Best New Group of 1975" award.
Fans like Carlos Santana, however, saw some
thing in the Tubes' sound, a Spooner-Sheen
commitment to serious avant-garde rock. On their
second album, Young &- Rich, the split
personality materializes more clearly. The pur
posely tacky satire and mock showmanship is
gaudier than ever, but the number of introspec
tive, straight-faced works has increased. The
Tubes seem like two good bands, though neither
reaches its full potential on this album.
Young fr Rich's satire bites like a "Mondo Bon
dage" whip, but lacks the musical wit of "What
Do You Want From Life?", "Haloes " or "White
Punks." "Don't Touch Me There " is a remake of a
luv-and-motorcycle wail from the early sixties,
hilarious but not original. "Proud to Be an Ameri
can" is "What Do You Want From Patriotism?",
drowning the listener in "cold wars, hot wars, gas

wars, confrontation, constipation, consternation,
open-heart emancipation" — fifties recreation,
without imagination. Similarly,"Slipped My Dis
co's lyrics are spine-shattering, but it's not Quay
— what can you do to make disco music interest
ing?
The album's best rockers, "Tubes World Tour"
— who else could rhyme "tour" with "amour"
and "bonjour"? — and "Stand Up and Shout,"
are self-gratifying energy at its hot-wired peak,
but lack the imagination to turn the fire into a star.
The album's serious numbers rise far above "Up
From the Deep." Spooner and Steen attempt to
give form to their musical cosmos and create
sophisticated moments on "Brighter Day,"
"Pimp " and "Young & Rich." All three are lofty,
nonmelodic pieces which paint dark chords on a
highly customized soul canvas.
The first brings out a flair and taste in Roger
Steen's guitar solos heretofore unimaginable,
while the other two are depressing — yeah, depre
si ng— fusions of success and loneliness. There's
a human being behind Quay's diamond sunglas
ses and mascara, and that's disturbing.
The Tubes are foremost outstanding showmen,
but Young 6r Rich shows traces of musician and
poet after hours. They are real human beings, and
that's shock enough to last the summer.
NO EARTHLY CONNECTION;
Rick Wakeman & The English
Rock Ensemble; A & M
As thfe last glorified chord
fades into a synthesized nova,
the listener grimmaces; there's
something unnervingly painful
about Ashely Holt's quivering
and' flat falsetto above a lush
orgy of electronic orchestration.
The contrast between instru
mental grandeur and vocal de
stitution grates raw, yet
exemplifies the major problem
with No Earthly Connection,
Wakeman's latest work. There is
a disturbing lack of unity and
evenness; rather than truly fus
ing rock and classical with care
and craftsmanship, Wakeman
merely puts the two styles side
by-side and expects them to get
friendly on their own. This ex
periment in random breeding
just doesn't produce; the two
forms make war. not love.
Wakeman's musical conflicts
reveal a glaring tastelessness.
Shimmering acoustic piano
solos are placed alongside a
capella Gregorian-like chants,
which in turn are surrounded by
movie-score muzak and upright
honky-tonk piano, all with no
earthly connections.
It is not that Wakeman cannot
play fine keyboards; his funky
rockers, such as parts of "The
Warning," make tight and Excit
ing music. Similarly, he can do
ballads like "The Maker" with a
pop-like ease. His problems arise
because he often tries to do too
much in too little space.
Wakeman's music is complex
without a base in simplicity.
Once again, we are presented
with a theme album, this time
centering around Wakeman's
own metaphysical philosophies.
He sees music as an eternal part

of man's soul which moves on to
another life after our deaths.
The album's dominating
work, "Music Reincarnate," is a
five-part composition about
music's stay in one man's soul.
The two remaining numbers,
"The Prisoner" and"The Lost
Cycle," deal with judgment and
the inevitability df death, with
lyrics like, "The spaceman only
knows the truth/ He's seen it
from eternal youth/ Man ivill al
ways die." We're not really told
anything we didn't already
know.
No Earthly Connection is a
kind of musical bullshit, too lit
tle disguised as too much. This
technique worked well on the
first Wakeman albums, but this
time we are not fooled. In an
album of conflicts, the most
striking is between the ambiti
ous glory which Wakeman sets
out to achieve and the ragged
pretension that often emerges.

ALL-AMERICAN ALIEN BOY;
lan Hunter; Columbia
lan Hunter's first solo LP fol
lowed the post-Bowie/Mott the
Hoople format in its tactful ba
lance between tight exploding
rockers 'and poetic contempla
tive ballads. On his second al
bum, All-American Alien Boy,
however. Hunter abandons his
old style and uses loosely-knit
folk, pop and rock tunes as
showcase for his ambitious
lyrics. Poetry is emphasized on
Alien Boy, sometimes to the de
triment of the music.
It is hard to miss Hunter's new
Dylanesque character, particu
larly on "God (Takel)," which
features the chord progression
from Desire's "Oh. Sister" and
lyrics like "God said to me,
'Gonna kick your ass — 'cos all
you do is ask, ask, ask.' " Unlike
Dylan, however, Hunter cannot
produce straight-faced social
commentary; "Rape," for in

stance, is a Lipstick — like por
trayal of crime and non
punishment; "While she's dying
of grief, he's defending his
brief."
Instead, Hunter excels at
crazed wit and personal intros
pection, as on "Irene Wilde,"
"God (Take 1)," and the title cut.
Hunter is better at revealing
himself than exploring others.
Much of Alien Boy's music is
not tight enough to hold our at
tention. The exceptions include
the title cut's rocking brassiness

and "You Nearly Did Me In,"
which features Queen on Bac
kup vocals. Numbers like
"Rape" and "Restless Youth"
show little consideration
On the whole, however, Hunt
er's new direction promises a
challenging future and greater
things to come, though he will
have to put more consistent care
into his music. Although his
glitter may be gone, his shimmer
remains.
