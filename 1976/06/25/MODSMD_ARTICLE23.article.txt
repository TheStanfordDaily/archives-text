# For the record...
## The Tubes stand out, Rick Wakeman's disc falls flat
### David Hwang YOUNG RICH; The Tubes; A M 
Buried under the Tubes' smoking amps,
trapeze artists, video screens and black leather
was always a schizoid second personality that
owed nothing to tract houses and frosted flakes.
The Tubes' more public image, centered around
showman Fee Waybill, won them critical acclaim,
an okay from musicians like Jagger and Rolling
Stone's "Best New Group of 1975" award.
Fans like Carlos Santana, however, saw some
thing in the Tubes' sound, a Spooner-Sheen
commitment to serious avant-garde rock. On their
second album, Young &- Rich, the split
personality materializes more clearly. The pur
posely tacky satire and mock showmanship is
gaudier than ever, but the number of introspec
tive, straight-faced works has increased. The
Tubes seem like two good bands, though neither
reaches its full potential on this album.
Young fr Rich's satire bites like a "Mondo Bon
dage" whip, but lacks the musical wit of "What
Do You Want From Life?", "Haloes " or "White
Punks." "Don't Touch Me There " is a remake of a
luv-and-motorcycle wail from the early sixties,
hilarious but not original. "Proud to Be an Ameri
can" is "What Do You Want From Patriotism?",
drowning the listener in "cold wars, hot wars, gas

wars, confrontation, constipation, consternation,
open-heart emancipation" — fifties recreation,
without imagination. Similarly,"Slipped My Dis
co's lyrics are spine-shattering, but it's not Quay
— what can you do to make disco music interest
ing?
The album's best rockers, "Tubes World Tour"
— who else could rhyme "tour" with "amour"
and "bonjour"? — and "Stand Up and Shout,"
are self-gratifying energy at its hot-wired peak,
but lack the imagination to turn the fire into a star.
The album's serious numbers rise far above "Up
From the Deep." Spooner and Steen attempt to
give form to their musical cosmos and create
sophisticated moments on "Brighter Day,"
"Pimp " and "Young & Rich." All three are lofty,
nonmelodic pieces which paint dark chords on a
highly customized soul canvas.
The first brings out a flair and taste in Roger
Steen's guitar solos heretofore unimaginable,
while the other two are depressing — yeah, depre
si ng— fusions of success and loneliness. There's
a human being behind Quay's diamond sunglas
ses and mascara, and that's disturbing.
The Tubes are foremost outstanding showmen,
but Young 6r Rich shows traces of musician and
poet after hours. They are real human beings, and
that's shock enough to last the summer.
