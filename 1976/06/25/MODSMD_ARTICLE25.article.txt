Ford'S busing proposal
VVASHINCTON — President Gerald
Ford yesterday sent Congress legislation
aimed at curtailing busing as a means of
school integration. In his long-expecte.d
message, Ford said judges "have gone
too far" in ordering busing, which he
said had hindered attempts to wipe out
segregation.
The proposed legislation, which
would establish specific guidelines for
federal courts, is expected to see turbu
lent action in Congress. Democratic
leaders were not briefed on the proposed
legislation before Ford made it public.
Attorney General Edward Levi, who
wrote the measure, says it would return
the initiative in planning desegregation
to local school boards.
The bill would limit busing to areas
where racial discrimination could be
shown to exist. Roy VVilkins of the
NAACP called the Ford proposal "abso
lutely terrible.".and predicted that it
would be found unconstitutional.
Kissinger, Vorster hopeful
LONDON — Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger said yesterday that his talks
with South African Prime Minister John
Vorster had opened the way for ending
South Africa's racial unrest. Kissinger

and Vorster met for two days in Bavaria
near the Czechoslovakian border.
Kissinger said the United States hoped
for "negotiated resolution to end vio
lence." He said he would send the State
Department's expert on Africa, Michael
Schaufele, to Africa to discuss the results
to the talks.
In South Africa yesterday police con
fiscated hundreds of pamphlets calling
for a strike by black coal miners. Black
school officials in Soweto, where the
protests began last week, asked for a
mass funeral for students and teachers
killed in last week's rioting, but'au
thorities turned down the request.
Court voids wage law
WASHINGTON — In a bitterly con
tested decision, the Supreme Court yes
terday struck down a federal law extend
ing minimum wage and overtime provi
sions to state and local government
employees.
By a five-to-four majority, the court

declared that Congress exceeded its
powers by attempting to regulate the
wages and hours of such employees.
Mars' moonlike surface
PASADENA — Photos taken by
the Viking One spacecraft show that
some areas of Mars are flat and would
make relatively easy landing sites for a
space laboratory. Viking One, now orbit
ing Mars, is scheduled to send a lander to
the planet July 4.
Scientists who are studying the Mars
photos say the surface of Mars mare
ridges and tiny craters like those com
mon on the moon.
Fires rage in state
SAN FRANCISCO — The current wave
of hot. dry, windy weather has touched
off at least six forest fires in California's
vast brush and forest land. The fires have
scored more than 23,000 acres of wilder

ness. including some 200 acres of the
Point Reyes National Seashore preserve.
The largest fire was a 32-square-mile
blaze in the foothills of the Sierra east of
Sacramento near the Mother Lode hills.
Officials said the blaze had destroyed
20,000 acres and was still out of control
on one front last night.
In Southern California, a 1700-acre
blaze was brought under control yester
day morning after driving scores of resi
dents from an exclusive area of homes in
the Conejo Valley.
