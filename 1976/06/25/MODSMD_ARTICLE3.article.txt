# Retirement plan angers employes
## 
### John Freed 
A proposed shift in University
contributions to a retirement
plan for professional staff has
created a storm of controversy
centered at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC).
The University has proposed a
plan under which contributions
to two private retirement funds
and to Social Security would be
integrated.
Currently, the private plans
are independent of Social Sec
urity contribution levels, which
are set by Congress.
Changing rules
"The University, is changing
the rules in midstream," com
plained JackTruher. a physicist
at SLAC who is a member of
Exempt-74. a group of SLAC pro
fessional employes (termed
"exempt" because they fall out
side of state and federal labor
laws).
The proposal would lower
both the University contribution
and the minimum employe con
tribution to two retirement plans
— the Teachers' Insurance and
Annuity Association (TIAA) and
the College Retirement Equities

Fund (CREF).
"The University (has) indi
cated it is not its policy to
match . . . the consumer price
index (in wages and benefits) in
order to meet its financial prob
lems. The unorganized staff —
the professional staff — is ap
prehensive," Truher said.
Only a proposal
David Garvin, a financial
analyst in the Controller's Of
fice, emphasized the changes are
only a proposal.
"This is a proposal . . . drafted
initially by some University of
ficers." Garvin said. "This sum
mer is going to be.speht . . . look
ing at that proposal and other
proposals."
The TIAA/CREF plans cover
only University exempt
employes, including faculty and
nonunionized staff The Univer
sity plans to form a task force to
study the revision, Garvin said.
"That task force will look at
that proposal. Any faculty or
exempt staff member can write
in ... to the (task force) mem
bers," Garvin noted. The task
force '"can modify or even
change it substantially."
Ready by November
A final plan should be ready
by November for implementa
tion Jan. 1, 1977, Garvin said
The force will not necessarily
contain opponents of the prop
osal, he noted.
"The group will include
people of a number of persua
tions," he said. "There is no at
tempt to identify viewpoint
prior to appointment."
Truher expressed confidence
that Exempt-74 and other groups
opposing the plan will be rep
resented.
Increase dependence
. A letter signed by more than
100 SLAG employes claimed the
revisions would "increase our
dependence on Social Security,
a sometimes inequitable prog
ram not equivalent to an indi
vidual retirement plan."
The University announced a,
policy in january which would
allow wages and benefits to fall
behind Bay Area standards in
order to cut costs, Truher said.
"This seems ... to be a way to
cut costs at the expense of
employes," Truher said. "Prog
ressive companies . . . intheßay
Area have as a policy to meet and
exceed market wages and be
nefits. They do this in large part
insist that employes remain
unorganized (in unions)."
According to Truher, the Uni
versity is inviting unionization
among non-faculty exempt per
sonnel. *
"If they choose to fall behind
the market, what they are doing
in effect is union organizing," he
said.
Truher called for formation of
a campus-wide group to repre
sent interests of non-faculty
exempts.
Garvin noted the TIAA/CREF
plan was integrated in 1951,
when maximum Social Security
deductions were $54 per
employe.
Since that time, the $54 reduc
tion in TIAA/CREF contribu

tions has remained steady, while
maximum Social Security de
ductions have soared to $757.
"(TIAA/CREF) was integrated
in 1951 but was never adjusted
between then and now," Garvin
noted.
The University plan would
reduce minimum employe con
tributions to 7 percent of income
for the combined Social
Security-TIAA/CREF plan,
while the University's contribu
tion to the combined plan would
be 12 percent of the employe in
come.
Currently, employes contri
bute 6 percent of income to
TIAA/CREF along, while the
University gives 10 percent of
salary (less $54) to that plan.

plan for professional staff has
created a storm of controversy
centered at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC).
The University has proposed a
plan under which contributions
to two private retirement funds
and to Social Security would be
integrated.
Currently, the private plans
are independent of Social Sec
urity contribution levels, which
are set by Congress.
Changing rules
"The University, is changing
the rules in midstream," com
plained JackTruher. a physicist
at SLAC who is a member of
Exempt-74. a group of SLAC pro
fessional employes (termed
"exempt" because they fall out
side of state and federal labor
laws).
The proposal would lower
both the University contribution
and the minimum employe con
tribution to two retirement plans
— the Teachers' Insurance and
Annuity Association (TIAA) and
the College Retirement Equities

Fund (CREF).
"The University (has) indi
cated it is not its policy to
match . . . the consumer price
index (in wages and benefits) in
order to meet its financial prob
lems. The unorganized staff —
the professional staff — is ap
prehensive," Truher said.
Only a proposal
David Garvin, a financial
analyst in the Controller's Of
fice, emphasized the changes are
only a proposal.
"This is a proposal . . . drafted
initially by some University of
ficers." Garvin said. "This sum
mer is going to be.speht . . . look
ing at that proposal and other
proposals."
The TIAA/CREF plans cover
only University exempt
employes, including faculty and
nonunionized staff The Univer
sity plans to form a task force to
study the revision, Garvin said.
"That task force will look at
that proposal. Any faculty or
exempt staff member can write
in ... to the (task force) mem
bers," Garvin noted. The task
force '"can modify or even
change it substantially."
Ready by November
A final plan should be ready
by November for implementa
tion Jan. 1, 1977, Garvin said
The force will not necessarily
contain opponents of the prop
osal, he noted.
"The group will include
people of a number of persua
tions," he said. "There is no at
tempt to identify viewpoint
prior to appointment."
Truher expressed confidence
that Exempt-74 and other groups
opposing the plan will be rep
resented.
Increase dependence
. A letter signed by more than
100 SLAG employes claimed the
revisions would "increase our
dependence on Social Security,
a sometimes inequitable prog
ram not equivalent to an indi
vidual retirement plan."
The University announced a,
policy in january which would
allow wages and benefits to fall
behind Bay Area standards in
order to cut costs, Truher said.
"This seems ... to be a way to
cut costs at the expense of
employes," Truher said. "Prog
ressive companies . . . intheßay
Area have as a policy to meet and
exceed market wages and be
nefits. They do this in large part
insist that employes remain
unorganized (in unions)."
According to Truher, the Uni
versity is inviting unionization
among non-faculty exempt per
sonnel. *
"If they choose to fall behind
the market, what they are doing
in effect is union organizing," he
said.
Truher called for formation of
a campus-wide group to repre
sent interests of non-faculty
exempts.
Garvin noted the TIAA/CREF
plan was integrated in 1951,
when maximum Social Security
deductions were $54 per
employe.
Since that time, the $54 reduc
tion in TIAA/CREF contribu

tions has remained steady, while
maximum Social Security de
ductions have soared to $757.
"(TIAA/CREF) was integrated
in 1951 but was never adjusted
between then and now," Garvin
noted.
The University plan would
reduce minimum employe con
tributions to 7 percent of income
for the combined Social
Security-TIAA/CREF plan,
while the University's contribu
tion to the combined plan would
be 12 percent of the employe in
come.
Currently, employes contri
bute 6 percent of income to
TIAA/CREF along, while the
University gives 10 percent of
salary (less $54) to that plan.
