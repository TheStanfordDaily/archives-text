## Save Honor Code 
### 
David Spokely II

In a recent Washington Post
front page story, the trials and
tribulations being suffered by
the honor code at many institu
tions of higher learning was co
vered thoroughly, with the indi
cation that some of the most pre
stigious were abandoning their
codes in favor of a proctor sys
tem during exams.
In particular, the story noted
that Stanford is reappraising its
Honor Code in light of the less
than honorable actions on the
part of some of the more com
petitive students.
After spending one year at
another so-called California in
stitution of higher learning, I
transfered to Stanford. What a
contrast! Where previously I had
found cheating under a proctor
system to be the standard bill of
fare, at Stanford I found trust and
faith in the individual.
Where previously I had found
a driving competition to meet
and measure and be measured by
rigid standards of the normal
curve without rhvme or reason;
at Stanford I found among most
of the students, depending on

their level of maturity, a true de
sire to think and to learn for the
sake of learning and a reasonable
approach towards grading by the
faculty.
Before Stanford considers al
tering or abandoning the Honor
Code, I suggest that you all —
students, faculty and administ
ration — participate in an exper
iment in which the proctor sys
tem, in all of its stark and hide
ous aspects, is tried out for a
month, more or less.
Perhaps out of that experience
will come a renewed respect,
appreciation, and support for
what I found to be one of the
greatest learning experiences in
my own academic life — the
trust engendered by the Honor
Code. If some way cannot be
found to preserve the Honor
Code at Stanford, how then can a
less thoughtful and enlightened
worldly society expect to hold
itself together with a basic fabric
which in one way or another is
based on mutual trust and ho
nesty?
