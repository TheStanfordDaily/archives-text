# America's unhappy centennial Curt Chumbley
## 
### 
Amidst the bicentennial
hoopla, a centennial is passing
almost unnoticed. Onehundred
years ago to the day, the Battle of
Greasy Grass was fought. A week
earlier in that same sad, savage
June of 1876 occurred the
equally important Battle of the
Rosebud, where Crazy Horse
first defeated the Bluecoats.
But Greasy Grass is what we
all remember: Greasy Grass, bet
ter known as Little Bighorn, best
known as Custer's Last Stand.
And surely we do remember
Custer, or was that Errol Flynn?
Greasy Grass may have been
Custer's last stand in a narrow,
literal sense, but to be more
truthful, it was one of a long
series of Indian last stands. Cus
ter bit the dust. Sitting Bull
joined Buffalo Bill's Wild West
Show. Who was it that died?
Making sense of who died is
really quite easy, quite certain.
Pontiac died. Tecumseh died.
Captain Jack died. Crazy Horse
died. Cochise and Geronimo
died. Looking Glass and Chief
Joseph died. Even Sitting Bull
died! (he was shot in the head.)'
Ugly scenes
Difficult to make sense of what
died: the men and their people or
just our memory of them and the
context of their death. 1 suppose
there's no need to paint ugly
scenes of what happened. Dustin
Hoffman will do that for us. Yet,
as we're made increasingly in-'

sensate by the Spirit of '76 celeb
rating Valley Forge, etc.. it seems
increasingly probably that we
might foreverforget Bosque Re
dondo, etc.
Nothing changed
Nothing new can be said. It's a
matter of the past continuing
into the present. Violence, injus
tice, and avarice did not die and
were not buried.
The sacred "Paha Sapa" (black
Hills) of the Sioux were taken for
the gold. The Sioux were asked
to sell. They said no. Despite
Rosebud and Greasy Grass the
land was taken; paid for, yet
taken nonetheless.
The ancestral land of the
Yavapais is going to be flooded
to make a reservoir for Phoenix.
The Yavapais were asked to sell.
They said no. The land is going
to be taken anyway; paid for, yet
taken nonetheless.
Murder repeated
Crazy Horse was murdered at
Fort Robinson in September
1877. The army listed him as kil
led while trying to escape. It was
actually a trap to imprison him
which misfired.
Anna Mae Aquash was mur
dered at Pine Ridge Reservation
in February 1976. The FBI listed
her as dying of exposure. An in
dependent, second autospy re
vealed that Aquash died of a bul
let wound to the head.
What's changed? The
Menominee, Wise, county

sheriff hired eight convicted fe
lons as "special deputies." On
February 3, 1976 John
Waubanascum and Arlin
Pamanet, two Menominee In
dians, were killed by the sheriff
and his deputies.
No shows
What will change? there are
not many encouraging signs.
Stanford students will turn out
in groves to hear Bill Buckley's
cute verbiage, while not more
than 12 will show up to hear De
nnis Banks. Buckley could prob
ably visit South Dakota without
getting killed. Banks probably
could not.
Remember the New Founder's
League. Remember the Indian
mascot issue which ignobled the
pages of the Daily last fall. The
noble savage, or the angry injun:
which decal do you want on
your car? Buy it at your favorite
University Avenue shop.
In some respects we have
come a terribly short way, de
spite our two hundred years. An
unfortunate fact of what we have
made of America in the last two
centuries is what we have made
of the American Indian in the
last century.
Over fifty years ago, E.S. Cur
tis, one of the first to sense what
was dying and who, out of that
sense, produced the massive
twenty volume The North
American Indian (a rare work
available in the Bender Room for

those who don't trust Hol
lywood), addressed himself to
much of what we had made of
the Indian: "We made of him a
race totally discouraged. . .
Forced to the wall, with no es
cape, he has accepted his dull
fate with the grim stoicism of his
race, and has ceased to try to
combat it or avert it.
"Our efforts to extend assis
tance to him have been insincere
and he has known it. . . We have
always wronged the Indian but
the greatest wrongs we are doing
him today are born of our mis
understanding of him."
Perhaps I am a party pooper,
but whose party is it?

Crazy Horse was murdered at
Fort Robinson in September
1877. The army listed him as kil
led while trying to escape. It was
actually a trap to imprison him
which misfired.
Anna Mae Aquash was mur
dered at Pine Ridge Reservation
in February 1976. The FBI listed
her as dying of exposure. An in

No shows

Stanford students will turn out

getting killed. Banks probably
could not.
Remember the New Founder's

In some respects we have
come a terribly short way, de
spite our two hundred years. An
unfortunate fact of what we have
made of America in the last two
centuries is what we have made
of the American Indian in the
last century.
Over fifty years ago, E.S. Cur
tis, one of the first to sense what
was dying and who, out of that
sense, produced the massive
twenty volume The North
American Indian (a rare work
available in the Bender Room for

those who don't trust Hol
lywood), addressed himself to
much of what we had made of
the Indian: "We made of him a
race totally discouraged. . .
Forced to the wall, with no es
cape, he has accepted his dull
fate with the grim stoicism of his
race, and has ceased to try to
combat it or avert it.
"Our efforts to extend assis
tance to him have been insincere
and he has known it. . . We have
always wronged the Indian but
the greatest wrongs we are doing
him today are born of our mis
understanding of him."
Perhaps I am a party pooper,
but whose party is it?

Amidst the bicentennial
hoopla, a centennial is passing
almost unnoticed. Onehundred
years ago to the day, the Battle of
Greasy Grass was fought. A week
earlier in that same sad, savage
June of 1876 occurred the
equally important Battle of the
Rosebud, where Crazy Horse
first defeated the Bluecoats.
But Greasy Grass is what we
all remember: Greasy Grass, bet
ter known as Little Bighorn, best
known as Custer's Last Stand.
And surely we do remember
Custer, or was that Errol Flynn?
Greasy Grass may have been
Custer's last stand in a narrow,
literal sense, but to be more
truthful, it was one of a long
series of Indian last stands. Cus
ter bit the dust. Sitting Bull
joined Buffalo Bill's Wild West
Show. Who was it that died?
Making sense of who died is
really quite easy, quite certain.
Pontiac died. Tecumseh died.
Captain Jack died. Crazy Horse
died. Cochise and Geronimo
died. Looking Glass and Chief
Joseph died. Even Sitting Bull
died! (he was shot in the head.)'
Ugly scenes
Difficult to make sense of what
died: the men and their people or
just our memory of them and the
context of their death. 1 suppose
there's no need to paint ugly
scenes of what happened. Dustin
Hoffman will do that for us. Yet,
as we're made increasingly in-'

sensate by the Spirit of '76 celeb
rating Valley Forge, etc.. it seems
increasingly probably that we
might foreverforget Bosque Re
dondo, etc.
Nothing changed
Nothing new can be said. It's a
matter of the past continuing
into the present. Violence, injus
tice, and avarice did not die and
were not buried.
The sacred "Paha Sapa" (black
Hills) of the Sioux were taken for
the gold. The Sioux were asked
to sell. They said no. Despite
Rosebud and Greasy Grass the
land was taken; paid for, yet
taken nonetheless.
The ancestral land of the
Yavapais is going to be flooded
to make a reservoir for Phoenix.
The Yavapais were asked to sell.
They said no. The land is going
to be taken anyway; paid for, yet
taken nonetheless.
