## Support for Solzhenitsyn 
### 
In the Daily of June 22, an arti
cle titled "Solzhenitsyn mis
guided" is signed by "a National
Fellow at Hoover" who expres
ses "serious and very sincere
dismay" about some recent pro
nouncements of Solzhenitsyn,
especially one which he quotes,
wherein Mr. S. does not come
right out and say that Americans
need improvement.
The National Fellow grants

that Mr. S. has produced some
superb writing. But as to his re
marks about liberty, "much of
their substance is an affront to
the American people."
If Solzhenitsyn ever reads this
outburst, he might well recall
the old adage that a mastiff is not
disturbed by the yapping of a
puppy.

While I. too do not always
agree with Mr. Solzhenitsyn,
Tibor Machan's quibbling with
the former's call for a life of
spiritual improvement on
grounds such as our theaters
being full verges on the ridicul
ous.
And it was not till I got to the
bottom of the article and Tead of
Tibor's editorship of Reason that
I could understand the latter's
call for a "Clear explanation of
what it is to be morally good and
why."
The mystical path leads to
states of consciousness where
form is dissolved, distinctions
between subject and object are
lost by condensation, and verbs
inapplicable where there is
neither time nor space. In such
{states there can be neither
words, speech nor reason, and
the qualifications of academe are
considered Phutility Damnable.
Yet those who have trod these
paths know and testify that he
rein lie the answers to humani
ty's problems, and those with
eyes to see the clues sparkling
like hidden jewels in Aleksandr
Solzhenitsyn's writings know
that he has earned the right to
speak as he does.
