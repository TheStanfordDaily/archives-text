# Long distance dialing
## Phones get safeguards 
### Elisabeth Kihlberg 
The University may save 25 percent on long
distance calls with a new toll system due August
16.
The annual cost for long distance calls here is
almost $1 million.
In the new system, all long distance calls will be
identified by special numbers given to those at
each department authorized to make long dis
tance calls.
"We know that the University telephones are
being used for long distance calls by those who
shouldn't," said Sue Schrotenburg at the tele
communications billing facility, "and with this
new system we will reduce the possibilities."
A person wanting to make a call outside the Bay
Area, but within the continental U.S., will have to
dial "1," followed by the authorization number,
the area code and the phone number. Such calls
will be availably only from University extensions

which currently have long-distance capabilities.
"It's necessary that those who have got an au
thorized number are very careful and don't let it
out," Schrotenburg says." Long distance calls can
be made from many University telephone by
using an authorized number."
"Unlimited" University extensions will no
longer have long-distance capabilities unless they
are put on the new system, according to Marilyn
Kloes of the telecommunications facility.
The new system should save money by combin
ing Wide Area Telecommunication Service
(WATS) with a minicomputer that automatically
selects the least costly available circuits, she said.
"Person-to-person calls will not be necessary
any longer." Schrotenburg explains, "as all calls
shorter than one minute are free."
The system is set up by a private enterprise from
Dallas, Tex., called The Action Communication.
