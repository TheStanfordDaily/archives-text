# Giant book check-out
## 
### 
Students may encounter
some confusion and disor
ganization in the libraries this
summer, but it will all be part
of a plan to eventually remove
confusion and disorganiza
tion.
Library workers will be
shifting 440,000 books in
Main Library and Meyer
Basement, according to Steve
Watkins, an organizer of the
project.
About 100,000 books will
be moved from Main Library
to Meyer Basement to al
leviate over-crowding.
According to Gloria
Stockton, chief of the Circula
tion Department. "In terms of
traditional library practices,
the Main stack is now more
than filled to capacity and has
been for some time. Books on
a shelf are often squeezed to
gether so tightly that a book
cannot be removed without
damaging it."
The rest of the shifting will
be minor relocation of books
within the basement or Main.
The library staff and the
Committee on Libraries
studied the situation and, in
their planning, attempted to
minimize disruption of pat

rons.
Signs have been posted in
certain areas asking patnns
to have library pages locate
their book requests. A.
shift continues, many be
will be far from their regu'er
locations.

As a result of the move,
which is due to be completed
Aug. 31, almost all of the so
cial sciences books will be
shelved in Meyer Basement.
Almost all of the humanities
texis will remain in the Main
stack.
