# Rodgers and Hart at the Showcase in S.F.
## 'Babes in Arms' gay and energetic 
### Don Shimamoto 
If you're looking for some
happy faces, try the Promenade
Company's production of Rod
gers and Hart's Babes in Arms;
you'll see nothing but ear-to-ear
grins for two and a half hours
straight.
Director Glenn Dußose has as
sembled an energetic and
talented cast on the Showcase
Theater stage, and the result is
an entertaining evening of musi
cal comedy.
The original production of
Babes in Arms opened on
Broadway in 1937. As currently
performed, the play has a new
book by George Oppenheimer
(based on the Rodgers and Hart
original) and several additional
tunes borrowed from other Rod
gers and Hart shows.
Unfortunately, the book and
songs don't always mesh to
gether very well, and in the sec
ond act this lack of continuity
becomes fairly serious. For
example, the final number,
"Roxie Music Hall," has nothing
whatsoever to do with the rest of
the play and is offered almost
apologetically, the excuse being
that any good show needs a big
finale.
Plot an inconvenience
However, continuity of plot
hardly seems a reasonable criter
ion on which to fault this play.
Babes in Arms is one of those
musicals in which plot is treated
merely as an inconvenience, a
necessary evil that exists just to
be sandwiched in between the
musical numbers.
What story there is centers
around a group of teenagers
working as apprentices in the
theater workshop of the evil Mr.
Grundy.
Sadly, Grundy specializes in
putting on plays which have al
ready been rejected by all pro
ducers of nonnegative IQ. and
his current effort, a laughable af
firmation of Southern pride enti
tled The Deep North, is no ex
ception. Complications pile
upon complications, until the
inevitable happy ending is fi
nally reached: the "babes" get to
present their revue and soon
after are released from having to
do any further work for Grundy.

The Promenade Company's
players charged through this
story with great exuberance, and
the communication of that
exuberance was immensely en
hanced by the intimacy of the
Showcase.
On the other hand, the small
ness of the Showcase tended to
work against many of the more
ambitious dance numbers. That
director Dußose and correog
rapher Charlet Lee Pulham were
able to fit the entire company
onstage for the ensemble num
bers is an indication of intelli
gent and resourceful staging.
However, once in position, the
dancers looked cramped, and
their mobility was severely re
stricted. Consequently, although
the choreography was both
well-executed and sylistically
faithful to the Thirties (for in
stance, the girls' ensemble for "I
Wish I Were in Love Again" was
given a Golddiggers-tvpe stag
ing), the dances were a trifle bor
ing. There just wasn't enough
maneuvering room, and hence
not enough activity, to sustain
audience interest through many
of the numbers.
Coziness
In contrast, the dances which
worked best were those which
exploited the coziness of the
theater. Thus, two of the most
effective numbers were intimate
duets: the simple ballroom
routine performed to "Where or
When" by Brian Smith and Mary
Cleere Haran and the easy-going
soft shoe with which Haran and
Woodruff accompanied "Moun
tain Greenery."
As might have been expected
from a Richard Rodgers musical,
the main strength of the produc
tion lay in the songs. Rodgers'
deliciously lyrical melodies are
nothing if not singable. Together
with Hart's lyrics, they create a
romantic mood at any tempo.
Babes in Arms is blessed with
a rich assortment from the Rod
gers and Hart repertoire, and, for

the most part, the cast did an ex
ceptional job of presenting the
tunes.
Brian Smith delivered the title
song with power and punch and
teamed with Mary Cleere Haran
for an appropriately dreamy ver
sion of "Where or When." Katey
Laßourdette discharged the part
of Grundy's sassy secretary with
self-assurance and performed
"The Lady Is a Tramp" with joy
ous spunk. Finally, Diana
Caperello's teary-eyed rendition
of "My Funny Valentine" was
one of the highlights of the
show.
In addition, the choral backing
in the ensemble numbers was
strong and secure, conveying the

same energy which charac
terized all the other facets of the
production. The only song
which didn't quite match up to
this standard of excellence was
"Johnny One-Note"; alas, as per
formed as a duet by Laßourdette
and Sam Hamilton, Johnny's one
note was out of tune.
The songs alone make Babes
in Arms a worthwhile play. Add

to this the unpretentious en
thusiasm of the cast, and the
shortcomings of the production
seem less significant, pushed
aside by the energy of the per
formers.
The Showcase is located at
430 Mason Street in San Fran
cisco (421-5355). Curtain times
are Thursday and Friday at 8:30,
Saturday at 7:30 & 10, and Sun
day at 5:30.

Haran plays the part of Jennifer Owen, a teenager making her theatrical debut. Woodruff portrays Steve

BABE FACES Mary Cleere Haran and Barry Woodruff are among the happy-go-lucky stars of the
Promenade Company's current production of Babes in /\rms at the Showcase Theatre in San Francisco!
Haran plays the part of Jennifer Owen, a teenager making her theatrical debut. Woodruff portrays Steve
Edwards, a whiz-kid producer on Broadway. They fall in love.
If you're looking for some
happy faces, try the Promenade
Company's production of Rod
gers and Hart's Babes in Arms;
you'll see nothing but ear-to-ear
grins for two and a half hours
straight.
Director Glenn Dußose has as
sembled an energetic and
talented cast on the Showcase
Theater stage, and the result is
an entertaining evening of musi
cal comedy.
The original production of
Babes in Arms opened on
Broadway in 1937. As currently
performed, the play has a new
book by George Oppenheimer
(based on the Rodgers and Hart
original) and several additional
tunes borrowed from other Rod
gers and Hart shows.
Unfortunately, the book and
songs don't always mesh to
gether very well, and in the sec
ond act this lack of continuity
becomes fairly serious. For
example, the final number,
"Roxie Music Hall," has nothing
whatsoever to do with the rest of
the play and is offered almost
apologetically, the excuse being
that any good show needs a big
finale.
Plot an inconvenience
However, continuity of plot
hardly seems a reasonable criter
ion on which to fault this play.
Babes in Arms is one of those
musicals in which plot is treated
merely as an inconvenience, a
necessary evil that exists just to
be sandwiched in between the
musical numbers.
What story there is centers
around a group of teenagers
working as apprentices in the
theater workshop of the evil Mr.
Grundy.
Sadly, Grundy specializes in
putting on plays which have al
ready been rejected by all pro
ducers of nonnegative IQ. and
his current effort, a laughable af
firmation of Southern pride enti
tled The Deep North, is no ex
ception. Complications pile
upon complications, until the
inevitable happy ending is fi
nally reached: the "babes" get to
present their revue and soon
after are released from having to
do any further work for Grundy.

The Promenade Company's
players charged through this
story with great exuberance, and
the communication of that
exuberance was immensely en
hanced by the intimacy of the
Showcase.
On the other hand, the small
ness of the Showcase tended to
work against many of the more
ambitious dance numbers. That
director Dußose and correog
rapher Charlet Lee Pulham were
able to fit the entire company
onstage for the ensemble num
bers is an indication of intelli
gent and resourceful staging.
However, once in position, the
dancers looked cramped, and
their mobility was severely re
stricted. Consequently, although
the choreography was both
well-executed and sylistically
faithful to the Thirties (for in
stance, the girls' ensemble for "I
Wish I Were in Love Again" was
given a Golddiggers-tvpe stag
ing), the dances were a trifle bor
ing. There just wasn't enough
maneuvering room, and hence
not enough activity, to sustain
audience interest through many
of the numbers.
Coziness
In contrast, the dances which
worked best were those which
exploited the coziness of the
theater. Thus, two of the most
effective numbers were intimate
duets: the simple ballroom
routine performed to "Where or
When" by Brian Smith and Mary
Cleere Haran and the easy-going
soft shoe with which Haran and
Woodruff accompanied "Moun
tain Greenery."
As might have been expected
from a Richard Rodgers musical,
the main strength of the produc
tion lay in the songs. Rodgers'
deliciously lyrical melodies are
nothing if not singable. Together

around a group of teenagers
working as apprentices in the
theater workshop of the evil Mr.
Grundy.
Sadly, Grundy specializes in
putting on plays which have al
ready been rejected by all pro
ducers of nonnegative IQ. and
his current effort, a laughable af
firmation of Southern pride enti
tled The Deep North, is no ex
ception. Complications pile
upon complications, until the
inevitable happy ending is fi
nally reached: the "babes" get to
present their revue and soon
after are released from having to
do any further work for Grundy.

The Promenade Company's
players charged through this
story with great exuberance, and
the communication of that
exuberance was immensely en
hanced by the intimacy of the
Showcase.
On the other hand, the small
ness of the Showcase tended to
work against many of the more
ambitious dance numbers. That
director Dußose and correog
rapher Charlet Lee Pulham were
able to fit the entire company
onstage for the ensemble num
bers is an indication of intelli
gent and resourceful staging.
However, once in position, the
dancers looked cramped, and
their mobility was severely re
stricted. Consequently, although
the choreography was both
well-executed and sylistically
faithful to the Thirties (for in
stance, the girls' ensemble for "I
Wish I Were in Love Again" was
given a Golddiggers-tvpe stag
ing), the dances were a trifle bor
ing. There just wasn't enough
maneuvering room, and hence
not enough activity, to sustain
audience interest through many
of the numbers.
Coziness
In contrast, the dances which
worked best were those which
exploited the coziness of the
theater. Thus, two of the most
effective numbers were intimate
duets: the simple ballroom
routine performed to "Where or
When" by Brian Smith and Mary
Cleere Haran and the easy-going
soft shoe with which Haran and
Woodruff accompanied "Moun
tain Greenery."
As might have been expected
from a Richard Rodgers musical,
the main strength of the produc
tion lay in the songs. Rodgers'
deliciously lyrical melodies are
nothing if not singable. Together
with Hart's lyrics, they create a
romantic mood at any tempo.
Babes in Arms is blessed with
a rich assortment from the Rod
gers and Hart repertoire, and, for

the most part, the cast did an ex
ceptional job of presenting the
tunes.
Brian Smith delivered the title
song with power and punch and
teamed with Mary Cleere Haran
for an appropriately dreamy ver
sion of "Where or When." Katey
Laßourdette discharged the part
of Grundy's sassy secretary with
self-assurance and performed
"The Lady Is a Tramp" with joy
ous spunk. Finally, Diana
Caperello's teary-eyed rendition
of "My Funny Valentine" was
one of the highlights of the
show.
In addition, the choral backing
in the ensemble numbers was
strong and secure, conveying the

same energy which charac
terized all the other facets of the
production. The only song
which didn't quite match up to
this standard of excellence was
"Johnny One-Note"; alas, as per
formed as a duet by Laßourdette
and Sam Hamilton, Johnny's one
note was out of tune.
The songs alone make Babes
in Arms a worthwhile play. Add

to this the unpretentious en
thusiasm of the cast, and the
shortcomings of the production
seem less significant, pushed
aside by the energy of the per
formers.
The Showcase is located at
430 Mason Street in San Fran
cisco (421-5355). Curtain times
are Thursday and Friday at 8:30,
Saturday at 7:30 & 10, and Sun

BABE FACES Mary Cleere Haran and Barry Woodruff are among the happy-go-lucky stars of the
Promenade Company's current production of Babes in /\rms at the Showcase Theatre in San Francisco!
Haran plays the part of Jennifer Owen, a teenager making her theatrical debut. Woodruff portrays Steve
Edwards, a whiz-kid producer on Broadway. They fall in love.
If you're looking for some
happy faces, try the Promenade
Company's production of Rod
gers and Hart's Babes in Arms;
you'll see nothing but ear-to-ear
grins for two and a half hours
straight.
Director Glenn Dußose has as
sembled an energetic and
talented cast on the Showcase
Theater stage, and the result is
an entertaining evening of musi
cal comedy.
The original production of
Babes in Arms opened on
Broadway in 1937. As currently
performed, the play has a new
book by George Oppenheimer
(based on the Rodgers and Hart
original) and several additional
tunes borrowed from other Rod
gers and Hart shows.
Unfortunately, the book and
songs don't always mesh to
gether very well, and in the sec
ond act this lack of continuity
becomes fairly serious. For
example, the final number,
"Roxie Music Hall," has nothing
whatsoever to do with the rest of
the play and is offered almost
apologetically, the excuse being
that any good show needs a big
finale.
Plot an inconvenience
However, continuity of plot
hardly seems a reasonable criter
ion on which to fault this play.
Babes in Arms is one of those
musicals in which plot is treated
merely as an inconvenience, a
necessary evil that exists just to
be sandwiched in between the
musical numbers.
What story there is centers
around a group of teenagers
working as apprentices in the
theater workshop of the evil Mr.
Grundy.

ready been rejected by all pro
