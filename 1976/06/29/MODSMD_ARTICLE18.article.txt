Marine not guilty
SAN DIEGO —A Marine drill in
structor charged with involuntary man
slaughter in the training death of a young
Texas recruit was acquitted of all charges
by a court-martial board last night.
Sergeant Harojd Bronson of Freeport,
Florida, had argued that he was only fol
lowing orders from superiors in the
training drill involving 20-year-old Pri
vate Lynn McClure. McClure was
knocked unconscious during a series of
pugil stick bouts last December, and died
three months later, still unconscious.
The court-martial board accepted
Bronson's argument that he was only try
ing to get McGlure to show motivation,
and not pushing him beyond his limits as
the government had charged.
Economic summit ends
DORADO. Puerto Rico—Announcing
a "sweeping policy of cooperation,
leaders of seven large industrial nations
yesterday concluded their economic
summit conference.
The two-day conference, aimed at im
proving economic conditions in the
non-communist world, was attended by
heads of state from the United States,
France. Britain. West Germany, Japan,
Ganada and Italy-

President Gerald Ford, who addressed
the meeting, said the talks represented "a
significant step forward in relations
among the industrial democracies."
As the leaders met in the isolated
Dorado Beach Hotel, strikes by cab driv
ers, bus drivers and telephone company
employees snarled transportation and
communications throughout the island.
Mercenaries sentenced
LUANDA, Angola—An Angolan tri
bunal yesterday sentenced American
Vietnam war veteran Daniel Gearhart
and three Englishmen to death for fight
ing as mercenaries in the Angolan civil
war.
Nine other American and British mer
cenaries were given prison sentences
ranging from 16 to 30 years.
In announcing the verdict, chief judge
Ernesto Da Silva said the United States
and Britain shared the guilt of the con
victed men, who fought for the losing
pro-Western Angolan faction.

Among those sentenced to death was
Tony Callan, the mercenary leader who
ordered the killing of 14 British mer
cenaries who demanded to go home.
The Angolan judges indicated that
Gearhart was condemned in part because
he sought employment as a mercenary
through classified advertisements.
Six months ago Gearhart placed a clas
sified ad in the spring issue in Soldier of
Fortune magazine offering his services
as a mercenary. He was contacted by an
American recruiter, David Bufkin, who
was working for the right-wing Angolan
forces.
The British government has asked
President Agostino Neto to grant a stay of
execution, and American attorneys were
drawing up an appeal for mercy last
night.
Beirut's bloody battle
BEIRUT—The war-torn Lebanese cap
ital continued to struggle through the
ravages of conflict yesterday as a bloody

six-day battle against two Palestinian re
fugee camps continued.
In the southeastern part of the city,
rei nforced Christian troops claimed their
siege of the two camps was on the verge
of victory, and demanded an uncondi
tional surrender. The leftists refused,
and the battle, which has already
claimed 1000 lives, continued.

Mercenaries sentenced
LUANDA, Angola—An Angolan tri
bunal yesterday sentenced American
Vietnam war veteran Daniel Gearhart
and three Englishmen to death for fight
ing as mercenaries in the Angolan civil
war.
Nine other American and British mer
cenaries were given prison sentences
ranging from 16 to 30 years.
In announcing the verdict, chief judge
Ernesto Da Silva said the United States
and Britain shared the guilt of the con
victed men, who fought for the losing
pro-Western Angolan faction.

Among those sentenced to death was
Tony Callan, the mercenary leader who
ordered the killing of 14 British mer
cenaries who demanded to go home.
The Angolan judges indicated that
Gearhart was condemned in part because
he sought employment as a mercenary
through classified advertisements.
Six months ago Gearhart placed a clas
sified ad in the spring issue in Soldier of
Fortune magazine offering his services
as a mercenary. He was contacted by an
American recruiter, David Bufkin, who
was working for the right-wing Angolan
forces.
The British government has asked
President Agostino Neto to grant a stay of
execution, and American attorneys were
drawing up an appeal for mercy last
night.
Beirut's bloody battle
BEIRUT—The war-torn Lebanese cap
ital continued to struggle through the
ravages of conflict yesterday as a bloody

six-day battle against two Palestinian re
fugee camps continued.
In the southeastern part of the city,
rei nforced Christian troops claimed their
siege of the two camps was on the verge
of victory, and demanded an uncondi
tional surrender. The leftists refused,
and the battle, which has already
claimed 1000 lives, continued.

slaughter in the training death of a young
Texas recruit was acquitted of all charges
by a court-martial board last night.

Florida, had argued that he was only fol
lowing orders from superiors in the
training drill involving 20-year-old Pri

knocked unconscious during a series of
pugil stick bouts last December, and died
