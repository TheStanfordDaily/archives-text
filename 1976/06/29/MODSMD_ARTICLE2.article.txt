# Task force looks at tenure policy
## 
### Pan Demetrakakes 
A task force of five faculty
members and four students,
created by the Council of Presi
dents (COP) to study the effect of
current tenure policy on under
graduate education, held its first
meeting yesterday.
In a charge to the task force,
the COP suggested that it
explore the relationships bet
ween tenure and teaching, bet
ween promotion and teaching,
and between teaching and re
search.
"These are questions 1 think
the task force should be looking
at." said Vic Petroff, chairman of
the COP. He added, however,
that the teaching/research matter
is "a much more complex ques
tion than teaching versus re
search."
The chairman of the task force
is Larry Diamond, a graduate
student in sociology.
"I think that the desire of the
COP is to get at the evidence and
cut through preconceptions,"
Diamond said.
"For the last few years people
have been dealing only in
hunches," he added. "They have
been mainly basing their judg

ments on dramatic cases which
may or may not be indicative of
the entire situation."
"Some people say teaching
isn't valued at all, others deny
that; there's a contradiction," he
said.
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall, a faculty member on
the committee, was more
specific as to who "some
people" were.
"We're trying to respond to
the rising student concern that
good teachers are being denied
tenure," he said.
"Even after people get tenure,
that's not the end of the prob
lem," Marshall added. "Salary
advancements may depend on
amount of research versus
amount of teaching."
When Marshall was director of
the Study of Undergraduate
Education in 1956, he had ques
tionnaires assessing attitudes
toward tenure mailed to every
member of the Academic Coun
cil. One question asked the re
spondent to mark on a scale what
he felt was the relative impor
tance of teaching versus re
search. One end of the scale
meant that teaching was all
important, the other meant that
research was all-important, and
the points in between rep
resented varying degrees of im
portance of both.
"The modal (most frequent)
response was one notch from the
research end," Marshall said.
Diamond indicated that the
task force would probably do a
survey of faculty members. He
also said that "there are a lot of
facts and figures in the Provost's
Office on promotions" that the
task force might try to utilize.
He said that the task force's

primary role is to gather evi
dence, but that it might make re
commendations for change "if
people see the system of tenure
as having a negative effect."
Petroff explained why the
charge to the task force addres
ses only undergraduate educa
tion.
"It was very difficult to come
down to a one-sentence focus of
this thing," he said. "Many of
the things which are found out
about the impact of the tenure
process on undergraduate edu
cation will be found to be
applicable to graduate education
as well."

the COP. He added, however,
that the teaching/research matter
is "a much more complex ques
tion than teaching versus re
search."
The chairman of the task force
is Larry Diamond, a graduate
student in sociology.
"I think that the desire of the
COP is to get at the evidence and
cut through preconceptions,"
Diamond said.
"For the last few years people
have been dealing only in
hunches," he added. "They have
been mainly basing their judg

ments on dramatic cases which
may or may not be indicative of
the entire situation."
"Some people say teaching
isn't valued at all, others deny
that; there's a contradiction," he
said.
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall, a faculty member on
the committee, was more
specific as to who "some
people" were.
"We're trying to respond to
the rising student concern that
good teachers are being denied
tenure," he said.
"Even after people get tenure,
that's not the end of the prob
lem," Marshall added. "Salary
advancements may depend on
amount of research versus
amount of teaching."
When Marshall was director of
the Study of Undergraduate
Education in 1956, he had ques
tionnaires assessing attitudes
toward tenure mailed to every
member of the Academic Coun
cil. One question asked the re
spondent to mark on a scale what
he felt was the relative impor
tance of teaching versus re
search. One end of the scale
meant that teaching was all
important, the other meant that
research was all-important, and
the points in between rep
resented varying degrees of im
portance of both.
"The modal (most frequent)
response was one notch from the
research end," Marshall said.
Diamond indicated that the
task force would probably do a
survey of faculty members. He
also said that "there are a lot of
facts and figures in the Provost's
Office on promotions" that the
task force might try to utilize.
He said that the task force's

primary role is to gather evi
dence, but that it might make re
commendations for change "if
people see the system of tenure
as having a negative effect."
Petroff explained why the
charge to the task force addres
ses only undergraduate educa
tion.
"It was very difficult to come
down to a one-sentence focus of
this thing," he said. "Many of
the things which are found out
about the impact of the tenure
process on undergraduate edu
cation will be found to be
applicable to graduate education
as well."
A task force of five faculty
members and four students,
created by the Council of Presi
dents (COP) to study the effect of
current tenure policy on under
graduate education, held its first
meeting yesterday.
In a charge to the task force,
the COP suggested that it
explore the relationships bet
ween tenure and teaching, bet
ween promotion and teaching,
and between teaching and re
search.
"These are questions 1 think
the task force should be looking
at." said Vic Petroff, chairman of
the COP. He added, however,
