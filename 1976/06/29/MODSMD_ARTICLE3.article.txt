The men are all seasoned
veterans, professionals who
have held their jobs for no less
than 11 and as long as 30
years.
They have all served ap

the details and fine points of
their craft.
But these craftsmen, the 10

while the linotypists will
either retire, be relocated in
less skilled positions
elsewhere in the University
or find work outside of Stan
ford. But, as one linotypist
says, his new job won't be as a
linotypist.
"Times change," he says
wistfully. "I'll get another
job, but it won't be operating
one of these machines."

OUTDATED EQUIPMENT—This row of linotype machines uses a "hot lead" system which is rapidly
becoming obsolete. Rather than replace them with modern typesetting equipment, the Stanford Press
will close up shop. .
