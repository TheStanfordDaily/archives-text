# Laid-off linotypists face tough times
## 
### Brian Aronstam 
The men are all seasoned
veterans, professionals who
have held their jobs for no less
than 11 and as long as 30
years.
They have all served ap
prenticeships of four to six
years, absorbing in that time
the details and fine points of
their craft.
But these craftsmen, the 10
highly skilled operators of the
linotype machines at the
University press, will soon
have to give up their
specialized jobs. Last spring,
the University decided to
close the printing operation
because of a decline in the
demand for the press' print
ing coupled with a fear of
sinking a good deal of money
into new typographical
equipment.
The linotype system that
the press currently utilizes
uses lead to produce castings
for each line of type. To be

come a modern, efficient op
eration. the University
claims, the press would have
to lease or purchase
computer-operated photo
typesetting units.
But such an investment
—"of $750,000 to $1 mill
ion over three years," accord
ing to Vice President for Bus
iness and Finance Robert Au
gsburger. "the University is
not prepared to make."
The University will con
tract the printing out instead,
while the linotypists will
either retire, be relocated in
less skilled positions
elsewhere in the University
or find work outside of Stan
ford. But, as one linotypist
says, his new job won't be as a
linotypist.
"Times change," he says
wistfully. "I'll get another
job, but it won't be operating
one of these machines."

work the day shift here won't
deny that their machine is, in
many cases, uneconomical
and impractical, when com
pared with the high-speed
computerized phototypeset
ting machines. Yet the
linotypists, who have a com
bined total of 101 years of ex
perience operating the
machines, at the same time
maintain that the linotype is
"irreplaceable"for other jobs.
Only the linotype, notes an
operator who prefers to re
main anonymous, can, for
example, produce a diploma
with an impression in it.
"The phototypesetting
machines just can't do that,"
he observes.
Still, the linotypists' admi
ration for their 150 year old
machines is not immune to
the realization that, as one
linotypist observes. "You can
do a lot of things on the new
ones (the phototypesetting
machines). It's really fascinat
ing."
The senior linotypist at the
press, who has kept abreast of
the new developments in
printing, hopes to work with
the computerized systems
once the linotype machines
are permanently shut down.
"I'll stay connected with
printing," he asserts confi
dently, "it's too much a part
of me."
Other linotypists, however,
will have to leave behind not
just the machines —
machines for which each ad

mittedly has "a lot of affec
tion," but the field of printing
altogether.
There is, as one linotypist

observes, "a lot of bitterness"
among these craftsmen who
have dedicated their lives to
this vanishing profession.

neither can anyone else.
