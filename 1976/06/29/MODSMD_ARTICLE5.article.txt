## Palms and Solzhenitsyn 
### 
Tree pay
In these days of budget cutting
on all sides. I would like to know
who paid for moving the world's
ugliest palm trees.

The Devil's argument
Tibor Machan retorts in his
closing remarks (Daily. June 22)
as follows: "We. Mr. Solzhenit
syn, have done mighty well,
thank you, and even without
some of your carefully consi
dered advice. We thank you for
your warning about the
Communist â€” some of us were
about to forget. And we thank
you for the superb writing you
have produced. But we are quite
good in many areas ourselves."
Of all his glib remarks this last

is the most dangerous. It brings
to mind a story about a commit
tee meeting held in Hell.
The topic under discussion by
the devils present was how to
increase the population down
below. It was agreed that what
must be done is change the di
rection of those people inhabit
ing earth who were still trying to
improve, and thus were heading
in the wrong direction.
Three major proposals were
offered. The first, that these
people be convinced that there
was no God, was rejected. The
second proposal, that all manner
of sensual sin be laid before them
in an irresistibly enticing man
ner, was greeter with en
thusiasm by the majority of les
ser devils but was rejected by the
Chief Devil who held the veto
power.
The final proposal was offered
by a very straight-looking devil
in a business suit: Convince
them that they are doing all
right, that they haven't got any
thing to worry about. This prop
osition was accepted.
A unique dimension of this
nation's vitality is that she has
not shied away from critical
self-appraisal. We have not "ma
turely" accepted our flaws but
are still hacking away at them.
We can afford to listen openly to

Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's ob
servations. We can thoughtfully
dissent or we can reply "Please
b'e patient, God isn't finished
with us yet." What we can not
afford to do is to shut our hearts
and minds as a nation, or as in
dividuals, for that is the sure
path to stagnation.
