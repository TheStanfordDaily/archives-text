## The 						Hayflick case 
### 
Eugene Robin

In the June 18 issue of Science
there is a particulary impressive
and sensitive letter from Zhores
Medvedev concerning Dr.
Leonard Hayflick. Not only does
it provide a more rounded view
of the issues, but it leaves me
uneasy and with some feelings
of guilt.
Dr. Hayflick's problem was
handled at Stanford administra
tively and ultimately by an at
torney. The faculty was not in
volved in any segment of the
decision-making process and
perhaps that's proper. On the
other hand, Re was a distin
guished and respected col
league. The basis of his resigna
tion inevitably involved
academic considerations. These
considerations were ignored by
me and I suspect most of the fa
culty.
Implicit in Medvedev's letter
is the recognition of the problem
of increasing bureaucratic
domination of all activities. It
has been observed that the
Soviet and American economic
systems show increasingly simi
lar behavior.

Analyzing Medvedev's com
ments, it could be inferred that
the two systems may also be
converging with respect to poli
tics and values. Did Stanford act
in a manner appropriate to a
great university? I suspect that
we reacted to Hayflick as might
Moscow University to Med
vedev.
1 do not know the "true" facts
involved in Hayflick's resigna
tion. Whatever these facts are, I
believe that as a faculty, we did
have an important responsibility
for insuring him an adequate
forum and insisting on a pre
sumption of innocence (until
and if proven guilty).
If our faculty forfeits its re
sponsibility for intellectual hon
esty to lawyers, administrators
and accountants, who will be
next?
(Editor's note: Leonard Hayflick,
a professor of medical mic
robiology, resigned last spring
during a dispute over cell cul
tures ivith which he was en
trusted.
(Eugene Robin, M.D., is a pro/es
sorof medicine and physiology.)
