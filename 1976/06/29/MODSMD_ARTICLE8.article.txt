# Bicentennial-in-the-Box

Even with the work of ad agencies all across the
country, the spirit of this Bicentennial, America's
200 th birthday, did not hit me until a few days
ago.
Somehow I had been able to move through the
first half of 1976 without encountering the stars
'n' stripes underwear, the Thomas Jefferson
tumblers, the colonial Ford station wagons and
Philadelphia cream cheese.
This year was more or less like any other year
for me. except for the Benedict Arnold transmis
sion I had to have put in my 95,000 mile-old
Pontiac. /
But I drove into one of America's most Ameri
can institutions last week and the waves of pat
riotism hit like a can of creamed corn from thirty
paces.
It was late, and I felt hungry and could think of
no better place to go than Jack-in-the-Box. I drove
around the drive-in loop and stopped in front of
the smiling face and sign decreeing "Wait here
and Jack will speak to you."
But it wasn't Jack-in-the-Box who was waiting
there, glibly smiling at me with a neon grin. It was
George Washington-in-the-Box. And only the
crackling of the intercom and the almost incohe
rent "May I take your order please?" brought me
back to my senses.
"Hi there," I said. "I see the spirit of the Bicen
tennial has reached the fast-food dispensaries."
"Would you like cheese on that?" George
asked.
"Wait." I said. "I come in peace. I would like to
discuss something with you."
There was a short pause. "Are you going to
order, sir?"
I could see it was no use. In his transformation
to commercial enterprise the Father of our Coun
try was not going to take time to discuss
philosophy and the affairs of state. "I'd like a
Minuteman Jack and a regular patriotic burger."
"Would you like cheese on vour minuteman?"

"Will it slow him down?" I countered.
"Anything else sir?"
"Yes, french fries."
There was a short pause. The box crackled with
static. "Would you like the small fries or the
Jumbo LaSalle Fries?"
My hands began to shake and my throat went
dry. I could see 200 years of glory passing before
my eyes; soldiers, surgeons, seamen, and little
kids in orange hats playing flutes, beating drums
and carrying banners proclaiming "You Deserve a
Break Today," "Have It Your Way," and "Watch
out Mac Donalds." My eyes watered.
"I'll have the small fries," I said with breaking
voice, "and a regular John Paul Jones rootbeer."
"Okay," George said, "That's one minuteman
minus the cheese, a patriot, fries and John Paul
Jones. Anything else for you tonight sir? A hot
Valley Forge turnover?"
"No," I cried. "Enough!" It was crushing me to
think I had ignored the Bicentennial, but
heartwarming to think that all was not yet lost,
that the Fourth of July was yet to come, and that 1
could still salvage my patriotic spirits and help
America make this birthday a most memorable
one.
I drove blindly to pay and pickup my order. A
fat kid with glasses poked his head out the win
dow wearing a three-cornered hat with Jack-in
the-Box stenciled across the front.
"That'll be $2.41 with tariffs," he said, and
handed me a red-white-and-blue sack filled with
America.
I tossed a five dollar bil 1 at him. "Keep it," I said.
"And bless you," He looked at me strangely and
closed the window.
When I got home, my mouth watering for the
taste of Democratic Freedom, I found the food
ironically familiar, and went to bed with indiges
tion.
Happy Birthday. Unk.
