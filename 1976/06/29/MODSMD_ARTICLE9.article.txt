## 
### Chris Baker 
Stanford lost a baseball coach
and gained an administrator yes
terday.
Head baseball coach Ray
Young, who this season etched
his name into the Card record
books as the winningest baseball
coach in school history with 323
wins, has been named assistant
athletic director.
The announcement by Stan
ford Sports Information Director
Gary Caval li came as no surprise.
Two years ago Athletic Depart
ment officials announced that
Young was "in training" for an
administrative position in the
department.
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
said Young's appointment
should provide some "con
tinuity" in the department, since
several top administrators are
within seven years of retirement
age.
"Ray is a superb adminis
trator," said Ruetz. "He has de
veloped a first-rate baseball
program and is a leader among
baseball coaches."
Young will report to Assoc.
Athletic Director Bob Young.
His duties will include game op
erations, tickets and golf course
operations.-

Young, 41, never had a losing
season in nine years here as
baseball coach. As a player, he
starred on the mound and in the
outfield. A three-time All-
Conference player, Young was
named Stanford MVP in 1954
and '56.
After graduating from here in
1956, he posted a 6-1 record with
Billings, Mont., of the Pioneer

League.
With the appointment of
Young, Stanford Athletic De
partment officials will begin the
search for a new baseball coach.
Mark Marquess, a former
Ail-American first baseman
here, will be a candidate for the
job. Marquess has assisted
Young since 1969.
