## Profs help pilot Viking

One bicentennial celebration th.it won't be
coming off as planned is the Viking landing on
Mars. And we (.111 thank .1 couple of Stanford
professors for that.
George Tvler. .111 adjunct professor in the Stan
ford Electronics Laboratories and Von Kshleman.
a professor in Electrical Engineering, .ire deeply
involved with radar investigation of proposed
Viking landing sites.
But they comprise only <i third of the group ot
Stanford professors who have been spending
most of their time lately at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena.
NASA scientists decided last Saturday, on the
basis of new high-resolution photographs and
earth-based radar data, that the original landing
site was too rough. America's lirst attempt to
place a space craft on the red planet will be de
layed for a couple of weeks while a new site is
selected.
Surface texture
Tyler and Eshleman have been working closely
with NASA on this portion of the Viking expedi
tion. Tvler heads the team of scientists which
checks out the surface texture of proposed land
ing sites.
Eshleman is the chairman of a NASA committee
that reviews the use of radar findings in making a
final selection of a site. Moth thought that the
"prime" site in <1 Martian plain known as
"Chryse" was unsafe.
Four other Stanford scientists are parti< ipating
in the project, in a variety of fields. Nobel laureate
Joshua Lederberg and Elliott Levinthal art 1 inves
tigating the possibility of detecting life on Mars
Lederberg is part of a team operating lite
detecting instruments on the Viking lander.
Levinthal is second in command of the "lander

imaging" group. ami has developed computer
programs for analyzing television pictures sent
hat k by Viking.
Robert kovach. of'the (ieophysics Department,
is studying the seismology of Mars. Sidney
l.iehes. .mother member ot the lander imaging
team, is .1 member of the Medical S( boot's C.ene
tics Department.
Stanford's greatest ( ontribntion so far has prob
ablv been the radar astronomy research, used to
select ,i safe landing spot.
Surface roughness is .1 serious concern to Vik
ing scientists. They have 110 control over the pre
cise landing spot —and Viking is not equipped to
avoid such hazards .is boulders and steep hill
sides. banding on a rock as small .is one foot high
could dangerously tilt the craft
Selection of Viking landing sites was made se\
eral vears ago. on the basis of photographs re
turned from the marathon flight of Mariner 0
Mariner's 7.0(10 detailed pit tures revealed gigan
tic volcanoes. .1 va I ley that extends one-fifth olt he
wav around the planet, and possible evidence ot
water hav ing flowed sometime in the past.
Despite the quality of the photographs returned
b\ Mariner 0. scientists were not able to tell
exact Iv where a space( ratt could land sat el v. The
resolution of the photos was not good enough
Radar astronomy
Hut radar astronomy < anbeused to estimatethe
qualities of the surface, ami Kshleinan's < ommit
tee recommended that .1 landing site should be
examined hv both photographs and radar before it
is selected for landing.
The photographs an provided by the Viking
orbiter. Tyler's team provides the rest Ihe giant
antennas at (ioldstone California and Arecibe.
