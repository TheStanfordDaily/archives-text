Can you give me some advice on
fireworks? I've seen those Red
Devil stands around town but
have never bought anything, as
suming that legal fireworks
would be too "safe and sane" to
be interesting. -G./.S.
To satisfy your curiosity our
staff purchased a $6.95 box of
Red Devil fireworks. The kit
supposedly contains "61
pieces." but since this includes
30 sparklers. 12 snakes and five
pieces of punk it's not quite the
bicentennial bargain you've
been waiting for.
Selected by unanimous
acclaim as the best all-around
fireworks were the "ground
bloom flowers." which resemble
small firecrackers. When ignited
they spin rapidly, making a
swooshing noise and forming a
small flower which turns red,
green and gold. Although each
lasts for only about 3'/2 seconds.

they're well worth the 50 cents.
We also were impressed by the
"full blossoms" which are sus
pended by a string and revolve,
shooting out colored light. An
added bonus comes at the end
when the string also catches fire,
dropping the burning mass on
top of whatever happens to be
below, in our case a pile of dry
leaves.
Another unusual firework is
the "Piccolo Pete" which emits
an extremely irritating high
pitched whine for 10-15 sec
onds. Like many of the safe
fireworks, the Piccolo Pete can
be made unsafeby simply pinch
ing it halfway down with a pair
of pliers. In this case, after
screeching for awhile, it will
explode in the face of the unfor
tunate sleeper under whose
window it has cleverly been
placed. Pinched too high, it
more justly explodes in the face
of the person who sets it off.
Our last recommendation is
the Cabin of Smoke. Although
ours proved to be rather a dud
(no smoke came out the win
dows and the cabin chimney
went up in flames after the first
second), we have it on good au
thority that these are generally
very intriguing little devices,
especially in closed rooms.
We would advise against any
of the lightning cone fountains,
especially the bigger ones,
which are quite expensive and
more like a hyper-active colored
sparkler than anything else.
Finally, believe it or not, the
magic "snakes" which spurt out
lengths of ash. mesmerized our
staff for nearly 15 minutes. We

advise purchasing the colored
snakes which aren't the least bit
colored but tend to work better
than the black ones.
Incidentally, if you're going to
try some of these do it anywhere
but Palo Alto. "Safe and sane"
fireworks are permissible in Los
Altos, San Mateo County and the
Stanford campus, but all (in
cluding snakes and sparklers)
are technically outlawed in
finicky Palo Alto.

Whose eye ivas used at the top of
the pyramid on the one-dollar
bill? -A.S.
This is one of those bits of his
torical trivia which is unavaila
ble to even our diligent staff.
However, it's supposed to be
God's eye.
The eye is part of the great seal
of the United States; designed by
Charles Parton, an authority on
heraldry. It took three congres
sional committees six year:, to
finally come up with the seal,
proving that things haven't
changed all that much since
1776. The seal was finally ac
cepted by Congress in 1782.
The light surrounding the eye
is called a "glory," and its loca
tion at the top of the pyramid
symbolizes the placing of the
spiritual over the material. The
motto at the top (Annuit Coept is)
means "He has favored our un
dertakings." At the base is the
motto "Novus Ordo Seclorjm"
(A New Order of the Ages) and
thoseubiquitousnumerals 1776.

Devil stands around town but
have never bought anything, as
suming that legal fireworks
would be too "safe and sane" to
be interesting. -G./.S.
To satisfy your curiosity our
staff purchased a $6.95 box of
Red Devil fireworks. The kit
supposedly contains "61
pieces." but since this includes
30 sparklers. 12 snakes and five
pieces of punk it's not quite the
bicentennial bargain you've
been waiting for.
Selected by unanimous
acclaim as the best all-around
fireworks were the "ground
bloom flowers." which resemble
small firecrackers. When ignited
they spin rapidly, making a
swooshing noise and forming a
small flower which turns red,
green and gold. Although each
lasts for only about 3'/2 seconds.

they're well worth the 50 cents.
We also were impressed by the
"full blossoms" which are sus
pended by a string and revolve,
shooting out colored light. An
added bonus comes at the end
when the string also catches fire,
dropping the burning mass on
top of whatever happens to be
below, in our case a pile of dry
leaves.
Another unusual firework is
the "Piccolo Pete" which emits
an extremely irritating high
pitched whine for 10-15 sec
onds. Like many of the safe
fireworks, the Piccolo Pete can
be made unsafeby simply pinch
ing it halfway down with a pair
of pliers. In this case, after
screeching for awhile, it will
explode in the face of the unfor
tunate sleeper under whose
window it has cleverly been
placed. Pinched too high, it
more justly explodes in the face
of the person who sets it off.
Our last recommendation is
the Cabin of Smoke. Although
ours proved to be rather a dud
(no smoke came out the win
dows and the cabin chimney
went up in flames after the first
second), we have it on good au
thority that these are generally
very intriguing little devices,
especially in closed rooms.
We would advise against any
of the lightning cone fountains,
especially the bigger ones,
which are quite expensive and
more like a hyper-active colored
sparkler than anything else.
Finally, believe it or not, the
magic "snakes" which spurt out
lengths of ash. mesmerized our
staff for nearly 15 minutes. We

advise purchasing the colored
snakes which aren't the least bit
colored but tend to work better
than the black ones.
Incidentally, if you're going to
try some of these do it anywhere
but Palo Alto. "Safe and sane"
fireworks are permissible in Los
Altos, San Mateo County and the
Stanford campus, but all (in
cluding snakes and sparklers)
are technically outlawed in
finicky Palo Alto.

Whose eye ivas used at the top of
the pyramid on the one-dollar
bill? -A.S.
This is one of those bits of his
torical trivia which is unavaila
ble to even our diligent staff.
However, it's supposed to be
God's eye.
The eye is part of the great seal
of the United States; designed by
Charles Parton, an authority on
heraldry. It took three congres
sional committees six year:, to
finally come up with the seal,
proving that things haven't
changed all that much since
1776. The seal was finally ac
cepted by Congress in 1782.
The light surrounding the eye
is called a "glory," and its loca
tion at the top of the pyramid
symbolizes the placing of the
spiritual over the material. The
motto at the top (Annuit Coept is)
means "He has favored our un
dertakings." At the base is the
motto "Novus Ordo Seclorjm"
(A New Order of the Ages) and
thoseubiquitousnumerals 1776.
