If the landing goes well, Lev
inthal's lander imaging work
will quickly go into effect. Just
25 seconds after touchdown, one
of the lander's two cameras will
photograph one of the footpads
and the dirt surrounding it. 18
minutes later, if all has gone
well, man's first look at the Mar
tian landscape will appear on
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
monitors.
A second photograph, which
will be taken before the first gets
half-way to Earth, will be a
wide-angle panorama of the
scene surrounding the lander.

The photographs taken by
Viking will be computer
processed with a number of new
techniques designed by Levint
hal and Liebes.
Not only are the programs de
signed to enhance the contrast of
the pictures, but it will be possi
ble to use the stereoscopic effect
of the two cameras to produce
geometric transformations. For
example, one program can pro
duce a photograph that appears
to be taken from directly above
the surface.
Sandbox
They will also be used to
create a full-sized three
dimensional replica of Viking's
surroundings — in a fancy
sandbox in Pasadena. The model
will be used to plan another facet
of the project's investigation: the
sampling of Martian soil. Scien
tists will use it to direct the ac

tions of a 10-foot-long scoop.
The material collected by the
scoop will be deposited in three
compartments in the lander,
each of which contains a diffe
rent biology detection experi
ment.
Scientists aren't certain what
exactly constitutes life, but they
hope that the experiments will
detect it if it is there. Their tests
generally assume that Martian
life forms will exhibit some of
the same activities as terrestrial
beings. But if nothing is found, it
does not necessarily mean that
Mars is barren; it might just
mean that Viking landed in the
wrong place.
This is just the beginning of
the scientific research planned
for Viking.
And then Viking 2 will arrive
on August 7, and they'll start all
over again.

rent biology detection experi
ment.
Scientists aren't certain what
exactly constitutes life, but they
hope that the experiments will
detect it if it is there. Their tests
generally assume that Martian
life forms will exhibit some of
the same activities as terrestrial
beings. But if nothing is found, it
does not necessarily mean that
Mars is barren; it might just
mean that Viking landed in the
wrong place.
This is just the beginning of
the scientific research planned
for Viking.
And then Viking 2 will arrive
on August 7, and they'll start all
over again.
