# 'That's Entertainment, Part II'
## MGM sequel lacks continuity 
### Howard Baldwin 
Why do I have a queasy feeling
about panning That's Enter
tainment, Part II? Because it's a
sin to pan movies that everyone
loves. But, as I said
last year at this very same time
with Jaws, objectivity is the
name of the game.
Fred Astaire at 77 and Gene
Kelly at 63 introduce the edited
film clips from all the great and
not-so-great Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer films that weren't clipped
for That's Entertainment. As
taire looks great for 77; Kelly
looks like he fell into a vat of
pancake makeup.
They sing new lyrics to the
tune of Howard Dietz' and Ar
thur Schwartz' "That's Enter
tainment." a song from 1953's
The Band Wagon. They even
dance new steps choreographed
by Kelly, on a set of futuristic
geometric designs that clash
pathetically with the antiquity of
the films.
The original was written, pro
duced and directed by Jack
Haley, Jr., the son of the Tin
Woodman of Oz. The sequel was
written by Leonard Gershe, pro
duced by Saul Chaplin and
Daniel Melnick, two MGM
executives, and directed by
Kelly. Perhaps here's where ev
erything went wrong. The
sequel doesn't have the focus
that the original had, because the
aforementioned quartet tried to
encompass too much.
Instead of concentrating on
musicals, whoever was making
the decisions haphazardly
dashed through the vaults pick
ing up whatever was considered
great, or at least appropriate.
Appropriate does not necessar

ily mean good, because we're
treated to ridicule of Traveltalks
newsreels, the role of the
songwriter in films and the
Jeanette McDonald-Nelson Eddy
operattas, which once again
prove that the couple was the
funniest pair to hit Hollywood
since Burns and Allen.
The result of these conglomer
ations includes the Rhett Butler
departure scene from Gone With
The Wind, Lassie's return in Las
sie Come Home, Tarzan's intro
duction to Jane, among others.
Comedy scenes have also been
injected to round things out, but
they tend to make the film more
bloated than comprehensive.
Apparently the producers
couldn't decide whether to have
comedy or not, because what few
scenes there are — like the
stateroom scene from the Marx
Brothers' A Night At The Opera
— are obviously edited for
length, but not necessarily for
clarity, as are some of the musi
cal numbers.
Either give us comedy in its
entirety, or musical numbers in
their entirety, or great scenes
from great movies in their en
tirety, but don't give us snippets
of trivia that we don't even have
time to savor.
We even have short flashes of
Buster Keaton and Laurel and
Hardy, which is the very height
of MGM chutzpah, since it was
that studio which turned Keaton
into an alcoholic and helped
drive Laurel and Hardy out of
films by supplying them with
substandard scripts and denying
them creative control
In trying to please ever>
body, the documentary is so

pathetically diffuse that it re
sembles scrambled eggs before
they solidify. '

this sequence is seen in That's Entertainment, Part 11, with Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly introducing it.
Why do I have a queasy feeling
about panning That's Enter
tainment, Part II? Because it's a
sin to pan movies that everyone
loves. But, as I said
last year at this very same time
with Jaws, objectivity is the
name of the game.
Fred Astaire at 77 and Gene
Kelly at 63 introduce the edited
film clips from all the great and
not-so-great Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer films that weren't clipped
for That's Entertainment. As
taire looks great for 77; Kelly
looks like he fell into a vat of
pancake makeup.
They sing new lyrics to the
tune of Howard Dietz' and Ar
thur Schwartz' "That's Enter
tainment." a song from 1953's
The Band Wagon. They even
dance new steps choreographed
by Kelly, on a set of futuristic
geometric designs that clash
pathetically with the antiquity of
the films.
The original was written, pro
duced and directed by Jack
Haley, Jr., the son of the Tin
Woodman of Oz. The sequel was
written by Leonard Gershe, pro
duced by Saul Chaplin and
Daniel Melnick, two MGM
executives, and directed by
Kelly. Perhaps here's where ev
erything went wrong. The
sequel doesn't have the focus
that the original had, because the
aforementioned quartet tried to
encompass too much.
Instead of concentrating on
musicals, whoever was making
the decisions haphazardly
dashed through the vaults pick
ing up whatever was considered
great, or at least appropriate.
Appropriate does not necessar

ily mean good, because we're
treated to ridicule of Traveltalks
newsreels, the role of the
songwriter in films and the
Jeanette McDonald-Nelson Eddy
operattas, which once again
prove that the couple was the
funniest pair to hit Hollywood
since Burns and Allen.
The result of these conglomer
ations includes the Rhett Butler
departure scene from Gone With
The Wind, Lassie's return in Las
sie Come Home, Tarzan's intro
duction to Jane, among others.
Comedy scenes have also been
injected to round things out, but
they tend to make the film more
bloated than comprehensive.
Apparently the producers
couldn't decide whether to have
comedy or not, because what few
scenes there are — like the
stateroom scene from the Marx
Brothers' A Night At The Opera
— are obviously edited for
length, but not necessarily for
clarity, as are some of the musi
cal numbers.
Either give us comedy in its
entirety, or musical numbers in
their entirety, or great scenes
from great movies in their en
tirety, but don't give us snippets
of trivia that we don't even have
time to savor.
We even have short flashes of
Buster Keaton and Laurel and
Hardy, which is the very height
of MGM chutzpah, since it was
that studio which turned Keaton
into an alcoholic and helped
drive Laurel and Hardy out of
films by supplying them with
substandard scripts and denying
them creative control
In trying to please ever>
body, the documentary is so

pathetically diffuse that it re
sembles scrambled eggs before
they solidify. '
