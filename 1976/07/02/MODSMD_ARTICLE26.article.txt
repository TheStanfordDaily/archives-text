# A 						disappointing performance at Keystone Berkeley
## Hancock no longer the king of jazz piano 
### Rick Brand 
To those who may have won
dered whether Herbie Hancock
will ever return to his old re
markable ways as a premier jazz
pianist, the answer is an unques
tionable no. Hancock settled that
question quickly last ITursday
night at the Keystone club in
Berkeley.
"Lots of you may have heard
me many times before." grinned
Hancock, "but tonight we're
going to play some new stuff."
Hancock set out to do just that.
The opening number, "Hang
Ip Your Hang ups." quickly put
the crowd in high gear with a
tight, hard-driving mixture ot
funk and blues. Certainly most
prominent here was Benny Mof
fett. who alternated between the
Ivricon. which resembled an
electric clarinet, and the alto
saxophone. As Haricot k himself

said, vou can't have all rhythm
and no melody, and Moffett pro
vided an excellent lead to the
song. Hancock tried to show a
little dexterity during the tune,
playing the electric piano and
synthesizer simultaneously. The
combination did little for the
song and little for the crowd. But
the fine backups and Moffett's
efforts provided plenty of relief,
and the band had captured the
crowd.
Mood mellows
The tempo abruptly changed
at this point as the group moved
into their next number. "Gentle
Thoughts." The name aptly de
scribes this mellow, bluesy song
which featured Hancock on the
organ and Moffett on the sop
rano sax. The song flowed easily
for the first few minutes with
Herbie leading the way with
some fine, gentle keyboard
work. Moffett then took over
with an excellent sax solo, the
crowd rewarding him with a
nice round of applause. The only
low point of the song came next,
however, as an uneasy change of
pace removed the dreamy state
that the song had produced.
Hancock did bring the tune to
[ gether nicely at the end. and the
crowd responded heartily.
The next few numbers ot the
set. which Hani ock chose to re
main unnamed, allowed the
[ other members ot the group to
show some of their stuff Ken
Nash provided some superb per
cussion. playing .ill sorts of
bells, wind machines and other
indescribable instruments. Han
cock remained rather subdued
during this song, and it was easy
j to see why, as his backups were
tight and very enjoyable.
The group then drifted into
L_

another bluesy tune, sort of rol
ling along without strain. Waa
Waa Watson on lead guitar i ame
up with some spacey riffs that
added an interesting twist to the
number.
The Ol' Herbie
To this point the set had been
enjoyable, but Hancock had not
been overly impressive, and the
high points had come from the
other members of the band. But
Hancock now turned to the elec
tric piano, and really put on a
performance. The song was as
close to the old type of jazz Han
cock became famous for. blend
ing quick-paced fingerwork
with melodic, beautiful parts.
The song disspelled any doubts
as to whether Hancock had lost
his touch, but at the same time

only served to whet the appetite
of those who had hoped to hear
some of Hancock's old songs.
I lerbie 1 lancock has in the past
been one of the premier jazz
pianists around, for both his
keyboard agility, style and in
novative music. The route he has
chosen to take of late, that of
mixture of blues, funk and jazz,
has not matched Hancock's ear
lier efforts. It seems that his new
style relegates him to a member
of a good, but not necessarily ex
cellent, group that is entertain
ing but just not of the same
caliber as before. Why the
change in style is anybody's
guess — perhaps Hancock has
yet to decide exactly where he
wants to go musically, or
perhaps he simply wants to pro

duce a more marketable product
that can reach to a greater
number of people. In any event,
Hancock's show at the Keystone
was satisfying, but somehow it
fell a little short. Perhaps this is
just another example ot the futile
search for "the good old days."
Party hints
The Keystone Club can best be
described as a miniature Winter
land. down to the revolving mir
ror ball suspended from the ceil
ing. Beer is available at the bar
but for rather steep prices: smoke
is cool but discretion is advised.
No minors are allowed and I.D.
checks are fairly stiff; it is also
suggested to the concert-goers to
chose a cool night to visit the
Keystone — it must have been a
hundred in there!
