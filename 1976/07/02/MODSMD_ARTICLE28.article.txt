# Lamplighters triumph again
## A
						dazzling 'lolanthe' 
### William Kaplan 
The House of Lords again
submitted to the power of "an
influential Fairy" on Saturday
night when the Lamplighters
presented their first perfor
mance this year of lolanthe at
the Presentation Theatre. With
the flimsiest of the most prepos
terous plots of William S. Gilbert
to guide the magnificent music
of Arthur Sullivan, the resident
Savoyard company again gave a
delightful and thoroughly pro
fessional performance.
The staging, costumes, music
and sets were beautifully done in
a classical style of the era (1882)
of its premiere performance. The
plot (td use the word loosely)
concerns a flock (troop, tribe,
gang or ?) of fairies all looking
like White Rock soda ads and
their Queen, portrayed largely
by the gifted June Wilkins, and
their influence with the Peerage.
Without divulging any of the
devious twists of the ridiculous
plot, all turns out well in the end.
and one can exit whistling many
tuneful airs from one of the
greatest of the Gilbert and Sulli
van productions.
It would not be in the tradition
of theatrical criticism if there
should not have been found
something to sneer at on this
most wonderful evening in the
musical theatre. Therefore, your
humble scrivener wishes to re
port that the orange juice served
at intermission was not properly
chilled.
