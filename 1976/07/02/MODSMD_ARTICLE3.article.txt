In response to Priscilla
Keigen's question (Daily. June
l! ( »),is to who pit id for moving the
"world's ugliest palm trees."
these trees were a gift from the
Stanford Shopping Center. The
package consisted of nine
VViishingtoniu robusfn and a
single Triichycorpus fortunei.
All are excellent specimens, al
though their appearance may be
suffering temporarily from the
shock of the move.
Instant reactions to what's
prettv and what isn't always
reminds me ot essayist David
Hume's observation, made in
1 '14 1. that "beauty in things
exists in the mind that con
templates them."

I wish to thank the editors tor
taking the time to review my
book. Communication Revolu
tion (Daily, lune 2). There were
two errors in the review which I
would I ike to correct.
Credit was given to the wrong
publisher. I am the publisher as
wel I as author. Hooks may he ob
tained by writing to me at P.O.
Ho\ 11 (ii. Mountain View. Calif.
«>4H4li. or at the Stanford
Bookstore. Publishers Press is
NOT the publisher.
Ceorge Powell claims that my

hook rendered his mind "in
operative." It is very improbable
that his problem came from my
book. The book is about topics
which the large majority of
people in our culture have been
pressured into losing the ability
to think about from opposing
points of view.
It is very probable that Ceorge
Powell has problems with many
of the topics discussed in my
book, and that his problems
came from his parents, or his
professors, or his associates.
Such problems are perpetuated
because very few people have
the courage to challenge the
popular prejudices, myths and
superstitions of their peers. (Ex
perimental evidence to support
this thesis is given in the book.)
It is a pity that Ceorge Powell
did not read my book with more
care. If he had. 1 believe he
would be much better prepared
to deal with his problem.

As the University administra

working for excellence in teach

tht; protection of academic free
dom. civil liberties, the right to
due process, and faculty benefits
in institutions of higher educa-

The Stanford Chapter has al
ways felt that these goals are best
accomplished by maintaining a
cnllegi.il relationship with the
I'niversitv's administrative of

disappointing to us that in no
way was our input requested for
either the formulation or the
evaluation of the Stanford Integ

We would appreciate the Uni

In response to Priscilla
Keigen's question (Daily. June
l! ( »),is to who pit id for moving the
"world's ugliest palm trees."
these trees were a gift from the
Stanford Shopping Center. The
package consisted of nine
VViishingtoniu robusfn and a
single Triichycorpus fortunei.
All are excellent specimens, al
though their appearance may be
suffering temporarily from the
shock of the move.
Instant reactions to what's
prettv and what isn't always
reminds me ot essayist David
Hume's observation, made in
1 '14 1. that "beauty in things
exists in the mind that con
templates them."

I wish to thank the editors tor
taking the time to review my
book. Communication Revolu
tion (Daily, lune 2). There were
two errors in the review which I
would I ike to correct.
Credit was given to the wrong
publisher. I am the publisher as
wel I as author. Hooks may he ob
tained by writing to me at P.O.
Ho\ 11 (ii. Mountain View. Calif.
«>4H4li. or at the Stanford
Bookstore. Publishers Press is
NOT the publisher.
Ceorge Powell claims that my

hook rendered his mind "in
operative." It is very improbable
that his problem came from my
book. The book is about topics
which the large majority of
people in our culture have been
pressured into losing the ability
to think about from opposing
points of view.
It is very probable that Ceorge
Powell has problems with many
of the topics discussed in my
book, and that his problems
came from his parents, or his
professors, or his associates.
Such problems are perpetuated
because very few people have
the courage to challenge the
popular prejudices, myths and
superstitions of their peers. (Ex
perimental evidence to support
this thesis is given in the book.)
It is a pity that Ceorge Powell
did not read my book with more
care. If he had. 1 believe he
would be much better prepared
to deal with his problem.

As the University administra
tion knows, the American As
sociation of University Profes
sors is the only such association
working for excellence in teach
ing and scholarship as well as
tht; protection of academic free
dom. civil liberties, the right to
due process, and faculty benefits
in institutions of higher educa-

tion.
The Stanford Chapter has al
ways felt that these goals are best
accomplished by maintaining a
cnllegi.il relationship with the
I'niversitv's administrative of
ficers and staff. It was therefore
disappointing to us that in no
way was our input requested for
either the formulation or the
evaluation of the Stanford Integ
rated Plan for retirement be
nefits.
We would appreciate the Uni
versity's support and coopera
tion in obtaining detailed infor
mation on the alternative prog
rams. so that both our local and
national committee on the
"Economic Status of the Profes
sion" may make a meaningful
analysis of the proposal.
