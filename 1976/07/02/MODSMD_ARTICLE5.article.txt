## Ehrlich's charges

John McCarthy

I just noticed that Professor
Paul Ehrlich. replying to the
Stanford News Service request
for reactions to the defeat of
Proposition 15, said, "The defeat
of Proposition 15 shows what
well-financed liars can do, but
I'm afraid that the utilities, oil
companies, reactor manufactur
ers, and their accomplices have
wasted their money and time.
They are not going to be able to
expand nuclear power in a state
where one-third of the voters al
ready realize that atomic power
plants are a threat to both their
lives and their liberty."
As one organizer of the Stan
ford area campaign against
Proposition 15 and one of about
90 Stanford science faculty sig
ners of a statement against it, 1
would like to know if Prof.
Ehrlich wishes to characterize
90 colleagues (including Holt
Ashley, Felix Bloch. Thomas
Connolly. Robert Hofstadter and
myself who solicted the sig
natures) as well-financed liars or
as accomplices of the utilities,
oil companies, and reactor man
ufacturers. Are Senator Tunney,
Congressman McCloskey, the
Palo Alto Times and the San
Franciso Chonicle also merely
liars?
We feel wronged by his
charges, because our Stanford
campaign againstPropositionls
was financed by the Stanford fa
culty named above, and all but
our one nuclear engineer are un
connected with the nuclear in
dustry. We in SENSE. Scientists

for Enlightenment on Nuclear
Sources of Energy, believe the
country needs nuclear energy
and that scientists must defend it
against what we consider irra
tional ideological attack.
We scientist opponents of
Proposition 1 5 were offended by
full page ads in the last days of
the campaign ignoring scientific
opposition, slighting the issue
itself, and suggesting that the
only opponents of 15 were com
panies. Perhaps voters sus
pected that the last minute attack
on the opponents' motives
meant that the proponents of 15
had run out of arguments — con
tributing to the swing against 15
just before the election.
Nevertheless, the statewide
campaign against 15 involved
industry money and personal ef
forts by industry people in pub
licizing statements against 15 by
scientists and others. Industries
have a right to defend them
selves from what they regard as
wrongful attack, but for two
reasons, we need issue-oriented
citizens' organizations support
ing the application of new useful
technology. First, if we depend
on industry to defend technol
ogy in the political arena, many
will be affected by charges like
Ehrlich's, and second, a new
technology may have no estab
lished industrial interest to de
fend it.
Will Professor Ehrlich recog
nize our sincere motives and
genuine convictions?

where one-third of the voters al
ready realize that atomic power
plants are a threat to both their
lives and their liberty."
As one organizer of the Stan
ford area campaign against
Proposition 15 and one of about
90 Stanford science faculty sig
ners of a statement against it, 1
would like to know if Prof.
Ehrlich wishes to characterize
90 colleagues (including Holt
Ashley, Felix Bloch. Thomas
Connolly. Robert Hofstadter and
myself who solicted the sig
natures) as well-financed liars or
as accomplices of the utilities,
oil companies, and reactor man
ufacturers. Are Senator Tunney,
Congressman McCloskey, the
Palo Alto Times and the San
Franciso Chonicle also merely
liars?
We feel wronged by his
charges, because our Stanford
campaign againstPropositionls
was financed by the Stanford fa
culty named above, and all but
our one nuclear engineer are un
connected with the nuclear in
dustry. We in SENSE. Scientists

for Enlightenment on Nuclear
Sources of Energy, believe the
country needs nuclear energy
and that scientists must defend it
against what we consider irra
tional ideological attack.
We scientist opponents of
Proposition 1 5 were offended by
full page ads in the last days of
the campaign ignoring scientific
opposition, slighting the issue
itself, and suggesting that the
only opponents of 15 were com
panies. Perhaps voters sus
pected that the last minute attack
on the opponents' motives
meant that the proponents of 15
had run out of arguments — con
tributing to the swing against 15
just before the election.
Nevertheless, the statewide
campaign against 15 involved
industry money and personal ef
forts by industry people in pub
licizing statements against 15 by
scientists and others. Industries
have a right to defend them
selves from what they regard as
wrongful attack, but for two
reasons, we need issue-oriented
citizens' organizations support
ing the application of new useful
technology. First, if we depend
on industry to defend technol
ogy in the political arena, many
will be affected by charges like
Ehrlich's, and second, a new
technology may have no estab
lished industrial interest to de
fend it.
Will Professor Ehrlich recog
nize our sincere motives and
genuine convictions?

I just noticed that Professor
Paul Ehrlich. replying to the
Stanford News Service request
for reactions to the defeat of
Proposition 15, said, "The defeat
of Proposition 15 shows what
well-financed liars can do, but
I'm afraid that the utilities, oil
companies, reactor manufactur
ers, and their accomplices have
wasted their money and time.
They are not going to be able to
expand nuclear power in a state
where one-third of the voters al
ready realize that atomic power
plants are a threat to both their
lives and their liberty."
