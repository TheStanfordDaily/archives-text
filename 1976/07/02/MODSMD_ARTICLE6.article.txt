## Two second thoughts 
### 
I have received both public
and private rebuke for my criti
cal article concerned with some
of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's
ideas. These have emphasized
the lack of good sense in my. a
mere junior professor and fellow
at Hoover, attacking a great man
such as Mr. Solzhenitsvn. Some
have even promised severe con
sequences from this in my pro
fessional career.
Never mind that 1 attacked Mr.
Solzhenitsvn only insofar as
being critical of some of his ideas
is justly construed as an attack of
him. The very idea of criticizing
the views of a prominent, re
spected person seems to have
upset some people to no end. in
deed so much that they have for
gotten all of the ideals and val
ues of scholarly life.
All of this is sad and reveals a
basic misunderstanding of why
Mr. Solzhenitsvn is widely re
spected. Was it not he who stood
up against established authority

and spoke, wrote, and de
monstrated so as to give truth a
chance? Was it not he who ut
tered unpopular opinions in the
face of possible violent official
responses?
To stand in defense of Mr. Sol
zhenitsyn in the fashion some
people have exhibited is to do
him far greater insult than to take
his views seriously and discuss
them critically in print.

In the June 25 Daily article by
Bill Sposato quotes me as saying:
"krahl said that the (physiology)
courses are now taught with too
heavy a clinical slant.' "This is
an incorrect statement of my
views.
Actually. I believe that the
three Clinical Physiology
courses are taught extremely
well, with an excellent balance

between basic physiology and
pathological physiology. For the
past two years these courses
have been under the supervision
of Dr. Eugene Robin. Professor of
Medicine and Physiology. He
and his colleagues are to be con
gratulated for carrying on this
experiment in medical educa
tion with distinction.
