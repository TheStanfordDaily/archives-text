# Suspension advocated for six varsity athletes
## 
### Ron Beck Copyright 1976, The Stanford Daily 
The Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC) has forwarded a recom
mendation to President Richard
Lyman that calls for at least
one-quarter-long academic sus
pensions of six varsity athletes.
The recommendation was not
a unanimous decision by the
SJC. and more than two dissent
ing arguments have been in
cluded with the overall recom
mendation.
The charges against the
athletes stem from a bachelor
party at the Delta Tau Delta
(Delt) fraternity that resulted in
campus disruptions. The six
students are all members of the
fraternity and were participants
in the disruptions.
The six athletes are:
—Gary Anderson, a senior and
a second-string guard on last
season's football team;
—Todd Anderson, a senior
who started at center and was a
17th-round draft pick of the New
England Patriots professional
football team;
—Mark Hill, a junior and the
second-string center behind
Todd Anderson last season;
—George Schader, a senior
and a starting forward on the
varsity basketball team;

—Rich Waters, a senior and a
second-team All-Coast selection
at safety; and
—Mike Wilkinson, a senior
and a second-string nose guard.
Players' lawyer
The lawyer representing the
six players in the university pro
ceedings, Joe Mell, said that the
next step in the legal process
will be for the players to have
individual appeals in front of
Lyman.
After hearing the appeals,
Lyman will make a binding de
cision.
Lyman, however, is out of
town until July 16.
Prof. Jonathan Casper, faculty
co-chairman of the SJC, said that
Lyman "will generally go along
with the basic recommenda
tions (of the SJC)."
James Siena, legal adviser to
the president, said that a deci
sion that reversed the recom
mendation of the SJC,would be

"unusual, but not unexcep
tional."
One of the six athletes said.
"We're probably going to get to
play i football). but there should
be some suspensions after fall
quarter (at the end of the sea
son)."
Mell said that the player's
opinion was "purely specula
tive."
"That certainly isn't what our
appeal is based on." he added.
The recommendations are a
result of the May 19 incident
when 15 Delts and 12 friends
trashed four other fraternity
houses after a Delt's bachelor
party.
Original charges
12 students were originally
charged with violating the Uni
versity's Fundamental Standard,
but charges against six of the
students were dropped.

THE CLEANING SERVICE HERE IS LOUSY—Beta Theta Pi resi
dents survey the damage caused by members of the Delta Tau Delta
fraternity Thursday ni»ht. May 20. which ultimately caused the
suspension of the fraternity from campus for three years.
The Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC) has forwarded a recom
mendation to President Richard
Lyman that calls for at least
one-quarter-long academic sus
pensions of six varsity athletes.
The recommendation was not
a unanimous decision by the
SJC. and more than two dissent
ing arguments have been in
cluded with the overall recom
mendation.
The charges against the
athletes stem from a bachelor
party at the Delta Tau Delta
(Delt) fraternity that resulted in
campus disruptions. The six
students are all members of the
fraternity and were participants
in the disruptions.
The six athletes are:
—Gary Anderson, a senior and
a second-string guard on last
season's football team;
—Todd Anderson, a senior
who started at center and was a
17th-round draft pick of the New
England Patriots professional
football team;
—Mark Hill, a junior and the
second-string center behind
Todd Anderson last season;
—George Schader, a senior
and a starting forward on the
varsity basketball team;

—Rich Waters, a senior and a
second-team All-Coast selection
at safety; and
—Mike Wilkinson, a senior
and a second-string nose guard.
Players' lawyer
The lawyer representing the
six players in the university pro
ceedings, Joe Mell, said that the
next step in the legal process
will be for the players to have
individual appeals in front of
Lyman.
After hearing the appeals,
Lyman will make a binding de
cision.
Lyman, however, is out of
town until July 16.
Prof. Jonathan Casper, faculty
co-chairman of the SJC, said that
Lyman "will generally go along
with the basic recommenda
tions (of the SJC)."
James Siena, legal adviser to
the president, said that a deci
sion that reversed the recom
mendation of the SJC,would be

"unusual, but not unexcep
tional."
One of the six athletes said.
"We're probably going to get to
play i football). but there should
be some suspensions after fall
quarter (at the end of the sea
son)."
Mell said that the player's
opinion was "purely specula
tive."
"That certainly isn't what our
appeal is based on." he added.
The recommendations are a
result of the May 19 incident
when 15 Delts and 12 friends
trashed four other fraternity
houses after a Delt's bachelor
party.
Original charges
12 students were originally
charged with violating the Uni
versity's Fundamental Standard,
but charges against six of the
students were dropped.
