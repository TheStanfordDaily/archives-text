# Task force to study merger
## 
### 
A 15-member task force will study the controversial proposal to
merge retirement plans for the University's faculty and professional,
or "exempt," staff, according to Acting Provost William Massy and
Vice President Robert Augsburger.
The task force will study different ways to limit the University's
expenses for exempt employe retirement plans. The University's
draft proposal would integrate Social Security payments with con
tributions to the Teacher's Insurance and Annuity Association
(TLAA) and College Retirement Equities Fund (CREF).
That proposal has drawn sharp criticism from professional staff,
especially at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC).
Another option the task force will examine is University with
drawal from the Social Security system, according to its charge.
"Our central purpose in setting up this special task force is to
ensure that all reasonable concerns expressed by members of the
faculty and exempt staff are properly considered and alternative
proposals for integration are analyzed prior to our arriving at a final
plan of action in the fall," Massy and Augsburger said.
The task force should have a report by Oct. 15. According to David
Carvin of the Controller's Office, the bulk of the work will be ac
complished during the summer, but comments from returning fa
culty members will be heard early in October. Carvin is the task
force's staff assistant.
A final plan should be ready by November for implementation Jan.
1, 1977, Garvin said.
The group will hold its first meeting 10 a.m. Friday in the Presi
dent's Office Conference Room. Electrical Engineering Prof. Fre
derick Crawford will preside.
