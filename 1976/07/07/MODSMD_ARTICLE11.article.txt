Could you please tell us what is that hor
rible screeching noise which erupts from
the education building at sporadic inter
vals? What is its source and can it he
fixed? Residents of Donner and Larkin
must live with this menace day and
night. -K.G. and B.S.
As a graduate of the Stanford Teacher
Education Program, which holds classes
in that selfsame building, I might
hypothesize that the noise you hear is the
combined screams of desperate educa
tion students as they're asked for the
hundredth time to "divide into groups
and do some role playing."
Unfortunately, this hypothesis is my
best guess.
Director of Plant Services Jason Mavis
said that he doesn't know to what noise
you are referring and has had no previ
ous complaints. We suggest that you

contact him directly the next time you
hear it.

NOTE: Those who were intrigued by the
explanation of the United States Seal, in
particular the "eye of the pyramind,"
("Bug Me." July 2) should read the II-

luminatus trilogy bv Robert Shea and
Robert Anton Wilson. The first volume,
entitled The Eye in the Pyramid,
suggests that the U.S. Seal was really the
emblem of an evil group who called
themselves the "Illuminati." The design
for the seal, the authors say, was not in

vented by the mundane Charles Harton
hut was given to Thomas Jefferson late at
night by a mysterious stranger in a black
cloak. It certainly makes a more exciting
storv.
