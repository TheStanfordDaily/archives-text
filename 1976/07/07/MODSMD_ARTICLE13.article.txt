# Silence is hilarious in Brooks' new film
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
I was taught never to
generalize. However. Silent
Movie is the funniest movie that
Mel Brooks has ever made. And
it may very well be one of the
funniest movies ever made.
Don't take these as the ramblings
of a Brooks fanatic, either.
I am a sane, upright person
who hated Voung Frankenstein
and was only moderately
amused by Blazing Saddles.
However. I was almost on the
floor watching Silent Movie.
George Burns said recently,
"(If you) stay in the business
long enough and get to be old
enough, you get to be new
again." He might just as well

have been talking about the jukes
in Silent Movie as himself.
Brooks must have taken that
statement as incontrovertible
gospel because the jokes are
straight out of vaudeville.
There's even a cameo of Henny
Youngman doing his famous
"Waiter, there's a fly in my
soup" routine.
Since the jokes are so old it's
appropriate that the movie is si
lent, too. even though it's set in
1976.Silent Movie has titlecards
and an accompanying score pro
viding musical sound effects. It's
like a trip back to the silent era,
especially with the cliched situ
ations. But it works.
