# Silence is hilarious in Brooks' new film
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
I was taught never to
generalize. However. Silent
Movie is the funniest movie that
Mel Brooks has ever made. And
it may very well be one of the
funniest movies ever made.
Don't take these as the ramblings
of a Brooks fanatic, either.
I am a sane, upright person
who hated Voung Frankenstein
and was only moderately
amused by Blazing Saddles.
However. I was almost on the
floor watching Silent Movie.
George Burns said recently,
"(If you) stay in the business
long enough and get to be old
enough, you get to be new
again." He might just as well

have been talking about the jukes
in Silent Movie as himself.
Brooks must have taken that
statement as incontrovertible
gospel because the jokes are
straight out of vaudeville.
There's even a cameo of Henny
Youngman doing his famous
"Waiter, there's a fly in my
soup" routine.
Since the jokes are so old it's
appropriate that the movie is si
lent, too. even though it's set in
1976.Silent Movie has titlecards
and an accompanying score pro
viding musical sound effects. It's
like a trip back to the silent era,
especially with the cliched situ
ations. But it works.

Brooks and cohorts suffer through anxious moments
That Brooks could string to
gether so many cliches and pull
off so many laughs is ingenious.
Silence, if I remember my mo
tion picture history, is not
exactly a new idea. But in this
era of Concordes, it certainly is
unique.
The same jokes in the hands of
a lesser talent would come off as
forced and stupid (as in The Big
Bus). The humor is visually
communicated at a breathtaking
pace. Often the humor is only
tacked on to the travels of the
characters down Hollywood
Boulevard, but Brooks has so
conditioned us to expect any
thing in his movies (like when
Harvey Korman goes into
Grauman's Chinese theater to
see the end of Blazing Saddles)
that even when the joke is ir
relevant it succeeds.
Somewhere among all this hi
larity is the plot, as fluffy as it is.

Washed-up in alcohol, director
Mel Funn (Brooks) with his
cohorts Dom Hell (Dom DeLuise)
and Marty Eggs (Marty Feldman)
wants to save both himself and
Big Picture Studios by making a
silent movie with five
superstars. And he doesn't
skimp on his superstars.
In jepisodes funning their
screen images, the five
superstars help make the movie
the fun it is, Not to denigrate
Brooks' talent, but seeing Hol
lywood superstars poke fun at
their own images is great — it
proves they have a sense of
humor and are not snobs.
Burt Reynolds can not walk
past a mirror without giving
himself a dazzling smile; Paul
Newman srtes to ekide funn on a
motorized wheel chair, in-a spoof
of his racing movies: James Cann
plays an uncoordinated athlete
with as much finesse as a tipsy
rhino.

In a nightclub scene, Funn
woos a glamorous Anne Ban
croft. Brooks' wife in real life. It
is a pleasure to see them working
together after being married for
so long and performing in totally
different kinds of movies (on
second thought. The Hinden
burg was pretty funny).
Only Liza Minnelli's scene
does not rely on her participa
tion, just her presence, and as a
result is not as funny as the rest.
The plot continues with the
conglomerate Engulf and De
vour (personified by corporate
conformity on its board of direc
tors and "Poverty sucksl"graffiti
in the bathroom) trying to -engulf
and devour Big Picture-Studios.

stroy his self-confidence. In true
silent-movie fashion, the plot
fails and all's well that ends
well. The only sound youli hear
is laughter.
Funn is the driving force be
hind the three, while Eggs and
Bell seem to exist only to provide
humor at appropriate moments.
At.times they resemble the Marx
Brothers in isolated routines,
like irrepressible pixies fasci
nated by a complicated world
but always capable of wreaking
havoc whenever the mood
strikes them.
The extra attraction of Silent
Movie is that it is able to attack
the complexities of 1976 with
the simplicities of the silent era,
almost like conquering an SAC
bomber with a catapault.
In one scene when the studio
chief is hospitalized. Funn, Eggs
and Bell enter to wreak havoc
with the contraptions of the
machine age that threaten to
confuse them.
They conveniently transform
an electro-cardiograph recorder
into a Pong machine, providing
one of the most hilarious and
imaginative scenes of the movie.
It is indicative of Silent Movie
that it deliversthe most imagina
tive gags with the most ordinarv

and customary items.
Brooks with Silent Movie
more than ever insures himself a
place on the list of the world's
funniest men. While his humor
may not always reach the intelli
gence that Woody Allen's does,
it will always succeed in making
your side ache.
After a few days, one may
wonder how Brooks can succeed
so perfectly with such old jokes.
He can because he can twist and
exaggerate them (the fly in

Youngman's soup is not exactly
tiny) and make them new all
over again.
Unfortunately, since Brooks'
comedy does not stand up to
analysis very well, forget it
Since I'm the critic and you're
not. don't worry about analyzing
Silent Movie, just go see it.
You'll love it.

Washed-up in alcohol, director
Mel Funn (Brooks) with his

and Marty Eggs (Marty Feldman)
wants to save both himself and
Big Picture Studios by making a
silent movie with five
superstars. And he doesn't
skimp on his superstars.
In jepisodes funning their
screen images, the five
superstars help make the movie
the fun it is, Not to denigrate
Brooks' talent, but seeing Hol

their own images is great — it
proves they have a sense of
humor and are not snobs.
Burt Reynolds can not walk
past a mirror without giving
himself a dazzling smile; Paul
Newman srtes to ekide funn on a
motorized wheel chair, in-a spoof
of his racing movies: James Cann
plays an uncoordinated athlete
with as much finesse as a tipsy
rhino.

In a nightclub scene, Funn
woos a glamorous Anne Ban
croft. Brooks' wife in real life. It
is a pleasure to see them working
together after being married for
so long and performing in totally
different kinds of movies (on
second thought. The Hinden

Only Liza Minnelli's scene
does not rely on her participa

result is not as funny as the rest.
The plot continues with the

more than ever insures himself a

it will always succeed in making

After a few days, one may
wonder how Brooks can succeed
so perfectly with such old jokes.
He can because he can twist and
exaggerate them (the fly in

George Burns said recently,

funniest men. While his humor
may not always reach the intelli
gence that Woody Allen's does,
it will always succeed in making
your side ache.
After a few days, one may
wonder how Brooks can succeed
so perfectly with such old jokes.
He can because he can twist and
exaggerate them (the fly in

Youngman's soup is not exactly
tiny) and make them new all
over again.
Unfortunately, since Brooks'
comedy does not stand up to
analysis very well, forget it

I was taught never to
generalize. However. Silent
Movie is the funniest movie that
Mel Brooks has ever made. And
it may very well be one of the
funniest movies ever made.
Don't take these as the ramblings
of a Brooks fanatic, either.
I am a sane, upright person
who hated Voung Frankenstein
and was only moderately
amused by Blazing Saddles.
However. I was almost on the
floor watching Silent Movie.
George Burns said recently,
"(If you) stay in the business
long enough and get to be old
enough, you get to be new
again." He might just as well

have been talking about the jukes
in Silent Movie as himself.
Brooks must have taken that
statement as incontrovertible
gospel because the jokes are
straight out of vaudeville.
There's even a cameo of Henny
Youngman doing his famous
"Waiter, there's a fly in my
soup" routine.
Since the jokes are so old it's
appropriate that the movie is si
lent, too. even though it's set in
1976.Silent Movie has titlecards
and an accompanying score pro
viding musical sound effects. It's
like a trip back to the silent era,
especially with the cliched situ
ations. But it works.

Brooks and cohorts suffer through anxious moments
That Brooks could string to
gether so many cliches and pull
off so many laughs is ingenious.
Silence, if I remember my mo
tion picture history, is not
exactly a new idea. But in this
era of Concordes, it certainly is
unique.
The same jokes in the hands of
a lesser talent would come off as
forced and stupid (as in The Big
Bus). The humor is visually
communicated at a breathtaking
pace. Often the humor is only
tacked on to the travels of the
characters down Hollywood
Boulevard, but Brooks has so
conditioned us to expect any
thing in his movies (like when
Harvey Korman goes into
Grauman's Chinese theater to
see the end of Blazing Saddles)
that even when the joke is ir
relevant it succeeds.
Somewhere among all this hi
larity is the plot, as fluffy as it is.

Washed-up in alcohol, director
Mel Funn (Brooks) with his
cohorts Dom Hell (Dom DeLuise)
and Marty Eggs (Marty Feldman)
wants to save both himself and
Big Picture Studios by making a
silent movie with five
superstars. And he doesn't
skimp on his superstars.
In jepisodes funning their
screen images, the five
superstars help make the movie
the fun it is, Not to denigrate
Brooks' talent, but seeing Hol
lywood superstars poke fun at
their own images is great — it
proves they have a sense of
humor and are not snobs.
Burt Reynolds can not walk
past a mirror without giving
himself a dazzling smile; Paul
Newman srtes to ekide funn on a
motorized wheel chair, in-a spoof
of his racing movies: James Cann
plays an uncoordinated athlete
with as much finesse as a tipsy
rhino.

In a nightclub scene, Funn
woos a glamorous Anne Ban
croft. Brooks' wife in real life. It
is a pleasure to see them working
together after being married for
so long and performing in totally
different kinds of movies (on
second thought. The Hinden
burg was pretty funny).
Only Liza Minnelli's scene
does not rely on her participa
tion, just her presence, and as a
result is not as funny as the rest.
