meeting of the United Nations Security
Council to deal with what they called
Israel's "act of agression" against
Uganda.

market.
Among the imports, June was the best
sales month in history for Toyota, which
is now the best-selling imported car.

Court's rule on parked cars
WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court
ruled by a six-to-three margin yesterday
that police do not need warrants to
search for contraband in vehicles that
have been impounded for parking viola
tions.
The Court also barred federal courts

the Internal Revenue Service can use
evidence seized by localpolice torecover
back taxes for illegal gambling profits.
