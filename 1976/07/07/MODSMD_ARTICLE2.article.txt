### Pan Demetrakakes 
The Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC) will recommend that two
members of the band be put on
probation as punishment for the
band's performance in Meyer
Library on May 24.
Although the SJC has not yet
issued a formal, written recom
mendation, drum major Jim Jett
and manager Kent Blumberg
said that they were informed of
the decision two weeks ago.
The SJC will issue the formal
recommendation in about a
week, according to Political Sci
ence Prof. Jonathan Casper,
faculty co-chairman.
President Richard Lyman
must still approve the recom
mendation. However. Casper
said. "The president usually fol
lows the SJC's recommenda
tions."

Casper added that the vote to
recommend probation was
unanimous. However, he de
clined to discuss other aspects of
the case.
Jett and Blumberg both said
that the University's reaction to
the May 27 performance came as
a surprise.
"(Meyer Library) is a place we
like to play in because we get an
enthusiastic response. We didn't
expect any trouble." Jett said.
"We didn't go there to disrupt
the library." he added. "None of
us were warned by any of the
library staff."
The library staff lodged the
complaint that led to the Univer
sity's action, according to
Casper.
Jett said that the band had
played in Meyer before without
repercussions. However, Legal

Advisor to the President James
Siena, who served as prosecutor
in the case, said that the decision
to prosecute was touched off by
the library's new hard line on
disruptions.
"By the end of last winter
quarter it became apparent that
the library was virtually unusa
ble because it was being used as
a stage or platform," Siena said.
"The band knew about (the
new policy), and they went

library's new policy made it "a
case of first impression" (with
out precedent), he said.
Jett and Blumberg both said
they felt that the decision to
single them out for punishment
was correct.
"Many of the bandspeople
think it's unfair that just Kent
and myself were charged." Jett
said. "But I'm not upset because
it makes it easier for the band."
Blumberg said that although
the prosecution came as a sur
prise, "we understand why they
did it now."
Jett. however, was slightly less
accomodating. "I can under
stand their position on disrup
tions in (Meyer), but we're not
1 ike a frat or somet hi ng — we're a
recognized student body." he
said.
The Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC) will recommend that two
members of the band be put on
probation as punishment for the
band's performance in Meyer
Library on May 24.
Although the SJC has not yet
issued a formal, written recom
mendation, drum major Jim Jett
and manager Kent Blumberg
said that they were informed of
the decision two weeks ago.
The SJC will issue the formal
recommendation in about a
week, according to Political Sci
ence Prof. Jonathan Casper,
faculty co-chairman.
President Richard Lyman
must still approve the recom
mendation. However. Casper
said. "The president usually fol
lows the SJC's recommenda
tions."

Casper added that the vote to
recommend probation was
unanimous. However, he de
clined to discuss other aspects of
the case.
Jett and Blumberg both said
that the University's reaction to
the May 27 performance came as
a surprise.
"(Meyer Library) is a place we
like to play in because we get an
enthusiastic response. We didn't
expect any trouble." Jett said.
"We didn't go there to disrupt
the library." he added. "None of
us were warned by any of the
library staff."
The library staff lodged the
complaint that led to the Univer
sity's action, according to
Casper.
Jett said that the band had
played in Meyer before without
repercussions. However, Legal

Advisor to the President James
Siena, who served as prosecutor
in the case, said that the decision
to prosecute was touched off by
the library's new hard line on
disruptions.
"By the end of last winter
quarter it became apparent that
the library was virtually unusa
ble because it was being used as
a stage or platform," Siena said.
"The band knew about (the
new policy), and they went
ahead and did it,"he said.
First impression
Students charged with violat
ing the Campus Disruption Pol
icy usually have the option of
appealing to the dean ot stu
dents. However. Dean James
Lyons declined to review the
case because the violation of the
library's new policy made it "a
case of first impression" (with
out precedent), he said.
