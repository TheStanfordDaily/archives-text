# Negotiations hit USE obstacle
## 
### John Freed 
In a move reminiscent of the
debate over the shape of the table
at the Paris Peace Talks, pre
negotiation sessions between
the University and United Stan
ford Employees (USE) union
have hit a stumbling block.
At issue is "release time," or
time off with pay, for USE
negotiators. In 1973, when USE
negotiated its first contract for
some 1350 technical, mainte
nance and service employes,
about half of the negotiating ses
sions were on University time,
with the rest on the negotiators'
own time.
The University filed an unfair
labor practice charge with the
National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) yesterday over the mat
ter.
The union has refused to
schedule collective bargaining
sessions or to negotiate the re
lease time issue, according to
Douglas Barton. University staff
counsel for employe relations.
Criticized stance
Roger Hardy, an elected
member of the union's negotiat
ing team, criticized Barton's
stance on the release time issue.

"There were a number of
(elected) union negotiators who
had gained release time under
other contract provisions,"
Hardy explained. They include
union stewards (who represent
employes at grievance hearings)
and members of union-
University committees.
"Barton has said that no one
who had release time for any
other reason could be a
negotiator . . . Those who have
releas,e time are union activists.''
Harty said. "Barton's refusal
puts a very serious stumbling
block in the path of negotia
tions."
Barton has offered to negotiate
the release time issue at a meet
ing held under the 1973 bargain
ing conditions. These condi
tions include stipulations that
some of the meeting be held on
workers' time and that no more
than five employes receive re
lease time for the meeting.
On his terms
"Barton wants us to meet on
his terms." Hardy complained.
He noted that this year's
negotiating team consists of six
University employes plus union
