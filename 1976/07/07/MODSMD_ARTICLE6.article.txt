# Beauty and the Bay
## 
### 
Hello from the San Francisco
Bay Area. I just don't under
stand. . .Our weather out here
sure has been unusual :we had no
winter at all, that's right, no
rains, but in February between
warm spe'lls we awakened to
snow—yes, snow! Glad we had
the new movie camera with
sound because the kids had a
ball.

Right now we've just reco
vered from a record-shattering
heat wave. Just yesterday a
neighbor who once lived in Sac
ramento said the Bay Area now
seems to have a climate like the
central valleys of the state; you
know, hot and dry in the sum
mers. I think it was several years
ago that some environmentalist
or something said that if they
continue to fill the Bay and if the
air pollution level stays high —
our climate would change.
That's ridiculous! I mean
there's still the ocean, only now
the breeze doesn't blow in and
the fog isn't along the coast the
way it always is during the
summer.
The heat is so intense during
the day it doesn't even cool
down much at night. I told
George that unless we air
condition the house — every
room in the house — I will check
into a motel! Oh 1 know we have
the pool and the fiberglass lanai
and the remote control barbecue,
but people say that soon we

Pat A. Watkins

might start having "brown-outs"
— you know, loss of electricity
off and on. What about the food
in the freezers?
Thank heavens they did pass
the ballot measure to allow for
more nuclear power plants to be
built in the state but that's for the
future, they should do some
thing now! 1 just don't under
stand . . .
As if that's not enough, Marin
and parts of other counties
around here are on water ration
ing. George says if it happens to
us we'll wash the car and the
new camper in the backyard at
night.
And now would you believe,
they are threatening to close
down some of the major parks
and recreational areas because of
the forest fires recently. George

has even stored extra gasoline
for the camper in the tool shed
and now to think we might not
be able to go anywhere to use it! I
just don't understand . . .
If you come out here for a visit,
you'll sure be amazed at the way
the area has grown. Why it seems
that San Francisco and San Jose
all run in together now. Oh. you
must see Great America .amuse
ment park. It is almost as big as
Disneyland and all around it are
hotels and restaurants; we spent
the Fourth of July there. What a
great way to celebrate the Bicen
tennial. even if it means we have
to go the night before to wait in
line. Everything is so crowded
and congested and in this heat
too. I just don't understand. . .

might start having "brown-outs"
— you know, loss of electricity
off and on. What about the food
in the freezers?
Thank heavens they did pass
the ballot measure to allow for
more nuclear power plants to be
built in the state but that's for the
future, they should do some
thing now! 1 just don't under
stand . . .
As if that's not enough, Marin
and parts of other counties
around here are on water ration
ing. George says if it happens to
us we'll wash the car and the
new camper in the backyard at
night.
And now would you believe,
they are threatening to close
down some of the major parks
and recreational areas because of
the forest fires recently. George

has even stored extra gasoline
for the camper in the tool shed
and now to think we might not
be able to go anywhere to use it! I
just don't understand . . .
If you come out here for a visit,
you'll sure be amazed at the way
the area has grown. Why it seems
that San Francisco and San Jose
all run in together now. Oh. you
must see Great America .amuse
ment park. It is almost as big as
Disneyland and all around it are
hotels and restaurants; we spent
the Fourth of July there. What a
great way to celebrate the Bicen
tennial. even if it means we have
to go the night before to wait in
line. Everything is so crowded
and congested and in this heat
too. I just don't understand. . .

Hello from the San Francisco
Bay Area. I just don't under
stand. . .Our weather out here
sure has been unusual :we had no
winter at all, that's right, no
rains, but in February between
warm spe'lls we awakened to
snow—yes, snow! Glad we had
the new movie camera with
sound because the kids had a
ball.

Right now we've just reco
vered from a record-shattering
heat wave. Just yesterday a
neighbor who once lived in Sac
ramento said the Bay Area now
seems to have a climate like the
central valleys of the state; you
know, hot and dry in the sum
mers. I think it was several years
ago that some environmentalist
or something said that if they
continue to fill the Bay and if the
air pollution level stays high —
our climate would change.
That's ridiculous! I mean
there's still the ocean, only now
the breeze doesn't blow in and
the fog isn't along the coast the
way it always is during the
summer.
The heat is so intense during
the day it doesn't even cool
down much at night. I told
George that unless we air
condition the house — every
room in the house — I will check
into a motel! Oh 1 know we have
the pool and the fiberglass lanai
and the remote control barbecue,
but people say that soon we
