Democrat David Harris yes
terday belittled the view of Rep.
Paul N. McCloskey Jr. (R-Menlo
Park) that voters should support
the Democratic presidential
nominee if the Republican re
fuses to support amnesty for Vie

posing McCloskey for the in
cumbent's 12th Congressional
District seat.
McCloskey had made the
statement Saturday at Frost Am

Harris also attended.
"If the Republican candidate

won't grant amnesty, people,
Republicans or Democrats.

should vote to finally wipe out
this scar of the Vietnam experi

McCloskey opposed former
President Richard Nixon's Viet

that he opposed Nixon for the
Republican presidential nomi

after refusing to be inducted into
the U.S. Army to fight in Viet

McCloskey supported Presi

"Again, it's a case of him try
ing to look like a Democrat," he
said.
