Could you tell us how the word
"Stanford" is inserted into the
Stanford chews candy sold at
the bookstore? -G.D.D.
The process, called "extru
sion," operates on the same
principle as one of those cookie
presses which squeezes out
leaves, hearts and strange little
animals.
According to Dan Watt, a
spokesman for the Du-Von ad
vertising agency which sells the
chews to Stanford, the candy is
pulled through a "die" while it
is still warm, red on the inside
and white on the outside.
For those who have never
sampled these particular sweets
(which they're currently out of at
the bookstore), they resemble
candy kisses but are made of
taffy. The word "Stanford,"
printed in red, and a red border
around the outside last all the
way through the kiss.
Incidentally, these candies
also come in "state university"
and "Mormon" versions. You
can eat blue-and-gold kisses at
San Jose State and blue-and
white ones at Brigham Young.

I am somewhat phobic about
food poisoning and am more

careful than most people. How
ever, I hate to throw out fresh
eggs just because they're
cracked. Can they be safely
cooked and eaten? Can they be
used in a cake recipe or fed to
pets? -C.C.
Raul Perez, the quality control
fruit, vegetable and egg inspec
tor for the Santa Clara county
department of agriculture, has
just one piece of advice: take the
eggs back.
Perez said that any leaking egg
(known as "leakers" in the egg
biz) are immediately rejected by
his department. In fact, three
leakers discovered in 750 dozen
will cause the entire batch to be
returned to the egg dealer. In ad
dition, an inspection report is
sent to the county commissioner
who makes sure that the eggs are
disposed of and not resold.
The problem is that eggs with
cracks are likely to have foreign
substances inside them, includ
ing such undesirable comesti
bles as chicken manure. Perez
remembers cracking open
strange-looking eggs so bad that
their aroma forced everyone out
of the room.
And so if you do find a leaker

among your dozen don't bother
experimenting. You might get
some rather fowl omelets.

As University staff members
ive're very grateful for the oppor
tunity to sivim in the deGuerre
pools during our lunch hour.
However, over the past week, we
were kept waiting outside the
gate as late as 12:10. We ap
preciate the reasons for not al
lowing anyone into the water
without lifeguards, but how
about letting us in to change our
clothes? With only an hour for
lunch we don't want to spend
even five minutes waiting out
side a gate. -8.Y., L.F., D.L., and
G.W.
Legally the deGuerre staff
cannot let you anywhere into the
pool area without a lifeguard on
duty. However, they have prom
ised to start opening on time. Let
us know if things don't improve
in the verv near future.
