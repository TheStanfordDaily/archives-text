Those who have participated
in Stanford-Red Cross blood
drives know that donating
blood is a simple process.
In less than an hour, an indi
vidual passes a medical history
screening, has his blood pres
sure, temperature, pulse and
hemoglobin checked and do
nates a unit of blood.
Donors generally have little
idea what happens to their blood
after they leave, however.
Shortly after it is drawn, the
blood is sent to a processing lab,
where it is typed and checked for
hepatitis and venereal disease.
In addition, information on an
tibodies is obtained and entered
into a computer for future refer
ence.
Separation
If it passes the screening, the
unit (slightly less than a pint) is
separated into four components:
plasma, red cells, platelets and
cryoprecipitate.
The red cells, those that carry
oxygen, are used in 80 percent of
the blood transfusions in the
United States.
The plasma is used either as a
source of blood constituents for
patients, or it is "fractionated"
(broken into its components)
and used to manufacture drugs.
Leukemia patients receive the

platelets, as their bone marrow is
unable to produce sufficient
numbers of these cell fragments.
Finally, the cryoprecipitate
particles removed under super
cold temperatures is given to
hemophiliacs, as it is rich in Fac
tor VIII, a clotting substance.
Destinations
Until the supply at the hospi
tal here runs low, the blood is
kept at the center. Since the red

cells can be stored for only 21
days, they are sent to other hos
pitals when surpluses develop.
The center normally has
enough blood to meet the needs
of Stanford Hospital. In cir
cumstances such as a heart
transplant, available supplies
may not be sufficient. In these
situations past donors are
phoned and asked to donate

Eshleman flew to Pasadena
Tuesday night with the results of
echoes that had been bounced
off the red planet between
Saturday and Tuesday.
Leonard Tyler, an adjunct pro
fessor at the Stanford Electronic
Laboratories, has been staying in
Pasadena, where he is in charge
of analyzing the radar data.
'Cautious' route
Both Eshleman and Tyler re
commended to project director
James Martin that he "take the
more cautious route" and delay
the landing again. Eshleman
said.
Attention is now being fo
cused on a third site, to the west
of Northwest. Eshleman said
that radar echos off of the new
site show it to be smoother than
either of the other proposed reg
ions. It is located in "very old"
foothills surrounding theChrvse
plain.
Photographs will be taken of
the new site in the next few days.
Eshleman said, but a landing
there can take place no earlier
than July 20.
If the photographs seem to
show rougher terrain. Eshleman
said, it is unlikely another site
will be examined. Officials
would have to choose between it
or Northwest Territory or possi
bly a previously examined alter
nate site hundreds of kilometers
away.
But the landing decision will
have to be made soon. Scientists
are concerned about getting Vik
ing 1 on the surface before its
twin. Viking 11, swings into orbit

A ROUGH ONE—This surface on Mars looks deceptively flat. National Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration officials decided Wednesday that the site, called the Northwest Territory, was too rough for
the Viking I spacecraft, after checking radar data coordinated by Stanford scientists.
Those who have participated
in Stanford-Red Cross blood
drives know that donating
blood is a simple process.
In less than an hour, an indi
vidual passes a medical history
screening, has his blood pres
sure, temperature, pulse and
hemoglobin checked and do
nates a unit of blood.
Donors generally have little
idea what happens to their blood
after they leave, however.
Shortly after it is drawn, the
blood is sent to a processing lab,
where it is typed and checked for
hepatitis and venereal disease.
In addition, information on an
tibodies is obtained and entered
into a computer for future refer
ence.
Separation
If it passes the screening, the
unit (slightly less than a pint) is
separated into four components:
plasma, red cells, platelets and
cryoprecipitate.
The red cells, those that carry
oxygen, are used in 80 percent of
the blood transfusions in the
United States.
The plasma is used either as a
source of blood constituents for
patients, or it is "fractionated"
(broken into its components)
and used to manufacture drugs.
Leukemia patients receive the

platelets, as their bone marrow is
unable to produce sufficient
numbers of these cell fragments.
Finally, the cryoprecipitate
particles removed under super
cold temperatures is given to
hemophiliacs, as it is rich in Fac
tor VIII, a clotting substance.
Destinations
Until the supply at the hospi
tal here runs low, the blood is
kept at the center. Since the red

cells can be stored for only 21
days, they are sent to other hos
pitals when surpluses develop.
The center normally has
enough blood to meet the needs
of Stanford Hospital. In cir
cumstances such as a heart
transplant, available supplies
may not be sufficient. In these
situations past donors are
phoned and asked to donate
rough, while photographs of
Northwest Territory looked
smoother.
"But it turned out to be just as
rough as Chryse." he said.
His committee's guidelines for
site selection require that an area
look smooth in both photos and
radar data. The two methods
yield conflicting results because
they operate on different scales
— radar tending to be more accu
rate.

The quality of the terrain is ot
vital importance to the Viking
landing. NASA scientists have
no way of selecting exactly
where Viking comes down — so
they must reduce the possibility
of the craft's landing on boulders
or steep hillsides, Eshleman
said.
The photographs are sent to
Earth by the Viking orbiter.
