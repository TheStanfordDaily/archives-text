# Where donated blood goes
## Stanford Red Cross center aids hospital 
### Mark Bamberger 
Those who have participated
in Stanford-Red Cross blood
drives know that donating
blood is a simple process.
In less than an hour, an indi
vidual passes a medical history
screening, has his blood pres
sure, temperature, pulse and
hemoglobin checked and do
nates a unit of blood.
Donors generally have little
idea what happens to their blood
after they leave, however.
Shortly after it is drawn, the
blood is sent to a processing lab,
where it is typed and checked for
hepatitis and venereal disease.
In addition, information on an
tibodies is obtained and entered
into a computer for future refer
ence.
Separation
If it passes the screening, the
unit (slightly less than a pint) is
separated into four components:
plasma, red cells, platelets and
cryoprecipitate.
The red cells, those that carry
oxygen, are used in 80 percent of
the blood transfusions in the
United States.
The plasma is used either as a
source of blood constituents for
patients, or it is "fractionated"
(broken into its components)
and used to manufacture drugs.
Leukemia patients receive the

platelets, as their bone marrow is
unable to produce sufficient
numbers of these cell fragments.
Finally, the cryoprecipitate
particles removed under super
cold temperatures is given to
hemophiliacs, as it is rich in Fac
tor VIII, a clotting substance.
Destinations
Until the supply at the hospi
tal here runs low, the blood is
kept at the center. Since the red

cells can be stored for only 21
days, they are sent to other hos
pitals when surpluses develop.
The center normally has
enough blood to meet the needs
of Stanford Hospital. In cir
cumstances such as a heart
transplant, available supplies
may not be sufficient. In these
situations past donors are
phoned and asked to donate
