For those fortunates who had
tickets for the recent 11 p.m.
John Denver concert at the Cow
Palace, hiking to the Cow Palace
and then waiting an hour inside
before the show began due to
traffic conjestion of the com
bined 7 and 11 p.m. concerts, the
mood was ultimately set for kick
ing back and relaxing to good
music by midnight.
When the show finally opened
with the Starland Vocal Band,
the near-sellout crowd awoke
with applause as the group from
Washington D.C. touched off the
morning with a few of their orig
inal rather slow moving tunes.
Russell Smith's fantasy, entitled
"Afternoon Delight" was the
highlight of their 30 minute per
formance, which had gotten the
crowd properly awakened and
alive with enthusiasm for its
star performer: John Denver.
Denver walked to the center
stage greeted by a multitude of
flashcubes and a rousing round
of applause, and launched into
"Annie's Song" for his opening
number. His voice was clear and
moving, which was the essence
of his entire performance.
Denver spoke openly with the
audience, pardoning himself
several times to re-tune his
guitars, which assured that he
was perfectly on key for every
number. There were no notice
able mistakes in his perfor
mance, which centered on selec
tions from his new Windsong al
bum, and his An Evening With
John Denver LP.
Good naturedly he bid his
friends "good morning" and en
couraged everyone to sing along
with him: "You don't even have
to limit yourself to the choruses,
gang."
Denver's versatility as a musi
cian and vocalist was
exemplified in his performance
by his ability to shift from a very
slow moving, meaningful piece
like "Matthew," to Tokyo's favo

rite, the fast moving "Grandma's
Feather Bed," and then from
Michael Murphy's "Boy From
the Country" to the bluegrass
sound of "Thank God I'm a
Country Boy."
With a very talented quartet of
musicians backing him, includ
ing percussionist Hal Blaine,
bass fiddler Dick Kniss and
multi-instrumentalists Steve
Weisberg and John Sommers,
Denver switched smoothly from
mellow country music to the
very lively bluegrass "yeee
hah!" sound with a genuine fid
dler, hubcap guitarist and
washboard player.
Denver's "favorite song in the
whole universe," which he also
considers the most difficult for
himself because of it's high
range of notes, is "Looking For
Space" which is on his newest
album, Windsong.
The two songs that were the
most enthusiastically received
were "Grandmother's Feather
Bed" and "Thank God I'm a
Country Boy," which had the
crowd clapping and stomping in
time to the fast pace.
Aside from the blinding flash
of flashcubes popping off during
the less rigorous numbers, there
was a sing-around-the-campfire
atmosphere on numbers like
"Back Home Again" and "Rocky
Mountain High," in which
nearly everyone joined in on
more than just the chorus.
Other favorites that Denver in
cluded were "Fly Away,"
"Poems, Prayers, and Promises,"
"Like a Sad Song." "Eli's Song "
and "Calypso," the song Denver
wrote for Jacques Cousteau.
The Starland Vocal Band
joined Denver in "Baby You
Look Good to Me Tonight," and
"Friends With You," and Denver
appropriately concluded his one
and one half hour show with
"Take Me Home, Country
Roads," just before everyone
dashed to their cars and took
themselves home.

mellow country music to the
very lively bluegrass "yeee
hah!" sound with a genuine fid
dler, hubcap guitarist and
washboard player.
Denver's "favorite song in the
whole universe," which he also
considers the most difficult for
himself because of it's high
range of notes, is "Looking For
Space" which is on his newest
album, Windsong.
The two songs that were the
most enthusiastically received
were "Grandmother's Feather
Bed" and "Thank God I'm a
Country Boy," which had the
crowd clapping and stomping in
time to the fast pace.
Aside from the blinding flash
of flashcubes popping off during
the less rigorous numbers, there
was a sing-around-the-campfire
atmosphere on numbers like
"Back Home Again" and "Rocky
Mountain High," in which
nearly everyone joined in on
more than just the chorus.
Other favorites that Denver in
cluded were "Fly Away,"
"Poems, Prayers, and Promises,"
"Like a Sad Song." "Eli's Song "
and "Calypso," the song Denver
wrote for Jacques Cousteau.
The Starland Vocal Band
joined Denver in "Baby You
Look Good to Me Tonight," and
"Friends With You," and Denver
appropriately concluded his one
and one half hour show with
"Take Me Home, Country
Roads," just before everyone
dashed to their cars and took
themselves home.
For those fortunates who had
tickets for the recent 11 p.m.
John Denver concert at the Cow
Palace, hiking to the Cow Palace
and then waiting an hour inside
before the show began due to
traffic conjestion of the com
bined 7 and 11 p.m. concerts, the
mood was ultimately set for kick
ing back and relaxing to good
music by midnight.
When the show finally opened
with the Starland Vocal Band,
the near-sellout crowd awoke
with applause as the group from
Washington D.C. touched off the
morning with a few of their orig
inal rather slow moving tunes.
Russell Smith's fantasy, entitled
"Afternoon Delight" was the
highlight of their 30 minute per
formance, which had gotten the
crowd properly awakened and
alive with enthusiasm for its
star performer: John Denver.
Denver walked to the center
stage greeted by a multitude of
flashcubes and a rousing round
of applause, and launched into
"Annie's Song" for his opening
number. His voice was clear and
moving, which was the essence
of his entire performance.
Denver spoke openly with the
audience, pardoning himself
several times to re-tune his
guitars, which assured that he
was perfectly on key for every
number. There were no notice
able mistakes in his perfor
mance, which centered on selec
tions from his new Windsong al
bum, and his An Evening With
John Denver LP.
Good naturedly he bid his
friends "good morning" and en
couraged everyone to sing along
with him: "You don't even have
to limit yourself to the choruses,
gang."
Denver's versatility as a musi
cian and vocalist was
exemplified in his performance
by his ability to shift from a very
slow moving, meaningful piece
like "Matthew," to Tokyo's favo

rite, the fast moving "Grandma's
Feather Bed," and then from
Michael Murphy's "Boy From
the Country" to the bluegrass
sound of "Thank God I'm a
Country Boy."
With a very talented quartet of
musicians backing him, includ
ing percussionist Hal Blaine,
bass fiddler Dick Kniss and
multi-instrumentalists Steve
Weisberg and John Sommers,
Denver switched smoothly from
mellow country music to the
very lively bluegrass "yeee
hah!" sound with a genuine fid
dler, hubcap guitarist and
washboard player.
