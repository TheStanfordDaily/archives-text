# Day no. 5: nubile nostalgia
## 
### Susie Kaplan 
Nostalgia filled the air of the Oakland Coliseum
last Friday afternoon as the rock idols of Southern
California, the Beach Boys, serenaded fifty
thousand screaming and dancing fans — most of
whom were too young to even remember what a
"deuce coupe" was. The "new" Beach Boys,
complete with hip beards and the casual So. Cal.
look, presented the devoted group with a mixture
of their golden oldies and tunes from their re
cently released album Fifteen Big Ones.
Unfortunately, the twilight concert was marred
by the inadequacies of a sound system that

sounded like an AM radio turned on too loud.
Regrettably, their familiar simple tunes of the '60s
were not as lively and harmonic as their original
recordings had been. A subtle indication of the
Beach Boys' approaching antiquity was the re
fusal of Mike Love to remove his hat during the
performance in order to prevent his fans from
viewing his rapidly receding hairline.
Nonetheless, the fans were enthusiastic, the
moon was beautiful, and the memory of the good
times we associate with songs like "Help Me
Rhonda " sent the whole crowd home with sun
burned shoulders and sun-tanned hearts.
