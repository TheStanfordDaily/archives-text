# 'The Big Bus' breaks down
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
(The folloiving is an exchange
between the Stanford Daily film
critic and a member of the Dai
ly's vast audienceJ-
Critic: I saw an unusual movie
the other day.
Audience: So what else is
new? You go to the movies like I
go to the bathroom.
C: That's my job.
A: I have a suggestion — go
back to being a janitor.
C: The movie was called The
Big Bus.
A: You review porno films
now?
C: What? Oh —not The Big
Bust, The Big Bus. It's a takeoff
on disaster films like Earthquake
and The Poseidon Adventure.
A: Was it good?
C: Not really.
A: Why not?
C: Well, that's what I'm not
sure of.
A: Is this your first day?
C: It wasn't bad — but it cer
tainly wasn't good.
A: Tell me about it. Maybe if
we discuss it, you'll understand
it better.
Here goes
C: The Big Bus is about the
maiden non-stop New York-to-
Denver run of Cyclops, the
world's first nuclear-powered
bus. It carries 180 passengers
and is equipped with a bowling
alley, a cocktail lounge and a
swimming pool.
A: You're making this up,
aren't you?
C: I'm not that imaginative.
A: That's true, you're not.
Who's in it?
C: Joe Bologna, who was in
Cops and Robbers, Stockard
Channing, who was in The For
tune, John Beck, who played
Moonpie in Rollerball, Ruth
Gordon, who played Maude in
Harold and, Sally Kellerman,
Lynn Redgrave and Larry Hag
man.
A: Yawn.
C: Don't get me wrong — parts
of the movie were really funny —
especially when Shoulders
o'Brien-(they call him Shoul
ders not because of his broad
build but because he usually
drives on the shoulders) takes a
milk carton in a bar brawl and
breaks it open like a bottle.
A: It sounds hilarious.
C: And of course there was the

time when Dan Torrance
(Bologna) had to flood the
kitchen with soda pop to prevent
the bus from going over a cliff,
without knowing he's about to
drown his girlfriend.
A: Stockard Channing.
C: You've seen it.
A: A lucky guess. Is this sup
posed to be funny?
C: I'm beginning to see why I
didn't like it. Actually, it plays a
lot better than it sounds.
A: I hope so.
C: It had all the elements
necessary for a satire on disaster
movies — a cast of names rather
than stars, enroute collisions be
tween the bus and an errant
pickup truck, sabotage and old
love affairs. The only problem, I
think, was that disaster movies
are on the whole so funny by
themselves that they are often
unintentional pariodies of each
other. What The Big Bus in effect
does is satirize what is already a
form of comedy, which never
works. You can't make a joke
about Airport 1975 because Ai
rport 1975 was such a joke by it
self in the first place.
A: You know something?
C: What?
A: 1 don't understand a word
of what you just said.
C: Well, it really doesn't mat
ter, because The Big Bus has
been getting great reviews and

lots of publicity and has an at
tractive cast, so it'll make big
money and I'll end up with the
minority opinion, just like I did
with Barry Lyndon.Which they
still haven't forgiven me for.
A: Was it a stupid satire?
C: No, its intelligence was one
of its strong points. It took all its
idiocy seriously. The music,
especially, heightens the sense
of disaster epics. It captures that
terror perfectly. And nobody
ever cracks a smile.
A: Including the audience?
C: I'm afraid so.
A: Weren't the situations
funny enough?
C: I guess not.
A: You keep saying 'I guess'
and 'I'm afraid'! Aren't you sure
of anything anymore?
C: Probably not.
A: What was wrong with the
situations? Weren't they wacky
enough?
C: They were appropriate, and
exactly what you'd expect from a
satire on disaster films —
turnarounds on the typical
cliches.
A: Then what you're stumbl
ing around trying to say is that it
was predictable.
C: Look, who's writing this,
you or me?
A: Aren't all disaster films
predictable, though? If the satire
wants to retain the characteris

tics of its target in order to suc
ceed, shouldn't it, in this case, be
as predictable?
C: How did this get out of con
trol?
A: Well?
C: I'm thinking. The problem
was that it wasn't funny in its
predictability. Its predictability
was too predictable.
A: Are you deliberately trying
to confuse me, or do you actually
now know what you're talking
about?
C: A little of both.
A: Was The Big Bus good or
not?
C: It wasn't!
A: Why not?
C: I don't know!
A: And you call yourself a cri
tic?
C: Where are you going?
A: To see The Big Bus. I love
everything you hate.

A: You're making this up,
aren't you?
C: I'm not that imaginative.
A: That's true, you're not.
Who's in it?
C: Joe Bologna, who was in
Cops and Robbers, Stockard
Channing, who was in The For
tune, John Beck, who played
Moonpie in Rollerball, Ruth
Gordon, who played Maude in
Harold and, Sally Kellerman,
Lynn Redgrave and Larry Hag
man.
A: Yawn.
C: Don't get me wrong — parts
of the movie were really funny —
especially when Shoulders
o'Brien-(they call him Shoul
ders not because of his broad
build but because he usually
drives on the shoulders) takes a
milk carton in a bar brawl and
breaks it open like a bottle.
A: It sounds hilarious.
C: And of course there was the

time when Dan Torrance
(Bologna) had to flood the
kitchen with soda pop to prevent
the bus from going over a cliff,
without knowing he's about to
drown his girlfriend.
A: Stockard Channing.
C: You've seen it.
A: A lucky guess. Is this sup
posed to be funny?
C: I'm beginning to see why I
didn't like it. Actually, it plays a
lot better than it sounds.
A: I hope so.
C: It had all the elements
necessary for a satire on disaster
movies — a cast of names rather
than stars, enroute collisions be
tween the bus and an errant
pickup truck, sabotage and old
love affairs. The only problem, I
think, was that disaster movies
are on the whole so funny by
themselves that they are often
unintentional pariodies of each
other. What The Big Bus in effect
does is satirize what is already a
form of comedy, which never
works. You can't make a joke
about Airport 1975 because Ai
rport 1975 was such a joke by it
self in the first place.
A: You know something?
C: What?
A: 1 don't understand a word
of what you just said.
C: Well, it really doesn't mat
ter, because The Big Bus has
been getting great reviews and

lots of publicity and has an at
tractive cast, so it'll make big
money and I'll end up with the
minority opinion, just like I did
with Barry Lyndon.Which they
still haven't forgiven me for.
A: Was it a stupid satire?
C: No, its intelligence was one
of its strong points. It took all its
idiocy seriously. The music,
especially, heightens the sense
of disaster epics. It captures that
terror perfectly. And nobody
ever cracks a smile.
A: Including the audience?
C: I'm afraid so.
A: Weren't the situations
funny enough?
C: I guess not.
A: You keep saying 'I guess'
and 'I'm afraid'! Aren't you sure
of anything anymore?
C: Probably not.
A: What was wrong with the
situations? Weren't they wacky
enough?
C: They were appropriate, and
exactly what you'd expect from a
satire on disaster films —
turnarounds on the typical
cliches.
A: Then what you're stumbl
ing around trying to say is that it
was predictable.
C: Look, who's writing this,
you or me?
A: Aren't all disaster films
predictable, though? If the satire
wants to retain the characteris

tics of its target in order to suc
ceed, shouldn't it, in this case, be
as predictable?
C: How did this get out of con
trol?
A: Well?
C: I'm thinking. The problem
was that it wasn't funny in its
predictability. Its predictability
was too predictable.
A: Are you deliberately trying
to confuse me, or do you actually
now know what you're talking
about?
C: A little of both.
A: Was The Big Bus good or
not?
C: It wasn't!
A: Why not?
C: I don't know!
A: And you call yourself a cri
tic?
C: Where are you going?
A: To see The Big Bus. I love
everything you hate.

C: It had all the elements
necessary for a satire on disaster
movies — a cast of names rather
than stars, enroute collisions be
tween the bus and an errant
pickup truck, sabotage and old
love affairs. The only problem, I
think, was that disaster movies
are on the whole so funny by
themselves that they are often
unintentional pariodies of each
other. What The Big Bus in effect
does is satirize what is already a
form of comedy, which never
works. You can't make a joke
about Airport 1975 because Ai
rport 1975 was such a joke by it
self in the first place.
A: You know something?
C: What?
A: 1 don't understand a word
of what you just said.
C: Well, it really doesn't mat
ter, because The Big Bus has
been getting great reviews and

lots of publicity and has an at
tractive cast, so it'll make big
money and I'll end up with the
minority opinion, just like I did
with Barry Lyndon.Which they
still haven't forgiven me for.
A: Was it a stupid satire?
C: No, its intelligence was one
of its strong points. It took all its
idiocy seriously. The music,
especially, heightens the sense
of disaster epics. It captures that
terror perfectly. And nobody
ever cracks a smile.
A: Including the audience?
C: I'm afraid so.
A: Weren't the situations
funny enough?
C: I guess not.
A: You keep saying 'I guess'
and 'I'm afraid'! Aren't you sure
of anything anymore?
C: Probably not.
A: What was wrong with the
situations? Weren't they wacky
enough?
C: They were appropriate, and
exactly what you'd expect from a
satire on disaster films —
turnarounds on the typical
cliches.
A: Then what you're stumbl
ing around trying to say is that it
was predictable.
C: Look, who's writing this,
you or me?
A: Aren't all disaster films
predictable, though? If the satire
wants to retain the characteris

tics of its target in order to suc
ceed, shouldn't it, in this case, be
as predictable?
C: How did this get out of con
trol?
A: Well?
C: I'm thinking. The problem
was that it wasn't funny in its
predictability. Its predictability
was too predictable.
A: Are you deliberately trying
to confuse me, or do you actually
now know what you're talking
about?
C: A little of both.
A: Was The Big Bus good or
not?
C: It wasn't!
A: Why not?
C: I don't know!
A: And you call yourself a cri
tic?
C: Where are you going?
A: To see The Big Bus. I love
everything you hate.

THE BIG BUS—In the foreground, left to right, the crew of Cyclops — Joe Bologna, Stockard Channing,
John Beck. On the stairway, a few of the passengers — Ruth Gordon, Bob Dishy, Murphy Dunne, Mary
Wilcox, Richard B. Shull, Lynn Redgrave, Rene Auberjonois, Sally Kellerman and Richard Mulligan.
(The folloiving is an exchange
between the Stanford Daily film
critic and a member of the Dai
ly's vast audienceJ-
Critic: I saw an unusual movie
the other day.
Audience: So what else is
new? You go to the movies like I
go to the bathroom.
C: That's my job.
A: I have a suggestion — go
back to being a janitor.
C: The movie was called The
Big Bus.
A: You review porno films
now?
C: What? Oh —not The Big
Bust, The Big Bus. It's a takeoff
on disaster films like Earthquake
and The Poseidon Adventure.
A: Was it good?
C: Not really.
A: Why not?
C: Well, that's what I'm not
sure of.
A: Is this your first day?
C: It wasn't bad — but it cer
tainly wasn't good.
A: Tell me about it. Maybe if
we discuss it, you'll understand
it better.
Here goes
C: The Big Bus is about the
maiden non-stop New York-to-
Denver run of Cyclops, the
world's first nuclear-powered
bus. It carries 180 passengers
and is equipped with a bowling
alley, a cocktail lounge and a
swimming pool.
A: You're making this up,
aren't you?
C: I'm not that imaginative.
A: That's true, you're not.
Who's in it?
C: Joe Bologna, who was in
Cops and Robbers, Stockard
Channing, who was in The For
tune, John Beck, who played
Moonpie in Rollerball, Ruth
Gordon, who played Maude in
Harold and, Sally Kellerman,
Lynn Redgrave and Larry Hag
man.
A: Yawn.
C: Don't get me wrong — parts
of the movie were really funny —
especially when Shoulders
o'Brien-(they call him Shoul
ders not because of his broad
build but because he usually
drives on the shoulders) takes a
milk carton in a bar brawl and
breaks it open like a bottle.
A: It sounds hilarious.
C: And of course there was the

time when Dan Torrance
(Bologna) had to flood the
kitchen with soda pop to prevent
the bus from going over a cliff,
without knowing he's about to
drown his girlfriend.
A: Stockard Channing.
C: You've seen it.
A: A lucky guess. Is this sup
posed to be funny?
C: I'm beginning to see why I
didn't like it. Actually, it plays a
lot better than it sounds.
A: I hope so.
