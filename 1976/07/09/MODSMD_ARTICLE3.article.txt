## Card poloists USSR-bound 
### 
Stanford's water polo team has officially ac
cepted an invitation to play a six-game series
against Moscow State University in the Soviet
Union Aug. 20-30.
The visit will complete the home-and-home
series between the Cardinals and the Soviets.
Moscow State visited the Bay Area in April
1975.
Stanford's meeting with Moscow State made
international water polo history â€” it marked
the first time that two college teams from dif
ferent nations met in water polo competition.
The Soviets beat Stanford 14-9 in that game.
The Cards, fourth in the NCAA water polo
tournament last year, will face Moscow State in
games to be played in Moscow, Leningrad and
Kiev. The trip will also include stops in West
Germany and Hungary, where the Cards will
face teams from those countries.

"We see the importance of this trip as
twofold," said Stanford coach Art Lambert,
who coached the U.S. Olympic Team to a
bronze medal in 1972.
"It provides a great opportunity for members
of the Stanford team to broaden the scope of
their education through a unique cultural ex
perience.
"Secondly, the exchange will provide in
valuable world class experience for our
players," Lambert said, adding that members
of the Soviet National team comprise 3/4 of the
Moscow State squad.
While the Cards are in the U.S.S R., their
room, board and living expenses will be paid
by Moscow State. But the trip will still cost at
least $1100 per person. Each player on the team
is financing part of the cost himself. Lambert is
also seeking sponsors to help defray the rest of
the cost.
