terday. In its action, the Appel
late Division of the New York
State Supreme Court cited Ni

gate bugging and cover-up.
In its opinion, the court con
cluded that Nixon "improperly

concealed and encouraged
others to conceal evidence relat
ing to unlawful activities."
Nixon's disbarment was to take
effect Aug. 9, two years to the
day after Nixon became the first
president ever to resign.
Nixon was permitted to resign
from the California bar without
admitting any misconduct, but
his attempts to do the same in
New York were blocked twice.
The disbarment carries ho crim
inal convictions with it. but pre
vents him from practicing law in
New York.
The court's ruling also cited
Nixon's "improper attempts to
obstruct an investigation by the
U.S. Department of justice of an
unlawful entry into the offices of
Or. Lewis Fielding, a psychiat
rist who had treated Daniel
Ellsberg."
