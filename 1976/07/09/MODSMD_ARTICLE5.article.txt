# One more Mars site rejected
## 
### Dave Ansley 
Officials at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena an
nounced Wednesday that they
have rejected a second proposed
site for the Viking I landing on
Mars. The decision was based on
new radar data collected over the
July 4th weekend by a team of
Stanford scientists.
The unmanned spacecraft,
which was launched almost a
year ago, is the first American
attempt to land a probe on Mars.
It is designed to study the
planet's atmosphere, weather,
seismology and soil content and
to try to detect some form of I ife.
According to Electrical En
gineering Prof. Von Eshleman,
the "Northwest Territory"
turned out to be much rougher
than expected. Eshleman is the
chairman of a National Aeronau
tics and Space Administration
(NASA) committee overseeing
the use of radar data in landing
site selection.

again.
Blood that is donated in re
sponse to the request cannot be
used immediately, as the
hepatitis test takes 24 hours. In
stead, it is used to restock the
center or replace blood taken
from other blood banks.
Marilyn Coulson, director of

donor recruitment, says the goal
of the Stanford blood center is to
meet all the needs of Stanford
Hospital. It currently supplies
about 85 percent.
The remaining 15 percent is
supplied by the Peninsula Blood
Bank in Burlingame, a non-Red
Cross center.
While all centers charge pa
tients a processing fee for blood,
the Red Cross never charges for
the blood itself. On the other
hand. Peninsula, a member of
the American Association of
Blood Banks, charges an addi
tional $25 for each unit that is
not replaced by donations.
The difference in charging re
flects a fundamental difference
in the philosophies of the two
systems.
According to Coulson, the Red
Cross feels that donating blood is
a community responsibility, not
an individual one. The Red
Cross believes that it is up to the
community to maintain
adequate supplies, and that dur
ing a crisis, a family should not
be burdened with the responsi
bility to donate.
In the Stanford-Palo Alto area,
17 percent of the eligible people
donate blood, according to Coul
son. This, she says, is the highest
percentage in the country. As a
result, Stanford Hospital is able
to meet most of its needs with
Red Cross blood.
Commercial banks
Other areas need more than is
donated and must rely on com
mercial blood banks, ones that
pay for blood.
Commercial blood, Red Cross

literature states, is 10 times more
likely to cause hepatitis than
blood donated by volunteers.
This is because a person ex
pecting to receive money for his
blood is more likely to lie about
whether or not he has had
hepatitis, the Red Cross says.
(The test for the disease is only
50 percent effective.)
To attract donors, the Central
California Red Cross Regional
Blood Program, which includes
the Stanford center, has had a
program that provides blood free
of charge for a year following a
donation, and for life after eight
units have been donated.
That program is now being
phased out. Coulson says it was
somewhat misleading, as pa
tients were never charged for

Red Cross blood anyway, and the
coverage did not eliminate the
processing fee.
Since only three percent of the
donated blood was exchanged
through the plan, the high cost of
its administration was not jus
tified, Coulson says.
The plan was helpful to a reci
pient only if a non-Red Cross
blood group charged him for the
blood.
The plan was inconsistent
with the Red Cross philosophy
of community responsibility,
says Coulson, and it penalized
those unable to donate.
Coulson is confident that
elimination of the program will
not decrease donations. She says
donors give for altruistic reasons
and do not need "gimmicks."

Commercial banks
Other areas need more than is
donated and must rely on com
mercial blood banks, ones that
pay for blood.
Commercial blood, Red Cross

literature states, is 10 times more
likely to cause hepatitis than
blood donated by volunteers.
This is because a person ex
pecting to receive money for his
blood is more likely to lie about
whether or not he has had
hepatitis, the Red Cross says.
(The test for the disease is only
50 percent effective.)
To attract donors, the Central
California Red Cross Regional
Blood Program, which includes
the Stanford center, has had a
program that provides blood free
of charge for a year following a
donation, and for life after eight
units have been donated.
That program is now being
phased out. Coulson says it was
somewhat misleading, as pa
tients were never charged for

Red Cross blood anyway, and the
coverage did not eliminate the
processing fee.
Since only three percent of the
donated blood was exchanged
through the plan, the high cost of
its administration was not jus
tified, Coulson says.
The plan was helpful to a reci
pient only if a non-Red Cross
blood group charged him for the
blood.
The plan was inconsistent
with the Red Cross philosophy
of community responsibility,
says Coulson, and it penalized
those unable to donate.
Coulson is confident that
elimination of the program will
not decrease donations. She says
donors give for altruistic reasons
and do not need "gimmicks."
Officials at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena an
nounced Wednesday that they
have rejected a second proposed
site for the Viking I landing on
Mars. The decision was based on
new radar data collected over the
July 4th weekend by a team of
Stanford scientists.
The unmanned spacecraft,
which was launched almost a
year ago, is the first American
attempt to land a probe on Mars.
It is designed to study the
planet's atmosphere, weather,
seismology and soil content and
to try to detect some form of I ife.
According to Electrical En
gineering Prof. Von Eshleman,
the "Northwest Territory"
turned out to be much rougher
than expected. Eshleman is the
chairman of a National Aeronau
tics and Space Administration
(NASA) committee overseeing
the use of radar data in landing
site selection.
Rough terrain
The Northwest Territory had
been proposed as a landing site
after the primary site, known as
Chryse, was found to have
dangerously rough terrain. Esh
leman said that both high
resolution photographs and
radar result showed Chrvse to be
again.
Blood that is donated in re
sponse to the request cannot be
used immediately, as the
hepatitis test takes 24 hours. In
stead, it is used to restock the
center or replace blood taken
from other blood banks.
Marilyn Coulson, director of

donor recruitment, says the goal
of the Stanford blood center is to
meet all the needs of Stanford
Hospital. It currently supplies
about 85 percent.
The remaining 15 percent is
supplied by the Peninsula Blood
Bank in Burlingame, a non-Red
Cross center.
While all centers charge pa
tients a processing fee for blood,
the Red Cross never charges for
the blood itself. On the other
hand. Peninsula, a member of
the American Association of
Blood Banks, charges an addi
tional $25 for each unit that is
not replaced by donations.
The difference in charging re
flects a fundamental difference
in the philosophies of the two
systems.
According to Coulson, the Red
Cross feels that donating blood is
a community responsibility, not
an individual one. The Red
Cross believes that it is up to the
community to maintain
adequate supplies, and that dur
ing a crisis, a family should not
be burdened with the responsi
bility to donate.
In the Stanford-Palo Alto area,
17 percent of the eligible people
donate blood, according to Coul
son. This, she says, is the highest
percentage in the country. As a
result, Stanford Hospital is able
to meet most of its needs with
Red Cross blood.
