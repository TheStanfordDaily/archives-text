## For Carla Hills

William Donlon II

On a recent broadcast regard
ing a primary candidate Harry
Reasoner mentioned that he had
received seven letters, which
was a bundle of mail.
This number seemed like a
natural to me: perhaps a break
through to let the public know
that Carla Hills should be our
next president. Reasoner will re
ceive seven letters.
It would not be fair to judge
Gerald Ford's performance in of
fice because we are not privy to
the stipulations or limitations
that he took on at the time of his
appointment
But we can only hope it was
not part of the agreement that
Ford or Ronald Reagan must be
the only candidates They are as
similar as two peas in a pod.
Ford's most notable claim to
public attention prior to his ap
pointment was his unsuccessful
attempt to impeach retired Sup
reme Court Justice William O.
Douglas.
Ford has been a longtime par
ticipant in the Federal bureauc
racy; public credibility in the
bureaucracy is at its lowest ebb
ever; and it is an affront to the
intelligence of the voters to be
asked to perpetuate these condi
tions.

Public opinion polls now
show that there is absolutely no
way the incumbent party can
win the upcoming election un
less the Republicans employ all
the wiles at their disposal: step
away from the bureaucracy, to
ward the new female element,
and nominate Carla Hills.
Government, like business,
needs competition to eke out its
best performance. The two-party
system has become too lac
kadaisical in its performance.
Having no competition, it
awakes only at election time
with real vigor and after the elec
tion settles back with a biparti
san share-athon. The people pay
the freight.
But the strength of the two
party system is such that no third
party may enter: once we accept
the facts as they are, the solution
is simple. We must work w»th
what we have, and insert a new
element to make the two-party
system friendly-competitive.
The new element's name is
woman: the drafting and nomi
nation of Hills, the woman best
qualified to be president, will
give the people a real choice, a
rare thing in two-party elections.
