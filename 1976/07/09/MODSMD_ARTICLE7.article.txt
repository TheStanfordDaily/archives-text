As avid followers of Stanford
football, my husband and I have
long realized that the so-called
"quarterback controversy" is
among t he least of the Cardinals"
problems on the field.
And so when Jerry Waldvogel,
a man who has played little,
takes to task Jack Christiansen,
whose credentials as a former
player are impeccable and
whose experience as a coach is

long, whom are we to believe?
Waldvogel's comments were
self-serving and unnecessary —
an unfortunate parting shot by a
player whose name has been in
the papers a lot more than it
should have been.

Regarding Jerrv Waldvogel's
article on the quarterback prob

lem (Daily, June 2): Perhaps the
authorities in the future should
consider that the varsity coach
ought to have intelligence ap
proximately equal to that of his
students.
It may be difficult for a coach
with an I.Q. of 120 or lower to
instruct younger persons in the
150 to 160 area.
