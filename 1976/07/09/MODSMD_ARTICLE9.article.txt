# Israeli raid no solution

Leaders of the non-Arab world
have cheered the Israeli rescue of
the hostages from Uganda. The
exploit was hailed as a glorious
act and a victory for the Rabin
government. But acts, however
heroic, have consequences and
the Uganda raid leaves several
nagging questions.
In the long run, what has re
ally been won by the Israelis?
Saving the lives of a hundred
people at the cost of killing the
hijackers and 20 African soldiers
can obviously be considered a
net gain. But the hostages proba
bly could have been saved, with

no loss of life, by release of the
imprisoned terrorists.
The Uganda rescue will
hardly put an end to atrocities
against innocent human beings.
Terrorists have been killed be
fore, and reprisals made against
countries that harbored them,
yet there are always those fanatic
enough to take their place.
Uganda's General Idi Amin
has been made to look a fool in
the eyes of the world. Dictators
like Amin, with armies at their
disposal, seldom take such
humiliations lightly. His coun
try borders on Kenya, which was
involved in the Israeli raid and is
in the process of buying jet fight
ers and other sophisticated
weapons from the U.S. If Amin
should try to bolster his image by
reprisals against Kenya a fuse
may have been set that could ig
nite a large part of Africa.
But the most persistent ques
tion is: what hope is there for a
settlement between Israel and
the Palestinians that would put
an end to the continued cycle of
terrorism and reprisal that has
taken so many lives?
The problem of Israeli-Arab
relations has become only more
intense during the last year. Is
raeli land policies which involve
the expropriation of Arab land in
the Galilee have brought con
tinuing protest and the killing of
Arabs — including several chil-

dren — by Israeli police.
Israel has already established
50 settlements in Arab territory
captured in 1967, and continues
to plan new ones, even though
the U.S. charged last March that
such settlements are an obstacle
to peace efforts. This spring
Arabs in the occupied territories
voted overwhelmingly for can
didates representing the Pales
tine Liberation Organization, an
indication of their growing mili
tancy.
So far the Israeli government,
under pressure from rightist
groups pushing for further ex
pansion of Israel, has failed to
respond to calls for a peace in
itiative. With pressures increas
ing, the question remains as to
what steps the Rabin govern
ment will take next.
The Uganda raid was a
triumph of military planning
and execution. If its success
means that Israel will continue
to rely on military superiority to
put down its enemies, rather
than to seek political com
promise, then such incidents
can be expected to continue —
with loss of life on both sides and
always the possibility of a disas
trous war. It is this ever-present
possibility that gives the current
rejoicing a hollow ring.
