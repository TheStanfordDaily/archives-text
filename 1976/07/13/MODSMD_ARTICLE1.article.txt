tic candidate for the 12th Congressional Dis
trict seat now held by Republican Paul N.
McCloskey Jr. A profile of McCloskey will ap

David Harris, Stanford student body presi
dent, stepped out of his '42 Oldsmobile and
walked toward Hurlburt House where he had
been invited to a party.
"Mr. Harris," said a man as he put his hand
on Harris' shoulder.
About 20 masked members of the Delta Tau
Delta (Delt) fraternity ran up and dragged Har
ris into the bushes. They pinned down his arms
and legs and shaved off his hair.
Harris, now a Democratic candidate for Con
gress, says of the Oct. 20, 1966, incident. "It
was me and 40 football players -- I wasn't
going to make too strong a case physically.
They expected me to cry and beg them not to
cut my hair."
'Captive audience'
"But I figured I had a captive audience and
the only chance I'd ever have to talk to these
people. So I started talking issues of stu
dent politics and about how absurd the Delts
were acting. They got tired enough of listening
that they didn't shave off my beard as they had
intended to."
Harris spoken more than 100 times between
1967 and 1969 against the Vietnam warand the
draft. He refused his student deferment be
cause he said it discriminated against people
not in school.
He refused induction into the armed services
as an act of civil disobedience, and was sub
sequently convicted and jailed for 20 months
from 1969 to 1971.
After Harris was released from jail, he was
divorced from folksinger Joan Baez. He con
tinued to work against the war, and also cam
paigned for George McGovern, while support
ing himself as a journalist — he's a contribut

ing editor to Rolling Stone.
"Journalism is fun," he says, "but for me, the
role of standing back and commenting on
things is difficult." He speaks rapidly, and his
hands are in constant motion — folding and
opening and striking down on air for em
phasis.
"I'm an aggressive person. I have an interest
in making things happen. In politics you talk to
people. In journalism you listen."
"David came to Stanford anticipating a
career as an artist," says Political Science Prof.
Charles Drekmeier. "He was 'moderately
talented' in oils," Drekmeier recalls. "I re
member his art was always of people, never
landscapes."
Drekmeier refuses to take any credit for shap
ing Harris politically. "Before he left Fresno,
David had a pretty good idea of what was
genuine and what was not," Drekmeier says."I
suspect I learned as much from him as he
learned from me in political issues."
Robert McAfee Brown, former professor of
religious studies,says Harris "had more impact
on me than I on him."
Criminal
Brown adds that his own decision to encour
age students not to submit to the draft could
have made him a criminal accomplice. "But I
felt I had to be willing to take the risks too,
when guys like Daivd were putting it on the
line."
Harris didn't graduate from Stanford — he
never wrote his honors thesis. "At th*. time,"
he says,"I was more interested in draft resis
tance than writing papers. But the benefits of
my Stanford education are still with me,
whether or not I got the piece of paper."
As student body president, he tried to raise
student awareness that "education is a lot more
than going to class and getting grades. It's pos
sible to be a decent human being and go out
and do good things without a piece of paper."

HAIRY ENCOUNTER—David Harris lost his hair, but not his cool, when 20 members of the Delta
Tau Delta fraternity ambushed him and shaved his head in 1966. Harris is the Democratic congres
sional nominee in the 12th District.
Harris didn't finish his term as
student body president, either.
He says he resigned because al
though he raised the important
issues, students were relying on
him to affect the changes. "I'd
become the lid on the pot," he
says. "But for any of the prob
lems to be dealt with, they had to
be dealt with by all the people."
Inner strength
Harris says his jail experience
helped develop an inner
strength. "It's not the kind of
lifestyle in which you define
yourself in terms of the material
possessions you pile around
yourself," he explains. "All you
have is the resources inside of
you. Traditional intellectual
tools aren't much use."
Harris claims he became "very
theoretical" and much more
"situational" as a result of his
time in jail. He says he learned to
find the best way to deal with
situations as they are, rather than
seeking "one big theoretical
abstraction which is going to
explain it all. I still don't under

stand it all," he aa-is.
Harris decided to enter elec
toral politics when as lobby
ing in Washington He realized
he could be more effective by
procuring the power Rep. Paul
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park), the
incumbent he is now running
against, has than by fighting
him. "There's no outbide the sys
tem — that's a myth," ne says.
Realisbc
Tim Haight, student vice
president under Harris, and cur
rently a graduate student in
communications here, says Har
ris "is not packagi ng himself as a
politician — he's still committed
and trying to do what he can the
best he can. He's trying to do
what is realistic."
Speaking about his campaign
work, Harris says, "It's exhaust
ing. Three or four times a day I
say to myself what the hell am I
doing.
He says he has "fears and in
securities, just like everybody
else." As a 14-year-old, he had a
paper route. "I'd be so frightened

to go to some doors to collect,
that I'd just pay for the papers
myself," he says.
"There's a shy and timid
streak in me that I've had to
overcome," he reveals.
"There've been times when I've
wanted to hide and burrow
away. But I rarely feel that way
anymore."

work, Harris says, "It's exhaust

He says he has "fears and in

paper route. "I'd be so frightened

to go to some doors to collect,
that I'd just pay for the papers
myself," he says.
"There's a shy and timid
streak in me that I've had to

"There've been times when I've

David Harris, Stanford student body presi
dent, stepped out of his '42 Oldsmobile and
walked toward Hurlburt House where he had
been invited to a party.
"Mr. Harris," said a man as he put his hand
on Harris' shoulder.
About 20 masked members of the Delta Tau
Delta (Delt) fraternity ran up and dragged Har
ris into the bushes. They pinned down his arms
and legs and shaved off his hair.
Harris, now a Democratic candidate for Con
gress, says of the Oct. 20, 1966, incident. "It
was me and 40 football players -- I wasn't
going to make too strong a case physically.
They expected me to cry and beg them not to
cut my hair."
'Captive audience'
"But I figured I had a captive audience and
the only chance I'd ever have to talk to these
people. So I started talking issues of stu
dent politics and about how absurd the Delts
were acting. They got tired enough of listening
that they didn't shave off my beard as they had
intended to."
Harris spoken more than 100 times between
1967 and 1969 against the Vietnam warand the
draft. He refused his student deferment be
cause he said it discriminated against people
not in school.
He refused induction into the armed services
as an act of civil disobedience, and was sub
sequently convicted and jailed for 20 months
from 1969 to 1971.
After Harris was released from jail, he was
divorced from folksinger Joan Baez. He con
tinued to work against the war, and also cam
paigned for George McGovern, while support
ing himself as a journalist — he's a contribut

ing editor to Rolling Stone.
"Journalism is fun," he says, "but for me, the
role of standing back and commenting on
things is difficult." He speaks rapidly, and his
hands are in constant motion — folding and
opening and striking down on air for em
phasis.
"I'm an aggressive person. I have an interest
in making things happen. In politics you talk to
people. In journalism you listen."
"David came to Stanford anticipating a
career as an artist," says Political Science Prof.
Charles Drekmeier. "He was 'moderately
talented' in oils," Drekmeier recalls. "I re
member his art was always of people, never
landscapes."
Drekmeier refuses to take any credit for shap
ing Harris politically. "Before he left Fresno,
David had a pretty good idea of what was
genuine and what was not," Drekmeier says."I
suspect I learned as much from him as he
learned from me in political issues."
Robert McAfee Brown, former professor of
religious studies,says Harris "had more impact
on me than I on him."
Criminal
Brown adds that his own decision to encour
age students not to submit to the draft could
have made him a criminal accomplice. "But I
felt I had to be willing to take the risks too,
when guys like Daivd were putting it on the
line."
Harris didn't graduate from Stanford — he
never wrote his honors thesis. "At th*. time,"
he says,"I was more interested in draft resis
tance than writing papers. But the benefits of
my Stanford education are still with me,
whether or not I got the piece of paper."
As student body president, he tried to raise
student awareness that "education is a lot more
than going to class and getting grades. It's pos
sible to be a decent human being and go out
and do good things without a piece of paper."

HAIRY ENCOUNTER—David Harris lost his hair, but not his cool, when 20 members of the Delta
Tau Delta fraternity ambushed him and shaved his head in 1966. Harris is the Democratic congres
sional nominee in the 12th District.
Harris didn't finish his term as
student body president, either.
He says he resigned because al
though he raised the important
issues, students were relying on
him to affect the changes. "I'd
become the lid on the pot," he
says. "But for any of the prob
lems to be dealt with, they had to
be dealt with by all the people."
Inner strength
Harris says his jail experience
helped develop an inner
strength. "It's not the kind of
lifestyle in which you define
yourself in terms of the material
possessions you pile around
yourself," he explains. "All you
have is the resources inside of
you. Traditional intellectual
tools aren't much use."
Harris claims he became "very
theoretical" and much more
"situational" as a result of his
time in jail. He says he learned to
find the best way to deal with
situations as they are, rather than
seeking "one big theoretical
abstraction which is going to
explain it all. I still don't under

stand it all," he aa-is.
Harris decided to enter elec
toral politics when as lobby
ing in Washington He realized
he could be more effective by
procuring the power Rep. Paul
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park), the
incumbent he is now running
against, has than by fighting
him. "There's no outbide the sys
tem — that's a myth," ne says.
Realisbc
Tim Haight, student vice
president under Harris, and cur
rently a graduate student in
communications here, says Har
ris "is not packagi ng himself as a
politician — he's still committed
and trying to do what he can the
best he can. He's trying to do
what is realistic."

what is realistic."
Speaking about his campaign
work, Harris says, "It's exhaust
ing. Three or four times a day I
say to myself what the hell am I
doing.
He says he has "fears and in

else." As a 14-year-old, he had a
paper route. "I'd be so frightened

to go to some doors to collect,
that I'd just pay for the papers
myself," he says.
"There's a shy and timid
streak in me that I've had to

"There've been times when I've

anymore."

David Harris, Stanford student body presi
dent, stepped out of his '42 Oldsmobile and
walked toward Hurlburt House where he had
been invited to a party.
"Mr. Harris," said a man as he put his hand
on Harris' shoulder.
About 20 masked members of the Delta Tau
Delta (Delt) fraternity ran up and dragged Har
ris into the bushes. They pinned down his arms
and legs and shaved off his hair.
Harris, now a Democratic candidate for Con
gress, says of the Oct. 20, 1966, incident. "It
was me and 40 football players -- I wasn't
going to make too strong a case physically.
They expected me to cry and beg them not to
cut my hair."
'Captive audience'
"But I figured I had a captive audience and
the only chance I'd ever have to talk to these
people. So I started talking issues of stu
dent politics and about how absurd the Delts
were acting. They got tired enough of listening
that they didn't shave off my beard as they had
intended to."
Harris spoken more than 100 times between
1967 and 1969 against the Vietnam warand the
draft. He refused his student deferment be
cause he said it discriminated against people
not in school.
He refused induction into the armed services
as an act of civil disobedience, and was sub
sequently convicted and jailed for 20 months
from 1969 to 1971.
After Harris was released from jail, he was
divorced from folksinger Joan Baez. He con
tinued to work against the war, and also cam
paigned for George McGovern, while support
ing himself as a journalist — he's a contribut

ing editor to Rolling Stone.
"Journalism is fun," he says, "but for me, the
role of standing back and commenting on
things is difficult." He speaks rapidly, and his
hands are in constant motion — folding and
opening and striking down on air for em
phasis.
"I'm an aggressive person. I have an interest
in making things happen. In politics you talk to
people. In journalism you listen."
"David came to Stanford anticipating a
career as an artist," says Political Science Prof.
Charles Drekmeier. "He was 'moderately
talented' in oils," Drekmeier recalls. "I re
member his art was always of people, never
landscapes."
Drekmeier refuses to take any credit for shap
ing Harris politically. "Before he left Fresno,
David had a pretty good idea of what was
genuine and what was not," Drekmeier says."I
suspect I learned as much from him as he
learned from me in political issues."
Robert McAfee Brown, former professor of
religious studies,says Harris "had more impact
on me than I on him."
Criminal
Brown adds that his own decision to encour
age students not to submit to the draft could
have made him a criminal accomplice. "But I
felt I had to be willing to take the risks too,
when guys like Daivd were putting it on the
line."
Harris didn't graduate from Stanford — he
never wrote his honors thesis. "At th*. time,"
he says,"I was more interested in draft resis
tance than writing papers. But the benefits of
my Stanford education are still with me,
whether or not I got the piece of paper."
As student body president, he tried to raise
student awareness that "education is a lot more
than going to class and getting grades. It's pos
sible to be a decent human being and go out
and do good things without a piece of paper."

HAIRY ENCOUNTER—David Harris lost his hair, but not his cool, when 20 members of the Delta
Tau Delta fraternity ambushed him and shaved his head in 1966. Harris is the Democratic congres
sional nominee in the 12th District.
Harris didn't finish his term as
student body president, either.
He says he resigned because al
though he raised the important
issues, students were relying on
him to affect the changes. "I'd
become the lid on the pot," he
says. "But for any of the prob
lems to be dealt with, they had to
be dealt with by all the people."
Inner strength
Harris says his jail experience
helped develop an inner
strength. "It's not the kind of
lifestyle in which you define
yourself in terms of the material
possessions you pile around
yourself," he explains. "All you
have is the resources inside of
you. Traditional intellectual
tools aren't much use."
Harris claims he became "very
theoretical" and much more
"situational" as a result of his
time in jail. He says he learned to
find the best way to deal with
situations as they are, rather than
seeking "one big theoretical
abstraction which is going to
explain it all. I still don't under

stand it all," he aa-is.
