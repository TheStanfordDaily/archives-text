David Harris, Stanford student body presi
dent, stepped out of his '42 Oldsmobile and
walked toward Hurlburt House where he had
been invited to a party.
"Mr. Harris," said a man as he put his hand
on Harris' shoulder.
About 20 masked members of the Delta Tau
Delta (Delt) fraternity ran up and dragged Har
ris into the bushes. They pinned down his arms
and legs and shaved off his hair.
Harris, now a Democratic candidate for Con
gress, says of the Oct. 20, 1966, incident. "It
was me and 40 football players -- I wasn't
going to make too strong a case physically.
They expected me to cry and beg them not to
cut my hair."
'Captive audience'
"But I figured I had a captive audience and
the only chance I'd ever have to talk to these
people. So I started talking issues of stu
dent politics and about how absurd the Delts
were acting. They got tired enough of listening
that they didn't shave off my beard as they had
intended to."
Harris spoken more than 100 times between
1967 and 1969 against the Vietnam warand the
draft. He refused his student deferment be
cause he said it discriminated against people
not in school.
He refused induction into the armed services
as an act of civil disobedience, and was sub
sequently convicted and jailed for 20 months
from 1969 to 1971.
After Harris was released from jail, he was
divorced from folksinger Joan Baez. He con
tinued to work against the war, and also cam
paigned for George McGovern, while support
ing himself as a journalist — he's a contribut

ing editor to Rolling Stone.
"Journalism is fun," he says, "but for me, the
role of standing back and commenting on
things is difficult." He speaks rapidly, and his
hands are in constant motion — folding and
opening and striking down on air for em
phasis.
"I'm an aggressive person. I have an interest
in making things happen. In politics you talk to
people. In journalism you listen."
"David came to Stanford anticipating a
career as an artist," says Political Science Prof.
Charles Drekmeier. "He was 'moderately
talented' in oils," Drekmeier recalls. "I re
member his art was always of people, never
landscapes."
Drekmeier refuses to take any credit for shap
ing Harris politically. "Before he left Fresno,
David had a pretty good idea of what was
genuine and what was not," Drekmeier says."I
suspect I learned as much from him as he
learned from me in political issues."
Robert McAfee Brown, former professor of
religious studies,says Harris "had more impact
on me than I on him."
Criminal
Brown adds that his own decision to encour
age students not to submit to the draft could
have made him a criminal accomplice. "But I
felt I had to be willing to take the risks too,
when guys like Daivd were putting it on the
line."
Harris didn't graduate from Stanford — he
never wrote his honors thesis. "At th*. time,"
he says,"I was more interested in draft resis
tance than writing papers. But the benefits of
my Stanford education are still with me,
whether or not I got the piece of paper."
As student body president, he tried to raise
student awareness that "education is a lot more
than going to class and getting grades. It's pos
sible to be a decent human being and go out
and do good things without a piece of paper."
