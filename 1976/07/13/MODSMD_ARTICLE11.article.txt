# Solzhenitsyn seeks to de-mystify Lenin
## 
### Anne R. Sabetta 
Lenin in Zurich by Alexandr
Solzhenitsyn, translated byH.T.
WiJJetts, Farrar, Straus, and
Giraux, $8.95.

In his most recent work, Lenin
in Zurich (Paris 1975, U.S.A.
1976), Alexandr Solzhenitsyn
presents a most unique and pro
vocative portrait of the emigre
revolutionary during the deci
sive years 1914-1917. Solzhenit
syn's Lenin is unique because he
extends beyond either the histor
ical model of a Marxist re
volutionary whose ideas were
corrupted by Stalin or the Webe
rian psychological model of a
charismatic leader.
It is precisely this presentation
of Lenin's other side which
makes the book provocative;
Solzhenitsyn seeks to de-mystify
Lenin for Westerners and for
Soviet citizens in particular.
With respect to the Soviet Union
today. Lenin in Zurich stands as
a severe criticism of the Very
base of the regime.
Solzhenitsyn focuses on the
human side of Lenin, not to pre
sent his humaneness, but rather,
to establish his concerns as a de
termined revolutionary which
are so often missed or misrep
resented by both Soviet and
Western writers.
In Soviet hagiography, Lenin
is viewed as the heroic prac
tioner of Marxist ideology, as the
Plekhanov of theory and the
Blanqui of praxis.
And Lenin always bears the
torch of (Marxist) truth — espe
cially in the midst of Stalinist
vile and corruption. Minus the
sensationalism, this view gener
ally.holds for Western interpret

ers as well, despite any exposes
of Bolshevik Red Terror.
A more recent view proposed
by those with a taste for
psycho-history such as Robert
Tucker utilizes the Weberian
model of charismatic authority.
For the psychohistorians, the
Bolshevik victory hinges upon
Lenin's charisma as party leader,
upon his personal magnetism
and compelling speeches.
Solzhenitsyn, however, ex
tends both of these views to por
tray the exiled revolutionary as
an opportunist, as one who, in
his own fanaticism, seeks to turn
a world war into a civil war in
Russia.
Determination
While in Zurich, Lenin maybe
disheartened but he remains
thoroughly determined and un
compromising. Despite the
emergence of deviants among
the ranks of the Bolzsheviks, and
although he is surrounded by
enbourgeoisized Swiss re
volutionaries, Lenin works to
maintain a tight Bolshevik
cadre.
He is itching for revolution,
waiting for "some favorable tide
of affairs to carry his little boat
home — to a fait accompli." But
from the first page we under
stand that compromise is un
thinkable. The Bolsheviks alone
are to stage the proletarian re
volution in Russia and Lenin is
to direct it:
"All opposition exasperated
him - especially on theoretical
questions, where it implied a
claim to leadership. . . Embrace
the village idiot of socialism?
No. To hell with that. Give him a
tiny minority which was firm,


Atexandr Solzhenitsyn
sure, his own. . . His vocation —
he knew no other - was to
change the course of history. .
Lenin remains steadfast, even
on the most debatable and criti
cal issue of acquiring party
funds. He succeeds in getting
money from Parvus' German
commercial operation without
bending to this rival's "elephan
tine" notions of revolution.
With the exception of an occa
sional weakness for his mistress
Inessa, Lenin is exceedingly
ruthless.
For Solzhenitsyn's Lenin,
Realpolitik has replaced myth
making. His aim is to "seize the
helm" and his concern is thus
with practical details such as
maintaining good health and an
orderly household, reading pap
ers daily, and most important,
getting money. All these tasks
strengthen the party — and
power is what is needed to create
revolution.
It is most significant that
Lenin in Zurich, part of an as yet
incomplete opus magnus (deal
ing with Russia during the first
World War, 1917 Revolutions,
Civil War, and early Soviet
period), has appeared sepa
rately. Certainly this is a politi
cal move on the part of Sol
zhenitsyn.
What is serious is that the
de-mystifing process borders not
only on the cynical at times:
"Looked at dialectically, o
gendarme is sometimes a bad
thing and sometimes a good
thing."
but also deletes any trace of his
torical determinism at the ex
pense of omitting relevant his
torical circumstances.
The October Revolution is
wholly Lenin's baby, so to speak.
And any pre-existing revolutio
nary fervor or organization is the
product of mobilization by other
revolutionaries such as Parvus
and not a result of the inevitable
demise of the Tsarist regime.
Undoubtedly all this hurts the
USSR.
It is one thing to expose
Stalinist terror and injustice —
even Khrushchev did that in
1956 — it is wholly another to
gnaw at the very base of there

gime's legitimacy. The ultimate
effect is to label the USSR a hoax,
to make liars of Soviet leaders
and Western observers who up
hold the purity of 1917.
Heads will turn
And a serious result of the
book could very well be to move
the focus of the Solzhenitsyn
controversy from whether or not
the writer is an agent of im
perialism or a neo-Slavophile to
what complications his writing
will create in international rela
tions or even in Soviet domestic,
politics. Though the nature and
extent of such complications
remains unclear, Lenin in
Zurich will certainly turn a few
heads.

Lenin in Zurich by Alexandr
Solzhenitsyn, translated byH.T.
WiJJetts, Farrar, Straus, and
Giraux, $8.95.

In his most recent work, Lenin
in Zurich (Paris 1975, U.S.A.
1976), Alexandr Solzhenitsyn
presents a most unique and pro
vocative portrait of the emigre
revolutionary during the deci
sive years 1914-1917. Solzhenit
syn's Lenin is unique because he
extends beyond either the histor
ical model of a Marxist re
volutionary whose ideas were
corrupted by Stalin or the Webe
rian psychological model of a
charismatic leader.
It is precisely this presentation
of Lenin's other side which
makes the book provocative;
Solzhenitsyn seeks to de-mystify
Lenin for Westerners and for
Soviet citizens in particular.
With respect to the Soviet Union
today. Lenin in Zurich stands as
a severe criticism of the Very
base of the regime.
Solzhenitsyn focuses on the
human side of Lenin, not to pre
sent his humaneness, but rather,
to establish his concerns as a de
termined revolutionary which
are so often missed or misrep
resented by both Soviet and
Western writers.
In Soviet hagiography, Lenin
is viewed as the heroic prac
tioner of Marxist ideology, as the
Plekhanov of theory and the
Blanqui of praxis.
And Lenin always bears the
torch of (Marxist) truth — espe
cially in the midst of Stalinist
vile and corruption. Minus the
sensationalism, this view gener
ally.holds for Western interpret

ers as well, despite any exposes
of Bolshevik Red Terror.
A more recent view proposed
by those with a taste for
psycho-history such as Robert
Tucker utilizes the Weberian
model of charismatic authority.
For the psychohistorians, the
Bolshevik victory hinges upon
Lenin's charisma as party leader,
upon his personal magnetism
and compelling speeches.
Solzhenitsyn, however, ex
tends both of these views to por
tray the exiled revolutionary as
an opportunist, as one who, in
his own fanaticism, seeks to turn
a world war into a civil war in
Russia.
Determination
While in Zurich, Lenin maybe
disheartened but he remains
thoroughly determined and un
compromising. Despite the
emergence of deviants among
the ranks of the Bolzsheviks, and
although he is surrounded by
enbourgeoisized Swiss re
volutionaries, Lenin works to
maintain a tight Bolshevik
cadre.
He is itching for revolution,
waiting for "some favorable tide
of affairs to carry his little boat
home — to a fait accompli." But
from the first page we under
stand that compromise is un
thinkable. The Bolsheviks alone
are to stage the proletarian re

what complications his writing
will create in international rela

politics. Though the nature and
extent of such complications
remains unclear, Lenin in
Zurich will certainly turn a few
heads.
Lenin in Zurich by Alexandr
Solzhenitsyn, translated byH.T.
WiJJetts, Farrar, Straus, and
Giraux, $8.95.

In his most recent work, Lenin
in Zurich (Paris 1975, U.S.A.
1976), Alexandr Solzhenitsyn
presents a most unique and pro
vocative portrait of the emigre
revolutionary during the deci
sive years 1914-1917. Solzhenit
syn's Lenin is unique because he
extends beyond either the histor
ical model of a Marxist re
volutionary whose ideas were
corrupted by Stalin or the Webe
rian psychological model of a
charismatic leader.
It is precisely this presentation
of Lenin's other side which
makes the book provocative;
Solzhenitsyn seeks to de-mystify
Lenin for Westerners and for
Soviet citizens in particular.
With respect to the Soviet Union
today. Lenin in Zurich stands as
a severe criticism of the Very
base of the regime.
Solzhenitsyn focuses on the
human side of Lenin, not to pre
sent his humaneness, but rather,
to establish his concerns as a de
termined revolutionary which
are so often missed or misrep
resented by both Soviet and
Western writers.
In Soviet hagiography, Lenin
is viewed as the heroic prac
tioner of Marxist ideology, as the
Plekhanov of theory and the
Blanqui of praxis.
And Lenin always bears the
torch of (Marxist) truth — espe
cially in the midst of Stalinist
vile and corruption. Minus the
sensationalism, this view gener
ally.holds for Western interpret

ers as well, despite any exposes
of Bolshevik Red Terror.
A more recent view proposed
by those with a taste for
psycho-history such as Robert
Tucker utilizes the Weberian
model of charismatic authority.
For the psychohistorians, the
Bolshevik victory hinges upon
Lenin's charisma as party leader,
upon his personal magnetism
and compelling speeches.
Solzhenitsyn, however, ex
tends both of these views to por
tray the exiled revolutionary as
an opportunist, as one who, in
his own fanaticism, seeks to turn
a world war into a civil war in
Russia.
Determination
While in Zurich, Lenin maybe
disheartened but he remains
thoroughly determined and un
compromising. Despite the
emergence of deviants among
the ranks of the Bolzsheviks, and
although he is surrounded by
enbourgeoisized Swiss re
volutionaries, Lenin works to
maintain a tight Bolshevik
cadre.
He is itching for revolution,
waiting for "some favorable tide
of affairs to carry his little boat
home — to a fait accompli." But
from the first page we under
stand that compromise is un
thinkable. The Bolsheviks alone
are to stage the proletarian re
volution in Russia and Lenin is
to direct it:
"All opposition exasperated
him - especially on theoretical
questions, where it implied a
claim to leadership. . . Embrace
the village idiot of socialism?
No. To hell with that. Give him a
tiny minority which was firm,


Atexandr Solzhenitsyn
sure, his own. . . His vocation —
he knew no other - was to
change the course of history. .
Lenin remains steadfast, even
on the most debatable and criti
cal issue of acquiring party
funds. He succeeds in getting
money from Parvus' German
commercial operation without
bending to this rival's "elephan
tine" notions of revolution.
With the exception of an occa
sional weakness for his mistress
Inessa, Lenin is exceedingly
ruthless.
For Solzhenitsyn's Lenin,
Realpolitik has replaced myth
making. His aim is to "seize the
helm" and his concern is thus
with practical details such as
maintaining good health and an
orderly household, reading pap
ers daily, and most important,
getting money. All these tasks
strengthen the party — and
power is what is needed to create
revolution.
It is most significant that
Lenin in Zurich, part of an as yet
incomplete opus magnus (deal
ing with Russia during the first
World War, 1917 Revolutions,
Civil War, and early Soviet
period), has appeared sepa
rately. Certainly this is a politi
cal move on the part of Sol
zhenitsyn.
What is serious is that the
de-mystifing process borders not
only on the cynical at times:
"Looked at dialectically, o
gendarme is sometimes a bad
thing and sometimes a good
thing."
but also deletes any trace of his
torical determinism at the ex
pense of omitting relevant his
torical circumstances.
The October Revolution is
wholly Lenin's baby, so to speak.
And any pre-existing revolutio
nary fervor or organization is the
product of mobilization by other
revolutionaries such as Parvus
and not a result of the inevitable
demise of the Tsarist regime.
Undoubtedly all this hurts the
USSR.
It is one thing to expose
Stalinist terror and injustice —
even Khrushchev did that in
1956 — it is wholly another to
gnaw at the very base of there

gime's legitimacy. The ultimate
effect is to label the USSR a hoax,
to make liars of Soviet leaders
and Western observers who up
hold the purity of 1917.
Heads will turn
And a serious result of the
book could very well be to move
the focus of the Solzhenitsyn
controversy from whether or not
the writer is an agent of im
perialism or a neo-Slavophile to
what complications his writing
will create in international rela
tions or even in Soviet domestic,
politics. Though the nature and
extent of such complications
remains unclear, Lenin in
Zurich will certainly turn a few
