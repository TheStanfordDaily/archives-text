# Stories about declining stars fail to shine

### Howard Baldwin 
Crowned Heads, by Thomas
Tryon. Alfred A. Knopf, $8.95.

With Crowned Heads,
Thomas Tryon takes us away
from his territory of horror genre
(The Other, Harvest Home) to
the other side of motion picture
stardom. Crowned Heads com
prises four stories of stars whose
brightness has considerably
dimmed.
Normally, the decline and fall
of greatness is a worthy subject.
Unfortunaely, something went
wrong here. Of the 400-page
stories, one is fleetingly interest
ing; one is sadly sadistic; the
other two are incredibly long
winded and dull.
Having once been an actor,
Tryon is perhaps uniquely

suited for his subject. He con
cerns himself with the routine of
these has-beens' daily lives, the
point being that actors and ac
tresses are no different than any
body else, except that they're
more famous.
This point is emphasized and
then over-emphasized as the
same things happen over and
over, and the characters lose
what little fascination they had
in the beginning and become
unbearably burdensome.
Tryon draws each character's
deterioration with such harsh,
brutal proximity that, like glar
ing sunlight, it's difficult to
watch. Not only that, but he
takes so long to say so little that
instead of delineating interest
ing characters, he only succeeds

in alienating the reader.
The only interesting story is
that of "Bobbitt," alias child star
Bobby Ransome. As "America's
Fantasy Child" in the Bobbitt
film series, he captivated audi
ences everywhere.
As an older person — though
not an adult — he refuses to
leave behind the fantasy world
that deserted him a long time
ago.
The idea of a celebrity on a
treadmill unable to leave a cer
tain place in time psychologi
cally, is fascinating. If Crowned
Heads had only been about Bob

bitt, it might have been better.
Bobby Ransome's inability to ad
just is as intelligent a comment
Tryon makes on the brutality of
the public's capriciousness.
Saddled as it is with "Fedora,"
"Lorna," and the last story,
"Willie," though, "Bobbitt"
drags as if it were weighted.
"Willie," about the unex
pected visit of a hippie trio to the
home of an old, old character ac
tor, progresses from the dull to
the destructive over an amaz
ingly long period of time.

The four characters have one
film in common, The Miracle of
Santa Christi, but it only serves
as a touchstone for identification
from story to story.
As tenuous as it is, it is the
stories' only connection within
the novel (of course, the climax
of Willie is given away in Bob
bitt, the preceding story, but
that's a detail). Having no other
ties, they more resemble novel
las.
