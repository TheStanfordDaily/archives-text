As an inmate of the Hfr D Center, let me offer this
explanation of th( "horrible screeching noise"
that occasionally erupts from our building ("Bug
Me," fuly 7). When the ventilation system is
turned on, the drive bi ' of the ventilation bJovver
slips on the drive wheel. This emits a screeching
noise (similar to a problem sometimes encoun
tered ivith automobile fan belts) until the blower
speed is synchronized with the speed of the elec
tric drive motor.
Unfortunately the ventilation intake system
has the acoustic properties of a large tiled bat
hroom with an opening to the outdoors Thus the
residents of Donner and Larkin receive an
amplified and focused blast of noise. The Plant
Services computer which remotely controls the
ventilation is programmed to activate and de
activate the ventilation at random times during
tlu day and night. Let me propone several ways of

solving the problem:
(1 ) the ventilation intake system could be lined
ivith sound-absorbent baffling material;
(2) the ventilation system could be run con
tinually;
(3) the controller for the electric drive motor
could be modified so that it ivould start more
sloivly;
(4) the drive belt could be tightened; or
(5) Jason Mavis (director of plant services)
could spend 24 hours in Donner.-C.C.
By the time we got back to Mavis he had already
been informed about the problem by one of his
staff. He said that the ventilation system was
being reviewed for redesign this summer, and that
the screeching would most likely be corrected by
early fall. However. Mavis seemed distinctly un
enthusiastic about participating in the cherished
"residential living experience" next year.
