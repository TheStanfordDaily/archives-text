# Jordan arouses Demo delegates
## 
### 
NEW YORK—Calling his
party "hell bent for victory," na
tional chairman Robert Strauss
opened the Democratic national
convention last night at Madison
Square Garden.
The delegates have gathered
to nominate former Georgia
governor Jimmy Carter for presi
dent, but Carter did not appear at
the convention's formal opening
yesterday. Instead he dined with
members of his family at Mama
Leone's Italian restaurant and
then retired to his hotel suite.
Ohio Senator John Glenn and
Texas Congresswoman Barbara
Jordan were the keynote speak
ers last night, addressing a half
capacity audience that saved its
biggest applause for Jordan.
The Texan, the first black
woman to deliver a keynote
speech at a national convention,
cited her appearance as evidence
that "the American dream need
not be deferred forever."
Glenn remained one of six
senators still under considera
tion by Carter for the vice
presidential spot — one of the
few uncertainties in the Democ
rats' most placid convention in
many years.
Earlier yesterday, New Jersey
Congressman Peter Rodino
withdrew his name from consid
eration as Carter's running mate.
Citing a recurring vision prob
lem, Rodino, who had drawn
strong support from members of
the House, said he would place
Carter's name in nomination

Wednesday.
Most observers now give
Maine Senator Edmund Muskie
the best chance of being chosen
by Carter. A group of black dele
gates who supported Los
Angeles mayor Tom Bradley for
the second position on the ticket
met with Carter yesterday, but
Carter said he would limit the
possibilities to the six senators
he named earlier — all white
males.
