# Firings split paper's staff
## 
### 
A pair of firings by the student
publications board of the Uni
versity of Wisconsin's Daily
Cardinal divided the paper's
staff so much that two rival
copies of the summer registra
tion issue were issued.
After this year's pub board was
elected, it announced the firing
of editor William Swisolw and
business manager John Eugster.
according to associate editor
Andrea Schwartz.
"They said it was to open up
the edit board to students, but
that was a lie because they were
in a conspiracy with Patty El
son" (who became the new
editor), Schwartz said.
Most of the staff refused to
work for Elson, and so two
copies of the paper were issued:
the official Daily Cardinal and
the dissidents' issue, called the
Staff Daily.
