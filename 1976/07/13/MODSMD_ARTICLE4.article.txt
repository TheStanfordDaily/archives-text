making noise,"said Gloria
Morales, a library employe.
"Then I heard somebody say,

'He's shooting, he's shooting!'
Then I heard crying and people
running down the hall.
"I heard one girl running
down the hallway saying. 'He's
shooting at me!' "
Molly Lopez, another eyewit

Becker was called to the scene
shortly after the outburst. "They
were pounding on his (the

have a chance."
