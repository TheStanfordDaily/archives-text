# Hayflick's problem
## 
### 
Clayton Rich

There are several remarks that
I should make about Gene Ro
bin's letter to the Daily of June
29th commenting on Leonard
Hayflick's resignation.
First, the matter was not
"handled ultimately by an attor
ney." 1 conducted an inquiry
into possible serious violations
of University policy. An attorney
and several others were involved
in this inquiry but were not re
sponsible for its conduct.
I initiated the inquiry because
of questions raised by the Na
tional Institute of Health (NIH)
in the course of an independent
investigation that had been
started earlier by that agency.
If my recommendations had
gone to the president and if he
had decided upon disciplinary
action, Leonard Hayflick would
have had the right to formal ad
judication by his colleagues and
peers on the Advisory Board.
I particularly wish to com
ment upon Dr. Robin's remark
"as a faculty, we did have an im
portant responsibility for insur
ing him (Hayflick) an adequate
forum and insisting on a pre
sumption of innocence (until
and if proven guilty)." I agree
wholly with both concepts but
Dr. Robin's presumption that
these standards were not met is
not correct.
The "adequate forum" and,
very importantly, due process in
which a judgment of innocence
or guilt is made bv members of

the faculty, is the review by the
Advisory Board, available and
absolute as a right of every
member of the faculty.
In this instance, I had decided,
after a prolonged inquiry and
after review of a lengthy re
sponse to my concerns submit
ted by Leonard Hayflick through
his attorney, that there was sub
stantial evidence of serious vio
lations of University policy and
that I would recommend serious
disciplinary action to the presi
dent.
I informed Dr. Hayflick of this
and also informed him that, if
the president took any action of a
disciplinary nature, he would
have the right to a review by the
Advisory Board. However,
Leonard Hayflick resigned be
fore my recommendations were
forwarded to the president.
Finally, it is perhaps only be
cause I am of "the administra
tion." along with other deans,
the provost, and the president,
that I feel that Dr. Robin was car
ried away by his own rhetoric in
asserting similarity between
Stanford and Moscow Univer
sity in respect to "policies and
values." presumably including
the rights of personal and
academic freedom, and in cast
ing the administration as op
pressors to those rights.

29th commenting on Leonard
Hayflick's resignation.
First, the matter was not
"handled ultimately by an attor
ney." 1 conducted an inquiry
into possible serious violations
of University policy. An attorney
and several others were involved
in this inquiry but were not re
sponsible for its conduct.
I initiated the inquiry because
of questions raised by the Na
tional Institute of Health (NIH)
in the course of an independent
investigation that had been
started earlier by that agency.
If my recommendations had
gone to the president and if he
had decided upon disciplinary
action, Leonard Hayflick would
have had the right to formal ad
judication by his colleagues and
peers on the Advisory Board.
I particularly wish to com
ment upon Dr. Robin's remark
"as a faculty, we did have an im
portant responsibility for insur
ing him (Hayflick) an adequate
forum and insisting on a pre
sumption of innocence (until
and if proven guilty)." I agree
wholly with both concepts but
Dr. Robin's presumption that
these standards were not met is
not correct.
The "adequate forum" and,
very importantly, due process in
which a judgment of innocence
or guilt is made bv members of

the faculty, is the review by the
Advisory Board, available and
absolute as a right of every
member of the faculty.
In this instance, I had decided,
after a prolonged inquiry and
after review of a lengthy re
sponse to my concerns submit
ted by Leonard Hayflick through
his attorney, that there was sub
stantial evidence of serious vio
lations of University policy and
that I would recommend serious
disciplinary action to the presi
dent.
I informed Dr. Hayflick of this
and also informed him that, if
the president took any action of a
disciplinary nature, he would
have the right to a review by the
Advisory Board. However,
Leonard Hayflick resigned be
fore my recommendations were
forwarded to the president.
Finally, it is perhaps only be
cause I am of "the administra
tion." along with other deans,
the provost, and the president,
that I feel that Dr. Robin was car
ried away by his own rhetoric in
asserting similarity between
Stanford and Moscow Univer
sity in respect to "policies and
values." presumably including
the rights of personal and
academic freedom, and in cast
ing the administration as op
pressors to those rights.

ident for medical affairs and
dean of the medical school.)
