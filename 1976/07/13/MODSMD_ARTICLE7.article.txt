# Israel's just purpose

I must take issue with certain
statements made by Rachelle
Marshall on the Entebbe raid.
Entebbe cannot be discussed
as if it were a normal incident
involving (by now standard) ter
rorist demands for ransom and
release of jailed comrades.
For example, there is persua
sive evidence that Ugandan
president Idi Amin did not play
a neutral role in the skyjacking.
Statements from the released
hostages (quoted on July 10 at
the United Nation's hearings by
Israeli Ambassador Chaim Her
zog) report that at the airport
Amin was seen embracing and
shaking hands with the skyjac
kers.
Two selections were carried
out at Entebbe. The first in
volved the separation of Israeli
and non-Israeli passengers, and
the second saw 101 passengers
freed while 103 others, all
Jewish or Israeli, were detained.
The anxiety of the Israeli
people and government was jus
tified. Amin is an absolute dic
tator; a madman, capricious and
cruel, with no respect for human
life or law.
And it should be recalled that
in 1972, Amin sent a cable to the
United Nations approving the
killing of Israeli athletes at the
Munich Olympics, and praising
Hitler's racial policies.

I agree with Marshall that Is
raeli settlements in the occupied
territories are a violation of Arab
sovereignty.
But to speak of the tangled
question of Israeli expansionism
in the same breath with the kid
napping and possible murder of
over 100 innocent people (not all
of whom were Israeli) is both
short-sighted and chavinistic.
Would Marshall be so quick to
criticize if the hostages and re
scuers had been Arab? British?
Japanese?
Would she have preferred that
Israel wait to find out? And if the
hostages had been killed, would
she still say that Israel did the
right thing in waiting? If so. then
I bow to the courage of her con-

victions.
But she should not forget Mrs.
Dora Bloch, the 75 year old hos
tage taken to a Uganda hospital
before the raid, who was after
wards reportedly drugged from
her hospital room and
smothered by members of the
Ugandan secret police.
If Marshall is able to separate
the fate of the hostages from the
muck and rhetoric of politics,
then she will admit that the
death of Dora Bloch was a sense
less tragedy. And if there had not
been a raid on Entebbe, the
tragedy might have been multip
lied over 100 times.
