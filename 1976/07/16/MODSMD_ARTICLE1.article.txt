NEVV YORK —Calling party
unity "something that could
happen to the Democrats only
once in two hundred years,"
Jimmy Carter yesterday accepted
the Democratic nomination for
president and closed the party's
national convention.
Carter's running mate, Min
nesota Sen. Walter Mondale, met
t he approval of al most al 1 the de
legates, and of such dissimilar
Democrats as Ceorge Wallace,
Bella Abzug and Edward Ken
nedy. New Jersey Congressman
Peter Rodino and Louisiana
Senator Edward Long both pro
nounced Mondale "magnifi
cent."
Promising the wildly
applauding delegates that he
would be a president who "feels
your pain and shares your
dreams," Carter devoted much
of his long speech to attacks on
the policies of Republican Presi
dents Gerald Ford and Richard
Nixon.
Saying that under the present
administration "big shot crooks
go free while poor ones go to
jail," Carter said that only a
Democratic president could
"turn the country away from
scandal and corruption."
After Carter's speech scores of
the nation's Democratic leaders
joined Carter on the podium in a
show of the kind of party unity

that made this convention the
most harmonious in recent
memory.
Appointed in 1964 to fill
Hubert Humphrey's senate seat,
Mondale has been a long-time
protege of the former vice presi
dent — and it was Humphrey
who nominated him yesterday.
Humphrey called his senate
colleague a man of "compassion
and concern, fair and firm, tem
pered by a sense of humor and
purpose." He and Mondale both
stressed the geographical ba
lance of the ticket — and the fact
th.it. for the first time since IH4H.
.t man from the Deep South led
the party.
All of the major Democratic
primary candidates joined in
acclaiming the nominee — in
cluding California Cov. Edmund
Brown Jr.. who had stayed in the
campaign until the convention
opened.
Brown, who finally threw his
California support to Carter late
Wednesday, said he was pleased
by the party's new-found unity,
"it may never happen again." he
said, "so we should enjoy it
while it lasts."
