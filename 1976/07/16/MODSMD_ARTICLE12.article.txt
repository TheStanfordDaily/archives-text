It's traditional to charge two prices for campus
events — one for students and the other for "gen
end." which includes professors. As an emeritus
professor I'm still classified as "general," a/-
though my salary is half ivhut it used to he. Is the
tivo-price practice a rule? Hon about a change?-

Apparently the public events office sets the
example for the policy, although other or
ganizations are free to do what they like, accord
ing to the box office manager. And Tom Bacchetti.
public events director, says that the policy will
remain the same next year.
"We've been wrestling with this whole thing
for a number of years." Bacchetti said. "We do
receive general fund support from the University
and some part of that is tuition money, since cul
tural events are considered part of the students'
educational experience. On the other hand, we
don't get any funds from the University faculty
staff benefits pool."
I admire the Stanford police department's dili
gence in faithfully tit ketingevery car which porks
in front of Crothers Hall, but don't quite under
stand the reasoning. There aren't any students
living in Oof hers this summer, and so fur us lean
see. no conferences. Why then are those badlv

needed parking spaces reserved for the non
existent Crothers residents? -U'.C.
Those with weak hearts should sit down before
reading this answer. Because, believe it or not,
those spaces are reserved for the lowest of the low
— students. According to Police Captain
Wullschleger. any student living in a campus re
sidence can park in front of Crothers, some of the
choicest spaces around, absolutely free. We don't
understand this phenomenon either, but for once
the University is giving you something for free. So
take it.

If a person is extremely good looking, how does he
go about getting into modeling? I know this guy
that's extremely handsome and has a great body
to match; he's also flat broke. He'd be willing to do
any sort of modeling (local, e.g. for the Emporium
or national, for a beer company, etc.) Yet he re
fuses to check into this, fearing they'll ask him to
do some sort of obscene modeling, instead -
something he isn't into.-W.B.F.
Tell your friend to have some decent photos
made and to send them to a modeling agency. We
talked to the Grimme agency in San Francisco,
which assured us that their other clients aren't
"into" obscene modeling either, so to speak. If the
agency is interested, it will contact him.
