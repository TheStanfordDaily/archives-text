# USE, University to begin talks
## 
### Dave Ansley 
Negotiators for the University and I Inited Stan
ford Employees (USE) will officially begin talks
Tuesday on a new contract, but the two groups
have already begun sparring.
The current contract, which expires Aug. 31,
governs the employment of about 1350 technical,
maintenance and service employes. It was signed
in May 1974. after a three-week strike by the un
ion.
The two groups will be attempting to find a
compromise between each group's proposed
amendments to the current contract. The union
gave the University its demands in May, but the
University didn't present its proposals until late
Wednesday.
One serious bone of contention will be the fact
that the University offered no wage or benefit

suggestions in its statement.
Douglas Barton, University counsel for
employe relations, said that there were two
reasons for the omission. He complained that the
economic demands in the USE proposal were "far
from clear" and that "to the extent to which they
are clear, (they) are excessive and unreasonable."
USE president Jim Berk said that he couldn't
understand why the University took nine weeks
to tell the union that its wage proposals weren't
clear.
Barton termed Berk's confusion "more pro
fessed than real," and stated that he • "nt Berk a
letter May 20 asking for clarification. He said that
he has received no reply to his inquiry.
Berk said Ik; was also upset that the University
didn't explain its dissatisfaction with union de
mands by responding directly to USE proposals.

Barton said that whenever the
University did not respond posi
tively to a specific proposal, the
union could assume that the
proposal was being rejected.
Berk had no comment on the
specific proposals that the Uni
versity made, saying that "we
haven't thoroughly digested
them."
The union's negotiating team
will meet Monday to outline its
"rejoinder." which it will pre
sent to the University at Tues
day's opening session. The
teams will meet everv Tuesday

and Thursday thereafter.
The schedule was agreed
upon at a special conference
held last Tuesday. In those dis
cussions. it was decided that
union negotiators would be paid
for the time they missed from
their regular work hours, but
that they would not be reim
bursed for iiny extra hours of de
liberation.
At that meeting, the Univer
sity dropped its demand that the
union seat only five negotiators
and that none of them be
employes who receive time ciff
with pay for any other reasons.

Barton said that whenever the
University did not respond posi
tively to a specific proposal, the
union could assume that the
proposal was being rejected.
Berk had no comment on the
specific proposals that the Uni
versity made, saying that "we
haven't thoroughly digested
them."
The union's negotiating team
will meet Monday to outline its
"rejoinder." which it will pre
sent to the University at Tues
day's opening session. The
teams will meet everv Tuesday

and Thursday thereafter.
The schedule was agreed
upon at a special conference
held last Tuesday. In those dis
cussions. it was decided that
union negotiators would be paid
for the time they missed from
their regular work hours, but
that they would not be reim
bursed for iiny extra hours of de
liberation.
At that meeting, the Univer
sity dropped its demand that the
union seat only five negotiators
and that none of them be
employes who receive time ciff
with pay for any other reasons.
