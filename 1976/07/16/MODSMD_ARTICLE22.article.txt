# 'Murder By Death': Engrossing comedy
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
No one is who they seem to be. No
thing is as it seems to be. Nothing is
where it seems to be. That is the basic
premise hidden behind Murder By
Death, Neil Simon's uproarious answer
to Murder On The Orient Express.
A diabolical egotist, Lionel Twain
(Truman Capote, living at 22 Twain), in
vites five of the world's greatest detec
tives, all of whom have been glorified by
Hollywood, to a calamitous weekend at
his mansion in order to discredit their
talents and to prove that he is in reality
the world's greatest detetive.
On the guest list is Sam Diamond and
his faithful secretary Tessie from San
Francisco, who are supposed to be Sam
Spade and his faithful secretary Effie.
who were once Humphrey Bogart and
Lee Patrick, but are now Peter Falk and
Eileen Brennan;
Dick and Dora Charleston of New
York, who are supposed to be Nick and

Nora Charles, who were once William
Powell and Myrna Low but who are now
David Niven and Maggie Smith;
Jessica Marbles and her nurse of Lon
don, who are supposed to be Miss Marple
and her nurse, who are now Elsa Lan
chester and Estelle Winwood;
Messr. Perrier of Belgium, who is sup
posed to be Hercule Poirot, who was
once Albert Finney and even Tony Ran
dall, but who is now James Coco;
and Sidney Wang of Catalina, who is
supposed to be Charlie Chan, who was
once Sidney Toler and Warner Oland.
but who is now the spectacular Peter Sel
lers.
If you got through all that, the rest of
the review is a breeze.
Although Murder By Death starts
slowly, with far too many handicapped
jokes falling flat on their faces, once it
gets rolling, it gets engrossing. It feeds on
every mvstery storv written, with the ob

ligatory eerie mansion, the strange ser
vants of the eccentric millionaire, the
booby-trapped rooms, the incessant rain
and fog. and the mystifying portraits
with their eyes (and in this case mouths
too) cut out.
Of course, Simon (who has at times
been remarkably unfunny, this not being
one of those times) adds his own little
touches. Only he could conceive of pair
ing a blind butler (AlecCuinness) with a
deaf and dumb maid (Nancy Walker).
And like all murder mysteries, the sol
ution (or in this case solutions) comes in
the last seven minutes. If you miss the
last seven minutes, you can't understand
the movie.
Conversely, though, if you see the last
seven minutes, you still might not un
derstand 'he movie.
But Simon, in an exhibition of literary
dexterity rare and precious in screen
writers. has delicately walked the line
between utter hilarity and utter confu

sion. with complete hilarity coming out
on the winner's side.
Explaining the movie would be im
possible as wel 1 as criminal. except to say
that it is the perfect send-up of all the
mysteries we've had to sit through since
Hollywood discovered the whodunit.
And Simon is not the only one to be
applauded. Robert Moore's fast-paced
and fluid direction pulls no punches,
keeping the audience constantly entr
anced.
And the actors — t hey are magnificent.
If you thought Albert Finney's Hercule
I'oirot talked like he had a mouth full of
marbles, fear not Murder By Death. At
least you can understand the British ac
cents of Niven. Smith and Guinness, the
French accent of Coco, the Oriental ac
cent of Sellers, the lisp of Capote and
Falk's impression of Bogart.
There's no problem, of course, with
Walker, who doesn't speak at all. All she
does is laugh — just like the audience.
