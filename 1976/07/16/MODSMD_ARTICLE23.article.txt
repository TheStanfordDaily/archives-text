A group of conservative players wih an uncon

of each performer in nearly every number.
The audience clapped readily for the continu
ing barrage of solos, hut responded most favorably
to the fast moving ragtime rhythms.
Incorporating a variety of blues and ragtime
numbers, the band appeared to be enjoying their
own music, although several ot the musicians
seemed to be bored.
Spry Willie Humphrey livened the show with a
few attempted soft shoe and tap dance contor
tions. anil beckoned his willing audience to join
him in a parade around the auditorium when the
band played "When the Saints do Marching In"
as an encore to their two hour performance.
