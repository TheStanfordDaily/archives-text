## YWCA offers popular dance classes 
### Victoria LaBrie 
It's almost as much fun to
dance as it is to watch dance, and
in some instances, more enjoy
able. There is a wide variety of
activity for people interested in
dance going on in the Women's
Clubhouse on campus this
summer, thanks to the Stanford
YWCA. It's possible to see a
chorus line of tap dancers, Bal
kan Israeli folk dancers, or a
troupe of jazz dancers inspired
by a live funky jazz group.
What's more, you can participate
in these exhilarating classes and
gain exposure to an experience
that can't be found anywhere
else on campus.
Tap dance has received an up
surge of attention in the last two
years. Dottie Lidster. a profes
sional dancer for 11 years and a
current teacher of tap dance at
the YWCA, believes that tap has
gained popularity because of the
recent wave of nostalgia.
Lidster describes tap dance as
more rhythm than technique. Al
though a dancer uses the whole
body in tap. the main emphasis
is on the feet and legs. She
claims that slaves originated tap.
which has become a forerunner
of jazz dance, and could be

termed America's first contribu
tion to the field of dance.
Adults and senior citizens too
During class, the students
learn to make different sounds
with their feet by practicing dif
ferent steps. The object of the
class is to know a tap routine, to
execute the steps correctly and
to enjoy doing it. Lidster. who
has had tap. ballet and jazz train
ing is amazed that not only do
kids want to learn tap. but also
adults anil senior citizens as
well.
Elizabeth Larkham is an active
dancer who loves to teach. In her
jazz dance class, she emphasizes
technical study with spiritual
ity. to lead her students to be
come more aware of themselves
in order to make connection
with the body, mind and spirit.
Her main goal for the class is that
her students enjoy it and
that they increase their aware
ness rather than technique. She
strives for a balance of mental
stimulation, physical activity
and humor.
A former Stanford student,
Larkham began the Stanford
Dance Group in October, 1975
along with Gloria Goodall
among many others. She chose

to teach jazz because the YWCA
lacked such a program and she
felt she would be serving a need
on campus. She is currently
dancing with the Bill Evans
Dance Company in San Jose.
Balkan-Israeli dance popular
Jazz dance is more rhythmic
than ballet or modern, and could
possibly be termed a combina
tion of ballet, tap and modern.
Larkham's class consists of pre
parations and combinations,and
the live group adds much to the
atmosphere of spontaneity and
rhythm. She uses techniques de
veloped by buigi and Cunnin
gham. Larknam will be teaching
all through the summer.

Stanford YWCA since 1072. The
class centers around folk dances
of different cultures — Creek.

culturally mixed neighborhood
in Detroit. His parents were part
of the Rumanian ethnic com
munity and he accompanied

them to social events. As a teen

dance group that performed on
stage.
Nicoara has brought his ex
perience and his love of the
dances to his classes. During the
four years that he has been teach
ing for the YWCA. John has
taught over 350 Balkan-Israeli
dances to his classes, averaging
about 35 dances for each 10-
week session. In 1973. Nicoara

Stanford YWCA since 1072. The
class centers around folk dances
of different cultures — Creek.
Armenian. Polish. Rumanian—

early age while growing up in a
culturally mixed neighborhood
in Detroit. His parents were part
of the Rumanian ethnic com
munity and he accompanied

them to social events. As a teen
ager. he was part of a Rumanian
dance group that performed on
stage.

perience and his love of the
dances to his classes. During the
four years that he has been teach
ing for the YWCA. John has
taught over 350 Balkan-Israeli
dances to his classes, averaging
about 35 dances for each 10-
week session. In 1973. Nicoara
and his son visited Yugoslavia

and Rumania to research and
collect dances in several remote
villages, which he later pre
sented to his class as an original

of ethnic dances.
An expanded program of
dance, including those classes
conducted this summer, will be
offered on campus through the

in some instances, more enjoy
able. There is a wide variety of
activity for people interested in
dance going on in the Women's

chorus line of tap dancers, Bal

in these exhilarating classes and
gain exposure to an experience
that can't be found anywhere
else on campus.
Tap dance has received an up
surge of attention in the last two
years. Dottie Lidster. a profes
sional dancer for 11 years and a
current teacher of tap dance at
the YWCA, believes that tap has
gained popularity because of the
recent wave of nostalgia.
Lidster describes tap dance as
more rhythm than technique. Al
though a dancer uses the whole
body in tap. the main emphasis
is on the feet and legs. She
claims that slaves originated tap.
which has become a forerunner
of jazz dance, and could be

termed America's first contribu
tion to the field of dance.
Adults and senior citizens too
During class, the students
learn to make different sounds
with their feet by practicing dif
ferent steps. The object of the
class is to know a tap routine, to
execute the steps correctly and
to enjoy doing it. Lidster. who
has had tap. ballet and jazz train
ing is amazed that not only do
kids want to learn tap. but also
adults anil senior citizens as
well.
