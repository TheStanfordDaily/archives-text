U.S. stays in Olympics
MONTREAL—The United States
Olympic Committee announced yester
day that the American squad would de
finitely compete in the Montreal games
regardless of the outcome of the
Canada-Taiwan dispute.
The U.S. committee made its an
nouncement after Canadian Prime
Minister Pierre Trudeau softened his
government's position by offering a
compromise solution, which would
allow the Taiwanese to compete in the
games, use their flag and play their na
tional anthem.
But the Canadian position, which was
still awaiting comment by the Taiwan
government last night, would not allow
the Formosans to use the name "China."
Asked whether he thought the
Taiwanese would agree to compete, a
U.S. spokesman said. "There's always
hope — but at the moment it's rather
dim."
Reagan: 'ideological battle'
HARRISBURC, Pa.—Ronald Reagan
ended an Eastern campaign to woo un
committed Republican delegates by ob
serving that the selection of Walter Mon
dale as the Democrats' vice-presidential
candidate meant the November election
would amount to "the same old ideolog
ical battle" between liberals and conser
vatives.
Reagan, who was seeking national
convention votes in the the heavily pro-
Gerald Ford states of New Jersey and
Pennsylvania, warned that Ford would

be highly susceptible to charges linking
him with the Nixon scandals.
Ford, who called Carter last night to
congratulate him on the nomination,
said he thought he and Carter could wage
a "high level" campaign in the fall that
would offer the country "a real choice."
Syrians seek truce

yesterday in Lebanon with reports that
Palestinian guerilla leader Yasser Arafat
may soon go to Damascus for reconclia
tion talks with Syria.

badly needed a truce to lift the siege on
Beirut. Sidon and Tripoli, and that he
would likely accept the offer. But tine
Palestinian said any reconciliation with
the Syrians would be "a ballet dance
with knives."

to a Palestinian refugee camp in the
Lebanese capital, although artillery
duels around the camp may have eased.
