## Student nabbed in rare book theft 
### Mark Simonian 
Former part-time graduate
student James Wilson Mull
pleaded not guilty yesterday to
charges of stealing more than
$100.000 worth of rare hooks
and documents from Stanford
libraries.
Appearing with counsel.
Mull. 29. waived formal ar
raignment on grand theft,
burglary and possession of sto
len property counts in the Palo
Alto courtroom. He then re
turned to the north county jail in

Palo Alto .tlid was transported to
the main county jail in San Jose
last nij^ht.
Mull had just returned from ;i
somewhat longer trip, though.
Ho was extradited from Zurich.
Switzerland earlier this week by
Stanford and Santa Clara County
Sheriff's officers.
Police had chased Mull for l!i
months, through five countries
here and in Kurope. before he
was arrested in late April on
Swiss charges of defrauding an
innkeeper and attempting to as
s.uilt a Zurich officer with his
car. Stanford Police Capt. Walter
konar told newsmen.
Cornered
Languishing in a Swiss jail.
Mull was cornered by loud offi
cials and extradited. The ex
student also faces the federal
charge of unlawful flight to
avoid prosecution and Mritish
charges including traveling with
a false passport.
l-'lorian Shaskev. chief of the
Stanford library's special collec
tions, s.iid yesterday that police
recovered "essentially all" of the
stolen material. "We are de
iighted to have the material
back, essentially in good condi
tion," he said.
Police found 1 't boxes contain
ing 19;i rare books, some price
less. in a San Francisco
warehouse. The works range
from first editions of British and
American authors, material from
custom private presses and Kith
and 17th century tomes.
Mull was a non-matriculated
grad student in classics here dur
ing the 1974-75 year and he was
not taking courses for credit. The
University of Oregon graduate,
who has a burglary record in
North Carolina, told library per
sonnel he was studying to be a
rare books librarian.
"Odd patterns'
Shaskey characterized Mull as
somewhat suspicious because of
his "odd research patterns."
"1 didn't know him that well."
Shaskey added. "He appeared to
know classical literature and he
appeared to have some know
ledge of book collecting."
Shaskey said there was "no
evidence" that more than one
person was involved in the book
thefts. He noted that security in
the special collections is "not
lax." and he described the thefts
as "sophisticated."
Library personnel began to
catch on to Mull in February.
1975, Shaskey said, and in April
the police were called in.
Investigation
Konar told the Palo Alto
Times that on April H. 1975 he

began his investigation with in
formation that Mull was "in pos
session of .ind offering to sell
various rare books identified as
coming from the special collec
tion" here.
Scotland Y.ird officers s.iid
Mull attempted to sell several
thousand dollars worth ol asser
tedly stolen books to Sotheby's
auction house in London, an in
ternationally famous firm deal
ing in antiques and rare mate
rials.
On April 11.1975. with search
warrants in hand, police
searched Mull s I'alo Alto and
Redwood City residences. These
searches turned up evidence
which tied Mull to the thefts.
Konar said.
Hut by the time police were
ready to arrest Mull, he had fled
the country.
'One step behind'
Konar told the Times that the
investigations always seemed to
be "one step behind him (Mull).
We'd hear about him in Koine,
we'd contact the Italian State
Police. <ind suddenly the trail
would drop off and we'd pick it
up in Creece."
An alert Stanford student
spotted Mull at the International
Institute for Classical Studies in
Athens, but Mull disappeared
again before police had a chance
to collar him.
Konar said Mull "dropped out

of sight for a while. Then we
found In* was in London." Stan
ford officials notified both Scot
land Yard and Interpol, the in
ternational police organization,
but Mull gave the cops the slip
again.
Incidents
Finally in Zurich, Mull was
apprehended after a series of in
cidents connected with eight
unpaid hotel bills, Konar said.
Mull was tried and convicted in
Switzerland and sentenced to
six months in prison.
Swiss authorities notified
local police April 24.
Mull is scheduled to appear in
court again July 27 for "prelimi
nary examination," to determine
whether he should be bound
over for trial, a court spokesper
son said.
