# Rep. McCloskey resists becoming a politician'
## 
### Kit Warfield 
"I don't believe anyone should stay
in Congress more than 15 years â€”
there are too many pressures to
become a politician." says Pete
McCloskey. congressman from the
12th Congressional District, includ
ing Stanford, for the last nine years.
Theoretically, that means the 48-
year-old congressman plans to keep
his job for six more years. But right
now, he's fighting to keep it for the
next two.
McCloskey is being challenged for
his seat by David Harris, a former
campus radical and ASSU president
who was jailed for evading the draft.
Both candidates attended Stanford,
but McCloskey was here to decades
before Harris was. from 1946 to 1953.
McCloskey, who waged a symbolic
presidential campaign against Presi
dent Nixon in 1972 to protest ad
ministration of Vietnam policies, led
an uneventful career as an under

graduate. He was a "goof off" Phi Delt
who claims to have talked his way
into the Stanford Law School. Once
there, lie became a good friend as well
as a debate partner with John
Ehrlichman.
Won't 'play ball'
The congressman's career has taken
quite a different direction from that of
his law school friend. One other
friend says of him, "Pete could have
been a senator, he could have done a
lot of things, if only he would play
ball. But he won't play ball, he just
won't let himself be a politician."
And now, in what would seem to be
the prime of his years in Congress,
McCloskey is deeply involved in ev
erything he pledged to dedicate him
self to when he ran in a special elec
tion in 1967.
Running on his record as a leading
Palo Alto attorney in the conservation
field, McCloskey's campaign plat
form called for American withdrawal

from Southeast Asia.
In fact, he was the first Republican
to speak out in Congress against the
war, and he says he was "one of the
most active in the effort to end the
war."
Amnesty
McCloskey repeatedly submitted
bills advocating full pardon for draft
resisters and again last week called
upon President Ford to grant amnesty
to war opponents. A member of the
Select Committee on Missing Persons
in Southeast Asia, McCloskey spent
last Christmas in Vietnam, negotiat
ing the recovery of remains of three
American MIAs.
In subsequent campaigns McClos
key has stressed his work toward
open government.
He made the first speech on the
House floor urging the impeachment
of then-President Nixon, was active in
the passage of the freedom of Infor-
