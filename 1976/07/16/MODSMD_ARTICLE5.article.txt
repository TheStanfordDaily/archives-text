## Over-punishment 
### 
The recommended punishment of six individuals involved
in the Delta Tan Delta trashing incidents seems excessive. If
President Richard Lyman accepts the basic Stanford Judicial
Council recommendation that calls for two quarter suspen
sions of most of the students beginning fall quarter, an injus
tice will have been caused.
Taken collectively, the punishment of having the fraternity
suspended from campus seems very reasonable. The trashing
of other fraternities by a group of Delts is not a minor prank.
However, (in an individual basis, the suspensions uo not
make sense.
Consider that the individual charges against five of the six
students are:
—that one student emptied a recycling box of beer and soda
cans:
—another student overturned furniture, without any result
ing damage;
—a third student sprayed a fire extinguisher outside of the
Beta Theta I'i house;
—a fourth student dumped the contents of a garbage can
onto the floor; and
—a fifth student tipped over three bicycles, again with no
resulting damage.
The sixth student's admitted crimes are more flagrant.
There is no excuse for pulling a student out of bed and then
pushing someone into the wall hard enough to create a hole.
Except for the sixth student, the individual crimes do not
merit punishment beyond probation. We hone that President
Lyman considers each student by his own deeds, not by the
actions of others.
