I agree with hrr th.it Idi Aniin is ,i sadistic mad.-

Ami certainlv I am that most ot tin* hos

that meant meeting the liijai kers' demands
The purpose of mv column was to express ap
prehension tli.it the success ot the Kntehhe raid
might lead Israel to continue its policy of intr.ins
igeiw e toward the Palestinians and to rely more
than ever on military skill and superiority rather
than turn to negotiation and compromise.
Kamho's suggestion that I would have reacted dif

Israeli was irrelevant and totallv inexcusable in its

implications.

Anne R. Sabetta's review of Solzhenitsyn's
l.enin in Zurich (Daily. July I'l) provides an in
teresting example of academic bias, perhaps of .in
unconscious kind.
Solzhenitsyn's purpose is to demonstrate the
fundamentally evil nature of Soviet power. This
he is fully entitled to do.
The reviewer apparentlv holds that Solzhenit
syn's readers should accept .it least the basic as
sumptions of Soviet ideology, even though they
may censure Stalinist excesses.
The I legelian dialectic now operates with a new
twist. Revolutionaries have become legitimists.
Resistance fighters demand that their subjects
practice non-resistance. And atheist o[Hirutchiki
claim for themselves more than the divine right of
kings. „
