Rachelle Marshall (Daily, July
M) mis.sed the point of the Israeli
raid in Uganda. It was not. as she
implied, an act to glorify Rabin's
goverment nor was it a reprisal
operation or a step in a policy
towards a solution of the Palest
nian problem.
The simple fact that the raid
was first and foremost a mission
to save the lives of over a

hundred innocent people seems
to have escaped Mashall. Her
suggestion that "the hostages
probably could have been
saved" by releasing imprisoned
terrorists ignores the fact that the
gangs of international criminals
who perpetrate and support ter
rorism. have a less than out
standing record of respect ing ag
reements: moreover, the release
of their comrades will set loose a
new crop of the same criminals
bolstering their conviction that
they are on the right track.
The logic behind Marshall's
argument is that since terrorism
cannot be wiped out, one should

try to accommodate terrorists'
demands rather than fight them.
This reasoning will undoub
tedly be applauded bv countless
criminals around the world.
Acts of terrorism are among
the main reasons for Israel's re
fusal to deal with the PLO. It is
ironic that in the article, and
once agajn in the U.N. Security
Council. Israel stands as the ac
cused for her acts of self-defense
while nations who harbor and
actively support the terrorists
are hailed as peace-loving vic
tims or dismissed as not guilty
bv reason of insanity - .
