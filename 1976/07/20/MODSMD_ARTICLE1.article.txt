# Stanford swimmer takes first American gold medal

### 
MONTREAL —For Stanford
sophomore Mike Bruner it was a
dream come true.
Bruner, who took a year off
from the University to train for
the Olympics, bounded through
the water in the world record
time of 1:59.23 to lead an Ameri
can sweep of the 200-meter but
terfly on Sunday, the first day of
Olympic competition.
"This is the ultimate." said
Bruner, his shaved head shining
in the spotlight. "I've been work
ing for this for more than four
years and now it's all come true.
I'm so happy I don't know what
to say or do. Our team (the U.S.
men's swimming team) is so
good it could win every gold
medal here."
And it might happen.
Stanford teammate John
Mencken, who won the 200-
meter breaststroke in 1972. es
tablished himself as the favorite
to win the 100-meter
breaststroke.
Hencken first equaled his re
cord of 1:03.88 in the qualifying
heat and then set a new world
mark of 1:03.62 in the semifinal
heat. He was the third American
to shatter a world record yester

day, joining USC's Bruce Fur
niss and Karen Moe Thornton.

When he learned that Presi
dent Gerald Ford would call the
first American to win a gold
medal in the Games, Bruner said
he got "psyched."
"All I could think of was let it
be me," said Bruner. A short
while after the race Bruner said
he still hadn't heard from the
White House.
Steve Gregg, of Wilmington,
Del., was second to Hruner. who
will turn 20 in four days. Bill
Forrester, of Birmingham. Ala.,
was third. "Coming in second
was all right but no one will ever

remember me," said Gregg.
"They'll always say Mike Bruner
won a gold medal and what's
his-name was second."
Bruner said that his decision
to quit school for a year paid off.
"I had to lay out one year to
prepare for the Olympics. There
was no way I could go to school
and still get all the daytime sleep
and all the workouts I needed,
both in the water and on land
"I'll tell you. the satisfaction is
indescribable. I'll go back to
Stanford, where I've been prom
ised my scholarship and three
years more of eligibility. Wow!"
Bruner has a chance to be a
double winner. He will also
compete in the 100-freestyle.


I THINK HE'S HAPPY—Stanford's Mike Bruner seemed to be en joy
}ng. the 200-meter butterflv. He had just won the
i nited States first gold medal in the XXTOlympic games.
