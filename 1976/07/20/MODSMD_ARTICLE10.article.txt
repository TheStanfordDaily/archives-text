Why do so many people, including nuclear
physicists at Stanford and SLAC, pronounce the
word "nuc-you-lar?" Could it he an elite or tradi
tional pronunciation, like Gloucester or Worces
ter. or -horrors.'-could it he plain illiteracv?-
G.T.A.
Marvin Weinstein. a particle physicist at SLAC.
leans toward the illiteracy hypothesis.
"The word is written one way and has one pro
nunciation." said Weinstein. "There's no good
reason for pronouncing it the other way except
ignorance." But he admitted that he had heard the
other pronunciation floating around the place.
Incidentally, it might reassure you to know that
this isn't the only pocket of SLACk pronunciation.
Our staff reports hearing the word bungled as far
away as the Hanford nuclear plant, near Tri-
Cities. Washington.
What does "California" mean? What language
does it come from, and why was if chosen as the
name for our state?-C.C.
The name comes from a 15th century Spanish
romance, called The Exploits of Esplandian. ac
cording to History Professor Don Fehrenbacher.
California was a mythical island, described as
being on the right hand of the Indies and very
close to Adam and Eve's terrestrial paradise.
Ut course, California isn't an island, but when
Cortrz, who gave the state its name, landed at Baja
California, it must have looked like one. Califor
nia, in the story, was ruled by black Amazons,
headed by Queen Califia and populated by giants
and griffins. Ironically, it was also a land so filled
with gold that even weapons were made of the
stuff.
Of course, the area received other names. Sir
Francis Drake, who landed near San Francisco in
1579. christened the land New Albion (Albion
was another name for England). However, it was
Cortez's name which stuck and which catapulted

Garci Ordonez do Montalvo, author of the story,
out of the forgotten past and into the pages of
California state history books.

I'd like to know about the Orange Capri car al
lowed to park every day inside the Quadrangle by
bidg. 30. No license plate, no Stanford sticker at
all. Just a card for "loading. "It's a card I'd like to
have. Seems to be good for a whole year with no
time limits. -W.G.G.
It's a neat little card but it doesn't last for a full
year, according to the owner of one of these
handy-dandy permits. The card, which is given to
cars being used to transport heavy equipment (in
this case for one of the summer conferences), is
issued on a temporary basis. Check the card itself;
it should have the expiration date on it.

NOTE:Last week's "Bug Me" referred to the stu
dent parking area in front of Crothers as "abso
lutely free." However, according to Captain
Wullschleger of the Stanford Police Department,
this parking is not actually free, but is included in
the $5 parking fee paid by summer students.

Ut course, California isn't an island, but when
Cortrz, who gave the state its name, landed at Baja
California, it must have looked like one. Califor
nia, in the story, was ruled by black Amazons,
headed by Queen Califia and populated by giants
and griffins. Ironically, it was also a land so filled
with gold that even weapons were made of the
stuff.
Of course, the area received other names. Sir
Francis Drake, who landed near San Francisco in
1579. christened the land New Albion (Albion
was another name for England). However, it was
Cortez's name which stuck and which catapulted

Garci Ordonez do Montalvo, author of the story,
out of the forgotten past and into the pages of
California state history books.

I'd like to know about the Orange Capri car al
lowed to park every day inside the Quadrangle by
bidg. 30. No license plate, no Stanford sticker at
all. Just a card for "loading. "It's a card I'd like to
have. Seems to be good for a whole year with no
time limits. -W.G.G.
It's a neat little card but it doesn't last for a full
year, according to the owner of one of these
handy-dandy permits. The card, which is given to
cars being used to transport heavy equipment (in
this case for one of the summer conferences), is
issued on a temporary basis. Check the card itself;
it should have the expiration date on it.

NOTE:Last week's "Bug Me" referred to the stu

Wullschleger of the Stanford Police Department,
this parking is not actually free, but is included in
the $5 parking fee paid by summer students.


Why do so many people, including nuclear
physicists at Stanford and SLAC, pronounce the
word "nuc-you-lar?" Could it he an elite or tradi

"The word is written one way and has one pro
nunciation." said Weinstein. "There's no good
reason for pronouncing it the other way except
ignorance." But he admitted that he had heard the
other pronunciation floating around the place.
Incidentally, it might reassure you to know that
this isn't the only pocket of SLACk pronunciation.
Our staff reports hearing the word bungled as far
away as the Hanford nuclear plant, near Tri-

What does "California" mean? What language
does it come from, and why was if chosen as the
name for our state?-C.C.
The name comes from a 15th century Spanish
romance, called The Exploits of Esplandian. ac
cording to History Professor Don Fehrenbacher.
California was a mythical island, described as
being on the right hand of the Indies and very
close to Adam and Eve's terrestrial paradise.
