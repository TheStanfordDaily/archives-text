## How to choose the perfect stereo 
### John Garlich 
Stereo has become a more im
portant part of everyone's lives,
and any time that interest picks
up in any profitable field, man
ufacturers rush to introduce new
lines boasting "state of the art,"
equipment.
Through the maze of conflict
ing reports, specifications and
advertisements the consumer is
asked to choose his ultimate sys
tem.
There are three types of sys
tems which the buyer can select.
The compacts are those systems
combining a changer, AM/FM
receiver and usually an eight
track tape player in an all-in-one
console.
These systems range in price
from $150-$4OO and generally
produce music about as well as a
nice car stereo. They are not in
tended for the perfectionist.
Service problems
Buyers should avoid these sys
tems due to inherent service
problems. If one piece goes bad
your whole system is in the
shop. For a little more money
one can get into components that
are better made and sound a lot
better.
That brings us to the inter
mediate stage of equipment.
These systems range in price
from $400-$2OOO. This gear is
the most heavily advertised and
considered by most people as the
hot equipment.
The name brands are many:
Pioneer, Sherwood, Sony, Har
mon Kardon, Kenwood, Altec,
Bic Venturi and so on.

Because of the price range,
most buyers start with these sys
tems — and it is in this area that
people make their mistake. How
should the buyer choose his
equipment?
Stereo stores
Part of the problem are the
stereo stores. Most shops sell by
first demonstrating the big name
receivers followed by comparing
speakers and then the turntable
or casette deck.
This is backwards in some re
spects. The pieces of equipment
that are most influential in af
fecting the sound are the car
tridge and the speakers. (The
cartridge is often incorrectly re
ferred to as the "needle.")
Unfortunately the cartridge is
often neglected and "thrown in
with the deal." Yet along with
speakers they produce the most
marked change in sound. Choos
ing a cartridge from specifica
tions is next to useless. All car
tridges will claim to produce the
audible spectrum with no prob
lems.
However even though the
"specifications" will be th'e
same, the sound is quite diffe
rent. How do you find out which
cartridge to choose? You listen.
Esoteric gear
Stores catering to the more
esoteric expensive gear will
often have a turntable with two
or three tone arms. Using this
technique you can flip a switch
to hear one cartridge and then
another.
A simpler method is to set up
two turntables (preferably the

same) and play the same album
simultaneously. You'll hear the
difference.
Best bet are B&O MMC 6000
($100), ADC SIM 11, or the Sonus
($100), the B&P SP 12 ($B5) and
any number of cartridges, such
as Shure, Stanton or Ortofou
that list for about $75.
If you want a good inexpen
sive cartridge that is durable, the
Shure M 95 ED is okav.
But why save money on a car
tridge? For another $25 to $50
you can improve the system 100
percent!
Turntables are the next selec
tion. Here again most stereo
dealers mislead the public.
Rumble, .vow and flutter are
problems that are given much at
tention, and consequently it is in
these areas that the vast majority
of turntables excel.
As long as these criteria are
satisfied, so that they are in the
audible range, the most impor
tant feature is the tf e arm.
Low mass of the tone arm is a
must for good cartridges and
good tracking, whether or not
the stylus ("needle") can follow
the record's groove.
Changers are usually a waste
of money as few people will
stack their records.
Superior names
Either the Phillips 212 ($200)
or the B&O 3000 ($300), which
includes an excellent cartridge,
are far superior to the Duals and
Gerrards — the so called top
lines. In fact, Dual and Gerrard
have a much higher markup, and
that is where much of your "dis

count" comes from.
Receivers are next. Don't pay a
lot of money for lots of power.
The reason for the power is to
allow you to play speakers at
high volume with little distor
tion.
Most speakers today only re
quire 10-15 watts of power at
normal listening levels. You
should probably want between
20 and 35 watts RMS per chan
nel.
If your speakers require more
than this, they probably are in
the audiophile (stereo devotees)
class and cost between $500-
$2000.
Up until very recently, most
name brands receivers were bas
ically the same. Sony has just
come through with a new type of
transistor that is a relative break
through.
It has the capability of "surg
ing." i.e.. it will flow with the
music in order to hold down dis
tortion.
This is oversimplification of
their VFET transistor yet de
scribes the function.
Another new breakthrough is
Harmon Kardon's receiver line
which has very low distortion
ratings and can reproduce sine
and square wave (sound spectra)
like amplifiers four or five times
the price.
Speaker specifications
The Hamon Kardon 430 B
and 330 B are probably the best
receivers, as the Sony is still rela
tively new.
• Speakers - should, only be

picked through listening tests.
Specifications are only a check
to make sure they are not terri
ble. From there you rely on your
ear.
But many people don't know
what to listen for. Big bass ends
with large woofers and harsh
high tweeters are pushed on the
public as hot equipment.
Reproduce sound
Speakers are supposed to re
produce sound, not color it.
When comparing speakers, vol
ume levels must be the same. If a
pair of speakers is louder than
the other it will sound "better."
If volume levels are not equal
you cannnot fairly compare
them.
An excellent test is to hook up
a microphone into the system
and have a friend alternately
talking into the mike and away
from it. through the speakers and
"live." If the voice sounds too
bassy or "warm" or too high and
"harsh" the speaker colors the
sound.
As far as discounts go. you
will find the greatest savings in
systems prices — buy a quantity
of goods and get the best deal.
The biggest discounts are on
selected systems where the
dealer can match his highest
profit-margin equipment to
gether
Volume buying gets the best
deals. Even the non-discounted
equipment, generally the finer
equipment, can be obtained at
reduced prices if bought in
quantities.
