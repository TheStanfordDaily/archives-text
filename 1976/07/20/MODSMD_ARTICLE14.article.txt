# Bay Area blues release sparkles
## 
### Dan Forte 
Blues has always been in an awkward
position as far as record companies are
concerned. If a record label wants to
make money, blues is the last thing it's
going to touch. When it does record
blues, it is usually an expense-saving
project, with ridiculously low budgets.
Whereas a label's major rock or pop
star will compile production costs into
six figures, the bluesman's session is
usually confined to four, sometimes five,
figures. This, of course, is reflected in the
sound quality of many blues albums, but
after all it's only the blues, and that's
supposed to sound rough and earthy,
right?
Most blues recording is therefore left
to modest, independent companies, not
equipped to compete with major labels
— sound-wise, distribution-wise or
promotion-wise.
One-man
Berkeley's Arhoolie label, which is vir
tually a one-man operation, has served to
preserve more of America's indigenous
music than Columbia, Warner Brothers
and MCA put together.
Unfortunately, however, Arhoolie has
never been able to properly mix a group
of more than two or three pieces, mean
ing that such gems as Charlie Mussel
white's Takin' My Time and The Charles
Ford Bund featuring Robben Ford, while
they are musical masterpieces, are tech
nical disasters.
This is not to take any credit away from
"Mr. Arhoolie," Chris Strachwitz — if it

weren't for his good taste and tireless
dedication these performances would
not be around today at all.
Independent labels definitely serve a
purpose and fill a need. San Francisco's
remarkable resident pianist, Dave Alex
ander, recorded two LPs for Arhoolie,
then decided it was his turn to land a
contract with a major label.
No contracts
That was three and a half years ago,
and he is still waiting. Thirty years from
now, those two Arhoolie LPs may be his
only recorded legacy. Other artists, like
the influential Jimmy Reed, have re
signed themselves to touring concert and
club circuits, and simply not recording at
all.
Fortunately for blues fans, though,
25-year-old harmonica blower Cary
Smith was unselfish enough to bring in
several friends and fellow bluesmen to
put together a near-definitive anthology
of what's happening in the San Francisco
blues scene today.
In all, fifteen fine blues musicians ap
pear on Blue Bay,all incidentally agree
ing to play with no advance cash, in
hopes that the final outcome would net
some profits to be equally shared by all.
Smith himself plays harp on five of the
LP's fifteen cuts, besides taking over on
drums for guitarist Sonny Rhodes' two
offerings, when regular drummer Rick
Brocchini couldn't show.
Of the artists featured, only harp
stall wart Charlie Mussel white, a Bay
Area resident by way of Memphis and

Chicago, has ever had an entire album
devoted to himself and his band. Here he
is used as a sideman for Luther Tucker.at
40, a twenty-year veteran of some of the
best blues bands ever to come out of the
Windy City.
Side One opens with Ray Charles'
"Messaround." echoing the name of the
label which is throwing this party. Lead
guitarist HiTide Harris handles the lead
vocal, and if any blues singer can live up
to what was originally sung by "Baby
Ray," it's Tide. Sid Morris plays bouncy,
barrelhouse piano on this and
"Tipitina," the Professor Longhair tune,
also sung by Harris.
The LP's most "uptown" sounds come
from Texas-born guitarist Sonny Rhodes
— soon to be recorded by the Scandina
vian Blues Society, which fell in love
with Rhodes after a recent tour of Swe
den. Percy Mayfield's laid-back "The
Highway Is Like A Woman" is done in
typical Oakland-by-vvay-of-Texas fash
ion.
Sonny Rhodes, 35, is no blues shouter;
if any one word describes the way he
sings, it is "finesse." "Keep Holding
On," a Junior Parker number is done
more in the Memphis style (where Parker
held fort until his untimely death a few
years back), complete with trombone
(Dale Walter) and tenor sax (Ken Baker).
Slow blues
In a more traditionallv-Chicago groove
than Rhodes or Harris, guitarist Luther
Tucker rates the most extended cut on

the album, an eight and a half minute,
all-stops-pulled treatment of "Mean Old
World," a slow blues number written by
just one of Tucker's past bandleaders,
harp genius Little Walter.
Tucker is also featured on two instru
mental: "Tuckerology," an excerpt from
a 'live' performance with the Gary Smith
Band, sounding more than a little like
"After Hours;" and jazz pianist Eddie
Heywood's standard, "Canadian Sun
set."
While this offers a tasty change of
pace, Tucker's guitar and Musselwhite's
harp are unfortunately not quite in tune
with each other. Musselwhite and his
long-time pianist Skip Rose have known
Luther for years, and it was a wise deci
sion on Smith's part to team the three on
"Canadian Sunset" and "Mean Old
World."
Blue Bay is the type of album that
should have been released years ago. In a
way, it's a shame the project had to be
done on a shoe-string basis, through the
sweat and hard work of mainly one
musician, rather than by an established
label more equipped to pay the artists
and get the product to the people.
But on the other hand, because the ar
tists themselves controlled the direction
of the album's music. Blue Buy is totally
free of the sappy string sections, unim
aginitive horn arrangements, stiff as a
"rock" rhythm sections and overall
bullshit that plague all too many of the
so-called blues LPs to hit the market in
recent vears.

drums for guitarist Sonny Rhodes' two
offerings, when regular drummer Rick
Brocchini couldn't show.
Of the artists featured, only harp
stall wart Charlie Mussel white, a Bay
Area resident by way of Memphis and

Chicago, has ever had an entire album
devoted to himself and his band. Here he
is used as a sideman for Luther Tucker.at
40, a twenty-year veteran of some of the
best blues bands ever to come out of the
Windy City.
Side One opens with Ray Charles'
"Messaround." echoing the name of the
label which is throwing this party. Lead
guitarist HiTide Harris handles the lead
vocal, and if any blues singer can live up
to what was originally sung by "Baby
Ray," it's Tide. Sid Morris plays bouncy,
barrelhouse piano on this and
"Tipitina," the Professor Longhair tune,
also sung by Harris.
The LP's most "uptown" sounds come
from Texas-born guitarist Sonny Rhodes
— soon to be recorded by the Scandina
vian Blues Society, which fell in love
with Rhodes after a recent tour of Swe
den. Percy Mayfield's laid-back "The
Highway Is Like A Woman" is done in
typical Oakland-by-vvay-of-Texas fash
ion.
Sonny Rhodes, 35, is no blues shouter;
if any one word describes the way he
sings, it is "finesse." "Keep Holding
On," a Junior Parker number is done
more in the Memphis style (where Parker
held fort until his untimely death a few
years back), complete with trombone
(Dale Walter) and tenor sax (Ken Baker).
Slow blues
In a more traditionallv-Chicago groove
than Rhodes or Harris, guitarist Luther
Tucker rates the most extended cut on

the album, an eight and a half minute,
all-stops-pulled treatment of "Mean Old
World," a slow blues number written by
just one of Tucker's past bandleaders,
harp genius Little Walter.
Tucker is also featured on two instru
mental: "Tuckerology," an excerpt from
a 'live' performance with the Gary Smith
Band, sounding more than a little like
"After Hours;" and jazz pianist Eddie
Heywood's standard, "Canadian Sun
set."
While this offers a tasty change of
pace, Tucker's guitar and Musselwhite's
harp are unfortunately not quite in tune
with each other. Musselwhite and his
long-time pianist Skip Rose have known
Luther for years, and it was a wise deci
sion on Smith's part to team the three on
"Canadian Sunset" and "Mean Old
World."
Blue Bay is the type of album that
should have been released years ago. In a
way, it's a shame the project had to be
done on a shoe-string basis, through the
sweat and hard work of mainly one
musician, rather than by an established
label more equipped to pay the artists
and get the product to the people.
But on the other hand, because the ar
tists themselves controlled the direction
of the album's music. Blue Buy is totally
free of the sappy string sections, unim
aginitive horn arrangements, stiff as a
"rock" rhythm sections and overall
bullshit that plague all too many of the
so-called blues LPs to hit the market in
recent vears.
Blues has always been in an awkward
position as far as record companies are
concerned. If a record label wants to
make money, blues is the last thing it's
going to touch. When it does record
blues, it is usually an expense-saving
project, with ridiculously low budgets.
Whereas a label's major rock or pop
star will compile production costs into
six figures, the bluesman's session is
usually confined to four, sometimes five,
figures. This, of course, is reflected in the
sound quality of many blues albums, but
after all it's only the blues, and that's
supposed to sound rough and earthy,
right?
Most blues recording is therefore left
to modest, independent companies, not
equipped to compete with major labels
— sound-wise, distribution-wise or
promotion-wise.
One-man
Berkeley's Arhoolie label, which is vir
tually a one-man operation, has served to
preserve more of America's indigenous
music than Columbia, Warner Brothers
and MCA put together.
Unfortunately, however, Arhoolie has
never been able to properly mix a group
of more than two or three pieces, mean
ing that such gems as Charlie Mussel
white's Takin' My Time and The Charles
Ford Bund featuring Robben Ford, while
they are musical masterpieces, are tech
nical disasters.
This is not to take any credit away from
"Mr. Arhoolie," Chris Strachwitz — if it

weren't for his good taste and tireless
dedication these performances would
not be around today at all.
Independent labels definitely serve a
purpose and fill a need. San Francisco's
remarkable resident pianist, Dave Alex
ander, recorded two LPs for Arhoolie,
then decided it was his turn to land a
contract with a major label.
No contracts
That was three and a half years ago,
and he is still waiting. Thirty years from
now, those two Arhoolie LPs may be his
only recorded legacy. Other artists, like
the influential Jimmy Reed, have re
signed themselves to touring concert and
club circuits, and simply not recording at
all.
Fortunately for blues fans, though,
25-year-old harmonica blower Cary
Smith was unselfish enough to bring in
several friends and fellow bluesmen to
put together a near-definitive anthology
of what's happening in the San Francisco
blues scene today.

way, it's a shame the project had to be
done on a shoe-string basis, through the
sweat and hard work of mainly one
musician, rather than by an established
label more equipped to pay the artists
and get the product to the people.
But on the other hand, because the ar
tists themselves controlled the direction
of the album's music. Blue Buy is totally
free of the sappy string sections, unim
aginitive horn arrangements, stiff as a
"rock" rhythm sections and overall
bullshit that plague all too many of the
so-called blues LPs to hit the market in
recent vears.
Blues has always been in an awkward
position as far as record companies are
concerned. If a record label wants to
make money, blues is the last thing it's
going to touch. When it does record
blues, it is usually an expense-saving
project, with ridiculously low budgets.
Whereas a label's major rock or pop
star will compile production costs into
six figures, the bluesman's session is
usually confined to four, sometimes five,
figures. This, of course, is reflected in the
sound quality of many blues albums, but
after all it's only the blues, and that's
supposed to sound rough and earthy,
right?
Most blues recording is therefore left
to modest, independent companies, not
equipped to compete with major labels
— sound-wise, distribution-wise or
promotion-wise.
One-man
Berkeley's Arhoolie label, which is vir
tually a one-man operation, has served to
preserve more of America's indigenous
music than Columbia, Warner Brothers
and MCA put together.
Unfortunately, however, Arhoolie has
never been able to properly mix a group
of more than two or three pieces, mean
ing that such gems as Charlie Mussel
white's Takin' My Time and The Charles
Ford Bund featuring Robben Ford, while
they are musical masterpieces, are tech
nical disasters.
This is not to take any credit away from
"Mr. Arhoolie," Chris Strachwitz — if it

weren't for his good taste and tireless
dedication these performances would
not be around today at all.
Independent labels definitely serve a
purpose and fill a need. San Francisco's
remarkable resident pianist, Dave Alex
ander, recorded two LPs for Arhoolie,
then decided it was his turn to land a
contract with a major label.
No contracts
That was three and a half years ago,
and he is still waiting. Thirty years from
now, those two Arhoolie LPs may be his
only recorded legacy. Other artists, like
the influential Jimmy Reed, have re
signed themselves to touring concert and
club circuits, and simply not recording at
all.
Fortunately for blues fans, though,
25-year-old harmonica blower Cary
Smith was unselfish enough to bring in
several friends and fellow bluesmen to
put together a near-definitive anthology
of what's happening in the San Francisco
blues scene today.
In all, fifteen fine blues musicians ap
pear on Blue Bay,all incidentally agree
ing to play with no advance cash, in
hopes that the final outcome would net
some profits to be equally shared by all.
Smith himself plays harp on five of the
LP's fifteen cuts, besides taking over on
drums for guitarist Sonny Rhodes' two
offerings, when regular drummer Rick
Brocchini couldn't show.
Of the artists featured, only harp
stall wart Charlie Mussel white, a Bay
Area resident by way of Memphis and

Chicago, has ever had an entire album
devoted to himself and his band. Here he
is used as a sideman for Luther Tucker.at
40, a twenty-year veteran of some of the
best blues bands ever to come out of the
Windy City.
Side One opens with Ray Charles'
"Messaround." echoing the name of the
label which is throwing this party. Lead
guitarist HiTide Harris handles the lead
vocal, and if any blues singer can live up
to what was originally sung by "Baby
Ray," it's Tide. Sid Morris plays bouncy,
barrelhouse piano on this and
"Tipitina," the Professor Longhair tune,
also sung by Harris.
The LP's most "uptown" sounds come
from Texas-born guitarist Sonny Rhodes
— soon to be recorded by the Scandina
vian Blues Society, which fell in love
with Rhodes after a recent tour of Swe
den. Percy Mayfield's laid-back "The
Highway Is Like A Woman" is done in
typical Oakland-by-vvay-of-Texas fash
ion.
Sonny Rhodes, 35, is no blues shouter;
if any one word describes the way he
sings, it is "finesse." "Keep Holding
On," a Junior Parker number is done
more in the Memphis style (where Parker
held fort until his untimely death a few
years back), complete with trombone
(Dale Walter) and tenor sax (Ken Baker).
Slow blues
In a more traditionallv-Chicago groove
than Rhodes or Harris, guitarist Luther
Tucker rates the most extended cut on

the album, an eight and a half minute,
all-stops-pulled treatment of "Mean Old
World," a slow blues number written by
just one of Tucker's past bandleaders,
harp genius Little Walter.
Tucker is also featured on two instru
mental: "Tuckerology," an excerpt from
a 'live' performance with the Gary Smith
Band, sounding more than a little like
"After Hours;" and jazz pianist Eddie
Heywood's standard, "Canadian Sun
set."
While this offers a tasty change of
pace, Tucker's guitar and Musselwhite's
harp are unfortunately not quite in tune
with each other. Musselwhite and his
long-time pianist Skip Rose have known
Luther for years, and it was a wise deci
sion on Smith's part to team the three on
"Canadian Sunset" and "Mean Old
World."
