## Record stores aim to please 
### Kathy Ross 
The Peninsula has never been
noted for its record stores, but
between the 10 or 12 stores in the
Stanford area, you're bound to be
able to find what you're looking
for.
Whether it's low prices, a
browsable atmosphere, easy ac
cess by bike or a friendly sales
person you're after, you can get
satisfaction: unless of course,
you're looking for all of the
above in the same record store.
The following is a survey .of
the more popular disc shops
around which have been visited
incognito for a true feeling of
customer treatment and then
phoned for some additional in
formation on facts and figures.
BANANA RECORDS — 3159

El Camino Real, Palo Alto. 493-
1100. Open Mon.-Fri. from
10-10, Sat. from 10-9:30 and Sun
from 12-7:30.
The familiar oversize wooden
building block on El Camino
may have had you wondering
how anyone could breathe in
there, and more important, how
there could be room for much of
a selection. You might be pleas
antly surprised, if you're brave
enough to venture inside the
box.
The Banana has a cozy, per
sonal atmosphere and the sales
person is usually willing to play
any record you want to preview
before forking over the bucks.
Specialty of the house is jazz,
although all types of music are
available for the regular price of
$4.99 ($6.98 list). There's always
a sale of one sort or another with
prices going down to $3.99,
$3.66 and even $3.58. Proximity
to Stanford is one of its advan
tages.
THE RECORD FACTORY —
1347 El Camino Real West,
Mountain View. 969-3582. Open
Sun.-Thurs.from 10-10, Fri. and
Sat. 10-12.
If you're willing to take a 15-
minute drive south on El Camino
the newfest member of the Re
cord Factory chain is one of the
most pleasant and lowest priced
stores in the area.
Specializing in rock, the Fac
tory sells at an everyday price of
$4.98, but the sales price is the
lowest in Northern California —
$3.58. There are at least 50 LPs

on sale including many new re
leases and the store carries a
good variety of rock tee-shirts,
rock magazines and smoker's
goodies (including books on
how to grow your own).
The salespersons are friendly,
the sound system and acoustics
are great and nice carpeting
combine to make the Record Fac
tory a perfect hangout for record
store freaks.
One warning though: the rules
about personal checks are very
rigid. A Stanford I.D. won't do.
You must have two credit cards
in addition to your driver's
license, and your local address
must be printed on the check. No
exceptions.
THE WHEREHOUSE — 1915
El Camino Real, Mountain View.
961-9882. Open Mon.-Thurs.
from 10-11, Fri. 10-12, Sat.
10-10, and Sun. 10-8.
A few blocks closer to Stan
ford is the Wherehouse, a large
well-stocked store fairly com
parable to the Record Factory
(except in decor). The sales folk
here are excellent; they know
their stuff and are willing to
help. Best selections are rock
and classical.
There's not as much soul,
blues, jazz or imports as one
might like, but they have a very
good selection nonetheless.
The everyday price is up to
$4.98 due to what the record
manager describes as "record
manufacture's inflation."

browsable atmosphere, easy ac
cess by bike or a friendly sales
person you're after, you can get
satisfaction: unless of course,
you're looking for all of the
above in the same record store.
The following is a survey .of
the more popular disc shops
around which have been visited
incognito for a true feeling of
customer treatment and then
phoned for some additional in
formation on facts and figures.
BANANA RECORDS — 3159

El Camino Real, Palo Alto. 493-
1100. Open Mon.-Fri. from
10-10, Sat. from 10-9:30 and Sun
from 12-7:30.
The familiar oversize wooden
building block on El Camino
may have had you wondering
how anyone could breathe in
there, and more important, how
there could be room for much of
a selection. You might be pleas
antly surprised, if you're brave
enough to venture inside the
box.
The Banana has a cozy, per
sonal atmosphere and the sales
person is usually willing to play
any record you want to preview
before forking over the bucks.
Specialty of the house is jazz,
although all types of music are
available for the regular price of
$4.99 ($6.98 list). There's always
a sale of one sort or another with
prices going down to $3.99,
$3.66 and even $3.58. Proximity
to Stanford is one of its advan
tages.
THE RECORD FACTORY —
1347 El Camino Real West,
Mountain View. 969-3582. Open
Sun.-Thurs.from 10-10, Fri. and
Sat. 10-12.
If you're willing to take a 15-
minute drive south on El Camino
the newfest member of the Re
cord Factory chain is one of the
most pleasant and lowest priced
stores in the area.
Specializing in rock, the Fac
tory sells at an everyday price of
$4.98, but the sales price is the
lowest in Northern California —
$3.58. There are at least 50 LPs

on sale including many new re
leases and the store carries a
good variety of rock tee-shirts,
rock magazines and smoker's
goodies (including books on
how to grow your own).
The salespersons are friendly,
the sound system and acoustics
are great and nice carpeting
combine to make the Record Fac
tory a perfect hangout for record
store freaks.
One warning though: the rules
about personal checks are very
rigid. A Stanford I.D. won't do.
You must have two credit cards
in addition to your driver's
license, and your local address
must be printed on the check. No
exceptions.
THE WHEREHOUSE — 1915
El Camino Real, Mountain View.
961-9882. Open Mon.-Thurs.
from 10-11, Fri. 10-12, Sat.
10-10, and Sun. 10-8.
A few blocks closer to Stan
ford is the Wherehouse, a large
well-stocked store fairly com
parable to the Record Factory
(except in decor). The sales folk
here are excellent; they know
their stuff and are willing to
help. Best selections are rock
and classical.
There's not as much soul,
blues, jazz or imports as one
might like, but they have a very
good selection nonetheless.
The everyday price is up to
$4.98 due to what the record
manager describes as "record
manufacture's inflation."
The Peninsula has never been
noted for its record stores, but
between the 10 or 12 stores in the
Stanford area, you're bound to be
able to find what you're looking
for.
Whether it's low prices, a
browsable atmosphere, easy ac
cess by bike or a friendly sales
person you're after, you can get
satisfaction: unless of course,
you're looking for all of the
above in the same record store.
