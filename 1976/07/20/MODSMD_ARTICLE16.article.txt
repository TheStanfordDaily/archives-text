# Con men in Fun City
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
Once upon a time David Ward
wrote a movie about two con
men cheating a gangster with
two superstars called The Sling.
It was a critical and financial
success.
Not long afterwards, Gloria
and Willard Hyuck wrote a
movie about two con men and
one con woman cheating a
gangster with three superstars
called Lucky Lady. It was a criti
cal and financial failure.
Just recently, John Byrum and
Robert Kaufman wrote a movie
about two con men and one con
woman cheating a gangster with
four superstars called Harry And
Walter Go To New York. The re
turns have not yet been tallied
concerning its success.
This phenomenon is called
escalation. And like that other
memorable example of escala
tion, otherwise known as Viet
nam, bigger is not necessarily
better. We can mercifully thank
somebody, though I'm not sure
who, that Harry and Walter is
not as witless and ridiculous as
Lucky Lady.
Brassy
Harry And Walter Go To New
York is a fast-moving (though
not always logical), brassy
(though not always bright) ex
cursion into the 1890s world of
vaudevillians and gentlemen, all
of whom had inclinations to
ward wealth and the good life
and very little compunction
about exactly how to achieve
those goals.
The difference between The
Sting and all its dim and blurry
carbon copies is that its charac
ters had class. Their motives in
volved such acceptable Biblical
reasonings as revenge for mur
der and greed, an eye for an eye
so to speak. The only motives of
Harry (James Caan) and Walter
(Elliott Gould) for robbing a bank
only involve their own greed
and their desire to dine at the
fancy restaurants in New York.
The latter would unfortu
nately escape them even if they
stumbled upon gold. At a dinner
for which he has neither the
means nor the intention of pay
ing, Harry looks bewilderedly at
the cork the waiter offers him
and finally stuffs it nonchalantly
into his pocket.
Their cohort in crime, Lissa

(Diane Keaton), of whom they
think so little that they lie to her
even when she has been kind to
them, runs an alternative news
paper for anarchists. This pro
vides a suitable explanation for
Lissa's daffiness. Keaton's been
daffy ever since the Hour After
Hour deodrant commercials,
and I guess there's no reason for
her to change now.

Michael Caine plays Adam
North, a jimmy Valentine-type
safecracker, the epitome of
charm and villainy all rolled up
together. He is reminiscent for
some odd reason, of Robert Shaw
in The Sting.
Worth has the warden of the
prison in which he has been so

THE CON MAN—Elliott Gould plays Walter, a two-bit con man
thrown into jail and into contact with safecracker Adam North. His
dream is to be a bit-time vaudevillian. but his partner Harry (James
